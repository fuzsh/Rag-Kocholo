Schenck, born in 1807 in Franklin, Ohio, was appointed Midshipman in the United States Navy in 1825. During service in the Mexican War, he served under Commodore Stockton at Santa Barbara, San Pedro, Los Angeles, Guaymas, and Mazatlan. At Santa Barbara, in 1846, he raised with his own hands the first American flag to fly in California. He was highly commended for his service. Taking command of Sagi-naw in 1859, Schenck served on the China Station for two years, silencing a fort at Quinhon Bay, Cochin China, on 30 June 1861. Since Saginaw became unsea-worthy early in the Civil War, Schenck decommissioned his ship on 3 January 1862, proceeded home without waiting for orders, and was at once given command of St. Lawrence in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. Schenck commanded Powhatan and the 3d Division of Admiral Porter's fleet in operations against Fort Fisher, and he was mentioned for gallantry in Admiral Porter's action report. He was promoted to Rear Admiral on 21 September 1868 and retired on 11 June 1869. Rear Admiral Schenck died at Dayton, Ohio, on 21 December 1882.\"\n\nphoto\n\nneeded\n\nJames M.

Of his three children two survive him. He was married to Cordelia Brown of Clermont county, Ohio, March 14, 1868. She is left in her aged widowhood to mourn the loss of her aged companion. Her sorrow while deep, will be alleviated by the loving care of her children and twelve grand children.The funeral was conducted by the chaplain of the G. A. R. Post of Lebanon at Unity Chapel, Oregonia and the interment at the cemetery at Quaker church. He was followed by a large concourse of relatives and friends.As a soldier he did his duty at the call of his county. As a neighbor he was retiring and inoffensive. As a citizen he was respected by all who knew him best.Slowly perhaps, but not less certainly, the ranks of the boys of '62-'65 are being depleted. The feet that trod the wine-press in the bloody vintage of the Rebellion are growing feeble, the heads whiter, the eyes dimmer and soon the last tattoo shall sound for the last survivor of the greatest struggle fraught with the momentous results the world ever saw and it is to be hoped will never see again.\"\n\nphoto\n\nneeded\n\nWilliam L.

His entire life as a citizen was spent in and around South Lebanon where he was known far and wide for his genial and happy disposition. He always met you with a smile and hearty handshake. He was a kind and loving husband and father and now that he is gone his many words and deeds of affection will be cherished by wife and children as a sacred memory.\n\nFor years his home was beside the Methodist church and parsonage. The preacher’s home was the scene of many a deep sorrow. Within a few years three preachers and the Mother of a preacher’s wife died there. In these hours of grief Frank Sears and his family gave them their unstinted sympathy and in every way possible helping by word and deed and showing that he had a heart that was touched by the sufferings of those around him. He took an interest in the affairs of the Church helping them in times of need by his councils and his means. His sudden departure was a great shock to his many friends. The funeral was conducted by his Comrades of the G. A. R. in M. E. Church. He was buried in the cemetery near the village.\n\nCARD OF THANKS\n\nWe desire to return our sincere thanks to the friend’s and neighbors who so kindly comforted and helped us in our great sorrow and to the Members of the G.

G, 35th Ohio Volunteers, aged 34 years, was wounded at Chickamauga, Georgia, September 19th, 1863, by a conoidal ball, which entered the right shoulder, just behind the acromion, passed inward, injured the cavity of the shoulder-joint, fractured the clavicle badly in its external and middle thirds, produced a comminuted fracture of the first rib, passed obliquely upward under the skin, penetrating the neck between the trachea and the œsophagus, and emerged just in front of the left carotid artery, on a level with the pomum Adami. The œsophagus was slightly wounded, and the trachea partly severed and badly contused. He was taken to the hospital of the 3d division, Fourteenth Corps, where water dressings were applied, and liquid diet given. Severe inflammation ensued, followed by ulceration over the middle of the first rib and beneath the clavicle. On September 25th, the patient was sent to hospital No. 16, Nashville, and, on October 3d, to hospital No. 1. Pus was discharged for several months, during which time several spiculae of bone came away. On May 12th, 1864, he was transferred to the Corps d'Afrique Hospital, New Albany, Indiana, and, on June 29th, to the Hospital at Camp Dennison, Ohio, whence he was discharged on September 20th, 1864, for expiration of term of service. Pension Examiner E. Mendenhall reports that he examined Shaw while home on furlough in February, 1864. The external wounds were healed. The ulceration between the clavicle discharged large quantities of pus, with an occasional spicula of bone. The whole shoulder was very sore, tender, and immovable, and the arm and hand were swollen and numb. The neck was tender on both sides, and he could scarcely speak above a whisper. After a long and tedious process, the wounds all healed. Dr. Mendenhall re-examined this patient in April, 1866. He suffered from hoarseness and dyspnoea, which increased on exertion, and was, no doubt, produced by narrowing of the trachea at the place of injury. The arm and shoulder were partially paralyzed; but the general health appeared to be good.\n\nPension Index Cards\n\nFiled for pension on 26 Dec 1864 (SC#39154) for service in Co C 11th OVI & in Co G 35th OVI\n\nMary E.
