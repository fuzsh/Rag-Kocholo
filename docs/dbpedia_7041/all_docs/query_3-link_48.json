        "text": "Conceived by a committee of leading African American scholars and curated by the Lasry Family Professor of Race Relations at the University of Pennsylvania Dr. Tukufu Zuberi, Tides of Freedom let visitors explore the concept of freedom through the lens of the African experience along the Delaware.\n\nFeaturing artifacts from the Museum’s collection and gripping first-person accounts, there is no limit on opportunities for discovery and communication. By using four critical moments in Philadelphia’s history representing the themes of Enslavement, Emancipation, Jim Crow, and Civil Rights, Tides of Freedom urges visitors both to bear witness to a story central to Philadelphia and American history and to think about the meaning of “freedom” both historically and in today’s world.\n\nFor videos on the exhibit and other topics related to African-American History, please click here and here."
