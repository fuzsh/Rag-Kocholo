The funds to pay for the board and lettering were obtained by public subscription, George H. Shofner being the solicitor. The materials and carpenter work was furnished by B.L. Kofoed and the painting and lettering was done by C.G. La Fountain, of this village, each doing his part at less than cost. The board as it stands shows respect and honor the people of the community have for the boys who have entered the service and if our fighting sons at the front could see it they would be proud of the compliment paid them. All connected with its erection should be publicly thanked for the fine piece of work resulting from their efforts."
