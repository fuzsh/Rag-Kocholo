Highlighted by scores of family names that populate northeastern Wisconsin to this day, A German Bohemian Immigration provides context to a wealth of information compiled from sources in Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe area of western Bohemia, located in todays Czech Republic, in which these families resided saw an end to feudalism at roughly the same time as Wisconsin earned statehood in 1848. These changes brought about high hopes for a better life on both sides of the Atlantic, leading to a steady stream of German Bohemian emigrants that lasted for several decades."
