Samuel married Hannah Lorain Bostwick and had 7 children. He passed away on 31 Oct 1862 in New York City.\n\nIn his online history of the town of Delhi, New York, John D, Monroe notes:[1]\n\nSamuel Sherwood was born near Hudson Falls, N.Y., April 24, 1779, studied law first in Aurora, Cayuga County, and later at Kingston. He came to Delaware County in 1799, when he was appointed Deputy County Clerk by Ebenezer Foote on November 26, 1799. He was admitted to the bar February 12. 1800, and practiced law in Delhi until 1830, when he went to New York City where he died in 1862.\n\nSherwood was elected to the U.S House of Representatives in 1813 and served a single term.[2]\n\nLand Dealings\n\nWith respect to the character of Samuel Sherwood, reflected in his land dealings, seizing the lands of Henry Platner, John D, Monroe notes:[3]\n\nSherwood's principal employment from 1802 to 1807 was in the plunder of [Henry] Platner's western New York lands, through the medium of successive executions upon the satisfied but uncancelled judgement of 1787. In that process he sold Platner lands worth at the time $134,000 to himself and associates for less than $800. Thus, in March, 1804, he sold at a secluded tavern in Scipio 25 lots worth $28,950 to himself and Levi Baxter for $10.01; in October, 1806, 22 lots in eleven towns, worth $19,800 to himself and associates for $18.52; in May, 1807, 11 lots on five towns, worth $14,750 for $28. When called to account for this rapine, Sherwood's excuse was that he did not know that the deed and judgement of 1787 had been paid, and he tried to defend on the ground that Platner was civilly dead as a result of his conviction and life sentence, and his pardon did not revive and revest him with title to the denuded lands. This defense the court held was not good, and the excuse the court did not believe, as it found Sherwood was already intent upon the speculation at the date of the Delhi sale, when he ignored Hogeboom's suggestion that the judgement had been satisfied. Sherwood admitted that he heard what Hogeboom said but did not believe it.\n\nThe painstaking care with which Sherwood pillaged the Platner property repudiates any notion that he did not know that the debt and judgement of 1787 had been paid. When one observes the assiduity with which he fed and nourished the judgement with every penny of interest and costs his ingenuity could contrive, and the adroitness with which he manipulated these facts alone prove guilty knowledge on his part of the vice inherent in his judgment.\n\nBurial\n\nWoodland Cemetery, Delhi, Delaware, New York\n\nSources\n\n↑ John D.
