        "text": "Message from the Chair\n\nDepartment Spotlights\n\nAlumni Updates/Class Notes\n\nDonor Recognition\n\nMessage from the Chair\n\nSeveral of our current faculty garnered notable honors this year: Marcy Norton was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship. The department also earned four university-wide teaching prizes, two each for Denver Brunsman and Christopher Klemek.\n\nThis year, we are launching a new initiative in public history that will enable students to explore the many uses of history in the “real world,” including in museums, at historical sites and in the political arena. We are also continuing popular programs such as The Price of Freedom: Normandy 1944, which features a trip to France for undergraduates who visit the sites of the D-Day invasion.\n\nAs you can see, the department has ambitious plans. Unfortunately, funding reductions have impeded our efforts to extend critical support for graduate student summer research, student conference travel, and talks by important visiting scholars. Please consider donating to the department this year, if you can. Your support has a real impact on our research and on the educational activities we are able to offer our students.\n\nMost of all, however, we would like to stay in touch with you. Please feel free to contact me at [email protected]. Thank you for your ongoing interest in the History Department.\n\nDepartment Spotlights\n\nProfessor Joel Blecher Joins the Faculty\n\nThe department is delighted to welcome Joel Blecher as our new specialist in early and medieval Islamic history. Professor Blecher is a social and intellectual historian whose Arabic and Urdu language skills have taken him to archives in Syria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and India. His first book project, In the Shade of the Hadith: Islam and the Politics of Interpretation across a Millennium, investigates the understudied practice of hadith commentary within and across classical Andalusia, medieval Egypt and modern India. Beyond this manuscript, he has already published essays in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies, the Encyclopaedia of Islam, Oriens, the Oxford Bibliographies in Islamic Studies and several edited volumes. He is currently working on his second book, Profit and Prophecy: Islam and the Spice Trade from Venice to India. The study will examine how Muslim scholars and merchants in the Mamluk period (13th-15th centuries) mixed religion and business along trade and pilgrimage routes that stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arabian Sea and beyond.\n\nPrior to his arrival in Foggy Bottom, Professor Blecher taught at Oberlin College and Washington and Lee University (W&L). He has also been invited to speak about the Islamic world on National Public Radio, college radio and various podcasts. In addition to offering a wide range of courses in early and medieval Islamic history, Professor Blecher plans to continue a digital humanities project that he began with his W&L students, who collected, analyzed and visualized biographical data about the earliest transmitters of Islamic law.\n\nRead the GW Hatchet's profile on Professor Blecher here.\n\nLinda Levy Peck\n\nThis April, the department honored the distinguished career of Columbian Professor Linda Levy Peck on the occasion of her retirement. A full day of events featured scholarly presentations by her former doctoral students as well as roundtable discussions of her critical contributions to the field of early modern studies—at GW, in the broader D.C. community, through the seminars she led at the Folger Shakespeare Library and beyond. As Professor Denver Brunsman observed, Professor Peck’s influence has not stopped at the shores of England. Instead, it “stretches to topics and fields as diverse as the coming of the American Revolution and the European intellectual influences on Thomas Hobbes—the national and the transnational. Linda has set an impressive and timeless example for all of us to follow.”\n\nThe celebration concluded with a reception featuring tributes from undergraduate students and colleagues, past and present. Professor Peck arrived at GW in 1996 and for the next two decades taught popular classes on the history of Tudor and Stuart England. She is the author of the award-winning Consuming Splendor: Society and Culture in Seventeenth Century England (Cambridge University Press, 2005), The Mental World of the Jacobean Court (Cambridge University Press, 1991) and numerous other books and articles. Though she is no longer teaching, Professor Peck remains hard at work. She is currently in London completing the manuscript for her forthcoming book, Networks of Fortune: Money, Marriage, and Murder in Early Modern England, under contract with Cambridge University Press.\n\nFaculty Kudos\n\nTyler Anbinder’s long-awaited book, City of Dreams: The 400-Year Epic History of Immigrant New York (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2016), is hot off the press. Of the three articles he also published this year, he co-authored one—“Which Irish Men and Women Immigrated to the United States During the Great Famine Migration of 1846-54?” (Irish Historical Studies, Nov. 2015)—with GW undergraduate Hope McCaffrey.\n\nEdward Berkowitz was appointed co-chair of the advisory board of the Workers Compensation Research Collection at Rutgers University. He also published “The Leviathan and Its Detractors” in Ohio Valley History (Spring 2016). His collection of 23 interviews is the centerpiece of an oral history project entitled Insights from the Top: An Oral History of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nNemata Blyden published “'This na true story of our history': South Carolina in Sierra Leone's historical memory,” in Atlantic Studies: Global Currents (2015).\n\nThis July, Gregg Brazinsky published a Woodrow Wilson Center Working Paper on Chinese economic aid to Guinea and Mali in the 1960s.

The book was written to accompany the National Geographic and PBS three-part TV series, The Greeks: From Agamemnon to Alexander. In connection with the book, Professor Cline also gave tours at the simultaneous museum exhibit of the same title and spoke to groups including the National Hellenic Society, AHEPA (another Greek-American association), the Princeton Alumni Association of D.C., and various community groups.\n\nIn spring 2016, Eric Cline was one of the first 36 recipients to win the National Endowment for the Humanities’ Public Scholar Grant, described by The Washington Post as “a major new initiative designed to promote the publication of scholarly nonfiction books for a general audience.” The award freed him up to work on Digging Up Armageddon: The Story of Biblical Megiddo from Canaanites to Christians, on contract with Princeton University Press. In September 2015 a paperback version of his 2014 book, 1177 BC: The Year Civilization Collapsed, appeared with a new afterward.\n\nHope Harrison published \"United Germany at Twenty-Five: Progress, Pitfalls and a Lingering Legacy of Division\" in Advisor, the journal of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies (September 2015).
