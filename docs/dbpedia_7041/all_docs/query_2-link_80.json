        "meta_description": "“Situated at or near the top of America’s long list of ‘forgotten wars’ is the Great War of 1914–1918. The United States entered the conflict belatedly, and most Americans soon regretted having done so at all. Now, a century later, comes A. Scott Berg’s brilliant anthology to make remembering possible and even imperative. The result is gripping, simultaneously sobering and illuminating.”—Andrew J. Bacevich, author of America’s War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History",
