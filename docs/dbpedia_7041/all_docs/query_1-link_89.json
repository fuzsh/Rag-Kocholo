        "text": "ðŸ“£ New Podcast Episode: Renaming the U.S.S. Stennis In my latest episode of \"20 Years Done Podcast,\" we delve into the significant and timely topic of renaming the U.S.S. Stennis. The ship's namesake, Senator John C. Stennis, was a known segregationist whose policies and actions have left a lasting impact on the military. Join us as Reuben Green discusses the profound implications for Black servicemembers serving on a vessel bearing Stennis's name. His perspective offers a poignant reflection on the importance of symbols and names in our armed forces. Further, John P. Cordle, Dr. Eng, Pdt (Prolific Disruptive Thinker) provides an in-depth historical context of Senator Stennis, touching upon the Southern Manifesto and Stennis's role in it. We also explore why the current maintenance period of the U.S.S. Stennis presents an opportune moment for its renaming, considering the minimal associated costs. This episode is more than a conversation; it's a call to action and reflection on the values we uphold in our military institutions. Renaming the U.S.S. Stennis is a step towards acknowledging and rectifying the historical injustices and creating a more inclusive and respectful environment for all servicemembers. ðŸ”— Listen now to understand why this change is not just symbolic, but essential. https://lnkd.in/ej8byzZH #20YearsDonePodcast #MilitaryHistory #Inclusivity #USSStennis #RenamingHistory #Podcast #MilitaryCulture\n\nOut today on #ChainReaction, a podcast from the Foreign Policy Research Institute, Colin P. Clarke, Ph.D., Raphael Parens, and I discuss the Wagner Group and what they are up to now. Thanks to Bob Hamilton for a really interesting coversation - we probably raised more questions than we answered, but the discussion is an important one given that Wagner and Russian private military companies writ large, are unlikely to disappear anytime soon: \"Wagner Group: Where Are They Now?\" https://lnkd.in/eyw2ywKf\n\nStrategy is hard. Strategy is messy. Strategy is chaotic. Strategy takes time. There are no shortcuts to get you where you want to go. You have to set your goals over the horizon, put in the time and effort, and demonstrate the patience and will. A great podcast with Amos Fox and Jeffrey Meiser."
