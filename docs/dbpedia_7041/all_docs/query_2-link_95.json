        "text": "Preface\n\nNASA selected the first group of astronauts in 1959. From 500 candidates having the required jet aircraft flight experience and engineering training, as well as height below 5 feet 11 inches, seven military men became the nation’s first astronauts. The second and third groups chosen included civilians with extensive flying experience. By 1964, requirements changed, and emphasis was placed on academic qualifications; in 1965, six scientist astronauts were selected from a group of 400 applicants who had a doctorate or equivalent experience in the natural sciences, medicine, or engineering. The group named in 1978, NASA Class 8, was the first of the space shuttle flight crews and the first class with women and minority astronauts. In 2013, the astronaut class was fifty percent women and fifty percent men.\n\nThe most recent astronaut candidate group named in December 2021, NASA Class 23, graduated in March 2024 and are now training for a variety of missions, including performing research on the International Space Station, launching from American soil on spacecraft built by commercial companies, and departing for missions to the Moon with Artemis. The 2021 astronaut candidate class came from more than 12,000 applications. More information about NASA’s astronauts can be found at www.nasa.gov/astronauts.\n\nSince inception, NASA has selected 360 astronaut candidates: 299 men, 61 women; 212 military, 138 civilians; 191 pilots, 159 non-pilots.\n\nAs of July 2024, there are 48 active astronauts, 13 management astronauts, and 330 former astronauts or payload specialists, including those who have left NASA, and those who are deceased.\n\nThe spaceflights and statistics listed in this publication resulted from the vertical takeoff of an American space vehicle or Soyuz taxi flight to the International Space Station.\n\nAstronauts listed (unless otherwise noted) are individuals who participated in the United States astronaut program. Additionally, the payload specialist is a professional in the physical or life sciences or a technician skilled in specific equipment or experimentation that will fly. Selection of a payload specialist for a mission is made by the payload sponsor or customer. For NASA-sponsored spacecraft or experiments requiring a payload specialist, the specialist is nominated by an investigator working group and approved by NASA. Payload specialists for major non-NASA payloads or experiments are selected by the sponsoring organization. Payload specialists do not have to be U.S. citizens. However, they must meet strict NASA health and physical fitness standards. These individuals are included in the “Biographical Sketches.”\n\nNASA selects astronauts from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds. From the thousands of applications received, only a few are chosen for the intensive astronaut candidate training program. For more information on astronaut selection, please check online at www.nasa.gov/astronauts for the latest information.\n\nAstronaut biographies can be found online at: https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts.\n\nAstronaut biographies can be found online at: https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1.0 LIST OF U.S. ASTRONAUTS\n\n2.0 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES\n\n2.1 ACTIVE ASTRONAUTS\n\n2.2 MANAGEMENT ASTRONAUTS\n\n2.3 ASTRONAUT CANDIDATES\n\n2.4 FORMER ASTRONAUTS & PAYLOAD SPECIALISTS\n\n2.5 DECEASED ASTRONAUTS & PAYLOAD SPECIALISTS\n\n3.0 U.S. ASTRONAUT SELECTION BY GROUPS\n\n4.0 CONGRESSIONAL SPACE MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n5.0 ASTRONAUTS AFFILIATIONS TO STATES\n\n5.1 ASTRONAUT BIRTHPLACES\n\n5.2 ASTRONAUT HOMETOWNS\n\n5.3 ASTRONAUT COLLEGES\n\n6.0 ASTRONAUTS BORN IN OTHER COUNTRIES\n\n7.0 ASTRONAUTS’ SCOUTING RECORDS\n\n8.0 MILITARY ASTRONAUTS\n\n8.1 UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n8.2 UNITED STATES ARMY\n\n8.3 UNITED STATES COAST GUARD\n\n8.4 UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n\n8.5 UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n8.6 UNITED STATES SPACE FORCE\n\n9.0 U.S. SPACE PROGRAM HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT LOG\n\n9.1 PRE-SHUTTLE SPACE FLIGHT\n\n9.2 SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n9.3 COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM MISSIONS\n\n9.4 INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION EXPEDITIONS\n\n9.5 SPACEWALK STATISTICS FOR U.S. ASTRONAUTS\n\n1.0 LIST OF U.S. ASTRONAUTS\n\n2.0 Biographical Sketches\n\n2.1 Active U.S. Astronauts\n\n***There are 38 active NASA astronauts as of Oct. 2023***\n\nAYERS, V.
