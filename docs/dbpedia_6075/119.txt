HOWEVER bad you might think David Cameron is at managing relations with his own parliamentary party, he is worse than that. The enmity and mistrust between the Conservative leader and his backbenchers are long-standing realities that have been exposed and aggravated, but not invented, by last night's House of Commons vote on whether Britain should hold a referendum on its membership of the European Union (EU). Around 80 Tories defied a three-line whip by voting in favour of a referendum, though the opposition of the Labour Party meant that the government was never going to lose the vote on the motion, which would not have been binding anyway.
