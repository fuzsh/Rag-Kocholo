        "text": "In a series of papers for the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies the Conservative MP, Andrew Tyrie, highlighted the problem of Prime Ministerial neglect of Parliament under Tony Blair, characterising Parliament as, Mr Blair’s Poodle. The data presented by Tyrie included Prime Ministers’ voting records (see Tyrie’s graph right). This showed that Tony Blair had the lowest voting record of any postwar Prime Minister. In his first parliament from 1997-2001 Blair participated in only 8.6% of votes in parliament, and the following parliament from 2001-2005 he voted in only 7.5% of votes. Blair also holds the record for the lowest level of participation in a single parliamentary session (a parliamentary year) for 1997-98 when he took part in only 5% of votes. In contrast Blair’s predecessor John Major consistently participated in upwards of 30% of votes in each session for which he was PM, and in his final session as PM participated in well over 40% of parliamentary votes. Tyrie, who it should be noted does have a particular party political view, observed that:\n\nTony Blair dominates the executive more and bothers with Parliament less than any other Prime Minister in modern times… What distinguishes Tony Blair… is [his] neglect of, even disdain for Parliament. The decline of Prime Ministers’ activity in Parliament is of long standing but it has sharply accelerated since 1997. Except to make statements and his annual Prime Minister’s Questions, Tony Blair rarely visits the Commons. In the first two full Parliamentary sessions, the Prime Minister led his Government in debate on the floor of the Commons on only three occasions – less often than any Prime Minister in recent history. He also rarely appeared in the House to vote, giving MPs, particularly those on his own side, little opportunity to buttonhole him informally. His voting record is inferior to that of any Prime Minister since the War. Tony Blair’s contact with the Commons is little more than tokenism. (Andrew Tyrie (2000), Mr Blair’s Poodle: An agenda for reviving the House of Commons, Centre for Policy Studies).\n\nWhile Tyrie makes a powerful argument, and the data is clear, another explanation for the sharp decline in Prime Minsterial participation particularly from Major to Blair is that Major had such a small majority, particularly by his final session, that he needed every vote he could get (including his own) in order not to be defeated in parliament. In contrast Blair had large majorities of 179 in 1997 and 167 in 2001 and a sizeable majority of 66 in 2005. In short he simply did not need to turn up. If we compare Blair with Thatcher after 1983, when she had a majory of 144, rather than Major, Blair’s level of participation is lower but comparable.\n\nThere are also, other factors to bear in mind. The long term trend suggests that Prime Ministerial participation has been in decline since the war. This may be the result of a growth in Prime Minister’s duties, in particular their overseas responsibilities. While overseas trips are now much easier than in an earlier age when the PM could be away for several weeks at an overseas summit, partly as a result, there are now many more of such meetings. In an average year the British Prime Minister can expect, at least, to attend: the annual G8 summit; up to four European Council meetings; a trip to the UN; a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting; and several meetings with other heads of state most notably the US President. If one adds to this trips related to the launch of military action which dominated the terms of Blair and to some extent Cameron, then there are many occasions when the PM is simply not around to vote. We get a clear indication of the impact of responsibility on parliamentary voting if we look at David Cameron’s voting record. Between 2001 and 2005 when Cameron was a backbench MP he voted in 67% of votes. From 2005 to the 2010 general election, the parliament in which he was Leader of the Opposition, he voted in 25% of votes and since becoming Prime Minister he has participated in around 17% of votes in parliament.\n\nIt is also possible to argue that, while Blair attended Parliament less, he did introduce a number of reforms that made the Prime Minister more accountable to Parliament. He changed Prime Minister’s Questions from two fifteen minute sessions a week, to its current format of one half-hourly session a week. While some have argued that this meant he only needed to come to Parliament once a week instead of twice, it has also allowed for a more sustained questioning. Blair also changed the convention whereby Prime Ministers did not appear before parliamentary select committees, by agreeing to appear annually before the Liaison Committee, which is comprised of the Chairs of all the select committees. These sessions which often last over two hours, mark a significant opportunity to hold the Prime Minister to account. Blair’s performance before the Liaison Committee was quite something to behold, faced with thirty or so of Parliament’s leading experts Blair, on his own, would range with apparent ease across a wide and diverse range of policy areas. With the Parliamentary vote on military action in Iraq, Blair also established the convention whereby Parliament would be allowed to vote on British participation in hostilities abroad. Whatever the failings of Blair’s case for war in Iraq, this precedent almost certainly prevented British involvement in US-led military action in Syria earlier this year.\n\nAnother criticism of Blair was that his apparent neglect of Parliament set a bad example to other MPs, particularly in his own party. Critics of Parliament will often point to the photographs of an empty Commons chamber as evidence that our representatives are not working on our behalf. Aside from the television coverage, there are now a number of websites which allow us to track the activities of our MPs in Parliament, including Public Whip, and They Work For You. These sites arguably provide a useful service which allow voters to check that MPs are busy working on their behalf. However, they are not universally popular with MPs. In part this is because they are based on the assumption that MPs who are not speaking or voting in the chamber of the House of Commons are not working, when in fact they may be holding the government to account in a range of other settings, as is exemplified by the Prime Minister’s appearance before the Liaison Committee. MPs may be scrutinising the government through membership of a select committee, seeking to press our views on those in power by writing letters to Ministers or other public bodies, or as Tyrie observes by buttonholing Ministers in the tea rooms of Westminster. If they are government Ministers (including the Prime Minister) they may, indeed should, be developing policy in their department. Moreover, in many of these things the potential for MPs to have a significant impact on national policy or its impact on their constituency may be significantly greater than if they were speaking, or voting, in Parliament. The problem with many of these things is that they are much harder to demonstrate and measure. But we should perhaps bear them in mind and don’t assume that if MPs are not trooping through the division lobby pursued by the Party Whip they must be quaffing champagne on the terrace, the chances are they’re doing something very important, arguably with greater impact somewhere else.\n\nThe recent Cabinet reshuffle once again raised concerns about the size of the Government, and in particular its impact on the Executive’s power to control parliament through what has become known as the payroll vote. The payroll vote refers to all of those MPs and Peers who make up the Government and includes all Ministers as well as Whips and Parliamentary Private Secretaries (PPS). The convention of collective responsibility means that those holding these posts do not oppose Government policy and thereby provide the Government with a large block of guaranteed support, and votes, in Parliament. The relative lack of power of the House of Lords, coupled with the difficulty of maintaining discipline in a Chamber where members are appointed for life, means that the bulk of these posts are located in the House of Commons where they can have the greatest impact. However, critics point out that by stacking the numbers in the Government’s favour in this way Parliament’s ability to provide independent scrutiny is undermined.\n\nGovernment Ministers, Parliamentary Private Secretaries and indeed Whips can, and occasionally do, vote against the Government. For example, three coalition PPSs voted against the introduction of £9000 tuition fees in 2010 (two Lib-Dems and one Conservative). However, such actions are rare and the individuals concerned must resign from the Government. This in effect means setting aside any ambitions they may have for promotion, and is arguably a much more serious decision for those who have already begun to ascend the Ministerial ladder, than for those backbench MPs who may have less ambition, or at least less prospect, of obtaining Ministerial office. It may also be the case that MPs who are part of the Government are more likely to support policies which they feel part of, which may of course be why they have been brought into the government in the first place.\n\nThe payroll vote has grown considerably over the last century. The graph below, which is drawn from a dataset put together from The Guardian’s excellent datablog, shows how the size of the payroll vote as a percentage of the total membership of the House of Commons has grown since the start of the last century, from 6% of the House in 1900 to 21% of the current House of Commons. What is even more striking is the increase in the proportion of MPs from the governing party who have been drawn into the government. In 1900 only 6% of governing party MPs were members of the Government; 33 of these were Ministers and 9 were Parliamentary Private Secretaries. Under the current coalition government 95 MPs hold Ministerial posts, and 43 are Parliamentary Private Secretaries, with the result that 39% of coalition MPs are part of the Government. If we break that down according to the two parties in the coalition, 38% of Conservative MPs and 43% of Liberal Democrats are members of the Government.\n\nInterestingly, there are limits on the number of paid Ministerial posts. This was set out in the Ministerial and other salaries Act 1975, which limited the number of Cabinet Ministers to 22, and the total number of Ministerial posts to 84, along with 3 law officers and 22 Whips. This effectively sought to limit the size of the Government across both Houses to 109. However, this only limits the number of paid Ministerial posts. One way in which governments have increased the size of the payroll vote has been to appoint unpaid Ministers. The last Government to have less than the statutory 109 Ministers was the Conservative government of John Major in 1992. The current government has 12 unpaid Ministerial posts. Some of these are individuals who hold two posts in the Government and so still collect a salary for one of them. Grant Shapps for example, is an unpaid for his role as Minister without Portfolio, but does pick up a salary and attend Cabinet as Chair of the Conservative Party. Similarly, Jo Johnson (Boris’s brother) is an unpaid Parliamentary Secretary in the Cabinet Office, but is also an Assistant Whip for which he receives a Whips salary.\n\nThe number of posts which are held by individuals is also interesting. There are in total 131 posts in the current Government, including Whips. However, 10 members of the Government have two posts. Although this doesn’t lead to an increase in the size of the payroll vote, indeed, quite the opposite, it does mean that if these posts were redistributed on the basis of one-member one-post, the Government could, without the need to create any new posts, bring an additional 10 individuals into the Government. Although this is unlikely to happen overnight it is one way in which the Government could relatively quietly expand the payroll vote.\n\nAnother way which successive governments have expanded the payroll vote has been through the appointment of Parliamentary Private Secretaries. The increase in the number of these unpaid Ministerial aides has been perhaps the most significant means by which successive governments have expanded the payroll vote. Creating new PPSs is a relatively easy way of rewarding loyalty, and as long as their number does not exceed the number of Ministers, there is considerable scope for making new appointments. There are currently 43 PPSs, more than one for every two Ministerial posts in the House of Commons, although there has been a slight fall in numbers since the coalition was formed in 2010. The coalition has also been somewhat better at providing information about how many and who the PPSs are. This information, along with details of Special Political Advisors, has in the past been quite difficult to track down and as part of its pledge for greater transparency the current government has published lists. Although they have yet to publish a list following the recent reshuffle and the data presented here is based on 2012.\n\nThe continued growth in the payroll vote is, however, disappointing. A series of bodies including the Public Administration Select Committee, the Hansard Society and the Conservative Party’s own Commission to Strengthen Parliament have called for a reduction in the size of the government. Yet as The Guardian pointed out last year, this may well be the largest government ever.\n\nSpare a thought for the poor Parliamentary Private Secretary, perhaps the least glamorous job in British politics. These unpaid Ministerial aides have all the responsibility of being part of the Government, with none of the power. Their job is to support their Minister, they sit on the Minister’s shoulder in the Chamber, check facts, pass notes, and nod vigorously at the appropriate moment. With no departmental responsibilities they don’t get to speak on behalf of the Government in the House of Commons, and for fear of embarassing the Minister they rarely make personal interventions, and they have none of the Whips’ powers to make threats or offer rewards. They are in some respects little more than neutered backbenchers. The job of PPS is, however, generally seen as the first step on the Ministerial ladder, and is widely coveted by those MPs who wish to climb the greasy pole, which is most of them. Time served as a PPS, it is hoped, will lead on to bigger and better things, although this can be a long process with some MPs working their way slowly up the PPS ladder before being elevated to a Ministerial post. In the recent reshuffle, for example, Ben Gummer MP, was ‘promoted’ from PPS to the Minister for International Development to PPS to Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education. A number of PPSs moved up the ladder to the Whips office, including Gavin Barwell and Sam Gyimah, although none moved on to Ministerial posts. Some of course, may never make it, but must content themselves with their brief moment close to power.\n\nIn his memoirs, Tony Blair writes fondly of his Parliamentary Private Secretaries, although I think it’s fair to say that none are household names:\n\n[Bruce Grocott] was and is a wonderful guy – really sincere, decent and absolutely Labour to the innermost part of his being. In fact the best of traditional Labour He had been Mo Mowlam’s inspired suggestion for my PPS. It was a great choice. (Bruce was succeeded by two equally great choices, David Hanson and Keith Hill). David was a great networker, respected even by those who disagreed passionately with me; and also a very tuned-in politician in his own right. Keith was a witty, lovable and really tough operator who hid his toughness beneath the wit; but the toughness was there when you needed it. Keith’s great joke, which I found more amusing when I had left office, was to come and get me for PMQs at 11.57 precisely, throwing the door open and saying like a town crier: ‘Prime Minister a grateful nation now awaits.’ Tony Blair, A Journey, p.97.\n\nFor others, however, even those serving as PPS to the Prime Minister, it must seem a long way from the glamour of office. Gavin Williamson, who became PPS to the Prime Minister in the recent reshuffle received the following withering introduction to his role from the Speaker during this week’s PMQs:\n\nOrder. May I just say to the Prime Minister’s Parliamentary Private Secretary that his role is to nod his head in the appropriate places, and to fetch and carry notes? No noise is required."
