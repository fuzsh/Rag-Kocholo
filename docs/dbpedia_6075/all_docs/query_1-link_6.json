        "text": "David Cameron, says a friend, \"is the Duracell bunny.\" He bounces back. After the second leaders' debate most polls again gave victory to Nick Clegg, but around the Tory leader there is a hope that the worst is over: he has not imploded, his nerve held firm. \"When he came back into the green room we all just knew he had done a good job,\" says one of his team. \"With our candidate we are trying to create situations where he can be himself and then all will be ok.\"\n\nEvery party leader needs friends who tell journalists this sort of thing and it often isn't true. But Cameron's response to the rewriting of the election script has been characteristic: \"He has a capacity to make any crisis seem reasonable,\" says one colleague. \"He has been repeatedly stress-tested and this is just the latest time,\" says another.\n\n\"He is the most un-neurotic person I have ever met in my life,\" says Andrew Feldman, close since university and now the Conservative party's chief executive. \"It is a captivating quality. He is calm under pressure, extremely tough and straightforward.\"\n\nWe are familiar with politicians with unstable characters hidden behind unshakeable beliefs. Gordon Brown is accused of being like that and so was Tony Blair. Cameron emerges from every account as solid. Talking over the last fortnight to two dozen people who know him well, mostly off the record, I found few dissenting voices. Everyone describes his confidence, humour, quick thinking and tolerance. But press them to flesh out the Cameron agenda – why he wants power – and they falter. Talk soon falls back to his instincts.\n\nYou could call this the classic definition of a leader; Julius Caesar's manifesto was not the point; but 21st century politics looks for an agenda. It is that apparent void with Cameron which puzzles voters and his own party. He is a rooted pragmatist. His opinions are drawn from a series of rolling judgments about what he thinks right and wrong, rather than an explicable ideological narrative. For an electorate looking for settled substance, that is a problem. For a potential prime minister, it could be regarded as a strength.\n\nThere are bursts of irritation from him, but not rage. As a shadow minister puts it: \"I just can't work out what his insecurity is.\"\n\nBut being unfazed is not the same as knowing what to do. Ability, confidence – and arrogance – may yet carry Cameron to Downing Street: but beyond? The price of pragmatism can be the absence of conviction. Voters think they sense fakery – more spin than substance, pollsters persistently report. Cameron's circle know that is how he is seen, hate it, but don't know how to respond. The problem is that Cameron has never convincingly explained to an electorate stung by the expenses scandal and economic crisis why he wants to lead the country.\n\n\"He is not gripped by a specific sense of mission,\" says one member of the so-called Notting Hill set. \"He is not a visionary, not a man with a plan, but has surrounded himself with men who do have plans. In different circumstances he could be happy with totally different plans\". Another friend sums it up: \"He does not have a world view but an instinctive disposition.\"\n\nHis attitudes are traditional and heartfelt. His error has been to mould them into an artificial appearance of an over-arching ideology. All that Big Society stuff, which so baffles his party, is on one level an expression of long-standing Conservative values.\n\nEveryone close calls him a One Nation Conservative. One friend says he is \"almost Victorian\" – not morally, but in that he is powered by a sense of duty and responsibility. To Michael Gove, a Cameron intimate of long standing, he is \"Sir Alec Douglas-Home goes to Glastonbury\". He is tolerantly pragmatic, rather than liberal – accepting the idea of gay adoption, for instance, while if pushed admitting to feeling that parenting is best done by a man and a woman.\n\n\"He is a very simple bloke,\" says one friend. \"Bright, quick, he knows what he thinks, and people searching for some deep dark night of the soul aren't going to find it … He is what he appears to be; he does not have doubts about many things. He is a generous-spirited optimist.\"\n\nBut optimism, viewed in the wrong light, can appear shallow. One Conservative who worked with Cameron at the start of his career says there is something of the Basil Fotherington-Thomas about him, the Molesworth schoolboy sissy who wanders about saying \"hullo clouds, hullo sky\". Some Tories, wishing for a tougher campaign, are in despair.\n\n\"I prefer phlegmatic and proportionate leadership,\" responds one of his circle. \"Sensible and very English.\"\n\nThat spirit of Englishness was caught in vignette in a cricket match in June 2001, not long after Cameron became an MP. A Labour team took on the Conservatives in the Tory leader's Oxfordshire constituency – journalists, party advisers and politicians. Among those playing for Labour were future ministers James Purnell and Andy Burnham – two sides batting for power, politics reduced to an un-ideological game. There are Tories of the more doctrinal sort for whom that scene is a parable for what's wrong.\n\nThe match took place at the high noon of new Labour, when Cameron and friends, almost all working in some form of lobbying or journalism, seemed to ape Tony Blair. \"They saw how the metropolitan elite had taken over Labour,\" said one Blair supporter. \"They realised if they played things well they could take over the Tories in the same way. \"They didn't see the Tory reinvention as an ideological project.\"\n\n\"I never knew whether the script was developed in response to the circumstances in which he found himself, or whether he really had a burning desire to modernise the party,\" says one Tory who worked with him. \"You have to think it was the former. I don't remember him being a moderniser in the 1990s and in the 2005 election he wrote the manifesto.\" That document reduced the Tory agenda to right-of-centre simplicities. \"Cameron was the draftsman but not the architect,\" says a senior party figure. Odd, though, that not a hint of what became Cameron Conservatism whispered through.\n\nHe came into the party just as Margaret Thatcher's star was diving, and reputedly joined the Conservative Research Department after failing to land a job as a banker. At Oxford – Bullingdon Club notwithstanding – he was more than just another posh boy. \"He was very funny, with an easy charm which transcended his background. He had an extraordinary combination of self-confidence combined with a common touch,\" says Feldman.\n\nAlready, the Cameron of today was largely in place. \"Leadership in a man of 43 looks like astonishing cockiness in a boy of 22,\" says one of the people he worked with after Oxford. \"He was full of himself.\" And as ever, he did not burden himself with ideological baggage. \"I don't remember times when he espoused an unpopular cause or stood out against something that was wrong.\"\n\nThatcher's downfall was a shock – \"we were very upset to see it happen, felt it was very wrong and devastating,\" says one colleague. But Cameron's own career progress seemed obvious – \"he stood out among us,\" says a colleague. His circle believe they have thrived because \"we are good at it\" – Cameron, typically, running for the leadership against David Davis in 2005 in large part because he thought the frontrunner second rate.\n\nBriefing the prime minister for question time in his 20s, he was soon special adviser first to Norman Lamont at the Treasury and then Michael Howard at the home office. Former bosses remember Cameron for his ability more than beliefs, a willing dogsbody \"ready to roll up his sleeves\". Lamont says he was \"excellent, very receptive,\" adding carefully that he was \"not involved in key decisions in supporting sterling or not\". He was \"not as Eurosceptic as I am but he agreed with a lot I stood for,\" says the former chancellor. He was caught on camera behind a shaken Lamont on 16 September 1992 as he announced Britain had been forced to leave the ERM. For Cameron, says Lamont, Black Wednesday was \"a sobering lesson in how unpredictable and dangerous politics can be. That's valuable when you have zoomed to the top.\"\n\nIn the aftermath Cameron joined Carlton Television, promoting the company's bullish and confrontational boss Michael Green. This chapter – much written about elsewhere – is seen by many as Cameron at his worst: pushy and manipulative.\n\nMeanwhile, the Notting Hill set was flourishing. \"He and Sam [they married in 1996] were at the heart of it,\" says one occasional visitor to the Cameron home. \"They had significantly more cash than other people in our generation. It allowed them to rise a few notches higher.\" How grand the couple are is a matter of opinion. Cameron's friends see him as upper-middle class and his wife as upper class, and neither notably wealthy by the measures of those elites. \"He leads the life of a university-educated 40-something, the Nick Hornby-reading professional generation\". But an Etonian background and aristocratic connections put him unimaginably high on the social and economic scale.\n\nCameron believes Britain is broken by repute, not by experience of living in a broken community. Most people are not invited to join White's or to hunt, as he did growing up – and on at least one occasion in his constituency. He is said to be an outstanding shot. Deer stalking, like hunting in Scotland, is another hobby that the exposure of politics has forced him to put on hold.\n\nCameron, says a friend, \"is maniacally gregarious. He and Sam have people permanently to lunch or dinner or to stay the weekend. They have total confidence. We will be exactly as we are, they believe, and you will think we are great. I suspect he doesn't like being alone. He is not given to sitting pondering himself and his lot in life.\"\n\nThe couple's friends are long established: \"He commands enormous personal loyalty,\" says Feldman. There is a gaudy north Oxfordshire set, including the Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson – a real Cameron friend – and Rebekah Brooks, former editor of the News of the World and now News International chief executive, who talked Rupert Murdoch round to Cameron's cause. Some are \"friends of convenience – the relationship is a bit perfunctory,\" says one visitor. But that doesn't stop the Camerons \"lushing up people who will be influential. They will have people to lunch only because he wants to be prime minister. It seems completely normal to them.\"\n\nThere are others \"who while not uncritical will be completely loyal\". \"Although he now gets invited to lots more parties, he is just as happy hanging out with his old friends,\" says Feldman.\n\nThis gang is notoriously unpopular with the wider party. \"Cameron never looks you in the eye, always looks over your shoulder, he has smart friends, is dreadful with small people and thinks most of the world are small people,\" says one disgruntled shadow minister.\n\nBut the supporting group is unrepentant. \"Which leader has not been criticised for being too isolated?\" asks one. \"The problem is the group is not tight enough,\" says another. \"If we lose, then they can have a go at us. I know what will happen if we lose.\" There isn't mutiny in Tory ranks yet but if Cameron fails to win his once-expected majority, the disaffected will come for him.\n\nCameron's allies say his team is heterogeneous: not everyone has been mates since Eton. Steve Hilton is the son of Hungarian migrants; Gove was adopted; Andy Coulson did not go to university. \"He doesn't want a team of carbon copies. It is open to people with ideas.\"\n\nSome Tories will snort with derision on reading that.\n\n\"I have known him for 25 years and there is a sense that there is a small part of him you can't reach. I think you need that to be able to succeed under the pressures of public life,\" says Feldman. \"He is slightly detached even with his really good friends,\" says another person close to him. \"People say he's cold,\" says another – \"though he's very emotional he doesn't open up.\"\n\nThat can feed stubbornness and a kind of sang-froid. Cameron waited against all advice until this year before asking Lord Ashcroft to reveal his tax status – a mistake, he now says. Both the error and the admission are telling of the leader's character. So was his blunt reaction to his Ulster Unionist allies' near-derailing of devolution as \"a squeaky bum moment\".\n\n\"He is quite capable of taking a step back into his own space,\" says a friend. What fills that space? He is \"the classic rooted Tory politician who stands for family, community and country,\" says one friend – \"but on to that you have to bolt the life-changing experience he had with Ivan\" – the short life of his disabled son having a deep impact. \"I am an instinctive libertarian who abhors state prohibitions and tends to be sceptical of most government action,\" Cameron wrote in a diary for the Guardian. \"Raise any issue and I can predict Cameron's thought processes,\" says a friend. \"Will it work? What will it cost? Should government be doing it at all?\"\n\nFrom that flows his Euroscepticism, his most rigid view, and diversion from the One Nation Tory generation. He isn't an obsessive and he doesn't intend a Tory government to be shaped by the issue. This is a deferment of conflict, not a change of world view. His European policy will attempt to build relations with leaders, not institutions, and he has worked hard to win their affections. Withdrawal from the European people's party – and alliance with what Nick Clegg last week called the \"nutters\" – set that back, though Cameron bristles when his new allies are described as homophobic and antisemitic.\n\n\"He is not a neoconservative,\" says one shadow cabinet member. \"He has a classic 18th century suspicion of foreign entanglements.\" His claim to have backed the Iraq war reluctantly is supported by articles written for the Guardian at the time: \"[I] have distinctly dovish tendencies.\" He wrote he would vote for war \"grudgingly, unhappily, unenthusiastically.\" George Osborne persuaded him to do so.\n\nCameron, says one of his team, wants to be a domestic prime minister. He \"comes alive when he talks about social issues\". \"He has a passion for self-confident 'get government off my back' public servants – good headteachers, army officers, social entrepreneurs\". The model of such self-help is Balsall Heath in Birmingham, which he has visited repeatedly: he sees it as microcosm of Conservative policy to come.\n\nEducation is Cameron's chosen testing ground: it was the job he picked when Michael Howard offered him any shadow cabinet post. \"He cares about economic policy, and sees it as the key to the social reform he also wants to achieve,\" says Feldman – nobody suggests it is his primary interest – though one colleague adds \"he totally gets numbers, he worked at the Treasury, he can more than hold his own\".\n\n\"The phrase that totally captures Dave,\" says one colleague, \"is 'quietly effective'.\" The Cameron camp insist he is contemptuous of the showmanship of opposition. They would say that, of course, and it doesn't look true to outsiders: the bike-riding, husky-chasing PR man has been on show for five years.\n\nShould we see him differently – a man who would rather take a series of sensible middling decisions than launch a crusade? Rhetoric falls awkwardly from his lips. Colleagues describe someone who refers constantly to his constituency for examples of government ineffectiveness, who wants parliamentary reform of a traditional sort – backing the Wright reforms on Commons independence, to the irritation of Tory whips – and who is \"at his most impressive chairing policy meetings\". His favourite criticism, they even claim, is \"that's a bit of a gimmick\".\n\nThis is an authentic part of Cameron's character, but not all of it and not the one the public knows. His views may be straight down the middle. His leadership has presented him as radical. Perhaps that was unavoidable – the only way to detoxify the Tory brand. But in an anti-politics age it costs his party too.\n\nHow might he cope with defeat? \"He thinks he is going to win,\" says a friend. \"Maybe if he doesn't the blow will be all the greater. He would feel guilt, that he had let a lot of people down. He would head to the pub in Chipping Norton, drink pints of Old Speckled Hen, feel desperate for a weekend, come back on Monday, say Labour have created this mess and are about to make it worse, let's get back up and fight.\"\n\nBut the Tory party, after losing the unloseable election, might not let him. And one old friend wonders if he might just walk away. \"There is an element of the aristocrat to him, risking it all on the throw of a dice.\""
