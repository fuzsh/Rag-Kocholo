        "text": "David Cameron openly adopted the mantle of a Blairite public service reformer yesterday by saying the coalition's determination to grasp a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to push plans for health and education were based on Blair's view that he should have gone further, faster in reforming public services.\n\nThe prime minister was making a speech in London setting out his plan for public services before Wednesday's increasingly contentious health bill and next week's education bill extending school academies.\n\nFaced with growing alarm from professionals at the pace of public sector reform, especially in the NHS, Cameron repeatedly argued that he had no choice. He urged those warning of NHS privatisation to grow up, and recognise that the public did not care about whether an NHS provider was public, private or charitable so long as the NHS was free at the point of care.\n\nCameron withdrew a previous claim on BBC radio that the NHS was second rate but claimed that many health unions felt they had a duty to protest, while not disagreeing with the reforms in their hearts.\n\nThe prime minister's aides have become increasingly aware that health reform, due to come on stream in 2013, could prove to be as controversial by the next election as the spending cuts programme. The vast reform plan comes at the same time as NHS managers face demands to save £20bn over four years.\n\nCameron is also having to fight a growing perception that the Tories have broken a promise not to impose another unnecessary ideologically driven structural reform on the NHS.\n\nAs a result, he is facing calls from health experts to do more to pilot the reforms, rather than impose a big bang that will see GPs take control of commissioning and the role of the private sector provider greatly extended.\n\nLabour is said to be picking up soundings that concern over the NHS is one of the issues increasing driving voter disapproval of the coalition.\n\nEven the business secretary, Vince Cable, has described the scale of the reforms in private conversation as Maoist, and expressed fears that \"we are trying to do too many things\".\n\nCameron, however, argued: \"Every year we delay without improving our schools is another year of children let down, another year our health outcomes lag behind the rest of Europe, another year that trust and confidence in law and order erodes. These reforms are not about ideology – they are about people's lives.\"\n\nHe argued he was offering a blend between Conservative emphasis on competition and Labour emphasis on state-driven targets.\n\nHe said Blair had taught him \"the longer you leave things, the greater the institutional inertia against change becomes\".\n\nSharing an analysis held by Tory thinkers Oliver Letwin and Michael Gove, he said: \"Tony Blair as good as admits that he wasted his first term flogging the horse of centralised control.\n\n\"He only came later to real modernisation with an agenda that promoted choice and competition.\n\n\"Reading his intriguing memoir over the summer, I was struck by how many times he himself admits that opportunities were lost and Labour should have 'pushed further and faster on reform'.\"\n\nHe said Blair had been held back by Gordon Brown, a sceptical Whitehall machine and entrenched union interests.\n\nHe recognised many will be \"rolling their eyes\" at the prospect of another government promising to reform public service and claimed he was determined to learn the lessons from Labour's failures, as well as the Conservatives' own error in failing to recognise the importance of public service ethos as well.\n\nCameron's reliance on Blair also extended to using the word modernisation repeatedly as opposed to reorganisation or reform.\n\nBlairites broadly support the coaliiton's school reforms but are sceptical about whether the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, has thought through his reforms, including issues of political accountability, the capacity of GPs to undertake this scale of commissioning, and the mechanisms by which failure will be managed.\n\nCameron said his changes were not another pointless reorganisation of the past, but a different kind of reorganisation: from the bottom up, not top down\n\nHe said there was \"no point pretending that there is some 'easy option' of sticking with the status quo and hoping that a little bit of extra money will smooth over the challenges\".\n\n\"We need modernisation – on both sides of the equation. Modernisation to do something about the demand for healthcare – which is about public health.\n\n\"Modernisation to make the supply of healthcare more efficient – which is about opening up the system, being competitive and cutting out waste and bureaucracy.\n\nThere is also alarm in some Tory and Liberal Democrat circles that the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, has turned into a revolutionary reformer when it had been expected that schools, not health, would the single area of rapid reform.\n\nBut Cameron said the reforms were being introduced steadily.\n\n\"We are not asking GPs to take on new responsibilities for two years,\" he said, adding GPs were backing the reforms by applying to be commissioners.\n\nHe said that 140 GP-led consortiums had come forward – covering half the country – using new powers to take control of NHS\n\nAlthough the scrapping of primary care trusts had not been in the manifesto or the coalition programme, Downing Street argues it just became clear as the logic of the reforms were considered that no reason existed to avoid pressing on with the plan.\n\nCameron argued in his speech that the coalition government had made the changes easier: \"Instead of arguing about tribal dividing lines or sticking to long-cherished shibboleths, what we have is proper discussion about what works.\""
