        "text": "London - 8 May 2015 (SOUNDBITE) (English) BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON, SAYING: “I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen and I will now form a majority Conservative government. I have been proud to lead the first coalition government in 70 years and I want to thank all those who worked so hard to make it a success. And in particular on this day, Nick Clegg. Elections can be bruising clashes of ideas and arguments and a lot of people who believe profoundly in public service have seen that public service cut short. Ed Miliband rang me this morning to wish me luck with the new government, it was a typically generous gesture from someone who is clearly in public service for all the right reasons.” // “And yes, we will deliver that in out referendum on our future in Europe. As we conduct this vital work we must ensure that we bring our country together. As I said in the small hours of this morning, we will govern as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom.” // “In this parliament, I will stay true to my word and implement as fast as I can the devolution that all parties agreed for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.” //c “We can take these islands, with our proud history and build an even prouder future. Together we can make Great Britain even greater still. Thankyou.”"
