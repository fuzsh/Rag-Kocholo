        "text": "David Cameron is to revive a tradition championed by Margaret Thatcher and John Major by revamping the government whips' office to give it greater authority over the parliamentary party.\n\nIn one of the major elements of next month's ministerial reshuffle – which will also see the return of the Liberal Democrat David Laws to the government – the prime minister is to heed the advice of party elders and clear out much of the current whips' office to make it a training ground for future cabinet ministers.\n\nCameron held preliminary consultations with aides in Downing Street this week before resuming his holiday in Cornwall on Saturday. He will embark on his first substantial ministerial reshuffle early next month. It is likely to entail the departure of a handful of cabinet ministers, notably the Welsh secretary, Cheryl Gillan and the leader of the Commons, Sir George Young.\n\nThe changes are likely to see the end of Patrick McLoughlin as chief whip. He is expected to leave the cabinet, which he attends as a non-voting member. It is understood that if McLoughlin goes it will be of his own volition. Former miner McLoughlin has served continuously in the Tory whips' office for 17 years, and is held in high personal regard by the prime minister.\n\nCaroline Spelman, the environment secretary, is seen as vulnerable, though she may hold on for another year. Baroness Warsi is facing an intense campaign for her removal as Tory co-chair. If she leaves that post she is expected to remain in the cabinet in another role.\n\nChris Grayling, the employment minister who missed out on a cabinet place after the formation of the coalition, is expected to be promoted. Maria Miller, the minister for disabled people, who was brought up in south Wales, is being lined up to replace Gillan. Michael Fallon, the Tory deputy chairman, is expected to be rewarded for his work fire-fighting on behalf of the government on the airwaves with a promotion to chief whip, party chairman or leader of the house.\n\nThere are expected to be changes within the cabinet. Kenneth Clarke is fighting hard to avoid a demotion from justice secretary to replace Young as leader of the Commons. Jeremy Hunt is widely expected to be moved from his post as culture secretary.\n\nThe reshuffle will mainly focus on the Tories, with few Liberal Democrat ministers. Laws, who left the government under a cloud after a row about his expenses just 17 days after the coalition was formed, will, however, return to ministerial office.\n\nThe prime minister is running the reshuffle in a tight four-strong unit. Other members include George Osborne, the No 10 chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, and Llewellyn's deputy, Kate Fall. William Hague, the foreign secretary, and McLoughlin are also being consulted. Nick Clegg has a free hand over Liberal Democrat appointments and will be consulted on Tory changes.\n\nSenior government sources say there will be significant cabinet changes. \"This will not be tinkering,\" one source said.\n\nBut the prime minister is understood to have no current plans to replace or move any of the cabinet's heavy hitters: Osborne, Hague and the home secretary, Theresa May. Cameron is resisting calls on his benches to remove Osborne as chancellor and either appoint him party chair or ask him to swap with Hague.\n\nTory MPs are becoming increasingly critical of Osborne, who is struggling to explain how he is fulfilling his two main pledges: the elimination of the structural budget deficit before the next general election and an economic recovery led by a revived private sector. One normally loyal Tory said: \"George Osborne embodies the privilege and complacency of this government. He is not the right person to say we are all in this together. He is the little lord of privilege. If the prime minister does not replace him he is only delaying the inevitable by a year.\"\n\nThe prime minister has accepted the advice of party elders who believe he has fallen into the same trap as Tony Blair by underestimating the importance of the whips' office. Cameron, who made a point of hugging McLoughlin at the last meeting of the 1922 Committee, is not critical of his chief whip, who is seen as having done a difficult job in trying circumstances as Tory MPs showed their unease at the coalition by rebelling against the government.\n\nIt is understood that Cameron now agrees that the whips' office will have a greater chance of asserting authority over troublesome MPs, particularly the 2010 intake, if it combines two sorts of MPs: respected older figures and newcomers destined for the cabinet.\n\nOne government figure said: \"There is a desire to turn the whips' office back to what it used to be under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. It will be turned into an office that combines experienced MPs who are never likely to be ministers but who provide ballast with the other half drawn from the ranks of young MPs who are heading up the ranks.\n\n\"It will be a bit like a business management college for the younger whips. They will learn a hell of a lot about business management, parliamentary procedure. The whips' office produces a group cohesion – once a whip, always a whip – and teaches you about the realities of life.\"\n\nThe old guard are lobbying Downing Street to send the likes of Matthew Hancock, Osborne's former chief of staff, and Nick Boles, the polished policy wonk, to be trained under the influence of senior figures in the whips' office. \"From behind the arras Matt Hancock will don some form of official gold braid,\" one source said.\n\nThe presence of such high flyers would revive memories of Lord Wakeham, Thatcher's legendary chief whip, who famously said that he expected his junior whips to be in the cabinet within 10 years. One of his charges exceeded this target. Major made the cabinet in 1987, four years after his appointment as a whip and became prime minister in 1990, seven years after joining Wakeham's whips' office.\n\nSome of the current whips will prosper in the reshuffle. There is strong pressure for the prime minister to appoint the popular Philip Dunne, a successful businessman, to the Treasury or the business department. But others, such as Michael Fabricant, are expected to head to the back benches."
