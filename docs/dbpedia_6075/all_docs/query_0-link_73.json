        "text": "At a minute past six o’clock the Downing Street gates groaned open and a greyish Jaguar delivered Robert Walpole’s latest successor towards power’s base camp: No 10, home to so many dreams and broken destinies.\n\nTheresa May approached it with a slow, wary tread. She had just been invited by the Queen to form a new government. She had accepted.\n\nBefore stepping inside with her slight-built husband Philip, she made a brief, one-nation Tory speech. It talked of the poor and oppressed – black people treated harshly by the criminal justice system, white working-class boys left to stew by schools.\n\nHer political pitch was to the just-about-coping classes, folk struggling to make ends meet.\n\nHer outfit? Yellow on black – the colours of an industrious bee. Her chunky-linked, silvery necklace reflected the TV lights.\n\nOverhead a military Chinook choppered, making the air shudder. Mrs May’s words were audible to the TV audience but almost lost to those of us in the street. Around her? All the panoply of top-level life: a crackle of radio static, security guys with wire sprouting from their ears, the ceaseless shuttering of camera lenses.\n\nFrom the end of the street rose a chant of protesters. ‘What do we want? Brexit! When do we want it? Now!’ That, more than soft-focus stuff about the underprivileged, may prove her most pressing imperative.\n\nAnd then she reached a passage about ‘a bold new, positive world’ and the evening sun chose that moment to shine from the west. Perfect timing. Philip May must have been almost blinded by the light. The Mays turned and stood together outside the black door. Did they seem a little stiff and nervous? Who could blame them? After a prolonged pose of waving they went inside and we could hear No 10’s staff applaud.\n\nThe Camerons had left barely an hour earlier. Samantha’s scent must still have lingered in the corridors. The departing PM had made a long goodbye speech notable chiefly for the gorgeousness of his children behind him. Dear little Florence, aged five, buried her head in Mummy’s jazz-patterned skirt. Mr Cameron called Samantha ‘the love of my life’. And then – pouff! – the Camerons were toast. C’est la vie politique Britannique.\n\nEarlier, Mr Cameron took his leave of the despatch box with the magisterial ease he so often showed. Mrs May arrived at 11.53am, accompanied by her limpet Michael Ellis (Northampton N, and Keeper of Theresa’s Handbag). Strong cheers from the Tory benches and a quick rearrangement of the packed Tory front bench.\n\nCabinet ministers Greg Clark and Jeremy Wright were both booted off it to make room. Tory Whip David Evennett gesticulated like a frantic maitre d’ as he reorganised the placements.\n\nMr Cameron arrived with George Osborne at 11.55. Even bigger cheers from the Tories.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair left office there was the salty tang of disloyalty on the breeze, both having been undone by their colleagues. Mr Cameron was undone by the electorate in a referendum which saw most MPs support his pro-EU stance.\n\nMr Cameron, public schoolboy that he once was, took his beating like a man. And yesterday he was pure style. A self-effacing jest here. A jab at the Opposition there. Self-pity was absent from his performance, though there was a suggestion of a tremor in his voice in the final Commons moments.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, never exactly fluent, showed some grace and humour – more so than the Scots Nats, who sat like so many crosspatches, determined to scowl. Ah, sun-kissed Caledonia! Mr Cameron playfully compared Mr Corbyn to the Black Knight in Monty Python, insisting ‘it’s only a flesh wound!’ even when reduced to a few stumps. The House enjoyed that, particularly on the Labour side.\n\nThe soon to be ex-PM also recalled a time in New York when no one recognised him until a passer-by said: ‘Hey, Cameron, Prime Minister’s Questions – love your show!’ (For this Mr Cameron adopted a fair American accent.)\n\nThe best tributes came from senior Tories Peter Lilley (‘He commands the respect of friend and foe alike, who know that he is driven not just by legitimate political ambitions and ideas but by a sense of duty,’ said Mr Lilley) and Ken Clarke, who urged Mr Cameron to remain an MP. Though he agreed to do so, a valedictory peroration was required. It was duly supplied. ‘I will miss the roar of the crowd and the barbs from the Opposition but I will be willing you on.’ By ‘you’ he meant Parliament in all its bloody-minded, leader-scourging glory. His final parliamentary words as PM: ‘I was the future once.’\n\nUp leapt the Tories to applaud and cheer. Labour MPs clapped. Mr Corbyn hastened to the back of the Chair to pump Mr Cameron’s hand as he left. The Scots Nats? Miserable beggars, they sat on their hands, four rows of cheerless grizzle.\n\nAs the House emptied, the Clerk announced a date for the first reading of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847 (Amendment) Bill. It was a reminder, as dusk later fell on Westminster after this extraordinary fortnight, that life continues. The globe still turns. A Prime Minister has gone. Long live the Prime Minister.\n\n'I was the future once': Wise-cracking Cameron enjoys a raucous final PMQs as he pays tribute to his 'amazing' wife and leaves Commons to a standing ovation before resigning to the Queen\n\nBy James Tapsfield, Political Editor, Tim Sculthorpe, Deputy Political Editor and Matt Dathan, Political Correspondent for MailOnline\n\nDavid Cameron paid tribute to his 'amazing' wife Samatha and joked that his diary was 'remarkably light' today as he was given a standing ovation at his final PMQs today.\n\nIn a wise-cracking and sometimes emotional swansong at the Commons despatch box, the Prime Minister said he would miss 'the roar of the crowd' as he was cheered to the rafters by Tory MPs.\n\nSamantha and their children watched the scenes with from the public gallery as glowing tributes were paid to his 'public service' and achievements in office.\n\nTory MPs gave him a rare standing ovation at the end of his performance as did some Labour MPs - but Jeremy Corbyn and most of his frontbench remained stubbornly in their seats.\n\nMr Cameron has been jousting at the regular clashes since becoming Conservative leader in 2005, when he first lined up against Tony Blair.\n\nAs the session kicked off, Mr Cameron as usual gave details of his engagements for the day, but joked: ‘Other than one meeting this afternoon with Her Majesty the Queen, the diary for the rest of my day is remarkably light.'\n\nAsking the first question, Ulster Unionist MP Danny Kinahan paid tribute to the outgoing PM and suggested he might want to look at the vacancies for presenter of the BBC's Top Gear, the England football team or US president.\n\nThe MP said: ‘I’m told there are lots of leadership roles out there at the moment, there’s the England football team, there’s Top Gear, there’s even across the Big Pond a role that needs filling.'\n\nMr Cameron thanked him for the ‘fascinating suggestions for future jobs’ but added: ‘Most of which sound even harder than this one so I think I’ll pass.’\n\nLabour MPs sat in silence as Jeremy Corbyn, who is facing a major rebellion, rose to pay tribute to Mr Cameron.\n\nBut Mr Cameron could not resist responding with a jibe about Labour's failure to get a woman Prime Minister elected.\n\n'When it comes to women prime ministers it’s two nil – and not a pink bus in sight,' he said.\n\nThe PM launched a series of parting shots at Mr Corbyn, likening him to the knight from Monty Python's Holy Grail film who has limbs chopped off but dismisses the injuries as a 'flesh wound'.\n\nMr Cameron addressed a topic of much discussion this week – whether the 10 Downing Street cat Larry would be moving with the Camerons.\n\nHe told MPs: ‘The rumour that somehow I don't love Larry, I do... I can't take Larry with me, he belongs to the house and the staff love him very much, as do I.’\n\nMr Corbyn used his last question to wish Mr Cameron and his family well, as well as attempting to make a joke about the outgoing PM filling a new vacancy on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nHe told Mr Cameron: ‘Could I just put on record and wish him well as he leaves this office and also to wish his family well...\n\n'It’s the loved ones nearest to us and our families that actually make enormous sacrifices.\n\n'I’d also like him to pass on to his mum my thanks on ties and suits and songs...\n\n‘There’s a rumour going round that his departure has been carefully choreographed so he can slip seamlessly into the vacancy created this morning by Len Goodman’s departure.\n\n'Can he confirm if that is correct?’\n\nMr Cameron said it was right to reflect on the burden carried by politicians' families, praising his 'amazing wife Sam and my lovely children'. Mrs Cameron, 12-year-old Nancy, Elwen, nine, and five-year-old Florence were watching from the public gallery throughout his 40 minute swansong at the Commons Despatch Box.\n\nThe family later returned to Downing Street for the final hours before Mr Cameron heads to the Palace to officially tender his resignation.\n\nMr Cameron mocked the Labour party’s current chaos in response to Mr Corbyn accusing him of failing to eradicate poverty.\n\nThe outgoing PM said: ‘To be accused of slow-thin delivery by the right honourable gentleman, let’s just take the last week – we’ve both been having these leadership elections.\n\n‘We got on with it, we’ve had resignation, nomination, competition and coronation; they haven’t even decided what the rules are yet.\n\n‘If they ever got in to power it would take them about a year to work out who sits where.’\n\nMr Corbyn, fresh from his party’s decision to allow him to automatically get on the ballot paper for its leadership election, replied: ‘Democracy is an exciting and splendid thing and I’m enjoying every moment of it.’\n\nMr Cameron also took the opportunity to mock Mr Corbyn’s style of asking questions from emails he receives from the general public.\n\n‘I’m glad he mentions emails because actually I’ve got an email as well.’ Mr Cameron said.\n\n‘Now, I got this on the 16 September 2015 from someone called Judith and she said this: “Please, please keep dignity and not triumphalism in the first PMQs today with Jeremy Corbyn. And she gave this reason.\n\n'She said, \"Because Tom Watson who may oust Jeremy Corbyn is a very different kettle of fish, he's experienced, organised and far more dangerous in the long term.\n\n'She goes on: \"So sensible, sober, polite answers to Mr Corbyn - let him create his own party disunity.\" - After this is over, I've got to find Judith and find out what on earth happens next.’\n\nMr Corbyn used his last question to joke about Mr Cameron’s jibe at his scruffy dress sense in an exchange earlier this year – when the PM said his mother would tell the Labour leader to ‘put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem’.\n\nAnd wishing the Cameron family well, Mr Corbyn said: ‘Before I ask him the last question could I just put on record and wish him well as he leaves this office and also to wish his family well – Samantha and their children because I think we should all recognise that whilst many of us do enjoy our jobs and our political life, it’s the loved ones nearest to us and our families that actually make enormous sacrifices that enables us to do this.\n\nMr Corbyn joked: ‘I’d also like him to pass on my thanks to his mum for her advice about ties and suits and songs.\n\n‘It’s extremely kind of her and I’d be grateful if he could pass that on to her personally and I’m reflecting on the lesson she offered.\n\n‘But I’ve got one rumour that I’d like him to deal with. There’s a rumour going round that his departure has been carefully choreographed so he can slip seamlessly into the vacancy created this morning on Strictly by Len Goodman’s departure. Is that his next career?\n\nSadly Mr Cameron immediately ruled out taking the job, saying: ‘I don’t really have a paso doble so I can promise that’s not the case.’\n\nHe promised to pass his thanks onto his mother and praises Mr Corbyn for ‘taking her advice and looking absolutely splendid today’.\n\nReflecting on his time at the top, Mr Cameron said: ‘I will watch these exchanges from the backbenches. I will miss the roar of the crowd, I will miss the barbs from the Opposition but I will be willing you on and when I meant willing you on I don’t just mean willing on the new Prime Minister at this despatch box or indeed or just willing on the frontbench defending the manifesto that I helped to put together.I mean willing you all on because people come here with huge passion – the issues they care about.\n\n'They come here with great love for the constituencies they represent.\n\n'And also willing on this place, because yes we can be pretty tough and test and challenge our leaders – perhaps more than some other countries but that is something we should be proud of and we should keep at it. And I hope you will all keep at it and I will will you on as you do.\n\n‘The last thing I’d say is you can achieve a lot of things in politics, you can get a lot of things done and that in the end – the public service, the national interest – is what it’s all about.'\n\nIn a reference to his memorable jibe at Tony Blair in his first PMQs appearance in 2005, Mr Cameron said: ‘Nothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it. After all – as I once said – I was the future once.’\n\nTory MPs roared again as Cameron mocked the Labour leader for his own woes. And even Labour MPs cracked a smile as Mr Corbyn challenged Mr Cameron on poor employers to deafening shouts.\n\nWhen Jeremy Corbyn asked his 180th and last question, he won laughs from the Cameron family in the gallery as he paid a warm tribute to the Prime Minister and his family.\n\nAs Mr Cameron urged MPs to 'keep at it' and quipped that he 'had been the future once', Tory MPs exploded into a standing ovation. They were, eventually, joined by some on the Labour benches, with Kate Hoey, Stephen Pound, Chris Evans and Robert Flello among the first to rise.\n\nThey were joined unionist MPs from Northern Ireland and the Liberal Democrats - including leader Tim Farron who had strained to ask a question but was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nThe PM is returning to No 10 after the midday clash over the Despatch Box to say his goodbyes to staff and continue packing to leave.\n\nAnd then later this afternoon, he will emerge from behind the famous black door one last time as Prime Minister to make the short journey to Buckingham Palace.\n\nHe is expected to make a statement in Downing Street highlighting how he has overseen Britain's economic recovery, before heading to see the Queen and offer his resignation.\n\nMrs May will be installed in No 10 as Britain's new Prime Minister by this evening.\n\nMr Cameron told this morning's The Daily Telegraph it had been 'a privilege to serve the country I love'.\n\n'I came into Downing Street to confront our problems as a country and lead people through difficult decisions so we could reach better times,' he said.\n\n'As I leave, I hope people will see a stronger country, a thriving economy, and more chances to get on in life. It has been a privilege to serve the country I love.'\n\nOnce Mr Cameron has resigned, Mrs May will be summoned to have an audience with the Queen, when she accepts the monarch's offer to form a new government and will, in keeping with tradition, 'kiss hands' with the head of state.\n\nShe will return to No 10 as the country's second female prime minister.\n\nLabour's shadow minister without portfolio Jon Ashworth said: 'As David Cameron prepares to leave Downing Street we wish him and his family well.\n\n'But we must also acknowledge that despite all his promises he leaves the country in a state of insecurity and huge economic uncertainty.\n\n'Theresa May will inherit a Government that remains committed to a failed and unfair policy agenda and which has refused to stand up for working people.\n\n'Her record is the same as the Tories' failed record and the country deserves better.'\n\nRemoval vans were seen on Tuesday as Mr Cameron, wife Samantha and children Nancy, Arthur and Florence, packed up at their home since 2010 and prepared to return to a life outside the gates to Downing Street.\n\nTaking his last Cabinet meeting, the outgoing PM spoke of his 'honour and pleasure' at having served for six years and told colleagues Mrs May was 'the right person to lead the country wisely through the difficult times ahead'.\n\nAlthough a Remain supporter, Mrs May has repeatedly stressed that 'Brexit means Brexit' and the hunt for a building to house the department that will steer Britain out of the European Union is already under way.\n\nAfter presenting herself as the unity candidate, the incoming leader is expected to offer plum posts to leading figures from both camps in the EU referendum.\n\nMr Osborne looks unlikely to stay on as Chancellor after the PM-to-be trashed parts of his economic legacy in a campaign speech on Monday, with Philip Hammond, who has long coveted the role at the Treasury, among those who could take over.\n\nSenior Brexiteer Chris Grayling will be rewarded for his role running Mrs May's campaign.\n\nAndrea Leadsom, whose shock withdrawal from the leadership race meant the expected nine-week leadership campaign was truncated to just a couple of days, is expected to be offered a job in recognition of her raised profile.\n\nBig question marks are hanging over the future of Brexit standard-bearers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, who were seen to have blotted their copy-books in the wake of the referendum result.\n\nMrs May, a founder of the Women2Win group to increase the number of female MPs, is keen to see more women in 'prominent' roles.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mrs May said: 'Civil servants have already been charged with finding a building to house the Brexit department - an indication of Theresa's commitment to get on with delivering the verdict of EU referendum. Brexit means Brexit and we're going to make a success of it.'\n\nThey added: 'It was Theresa that set up the campaign to elect more female MPs to parliament - and she has always believed that there should be more women in prominent government positions.'\n\n'Calm down, dear!' David Cameron's most memorable moments from more than a decade of House of Commons clashes\n\nDavid Cameron is widely regarded as the best House of Commons performer of his generation - and opponents have rarely managed to lay a glove on him.\n\nOn becoming Tory leader he promised to end the 'punch and judy' politics of Westminster, saying he was fed up with the 'name calling, backbiting, point scoring'.\n\nBut it was in the rough and tumble of the House where he really excelled, always ready with a sharp put down and generally able to bluster his way through even the most uncomfortable of political situations.\n\nIn fact the most regular criticism of Mr Cameron was that he was too harsh on his Labour foes - with many likening him to fictional anti-hero Flashman.\n\nFlashman originally featured as the public school bully who made Tom Brown's life hell in Thomas Hughes' 19th century novel.\n\nGeorge MacDonald Fraser later reimagined the character after his expulsion from Rugby, writing a hugely successful series of books about how the cowardly sex pest turned into a Victorian war hero.\n\nApart from his verbal sparring skills, Mr Cameron also excelled at the sombre occasions of parliament.\n\nHis response to the Bloody Sunday inquiry was particularly highly praised.\n\nBut Mr Cameron has also had his fair share of setbacks - including dramatically losing a vote that would have authorised airstrikes against Syria in 2013.\n\nHere are some of the outgoing Prime Minister's key moments from the past 11 years.\n\n'You were the future once'\n\nTony Blair had dominated parliament for a decade when Mr Cameron became Conservative leader in 2005.\n\nBut Mr Cameron laid down a marker during their first clash at the despatch box, saying: 'It is only our first exchange and already the PM is asking me the questions.\n\n'This approach is stuck in the past and I want to talk about the future. He was the future once.'\n\nEven the experienced Mr Blair could not hide how much it stung.\n\n'We do not defend the indefensible'\n\nDavid Cameron's ability to play his role as 'father of the nation' was widely seen as one of his greatest strengths as Prime Minister – and it was never more on display than the day he responded to the Bloody Sunday Inquiry on June 15, 2010.\n\nMaking a fulsome apology at the Commons Despatch box almost 40 years after the shootings following the publication of the Saville Inquiry, Mr Cameron said the killings were 'unjustified and unjustifiable'.\n\nThe Prime Minister said he was 'deeply sorry' for the actions of British troops in a major statement that was heard by MPs in absolute silence.\n\nHe told MPs: 'You do not defend the British Army by defending the indefensible… what happened should never, ever happened.'\n\n'Son of Brown'\n\nMost of Mr Cameron's Commons duels after becoming PM were against Ed Miliband.\n\nIn one of their early encounters in December 2010, the Labour leader jibed that the Tory leadership regarded themselves as 'children of Thatcher'.\n\nBut the PM hit back with a bruising reference to Mr Miliband's close links to Gordon Brown.\n\n'I would rather be a child of Thatcher than a son of Brown,' he said.\n\n'Knifing a foreign secretary'\n\nIn another hammering put-down, Mr Cameron took aim at Mr Miliband for betraying his brother David to win Labour's top job.\n\n'There's only one person i can remember knifing a foreign secretary, and I'm looking at him!' he said.\n\nMr Miliband responded: 'Flashman is back.'\n\n'Calm down, dear'\n\nIn April 2011, Mr Cameron came under fire after urging Labour front bencher Angela Eagle to 'calm down, dear' during a rowdy Commons session.\n\nDowning Street insisted the PM had merely been borrowing the catchphrase from insurance adverts fronted by film director Michael Winner.\n\nMs Eagle said 'a modern man' would not have 'expressed himself that way'.\n\nBut spokesman for Mr Cameron said it was just 'a humorous remark'.\n\n'I get that and will act accordingly'\n\nOne of Mr Cameron's lowest moments in office came in August 2013, when he was humiliated by losing a crucial vote on taking military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nHe had urged MPs to back his call for a military response in Syria after suspected chemical weapons attacks on the outskirts of the capital Damascus as Assad brutally attacked his own citizens two years into the bloody civil war.\n\nBut Mr Cameron, who had recalled MPs a week early from their summer recess - was left defeated in a late-night vote in the House of Commons, losing by a narrow seven votes.\n\nThe Prime Minister, who was visibly angry and disappointed at losing the vote, said: 'It is clear to me that the British parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action.\n\n'I get that and will act accordingly.'\n\nBut for the next three years he worked towards winning a vote on taking military action in Syria, finally winning a vote to launch air strikes against ISIS targets in the country at the end of 2015.\n\nThe opposition may have changed since the 2013 vote, but no longer was the UK abstaining from military action in Syria.\n\n'The most annoying man in politics'\n\nMr Cameron did not face off directly with shadow chancellor Ed Balls in the Commons.\n\nBut some of his most memorable moments came when he targeted Mr Balls as part of a long-running fued.\n\nIn March 2011 he broke off from answering a routine question about regeneration to comment: 'I may be alone in finding him the most annoying person in modern politics.'\n\nMr Balls responded by holding out a glass of water.\n\nIn December 2013, he ridiculed Mr Balls for his expansive hand gestures during PMQs, which included a 'calm down' wave.\n\n'After the briefings today I would have thought the only hand gesture should be bye bye,' Mr Cameron said.\n\nHe added that Mr Miliband should not need it to be Christmas to realise he was 'sitting next to a Turkey.'\n\nMr Cameron later said he thought he had been 'dreaming' when Mr Balls humiliatingly lost his seat at the 2015 general election.\n\n'Do up your tie and sing the national anthem'\n\nIn one of the more memorable exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron gave his opposite number Jeremy Corbyn wardrobe advice.\n\nHe told the famously scruffy Labour leader to 'put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem'.\n\nIt came after a bizarre exchange involving both the leaders' mothers, with Mr Corbyn telling the PM: 'My late mother would have said, \"stand up for the principle of a health service free at the point of use for everybody\".\n\nIt gave Mr Cameron the opportunity to give his own mother's advice, telling Mr Corbyn that his mother would criticise his shabby dress sense.\n\n'For heaven's sake man, go'\n\nDespite having lost the referendum and announced his own resignation, Mr Cameron was able to turn the Commons to his advantage anyway.\n\nAs Jeremy Corbyn's front bench team collapsed around him an unprecedented cascade of resignations, the Premier wound up a damning attack on his rival just six days after his ballot box humiliation."
