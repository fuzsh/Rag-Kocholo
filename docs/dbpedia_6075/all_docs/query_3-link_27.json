        "text": "Role-play the Parliament: House of Representatives\n\nThis video demonstrates a parliamentary role-play, where students can learn how new laws are made in the Australian Parliament. It outlines what content is covered in the lesson, and what preparation is required to use this immersive learning strategy in a classroom.\n\nDuration: 14 min 35 sec\n\nRead the transcript.\n\nPreparing to make a law\n\nTopic for debate\n\nChoose an issue relevant to your students and to the curriculum, such as the amount of homework students are required to do. If you'd like to see the kinds of issues the Parliament has been discussing recently, have a look at Hansard or current media. If you're stuck for ideas, use one of our scripts in the toolkit.\n\nWith students, develop a plan to address the issue, for example, to ban homework. This plan will be your bill.\n\nWrite the name of the bill and its purpose on page one of the law-making script template, available in the toolkit. For example, The No Homework Bill: A Bill for an Act to ban homework in all Australian schools.\n\nTeams\n\nDivide the class into government, opposition, minor parties and independents.\n\nFor the current composition of the House of Representatives, visit Parliamentary statistics\n\nGovernment—more than half the students\n\nMinor party members and independents—2–3 students\n\nOpposition—remaining students.\n\nFrom the government, select:\n\na Prime Minister\n\na minister for the relevant portfolio to introduce the bill—for example, the Minister for Education\n\na Party Whip—team manager.\n\nFrom the opposition, select:\n\na Leader of the Opposition\n\na shadow minister for the same portfolio who will respond to the minister's speech\n\na Party Whip—team manager.\n\nThe leaders can be elected by their teams or you can choose.\n\nWrite speeches (optional)\n\nYou may want to give your students time to write speeches.\n\nGovernment members will support the bill\n\nOpposition members will disagree with the bill\n\nIndependents and minor party members can choose to support, oppose or suggest changes to the bill.\n\nIf you plan on using the same bill to debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate, you may choose to allow some students to make speeches in the House of Representatives and some in the Senate.\n\nSelect other roles\n\nChoose students for the following roles. These students may write speeches, but will not deliver them.\n\nSpeaker—a member of the government\n\nClerk—parliamentary staff\n\nSerjeant-At-Arms—parliamentary staff\n\nWhen selecting these roles, ensure the government still has a majority.\n\nSet up room\n\nTurn the classroom into the House of Representatives by arranging chairs and tables into a horseshoe shape as indicated by the seating plan in the toolkit.\n\nMaking a law\n\nYou can follow this process in the master script.\n\nThe Clerk rings the bell and instructs the members to stand.\n\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms leads the Speaker into the House, carrying the Mace on their right shoulder.\n\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms announces the Speaker, places the Mace on the table and moves to their seat.\n\nThe Speaker tells everyone to sit down and begins the session.\n\nThe Clerk stands and reads the rules of the House and the title of the bill (first reading).\n\nThe debate\n\nThe minister introduces the bill and the shadow minister responds to the bill.\n\nThe Speaker selects members to make speeches, alternating between government and non-government members.\n\nVoting on the bill\n\nWhen the debate is finished, the Speaker announces the vote. The independents and minor party members choose a side.\n\nThe whips count the number of people on their side and tell the Speaker. The Speaker declares the result.\n\nPassing the bill\n\nThe Clerk reads the title of the bill.\n\nThe Speaker adjourns the House.\n\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms takes the Mace and leads the Speaker from the House.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nDiscuss with the class what happened in your House of Representatives. For example, did the bill pass? Why?\n\nDiscuss what other steps the bill needs to go through to become a law.\n\nReflection\n\nAfter the debate, explore the following questions with your students:"
