        "text": "Union boss warned Brown: ‘You could be finished’\n\nGMB boss Paul Kenny tells a private meeting at the TUC conference that he warned Gordon Brown he would be finished as a political force if he followed the Conservative spending cuts agenda.\n\nHistoric poll data highlights gap between Brown and Cameron\n\nThe gap that has opened up between Gordon Brown’s approval ratings and David Cameron’s is among the biggest between any PM and opposition leader since 1983.\n\nYoung’s appointment shows Cameron’s pragmatism\n\nSir George Young’s promotion to shadow leader of the Commons shows is likely to reassure some of those in the Conservative party.\n\nCameronite guru Nassim Taleb answers your questions\n\n“David Cameron is the best thing we have left on this planet…the only hope left for a risk-conscious society,” was one of the more unexpected answers I got from Nassim Taleb. I was interviewing the Black Swan author for a report we are doing next week. But as a teaser I put a series of…\n\nMervyn’s money mania means Cameron need not worry – yet\n\nForget the voices suggesting interest rates might creep up in the near future. This morning revealed the reality that the Bank of England nearly voted for even more creation of its funny money.\n\nThe greenest revolution\n\nThe victory on the Champs Elysees by Britain’s Mark Cavendish in the final stage of the Tour de France, coupled with the amazing fourth place by Olympic gold medalist Bradley Wiggins seals a brilliant year for British cycling. it was a year that began with the record medals haul in Beijing last summer.\n\nVery big question marks against Andy Coulson’s future\n\nDavid Cameron believes that one of the high points of his leadership has been the “Flying Squad”/”Get Carter” way he dealt with Tory MPs’ expenses. He and his team believe this has won him points for “getting it” when it comes to the public distrust of politicians. Can he really afford to risk this right…\n\nNo bonfire from Cameron on quango reform\n\nI am in the Canary Wharf minimalist temple where Clifford Chance has its HQ listening to David Cameron’s speech on quango reform. He doesn’t want to promise the tired old “bonfire” cliche but he wants to make it clear he has something much bigger than an ashtray accident in mind. But you do come away…\n\nCabinet rows back on ‘cuts vs spending’ strategy\n\nCabinet this morning acknowledged that the “cuts versus spending” line of attack which Gordon Brown has been pounding out at top volume for weeks has been a bit of an own goal and ministers this morning talked about “refining” the message. The new mantra is supposed to be “more realistic”, I hear, with messages like…\n\nTotting up the Tories’ second job earnings\n\nDavid Cameron’s self-denying ordinance on Shadow Cabinet outside interests will look to many in his own party like a bit of tokenism. At his press conference this morning David Cameron made the argument FOR MPs having outside interests, even mentioned that he used to have some himself when he was Shadow Education spokesman. Then he…\n\nMandelson, the Lord High Executioner, on Royal Mail\n\nPeter Mandelson’s disclosure that there isn’t going to be a comprehensive spending review this side of a general election is a king-size clanger on the day the Prime Minister wanted to share his policy vision. (What Peter Mandelson actually said on the Today programme was: “The spending period currently operating in government stretches beyond the…\n\nCameron speaks on transparency – but show us the expenses!\n\nI am at David Cameron’s speech at Imperial College listening to a paen of praise to the virtues of transparency, free information, transparency and accountability but at time of writing we have not yet been given the new additional list of Tory MPs who have had to pay back another £125k between them. We will,…\n\nShooting across David’s bows\n\nTory Whips this afternoon texted MPs not to respond to press questions about the anonymous letter which Conservative Home got hold of today in which a Conservative MP appears to attack David Cameron as “Stalinist” and “despotic.”\n\nBrown apes Mrs Merton on constitutional reform\n\nThis was Gordon Brown in Mrs Merton mode – “let’s have a heated debate.” On electoral reform, there is nothing the government can do this side of a general election. The Prime Minister is effectively planning the next Labour general election manifesto in which a commitment to electoral reform, some type of additional vote system…"
