        "text": "Income limits are based upon figures provided by Florida Housing Finance Corporation (FHFC) and are subject to change. Updated schedules will be provided when changes occur. Rent limits are based on HUD recommended exception rent standard per 24 cfr 982.503.\n\nIncome Limits Income Limits by Number of Persons in Household\n\nArea Median Income (AMI) for Miami-Dade County: $74,700 Annual Income Percentage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Below or less than 80% $57,800 $66,050 $74,300 $82,550 $89,200 $95,800 $102,400 $109,000 Between 81% and 110% $79,464 $90,816 $102,168 $113,520 $122,602 $131,683 $140,765 $149,846 Between 121% to 140% AMI $101,220 $115,640 $130,060 $144,480 $156,100 $167,720 $179,200 $190,820\n\nMiami-Dade WHIP Rent Limits by Bedroom Size\n\nMiami-Dade WHIP Rent Limits by Bedroom Size 1 2 3 4 5 6 $1,855 $2,307 $3,036 $3,596 $4,136 $4,756\n\nPHCD has discretion to investigate income levels of tenants in the WHIP program. PHCD reserves the right to allow landlords to provide a letter attesting to the income level of the tenant, to ensure that the tenant’s income level meets the criteria of the program.\n\nMaximum Sales Price\n\nThe Maximum Sales Price for 2022 is $352,000.\n\nTo calculate the Maximum Sales Price (MSP), the County uses both the HOME Methodology and the U.S. Treasury Methodology and sets the MSP for its housing programs at whichever MSP is lower. Updates to the MSP will be provided when changes occur.\n\n*Applicants will be asked to submit unit eligibility documentation on an annual basis, which may include self-certification of tenant income, photo identification, proof of tenant income, or other documentation. Failure to provide requested documentation in a timely fashion may result in processing delays and/or rejection of the application.\n\nThe goal of a housing inspection for the WHIP Unit Conversion Component is to ensure units under the program are in a “decent, safe, and sanitary” condition. Properties participating in the program must meet quality standards set by PHCD. To verify this, PHCD will assign a Housing Inspector to inspect the facility. During a housing inspection, an inspector will assess the quality of the unit in 13 major areas of health, safety, and habitability. An initial inspection will be performed prior to approving a unit for participation in the program. Thereafter, annual inspections will be performed to ensure that the unit is safe and maintained properly, in compliance with the standards set forth by PHCD, and continues to qualify for participation in the program.\n\nShould a unit fail Initial Inspection, the owner/landlord will be given a grace period of 72 hours, not including weekends and holidays, to make the necessary repairs. Owner/landlord is responsible for contacting PHCD’s Inspections Department to request a re-inspection once the repairs have been completed.\n\nAnnual Inspections\n\nPHCD Inspectors will conduct annual unit and common areas inspections to ensure WHIP designated units continue to meet quality standards set by PHCD. Written notice advising of annual inspection will be sent out to property owners/landlords no less than two weeks prior to scheduled date of inspection. Grace period for annual inspections after a “fail inspection” is one month or 30 calendar days from the date of a failed inspection. Inspections Department will automatically schedule the unit for re-inspection and send out notification to owner/landlord. Any unit that is out of compliance for over 30 calendar days will be terminated from the program and PHCD will recap all or partial funds issued to the landlord/owner for said unit(s).\n\nCompliant/Quality Control Inspections\n\nNote: Special Inspections such as complaint inspections or quality control inspections may be processed at the request of the tenant, owner, or a member of the public when a complaint about the condition of a unit is received.\n\nGrace period for compliance inspections after a “failed inspection” is one month or 30 calendar days from the date of a failed inspection. Inspections Department will automatically schedule the unit for re-inspection and send out notification to owner/landlord. Any unit that is out of compliance for over 30 calendar days will be terminated from the program and PHCD will recap all or partial funds issued to landlord/owner for said unit(s)."
