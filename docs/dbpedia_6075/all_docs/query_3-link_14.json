        "text": "Before Netflix's Frank Underwood there was Francis Urquhart - the menacing, fictional Tory chief whip from the original BBC House of Cards series.\n\nIn the TV adaptation of Michael Dobbs's novel, Urquhart snarls that his job is to \"put a bit of stick about - make 'em jump\".\n\nCorralling MPs to do what he wants with coercion, flattery and threats. A pantomime villain and a master of the dark arts of whipping.\n\nIt's all gloriously implausible. Or is it?\n\nWhipping has been the hidden wiring of parliamentary life for at least two centuries. Some have compared their work to city sewers - crucial, but best not seen up close.\n\nThe term itself might sound a bit ridiculous - a centuries-old reference to hunting with hounds - but the whips bring order to political parties at Westminster.\n\nAt its most simple, government whips have the job of ensuring their MPs vote for legislation. Opposition whips assemble their parliamentary forces against the government's plans.\n\nBut in recent months, their methods and effectiveness have been in the headlines. In January, William Wragg, a Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, claimed Tory whips had gone too far.\n\nWhipped will be on BBC Radio 4 at 20.00 on Monday 28 February and available later on BBC Sounds.\n\nHe alleged that MPs suspected of wanting to remove Mr Johnson had been threatened with the removal of government investment in their constituencies.\n\nIt was a claim the Metropolitan Police decided not to investigate and the prime minister said he had seen no evidence to support it.\n\nBut Mr Wragg claims he does not regret his actions. \"I felt compelled to speak out as a means, if anything, to prevent that kind of behaviour from continuing,\" he says.\n\nHis intervention came at a dicey moment for Mr Johnson, with speculation swirling about his leadership and a potential revolt by Tory backbenchers.\n\nIn February the prime minister appointed a new chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, in a clear attempt to repair relations between Conservative MPs and No 10. Will it work?\n\nShredded loyalties\n\n\"I think whether it does or doesn't depends less on the Whips' Office and more on whether the prime minister listens to them,\" says Conservative MP Mark Harper, a former chief whip himself and one of the leading rebels against the government's Covid regulations during the pandemic.\n\nIn December, nearly 100 Conservative MPs defied their whips to oppose the government's plans. It was the biggest rebellion of Mr Johnson's premiership and the latest indication that party discipline and the power of the whipping system appear to be weakening.\n\nWhat was also startling about the December rebellion was how many newly elected Conservative MPs joined in. One was Miriam Cates, who represents Penistone and Stocksbridge - a red wall seat in South Yorkshire.\n\n\"We're very close. We've got a relationship that's been forged through a difficult period of history,\" she says. \"I mean, Covid has been such a challenge. And so we very much drew on each other for support, albeit over WhatsApp, during that time.\n\n\"So there's probably a kind of closeness that we've got because of that.\"\n\nFor many MPs, WhatsApp is now the main way to communicate with colleagues. It makes it easier for them to organise and scheme away from the prying eyes of party whips. It's another reason their grip could be loosening.\n\nThe breakdown in whipping did not begin with the current political crisis. The paroxysm over Brexit shredded party loyalties and caused problems for the whips on both sides. Rebelling became routine and made life for the whips a nightmare.\n\nThe ultimate sanction against an MP who repeatedly defies their whip is to remove it altogether. Cast outside the parliamentary party, they no longer receive weekly instructions on how to vote.\n\nIn September 2019, Mr Johnson stripped the whip from 21 of his own MPs when they sided with opposition parties to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nFormer minister Caroline Nokes recalls how it felt. \"When I got the voicemail from the chief whip, it wasn't a surprise,\" she says. \"I still felt a little bit sick. But the following morning I got up, looked in the mirror and felt that I had done the right thing.\"\n\nFor Ms Nokes, who has since had the whip restored, the experience was \"liberating\". What party whips do not want are free-thinking MPs making their own decisions on big issues.\n\nBut an MP who has rebelled against their party once is quite likely to do it again and this is why whipping is getting harder.\n\nIncredibly, 201 Conservative MPs, more than half the parliamentary party, have rebelled against their government on a big vote since 2017. It's a huge number by historical standards.\n\nLabour has also had its share of difficulties. When its MPs overwhelmingly rejected Jeremy Corbyn after the EU referendum, the opposition whips' office went into survival mode.\n\nIf she's right, and the old ways of whipping MPs into line are breaking down, it's a huge challenge to the way UK politics works."
