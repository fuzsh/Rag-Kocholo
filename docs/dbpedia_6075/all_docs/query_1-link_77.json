        "text": "It was a departure speech that left more questions than it answered. When Boris Johnson vacated Downing Street in September 2022, comparing himself to Cincinnatus, he naturally sparked speculation as to what exactly he meant when he said he would be channelling the Roman statesman by “returning to his plough”.\n\nSome took it as a suggestion that he would go quietly back to the backbenches, but those with a more in-depth knowledge of classics found deeper meaning in the obscure reference.\n\nAs the historians Tom Holland and Mary Beard quickly pointed out, “enemy of the people” Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus was recalled from his plough to become leader of Rome for a second time. He was working on a small farm in 458 BC when he was re-appointed dictator of Rome to rescue a consular army that was surrounded on Mount Algidus. After defeating the enemy in a single day, he brought Rome through the emergency before returning to his plough once more.\n\nDespite largely disappearing into obscurity beyond his weekly newspaper column and the odd appearance in Ukraine, talk of the self-styled “world king” making a comeback have persisted ever since he resigned as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in June 2023.\n\nIn the wake of the Partygate scandal, the notion of “bringing back Boris” appeared complete folly. Yet the resurgence of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for US president, combined with the Tories this week falling to their lowest level of poll support in almost 50 years, have increased the likelihood of a Cincinnatus-style comeback.\n\nThe biggest hint came last month when “sources familiar with the former prime minister’s thinking” revealed that he would welcome a personal telephone call from Rishi Sunak to ask for his help campaigning in the general election.\n\nThe suggestion came after it emerged Conservative strategists would like to deploy the former London mayor on the campaign trail later this year, despite a major fall-out between the pair in 2023 over Johnson’s honours list.\n\nIt followed focus polling in the pro-Brexit seat of Wellingborough ahead of February’s by-election, which found that the current prime minister was compared unfavourably to his predecessor. While Sunak was described by one voter as a “showbusiness man”, Johnson was praised for his charisma and ability to “talk to the people”. Four out of seven participants pinpointed his departure in September 2022 and subsequent Tory infighting as the reason why they gave up on the party.\n\nFollowing Wednesday’s Budget flop, many Tory backbenchers fearing electoral wipeout have been whistling for “Big Dog” to return to the Conservative kennel.\n\nAs one explained: “There are many in the party who don’t think we have a hope in hell of winning unless Boris comes back. Of course there are some who can’t forgive him for Partygate but we’re running out of better ideas.”\n\nAnother Conservative veteran added: “Sunak can’t campaign. He doesn’t like it and he isn’t any good at it. Boris’s campaigning capability is the most vital part of what is the problem right now.\n\n“There’s 45 per cent of the public who genuinely haven’t made their minds up and just need to be convinced. So it isn’t over yet but with the present incumbent and his wet Chancellor – neither can move the dial but Boris could probably make a difference.”\n\nJohnson, 59, who joked when he left office that he was “like one of those booster rockets that has fulfilled its function”, is said to be seriously considering re-entering the Westminster atmosphere. But just how would one of the most divisive political figures in recent memory engineer a safe landing?\n\nOne approach, being described by allies as “the Peter Lilley method” would be for Johnson to be parachuted into a safe Tory seat following an eleventh-hour resignation by either the sitting MP, or the Conservative party candidate.\n\nLilley, the former MP for Hitchin and Harpenden, was expected to fight the 2017 snap general election but on April 26, seven days after Theresa May’s call for another ballot was ratified by the House of Commons, the former deputy party leader stood down after serving for 34 years. He was elevated to the House of Lords a year later.\n\nAccording to one Johnson ally: “In the case of a last-minute resignation like Lilley’s, the Conservative candidates department would submit a list of three approved potential candidates, and if Boris was on such a list then he’d win the selection, no question.\n\n“One of the reasons Boris resigned rather than risking the whip being removed was so he could stand for re-election without any obstacles in his way. That was a very shrewd tactical move at the time.”\n\nFor this approach to work, however, Johnson’s team would not only need to pinpoint a seat with a healthy majority, but also identify one where the local association would be supportive of a Boris reboot.\n\nOn top of that, they would need the incumbent to have a last-minute change of heart about standing.\n\nSo far, 59 Conservative MPs have announced they are stepping down at the next election, one of the most recent being Paul Scully, the former London minister, who was one of Johnson’s most loyal lieutenants. His Sutton and Cheam constituency would arguably not be a safe bet for Johnson because it only has a majority of 8,351.\n\nVeteran political strategist and pollster Dr Frank Luntz has suggested that Tory MPs with majorities of 8,000 or less are unlikely to retain their seats, which puts Conservatives including Simon Hart, the Chief Whip, Steve Baker, a Northern Ireland Office minister, and Lee Anderson, the former deputy party chairman, at risk. It would be completely self-defeating – not to mention deeply embarrassing – for Johnson to attempt a career comeback, only to end up losing to Labour or the Liberal Democrats on election night.\n\nMost Tory constituencies with a vacating MP – or new seats created by the recent boundary changes – have started advertising for a prospective parliamentary candidate with many having already chosen a potential successor, which would appear to rule them out for Johnson. Last September, The Telegraph reported that the Tories had only selected 65 candidates out of their target of 100 before the Conservative Party Conference. That number appears to have gone up to 129 at a rough estimate, but there are still some seats, such as Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, which haven’t yet advertised for a candidate, let alone appointed one.\n\nFinding a safe seat, with a pro-Johnson electorate, most likely in an area that voted for Brexit, with an MP or candidate willing to stand down at the last minute is not without its challenges.\n\nBut could Henley be a possibility?\n\nA return to the Oxfordshire constituency, where Johnson was the MP from 2001 to 2008 before running for the London mayoralty, has long been widely mooted. It is conveniently located just 15 miles from Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, where Johnson lives at Brightwell Manor with his third wife Carrie, 35, and their three children Wilfred, three, Romy, two and seven-month-old Frank.\n\nThree months before he stood down in Uxbridge and Ruislip last summer, Johnson was warned against a “chicken run” to the “true blue” seat, which has been Conservative since 1885 and boasts a healthy majority of 14,053.\n\nSpeculation about the future of the constituency, which voted remain in the 2016 referendum, has been rife since Johnson’s successor John Howell announced he was stepping down at the next general election.\n\nAlthough Howell had suggested Johnson would only take up the seat “over my dead body”, his influence appears to have diminished in light of his planned resignation amid recent health problems.\n\nLast month, eyebrows were raised by the selection of Caroline Newton, one of Johnson’s closest allies, as the Conservative candidate for the revised consistency of Henley & Thame.\n\nHenley-born Ms Newton, 54, who was a Henley councillor from 2017 to 2023, was selected ahead of investment banker Lucy Demery, former serviceman Lincoln Jopp and Meg Powell-Chandler, a senior aide to ministers. The meeting was attended by more than 100 party members from across the new constituency.\n\nWelcoming Ms Newton’s selection, chairman of Henley & Thame Conservatives Andrew Collins said: “Caroline is a fantastic local campaigner, who will bring a strong background and wealth of experience to the role. We are all looking forward to working with her and know that she will be a great champion for all residents across the new Henley and Thame constituency.”\n\nIt cannot have gone unnoticed, however, that the Cambridge history graduate has very close links to Johnson, having served as an assistant director at the Greater London Authority when he was London mayor. In 2022, she was brought back into the fold to act as Johnson’s special adviser after being recruited by her former City Hall colleague Guto Harri, Downing Street’s former director of communications.\n\nWhen Johnson stood down as an MP last June, Ms Newton appeared on Times Radio to defend her “visionary” former boss and his “not insignificant legacy”. Describing herself as an “activist in Henley”, she herself conceded that there was a sense that the Henley seat was being kept warm for him.\n\n“It’s been mooted as somewhere he may come back to so we out here are very conscious of what’s been happening and the suggestion that he might come back and represent us,” she said.\n\n“Frankly, there are a few people who feel he’s been very hard done by, there are a few people who think that he is the author of his misfortunes and there are some who feel he’s been hard done by but now think it’s time for him to go and get on with the next phase of his life, possibly with the sense of coming back in a bit.” Of course, all this was before she put herself forward to represent the constituency.\n\nShe added: “I know people may find this hard to believe that I think he has a really strong sense of the duty that he had towards the country in the position he was in.”\n\nThis week, her words were echoed by one loyalist MP who said: “He feels it’s his calling. He’s probably been told – and he’s not stupid enough to ignore – that he is arguably the only Tory who can turn this around. It might backfire but the party is fast running out of options.”\n\nChanges that were recently made to Conservative candidate selections by another Johnson ally, Sir Mike Penning, the outgoing MP for Hemel Hempstead mean that it would be almost impossible to keep the former prime minister off any list of approved candidates.\n\nHandpicked by Johnson to overhaul the system amid fears too many “wets” were making it through the selections process, Sir Mike banned open primaries, where voters can take part, even if they don’t support the Conservatives, and put a stop to local candidates being automatically shoe-horned onto the list. The reforms put the former prime minister in a stronger position should there be a “next time”.\n\nJohnson being parachuted into fight Henley would of course require Ms Newton to stand down as the prospective parliamentary candidate but it is at least theoretically possible.\n\nIs he ready to run again?\n\nThe former prime minister is understood to have delayed the publication of his memoirs, for which he was paid a £510,000 advance by Harper Collins, until after the election, having initially tabled the book for this September. He is also writing a book on Shakespeare but the autobiography, described by one friend as “more of a treatise on levelling up”, remains the priority along with sporadic but lucrative speaking engagements. Money is no longer an issue for Johnson, who is estimated to have made more than £6 million since leaving office.\n\nLast October, GB News announced that the former prime minister was joining the channel as “a presenter, programme maker and commentator”. Although he has not yet appeared on air, he is believed to be working on a new series “showcasing the power of Britain around the world.” The theme perfectly suits Johnson’s repositioning of himself as a global statesman, defending the West against the tyranny of Russia, China and Britain’s enemies in the Middle East.\n\nHe also believes he can make a contribution on the world’s stage in the event of Donald Trump serving a second term in the Oval Office. Not only does he get on well with the former US president but his equally close relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky could prove invaluable when it comes to negotiating a peace deal with Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe has already laid the groundwork in his Daily Mail column, writing: “If he [Trump] does the right thing and backs the Ukrainians — and I believe he will — a Trump presidency can be a big win for the world.” Last month, he visited Kviv to mark the second anniversary of the war, calling on Britain and her allies to give Ukraine “the military, political and economic help that they need” to “expel Putin’s forces”.\n\nYet when it comes to international diplomacy – and, indeed, Tory campaigning – Johnson has a formidable rival that many appear to have overlooked amid all the buzz around Penny Mordaunt, Kemi Badenoch and other future leadership hopefuls.\n\nThe other Oxfordshire-linked old Etonian who is also thought to be eyeing up a second term in No 10 following his political rebirth is Lord Cameron.\n\nThe scale of the foreign secretary’s ambition was plain to see in the slick video he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday marking his first 100 days in office. Captioned “I’ve been Foreign Secretary for 113 days. This is what we’ve done”, the 1 minute 20 second clip could not have been more prime ministerial.\n\nAccording to one Tory MP familiar with the department: “The Foreign Office has started referring to Cameron as ‘Britain’s Foreign PM’. He’s the PM on the world’s stage while Rishi does the domestic. The Foreign Office has loved his revival and it’s also been warmly welcomed by all the liberals on the Left. Meanwhile, Sunak has made no impact on anything or anybody.”\n\nLike Johnson, Cameron, who stood down as prime minister and MP for Witney following the EU Referendum in 2016, would have to run for re-election to have a shot at leading the Conservatives again. He would face a similar dilemma to his successor in finding the right constituency under the right conditions. He would also be required to renounce his peerage. But as one former minister who served in his government pointed out: “He wouldn’t have a problem with that. He doesn’t want the peerage. He only came into the Lords to take the job.”\n\nAccording to another long-standing Tory with an acute sense of deja vu: “He’s planning a return to greatness, that’s plain to see. But he would need to win the support of the Right of the party.”\n\nThe question of what might be left of the party after the country has gone to the polls is another conundrum for both Johnson and Cameron to solve. A reduced caucus of moderate remainers would naturally favour the foreign secretary while Johnson would be better suited returning to a fold largely occupied by Brexiteer right wingers, despite once proclaiming himself to be a “One Nation Tory”.\n\nShould either – or both – hitting the campaign trail result in a marginal Tory victory or a reduced Labour majority then the prospect of returning to the helm will be much more enticing. There is a school of Conservative thought that even if Sir Keir Starmer wins, he is going to be left with such a mess that he won’t survive more than one term.\n\nAs one Tory MP explained: “He’s not going to have any money to spend on public services and is sitting on a powder keg when it comes to the conflict in the Middle East so there’s every chance Labour will quickly tear themselves apart. Johnson and Cameron or any wannabe PM for that matter would want to be in pole position should Starmer quickly come unstuck.”\n\nBut a more comprehensive Labour victory/Tory wipeout scenario would arguably have the potential to propel Johnson and Cameron in dramatically different directions. While the latter might not have the appetite to pick up the pieces following an electoral oblivion, preferring a quiet retreat back to his shepherd’s hut, a full-blown Tory split could benefit Johnson if he is able to forge an alliance with Reform.\n\nAsked about the future possibility of forming a “dream ticket” with his former Brexit sparring partner, Nigel Farage mused in January: “I don’t think under this leadership there’s very much prospect of that at all. I think we’re a long way away at this moment in time, but never say never.”\n\nA Roman palace coup of Churchillian proportions, then? As is ever the case with Boris Johnson, the problem is not going to be one of ambition, but execution."
