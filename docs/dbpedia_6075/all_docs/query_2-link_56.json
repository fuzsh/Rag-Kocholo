        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have opposed his appointment and called for Cameron's peerage to be blocked. Why is his appointment opposed? Know in detail about Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn a surprise appointment, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made former British leader David Cameron, the country's new Foreign Secretary. He served as UK Prime Minister from 2010 to 2016 and resigned after the outcome of the Brexit referendum when Britain voted to leave the European Union. After quitting office, Cameron distanced himself from politics and spent the last seven years writing his memoirs. He also tried his hands in business and launched Greensill Capital, a finance firm that later collapsed.\n\nDavid Cameron to join House of Lords\n\nDavid Cameron is not a member of the British Parliament at present. The Prime Minister's Office has said King Charles has approved giving Cameron a seat in Britain's upper chamber, the House of Lords. This will allow him to return to government as a minister despite no longer being an elected member of the house.\n\nLibDems oppose David Cameron's appointment\n\nBut the Liberal Democrats have opposed his appointment and called for Cameron's peerage to be blocked. They have referred to his lobbying for collapsed finance company Greensill Capital. Senior Labour MP Pat McFadden told BBC that Cameron's appointment \"puts to bed the prime minister's laughable claim to offer a change from 13 years of Tory failure\". Talking to BBC, he said, \"A few weeks ago Rishi Sunak said David Cameron was part of a failed status quo, now he's bringing him back as his life raft.\"\n\nDavid Cameron praises Rishi Sunak\n\nReacting to his appointment, Cameron said that he wanted to be \"part of the strongest possible team that serves the United Kingdom\" ahead of the general election. He said further that though he might have disagreed with some individual decisions, it is clear to him that Rishi Sunak is a strong and capable prime minister and he is showing exemplary leadership at a difficult time.\n\n4 Junior ministers quit\n\nMeanwhile, as Sunak's reshuffle continues, four junior ministers have announced to stand down from government. Long-serving Schools Minister Nick Gibb said that he was resigning and would also step down as an MP at the next election. Neil O'Brien said that he had quit his role as health minister. Similarly, Will Quince has also resigned from the Department of Health and Social Care, while Jesse Norman has left his quit as a transport minister.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhy appointment of David Cameron is being opposed?\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have opposed the appointment of David Cameron and called for his peerage to be blocked. They have referred to his lobbying for the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital.\n\nWhen did David Cameron become UK PM and why did he quit?\n\nDavid Cameron served as UK Prime Minister from 2010 to 2016 and resigned after the outcome of the Brexit referendum when Britain voted to leave the European Union. After quitting office, Cameron distanced himself from politics and spent the last seven years writing his memoirs.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
