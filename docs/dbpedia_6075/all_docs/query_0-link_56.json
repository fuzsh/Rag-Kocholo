        "text": "“Calm down, dear.” With those three words to Labour’s Angela Eagle during a 2011 Commons debate on NHS reforms, David Cameron encapsulated what had come to be seen as his “woman problem”.\n\nHigh-handed, patronising, arrogant, the verbal pat on the head reeked of privilege, the head boy of an exclusive public school taking umbrage at the admission of girls to the sixth form.\n\nIn a moment he had undone the work of years, his modernising agenda relevant only to the male half of the electorate: Westminster was and should be a boys’ club; women need not apply.\n\nAngela Eagle\n\nThe caricature of David Cameron as an upper crust sexist ill at ease in the presence of strong women was never really fair, however.\n\nBefore coming to power and once inside Number 10 he surrounded himself with hugely influential women. From Gabby Bertin, his former press aide turned director of external relations, to current “gatekeeper” Kate Fall and head of operations Liz Sugg, he relies on and is held up by women like few prime ministers before.\n\nGabby Bertin, David Cameron's long-serving aide (Ph:Steve Back)\n\nYet he allowed the whiff of misogyny to hang over him, failing in his first term to do enough to tackle an image which was as potentially damaging, both to himself and his party, as it was inaccurate.\n\nWhile the Coalition made great strides in promoting measures such as flexible working hours and shared paternity leave, the Tories permitted the Liberal Democrats to make the running in claiming them as their own.\n\nLeery of describing himself a feminist, and with a first Cabinet which included just four women - one fewer than Tony Blair appointed to his first government in 1997 - by the time the campaign proper began, Mr Cameron was wide open to an all-out attack on his record on women’s issues.\n\nYet one of Labour’s many glaring errors was the failure to make more of the perception that Mr Cameron doesn’t understand the realities of life for modern families, and in particular the aspirations and challenges of being a mother in Britain today.\n\nWhile the more thoughtful of his opponents, including Rachel Reeves, did their best to highlight the gender imbalance which left women suffering far more on average from the Coalition’s spending cuts, it was the Prime Minister’s good fortune that Labour took for granted its long advantage with female voters.\n\nRachel Reeves, Labour work and pensions spokesman\n\nHow he must have laughed at the flawed strategy of focussing on stunts like courting self-appointed youth ambassador Russell Brand and the excruciating Miliband tombstone rather than the Government’s child benefit wobble.\n\nIf the Prime Minister is rightly receiving plaudits for pulling off a highly unexpected victory, it is Samantha Cameron who deserves much of the praise for the Tory triumph.\n\nDavid and Samantha Cameron on the campaign trail\n\nHer decision at this election - unlike in 2010 - to put herself and her children at the front of the campaign allowed her husband to portray himself as an equal partner in a thoroughly modern marriage.\n\nWhen she spoke of Mr Cameron’s rock solid strength in carrying her through her grief at the death of their profoundly disabled little boy, it did more to assure female voters he was on their side, a parent like them, sharing their concerns, than any number of Newsnight appearances.\n\nSamantha’s down-to-earth presence and role as a working mother herself gave him permission to discuss the Conservatives’ pledge to offer 30 hours of free childcare a week as an issue which mattered to his own family rather than a vague promise to pay lip service to.\n\nNow he is safely back in Downing Street, but without the security blanket of his wife at his side 24 hours a day, Mr Cameron has moved fast to establish his credibility with female voters. He knows it is imperative for his party’s survival next time around - and his own legacy.\n\nIf anything, in theory the so-called female problem is more problematic than ever. Quietly, a female revolution has taken place at this election, with all six leaders of the main parties bar the Tories now women.\n\nWhile this extraordinary state of affairs will be short lived - for one, acting leader Sal Brinton can not be replaced by a women as there are no female Liberal Democrat MPs left, Mr Cameron will be keeping a close eye on the Labour leadership contest. Yvette Cooper is perhaps his the candidate he most dreads.\n\nWhere Prime Minister’s Question Time so often resembled an Oxford debating club over the last five years, with Mr Cameron effortlessly bullying Ed Miliband into submission, taking the same approach with a woman, however strong, and however reluctant Tory strategists might be to say it out loud, would inevitably come across as boorish.\n\nThere will be another change at PMQs. In the past, for the benefit of the TV cameras, the whips were careful to ensure that Mr Cameron was surrounded by a “donut” of women Conservative MPs. By the time he finishes his reshuffle, we are told, a third of his government will be female, meaning such careful choreography will no longer be necessary.\n\nThere will be 64 female Tory MPs on the Government benches, up from 48 before the election; still far short of the 101 “Blair Babes” who entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landside, but the direction of travel for the Conservatives is clear.\n\nIn terms of a tipping point, it was perhaps 2010 rather than 2015 which proved the key moment, the controversial A-list doing for Conservative associations what all-women shortlists had a generation before for constituency Labour parties.\n\nBy 2010 there had never been more than 20 female Tory MPs; there were just 17 when Mr Cameron became leader. The last election saw the emergence of a cohort of smart, able women, the likes of Liz Truss and Esther McVey, who Mr Cameron could trust with ministerial office.\n\nLiz Truss, Environment Secretary\n\nThe fact he didn’t promote more of the female 2010 intake earlier was in some part due to the pressures of the Coalition government.\n\nFor all their talk of equality, the Lib Dems’ track record on advancing women was abysmal. Now he no longer has to find room for Liberal Democrat men in his government, Mr Cameron has more space to promote his own talented women.\n\nWhat are the implications of that? The answer is something far more profound than window dressing and yet more subtle than a causal dynamic of women implementing female-friendly policies.\n\nThe country is now run by a team which views women as equal partners, at work, at home and, at last, in government.\n\nPut simply, the air in the room will feel different in ministerial departments up and down Whitehall. During the Blair years, female ministers were often shy to raise so-called women’s issues such as equal pay for fear of being pigeon-holed.\n\nNow, when the same topics are discussed, it will be by women who are emboldened and men who have already talked them over with their wives.\n\nNicky Morgan, the Education Secretary\n\nThere are now seven women attending Cabinet; no shrinking violets, they bring flair and intelligence to their posts.\n\nFrom Theresa May, the formidable Home Secretary to Nicky Morgan, the appealing Education Secretary who proudly declared herself a feminist this year, those women who are remaining in post have been some of Mr Cameron’s most reliable performers.\n\nAmber Rudd, the new Energy and Climate Change Minister\n\nPriti Patel, the new Employment Minister, will have the most direct involvement with “women’s” policies. The only female ethnic minority attending Cabinet, she will oversee the roll-out of free childcare and will continue her campaign to improve women’s rights in the workplace from within government.\n\nIn that she’ll work closely with Anna Soubry, the new Minister for Small Business, who will also be attending Cabinet. Something of a talisman for the Tories, having defied the odds to hang on to her seat and increase her majority, as the daughter of a garage-owner she is outspoken and knows something the world.\n\nPenny Mordaunt becomes the first female occupant of the role of Armed Forces minister.\n\nAnna Soubry, Business Minister\n\nBut it is perhaps among the lower ranks that the most interesting appointments will be made, with the likes of Tracey Crouch, Karen Bradley and Charlotte Leslie tipped for promotion."
