        "text": "As a “Human Empowerment Company”, Ottobock strengthens freedom of movement, quality of life and independence. Ottobock has been developing innovative prosthetics, exoskeletons and neuromobility products for people with restricted mobility for more than 100 years. At the same time, the medical technology company offers holistic care concepts with its own patient care centers.\n\nSince 1919 products and technologies from Ottobock have been helping people to gain new freedom of movement and avoid potential complications. Initially, the company revolutionised the market by the series production of prosthetic components. Since then, the focus has turned to microprocessor-controlled knee joints such as the C-Leg (which can be controlled via an app), the computer-controlled C-Brace leg orthosis, the multi-articulating bebionic hand, Juvo power wheelchairs and the Paexo exoskeleton range for ergonomic workplaces. As a global technology leader in ‘wearable human bionics’, the company is constantly setting new standards and driving the digitization of the industry – together with its partners, the patient care centers, and international research institutions.\n\nThe company’s international activities are coordinated from its headquarters in Duderstadt (Lower Saxony, Germany). Ottobock has been supporting the Paralympic Games with its technical know-how since 1988."
