        "text": "1 Otto Hölder’s forgotten legacy\n\n2The most important objective of Hölder’s philosophical thinking is the clarification of the value and of the limitations of sign-use in mathematics [Hölder 1924, 5]. Hölder is concerned about the emergence of a Zeitgeist characterized by a unilateral confidence in symbolic practices, which he sometimes calls “formalism”.\n\n5The discrepancy between van der Waerden’s suggestion of a link between Hölder and Gödel, on the one hand, and the lack of recognition of Hölder’s philosophy of mathematics by posterity, on the other, is surprising. If van der Waerden is right, modern history and philosophy of mathematics has failed to take notice of an immensely fruitful contribution, provided by a first rate mathematician. How can this be explained?\n\n8Hölder’s rejection of the methods of Frege and Peano and, more generally, his strict rejection of symbolic logic (see below) may be one of the causes having led to the poor reception of his ideas.\n\n9The structure and style of Hölder’s approach to these issues in his writings may be the other cause. Hölder does not manage to develop a sufficiently clear and rich philosophical conception capable to support his examination of method. He writes not as a philosopher, but as a mathematician interested in a clarification of the mathematical method. This may be seen as a major limitation of Hölder’s approach. This limitation, however, is also an advantage, for Hölder does not try to defend any particular philosophical school, nor does he try to create a philosophical system of his own. He rather observes the mathematical practice and the way it is reflected by philosophers, trying to expose the issues on which the philosophical description fails to do justice to the practice of the working mathematician.\n\n10The main objective of this paper is to give a brief presentation of some of Hölder’s reflections concerning the limits of formalization and the role of arithmetical intuition in mathematical deduction. I rely mainly but not exclusively on Hölder’s The Mathematical Method of 1924.\n\n2 The limits of formalization\n\n12The same topic is taken up a few lines further with respect to the logic of relations. Hölder explains that in the hands of mathematicians, the logic of relations was turned into a symbolic calculus known under the name of “Logistic” [Hölder 1924, 4–5]. Hölder points out that in certain cases formalization may prove helpful but only as a heuristic tool. He continues by rejecting the view (which he attributes to Louis Couturat), that the formalization of logic is an essential requirement for providing a truly scientific presentation of logic. He explains his position as follows:\n\n9 Hölder returns to Couturat’s position later in the book. He criticizes Couturat for regarding the s (...)\n\n10 All the translations of Hölder’s texts are mine.\n\n(...) when in the course of a mathematical investigation new signs (...) are introduced, as this often happens, it is not possible to justify the reasoning behind the introduction of those new signs, by means of a new symbolic calculus. It is obvious that if this could be done, and if the previous position would be adequate, one would then be compelled to justify the latter symbolic calculus by means of a new such calculus, and we would have to pursue this process further indefinitely. We would thus reach (...) an “infinite regress”. [Hölder 1924, 5]\n\n13Hölder relies here on a classical kind of argument often raised to emphasize the limits of justification. One equally classical solution to this type of problem is provided by the axiomatic method.\n\n14If we desire to provide an axiomatic treatment of a theory, then all we need to do is to identify a finite adequate list of undefined primitive notions, and a finite adequate list of first principles expressing properties of the primitive notions (the axioms of the theory). Based on the chosen primitive notions and axioms we can then state and deduce all other results of the theory in case. One of the major hopes linked to the new axiomatic method, as it was understood, for instance by David Hilbert and his school, was precisely the conviction that a symbolic, axiomatic treatment of pure mathematics and of logic would make it possible to prove the consistency of mathematics.\n\n15Hölder had carefully reflected on these matters independently of Hilbert, and indeed before Hilbert’s work on the foundations of geometry was published. As said, the first traces of Hölder’s thinking are visible in Hölder’s review of Robert Graßmann’s Treatise on Number [Hölder 1892]. Here we find the first expression of Hölder’s conviction that the axiomatic method cannot be used for proving the consistency of arithmetic.\n\n16Before returning to Hölder’s arguments concerning the nature of mathematical deduction, it is helpful to emphasize an important aspect of Hilbert’s conception of proof, criticized by Hölder. Niebergall and Schirn describe Hilbert’s conception of proof in the following terms:\n\nWhile nowadays metamathematics is conceived as being formulated and axiomatized in a formal language, Hilbert’s finitist metamathematics qua contentual theory of formalized proof (...) is neither formalized nor axiomatized. It is supposed to allow only intuitive and contentual reasoning, and, as Hilbert (...) stresses, this kind of reasoning is, by its very nature, free from axiomatic assumptions. Due to this sharp distinction between formalized mathematics and contentual metamathematics, the meanings attached to the word “to prove” in the two “disciplines” are fundamentally different. In formalized mathematics, it means to infer according to the formal rules of the calculus; in contentual metamathematics, it means to show by means of contentual intuitively evident inference. It is precisely the intuition-based character of metamathematical reasoning that is supposed to guarantee its security and reliability. (...) In a nutshell: Hilbert’s finitist metamathematics is a non-formalized, non-axiomatized, and surveyable “theory” with a non-mathematical vocabulary whose intended domain consists of concrete and surveyable figures, in particular, of formulas (e.g., axioms) and proofs. [Niebergall & Schirn 1998, 274ff.]\n\n17Hölder believes that the difficulties involved in establishing the consistency of formalized mathematics, cannot be conclusively dealt with, by means of the metamathematical shift proposed by Hilbert. Hölder thinks that the same difficulties would sooner or later surface again in examining the proofs elaborated at the level of contentual metamathematics. We would then, if the ideal of a formal-axiomatic treatment is retained, sooner or later have to mathematize metamathematics. In this case, however, we would run precisely into the infinite regress described by Hölder above.\n\n18In the next sections of this paper I will present some of Hölder’s key arguments advanced in support of this position. These arguments belong to an alternative conception of mathematical proof outlined by Hölder in his The Mathematical Method of 1924.\n\n3 A genetic interpretation of Hilbert’s axiomatic method\n\n19Hölder is not just skeptical about the possibility of proving the consistency of arithmetic along the lines proposed by Hilbert. He finds no merit whatsoever in seeking an axiomatic treatment of arithmetic. The main reason for this is Hölder’s understanding of the value and limits of the axiomatic approach in pure mathematics. The fundamental ingredient of this attitude is Hölder’s account of the content/form distinction in mathematics. Let me explain this.\n\n21The situation changes considerably if we shift our attention from empirical science to pure mathematics and particularly to arithmetic and logic. In arithmetic and logic it is impossible to draw a clear distinction between the content of the theory and its form.\n\n22In order to establish this, Hölder explores a large number of examples. One such example is taken from geometry. We are told that in geometry we often find geometric concepts and geometric proofs, which essentially rely on our logical intuition of the sequence of the natural numbers. In such cases, geometric concepts are used “not just formally but according to their content” [Hölder 1899, 58–59]. Here is one of Hölder’s examples used to illustratethis situation.\n\n24We can easily prove that in any equilateral triangle, square, regular pentagon, etc., the sum of the distances of any interior point to its sides is independent of the position of the point, without using arithmetical intuition. To state and prove a theorem such as: “In any regular n-gon the sum of the distances of an interior point to its sides does not depend on the position of the point” we need to go beyond the finite. The idea is that our ability to frame certain general concepts and general proofs must be rooted in a special faculty of our mind, the arithmetical intuition, our intuition of the sequence of the natural numbers [Hölder 1924, 338ff.].\n\n25The simplest mathematical expression of arithmetical intuition is the arithmetic of the natural numbers. The core of this is our ability to frame infinite sequential procedures and use them in developing new concepts and proofs. The sequence-concept [Reihenfolgebegriff] is the content and, at the same time, the form of our thinking [Hölder 1924, 292–320].\n\n26In Über den Zahlbegriff, which was published in 1900, Hilbert contrasted the genetic to the axiomatic approach to arithmetic and remarked that priority should be given to the axiomatic method. Hölder is not against the axiomatic method, but simply against giving it priority over the genetic method (which Hölder prefers to call the synthetic method) in respect to consistency questions.\n\n28Hilbert presents a system of axioms for “complex systems of numbers [complexe Zahlensysteme]” [Hilbert 1899, 26], a term already used by Hermann Hankel. Hilbert defines his Zahlensysteme by introducing three groups of axioms. They are: “Sätze der Verknüpfung”; “Sätze der Anordnung”; Archimede’s axiom. Hilbert uses these to define a totally ordered, Archimedean field.\n\n30Hölder begins his examination of Hilbert’s proof by reproducing the main principles involved in his discussion of the proof:\n\na + (b + c)\n\n=\n\n(a + b) + c\n\n(7)\n\na + b\n\n=\n\nb + a\n\n(8)\n\na(bc)\n\n=\n\n(ab)c\n\n(9)\n\na(b + c)\n\n=\n\nab + ac\n\n(10)\n\n(a + b)c\n\n=\n\nac + bc\n\n(11)\n\nab\n\n=\n\nba.\n\n(12)\n\n31He describes Hilbert’s approach in the following terms:\n\nWe imagine certain objects of an arbitrary kind, which are not numbers, but which allow two operations [Kompositionsweisen] to be carried out on them. We call the operations “addition” and “multiplication” (...). It goes without saying that these operations must be distinguished from the addition and multiplication of numbers. The two operations are taken to satisfy formulas (1) to (5) above. A few other obvious principles are (...) also stipulated. Of particular importance is the Archimedean axiom which is also adopted as a principle. The latter states that, provided that a is smaller than b, by adding a to itself sufficiently often, an object a + a + a + … + a can be manufactured [hergestellt], which is greater than b, that is, there is a multiple of a exceeding b. [Hölder 1924, 320ff.]\n\n32Hölder then reproduces the most important steps of Hilbert’s proof. Here I only discuss those steps of Hilbert’s proof, which according to Hölder involve arithmetical intuition. To establish (6), Hilbert first proves the equality ndmd = mnd. Hilbert’s proof goes like this.\n\n33Hilbert postulates the existence of a special unit e for which ae = ea = a holds for any magnitude a. By repeatedly using axiom (4) we get:\n\nand by using axiom (5) we get:\n\n34This leads immediately to:\n\nMd · nd =\n\n{(e + e + … + e)d}{[e + e + … + e]d} =\n\n{(e + e + … + e)d[e + e + … + e]}d =\n\n{(e + e + … + e){d[e + e + … + e]}}d =\n\n{(e + e + … + e){[e + e + … + e]d}}d =\n\n{{(e + e + … + e)[e + e + … + e]}d}d =\n\n{(e + e + … + e)[e + e + … + e]}{d²} =\n\nmnd²\n\n36This step of Hilbert’s proof is analyzed by Hölder in the following terms:\n\nThis may leave the impression that in this proof proper arithmetical reasoning has been switched off [ausgeschaltet]. A closer examination of the genesis [Entstehung] of (10) and (11) leads, however, to the contrary view. For instance, in order to obtain (10) by using rule (4), one must first acknowledge that the repeated application of rule (4) to the expression:\n\nshould be understood, for instance, as meaning\n\na(…(((e + e) + e) + e) + … + e).\n\nThe latter operation must produce the object a as its result, as many times as the object e was present in the bracket of (13). One therefore finds oneself counting the steps of the proof procedure [Man denkt sich also wieder die Schritte des Beweisverfahrens selbst gezählt]. [Hölder 1924, 323ff.]\n\n38Let me now turn to Hölder’s comments on Hilbert’s use of the Archimedean axiom. Hilbert’s proof also relies on the following identities:\n\nmd < a ≤ (m + 1)d\n\n(8)\n\nand\n\nnd < b ≤ (n + 1)d.\n\n(9)\n\n39Hölder writes:\n\nAn exact analysis of the thinking pattern that led to the inequalities (8) and (9) also leads to a notable result. Using the Archimedean axiom only states that not all multiples of d can be smaller than a. From this one deduces that in the sequence of multiples\n\n1d;2d;3d;4d;…\n\nthere must be a first that is not smaller than a. But since d itself, that is, the first element of the sequence, was taken to be smaller than a, there must be a multiple of that first element of the sequence for which md is still smaller than a, whereas is (m + 1)d greater or equal to a ; this proves (8). [Hölder 1924, 324]\n\n40Here arithmetical intuition is involved twice. First of all, it is involved in the axiom itself. This axiom is nothing more than the expression of the idea that it is possible to add d an indefinite number of times, until we find some natural number k satisfying a ≤ kd. The axiom is used, so to speak, to cover up arithmetical intuition. The second time it is involved in establishing the existence of the number m. To find m we must conceive another sequential procedure. We pursue the sequence 1d, 2d, 3d,…,kd backwards an indefinite number of times until we find the least natural number (which we denote by m + 1) satisfying a ≤ (m + 1)d. Once found, it is clear that md < a also holds. In order to establish the existence of m + 1 we must appeal to the fact that the set of the natural numbers is well-ordered. The Archimedean axiom and the well-ordering principle depend on our ability to imagine certain sequential procedures as being repeated for an unspecified number of times, and therefore, on contentual arithmetic. The proof described here also involves concept-superposition [Überbauung] of concepts: in a first step, we use a sequential procedure to generate k; this is followed by a second sequential procedure which is attached on top of the first, and which leads to m.\n\nConclusion\n\n42In the previous pages I presented a small sample of Hölder’s reflections concerning mathematical deduction. The most important aspect found is Hölder’s view that certain proofs involve what I have called second-order-counting or meta-counting, something that Hölder calls concept-superposition. According to Hölder, therefore, a deductive examination of certain theorems of arithmetic involves self-referential moments. A sharp separation between deduction and counting, of the kind involved in Hilbert’s distinction between mathematics and metamathematics appears therefore, impossible.\n\n43Niebergall and Schirn point out that there is a complementarity between Hilbert’s treatment of arithmetic, which requires coding numbers by signs on the one hand, and the post-Gödelian tradition which relies on coding signs by numbers, on the other [Niebergall & Schirn 1998, 174]. Hölder recognized that counting cannot be switched off, that is, that formalization would require, in a second step, mathematization. In this sense, Hölder’s investigations of proof do anticipate Gödel’s methods.\n\n44Hölder’s methodological reflections have a great deal more to offer. I think that Hölder’s methodological remarks belong to the intuitionist tradition. His views are compatible with most of the seven tenets of intuitionist thinking proposed by Tieszen [Tieszen 2005, 228ff.]. A detailed reconstruction of Hölder’s particular brand of intuitionism is still missing."
