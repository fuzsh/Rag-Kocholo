        "text": "Joel, I believe this was first explicitly stated and proved by E.V. Huntington in his classic paper: Complete sets of postulates for the theory of real quantities, Trans. Am. Math. Soc. vol. 4, No. 3 (1903), pp. 358-370. See Theorem II', p. 368.\n\nEdit (June 14, 2020): It is perhaps worth adding that in 1904, the year following the publication of Huntington's paper, O. Veblen published his paper A System of Axioms for Geometry, Trans. Am. Math. Soc. vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 343-384, in which he introduced the idea of a categorical system of axioms. He illustrated his conception with Huntington's above mentioned characterization of the reals (pp. 347-348). No doubt, this is mentioned in the paper referred to below by Ali Enayat.\n\nEDIT (8/27/23)\n\nIn light of the doubts raised by Zvonimir Sikic regarding Huntington being the originator of the idea of a categorical system of axioms, it should be noted that while Huntington was well aware that there existed categorical axiom sets in the literature prior to his isolation of the concept, including those axiom sets mentioned by Sikic, he held the view that the earlier writers neither isolated the idea nor expressed any interest in it. He made this point explicitly as follows in 1913 when he provided a novel categorical characterization of Euclidean geometry.\n\nMore important than the question of independence is the proof of the sufficiency of the postulates to determine a unique type of system; or, to use a phrase of Veblen’s, the proof that the postulates form a categorical set. Little attention seems to have been paid to this question except by the present writer in connection with the foundations of analysis, and by Veblen in connection with the foundations of geometry; and yet there appears to be no other way of proving that all the propositions of a science are deducible from a given set of postulates, than by showing that the postulates form a ‘sufficient' or ‘categorical' set.” (pp. 524-525)\n\n—Huntington, E. V. 1913. “A Set of Postulates for Abstract Geometry, Expressed in Terms of the Simple Relation of Inclusion.” Mathematische Annalen 73 (4):522–59. (pdf from archive.org)\n\nFor what it's worth, David Hilbert was the managing editor of Mathematische Annalen at the time of the publication of Huntington's paper.\n\nEdit: 8/28/23\n\nI should have mentioned in my previous edit, that contrary to Zvonimir Sikic contention, Huntington's paper of 1903 does indeed contain an axiomatization of the ordered field of real numbers as well as a proof of it categorical nature. In Section 2 he provides an axiomatization of the ordered field of real numbers (consisting of 14 axioms including the Dedekind Completeness axiom) and in Theorem II' on page 368 he proves that the axiomatization is categorical.\n\nHilbert's „Über den Zahlbegriff” published in 1900. is the first modern axiomatization of Archimedean fields. To axiomatize R, Hilbert added the maximality axiom (i.e. R is a maximal Archimedean field). He asserted that the existence of the model of the axioms is „nur einer geeigneten Modification bekkanter Schlussmethoden” i.e. „is just a suitable modification of known methods of reasoning”, and uniqueness trivially follows from maximality.\n\nI guess that „bekkanter Schlussmethoden” were the following: If S is an ordered field it contains an isomorphic copy of Q, so let’s call it Q. Every point in S determines a cut in Q. If S is also Archimedean then every cut in Q determines none or one point in S. If S is also maximal then every cut in Q must determine one point in S. Namely, if it doesn’t it could be extended to an Archimedean field with this property, which is by Dedekind construction isomorphic to R. Hence, there is, up to isomorphism, exactly one maximal Archimedean ordered field which is isomorphic to R and every other is, up to isomorphism, contained in R.\n\nThis kind of argument has been well known since the time of Dedekind's „Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen\", i.e. for more than 30 years. Everyone interested in the topic knew the argument, so Hilbert did not consider it necessary to repeat it. This is why I believe that Hilbert proved that maximality uniquely determines R just by stating that the proof is \"a suitable modification of known methods of reasoning\" (even though he didn't actually formulate the result in terms of isomorphism and didn't give the proof himself).\n\nHölder published a more general results in „Die Axiome der Quantität und die Lehre vom Mass” from 1901. He proved, in modern terms, that every continous system of magnitudes is isomorphic to R (it is a trivial corollary that every complete ordered field is isomorphic to R). A continous system of magnitudes was axiomatized with trichotomy, associativity, density, positivity (a < a + b), difference (if a < b then there is c such that a+c= b), and Dedekind's axiom (there is no gaps). In his terminology „there is a [real] measure-number for each given magnitude and there is a magnitude for each given [real] measure-number“ and the correspondence preserves the defining properties. It follows taht „if one has two systems of magnitudes, both fulfilling axioms I to VII, then the systems can be explicitly related to each other such that the sums [and order] of corresponding magnitudes also correspond“.\n\nHuntington, in his „A complete set of postulates for the theory of absolute continuous magnitude“ from 1902, wrote: “The set of postulates adopted in the present paper is nearly the same as the second set of Hölder’s, with the exception that Dedekind's postulate of continuity is here replaced by Weierstrass's”. So, Huntington is not concerned with Archimedean fields but with Hölder's systems of magnitudes. He proved in „Complete Sets of Postulates for the Theory of Real Quantities“ from 1903. that „any two assemblages, M (<, +) and M ' (<, +), which satisfy the [Hölder's] postulates 1-10 are equivalent; that is, they can be brought into one-to-one correspondence in such a way that when a and b in M correspond to a' and b' in M', we shall have, a' < b' whenever a < b and a + b will correspond to a' + b' “.\n\nSo, Huntington proved the categoricity of (R, <, +) in Section 1 of his 1903 paper, as Hölder did in #15 of his 1901 paper. As Philip Ehrlich pointed out, Huntington also proved the categoricity of (R, <, +, x) in section 2 of his 1903 paper, which Hölder apparently did not. So it may seem that Huntington did something more after all. However, in #16 Hölder defined multiplication in (R,<,+) and proved in #17 that it is unique, so there was no need for special treatment of (R, <, +, x).\n\nHence, as far as categoricity is concerned, there is nothing in Huntington's work that we do not already find in Hölder's. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ebbinghaus et. al. in references to the chapter on real numbers and their axiomatization (in their book \"Zahlen\") do not mention Huntington, only Hilbert and Hölder."
