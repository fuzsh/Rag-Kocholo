        "text": "The concept of simple groups is one of the most significant concepts of Group Theory. A group is called simple if it does not possess any proper, non-trivial normal subgroups, and every finite group can be uniquely decomposed into a set of finite simple groups, which are its composition factors. The importance of simple groups lies in the fact that a group can be reconstructed from its composition factors in a certain sense and that the properties of the group depend on the nature of these factors. Furthermore, some questions concerning groups can be reduced to questions about simple groups by induction. For all these reasons, some mathematicians of the 20th century decided to classify finite simple groups, embarking thus on one of the most arduous mathematical endeavours of the time. The search for finite simple groups was completed at the beginning of the 21st century thanks to the substantial contribution of many prominent mathematicians. One of the diverse approaches that were employed with a view to tackling the above objective was the determination of all simple groups with order in a given range of positive integers. The first mathematician known to have adopted this approach was Otto HÃ¶lder followed by Frank Nelson Cole and William Burnside at the end of the 19th century. Their work yields, when combined, the determination of all simple groups with order up to 1,092. The aim of this project is the study of the ideas that led to the above result by means of proving the following theorem Theorem A: Let G be a non-trivial, simple group with order n up to 1,000. If n is not prime, then it belongs to the set {60,168,360,504,660,720}. Note that we have not tried to reproduce the proofs of the aforementioned mathematicians rather than provide our own arguments using modern notation. As for the content of the project, in Chapter 1, we summarise some basic definitions and facts of Group Theory while establishing the notation at the same time. Section 1.2 contains the theorems most frequently used in the rest of the project as well as the proof of the fact that there is no simple group of order p^n where p is any prime number and n is any integer greater than 1. In Chapter 2, we prove Theorem A in three steps. Firstly, in Section 2.1, we exclude 752 numbers of certain prime factorisation forms from being possible orders of simple groups. Additionally, in Section 2.2, we rule out 55 more integers utilising the theorems of the first chapter and, in Section 2.4, we exclude the remaining 18 integers by applying the advanced theorems of Section 2.3. Finally, in the last chapter of the project, we make a brief historical reference to the major breakthroughs that led to the completion of the monumental Classification of Finite Simple Groups in 2008."
