        "text": "Most of the famous 19th century mathematicians have their collected works published and some of them have been digitized. But they are all in the original language. Translations into English are rare. And sometimes they are of poor quality. For example, this translation of Riemann collected papers, or recent translations of Klein and Fricke.\n\nFew works of Gauss have been translated into English. His diaries are translated in Expositiones Mathematicae, 2 (2) (1984) 97–130, but not freely available.\n\nConcerning Euler, there are translation of many mathematical papers, with some of them placed on the arXiv, and there is a web site which collects his original papers and translations.\n\nNothing or almost nothing has been translated of Jacobi.\n\nComplete works of Chebyshev are available in Russian and French. Weierstrass's lectures on elliptic functions are available in German and French.\n\nThere is no single source where you can find all or most of these translations. One has to search for individual books and papers.\n\nHigh quality translation of mathematical papers is extremely difficult and requires a very high qualification of the translator and editors. And many mathematicians can read several European languages. So this business is unprofitable, which explains why there are so few translations into English. Those which exist are frequently done by volunteers/amateurs, and are sometimes of poor quality.\n\nRemark. There are many more high quality translations of old mathematics into Russian, which can be explained by certain peculiarities of the Soviet economy, where high quality labor was available at a negligible price.\n\nAs the many answers already make clear, there is not one dedicated source that collects or archives the work of all the masters. Of course, from your question you get a vague understanding what you consider the masters and the time frame you have in mind. Euler, Gauss, Jacobi, Lagrange, Galois, Cayley, Jordan etc are all masters, but the discussion focused a lot on pre-19th century mathematics. I guess most would consider Neumann, Hilbert and Gödel masters as well.\n\nBut where you draw the line? For example, would you include translations of Yuri Matiyasevich work on Hilbert's 10th problems (originally published in Russian)?\n\nMy point is that having the synopsis to include all the masters is not well-defined, apart from a collection of a bunch of people it gets blurry for others. Should your collection include the work of Otto Hölder, for example? I have not seen him mentioned here, or in any of the linked answers. What about Georg Cantor? Dénes Kőnig? Kuratowski? Paul Erdös? Grothendieck? They all have papers written not in English.\n\nOk, sorry for my ramblings. To contribute anything to your original question I have to mention the one the masters considered their master: Euclid. His Elements is available in many translations, see the links at the end of the wikipedia page.\n\nFurthermore, I often come across single papers that are foundational or were written by, what would I consider, a master. To give a list of some, probably less know, examples:\n\nTwo Papers by Kuratowski:\n\nSur l'Opération A de l'Analysis Situs (in French), see also researchgate.\n\nSur la notion d'ensemble fini\n\nA translation of the original paper written by M. Presburger showing that the first order theory of the natural numbers is decidable.\n\nA translation of G. S. Makanin's 1966 Ph.D. thesis \"On the Identity Problem for Finitely Presented Groups and Semigroups\" (2021). This work showed the decidability of equations in free groups (the algorithm actually yields decidability in free monoids). EDIT: This is actually not correct, see the comment by Carl-Fredrik Nyberg Brodda for a more detailed history..\n\nI found a translation of the original paper stating and proving the Sylow Theorems from Sylow.\n\nTranslation of a paper by Frobenius.\n\nTranslation of a paper by Hölder (unfortunately behind a paywall).\n\nTranslation of an often cited paper on synchronizing automata originally published in Slovak by Černý.\n\nPapers (or here) by Axel Thue who worked on patters in strings.\n\nLastly, Learning via Primary Historical Sources does not contain translations of individual classical papers, but documents that help in reading some of them, even for papers that were originally not published in English.\n\nI only wrote this as a comment on Alexandre Eremenko's answer, but after finding more information I thought I would promote it to a whole answer.\n\nMath-Net.Ru is described in the abstract to [1] (arXiv link) as follows:\n\nThe main goal of the project Math-Net.Ru is to collect scientific publications in Russian and Soviet mathematics journals since their foundation to today and the authors of these publications into a single database and to provide access to full-text articles for broad international mathematical community. Leading Russian mathematics journals have been comprehensively digitized dating back to the first volumes.\n\nIn other words, if you are looking for a paper from a Russian master (e.g. S. I. Adian or A. A. Markov*), then it will likely be there; or, at the very least, its bibliographical information will be.\n\n*The page for A. A. Markov had, until recently, only a handful of articles added. After informing Dmitry Tchebukov, one of the administrators of the site, of this, and sending him a .bib-file with a nearly complete bibliography, he was happy to add these to the site; but not before he had checked each of my entries, and made minor corrections, as well as added a few I had not been able to find! The process seems very rigorous indeed.\n\n[1] Chebukov, Dmitry E.; Izaak, Alexander D.; Misyurina, Olga G.; Pupyrev, Yuri A.; Zhizhchenko, Alexey B., Math-Net.Ru as a digital archive of the Russian mathematical knowledge from the XIX century to today, Carette, Jacques (ed.) et al., Intelligent computer mathematics.
