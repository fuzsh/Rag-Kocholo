        "text": "Otto's best friend and most loved person in the world is Kallen Kaslana. Sadly, she died very young, never fully able to live her life her own way. So he set to bring her back to life, and he tried for 500 years, meanwhile he also protected the world from Honkai. He did many questionable things, but ultimately he's more orally grey rather than a vilain. He ends up sacrificing himself, after testing the main characters to see if they're strong enough to defeat Honkai, to alter the Imaginary Tree, holder of all the timelines, to create new branches where Kallen lives. He doesn't even get to meet her. He gives up his own life so she, in a parallel timeline, can live. The thing is, Kallen canonically falls in love with Yae Sakura, who gets corrupted by the Herrscher in the Black Box and Kallen has to kill her, much to her grief. When she returns to Shicksal, she is imprisoned and senteced to death. Otot tries his best to save her, even a deal with his evil sister Risa, a power hungry woman who stops at nothing to get things her own way, even esperimenting on her own people. Sadly Otto's good intentions backfire, and Kallen dies. He mourn her for long time, before embarking in his centuries long quest to give her back the life he thinks she deserves. The problem is that the fandom is OBSESSED with the ship YaeKallen, and calls Otto a \"lesbianchaser\", a man who goes after a lesbian girl with romantic and/or sexual intentions. But Otto isn't any of that. He never confesses his love to her, nor it's confirmed that it's a romantic kind of love. He's just extremely supportive of her and whever her choices are (aside from the choice to die) In one of the events, Sanka Saga, it's shown pretty well. It's a What If? where Kallen becomes kinda immortal like Otto and for 500 years it's her who tries to revive her lost love, Sakura. Otto doesn't appear directly but he's mentioned as the Shicksal Overseer living in Europe and funding every try Kallen does to revive Sakura. While it's a What If? it's canon that this is what COULD'VE happened. Otto is always show as supportive, like the best wingman ever, helping that Kallen without asking for anything in return, and as long as she's safe, he's perfectly fine with her living abroad (he's in Europe and she's in japan) and being in love with someone else. Not exactly the behavior you'd associate with someone who just want to get together with the girl, isn't it? This is just one instance of the canon facts of the game what get completely ignored in favor of a bashing of Otto. The arguments are always \"You can't like Otto because Kallen is in love with Sakura\" which already makes no sense since Otto fans are not always OttoKallen shippers; \"Otto wants to get together with Kallen\" which is false, as he only proposes her to marry him when she's been condemned to freaking DEATH and that's his LAST attempt to save her life (which she refuses), and he even says that he knows the marriage would be fake and that he's perfectly fine with it being fake as long as she's safe.\n\nAnother argument is that \"he did bad things so he's bad\". Which might be marginally true, but lose all and any valid point when one of the most beloved characters is Sirin. Sirin. Who's the Herrscher on the side of Honkai and tries to exterminate humanity. But since she's a girl, she gets a pass for it and people call her their \"pretty mew mew who did nothing wrong\". This argument can be summarized in: misandry. There's no other explanation. When a gender does something and it's perfectly fine, then another gender does the same thing but that is bad, that's double standard, and it's sexist. In this case, misandrist. Some even started affirming that \"Kallen hates Otto\" when in the very game they claim to love, in one of the \"latest\" chapters (as they came out at the very beginning of this year) we discover a letter Kallen wrote to Otto where she explains that she realizes that her absolute points of view were wrong and that she, too, is a flawed human being. During her time with Sakura, she relizes that what che criticized in Otto, being willing to sacrifice everything else for her, is what she's now doing for Sakura. So, affirming that Kallen hates Otto means that not only they don't know about Kallen and Otto's story, but not even Kallen and Yae's! I posted here the screenshots of that letter so you can read it easily. Otto is not a perfectly good character. In truth, no one is, and that's fine. It's 3D characters that make a story interesting. And his is very interesting. I suggest you to read the manga and play the game, even only the story. Elan Palatinus is the backstory of Kallen and Otto, and it sheds a lot of light on their relationship. In the end, one can dislike Otto, and that's fine. But the amount of hate he got and still gets, the harassment his fans have to suffer, are totally unjustified."
