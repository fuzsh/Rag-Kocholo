Western Command was a command of the British Army.

History[]

The Command was established in 1905 and was originally called the Welsh & Midland Command before changing its name in 1906.[1] In 1907 Western Command relocated to Watergate House in Chester.[2] In 1938, after a brief stay in temporary accommodation at Boughton, it moved to a new purpose-built neo-Georgian property at Queen's Park in Chester.[3]

Among the formations formed in the Command area during the First World War was the 13th (Western) Division, which assembled on Salisbury Plain.

In 1939, under Lieutenant General Robert Haining, the command consisted of Welsh, West Lancashire, and East Lancashire Areas, each commanding two divisions plus other troops.[4] It covered Wales and the Counties of Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Staffordshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Cheshire, and Beachley, Gloucestershire as well as the Isle of Man and the coast defence garrisons of Berehaven, Queenstown and (for the purpose of technical training only) Lough Swilly.[5]

Regular Troops reporting to the Command included:[5]

2nd Bn The Buffs

2nd Anti-Aircraft Brigade

The Command was merged into HQ UK Land Forces (HQ UKLF) in 1972 and the property handed over to the Royal Army Pay Corps.[3] It was effectively downgraded to district status, and later Wales and Western districts were established to take over the command's area.
