        "text": "Recognition of faculty endeavor and achievement has always been a priority of the university and duly notes the contributions made by faculty in support of enhanced scholastic opportunities and engaged development of the region. In 2003, the Faculty Recognition Banquet was initiated to reflect on and celebrate many of the outstanding accomplishments of Murray State Faculty. Dr. Terry Strieter, Faculty Regent, and Dr. Gary Brockway, Provost, worked with Mr. Jim Carter and Dr. Don Robertson, Vice Presidents, to transition the official acknowledgement of various faculty accolades to a single university event. The Faculty Recognition Banquet has become an Murray State tradition supported by alumni, faculty, and students. The following awards sponsored by Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, and the Murray State Alumni Association are acknowledged at the annual event held the third Thursday of April during the campus’s Scholars Week celebration.\n\nMurray State Alumni Association Emerging Scholar Award\n\nEach year, the Research Policy Committee selects two recipients of the Murray State Alumni Association Emerging Scholar Award. This award recognizes superior research, scholarly, or creative work conducted by Murray State University faculty members who are in the early phase of their careers and who show professional promise. Significant achievements associated with the nomineeʼs work should have been realized while the nominee has held a faculty position at the University. Two prizes will be awarded: one in the area of science, technology and mathematics, the second in the area of the arts, literature, humanities, and social sciences. Each Emerging Scholar receives a $500 cash award, and the researcher’s name is engraved on the Murray State Alumni Association Emerging Scholar Award plaque located in the Murray State Alumni Center.\n\nLearn more and view past recipients"
