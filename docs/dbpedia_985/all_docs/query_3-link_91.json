That's the case with HBO's \"House of the Dragon,\" which just wrapped its second season — with a cliffhanger, of course — and the third season likely won't be back until 2026. The first season premiered in 2022, so it looks like we're on pace for the fourth and final season to come in 2028.\n\nCo-host Terry Lipshetz gives his thoughts on the series after he and Bruce Miller talk about the ongoing Olympics in Paris, and also shares his frustration over shows taking too much time between seasons. While AppleTV+ has a second season of \"Silo\" coming soon, there are much larger gaps for upcoming second seasons for \"Shrinking\" and \"Severance.\"\n\nBruce also talks about the new movie from M. Night Shyamalan, \"Trap,\" and the mixed success the director has had from the breakout \"The Sixth Sense\" to the more disappointing \"The Happening.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nWe also preview James Cameron's latest project, \"OceanXplorers,\" which is coming to National Geographic on Aug. 18. The miniseries will feature six episodes and the latest project for the Oscar-winning \"Titanic\" director. Bruce has an interview with Aldo Kane and Eric Stackpole, who talk about the series.\n\nContact us!\n\nWe want to hear from you!
