        "text": "Black Loch (also known as Castle Loch) is a famous lake in the north of Sodor near Callan Castle, crossed by Castle Loch Causeway. It is located in Misty Valley.[1]\n\nHistory\n\nBlack Loch is a rugged and fantastical area. Long ago, Godred the Impaler was based here and inhabited the nearby Callan Castle, which overlooks the loch. It is believed that the surrounding area is haunted by him to this day. Whenever the engines have an accident here, they all blame it on Godred.[2]\n\nDonald and Douglas got trapped here whilst taking a heavy goods train to Callan Castle. They were soon rescued by Harvey (whom they initially mistook for the Loch Ness monster).[1]\n\nJames was originally given the passenger run, but was replaced by Emily when she was late with the flour train once too often. At first, the engines were worried about the route, as it was rumoured that the loch was occupied by a monster and that boulders would bash engines' buffers. When Emily took the Black Loch run, however, she learned that the monster was actually a family of seals, so the engines now enjoy taking this route.[3]\n\nAppearances\n\nTrivia\n\nWhile not mentioned by name on-screen until the seventh series, the first known use of the name \"Black Loch\" is on the 1991 map of Sodor created for the third series, where it is shown to be on an extension to Toby's Branch Line north of Marthwaite and Arlesdale End.\n\nOn the 2014 map of Sodor by former Railway Consultant Sam Wilkinson, the loch is placed on a separate branch line east of Peel Godred.\n\nThe Black Loch monster is based on the legendary Loch Ness monster (alternatively known as Nessie).\n\nThe Black Loch Folly used to be on display at Drayton Manor Theme Park.\n\nWhile Black Loch does not make a physical appearance in the CGI series, portraits of Emily at Black Loch from the eight series episode Emily's New Route can be seen, at Maithwaite, Maron, in Sir Topham Hatt's Office and in the car park behind Knapford station.\n\nMerchandise\n\nBachmann (discontinued)\n\nTomica (discontinued)\n\nStation Guide\n\nSam Wilkinson Map\n\nPreceding station North Western Railway Following station Callan Misty Valley Branch Line Callan Castle"
