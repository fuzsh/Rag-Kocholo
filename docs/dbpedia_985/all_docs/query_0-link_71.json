        "text": "Recent research has significantly advanced our understanding of nature’s most efficient catalysts for hydrogen production, the [FeFe]-hydrogenases ( ).1 First, the mixed-valence Hox state has been replicated with synthetic models providing a coordinatively unsaturated model featuring a vacant coordination site on the distal iron, approximately trans to the Fe–Fe vector.2,3 Second, unsymmetrically substituted diiron dithiolatotetracarbonyls have been shown to protonate at a single Fe site to afford terminal hydrides that have been characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy at low temperatures (~−75 °C).4 The protonation at a single Fe center conforms to a mechanism whereby proton reduction, hydrogen oxidation, and CO inhibition all occur via substrate binding at a single site on the distal Fe. In this paper, we describe results that support the single-site hypothesis for hydrogenogenesis by examining factors that influence the stability and reactivity of terminal hydrides.\n\nOur starting complexes are the recently described diiron(I) dithiolates Fe2(S2CnH2n)(CO)2(dppv)2 [n = 2 (1), 3 (2); dppv = cis-1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethene].5 With four phosphine ligands, these diiron dithiolato complexes are basic in both Lewis and, as we show, Brønsted senses. The Fe2 complexes are protonated by HBF4 · Et2O at room temperature to afford the expected bridging hydrides [Fe2(S2CnH2n)(μ-H)(CO)2(dppv)2]+, [1μH]+ and [2μH]+. One isomer of the propanedithiolato derivative, [2μH]BF4, was characterized crystallographically, which established the location of the μ-hydrido ligand (Supporting Information).\n\nWhen 1 and 2 were protonated at low temperatures, we observed high-field 1H NMR signals characteristic of hydrides (for [1H]BF4, δ −6.1, t, JPH = 74 Hz; for [2H]BF4, δ −3.5, t, JPH = 78 Hz).4,6 These kinetic products were observed to isomerize to the μ-hydrido isomers upon warming. The ethanedithiolate, [1H]+, isomerized in minutes even at −20 °C to [1μH]+, whereas the propanedithiolate [2H]+, derivative proved more stable (t1/2 ~ 10 min at 20 °C). The slower isomerization of the propanedithiolate (pdt) derivative is ascribable to the steric clash between dppv and the middle methylene group of pdt, which inhibits rotation of the FeH(CO)(dppv) site (eq 1).7\n\nThe isomerization of the terminal [2H]+ to the bridging [2μ]+ hydride proceeds via a first-order pathway (k = 1 × 10−3 s−1, 25 °C) and was unaffected by solvent polarity or the presence of CO. These findings are indicative of an intramolecular process, consistent with isomerization kinetics previously reported.6 The temperature dependence of the rates indicate ΔH‡ = 80 kJ/mol and ΔS‡ = −23 J/mol K, also consistent with an intramolecular process that proceeds without ligand dissociation.\n\nIn light of the lability of the tetracarbonyl hydrides recently described by Schollhammer et al.,4 our results suggest that the stability of the terminal hydride (vs the bridging hydride) depends mainly on the basicity of the Fe2 center. The electronic asymmetry of the Fe2 unit also plays a role because terminal hydrides have been detected for the protonation of unsymmetrical Fe2(S2C3H6)(CO)4(PR3)2 isomers but not yet for the corresponding symmetrical isomers.\n\nMethylene chloride solutions of [2H]+ are unreactive toward HOTf, showing no tendency to evolve H2, nor did the FeH group exchange with CD3OD over the course of 3 h. In contrast, the more basic trimethylphosphine derivative [HFe2(S2C2H4)(μ-CO)(CO)(PMe3)4]+ (νCO = 1940 and 1874 cm−1 in CH3CN solution) reacts with HBF4 in CH3CN to afford H2.6 On the basis of νCO, [2H]BF4 is the better spectroscopic model for the Hred state of the enzyme (observed: 1964 (s) and 1905 (m) cm−1 vs Hred for D.d.:81965, 1916, and 1894 cm−1).\n\nCyclic voltammetric (CV) studies (CH2Cl2 solution, 0 °C, vs Ag/AgCl) show that the terminal hydride [2H]BF4 reduces at ~200 mV milder than the isomeric bridging hydride [2μH]BF4 ( ). The reduction current (ip,c) for [2H]BF4 in a CH2Cl2 solution displayed a first-order dependence on [HBF4], indicative of proton reduction catalysis. For catalytic proton reduction involving [2H]BF4, we propose the catalytic cycle depicted in . Reduction of [2H]BF4 is a 1e− process as indicated by the similarity of the dependence of ip vs υ1/2 for both [2H]BF4 and its conjugate base 2, which we have established undergoes a 1e− oxidation to 2+ (the recently described model of Hox).9 At 0 °C, the [2H]+/0 couple is reversible even at scan rates as slow as 25 mV/s, which implies that the reduced hydride has a half-life of at least several seconds at this temperature. The pathway for hydrogenogenesis therefore entails protonation of the mixed-valence hydride [2H]0. We can estimate the pKa of [2H]0 by the strength of the acids that render the [2H]+/0 couple irreversible. For these CV titrations, we used phosphonium acids, for which Morris has established a pKa scale for CD2Cl2 solutions.10 In the presence of [HPPh2Me]BF4 (pKCD2Cl2 = 3.3), the [2H]+/0 couple was reversible; however, the couple became irreversible with the slightly stronger acid [HPPh3]BF4 (pK CD2Cl2 ~ 1.6). These experiments show that reduction of [2H]+ increases the basicity of the iron hydride by at least five pK CD2Cl2 units ([2H]+ is unreactive toward HBF4, pK CD2Cl2 ~ −4.7). Tilset et al. have reported that redox-state changes can change the acidity of hydrides by more than 20 pKa units in monometallic complexes.11\n\nAccording to our proposed mechanism, the reduced species [2H]0 undergoes protonation to release H2, affording 2+. Under the conditions of the experiment, 2+ would be reduced to 2, completing the cycle.3 The isomeric bridging hydride [2μH]+ also catalyzes proton reduction catalysis but at potentials more negative by 200 mV.\n\nThe azadithiolate Fe2[(SCH2)2NH](CO)2(dppv)2 (3) also undergoes protonation at −40 °C to give a terminal hydride [3H]+ (δ −4.2, t, JPH = 73 Hz). The stereochemistry of the protonation, indicated by the 1H and 31P NMR data, again places the hydride in an apical site adjacent to the amine and cis to the phosphine ligands. For the related systems, Fe2[(SCH2)2NAr](CO)6−x(PR3)x, N-protonation occurs rapidly,12 which suggests that [3H]+ arises via migration of the proton from N to Fe.\n\nCompound [3H]+ isomerized to the bridging hydride in seconds at 0 °C, faster than [2H]+ but more slowly than [1H]+. As for [2H]+, CD2Cl2 solutions of [3H]+ do not exchange with CD3OD during the course of the isomerization. Double protonation of 3 with H(Et2O)2BArF4 (selected because it can be accurately weighed) occurred readily to give the terminal hydride bearing an adjacent ammonium center, [3H2][BArF4]2. This species was characterized by 1H NMR (high field), 31P NMR, and IR (νCO region) spectroscopies. The protonated derivatives of 3 can be accessed by selective deprotonation of [3H2]2+ ( ).\n\nMonoiron hydrides exchange intramolecularly with adjacent ammonium centers,13 but the rate depends on the relative basicities of the amine and the FeH centers. In [3H2][BArF4]2, the ammonium center is highly acidic, being deprotonated even by MeOD. The ammonium hydride [3H2]2+ is stable in a CH2Cl2 solution but released H2 when the protonation was conducted in a MeCN solution. The acid–base properties of 3 are clearly sensitive to the medium14 and will be explored more fully in a future report. Preliminary CV experiments indicate that [3H]+ is a better catalyst than [2H]+, in terms of both kinetics and thermodynamics, but its thermal lability complicates the electrochemical measurements.\n\nIn summary, this work supports the following mechanistic features for the production of H2 by these models for [FeFe]-hydrogenases:"
