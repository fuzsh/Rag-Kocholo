        "text": "Finding my Adventure Journey was not easy. I wanted to find something that I was able to do but was also a challenge. My sister, Liz, looked at cycling for the disabled in the Peak District in England, but I decided that I would not have to do much as most of the pedalling would have to done by a companion. Out of the blue, I was contacted by Belfast Lough Sailability in Carrickfergus. Sailability is an organisation which promotes sailing for people with disabilities. I had sailed with them for several years, but this summer they had received funding to organise a certified sailing course. The organiser, Geraldine Duggan, asked me if I would be interested and I said yes, immediately. The course was held in July over five days (Monday to Friday), mornings or afternoons. I chose afternoon, as I could do a stretching exercise programme to help me sit for the two and a half hours of the course.\n\nI sailed on a Hawk 20 called Arica, another called Tamarind and on the Sea Rover. My mum came with me to take notes and also, when there was not special seating, to help me balance. I learnt what to do before setting sail:\n\nCheck the forecast, especially the wind strength.\n\nCheck the tides as the first three hours and last three hours are the strongest in a twelve hour period.\n\nCheck life jackets are working properly; know where the manual cord is: check all have gas cylinders: they have to be serviced every two years.\n\nCheck that clothing worn is appropriate: bring sun cream and water.\n\nWhen on board before sailing, check the contents of the safety box. It should contain an emergency blanket, first aid, kill cord and flares.\n\nWhen sailing with others, it is important to answer instructions by saying ready. At sea, we were told that we should consider the following:\n\nBoat trim look up and set sails according to the wind.\n\nSail trim small movement to keep sails trim. Tell tales should be at right angles. Tell tales are ribbons on sails.\n\nBoat balance look down and check that boat is flat.\n\nWe learnt how to read the tides, winds and currents and to adjust the sails accordingly.\n\nI was able to use my hearing (which is very good) to listen to the sound of the sea and be able to identify the currents and tides. Sailors call ropes sheets. It is very important that there are no knots in them as then they would not run smoothly. Some sheets are used to unfurl the sails e.g. the jib sheet unfurls the jib sail. To make things simpler, each sheet is a different colour, but there is no standard so this can vary. Sheets are very important as you cant raise a sail without one. My job was to check that the sheets had no knots. We learnt what the sails were for and how to set them, e.g. a jib is for turning and a main sail is for power. The main (large) sail is winched up by the halyard (a type of sheet) first, right up to the top of the mast to raise it up and then the jib (small) is unfurled and raised.\n\nOne day, I realised that I could sit independently for a short time because I could balance myself and correct my position, if necessary. I had not been able to do this before.\n\nWe were told easy ways to remember what to do, e.g:\n\nA floppy sail is not a happy sail.\n\nBring it in to make it grin.\n\nWe sailed on Belfast Lough where we saw ferries and large ships. There is a special channel for them. Even though it was July and even though it was warmish on dry land, it could be quite cold at sea so we had to dress warmly. One day, it had rained in the morning and when I was winched into my seating position on the boat with my mum beside me, I realised that I was sitting in a pool of water. This got colder as the afternoon went on but I was having such fun that I did not mind. Joanne who was in the clubhouse always had a cup of tea for us when the session finished.\n\nOn one of my sessions, Mike McNeice came and took photos. I was delighted when I saw the photos as they showed what I did. Thanks, Mike. I am very grateful to Lex, Jenna and all the other instructors for their patience. I really learnt a lot and would love to do another course in 2017, if Sailability get funding.\n\nOn the last day, I was awarded a certificate. This was great! Thank you, everyone in Belfast Lough Sailability.\n\nThomass Adventure Journey is extracted from his full Gold Gaisce Award Portfolio, which is a must read. You can read and download it as a PDF file at the following link: gold-gaisce-award-portfolio-thomas-bruton-november-2016\n\nElizabeth Black\n\nElizabeth and Barnaby (BBC Northern Ireland)\n\nI was delighted to be asked if I would be interested in joining Belfast Lough Sailability about 6 or 7 years ago. When I went along with my Assistance Dog, Barnaby, we were made most welcome. I started learning to sail in a Hansa 303 – a small two-seater sailing boat which was specially designed to enable people with paraplegia to sail competitively. They are a very popular boat and BLS now has six. It was a great thrill when I was deemed safe enough to be asked to take a visitor out for their first sail! Barnaby always comes with me and sits at my feet. He has a red life jacket and always comes running up to me when he sees his life jacket in my hand, because he knows he is coming too. Sometimes if children are reluctant to put their life jacket on, once they see Barnaby in his, they are usually willing to follow suit!\n\nWe have all sorts of opportunities in Belfast Lough Sailability: after doing the necessary training I have become a Disability Awareness Instructor. All our volunteers are offered Disability Awareness Training and this is a good opportunity to get to know our new members.\n\nIn 2014 a team went to Galway to the Hansa 303 Championships and to Kinsale to the first Presidents Cup Competitions. A great time was had by all.\n\nEvery opportunity is taken to celebrate a special occasion with a party or BBQ, either the launching a new boat or celebrating some of our members qualifying as RYA instructors – and even birthdays. We all look forward to our annual dinner, usually in March. There is always much fun and laughter.\n\nBelfast Lough Sailability is an amazing organisation everyone, no matter what their disability, is welcome, and everyone, even people using a power wheelchair, can get out on Belfast Lough in a boat. Our Sea Rover has a special drop down ramp to facilitate easy boarding and gives people the chance to see Carrickfergus from the Lough and to see sea birds and seals. (I, myself, use a power wheelchair and can be lifted so easily with a hoist into whatever boat I am going out in.)\n\nPlease do come down and meet us this summer and have an outing in one of our boats you will be very welcome.\n\nOwen Murray\n\nThe Murrays (Gillian McAdam)\n\nMy family have been coming to Belfast Lough Sailability in Carrickfergus for nearly a year. I was really pleased to see how welcoming and family oriented BLS are. On our first visit, all five of us, myself, Diane and the three boys, were invited to go out on the boats. So we climbed on board Sea Rover and left the marina and motored along the shore front for about half an hour before returning to the marina and taking to a Hawk sailing boat.\n\nOne of my sons, Aled, is nine years old and a wheelchair user. He is learning how to sail in one of the Hansa 303s, an incredibly stable training boat. He is hoping to participate in the Hansa Championship Gala at the beginning of August. Aled enjoys sharing the Hansa with a volunteer crew member on Saturday mornings which he finds very relaxing.\n\nCaeden is six with ASD and is happiest when he is sailing in one of the Hawks. Sailing provides him with all the sensory input that he craves, from the noise of the sails filling, the shimmering reflection of the light on the water and the pitch and roll of the boat, particularly when it picks up a bit of speed. Caeden really enjoys hanging his arm over the side of the boat to trail his hand through the water.\n\nSailing with BLS provides a wonderful family activity for a couple of hours on a Wednesday evening and Saturday morning and it is all made possible by the extremely generous, dedicated and patient volunteers."
