        "text": "Dental Expert & Magic Enthusiast\n\nGet To Know Dr. John G. McRoberts\n\nDr. John McRoberts joined Clemson Family Dentistry in July of 2000. As a local, he graduated from Seneca High School where he met his high school sweetheart, Kelly. He obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in biology with a minor in chemistry, graduating Summa Cum Laude from The College of Charleston. He then attained a Doctor of Dental Medicine degree from The Medical University of South Carolina. Upon graduation, he was anxious to return to his roots in upstate South Carolina, where he has been practicing ever since.\n\nDr. McRoberts enjoys spending time with his wife, Kelly, and their children, AJ and Peyton. They have enjoyed spending time on the lakes in the area and traveling around the country â Dr. Mac is trying to see a MLB game at each of the stadiums with his son (only 5 more to go!). He is active in his church and has been serving on the finance committee, youth committee, and even steps in as one of the middle school teachers on Sundays. He and his wife love the South Carolina State Dance, The Shag, and enjoy cutting the rug as a member in the Oconee Assembly.\n\nDr. McRoberts is a big supporter of youth activities in our area.Â As a magic enthusiast, he gives âa little magic, a little teethâ lectures to preschools and elementary schools around the area. (Feel free to contact the office to schedule one for your school!) He also supports local YMCA teams, recreational team sports, Blue Ridge Golf programs, and middle and high school teams from surrounding schools, knowing that these participants are tomorrowâs leaders. He also enjoys supporting Collins Family Ministries and the Boy Scouts. (Dr. Mac is an Eagle Scout!)\n\nDr. McRoberts is a huge Clemson supporter and attends many of the different sporting events with his family and friends. You will always see him wearing orange on Thursdays at the office to show his Tiger Pride. He has been the official Clemson Tiger Dentist for the last several years, helping out with students, trainers, coaches, etc. when the need arises. He also works very close to the biology and health science depts., bringing students in on a regular basis for shadowing opportunities. He is a Preceptor for Interns in the health science department and one of the teachers in the pre-dental class of the biology curriculum.\n\nProfessionally, Dr. McRoberts is a member of the Academy of General Dentistry, Academy of Oral Medicine, the American Dental Association, South Carolina Dental Association, and Tri-County Dental Society where he has served as Secretary/Treasurer, Vice President, and President. Dr. McRobertsÂ has been on the advisory board of the dental assisting program at Tri-County Technical College for over a decade. He and his team stay above and beyond that which is required for continuing education in order to provide their patients with the most up-to-date care in general dentistry. Dr. McRoberts looks forward to working with you to achieve the smile and oral health you desire in the most friendly and conservative way possible. By the way, he loves to share a good joke when youâre visiting!\n\nAward Winning Care\n\nGet To Know Dr. Emily Martin Ewoldt\n\nDr. Emily Ewoldt is a Clemson native, having lived in downtown Clemson since she was three years old. She grew up attending Morrison/Clemson Elementary School, R.C. Edwards Middle School, and she is a graduate of D.W. Daniel High School.\n\nDr. Emily graduated from Clemson University and the Calhoun Honors College with a Bachelor of Science degree in public health science. During her senior year of college, she interned with Clemson Family Dentistry, and it was because of Dr. McRoberts and the team at CFD that she fell in love with dentistry.Â\n\nDr. Emily completed her Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degree at the Medical University of South Carolina. She is an avid supporter of organized dentistry and served as President of the American Student Dental Association during dental school, the student governing body of the College of Dental Medicine. Through this, she was honored as the 2016 District 4 Delegate of the Year and received the Excellence in Leadership award in 2017. Both of these distinctions honor one student among the over 500 dental students in our region for leadership and dedication to dentistry. In addition, she spent several weeks in Ecuador and Peru serving on dental mission trips through a ministry at MUSC, called The Dental Community Fellowship.\n\nRecently, Dr. Emily was named a 2021 Clemson University Roaring 10 honoree. Each year, the Clemson Young Alumni Council recognizes ten outstanding individuals for their impact in business, leadership, community, educational, and/or philanthropic endeavors. The honor is given to those individuals who exemplify Clemson Universityâs core values of honesty, integrity, and respect.\n\nDr. Emily married her husband, Nathan, in June of 2020 and welcomed their daughter, Charlotte, in March 2022. They, along with Dr. Emily's family, reside in Clemson. She is active in the Rotary Club of Clemson, the Tri-County Dental Society, South Carolina Dental Association, American Dental Association, and Academy of General Dentistry.\n\nIn her free time, Dr. Emily and her family like to attend any and all Clemson sporting events, take their dogs to the lake, and go hiking â anything outdoors! Having lived in Charleston for over four years, she enjoys trying new foods and restaurants. (She is a self-proclaimed taste tester so feel free to ask for recommendations!)\n\nDr. Emily sincerely believes that there is something intangible about Clemson â the people, the landscape, the community. It is the cornerstone of who she is, and she is excited to give back to the place that raised her. She is committed to providing quality, personalized care with kindness, sincerity, and trust.\n\nCompassionate & Understanding\n\nGet To Know Dr. Nathan J. Ewoldt\n\nDr. Nathan Ewoldt was drawn to the field of dentistry from a young age. Born with a rare tooth condition, he considered the dental office to be a second home. He has spent countless hours as the patient and knows what it feels like to spend time in the dental chair. He feels tremendous gratitude in being able to guide patients through their own dental journey.\n\nDr. Nathan earned his doctorate from the Medical University of South Carolina and then completed advanced post-graduate training at Prisma Health where he served as the chief resident. He graduated top of his class from Clemson University and the University of South Carolina. While completing his dental degree, Dr. Nathan was the Vice President of the American Student Dental Association and served on mission trips to Peru and Ecuador. He has also volunteered his time at several free dental clinics across the state.\n\nHe holds a passion for lifelong learning and is well on his way to achieving fellowship status in the Academy of General Dentistry. An accolade held by only the top 6% of dentists in the United States. Dr. Nathan is also an active member of the American Dental Association, South Carolina Dental Association, and Tri-County Dental Society.\n\nDr. Nathan is from Roanoke, Virginia and the mountains have always held a special place in his heart. When not in the office, he and Dr. Emily keep busy chasing after their toddler, Charlotte. They also have two dogs named Sampson, a sweet golden retriever, and Penny, a stubborn bulldog. On the weekends, they enjoy getting outdoors, attending Clemson sporting events, and are active members of Fort Hill Presbyterian Church."
