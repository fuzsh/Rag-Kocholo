        "text": "The Department of Physics at Syracuse University has been educating students and carrying out research for over 125 years. Our faculty members, research associates, graduate students, and undergraduate majors are active in fields ranging from biological and condensed matter physics, through cosmology and particle physics, to gravitational wave detection and astrophysics. Physics attempts to understand how the world works; from the very small scales inside the nucleus of an atom to the very largest scales in the Universe; from the behavior of the most basic constituents of matter to the rich and diverse phenomena that arise when many simple components interact together. We have internationally recognized research groups working in all of these areas; from soft condensed matter and biological physics to elementary particle physics and cosmology and the search for gravitational waves This page contains all publications submitted to SURFACE written by students, faculty, and staff in the department.\n\nFollow\n\nindex\n\n2018 2018\n\nPDF\n\nStatistical Mechanics of thermalized ribbons and sheets, SOURAV SANJUKTA BHABESH\n\nPDF\n\nDynamically Triangulated Quantum Gravity in Three Dimensions, Cameron Chevalier\n\nPDF\n\nRheology and Collective Behavior in Living Tissue, Michael David Czajkowski\n\nPDF\n\nMuon/Pion separation using Convolutional Neural Networks for the MicroBooNE Charged Current Inclusive Cross Section Measurement., Jessica Nicole Esquivel\n\nEarly Universe Constraints from Primordial Black Holes and Cosmological Limits on Quantum Mechanics, Julian Sebastian Georg\n\nMeasurements of Beauty Production Cross-Sections and Fragmentation Ratios using the LHCb Detector, Matthew Kelsey\n\nInterpretation methods for complex and low quality DNA profiles, Michael A.
