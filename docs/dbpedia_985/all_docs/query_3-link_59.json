        "text": "The Preservation Alliance of West Virginia celebrated the people making positive changes to their communities through historic preservation on April 27, 2024. The annual West Virginia Historic Preservation Awards Banquet was held at the Senator's Mansion, a Queen Anne Victorian Home nestled on 2.5 acres of beautiful creekside land in Mannington.\n\n2024 west virginia historic preservation award recipients\n\nExcellent AmeriCorps Award : Lee Maddex, Morgantown\n\nLee Maddex is in his third service term with Preserve WV AmeriCorps. During his two years of service with the Morgantown History Museum, Lee overhauled their archives and digitized thousands of photographs and documents now accessible to the public. He worked with volunteers to maintain the museum, increase interpretation, and engage visitors. This term, Lee switched sites to the West Virginia & Regional History Center to help finish processing and archiving the Institute of Historical Technology and Industrial Archaeology Collection. Lee has dedicated his life to preserving and documenting several key historic resources in and around Monongalia County, including the Henry Clay Furnace at Coopers Rock State Forest. Last year, he brought 25 volunteers together to clean the trail to the furnace. Lee has also worked on several nominations for the National Register of Historic Places, including the Virginia Furnace of Preston, Co., and also written several articles for e-WV such as the Henry Clay Furnace, Shenandoah Bloomery and La Belle Ironworks.\n\nVolunteer Award: Marcella Yaremchuk, Fairmont\n\nMarcella Yaremchuk is a deeply dedicated volunteer to the maintenance and historicpreservation of the Maple Grove Cemetery, a 20-acre cemetery in Fairmont, WV holding the graves of over 300 veterans dating back to as far of the Revolutionary War.\n\n​Some of Marcella’s most recent historicpreservation initiatives for the cemetery include organizing the Wreaths Across America annual celebration, fundraising for signage at the entrance, and clean up at the cemetery for landscaping and resetting fallen stones. She is being recognized for her vital role in safeguarding the stories, heritage, and sacred resting places of past generations, ensuring that their memory remains honored and accessible to future ones.​\n\nHeritage Tourism Award: Loving WV, Fairmont\n\nLoving West Virginia is a West Virginia-themed merchandising company dedicated to reminding West Virginians about their roots. Owned and operated by Evan and Evan-Nicole Chapman, their motto is “no matter how many miles away you are from the state you will always be a West Virginian.” They help bring people to the state to tour our heritage sites through their merchandise and promotion of all things West Virginia. They have actively engaged in historic preservation and heritage tourism.\n\n​After years of selling on the internet and in other retailers, Loving WV purchased the 1904 West Virginia Times Building in downtown Fairmont to use as their storefront and headquarters. In March 2023, they completed, with the City and Main Street Fairmont as partners, the installation of a new mural in downtown Fairmont that showcases the best of the Mountain State.\n\nHistoric Preservation Media Award: Robert and Shannon Tinnell, Morgantown\n\nRobert and Shannon Tinnell’s multifaceted contributions to cultural preservation - spanning literature, film, comic strips, and culinary arts. They have played an instrumental role in safeguarding the rich tapestry of traditions that define the region. In 2005, Marion County native Robert “Bob” Tinnell published his graphic novel “Feast of the Seven Fishes” based on his experiences growing up in an Italian-American family, specifically the Christmas Eve tradition of the same name that consists of a meatless meal with several seafood courses.\n\n​The next year, Tinnell and his wife, Shannon Colaianni Tinnell, collaborated with Main Street Fairmont and the community to organize the first Feast of the Seven Fishes Festival in Fairmont, an event that has continued and attracts thousands each year. Additionally, Robert is the director of the award-winning film, “Feast of the Seven Fishes”, based on the same concept of the graphic novel, and Shannon is the author of “A Culinary History of West Virginia: From Ramps to Pepperoni Rolls” & “Morgantown (Then and Now)”.\n\nBest Use of Historic Tax Credits & Partnerships Award: Woodlands Development & Lending as lead for the Tygart Hotel Project, Elkins\n\nIn March, the Tygart Hotel in downtown Elkins reopened following an $18 million historicpreservation project spearheaded by Woodlands Development & Lending, with Sandy Bennett as Project Manager. This complex redevelopment project utilized historic tax credits and financing from Davis Trust Company, Pendleton Community Bank, and Freedom Bank. The boutique hotel, part of Choice Hotels’ Ascend Hotel Collection, features 56 hotel rooms, restaurant, bar, event space and local art throughout the hotel. The effort to bring the Tygart Hotel back to life was part of a larger goal of improving downtown Elkins, with planning beginning in 2015.\n\n​The building, constructed in 1907, had fallen into disrepair. The design for the renovation was completed by Mills Group, LLC. The Tygart Hotel is a catalytic, transformative project preserving the architectural heritage of Elkins while revitalizing the cultural heartbeat of the community.\n\nMost Significant Save of a Historic Property: Monongahela National Forest and HistoriCorps for the Blue Bend Recreation Area & Pavilion Project, Greenbrier County\n\nThe Blue Bend Recreation Area of the Monongahela National Forest, located near Frankford in Greenbrier County, includes a picnic pavilion, over 20 camping sites, an elaborate system of retaining walls, two-stoned paved beaches, and a reservoir for recreational swimming. The Blue Bend Recreation Area was built by the CCC in the 1930s and was added to the National Register of Historic Places 30 years ago. The park is part of the legacy of noted forest recreation planner Herbert T. Stoddard. In 2023, the Mon Forest partnered with HistoriCorps, the Appalachian Conservation Corps and 20 volunteers to make critical repairs to the deteriorated pavilion, including roof repairs, flagstone repairs and repointing. Other projects included critical floor replacement of the Administrative building. In September 2024, HistoriCorps will return to the Blue Bend Recreation Area to complete the roof on the pavilion and perform minor carpentry and log repairs. This award recognizes their most recent efforts to save the deteriorating historic picnic pavilion and celebrate their dedication to rehabilitating historic recreational structures in West Virginia.\n\nMichael Gioulis Downtown Preservation Award: Main Street Fairmont\n\nMain Street Fairmont is an excellent example of community development and historicpreservation. Through unwavering dedication to the principles of the National Main Street Center’s 4-Point Approach, Main Street Fairmont has transformed its downtown into a vibrant hub of activity.\n\n​Their commitment to promoting community events is illustrated by initiatives like the Feast of the Seven Fishes, which showcases the town's cultural heritage while invigorating local businesses. Their Facade Grant Program has breathed new life into historic storefronts, preserving architectural features that define the town. The establishment of the Hometown Market has provided residents with access to fresh, locally sourced goods and fostered a sense of community pride. Main Street Fairmont's strategic investment in key downtown buildings demonstrates their long-term vision and dedication to sustainable growth. We applaud Main Street Fairmont for their outstanding contributions to urban revitalization and for setting a standard of excellence for communities nationwide.\n\nRodney Collins Preservation Achievement Award: Susan Pierce, Charleston\n\nSusan Pierce is the Deputy State HistoricPreservation Officer (DSHPO) with the WV State HistoricPreservation Office (WV SHPO). During her 30-year tenure, Susan has been a pillar of stability and leadership for historicpreservation statewide. Early in her tenure, she oversaw the Certified Local Government program, educational efforts, and the Section 106 review process. A decade later, she assumed the role of DSHPO.\n\nSusan has made significant contributions towards advancing historicpreservation efforts in West Virginia, administering five National Park Service grants and a Save America’s Treasures grant that resulted in an archaeological collections facility for the Grave Creek Mound Archaeological Complex. She helped to develop two statewide heritage trails - the New Deal/CCC Trail and the WVHistoric Theatre Trail. Through her leadership, the office published two editions of “Historic West Virginia”, a book which includes brief descriptions of every National Register property and district in the state. Susan has proven time and time again a passion for West Virginia’s historic resources and preserving the state’s cultural landscape.\n\nBob Weir Craftsperson Award: Wallace Eugene “Geno” Johnson, Tunnelton\n\nGeno Johnson is an exemplary craftsman, now retired after a career working with Allegheny Restoration & Builders. His unwavering commitment to historicpreservation has left an indelible mark on countless preservation projects across West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Geno is known for his unparalleled craftsmanship and work ethic, being the first to arrive on the jobsite every morning, the first back from lunch, and the last to leave at day's end. His meticulous attention to detail was instrumental in preserving many architectural treasures and ensuring their use for future generations.\n\n​Geno’s work included the Hotel Morgan (Morgantown, WV); Preston Academy (Kingwood, WV); “The Mount” – Edith Wharton’s Home (Lenox, MA); Antietam National Battlefield (Sharpsburg, MD); West Virginia State Capitol Complex (Charleston, WV); Holly Grove (Charleston, WV); Lost Creek B&O Railroad Depot (Lost Creek, WV); Oakland B&O Station (Oakland, MD); ; Kings Covered Bridge (Somerset, PA); Simpson Creek Covered Bridge (Bridgeport, WV); Fletcher Creek Covered Bridge (Clarksburg, WV); and Hokes Mill Covered Bridge (Greenbrier County, WV). We celebrate Geno Johnson’s work as a testament to the power of labor and the value of preserving historic structures.\n\nDr. Emory Kemp Lifetime Achievement Award: Paul & Mary Lindquist, Lewisburg\n\nPaul and Mary Lindquist’s journey in historic preservation began in Columbus, Georgia, where their love for the city’s historic district led to the restoration of ten historic homes, including the iconic “Three Sisters” Victorian Houses. Upon Mary’s retirement from Columbus College, they embarked on the monumental task of restoring Montwell - her family’s ancestral home in Lewisburg. Paul’s appointment to the Historic Landmarks Commission, where he served as President, facilitated crucial updates to the town’s preservation guidelines. Mary’s involvement with the Greenbrier Historical Society and the Greenbrier College for Women’s alumni association underscored her dedication to preserving local history and heritage.\n\n​Their advocacy extended beyond Lewisburg as they joined the Preservation Alliance of West Virginia with Paul eventually serving on its board of directors and assuming the role of President. A recent project was their restoration of the Hunter House, a neglected faculty residence of the Greenbrier College for Women. Acquiring the dilapidated property from the state, they painstakingly revived its grandeur, culminating in its feature in Lewisburg’s prestigious annual house and garden tour. Paul and Mary Lindquist’s tireless efforts in historic preservation have not only revived treasured landmarks but have also fostered a renewed appreciation for the rich cultural heritage of their communities.\n\nPreservation Persistence Award recipients received $1,000 cash awards intended to support their costs in preserving properties recognized as endangered, or at-risk of being lost, in the state of West Virginia. This year’s recipients are: ​\n\nCascade Properties for the Gaines Estate, Fayetteville ​: The Gaines Estate in Fayetteville, WV includes 192 acres and a historic home built in 1920 in the Colonial Revival style with a bungalow plan. In 2008, a fire nearly destroyed the house prompting the former owner to offer the house and remaining 192 acres of the original estate for sale. Bill and Sally Wells of Fayetteville and Richard and Melissa Stephens of Charleston, formed Cascade Properties, LLC in 2012 with the purpose of purchasing the Gaines Estate and restoring the house. ​Using historic tax credits, the renovation of the house was completed in 2020 when the Gaines Estate property opened as a Wedding and Event Venue. Since then, 100+ couples have been married at the Gaines Estate. In February 2024, Cascade Properties opened the Gaines Estate Restaurant offering upscale casual/fine dining. Bringing a historic home back to its glory after a devastating fire is no small feat. This award honors the Wells and Stephens’ perseverance and success in the preservation and business operation of this beautiful estate.\n\nWilliam Howard Adams (posthumous) for Hazelfield, Shenandoah Junction. Hazelfield is a federal style home constructed in 1815 and survives with minimal alterations from the early 19th century. While electricity and simple plumbing have been added, the home’s original floor plan and architectural features remain intact. The interior features a unique transverse hall plan which extends across the front elevation of the house on both main levels. William Howard Adams, who lived at Hazelfield for more than 50 years until he passed away in 2023, and his wife Janet (passed away in 1991) rescued the abandoned home in the early 1970s. During his long stewardship of Hazelfield, Adams resisted the changes that many owners might make to such an important historic home. The approach that guided Adams for over 50 years was to repair but resist major restoration and the addition of modern amenities. A noted author, historian, curator and lawyer, William Howard Adams was special assistant to the director of the National Gallery of Art where he helped expand its visibility, programs and publications. His interest in Thomas Jefferson and landscape architecture resulted in numerous books on those subjects. This award is made posthumously to the family of William Howard Adams."
