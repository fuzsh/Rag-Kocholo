        "text": "For anthropology and sociology major Emma Margo ’23, the monthlong venture was both her first foray out of the country, and her first archaeological experience.\n\n“I know it’s clichéd,” she says, “but it was so life-changing.”\n\nMargo and her fellow archaeologists sifted through layers of history, uncovering personal items such as gaming pieces and dress pins. The crew created a blueprint of the castle as they matched items to functional locations. On one of her final days on the site, Margo and her partner were thrilled to find a Celtic cross engraved in stone, perhaps pointing to the location of a chapel.\n\n“We found so many items — coins, dice, beads — but I didn’t think we would find something that was part of an actual structure,” she says.\n\nThey also discovered hundreds of animal bone fragments, including an unusually large number of equine shards. “We found evidence of many more horses than we thought,” she says, “which triggered a bunch of questions, like what kind of people were visiting the castle.”\n\nYou can learn a lot from bones, says Soderberg, whose archaeological specialty is zooarchaeology, the analysis of faunal (animal) remains. Faunal bones can paint a surprisingly detailed picture of diet, agricultural processes, climate, and even the economy, he says.\n\nAs Margo learned archaeological skills, she gained some everyday life skills as well. She learned how to get around in another country, and how to shop and cook on a budget.\n\nShe also soaked in the local atmosphere. “The owner of the island, who was a soap opera actor at one time, invited everyone to a pub full of older Irish guys singing folk songs,” Margo says. “I even got up and danced.”\n\nThe experience solidified her plans to pursue a career in zooarchaeology. “This career is more accessible than you would think,” she says.\n\nSoderberg agrees, pointing to examples of recent Denison graduates working as archaeologists, surveying potential sites for energy companies and other proposed developments. Every time federal funding is part of a development project, he says, an archaeological assessment is required aspart of an environmental impact survey.\n\nBut he confesses he’s worried that he may have ruined (pun intended) his students for future archaeological projects. “Because it’s the most interesting site I’ve been on in 30 years!”\n\nFortunately, Soderberg received funding to return to McDermott’s Castle in 2023, with five Denison students joining him for another unforgettable adventure."
