        "text": "Hal McClamma\n\nAbsentee General Manager\n\nHal has been a part of the Dave’s World family since 2007. Hal has been in retail for 37 years having held positions in sales, store management, distribution center management, district and regional management, director of store operations and company Vice President for two large home furnishings chains. Hal has also owned a full line furniture store, mattress store and appliance repair company. Additionally, Hal has consulted companies in 43 states and overseas in the areas of financial management, organizational development, merchandising, operations and sales and sales coaching. Hal and his wife of 32 years reside in Alabama.\n\nShane Clukey\n\nHVAC Regional Manager - South\n\nIt is a passion of mine to help people. I look forward to giving every customer and employee an awesome experience. I have been in the service industry for 25 years and I look forward to striving in the heat pump world. Outside of work I have 2 kids that keep me busy with sports and other activities. My wife and I like to cruise in the Jeep on hot summer days and when we are not doing that, we also spend a lot of time by the poolside in the summer.\n\nWilliam Blanchard\n\nHVAC Regional Manager - North\n\nI was born and raised in Springfield, MA. I currently reside in Dexter, ME. I spent all of my summers in Maine growing up camping and enjoying the beach. I joined the United States Marine Corps while in High School and promptly left for bootcamp upon graduating High School. I spent the next 6 years as a helicopter mechanic for the Marine Corps. After completing my military service, I continued fixing helicopters and jets for the Marine Corps, Army, Navy, and the Air Force both stateside and overseas. Since 2017, I have moved away from mechanics and have enjoyed time in both the building materials and the HVAC distribution side. While I was working fulltime I attended and graduated college with Honors achieving my Bachelors degree in Business Management. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, flowers, cattle, restoring classic vehicles, and spending time with my wife and children. I am joining the Dover-Foxcroft location after a few years in the HVAC distribution field and look forward to working and growing with the team at Dave’s World.\n\nKristen Oliver\n\nMarketing Consultant\n\nKristen joined Dave’s World in 2021 with over ten years of marketing and branding experience. Kristen was already familiar with the company, having been their account manager at a partner marketing agency for four years. A proud born and raised Mainer, Kristen moved to Florida to be closer to family in 2019, but has returned back to Maine where she currently resides with her husband Matt, daughter Ava, and beloved dog Sydney.\n\nMark Roy\n\nAdministrative and Technical Support\n\nMark began his HVAC career in 2008 working for a wholesale distributor in MA. Over the next 6 years Mark moved up several positions before finally ending up as a company wide sales and technical rep for Mitsubishi and Samsung residential and commercial Air Conditioning Systems. It was through this combination of sales and service expertise that Mark connected with Matt Scott, one of the owners of Dave’s World, and Mark’s largest residential client. Originally hired in 2014 as an in-home sales specialist Mark quickly transitioned over to Service Manager for the HVAC department at Dave’s World. As Dave’s World rapidly expanded the need for regional management arose. Mark accepted a position as Dave’s World’s Southern Maine Regional Manager, overseeing all office, install and service crews in Southern Maine. As of 2022 Mark is transitioning into his new role as Administrative and Technical Support for the entire company. Mark is an expert in mini split diagnostics and applications and specializes in residential mini split controls. Mark takes pride in staying ahead of the curve in this fast-moving industry and is a constant student of the business. If you need help with a heat pump, Mark is always happy to answer the call!\n\nJeffrey Myers\n\nSales Manager\n\nI have been in the customer service industry for 30 years and am very excited to be joining Dave’s World.
