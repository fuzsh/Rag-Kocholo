        "text": "Weddings, births, college graduations. There aren’t many occasions that trump college commencement ceremonies in terms of sheer happiness—for the graduates as well as their families. For some it’s been smooth sailing, while others have encountered a rocky place or two, but—for all of them—the official recognition that their hard work is paying off with a diploma is a moment to be wondered at, savored and celebrated.\n\nIn the following pages, you’ll meet some of the Longwood students who have completed their degrees in the past year, most of them this May but some in August and December of 2016. They’re heading off to jobs as auditors, middle-school math teachers and professional athletes; or to graduate programs at institutions including Brandeis, Gallaudet and Dartmouth.\n\nTheir destinations are varied, but this year’s graduates seem to have at least one thing in common—their love for Longwood and its people, traditions and opportunities. Faculty and staff who encouraged and supported them. Friends who studied and partied with them. Yellowstone, PRISM, the Big Event, Greek life, CHI, Big Siblings, Relay for Life, athletics— the complete list is much too long to include here.\n\nMeghan West (pictured above right), a communication sciences and disorders major from Powhatan, not only participated in 14 organizations and volunteer activities but also studied abroad in Spain, was a member of the Honors College, conducted research and served an internship with an audiologist in Richmond.\n\n“Each organization and volunteer activity holds a special place in my heart, and without them I don’t know where I’d be today,” said West, who is going on to graduate school at West Virginia University. “I came to Longwood very shy and not knowing a lot of people, but these experiences got me out of my comfort zone.”\n\nSusie Strong also was transformed at Longwood. “Honestly I wouldn’t be where I am without Longwood,” said Strong ’16, a middle-school English teacher who earned a graduate degree in reading, literacy and learning this May. “I was not the student I am now in my high-school years. Longwood made me find my potential and live up to it.”\n\nKeaton Unroe, a biology major from Clifton Forge, may have spent more time in the research lab than any of his fellow graduates: seven semesters and two summers. It’s no surprise that he will soon enter a Ph.D. program in translational biology, medicine and health at Virginia Tech.\n\n“I love the opportunities that Longwood has offered me,” he said. “The professors here have helped me to achieve more than I ever imagined.”\n\nTaylor Aherron\n\nHometown: Alton\n\nMajor: Business with a concentration in management and a supply chain endorsement\n\nWhat’s next: Special events program coordinator\n\nWhere: City of Danville\n\nOff to the races: Taylor’s internship at Virginia International Raceway opened many doors and showed her how the racing industry works “from the inside.”\n\nChange of plans: “I had thought that I wanted to work in a big company. After completing my internship at a smaller company where the employees work closely together on projects, I now prefer the family-type atmosphere of a small company.”\n\nCouldn’t have done it without: Melinda I. Fowlkes, assistant business dean; Dr. Charles D. White and Dr. Paul T. Barrett, business faculty. “They always had strong words of encouragement to help push me further in life and in classes.”\n\nZach Fasana\n\nHometown: Springfield\n\nMajor: Biology with a biomedical health concentration and chemistry minor\n\nWhat’s next: Ph.D. program in molecular and cellular biology\n\nWhere: Dartmouth College\n\nTalk to the animals: Zach learned many diagnostic and medical techniques while interning at Noah’s Ark Animal Hospital.\n\nScience and barbecue: Zach traveled to Memphis to present his findings at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research.

Dr. Barber spent a considerable amount of time and effort expanding my understanding of immunology, providing me with career-related insight and referring me to her friends and colleagues, who shared their experiences with me.

First airplane ride, first time away from home for more than three days, first time out of the country and many more.”\n\nA push in the right direction: “I am sure that if I had not applied for PRISM or senior honors research (with Dr. Leigh Lunsford’s encouragement), I would be just another individual going year to year without ever challenging myself to do more and believing that I didn’t have what it takes.”\n\nCouldn’t have done it without: Dr. Thomas Wears, mathematics faculty; Charlene Gaines-Cook, Cormier Honors College staff. “At the end of the day, I knew Dr. Wears had my back. I liked to call Mrs. Gaines-Cook my ‘campus mom’ because she always encouraged and checked up on me.”\n\nKeith Crisp\n\nHometown: Fredericksburg\n\nMajor: Chemistry with minors in physics and criminology\n\nWhat’s next: Assistant scientist\n\nWhere: Pharmaceutical Product Development, Richmond\n\nOut-of-country experience: Costa Rica opened up a new world for Keith. “It was a great experience to visit a country that works so differently from the United States and is also so naturally and physically different.”\n\nCouldn’t have done it without: Dr. Sarah Porter, chemistry faculty.

Adam Franssen, biology faculty.
