        "text": "In the quiet waters surrounding Ireland, a chilling tide of tragedy is silently claiming the lives of our oceanic brethren. As guardians of the seas, we find ourselves confronted by a disturbing surge in the number of seals found lifeless along the rugged shores‚Äîa poignant testament to a mystery veiled in shadows. The stark reality of this surge demands more than a passing glance; it requires the unwavering gaze of truth. These seals, once symbols of resilience and vitality, now serve as silent witnesses to a suspicious enigma... and as guardians of the oceans, we will embark on a quest for the truth‚Äîa truth hidden beneath the waves, concealed by forces that would prefer the status quo remain undisturbed. Our collective duty extends beyond mourning the loss of these majestic creatures; it compels us to unravel the intricate tapestry of their demise. Let the waves of truth break against the current of lies. We must navigate through the murky waters of deception to expose the root causes and hold those accountable for the desolation we witness. The quest for truth is not merely a pursuit‚Äîit is an unwavering commitment to justice, to the irrevocable bond between humanity and the oceans we are duty-bound to protect. #ireland #cpwf\n\nSt. Patrick's Day Spending To Cross Seven-Billion Mark Saint Patrick was not only a fifth-century bishop and missionary instrumental in converting the Irish to Christianity, but he is also the namesake of one of the most important cultural celebrations on the island. St. Patrick's Day, or L√° Fh√©ile P√°draig as it's called in Irish, occurs on the alleged death date of the island's patron saint on March 17. Originally a religious holiday, the Irish diaspora in the United States turned the occasion into a celebration largely divested from the liturgy and rather connected to wearing green and drinking Guinness. the commercialization of the holiday is also apparent in total and household spending in the U.S. connected to St. Patrick's Day. According to estimates by the National Retail Foundation (NRF), overall spending for St. Patrick's Day in the United States is bound to cross the seven-billion mark for the first time in 2024, increasing by 57 percent compared to the 2015 spending numbers. Per-household spending is also up significantly compared to ten years prior, although this figure hasn't increased much since 2020.\n\nI‚Äôve learned a few tips about doing press and certainly still learning! 1. You can‚Äôt control what gets in the story and what gets edited. Give the full story and hope for the best. Genuinely thank the press every time they come. 2. The story won‚Äôt be 100% correct no matter how much you clarify. This story went out and said the Queen had never been out of the water before. That wasn‚Äôt true and caused many people to comment on that fact. The local news is human like everyone else and won‚Äôt get it all right. 3. Tell a story, no matter how brief, as often as you can. The simple tidbit that the donor for the refurbishment was married on the Queen instantly gives credibility and more humanity to the story. 4. Don‚Äôt sweat the small mistakes. I stumbled over some words in the story. I wish I didn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm not going to dwell on it either - the story was told and that‚Äôs what was most important. 5. Give the story the right tone - when it‚Äôs a positive story like this one, smile often. Thanks KTIV for the press on the Queen II - you all do a great job!\n\nüíö From our team to yours, we're wishing you loads of luck this St. Patrick's Day! üåà Here are some fun facts about St. Patricks day üçÄ St. Patrick's original color was blue, but green became associated with the holiday over time. üçÄ St. Patrick Wasn't Irish St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, was actually born in Britain and later became a missionary in Ireland. üçÄ St. Patrick's Day Traditions Come from America: Many St. Patrick's Day traditions, like parades and wearing green, originated in the United States with Irish immigrants. üçÄ The Chicago River Goes Green: Chicago dyes its river green every St. Patrick's Day since 1962, creating a unique and iconic celebration. #happystpatricksday #stpatricksday #irish #infuzemarketing #marketing101 #marketing #marketingtips #marketingonline #socialmediamarketing #marketingstrategy #strategicmarketing #contentmarking #digitalmedia #socialmediateam #marketingagency #marketingfirm #marketingmanagement #DigitalMarketing #uncommonmarketing #marketingteam #BrandManagement #FullServiceMarketing #UniqueMarketing #MarketingBlog\n\nHappy St. Patrick's Day ‚òòÔ∏è My maiden name is O'Malley, a very Irish name. This might surprise you...our family has ties to pirates. So, of course, St. Patrick's Day is a big deal for my family. One of my favorite books, \"Grania,\" is a novel about real-life Irish chieftain Grace O'Malley, a sixteenth-century heroine whose spirit and passion are the spirit and passion of Ireland. Grania (Gaelic for Grace) is no ordinary female. She becomes her clan's unofficial head and breadwinner and learns to love a man. At the same time, she enters a lifelong struggle against the English forces of Queen Elizabeth -- her nemesis. Elizabeth intends to destroy Grania's piracy and shipping empire--and to subjugate Ireland once and for all. But Grania and her lieutenant fight back. The story of her life is the story of Ireland's fight for solidarity and survival--but it's also the story of Grania's growing ability to love and be strong at the same time. We all must choose what we stand for, to have the courage to be strong and fight for what we want. At the same time, we need to realize that a life without love is pointless. It is similar in the world of careers. What do you want to be known for? What do you want to accomplish? What companies do you align with? What would you love to do? If you need help figuring that out, I'm here for you. #StPatricksDay #FamilyTies #Purpose\n\nRed Queen Race A key disruption driver is the Red Queen Race, which emphasizes the ‚ÄúHyper Premium on Relevancy.‚Äù In 1871, Lewis Carroll published Through the Looking-Glass at the same time the scientific world began to understand the ramifications of Darwin‚Äôs natural selection for species. The Red Queen Theory is named for Carroll‚Äôs royal character who states that ‚ÄúIt takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.‚Äù This theory of evolution by natural selection continues today, in relation to one‚Äôs ability to become and remain relevant. Understanding the nature and levers of change becomes an imperative for relevancy. If you are simply running faster and faster as you always have, without understanding the changing nature of the world, you will not stand still, but fall behind. üìö Learn more about all 10 of the constants and drivers of disruption in our Volume I: Reframing and Navigating Disruption from \"The Definitive Guide to Thriving on Disruption\". üëá ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/gkJJTAch #relevance #complexity #foresight #futuresthinking\n\nSince as early as the 9th century England has commemorated St George with a feast on the 23rd of April. St. George is a Patron of many countries, and an International Saint. In Portugal you can visit El Castelo de Sao Jorge in Lisbon which is named in our mutual Saints honour. Located within a mountainous region in the heart of Ethiopia, is the Church of St. George. Interestingly, this church is carved into the ground itself, entirely out of rock. Although St. George never set foot on UK soil, he was highly thought of by King Edward I, who had the emblem of St. George placed on his banners. He stands for the courage to face adversity in order to defend the innocent. Robert Baden-Powell, Founders of the Scouts, even chose St. George to be the Patron St. of Scouting. He believed that they reflected the same qualities, including: - Responsibility. - Devotion to Duty. - A brave heart.
