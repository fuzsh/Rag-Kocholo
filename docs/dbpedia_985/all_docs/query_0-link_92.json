        "text": "To give yourself the best chance of success at genealogy research in Ireland, there is one golden rule - you need as much information as possible about your ancestors before you start. At the very least you need to know their name(s), their date(s) of birth, the names of their siblings and/or parents, and most importantly where in Ireland they came from.\n\nTo help you pinpoint your Irish ancestral homestead, we've put this handy guide together. It will take you on a whistlestop tour of Ireland, suggesting some key record collections you should look at for each county.\n\nIreland's genealogy records\n\nIrish records expert, Brian Donovan talks you through the best resources for tracing Irish ancestors in the below video masterclass. Links to many of the collections he discusses (and more besides) are posted below in our county-by-county guide to Irish family history records.\n\nIreland is made up of four provinces roughly covering the four corners of the country - Connacht in the west, Leinster in the east, Munster in the south, and Ulster in the north.\n\nThe four provinces of Ireland.\n\nWithin those four provinces, there are a total of 32 counties. Here's a quick rundown on the records that will be helpful in your quest to find family connections in each county.\n\nConnacht genealogy\n\nConnacht sits to the west of Ireland with most of its counties touching the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean. There are five counties in Connacht - Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon.\n\nGalway genealogy records\n\nIf your family comes from the City (or county) of Tribes, try searching for their burial records in Memorials Of The Dead: Galway & Mayo or details of their work in Ireland, Poverty Relief Loans 1821-1874, which is particularly useful for tracing elusive ancestors you won't find in other records.\n\nLeitrim genealogy records\n\n'Lovely' Leitrim is one of the least populated counties in Ireland but if your ancestor do hail from these parts, you could trace their details in our Leitrim Cemetery Records or the fascinating Ireland Dog Licence Registers which cover the areas of Carrick-on-Shannon, Drumkeerin, Keshcarrigan and Kinlough.\n\nMayo genealogy records\n\nThe previously mentioned Memorials Of The Dead: Galway & Mayo will help you track family members to Mayo. You'll also find hundreds of thousands of historical newspaper pages from the county online at Findmypast.\n\nRoscommon genealogy records\n\nIf you've got ancestors from Roscommon, they may be listed in our unique Ireland Roscommon Kiltullagh Cemeteries. And don't forget, your Roscommon family will also be covered in national collections like Irish Births 1864-1958.\n\nSligo genealogy records\n\nExclusive to Findmypast, you could track some of your poorest ancestors in the Sligo Workhouse Admission and Discharge Registers 1848-1859. It's also worth searching Sligo Independent Newspaper, County Directory, Almanac and Guide (1889) and The Sligo Chronicle Almanac and Directory For 1878 for more ancestral leads from the county.\n\nLeinster genealogy\n\nLocated in the east and midlands of Ireland, Leinster is the most populated area of the country. Do your family descend from any of Leinster's 12 counties? Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Westmeath, Wexford, Wicklow make up the province.\n\nCarlow genealogy records\n\nExplore our archive of historical Carlow Post newspaper pages to find out more about your Carlow ancestry.
