When you participate, you can help scientists in their journey to better understand how Parkinson's works, leading to new, more effective therapies.\n\nNow, especially after releasing my first book, Change Is Inevitable, Growth is Optional, I continue to be inspired by the tremendous stories of others who have faced adverse change and find a pathway to growth. This inspiration has led me to me to participate in such experiences as running in masters track meets, fundraising for worthy causes, and speaking before audiences to share my experiences."
