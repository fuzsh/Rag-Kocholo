We invest in their ideas and encourage their leadership to positively affect the economic, political, and social status of women and girls across Florida.\n\n​We began in 2007 as the Women’s Foundation of Palm Beach County and in March 2017 expanded to the Women’s Foundation of Florida to ensure women are visible, valued and heard across the state.\n\nWomen's Foundation of Florida Video - #LeadLikeThis\n\n​Thank you to Legal Graphicworks, Inc. for donating the production of this video about our mission."
