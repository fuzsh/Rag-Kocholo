We believe access to nutritious food is a human right and that everyone should be well-fed regardless of the circumstances they were born into.\n\nLauren founded the FEED Foundation in 2008 to expand the philanthropic efforts of her lifestyle brand — FEED Projects — which focuses on solving childhood hunger through sales of consumer goods. Lauren, with members of the Board, guides the foundation to take a broad approach to the future of food as a global system."
