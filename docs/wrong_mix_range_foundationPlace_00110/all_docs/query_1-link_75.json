        "text": "The palm oil industry has a significant potential impact on biodiversity, deforestation, the respect for human rights and the protection of local and indigenous communities throughout the world. Clorox takes seriously our commitment to the responsible sourcing of palm oil ingredients and to enhancing our own practices and those of the consumer packaged goods industry. To further our pursuit of industry change, in 2020 we enhanced our commitments to better address deforestation and peatland protection, business ethics and human rights and traceability.\n\nClorox’s global purchases of palm oil ingredients are 99% palm derivatives. The amount and source fluctuate from year to year based on our business needs. This total reflects the low volume of ingredients containing palm oil, palm oil derivatives or palm kernel oil derivatives that are sourced by Clorox from various suppliers. The palm derivatives we purchase contain derivatives of refined palm oil, made from the fruit, and palm kernel oil, made from the kernel or the pit of the palm fruit. These palm derivatives can be present in very small percentages as sub-components of surfactants, fatty alcohols, emulsifiers or fragrances in some of our bio-based and conventional cleaning products, food flavorings and fragrances or natural-origin personal care products.\n\nWe purchase raw materials that contain palm oil to manufacture some of our cleaning products, food flavorings, fragrances and natural personal care products. While we source less than 0.003% of the global palm supply produced globally each year, we recognize our role in driving transparency and transformation throughout the industry. We are committed to the responsible sourcing of palm oil through engagement with our suppliers, industry peers and NGOs. Through this engagement, we hope to strengthen collaboration with our business partners on the promotion of traceable and sustainable supply chains.\n\nIn 2020, we enhanced our 2015 commitments in alignment with industry developments to better address forest and peatland protection; human rights,; and business ethics, traceability and monitoring of risk in our value chain. These commitments give us the ability to track our progress toward responsibly sourced palm oil and will evolve over time as the industry changes.\n\nProgress toward our goals can be found below and in the most recent Sustainability Accounting Standards Board report in our integrated annual report.\n\nSupplier requirements\n\nAt Clorox, we recognize that our ability to achieve our palm oil commitments depends heavily on the changing practices of the palm industry and the future market availability of the palm derivatives used in our products. We are committed to that change and strive to clearly communicate our expectations to support our suppliers in their effort to source responsibly.\n\nClorox expects our palm ingredient suppliers and their upstream supply chains to:\n\nSource only CSPO through RSPO physical supply chains by 2025.\n\nIncorporate our commitment criteria in their supplier selection process.\n\nComply with all RSPO Principles and Criteria.\n\nComply with our Business Partner Code of Conduct and our Responsible and Sustainable Sourcing Policy and Supplier Standards.\n\nClorox will always seek to support our suppliers first and leverage our business to drive change within the supply chain; however, in the event of non-compliant conduct, we may, at our sole discretion, require the business partner to implement remedial measures specified by Clorox within a defined time period or impose consequences up to and including termination of the business relationship and any related contracts.\n\nBusiness ethics and human rights\n\nClorox holds direct suppliers of palm ingredients accountable to the following business practices listed in our Business Partner Code of Conduct. We also meet with priority suppliers further upstream, and expect all direct and indirect suppliers to meet or exceed our standards:\n\nComply with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries of operation.\n\nProhibit child labor, forced and/or bonded labor.\n\nCompensate workers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations—including those pertaining to minimum wage, overtime, maximum hours, benefits and leave.\n\nProhibit discrimination, harassment and inhumane treatment in employment or occupation.\n\nCreate safe working conditions and a healthy work environment for all workers.\n\nRespect workers’ rights to freedom of association and to collective bargaining.\n\nPrevent and prohibit corruption, including extortion and bribery.\n\nUse ethical recruitment practices, in which recruitment processes are documented and transparent, and costs charged to the workers are transparent, justified and legal.\n\nIdentify and implement efforts to reduce environmental footprints, adopt safe work procedures and require appropriate personal protective equipment to prevent chemical exposure, and, where possible, eliminate worker exposure to harmful chemical, biological and physical agents.\n\nTraceability\n\nClorox continues to establish and maintain traceability of our palm supply chains to first refiner and mill level. This visibility is critical in ensuring our palm commitments are effectively communicated and practiced throughout the supply chain. We focus on engaging our high-volume, priority suppliers (90% of our 2022 purchases) and have improved our traceability success by aligning with these suppliers and our NGO partners. Our traceability work supports the effort to educate about and promote supply chain transparency and sustainability.\n\nBelow are the percentages by year of our priority supplier volume traced to first refiner and mill:\n\nYear First Refiner Mill 2016 66% 76% 2017 93% 87% 2018 98.9% 92.1% 2019 98.8% 89.3% 2020 96.3% 97.3% 2021 96.3% 93.3% 2022 98.4% 91.4%\n\nIn 2021, Clorox worked with Earthworm Foundation to utilize our traceability results and conduct a supplier and regional risk analysis. This allows us to identify opportunities where we can support our suppliers on specific transformation activities and allows us to ensure transparent NDPE policies.\n\nOn the ground investment: The Aceh Landscape Program\n\nSince 2016, Clorox has supported Earthworm Foundation’s Aceh Landscape Program, which advances long-term, community-level sustainability transformation in the Indonesian region of Aceh Tamiang, Sumatra. The program:\n\nStrengthens NDPE policies and practices by commercial actors.\n\nImproves the livelihood prospects of communities.\n\nBuilds capacity of local government to conduct spatial planning and district development processes that are inclusive and data-driven.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, the program contributed to a 60% reduction in deforestation and diversified the livelihoods of more than 2,000 households in communities where we source our ingredients. It also provided support to strengthen local leadership and entrepreneurship of women and youth. Additionally, we provided technical support for palm oil replanting in Indonesia, training over 300 people, including 150 high school students and members of a young farmers group.\n\nOn the ground investment: The Burt’s Bees Global Supply Chain Investment Program\n\nSince 2019, our Burt’s Bees brand has partnered through its Global Supply Chain Investment Program on a multistakeholder effort, facilitated by BSR, focused on ensuring safety and well-being of workers in palm growing and harvesting in Indonesia. We’ve supported a series of workshops to deepen understanding of labor issues and identified a set of palm oil producers in Indonesia who are committed to collaboration to improve plantation management practices related to working conditions and worker welfare. In 2021, this collaboration was expanded to include suppliers and NGO implementation partners in Malaysia, in addition to those continuing to participate from Indonesia."
