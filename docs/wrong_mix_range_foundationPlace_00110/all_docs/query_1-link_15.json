        "text": "The Education Foundation of Palm Beach County held a ceremonial groundbreaking on the construction site of its new education innovation hub at 1515 Barton Road, Lake Worth Beach on Tuesday, December 5, 2023. Surrounded by campaign supporters, local officials, teachers and students, leadership announced progress on the “Brick by Brick, Mind by Mind” campaign as shovels broke ground on the future home of The Education Foundation.\n\n“The Education Foundation of Palm Beach County has a long and proud tradition of excellence that extends from classrooms and schools into people’s homes and communities,” said President & CEO James Gavrilos. “Ultimately, that’s what this campaign is all about improving people’s lives through education. The ‘Brick by Brick, Mind by Mind’ campaign is at a tipping point where philanthropy can make a profound difference in our ability to contribute to a better Palm Beach County and help eliminate generational poverty through education.”"
