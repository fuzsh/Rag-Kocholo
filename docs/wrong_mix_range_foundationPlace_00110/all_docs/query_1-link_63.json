        "text": "The Hanson House is really a home away from home. I am truly thankful for everything. It meant the world to me to be able to stay here while my baby boy was in the NICU. Thank you to all the volunteers. - M. A.\n\nWe felt fortunate to stay in this lovely facility. The friendly and supportive staff, home like facilities, fountains and courtyard provided a relaxing and peaceful feeling during a stressful time. - R. P.\n\nGreat place. Wonderful to know I am just two minutes from my husband’s hospital bed. - E. A.\n\nThank you for providing such a restful place for our family during this time of need. - A. F.\n\nIn 2011, I had my first child at Desert Regional Medical Center and after being in labor for almost 24 hours, I was rushed to have an emergency c-section within 5 minutes. My daughter had swallowed fluid and had to be taken out right away and whisked to the Neonatal Unit. As a new mom, I was devastated. I had stayed in the hospital for the full 5 days after my c-section, but did not want to leave my child in the hospital and we were almost a 45 min one way trip away. We decided to stay at the Hanson House and they were so welcoming and gracious. The rooms were well equipped and the community was pantry was full, so that I could focus on healing and breastfeeding my child. I stayed for about 3 days until my breast milk was able to feed her for a full 8 hours. I was so thankful for the Hanson House. And only a few years later, stayed again when my second child was in the NICU too. Thank you for providing comfort through the difficult time. We felt fortunate to stay in this lovely facility. The friendly and supportive staff, home like facilities, fountains and courtyeard provided a relaxing and peaceful feeling during a stressful time. - C. D."
