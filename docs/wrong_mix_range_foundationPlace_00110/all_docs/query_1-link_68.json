        "text": "Situated in the Boscaje de la Palma region of the Rio Grande Delta, the preserve is home to one of the only two remaining large stands of native Mexican sabal palm/Tamaulipan thornforest in the United States. Of the original 40,000-plus acres of riparian Mexican sabal palm forest that once stretched along the banks of the Rio Grande, only 37 acres of protected palm forest exist today.\n\nLocated on the Central Flyway migratory route, the subtropical environment of South Texas attracts birders from all over the world for good reason. Nearly 500 migratory and resident avian species pass through the Rio Grande Valley. Observations at Southmost Preserve include the Altamira oriole, chachalaca, green jay, tropical parula, buff-bellied hummingbird and black-bellied and fulvous whistling ducks, as well as groove-billed ani, Couch's kingbird and olive sparrow. In addition, the wooded fringes of the resacas offer some of the last remaining nesting habitat for two rare subspecies of birds, the Brownsville common yellowthroat and the Lomita Carolina wren.\n\nAlthough Southmost Preserve is teeming with biodiversity, scientists are increasingly concerned about the long-term impacts of the border wall there. More than 85% of Southmost Preserve currently sits behind the wall that stretches along the Texas-Mexico border. The border wall runs adjacent to a levee and blocks the usual northern dispersal path for a number of animals that once crossed the embankment freely. Conservation staff have also noted increased sightings of wildlife like javelina and white-tailed deer across the preserve, presumably due to the obstruction of normal travel routes caused by the border fence, which prevents them from accessing other suitable habitat."
