        "text": "The location of Google’s new campus is Sunnyvale, close to the company’s main offices, and it consists of two buildings which are similar in size, symmetrically positioned along the green axis that separates them, containing a total floor area of 97,000 square meters.\n\nThe design presents two series of stepped green roofs, passable both on foot and by bike, that generate zigzagging routes, give access into the two buildings at several levels, and inside provide meeting zones, plazas, and cafeterias. The terraced complex aspires to take in as many as 4,500 employees in a construction that maximizes outdoor space (some of it reserved for staff use and the rest to be shared with residents of the city at large), boosts the presence of sports with a view to improving the health of workers, and makes itself part of Sunnyvale’s public transport system."
