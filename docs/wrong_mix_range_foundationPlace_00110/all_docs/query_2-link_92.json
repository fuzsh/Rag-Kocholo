        "text": "When it comes to the most important meal of the day, the newly opened Skillets in Wellington has got you covered. Featuring a menu jam packed with breakfast goodness, the restaurant had a soft opening in late June, but officially opened on July 9.\n\nThis is the company's 16th location and its third in Palm Beach County, with one in Boca Raton which opened in 2021 and another which opened last year in Delray Beach.\n\n\"As we expand in Palm Beach County, the Wellington area is an ideal fit. This equestrian and family-centric area has many early risers looking for a quality breakfast experience,\" said Skillets president and CEO Joe DiGangi.\n\nSkillets menu is full of items for breakfast lovers: from scratch-made blintzes and biscuits to French toast and frittatas\n\nOpen from 7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. every day, Skillets has a menu that will have most breakfast lovers thinking they've died and gone to heaven.\n\nScratch-made blintzes, biscuits, crepes, eggs benedict, french toast, frittatas, fruit, grits, oatmeal, omelets, pancakes, platters, scones and waffles pack the menu, but it might be the restaurant namesake, the skillet, that has people lining up.\n\nIt all starts with a foundation of their Skillets potatoes. No, these are not hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes or anything else, these are founder Ross Edlund's tried and true recipe. Made with blend of milk, cream, cream cheese, scallions, and shredded potatoes they are oven-baked to a golden brown perfection.\n\nWith that tasty foundation baked to order and ready, there are seven different skillets from which to choose. A few of them include the bacon avocado skillet, with two strips of bacon and sliced avocado; the corned beef hash skillet, made with homemade, slow-roasted corned beef brisket hash; and the Denver skillet with ham, peppers, onions, diced tomato and a three-cheese blend.\n\nAll skillets include two U.S. AA grade eggs and a choice of toast, scone or biscuit.\n\nThough breakfast might get the lion's share of the love, Skillets features an impressive lunch menu as well with items like their popular chicken tacos, made with house-roasted chicken, the avocado BLT salad, the impressive power salad, the Cuban panini, the Mediterranean wrap and much more.\n\nShowing equal love to both breakfast and lunch lovers, Skillets serves all menu items from open to close. Want a Cuban panini for breakfast or a corned beef hash skillet for lunch? No problem.\n\nPopular lunch menu item at Skillets: chicken tacos\n\nThough they have a full liquor license, DiGangi said their beverage selection isn't focused on the \"hard drink, just refreshers for breakfast.\" Some of these include their good morning mimosa and Skillets screwdriver, both made with fresh-squeezed orange juice.\n\nStarted in Naples in 1995, Skillets was founded by husband and wife Ross and Noreen Edlund.\n\nOriginally from Chicago, the couple had moved to Naples with their family and Ross was a baker by trade.\n\nFocusing on using only the very best ingredients, making everything from scratch (no premade batters or sauces) and elevated cooking techniques, from that one store, the company has expanded and there are now 16 Skillets, all located in Florida.\n\nThough still the majority owners, the Edlunds took on a private equity partner in 2016. DiGangi said that though the couple is now semi-retired, Noreen \"does some of the decorating in the new restaurants\" and that Ross \"still works closely with the menu and helps with marketing.\"\n\nOne of the restaurant's signature deals is that on Tuesdays, children 12 and younger eat free. DiGangi said this started in around 15 years ago and is featured at all locations.\n\nSkillets opens in Wellington\n\nWhere: 13860 Wellington Trace, Wellington\n\nHours: 7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.\n\nInformation: skilletsrestaurants.com"
