She started playing piano at age four and began taking ballet soon after, a background that has a strong influence on her conducting. Dr. Kano’s graceful yet commanding presence on stage and the robust performances she obtains from her musicians have basis in her formal training as a dancer.\n\nDr. Kano has conducted an extensive range of repertoire with several ensembles, including the Angeles Chorale, The Washington Chorus and the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington, DC, for which she also directs its acclaimed ensembles, Rock Creek Singers and Potomac Fever. A champion of music education, Dr. Kano has devoted countless hours to students of all ages and backgrounds. She believes in the power of music to nurture and believes that classical music should be accessible to all. Dr. Kano’s substantial experience in this arena includes: building partnerships with organizations serving disenfranchised adults, hosting workshops with at-risk youth, leading youth arts programs of all sizes, as well as directing award-winning high school and collegiate choruses.\n\nIn addition to her work with GMCW, Dr. Kano founded the New York City Master Chorale in 2005 and served as the artistic director until spring 2019. The 80-member group is recognized as one of the finest vocal ensembles in New York City and has performed to sold-out audiences on two continents. Dr. Kano is known for her expressiveness and dynamic conducting and the Chorale has been praised for its balance and richness in tone in performing a variety of musical styles. Under her direction, the Chorale made its debuts at Lincoln Center (2006) and Carnegie Hall (2009), as well as its international debut in Paris, France (2011).\n\nDr. Kano has prepared choruses for Zubin Mehta, Esa-Pekka Solonen, Emil de Cou, David Hayes, Craig Fleischer, Victor Vener and Paul Salamunovich. Dr. Kano’s various ensembles have performed at the Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Disney Hall, Église Saint-Sulpice (Paris) and on the National Mall for the 2009 inaugural ceremonies.\n\nDr. Kano received her doctorate in choral conducting from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2004. At UCLA, Dr. Kano studied under Donald Neuen, her professional mentor. For her dissertation on Duruflé’s Requiem, Dr. Kano completed research with L’Association Duruflé in Paris and studied privately with Paul Salamunovich. Dr. Kano holds a Master of Music degree from UCLA and a bachelor’s degree in choral music education and piano performance from Arizona State University.\n\nDr. Kano speaks French and actively conducts ensembles in New York City, Paris, and Washington, DC.\n\nEmail Thea\n\nC. Paul Heins, Associate Conductor/GenOUT Director (he/him/his)\n\nC. Paul Heins, associate conductor, joined the GMCW artistic team in the 2014-15 Season. One of his chief responsibilities is the direction of the GenOUT Chorus, established by GMCW in January 2015 for LGBTQ and allied youth, ages 13-18. Under Dr. Heins’ direction, the GenOUT Chorus has performed at Lincoln Theatre, Atlas Performing Arts Center, The Kennedy Center, and the White House, and in 2016 made its debut GALA Choruses performance in Denver.\n\nPaul was previously the director of the Concert Choir at Georgetown University, where he also taught music theory, piano, and introduction to voice, and served as music director for the university’s opera and musical theater productions. He is also the past director of the Lesbian & Gay Chorus of Washington.\n\nDr. Heins was trained in piano and flute at Bowling Green State University (B.Mus.), flute at the University of Maryland (M.Mus.), and choral conducting at the University of Maryland (D.M.A.).

He brings over 33 years of singing, performing, and directing experience with faith-based, community, academic, and choral vocal ensembles; as well as experience with musical theater and opera to his position as the director of the Seasons of Love ensemble.\n\nRonté’s musical journey began in Durham, NC, where he participated in the children’s choir of his childhood church. It was there that his love of singing and directing gospel music was cultivated and he eventually started a successful singing group, served as a worship leader, and directed three choirs at his home church.\n\nRonté’s musical experiences with his childhood church inspired him to study voice at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) in Durham, NC. He was a member of the NCCU Concert Choir, NCCU Touring Choir, NCCU Vocal Jazz Ensemble, and NCCU Opera Workshop. Upon receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Music (2006), he eventually began a teaching career with the hopes of inspiring others to express themselves with the power of music.\n\nRonté currently serves as one of three music teachers at Jackson-Reed High School in Washington, DC where he directs a successful choir program. He believes that the best teachers are those who continue to engage in the learning process, which has led him to pursue and receive a Master of Music degree from Boston University (2012) and an Education Specialist degree from Grand Canyon University (2021).\n\nEMAIL RONTÉ\n\nCraig Cipollini, Director of Marketing (he/him/his)\n\nCraig’s first two interests growing up were art and theater.
