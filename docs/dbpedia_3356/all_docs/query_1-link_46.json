        "text": "Named a 2024 “Arizona Business Leader Of The Year” by Arizona Business Magazine\n\n“Public relations Guru.” “Spinmeister.” “Mastermind.” “Swami of Spin.” “Best PR firm I have ever worked with.”\n\nJust a few of the phrases used by Arizona media to describe Jason Rose, President of Rose+Allyn Public & Online Relations, which he founded in 1996 at the age of 26. In fact, Arizona Business Magazine labeled Rose “Arizona’s PR Heavyweight.”\n\nSince inception, the company has handled nearly 500 of Arizona’s most publicized public relations projects and political and public affairs campaigns. They range from the Phoenix Coyotes, Microsoft, Nestle, Harkins Theatres, ESPN, Pepsi, University of Phoenix, Fox Restaurant Concepts, Whole Foods, Nationwide Insurance, Alliance for School Choice and the Falcone Family to Rawhide, various Native American communities, The Ellman Companies, Phoenix International Raceway, Kinder/Morgan Energy, Vestar Development Co., Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Tempe Marketplace, Turf Paradise, Midwestern University, Goldwater Institute, multiple Fortune 500 companies and the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction.\n\nOn the political campaign front Rose has successfully consulted on the election of dozens of statewide officials, mayors, county officials, state and local ballot measures and even presidential campaigns (Romney and Rubio). In 2016 Rose was asked to consult on Governor Ducey’s landmark Proposition 123 campaign as well as the successful re-election of Scottsdale Mayor Jim Lane and successful defeat of a massive sales tax hike in Peoria, all on behalf of the Arizona Automobile Dealer’s Association.\n\nRose’s crisis communications reputation has resulted in representation of elected officials and issues across the political spectrum from Democratic Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon to former Republican Congressman J.D. Hayworth.\n\nCompany work and commentaries have landed Rose and clients in The New York Times’ Magazine, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, Roll Call, Politico, Newsweek, Voice of America Radio, Nation’s Restaurant News, Playboy Magazine, Los Angeles Times, The Financial Times, The Daily Show with John Stewart, Saturday Night Live, and other national publications. Rose has been profiled in the Phoenix New Times, Scottsdale Life, Paradise Magazine, Scottsdale Magazine, Arizona Business Magazine and Arizona Capitol Times. He is a frequent commentator on public relations and political matters in the Arizona Republic, East Valley Tribune, Phoenix Business Journal, Arizona Capitol Times, New York Times and many Valley television and radio stations on public relations and political matters.\n\nFollowing the tragic shooting of U.S. Congressman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, Rose was asked to appear and comment on the situation for This Week With Christiane Amanpour, ABC News’ Sunday morning program broadcast nationally.\n\nJason is a graduate of Scottsdale Leadership, former City of Scottsdale Downtown Enhancement Task Force member (2014), Past Vice Chairman of the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Arts Board of Directors, former chairman of the Arizona Republican Caucus, guest lecturer at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School of Journalism & Mass Communication and served as co-owner of Nixon’s Bar & Restaurant at the Camelback Esplanade until 2008. In 2002, he was honored with the Business Journal’s Forty Under Forty Award. He is also the co-founder of the Bentley Scottsdale Polo Championships, the country’s most attended polo event, the Fiesta Bowl Rugby & Balloon Classic, Stella Artois Derby DayClub at Turf Paradise and Scottsdale Beat The Heat: The Hottest Race On Earth.\n\nRose is a Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude graduate of Occidental College in Los Angeles. He also studied Arabic at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel and El Centro Bilingual in Cuernavaca, Mexico. He is an Arizona native and currently resides in Paradise Valley with his wife Jordan and two young children."
