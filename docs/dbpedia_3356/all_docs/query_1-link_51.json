        "text": "Roger Kim Hayworth passed away peacefully in his home on August 13, 2021, after a hard-fought battle with cancer.\n\nWith his outgoing and motivational personality, Roger touched many lives. He lived to serve others, whether it be a helping hand or providing a good laugh. Roger devoted his life to his family, his community, and to all the friendships he made along the way. He was a mover and a shaker, always striving to help make his community a better place.\n\nBorn to the late Richard Dean Hayworth and Helen Joan Hayworth on June 26, 1955, in Lafayette. Roger grew up in the Otterbein area, attending Montmorenci and Otterbein grade schools and graduating from Benton Central Jr.-Sr. High School in 1973. He was active in athletics his entire life, playing football and throwing discus and shot put in high school and competing for the Lafayette Generals semi-pro football team in 1973.\n\nRoger married Deborah Atkinson on January 31, 1975, at Sacred Heart Church in Fowler and together they raised four beautiful daughters. He was extremely proud of his girls. His love and support continued with his grandchildren, as he never missed a sporting event or school function.\n\nRoger’s career in the insurance and real estate industries spanned many years. First as a partner with Atkinson-Hayworth & Associates before becoming part owner of Freeland, McGinnis, and Lauerman both located in Fowler. In 2005, after moving to West Lafayette, Roger became an Area Sales Manager with Farmers National Company, covering a multi-state territory. He was an Accredited Farm & Land Consultant (ALC), designated Life Underwriter Training Council Fellow (LUTCF), and member of the National Association of Realtors (NAR) & Realtors Land Institute (RLI). He also served on the Lafayette Realtor’s Association Regional board and committees along with several community organizations within Benton and Tippecanoe counties. His jovial personality and quick-wit made him the perfect emcee for numerous community events.\n\nRoger’s love of sports was evident as he donated time as a young adult coaching flag football and track. He later coached girls’ basketball at Sacred Heart Elementary and was known as a swim coach to his daughters. Those were some of his most cherished memories. Roger also served as an IHSAA official in both swimming and football.\n\nAnother of Roger’s loves was the game of golf. He was known to spend hours on the course as a member of Benton County Country Club and Ravines Golf Club. The course was his happy place, especially time spent with his Sunday morning golf crew.\n\nThrough the years, Roger became an avid Purdue sports fan. If he wasn’t at one of his grandchildren’s games, you would find him at a Purdue game. He loved being a Boilermaker fan and quickly created long-lasting friendships with the Purdue family. BOILER UP!\n\nRoger’s memory lives on through his loving wife, Deb; his four daughters, Erin (Andy) Mills, Jill (Kody) Keys, Sara (Ian) Choplick, Jenna (Mike) Matatall; his ten grandchildren, Olivia, Paxton, and Rhett Mills; Kyan, Kaden, Adelynn, Arden, and Benson Keys; Noah and Elleigh Matatall. He is also survived by his sister, Roxanne (Charlie) Ewing and Father-in-law, Richard Atkinson. Roger’s strength, courage, and humor will never be forgotten.\n\nRoger is preceded in death by his parents, Dean and Joan; his brother, Rick Hayworth; and Mother-in-Law, Marilyn Atkinson Timmons.\n\nVisitation will be held Saturday, August 21, from 10:00 AM – 1:30 PM, followed by a Celebration of Life Mass at Church of the Blessed Sacrament, 2224 Sacramento Avenue, West Lafayette with Monsignor Robert Sell officiating.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider making donations in Roger’s name to Sacred Heart School (direct), 607 N. Washington Ave., Fowler, IN 47944 or Purdue Center for Cancer Research, 201 S. University St., West Lafayette, IN 47906."
