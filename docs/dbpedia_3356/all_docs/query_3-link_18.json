        "text": "Amanda is now in her element having relocated to Colorado. Amanda joined Drexler Law after five years as a lead Child Support litigation attorney where she represented the State of Oklahoma in child support litigation. Amanda has proven to be a difference maker in family law matters ranging from legal separations to the most challenging custody and divorce matters. Amanda brings a wealth of legal knowledge and experience to complement her real-world perspective to each case. Amanda understands that her clients need real help and rely on her to give honest and straightforward advice while working diligently to carry out the chosen case strategy.\n\nIn law school, Amanda positioned herself to intern with the Office of the Public Guardian, which maintains accountability for court-ordered wards deemed to be criminally dangerous and incompetent to stand trial. Amanda knows challenging circumstances and how to keep her cool! Her experience at the OPG exemplifies her ability to handle an array of cases with a sense of compassion, sympathy and understanding, all of which are vital to the practice of law, and especially family law.\n\nAmanda attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, on the President’s Leadership Class Scholarship, where she earned a Bachelor’s of Science in Criminal Justice. Amanda graduated cum laude and then attended law school at the prestigious Oklahoma City University School of Law in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. During her law school tenure, she received a CALI Excellence for the Future Award and was recognized for her pro bono service.\n\nAs a Senior Associate Attorney at Drexler Law, Amanda is the responsible attorney for active family law matters currently in litigation while also providing her valuable resources and support to the entire Drexler Law Team. Amanda is exceptional at preparing her clients for the litigation environment while also preserving and implementing impressive, negotiated settlements of even the most complex of family law matters. Amanda’s family law practice focuses on divorce or dissolution of marriage, child custody, child support, modifications of existing parenting plans, contempt and enforcement proceedings and protection orders.\n\nIn her spare time, Amanda enjoys hiking and exploring the mountains, gardening, and spending time with her family and friends. As an Oklahoma transplant, she is thrilled to leave Oklahoma tornados behind and is excited to embrace mountain life. We have not told her yet about the avalanches and appreciate you keeping that to yourself as well.\n\nAreas of Practice\n\nDissolution of Marriage & Family Law Litigation\n\nAllocation of Parental Responsibility\n\nPost Decree Modifications\n\nBar Admissions\n\nState of Colorado\n\nState of Oklahoma\n\nEducation"
