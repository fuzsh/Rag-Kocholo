        "text": "Hayworth-Maloney rematch in Congress' 18th District\n\nWASHINGTON – Republican Nan Hayworth's latest campaign ad features her gay son, Will, talking about his parents loving him for who he is.\n\n\"Nan Hayworth is no extremist,'' he says. \"She's my mom.''\n\nThe ad responds to a recurring theme that freshman Democratic Rep. Sean Maloney is pushing in New York's 18th Congressional District race — that Hayworth, who lost the seat to Maloney in 2012, is a \"tea party Republican'' who supports a radical political agenda.\n\nOne pro-Maloney ad quotes Hayworth saying, at a 2010 Tri-State Sons of Liberty rally, \"I'm proud to be a radical.''\n\nMaloney has pointed out that Hayworth voted during her 2011-2013 term to defund Planned Parenthood, to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to support a budget by Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin that would have converted Medicare into an insurance voucher program for seniors.\n\nHayworth has worked during this year's campaign to highlight politically moderate positions, expressing support for eventually raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and saying she believes in man-made climate change.\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report ranks the Hudson Valley contest as one of only 22 \"tossup'' House races in the country.\n\nA Time Warner News/Siena College Research Institute poll released Thursday night showed Maloney leading Hayworth 49-44 percent, little changed from the 50-42 percent lead he had six weeks ago in an earlier Time Warner/Siena poll. The October 24-27 telephone survey of 682 likely voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n\nThe district covers northern Westchester County, the southwest corner of Dutchess County and Putnam and Orange counties.\n\nThe new poll found Maloney leading by 12 percentage points in Orange County and 5 points in Dutchess, while Hayworth led by 9 points in Putnam and Westchester.\n\nOutside groups have spent more than $3 million on the race, mostly on TV attack ads and direct mail, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nIn addition, Hayworth has spent $1.8 million of the $2.2 million she had raised through Oct. 15. Last week, she gave her campaign another $1 million on top of $635,537 she contributed earlier.\n\nMaloney, the first openly gay House member from New York, has spent even more — $2.9 million through Oct. 15 — of the almost $3.8 million he had raised by then.\n\nDonations in the $1,000-to-$5,000 range continue to pour into both campaigns daily, according to 48-hour campaign reports that are required in the final days of the campaign.\n\nHere's how Maloney and Hayworth stand on some issues, and a look at their legislative records.\n\nMinimum wage\n\nHayworth recently told the Poughkeepsie Journal editorial board she supports eventually raising the $7.25-an-hour minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Maloney said he supports increasing the federal minimum wage \"now, yesterday.''\n\nNew York's minimum wage of $8 an hour will increase to $8.75 on Dec. 31 and to $9 a year later.\n\nClimate change\n\nHayworth told the League of Conservation Voters earlier this month \"I certainly accept the science\" that climate change has man-made causes. \"I default to yes, there is a man-made contribution to climate change,'' she said. Maloney holds the same view and said, \"The single most important thing we do is lower emissions from coal-fired plants.''\n\nIndian Point\n\nMaloney favors closing the Indian Point nuclear power plant. Hayworth favors keeping it open because the alternative would be a natural gas plant with a larger carbon footprint.\n\nAffordable Care Act, Medicare\n\nHayworth still supports repealing the 2010 health care law and canceling the $716 billion in Medicare savings included in the legislation. Most of those savings come from reducing so-called \"overpayments'' to health insurers that offer Medicare Advantage plans as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Maloney has voted to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, including its tax on medical devices, but supports the overall law.\n\nLegislative records\n\nMaloney has noted that he has authored three bills that were signed into law, while Hayworth failed during her term to win passage of any legislation she authored.\n\nMaloney's three bills were all provisions included in larger legislation.\n\nOne renewed federal funding for a dam safety inspection program as part of a the 2014 Water Resources Reform and Development Act that included dredging and other projects for harbors and inland waterways.\n\nMaloney also authored legislation changing the federal crop insurance program — which had been solely oriented toward helping grain producers — to help specialty crop farmers. It was part of the 2014 farm bill.\n\nAnd he inserted a provision into a December 2013 bill to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract with outside physicians to conduct medical exams for veterans seeking disability benefits as a way of reducing the case backlog.\n\nAlthough Hayworth did not author any original legislation, House Republican leaders appointed her to a House-Senate committee that negotiated an agreement in February 2012 to avert a cut in Medicare reimbursements to physicians and hospitals, reduce the maximum length of long-term unemployment benefits from 99 weeks to 73 weeks, and continue a payroll tax cut through the end of 2012.\n\nKey players in the negotiations were Republican Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and former Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nThe breakthrough came when House Republicans dropped their demand for spending cuts to offset the cost of extending the payroll tax cut.\n\nHayworth recently said that signing her name to that deal was the equivalent of getting three pieces of legislation passed, although at the time she acknowledged she was a bit player in the deal.\n\nHayworth was appointed to the House negotiating team in December 2011, the same month the Senate reached a two-month bipartisan agreement on the package, passed it and left town for the holidays.\n\nHayworth conducted national media interviews that month appealing to senators to return to Washington to no avail. House Republicans ultimately passed the two-month Senate bill before also leaving town.\n\nWhen the final deal was approved in February 2012, Hayworth said in an interview it was a learning experience for freshmen House Republicans like herself.\n\n\"We have found, yes, we are a voice and a strong voice, but we aren't the only voice,'' she said at the time. \"We are a very strong passionate House majority, but we are one-third of the levers of legislation.''\n\nContact Brian Tumulty at btumulty@gannett.com; Twitter: @NYinDC\n\nRep.
