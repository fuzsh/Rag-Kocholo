        "text": "The gymnasium at the Southeast Neighborhood Community Center smells of fresh paint and rubber. The floor is so shiny that the nearly 70 children who run, jump and skip on it every day can see their reflections as clearly as if it were a mirror.\n\nMost kids know better than to walk into the gym with shoes that can scuff up the brand new floor, but for those who are unaware of their soles, there are some children whose job it is to look for black smudges. On Tuesday, a boy who found shoe scuffs brought his findings straight to a bald man with a mustache who goes by Coach Dave.\n\nThe man, clearly pleased with the boy’s ability to find blemishes on the gym floor, turned to a closet and handed the young message-bearer a tool that he invented: a long wooden stick with a tennis ball on the end of it. The boy proceeded to rub the scuffs clean with the tennis ball as Coach Dave stood nearby — beaming with pride.\n\nScenes like this are common at the community center, a building attached to Capital Park Wesleyan Church, where about 80 elementary and middle school-age kids participate in an after-school program that provides a place to play, eat, do homework and learn about Christianity. The church built the center in 1997 to meet needs of its neighbors.\n\nThe church and center are on the corner of 19th and Mill streets SE, near an area once derogatorily called Felony Flats. Thanks to a partnership between area churches, schools, neighborhood associations and police, the neighborhood has been revitalized. Lt. Dave Okada of the Salem Police Department said that although statistics on crime rates in the area might not indicate a decrease, residents have noticed an improvement. The police have made efforts to pay close attention to reckless drivers and parole and probation subjects in the area, for example, and have assisted the Southeast Salem Neighborhood Association in addressing livability issues.\n\nDave Hayworth, or Coach Dave, the face of the after-school program at the community center, has played a key role in that revitalization. As director for the past 10 years, Hayworth, 48, spends his days with some of the community’s youngest members to carry out what sounds like a simple mission: planting seeds.\n\nIts a biblical metaphor that means to establish spiritual values by cultivating relationships and leading by example.\n\n“The ultimate goal is not to see how many kids are here, but to teach the ones who are here about Christ,” Coach Dave said. “My goal is planting a seed. Planting a seed is what this place is all about.”\n\nThe center sits about halfway between Bush and Richmond elementary schools, where a large portion of the kids in the after-school program attend. Every day Coach Dave and volunteers walk students from those schools to the community center. Students who are registered from other schools get to the center by other means, either a bus or a guardian. Registration is free for every child; there’s enough space for about 100 kids.\n\nAlthough he was a volunteer for seven years before he became director of the program, Hayworth didn’t always think he would have a career involving children. It just sort of happened.\n\nOriginally from the Salem area, he and his family moved away when he was 5 years old, only to return when he was 12. He attended Waldo Middle School and then became among the first group of ninth-graders to graduate from McKay High School. He remembered that McKay’s gymnasium had not been completed by the time he started going there, so all physical education classes were “outsourced.” They held class at the bowling alley, the roller rink and the swimming pool.\n\nIn 1983, a year after he graduated from McKay, Hayworth married Tina, and they had their first child, Kimberly. Both attended Chemeketa Community College — Tina as a computer programmer and Hayworth as an automotive technician. He wanted to be a mechanic. The field seemed fairly easy to get into, he said, and he was interested for another reason, too.\n\n“I liked cars,” he said. “I had a couple mid-’60s Mustangs.”\n\nHe went to Chemeketa for two years before going to work for Montgomery Ward as a tire installer. The couple then had their second child, Eric. Soon Hayworth realized that their daycare provider was making more than he was. This was when caring for children as a profession became part of his life: He altered his backyard and built a playground and play structure.\n\n“I started my own daddy day care,” he said.\n\nHe began caring for children between 4 and 10 years old, some of whom belonged to friends looking for child care options.\n\n“I don’t know why everything started leaning toward children. I went to church all this time, and you start to think that doors get closed for reasons,” Hayworth said. “Doors just kept opening for me in the line of being involved in children’s lives.”\n\nWhile running the daycare, Hayworth learned a lot about kids, and found that relating to them isn’t so different from relating to adults.\n\n“In the Bible it says to do unto others as you want them to do unto you,” he said. “Treat them with respect, and they will respect you.”\n\nAfter his own children moved beyond first grade, it was time to look for something else, but Hayworth decided on a course that allowed him to continue working closely with kids.\n\nBy the next school year, Hayworth obtained a license to drive a school bus for children with special needs in the Salem-Keizer School District. The smaller bus allowed him to form relationships with the kids he took home every day. In the decade that he drove the bus, he watched students grow up.\n\n“During the 10 to 12 years of working there, I went through a cycle of seeing kids go through things,” he said.\n\nHe continues to reap that same kind of reward: Some who attended the community center in its earliest days when Coach Dave was a volunteer now bring their own children.\n\nCoach Dave knows every enrolled child by name.\n\nAs they arrive at the community center, he walks from room to room, weaving through groups of energetic kids in the gym, delegating tasks and giving instructions. He has a couple of middle-school age students who are designated junior helpers. They run the game checkout closet and help get kids lined up before snack time. One of those junior helpers is Amiah Totton, a 13-year-old student at Leslie Middle School who has attended the community center for four years.\n\n“He supervises. He walks around, hangs out with a certain kid or groups of kids. His job seems fun,” Totton said. “If you ever feel sad, he’ll make you feel better.”\n\nShe recalled one time she was having issues with another student in the after-school program. She approached Coach Dave about it, she said, and now the two are friends again.\n\nFrom the law enforcement perspective, Okada spoke to the importance of kids having a place to go with structured activities after they finish the school day, as opposed to wandering the streets or trying to fill their idle time in a different way.\n\n“We certainly support any type of structured activity for kids in those vital hours between the time school gets out and maybe parents come home,” Okada said. “Any time kids are involved in structured activities, it gives them a positive way to channel their energies, it gives them experience in working with others. It helps them meet other kids in their particular neighborhood.”\n\nCapital Park Wesleyan Church Pastor Jerry Sloan said that Coach Dave’s successes are the result of the connections he makes and his great love for kids.\n\n“When our other director retired, I said, ‘What are we going to do?’ ” Sloan said. “Dave said, ‘I can do it.’ ”\n\nHe not only has an impact on the lives of the children in the program, but he also has played an important role in the revitalization of the community. Sloan described him as a bridge. With connections to school officials and as a volunteer, Coach Dave ties the neighborhood together, he said.\n\n“He’ll get to know parents too. For a long time the parents were in and out, but Dave has made the effort to involve the parents,” Sloan said. “He knows the kids. He knows the parents. He works with all of them, (and) that is really important.”\n\nAs children run along the new gym floor, laughing, throwing balls in every direction and acknowledging Coach Dave as he walks by, they are saying more than just his name.\n\n“You coach kids’ lives. Coach is a good term,” Sloan said.\n\nAnd Coach Dave would agree. Sometimes, he said, coach doesn’t mean sports. You can be a life coach, a friend, a coach in teaching the Bible.\n\n“Coach doesn’t have to be a sporting figure,” he said. “I like to think of it in a different way.”\n\njdewitt@StatesmanJournal.com, (503) 399-6714 or follow on Twitter.com @Joce_DeWitt\n\nDavid Lee Hayworth\n\nFamily: Wife Tina, daughter Kimberly, 28, sons Eric, 23, and twins Josh and Jordan, 21\n\nEducation: Waldo Middle School, McKay High School, Chemeketa Community College\n\nHobby: Making car and airplane models, disc golf\n\nMovie: Star Wars series"
