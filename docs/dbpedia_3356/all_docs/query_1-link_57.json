        "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.\n\nON a sweltering 109-degree August day, driving past election signs (John McCain, J. D. Hayworth, Ben Quayle) and cacti (saguaro), I pulled into a roadside mini-mall, hoping it was the right one. Entering a barnlike Mexican restaurant called Blanco, I scanned the bright blue banquettes for Meghan McCain.\n\nMs. McCain, the 25-year-old politics and pop-culture columnist for The Daily Beast and daughter of Senator John McCain, is also the author of the just-published “Dirty Sexy Politics,” a frank, dishy and often scathing chronicle of her experiences during the 2008 presidential campaign. Her book is not only a front-row view of one of the most historic elections in recent American history, it is, as she told George Stephanopoulos on “Good Morning America,” a “coming-of-age story.”\n\nThis July, Ms. McCain left New York, where she had lived for a year after the election, and moved home to Arizona. Phoenix is where she grew up and went to high school. It is where her family lives and where her father campaigned and still campaigns. At Blanco, which she had chosen for lunch (later she told me she often goes there with “clutch girlfriends”), I searched for a dramatic presence. For years, I’d seen her on television and on the Internet, glossy and groomed, with stylish makeup and a bounteous coiffure.\n\nBut in a corner booth, I at last spotted a fresh-faced woman with straight unfoofy hair and next to no makeup. Dressed in a black T-shirt with an eagle on it, cutoffs and black flip-flops with crystal peace-sign charms (from a friend’s boutique), she resembled the sunny girls I used to drive to lunch with in high school in Oklahoma (where we, too, had wide-open spaces and abundant Mexican restaurant options at our disposal).\n\nI approached hesitantly, and then, noting two glinting “M” earrings (one “M” per lobe), shook her hand. Ms. McCain has written that she has come to mistrust journalists after giving an interview she later regretted. “Journalists do not care about the person being interviewed,” she wrote. “If they seem to, it’s an act. So whatever happens, don’t hug them goodbye.”\n\nBut I figured that, after three years as a highly visible blogger, writer, Twitter user (she has 86,000 followers) and speaker on college campuses, Ms. McCain had learned to control how she comes across.\n\nShe scooched over to make room at the table, drawing her legs up under her onto the banquette. My Oklahoma accent almost came back, unbidden.\n\nThe emotional, direct personality she projects in her book (“I’m a nonstop extrovert, a people person who loves mingling and gabbing and getting out in the world”) immediately emerged in conversation.\n\nShe said she was thrilled to be living near her family again. Her brother Jimmy was back home in Phoenix after his second tour in Iraq (the two of them had vowed to get tattoos that said “Live Free or Die” once he was out, but “my mom wants both of us to stop”).\n\nThe previous weekend, she’d helped her little sister Bridget pack for her freshman year at Arizona State University in Tempe. “I told her, ‘Do not put anything on Facebook you wouldn’t want pasted on every gossip blog everywhere.’ ”\n\nWhen we discussed her book, she was just as voluble. “It was really cathartic,” she said. “Some parts were hard, like when I wrote the election night chapter. It’s not something I wanted to relive, but I felt like it was important.”\n\nBack in New York, Ms. McCain’s friend Ramin Setoodeh, who worked with her when she was an intern at Newsweek in 2006-7, told me, “The way she sounds in the book is how she sounds in real life, and how she sounds as my friend. It’s her.”\n\nThe tone that works so well in person and in “Dirty Sexy Politics” misfired for Ms. McCain in 2007, in her early days as a writer, when she was 22 and had just graduated from Columbia University.\n\nOn her own initiative and with her own money, she created the blog McCainBlogette to chronicle her father’s presidential run, hoping to widen his appeal among the digital generation.\n\nAt a stylishly retro Scottsdale hotel called the Valley Ho, on the day of her blog’s debut, Ms. McCain received withering reaction online. Commenters on the blog Wonkette (which mocked McCainBlogette) compared her to a Bada Bing Club girl from “The Sopranos.” Ms. McCain later described that experience as “baptism by acid.”\n\n“I was so honest and beautifully naïve to many things,” she told me. “I just thought I was doing a fun thing, and that everyone would want to get in on it.” By the time Ms. McCain turned 24 in October 2008, she was blogging from semi-exile. (Her father’s campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, “banished” her and her entourage from the main campaign five weeks before its close for being “too controversial.”) “I felt 100 years older,” she wrote. Two years on, it looks like she has recovered her youth.\n\nHer goal for the book, she said, is to “inspire people who feel disconnected from the political process,” particularly people her own age. “I’m friends with people that probably would describe themselves as socialists and people that are much more conservative than I am,” she said. “I can always find a middle ground.”\n\nCriticizing the partisan bickering she sees on Fox News and MSNBC, she remarked that, although she and her friends sometimes disagree, “I can’t remember where there was ever a situation where we were screaming at each other.”\n\nHer own book would make as gripping a read for vacationers on South Padre Island as it would for students at midterms or for politicos on the eve of midterm elections.\n\nBut “Dirty Sexy Politics” is no young-adult memoir; it’s a strongly-worded political platform from which Ms. McCain attacks today’s moribund, inflexible Republican Party (“all the old dudes,” is one way she puts it) and clamors for change.\n\nThroughout the book, she lays out her vision of a moderate, inclusive Republican Party that could win over young people like herself who have come of age with interactive social media and care about small government, defense, the environment and gay rights.\n\nIt infuriates her when rigid Republicans accuse her of being a Republican In Name Only, a RINO. “I cannot stand the word RINO, because I think it’s an easy way to belittle someone who’s flexible with the kind of world we live in,” she said.\n\n“I’m pro-life, but I’m pro birth control. I am also pro being realistic about the kind of world we live in.” She supports marriage equality for gay Americans, she added, because, “I have friends who are gay, and I’d like to go to their weddings.”\n\nThis January she subjected herself to a Republican “purity test” in an article in The Daily Beast. She gave herself 8 out of 10 points, docking herself a point for her gay-marriage views, and a half-point each for her views on environmental cap-and-trade policy (“I believe in climate change”) and immigration amnesty (“I grew up in a border state. I think immigration is an essential part of American history and American culture. And amnesty comes with a lot of gray areas”).\n\nNevertheless, her progressive views have angered traditionalists within the Republican Party. In March 2009, she wrote a column in The Daily Beast that accused Ann Coulter, the conservative American political commentator and writer, of perpetuating “negative stereotypes about Republicans,” and called her “offensive, radical, insulting and confusing.” “I object to people who use politics as entertainment,” she told me. The column provoked Laura Ingraham, the conservative commentator and radio show host, to deride Ms. McCain on her show as “plus-sized.”\n\nIn response, Ms. McCain lambasted Ms. Ingraham on the talk show “The View.” “I want to have a political discussion about the ideological future of the Republican Party, and the answer is, ‘She’s fat, she shouldn’t have an opinion?’ ”\n\n“What kind of message are we sending young women?” she asked. “It’s terrible!”\n\nLast week, Edward Felsenthal, executive editor of The Daily Beast, who hired Ms. McCain as a writer in 2009, recalled that appearance. “It was kind of a ‘you go, girl’ moment, and she works that very well,” he said. “She knows who she is, she has fun with who she is, and she doesn’t worry about who she isn’t. She’s game.”\n\nSherri Shepherd, a host of “The View” who has become friends with Ms. McCain, said, “Meghan is a role model for young girls are who are trying to figure out who they are.”\n\nBut in Arizona, Ms. McCain admitted that she finds attacks on her looks hard to take. “It’s very harsh,” she said. “I’m of the belief that you should never say anything bad about a woman’s appearance, ever. It’s nothing I would ever do.”\n\nHer conviction that her gender makes her vulnerable to misogynist criticism has discouraged her from becoming a candidate, though she shares her father’s instinct for leadership. (Her mother, Cindy, calls her “John McCain in a dress.”)\n\n“We’re both very strong-willed and ambitious, and I think we have a similar sense of humor,” Meghan told me. “I think we both live our lives kind of fearlessly and without apologizing.”\n\nBut when it comes to electability, she’s a realist. “We still have a glass ceiling. It has not been shattered and until we have a woman president it won’t be shattered. I think everyone saw the way Hillary was treated and Sarah was treated, and it’s awful,” she continued, referring to Ms. Clinton and Ms. Palin. “There’s still blatant sexism everywhere.”\n\n“I’m a 25-year-old woman with tattoos,” Ms. McCain said, waving her left hand to show the black cross on her wrist, “I just live my life very openly. I don’t think in this climate that I could get elected, either. I like to go to Vegas and I like to play blackjack with my friends. Can you do that if you’re a candidate? No. I rest my case.”\n\nShe still resents Ms. Ingraham’s remark but added, “I should send her a fruit basket. It’s one of the best things that’s ever happened to my career. I don’t care if she disagrees with me.”\n\nIn “Dirty Sexy Politics,” Ms. McCain brings similar bluntness to her recollection of a day when she was snubbed by another prominent woman  Laura Bush.\n\nMeghan dressed to the hilt, in an elegant black Diane von Furstenberg dress, a capelet and Tory Burch peep-toe heels, her hair swept up in plaits.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, Ms. McCain had struggled to appear decorous, knowing that as a candidate’s daughter, her “entire job” was “standing, waving and wearing the right clothes, like a princess doll.”\n\nIn memorable images, she stands sandwiched between her parents, playing backup to her crisp, St. John-suited mother and her grinning, square-shouldered father.\n\nThis sort of self-muffling warred with her instincts. It was, she writes, “essentially the exact opposite of who I am.” But she thought a White House visit called for glamour. “In my mind, even at nighttime at the White House, people would be wearing giant silk robes and golden slippers. Anything else would spoil the mood,” she writes.\n\nBut when Mrs. Bush, in a sweater and slacks, greeted her and her mother, she told them there’d been a misunderstanding. The invitation only applied to Mrs. McCain. Meghan was sent to the White House mess. “I was given a doggie bag of enchiladas,” Ms. McCain writes.\n\n“Want to talk about feeling stupid and unwanted? Try carrying a take-out bag as you leave the White House in sparkly glitter heels and your hair braided in three huge cornrows.”\n\n“I hope Laura and Jenna Bush won’t be angry with me for dishing like this,” she writes. “But I use Taylor Swift as a model: If you don’t want her to write a song about you, don’t give her a reason.” Zing! But at Blanco, Ms. McCain excused the Bush diss: “I think that it was a long eight years for them,” she said. “They’re not ill-intentioned.”\n\nAfter lunch, when we convoyed to the Valley Ho and sat around a Jetsons-style bar table over fizzy drinks, she confided that she was in the “very, very baby stages of some television stuff, just development.” She quickly added, “I would never do a reality show, ever.”\n\nCould a “Meghan McCain Show” be a reasonable future move? “It’s easy to imagine that she could pull it off,” Mr. Felsenthal said. Ms. Shepherd had a still stronger reaction, “I absolutely see Meghan in television. When she comes on and talks she puts the ideologies in practical terms, and she makes it so you understand.” She added, “Meghan will never have to go on ‘Dancing with the Stars.’ ”\n\nMs. Shepherd was alluding to another female figure in the Republican political scene: Sarah Palin’s daughter Bristol, who is to appear on “Dancing with the Stars” this fall.\n\nMs. McCain’s revelation of her conflicted feelings about Sarah Palin and her family in “Dirty Sexy Politics” has drawn more news media attention than any of the book’s other juicy secrets.\n\nThere was the crazy sex among overworked “drones and journalists” blinded by “campaign goggles;” thefts of Mitt Romney signs by misbehaving McCainBlogettes; and even a Xanax mishap that left Ms. McCain “knocked out like a corpse” on a campaign plane (she gives a “special shout-out” to Cynthia McFadden of ABC, “for not putting it on ‘Nightline’ ”).\n\nBut on Aug. 31, when “Dirty Sexy Politics” was released, Mr. Stephanopoulos asked Ms. McCain so many questions on “Good Morning America” about the Palins that she interrupted him to say, “For the record, my book is not just about Sarah and Bristol Palin.”\n\nWhen she appeared that night on the “O’Reilly Factor,” Bill O’Reilly plied her with still more Sarah Palin questions. Was she a “diva?” Ms. McCain shook her head. “I didn’t see her as a diva. I saw her as a woman who knew what she wanted.”\n\nIn the book, Ms. McCain calls Ms. Palin “the most beautiful politician I had ever seen,” but remembers thinking, “I don’t know anything about this woman and neither does the rest of the country.” Soon, she nicknamed her the Time Bomb. “I was waiting for her to explode.”\n\nOn election night, weeks after that explosion had occurred (after Ms. Palin’s disastrous interview on the “CBS Evening News” with Katie Couric), and soon after her father had made his concession speech at the Arizona Biltmore, Ms. McCain was “shocked” to see Ms. Palin waving to the cameras.\n\n“I saw something that I hadn’t really wanted to see before: Losing wasn’t an end for her. It was a beginning.”\n\nFor Ms. McCain, the political is inextricable from the personal. And whether she would like to see it this way or not, her father’s presidential loss also marked a new beginning for her. Since her book’s release last week, she has appeared on “The View,” “The Rachel Maddow Show,” “Fox & Friends” and “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.”\n\n“It was liberating to be able to tell my side of the story,” she told me in Scottsdale. But the new story she’s narrating is her own; she’s the front-runner in a race whose goal is still unknown, but whose progress is visible.\n\nAs she left the Valley Ho, driving off to see her mother, she hugged me goodbye: the reflex of a woman who can’t separate inclusiveness from effusiveness, and maybe doesn’t need to."
