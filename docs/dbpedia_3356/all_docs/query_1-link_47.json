        "text": "Guests: J.D. Hayworth, Loretta Sanchez, Bernie Sanders, Jim Wallis, Bill\n\nPress, Ron Christie, Tim Minton, Rep. Bruce Braley, Mark Hatfield.\n\nHOST: Good evening, Americans, and welcome to THE ED SHOW\n\ntonight from New York.\n\nThese stories are hitting my hot buttons tonight.\n\nA militia leader in Arizona is looking for veterans with kill records\n\nto police the border? I think Arizona‘s new anti-immigration law\n\nencourages this kind of vigilante action. But, of course, the right-\n\nwingers, they love it.\n\nI‘ll face off with J.D. Hayworth, the Republican challenging John\n\nMcCain in Arizona. We‘ll talk to him in just a moment.\n\nA striking snapshot on just how tough this economy is. In New York,\n\nhundreds of people camped outside a local union office just to get an\n\napplication to be an elevator repairman? They camped out.\n\nPlus, I‘ll take on a Georgia lawmaker who says he‘s not a Birther even\n\nthough he‘s trying to legally force the president to show his birth\n\ncertificate. It seems to be the hot wave across the country.\n\nThis is the story that‘s got me fired up tonight, folks. I guess you\n\ncould say it‘s the Wild Wild West. Well, it‘s alive and well in Arizona.\n\nThe immigration bill signed by Republican Governor Jan Brewer has set\n\noff a firestorm of controversy. Congressman Raul Grijalva shut his\n\ndistrict office down in two cities in Arizona this weekend because of death\n\nthreats. Arizona militiaman Bill Davis told KOLD Channel 5 News he is\n\nrecruiting “combat veterans, with kill records, to camp out and patrol\n\nalong the U.S./Mexico border.”\n\nDon‘t be fooled. The dangerous rhetoric that is spreading in Arizona\n\ncan be found in the rest of the country right now.\n\nIn Texas, Governor Rick Perry teamed up with Glenn Beck this weekend\n\nand said that anti-Obama conservatives are an army that can take their\n\ncountry back? I want to know who they‘re taking their country back from.\n\nNow, thankfully, some elected officials in Arizona are responding to\n\nthe immigration bill in a more productive way. Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon\n\nhas asked the city council in that city to direct the attorney to “prepare\n\na lawsuit asking for an injunction on this law and challenge it on\n\nconstitutional grounds.”\n\nBut the protests outside the state capitol, well I think they‘re kind\n\nof getting out of hand. Investigators found refried beans smeared in the\n\nshape of swastikas on doors of the House and Senate Capitol buildings.\n\nBeans were also used to right “AZ Equals Nazi” on a nearby sidewalk.\n\nThere really is no excuse for this stuff, is there?\n\nBut keep this in mind. The state legislatures is the same group of\n\npeople that just passed a Birther bill and a new gun law that allows anyone\n\nbesides convicted felons to carry concealed weapons without registration,\n\nwithout background checks? You‘ll see laws like this all over America if\n\nthe Tea Partiers get their way.\n\nThe president is trying to make sure the country doesn‘t go to hell in\n\na hand basket, and he turned political on this. He turned to his base and\n\nsaid this in a video today --\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This year, the stakes\n\nare higher than ever. It will be up to each of you to make sure that the\n\nyoung people, African-American, Latinos, and women who powered our victory\n\nin 2008 stand together once again.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSCHULTZ: I done know if the country‘s in the mood for a campaign\n\npitch right now. The timing of this is rather strange.\n\nPresident Obama needs to address this in a big way. And I see it this\n\nway. Let‘s see, we surged in Iraq. We‘re surging in Afghanistan.\n\nIsn‘t it time to have, maybe, an American surge on American soil, Mr.\n\nPresident?\n\nIf we‘ve got 30,000 more troops for Afghanistan, we should put at\n\nleast half that many on the United States/Mexican border. Let the Guard do\n\nwhat they do, guard the nation. Our best and brightest could seal this\n\nborder, what, maybe in a manner of weeks?\n\nSenator McCain, isn‘t it time to put country first? Where are you?\n\nWe‘ve thrown hundreds of billions of dollars at war, but now it‘s time\n\nto, I think, do the same thing in this country. This is a war that‘s going\n\non down there, folks. It‘s a war against hardworking Americans who are\n\nlosing their jobs to undocumented workers.\n\nOnce we seal the border, we need to find a way to bring these folks\n\nout of the shadows and crack down on the real criminals. And that‘s the\n\nfolks who are writing the checks because they‘re going for cheap labor.\n\nThere‘s nothing American about stabbing labor right in the back for some\n\ncheap illegal workers.\n\nWe need to treat this as a real threat, which it is. It‘s time to put\n\nAmerica first, and I say surge on the Arizona/Mexican border. And if the\n\nMexicans don‘t like if, what are we supposed to do, just be overrun by\n\nthis? I don‘t think that‘s the answer.\n\nGet your cell phones out. No—before we do that, I just want to be\n\nvery clear. We can be very compassionate on our side of the border. But\n\nwhat all administrations have done in the past by letting the borders just\n\nstay wide open—and granted, President Obama, he has doubled the ATF, he\n\nhas doubled DEA, but I‘m talking military.\n\nI mean, if this is a threat to our economy, if it‘s a threat to our\n\nsecurity, then we‘ve got to move on this. And I‘m not quite sure that a\n\ncampaign pitch to Latinos and African-Americans really—the timing of all\n\nof that, I‘m wondering about it.\n\nAll right. Now you can get your cell phones out. I‘ll get mine out,\n\ntoo. I want to know what you think about this.\n\nTonight‘s text survey question is: Would you want the U.S. to put\n\nmilitary troops on the U.S./Mexico border?\n\nText “A” for yes, text “B” for no to 622639. We‘ll bring you the\n\nresults later on in the show.\n\nJoining me now is former Arizona Congressman J.D. Hayworth. He‘s the\n\nRepublican candidate for Senate, challenging Senator John McCain.\n\nMr. Hayworth, good to have you with us. I‘ve never had you on the\n\nprogram before. I appreciate your time.\n\nWhere do you stand on this law that‘s been passed? Is this the right\n\ndirection, the correct direction for Arizona to go?\n\nJ.D. HAYWORTH ®, ARIZONA SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Well, Ed, first of\n\nall, thank you for the invitation.\n\nAnd you and I begin with a point agreement, because the bill I wrote\n\nand introduced in the U.S. House five years ago, the Enforcement First Act,\n\nabsolutely provides for putting our standing military on our international\n\nborder with Mexico. So we start with that point of agreement.\n\nNow the Senate Bill 1070 here in Arizona. And quite frankly Arizona\n\nacted because Washington, D.C., has failed to act. And, yes, the people of\n\nArizona completely within bounds doing this, because when the federal\n\ngovernment fails to act, the states have a perfect right to step up and\n\nprotect their own interests and protect their own people, and that‘s what\n\nSB 1070 does.\n\nSCHULTZ: Here‘s what bothers me about 1070, Mr. Hayworth, is that a\n\ndomino effect takes place. Now in Arizona you can get a gun without a\n\nbackground check.\n\nI mean, is that logical? Is that sensible? Is this the right way to\n\ngo?\n\nHAYWORTH: Well, Ed, first of all, please call me J.D.\n\nAnd as we take a look at our Second Amendment rights, let‘s point out\n\nthe fact that Arizona now has in place a law that is similar to what is on\n\nthe books in Alaska, and in, dare we call it, the progressive state of\n\nVermont. So this is a situation where Arizona stands up for the Second\n\nAmendment. I mean, right now you can wear your holster openly in Arizona,\n\nand so—or previously, so this no new law simply allows you to wear it\n\nunder your coat. There‘s really a distinction without a difference, dare I\n\nsay.\n\nSCHULTZ: What do you make of this gentleman that is openly speaking\n\nabout recruiting sharp shooters who have got registered kills to guard the\n\nborder? You—J.D, you go along with that?\n\nHAYWORTH: No, I disagree with that. I agree with the notion that we\n\nshut put our military on the border. In fact, history can be our guide.\n\nEarly in the 20th century—\n\nSCHULTZ: How many military people would it take to do what has to be\n\ndone in Arizona?\n\nHAYWORTH: You know, Ed, I‘m not a tactical officer. I‘d leave that\n\nto the military.\n\nMy opponent, who has undergone a campaign-year conversion to border\n\nsecurity, talks about 3,000 National Guardsmen. Of course, the fine point\n\nthe fine print in his 10-point plan says they don‘t have to be on the\n\nborder until 2015. That‘s way too late. We need them now.\n\nI guess 3,000 is a good starting point. I would probably round it up\n\nto 5,000.\n\nI think the fact is this, Ed—we have only about half as many border\n\npatrol agents for our borders north and south as New York City does\n\npolicemen. Something‘s wrong with this picture. We need to have security,\n\nand this is where you and I agree. We need to put our military on the\n\nborder to supplement the border patrol.\n\nSCHULTZ: I don‘t think any legislation is going to do anything until\n\nyou address the border. You need to be vigilant at the border, and then we\n\nneed to be compassionate and reasonable on our side of the border. That‘s\n\nhow I view it.\n\nBut I also think that a lot of this, Mr. Hayworth, comes from the\n\ndislike of the president of the United States, the whole Birther thing.\n\nCome on. He was born in the United States. I feel like we‘re taking a\n\nstep backwards.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nHAYWORTH: Oh, sure. Look, as far as I‘m concerned, trying to\n\ninvalidate Mr. Obama‘s election and call into question his birth\n\ncertificate strikes me as esoteric as the debate that still rages in some\n\nhistorical circles as to the exact geographical birthplace of Chester Alan\n\nArthur.\n\nMr. Obama is the president of the United States. I have plenty of\n\ndisagreements with him, including how to handle the border.\n\nAnd with reference to the so-called Birther issue, here‘s my take on\n\nthe bill that was brought up in front of the Arizona legislature. Well, I\n\nthink it‘s passed the House.\n\nSCHULTZ: It passed in the House.\n\nHAYWORTH: I don‘t think it‘s passed yet. It hasn‘t passed in the\n\nSenate.\n\nSCHULTZ: Yes.\n\nHAYWORTH: It passed in the House. Here‘s my point—it‘s too\n\nnarrowly drawn.\n\nListen, right now we‘re asking voters to present their own IDs to be\n\nable to vote. Now, if we‘re going to ask that for voters, shouldn‘t we ask\n\nthat of every candidate on the ballot for every job on the state ballot? I\n\nbelieve that‘s a reasonable step.\n\nSCHULTZ: A quick answer. Are you going to beat John McCain?\n\nHAYWORTH: You bet I am. I‘m closing within five points.\n\nSCHULTZ: All right. J.D., good to have you with us tonight. Thanks\n\nso much. Come back on the program any time.\n\nHAYWORTH: Thanks. The Web site is JDforSenate.com.\n\nSCHULTZ: All right. Appreciate your time.\n\nLet‘s get the other side of the story. Let‘s turn to California\n\nCongresswoman Loretta Sanchez.\n\nCongresswoman, nice to have you us tonight.\n\nNow, tell us, what do you take issue with what Mr. Hayworth said?\n\nREP. LORETTA SANCHEZ (D), CALIFORNIA: Well, I agree we need to work\n\non securing our borders. And as one of the chair people who worked for the\n\nborder committee, was the chairperson of that, that‘s exactly what we‘ve\n\ndone.\n\nWe have increased the number of ATF people that we have. We have\n\nincreased the DEA at the border. The biggest problem at the southern\n\nborder happens to be drugs, by the way.\n\nWe also increased our patrols, our Customs and Border Patrol. We‘ve\n\nmore than doubled those. So for people who—\n\nSCHULTZ: Is it enough? Is it enough?\n\nSANCHEZ: Well, you can only grow an organization so fast. For\n\nexample, 50 percent of my patrollers, my Customs and Border Patrol, have\n\nless than two years on the job.\n\nSCHULTZ: Well, the point I was making in my commentary was that we\n\nhave no problem sending a surge and have that happening in Iraq, beefing up\n\n30,000 people in Afghanistan.\n\nWhere are the troops if there‘s a drug war going on, if we‘re talking\n\nabout security? Where‘s the military? Would you go along with a military\n\ncall to action on the border down there?\n\nSANCHEZ: Well, I also happen to sit on the Armed Services Committee.\n\nAnd I will tell you that we haven‘t rested our troops. Our troops have\n\nbeen four or five or six times deployed between Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAnd now, with the president sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan,\n\nwhich, by the way, I disagree with—I didn‘t agree to going into Iraq\n\neither. And I think in the long run, we‘ll have seen that as one of the\n\nbiggest follies that America could have done.\n\nSCHULTZ: So are you saying we don‘t have the resources to put the\n\nmilitary on the border?\n\nSANCHEZ: We don‘t have the resources. We have some National Guards\n\npeople. We‘ve put them before. For example, California sent something\n\ndown, like, ,2,500 or 3,000.\n\nWhat they did was to free up the jobs, the administrative type of\n\njobs, for our law enforcement, our border patrol, to go out and patrol the\n\narea more. But the bigger problem we have, it‘s not these people coming\n\nacross looking for jobs. The big problem we have are the drug cartels.\n\nSCHULTZ: Well, that‘s why the military should intervene.\n\nSANCHEZ: And on that it‘s a big possibility that we should use the\n\nmilitary. We just have to be smart. And we have to do it in conjunction\n\nwith the Mexican government, not without their knowledge.\n\nSCHULTZ: All right. Well, you know, we‘re fighting the opium problem\n\nin Afghanistan. I don‘t know why we can‘t fight the drug problem, the\n\ninfiltration that‘s taking place on the border down there.\n\nSANCHEZ: I agree with you.\n\nSCHULTZ: Congresswoman, good to have you with us tonight. Thanks so\n\nmuch.\n\nSANCHEZ: Thank you. Thank you, Ed.\n\nSCHULTZ: Coming up, Limbaugh took a page out of O‘Reilly‘s playbook\n\ntoday and started whining about the plight of white folks in this country.\n\nThat lands him, of course, in the “Zone.”\n\nPlus, the Republicans are trying to scare the heck out of us again.\n\nWait until you see what a bunch of governors on the Republican side are\n\nspreading around the Internet.\n\nAnd the vice president‘s foot in mouth disease may have had a relapse.\n\nI‘ll tell you what he said.\n\nYou‘re watching THE ED SHOW on MSNBC. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSCHULTZ: Welcome back to THE ED SHOW. And thanks for watching\n\ntonight.\n\nWell, it looks like Waterloo is back. Just moments ago, Senate\n\nRepublicans, well, they had the chance to move forward on a financial\n\nreform will that would crack down on Wall Street‘s worst abuses. What did\n\nthe Republicans do? What they do so well. They obstructed.\n\nThe Republican senators, they lined up to block debate on the bill.\n\nAnd this just in, shocking news. Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson, he also\n\nvoted no with the righties.\n\nThey are against what the American people want. That‘s the only way\n\nyou can see this, folks.\n\nA new “Washington Post” poll today showed 63 percent of Americans\n\nsupport tougher Wall Street regulation, the kind of regulation that is in\n\nthis bill.\n\nJoining me now is Bernie Sanders, Independent senator from Vermont.\n\nFor the record, the vote was 57-41. Two Republicans did not vote\n\ntoday, Bennett and Bond.\n\nSenator, what does this mean?\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Well, it means what you‘ve\n\nindicated. The Republican Party is the party of no. They‘re the party of\n\nobstructionism.\n\nAnd here you have a situation, Ed, where the greed and recklessness\n\nand illegal behavior of Wall Street has resulted in millions of Americans\n\nlosing their jobs and their homes. People are outraged. They want action,\n\nand the Republicans say no.\n\nI hope they reconsider, but our job is to go forward and provide real,\n\nreal Wall Street reform for the American people.\n\nSCHULTZ: What are they hung up on? Is it just beating President\n\nObama, not giving him the victory on Wall Street reform? What are they\n\nhung up on, Bernie?\n\nSANDERS: Well, that‘s half of it, Ed. But let‘s not be naive.\n\nDuring deregulation, during that process, Wall Street and their\n\nfriends spent $5 billion over a 10-year period in order to get what they\n\nwant. Last year, they spent over $300 million.\n\nWe are taking on the most powerful people in the world, and these CEOs\n\ndo not roll over easy. They‘ve got a lot of money, they‘ve got a lot of\n\ninfluence, and they certainly will use it.\n\nBut, Ed, what I do want to say is we go forward, and I believe we will\n\ngo forward, on Wall Street reform. What we want to make sure is we‘re not\n\njust passing something for the sake of passing something. We‘re passing\n\nsomething real. Real.\n\nSCHULTZ: Well, how real is reconciliation? I mean, here we go again.\n\nI mean, the righties are in the way. They don‘t want to move on Wall\n\nStreet now.\n\nCan we go reconciliation? Can the Senate go reconciliation on this\n\nkind of legislation?\n\nSANDERS: Well, we will see. If I‘m not mistaken, in the coming days\n\nyou‘re going to find some Republicans looking over their shoulders and\n\nsaying, you know what? People back home want me to do something.\n\nSCHULTZ: Yes. Well, speaking—\n\nSANDERS: Yes, go ahead.\n\nSCHULTZ: Speaking of people back home, 59 percent of the American\n\npeople, according to that “Washington Post”/ABC News poll, want more\n\ngovernment oversight on consumer loans and credit cards. And also, they\n\nwere asked, “Do you trust the regulation to Wall Street?” Who do you\n\ntrust? President Obama, 52 percent; Republicans, 35 percent.\n\nSANDERS: Well, let me say something on this credit card business,\n\nbecause we‘re going to offer an amendment. It‘s a pretty simple amendment.\n\nSCHULTZ: Yes.\n\nSANDERS: It says that we have to end usury and outrageous interest\n\nrates on credit cards in the United States. Fifteen percent max, which is\n\nwhat credit unions now exist under.\n\nSecond thing, Ed, in my view, we have got to go beyond Dodd. And what\n\nwe have got to do is understand that when you have four major financial\n\ninstitutions who have $7 trillion in assets, more than half of the GDP in\n\nAmerica, you know what you‘ve got to do, Ed? You‘ve got to break them up.\n\nThat‘s what you‘ve got to do.\n\nSCHULTZ: And the Republicans will never go for that.\n\nSANDERS: Yes. A couple of them are talking about it. We will see\n\nwhen push comes to shove whether they will vote for that.\n\nThe other thing we‘ve got to do of real significance is transparency\n\nat the Fed. You can‘t give away trillions of dollars to financial\n\ninstitutions and not tell the American people who got it.\n\nSCHULTZ: Yes.\n\nSenator, great to have you with us tonight. Thanks so much.\n\nSANDERS: Good to be with you.\n\nSCHULTZ: Bernie Sanders from Vermont.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nComing up, “The Drugster” has outdone himself. This time, he‘s\n\naccusing President Obama‘s racist regime of failing to reconnect with white\n\npeople. You know where that lands him—right in the “Zone.”\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSCHULTZ: And in “Psycho Talk” tonight, “The Drugster” shows us that\n\nin his lily white world, there is such a thing as a dumb question. Here he\n\nis on his radio show today.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I have a couple of questions,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, as I always do after listening to our young president\n\nspeak.\n\nSo, Obama seeks to reconnect with young people, with African-\n\nAmericans, with Latinos and with women. Why does Obama not seek to\n\nreconnect with white people? Why does Obama say he doesn‘t want to reach\n\nout to older white males? Why doesn‘t he say that he wants to reach out to\n\nwhite women?\n\nThis is a question.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSCHULTZ: Well, those old white men really are historically an\n\nunderserved group, aren‘t they? He might as well be asking why there isn‘t\n\na White History Month.\n\nRush is completely out of touch on this one again. He actually\n\nreminds me of another clueless right-wing media big shot.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBILL O‘REILLY, FOX NEWS: It‘s a much more interesting country,\n\nAmerica, if we stop with the race business, I think. I mean, I‘m not\n\nblack, so I don‘t know your struggle. And you don‘t know my struggle. All\n\nright? Because you‘re not white.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSCHULTZ: Oh, you‘ve had so many struggles Mr. O‘Reilly.\n\nRush and O‘Reilly have never ventured out of their old, upper class\n\nwhite world, have they? So, when they try and talk about race relations,\n\nit just comes out “Psycho Talk.”\n\nComing up, Reverend Jim Wallis says Arizona‘s immigration crackdown\n\nmakes it illegal to love thy neighbor. Men and women of the cloth are\n\nvowing to break the law regardless of consequences.\n\nAnd the vice president just made a bold prediction that hundreds of\n\nthousands of new jobs are on the horizon. I sure hope so. I hope that‘s\n\nthe case, especially for the people who were camping outside just to apply\n\nfor one job.\n\nAll that, plus I‘m putting the Georgia Birther in my hot seat.\n\nYou‘re watching THE ED SHOW on MSNBC. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSCHULTZ: And welcome back to THE ED SHOW tonight. This is the\n\nBattleground Issue. Many of the men and women tasked with teaching God‘s\n\nlaw are rejecting the new law of the land in Arizona. The state‘s harsh\n\nnew anti-immigration measures make it a crime to hire or even transport an\n\nillegal immigrant. Today, the bishop of Tucson announced that he plans to\n\nask the Catholic Church to officially sign on to a lawsuit challenging the\n\nbill.\n\nIn the meantime, Evangelical leader Jim Wallis vows that churches will\n\nnot comply with a law they think is anti-Christian. Wallis says, quote,\n\n“the law signed by Arizona Governor Brewer is a social and racial sin.\n\nEnforcement without reform of the system is merely cruel. Enforcement\n\nwithout compassion is immoral. Enforcement that breaks up families is\n\nunacceptable. The law will make it illegal to love your neighbor in\n\nArizona and force us to disobey Jesus and his gospel. We will not comply.”\n\nReverend Wallis, president of Sojourners, joins me here on THE ED SHOW\n\ntonight. He‘s also the author of the great book “Rediscovering Values on\n\nWall Street, Main Street, and Your Street.” Reverend, good to have you on\n\ntonight.\n\nREV. JIM WALLIS, PRESIDENT, SOJOURNERS: Good to be back, Ed.\n\nSCHULTZ: What does this mean? Does this mean that you‘re ready to\n\nget arrested? That we‘re going to see priests and nuns and people of the\n\ncloth, Evangelicals—Reverend Sharpton says he‘s going to go down there\n\nand protest. What are we going to see here?\n\nWALLIS: Well, this law may force Christians to obey the law or follow\n\ntheir scriptures. It‘s really simple as that. I was out there last week,\n\nand there were people, Christians who were caring for vulnerable people.\n\nThat could be harboring and transporting undocumented people. And so\n\npeople—they were terrified. Raids were coming and they were afraid to\n\ngo to work, afraid to stay home. So they went to the church. That‘s where\n\nthey found sanctuary.\n\nSCHULTZ: This means—you‘re saying that church folks are not going\n\nto back off? Clergy is not going to back off, that they‘re going to help\n\npeople no matter what their situation is. And if they get in trouble with\n\nthe law, that‘s just the way it‘s going to be?\n\nWALLIS: You can‘t make Christian ministry and Christian compassion\n\nillegal and expect Christians to obey the law. I said last week on your\n\nshow, I suspect this might happen. Sure enough, today, I got a statement\n\nfrom young pastors all over Arizona saying, we‘re not going to obey this\n\nlaw if it prevents us from doing what God‘s calling us to do.\n\nSo Arizona has created a moral crisis. My hope is, Ed, it leads to a\n\nnational conversation and it shows us we need comprehensive immigration\n\nreform. The system is broken. Let‘s all come to the table, Republicans\n\nand Democrats. Let‘s fix this broken system so we don‘t have this terrible\n\ncrisis. They can‘t put pastors in jail for caring for vulnerable people.\n\nThey‘re going to have to.\n\nSCHULTZ: Reverend, what do you say about people that are coming\n\nacross the border without regard to law, the drug trafficking that‘s taking\n\nplace, the violence that‘s taking place. Those are sins that are being\n\ncommitted. Would you be in favor of military action to beef up the border\n\nand security?\n\nWALLIS: You know, I met a woman in Phoenix last week, and she,\n\nindeed, came across the border illegally as an infant on the back of her\n\nfarm worker father 47 years ago. And now she‘s taking care of other\n\nundocumented people. We certainly should arrest her. She‘s seriously a\n\nnational security threat. Or the nurse practitioner who I met in a clinic\n\nwho serve only uninsured people. Of course, she‘s here undocumented.\n\nShe‘s a blond haired, blue-eyed Evangelical. We certainly should arrest\n\nher.\n\nLet‘s be tough on drug cartels, drug smuggling, absolutely. But\n\nthat‘s not what we‘re talking about here. We‘re talking about people who\n\nhave been there a long time. Let‘s find a way to fix a broken system in a\n\nfair and compassionate and a common sense kind of way. That‘s all we‘re\n\nasking for. I‘m not—let‘s not pick on the wrong people here. Let‘s fix\n\na broken—let‘s come together at the table, now. We‘ve seen Arizona. We\n\ndon‘t want this to change our nation, make us a different kind of nation,\n\ndifferent kind of people. We don‘t want to be that kind of nation. Let‘s\n\nfix this now before we do things we‘ll regret.\n\nSCHULTZ: Reverend Wallis, always a pleasure. Great to have you with\n\nus tonight.\n\nWALLIS: Great to be here. Thanks for doing the story, Ed.\n\nSCHULTZ: You bet. Thank you.\n\nNow let‘s get some rapid fire response from our panel on these stories\n\ntonight. The Republican Governor‘s Association has a creepy new web ad\n\nthat promises to remember November, a slogan that refers to British\n\nterrorist Guy Fawkes, who tried to assassinate the country‘s leader and\n\nblow up its parliament.\n\nArkansas Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter got his first chance to\n\nconfront Senator Blanche Lincoln in their first primary debate this\n\nweekend. Democrats got the chance to see how progressive Halter really is.\n\nIt‘s getting ugly in Arizona. Our panel responds to the massive\n\noutcry against the state‘s harsh new anti-immigration law.\n\nJoining us tonight, Bill Press, nationally syndicated radio talk show\n\nhost, and Ron Christie, Republican strategist. Ron, let‘s start with you\n\nfirst. What do you make of really the faith community standing up, saying\n\nthat they will not abide by this Arizona law? What are we headed for?\n\nRON CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: I‘m a little troubled, Ed. I\n\nhave a lot of respect and admiration for those in the cloth and the\n\nservices that they administer, but we are a nation of laws. The United\n\nStates, in fact, has our basis in law. I get very nervous when people say\n\nthey‘re going to flout the law of the land. I don‘t like that.\n\nBILL PRESS, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Ed?\n\nSCHULTZ: Go ahead.\n\nPRESS: Remember the civil rights movement, Ron? You cannot force\n\nChristians, you cannot force people of any faith to obey an immoral law.\n\nThat‘s what Jim Wallis is saying. I think he‘s absolutely right. This law\n\nwould require people to repudiate everything that the scripture says about\n\n--\n\nSCHULTZ: This is the civil rights in the ‘60s all over again.\n\nPRESS: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nSCHULTZ: People getting arrested. You don‘t believe that, Ron?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, I don‘t. The civil rights issue in the 1960s was\n\nlooking at people. People were being beaten. People being held back.\n\nPeople were being denied education due to the color of their skin. Let us\n\nnot forget, gentlemen, that people who are here in this country illegally\n\nhave access to emergency services. They have access to schools. They have\n\naccess to health care.\n\nSo I‘m not going to sit here and listen to those who try to denigrate\n\nwhat‘s going on in Arizona and equate that to the ‘60s.\n\nSCHULTZ: Ron, you‘re not going to sit here and listen—you‘re not\n\nthreatening to walk off the show now?\n\nCHRISTIE: I would never do that to you, Ed.\n\nSCHULTZ: You would do that at Fox. Don‘t do that here. We‘re the\n\ngood guys over here, Ron.\n\nCHRISTIE: That‘s why I love playing with you guys.\n\nPRESS: Ron, read the law. What this law requires—requires the\n\npolice to go after people simply because of the color of their skin.\n\nSCHULTZ: How do you get around that, Ron?\n\nPRESS: That is wrong. That‘s un-American.\n\nCHRISTIE: Let me put this in two frames. I absolutely agree with the\n\nintent of this law. I think it was drafted with the right intent.\n\nHowever, I am very nervous—and you guys know I‘m a lawyer. The Supreme\n\nCourt is very, very hesitant to allow statutes to stay in effect when race\n\nis one of the components. I do not see—it will be interesting to see in\n\nthe next two months how the governor of Arizona proclaims that she will put\n\nset forth a set of regulations that will allow this law to be administered\n\nin a race-neutral manner. If it‘s not, I‘ll be the first one to say here\n\nwe do not need people pulled over due to the color of their skin. That‘s\n\nwrong.\n\nSCHULTZ: Reasonable suspicion leaves the door wide open for law\n\nenforcement mistakes. I‘m really troubled that the governor of Arizona\n\nsays now we‘re going to have training courses for law enforcement people on\n\nhow to figure out how to deal with this.\n\nGentlemen, let‘s go to Arizona. Here‘s a sound bite from Lieutenant\n\nGovernor—we don‘t have that? Do we have that? OK. Let‘s play that\n\none. Here it is. Governor—Lieutenant Governor Halter in the debate\n\nwith Blanche Lincoln this weekend.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBILL HALTER, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA: The fact is that I\n\nwouldn‘t have voted to deregulate Wall Street in the first place, which\n\nSenator Lincoln did in 1999. I also would not be simultaneously regulating\n\nan industry and then going out and soliciting campaign contributions from\n\nit. I asked Senator Lincoln to give back the contribution that Goldman\n\nSachs made to her campaign because they are currently under SEC\n\ninvestigation for fraud. I think it‘s unseemly to be simultaneously\n\nraising money from the very folks that you‘re supposed to regulate,\n\nparticularly when those folks wrecked our economy.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSCHULTZ: Bill Press, how does that play?\n\nPRESS: What‘s wrong with that? I think he‘s right on. Look, Ed,\n\nit‘s tough to unseat an incumbent. If anybody can do it this year, Bill\n\nHalter can do it.\n\nSCHULTZ: Is he left enough?\n\nPRESS: Well, for Arkansas, he‘s probably left enough. He‘s not left\n\nenough for me. You know what? She‘s a nice lady, Ed. This is a race\n\nbetween a real Democrat and a Democrat in name only.\n\nSCHULTZ: What do you think, Ron?\n\nCHRISTIE: I actually agree with bill. I find it very troubling that\n\nan individual who has regulatory ability or the ability to write statutes\n\nis soliciting funds from Goldman Sachs. Although, I will put my Republican\n\njab here and say President Obama received nearly a million dollars from\n\nGoldman Sachs. He‘s pushing financial regulatory reform. He won‘t give\n\nthe money back. There shouldn‘t be a double standard. These people should\n\nnot take that money if they are directly in a position to regulate the\n\nindustry.\n\nSCHULTZ: Gentlemen, good to have you with us tonight. Thank you.\n\nRon Christie, Bill Press with us tonight.\n\nComing up, we have a huge problem in the Gulf of Mexico. The Coast\n\nGuards‘ all clear—that statement was wrong. Thousands of gallons of oil\n\nare gushing from the rig that just sank off of Texas. Now, we could have a\n\ncatastrophe on our hands. That‘s next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSCHULTZ: In my playbook tonight, Vice President Joe Biden made a\n\nrisky prediction at a fund-raiser on Friday. He said between 100,000 and\n\n200,000 jobs would be created next month and soon the economy would be\n\nadding up to 500,000 jobs a month. Well, today White House Press Secretary\n\nRobert Gibbs indicated that the vice president may have exaggerated it a\n\nbit.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Biden, last Friday in Pennsylvania, predicted\n\njob growth next month 100,000 to 200,000. Does that sound about right?\n\nROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He‘s an optimistic man.\n\nThat‘s why we like him.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He further said 500,000 in the next couple of\n\nmonths.\n\nGIBBS: See previous statement.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSCHULTZ: Well, little mix-up with the memo on that one, wasn‘t it?\n\nThe president‘s economic report released in February predicts that\n\nemployers will add an average of 95,000 jobs a month this year. But folks\n\nacross the country are hoping that the vice president is correct with his\n\nprediction. A lot of people are desperate for work. In New York City this\n\nweekend, hundreds of people camped out—camped out for a chance just to\n\ninterview for an apprenticeship in elevator repair. Investigative reporter\n\nTim Minton from New York‘S NBC affiliate WNBC has more.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nTIM MINTON, WNBC CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The urban camp out began\n\nFriday morning, with dozens pitching tents prepared to invest a long\n\nweekend for the shot at a career opportunity. Local Three of the Elevator\n\nMechanics Union put the word out they would interview the first 750 in line\n\nstarting this morning.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Family members bringing us food. Bringing games,\n\nthings to keep us occupied.\n\nMINTON: What do you think your chances are once you get in the door\n\nof getting a job?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: My chances are better than not coming here.\n\nMINTON: Even the tent city winners, those on 36th Street close enough\n\nto the front of the line to get interviewed, face long-shot odds. Fewer\n\nthan one in seven of those interviewed will actually be offered jobs.\n\nThe odds are a long shot, right?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, pretty long. Hopefully the odds play out,\n\nthough.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any time a union is involved I think you think\n\nsecurity. And that‘s a key issue right now, something everyone‘s looking\n\nfor.\n\nMINTON: But with New York‘s unemployment touching 10 percent last\n\nmonth, even a chance for an elevator mechanic apprenticeship that pays over\n\n14 dollars an hour is apparently worth the wait.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Only get an opportunity like this once. So got to\n\ntake advantage of it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Otherwise he‘d have to go to college and hopefully\n\nget a job after that. The way the economy is, who knows what‘s down the\n\nroad. This is a good opportunity for him to get in a great field, you\n\nknow, and make a career out of it.\n\nMINTON: New hope today for so many hoping to rebound.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want a job. There‘s no jobs out there and we\n\nneed a job.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSCHULTZ: Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley from\n\nIowa. He founded the Populist Caucus in the House of Representatives.\n\nCongressman, that videotape looks pretty tough. What‘s it look like in the\n\nmiddle of the country?\n\nREP. BRUCE BRALEY (D), IOWA: Well, the president‘s going to find out\n\ntomorrow when he makes three stops in my state of Iowa, Ed. I‘ve been\n\ncalling on him to get out of the White House and get out with working\n\nAmericans who have lost their jobs, lost their homes, and lost their\n\nbusinesses. And so he‘s going to get a sense of what it‘s like back in the\n\nHeartland, where unemployment is lower than what was figures were you heard\n\nin New York, but still way too high.\n\nAnd that‘s why we really need a focused and comprehensive jobs\n\nstrategy, looking at how we got to where we are and how we‘re going to\n\ncreate jobs going forward. And that‘s why the Populist Caucus, the\n\nProgressive Caucus, and the Trade Working Group introduced our jobs\n\nplatform last week to do just that.\n\nSCHULTZ: Doesn‘t there have to be, congressman, some kind of an\n\nApollo Project when it comes to innovation, when it comes to manufacturing?\n\nThese are healthy men who are ready to get after it, willing to camp out\n\njust to have a chance at an interview. I mean—\n\nBRALEY: Absolutely. Absolutely, ed.\n\nSCHULTZ: What can we do about this? Isn‘t there anything we can make\n\nin this country?\n\nBRALEY: No, you hit the nail on the head. One of the cornerstone\n\npieces of our jobs platform is a national manufacturing strategy. They\n\nhave this in the European Union because they know, and we know in our core\n\nbeing, that this country cannot continue to produce the types of jobs and\n\neconomic opportunity without a strong manufacturing base, which we‘ve seen\n\nmove increasingly overseas. That has to stop. We have to level the\n\nplaying field for U.S. manufacturers and the employees who work for them.\n\nSCHULTZ: I tell you, it‘s going to be brutal when the Stimulus\n\nPackage money runs out and if those guys are still standing in this room—\n\nstanding in that line, don‘t you think the Democrats are going to pay a\n\nprice if that‘s the way it is?\n\nBRALE: Well, if we don‘t do something about what happened to get us\n\nin this predicament, by holding Wall Street accountable and making them pay\n\nfor the recovery on Main Street, that‘s exactly right. That‘s why our\n\nLet‘s Have Wall Street Pay for Main Street proposal to put an incremental\n\ntransaction fee on excessive stock trading, and use that money for job\n\ncreation and deficit reduction has to be a part of that solution.\n\nSCHULTZ: Congressman, good to have you with us tonight. Thanks so\n\nmuch and thanks for getting the president to go out in the middle of the\n\ncountry. Appreciate your time.\n\nCouple final pages in my playbook tonight. President Obama visited\n\nWest Virginia Sunday to pay tribute to the 29 miners who were killed\n\nearlier this month in a mine explosion. The president told family members\n\ntheir memories would be honored by improving safety conditions in the mines\n\naround the country.\n\nObama, the president of the United States, has ordered reviews of all\n\ncoal mines in the United States with poor safety records. There‘s a lot of\n\nthem. He wants federal officials to strengthen laws full of loopholes that\n\nallow unsafe conditions to continue. The Senate will hold a mine safety\n\nhearing tomorrow. The nation‘s top mine safety expert is expected to\n\ntestify. We‘ll, of course, be watching that and have coverage for you\n\ntomorrow night.\n\nFinally, 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana, the situation involving\n\nthe oil rig disaster seems to be getting worse. Officials from BP said the\n\nwell is currently leaking up to 42,000 gallons of oil into the ocean each\n\nday. So far, submarines have been unable to engage the blowout valve to\n\nimmediately shut off the flow, which isn‘t good. They are hopeful the leak\n\ncan be sealed within the next day or two. But if they fail, it could be\n\nreally months before the oil is shut off.\n\nThe Coast Guard says the slick caused by the leak is covering more\n\nthan 1,800 square miles, roughly the size of the state of Delaware. The\n\nspill is expected to stay offshore at least the next three days. If it\n\nreaches land, the oil could cause a serious environmental disaster.\n\nComing up, the Georgia State Legislature seems to have been inspired\n\nby what‘s going on in Arizona. Now they want to se the president‘s birth\n\ncertificate. The lead sponsor of that bill is in the hot seat. That‘s\n\nnext on THE ED SHOW. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSCHULTZ: Welcome back to THE ED SHOW. Finally tonight, Republican\n\nlawmakers in Georgia are following Arizona‘s lead and jumping on the\n\nBirther bandwagon. They are proposing legislation that would require all\n\npresidential candidates, including President Obama, when he‘s up for re-\n\nelection, to prove that they are, and he was, born in the United States and\n\nare United States citizens. And the lead sponsor of the bill, State\n\nRepresentative Mark Hatfield, claims he‘s not actually a Birther, even\n\nthough he says there‘s no proof that President Obama was born in the United\n\nStates.\n\nGeorgia State Representative Mark Hatfield joins me now on THE ED\n\nSHOW. Mr. Hatfield, nice to have you with us tonight.\n\nMARK HATFIELD, GEORGIA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Thank you, Ed.\n\nSCHULTZ: You bet. I want to clarify a couple things. You‘re not a\n\nBirther, is that correct?\n\nHATFIELD: I don‘t consider myself a Birther. I think a Birther has\n\nbeen defined as a person who believes that the president was not born\n\ninside the United States. I‘m not saying that. I simply don‘t have enough\n\ninformation to make a decision one way or another where he was born.\n\nSCHULTZ: If the state of Georgia were to tell me, Ed Schultz, that\n\nMark Hatfield was born in Georgia, I guess there would be an element of\n\nbelief. I would say, well, I guess this Mr. Hatfield was an American and\n\nhe‘s born in Georgia. Hawaii state officials have verified President\n\nObama‘s place of birth. Why wouldn‘t you take their word for it?\n\nHATFIELD: Well, Ed, these cryptic statements that have been coming\n\nout of the state of Hawaii are not really sufficient to make any sort of\n\ndetermination on. The state of Hawaii, as I understand it, has produced a\n\ncertificate of live birth that is something that any person could be\n\nissued, even if they were not born inside the state of Hawaii, if their\n\nbirth was registered in Hawaii.\n\nSCHULTZ: Mr. Hatfield, there are millions of Americans who don‘t have\n\ntheir original birth certificate, that for proof they‘d have to go to the\n\nstate capitol of where they were born, and you‘d be getting a copy of it\n\nand that‘s what President Obama has. That‘s not good enough?\n\nHATFIELD: I don‘t think that anyone has seen his original long-form\n\nbirth certificate, Ed. That‘s not the issue here. The issue here is that\n\nwe‘ve got a population in this country which at least, based on a recent\n\nCBS/”New York Times” poll, at least 42 percent of our population has doubts\n\nabout the citizenship of our president. That‘s a problem.\n\nSCHULTZ: Well, that‘s, of course, been purported by those on right-\n\nwing radio in this country. You know how low-information voters are. The\n\nnumbers that you‘re talking about, where was the president born; 58 percent\n\nof Americans believe he was born in the United States. Now, where I come\n\nfrom that‘s pretty strong majority. You‘re not a Birther—go ahead.\n\nHATFIELD: It may be a majority, Ed, but the problem is this: I\n\nbelieve that no American citizen should ever have any doubts about the\n\nlegitimacy and the citizenship of the highest elected official in the land.\n\nSCHULTZ: Mr. Hatfield, there‘s always going to be people out there\n\nthat are going to question somebody for political purposes. Doesn‘t all\n\nthis Birther talk come from just a dislike and actually a hatred for\n\nPresident Obama? That‘s where all this started. It all started on right-\n\nwing radio. You know that.\n\nHATFIELD: Not at all, Ed. I think you‘re going off in the wrong\n\ndirection here. The president holds all the cards in this scenario. The\n\npresident, himself, could release the records to show and document—\n\nSCHULTZ: He has released them. They‘re on the Internet.\n\nHATFIELD: He could release the records that show where he went to\n\ncollege and what he did in college and release his passport. These are\n\nthings that are completely within his control, and he has chosen not to\n\nshow those to the American people and people are asking why.\n\nSCHULTZ: Mr. Hatfield, he has shown them to the American people. The\n\nWhite House has shown them to the American people. The Hawaiian state\n\nofficials have verified his birthplace. For some reason, there‘s people\n\nthat just don‘t want to go along with it because they just don‘t like the\n\nfact—and I—I just—you say you‘re not a Birther. Have you had\n\nconstituents come to you in Georgia and say, hey, you‘ve got to introduce\n\nthis legislation?\n\nHATFIELD: People in Georgia are very strongly supportive of this\n\nlegislation, Ed. I‘ll tell you why. Because the United States\n\nConstitution Article II, Section I says very plainly that only a natural-\n\nborn citizen may hold the—\n\nSCHULTZ: I know what it says.\n\nHATFIELD: -- office of president of the United States.\n\nSCHULTZ: You mean to tell me that the majority of people in Georgia\n\nthink that the president wasn‘t born in the United States?\n\nHATFIELD: I believe the majority of people in Georgia want to see the\n\nConstitutional requirements enforced. Currently there are no—there is\n\nno teeth to that provision. Congress has done nothing to give any teeth to\n\nthe Article II, Section I provision.\n\nSCHULTZ: What would satisfy you?\n\nHATFIELD: If congress fails to act, I think the states have a duty to\n\nstep up and do so.\n\nSCHULTZ: You want the president of the United States to show up with\n\nhis original birth certificate, although millions of Americans can‘t do\n\nthat?\n\nHATFIELD: I disagree with you. I‘d be glad to share mine if I was\n\nrunning for president. I‘d be prepared to produce documentation necessary\n\nto show I‘m an American citizen.\n\nSCHULTZ: He‘s an American citizen. You know it. This is trumped up\n\nstuff. And just admit the fact that you‘re not going to go along with any\n\nanswer that he gives you. Mr. Hatfield, I appreciate your—\n\nHATFIELD: Ed, with all due respect, the bottom line is—is when\n\nthere‘s no other argument to be made, it becomes a hollering contest to see\n\nhow hard someone can holler to drown out the opposition.\n\nSCHULTZ: I‘m not hollering, sir. I‘m not hollering at all. I‘m\n\nsaying this is misguided legislation and I think you know he‘s an American.\n\nGood to have you with us tonight. I appreciate your time.\n\nHATFIELD: Thank you for letting me be with you, Ed.\n\nSCHULTZ: You bet.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
