        "text": "Though I am quite sad to say goodbye to my role as JCR President for Lady Margaret Hall, I can honestly say that I am proud of what I have achieved over the past year and I look forward to my final year at Oxford. That being said, I am also extremely fortunate to be handing over the Presidency to my exceptional college son. Travis Bennett I wish you all the best! In the spirit of reflection, I think it important to look back at some of my achievements. But, on a final note, I would like to give a big shout out to my core executive team (Emma Davies, Isaac Glassbrook and Freddie James) for all of your important work in helping turn these once aspirational ideas into realities! - Implemented the Hall Food Feedback Form: providing students with the opportunity to provide valuable feedback on what we eat alongside having the termly chance to win a ¬£20 hall food voucher. - Renovated the college Summer House (i.e., the Crack Shack): painted the outer building so that the shed can remain intact for a longer period, added games, blankets, candles and fairy lights to create a more inviting environment. - Secured long-term storage plans for students with difficult journeys: whether a student struggles to get to college with their belongings from Northern England or Spain, students will no longer have to fight for better storage. - Renovated the Bar: implemented chalk board paint on the main bar structures alongside putting a variety of games behind the bar for people to use and securing a dart board. - Persuaded college to come down from their proposed rent increase, of 8%, to 3.5% by using vital statistics procured from our student survey alongside my own persuasive advocacy. - Negotiated a long-term rent plan with college: the rent will provisionally increase in line with CPI (the figure measured in March prior to Trinity Term) plus 0.5% in order to target, in the medium term, an UG and PG rent at the median Oxford college rate. - With the Dean's help, secured free porridge at Breakfast for all students. - Fought college for standardised terms in student accommodation agreements: standardised terms will establish thresholds concerning an absence of a utility leading to rent rebates. - Urged all JCRs participating in the newly established Astrophoria Foundation Year to create the role of Foundation Year Officer. - Established termly dinners with the college Principal for all members of the JCR committee in order to increase morale and engagement.\n\n#26Days. Over FIVE consecutive years, Santa Rosa Junior College conferred upon me #TenDegrees. Although in 2020 and 2021, #COVID19 caused the commencement ceremonies to be online, being a part of FIVE consecutive commencement ceremonies meant a lot to me. In those five years, Ten Degrees in varying subjects were conferred, and all but one class (being Public Speaking) was completely done online. Five degrees prior to #COVID19, Five since. In a little under 4 weeks now, my SIXTH consecutive commencement ceremony will occur. My sole degree, my Bachelor of Liberal Arts degree from Sonoma State University (thru their Sonoma State University School of Extended and International Education at Sonoma State's Saturday Degree Completion Program), is my #EleventhDegree overall. Eleven degrees in six straight years means a lot to me. Twelve Degrees in seven-eight years means something to me (and will at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte), while Thirteen Degrees in eleven years will mean the most. #ComeWhatMay, it will happen again, and again, and again.\n\nüè´ Reflecting on a memorable event from last year in Edmonton, where my colleagues and I finally gathered in person for the regional AMICCUS-C conference. Bill Smith, former GM of the University of Alberta Students' Union, shared insightful wisdom on reimagining post-secondary education. His message still resonates with me a year later. üí° Bill emphasized the need to shift public perception of post-secondary education. It's not just about \"students\"; it's about individuals with lives, families, and diverse backgrounds. We must view student not in that one role but rather as our neighbors, friends, or the people we interact with daily. They are all these things AND they are also going to school. üåü When we embrace this perspective, we can see the emmense benefit of reducing the burdens they face. We can empower these individuals to pursue education, enrich their lives, and contribute more to society. We can create thriving individuals who enhance our communities and our province's future. üåé We can work together to transform the narrative around post-secondary education and the role of srudents in that narrative. We can foster a thriving, supportive environment for all.\n\nMany Devon folk & those further afield with an interest & passion for a sustainable and mindful economy, are probably aware of the challenging times presently taking place for Totnes‚Äô Schumacher College. Last week the Dartington Trust pulled the college‚Äôs courses and shut down the facility, with little messaging to the faculty, students and local community on what the future for Schumacher looked like. A day before lessons were scheduled to begin, students and staff were left waiting outside the college, wondering what the future held for them. Many left jobs, homes and countries. Staff have been put on 0 hour contracts and silenced to speak on the topic. This resurrects the painful local story of when Dartington Arts had to move from the local community roughly 10 years ago. People in the town of Totnes still grieve this loss and still speak of the cultural and economic impact Totnes faced after all the studying artistits left the town. History feels to be repeating itself, with the Dartington Trust being key decision makers on Totnes‚Äô cultural presence and significance. Sadly Dartington Trust‚Äôs decisions leave our town once again at risk of losing its energetic heritage: knowledge, mindfulness, creativity, innovation, community integrity and sustainability activism. Schumacher College is recognised the globe over as an innovating space of progressive thought and conscious action in the spaces of regeneration and sustainability. These values and actions deeply resonate with Totnes‚Äô significant history and proactive future. Losing the Schumacher College would be a repeated wound to the town of Totnes and add to the already harmed reputation of the Dartington Trust in the eyes of Totnes‚Äô community. During my recent Exeter Innovation away day I envisioned a time when the University of Exeter and the Schumacher College could meet and collaborate on their shared values and educational work. Let us hope that Schumacher‚Äôs future finds its security once more, so the wider economy and educational systems of Devon can continue to benefit. The college is now exploring routes towards independence from the Dartington Trust. Please watch this space for opportunities to contribute towards fundraising. #totnes #schmachercollege #dartingtontrust #highereducation"
