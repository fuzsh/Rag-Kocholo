        "text": "Reading Time: 31 minutes\n\nOfficially, thousands of delegates, legislators and elephant banner-wavers swarmed Philadelphia from July 31 to Aug. 3 to crown George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as the Republican ticket for 2000. But like its Democratic counterpart in August, this year’s Republican National Convention seemed to be nearly as much about corporate America’s penchant for party throwing as with anointing its presidential and vice presidential nominees.\n\nIn this respect, the only major difference between the two political parties was that the Republicans seemed to party harder, with nearly double the number of private receptions, parties and other celebrations than the Democrats had in Los Angeles.\n\nMore than 300 events, separate from the convention’s official program, were hosted or sponsored by large companies seeking access to specific politicians, and most were invitation-only. Committee chairs, party leaders and up-and-coming lawmakers were courted by AT&T, Philip Morris, DaimlerChrysler, Microsoft and Lockheed Martin Corp. – all of whom also subsidized the Democratic convention – and countless other companies and political action committees.\n\nWhether it was fly fishing with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., dining on House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas’ Union Pacific-sponsored hospitality train, or partying with the band Blues Traveler at Coca-Cola and Continental Airlines’ expense, large individual and corporate donors rubbed shoulders and swayed hips with Republican leaders all week.\n\nViacom, Philip Morris and the Walt Disney Co. were just a few of the corporations that sponsored a Mardi Gras party in honor of the House Commerce Committee’s retiring chairman, Thomas Bliley of Virginia. The 15-plus sponsors – who all have legislation pending before the committee, or could be affected by the committee’s decisions – are betting that party host Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana will become the next chairman if the Republicans retain their majority.\n\nOfficials at the three national fund-raising committees for the Republicans – the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the Republican National Committee (RNC) – were silent when asked about the private events they hosted, who underwrote them, and what the purpose or financial outlays were.\n\nThe RNC did, however, provide The Public i with a “Master Calendar of Events” that listed more than 300 parties, receptions, brunches, luncheons, dinners, golf outings and other activities during the convention week, most of which required special invitations.\n\nWhat follows, culled from news reports, nonprofit watchdog groups and Republican Party organizations, is the most comprehensive list of private Republican convention events.\n\nThe watchdogs included the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit, nonpartisan watchdog group based in Washington, D.C., which provided information on convention events and donors.\n\nOn October 2, the city’s nonpartisan convention organizer, the Philadelphia 2000 Host Committee, reported it had received more than $60 million in cash and in-kind gifts during the convention from corporate and individual donors. It is required by law to disclose the donors behind the cash and gifts to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nHowever, those events underwritten by corporations and individuals are not subject to public disclosure, an FEC official said.\n\nRepublican National Convention Events\n\n1.
