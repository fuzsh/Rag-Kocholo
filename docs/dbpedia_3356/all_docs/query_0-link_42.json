        "text": "The length of the program varies by the program itself; however, most programs can be completed within 2 years. If you work full time, you may take longer in the program than if you were in full time study. The MBA can be completed in 12 months if the student is not working full time. The Ed.D program is a 60-semester hour program and takes longer. School internships also factor into the length of the program. A Master’s degree must be completed within five (5) calendar years and a Doctoral degree (Ed.D) must be completed within six (6) calendar years from the date of the first enrollment in any graduate level course.\n\nMany graduate students use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA loans to support their graduate education (School Code 002933). Information about these loans is available in the office of Student Financial Services. Non-degree students are not eligible for financial aid. Internal graduate scholarships are not available, however the graduate school will post external graduate scholarships that are offered. More information on financial aid can be found here.\n\nOur extraordinary and diverse graduate degrees provide our students with the tools needed to prepare for their future careers or pursue a advanced degrees. Graduates from the MBA and Communication and Business Leadership program currently work for Fortune 500 companies and small organizations alike in the field of marketing, advertising, business development, and more. Students in the field of Education have gone on to positions in administration or received additional leadership experience, after pursuing their Master’s in Education. School of Education curriculum equips students with a foundation geared to the future for which they can excel in the classroom. The Office of Career and Professional Development office is available all year round for resume writing, mock interviews, job searches and more."
