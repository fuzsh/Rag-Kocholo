        "text": "Our founding partner and Patrick's father passed in June 2018, just a few months after retiring from 55 years of service to the practice of law and the commonwealth. George was born to the late Dr. George and Helen McClure of Danville in 1934, and was the grandson of the esteemed Professor George M. McClure of the Kentucky School for the Deaf. George attended the Danville Schools, the Hill School, and Princeton University. Upon graduation George was to be commissioned an Ensign in the United States Navy, but elected to transfer his commission to the rank of Lieutenant in the Marine Corp. Upon completing his commission as part of his ROTC scholarship, George was part U.S. Naval Reserves, following in his Dad’s footsteps. During this time George attended the University of Denver College of Law, graduating in the Order of the Coif, while also having his first child, George IV. George practiced law in the oldest firm in Colorado for several years focusing on civil litigation, becoming a particularly accomplished trial attorney in multiple fields and venues.\n\nGeorge returned to Danville, KY in 1969 and in 1972 was appointed to fill an unexpired term as the Boyle County Attorney, while also marrying his lifelong friend and rock Patsy, adding a beloved son Joey Kirk in the process. In 1974 they gave birth to Patrick, who would go on to be his law partner for 15 years.\n\nGeorge was subsequently elected to 7 consecutive terms in office spanning over 3 decades, often without opposition. George was revered by law enforcement, magistrates, Judges, and the defense bar alike. He was renowned for his keen intellect and a brilliant and exceptionally well read mind, but also for his quick wit, his charm, his unassuming grace and his gentle good humor. It is safe to say that he was adored by all who knew him. He allegedly retired in 2002 when his final elected term was finished. However, just a few months later he resumed his private practice with Patrick, and ultimately the establishment of our current firm.\n\nHe also explored many hobbies and interests throughout his personal life from operating a Ham Radio, to getting his pilot’s license at Goodall (now Stuart Powell) Field, riding his motorcycle, time on the golf course, a love of fishing, as well as time and memories on all kinds of boats. He was the third of 5 generations of George McClures to call the Dix River and Herrington Lake his native waters. George was also the patriarch of a group of Kentuckians to make yearly adventures to a very special place called Otty Lake in Canada, where he is oft remembered and missed as well. Many of the town of Perth, ON lowered their Maple Leafs to half-mast when confronted with the news of George’s passing. Among the comforts of word and memory of childhoods and final days is the adored epigram from The Wind in the Willows, “Believe me, my young friend, there is nothing – absolutely nothing – half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.”\n\nHis splendid behavior knew no borders, cultural, or economic divides. He was known for treating all others as he would be treated, and the same in the eyes of the law (and the fish). More than one has recounted his days not only giving a few dollars to local men of little or no home; but also to sitting with them at the Boyle Pharmacy, Ace Billiard’s, and the Rooster Café. He was likewise always honored to be a member of Anaconda, the Social and Literary Club of Danville founded over 150 years ago, counting among its contributors the most astute of Danville’s medical, legal, and scholarly characters.\n\nGeorge’s was a life well lived, and a man well loved. He practiced law until the Spring of 2018, and while some illnesses kept him from returning to our offices on Main St., he continued to read, investigate, and engage lively conversation about Kentucky basketball, Denver Bronco football, politics, history and his beloved books. His final request for Father’s Day this past June was a “real Coca Cola, and real Oreo cookies”, and he was as thrilled with those gifts from his grandsons as any case he ever won. He passed away 2 days later and would want it known that, clever to the last breath, he did the New York Times crossword puzzle the night before he died. We note that among the last books at his side was a hardback copy of To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nFrom the pages of the Louisville Courier-Journal on the occasion of his grandfather’s passing, and the Lexington Herald-Leader reprising it upon the loss of his Dad, we close and say farewell with these words of Rudyard Kipling, “containing these lines that so well describe his departure from this life:\n\nHe scare had need to doff his pride or slough the dross of Earth,\n\nBut as he trod that day to Go so walked he from his birth;\n\nIn simpleness and gentleness and honor and clean mirth.”\n\nFare thee well George, the world will miss you, but none more than we your honored partners, children, and friends.\n\nBackground\n\nHe is a native of Danville, Kentucky and a graduate of Danville High School, Centre College, and The University of Kentucky College of Law. Patrick’s father, Hon. George M. McClure III, set an example for him as a career litigator and he grew up watching his father serve in Boyle and Mercer District Courts.\n\nPatrick worked for the Honorable Jim Lowry, Henry Hughes, Steve Milner and Scott Hayworth while in Lexington, Kentucky. In 2001, Patrick contracted with the Kentucky Department of Public Advocacy in Columbia Kentucky and served in Campbellsville, Greensburg, and Tompkinsville gaining valuable trial experience and the opportunity to apply the “thinking on your feet” nature of District Court he had witnessed in his formative years.\n\nPrivate Practice\n\nIn 2002, Patrick returned to Danville, to practice with his father and Honorable and Ephraim Helton. In 2004, Patrick and George took over their own space under the name of McClure and McClure PLLC. In 2015, the father and son team was joined by attorney Brian D. Bailey and the name was changed to McClure, McClure, and Bailey. Currently located in the beautiful professional arts building on Main Street in Danville.\n\nPatrick has tried criminal cases to a jury in multiple counties. He has practiced in the Family Courts of central Kentucky since the adoption of the Amendment creating them in 2002. Patrick has been published by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on issues of Child Custody and participates in the Boyle and Mercer County Model Court system for continued implementation of the Family Courts of the Commonwealth.\n\nKnown for his passion and vocal nature, Patrick is committed to the rights of all citizens regardless of charge, background, race, gender, creed, or orientation. However, like George, he is also a firm believer in the collegiality and professional courtesy of the Bar and maintains a commitment to those hallmarks to create a better system of justice, for all people.\n\nCommunity Service\n\nLife Member Herrington Lake Conservation League\n\nLegal Aid Board Member, 2004-2015\n\nGreat American Brass Band Festival (GABBF) Staff, 1996-present\n\nGABBF Board, 2015-present\n\nSponsor Danville Athletics Hall of Fame, 2007-present\n\nCentre Associates, 2004- Present\n\nCentre College Colonels Club, 2004-Present\n\nDanville Admiral Champions Club, 2010-Present\n\nBoyle/Mercer Model Family Court Program -2012-Present"
