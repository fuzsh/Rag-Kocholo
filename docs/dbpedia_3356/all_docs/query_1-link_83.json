        "text": "Sally J. Cooley to be Inducted into MCC’s Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame\n\nSally J. Cooley of Boise, Idaho, will become the 16th inductee into the Miles Community College Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame during the 76th Annual Commencement Ceremonies on Saturday, May 7.\n\nMiles Community College (MCC) President, Dr. Stacy Klippenstein, has this to say of Sally’s induction into the Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame, “MCC is very proud of Sally Cooley and everything she has accomplished. She is a great example of our slogan, Start Here…Go Anywhere.”\n\nSally grew up in Miles City where she attended Custer County District High School (CCDHS). During her time at CCDHS, she took multiple dual enrollment college credits, which saved her time and money as she pursued her higher education goals. She acquired a total of 48 credits from Miles Community College before transferring to the University of Montana in Missoula where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree. She was then accepted into the Gonzaga University School of Law in Spokane, Washington, where she earned her Juris Doctorate.\n\nWhen asked about her experience at Miles Community College, Sally says, “MCC allowed me to obtain a quality education without the excessive student loan debt that plagues so many students and may limit their career options down the road.”\n\nSally has published articles in the official publication of the Idaho State Bar, the Advocate. She serves as the Deputy State Appellate Public Defender for the Idaho State Appellate Public Defender’s Office and has 10 years of experience as an attorney. Sally has been a member of the Idaho State Bar since April 2006, Idaho State Bar Appellate Practice Section, and the Idaho Women Lawyers, Inc. She served as Co-Chairperson of the Idaho State Bar Labor and Employment Law Section in 2011-2012 and as President of the Gonzaga University School of Law International Law Society in 2004-2005.\n\nVolunteering and community service have been significant to Sally throughout her life. Beginning in high school, Sally volunteered her time at the Miles City Public Library through their Friends of the Library Program and helped with benefit dinners for those in need. Throughout her time in Boise, where her and her family reside, Sally performs pro bono work for Boise’s Stand Down for Homeless Veterans, is an American Red Cross blood and platelet donor, an Ask-A-Lawyer Volunteer Attorney, volunteers with Rake Up Boise and Habitat for Humanity, and is the Roosevelt Elementary School PTA Outdoor Garden Coordinator. Sally is married to her husband, Brad, and they have two children, Deacon and Leo. As explained by Sally, the whole family loves helping out in the Boise community by doing everything from pulling weeds and raking the native plants at the elementary school to bagging fruit at the Idaho Food Bank.\n\nThe Distinguished Alumni criteria are the following:\n\nExhibited high professional achievement\n\nEstablished legacy of community service\n\nGives evidence of lifetime achievement and service since they began their education career at Miles Community College\n\nHave received an associate’s degree from Miles Community College and/or have attended a minimum of one full academic year\n\nSally joins the following list of prior inductees: Brett Badgett (2000-2001), Dr. Allan Curtis Anderson (2001-2002), Randy Holland (2002-2003), James P. Lucas (2003-2004), Carol M. Hofeldt (2004-2005), Harold Luke (2005-2006), Lisa Reid Perry (2006-2007), James Leslie Graham (2008-2009), George M.
