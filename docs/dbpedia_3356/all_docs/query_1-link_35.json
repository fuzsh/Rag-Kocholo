She has said Arizona’s escalating rates of teen suicide, teen pregnancy and dropouts prompted her decision to enter politics. She is a Democratic Leadership Council member.\n\nBecause the 8th District borders Mexico, immigration became a central campaign issue. Giffords advocates a centrist immigration policy, supporting a guest-worker program and allowing illegal immigrants who learn English and pay taxes to gain legal status.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nREP.

His popularity in Vermont, a state known for quirky politicians, is due as much to his feisty personality as his populist message.
