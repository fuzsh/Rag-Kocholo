I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania called Zelienople with five older siblings. In high school, I was a member of the marching band, SVTV (our television broadcast club), Thespians (our drama club), and the Honor Society. I was very active in high school theater. I graduated from Seneca Valley High School with honors and enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, main campus where I studied English Literature, psychology and theatre arts. I spent my free time at the university theater or learning to play pool at the student union. I also was a founding board member of the service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega (Beta Chapter) and attended many Pitt football games cheering for Ironhead Hayworth. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Pitt in 1991 and received a scholarship from Geneva College. After teaching a few years, I decided to attend North Carolina Central University Law School, Evening Program while working full-time. That was a grueling experience, but I graduated Summa Cum Laude as top of the Evening class. I made the transition to full-time attorney in 2006 practicing civil litigation and family law. Since then, I have focused solely on Family Law and Adoptions, have become a NC Board Certified Specialist in Family Law, and have been certified as a Superior Court Civil Mediator and a Family Financial Mediator. I married Scott Montgomery in May 2015 and joined his family firm, Montgomery Family Law, in July 2015. I know what it's like to go through divorce and how to help my clients through the darkness to the light on the other side.
