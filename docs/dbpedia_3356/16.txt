charles e. hayworth, jr.

Charles Hayworth (b.1913 d.1994) was chief executive officer of Hayworth Industries, Alma Desk Company, Clarendon Industries, Hayworth Roll & Panel, Liberty Veneer, and Myrtle Desk.

He received an Industrial Engineering degree from North Carolina State University, served as an Army Lieutenant in Europe, and returned to the family businesses. He directed the growth of Alma Desk from 1955 to 1988 as it became one of the premier office furniture companies in the nation. The firm's success is attributed to the adoption of the assembly line techniques, the introduction at a national trade show in Chicago of his "Office Furniture System" that formed workstations and offices, and a progressive marketing program that covered all 50 states.

As a result of his leadership as president and chairman of the Southern Furniture Exposition Building (now IHFC) from 1986 to 1993, it became the preeminent showroom in the world. Many industry leaders also credit his efforts with helping to keep the market in High Point after takeover attempts by Dallas and Atlanta firms. Working with area investors, he was also a factor in bringing the Radisson Hotel to High Point.

Mr. Hayworth served High Point University as vice chairman of the board and worked to establish and support the Home Furnishings Marketing Program in the early 1970's.

Charles Hayworth and wife, Pauline, received many honors and awards. Their lifetime of service, charitable contributions, and endowments were instrumental in building their industry and community.
