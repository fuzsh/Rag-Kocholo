Student Body President, 1979-1980

Accomplishments

Hayworth lobbied the administration for more student space in the Court of North Carolina. After meeting with Student Government officers, University officials moved the fence surrounding the Court thirty-five yards inward. Construction workers used the fence to protect the area surrounding the construction of the Tompkins-Winston Hall link. The move allowed students more area in the Court to lounge and enjoy the sun. Hayworth said from that point onward, administrators would contact Student Government during the planning and contracting stages of building.

Hayworth pushed for the Classroom Consumer Report, a new form of faculty evaluations. The report consisted of fifteen questions about instructors, lectures, and homework. Other issues that involved Hayworth as student body president were the effect of the Iran hostage crisis on Iranian students at NC State and the impact on the university of negotiations between the UNC System and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare regarding desegregation.
