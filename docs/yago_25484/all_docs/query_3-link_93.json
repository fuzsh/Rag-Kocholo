        "text": "The 33-year-old Brit is currently shooting the last ever season of the hit drama, in which she plays Dr. Neela Rasgotra.\n\nAnd sources claim her alleged pregnancy won't be written into the storyline. Instead, as her tummy grows, it'll be hidden from camera.\n\nAn insider tells the National Enquirer, \"Parminder is thrilled beyond belief.\n\n\"But with the show in its last season, she doesn't want to take anything away from the fanfare. She's happy to be filmed standing behind counters. Viewers won't have a clue. The big lab coats and gurneys will be hiding her belly.\"\n\nNagra's publicist had yet to return requests for comment when approached by WENN to confirm the reports."
