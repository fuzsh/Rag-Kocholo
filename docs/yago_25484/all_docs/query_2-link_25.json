Mark was a great character, truly a pleasure to watch from his bromances, (failed) romances and issues at work towards heavier subject matters. He had such a reassuring aura that when he went through some real shit and lost some of that effect - because he would suddenly lose his cool or be afraid - it really felt awful to the viewer. Mark was the doctor and friend that anyone could look up to, and when the faith in that suddenly wavered... It felt a bit like those moments when you realize that your parents aren't invincible. Not quite as hard, but still. When Mark got hit, it really hurt. When Mark was in pain, it was truly painful. Because this was our Dr. Greene who was warm and funny and so knowledgeable and always trying to do the right thing, but he was hurting. We got to know his parents and where he came from - he wasn't just some rootless character on screen. He was our Dr. Greene, our Mark.\n\nHe was imperfect as fuck, but I was always wishing the best for him. His death was heart-breakingly sad and sweet at the same time. Not many get to sleep away peacefully with their loved ones nearby. Dr. Greene isn't #1 on my list, but he deserves to be the most beloved ER character in history."
