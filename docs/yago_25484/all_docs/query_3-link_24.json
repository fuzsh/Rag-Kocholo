        "text": "“A double date with Ray and Neela?” Luka asked, looking skeptical. OR Luka and Abby go on a doube date with Ray and Neela on the one night they're in Boston. Rated T.\n\nBut talking to Ray? It felt like so much was at stake, just like there’d always had been. The guilt was receding but the fear of losing him was getting stronger the more she thought about the possibility of her and him as a them. OR Ray and Neela finally have a long overdue conversation. Final part in the series.\n\n“Yeah, that’s kind of what I wanted to talk to you about,” Abby said, dragging her spoon through her soup before eating some. “I want you to do something about it.” OR Abby tries to convince Ray to tell Neela how he feels. Sequel to \"What They Would Want\".\n\n“I’m starting to get really worried about Neela,” Abby said one morning as she made a pot of coffee for her and Luka. “ OR Abby convinces Luka to help her talk to Ray (or Neela) about how the two of them should get together.\n\n\"Finally. You're really here?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I really am.\"\n\nThese are such simple words and yet the meanings behind them are so much more and they both know it.\n\nPost-series. In Boston, Abby wants the clean break Luka promised -- to be a woman without a past. But of course it's your past that shapes you and guides the choices you make for your future. A story about starting over.\n\nRay and Neela move to NYC after he completed his residency in Baton Rouge. It is set in early April 2020, during the Covid lockdown, from Neela’s point of view.\n\nBy the end of the day, after a freaking plane had dropped from the sky, Neela had forgotten she'd said Ray could come back to the apartment...\n\nA slow Christmas morning in the ER featuring a special visitor.\n\nThis was two prompts given to me as a part of my '12 days of promptsmas' challenge a very long time ago. I had a lot of fun writing this and I hope you enjoy reading it!\n\nIt’s in the sad moments that Neela is quiet. Written for the Shiny Happy Comment Ficathon. Prompt: ER, Ray/Neela, maybe this mattress will spin on its axis, and find me on yours\n\nEverything is not right in the world of Ray Barnett. Not only did the woman he loves recently move out of their shared apartment, but as of today, all the ER knows about how they had a torrid affair while she was married to another man... Everybody, that is, except Ray."
