        "text": "WITH so many shows, and so many huge ensemble casts, it can be difficult for a supporting player to break out of the pack – unless they are one of these five stellar supporting stars, who command our attention:\n\nJack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin)\n\n30 Rock” (Wednesday, 8 p.m., NBC)\n\nAs the General Electric exec who is appointed to oversee Tina Fey’s show within a show on “30 Rock,” Alec Baldwin steals every scene he’s in. A veteran of dozens of movies and TV shows, Baldwin knows the secret to playing the heavy in this comedy is to play it straight. In “30 Rock,” he neither laughs nor smiles. As a result, he’s hilarious.\n\nTony Gates (John Stamos)\n\n‘ER” (Thursday, 10 p.m., NBC)\n\nBrooding, handsome Tony Gates – paramedic, Gulf War vet, medical student – has rejuvenated “ER” and John Stamos’ career. Gates was introduced last season as a recurring character, but this year, he’s a series regular, and already setting his sights on Dr. Neela Rasgotra (Parminder Nagra), with whom he has begun an exploratory flirtation.\n\nEgan Foote (John Billingsley)\n\n“The Nine” (Wednesday, 10 p.m., ABC)\n\nEgan Foote was the only hostage on “The Nine” whose outlook on life was improved by the bank robbery. On “The Nine,” his cheerful disposition contrasts with that of the other hostages, who came out of the bank siege in somewhat gloomier moods.\n\nJustin (Mark Indelicato)\n\n“Ugly Betty” (Thursday, 8 p.m., ABC)\n\nMark Indelicato (center below with Michael Urie and Becki Newton) is only 12, so it’s safe to assume that Justin, nephew of “Ugly” Betty Suarez (America Ferrera), is 12 too. Then how does he know so much about fashion and, in particular, the magazine, “Mode,” where his aunt works? Well, if Justin is more worldly than most 12-year-olds, then so be it. His scenes, in which he doles out advice on the fashion business, are among the best on “Betty.”\n\nClaire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere)\n\n“Heroes” (Monday, 9 p.m., NBC)\n\nBlonde, petite, apple-cheeked Claire is an all-American high school cheerleader with an incredibly intriguing secret. Like the other heroes on “Heroes,” she possesses a unique ability – Claire cannot be destroyed Already, she has twice been killed, but both times, her grievous injuries (including a broken neck) healed miraculously and she emerged unscarred. How cool is that? But why does Claire have this power? Her shadowy stepfather might know the answer."
