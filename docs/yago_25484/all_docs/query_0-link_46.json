        "text": "A Season 14 Rewrite because it desperately needs it. Starts off at \"I Don't\"\n\nLuka and Abby's first year of marriage and beyond, as it should have been. There will be good, there will be bad, there will be drama. Old friends and new show up along the way as life at County General never gets old and they navigate a whole new set of challenges.\n\nRated E for language and strong sexual content\n\nThe title is taken from Hamlet. All rights to their respective owners.\n\nMedwhump May Day 16- Coma\n\nPart 2 to \"they're the ones who'll spit at you, you will be the one screaming out\"\n\n“Hey.”\n\nNeela looks up, eyes red with tears, hands shaking as she grips the cup of stale coffee she's been forcing herself to drink to stay awake. Pratt is standing in front of her in the break room.\n\n“We… we managed to stabilise him.” he says softly, coming to sit down next to her on the couch. “Put him into a medically-induced coma to protect his brain while we wait for the antibiotics to take effect.”\n\nOR\n\nIn the wake of the seizure, time is ticking to treat Coop.\n\nWhumperless Whump Event Day 5- Wheezing\n\nWhen the call comes in, everybody in the ER is hoping it isn't Coop. Especially Neela.\n\nSevere asthma attack. 26 year old male.\n\nSomehow, because it's his day off and he really ought to be relaxing, it seems almost impossible for him to find himself back in the hospital as a patient. It just… isn't fair.\n\nThat doesn't stop the wheels of the gurney from rolling through the doors, though. Doesn't change the fact that Coop is laying half-conscious on top of it, his quick, shallow breaths fogging a nebulizer mask, his skin so pale it looks ashen.\n\nWhumperless Whump Event Day 14- \"Just let yourself be sick so you can get better.\"\n\nIn the ER bathroom, Coop's hand shakes as he withdraws the thermometer from his lips, eyes still fixed on his pale reflection in the mirror until he can face the reality of his predicament. A deep shudder ripples through his body.\n\nJust check it. What difference will it make?\n\nHis pager beeps once, twice, thrice. Coop doesn't dare to glance down at the reading on the thermometer, instead shoving the device into his pocket and hurriedly exiting the bathroom.\n\nWhumperless Whump Event Day 19- Stuck in an elevator\n\nNeela suspects something's wrong the moment Coop steps into the elevator, a pallor to his cheeks that's only exacerbated by the fluorescent lights overhead. She directs a glance towards Abby, hoping perhaps she'll return it and pick up on Coop’s state too, but the nurse-turned-doctor is distracted, flipping through some papers on a clipboard.\n\nAs the doors close, Coop leans forward to press the button for a few floors up. His hand shakes ever so slightly, but it's quickly returned to his lab coat pocket before the tremors can be examined properly.\n\nHe's fine, right? Coop is... Coop is fine.\n\nWhumperless Whump Event Day 23- Allergic Reaction\n\nAnd just like that, the box of dogs is whisked away elsewhere, and Coop is left with the charts he's currently poring over, as well as a new tightness in his chest.\n\nShit… Really?\n\nHe brings his fist to his mouth, clearing his throat, and only succeeds in making himself cough, a tell-tale wheeze tainting his breaths.\n\nYes, he thinks, rolling his eyes. Really.\n\nOR\n\nWhen Jerry brings that box of puppies into the ER, Coop's asthma flares. Badly.\n\nWhumperless Whump Event Day 31- Alt prompt: Seizure\n\nPart 2 to 'is it a crime to do what you ask me to?'\n\nThey find him where they expect to- on the floor, convulsing, eyes rolled back in his head. His consciousness has long since left him, but on the off chance that there's anything remaining, both Neela and Dr Lewis speak to him as they kneel down and turn him on his side.\n\n“Alright, Coop, you're okay. It's alright.”\n\nOR\n\nThe aftermath"
