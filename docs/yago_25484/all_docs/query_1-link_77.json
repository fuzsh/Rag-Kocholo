Under pressure from his wife, Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene considers leaving County to join a private practice that would give him a much higher salary. When a building collapses, multiple casualties are brought in. New medical students start their ER rotation, among them John Carter, an inexperienced third-year student. As the day continues, Dr. Peter Benton operates on a patient with an aortic aneurysm, a procedure normally performed by senior staff; and charge nurse Carol Hathaway is brought into the ER after a suicide attempt.\n\nDay One\n\nEpisode: 1x02 | Airdate: Sep 22, 1994\n\nSusan treats a baby in respiratory arrest. She later lobbies various departments, unsuccessfully, to admit an elderly patient suffering from dementia. The ER is inundated with a tour group and a wedding party with food poisoning from eating at the same Hofbrauhaus. Carter acts quickly to save a man whose heart has stopped. He also treats a flirtatious patient's rash. A family is critically injured when their car is hit by a habitual drunk driver. Benton's diagnosis of a patient is overridden by the man's personal physician, with dire results. Mark and Jenn celebrate her passing the bar exam. Doug finally visits a recovering Carol.\n\nGoing Home\n\nEpisode: 1x03 | Airdate: Sep 29, 1994\n\nCarol overcomes a few initial jitters and heads back to work in the ER.

The staff celebrates Carol's return with a surprise welcome back party.\n\nHit and Run\n\nEpisode: 1x04 | Airdate: Oct 6, 1994\n\nCarter is deeply affected by the death of a teenage hit and run victim, and fumbles badly when notifying the parents. Benton gets competitive with another surgical resident. Doug mishandles helping a child with a schizophrenic mother. A patient's cell phone accidentally sets off nearby electronic equipment, while another is brought in handcuffed to his mistress. Benton's zeal for his work interferes with his family obligations. Doug makes a clumsy attempt at reconciling with Carol.\n\nInto That Good Night\n\nEpisode: 1x05 | Airdate: Oct 13, 1994\n\nA business supplies salesman in dire need of a heart transplant gathers his family around him in the ER as he prepares for the end. Doug helps an asthmatic teenage girl obtain needed medication when her mother is unable to afford it. Carter worries that he may have contracted an STD. Susan treats a teenager with alcohol poisoning. Jenn prepares to move to Milwaukee and start her new job.\n\nChicago Heat\n\nEpisode: 1x06 | Airdate: Oct 20, 1994\n\nThe air conditioning quits on the hottest day in October. Coupled with closed ERs in two other city hospitals, the end result is an extremely hectic day. With his wife out of town and the babysitter experiencing car trouble, Mark is forced to bring Rachel to work with him. Doug treats a five-year-old suffering from a cocaine overdose. Ivan, the liquor store owner, shoots and seriously wounds a young teenager. Susan's sister Chloe drops by, wreaking havoc in Susan's life and absconding with a number of valuables. Doug hooks up with a pharmaceuticals representative.\n\nAnother Perfect Day\n\nEpisode: 1x07 | Airdate: Nov 3, 1994\n\nBenton and Langworthy interview for the Starze Fellowship.
