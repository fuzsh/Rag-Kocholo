        "text": "Approximately seven years after the end of the Dominion War, Elim Garak and Dr. Julian Bashir have been enjoined for nearly six years and are living on Cardassia Prime where Julian works in the Capital’s hospital while Garak is involved in unspoken government work. They appear to be a very productive, very happy couple…but is all really well?\n\nBecause of his illegal enhancements, Julian is a Carrier; in other words, he has the parts to produce and carry children. Unfortunately for him, the process that made him who he is has also left him with flaws and those flaws complicate his and Garak's desire to have what they want most...a family.\n\nJulian must not only come to terms with the complications, but also accept that he is not alone in dealing with his sorrow...\n\nVoldemort is dead, but what if all was NOT well? What if former Death Eaters who survived the Battle of Hogwarts went on to re-introduce the wizarding world into turmoil? Many are affected, some die, and some are left scarred...\n\nI don't own Harry Potter and I DO NOT support the transphobic views promoted by J.K. Rowling. I fully support the diversity that the Harry Potter world promotes, however.\n\nHe couldn’t say why, exactly, he wanders into the tailor’s shop one morning. He buys strictly off-the-rack and the only suit he’s ever had tailored was his wedding suit. Maybe it’s that as he walks past, he hears a radio playing the repetitive “beep…beep…beep” of Sputnik passing overhead. It’s not a particularly pleasant sound, in the abstract, but for some people—like him—it might as well be the comforting sound of a heartbeat.\n\n---\n\nScience-fiction writer Julius Eaton meets not-so-simple tailor Elim Garak in the midst of the Space Race."
