        "text": "So, dear readers and skimmers, this messy compilation of whom I‚Äôve deemed to be my favorite fictional heroes, antiheroes and villains may or may not interest you, but in case it does, please feel free to add your own favorite-and-most-fascinating fictional characters below in the comments!\n\nMy whole life I‚Äôve been saturated in and inspired by numerous forms of the arts, and these fictional individuals, their mediums and even their performers have left a lasting impact on my personality, imagination and subsequent artistry. Even so, I call this a broad favorites list because it ranges from life-long beloved characters to those I scarcely remember to those I just found*. How‚Äôs that for specific? Annoying? Probably.\n\nWhile I expect we may have different opinions when it comes to these categorizations (the definition of ‚Äúantihero‚Äù that I subscribe to is best illustrated on Writersdigest.com‚Äîan excellent resource for writers, by the way), I thought it might be neat to share who has shaped me and my work and invite you to share who has shaped you and yours. After all, this is a corner of the internet in which inspiration is free to be celebrated and shared. üôÇ\n\nMy Favorite Fictional Heroines\n\nMatilda Wormwood (Matilda)\n\nBubbles, Blossom, Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls ‚Äì OG PPG, ‚Äôcause seriously, enough with this reboot crap‚Ä¶)\n\nKimberly Ann ‚ÄúKim‚Äù Possible (Kim Possible)\n\nBulma, Videl, Android 18, Pan, Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball Z/Dragon Ball Super)\n\nHermione Granger [-Weasley], Luna Lovegood (Harry Potter series)\n\nElizabeth Swann (Pirates of the Caribbean series)\n\nBuffy Summers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel)\n\nDorothy Zbornak, Sophia Petrillo, Rose Nylund, Blanche Deveraux (The Golden Girls)\n\nClara Oswald, Martha Jones, Bill Potts, Amelia ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù Pond, Donna Noble, series 1 Rose Tyler (Doctor Who)\n\nDr. Elizabeth ‚ÄúLiz‚Äù Cruz, Julia McNamara, Sofia Lopez (Nip/Tuck)\n\nOfficer/Lieutenant/Detective Debra Morgan (Dexter)\n\n‚ÄúMiss Rusty‚Äù Zimmerman (Flawless)\n\nClaire Fisher, Brenda Chenowith, Vanessa Diaz, Ruth Fisher, Sarah O‚ÄôConnor, Bettina, Edie, Maggie Sibley, Jackie Feldman, Angela (Six Feet Under)\n\nMichonne [Hawthorne/Grimes], Maggie Greene [Rhee], Andrea Harrison, Sasha Williams, Connie (The Walking Dead)\n\nClementine, Christa, Carley, Jane, Violet (The Walking Dead video game)\n\nLana Winters, Cordelia Foxx/Goode, Violet Harmon, Queenie, Nan, Myrtle Snow, Vivien Harmon, Dot Tattler, Liz Taylor, Mallory (American Horror Story: Asylum /Coven /Murder House /Freak Show /Hotel /Apocalypse)\n\nDetective Lydia Adams, Detective Josie Ochoa (Southland)\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor (Doctor Who)\n\nSara Howard (The Alienist TV series)\n\nHonorable Mentions: Fa Mulan, Tiana, Moana, Belle, Jasmine, Merida (Disney Princesses); Junie B.

Its predecessor, you ask? Why, the fusion-promoting, dead-resurrecting, acid trip of a movie that was surprisingly poignant in a couple places! Oh yes, casual readers.\n\nTo my fellow fans: *mimics the Kool-Aid Man voice* OHH YEAH. Crazy, Snorlax-lookin‚Äô, mutated‚Ä¶\n\nMODERATE spoilers for BoG abound, but a smidgeon of background first: I love Dragon Ball Z and did in fact run out with a friend to see Battle of Gods in theaters this summer. I‚Äôve been a staunch fan of the U.S. version since I was about five, I believe. I played with Barbies, Beanie Babies and DBZ figurines in elementary school and think these things are a lot more unisexual in nature and appeal than some people may think, but I digress.\n\nAnyway, the energy in the theater was palpable. Everyone was all hyper and jittery with suppressed excitement. When the lights dimmed, I heard a guy behind my friend and me shout out ‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù Instantly I answered back: ‚ÄúYEAH!‚Äù The theater then erupted with whoops and cheers and claps. I haven‚Äôt felt that kind of camaraderie with strangers since the premiere of the last Harry Potter film, and to be submerged in an atmosphere with that kind of emotive connectivity, to feel kindred to 100 other people you don‚Äôt know but you know are with you every step of the way, is a truly magical sensation. Now, why does this movie send chills down my spine, put the creative fire in my belly and make my cheeks hurt from grinning too much? Weeelll‚Ä¶\n\n1. The Voice Actors. I do respect the Japanese cast and have no particular problem watching the show in its native language as long as the subtitles are accurate, but I grew up with the FUNimation dub. Se√°n Schemmel, Christopher Sabat and co. provided some of the most inspirational lines of my childhood, and even though it‚Äôs years later, their voices took me right back (a little millennial nostalgia right there, am I right, Toonami watchers?).\n\nIt was refreshing to hear the actors‚Äô more refined takes on their characters and delightful to get fine-tuned translations for the original dialogue (‚ÄúCan you give me like, five minutes please?‚Äù). It feels more authentic since the lingo reflects the current time period whereas you can tell DBZ and its dubs were written in the ‚Äô80s-‚Äô90s. Along with more believable exchanges (though I love the corny stuff, too), there are so many nice little gifts the voice actors proffered for long-time fans especially: We got Goku‚Äôs impression of Vegeta; some meaty but not self-indulgent screams; a sprinkling of swears; some nice character inflections on Vegeta‚Äôs lines (‚ÄúFor once I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not me‚Äù); some meta humor (‚ÄúWhy would you fly through the air to move 25 feet?‚Äù) and comical yet commanding personalities for new characters Beerus (or Bills) and Whis, voiced by Jason Douglas and Ian Sinclair, respectively. In my opinion, the choice to use most of the original FUNi cast was a definite coup.\n\n2. Development of Character Development. What I mean by this is that they managed to reveal lesser known things about well-known characters with a few well-written conversations instead of a three-season story arc or a clunky line that spells out the obvious (though Roshi has one of those, ergh). It was a pleasurable challenge for both the fan and writer inside me to listen and learn about a familiar universe while watching a good amount of tense action at the same time. I want to layer my work similarly, want my stories to elucidate at different levels and influence multiple senses and sensations. What‚Äôs interesting here is that a lot of the final character arcs established toward the end of Z carried over to this film, but at this juncture the characters have only halfway changed, which fits since the movie is set midway between the end of the Buu arc and Uub segment of Z.\n\nHere, Majin Buu is still selfish although relatively docile; he hasn‚Äôt quite learned to play nicely with strangers but, as we know, he soon will (DBZ episode 287). The same could be said for Vegeta, whom we know to be ‚Äúa good guy‚Äù at this point, but not a good guy who feels as comfortable or ‚Äúmellow‚Äù about that judgment as he will in the final episodes of DBZ (BoG: ‚ÄúThe Prince of all Saiyans is not some righteous-hearted goodie-goodie!‚Äù vs. DBZ episode 290, where he very gently disposes of some punk for insulting him instead of straight-up murdering him). This film foreshadows the rest of his arc perfectly. Vegeta sacrifices every scrap of his pride to protect his family and guests, doing everything in his power NOT to start a fight with a being who once dishonored his father. It‚Äôs hard to believe and impressive to behold. I‚Äôm continually in awe of Vegeta for many different reasons, and I love how dynamic his character is compared to how static someone like Goku is.\n\nThen again, maybe ‚Äústatic‚Äù isn‚Äôt the right classification. I didn‚Äôt think we would ever learn anything more about Goku, as he has always been very simple, but we did! It turns out he ‚Äúhates‚Äù that he can‚Äôt achieve God-form without external support. True, he‚Äôs hinted about this sore point in the past, but never before has he expounded on these feelings as deeply as he does in BoG. Interesting! But silly Goku. Hasn‚Äôt he learned by now that many of the boosts he‚Äôs gained, when he can‚Äôt reach them himself, are due to his using his family and friends as motivation? Others are always a part of his power‚Äîhis love and concern for them‚Äîand that‚Äôs the most potent power there is. All right, enough of my ‚Äúsentimental rubbish.‚Äù\n\n3. Technical Aspects. I will always prefer the Faulconer score (I own 61 of his themes from the American release), but the music is still well done, aided by the genius addition of ‚ÄúHero‚Äù by Flow. Had to scoop that rockin‚Äô track up, too. And then there‚Äôs cleaner, crisper animation with fight scenes that make you feel like you‚Äôre witnessing it all firsthand‚Äîthere are a couple of shots of SSJGod Goku zipping through a rocky landscape to meet Beerus head-on that were straight out of the Battle of Z video game. I‚Äôve heard the gripes about too much computer generation, but it personally didn‚Äôt bother me. In this movie, you‚Äôre placed so close to it all, you‚Äôre in it all, viewing from every angle, trying to catch your breath, and it‚Äôs exhilarating, especially for us super fans.\n\n4. A Strong Canon Storyline. Can we ask for anything more? Everything looked good, felt good and I liked the concept of a Super Saiyan God. At first I was surprised by its legend, but given Toriyama‚Äôs recent creation of Goku‚Äôs mother, Gine, and the modifications made to bits of the backstory (yep, Dragon Ball Minus), I buy the way SSJGod came about better than I might have during the earlier seasons of DBZ. Along with a new transformation, we also got an interesting villain in that Beerus the Destroyer isn‚Äôt exactly a villain, but more so a being in whose wake our heroes are swept up. Nor is he one-dimensional as opposed to, say, Kid Buu. Layered antagonists for the win! Beerus is comedic, polite‚Ä¶to a point, shrewd, matter-of-fact and I have no words for how much I love his battle and rapport with Goku. Didn‚Äôt see that ending coming either. It opened up so much‚Ä¶\n\nTrue, there are a couple inconsistencies it seems (Bulma‚Äôs voice is different and shouldn‚Äôt she be pregnant with Bulla if we‚Äôre at this point between the Buu saga and Uub segment? Also, she is so not the age she claims to be, but for those of us who know Bulma, we know it wouldn‚Äôt be out of character for her to lie for vanity‚Äôs sake), but they‚Äôre overlookable, at least for me. No story is perfect, but a respectable amount of effort garners respect in turn.\n\n5. Fan Service. I enjoy it, to a degree. I don‚Äôt really label it as ‚Äúwishy-washy‚Äù writing on the creators‚Äô part, but more of a wink or a nudge to certain lines or scenarios they know fans adore; they appreciate that we appreciate their work, and I appreciate that. I believe in giving audiences some semblance of what they want from time to time as long as it doesn‚Äôt derail an artist‚Äôs ultimate design. They found a way to do that here. We get our beloved cast with everyone receiving a moment or two (so many in-jokes and antics‚Ä¶we impregnated the theater air with so much laughter). They brought back Pilaf and his gang to pay homage to Dragon Ball (yay!) and sate the people who did like GT (nah, I‚Äôm not one of them). There was even a reference to a past special that was never dubbed in English, so that was a cool Easter egg for the fans who‚Äôve seen the Japanese dub of Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!\n\nMy preferred moment of fan service stems from my own sentimentality, as my favorite piece of the entire movie is the simple shot of Goku grasping Vegeta‚Äôs hand in empowerment. Every change in character, every saving throw, every good-natured joke about the show‚Äôs brotherhood/playful sense of homoeroticism‚Äîi.e. the entire series and everything it stands for‚Äîis in that shot and I love it. I‚Äôm also long-winded, as you can tell, and enjoy a lengthy dialogue. Uncut, this movie is 1 hour and 45 minutes long! YAY! But don‚Äôt worry. When the fights do crop up, they effectively mix thrills, old-school moves and sharp, breathtaking visuals. The fights in particular inspire me to write some action scenes or work out; they give me new energy, the fancy-free energy of the dumb, spirited dreamer I once was (and often aspire to be again). I‚Äôve seen BoG three times and that surge of life (ki!) has not diminished. As a child, a teen, a college student and as an adult, DBZ has fueled my will, illustrated to me what it means to have [a healthy sense of] pride and has awakened in me all kinds of strength and for now, the ‚Äúpower‚Äù I derive from Battle of Gods is the most intense.\n\nI do think only hard-core DBZ fans will fully appreciate every nuance of this movie, but for comparison, it would be like if J.K. Rowling decided to add another chapter to the epilogue of the Harry Potter series (actually, wasn‚Äôt there a rumor that she did?)‚Äîthe excitement level in Japan and internationally was that high for this film, and it warms my heart. This franchise and these characters are still so fundamentally important to so many of us, and I‚Äôm glad Akira Toriyama is helping them to shine once again. Next up is Resurrection F, which features Frieza as the main villain (hark, I hear groans, queries, and cheers all at once!). It‚Äôs slated for release in Japan on April 18, 2015, so in North America, we‚Äôll probably get it for the 2016 summer (please be sooner than that).\n\nEDIT: It‚Äôs sooner than that! August 4 ‚Äì 12 in North America!\n\nBetter start my training now‚Äîit‚Äôll take nerves of steel to calm the fangirl inside‚Ä¶\n\nSo, fellow entertainment buffs and DBZ fans, if you want to reawaken the child inside and learn a couple new things about this period in Dragon Ball lore, I highly recommend this movie. Unless of course, you‚Äôd rather just imagine it for yourself. Either way, you won‚Äôt go wrong. What do you think? What other anime features or series revitalize your energy and give you all the right power-ups? Feel free to share your inspirations below while I go off to jam to ‚ÄúHero‚Äù by Flow, the aforementioned tune to which I wrote this post. Do I remember the translated lyrics? No. Do I understand what they‚Äôre saying? Nope. Do I care? Nuh-uh. Because when a song‚Äôs that spectacular, it transcends cultural barriers. And to me, this song, this movie, its sentiment and our excitement‚Äîall of it is universal.\n\n‚ÄìBP"
