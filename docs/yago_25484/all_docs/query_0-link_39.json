        "text": "\"I still remember when Mark Greene and Doug Ross were running the place,\" longtime\n\n\"ER\"\n\nnurse Chuny Marquez lamented in a recent episode.\n\n\"Who?\" two of her newer colleagues responded. \"ER\" has been on the air for so long - its 300th episode airs tonight - that original characters like Mark (Anthony Edwards) and Doug (played by that Clooney guy) are complete strangers to most of the characters, and maybe even a good chunk of the audience. The longest-tenured regular cast member is Maura Tierney, who didn't join the show full-time until midway through season six.\n\nBut though the faces change, one thing has remained constant: Working in the County General ER is a very exciting, often dangerous job. The place has been attacked with gunfire, falling helicopters, car crashes, and even a stolen tank.\n\nAs a tribute to the enduring (if not always realistic) medical drama, a look at some - but not remotely all - of the memorable catastrophes that have taken place in and around the ER since the series premiered in September 1994:\n\n\"Blizzard\" (Season 1, episode 10): County General is the only major trauma center open during a massive snowstorm. Many roles reverse - including orderly \"Bob\" revealing herself to be a foreign-trained doctor - in a template for all the disaster episodes to follow.\n\n\"Hell and High Water\" (Season 2, episode 7): On the verge of being fired, Doug Ross becomes a media hero when he saves a boy trapped in a storm drain during a torrential downpour.\n\n\"The Long Way Around\" (Season 3, episode 15): Carol Hathaway has to push her nursing training to the limits when she gets caught up in a hostage crisis at a convenience store.\n\n\"Random Acts\" (Season 3 episode 20): Mark Greene is badly beaten in the ER men's room.\n\n\"Exodus\" (Season 4, episode 15): Chaos reigns when a benzene spill forces the ER to be evacuated and incapacitates ER chief Kerry Weaver. John Carter takes charge of the situation, while Doug and Carol try to keep a little girl alive when they're trapped in an elevator without her dialysis machine.\n\n\"The Storm\" (Season 5, episodes 14 & 15): When a school bus overturns in the middle of another blizzard, Doug breaks protocol to drive to the scene, nearly killing himself and Jeanie Boulet when their car crashes.\n\n\"Be Still My Heart\" (Season 6, episode 13): Carter and Lucy Knight are stabbed (Lucy fatally) by a psych patient.\n\n\"May Day\" (Season 6, episode 22): Doctors Peter Benton and Luka Kovac report to the scene of a school shooting and get into an ethical dispute over whom to treat first: the shooter or his victims.\n\n\"The Crossing\" (Season 7, episode 15): Carter, years removed from giving up his surgical career, is called upon to perform a complex amputation (with coaching from Benton) when he and Luka are the doctors on scene at a train wreck.\n\n\"Rampage\" (Season 7, episode 22): The abusive father of a boy whom Greene recently treated goes on a shooting rampage throughout the city, targeting the people who took his son away. When the shooter, shot by police, flatlines in the elevator, Greene lets him die.\n\n\"Partly Cloudy, Chance of Rain\" (Season 8, episode 8): In another downpour, Weaver and Michael Gallant help deliver the baby of a woman stuck in a crashed ambulance that's under a sparking power line.\n\n\"Lockdown\" & \"Chaos Theory\" (Season 8, episode 22 & Season 9, episode 1): Carter, Abby Lockhart, Deb Chen and Greg Pratt are quarantined in the ER during an apparent smallpox outbreak; while trying to evacuate a surgical patient, Rocket Romano's arm is cut off by a helicopter blade.\n\n\"Freefall\" (Season 10, episode 8): Helicopters continue to have it out for Romano, as one falls off the hospital roof, directly onto poor Rocket. Susan Lewis' husband Chuck, believed dead in the crash, turns out to have been kicked off the flight at the last minute.\n\n\"Forgive and Forget\" (Season 10, episode 16): When Archie Morris discharges a veteran patient without getting him a psych consult, the man steals an old Army tank and begins driving it towards County General.\n\n\"Drive\" (Season 10, episode 22): Pratt and Chen are shot at while driving and crash into the river.\n\n\"Skin\" (Season 11, episode 10): Abby is kidnapped in the ambulance bay by gangbangers who need her to patch up a wounded friend.\n\n\"The Show Must Go On\" (Season 11, episode 22): Ray Barnett performs triage when a balcony collapses at a party he was attending.\n\n\"Two Ships\" (Season 12, episode 8): A commercial jet and a passenger plane crash over Chicago on a night when Neela Rasgotra is doing a ride-along with paramedic (and future ER doc) Tony Gates.\n\n\"21 Guns\" (Season 12, episode 22): Sam Taggart's convict ex-husband escapes from custody and gets into a shoot-out with police in the ER; drugs and nearly kills Luka; endangers the life of Abby's unborn baby, and kidnaps Sam and their son.\n\n\"Scoop and Run\" (Season 13, episode 9): In the middle of a medical transfer flight, Abby comes across a bus crash and heroically pulls out passengers before the whole thing plummets into a ravine.\n\n\"I Don't\" (Season 13, episode 21): After fighting with Gates at Luka and Abby's wedding, Ray walks home drunk and is hit by a truck, leading to the amputation of both legs."
