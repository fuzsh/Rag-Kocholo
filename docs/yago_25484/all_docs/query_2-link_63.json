        "text": "County General had a lot of people pass through, but who was the greatest and who was the worst?\n\nJohn Carter played by Noah Wyle\n\nDr. John Carter was the longest running character in the series and that was for good reason. Carter went through many ups and downs throughout his run and never stopped being a compelling individual. He was the show at its core and filled the hole left by Anthony Edwards after his season eight departure.\n\nMark Greene played by Anthony Edwards\n\nIf Carter was the show Greene was the heart of the show. The show was an ensemble, but the main focus really centered on Greene’s journey as a doctor, friend, husband and father for the first eight seasons. Greene was the kind of guy you’d want to be your doctor and just about everyone could relate to.\n\nLuka Kovac played by Goran Visnjic\n\nKovac was sent in as the replacement to bad boy Doug Ross and some ways exceeded that character. Kovac was different from the other characters with an interesting background and compelling journey through his seasons on the show.\n\nElizabeth Corday played by Alex Kingston\n\nAside from the fact that Alex Kingston is absolute gold in human form, Corday was a character worth watching. She was tough and soft and held her own as a woman in a highly competitive male field.\n\nMichael Gallant played by Sharif Atkins\n\nGallant started off as a quiet underdog and developed into one of E.R.’s finest. His military background added personality you didn’t expect to his character.\n\nPeter Benton played by Eriq La Salle\n\nBenton started off as a bit standoffish, but once his son was born the character evolved completely. Benton was the perfect opposite to Greene and gave a unique balance to the series.\n\nRay Barnett played by Shane West\n\nAfter many of the original characters began to depart from the series good new characters were hard to come by. Barnett was one of those good characters; he brought new story and personality to the show when it was in need of some new and interesting blood.\n\nCarol Hathaway played by Julianna Margulies\n\nLong before she was the good wife Marguiles was Chicago’s greatest nurse. Her relationship with Doug was great, but she had many other interesting stories ahead of her.\n\nDoug Ross played by George Clooney\n\nBelieve it or not, George Clooney wasn’t always super famous. Doug was the original suave hottie of the E.R., his reckless decisions were what ultimately lead to his departure from the series, but they made for excellent story.\n\nJing-Mei “Deb” Chen played by Ming-Na\n\nDr. Chen was like a female Carter, who also happened to be Carter’s best friend. Her unexpected pregnancy was one of her best moments and one of the best moments of the show.\n\nJeanie Boulet played by Gloria Reuben\n\nJeanie had one of the most culturally important storylines when she discovered she was HIV positive. Her story was smart, riveting and brilliantly acted by Reuben.\n\nAbby Lockhart played by Maura Tierney\n\nAbby had her moments, sometimes being a favorite and other times a least favorite. Even when she was doing things that made her unlikable, the stories were great to watch.\n\nRobert Romano played by Paul McCrane\n\nSure he was an ass, but he was an ass that knew how to make good television. When he died you were shocked at how much you actually missed Romano.\n\nSusan Lewis played by Sherry Stringfield\n\nSusan’s family life was one of her stronger storylines; she’d be higher on the list if she hadn’t left for such a long period of time and returned.\n\nDave Malucci played by Erik Palladino\n\nMalucci was a character that never got the time he deserved. He had a lot of potential with his background, his med school days and personal life but none of it was ever truly tapped. He was an amazing character who had a shot at being one of the best, but wasn’t given the time.\n\nKerry Weaver played by Laura Innes\n\nKerry would probably be higher on this list if it weren’t for the fact that when re-watching the series I was reminded of how horribly she treated some of her colleagues. She had interesting stories, but her brash, occasionally power hungry personality made it hard for the audience to like her.\n\nArchie Morris played by Scott Grimes\n\nArchie was one of the better characters introduced in the final five seasons. He was a fun guy with a cute red head and a nice relationship with a cop.\n\nGreg Pratt played by Mekhi Phifer\n\nPratt continued the tradition of having one brash, full of himself doctor on staff. Of all the brash guys that passed through the E.R. Pratt was the hardest to actually enjoy.\n\nAnna Del Amico played by Maria Bello\n\nAnna wasn’t in the show quite long enough to ever get interesting. She had great potential to be with Carter and with her past, but none of it ever quite got any attention.\n\nSam Taggart played by Linda Cardellini\n\nSam had a great story with her crazy ex, but nothing else ever really stood out about her. She was better than some of the late season characters; however I had trouble seeing her as anything but Velma the whole time.\n\nLucy Knight played by Kellie Martin\n\nLucy was another, could-have-been character. She didn’t get as much time as she deserved, but her death was one of the most impactful of the series.\n\nCatherine Banfield played by Angela Bassett\n\nShe was played by Angela Bassett which made her at least a little cool, other than that it’s hard to recall much of what her character was up to.\n\nNeela Rasgotra played by Parminder Nagra\n\nIt was hard to ever get into Neela she made bad choices that were hard to get behind and it was hard to ever feel the chemistry between her and Ray.\n\nTony Gates played by John Stamos\n\nTony was another one of the late series additions that never really took. Stamos is a charmer, but the final seasons of the show just didn’t offer enough great story to give him a chance.\n\nSimon Brenner played by David Lyons\n\nBrenner had a similar fate to that of Gates, he was only in the final two seasons and by the time he was made a regular in the shows 15th and final season the focus had returned to old favorites and Brenner got lost in the sea of returns.\n\nCleo Finch played by Michael Michele\n\nTotal honesty, Cleo was in the show for three whole years and I completely forgot her character existed. Cleo never really had her own storylines of personality, she just happened to be Benton’s girlfriend. Even her HIV scare was brushed under the rug and forgotten about."
