Look, you know we're supposed to be together. I knew it the first time I saw you two years ago. And you know it too. I know you do.\"\n\nLike any avid TV fan, I love when I get to see my favorite fictional couples be happy together. Fluffy, domestic scenes? Wholesome, silly little moments of affection that prove how good the characters are together? Chef's kiss.\n\nBut you know what else I really love? ANGST.
