The final section of the book looks at two plays that confront the issue of privanza, La amistadcastigada and Ganar amigos. It contains a detailed consideration ofMachi avellianism and Taciteanism in early modern Spain, before arguing that La amistad is anti-Machiavellian despite there being an element of necessary dissimulation in the resolution of the plot-it shows selfish deceits to be ultimately counter-productive while rewarding those whose dissimulations involve the sacrifice of personal interests towider social goods. The second work foregrounds the desirability, if not necessity, of some degree of dissimulation in political life. Together they refute amoral pragma tism and vindicate the virtues of courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice, which are shown not to be negated by a degree of prudent dissimulation but in fact complemented by it. This book reveals an extraordinary erudition and the fertility of Golden Age studies at the moment. We can look forward to the development of many of these themes in future publications. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON ALEXANDER SAMSON Crossing Fields inModern Spanish Culture. Ed. by FEDERICOBONADDIO and XON DE Ros. Oxford:Legenda. 2003. xvi+202 Pp. ?35. ISBN I-900755-87-4. Federico Bonaddio and Xon de Ros have put together a very useful series of short and punchy articles which span over a hundred and fifty years of Spanish culture, from the i86os to the present day, and amultiplicity of genres from opera to popular music, from pictorial art to ballet, which have interrelated with and cross-fertilized the core disciplines of this collection: literature and cinema. Conventional, cultural, and scientific history also figure prominently in a project whose overarching impetus is the examination of the interdependence of cultural form and intellectual culture in Spain in a century and a half which saw major upheaval and change on a soci etal, technological, and, above all, political level. Some of the great names of what may still be described as themainstream Castilian canon-Rosalia de Castro, Lorca, Alberti-are present, as are prominent contemporary voices such as Javier Marias and Esther Tusquets. There are also lesser-known twentieth-century figures such as Carmen Conde, Concha Mendez, and Jose Maria Hinojosa, and even more obscure nineteenth-century ones, such as the intriguing Agustin Bonnat. Along with the in clusion of Tusquets, there is some discussion of the nineteenth-century fiction and avant-garde culture in general in Catalonia, and Rosalia and her husband Manuel Murguia are also mentioned, allowing for a token reference to culture in Galicia. Aspects of the work of all these writers and thinkers are placed in fruitful juxtaposi tion with related developments in painting, illustration, or popular music and new insights, often into texts which are perhaps slightly too familiar at times (Sobre los ingeles or the Lamento por Ignacio Sanchez Mejias), are achieved which render the too familiar fresh and new and the rather more obscure genuinely fascinating. The range of reference to non-literary art forms in these essays is eclectic and stimulating, from the paintings of Eugenio Lucas in the mid-nineteenth century, to the work of the illustrator Norah Borges, the surrealist artist Angel Planells, the art critic Se bastia Gasch, grand opera in France and Germany, theAmerican blues tradition, and classical ballet, and the connections made are, in each instance, vital and cogently argued. The latter third of the collection deals with ballet and television and cinema, with particular emphasis on the interaction between Spanish cinema and Hollywood, most notably in a very clear and entertaining article by Jo Labanyi on mid-twentieth century Hollywood and Spanish Don Juan films which admirably sums up the ethos MLR, I0 I .3, 2006 877 of this series of essays, about myth and counter-myth, projections of identity and un dermining strategies, clashes of culture and collaborations between artists. Without doubt this collection would make an excellent addition to any university library. The essays on canonical texts may very well prove invaluable to undergraduate students while those on lesser-known writers, artists, and cinematographers will surely fulfil the same function for postgraduates and the academic community..."
