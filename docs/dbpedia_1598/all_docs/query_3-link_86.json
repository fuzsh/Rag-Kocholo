Sanders\n\nBeginning Performances October 15, 2017 – December 17, 2017\n\nPress Opening is October 29, 2017 at The Cherry Lane Theatre\n\nNew York: The Bench stars Robert Galinsky and marks the New York directorial debut of Jay O. Sanders, it will begin its limited run at the Cherry Lane Theatre (38 Commerce Street) on October 15 and will initially run Sunday evening at 7pm through December 17, 2017, and will celebrate its press opening on Sunday, October 29.

This production is being presented by Golden Globe Nominated Chris Noth, Drama Desk, Obie, Olivier Award winner Barry Shabaka Henley and Cherry Lane Theatre. The Bench is produced by Tony Award winning producer Terry Schnuck.\n\nBased on true stories, The Bench, set in urban decay and rubble, explores the emotional heartbreak of five homeless characters and the catastrophic hysteria surrounding AIDs in the 1980’s. The sparse set is accented with hand-drawn imagery, from Daphne Arthur’s graphic novel adaptation of the play, and audio design is by world re-known composer and multi-instrumentalist Deep Singh. It’s a unique and fresh solo theatre piece wherein one actor plays five characters, written in dialogue form, not traditional ‘monologue black out, monologue black out’ traditional solo theatre form.\n\nThe Bench has been called “effortless-really quite extraordinary.” Backstage Magazine; “The Bench features ensemble work, being done by one human being, with sustainable characters that have incredible nuances. It is palpably and real.” Anney Bonney, Curator at The Kitchen; ‘Galinsky’s street dwellers speak in their own voices, and their voices ring true.” The New Haven Independent; “Not your normal kind of theatre… it keeps your head moving.” The NY Amsterdam News; “Galinsky herds multiple personalities into an evening of furious poetic justice.” New York Press.\n\nListing info:\n\nThe Bench\n\nWritten and performed by Robert Galinsky, directed by Jay O.

Christy Rupp, FF Alumn, at Cross Contemporary Art, Saugerties, NY, thru Oct. 29\n\nSOLO SHOW- CHRISTY RUPP: CATASTROPHOZOIC*\n\n*the long emergency, from the Greek root pertaining to animals\n\nOpening Reception Sat. Sept. 30th, 5-8pm Exhibition on view Friday, Sept 29- Sunday, Oct. 29\n\nCross Contemporary Art is pleased to present Christy Rupp: Catastrophozoic. The term Catastrophozoic, refers to an alternate classification of an era that emphasizes animal life rather than human existence This naming differs from the generally accepted term Anthropocene, which marks the age during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate. Christy Rupp’s solo show at Cross Contemporary Art focuses on the ways that humans are currently contributing to climate chaos with activities ranging from indiscriminate carbon emissions, water contamination and resource extraction and the threat these unchecked behaviors have on planet and its many life forms.\n\nChristy Rupp explores these themes in paper collages and sculptures that unite the irony of art history’s romantic vision of the natural world with the incongruity of watching nature fight back. In some of her works on paper, reproductions of Hudson River School paintings are bisected by train-pulled oil cars or a maze of leaking pipelines. Her welded steel and plastic sculptures study the vulnerablity of birdlife found through the lens of art history- from Frida Kahlo’s frightened “Parrots” to Fabritius’ captured “Goldfinch”, to Miro’s “Person Throwing a Stone at a Bird”. Rupp constructs these birds from discarded plastic netting used in supermarkets for wrapping produce- materials that are discarded yet remain. This plastic refuse persists in the environment, threatening the digestive systems and habitat of wildlife. According to art writer Eleanor Heartney, Christy Rupp “captures the sense that we have entered a new era in which humans are redirecting natural history in a way that will be calamitous for all”\n\nAbout Christy Rupp:\n\nChristy Rupp has been on the forefront of urban ecology living and working in New York City and the Catskills for the past 4 decades. Her wry humor paired with a naturalist’s curiosity had led her to explore the biosphere and its multi-layered systems.She has received grants from NYSCA, NEA, Art Matters INC., Anonymous Was a Woman, and a CALL grant from the Joan Mitchell Foundation. Christy Rupp has exhibited her artwork internationally and as an early participant of CoLab, is also part of Art History.\n\nCHRISTY RUPP: CATASTROPHOZOIC opens with a reception for the artist on Saturday, Sept 30, 5-8pm and runs through October 29, 2017.\n\nAbout Cross Contemporary Art: Cross Contemporary Art is a gallery dedicated to showing mid-career and established artists who have a connection to New York City, Hudson Valley and Catskills region.

The body is a place in the front line, where “I” form a relationship with others, and a contact zone through which “I” encounter various situations in the world. At the same time, it is a “storehouse of memory,” where the past is inscribed, and a “social place,” where biopolitics function through power, capital, and knowledge. Since the 1960s, many artists who sought to bring the realm of life into art and integrate the two favored the body as an artistic medium, because the body is the fundamental existence of human life from the past to the present.\n\nRepresenting thirty-eight artists and collectives from Korea and abroad, this exhibition is divided into three parts, based on gestural approaches to our life stories and on artistic attitudes. Part 1, titled “Performing Collective Memory and Culture,” illuminates works that recompose historical memory and cultural heritage through gestures. This section examines actions of Korean performance artists and Japanese avant-garde groups from the 1960 and 70s and how they used gestures to respond to and resist the particular socio-political conditions of the time. Part 2, titled “Everyday Gestures, Social Choreography,” takes the perspective of “social choreography” to cast light on works after the 1960s, which brought everyday gestures into the context of art to highlight issues of reality and life. Part 3, titled “Performing Community,” introduces works that use the body to reenact the social issues of our communities that arose amidst the rise of globalization after the late 1990s, as well as collective performances that involve intimate encounters of bodies and experiment with temporary communities based on collaboration and communication.\n\nThe gestures in Reenacting History record history that language failed to write down, history that cannot be summoned by language, and the history of trauma and absence that language cannot possibly bear. For this reason, “writing down history through gestures” could be an “alternative, resistant recording of history.”\n\nA variety of cultural programs including a series of lectures and symposiums will be held to help visitors better understand the exhibition. A lecture-performance titled 1960’s Japanese Avant-garde Art and Performance Screening×Agitation is scheduled for Saturday, September 23, 2017. The performance will feature Kato Yoshihiro, the leader of Zero Jigen, and KuroDalaiJee, an expert on Japanese avant-garde art of the 1960s, from Fukuoka Asian Art Museum. On Saturday, November 4, 2017, a symposium on the exhibition Reenacting History will be held in collaboration with the Korean Society of Aesthetics and Science of Art, illuminating the social meaning of performance from an academic perspective.

Carolee Schneemann, FF Alumn, at MoMA PS1, Long Island City, NY, Oct. 22, 2017-March 11, 2018\n\nFIRST U.S. RETROSPECTIVE FOCUSED ON PIONEERING ARTIST\n\nCAROLEE SCHNEEMANN OPENS OCTOBER 22\n\nCarolee Schneemann: Kinetic Painting\n\nOctober 22, 2017-March 11, 2018\n\nMoMA PS1 will present the first comprehensive retrospective of the work of Carolee Schneemann (American, b. 1939) in the United States, bringing together over 300 works spanning her prolific six-decade career. As one of the most groundbreaking artists of the second half of the twentieth century, Schneemann’s pioneering investigations into the social construction of the female body and the sexual and cultural biases implicit in traditional art historical narratives have had an indelible impact on subsequent generations of artists. Carolee Schneemann: Kinetic Painting will be on view from October 22, 2017 to March 11, 2018. Carolee Schneemann: Kinetic Painting begins with rarely seen examples of the artist’s early paintings from the 1950s, charting their evolution into assemblages made in the 1960s-which integrated found objects, mechanical elements, and painterly interventions. As a central protagonist of the New York downtown avant-garde community, she explored hybrid mediums culminating in what she termed “kinetic theater.” She was a co-founder of the innovative Judson Dance Theater and the first visual artist to choreograph for the ensemble.\n\nDuring this period, Schneemann began to position her own body in her work with the intent of performing the roles of “both image-maker and image.” Responding to representations of sexuality made predominantly from the perspective of male artists, Schneemann’s provocative pieces foregrounded her body in ways that challenged prevailing attitudes about female sexuality. In parallel, Schneemann’s outrage over the atrocities of the Vietnam War are starkly reflected in several of her works from the mid-1960s.\n\nThe exhibition grounds Schneemann’s oeuvre within the context of her lifelong commitment to painting and action, tracing the early developments that would lead to her iconic performances and films from the 1960s and 1970s, through to her multimedia installations from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s exploring feminist iconography, intimacy, and personal loss, as well as political disasters, captivity, and the destruction of war.\n\nThe exhibition features several works of key historical significance that were recently acquired by The Museum of Modern Art, including the pivotal painting-construction Four Fur Cutting Boards (1963) and related photographic portfolio Eye Body: 36 Transformative Actions (1963), as well as the landmark installation Up to and Including Her Limits (1973-76).\n\nCarolee Schneemann: Kinetic Painting is organized by the Museum der Moderne Salzburg. The exhibition is curated by Sabine Breitwieser, Director, Museum der Moderne Salzburg; and consulting curator Branden W. Joseph, Frank Gallipoli Professor of Modern and Contemporary Art, Columbia University, New York; and organized at MoMA PS1 by Erica Papernik-Shimizu, Associate Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art, The Museum of Modern Art; with Oliver Shultz, Curatorial Assistant, MoMA PS1.\n\nCarolee Schneemann: Kinetic Painting originated at the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, Austria, from November 21, 2015 to February 28, 2016, and is currently on view at the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt am Main, Germany through September 24, 2017.\n\nThe catalog Carolee Schneemann: Kinetic Painting was published in conjunction with the exhibition in German and English editions. This major publication, the first of its kind on Carolee Schneemann’s work, is edited by Sabine Breitwieser for the Museum der Moderne Salzburg and features essays by Sabine Breitwieser, Branden W. Joseph, Mignon Nixon, Ara Osterweil, and Judith Rodenbeck, as well as selected writings by Carolee Schneemann. Separate German and English editions, hardcover, 280 x 240 mm, 320 pp., Munich: Prestel.\n\nCarolee Schneemann is a multidisciplinary artist who has worked in painting, photography, performance, film, video, mixed media, and installation. MoMA PS1 has a history of exhibiting her work: Schneemann performed Noise Bodies (1965) in 1983 as part of the exhibition PS1 Re-Opens the Sixties, and Four Fur Cutting Boards (1963) was displayed at the Museum in 1984. Schneemann has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Musée départemental d’art contemporain de Rochechouart, France (2013); the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León, Spain (2014); Dia:Beacon, New York (2011); and the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York (1997), and group exhibitions at Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Haus der Kunst, Germany; and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; among others. Schneemann’s work is included in museum collections around the world, including the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Spain; Museum of Modern Art, New York; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, California; Tate Modern, England; Centre Georges Pompidou, France; and Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C. Schneemann currently lives and works in upstate New York.\n\nMajor support is provided by Lonti Ebers.\n\nAdditional funding is provided by the MoMA PS1 Annual Exhibition Fund.\n\nPress Contact: Molly Kurzius, (718) 392-6447 or molly_kurzius@moma.org press_momaps1@moma.org\n\nFor downloadable high-resolution images, register at MoMA.org/press.

R. Sikoryak, FF Alumn, in The New York Times, Sept. 26\n\nThe complete illustrated article is at this link. Text only follows below.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/laws-picture-books-the-yale-law-library-collection-illustrating-the-letter-of-the-law-1506460653\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nEXHIBITION REVIEW\n\n‘Law’s Picture Books: The Yale Law Library Collection’: Illustrating the Letter of the Law. From a 14th-century Italian diagram of kinship relations to a contemporary rendition of iTune’s epic ‘terms and conditions,’ the odd but intriguing practice of expressing legal concepts in visual terms.\n\nby Edward Rothstein\n\nSept. 26, 2017 5:17 p.m. ET\n\nNew York\n\nPicture books about the law are as superfluous as songs about economics. In legal codices and textbooks, illustrations can even seem frivolous. Before visiting the Grolier Club’s exhibition “Law’s Picture Books: The Yale Law Library Collection,” you might also believe this is as it should be: Justice typically devalues the visual. Not for nothing is Lady Justice blindfolded-as we see in many texts displayed at this unusual exhibition. The law library’s rare book librarian, Michael Widener, has been collecting illustrated law books for the institution, and now he and his co-curator, the legal scholar Mark S. Weiner, have offered an eye-opening survey of that specialty.\n\nLaw’s Picture Books: The Yale Law Library Collection\n\nThe Grolier Club\n\nThrough Nov. 18\n\nThe idea goes so strongly against the grain that it takes a while to see how distorted the grain has become. Yes, of course Justice is blind. And this is a virtue, since issues of appearance should be less important in rendering justice than matters of essence. Ideally, all surface phenomena-personality, taste (and given contemporary preoccupations, race and gender)-should be treated as distractions. What is important is the rational application of legal principles. This may even be one of the subliminal reasons many courtrooms don’t allow image-making beyond the abilities of a sketch artist. Pictures, after all, portray surface, and thus may lie.\n\nThe illustrations here, though, are illuminating, suggestive, even essential. They range from a 14th-century Italian diagram of kinship relations to help determine when ecclesiastical law allows marriage, to a contemporary rendition of iTune’s epic “terms and conditions” set into the mouths of comic-strip characters who vaguely resemble Steve Jobs [by R. Sikoryak]. These are not marginalia: They comment on the legal text, clarify it or undercut it. Such images have been created for legal professionals and for children, for lay readers and for courtroom display. As frontispieces, they proclaim the ideal of justice-in one 1609 Venetian example Lady Justice also becomes a representation of Venice, which considered itself an incarnation of her spirit. There are also images of crime rendered with suggestive clarity: A 16th-century Flemish volume by Joost de Damhoudere -“among the most richly illustrated books in the history of legal literature”-shows one image of citizens scurrying in the street as offal is poured from a chamber pot above their heads and another of men surreptitiously moving boundary markers.\n\nIllustrations can also be invaluable. A 1580 Italian volume of “an influential treatise on alluvium and riparian rights by Battista Aimo” was apparently responsible for inspiring Mr. Widener to begin this Yale collection. We see images of water and altered land formations: As the water flows it deposits alluvium. What happens, then, to property rights? A late 18th-century Italian image measures five feet long when unfolded. It shows the river Po, “notorious for its floods-and for the legal problems those floods create.” The river is dotted with references to legal cases. The Netherlands, as might be imagined, was figuratively flooded by studies of water law involving calculations of property lines in a continuously shifting landscape.\n\nWe see here, too, a 1580 edition of the “Bambergensis,” the first systematic codification of a branch of law created for the Diocese of Bamberg, which became “the model for the criminal code of the Holy Roman Empire.” The page to which it is open demonstrates tools and torture used in the punishment of capital crimes. It is unlikely the laws would have the same impact were these retributions not so picturesquely portrayed. A 1775 book, “On the Abolition of Torture”-we see its opening illustration-led to the abandonment of torture in Austria. Was this why, in 1801, Beethoven, as his musical style celebrated the powers of Enlightenment Reason, ended up dedicating his Opus 28 piano sonata to the book’s author, Joseph von Sonnenfels ?\n\nAlong the way, too, we are teased by notorious cases in which illustrations depicted evidence. One image shows the knife wielded by a California Supreme Court justice, David S. Terry, during a fracas in federal court in which he was a witness supporting the claims of a San Francisco socialite; he was jailed for contempt by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field. After Terry’s release, he apparently threateningly approached Field, who, the exhibition tells us, shot and killed him. (Terry had earlier, in 1859, killed a U.S. senator in a duel; Field typically carried two pistols.) Illustration might also suggest a crime’s sole remnants, as in the 1850 portrayal of a fractured skeleton. A Harvard Medical College professor had brutally murdered a Boston businessman and hidden his remains in a privy.\n\nIn the helpful catalog, Mr. Weiner notes that some contemporary scholars, using material in Yale’s collection, are beginning to study imagery’s function in the evolution of legal systems. One suggestion is that the contemporary decline in illustration reflects not greater clarity but a greater “degree of blindness” to human and cultural implications of the law. And who has not read the text of one law or another and not wished that its author had learned to diagram sentences if not the law’s consequences? On the other hand, the exhibition includes a satirically illustrated tax code from 1944 occupied France; what Laocoön-like images might arise if something similar were attempted with the current U.S. tax code? We might be grateful we are spared such a rendition and left solely with that ever-expanding text.\n\n-Mr. Rothstein is the Journal’s Critic at Large.\n\nAppeared in the September 27, 2017, print edition as ‘Illustrating the Letter of the Law.’\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n11. Linda Sibio, FF Alumn, fall newsletter\n\nDear Friends & Colleagues:\n\nWelcome to the fifth edition of the SIBIO bi-monthly newsletter about my online shop (www.crazyforaday.com) and adventures in that big thing in the conceptual sky called Art (www.lindasibio.com).\n\nCurrently, I am doing my Insanity Principle workshops again! These workshops were originally started in Los Angeles at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. They contain exercises that I invented for artmaking which bring forth a new and interesting guide to creating. These two-hour workshops will focus on performance, writing, and contemporary art through a series of techniques including fragmentation, interrupters, psychological opposites, and the psychological model as a method of acting.\n\nThe new series, presented by High Desert Test Sites, starts on Saturday, October 14th from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm and will run every second Saturday of each month at the Copper Mountain Mesa Community Center in Joshua Tree. A $30 minimum donation is requested (all proceeds go to the artist). For questions and to reserve a spot, please email info@highdeserttestsites.com.\n\nCheck out High Desert Test Site’s Instagram page for more photos of Linda’s performances and past workshops.\n\nI am also doing my second pop-up shop, this time at the Ace Hotel Clubhouse in Palm Springs on October 8th, starting at 11:00 am. For those who have looked at my site (www.crazyforaday.com), you will notice that I have lowered my prices with tees at $39.95 and hand painted vintage shirts now $49.95 (down from $60). At the upcoming Ace Pop-Up Fair, the shirts will go down to $29.95 and $39.95. I will be there in a special outfit as your host. The fair is free and open to all.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n12.

Edward Gomez, Ray Johnson, John Cage, Andy Warhol, FF Alumns, now online at hyperallergic.com\n\nOsaka, Japan\n\nLate Saturday night, Sept 30, 2017\n\nDear friends and media colleagues:\n\nI just arrived in Japan. Back in the USA, my article about the American artist Ray Johnson, who died in 1995 and whose collage works are now on view in a superb group exhibition at David Zwirner’s new gallery on Manhattan’s Upper East Side (at 34 East 69th Street), has just been published in the “Weekend” edition of the arts-and-culture magazine HYPERALLERGIC.\n\nZwirner is presenting a selection of Johnson’s works in cooperation with Adler Beatty, the new art-advisory firm in New York founded by Frances Beatty and her son, Alexander Adler. Beatty has long overseen Johnson’s estate and previously worked at Richard L. Feigen & Co., where one of her focuses was on Johnson’s work.\n\nThis article looks at the considerable momentum that has developed around Johnson’s artistic legacy, as interest in and research activity regarding his art have notably increased, as have exhibitions and publishing projects examining his diverse accomplishments and his influence on other artists.\n\nYou can find my HYPERALLERGIC article here:\n\nhttps://hyperallergic.com/402586/ray-johnson-david-zwirner-josef-and-anni-and-ruth-and-ray-2017/\n\nI send you all best wishes!\n\nEDWARD M.
