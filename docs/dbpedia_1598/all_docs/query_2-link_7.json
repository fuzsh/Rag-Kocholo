        "text": "Having been mistakenly perceived as a mere follower of Salvador Dali, Catalan Surrealist painter and poet Angel Planells (1901-1989) has passed through the history of art practically unnoticed. Yet his work suggests an influence on a number of works by Dali, proving that a fairer way to define their relationship is that of an artistic associateship. His participation in the ground breaking International Exhibition of Surrealism in London in 1936 is in itself a marker of his quality as an artist, but Planells' contribution to Surrealism in Spain is remarkable for his use of astronomy, fantastic landscapes reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe's narrative as well as for the modulation of light in his oils. In this book, Anna Vives reconfigures the canon of Hispanic Surrealism by bringing Planells center stage."
