        "text": "Weird Art Month: David Normal\n\nPublished on :\n\nBy Sam Reeve I was going to open this with a real groaner of a joke about David’s last name, but I stopped myself. You’re welcome. David Normal started his art career at the age of 16 making punk flyers in SanFrancisco. He later got involved with theatre, photography, animation, […]\n\nWeird Art Month: Shih Yung Lin\n\nPublished on :\n\nBy Sam Reeve Banana people. Banana people? Banana people! Shih Yung Lin is a mystery to me because most of the info on him is in Chinese. What you need to know is Lin’s art is amazing and weird and beautiful beyond measure. Visit his Flickr page here to see […]\n\nWeird Art Month: Laurie Lipton\n\nPublished on :\n\nBy Sam Reeve Skeletons and skulls frequently appear in New York-born Laurie Lipton’s work, as does strange machinery and too many circuit boards. Her finely detailed charcoal and pencil drawings have made their rounds in Internetland, so you’ve probably seen her work at some point. They’re strange and beautiful and […]\n\nWeird Art Month: Cahill Wessel\n\nPublished on :\n\nBy Sam Reeve San Francisco Bay artist Cahill Wessel plays around with pop culture in surreal and hilarious ways, giving you everything you’d ever hoped to see. Hover over the pictures (or click through the gallery) to view the titles of each piece – they’re almost as golden as the […]\n\nWeird Art Month: Jessica Joslin\n\nPublished on :\n\nBy Sam Reeve When I stumbled upon Jessica Joslin’s work I was not only stunned by its beauty and detail, but by the sheer amount of it. She’s already got over 200 of these sculptures to her name, and her menagerie of brass and bone only keeps growing. She gives […]\n\nWeird Art Month – SCARECROWOVEN\n\nPublished on :\n\nBy Sam Reeve Mysterious New York-based illustrator SCARECROWOVEN is a fan of gore, guts, and oozing appendages. His gnarled creatures take a cue from ‘comic books, sci-fi and horror movies and all the illustration that came out of the skateboard world in the 80’s.’ He describes himself as an alien […]\n\nWeird Art Month: Agostino Arrivabene\n\nPublished on :\n\nby Sam Reeve Agostino Arrivabene’s paintings look like relics from some kind of nuclear wasteland, warped by time and radiation, but really the dude’s just talented as hell and often paints on wood instead of canvas. He lives near Milan, Italy, and lives like a hermit with just his dog […]\n\nWeird Art Month: Jim Tozzi\n\nPublished on :\n\nby Sam Reeve Jim Tozzi of the band/art collective PFFR totally rules! You may not be familiar with his art, but maybe you’ve seen the ultra bizarro animated show Xavier: Renegade Angel? If you haven’t, check out the episode below. It’s quite a trip. PFFR created the show, whose main […]\n\nWeird Art Month: Gwen Tomahawk\n\nPublished on :\n\nby Sam Reeve Gwen Tomahawk is a badass French artist from Paris. I can’t for the life of me find much information about her on the web, but no matter. Check out her StoreEnvy and you can see her full portfolio.\n\nWeird Art Month: Angel Planells\n\nPublished on :\n\nby Sam Reeve Today I bring you the old-school bizarro art of Angel Planells (1901-1989), a Spanish surrealist who hung out with the likes of Salvador Dali and René Magritte. He was a shy, introverted man and was driven by his dreams to create the surreal paintings you see below.\n\nDilation Exercise 92\n\nPublished on :\n\nBelow you’ll find Alan M. Clark’s weekly Dilation Exercise. Please look at the picture, read the caption, above and below the image, and allow your imagination to go to work on it. If the artwork inspires an idea, please use the comment feature to tell us something about it. Need […]\n\nWeird Art Month: Wayne Barlowe\n\nPublished on :\n\nby Sam Reeve I’ve been a fan of Wayne Barlowe’s since I was a little kid. Besides painting and sketching some of the craziest creatures and beings you’ll ever see, he did some paleoart for a book I had called Alphabet of Dinosaurs. The picture below is the one I […]"
