        "meta_description": "Mongibello pays homage, throughout its 32 suites, to 32 personalities linked to the island of Ibiza. To provide this feat with a suitable character and soul, we have got together with one of our favourite local artists and usual Concept suspect for an invaluable collaboration: the Ibizan graphic artist Marcos Torres. The elegance and timelessness of these illustrations are based on the formula of the classic, stately and almost aristocratic portrait",

        "text": "“The challenge has been to ensure that the DNA of the honorees shines through in the artwork: humanity, humour, mischievousness or a personal nod and wink that makes it clear that the person portrayed has known how to live the Dolce Vita,” said Marcos Torres when asked about the most complicated part of this particular project.\n\nThe 32 personalities honoured in the hotel each have a suite named after them, and each suite has an illustration created by Torres that presides over the room. Each portrait is essential to the suite’s personalisation and required exceptional know-how to complete. Taking inspiration from one or several original photographs of each honoree, the graphic artist has managed to capture the essence of each of these characters. The actress Ángela Molina, Grand Prix motorcycle champion Ángel Nieto, Ricardo Urgell, the founder of Pachá, the painter Antonio Villanueva, Elena Ruiz, the director of MACE (Contemporary Art Museum of Ibiza), the treasure merchant Vicente Ganesha, the craftsman Pedro Planells and the fashion designer Charo Ruiz are just some of the people portrayed on Mongibello’s walls.\n\nThese personalities form part of the island’s identity and have contributed to forging the legend of Ibiza’s essence in the 60s and 70s, the decades in which Ibiza became an eternal icon of freedom, turquoise water and dancing until dawn.\n\nIf there is anyone who perfectly captures this essence, it is Massimo Luccarini, the owner of the Italian restaurant Las Dos Lunas. Born in Rome but hailing from a Tuscan family, Massimo is the closest thing to an Etruscan wizard, a man who knows how to navigate life’s storms and adapt to whatever comes his way. He never thought of opening a restaurant, but after his first two years in 70s Ibiza, the late Carlos Ereñu – grandson of an Austrian archduchess and the Marquis of Orlandis – came into his life. They embarked on an adventure to convert an old antique shop into what is now the iconic Italian restaurant Las Dos Lunas. Ereñu convinced Lucarini by telling him: “Don’t worry, you bring me the clients, and I’ll take care of them”, to which Massimo replied: “In five years, we’ll have the King of Spain dining here.” True to their words, the two joined forces to make the restaurant the place to be, and Spain’s former king, Juan Carlos, soon paid a visit. Las Dos Lunas is a charming and hedonistic restaurant with a familiar atmosphere thanks to the warmth of Massimo and his wife, Almudena Robles, and their daughters, Luna and Giada.\n\nAnother flagbearer from these legendary decades is the photographer Toni Riera. This versatile artist became enamoured with the island the first time he visited, and the love affair continues. Riera has worked in advertising and fashion worldwide, but Ibiza is where the artist’s work merges with his personality, where art coexists with nightlife in its most natural and free habitat. The so-called ‘Pachágrafo (Pachagrafer)’ – the nickname that gave its name to an exhibition showcasing his works over many years for Pacha Ibiza – was the creator of the iconic and world-famous promotional poster for the Ibiza club shot on the balconies of the famous establishment, Hotel Montesol. Riera has captured the island’s essence for more than 40 years in a multitude of exhibitions and books that reflect a composition and post-production that is unmistakably his.\n\nAnother who remembers this time fondly is fashion designer Charo Ruiz, who got into the profession almost unwittingly when, as a child, her grandmother Rosario took her to her sewing workshop to teach her the trade. This experience profoundly influenced the Sevillian designer, whose creations are in demand by Michelle Obama, Letizia Ortiz and Princess Olympia of Greece.\n\nCharo Ruiz took her first steps in the fashion world as a catwalk model before working and learning from the best tailors: Manuel Pertegaz, Elio Berhanyer and Paco Rabanne. She is an undisputed standard-bearer of Adlib fashion – the style of dress that mixes the fabric and shapes of traditional Ibizan costumes with the hippie aesthetic that took the island by storm in the 1960s. Charo is the primary person responsible for bringing this style to worldwide attention with her designs and maintains her office and flagship shop in the Port of Ibiza. She has been enchanted with the island since she arrived in the late 70s. The designer is celebrating 34 years at the helm of a brand that has become part of Ibiza’s heritage. This firm maintains the essence of our culture and folklore.\n\nOur honorees make up Mongibello’s soul, the island’s history as told by those who lived through the golden decades of an island that is always nostalgic."
