        "text": "Ibiza's growth as an art centre continues apace with the launch of the Lio Malco awards to promote local artists in Ibiza and Formentera. The Pacha Hotel is displaying the 10 shortlisted artworks from competing artists in a free exhibition until 14 October to support the award.\n\nThe awards have been established to create better connections with Ibiza and Formentera's artistic communities and the growing international art scene on Ibiza. The award patron, the gallerist Lio Malco created the contemporary art space, La Nave in an old salt warehouse overlooking the Mediterranean Sea near to San Miguel. Malca's vision for the gallery is very much rooted in his love for Ibiza not only celebrating local artists but also the island itself.\n\nThe exhibition includes a total of 10 artworks, one from each artist, featuring diverse mediums from sculpture to photography, painting and installation. The award will be decided from the final shortlist on 14 October, when the exhibition ends with the winner getting a trip to New York. All artists over 21 on both islands were invited to take part in the awards, with participating artists being asked to contemplate the concept ‘Clean Slate'. This was inspired by the sculpture by Brooklyn-based artist and designer KAWS which was show in La Nave's inaugural exhibition in summer last year.\n\nLio Malca, who has a house in Ibiza is very committed to the island. Speaking in an interview last year he said: “I feel that the island vibrates beautifully and it was ready to have some more art and culture. And this is what I know the most so this is my way of giving back to the island.”\n\nArtists participating include Juan Carlos Merino Zuazo, Toni Planells Riera, Enrique Campayo, Maria Teresa Martinez Herrán, Lila Lichiardi Fevre, Luis Miguel Romero Jiménez, Gabriel Torres Chalk, Joaquín Mateo Calderón, Catalina Torres Andiñach and Miguel Angel García López.\n\nAbout the award, he adds: “We are very honoured to be part of Ibiza and Formentera's cultural movement and to promote artistic development on the islands, a living space for creation, dialogue and exchange with the international art community.”\n\nIbiza's growing cultural presence continues to grow so go and support it by checking out the exhibition while you can."
