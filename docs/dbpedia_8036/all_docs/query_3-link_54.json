        "text": "Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson hit up The Tonight Show Friday ahead of next week’s release of Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and the OG ghost-busting duo brought along Ray Parker Jr. to perform the original film’s classic theme on classroom instruments alongside Jimmy Fallon and the Roots.\n\nParker Jr. handled lead vocals and triangle while Murray spent the entire song playing the kazoo, only ditching the instrument when the entire assortment of musicians gleefully sang in unison the infamous “Ghostbusters” lyric, “Bustin’ makes me feel good.”\n\nThe classroom instrument performance wasn’t the only surprise Murray had in store for the Tonight Show as he also crashed Fallon’s monologue, interrupting the political jokes to shamelessly promote Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. After prematurely extracting Hudson from his dressing room, the duo sat down on Fallon’s couches and immediately went down memory lane, talking about the original 1984 film and shooting the “Ghostbusters” music video in Times Square:\n\nTrending\n\nLater in the interview, basketball fan Murray talked about the upcoming March Madness and shooting Space Jam with Michael Jordan, while Hudson revealed Leonardo DiCaprio beat him in one-on-one on the set of The Basketball Diaries. Talk then circled back to Frozen Empire, with the Ghostbusters actors teaching Fallon how to use a Proton Pack:\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire, the sequel to 2021’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife, arrives in theaters March 22. In addition to Murray and Hudson, the new film also sees the returns of Dan Aykroyd’s Ray Stantz, Annie Potts’ Janine Melnitz, and Walter Peck’s villainous politician Walter Peck."
