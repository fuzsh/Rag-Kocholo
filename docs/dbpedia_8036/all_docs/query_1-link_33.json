        "text": "Ghostbusters, sometimes referred to as the \"Ghostbusters theme song\", is a song written and performed by Ray Parker, Jr.. It has been used in just about every incarnation of the Ghostbusters franchise, from the first movie and onward.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAfter test screenings in early 1984, Ivan Reitman wanted a song about 20 seconds in length at the beginning of the movie when Peter and Ray enter the New York City Public Library.[1] Reitman simply wanted a song that said \"Ghostbusters\" in it. Columbia Pictures spent a lot of money to have different musicians, including Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac and Kenny Loggins, write songs to be considered as the main song for the Ghostbusters movie, but could not find one that they liked. Reitman didn't like any songs he got back either.[2][3] Peter Aykroyd, Dan Aykroyd's younger brother, connected Ivan Reitman with Glenn Hughes and Pat Thrall. Bill Murray didn't like their attempt. Murray wanted NRBQ. Hughes and Thrall tried again.[4][5] None the demos submitted in 1983 from Pat Thrall and Glen Hughes were used for the movie.[6] They did use the Pat Thrall and Glenn Hughes song for the film's ShoWest exhibitor reel.[7][8] R&B artist Ray Parker, Jr. happened to be dating a woman who was working for Gary LeMel, an old music industry friend. Parker knew LeMel because he used to play guitar on Barry White's records. Gary LeMel, had suggested that he try his hand at writing a song for the film. It was described as a Ghostbusters theme song opening number for a 20 second segment at the end of the first library scene.[9][10] In place of a music supervisor on the movie, the head of the music department at Columbia Pictures introduced Ray Parker Jr. to Reitman and co-producer Joe Medjuck. Producer Clive Davis who ran Arista at the time didn't want Parker singing a song about ghosts. Parker's forte was songs about romancing women. Davis took a lot of convincing.\n\nThe catch was that the song was needed in two to three days since the film due to be released soon.[11][12] The movie producers wanted a song people could sing along with - without \"too much meaning\". The hardest task for Parker was coming up with a rhyme for \"Ghostbusters\".[13] He was half-asleep one night and saw an exterminator commercial on TV. He realized he could frame the song as a commercial and have the chorus scream \"Ghostbusters\" instead of having to do something conventional like rhyming it.[14][15] The next day, he finished recording and submitted a cassette tape with just under one and half minutes of the song to Reitman. A short time later, Reitman called Parker at 3:30 or 4:30 in the morning praising the song. Reitman pushed for the 20 second intro song to be made into a single backed by a music video.\n\nOfficial Recordings[]\n\nThese are official recordings of the song by Ray Parker Jr. that have been released to the public by Arista and Sony. Runtimes listed are the official runtimes as listed on the record singles, images of most can be found in the Gallery section below. Some sources list a runtime that is a second or two different, so runtimes are listed as a guide and not meant to be 100% exact.\n\nIt should also be noted that a few of the 7\"/45-rpm records list a 3:45 \"regular\" version and a 4:07 \"Instrumental\" version, but that may be an error. No other versions of the \"regular\" and \"instrumental\" versions are so short. Maybe the two songs were sped-up for jukebox play. Until it can be proved if that's the case, or not, they are not being listed below but will be noted in this paragraph.\n\nAlbum Version/7\" Version/Short Version (4:04) - available on the Soundtrack album and just about every released single.\n\nInstrumental Version (4:48) - available on the Soundtrack album and the 30th anniversary record single.\n\nExtended Version/12\" Single Remix (6:08) - available on several record singles, Ray Parker Jr.'s \"Chartbusters\" album, and the 2006 reissue of the soundtrack album.\n\nSearchin' For The Spirit Remix (5:19) - available on the Searchin' For The Spirit/Dub Instrumental Version record single. [16]\n\nDub Version (5:35) - available on the 30th Anniversary record single.\n\nDub Instrumental Version (5:30) - available on the Searchin' For The Spirit/Dub Instrumental Version record single.[17]\n\n2009 Re-Recording (3:42) - available on the Atari Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime website for a limited time in 2011.[18] Do note that the original Atari MP3 has ID3 data that gives a \"2007\" date, which either means that this version was recorded two years before it debuted to the public, or the 2007 date could simply be a mistake.[19])\n\nOfficial Releases[]\n\nName of Release Record Label Catalog # Song versions of Note Year Ghoshbusters 7\" Record Single (Flashback) Ghostbusters Extended Version Record Single Ghoshbusters Picture Disc Record Single (Round, Glow in the Dark) Ghoshbusters Picture Disc Record Single (Shaped) Ghoshbusters Searchin' For The Spirit UK Record Single Ghoshbusters Japanese 2-Track Record Single Ghoshbusters German 7\" Record Single Ghoshbusters German 12\" Maxi-Single Record Single Ghoshbusters Girls Are More Fun Record Single Extreme Ghostbusters-branded UK Promotional CD Single BMG BMGSM19 Ghostbusters (Original Ghostbusters Theme Tune) (4:07?) 1998 Ghoshbusters 30th Anniversary Record Single (Glow in the Dark) Ghostbusters Marshmallow Colored Vinyl Wal-Mart Exclusive Sony Legacy April 30, 2020\n\nMusic Video[]\n\nThe Times Square scene for the music video was shot in the last week of May 1984.[20] Like many movie soundtrack videos, it uses both a recreation of the concept of the movie and actual clips from the movie. However, its an interesting music video as many actors (many of which didn't appear in the Ghostbusters film) show up singing the song in little bit cameos. The lead is singer Ray Parker Jr. and lead actress is Cindy Harrell.\n\nThe music video was recorded at A&M Studios in Hollywood without a proper director. Ivan Reitman sort of just took over directing it. The set of the haunted house was still being constructed up to when filming started. An old shooting technique of painting on glass then shooting through the house created the drawn look. After the painter started, Reitman set up the camera and the video was shot. Parker was a little concerned about looking silly as a singing ghost but Reitman ran with the concept and recruited celebrity cameos. Some cameos were favors that were called in. Teri Garr just filmed \"Tootsie\" with Bill Murray. Reitman, Medjuck and a small crew went to where \"Brewster's Millions\" was shooting, made their way past security, and had John Candy shoot his cameo between takes. While filming \"No Small Affair\" at Burbank Studios, George Wendt filmed his cameo for free during a lunch break. He later got in trouble with the Screen Actors Guild for that arrangement but was merely told not to do so again.\n\nFor the ending of the music video, the crew blocked off Times Square at the same time the press junket for the movie took place in New York. The scene was not planned and essentially shot for a day with no permit. On a Friday afternoon at 1 pm, Parker filmed with Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson in character as his backup singers. Murray did an impromptu breakdancing routine. Parker improvised and helped spin Murray around. Since the actors in the music video weren't paid for their appearance, the video could not appear in home video releases for the film.\n\nGuests[]\n\nCast from Film This doesn't include actors that appear in clips from the film.\n\nBill Murray\n\nDan Aykroyd\n\nHarold Ramis\n\nErnie Hudson\n\nCameo non-film\n\nChevy Chase\n\nMelissa Gilbert\n\nJohn Candy\n\nTeri Garr\n\nOllie E.

Ray tries to convince a woman, played by Irene Cara, that he's really Ray Parker Jr. She sarcastically rebuffs him by saying, \"Yeah, and I'm Irene Cara,\", and then walks away. At this point, Ray sees the \"Ghostbusters\" music video on a television and comments, \"Hey! That's me!\". Irene Cara also made a cameo appearance in the \"Ghostbusters\" music video.[23]\n\nThe song appears as a playable song in Just Dance 2014.\n\nGhostbusters (1984) Trivia[]\n\nA snippet of the song plays in Ghostbusters in Chapter 01: Start when the logo and title appear, in the montage in Chapter 14: Welcome Aboard, and after Winston Zeddemore declared, \"I love this town!\" in Chapter 28: Crossing Streams.\n\nAccording to Ivan Reitman, there was plans to do a second commercial as an elaborate MTV music video with the Ghostbusters singing the \"Ghostbusters\" song (that could actually be played on MTV) but the song wasn't just right until too late in post-production.[24]\n\nGhostbusters II Trivia[]\n\nA snippet of the song plays in Ghostbusters II in Chapter 01: Start after Dana Barrett retrieves Oscar from the baby carriage then in the next scene, Ray and Winston dance to and sing the \"Ghostbusters\" song as a cassette recording plays. They only sing the lyrics \"If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who ya gonna call?!\" and \"And it don't look good.\"\n\nA snippet of \"Ghostbusters!\" from the song plays in Ghostbusters II in Chapter 28: World is Safe Again when the new painting is revealed.\n\nGhostbusters: Afterlife Trivia[]\n\nA snippet of \"Ghostbusters\" plays at the end of Ghostbusters: Afterlife in Chapter 16 prior to the end credits at the 1:52:38 mark.\n\nAt one point in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, there was going to be a 1960s cover of the Ghostbusters song that was done for the movie by the Menahan Street Band. The children find a 45 single that turns out to be a 1960s song that Ray Parker, Jr. does a cover of that became known as the \"Ghostbusters\" song.[25]\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire Trivia[]\n\nA scene from the music video of the \"Ghostbusters\" song when Ray Parker, Jr. and the Ghostbusters dance in Times Square is played during the NY1 News report in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.\n\nGary Grooberson quotes lines from the Ghostbusters song while he convinces Callie Spengler to stay and fight.\n\nThe Ghostbusters song plays after Winston declares, \"We are the Ghostbusters!\"\n\nThe Real Ghostbusters Trivia[]\n\nThe famous \"shuffle\" performed by the guys at the end of the music video was referenced in the end credits of \"The Real Ghostbusters\"\n\nExtreme Ghostbusters Trivia[]\n\nThere was a delay in getting Ray Parker, Jr.'s approval to use the \"Ghostbusters\" song on Extreme Ghostbusters.
