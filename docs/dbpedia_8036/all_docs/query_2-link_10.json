        "text": "Amazon has 'Two Places in the Same Time' and 'Woman Needs Love' listed as import releases. Both look to be from BMG international.\n\nUnderrated group, they put out some good singles like \"Jack & Jill\" \"You Can't Change That\" and later on \"A Woman Needs Love (Just Like You Do)\" and \"The Other Woman\" (which may have been Parker Jr. solo) So many seem to only remember Parker Jr. for the 'Ghostbusters' theme song. (as well as the controversey that ensued from that song)\n\nYeah, that's what I somewhat recall. This was in 1977, or 78 when he got a record deal, and funk bands like Brick, Bar-Kays, Con Funk Shun, and Rick James' Stone City Band were all the rage.\n\nRay Parker Jr. is a studio rat, and built his own studio in the 70s while he was a session musician for people like Stevie Wonder and others. He played most or all of the instruments on all of the records, and sometimes had people like Arnell Carmichael help out. He engineered his own records too.\n\nI looked up some info on him this morning and it does seems like he played on a number of different albums in the 70's and into the early 80's. I knew he had played guitar on 'I Want You' but I didn't know he had played on 'Talking Book.' He was only around 18 at the time that was recorded so that would seem to indicate his talent got reognized early on. He also played on a couple of Boz Scaggs's releases as well among many others.\n\nI'm a little too young to remember first hand so I'll ask, did the controversey over 'Ghostbusters' being plagerized really hurt him career-wise? It looks like he pretty much disappeared within 2 or 3 years of that song being released.\n\nIt was Huey Lewis's 'I Want a New Drug' although I read somewhere that some thought Robin Scott, who recorded as M and had the huge hit 'Pop Muzik', should've been sueing both Lewis and Parker Jr. since 'Pop Muzik' came first and the two later songs sound similar.\n\nYou're probably right though, it was the change in the industry as well as Parker, Jr. becoming 'that guy who sang 'Ghostbusters' that did him in.\n\nDepends on the region of the US, too: he got more play on Top 40 radio in Detroit, so a lot of listeners still remember him here quite well. Part of the increased interest in R&B in Detroit may be due to Motown originally being from here...but who knows?\n\nCould also have something to do with Ray Parker, Jr. originally being from there as well...but again, who knows?\n\nMaybe not in smaller radio markets(which tend only play the really big hits), but San Francisco was definitely a strong area of support. KFRC which at the time was the big pop station in this part of the world, frequently played Ray Parker, Jr. singles like \"Let Me Go\", \"Bad Boy\", and \"For Those About To Groove\". Those records nationally either just barely scraped the top 40 on the Hot 100 or didn't chart at all.\n\nI always loved Ray Parker's approach to writing lyrics. He doesn't do those \"I love you, you're my world, I can't live without you\" cryin' songs. He does straight-up words from a regular guy that is sometimes in your face and honest.\n\nOne of his most brilliant songs is \"A Woman Needs Love\". If you aren't paying close attention, it sounds like just another love song, as the music is bedroom music, and he sings the song soft and seductively...but the lyrics are aimed straight at us GUYS, with a word of warning about cheating on your woman! Hah! I love stuff like this!"
