        "text": "Hello! You join us at TOTP Rewind at a critical stage for there is an act in serious need of a career resuscitating hit and that act is The Style Council. Paul Weller’s vehicle since disbanding The Jam had done him good service but four and a half years on since its inception the wheels were starting to come off. Despite a recent-ish Top 10 hit in “It Didn’t Matter”, things were not right in camp Weller. Recent album “The Cost Of Loving” had not been well received critically and time has not been kind to it either. Indeed, In 1991, the NME included the album in a list of fourteen albums that “should’ve been an EP”. Ouch!\n\n“Wanted” however, was not on said album but was a stand alone single and its catchy melody reeks of a label insisting on a hit after hitting choppy career waters. It kind of worked with it securing a No 20 placing which was a definite improvement on previous effort “Waiting” which was the first Style Council single not to make the Top 40. However it was just a temporary reprieve with subsequent single releases not being able to surpass that chart position. The following year they released the “Confessions of a Pop Group” album and the game was really up at that point. The general consensus in the music press was that the band had disappeared up their own arses and their final album for label Polydor “Modernism: A New Decade” wasn’t even released.\n\nAnd what did my Weller obsessive elder brother think about it all? I’m not sure. To this day he remains a Weller disciple but I’m guessing he rarely plays his hero’s musical output from this particular era.\n\nGeorge Michael is now up to No 2 with “Faith”. Watching the video back in full I’d forgotten that its not entirely shot in black and white save for the washed out blue hue of George’s jeans. There’s actually a lot of full colour shots as well. It must be that trick that our memories pull on us all where they shift and re-edit what we’ve seen to form the recollection.\n\nIf you’re wondering why we’re not seeing George in the TOTP studio performing this song, here’s @TOTPFacts with the answer…\n\n“Faith” would be unable to shift the Bee Gees from the top spot and plateaued at No 2.\n\nIt’s the new pop sensation next. Rick Astley was everywhere by this point. The pop magazines couldn’t get enough of him and his “I’m just a bloke from up north and a bit boring really” persona. As well as being all over the press, he was starting to dominate the charts as well. His No 1 single “Never Gonna Give You Up” had yet to vacate the Top 40 before his second single release “Whenever You Need Somebody” gatecrashed it.\n\nNot originally intended to be the follow up single, it was bumped up the release schedule after the decision was taken by Stock, Aitken and Waterman to delay the release of “Together Forever” (which they viewed as the strongest track off the album after “Never Gonna Give You Up”) in case a ‘big’ song was needed to prolong the album’s sales life. In fairness, he could have released a fart at this point and it would have been a hit and many people would say he did just that with “Whenever You Need Somebody”. It had those jumpy rhythms in the verses and the chorus sounded a bit desperate. It all added up to sounding like a pale imitation of its predecessor to me. It did the trick for his legion of fans though who lapped it up and sent it to a peak of No 3 in the charts.\n\nPresenter Steve Wright is having one of his more coherent shows tonight (mostly he spent the decade on TOTP looking and sounding pissed) and he even attempts to display his musical knowledge (!) in the introduction to the next act…\n\n“From the man who bought you “Ghostbusters” and “You Can’t Change That” and other hits, “I Don’t think That Man Should Sleep Alone” in the studio Ray Parker Jr…”.\n\nOther hits? What other hits? And what’s this song “You Can’t Change That” he mentions?\n\n*checks Wikipedia for Ray Parker Jr discography*\n\nOK, well before this toilet stain of a song, the only singles he released in the UK were “Ghostbusters” and something called “Girls Are More Fun” which failed to chart so no other hits in this country at all Steve. And “You Can’t Change That”? Turns out that it was a song by his former funk group Raydio (awful, awful name) and although it was a Top 10 hit in the US , it did zip over here. Want to listen to it? Nah, nor me.\n\n“I Don’t think That Man Should Sleep Alone” peaked at no 13.\n\nSome Breakers next and first up is one of the most bonkers songs of the 80s. Bonkers in a good way though. “Beethoven ( I Love To Listen To)” was the lead single from Eurythmics “Savage” album and as one person tweeted the other day, it was more a work of art than a pop song. After the stadium rock excess of previous album “Revenge” had taken them around the world and been a global success, Dave and Annie wanted to go back to their roots on the next project. In his autobiography Sweet Dreams, Stewart says:\n\n“We were trying to reel it back in. because ‘Revenge’ had become so immense, and we were starting to feel too much like a rock-and-roll band.\n\nFor ‘Savage’ we decided to make something very odd and very experimental, to get back to electronic strangeness. We wanted to put out something surreal and nonsensical , something that would shatter people’s perceptions of who we were and what we had become, and it certainly did the trick. In a way it was like committing commercial suicide.”\n\n“Beethoven ( I Love To Listen To)” was certainly full of ‘electronic strangeness’! I found it utterly bewildering the first time I heard it. What the Hell was that? It was full of odd sounds – haywire drum loops, synth stabs and vocal overdubs which were all wrapped around an unconventional song structure. It didn’t even have a proper chorus!\n\nDave Stewart again:\n\n“Then the only melody is on the line “I Love to listen to Beethoven”. I’m sure the record company was thinking “How do we get this on the radio?”. Annie and I never thought “Beethoven” would be a hit. That was the whole idea.”\n\nThen there were the lyrics that Annie delivers as spoken word. For example:\n\n“You think you know just what you want but you have used that weapon against me.\n\nDid I tell you I was lying by the way when I said I wanted a new mink coat?\n\nI was thinking of something sleek to wrap around my tender throat”.\n\nQuite chilling and certainly out there. If all of that wasn’t enough, take a look at the video! Annie ‘s depiction of a disturbed, obsessive – compulsive housewife is riveting and distinctly uncomfortable viewing. The transformation into the vamp character at the song’s end is truly troubling.\n\nAnd yet it works somehow. I guess it’s testament to their creative powers that Dave and Annie could make a hit out of something so other worldly. The “Savage” album is widely considered as their best ever amongst their fan base – I certainly know one person who concurs with this view. A comparable scenario would be “The Holy Bible” by Manic Street Preachers. Probably their darkest ever album and yet it consistently tops fan polls as their best ever work.\n\nDespite Dave Stewart’s claim that they never believed it would be a hit, “Beethoven ( I Love To Listen To)” made No 25 on the UK charts.\n\nA proper music legend up next. George Harrison had not been seen in the UK Top 40 since 1981’s “All Those Years Ago” so his successful return with “Got My Mind Set On You” was slightly unexpected. Now I never knew that this song wasn’t a Harrison original until I looked it up, having initially been a hit for someone called James Ray in the early 60s. I also found out that it was the last No 1 single in the US for any of The Beatles which seems extraordinary but it’s on Wikipedia so it must be true (ahem).\n\nI quite liked this at the time and my housemate Roy went as far as buying the album “Cloud Nine”. I’m not sure it’s aged that well though. Maybe I’ve just heard it too may times now.\n\nThe video features a George double performing a back flip and dance routine amongst all the flying inanimate objects. I wonder if it was the inspiration for Fatboy Slim’s “Weapon Of Choice” video featuring some mind bending dancing from Christopher Walken (supposedly).\n\n“Got My Mind Set On You” peaked at No 2 in the UK and was kept off the top spot by the very next Breaker…\n\n…T’Pau managed to pull off that very difficult trick of following up their debut smash hit with an even bigger single success. “China In Your Hand” was not only a No 1 but it was actually the 600th single to top the UK charts. The first time I ever heard this song it was a live version. T’Pau were supporting Bryan Adams on his “Into The Fire” tour which I caught in Newcastle (and yes I know how uncool this makes me sound!). I only knew their song “Heart And Soul” at this point but they played “China In Your Hand” in their set and I did immediately think that would be a massive hit if they released it. Honest I did! Maybe I could have had a career in A&R after all!\n\nI saw Carol live again in 2001 on one of those 80s nostalgia tours. She was bottom of the bill – deemed not a bigger audience pull than even Go West or bendy Ben from Curiosity Killed The Cat. I’m guessing she must have sung “China In Your Hand” again that night but it didn’t have the same effect on me this time.\n\nThis is a great one hit wonder! Or are they actually a one hit wonder? As Gary Davies states in his intro, they’d been at the TOTP studio before performing a hit record….\n\nScarlet Fantastic emerged from the ashes of Swansway who had graced the charts with the eerie “Soul Train” back in 1984. “No Memory” was absolutely nothing like “Soul Train” though. It was just the sort of stuff I liked back then – a pop tune with a bit of an edge. Maggie De Monde’s exotic sounding vocals added that extra bit of mystery to make it stand out of the crowd whilst Rick P. Jones provided the strident guitar. It should have been massive I always thought but it only made it to No 24. Follow up single “Plug Me In (To the Central Love Line)” stalled outside the Top 40 and the album “24 Hours” was deemed a failure. One final re-release of “No Memory” in 1991 attempted to put some life back into their career but it also flopped.\n\nMaggie is still in the music business and releasing records to this day. As for Rick? No idea. Do you think he knew Maggie was going to whip off his hat in this performance? Didn’t look like it to me.\n\nThe Top 10…\n\n10. Was (Not Was) – “Walk The Dinosaur”\n\n9. Kiss – “Crazy, Crazy Nights”\n\n8. Pet Shop Boys – “Rent”\n\n7. Billy Idol – “Mony Mony Live”\n\n6. Erasure – “The Circus”\n\n5. Fleetwood Mac – “Little Lies”\n\n4. Jan Hammer – “Crockett’s Theme”\n\n3. Bananarama – “Love In The First Degree”\n\n2. George Michael – “Faith”\n\n1. Bee Gee – “You Win Again”: The Gibb brothers are still there at No 1 but this week we get the promo video rather than a studio performance and let’s be fair, the video is shite. It’s essentially just the three of them shuffling about to a playback of the song but filmed in grainy, jerky black and white in an attempt to make it look arty. Then there’s some fairly random images thrown in for good measure which I presume are supposed to link back to the song through a very tenuous link of gambling (playing cards, dice) – “You Win Again” – geddit? Sprinkle in some images of some elegant, attractive models and that’s about it. Utter crap. At least Barry Gibb has tried to keep his hair under control by tying it back in a pony tail.\n\nWe would not see the group in our charts again for the rest of the decade as subsequent single releases from the parent album “E.S.P.” all bombed. They would return in the early 90s with a couple of Top 5 hits. I’m not sure what Barry’s hair was doing by then.\n\nThe play out video is Fleetwood Mac with “Little Lies”. Watching this back, the band seemed to have very little to do with 1987. I mean, just look at them! Mick Fleetwood looks like…well… Mick Fleetwood! A giant sized hippy. Stevie Nicks is in her customary swirly, ruffled dress which she predictably does actually swirl at one point in the video and the rest of them look like they’re still in the 70s. Only Lindsey Buckingham looks like he knows which decade he’s in and has dressed accordingly.\n\n“Little Lies” was at its No 5 peak here and they would have only one other UK hit in the rest of their career.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0004vz8/top-of-the-pops-29101987\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own. Sorry if you don’t agree.\n\nSome bed time reading?\n\nhttp://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.com/2017/10/october-21-november-3-1987.html\n\nIt’s late October 1987 and seven days on from the Great Storm (which I neglected to comment on in last weeks post on the day that it actually happened). I was firmly ensconced back into student life in Sunderland Poly at the time and I do recall it being a bit windy in the North -East that night but it was nothing compared to what some parts of the rest of the country suffered. Anyway, back to the music and tonight’s TOTP seems to be some sort of UK/US hybrid with a couple of links to LA to somebody called Nia Peeples who Wikipedia tells me was a singer and actress who was best known at the time for being in the TV version of Fame. She must have been in the later series as I don’t remember her from its 1982 heyday. More of Nia later though…\n\nIn the UK studio we have Was (Not Was) with “Walk The Dinosaur”. The band has the feel of a funked up pre-historic version of Kid Creole and the Coconuts here. Well, they do have a singer in a wide brimmed hat and some scantily clad female dancers. I love the fact that Don and David Was look like some sort of mad musical scientists in this performance. You can almost see them thinking “Look what glorious concoction we have brewed up in the studio”.\n\nA few years after this I purchased their wonderful collection album “Hello Dad…I’m In Jail” which includes some great tracks including this, possibly my favourite of theirs and better than anything the Godfather of Soul ever did (No you f**k off!)…\n\nOur first trip to the US TOTP studio is next. So what was this US TOTP all about? Apparently it went out on the CBS Network and ran for 26 shows between September ’87 and March ’88. Its lack of success was probably due to the surfeit of music shows that already existed over the water or maybe US audiences just couldn’t understand Gary Davies’ British accent.\n\nThe act that the aforementioned Nia Peeples introduces are Los Lobos with “Come On Let’s Go” which feels like a bit of an anti-climax as a start for this new venture to be fair although Nia does her best to big them up in her intro.\n\nI didn’t mind the song and I liked the film it was taken from (La Bamba) but I’m not sure Los Lobos were the most exciting band to look at on stage. Harsh? Maybe but the lead singer hardly moves at all! He should have taken a leaf out of Marty McFly’s book. That’s how you do a rock ‘n’ roll number …sort of.\n\nNext is a single that was hardly a failure but was kind of an anachronism during the performer’s ’87-’88 imperial phase. “Rent” by the Pet Shop Boys was a No 8 hit which is certainly not to be sneered at (Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran would have given their right arms for such a big hit at this time) but it did stand out as a blip in their run of chart placings which went:\n\n“It’s Sin” – 1\n\n“What Have I Done To Deserve This” – 2\n\n“Rent” – 8\n\n“Always On My Mind” – 1\n\n“Heart” – 1\n\nThe single’s provocative title misled many a listener into thinking it was about a rent boy but Neil Tennant dismissed this notion stating it was written from a female perspective with the protagonist forgoing happiness in return for financial security in a relationship of compromise.\n\nThe sound of it is certainly downbeat and drenched in melancholy with that haunting keyboard refrain running throughout it. It’s also quite beautiful as well I think. Maybe it was too fragile and spare for the casual pop fan to buy into after their more recent rousing songs like “Suburbia” and “It’s A Sin”. Was it a poor choice of single then? Possibly. Maybe the more uptempo “One More Chance” would have been a better track to be taken from the “Actually” album in terms of a higher chart placing. It was hardly a mis-step in their career though. We’ll see them again soon enough with the Xmas No 1 single.\n\nBack across the pond again now. Fancy some dumb-ass American rock?* You’re in luck for here come Kiss with “Crazy Crazy Nights”. To be fair, I always quite liked this in a non-demanding, fine-on-the-radio-but-I-wouldn’t-buy-it kind of way. Yes it’s loud and brash but it’s also fun. It was certainly a sing-along favourite in the student house I lived in.\n\nI don’t know too much about Kiss but I’m guessing that this era of the band isn’t their fans’ favourite. “Crazy Crazy Nights” was taken from the album “Crazy Nights” ( I always wondered why the album title had one ‘crazy’ less) and its intentional catchiness sounded like it had been written by a band in need of a hit. And it worked though maybe not in the way the band had expected. A minor No 65 hit in their native US, it was far more successful in Europe and was Top Ten in the UK (No 4) and Norway (No 7).\n\nIn my head, this was the first time that the band had appeared without their trademark make-up but Wikipedia tells me that isn’t the case and that they had unmasked as long ago as 1983 with the “Lick It Up” album and tour.\n\n*I’m guessing the two guys either side of Simon Bates may have. Were they for real or were they strategically placed stooges?\n\nAfter one synth pop duo in the Pet Shop Boys come the act that matched them hit for hit throughout the decade – Erasure. Much like the former’s song on tonight’s show, “The Circus” was also an understated single which was in direct contrast to their previous uptempo releases. Featuring an unlikely accordion and some social commentary lyrics, it was the fourth single released from their album of the same name. Unlike “Rent” though, I never cared for it much. Maybe it was the accordion. It just sounded really convoluted and lacking in melody to me. Whatever I thought about it made no difference to the song’s success though as it was a No 6 hit.\n\nThe Breakers are still here and it’s a case of another month another hit for The Cure, this time with “Just Like Heaven”. This was their ninth consecutive Top 40 hit since 1983 and was the third single to be lifted from their “Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me” album. I must admit that around this time I kind of lost track of the band a bit and although I know and like the song, I wouldn’t have been able to tell you what year this had been released without looking it up. It has that familiar Cure feel to it, all other worldly and yet intensely catchy. Yep, it’s a good song in my book and made No 29 on the UK charts.\n\nRobert Smith was in the news again recently as The Cure were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and he seemed less than overwhelmed by the prospect. This is just brilliant…\n\nWhat?! A Ray Parker Jr song that isn’t “Ghostbusters”?! It’s true! Actually I do remember this one (despite it being utterly forgettable) as it was another fave of my student housemates. I think they were being ironic. Students eh?\n\nAbsolutely nothing like “Ghostbusters”, “I Don’t Think That Man Should Sleep Alone” has a vague hint of “Moonlighting” about it but otherwise is just generic late night soul music with some thinly veiled f**k buddy lyrics:\n\n“I can’t seem to get warm enough\n\nEven with four blankets and a sheet\n\nI may as well be honest girl\n\nI think I need a little body heat”\n\nThis ghastly number somehow rose to No 13 in the UK charts. Just awful.\n\nOne of the most iconic videos of the year, nay the decade next! Ask anybody who lived through this era to picture George Michael in their mind’s eye and this will almost certainly be the image that they conjure up. One year on from Wham!’s farewell, George was about to launch this re-invented version of himself on a global scale. The title track from his multi -platinum “Faith” album, this song was a No 1 hit around the world including the US where it was the best selling single of 1988.\n\nIt took me a while to get into it to be honest. The church organ version of Wham!’s “Freedom” as the intro before the stripped back production of the Bo Diddley style guitar was a world away from his earlier material alongside Andrew Ridgeley and even from the lush layers of “I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)”. After the notoriety of ‘I Want Your Sex” though, at least this one was catchy.\n\nThe stubble, ripped Levi’s, Ray-Bans and leather jacket image would be lampooned many times over the years and indeed Michael himself would distance himself from it by effectively killing it off in his “Freedom ’90” video via detonation. I think my favourite send up of it though occurs in this video…\n\nThe Top 10 was thus…\n\n10. George Michael – “Faith”\n\n9. Fatback Band – “I Found Lovin”\n\n8. Billy Idol – “Mony Mony (Live)”\n\n7. Erasure – “The Circus”\n\n6. M/A/R/R/S – “Pump Up The Volume”\n\n5. Bananarama – “Love In The First Degree”\n\n4. Kiss – “Crazy, Crazy Nights”\n\n3. Abigail Mead and Nigel Goulding – “Full Metal Jacket”\n\n2. Jan Hammer – “Crockett’s Theme”\n\n1. Bee Gees – “You Win Again”: Seeing off competition from a drill instructor and Miami Vice, the brothers Gibb are top of the heap again. In the last post I made mention of The Alarm’s ever changing hairstyles to which my old Poly mate Andy remarked “Never mind The Alarm, we were all in awe of Barry Gibb’s amazing hair” and he’s right! Look at it! It seemed to grow in so many different directions all at the same time. There’s about three different styles in there all on one head! And none of it moved! Ever! Quite remarkable!\n\nThe play out video is “Love In The First Degree” by Bananarama which has rocketed into the Top 5 thereby vindicating the group’s decision to sell their souls to the Devil otherwise known as working with Stock, Aitken and Waterman.\n\nI met up with a couple of friends this weekend and whilst we were watching this particular TOTP on iPlayer my mate Steve came out with “So are Bananarama back together as a threesome then?” Err…’threesome’? I think maybe the word you were after was ‘trio‘ Steve?! So who was my favourite ‘Nana? Ooh no! That looks wrong written down doesn’t it? Not ‘Nana. Whose using the wrong word now eh?! OK – who was my favourite member of Bananrama? It was always Keren but nowadays I’m wondering if I may have overlooked Siobhan all this time. Sorry Sara.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to catch the whole show as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0004nrj/top-of-the-pops-22101987\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own.

Well, nearly and only in TOTP repeats land. After four consecutive shows throughout November we have skipped a couple and find ourselves on the brink of Christmas 1984. To clarify, this is not the Xmas TOTP show for that year though – presenter Simon Bates is very clear on this point although it “is a Christmassy atmosphere” he admits and to that end the first act tonight is Roy Wood doing ” I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday”. I don’t remember this being in the charts in 1984 at all. Bates informs us that the song was also re-released three years earlier (I don’t recall that either). I do remember that Slade pulled off a similar trick in 1983 when they rushed out “Merry Christmas Everybody” on the back of the huge success of their “My Oh My” single and took it back into the Top 20. Presumably there was some similar marketing strategy going on behind the idea to put out ” I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday” again.\n\nThis is not Wizzard though – this is head wizzard (a warlock?) Roy Wood out on his own backed by the Kempsey school choir that Janice Long is quick to ensure gets a name check. Kempsey you say Janice? That’s near to Worcester where I grew up. How come a school choir from Worcestershire were on TOTP? Ah well, now there’s a story….apparently the original 1973 recording featuring the Stockland Green Bilateral School from Birmingham was lost so when Roy Wood wanted to release the song again in 1981, the had to re-record it from scratch. As it was recorded in Muff (that’s his name OK?!) Murfin’s studio in Kempsey, he persuaded the local school choir to sing on it. So when you hear the song on the radio this Christmas, as you surely will, it’s the 1981 version and not the 1973 original. Or is it? If you want to read all about the myths behind this Christmas classic here’s the link….\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25402438\n\nFor the record this 1984 release reached No 23 in the charts beating the 1981 version (No 41) but coming nowhere near the original’s No 4 placing.\n\nOK – enough of all that. What’s next? Oh crap! It’s “We All Stand Together” by Paul McCartney and the Frog Chorus!!! I have tried to wipe this one from my memory but what I do recall of it was that it was god-awful. It was virtually a novelty record wasn’t it? Wasn’t it also something to do with Rupert the Bear. Let’s have a look…\n\n*checks Wikipedia*\n\nYes I was right. It featured on the animated film Rupert and the Frog Song which was produced by Paul McCartney. The film was released theatrically as an accompaniment to McCartney’s feature film Give My Regards to Broad Street. Macca must have been a big Rupert fan as he acquired the rights to the film the day after the break up of the Beatles and had been planning his Rupert movie since then.\n\nIt was regarded as a joke record at my school and anyone who displayed even the slightest sign that they didn’t mind it was instantly dismissed as feeble -minded. Harsh maybe but those were the rules back in the day.\n\nAlso Janice Long really can’t do an impression of a frog. It’s “ribbit” not “nidip” Janice!\n\nA proper song now to rescue us from novelty and Christmas records…here’s Bronski Beat with “It Ain’t Necessarily So”. This really is a proper song as well being a George and Ira Gershwin composition from their opera Porgy and Bess.\n\nI was very take it or leave it about this one at the time (philistine that I was) – it just seemed… well…boring I guess compared to the Hi N-R-G of “Why?” or the haunting melody of ‘Smalltown Boy”. It isn’t of course, it’s great and a very brave choice of single by the band which I can now appreciate. Hell’s teeth it has a clarinet in it! How many hits around this time featured a clarinet?!\n\nJanice Long advises us to check out the B-side called “Close To The Edge”. Well if it’s good enough for Janice…\n\nSo what did we think? Yeah, I’m good thanks Janice. Cheers anyway.\n\n“It Ain’t Necessarily So” peaked at No 16 and would be the last single release to feature the original trio of Jimmy Somerville, Larry Steinbachek and Steve Bronski (they released a cover of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” early in 1985 with Marc Almond sharing vocal duties with Somerville).\n\nRight then…here’s Spandau Ballet with “Round And Round” which as well as being the fourth and final single from their “Parade” album is also a convenient segue into me talking about attending my first ever live concert.\n\nYes, the first gig that I ever attended was Spandau Ballet – what of it?! A quick search of the internet suggests that it was Sunday 16th Dec (so just four days prior to this TOTP broadcast) and was at the Birmingham NEC. How did it come about? My elder brother had a mate who, unlike most of his friends, was not a complete Paul Weller superfan and was a pop kid like me (despite being a couple of years older). He was going with some of his friends (but not my brother) so he got me a ticket and I tagged along with them.\n\nI remember thinking I needed to buy some new clothes specifically to go to the gig so I duly trotted off to my local trendy clothes emporium one Friday after school and came back with some sort of grey canvas jacket and trouser combo. It wasn’t a great look although I probably thought it was at the time.\n\nFinally the big day arrived and off I went with my brother’s mate and his group of friends…and that group included at least two girls in it! Bloody Hell! I hadn’t bargained on that or practised beforehand behaving like a cool person. Why it hadn’t occurred to me that a group of pop fans going to a Spandau Ballet concert wouldn’t include some girls in it I’m not sure. Anyway, I think I pulled it off or, as is more likely, they were nice girls who took pity on me and talked to me and tried to include me in the group. One of them really fancied Tony Hadley I recall.\n\nAs for the gig itself, I can remember very little about it other than there was no support and the venue lights going down and some spots starting to swirling around the arena heralding the arrival of the band. After that, I can’t recall anything though I’m sure they must have played all the hits including “Round And Round” which was my brother’s mate’s favourite. I feel sure I would have bought a tour programme but I can’t find any such thing in my possessions and despite many searches I can’t find any footage of that particular concert out there on the internet. Some things will still have to just be accessed by memory (however limited) and maybe that’s a good thing. We can’t have all our memories subverted by YouTube can we?\n\nAs for “Round And Round” the song, I liked it. To my ears it sounded classy with that single synthesiser keyboard opening, those lush harmonies, the chunky but warm guitar line leading into that oh so melodic chorus. Not everyone agreed – a review in No 1 magazine described it as “well crafted tedium” and it was certainly the case that Gary Kemp was well into his artisan songwriter phase (“we’re the artisans and we’ve been crafted” sings Tony Hadley on this very song).\n\nAnd the video? I can only assume that they were short on time due to the Parade tour and they had to dispense with a huge cinematic video the like of which had been produced for the previous two singles “I’ll Fly For You” and “Highly Strung”. Apart from some stilted performance shots of the band, its all down to the creative vision of the director with most of the action revolving around a classroom meets Alice in Wonderland concept. You can imagine Gary Kemp seeing the rushes and saying “Tell you what mate, do it all in black and white. Looks a bit arty then dunnit?”.\n\nThe band seem to be in their paisley silk period clothes wise that seemed to be briefly popular around this time (see also Thompson Twins and Frankie Goes To Hollywood). Damn! That was the look I should have gone for when purchasing my concert outfit!\n\nRight – that’s already 1500 words and I’m only halfway through the acts on tonight’s show. Time to speed up. Here’s a song that the least said about the better – “Soul Deep” by The Council Collective. This was essentially a charity record (another one!) put together by Paul Weller. Whilst its intentions were laudable (raising funds for striking miners and their families), the song itself was dreadful. The lyrics certainly didn’t pull any punches (“There’s brother ‘gainst brother, there’s fathers against sons, but as for solidarity, I don’t see none“) but where was the tune Paul?! And nobody needs Paul Weller rapping in their lives!\n\nSimon Bates introduces the song by asking us to do some star spotting…what?! It’s just the Style Council with Junior “Mama Used To Say” Giscombe and Jimmy Ruffin. OK- Ruffin is a soul legend but it’s hardly Band Aid is it? The song would peak at No 24 but sadly the miner’s strike would continue in its misery until March the following year.\n\nSimon Bates in correct chart prediction shock! Yes, Bates predicted something music related that actually happened. Whilst introducing “I Want To Know What Love Is” by Foreigner, he called it a future No1 and he was right! It wouldn’t make No 1 until the new year when I think it might have been the first new chart -topper after Band Aid, taking five weeks on the Top 40 and seven in all from release date to get there. I must admit I didn’t remember it being around as a single in 1984 – its a 1985 tune in my head. I didn’t know much about Foreigner bar that they were the band who did that “Waiting For A Girl Like You” song a few years before and this new one was unlikely to convert me into a fan. It’s a bit of a dirge and seems to plod along for an eternity before it all gets resolved with the gospel choir finale. The only thing that is interesting about it is that Tom Bailey of the Thompson Twins plays keyboards on it which I had forgotten until Janice Long’s reminder.\n\nTalking of whom….here is Tom and the other Thompson Twins with “Lay Your Hands On Me”. This was the band’s eighth consecutive Top 40 hit and their fifth in 1984 (if you include “Hold Me Now” ). They were at the top of their game and yet…it could be argued that this was the point where the rot was starting to set in. Previous single “Sister Of Mercy” had stalled at No 11 halting their run of Top 5 hits but then it was the fourth single from the album so that could be explained away.\n\nHowever, “Lay Your Hands On Me” was brand new material – the first single from a forthcoming album – and although it stuck rigidly to their successful pop formula (it’s basically a re-write of “Hold Me Now”), it only made No 13 on the charts. Maybe it had just got caught up in the Xmas rush or maybe it was the Band Aid effect…or maybe it was something more terminal.\n\nUnfortunately for the band it was the final theory. The album took another nine months to arrive and by that point it was all a bit too late. That album (“Here’s To Future Days” ) did achieve gold sales but it was a massive step down from the double platinum “Into The Gap” and the band’s fortunes were never to revive. For the record, I quite liked “Lay Your Hands On Me”.\n\nAnd so to the No 1 and it is of course Band Aid with “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” We all know the story and have all seen the video hundreds of times but it’s still a good Christmas song (certainly the best of all the other versions of it) and you can’t explain to people who weren’t there at the time or who were too young to appreciate it what a spectacle it was to see all those huge pop stars on the same record. Wikipedia advises that Rick Parfitt and Francis Rossi of Status Quo recorded some vocals but they were deemed unusable. You can make your own jokes up.\n\nDid I buy it? Of course I did – I had a social conscience thank you! Years later at Poly the subject of Band Aid came up in a conversation where someone in the group admitted he hadn’t bought the single and had simply taped it off the radio. We were all appalled.\n\nFor some reason the play out music this week is “Ghostbusters” by Ray Parker Jr despite it having already reached its commercial peak and was now coming down the charts. I blame Simon Bates and his Christmas office party vibe.\n\nFor posterity’s sake, I include the chart run down below:\n\nDisclaimer\n\nOK – here’s the thing – the TOTP episodes are only available on iPlayer for a limited amount of time so the link to the programme below only works for about another month so you’ll have to work fast if you want to see Simon “Nostradamus” Bates in action as I can’t find the full programme on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09g38n9/top-of-the-pops-20121984\n\nI make no claim to the rights of this show and all ownership and contents including logos and graphics belongs totally to the BBC or copyright holder(s).\n\nAll opinions on the music and artists featured are my own.
