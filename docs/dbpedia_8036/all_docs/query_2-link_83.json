        "text": "Nostalgia music is having a moment. And it's because of the way streaming works. In the pre-digital era, you couldn't manufacture, distribute, & sell everything in your catalog. Retail space & manufacturing capacity was limited. You had frontline music coming out so you had to make choices. If a record fell below a sales threshold you would stop making it. These were called \"cut outs.\" Now you can listen to everything. I mean EVERYTHING. The entire history of western recorded music. All 220M tracks or so (as estimated by Audible Magic). And music fans want catalog music: almost 74% of all streaming is catalog, including almost 90% of rock music (according to Luminate). So when these heritage artists tour, they still have fans still actively listening. And younger artists want to feature with older artists to garner some of that audience. Maybe music isn't so much a young person's game anymore? #musicindustry #musicbusiness #streaming #catalog\n\nCarlos: The Santana Journey assessment – profile of guitar hero very a lot in management | Movies (Exportain.com) https://ift.tt/4IqXcwE For these solely passingly within the topic, this resolutely enough portrait of guitarist Carlos Santana is the cinematic equal of a well-written and factchecked Wikipedia web page however with masses extra photos and movie clips. Hardcore followers could really feel higher served by the deep dive into Santana’s childhood and youth in Mexico, adopted by his breakthrough into the San Francisco psychedelic music scene, after which on to that career-making efficiency at Woodstock in 1969. Forgive me if in case you have heard this one earlier than, however Santana supposedly dropped acid given to him by Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead, anticipating he would have hours to return down earlier than his band, named after him, needed to go on and play. Instead, they had been known as on stage quickly after. The bizarre faces Santana might be seen making within the immortal documentary of the competition are apparently a results of him considering that the neck of his guitar was a snake that he needed to wrestle into musical submission. Those had been the times. After the hit albums and big excursions of the Nineteen Seventies, the story will get a bit duller – as most of those tales do. The narrative takes within the inevitable dissolution of the primary marriage, the low occasions after which the comeback when Santana shifted musical route a bit. As a documentary topic, albeit one clearly very a lot answerable for his picture right here and never about to let the film-makers present him in something however a flattering mild, he comes throughout fairly nicely: articulate, nonetheless useless sufficient to have himself filmed shirtless, however grounded by sturdy household ties. That stated, two of his sisters are interviewed and you may inform by their postures and hesitancies that they’re holding again huge resentments. Indeed, it isn’t clear how director Rudy Valdez is in Santana, or whether or not he’s simply doing this gig as a way to an finish. Valdez’s filmography is crammed with works that sound much more hard-hitting and social justice-oriented than this behind-the-music fluff. Even so, Valdez will get the job carried out, laying down a continuing soundtrack of Santana’s music within the background that (to be trustworthy) feels like variations on the identical theme time and again at barely completely different speeds. No point out is made from probably the most controversial factor Santana has carried out lately, which was to say on stage that transgender individuals ought to keep “in the closet”, remarks for which he has since apologised. Carlos: The Santana Journey is exhibiting on 23 and 27 September in UK and Irish cinemas.

The collection is organized as an object that contains multiple albums which are also objects. Each album is represented in the collection with a unique id as the property name. Within each album object, there are various properties describing information about the album. Not all albums have complete information. The updateRecords function takes 4 arguments represented by the following function parameters: records - an object containing several individual albums id - a number representing a specific album in the records object prop - a string representing the name of the album’s property to update value - a string containing the information used to update the album’s property Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function. Your function must always return the entire records object. -> If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album. -> If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, assign the value to that album's prop. -> If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, you need to update the album's tracks array. First, if the album does not have a tracks property, assign it an empty array. Then add the value as the last item in the album's tracks array. Note: A copy of the recordCollection object is used for the tests. You should not directly modify the recordCollection object. // Setup const recordCollection = { 2548: { albumTitle: 'Slippery When Wet', artist: 'Bon Jovi', tracks: ['Let It Rock', 'You Give Love a Bad Name'] }, 2468: { albumTitle: '1999', artist: 'Prince', tracks: ['1999', 'Little Red Corvette'] }, 1245: { artist: 'Robert Palmer', tracks: [] }, 5439: { albumTitle: 'ABBA Gold' } }; // Only change code below this line function updateRecords(records, id, prop, value) { if (value === '') { delete records[id][prop]; } else if (prop !== 'tracks') { records[id][prop] = value; } else if (prop === 'tracks') { if (!records[id].hasOwnProperty('tracks')) { records[id]['tracks'] = []; } records[id]['tracks'].push(value); } return records; } updateRecords(recordCollection, 5439, 'artist', 'ABBA')\n\nALBUM ANNOUNCEMENT They say the only thing constant is change, and after some 15 years of music-making with their original lineup, change finally came last year for Balsam Range. Now, with the upcoming release of Kinetic Tone — available for pre-save/add/order ahead of its December 1 release — the group puts an exclamation point on their embrace of the new as they welcome mandolin virtuoso Alan Bibey. Yet beyond the refreshment of energy it embodies, the album reveals the band as more committed than ever to expressing a broad vision of life through compelling artistry. “When Balsam Range went into the studio at the beginning of 2023 to begin this album,” the album's liner notes recount, “it was immediately obvious to everybody present that something was different. A new level of excitement and joy of creating was present.” Indeed, that new quantum of energy was responsible for the project’s eventual title. “Kinetic Tone,” explain the notes, “is a not-so-well-known musical term defining how sounds move from being static to changing tone by the application of ENERGY. Could be a voice. Could be a guitar. Could be voices and instruments acting in concert. We would argue that it can also be a shared mindset of a musical group.” Here, that newly-invigorated mindset is embodied in a wide-ranging set of songs that could only have come from what the notes call Balsam Range 2.0. From the dramatic opening of the first song, Kinetic Tone separates itself from the ranks of the ordinary. Instead, it’s a collection of stories, portraits, and meditations that encompass adventure, lost love, aging and growth, faith, the urge to roam, and the changing ways of mountain and small-town life. And while there is a full measure of songs that feature the smooth, flowing grooves and burnished harmonies for which Balsam Range are renowned, there is a new emphasis on and a bit of a new edge to the hard drive of straight-ahead bluegrass in songs, too.

Yes, sprawling across a sheet of unprecedented proportions—104 inches by a mere 10, imagine, as though one were trying to read the horizon itself—and yet within this expanse lies not the familiar, not the comfort of the staves and clefs and black dots neatly arrayed like soldiers, no. Here lies chaos, or so it seems at first blush, a chaos meticulously planned and plotted along axes not of our making but of the composer's, a realm where the Moire, hyperplexic in its complexity, invites, no, demands a recusal from the linear, the sequential, the narrative of music as we know it. Consider, if you will, the audacity. The sheer, unmitigated gall of pushing notation from edge to edge, as though the very boundary of the page itself were but a mere suggestion, an inconvenience to be acknowledged and then promptly ignored. Within this frame, this canvas, the notes do not march; they cavort, they tangle in dense, wriggling fields, competing striations that defy the eye to follow without succumbing to vertigo. And yet, within this apparent anarchy, there is order, a discipline that speaks to a choreography of the mind so intricate, so private, that one might find oneself whispering of Cunningham, of Cage, those luminaries who too sought to break free from the shackles of the expected, the conventional. And what of the performers, those brave souls called upon to navigate this maelic maelstrom? For them, the color, the hue of a note, a line, a smudge becomes a signifier, a beacon through the fog of complexity. These ridged, sinuous marks, they are not mere decoration but a language unto themselves, a notation that speaks of timbre and attack and decay as much as of pitch and rhythm. The performers, then, must become not just musicians but translators, interpreters of a script that acknowledges no master, that adheres to no orthodoxy. Yet, for all its defiance, its reveling in the joyous liberation from form, there remains the grid. Ah, the grid, that imposition of order upon the chaotic, the unruly. It does not rationalize; no, that would be too simple, too pedestrian. It serves rather as a reminder, a concession to the necessity of form, of structure, however tenuous, however fluid. It is both a cage and a key, a means of navigating the vast, uncharted territories that \"Silver Stockholm\" lays bare before us. - Cormac McCarthy, American Novelist https://lnkd.in/eJdiHZEH"
