        "text": "Jordan Davis has exploded in the country music scene — he's released a remarkable 7 No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. But you would never guess he's hiding a secret addiction.\n\nIt's so bad, in fact, the singer says his family has to keep close tabs on him to ensure he doesn't get ahold of his vice unless he's supervised.\n\nThe \"Tucson Too Late\" singer stopped by the Taste of Country Nights studio to chat with Evan Paul, and right as the interview was wrapping up, we stumbled upon Davis' intense addiction to Sour Patch Kids.\n\nDavis was asked what's on his tour rider — the list of things he requires backstage — and that's where things became unhinged.\n\n\"Sour Patch, that's my like ... Sour Patch Kids are my go-to,\" he dishes.\n\n\"But they have to be in the boxes, just one Sour Patch, because if they get me the bag, I'll eat the whole bag. I don't know how to turn off eating Sour Patch.\"\n\nHe's not even allowed to keep them at his house.\n\n\"There's no Sour Patch allowed at my house for that reason. I will eat every single one of them,\" Davis admits. \"I will eat so many Sour Patch that it like burns my tongue.\"\n\nHe won't even stop when it starts to hurt — he can't help himself.\n\n\"I know it's happening, I'm like, 'Dude, I'm 30 deep right now. If I keep going, this is gonna be a major problem tomorrow.' I push through, man, I'll eat the whole bag.\"\n\n\"I love 'em. I love 'em so much,\" he adds quietly.\n\nHe even has a Sour Patch Kids story!\n\n\"You know like the bags you get at the airport, you'll go into those little stores? So they're not massive, but they're not small. So I bought one of the regular Sour Patch, and then when I pulled that one off, it was like this watermelon new Sour Patch back there.\n\nSo I was like, 'Okay, this is interesting — Sour Patch changing the game up.' So I grab that bag, I jumped on a plane – a Southwest flight from Nashville to Baltimore – and by the time I landed in Baltimore, those bags were toast.\"\n\nNext up, Davis heads to Texas for shows on Aug. 9 and 10, and let's just hope he's got a handler along at the airport or he might end up with a backpack full of the good stuff."
