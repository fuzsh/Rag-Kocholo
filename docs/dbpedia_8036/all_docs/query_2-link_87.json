        "text": "GRAND FORKS — UND's Energy and Environmental Research Center has received $5 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to establish a Williston Basin partnership to assist carbon capture efforts in that region. The EERC and its partners will match an additional $1.25 million.\n\nThe funding was announced Thursday, Aug. 8, by the office of Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-North Dakota. A release from the office of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, also R-North Dakota, said the funding will support \"North Dakota's role as a world leader in the development and implementation of carbon capture, utilization and storage\" technologies.\n\nIn a statement, Hoeven said North Dakota is leading the way in developing carbon capture technologies.\n\n\"This $5 million award provides continued support for the partnerships we’ve built to advance these efforts,\" he said in the statement. \"It will enable EERC to provide its technical expertise as companies develop basin-wide carbon storage facilities, utilizing our unique geology in the Bakken and the legal framework and regulatory certainty we’ve worked to provide at the state and federal level.\"\n\nCommercial carbon capture has grown substantially in recent years in the Williston Basin, which encompasses the western half of North Dakota, as well as portions of Montana, South Dakota and Manitoba. Private sector entities have advanced a number of commercial carbon capture projects in the Williston Basin, including multiple large-scale CO2 storage facilities and regional carbon management hubs that consist of multiple carbon sources, storage reservoirs and transport systems such as pipelines, according to the DOE.\n\nWith the new partnership, the EERC will help meet unmet demand for technical assistance, especially with potential storage resources and impacts on Williston Basin communities, a project description reads.\n\nThe EERC project is one of nine selected to provide technical assistance designed to reduce project costs and risks associated with carbon transport, storage and community engagement, according to the DOE. The projects selected will also improve monitoring effectiveness, build strategies for engaging with communities, and provide data to support permitting, policy development, and rulemaking, added a release from Cramer's office."
