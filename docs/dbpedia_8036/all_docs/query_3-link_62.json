        "text": "I will admit that the only thing I associated with Ray Parker Jr. prior to seeing this show is the Ghostbusters song. I did not know anything else about him. A friend had an extra ticket to his show and I decided to attend.\n\nHe is much more than just that song. He did play that song and played it very well. He did not seem to shy away from that song or rush through it like some other people would but instead he rocked the house with an extended version of the smash song.\n\nHe also has a ton of other famous soul and Pop songs that he did as both a member of Stevie Wonder’s band and also his own band during the time. He also is a very good guitar player and played most of the guitar work during the show. It is good to see that he is able to tour and display his great talent. He is much more than just that one song, but that song is a great ode to the 1980’s and a good way for any to reflect on their younger years. It also helps that he is such a talented musician.\n\nRead more"
