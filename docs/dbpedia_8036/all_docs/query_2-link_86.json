        "text": "A whole lot of chat about the two theatrical one sheet posters released for Ghostbusters: Afterlife this past week! Up first, a little tribute to a comedian we admired, then we really get into dissecting both the domestic and theatrical posters. What are we seeing? What AREN’T we seeing? And which do we prefer? All that plus some chat about Ray Parker Jr.’s documentary, Cleanin’ Up the Town coming to US theaters, and a little rebuttal to a YouTube video suggesting that Ghostbusters cannot be replicated.\n\nThis week on the show, Ectomobiles are showing up in Apple Maps and we’re diving into the back catalog of Discogs! First up, in the news we remember a few fallen friends in our lives, explore a few Apple Maps locations in Alberta that are snapshots in time of Ghostbusters: Afterlife filming, and a merch item or two. Then in the second half of the show, we’re going through all the rarities, b-sides, and alternative versions that spark to us on a search of Discogs. What are the instrumental versions we didn’t know existed out there? Want to hear parts of a few of them? Stay tuned!\n\nThis week on the show, what a map reveals about Fan Fest, a new score album and a Ray Parker Jr. announcement! First up, the boys talk about a new map revealed by Wizard World for the upcoming Fan Fest (illustrated by the amazing John Yurcaba) and what it reveals about the event. Then, a new release of Elmer Bernstein’s outstanding Ghostbusters score is coming from Sony Music, and the track listing has a few surprises. Then some talk about Ray Parker Jr.’s announcement about his “Who Ya Gonna Call” doc, and some J. Michael Straczynski AMA discussion. All that and a whole lot more on this week’s show!\n\nThis week on the show, we continue our series of Tobin’s Audio Guides - looks behind the essential elements that were key to making Ghostbusters what it is today. And with this installment, Troy explores the creation of Ray Parker Jr.’s iconic theme song. What was originally scripted that inspired a theme in the first place? Who were the duo of Hughes/Thrall and how did they come to become involved with the project? What became of their demo that was unused (and where can you hear bits and pieces of it)? And how did it eventually come to Ray Parker Jr. to write and record a demo in less than 72 hours? All of these questions and more will be answered in our third installment of Tobin’s Audio Guide!\n\nThis week on the show, Paul Feig wants another Call, Ernie and Ray chat, and Steve Johnson does a little nose candy. First up, Troy and Chris discuss the click bait du jour as Paul Feig mentions on the Simple Favor press circuit that he'd like to do another Ghostbusters film, what does it mean? Also, Steve Johnson got a little more ink this week because of his unorthodox inspiration for Slimer - a new revelation most likely to come in his next book. Rounding out the show is some discussion about Ray Parker Jr.'s podcast with Ernie Hudson and a couple shout outs to the Alberta Ghostbusters and the Ecto Force of Florida. It's a fun one, make sure to tune in!\n\nThis week on the show, Guinness World Records are broken, Jan Vogler engages on Twitter and is the Ghostbusters music video canon? First up, the latest in news including a follow-up on last week's conversation about the 800 number at the time of the original film's release, Rick Moranis joining the SCTV reunion in Toronto, a group of fans breaking world records at a marathon in London, Forbes magazine talking about Real Ghostbusters Playmobil toys, Terminal Reality back in the news after shutting down back in 2013, and more. Then, in the second half of the show, we discuss a topic presented to us: given that the Ghostbusters theme song appears in Ghostbusters II, does that mean the music video from 1984 is canon? Stay tuned!\n\nThis week on the show, spoiler-filled discussion on IDW's Crossing Over issue two, Bill Murray on Willie Geist, and Jack White remembers the 800 number! In the first half of the show, the latest news including Bill Murray's lengthy discussion with Willie Geist on the Sunday Sitdown, Ray Parker Jr.'s next guest on his podcast, a fun account of being on set in 1983 on GB Fans, Steve Johnson talking to the We Got This Covered blog, a surprise revelation about Harold Ramis' family, and Jack White talks with Jimmy Fallon about being a kid and calling an 800 number around the time Ghostbusters came out. Then in the second half of the show, the boys discuss IDW Comics' excellent second issue in the multi-dimensional Crossing Over event. It's a fun one, make sure to tune in!\n\nThis week on the show Troy and Chris are reunited to do what they do best, chat some Ghostbusters! After regrouping a bit on their respective Spring Break holidays, the boys chat about the Hook and Ladder No. 8 renovations seemingly coming to an end at the New York firehouse, IDW Crossing Over #2 hitting shelves this week (a week early), a fun and interesting Real Ghostbusters conversation that took place on Twitter between JMS and Joe Medjuck, Ray Parker Jr.'s new podcast, and much more!\n\nThis week on the show, talking about a new clip of Ghostbusters World gameplay, Richard Edlund's state of the VFX industry, Ray Parker Jr. documentaries and more! Troy is flying solo this week as Chris is out on vacation, but don't worry - still here to talk about all the news that's fit to print. First up, Eric at Ghost Corps showed us a little bit of Ghostbusters World gameplay. But were there a few hints toward what's to come visible on the screen? And what's with the dimensional portals? Diamond Select Series 7 is out on shelves now, and for the first time you can own Janosz Poha! SyFy has a great article with Richard Edlund looking back on his career and discussing the state of the effects industry, where of course Ghostbusters comes up. And finally, there's a Ray Parker Jr. documentary in the works, find out how you can help them fund the production!\n\nThis week on the show, some news and looking back on the third Ghostbusters live-action film one year after its release. Up first, Troy and Chris talk Ray Parker Jr.'s appearance in the documentary Hired Gun and the great interview he did with The Movie Guys. Also, a few updates on fundraising for mental health in Ghostbusters II actor Hank Deutschendorf's name, a 24-year old pinball wizard who won a Stern Ghostbusters pinball machine, audio from last year's Twisted Toonz Ghostbusters live-reading at the Phoenix Comic-Con, and yes - that photo above is your first-look at the upcoming Crossrip t-shirt with unique Dan Schoening artwork that'll be up for grabs soon!\n\nThis week on the Crossrip, we're catching up on news including the DVD/Blu-ray release of Ghostbusters: Answer the Call and more! There's a lot of marketing and merchandising surrounding the home video release and Troy and Chris break down the press appearances and special events that are on the docket including an appearance by Ray Parker Jr. and Paul Feig on the TODAY Show. The LEGO Dimensions expansion pack is out and the boys talk a little about a surprise cameo that has everyone talking, and that leads to a little conversation about the 2009 Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Ernie Hudson is hitting Oklahoma for Halloween. Lots of merch coming out including Ghostbusters International #9, Diamond Select Wave 4 action figures, and a whole lot more. It's a packed episode but we even snuck in a view listener voicemails!\n\nThis week we're celebrating the release of a new Ghostbusters film with coverage from the \"slime carpet\" in Hollywood, CA. In a recap of the live-stream feed that was featured on the Ghost Corps Facebook page, join Troy and Chris from the red carpet as they talk to Paul Feig, Katie Dippold, Kate McKinnon, Karan Soni, Bess Ross, Ray Parker Jr., Ernie Hudson, Chris Hardwick, No Small Children, and more! Special thanks to Eric Reich and Katie Lovick for all of their help and hospitality and for making this show possible... and to Ivan Reitman, sorry that we made you sound like a chipmunk on the livestream, we blame Facebook 100%.\n\nThis week on the Crossrip, we're joined by the minds behind BBQ Films' experience in Brooklyn, New York: Lenny Platt, Gabriel Rhoads, and Lauren Lickus! Plus a contest sponsored by Loot Crate! But in the first hour, catching up on the latest news (because there's a whole lot) - a new single by Elle King for the new Ghostbusters film was released as part of the new soundtrack announcement, Troy and Chris dissect all the news there. Global Ghostbusters Day is coming up on June 8th, the guys run down everything that entails including old and new cast members meeting in one place on the Jimmy Kimmell Live show this coming Wednesday. Chris is SUPER caffeinated and excited to have gotten his first batch of Cryptozoic trading cards, so buckle up because he's going to break it down. The boys talk about that Dan Aykroyd comment and a certain TV spot as well as Tom Zhou's breakdown of the trailer editorial. Lots of merch news including Mattel exclusives and puzzles galore. Stay tuned for news about how you can win a free limited edition Ghostbusters Loot Crate and then in our second hour, hear how a warehouse in Brooklyn was transformed for the ultimate Ghostbusters experience by the team at BBQ Films!\n\nCan Troy and Chris keep up with everything this week? We'll find out. This week talking about those two trailers, their exclusivity, and that new (kinda) subtitle \"Answer the Call\" plus some clarification as to why this might have been called Trailer 6. A little discussion about the six-minute review that's supposedly not going to lead to a review (but already was a review so, there's that). Matt Walsh talks very briefly about his role in the new Ghostbusters film. Soundtrack Talk - - News on Theodore Shapiro's Ghostbusters score coming in July as well as the RCA Soundtrack album closely following it - and will Ray Parker Jr. reprise his song? Will someone else? Activision video game details (including some discussion about it not being an online multiplayer). Ghostbusters Twitter emojis are live! Troy does a quick recap of the Nas Hstry event in West Hollywood - and the accompanying livestream that he jumped into. ThinkGeek has a statement for us to read about that awful t-shirt that happened to be missing a certain someone and doubled another. All that plus a merch round up on this week's show!\n\nThe new trailer is here! The new trailer is here! Join us for the second (and largest yet) Cyclotron roundtable that dives into chatting about the trailer. Troy and Chris are joined by IDW Artist (Dapper) Dan Schoening, Georgia Ghostbusters Craig Goldberg and Abigail Gardner, and Ghostbuster of BC Evilyn13 to examine every nook and cranny of that trailer like an English Muffin, and through the process might reveal a thing or two that you hadn't noticed the first 200 times viewing it. Tone, humor, horror, design, and the master of comic panel easter eggs helps the group notice a thing or two deep within the frames, don't miss this one!\n\nThis week, the Crossrip remembers David Margulies (\"Mayor Lenny Clotch\") and catches up on all the news that's fit for another podcast. Trailer Watch 2016 continues as no Ghostbusters (2016) trailer is in sight, but there's a whole lot of licensing news to talk about including Mattel action figures, Rubies Halloween costumes and a big event that took place in London this past week put on by the Rocket Licensing folks. Sounds boring? It wasn't - a good chunk of new props/gear from the 2016 film was on display and Troy and Chris feel like speculating on everything we saw. Ghost Corps wants you to know that you'll be able to have a Lazer Aventura at a Six Flags near you (and wants your franchise patches for a brand new display in their shiny offices)! Want to see GB16 early? Make a bid on IfOnly's charitable fundraising effort for a private screening before anyone else gets to see it. Want to hear some anecdotes we never knew about Ray Parker Jr.'s iconic Ghostbusters theme song and the music video that accompanied it? ScreenCrush had a great article that the boys will discuss. All that, plus a couple hashtags to use in the weeks coming on an all-new Crossrip!"
