        "text": "published on 2018-04-05T07:41:24Z\n\nWho you gonna callâ¦ me, please. Ray Parker, Jr., swoon. We talked growing up in Detroit, racial injustice, police brutality first hand, playing the clarinet and getting tired of blowing. I know. Rayâs first gig with The Spinners, to going on the road with Stevie Wonder, at 18 ~ without having to audition! Crazinessâ¦ I saw that tour! Little Stevie Wonder opened for The Stones, with Ray on guitar and David Sanborn on sax. What a band, what a concert! What stories Ray has to go with it. One girl, one ticket, two girls, two tickets, three girls, three tickets. The boy was busy! Ray moved to LA, started playing on records, and played withâ¦ everyone. Those were the daze. Chaka Khan, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, getting ripped off writing You Make Me Feel Like Dancing, which won the Grammy, and Ray didnât get his due credit. But, other than that itâs been a pretty sweet ride. We talked about his successful marriage, 24 yrs and counting, four sons, one making music in the studio while we were there. This is a good man. And what a musician. He played licks throughout, and a little bit of that iconic song, with Louise and I on gang vocals for âGhostbustersââ¦ which Ray pointed out, he never sings in the song. Coming soon, a movie ~ Who You Gonna Call, a book of the same name, and Ray hopes, his own TV show. Hell yeah. He couldnât be more charming, and damn, is he sexy!
