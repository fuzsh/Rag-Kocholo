        "text": "ODDS ‘N’ BODS\n\nM|A|R|R|S’ exciting 113bpm ‘Pump Up The Volume (Remix)’ (4AD BAD 707R) actually starts with less impact but has far more stuff scratched and sampled over it, including digital repetition of just part of Tom Browne’s ‘Funkin’ For Jamaica’ high note, and some bizarre Eastern singing … Dancin’ Danny D has given the bland Total Contrast ‘Jody’ a beefily juddering and hi-hat schlurped 119bpm Yardie Remix (London LONXR 142), with an instrumental too and an even tougher dubwise ‘That’s My Man Throwin’ Down’ Mix, full of fresh goodies … Danny D was about to spend a fortune on James Brown oldies until his father said, “Don’t do that — go and look in the attic, I’ve got them all up there” … that’s my man throwin’ up … Les Adams has created another excellent Cameo megamix for the B-side of their upcoming ‘She’s Mine’ … Supreme Records are starting their own club promotion mailing list, DJs’ application forms from Martin Shaw at Supreme, The Works, 105A Torriano Mews, off Torriano Avenue, Kentish Town, London NWS 2RX … ‘Roadblock’ is the only overground hit on the roots-reverting new ‘Street Sounds ’87 – 2‘ (Dance Music/StreetSounds STSND 87-2), otherwise full of obscure album tracks and imports including the terrific soulfully tugging Timmy Thomas-ish 106½bpm My Forté ‘Sometime Lover‘, a devil to trace on single despite several DJs charting it … Hindsight’s commercial pressings of ‘Lowdown’ include the party atmosphere lurching funky 108⅔bpm ‘Everybody In The House’, rather good … Bang The Party should have been the name of the act credited last week as S.A.W., these initials stamped onto the white label’s sleeve apparently standing for the deliberately misleading slogan “Sinful And Wicked” — oh, yes? … Jellybean has been remixing Whitney Houston’s ‘So Emotional’ (and a Frontline Mix of his own ‘The Real Thing’), producing Man Friday (with Larry Levan on lead vocals) and Anthony & The Camp (he, Marcus Miller, Nick Martinelli and Eumir Deodato each producing two tracks) – but his big exclusive revelation for rm was full details of the next Madonna album, a dance compilation called ‘You Can Dance’, that he has continuously segued using new remixes, Shep Pettibone’s of ‘Into The Groove‘ and ‘Where’s The Party‘, Bruce Forest’s of ‘Everybody‘, his own of ‘Holiday‘ and ‘Spotlight‘, and Steve Thompson’s of ‘Over And Over‘, the CD version also containing three bonus dubs … Shep Pettibone’s jumpily bounding 119½bpm Silver Screen Mix and more percussive 120bpm Movie House Mix of Madonna ‘Causing A Commotion’ (Sire W8224T) meanwhile give her the tightest groove she’s had in ages … Pepsi & Shirlie’s tritely chugging 135bpm ‘Can’t Give Me Love‘ (Polydor POSPX 885) has no connection with Stock Aitken Waterman, who do, however, appear to be behind the ‘Living In A Box’-tempoed (0-)108⅓bpm tapping jittery “white boy funk” pusher, Paul Barry ‘Complicated (Dance Mix)‘ (MCA Records COMT 1) … Living In A Box, meanwhile, are returning on the similarly tempoed purposefully jittering 101-0bpm ‘So The Story Goes‘ (Chrysalis LIBX 3), with some vocal interjections by Bobby Womack himself, in a Bruce Forest Dynamite Club Mix and bare Hip And Hop Dub Mix (flipped by a ponderously thrashed 114¾bpm house effort called ‘The Liam McCoy‘) … The Bootleggers’ 118¾bpm ‘Hot Mix 2‘ (Polo POLO 12-44), even more clumsily than their first one, mixes up remakes of many current pop disco hits without anything like the finesse of Mirage … Steve Walsh’s version of ‘I Found Lovin’’ has probably returned to the pop chart because it’s just about the summer’s biggest holiday hit in Spain! … Nottingham Ritzy celebrates its first birthday this Friday (September 11) and is sending a bus to collect, as special guests for the night, Stock Aitken Waterman, several of their star acts and myself – so see you there! … Tony Jenkins has an Up West night this Friday at Northolt’s C&L Country Club, with Ralph Tee, Barry Jeffrey, Bill Griffin and more, plus PAs … Saturday (12), Nicky Holloway and his Special Branch guests funk Great Shelford’s DeFreville Arms in Cambridgeshire, while his next Three Day Doo at Rockley Sands near Poole is set for October 16-18, with such as Pete Tong, Gilles Peterson, Bob Jones, Chris Brown, Chris Bangs, Johnny Walker, Paul Oakenfold (£40 tickets on 01-439 2628) … Camber Sands Pontins near Rye on that same October 16-18 weekend has Soul Brothers Promotions’ funk-to-reggae three-dayer (£41 ticket details on 0772-700282), followed there on November 6-8 by Kent Soul Festival’s weekender (£35 tickets on 0233-33652) … SEDA (South Eastern Disco Association) actually got its newsletter to me in time to plug the next meeting, this Sunday (Sept 13) at 7.30pm in Wrotham Heath’s Royal Oak … UK Mixing Champ 1985, Roger Johnson, now goes it alone presenting Friday’s 10pm NITE-fm slot on Radio London … Les Adams’ hot tip for a running mix that works for at least a minute is Prime Time ‘He’s Def‘ out of Joyce Sims ‘Lifetime Love (Def Beat Mix)‘, while Graham Gold tips Newcleus ‘The Huxtables (Dub)’, synched under Levert ‘Casanova’ … Aniela, the recently photographed female mixing jock, is leaving Cricklewood’s Ashtons in a month to follow Alan Coulthard’s route in reverse, going to Cardiff to study law at university (and possibly DJ there) … Siedah Garrett, as co-writer of ‘Man In The Mirror‘ on Michael Jackson’s new LP, is likely to be a millionairess by Christmas! … DON’T STOP JAMMIN’!\n\nL.A. MIX, it has to be revealed as others have started to give the game away, are in fact none other than the Mixdoctor LES ADAMS and keyboardist EMMA ‘E FORCE’ FREILICH, their hot white labelled ‘Don’t Stop (Jammin)‘ being due commercially at the end of the month on Breakout (USAT 615), although proper promo copies should be about this week. The record was totally created in Les’s equipment-packed home studio, a converted bedroom only about eight feet by five (even smaller as all the walls are clad at least 12 inches thick with records!) and despite Les’s prowess as a mixer with vinyl the track’s multitude of bits from past hits were all added as electronically triggered digital samples.\n\nJellybean in live mixing action at Delirium last week was, to ears now tuned to the fast cut ‘n scratch of modem mixing styles, surprisingly slow and unadventurous, all has painstakingly accurate traditional running mixes seeming an age in coming as he played nearly all of each record. Realising that the uptempo US-orientated female pop that he’d begun with wasn’t going over that well, he did finally catch a groove when he ran through Manu Dibango ‘Soul Makossa’, Fred Wesley & The JB’s ‘Everybody Got Soul’, Criminal Element Orchestra ‘Put The Needle To The Record’, Nitro Deluxe ‘The Brutal House’ and his own version of ‘Jingo’.\n\nJohn Robie, New York producer and mixer of much electro-hip hop material in the past but not so often name-checked these days, is currently ensconced at the Advision Studio here in London mixing Boy George and producing a brand new session with Afrika Bambaataa, while back in New York amongst his other projects due for release is new product from C-Bank.\n\nHOT VINYL\n\nMICHAEL JACKSON ‘Bad’ LP (Epic 450290 1)\n\nMaybe not as smooth for sustained listening as a whole album in comparison with his last one, the set’s main dance tracks are the ‘Thriller’-ish juddery jittering (0-)114bpm title track with Jimmy Smith organ, infectiously lurching and churning (0-)112⅔bpm ‘The Way You Make Me Feel’, forcefully jiggling and surging (0-)106bpm ‘Another Part Of Me’, ‘Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’’-ish (0-)118¼bpm ‘Smooth Criminal’ and rather dated Stevie Wonder-duetted spikily snapping 118¾bpm ‘Just Good Friends’, while a lot less floor-orientated are the jittery half-stepping 99bpm ‘Speed Demon’, moodily swaying 0-52½/105bpm ‘Liberian Girl’, heavy metal 0-65½-0bpm ‘Dirty Diana’, trickily unfurling 0-50-100-0bpm ‘Man In The Mirror’, already released 0-50/100bpm ‘I Just Can’t Stop Loving You’.\n\nCHIC ‘Jack Le Freak’ (Atlantic A9198T)\n\nPhil Harding’s Two Grooves Under One Nation remix of ‘FLM’ incorporated lots of jack track elements in ‘Do It Properly’ style before ending with Chic’s ‘Le Freak’, and now he’s used all those same jack track elements (plus some Mel & Kim!) to create a similarly styled total 120⅓-120-120¾-121-120¾bpm remix of ‘Le Freak’ itself, great fun (flipped by the 71-70⅓bpm ‘Savoir Faire’ jazz guitar instrumental).\n\nLOOP ‘Keep On Moving’ (Rock The House 001T, via Jet Star)\n\nIgnore the misleading label name, this is an absolutely excellent really soulfully sung and teased jiggly buoyant 99bpm jogger with a gentle go-go-ish rhythm, something like ‘Casanova’ without in any way being a copy, produced by Rodney Secret and Peter Hines (dub flip). So satisfying!\n\nRAY PARKER JR. ‘I Don’t Think That Man Should Sleep Alone’ (US Geffen Records 0-20636)\n\nIntimately muttering and croaking gorgeous gentle rather Marvin Gaye-ish (circa ‘What’s Goin’ On’) lightly attractive tripping unhurried 112-0bpm swayer, a surefire smash when it’s out here in a fortnight.\n\nGWEN McRAE ‘Funky Sensation ’87 (Female Preacher Mix)’ (Rhythm King LEFT 15T)\n\nGood if somewhat sanitised electronically cleaned up 101⅙bpm brand new remake (in three mixes) of her classic slinkily jogging soul bumper originally recorded on Atlantic some six years ago (when, incidentally, a rap version by Afrika Bambaataa and colleagues was the very first release on the Tommy Boy label).\n\nDARLENE DAVIS ‘Love Lines’ (US Take One Records TOR-21001)\n\nSatisfying old fashioned soulfully sung repetitive juddery thudding 111¾-111½-111¾-0bpm swaying roller with nice rolling piano behind the wailingly building vocal intensity (in four mixes), produced by Elai Tubo and Kevin Woodley.\n\nTHE O’JAYS ‘Don’t Take Your Love Away’ (Philadelphia International Records 12PIR 5)\n\nGamble & Huff-created soulfully sung train-tempoed (0-)121¾bpm urgent chugger with Leon Huff’s chording piano pounding in house style (the lyrics even go, “I’ll huff and I’ll puff, till I blow your house down”), building terrific gospel-ish excitement yet all but ignored while on import (instrumental, and the dead slow (0-)27⅓bpm ‘I Just Want Somebody To Love Me’).\n\nBLAZE ‘If You Should Need a Friend’ (US Quark QK006)\n\nVery exciting bubbly leaping 120bpm house skipper with a proper catchy song by expressive light voiced guys and some organ adding a Sixties flavour to its quite jazzy momentum (in four mixes), worth checking.\n\nMAGGOTRON ‘Welcome To The Planet Of Bass’ (US Jamarc Records BP7729)\n\nExcellent now quite house tempoed scratcher pumping up the volume with DJ Debonaire cutting lots of great stuff into what basically is the old 0-126bpm ‘Planet Rock’, an increasingly heard backing track these days (edit flip).\n\nNITRO DELUXE ‘Mission’ (US Cutting Records CR 215)\n\n‘The Brutal House’ master, producer Aldo Marin’s new rambling jitterer is another that reverts to the ‘Planet Rock/Al-Naafiysh’ style revived also by Dynamix II, most ‘Brutal’ with more of those naggingly twittering digital tones being the 118½bpm ‘Mission (Say Your Love)’, other shorter mixes being the 119⅓bpm ‘On A Mission’, 0-118½bpm ‘House Mission’ and freakily double beating 118⅓-0bpm ‘Closet Mission’, not initially as compulsive as ‘Let’s Get Brutal’.\n\nJONATHAN BUTLER ‘Jonathan Butler’ LP (Jive HIP 46)\n\nFinally out here after doing well Stateside, this very pleasant listening set is a double LP with many slowies and guitar instrumentals, the only tracks to have had any dancefloor reaction being the already comfortably familiar seeming ‘I Miss Your Love Tonight’, a gently agonised trippingly jogging 104⅓bpm swayer with a fruitless answering machine-replied ‘phonecall halfway, and the bass burbled soaring 112⅓bpm ‘Overflowing’, while the sinuously jiggling 94⅔bpm ‘Holding On’ and smoochily rolling ‘One More Dance’ could work too.\n\nWORKING WEEK ‘Surrender’ (Virgin VS 998-12)\n\nJulie Roberts-wailed rather empty 112¾bpm jerky jolter, due soon in a far superior more beefy Les Adams remix, worth waiting for.\n\nMARSHALL HAIN ‘Dancing In The City (Summer City ’87)’ (EMI 12EM 19)\n\nDutch remix wizard Ben Liebrand has added his jauntily jiggling 102⅙bpm go-go beat and some rasping sax to the girl-sung 1978 pop hit.\n\nBYRON LEE & THE DRAGONAIRES ‘Tiney Winey’ (Dynamic DYN 1219)\n\nPopular happy 116⅓bpm soca leaper remixed by Les Adams with hooks inserted from ‘Hot Hot Hot’ and added drum beats, the 118-118½bpm flip being a fully fledged Megamix of the two songs plus ‘Give Me Soca’, good party fun.\n\nRANDY BROWN ‘Welcome To My Room’ LP (Threeway Records WAY LP1, via Charly)\n\nThis Memphis-rooted but Philadelphia-styled soul set from 1978 has been an underground cult classic ever since (ie: very few people ever bought it), and I challenge all the DJs who listed it in their charts last week as just “Randy Brown LP” to clarify which of its tracks were actually floor fillers for them! Not that it’s bad, just very dated, with probably still useable the gently undulating 91bpm ‘I Wanna Make Love To You’, Marvin Gaye-ish 95-96-97-98bpm ‘Do It Baby’, deeply soulful 33-34⅔bpm ‘I’d Rather Hurt Myself (Than Hurt You)’, others being the Teddy Pendergrass-ish 116-115⅓-116⅓-0bpm ‘Love Is All We Need’, Intruders ‘I’ll Always Love My Mama’-like 120½-119½-118¾-121⅓bpm ‘I’m Always In The Mood’, crawling 44-42¼bpm ‘Too Little In Common’, weaving 59½-61-0-61bpm ‘I Love You Baby’, floating 55½/111-112-113½bpm ‘Sweet, Sweet Darling’.\n\nLOOSE ENDS ‘Ooh, You Make Me Feel’ (Virgin VS 991-12)\n\nNick Martinelli produced and remixed nicely sung but rather insubstantial bright (0-)115¼bpm wriggler without a particularly emphatic beat (in three mixes).\n\nHOKUS POKUS ‘House It Up’ (US Madison Street Records WMSD 1201)\n\nBasic fast 122⅔bpm jittery jack track with digital stuttering title line repetition, in four mixes, strongest by far being the instrumental with its simple ‘Magic Fly’-ish synth line.\n\nJANICE BULLUCK ‘Don’t Start A Fire’ LP (Wilbe Recording Corporation WIL 3003)\n\nJohn Abbey’s Atlanta-based Ichiban Records have just released here through PRT a whole slew of their US-pressed albums, including (on co-producer William Bell’s own label) this current though traditionally soulful set from which the expressively wailed “do ya?” repeating lovely sultrily swaying 111bpm ‘Do You Really Love Me’ and sinuously tripping also 111bpm title track have hit our chart. Last year’s excellent PRINCE PHILLIP MITCHELL ‘Devastation’ (Ichiban ICH 1004) is also out, along with more bluesily southern soul sets by Clarence Carter, Pat Cooley, Artie ‘Blues Boy’ White and Chick Willis.\n\nFORCE M.D’s ‘Touch And Go’ LP (Tommy Boy 254 889-1)\n\nThe high pitched youngsters’ pleasant largely downtempo set has the attractively weaving (0-)94⅚bpm ‘Take Your Love Back’, slinky lush 77/38½bpm ‘Couldn’t Care Less’, jauntily jittering 97bpm ‘Would You Love Me?’, sleazily rolling 94½bpm title track, gently anguished 0-58½/29¼bpm ‘Your Love Drives Me Crazy’, dead slow sweet 0-23-0bpm ‘Sweet Dreams’, jolting 101⅓-0bpm ‘Midnite Lover’, and current 92-0bpm ‘Love Is A House’ hit.\n\nSLAVE ‘Juicy-O’ (Ichiban Records 12-PO2, via PRT)\n\nSolidly thumping 114⅓bpm dated salacious P’funk, fine of its type but outmoded (similar chugging 111¾bpm ‘I Like Your Style’ flip), out here in its US pressing.\n\nBLACK DANCE TOP 100 – September 12, 1987\n\n01 05 PUMP UP THE
