I'm sure there are lots of them.\n\nNot sure about ‘told’, but Jonathan King encouraged the young Genesis to sound like the BeeGees.\n\nRay Parker, Jr. was instructed by someone to imitate Huey Lewis and the News as closely as possible, but I don't remember who.\n\nNobody instructed him to imitate Huey. He plagiarized \"I Wanna New Drug\" to make \"Ghostbusters\".\n\nJust like Huey took ELO’s Sweet Talkin’ Woman to make Do You Believe in Love.\n\nWhat goes around...\n\nHmmm...seems like a bit of a stretch. Love both of those songs tho.\n\nNot sure if they were told to copy someone else exactly, but Cheap Trick's worst years were def guided by the label. Pretty sure they were told to do \"The Flame\" and then told to replicate it at all costs."
