        "text": "Post by johnm1120 on\n\nStemming from a conversation I had with a co-worker earlier today. So we all know that some songs were not recorded by the artist the song was intended for, but became a hit anyway. Sometimes the artist turned it down, sometimes it was the label, or in other times it was recorded, but it either wasn't released, or it didn't do anything. Feel free to post examples.\n\n*This thread is not for \"cover songs\", but more for songs that were either rejected by other artists, or flopped for/didn't get released by another artist, and the latter resulted in a hit.\n\nAdam Lambert - Whataya Want From Me\n\nOriginally co-written and recorded by Pink for her Funhouse album, however the song did not make the cut.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nAir Supply - Making Love Out of Nothing At All\n\nOriginally written for Meat Loaf, however his record label didn't want to pay royalties to Jim Steinman. He took back the song and it became a #2 hit for Air Supply (Bonnie Tyler later recorded it as well).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBonnie Tyler - Total Eclipse of the Heart\n\nOriginally written for Meat Loaf, but like with MLOONAA, his label refused royalites to Steinman, so he gave it to Bonnie. Incidentally, at one point both Steinman songs were #1 and #2 on the Hot 100 simultaneously.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB.O.B. - Nothin' On You & Airplanes\n\nBoth songs written for Lupe Fiasco, but they went to B.O.B. instead. According to reports, the move almost cost Lupe his record deal.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBoy Meets Girl - Waiting For A Star to Fall\n\nOriginally written for Whitney Houston, but Arista rejected the song.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBritney Spears - ...Baby One More Time\n\nOriginally offered to TLC who turned it down, citing they felt it was too immature. The backstreet Boys also reportedly passed on it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBritney Spears - Toxic\n\nOriginally offered to Kylie Minogue who turned it down.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Carpenters - Sing\n\nWritten for the TV Series \"Sesame Street\" Barbra Streisand also recorded the song, which flopped. After hearing the song Karen Carpenter wanted to record it, despite her manager thinking she was crazy for wanting it. Their version reached #3.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCarrie Underwood - Jesus Take The Wheel\n\nOriginally offered to Sara Evans, who thought it was \"stupid.\" The song was then offered to Rascal Flatts, who thought it was more suited for a woman.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCeline Dion - Because You Loved Me^\n\nTurned down by Toni Braxton, who was finishing up her 2nd album, and by Mariah Carey who had already released her album and was focusing on her tour.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCharli XCX - Boom Clap\n\nOriginally written for Hilary Duff, but her management team passed on it. Charli kept the song for herself.\n\nCher - I Found Someone\n\nCo-written by Michael Bolton, the song was originally recorded by Laura Branigan. The song flopped, but became Cher's comeback hit 2 years later.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChristina Aguilera - I Turn To You\n\nRecorded by All-4-One and used for the \"Space Jam\" soundtrack. It was not released as a single. Christina's version went top 5.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGloria Estefan - Heaven's What I Feel\n\nOriginally recorded by Celine Dion for her Let's Talk About Love album, but the song was scrapped as it didn't \"fit\" the album. It became a top 10 AC hit for Gloria Estefan.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Do I Live*\n\nOriginally recorded by LeAnn Rimes for the movie \"Con Air.\" However the film producers thought that Rimes' version was not \"pop\" enough. The song was then recorded by Trisha Yearwood which got to #23 on the Hot 100. Rimes released her version anyway, getting the song to #2 and spending a record 69 weeks in the Hot 100.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFaith Hill - There You'll Be\n\nOriginally offered to Celine Dion. She turned it down fearing it would be labeled as \"My Heart Will Go On Part 2.\" The song later was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJordin Sparks - Battlefield\n\nOriginally offered to Rihanna, who turned it down after the Chris Brown incident.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKelly Clarkson - I Do Not Hook Up\n\nWritten and recorded by Katy Perry, before she broke, however the entire album ended up being scrapped.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKelly Clarkson - Miss Independent\n\nOriginally offered to Christina Aguilera, but at the last minute passed on it. Destiny's Child were also reportedly interested in the song.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKelly Clarkson - Since U Been Gone\n\nPassed on by several female artists, most notably (confirmed) Hilary Duff who didn't think she could reach the high notes.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLady Antebellum - American Honey\n\nOriginally written for Carrie Underwood.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLady Gaga - Telephone\n\nBritney Spears originally recorded a demo of the song, but it was scrapped from her \"Circus\" album.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLeAnn Rimes - Blue\n\nThe song was originally written for Patsy Cline, who had intended to record it before her untimely death in a plane crash. 34 years later, 13-year old LeAnn Rimes became the first singer to record it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLeona Lewis - Bleeding Love\n\nCo-written by Ryan Tedder and Jesse McCartney to be used for Jesse's 3rd album. He recorded the song, but scrapped it thinking it didn't fit the record.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMary J Blige - Rainy Dayz\n\nOriginally meant for TLC's 3D album.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMiranda Lambert - The House That Built Me\n\nOriginally offered to Blake Shelton who was going to record it, but Miranda loved the song so much, he gave it to her.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNatalie Cole - This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)\n\nOriginally offered to Aretha Franklin who turned it down.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrince - I Wanna Be Your Lover\n\nOrignally written for Patrice Rushen\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPussycat Dolls - Don't Cha\n\nRecorded by Tori Alamaze. The single flopped and Tori was dropped from the label. The song was also offered to The Sugababes and to Paris Hilton. Both turned it down.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRihanna - S.O.S.\n\nOriginally offered to Christina Milian. She rejected the song, resulting in a breakthrough for Rihanna, and Christina got \"Say I\" and a pink slip.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRihanna - Umbrella\n\nOriginally written for Britney Spears' \"Blackout\" era, but Jive turned down the song saying she had enough material. Taio Cruz recorded the song, but it didn't get released. Mary J. Blige was offered the song and was interested, but it had already gone to Rihanna.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSantana f/Michelle Branch - The Game of Love\n\nTurned down by Rob Thomas. Feared it would be considered \"Smooth Part 2\" Tina Turner also recorded a version of the song, but it did not get released until 4 years after Michelle's vocals made it a hit.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSelena Gomez - Who Says\n\nOriginally offered to and recorded by Jordin Sparks. However, Selena's version got released first.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSinead O'Connor - Nothing Compares 2 U\n\nOriginally recorded by \"The Family\" in 1985. The song did not get released as a single.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSugar Rush*\n\nThe song was originally recorded by the pop group A-Teens, and was later recorded by Dream Street. Although neither version of the song was officially released as a single, the song led to tension between the two groups.\n\nTaio Cruz - Break Your Heart\n\nTaio wrote the song for Cheryl Cole's solo album, but her label rejected the song. He then kept it for himself.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTaylor Dayne - Love Will Lead You Back\n\nDiane Warren originally wanted Whitney Houston to sing the song, but Clive Davis insisted that Taylor sing it instead.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTaylor Dayne - Send Me A Lover\n\nOriginally recorded by Celine Dion for her 2nd album. It didn't make the cut and the song was offered to Taylor. 4 years later, Celine's version was released to promote the compilation album \"Women For Women 2\" and cracked the AC chart.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Weather Girls - It's Raining Men\n\nTurned down by several divas including Diana Ross and Donna Summer.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nToni Braxton - Another Sad Love Song\n\nOriginally offered to Anita Baker, who turned it down to focus on her pregnancy.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nToni Braxton - How Could An Angel Break My Heart\n\nBabyface originally wrote the song for his own album, but later decided it was more suited for a woman.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nToni Braxton - Un-break My Heart^\n\nOrignally offered to Celine Dion\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVanessa Williams - COlors of the Wind\n\nOriginally turned down by Whitney Houston\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVanessa Williams - Save the Best For Last\n\nThis song was shopped around to several artists including Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhitney Houston - How Will I Know\n\nSong was meant for Janet Jackson.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo Celine Dion and Toni Braxton turned down each other's huge hits. Imagine if they had been recorded as originally intended? (And both are Diane Warren songs!)\n\nThank you for your contributions:\n\n14887fan\n\nAir Jordin\n\nAu$tin\n\nbrightredsongs\n\nCh, r. ïs\n\nchatoyant\n\nDisco Cowboy\n\nificanthaveyou\n\nindulgecountry\n\nInner Visioned\n\njazzysoul47\n\nMack\n\nTypo"
