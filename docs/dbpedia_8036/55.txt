It would be a mighty task to distill the career of Ray Parker, Jr. - singer, songwriter, guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, producer, arranger, and more - into one collection, but Big Break Records has boldly done just that with the enticing anthology entitled For Those Who Like to Groove: The Essential Ray Parker, Jr. and Raydio. The Cherry Red imprint has collected 32 hits and rarities on 2 CDs from the period of 1978-1987, proving there's a whole lot more to the artist than just his chart-topping "Ghostbusters."

A longtime session veteran who had also placed songs with artists from Rufus & Chaka Khan to Nancy Wilson, Parker came into his own as a headlining artist. This set is front-loaded with two of Parker's most blissful grooves opening the set - the tale of "Jack and Jill" (featuring Jerry Knight and Arnell Carmichael), and the even more infectious "You Can't Change That." Both hit songs were recorded by Parker with his vocal group Raydio and established his smooth yet funky, utterly accessible pop-soul style.

Over the course of four albums released between 1978 and 1981 on Arista (all of which are sampled on Disc One), Parker and Raydio lit up the R&B and pop charts with such impeccably-crafted confections as "A Woman Needs Love (Just Like You Do")" which returned to the milieu of "Jack and Jill"; the lustily romantic slow burn of "Two Places at the Same Time;" and the dancefloor instrumental "For Those Who Like to Groove." (Other similarly spirited instrumentals here include "Get Down" and "Still in the Groove.") Compilation producer Wayne Dickson has eschewed a chronological approach, instead favoring a thematic and musical unfolding of Parker's style. Disc One begins with the midtempo, pop-flavored productions before building in tempo and energy to grooves such as "Hot Stuff," "It's Time to Party Now," and "All in the Way You Get Down" (the latter two of which are heard in their 12-inch mixes). "Let's Go All the Way" is an alluringly atmospheric, beguiling cooldown with just a hint of mellow tropical vibes.

Of the numerous gems that didn't score heavily on the charts, a Spinners-style "Rubberband Man" feel graces the uptempo "Honey, I'm Rich." (Ironically, Parker cites that group and song as an inspiration for "You Can't Change That.") Herbie Hancock, then in the throes of his own jazz fusion period, co-authored 1980's sensual "Tonight's the Night." Many songs are presented in alternates to their more familiar album versions, including 1981's driving slab of funk, "It's Your Night," and 1978's raucous, disco-flecked "Is This a Love Thing" in their single versions.

The second disc of For Those Who Like to Groove turns the spotlight onto Parker's solo works, beginning with his immortal, Number One theme to "Ghostbusters." Instead of the popular single version, however, the set includes the 12-inch "Searchin' for the Spirit" remix. This is a bold decision; leaving out the single version might render this otherwise-comprehensive collection less than definitive. But the choice underscores the collector-oriented approach here. The sequence then travels backwards to The Other Woman, Parker's 1982 proper solo debut. Its title track was more rock in approach than anything he had recorded before, and he was promptly rewarded for this change of direction with a top five crossover hit, presented here in its extended 12-inch release. A newfound swagger informed subsequent tracks like the playfully naughty "Bad Boy" (from Parker's Greatest Hits album) and of course, "Ghostbusters," but Parker's sensitive side wasn't ignored, either, with smoldering slow jams like the shimmering "In the Heat of the Night" and the R&B top 3 entry "Let Me Go," which recalls the silken balladry of Teddy Pendergrass and "If You Don't Know Me by Now."

Parker handled the transition into the new sound of the 1980s with grace as evidenced by synth-heavy tracks like "I Still Can't Get Over Loving You" from 1983's Woman Out of Control, the bright ode to "Jamie" from 1984's anthology Chartbusters, and boisterous "Girls Are More Fun," off 1985's Sex and the Single Man. The atypically dark, moody "One Sided Love Affair" from Sex boasted a fine Gene Page arrangement.

That proved to be Parker's final Arista album, but two years later, he returned on the Geffen label with After Dark. One highlight was "After You." The duet with Natalie Cole was written by Parker with Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager, and Parker was understandably excited to compose with the legendary Bacharach. The result was an attractive if understated midtempo ballad. The Bacharach/Sager team had recently written a pair of tunes for Cole's EMI Manhattan album Everlasting, and if "After You" was less distinctive than those, it's enjoyable for the chance to hear the two pros together. (Bacharach, Sager, and Nathan East also penned "Perfect Lovers" for Parker on After Dark.) From the same album, "I Don't Think That Man Should Sleep Alone" (another rare 12-inch mix here) shows how much Bacharach had already seeped into Parker's consciousness; its cooing female background vocals and breezily cool melody are redolent of the maestro's sleek eighties style.

For Those Who Like to Groove tells the Ray Parker, Jr. in text as well as music, thanks to Christian John Wikane's detailed liner notes drawing on a new interview with the artist, as well as via Arista chief Clive Davis' introduction. Nick Robbins has superbly remastered all of the tracks here. Alas, Parker has only recorded two full-length studio albums since After Dark, one in 1991 and another in 2006. But he's remained musically active, and in 2014 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was an appropriate honor for the artist who truly is a star despite having lingered under the radar. The Essential Ray Parker, Jr. isn't just for those who like to groove, but for those who enjoy lighter-than-air melodies, catchy lyrics, and most of all, impeccable musicianship. There's no need to keep searchin' for the spirit; you'll find it right here!
