        "text": "A lot of bands spend their careers cashing in on one song.\n\nYou know the ones. Hell, youâ€™ve probably got a couple in your head right now. They write one insanely catchy track, stick it in the middle of an otherwise-mediocre album, and then tour the hell out of it until they can retire to their mansions in the Californian hills.\n\nSounds pretty sweet, doesnâ€™t it?\n\nYou can swan around the world, playing 40-minute sets to festival audiences who donâ€™t give a damn about your new single, because they know that youâ€™re going to play that song. It doesnâ€™t matter that the people donâ€™t care about anything youâ€™ve done in the last five years. It really doesnâ€™t. You wrote a hit song. Youâ€™re set.\n\nItâ€™s the good life, right?\n\nRight?\n\nWell, we hate to break it to you, but OneRepublic are not one of those bands.\n\nYes, their debut single was, in their own words, â€˜bigger than it should ever have beenâ€™. Yes, their singer has been accused of giving his best songs away to other artists. And yes, the crowd still goes wild when they play Apologize.\n\nNone of that matters, though. At the end of the day, OneRepublic have managed to transform themselves into one of the worldâ€™s best pop bands. Weâ€™re convinced that theyâ€™re going to be one of the worldâ€™s biggest, too. Yes, we know that theyâ€™re pretty big already, but their show at the always-brilliant Apple Music Festival left us convinced that theyâ€™re ready to make the step up to stadiums in the not-too-distant future.\n\nDonâ€™t believe us? Well, let us tell you why.\n\nFor a start, theyâ€™ve got the hits. The band played an hour-and-a-half long set at the Apple Music Festival, and each song was a bona-fide belter. Obviously, theyâ€™ve got the likes of Counting Stars and Love Runs Out up their sleeves, but theyâ€™ve also got three albumsâ€™ worth of arena-ready pop-rock anthems to fall back on, and they made the most of them for their Apple Music Festival show. Youâ€™ll probably know more OneRepublic songs than you think you do, actually â€“ remember this? And this? And this?\n\nYeah, we thought you would.\n\nItâ€™s also really, really hard not to be impressed by their live show.\n\nThereâ€™s just nothing to dislike, really. The setlist was insanely good, the light show was enough to fill a room four times the size of the Roundhouse, and frontman Ryan Tedder is a four-octave-spanning ball of energy.\n\nIndeed, of the whole spectacle, itâ€™s Tedder who stands out; he may be one of the most in-demand songwriters in pop, but heâ€™s also one hell of a live performer, and their set served as perfect proof of this. In fact, weâ€™d even go so far as to say that heâ€™s one of the best frontmen in pop music. Heck, whatâ€™s not to love? Heâ€™s charismatic, heâ€™s likeable, and heâ€™s got one of the best voices in pop music right now:\n\nIn short, you should go and see them"
