        "text": "Interscope in partnership with Ubisoft are set to release Mirage (for Assassin’s Creed Mirage) music by OneRepublic featuring Mishaal Tamer. This is the first time the Assassin’s Creed® franchise collaborates with a top 50 global artist. This aligns with the dedication and effort that has been invested in Assassin’s Creed music over the years, resulting in a Grammy Award this year. The single will be available on September 22.\n\nThe song and lyrics were co-written by Ryan Tedder, songwriter and lead vocalist of the band, who took inspiration from the game. Mirage (for Assassin’s Creed Mirage) also samples some notes from the original soundtrack of Assassin’s Creed Mirage, composed by Brendan Angelides in collaboration with Layth Sidiq, lead vocalist and violinist.\n\n“Most people don’t know this about me, but my band and I are closet gamers. I’ve been a huge fan of Assassin’s Creed since the beginning. Having toured extensively in the Middle East, I wanted to capture the spirit of that region and reflect the location of the game sonically as much as possible. I can’t wait for our fans and fans of AC to hear what we came up with. This was a definite pinch myself moment.” - Ryan Tedder (lead singer)\n\nIn addition, the band brought in an up-and-coming Saudi artist, Mishaal Tamer, who was the opening act for OneRepublic’s Summer European Tour 2023. His style takes inspiration from Arab music from the Levant, Egypt, and the Arabian Gulf, alongside K-pop, Indie rock, and Urban Latino. Both artists’ interest of the Assassin’s Creed franchise transpired in their latest title.\n\n\"To be featured on a song with my musical heroes, OneRepublic that soundtracks my favorite video game, is a dream come true. I am honored to be a part of this special collaboration with OneRepublic and Assassins Creed.” - Mishaal Tamer\n\nPre-save the single here: https://onerepublic.lnk.to/miragepresave\n\nWatch the teaser here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm_BrGu1sHM\n\nThe official album cover for the song is available here: https://www.ubisoft-press.com/download/1190352/9f60d030859b5b852bee1f2d36f0c62e7a5fa1f2\n\nWith development led by Ubisoft Bordeaux*, Assassin’s Creed Mirage is a special game made to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the series.
