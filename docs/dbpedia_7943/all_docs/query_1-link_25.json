        "text": "Friday, April 24, 2015 at the Air Canada Centre, Toronto, ON\n\nSunday night, two days after the concert and I’m already getting hazy on the details of that night. It’s amazing how vivid the memories are right after the concert and how quickly they fade. This is one of the reasons I take pictures and record videos, it gives me the ability to relive those great moments later.\n\nOneRepublic was not the band I was originally planning to see in concert. I did not dislike their music but they were not exactly on the list of bands I’d listen to. Besides, the tickets seemed a bit pricey at the time. Then just weeks before the concert the tickets went on sale on Groupon so I decided to give the band a try (after all the purpose of Groupon is to allow people to try certain products and services at a discounted price). I am certainly glad I did.\n\nOneRepublic is an American pop rock band formed in Colorado in 2002. It consists of Ryan Tedder (lead vocals), Zach Filkins (lead guitar), Drew Brown (rhythm guitar), Brent Kutzie (bass guitar) and Eddie Fisher (drums, percussion).\n\nI must say that these guys play a number of additional instruments and I can write a separate article about that alone, but will spare you the details for now. While the music style of the band can be best described as pop rock, there is a significant variation in the music as OneRepublic draws inspiration from a variety of artists. To date the band released three studio albums: Dreaming Out Loud (2007), Waking Up (2009), and Native (2013).\n\nSince the inception, OneRepublic has done a number of shows in Toronto both in a club setting such as the Kool Haus few years back and in larger venues such as the Molson Amphitheater just last year, when they co-headlined the show with Script.\n\nThe current tour called ‘The Native Tour’ started in 2013 in support of the band’s latest album and continued over many months, extending into 2015 and making its second stop in Toronto this April.\n\nThe concert was held at the Air Canada Centre (ACC), which, in my opinion, is the best venue in Toronto when it comes to medium-large size concerts. ACC primarily serves as a sporting arena and I’m sure excels as such, but it is also a good place to host concerts because it allows for a variety of ways to set up the stage, has good unobstructed view of the stage from any seat, is clean and well-maintained and most importantly for me has great acoustics.\n\nFor the OneRepublic concert the stage was set in the far end of the field, which is the most common arrangement used by artists. Not surprisingly then is that the best view of the stage is from the general admissions section (floor) and 100 bowl sections closest to the stage. Our tickets were in section 122, which was almost directly opposite the stage all the way across the field, but to my surprise the seats were excellent both in terms of the view an in terms of the sound.\n\nThe concert started at 7:30pm with an opening performer called Lights. I unfortunately did not make it to the venue until 8:30pm, so did not get to see her sing. OneRepublic came on stage at 8:45pm with an opening song ‘Don’t Look Down’.\n\nWhen the concert started the stage was hidden behind a large white curtain and during the first song the band stayed behind it, so the audience only saw the shadows of the musicians as they moved about on stage. It’s a neat technique that I have seen used by a number of bands in the past, the most memorable being Coldplay, that allows to amplify the size of the musicians with cleverly positioned lights and introduces a mystery into the show.\n\nFirst song followed by a much awaited ‘Light It Up’ that was even more exciting because the curtain came down and we finally got the see the band and the very beautiful stage they had prepared for the gig. Pictures are better than a thousand words when it comes to describing visual effects, so you can see for yourself. I found the use of overlapping screens to be a nice way to create a variety of effects. It’s certainly not the first time I’ve seen it used, but it never gets boring.\n\nAfter a few songs on the main stage including ‘Something I Need’ the band moved into their acoustic part of the performance on the B-Stage that was set up in the section on the field.\n\nAs Ryan Tedder said, this was a way to create a living room atmosphere and let us all be a part of it. It certainly worked as the performance felt very intimate despite the size of the venue. The highlight song from this part was ‘Apologize’, one of my favorites that has been around since the first album. The use of piano and cello along with beautiful lyrics allows the song to reach straight into the heart. The band also did a fun cover of George Ezra’s ‘Budapest’.\n\nAnother unexpected highlight of the show was a Spanish Guitar medley. It was mesmerizing to watch Zach Filkins pluck the guitar strings with such speed and precision. And apparently while he was entertaining the crowd the rest of the band was preparing another surprise behind the curtain and that surprise was ‘Counting Stars’ that started with a burst of lights and a curtain drop. When I hear high-energy songs like that live I wish I could request a repeat. Why is this never an option in a concert?\n\nMore songs followed including ‘Can’t Stop’ and ‘I Lived’. It was amazing that the entire audience was singing along during ‘I Lived’. That’s the energy that comes from live concerts and stays with you for days – that sense of being in the present and loving the moment.\n\nThe encoure featured OneRepublic’s new song ‘Love Runs Out’. I’ve never heard the song until that night but certainly loved it because of its catchy music and good lyrics.\n\nAt the end there was confetti and lights and the feeling that it’s ending and we don’t want it to end. I loved every moment of it and will not miss another OneRepublic concert. The energy of the band was contagious, they acted as if this is the one and only show they were playing. The visuals were outstanding, way to entertain the ears and the eyes at the same time. What a fantastic way to start the weekend!\n\nCost: $50 for Section 122 (in 100 lower bowl) on Groupon\n\nDuration: 1:50 h"
