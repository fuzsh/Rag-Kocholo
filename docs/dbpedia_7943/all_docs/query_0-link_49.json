        "text": "SINGAPORE – American pop-rock band OneRepublic, Australian pop icon Kylie Minogue and American rocker Lenny Kravitz are among the acts set to perform at the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix 2024.\n\nThe entertainment line-up for the 12 stages spread across the Marina Bay Street Circuit includes K-pop girl group BabyMonster, American R&B veterans Kool & The Gang, British electronic dance music act Disclosure, Irish pop quartet The Corrs, Australian pop singer Tones And I and British DJ duo Honne.\n\nAlso joining the roster are American R&B singer Kelis, American dance-punk stalwart James Murphy, Australian singer Dean Lewis, as well as home-grown artistes such as singer-songwriter Rangga Jones and R&B/funk band Astronauts.\n\nKravitz, who is staging his first concert in Singapore, will perform at the biggest stage, The Padang, in Zone 4 on Sept 22.\n\nOneRepublic, whose new album Artificial Paradise contains an instrumental track titled Singapore, will headline on Sept 20 at The Padang. They have performed in Singapore six times, including two shows in 2023.\n\nMinogue will be making a return to The Padang on Sept 21.
