        "text": "OneRepublic just released its fourth album on Friday, Oct. 7 titled “Oh My My” and it’s still number one on the iTunes chart. The album is all about living life to the fullest and enjoying the little moments, which is an applaudable message. Even if you’re not a huge fan of OneRepublic, you’ll still be dancing to at least one of the 16 songs on this album.\n\nSome probably remember when OneRepublic’s first hit song “Apologize” hit the radio about ten years ago. It was the song that put everyone into their feels and the song everyone was singing left and right. Four hit albums later they’re still producing legendary songs like “Secrets” and “All the Right Moves,” and they’re still making soon-to-be memorable songs like “Future Looks Good” and “Kids” on the new album.\n\n“Future Looks Good” is all about remembering the good times you had throughout your life because memories are better than pictures. This relates to “Kids,” which expresses the importance of being young at heart.\n\nOneRepublic fans have always asked for slow beautiful songs, and so they were excited for this album. Unfortunately, “Oh My My” failed to produce any ballads. It’s not something they are known for, which may be why the album didn’t have any.\n\nAt first glance, 16 songs on an album is a lot compared to most albums that usually have between 9-12. But because they haven’t produced any music for three years, 16 songs is OneRepublic’s way of making up for it.\n\nSome might say the band has had no growth in difference of sound from its old music compared to this newest release. Every artist is known for his or her unique sound that is carried throughout albums; it’s what makes them who they are and what makes them standout from other artists. OneRepublic’s sound is classified an American pop rock; they are recognized for catchy hipster pop anthem songs.\n\nOverall the album deserves 3 out of 5 stars because even though it is a repeat of the band’s old sound, the new songs are still interesting. The album might take a couple of replays to fully appreciate the music, but whether or not you’re a huge fan, you can’t deny that at least one of the songs off “Oh My My” will be playing on repeat. You’ll probably catch yourself dancing and singing along to the lyrics. Who knows, maybe you’ll become their new biggest fan."
