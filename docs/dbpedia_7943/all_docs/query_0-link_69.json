        "text": "Thursday night’s American Idol results show is sure to be a, ahem, smash as season five runner-up Katharine McPhee returns to the Fox show for a special performance with OneRepublic.\n\nMcPhee will lend guest vocals to the group’s latest single, “If I Lose Myself,” which appears on OneRepublic’s new album, Native (out March 26).\n\nPHOTOS: THR’s Hitmakers 2013: The Creative Minds Behind Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and Flo Rida’s Biggest Singles\n\nIt’s McPhee’s second collaboration with the band’s frontman Ryan Tedder. The two shared screen time last season on an episode of NBC’s Smash, which featured the song “Touch Me,” written specifically for the series star and Idol alum.\n\nIn fact, Tedder is becoming somewhat of an Idol MVP, having penned and produced songs for Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and Jordin Sparks.\n\nPHOTOS: Adam Lambert: A Retrospective in Pictures\n\nThe band’s Idol appearance is one of three major TV bookings the week of release. Among them: Good Morning America on Tuesday and Rachael Ray on Friday.\n\nAlso appearing on Thursday night’s Idol is season 11 favorite Colton Dixon, who told The Hollywood Reporter last week that he wants to shake Keith Urban‘s hand when he returns. “It’s coming up so fast,” Dixon said.\n\nIndeed, tune in March 28 for all the musical action."
