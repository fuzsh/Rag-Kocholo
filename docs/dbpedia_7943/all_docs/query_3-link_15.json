Not only are we expecting fresh 1R sounds this album also includes high profile collaborations.\n\nThe collaborations will include Santigold, Peter Gabriel and Cassius. This will be the first time we’ve heard the band collaborate with other artists, and we can’t wait to hear them.\n\nUpcoming performances\n\nThe One Republic lads are due to perform ‘Kids’ on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday, September 12th. They’ve already been confirmed to perform at the Apple Music Festival in London on September 21st followed by the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Vegas on September 23rd.\n\nHere’s a few of our favourite Ryan Tedder songs that you’d never have guessed he’s co-written\n\n‘Burn’ – Ellie Goulding\n\n‘Halo’ – Beyoncé\n\n‘Maps’ – Maroon 5\n\n‘Neon Lights’ – Demi Lovato\n\n‘Seasons’ – Olly Murs"
