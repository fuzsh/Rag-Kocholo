        "text": "OneRepublic architect Ryan Tedder is among those at the absolute pinnacle of pop/rock singer/songwriters. You can tell it just from the company he keeps — McCartney, Taylor Swift, Adele. From his many collaborative adventures, he tells the best story I've ever heard in music.\n\nThe short version, that doesn't do it justice, is he was writing with Bono of U2. There was a knock on the door from someone who worked with Bono to tell the U2 frontman he had a call. Bono said, \"I'm working, I'll call them back.\" The assistant implored Bono to take the call. So finally, Bono asks, \"Who is it?\" The voice on the other side of the door answers, \"The Pope.\" Bono looks at Tedder and says, \"I better take this.\"\n\nYou don't get to be in the room for moments like that unless you belong there. OneRepublic's superb new album, Human, shows why Tedder is at the top of every major artists' wish list of collaborators. A masterful collection of songs that covers an array of emotions, styles and tempos, it shows an artist reaching his creative peak.\n\nBut interestingly, speaking to Tedder for my Who I Am column, turns out that as someone who used to draw he is just as influenced by painters, from Jackson Pollock to Jean-Michel Basquiat as he is by the Beatles. \"I drew non-stop as a kid, and as a teenager. I thought I was gonna be a cartoonist for a number of years,\" he says.\n\nI spoke to him about the new album, mystery, art and much more. This is Ryan Tedder, Who I Am.\n\nSteve Baltin: The song that really jumped out at me at first was \" Didn't I.\" There's a very old romantic quality of that song like '70s songs such as \"Operator,\" by Jim Croce, and \"Martha,\" by Tom Waits. When there was a sense of mystery in calling someone and trying to reconnect.\n\nRyan Tedder: Exactly, you're 100 percent right yeah. The relative that really got me into songwriting was my cousin in Connecticut, who learned guitar when we were 11, and his favorite artist in the world was Jim Croce, and he only had a record player, so he would just play Jim Croce on loop. So I have some very sentimental associations with Jim.\n\nBaltin: I think about this often, and there's an air of mystery that's missing because everything is now on social media where it's all so blatant.\n\nTedder: One hundred percent, dude. When I got into the music industry it was, \"Be as mysterious as possible.\" I used to get lectured by our early management on talk less during shows, don't be so engaging, don't engage the audience. And now it's completely the reverse. It's like, \"Wait, you don't live on TikTok? How do you even have a career?\" It's completely inverted, it's really a bizarre time. I'm happy that millions of people have figured out how to make a living off social media, I know there's a lot of people that would probably be doing jobs that they loathe, nine to five punch-in, punch out. But they somehow tapped into social media, and now they're actually just literally filming themselves living and they're monetizing it. I'm all for that, that's great, but I'm still not convinced that the world is better off. I think if it disappeared tomorrow we'd probably be better off.\n\nBaltin: One of the other songs I love on this record, was \"Savior.\" To be able to say, \"It's hard for me to put myself out there in this way,\" I think it shows such a growth in songwriting. Were there moments on this record that as you began writing it, you were surprised by how vulnerable the record got?\n\nTedder: Yeah, I would say that's definitely one of the peak moments on the album in terms of vulnerability. I've just had it hammered into me so many times from my manager, people, fans, that people in general react to songs that are almost painfully vulnerable and it gets a lot harder, the older you get, to tap into that same raw nerve. And the reason why so many artists usually after album two fall off, I honestly believe, is that album one was all their life leading up to that point. Album two is six months after the success of album one, and what fans discount so often, \"Why is this one album great, and the other one sucks/\" It's not because the artist sucks, it's because they had an entire lifetime of living heartbreak, raw nerves, you name it, leading up to their first album, and then you're accidentally successful. I'm pretty sure Lady Gaga knew she was gonna be huge, there's a few artists like that, but the other 99.9 percent of us, I was convinced that One Republic was not going to work to be quite honest, I was totally convinced. And so when it did it caught me by such surprise. And then I blinked, and the label was like, \"We need another album in the next six to eight months, how is it coming along?\" And I was like, \"Well, I haven't even started it.\" \"Well, you better get going.\" And I remember sitting in the studio going, \"Oh my God, what do I write about? What have I experienced? What topics have I not covered yet? I better cover them.\" And then now apply that to album three, four, and you can see the subsequent albums get harder and harder to arrive at a genuinely unique concept that is vulnerable, real, authentic and something you haven't covered before. And that becomes problematic because if you write as many songs as I do, you cover so many topics and so many just, even song titles that I've already used.\n\nBaltin: Who are those artists and writers for you that really inspire you in consistently putting out that vulnerability?\n\nTedder: Some writers I know have this indefatigable ability to always tap into a raw nerve or a true human experience and then just throw it out there. Taylor [Swift] is one of those people. She is on every time I ever went in with her. She just had a grab bag of, \"Oh, I had this idea last night, I had this idea last night, I had this idea yesterday.\" And it's just endless. And also, there's a degree of confidence that certain writers and artists have, and I would like to think that I step in and out of that confidence, I don't live in it. When it comes to OneRepublic, I definitely don't live there. Here's a simple way for me to say it. Some writers or artists always have unlimited access to that raw nerve, and they're able to touch it at all times, and yes, I'm surprised by some of the stuff that people actually write about, but that's the stuff that people love. \"Someone Like You,\" [Adele] played me the original version of that, what she wrote on guitar actually, funny enough. And it's just as good as the piano version, it's shockingly good.\n\nKeith Haring, Radiant Baby\n\nI've been a Keith Haring fan since I was like 10, 11 probably. And I discovered the artwork on the Red Hot + Dance album, which was the AIDS benefit album. It had George Michael, it had a bunch of different interesting acts on it. Anyway, Keith Haring, he described that once he landed on that, that became one of his most iconic images. A lot of my inspiration comes from street art and has for probably the last 10, 12 years. He described the Radiant Baby as the purest and most positive experience of human existence. He does a lot of risqué art or did. A lot of sexual theme stuffs and a lot of social commentary stuff in his drawings and his street art, but he landed on the Radiant Baby. He's living in New York in the early '80s as AIDS is exploding, and he's living in the gay scene, and the purity and the innocence of a young baby, I think it was inspiring to him because he just kept coming back to it on so many different pieces. And so I ended up luckily buying a piece right after I bought my studio. I was wearing this hoodie that was a collaboration between the Keith Haring Foundation and Noah, the clothing company out of New York. And it had this drawing on it that I was just obsessed with, this black and white drawing. And then out of nowhere, one of my friends in New York who knew that I was a Keith Haring fan sends me an original drawing, black ink on paper, that was kind of a poster sized. I'd already bought one or two Keith Harings from him. And he's like, \"Hey, I think this is the original drawing that's on your hoodie.\" And sure as hell, it was. And so I ended up getting that. So the first thing you see when you walk in my studio is the Radiant Baby.\n\nBasquiat, Charles the First\n\nThat's one of his more famous works. This stuff is outrageously expensive at this point, obviously. But I just think Basquiat was just super inspiring as a person. To me, what's inspiring about that piece of work, this piece of art has his iconic crown in it. Similar to the Radiant Baby that to me was Keith Haring's was Basquiat's crown, which is tied to him indelibly. And that's one of the first pieces to have it. To me, what makes that inspiring is at the time, and still to this day, many, many people look at that and go, \"How is that art? That's random, vertical color stripes with random drawings and kind of almost like hieroglyphs.\" And it begs the question like, \"Define art.\" Art is what makes you happy. Art is what you think is cool. Art is what inspires you. Art is what provides catharsis for you. And it's to each his own, and the street art movement in the late '70s and early '80s really highlighted that.\n\nJackson Pollock\n\nHe might have been one of the first people to do that. There's so many people that were dismissive of his art. Actually he is the other person on the list so I'll just rope into that. From Basquiat to Pollock. I read his history, seen the documentaries, I don't have the kind of money that I can tie up in a Jackson Pollock. But if I was gonna go crazy on a piece of art, it'd definitely be his. 'Cause while he was making it, you had 100 times more people scratching their head going, \"What the hell is this?\" You had people going, \"This is incredible. This is art. This is amazing.\"Again, it's another thing that highlights the notion that art is subjective, not objective. It's not empirical. It's whatever level of value, inherent value you assign to it, it means that to you and you alone, period. Whether it's monetarily or intrinsically or aesthetically. It's another case of one man's trash is another man's treasure. And for me, the first time I saw a Jackson Pollock painting, I was probably a little kid. I was like, \"What is that?\" I'm sitting here studying all these brilliant artists, Monet, Renoir, Degas, Picasso, back to Da Vinci and all the masters of the Renaissance and they're all gorgeous and amazing. And I've been to the Louvre and I've seen a lot of these... I've been in a lot of different museums and seen a lot of crazy, priceless works of art and I love them and I think they're amazing. I love rebels, and I love that this guy comes up in the '40s and '50s, splatters a bunch of paint on a canvas but does it with intent. And he has a laser-minded focus. And I kind of laugh when I think about the idea of Da Vinci looking at a Pollock and just going, \"Wait, what?\" 'Cause whatever Italian is for \"Wait, what?\" That's exactly what he'd be saying. And I love that, I love disruptors. And Pollock is nothing if not a disruptor.\n\nMartin Wong\n\nChinese-American guy, came from San Fran. He's an artist, that's the best way for me to put it. Street artists at the time loved him. Street artists that are alive today are all reverential to Martin Wong. And he was referred to as the \"Human Instamatic\" because he was constantly taking photos of street art and cataloguing them. And he actually established the Museum of American Graffiti in the late '80s and donated pieces that he had gotten for free or paid, bought directly from the artist. For minimal, next to nothing, like crazy Keith Harings and a bunch of other pieces. And yeah, he's kind of a big inspiration for a lot of modern day street artists like Brian Connelly, KAWS, and some of the other lesser known street artists that are trying to make a living out there. I bought a piece from his Artlong Estate called No Smoking 'cause I just love the irony. I own a studio and he did a whole series called \"Sign language\". If you type in 'Martin Wong, 'Sign Language,\" it'll pull up images of his art and you get an idea for how just completely different it is. And I bought a piece called No Smoking and it's hung right in my studio, studio A that I work in most of the time. And of course, everyone's like, \"What is that?\" every single time, \"What does that say?\" I sit there and I go, \"Guys, it's sign language, read the hands, read the fingers,\" and then almost nobody gets it, but once they do, of course, once I tell them, obviously they get the irony. I got a lot of expensive equipment in here, please don't smoke.\n\nBaltin: How do you see the disruptors influence your music?\n\nTedder: I didn't go to music school or art school. And the first hit that we had, late 2000s, that first decade. I was just trying to make stuff that I wanted to hear. Fundamentally, I just wanted to make up what I wanted to hear. And I wanted to have hits, but thankfully I had enough naivete at that time that I wasn't studying really what was happening at the time. I was listening to music. I was not trying to duplicate or replicate what was popular at the time, I was just trying to do my own thing. And I'm just the amalgamation of a white kid raised in Oklahoma, mostly on gospel music, who worshipped Top 40 radio when he was allowed to listen to it finally, and then got signed by Timbaland right as he was ushering in the Missy Elliott, JT, Nelly Furtado era, his kind of explosive era that he had. It's such a weird mishmash of influences that I had personally. I worshipped British rock music, and the whole hip-hop scene from the '90s. Oasis and Blur, and I mean, there pretty much isn't an English band that I didn't listen to from the mid to late '90s. And you have a guy who's listened to a lot of British music, who's signed to a hip-hop producer, and if you combine those two things, you have \"Apologize.\"\n\n\"Hallelujah,\" Leonard Cohen\n\nIt's in everybody's top 10 songs of all time, supposedly took 16 years to write, Leonard Cohen. I have \"Hallelujah\" as a piece of art tattooed on my left arm, right above the waves of Kanagawa, which is my other big tattoo, and the reason I got it I think it was in Pittsburgh after a show, we all got tattoos. I got it to remind me every time I pick up a guitar or look down, I still haven't written anything as good as \"Hallelujah.\" So that's inspiration via humility.\n\n\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" the Beatles\n\nSo I for a long time been collecting pieces of art and old manuscripts. I've got ledgers, kind of banking ledgers from the Medicis, from the 1400s, up to letters from Napoleon and George Washington, and the original lyrics to \"My Country 'Tis of Thee.\" So in keeping with that, hanging right outside my studio A door, I have the lyrics to \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" the original lyrics. Again, I like to put reminders, they keep you humble and that's another one of them. Beatles, as generic as it sounds, one of my all-time favorite bands, I've had the honor to work with [Paul] McCartney on his two albums, Egypt Station and got to spend a lot of time with him at his studio in England and out here in LA. And I've been a Beatles fanatic since I was a teenager and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" is great. Specifically, it's a George Harrison record. He didn't have a lot of hits that he wrote, right? But this is one of those particular songs that he did and it resonated with everybody. And this is a reminder that you can't write all the hits,you likely will not be the greatest writer that ever lived, but as long as you keep swinging, eventually, you're gonna connect one. And that's kind of my homage, those lyrics are the homage to that sentiment. The most important thing is that you get up and you keep swinging. I saw a statistic the other day that Kobe and LeBron are in the top 10 of all time missed shots. The reason obviously is because they took the most shots. And so for me, it's just like, \"Get up, keep writing.\"\n\nJiro, Japanese Sushi Chef\n\nWhen that documentary [Jiro Dreams Of Sushi] came out, I probably watched it 15 to 20 times. I probably told 500 people to watch it. I'll say I love sushi and I love Japanese culture and everything Japanese. But I thought the most remarkable thing was at age 90, I think was 93 or 94, in the documentary he says to the camera, \"I still haven't mastered it yet. I'm still trying to make the perfect sushi. I get close, but I don't think I've nailed it.\" And I was just floored by that idea. I do interviews sometimes, and I've had people say, \"What's it feel like you've mastered the art of songwriting?\" And I'd be, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's impossible. First of all, that's just impossible because music is so subjective and to me, \"I don't think I've written the perfect song.\" I don't think I've written the perfect song and I don't know what that looks like.\" Maybe \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\" \"Happy Birthday\" [laughter]. There are those certain songs that resonate and stand the test of time for decades and decades and decades."
