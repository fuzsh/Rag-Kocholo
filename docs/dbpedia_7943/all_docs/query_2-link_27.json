        "text": "I have always found pop and rock to be the top best genres to have been created. While both genres sound similar, pop is like the softer version of alternative while rock has a tougher, rowdier sound. Some artists have fused pop with rock in their music. Out of all of them, one of my all time favorite bands is OneRepublic.OneRepublic is an American pop-rock band formed by lead singer and songwriter Ryan Tedder, lead guitarist Zach Filkins, drummer Drew Brown, drummer Eddie Fisher, and lead bass guitarist Brent Kutzle. Their most current album is Native, released on March 26, 2013 in the United States. Most, if not all, people have heard some or all songs from Native by now. It is the band’s first album to hit the top ten on the Billboard 200.\n\nTheir album cover is said to represent each of the band members based on their different personalities. For example, Ryan stated in an interview for radio.com that he feels it is like a bunch of aninals that do not belong together, which helps depict how OneRepublic’s five members are so different yet so connected by their music. Ryan is the fox while the others are a bison, cougar, antelope, and an owl. Ryan also added that even though they are American, their music does not sound American which has helped their success in other countries such as the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia.\n\nTheir first single from Native was “Feel Again” on August 27, 2012. When “Feel Again” was released the album had yet to be named. Ryan Tedder wrote and produced the song along with Brent Kutzle, Drew Brown, and Noel Zancanella. During this time OneRepublic stated that their third album (Native) was to be released soon. However, they later said that they did not want to rush it via Twitter. Some of the proceeds from the sale of the single were donated to “Save The Children’s Every Beat Matters” campaign to support training health workers in the world. Their second single was “If I Lose Myself” on January 8, 2013. Ryan told Billboard that “If I Lose Myself” was about his fear for going down in an airplane and panicking while having your life flash before your eyes. Their third single “Counting Stars” came out on June 14, 2013, which has been their most successful single from the album. Their fourth, fifth, and sixth singles were “Something I Need”, “Love Runs Out”, and “I Lived”, respectively.\n\nDuring the band’s beginnings, they were signed on to Columbia Records while they were about to release their first album. However, Columbia Records dropped OneRepublic two months before the release of their first album. Ryan Tedder said that MySpace deserves credit for keeping the band together together this time. After the incident the band starting attracting other music labels. It finally signed with Timbaland’s Money Music Group to release their first album. Interscope Records has since been their record label.\n\nBefore Native, Ryan Tedder tended to avoid adding a bit of his personal experiences into the songs he wrote for the band. However, when he was working on Native he chose to put a bit of himself into it, which contributed to them taking longer than they planned to to release Native. According to Tedder, his biggest annoyance is when a band is just too cool for its own good. He explained in an interview with radio.com: “You look at their lyrics and I can quickly tell, because I’ve been writing my whole life, like those are like a string of non sequiturs that sound cool. It means absolutely nothing.” I must say that I completely agree with Tedder’s statement. Songs you usually hear on the radio nowadays are things like “Anaconda – Nicki Minaj” or “Bang Bang – Jesse J, Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj”, and to me it is utter nonsense.\n\nTedder added that artists like Bono and The Beatles have hits that have a deeper meaning and he wanted to do the same with his music. While writing for Native he stepped “up his game and stop putting up walls. He realized if he was going to write a song people could relate to he would have to share a little bit of himself. But only a little”. Native’s sixth single, “I Lived” was written as Tedder’s love letter to his newborn son. In addition, the song titled “Preacher” is an autobiographical tale about his grandfather who formed part of a church and is a counselor now. Furthermore, Native’s second single “If I Lose Myself” was inspired by Swedish House Mafia’s tempo.\n\nOneRepublic would not be what it is without Ryan Tedder in my opinion. When he was 21, he competed in a singer-songwriter competition and was chosen to perform in a one-hour special on MTV. His performance had been the most popular which won him the competition. However, he was not given a contract with a recording label because according to Tedder “it was all a hype”. A year later Tedder caught Timbaland’s attention (Timbaland is a hip-hop producer). Tedder began developing himself as an artist with Timbaland’s help. Tedder released one of the songs he wrote, “Apologize”, with OneRepublic ft. Timbaland and it became OneRepublic’s first hit. This song had 10, 331 spins in its first week. Tedder has written/co-written songs for many more artists like Leona Lewis (“Bleeding Love”), Jordan Sparks (“Battlefield”), Ellie Goulding (“Burn”), Beyonce (“Halo”), Adele (“Rumour Has It”), Kelly Clarkson (“If I Can’t Have You”), and many more.\n\nNative has had such huge success that OneRepublic went on the Native Tour and it is ther largest tour to date. They recently released a new cover album for it, going from clashing colors to darkly toned grays and browns.\n\nOneRepublic is pretty successful at the moment. I love their music so much that I woke up at 3am during the summer (2014) to go see their morning performance with the TODAY show. I was thrilled. One of the things that best distinguishes OneRepublic from current artists is that when they perform, they really are singing and not just lip-syncing. Their performance at the TODAY show was no exception to that. They really get into the music and sing the best they can without the help of the recording studio’s editing equipment. Moreover, they always like to interact with the fans. Don’t be surprised if you see Ryan Tedder jumping off stage to take a group selfie with the fans. I eagerly await what else OneRepublic has up their sleeve.\n\nNow just fast forward to 1:20 and enjoy OneRepublic (Songs; Secrets, Apologize, Good Life, Counting Stars)."
