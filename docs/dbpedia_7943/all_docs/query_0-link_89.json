        "text": "Written by Susie Salva\n\nOneRepublic’s new third full-length album “Native” on Interscope Records features sounds from the many countries that the band traveled to before carving their nitch from the sites and sounds they discovered in Paris, Greece, London, New York, Seattle and Vancouver. The different countries they visited allowed the band to immerse themselves in and explore different cultures, vibes, and incredible life time experiences that ended up rounding out this incredible album that is peppered throughout this Grammy winning band.\n\nLead singer/songwriter/keyboardist and GRAMMY winner Ryan Tedder’s own Patriot Studios in Denver, is where OneRepublic (whose 2007 smash, “Apologize” ranks in the top 50 on the Billboard Hot 100’s All-Time Top Songs List) redefined their approach and their follow up record 2009’s Waking Up ended up offering a surge in stadium sized rock that’s fiercely beat-driven yet ethereal and intimate.\n\nOneRepublic has a grip on how they want to present their material to their clamoring fan base and never disappoint. Their music is very organic and accessible their approach to rhythm and infused the high powered rock-pop hybrid with elements of electronic music, gospel, blues, and folk is ever present on this third breakout disc.\n\n“Native,” is the perfect title for this third disc as they combine songs that occurred to interweave the above features that carve out an important 12-track disc that demands to be heard.\n\nOneRepublic dynamic lead singer Ryan Tedder though he has an independent career as songwriter and producer for various artists is still centered and sought out by some of the biggest names in rock-pop genre. He really sinks his claws into the bands individualized sound and never disappoints. “There’s this crazy juxtaposition happening on the album,” says Tedder, whose bandmates include Zach Filkins (guitar), Drew Brown (guitar), Brent Kutzle (bass, cello), and Eddie Fisher (drums). “On the one hand we tiptoed into the EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and brought in that energy, drive and tempo, but on the other hand it’s got a lot of acoustic guitar more organic feel.”\n\nThese new songs on “Native” are about mortality, love, hope and emotional, desperation, faith, failure — the hole gamut of human emotion,” explains Tedder. “We try to give the lyrics a certain gravity without being preachy, and make the kind of music that connects with people not just a party or club on Saturday night.”\n\nThe disc kicks starts off weaving together folk, gospel, and pop-rock on “Counting Stars,” describes the desire to be with that one special someone and where hope is an four letter word and dreams do come true. The song begins with tenderly strummed acoustic guitar before bursting into a soaring, shimming epic featuring guest vocals by Bobbie Gordon (When we were at RAK studio in London) she just walked in and she knocked out those vocals\n\nand changed the whole song\n\n.\n\n“If I Lose Myself,” is convoluted ode with the piano interlude striking up their clever use of EDM dealing with finding that perfect someone. Even when the band is dealing with darker themes in this song, “Native” maintains a majestic atmosphere as the song relentlessly builds and bursts its shining melodies and and dance floor ready rhythms disguising the song’s somewhat morbid subject matter…”It sounds like a epic dance record, but in reality it’s about me going down in a plane crash,” explains Tedder. (a self-confessed aerophobe who admits that even though he flies all over constantly there’s a few minutes on every flight where he is convinced it’s all over.)\n\n“Feel Again” the band blends gospel-style melodies, strong melodies, driving beats, huge hearted and lyrics redemption and renewal the song is both instantly catchy and intensely moving. Featured on the NOW That’s What I Call Music\n\nNo. 45 the song features the heartbeats of Guatemalan children which were recorded by the band as part of their work with Save the Children ( an international children’s rights organization to which OneRepublic is donating proceeds from the single’s sales).\n\n“What You Want,” deals with that relationship where one lover would do anything for the love they share together where tribal beats and EDM intersect with each other. “Can’t Stop,” weaves together industrial music and flashes of Prince and rock vibes were you can’t go on living without the other person.\n\nOne of the strongest songs on the album and worthy of being a second single is “Burning Bridges,” a pop-rock track were Tedder describes the desiring to have all his bridges torn down. “Something I Need,” again is a nod to their gospel influence where he pines away for his partner stating “If you only live once I want to die with you. You’re what I need.” This glides into that second to the last song on the disc “Preacher.” Tedder brings forth his own background with the church and family members that had profound impact on his life. Using their signature string section and putting forth the desire to do as a Preacher puts forth that God only helps those that help themselves. A great way to close out this CD. Finally the etherial “Don’t Look Down,” which is primarily instrumental song that closes out at 1:37 minutes.\n\nAnother key factor in shaping OneRepublic’s newly refined sound, writing, and recording in faraway places were crucial to opening up their sonic possibilities. “Because we’re traveling all the time, we’ve make our albums all over the place, and what naturally is we end up taking on some vibe of whatever we happen to be at that time,”says Tedder.\n\nFreshness is infinitely essential to OneRepublic, who foremost aspire to make “Native” a very modern record, a snapshot of life in 2013,” according to Tedder. “It’s so important to us that every album be an evolution, where we make these huge lateral movements with out sound and then from where we write a bunch of great songs,” he continues, “It’s definitely a mother of a process, but it’s really the only way for us.”"
