The band is set to perform live on 2nd May at CR Shenzhen Bay Sports Center Arena.\n\nTickets to OneRepublic Live in Shenzhen 2018 start from RMB 480 and will go on sale at Damai.cn and via Damai ticket hotline 1010-3721 on March 9th.

With more than 10 million units of \"Counting Stars\" sold, the song's video has racked up more than 2 billion hits on YouTube and now stands as one of the site's top 20 most viewed videos of all time.\n\nAbout OneRepublic\n\nFrom track to track, OneRepublic - which features lead vocalist Ryan Tedder, bassist Brent Kutzle, guitarists Zach Filkins and Drew Brown, and drummer Eddie Fisher - parallel the extraordinary scope of the album's creation by blending alt-rock, gospel, synth-pop, nu-disco, and folk. With its abundance of sweeping, stadium-ready anthems, Oh My My, their latest album, shapes those eclectic elements into songs built on both masterfully expansive arrangements and bravely intimate lyrics.\n\nUnabashed emotion and indelible melody have always propelled the music of OneRepublic, who released their first full-length Dreaming Out Loud in 2007. That album included the Colorado Springs-bred band's debut single \"Apologize\" - a Grammy Award-nominated, multi-platinum-selling track that long held the distinction of being the biggest radio airplay hit in the history of Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 chart. OneRepublic next followed Dreaming Out Loud with Waking Up, a 2009 album that produced three singles: \"All the Right Moves,\" \"Secrets,\" and \"Good Life.\"\n\nThe release of Native followed in 2013 and featured the hit singles \"If I Lose Myself,\" \"Love Runs Out,\" \"I Lived,\" and \"Counting Stars.\" The latest offering from OneRepublic's spirited foray into video-making, \"Kids,\" was shot in Mexico City in the midst of the band's global travels. Sweetly romantic and undeniably feel-good, the video captures such sites as the Angel of Independence and the Monument to the Revolution all in a stunning single take.\n\nAs Oh My My made its debut, OneRepublic set their sights on another journey across the globe. With extensive touring in the future, the band looks forward to bringing even more new music back to the very places where it first came to life.\n\nAmerican Pop-rock Band OneRepublic World Tour Live in Shenzhen\n\nDate: Wednesday, May 2nd, 2018\n\nTime: 19:30\n\nVenue: CR Shenzhen Bay Sports Center Arena\n\nTickets: RMB 480/680/980/1280\n\nDamai.cn and via Damai ticket hotline 1010-3721\n\nAbout Live Nation Ltd\n\nLive Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world's leading live entertainment company comprised of four market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, Live Nation Media & Sponsorship and Artist Nation Management.
