        "text": "01\n\nof 10\n\n\"Apologize\" (2007)\n\n\"Apologize\" was initially released by OneRepublic as a single online via the social media community MySpace. However, after signing the band to his label in the wake of the group being dropped by Columbia, Timbaland remixed the song and released it under his name featuring OneRepublic. His new mix added more percussion, new backing vocals, and sound effects. The remix appears on Timbaland's album \"Shock Value.\"\n\n\"Apologize\" took off and became a massive international hit peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and ultimately selling over five million copies. It temporarily set the North American record for the most radio plays in one week. \"Apologize\" also remained in the top 10 on the U.S. pop chart for 25 weeks, the longest run since Santana's \"Smooth\" featuring Rob Thomas in 1999. OneRepublic earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Performance By a Duo or Group with Vocals. \"Apologize\" became the 10th single to sell more than five million digital downloads in the US. The song was also a significant international hit reaching #1 in countries around the world.\n\nWatch Video\n\nBuy From Amazon\n\n02\n\nof 10\n\n\"Counting Stars\" (2013)\n\nThis OneRepublic single from the album \"Native\" incorporates elements of the briefly popular trend to merge folk music elements with mainstream pop. It blends those elements with a dance-pop beat structure. The first singles from \"Native\" were only minor hits. \"Counting Stars\" first became a hit in Europe and its success slowly spread around the rest of the world. It topped both mainstream pop and adult pop radio charts in the U.S. and peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Counting Stars\" was a massive international pop hit hitting #1 in the U.K., Canada, and Brazil.\n\nRyan Tedder began writing \"Counting Stars\" while he was waiting for Beyonce to appear at a recording session. He debated whether he should share it with the star, but he decided it wasn't a suitable song for her. Instead, he took it home and worked on it while finishing other songs for the \"Native\" album. Ryan Tedder was pleased with \"Counting Stars\" being an uplifting song about faith and hope instead of the conventional pop song topics of sex, love, and money.\n\nThe music video for \"Counting Stars\" depicts OneRepublic performing in a building in New Orleans, Louisiana. A religious service is taking place in the room above the band, and by the end of the video, the floor collapses and everyone falls through the ceiling. It has been watched for than two billion times making it one of the twenty most-watched music videos of all time.\n\nWatch Video\n\nBuy From Amazon\n\n03\n\nof 10\n\n\"Good Life\" (2010)\n\nOneRepublic's \"Good Life\" caught the public's attention with its relentlessly upbeat nature. The song's incorporation of whistling inspired \"Rolling Stone\" to list it as one of the top whistling songs of all time. Released as the third single from the album \"Waking Up,\" the commercial success of \"Good Life\" was slow in coming. It ultimately reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 nearly two years after its initial release and peaked at #1 on the adult pop radio chart and #2 on the adult contemporary radio chart. The inclusion of \"Good Life\" on trailers for films like \"Eat Pray Love\" and advertising for TV shows including \"Gossip Girl,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" and \"Cougar Town\" helped boost the song's visibility. Ultimately, \"Good Life\" sold more than three million copies.\n\nEthan Lader, who worked on Bruno Mars' \"Just the Way You Are,\" directed the accompanying music video. It includes cameo appearances by multiple well-known actors including Nicolas Cage, Cate Blanchett, and Anne Hathaway. It was filmed on location in West Hills, California. To help boost the song, OneRepublic recorded different radio versions of \"Good Life\" featuring call-outs in the lyrics for specific cities and states. The band released an official remix featuring rapper B.o.B.\n\nWatch Video\n\nBuy From Amazon\n\n04\n\nof 10\n\n\"Love Runs Out\" (2014)\n\n\"Love Runs Out\" was released as the first single from OneRepublic's reissue of their album \"Native.\" An intense percussive beat reminiscent of Ryan Tedder's work on Adele's \"Rumour Has It\" drives the song. Reportedly, \"Love Runs Out\" was intended to be the first single from the initial release of \"Native,\" but Ryan Tedder could not finish writing the chorus in time.\n\n\"Love Runs Out\" peaked at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top 10 at adult pop and mainstream pop radio. It did even better on the pop charts in both Canada and the U.K. peaking in the top 5 in both countries. The re-release of \"Native\" took place in April 2014, over a year after the collection's initial release. It expanded the album from 12 to 15 tracks including the new single \"Love Runs Out\" and a dance remix of \"If I Lose Myself.\"\n\nSophie Muller, a veteran music video director, known for her work with Eurythmics, Beyonce, Sade, and many others, directed the video for \"Love Runs Out.\" It bears visual similarities to Sade's \"Soldier of Love\" music video directed by Sophie Muller.\n\nWatch Video\n\nBuy From Amazon\n\n05\n\nof 10\n\n\"All the Right Moves\" (2009)\n\nLeading off the album \"Waking Up\" as the first single, \"All the Right Moves\" moves forward propelled by a rhythm track reminiscent of drum and bass dance music. Ryan Tedder acknowledged that OneRepublic had performed the song many times live before releasing the recorded version which he claimed was a \"different animal\" than what the fans heard live. The song climbed into the top 10 on the adult pop radio chart and peaked just inside the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100.
