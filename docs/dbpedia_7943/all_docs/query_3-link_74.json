        "text": "With credits ranging from Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, to Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande, not to mention a near-20 year stint as frontman of multi-billion-streams band OneRepublic, Ryan Tedder is perhaps the most revered songwriter in pop. The 42-year-old, three-time Grammy winner caught his break working with Timbaland 20 years ago and has since gone on to fundamentally shape contemporary music, penning mega-hits including OneRepublic’s “Apologise”, Leona Lewis’ “Bleeding Love”, Beyoncé’s “Halo” and Adele’s “Rumour Has It”. Tedder has also racked up production credits with the likes of u2, Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry to name but a few, so it’s little wonder he sold a majority stake of his music catalogue to the tune of around $200 million last year.\n\nTedder’s vision reaches beyond songwriting and production, too, as someone who says he “never got into music for the money”. As well as his hemp-extract beverage brand, Mad Tasty, which he launched in 2018, Tedder says he owns “a ton of commercial real estate, like office buildings”, plus he recently launched his own NFT line in collaboration with street artist Bustart, and has been a judge on NBC’s reality TV show Songland.\n\nLast summer, OneRepublic released their fifth album, Human, the band’s first since 2016, after a slate of pandemic-related pushbacks. GQ spoke to Tedder while he was in London promoting the album, taking us back to his beginnings to reminisce on everything from the school teacher who inspired him and the first show he ever played, to his first life-changing paycheque and the pieces of advice he lives by.\n\nThe first time you realised you wanted to be a musician…\n\nThis is so random, but it was thanks to a Ben Folds Five album in the late 90s, when I was 14. I discovered bands in the early 90s; obviously Nirvana and Pearl Jam. I really fell in love with Oasis and the whole Mancunian scene, any act from Manchester I was obsessed with. I had thought \"it would be cool to be in a band\", but I really didn't take it seriously, [even though] I'd played piano since I was three. I worship Peter Gabriel and I thought what he did was incredible, but that for some reason didn't speak to me. Then [there was] Ben Folds, this guy that was just on a piano, doing these crazy songs. For some reason, the fact that he was singing and playing piano which is what I did, and he has a quirky voice, whereas I thought I had a decent voice, made me think, well, “if he can do it, I can do it”.\n\nThe first live show you ever played…\n\nThe first time I ever played in front of people was on MTV on TRL in 1999 or 2000. I won a record deal and it was the first time I'd actually been in front of an audience playing a song I'd written. It was one of those “find the next star” things. Everyone else was doing covers and I did an original; I ended up winning. You can see it on YouTube. It was a very bad Baby Face-sounding song. Very bad. It's so, so cheesy.\n\nThe first song you ever wrote…\n\nThe first song I ever wrote was about this one girl, who I won't name in the event that she finds out, but I do know who it was. I wrote a very sappy love poetry song over piano chords. I remember thinking, “I just wrote a song, wow!”\n\nThe first time you made money out of music…\n\nIt was 2003. I was doing mostly hip-hop when I started in the early 2000s and I'd made a little money from music here and there, like this guy would fly me to Toronto to produce for his kid and he'd pay me four or five grand. It was weird, though, that guy would give me envelopes of cash, and it was okay, but the first real cheque I got was for song-writing. It was a month after I moved to LA and I got a cheque for a song that I wrote on a Bubba Sparks album called “Deliverance”, I co-wrote it and I'm singing on the song. I got $7500 because it ended up in the movie Without a Paddle and that licensing paid for my rent for half a year.\n\nThe first time you blew a paycheque on something frivolous…\n\nBefore that, I thought the only way to make money writing songs was that you write the songs and get commission. I didn't understand the construct of it, that there's this whole other thing called producing, where you get a guaranteed amount of money, plus the songwriting publishing. So I did the song for one of Timbaland’s artists called Kalka. This was May 2004, I'll never forget it. My girlfriend at the time was graduating from university and I got the $10,000 cheque the week that I was flying out for her graduation in Colorado.\n\nWhen you don't come from money, which I don't, and you're broke, which I was, you're being evicted, which I was, and you get $10,000, it changed everything. It felt like a million dollars. I'm pretty sure it changed my posture. After the graduation, we went to this college bar. I was used to LA where beers cost $9 and martinis are $15, but here the most expensive drink on the menu was $3. The most drunk I've ever been was actually this night. I got to this point where I just go, “you know what? These drinks are ridiculously cheap.” I stood up in the bar and yelled, \"next round on me, for the next 30 minutes any drink you order is on me\". I thought it would cost me about $1000, this bar probably had 45 to 50 people in it and for 30 minutes they drank. My bill was 260 bucks. That was it!\n\nThe first time you got any really amazing advice…\n\nIt was from my grandfather, before he passed away. I remember sitting down with him, he was probably 82 and I was 14. He said, \"I have one piece of advice for you. You need to find something that you would do 40 hours a week for free. That is what you make your job”. It’s phenomenal advice, no matter what anybody says, or what your life circumstances.\n\nThe second piece had to do with when you do make money. It was from Michael Jackson's old manager, who only managed him for about three or four years during the early 80s, he's an attorney… I was 20. I was visiting LA and I was pursuing music at this point, I’d won a record deal on MTV and was going to move to the city. I walk into his house by the Beverly Hills Hotel, it's my first time ever being in a mansion, so I’m going gaga, and he says to me “want a house like this one day?”. I said, “Oh, man, who wouldn't?”. He goes, ”Every dollar you make in music, or whatever it is that you're doing, you need to put it into real estate. Buy apartment buildings that you would want to live in or offices that you'd want to work in, in cities that you'd want to be. It's that simple.”\n\nThe first thing you’d do as president…\n\nI've thought about this so many times and it's twofold. Number one, on a global scale, I would instantly reaffirm the US's status as a massive climate activist nation. To whom much is given, much is expected... Secondly, I would go and sit with every single senator and representative individually, every day over the course of the year, and I would do my absolute damnedest to create a government that is not incessantly and forever, completely 50/50 divided on every issue, because it is the dumbest thing of all time. I've always said that if I could start a political party, it would be called The Pragmatist. Just be pragmatic, be centrist.\n\nOneRepublic's Human is out now.\n\nNOW READ\n\nMark Ronson and Audemars Piguet are a match made in watch heaven\n\nGerard Way knows that people miss guitar music\n\nSnoop Dogg: ‘I always wanted a song with me and Jay-Z together on a Pharrell beat’"
