She was inspired by the \"ridiculous, unrelatable, unattainable opulence\" that runs through such albums as Kanye West and Jay-Z's Watch the Throne and Lana Del Rey's Born To Die.\n\nTime In A BottleJim Croce\n\nJim Croce was killed in a plane crash on September 30, 1973. A few weeks later, his song \"Time In A Bottle\" hit #1.\n\nWonderful TonightEric Clapton\n\nEric Clapton wrote \"Wonderful Tonight\" while waiting for his girlfriend, Pattie Boyd, to get ready for a night out. By the time she was ready, he had written the song.\n\nQuicksandBritney Spears\n\nBefore she was famous, Lady Gaga was a staff songwriter, and wrote the song \"Quicksand,\" which Britney Spears recorded in 2008.\n\nAmenKid Rock\n\nKid Rock performed his song \"Amen\" at Barack Obama's inaugural, but claims he didn't vote for him.\n\nLou Gramm - \"Waiting For A Girl Like You\"They're Playing My Song\n\nGramm co-wrote this gorgeous ballad and delivered an inspired vocal, but the song was the beginning of the end of his time with Foreigner.\n\nThe PoliceFact or Fiction\n\nDo their first three albums have French titles? Is \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\" really meaningless? See if you can tell in this Fact or Fiction.\n\nTim McIlrath of Rise AgainstSongwriter Interviews\n\nRise Against frontman Tim McIlrath explains the meanings behind some of their biggest songs and names the sci-fi books that have influenced him."
