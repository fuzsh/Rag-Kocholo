        "text": "OneRepublic’s latest single ‘Better Days’ is jammed with enough buoyant energy to get you through the ongoing challenges.\n\nNot that every piece of music coming out at this point is supposed to pull you out of this collective jam but it’s worth noting that OneRepublic has always excelled in producing lively, upbeat and immensely dynamic tracks. Their leader singer Ryan Tedder is one of the finest songwriters of his generation, having lent his abilities to the likes of Beyonce, Adele, and Taylor Swift. His catchy hooks and production capabilities have helped those artists swiftly climb up the charts and garner acclaim, recognition and worldwide fanfare from all across the board. But his individual prowess still hasn’t made him the household name he clearly deserves to be, but that doesn’t mean he is going to work any less hard for his band.\n\n‘Better Days’ is brimming with light gospel touches in the chorus but most of the verses flow through familiar pop territory. Tedder’s vocals are as affective as ever, steadily guiding us through the lived-in lyrics that detail memories just as well as they offer promise. The central hook of the composition is bolstered by a sharp but soothing guitar riff that’s just loud enough to keep our attention. The verses instead make use of higher tempos, with a spirited percussive arrangement keeping the lines running quick and tight, so much so that we’re already at the chorus before we can truly mull over what’s being reflected in the verses. The references to California imply that the subject matter has certainly been inspired by the band members’ own experiences, but the words are open enough to provide us with enough solace regardless of our own specific challenges.\n\n‘Better Days’ counts as the fourth single from the band’s upcoming album Human. This marks OneRepublic’s fifth studio album and is scheduled to be released on May 8, 2020. But when you think about it, OneRepublic has been blessing our ears with their emotionally-driven, instrumentally-complex sound for a long time. They’ve mastered collaborations, they’ve mastered singles, and their pop tunes remain as pristine and memorable as ever. Here is hoping they knock the latest album out of the park just as well.\n\nPop-rock Alt-rock"
