His 2023 releases, including “Baby Don’t Hurt Me” with pop sensations Anne-Marie and Coi Leray, have collectively amassed more than 700 million plays. Following the huge success of “I’m Good (Blue)”, his collaboration with Bebe Rexha earned Guetta an eleventh Grammy nomination in the category of ‘Best Dance/Electronic Music Recording’. With a staggering 2.7 billion global plays and topping the charts in 11 countries, Guetta’s influence skyrocketed, claiming the top spot on both the Top 40 and U.S. dance radio charts.\n\nOneRepublic, consisting of lead vocalist and songwriter Ryan Tedder, guitarists Zach Filkins and Drew Brown, keyboardist Brian Willett, bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, and drummer Eddie Fisher, made their mark with their 2007 debut album, “Dreaming Out Loud,” which included the chart-topping hit “Apologize.” Their 2013 single, “Counting Stars,” has over 4 billion views on YouTube to date, reinforcing the band’s record-breaking success with over 5 billion plays on Spotify. His latest album, “Human”, released in 2021, spawned hits such as “Someday”, “Run”, “Somebody To Love”, “Wanted”, “Didn’t I”, “Better Days” and “Rescue Me”, amassing more than 2.5 billion global plays. To close out the year 2023, OneRepublic delighted fans with the Christmas-themed release “Dear Santa.”\n\nPrevious releases such as “Runaway” and “Mirage” (featured in the video game “Assassin’s Creed Mirage”) preceded the blockbuster “I Ain’t Worried,” contributing to the band’s impressive 3 billion plays.\n\nOneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, an acclaimed songwriter and producer with three Grammy Awards, recently collaborated with Beyoncé on “II Most Wanted” from her album “COWBOY CARTER,” showcasing his versatility. Tedder’s extensive resume includes collaborations with Tate McRae, Taylor Swift, Adele, Justin Timberlake, Karol G, Ed Sheeran, BLACKPINK, U2, among others.\n\nDavid Guetta’s global dominance on Spotify exceeds 42 billion plays and worldwide album sales of 50 million. His achievements include being crowned the world’s best DJ three times by the prestigious DJ Mag Top 100 and achieving iTunes chart success in over 113 countries. Guetta’s recent achievements include winning ‘Dance Song of the Year’ at the iHeartRadio Music Awards for “I’m Good” and multiple awards such as ‘DJ of the Year’ at the NRJ Music Awards and ‘Producer of the Year’ at the Brits, solidifying his status as an industry titan."
