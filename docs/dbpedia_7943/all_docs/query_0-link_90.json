        "text": "Christian Lamb examines the synchronicity between man and nature, in his brilliant promo for One Republic.\n\nDuring shooting, Lamb found himself and his production team fleeing eight locations across three states because of the California wildfires, before Google Earth landed them at Washington state’s Ruby Beach and Hoh Rainforest.\n\nShot with OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder and dancers Matthew Gibbs and Courtney Scarr, the video reflects two halves of one mind. Matthew’s movements are technical and methodical, whilst Courtney’s are free flowing and intuitive, echoing both the song’s lyrics and their surroundings.\n\nThe striking landscapes and breathtaking performances encapsulate the haunting energy of the track, which was composed as a soundtrack for new Disney+ film Clouds.\n\n“The Pacific Northwest always felt right,” says Christian Lamb. “We just needed a little luck.”"
