        "text": "OneRepublic have introduced themselves to the UK with the mega-hit 'Apologize', which has wriggled its way up the charts, blocked only in its merry march by Leona 'Bleeding Love' Lewis. However, according to singer-songwriter Ryan Tedder - the writer of Miss Lewis' aforementioned chart topper - OneRepublic have no plans to be just a one-hit wonder. Tedder shot to fame at the age of 21 when he was selected by N'Sync's Lance Bass and MTV viewers to be awarded a record contract. Although he never released a solo album, he went on to write hits for the likes of Natasha Bedingfield and Jennifer Lopez, got tutoring from Timbaland and is now intent on taking his band to the top of the charts. DS caught up with Tedder to chat about 'Apologize', the band's forthcoming album and how he feels being a 'MySpace sensation'.\n\nHere in the UK we've only just started to hear about OneRepublic. How would you describe yourself to the uninitiated?\n\n\"We're definitely a rock band that has an obsession with pop melodies. That's probably the best summation of what we are. It's ironic because we are definitely influenced by a lot of the older British pop-rock bands. A lot of the guys in the band are big fans of people like Travis and Doves. I grew up listening to the Beatles and the Beach Boys. So we are definitely rock-orientated and a rock band, but melodically I love big accessible, sing-alongs. I'm a sucker for them.\"\n\nYour single 'Apologize' really has become a giant hit. What was the inspiration for the song?\n\n\"I wrote 'Apologize' a few years ago at my dad's house. It has two meanings. On a small and more specific meaning, basically I was summarising all my relationships in my life up until that point. I would get the girl and then I would always get dropped like a bad habit. I was the nice guy and you know what they say - nice guys always finish last. And I was definitely finishing last. But then without fail all the different women that I would date ended up coming back to me. The girls would have always gone from dating someone nice like me to a total asshole. So after three or four months of dating other people they'd end up coming back to me. They'd call me or write me a letter and try to get back with me. They'd say, 'Sorry that I ditched you. Sorry that I didn't value our relationship. Would you consider getting back with me?' That happened about two or three times in row and about the fourth time I got sick of it. I was sick of being taken advantage of and being treated like this. So that song came about from those experiences. So on the last occasion I pretty much told the girl, 'Look, it's too late to apologise. I appreciate your sincerity but it's too late.' Then the second meaning, which I intended to be understood by everybody, was just too have some self respect and put your foot down. To know when enough is enough.\"\n\nHow did Timbaland come to work on the remix of the song?\n\n\"I've known Timbaland for six or seven years from working with him as a solo artist. The deal didn't work with him a solo artist but I learned a lot from him with my time in the studio and I kept a good relationship with him. The band got signed and dropped by Columbia records a year and a half ago. When they dropped us, we blew up on MySpace out of nowhere. So then all these record labels came after us and Timba was amongst them. We had about five labels to choose from and at the end of the day we realised that Timbaland was on fire, and that Interscope and Polydor were the two strongest labels in the States - so we went where we thought we had the best shot.\n\n\"Timbaland then re-mixed the song and told us that he thought the song was a hit with or without him. But then he said, 'If you let me put this song on my album, it will speed the process up. You guys have been through a lot. You've spent years and years going up and down.' We were very reluctant at first to the idea of a remix because we are a rock band. We're not hard rock but we are a rock band. So to have our song remixed and made so much more pop, we were very reluctant. But then we were like, 'If this opens the door and allows more people to hear our album, it gives us the opportunity to let them hear our other songs. I think we can win them over.' Sometimes in life when good things happen, you have got to just shut up and go with it. So that's what we did.\"\n\nWhat can fans expect from your album, if they have only heard 'Apologize'?\n\n\"It's actually very connected. If people like 'Apologize', or love 'Apologize' then they'll love the rest of the album. I'm the songwriter on the rest of the album, so, a) it comes from the same perspective and b), melodically, the overall feel and sound of it is the same throughout the album. It's melancholy but hopeful at the same time. That's the sound of the rest of the record.\"\n\nWill you be playing live in the UK anytime soon?\n\n\"Absolutely. Actually I'm pretty sure we'll be coming back in February and doing some shows then. So that will be great.\"\n\n'Stop and Stare' is being touted as your next single. Do you think it will be as big a hit?\n\n\"'Stop and Stare' is probably one of the most rock-orientated songs on the album. It still connects with 'Apologize' though. The thing that connects all the songs is the melodies. All the melodies are very universal and relatively simple. So if you listen to 'Stop and Stare' a couple of times, you'll find yourself singing it, and that's what we were going for. The bands and the songs that have influenced us are the ones that connect with the most people. Those universal songs and records. The only difference between 'Apologize' and the rest of the album is if you've only heard the Timbaland version and like the beats. But if you like the lyrics, melody and the rest of the song, you'll like the rest of the album.\"\n\nAre you worried about becoming a one-hit wonder?\n\n\"We're definitely not a one-hit wonder band. It's not a fluke. I've been writing too many songs for too many years to put out a band that gets lucky one time. It's not even about luck. This song connected with thousands of people on MySpace way before anyone heard it on radio. We definitely plan on following up 'Apologize' with a strong song and I don't even think it's the best song on the record. We've got songs on the album that have never been posted on the internet that we all feel very strongly about as a band. So I'm excited to get to the rest of the record. I'm pleased with what Timbaland has done in speeding up the process but obviously it's critical that the next song and the one after identify us as a band apart from Tim and as OneRepublic.\""
