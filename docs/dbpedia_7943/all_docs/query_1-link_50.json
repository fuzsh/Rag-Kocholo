        "text": "In its biggest production to date, Pappy & Harriet's was the backdrop Friday night for a special show by Grammy-nominated pop rock band OneRepublic.\n\n\"This is one of the coolest, most random events that we've ever done!\" band frontman Ryan Tedder said to the 1,100 fans who packed the patio of the Pioneertown venue.\n\nThe concert capped off a program OneRepublic announced in October, in collaboration with Enterprise Rent-A-Car, called \"Share the code. Hit the road.\" It celebrated those who do good things for others.\n\nDespite the amount of fans there, not one ticket was sold and there was a catch to getting in.\n\nFans who entered the program on a designated website had to share the story of someone special, a friend or relative, who performs random acts of kindness.\n\nBased on those stories, OneRepublic's nonprofit, the Good Life Foundation, rewarded a select amount of entrants with codes that could be redeemed for tickets to Friday night's concert. Those people were also given three additional \"pay it forward\" codes that they could then pass on to others who would redeem them for tickets and receive additional \"pay it forward\" codes that they could then pass on and so on and so on.\n\nIn preparation for Friday's show, Pappy & Harriet's had a large stage equipped with a professional lighting system and video wall built over its patio, as well as a VIP viewing platform.\n\nOneRepublic fans from Alaska, British Columbia, Maine and even some from as far away as Australia and New Zealand screamed out when Tedder asked people in the crowd where they were from.\n\nJosh Homme: Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme speaks on music's influence on children\n\nJazz festival: Oscars producer behind jazz festival celebrating music 'integral' to Palm Springs history\n\nPatricia Bowden of Greensboro, N.C. was one of the fans who received a code. She flew across the country with her friend, Susan Landreth.\n\n\"We came all the way from North Carolina, just to hear OneRepublic,\" Bowden said. \"As soon as I saw (the program online), I clicked on it and wrote a story about my husband. We were in and were going and then I told my husband, 'Maybe it should be a girlfriend trip.' I'm 65, so I'm (OneRepublic's) senior citizen fan.\"\n\nSinger-songwriter Jamie N Commons opened the night with a half-hour set of Americana-meets-the-blues songs, including his haunting 2013 tune \"Lead Me Home,\" which was featured on the AMC television series \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\nDressed in country-western attire, Commons, who's from Bristol, England, talked with fans between songs. Speaking in an obvious British accent, he joked that he was \" \"trying to confuse everyone with this outfit.\"\n\nOneRepublic kicked off its 90-minute set with the 2005 song \"Stop and Stare,\" followed by \"Secrets\" and \"Kids.\"\n\nWhile trying to get the audience to loudly sing the \"oh oh ohs\" of one of the group's songs, Tedder said, \"This is a small crowd, but it works.\"\n\nForgoing an encore, the group closed the show with its hit songs \"Counting Stars\" and \"If I Lose Myself.\"\n\nLater this month OneRepublic will release a new album, \"Human.\" It will include recent songs \"Rescue Me\" and \"Wanted.\"\n\nTedder announced onstage that OneRepublic will be touring America and Europe in 2020 and the opening act for the shows will be \"crazy.\"\n\nDesert Sun reporter Brian Blueskye covers arts and entertainment.
