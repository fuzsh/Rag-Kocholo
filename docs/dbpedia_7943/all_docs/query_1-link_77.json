        "text": "Author’s Note: First of all, this is my first post on The Centipede. I’d like to thank Alex for the opportunity to write here and I hope I’m able to entertain, inform, and share some fun opinions and critiques with our dear readers in the future. Okay. End the award show pablum, on to the actual article.\n\nOne of the most frequent criticisms leveled at today’s popular music is that it all sounds the same. This is not necessarily true and it’s a lazy criticism made my people who don’t care enough to come up with anything more in depth.\n\nWhat is true, however, is that most hit songs you hear are written and produced by the same elite group of people. These songwriter-producers tend to be smart enough to vary their output enough to avoid sounding completely samey, but they’ve got it down to a science: write a catchy sure-to-be hit song, find a suitable performer, sell it, produce it, and get a nice paycheck out of it when it rockets into the top ten after relentless record company promotion. You probably don’t know most of their names, but they’re essentially the Gatekeepers of Popular Music.\n\nMax Martin is behind a pile of hits by a variety of artists, as is frequent collaborator Shellback. Dr. Luke is essentially responsible for a large part of the success of Katy Perry and Kesha, and has his own network of songwriters. While Bruno Mars is famous and successful in his own right for his music, he also works as a third of the writing and production group The Smeezingtons, which has produced a number of hits (though they’ve focused more on Bruno’s career in recent years). Jeff Bhasker has a pile of hits to his name, including his co-production role on much of Kanye West’s work. Despite his recent revival, Pharrell Williams has been more successful as a producer than a performer in recent years. Heck, Macklemore’s producer (Ryan Lewis) gets equal billing in the album title. And this doesn’t even count the guys like Zedd, Calvin Harris, and Avicii who release their own albums of songs they’ve written and produced performed by others. Essentially, any song by a big-name pop musician – Katy Perry, Rihanna, Bruno Mars, Maroon 5, Miley Cyrus, hell, even Taylor Swift these days – has a big name producer behind it.\n\nSo your favorite pop songs are all being written and produced by the same people. Whatever. They don’t all sound the same, right? I mean, sure, a lot of them have certain aspects that they share, but the beats and arrangements and melodies are different.\n\n…well, usually. And that leads me to the point of this article, in which writers and producers get lazy, write the same song ten times, and get a nice cash in. Most producers avoid this route, but there’s one big name producer out there who doesn’t, and his name is Ryan Tedder.\n\nRyan Tedder is probably best known to the music-buying public as the frontman of OneRepublic, the world’s most boring pop group, and the folks behind such hits as Apologize (which ironically wasn’t produced by Tedder and only became a hit after Timbaland remixed it), Secrets, All the Right Moves, and most recently, Counting Stars. Tedder himself has written all of these hits and produced most of them as well. He’s also an in-demand songwriter and producer for other artists who has worked with the likes of Beyonce, Kelly Clarkson, and Adele, among many others. He’s also the gentleman behind Leona Lewis’s megahit Bleeding Love, which, along with All the Right Moves, is probably the best example of all of Tedder’s trademark production tactics.\n\nTedder specializes in slower, soft rock songs and pop anthems. The tunes he writes are usually mid-tempo with soaring choruses, and his production work favors piano melodies and sweeping strings to augment said choruses (which is part of the reason why Counting Stars, an uptempo driving rock song, was such a pleasant surprise). Tedder is also fond of pounding drum beats in his songs, even where they’re hilariously out of place (listen, for example, to his production work on Gavin DeGraw’s Not Over You, a piano-based tune about loneliness and regret over a pounding beat that sounds like it’s played by Animal from the Muppets).\n\nOkay, so Ryan Tedder isn’t the most versatile songwriter-producer in the world. Whatever. All producers have their trademarks. And after all, is it really a bad thing if a song comes on the radio and you can immediately tell it’s a Ryan Tedder production job? It’s branding! Or something!\n\n…well, I could probably get past it if on several occasions, Tedder hadn’t completely self-plagiarized. This first came up in 2009, when Already Gone, written and produced by Tedder, became a hit for Kelly Clarkson. Immediately, many took notice of the song’s similarities with Halo, which was released by Beyonce the previous year, also written and produced by Tedder. Among those who noticed were Clarkson herself, who both publicly and privately accused Tedder of lifting Halo’s arrangement and using it again on Already Gone, and tried in vain to get it removed from her album to avoid the inevitable accusations of musical thievery. Tedder, for his part, denied these accusations “hurtful and absurd” (wah) and even cited the fact that the lyrics to each song are different (really). All of this came at a time when yet another Tedder track – Battlefield by Jordin Sparks – was also charting, and while that song did not share the obvious arrangement similarities, it was another song in the same spirit, and the chorus didn’t sound much different either.\n\nSo are Halo and Already Gone the same song? Well, yeah, kinda. At the very least, it’s certainly not absurd to say that they share a lot in common. The vocal melodies are different, but the arrangements are similar, as the Harvard Opportunities demonstrate for us. That said, Kelly REALLY should’ve saved her ire for another song that came out a few months after Already Gone: Secrets, the second single off OneRepublic’s second album, and indeed written, produced, and performed by Ryan Tedder.\n\nWhere Halo was similar to Already Gone, Secrets was exactly the same, and I mean exactly. The only difference is the vocal melody and the key. The string arrangements are virtually identical. the backing track on the chorus is basically a carbon copy, as is driven home by this mashup by an enterprising Youtuber (though I wish they would’ve put them in the same key)…\n\nThis goes beyond a borrowed chord progression a la Boulevard of Broken Dreams/Wonderwall. That happens all the time, and there are only so many chord progressions in the world that sound good in a pop song, so I have no complaints about that. When you can sing the vocal melody of one song over the other and the arrangement is basically the same, it’s kinda self-plagiarism. At best, it’s lazy. At worst, it’s not giving a damn about your work as long as you get that paycheck.\n\nOkay, you say, because you’re contrarian. So he wrote a couple songs once that are pretty similar. If you went through the catalogue of most artists, you could probably find some similar sounding songs too! It only happened once!\n\nTo the contrary, dear reader. The most recent example of Tedder Teddering himself might be even more egregious. Back in 2011, Tedder worked with Adele – she said one of the things she liked was that you could always tell when you hear a Ryan Tedder song, so hey, some people like that – and they came up with the track Rumour Has It, which was eventually released as 21’s final single. It’s got some of the Tedder trademarks, but it’s a pounding bluesy song, a bit of a change of pace – and a welcome one, I’d argue.\n\nWell, three years later, OneRepublic came out with a new album, and for its second single, Tedder essentially rewrote and re-released Rumour Has It in the form of Love Runs Out.\n\nAgain, aside from the vocal melody and the key, pretty much everything about these two songs is the same. The drum beat is the same. The ooh-ing background singers are nearly the same. Both even have a similar bridge section. Love Runs Out has a piano where Rumour Has It doesn’t feature it as prominently, but that’s about it. Since OneRepublic released their song as a single, no less than four different Rumour Has It/Love Runs Out mashups have popped up on Youtube.\n\nThe guy has to know, right? I mean, it’s pretty obvious to me, so he has to know too. At least this time he was smart enough to wait a few years so they’re not both on Top 40 radio at the same time.\n\nThere’s nothing particularly wrong with Tedder’s production. I find many of his songs boring and uninspired, but boring, uninspired, and a near-direct copy of something else that the same person already did is something I cannot accept, and Tedder has tried that trick more than once. At best, it’s lazy. At worst, it’s a blatant cash-in. And given that my biggest beef with popular music is an emphasis on molding performers into an image that will make a bunch of suits as much money as possible as opposed to actual artistic value, I do not take too kindly to Ryan Tedder – a songwriter, producer, and musician with his own band who could probably get away with taking a few risks and pushing the people he works with – lazily following the Tedder-By-Numbers formula with everything he does. (And just listen to what happens when you combine his production work with Maroon 5, the ultimate example of “sell our souls for hits and cash at the expense of any sort of good music whatsoever” – quite possibly the worst piece of “music” Maroon 5 have ever released).\n\nSince we’re talking about writer-producers who have made a career out of being musicians, we can contrast Tedder with the aforementioned Bruno Mars, who, in addition to being a wildly successful pop star, makes up a third of the also successful writer-producer team The Smeezingtons. You can kind of tell a Smeezingtons tune when you hear it, even if Bruno isn’t on it, although the vast majority of the non-Bruno songs they produce have Bruno singing the hook. The one notable tune that doesn’t is Cee-Lo Green’s immortal Fuck You, which remains one of the finest songs of the 21st Century to date. (If you think I’m kidding, you are wrong.) They all sound as if they came from the same producer. They have a similar sound and a similar ethos, which is fine. But they’re all demonstrably different songs (although now that I think about it, Millionaire and The Lazy Song sound a bit similar…). That’s the point here. If you’re a high profile music producer, it’s probably a good thing that you have a signature sound – a trademark, if you will. You can pull this off without directly rewriting the same song three times. Heck, Tedder’s done it before. And to his credit, he’s branched out into some other areas lately, producing a few club-oriented songs (they’re not good, but hey, we’re trying to give him the benefit of the doubt here).\n\nBut I still don’t excuse blatant lack of imagination and ingenuity. In short, while it’s true that a small parcel of producers are responsible for most of the big pop hits, Ryan Tedder takes samey to a new level and is not above directly copying himself to get another song on the radio. Sorry, Ryan. I don’t have a ton of respect for that."
