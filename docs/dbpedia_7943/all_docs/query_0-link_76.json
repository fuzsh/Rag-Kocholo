Independence Day weekend, OneRepublic brings its R&B-tinged pop-rock on Sunday, July 4. \"All the Right Moves\" (in all the wrong places) is both the mantra and the Top 40 song for this Colorado-based band, one of Rolling Stone's \"Artists to Watch.\" OneRepublic frontman, Ryan Tedder, has written chart-topping songs for Beyoncé (\"Halo\"), Kelly Clarkson (\"Already Gone\"), and Leona Lewis (\"Bleeding Love\"), but it's his group's multi-platinum single \"Apologize\" that garnered the \"most popular download in American history\" distinction. On Tuesday, July 20, Wynonna brings a voice as big as her long-running career for a night filled with more than just her tried-and-true country singles. Dabbling in everything from roots rock, gospel and adult contemporary pop to folk and Southern R&B, this celebrated songstress counts more than 10 million albums sold, 6 platinum-plus/gold-plus albums, 16 Top Ten hits, a Top Female Vocalist Of The Year Award from the Academy of Country Music among her many accolades. \"No One Else on Earth\" can rock the Deer Valley Resort hillside quite like \"Wy.\" Mr. Blue-Eyed Soul himself, Michael McDonald, will unleash his husky, soulful baritone for an unforgettable evening on Sunday, August 8. This Grammy Award-winning, gold and platinum-selling R&B/soul singer and songwriter whose roots with the Doobie Brothers cemented his place in the annals of rock 'n' roll history is a soulful, stylish and graceful veteran musician, famous for standards like \"What a Fool Believes\" and \"Sweet Freedom.\" On Friday, August 20, get ready for a \"Mighty, Mighty\" good time as Earth Wind & Fire bring their notoriously elaborate and dynamic stage show to Deer Valley Resort's Snow Park Outdoor Amphitheater. \"One of the tightest bands in funk\" (All Music Guide), this Grammy Award-winning '70s super band incorporates jazz, smooth soul, gospel, pop, rock 'n' roll, psychedelia, blues, folk, African music and disco into an evening destined to be a \"Shining Star.\" Hot on the heels of Golden Globe and Oscar wins for the critically-acclaimed film \"Crazy Heart,\" husky-voiced, bull-ridin' Ryan Bingham returns to Park City on Labor Day  Monday, Sept. 6. Bingham will be joined by yet-to-be-announced special artists. New this year: The Reserved Punch Pass Ever wondered what it would be like to be a show sponsor?
