        "text": "#10: “Come Home” feat. Sara Bareilles\n\nDreaming Out Loud (2007)\n\nWritten by lead singer Ryan Tedder about a friend who was at the time serving overseas with the American troops, this gentle ballad really touches the depths of the soul. Charting on the Billboard Hot 100 and appearing on episodes of Gossip Girl and The Vampire Diaries, to name a few, the song reminds us of the longing we feel for friends and family that are separated from us to due to circumstances beyond our control. With backing vocals from an angelic Sara Bareilles, the song’s sombre lyrics are a real tearjerker when you’re feeling blue.\n\n#9: “Something I Need”\n\nNative (2013)\n\nThis upbeat song features some of the band’s most romantic lyrics and a music video to match reflects the cheerful vibe of One Republic’s 2014 album. The hilarious, but eye opening video showcases a man whose only obstacle between him and the woman of his dreams is a dog that manages to attack him each time he tries to confess his love for her. Produced and written by Tedder along with musician and record producer Benny Blanco, this single reached platinum on the Australian singles chart and only gained popularity when it was covered by Ben Haenow on the eleventh season of The X Factor.\n\n#8: “If I Lose Myself”\n\nNative (2013)\n\nInspired by Tedder’s fear of flying, this first official single on the Native album made it big in the United States and Germany. Accompanied by a music video that is based on the films “12 Monkeys” and “The Matrix”, the lyrics based on the sheer panic of going down in an airplane encourage listeners to live life to the fullest and cherish each moment. With a catchy beat and danceable melody, if there is any song that will change your way of life, it’s this one.\n\n#7: “All the Right Moves”\n\nWaking Up (2009)\n\nCombining a feeling of sadness with an energetic vibe, this was One Republic’s first single on their second album. With deep lyrics that are open to interpretation, having been called a social commentary, a political song, and even a song regarding secret societies, this tune has since reached the charts in Ireland, the UK, and the US. Praised for its sound and the well-directed music video that charted on the VH1 Top Video Countdown, this tune will have you singing along in no time.\n\n#6: “Feel Again”\n\nNative (2013)\n\nWith a noticeable Gospel influence, the hand-clapping, orchestra sound, and layers instruments will be sure to draw you right in. Vastly different from much of the band’s previous work, the song was positively reviewed by critics, who admired the beautiful harmony of Tedder’s voice, the uplifting melody, and the profound lyrical themes. With lyrics that speak of a numb heart and a man that’s trying to love again, it’s stirring and motivating to hear how he finally finds someone who helps him to “feel again,” and convinces us that we can too.\n\n#5: “Good Life”\n\nWaking Up (2009)\n\nHaving sold over 3 million copies, certified as multi-platinum, and on Rolling Stone’s list of Best Whistlingsongs, this One Republic song is nothing to sniff at. With relatable lyrics and a carefree vibe promoting contentment, it has become a concert staple and a common feature on TV and movie trailers, even becoming the soundtrack for Google’s \"in review\" video of 2010. With a remix courtesy of B.o.B and an alternate music video that showcases the band at Walt Disney World, “Good Life” was no doubt a success from the boys from Colorado.\n\n#4: “Stop and Stare”\n\nDreaming Out Loud (2007)\n\nNotable for being One Republic’s first non-remixed single, the lyrics of this sophomore single speak of a disillusioned man unable to move forward in life. Despite the sad vibe, the song became an early success for the band, as it has reached the charts in the US, UK, and Australia, and has sold over two million digital downloads internationally. The song also gave us a music video that gives us an up-close-and-personal glimpse at all five members of the band, and only added to the song’s sombre nature.\n\n#3: “Secrets”\n\nWaking Up (2009)\n\nAnother foray into Billboard Hot 100 territory, the appeal of this song is no “secret.” Another hit with lyrics and a music video that are open to interpretation, the catchy melody found a place in the hearts of fans from Germany and Austria to the United States. Here the band experiments with orchestral elements, which are not normally common in pop music, but it pays off big time. Using cello as it’s main instrument, “Secrets” is a beautifully written pop song that just gets better with every listen.\n\n#2: “Counting Stars”\n\nNative (2013)\n\nOne of their highest peaking singles of all time, this combo of pop, rock, and folk became another international commercial success. Allegedly written by Tedder while waiting for Beyoncé to join him at a studio session, this song is an inspiration to anyone who is struggling to make a living. Supposedly based on Tedder’s own early job and money troubles, he sings about how he followed his dreams with a goal of getting to the point where he wouldn’t have to count dollars anymore, just stars. The music video for the song is currently the fifteenth most watched video on Youtube, which only proves the band’s huge worldwide success.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honourable mentions:\n\n“Burning Bridges”\n\nNative (2013)\n\n“What You Wanted”\n\nNative (2013)\n\n“I Lived”\n\nNative (2013)\n\n“Love Runs Out”\n\nNative (2013)\n\n“Say (All I Need)”\n\nDreaming Out Loud (2007)\n\n#1: “Apologize”\n\nDreaming Out Loud (2007)\n\nCovered multiple times by the likes of Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan, there’s still nothing like the original. Timbaland remixed the song with his signature R&B sound, to make a hit that to this day is OneRepublic’s signature song as well as their most commercially successful hit. With lyrics that showcase a man’s regretful look at a past relationship, it originally spent 25 consecutive weeks in the Top 10, broke records for radio airplay, and was featured on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs list. No need to “apologize” to us, One Republic, we love you.\n\nDo you agree with our list? Which One Republic song do you have on repeat?
