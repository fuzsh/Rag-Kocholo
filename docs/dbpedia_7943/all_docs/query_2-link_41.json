He was born on 26th June in 1979.\n\nWhere is he from?\n\nRyan is American! He was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nHow did he get famous?\n\nDespite starting singing at the age of seven, Ryan actually worked as both a waiter and shop assistant for a number of years, before going on to complete an internship singing on demos at DreamWorks SKG.\n\nAfter turning down a publishing deal by DreamWorks to pursue his singing career, 21-year-old Ryan took part in competition where NSYNC singer Lance Bass chose him to perform in an MTV special show, with Ryan performing original material.\n\nAlthough Ryan won the show, it was later revealed that the recording deal he was supposed to be given wasn't 'real'.\n\nIt was then in 2002 when Ryan met legendary producer Timbaland that things really started to move for the singer. Ryan later wrote the now famous track 'Apologize' for his band OneRepublic, breaking records across the world.\n\nThe rest is history, he's since written some of the biggest songs in the world for some of the biggest artists, as well as his band OneRepublic becoming one of the most recognisable on the planet.\n\nWas Ryan on The Voice?\n\nHe certainly was!

That's a lot of money!\n\nIs Ryan Tedder on social media?\n\nOf course he is! Ryan is very active on his social media accounts, posting on both Twitter and Instagram regularly.\n\nFollow Ryan Tedder on Instagram at: ryantedder\n\nFollow Ryan Tedder on Twitter at: RyanTedder\n\nHas he won any Grammy Awards?\n\nRyan Tedder has been nominated for a massive 11 Grammy Awards, winning three of them! Interestingly, none have been with his band OneRepublic - they've all been for his work on other artists' music.\n\nAfter working with Adele to write and produce her albums '21' and '25', both of these picked up the award for 'Album Of The Year', '21' in 2011 and '25' in 2016.\n\nRyan's third Grammy Award was for his work on Taylor Swift's album '1989', which won the award in 2015.\n\nAre OneRepublic still together?\n\nOneRepublic took a three-year hiatus from 2013-2015 and are now back together! The band performed across Europe and the UK throughout April and May 2022 as well as their one-off in London in June 2023.\n\nThey released their track 'I Ain't Worried' in May 2022, and the song featured in Top Gun: Maverick. It was nominated for Best International Song at the BRIT Awards 2023, but lost out to Beyonc√©'s 'Break My Soul'.\n\nOneRepublic scored another worldwide hit with 'Runaway' in May 2023.\n\nYou can hear the biggest on hits Hits Radio.\n\nRead more:\n\nEd Sheeran: Get to know more about the 'Afterglow' singer\n\n17 songs you didn't know Ed Sheeran had written\n\n13 songs Bruno Mars wrote for other artists\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
