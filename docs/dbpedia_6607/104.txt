Nightfall was a content release to the freemium online multiplayer game of the same name, designed for children to play during lockdown. It was released to the iOS and Android platforms as an app, and available to PC and Mac devices via an online website. The content was available from 25 August to 29 September 2020.

The game itself was later announced to be closing entirely at the end of March 2021, ending any possibility of the content ever returning to the game.

In an interview with Radio Times, The CBBC's executive producer, Rachel Bardill, said that “Games like Nightfall are especially important now for kids to connect when they’re apart from friends and classmates, and Nightfall is bringing them together in an online dream world to defeat real nightmares. Nightfall puts collaboration before competition and the new Doctor Who zone is an exciting addition, transporting children into the world of the Doctor to unite and take on the Daleks.”
