        "text": "Maggot Machine is a new RPG from Nightfall Games, featuring a rules-light system called V6, set in a world of lost technology and mutated monsters. Written by Dave Allsop, the game offers a blend of weirdness and wonder. The quickstart guide provides an introduction to the system, including character stats, combat mechanics, and a scenario to start playing quickly. The game’s setting is a post-apocalyptic world where Guild Knights venture into dangerous territories to retrieve forgotten treasures. The game is available as a hardback book with 128 full-color pages.\n\nMonolith gains the intellectual property rights of Rackham, potentially reviving old games like Confrontation and AT-43. This decision was made by the Paris Commercial Court and clarifies ownership of the Rackham IPs. Previously, Monolith gained the rights to the Conan The Barbarian RPG.\n\nKickstarter introduces a new feature allowing creators to collect money indefinitely after their campaigns end, similar to Indiegogo’s “forever funding” model. This is similar to what companies have been doing off-site or in pledge manager with late pledges.\n\nCynthia Williams, President of Wizards of the Coast, resigns, leaving the company to search for her successor. Is this the Chance Kyle Brink has been waiting for?\n\nAdventure Time’s official tabletop RPG is launching with a 5E version first, with plans for a later release of the original ‘Yes And’ system developed by Forever Stoked. The campaign is live on Kickstarter and we will have to wait and see if both systems will be published.\n\nMaggot Machine\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/470848\n\nAdventure Time Kickstarter’\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cze/adventure-time-the-roleplaying-game\n\nTroika!

Polychron demanded $250 million but now owes $134,000 in legal fees to the Tolkien Estate. The court ruled that Polychron’s book infringed upon Amazon’s Rings of Power series. The judge described Polychron’s lawsuit as “frivolous and unreasonably filed.”\n\nBlack Site Studios released a new edition of the Horror miniatures game, Don’t Look Back, featuring updates, revamped mechanics, and new characters. The edition includes bonus rules for Vehicles and Companions, incorporating previous expansions. The set includes 32mm resin miniatures and a new Core Rulebook.\n\nAmazon Studios secured global rights to Warhammer 40,000, with Henry Cavill set to star and executive produce multiple projects. The deal covers series, films, and more. Cavill, a high-profile Warhammer fan, expressed excitement, and Amazon plans to work with Games Workshop and Vertigo Entertainment. The announcement follows Cavill’s involvement in various upcoming projects. Games Workshop announced a £2,500 end-of-year bonus for all employees as part of its 2023 profit share scheme. This comes after the release of Warhammer 40,000’s 10th Edition ruleset and the Leviathan box set. Additionally, Warhammer: The Old World is set to receive a robust reboot in 2024.\n\nWizards of the Coast denied claims that generative AI was used in artwork teasing the 2024 core rulebooks. Responding to social media allegations, the company stated that no generative AI was used, consistent with their artist guidelines. The artist, Nestor Ossandón, defended the process, sharing early sketches and work-in-progress versions. Concerns over AI-created artwork in the industry were raised following recent layoffs at Hasbro.\n\nNightfall Games discovered that artwork for Terminator 2 and RESIST on Kickstarter had AI-generated elements, identified as resembling the ‘Midjourney’ AI art generator. The company expressed disappointment, stating AI art is theft, and vowed to fix the issue. They are working with external artists to ensure AI-free art and implementing checks before payment and acceptance. The team thanked backers for their support.\n\n#blacksitestudios #henrycavill #jrrtolkien #nightfallgames\n\nHelp Jennel Jaquays:\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/jennell-jaquays-has-a-long-road-back\n\nShop at Noble Knight Games (affiliate link)\n\nhttps://www.nobleknight.com/affiliate/aw.asp?B=3&A=1312&Task=Click\n\n10% off First Purchase from Modiphius:\n\nhttp://r.sloyalty.com/r/vhbUPnHm6tIp\n\nDragonbane Actual Play Episode One:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC9u841QuXM\n\nDragonbane Core Set:\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/418106/Dragonbane-Core-Set\n\nDragonbane Free Quickstart:\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/409397/Dragonbane-Quickstart\n\nSupport Us by Shopping on DTRPG (afilliate link):\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com?affiliate_id=2081746\n\nMatt’s DriveThruRPG Publications:\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?author=Matthew%20Robinson\n\nChris on social media:\n\nhttps://hyvemynd.itch.io/​​https://twitter.com/hyvemynd​​\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ConanSalaryman​​\n\nAbusecartoons Weekly Cartoons:\n\nhttp://www.abusecartoons.com/​​https://www.twitch.tv/abusecartoonshttps://twitter.com/abusecartoons\n\n​​Support Us on Patreon:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/upturnedtable\n\nGive us a tip on our livestream:\n\nhttps://streamlabs.com/upturnedtabletop/tip​\n\nIntro song is “Chips” by KokoroNoMe\n\nhttps://kokoronome.bandcamp.com/\n\nAfter releasing the Mutant Chronicles license following the delayed Siege of the Citadel boardgame production, they are now releasing the Conan the Barbarian license and Monolith, makers of the Conan boardgame, are picking it up. What does this mean for the role-playing game? Will we see a new ruleset?\n\nLast year Cephalofair announced plans to crowdfund a fantasy miniatures line to complement our catalog of boardgames – providing highly detailed sculpts for each of our in-game enemies, bosses, and summonable creatures typically represented by 2D cardboard standees and tokens. Now, we’re excited to reveal that we’re planning so much more than just miniatures with our brand new product—Gloomhaven: The Roleplaying Game!\n\nNightfall Games have partnered with Mantic to produce the Hellboy RPG. The 5e-powered tabletop RPG will be available from Nightfall at Dragonmeet this weekend, along with the dice and GM screens. The PDFs of the game will move to Nightfall’s virtual shelves at DriveThruRPG. Nightfall will create a discounted Hellboy RPG bundle and work with Mantic Games on new Hellboy RPG products. The companies will also combine forces on the upcoming Korhonen series, B.P.R.D. cases written by Benn Graybeaton and previous Hellboy RPG contributors.\n\nCMON are going to be exploring the world of Android with a new graphic novel and also a range of miniatures that can be used with their board game collection. At the heart of the upcoming releases is Android: Run The Citadel which is a 120-page graphic novel where the Netrunner known as Chaos Theory has to hack a secure data system and solve the mystery of her friend’s death. This is an interesting collaboration between Fantasy Flight Games and Asmodee alongside the folks from CMON. The story comes from Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing with art by Guilherme Balbi. As well as the new graphic novel, pre-orders will also get access to the Run The Citadel miniatures which can be used in your CMON Games.\n\n#modiphius #conan #gloomhaven #hellboy #android #cmon\n\nNightfall Hellboy RPG Bundle\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/418225/Hellboy-The-RPG-Starter-Set-BUNDLE\n\nSCAB HEAP CHALLENGE:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/74348043?utm_campaign=postshare_fan\n\nBattletech Humble Bundle:\n\nhttps://www.humblebundle.com/books/introduction-to-battletech-catalyst-game-labs-books?partner=idleredhands\n\nSupport Us by Shopping on DTRPG (afilliate link):\n\nhttps://www.drivethrurpg.com?affiliate_id=2081746\n\nChris social media:\n\nhttps://hyvemynd.itch.io/​​https://twitter.com/hyvemynd​​\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ConanSalaryman​​\n\nAbusecartoons Weekly Cartoons:\n\nhttp://www.abusecartoons.com/​​https://www.twitch.tv/abusecartoonshttps://twitter.com/abusecartoons\n\n​​Support Us on Patreon:\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/upturnedtable\n\nGive us a tip on our livestream:\n\nhttps://streamlabs.com/upturnedtabletop/tip​\n\nIntro song is “Chips” by KokoroNoMe\n\nhttps://kokoronome.bandcamp.com/"
