        "text": "History & Rumor\n\nFredrick Nightfall\n\nBorn the only child of poor Norwegian immigrants Bjorn and Torill Kvelden, (Anglicized as “Nightfall”) Fredrick was unlikely to ever join the small class of rich elite industrialists that powered the growth of the nation. But when an uncanny series of accidents laid waste to several of the competitors best ships, Nightfall was able to step in with his small shipping company and fill the void. Soon he had put his competition out of business and was well on his way to becoming one of the largest shippers in the country. His children, Aldus Emmet and Rose Elise, would found Nightfall Orphanage.\n\nNightfall Shipping Empire\n\nDespite being known as an odd man who dabbled in the occult (as did many industrialists of the era) Fredrick was able to secure the hand of Margaret Holmes of Virginia, whose dowry helped exponentially expand the Nightfall Empire. It was an open secret in social circles that Margaret was unhappy in her marriage and suffered from severe melancholia. However, she still did her duty and gave birth to Fredrick's heirs, fraternal twins Aldus Emmet and Rose Elise Nightfall. With his company continuing to dominate the industry and with the subsequent birth of his children, Fredrick Nightfall had risen out of the poverty of his birth, and claimed a success so unnatural that rumors circulated that it had come by way of some dark supernatural pact.\n\nNightfall Shipyards\n\nAs the Nightfall Shipping Empire grew exponentially so to did its control over harbors, ports and some would say the seas themselves. Recovered work orders and ledgers show that most if not all of the Nightfall ships were built only at night, and logs from dock workers describe seeing a green glow beneath the harbor waters from time to time.\n\n​\n\nCompetitors vessels were often lost at sea with all hands, while Nightfall ships made safe port even in rough seas and terrible storms. Some sailors that did survive, reported their ships were attacked by some manner of creature and pulled down into the depths.\n\n​\n\nAccidents seemed common when others tried to sail along Nightfall Shipping routes and those that did often found trouble hiring crew, as it was said that Nightfall had struck a bargain with some devil beneath the waves. That it was due to some ritual performed in the secret society The Order of the Eastern Sky, of which Fredrick Nightfall was rumored to belong. Experts in Nightfall and Eastern Sky history believe that if some ritual pact existed, it was likely with Daga'thule -- The Deep One, The Drowned King -- a Drid archfiend who is the Custodian of the Watchtower of Despair.\n\n​\n\nOne well-known story of that time was that of a new bride and her sailor husband. According to legend, they married on the same day he set out to sea with one of Nightfall Shipping's competing vessels. She promised to wear her wedding dress every day until he came back to her so that upon his return, they could resume their nuptial celebration as if he never left. Hygiene of the time being what it was, it probably didn't pan out as romantically as she hoped. Either way, her love was lost at sea and never returned. Melancholy, she roamed the docks day and night as if his ship would make port at any moment. Her sadness turned to anger, and she began to blame Nightfall for her tragedy. She was found sometime later in the harbor waters, having drowned herself, perhaps on purpose, perhaps in an effort to join her lost love.\n\nThe Secret Order of the Eastern Sky\n\nSecret societies were a staple of industry magnates and men of wealth, and Fredrick Nightfall was no different. He was inducted into The Order of the Eastern Sky, a fraternal organization that focused on mysticism and the occult. It was here that he met his future partners Benedict Orr, Jurgen Gotten and Heinrich Hemmel.\n\n​\n\nThe secrets of The Order of the Eastern Sky have been well kept, and only bits and pieces of information are available about their rituals, tomes, and influences. It is rumored that Fredrick Nightfall had achieved the highest rank in the organization; A 33rd degree Magus of the Amaranthine Nightwind. Together with his compatriots Orr, Gotten and Hemmel, he formed an elite cadre within the Order, made up of the most influential members, as well as those who possessed the strongest affinities for magicks and alchemy. They called this The Circle of Dusk. Among its many interests and focuses, the Dusk Circle (as it was also known) delved deeply into meanings, symbols, and rites laid forth in the Orders great tome: The Codex Malificarium.\n\n​\n\n\"As above so Below!\n\nAs was done, now be Undone!\n\nAs was dead, be Alive Forevermore!\"\n\n​\n\n\"Let my Tongue be cut so that I may never speak\n\nMy Eyes be torn out so that I may never see\n\nMy Ears be cut off so that I may never here\n\nMy Hands be severed so that I may never write\n\nMy Feet be hobbled so that I may never run\n\nShould I ever betray the Sacred Rites or Secret Rituals\n\nHail Bathuzel! The Old One! Threshold of the Eastern Sky!\"\n\n​\n\n- Rumored to be parts of a rite of the Order of the Eastern Sky\n\nCodex Malificarium\n\n\"A Crown of 3 stars shall I lay,\n\nBefore the Light is torn asunder\n\nFor Lo, I have seen the Night swallow day\n\nAnd it is Dark and full of Wonder\"\n\n- From a torn page speculated to be the Codex Malificarium\n\n​\n\nWhat little has been revealed of the Eastern Sky's Great Tome, has been mostly in torn pages secreted out by an anonymous traitor, and from a badly burnt book found in the ruin of Nightfall Orphanage rumored to be the Codex Malificarium. The Book was discovered years later when the remains of the orphanage were cleared, and the lands surrounding it were renamed Widows Hill, after local legends of a ghostly bride haunting the cemetery and grounds.\n\n​\n\nMany believe the book was passed on from Fredrick to his children, who then, armed with the knowledge of the Circle of Dusk, unlocked more of its mysteries and power. If the book found in the ashes of the orphanage was truly the codex, then it is likely that many of the incantations, rituals, and summoning, were performed there.\n\nBenedict Orr & Orr Mining Company\n\nBenedict Orr was once a struggling farmer from a small town in Ohio. One night during a great and terrible storm, neighbors reported seeing Orr standing naked in his fields screaming at the sky as the rain poured down. The next morning, as most local farmers had their crops ruined by flood, Benedict Orr found rich copper veins on his land. From those initial mines, he expanded increased his operations across the landscape and expanded his mining operations to include other precious and industrial metals such as Gold, Silver, Iron, and Steel. Ever the narcissist, at each mining location he founded an Orr Town. For years, there were multiple Orr Towns dotting the globe.\n\nOrr Farm\n\nEven after his success Benedict Orr kept his family's farmlands. The lands and the farm itself were not without their own dark legacies. Tales of horrible deaths, brutal murders, and tales of affairs, jealousies, and revenge were as much a part of Orr Farm as the land on which it sat. At some point through the years, local vandals renamed the farm by adding a bloody \"H\" and \"or\" on the sign. From that point on it became known as \"The HOrror Farm.\"\n\n​\n\nThe Orr Farm and its lands had other importance as well. Though the legend says it was many years older, the first recorded instance of Mr. Black and his Black Carnival was one strange October on the Orr Farmlands.\n\nOrr Town\n\nAt one time there were many Orr Towns, each with its own mining operation. The Orr Mining company was the main supplier of industrial metals to Gotten & Hemmel Metal Works. Though most of its locations have been renamed and lost to time (either on purpose or by accident) some are still known. One example is the town of Blood Falls, renamed so because the remaining copper deposits turn its signature waterfall a reddish color. Others are known too, most famous of course being the site of the Old #66 Mine.\n\nOld #66 Mine\n\nThe first thing that was odd about #66 was that it didn't produce, yet had more miners than most other Orr Mines, who worked around the clock. Maps of the #66 mine showed that its many channels ran deep, strange for a mine to keep delving when it had never turned a profit.\n\n​\n\nEventually, the mine collapsed trapping most of the miners below. It was one of the single greatest mining catastrophe in histories, and though aspects have been forgotten, changed or lost, the story in most its parts is widely known. The miners were never rescued, and those who believed their deaths were supernatural in origin, grabbed on to local folklore and legend that said the miners were still somehow alive, and that you could still sometimes here them tapping out messages, waiting for a rescue that will never come.\n\n​\n\nAmong those who have studied the legends surrounding Orr Mining Company, it is believed that the collapse was done purposefully, the miners buried as a cover-up, a sacrifice, or both.\n\n​\n\nUrban legend hobbyists agree that something was happening in the old #66 mine, that they had found an ethereal gateway legend calls \"The Maw\" , mentioned in the Codex Malificarium. Others still think instead, or in addition, The Dusk Circle (by way of Orr Mining Co.) uncovered an important element, a device of some sort, integral to what they called \"The Great Work.\"\n\nFound Letter from Orr to Nightfall\n\n(Reconstructed from the available sample)\n\nFredrick,\n\nWe have done it! 66 has proved its worth, it is as we thought and we are ready to proceed with our next phase.\n\nThis must be the maw described in the Malificarium, it will be an important gateway in our future endeavors. It is, of course, currently dormant and will obviously take a great sacrifice to open and direct, but here I believe we can kill two birds with one stone. No one must know.\n\nAs our research showed, near the entrance to the maw we uncovered an intact and perfectly preserved Antikythera device. This will prove invaluable as its true purpose is so essential to the Great Work.\n\nOnce The Maw is opened and connected to your lands we can move the device through and into the Dusk Chamber. In the meantime, I am sending you my loyal man Jean-Marc Luc whom I think will prove useful to you as you prepare. He is an able man if not a wise man but seems to genuinely believe in our purpose. He is affable and hard working. I think you will find him a capable servant.\n\nSoon all the pieces will be set, it is shame we will not see the fruition of our great work until after our earthly deaths, but I know that your children will be more than up to the task of building along the sacred geometry we have established and completing this magnificent endeavor. What was dead will be alive forevermore and we shall be reborn without time to reap all we have sown. Hail Bathuzel, Threshold of...\n\n(End of available text)\n\n​\n\nThe Maw & Antikythera\n\nNomi Vasquez is a paranormal enthusiast and researcher who has become somewhat of a default expert on Nightfall and Radiant Lore. According to her research, when the Nightfall lands were turned over to the state, and became Widows Hill, crews found an underground passageway near the cemetery. The passage, overgrown and partially collapsed led to where a sink hole was found.\n\n\"We believe the sink hole is the site of the Dusk Chamber, a secret meeting place for the circle on Nightfall lands,\" Nomi says on her podcast. \"So it makes sense that there was a secret passage to it. Whats strange is that headed the OTHER WAY, it dead ends. Not collapsed, not caved in. Just built that way where it suddenly stops.\"\n\n​\n\nShe goes on to posit either by some paranormal anomaly or just imagined in their heads, the Circle of Dusk tried to connect the gateway they called The Maw, discovered in the depths of the Old #66 Mine, to the overgrown passageway on Nightfall land.\n\n​\n\nShe writes on her blog; \"If the collapse was on purpose, it might have been some kind of sacrifice they believed would allow them to control this gateway...The Maw...and somehow connect it near the Dusk Chamber on Nightfall property. The object they refer to as Antikythera, which is a Greek island, may be related to the device found there in 1901 and now bearing the same name. If it is or not, they clearly believed this object, device, or mechanism could do something like merge realities and/or manipulate space and time. There are several mentions of 'being reborn without time' in letters and papers, etc.\n\nIt is clear that this object was important to what the Circle kept calling their \"Great Work,\" and that the buildings and structures on Nightfall land were placed very specifically in line with Eastern Sky's teachings on Sacred Geometry. This includes Nightfall Orphanage built by the Nightfall Twins Rose Elise and Emmet Nightfall after their father's death.\n\n​\n\nIt seems pretty certain that the original Dusk circle knew they would not live to finish what they started and that it would be a generational project. Yet somehow, they expected to see it at the end. \"\n\nRose Elise & Aldus Emmet Nightfall\n\nMargaret Nightfall's chronic melancholia got worse, and she was given to mad ravings about creatures roaming the Nightfall Manor, and that her own children were somehow “Unnatural.” She soon moved to her own wing of the manor and would not see her husband or her children. In high society circles, the gossip was that she had finally gone mad, plagued as she always was from Melancholia.\n\nAfter the birth of his children, opinions of Fredrick changed dramatically. Where once people talked about his odd ways and rumors of his unnatural interests, he was then regarded as a devoted father who could always be seen with his children, as if the three of them shared a \"special\" connection. As Margaret retreated from the world, Fredrick and the twins had only each other. But the years took their toll on Fredrick as well, and his increasingly frail state confined him to a wheelchair. Yet where most people, rich or poor, meet old age and the coming of death with fear and denial, it was said that Fredrick and his children displayed anticipation bordering on excitement. Fredrick seemed, to some accounts, to be preparing to meet death as an old friend.\n\nAfter Fredrick's death many rumors circulated concerning the twin Nightfall heirs; stories of odd gatherings at the manor, mysterious deaths of servants, and their naturally odd manner. But the Twins were well known for their generosity in matters of philanthropy and charity, and most of these rumors were dismissed along with those that spread them. At least for a time.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNightfall Manor & Nightfall Asylum\n\nRose and Aldus Nightfall became as well known for their generosity and charity work as they did for their odd ways and strange behavior. They moved back into their childhood home Nightfall Manor, having inherited it and the lands it stood on after their father's death. Servants came and went, many claiming that the manor itself was cursed, which did not help ongoing rumors about the Nightfall family. But Rose and Aldus Nightfall continued to serve the community even as it whispered more and more behind their backs, and opened The Nightfall Asylum for the Insane and Melancholy. They based the architecture of the asylum on their father's design and laid the foundation in a location said to be predetermined by their father and the perhaps the Dusk Circle itself. It's first patient was their mother, Margaret and the twins hoped she could get the treatment she needed. Unfortunately, even with access to new and experimental procedures, Margaret Nightfall succumbed to her illnesses and passed away. There was no funeral, as she had long ago lost touch with any friends or family, and she was placed in the Nightfall Mausoleum in the Cemetery. Though it had an ever-increasing number of patients and boasted the newest and best practices, Nomi Vasquez notes that according to records no patient was ever cured. Indeed, in its history, not one patient was ever discharged from Nightfall Asylum. On her blog, she says that it is possible the Asylums placement and design had something to do with \"The Great Work\" and the Dusk Circle's Antikythera Device.\n\n​\n\nYears later, the Nightfall lands would be taken over, and the name of the area changed to Widows Hill after the local legend of an angry bride wandering the Cemetery.\n\nNightfall Cemetery & The Widowed Bride\n\nNightfall Cemetery was not just a family plot, but larger grounds on Nightfall Property that served as the final resting place for many people from the surrounding areas. Fredrick Nightfall had opened it to the public so that people rich and poor alike could be buried in the once garden-like acreage. Whether it was out of charity or for some other darker purpose, his reasoning was never known.\n\n​\n\nNot all buried there were local, as Fredrick invited friends, members of the order, and others to make Nightfall Cemetery their place of internment. It was Fredrick, who suggested the young widowed bride, who had drowned herself by the shipyard, be buried at Nightfall.\n\n​\n\nLocal legend has it that she still rises from her grave, walking the grounds, still searching for her husband. Her anger and longing so great, that she pulls the dead from their graves searching for her lost love. She continues her futile walk on dark nights, and the dead she pulls from the ground walk with her.\n\n​\n\nThis legend, and accounts of those who had seen her, is why the area was nick-named Widows Hill. Years later, the entire area would take that moniker officially. Nightfall Cemetery became Windows Hill Cemetery and Recreation Park. Nightfall Asylum for the Insane and Melancholy was renovated and renamed Widows Hill Institute of Mental Health.\n\nNightfall Orphanage\n\nContinuing with their charity work, Aldus and Rose Nightfall opened the Nightfall Orphanage, which they would run themselves, and promised love and care to those children who had none. Initially, their continued generosity was celebrated, but soon people began to question the goings on at the Orphanage. The children, some would say, were as peculiar as the Nightfalls themselves and seemed to just appear over night. The rumors about the Nightfalls persisted, and met with new whispers of everything from child abuse, to dark rituals, to the orphans being supernatural themselves. Old Legends mixed with current rumor, and many people believed it had to do with old Saxon superstitions about changeling children.\n\n​\n\nAccording to Vasquez's paranormal blog, the changeling was a superstition in European and Saxon folklore in which fairies, elves or evil forces abducted young human children and replaced them with a deformed or malicious doppelganger. This was often used to explain changes in behavior in children, as well as other events easily debunked in our time. It was commonly thought that you could have your child returned by torturing the changeling and then leaving it in the hallow of a tree or under a specific boulder. This obviously led to numerous cases of actual abuse. However, given descriptions of the children by those that lived near by, Vasquez feels there might be something to it. OR at least, she can see why the connection.\n\nSpats of disappearances in the area after the Orphanage was built did nothing to help its reputation. People reported seeing a kid, sometimes two, in bowler hats before the disappearances, and it became a rumor that the Bowler Hat child was a harbinger of some dark fate. There was growing concern about the orphanages' “Bad Place.\" Anger and fear in the community eventually boiled over, and one night a mob arrived with torches, and set fire to the Nightfall Orphanage. The home burned to the ground, presumably with all its inhabitants still inside, however no bodies were ever found. As the Orphanage burned into the night, many reported hearing not screams or cries for help, but the sounds of children laughing. Several people claimed that entwined with the roaring sounds of fire, “as if on the wind,” they heard children playing Ring Around the Rosy and singing \"Ashes, ashes\" as Nightfall Orphanage burned down.\n\nBowler Hat Kid\n\nHickory trickery, Mice and Bats\n\nSores and boils, alley rats\n\nFather and mother put out the cat\n\nand run from a kid with a bowler hat\n\nDouble Trouble, toil and shrew\n\nmake you do housework, make you eat stew\n\nMother and Father and bubbling brew\n\nthe bowler hat kid is coming for you\n\nBell Book and candle, beetle and bark\n\ntoad in a pond and song of a lark\n\nsay it three times and then it will start\n\nthe kid with the bowler hat waits in the dark\n\n​\n\n- Old Children's Rhyme\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAmong those who research Nightfall legend such as Nomi Vasquez, it is commonly accepted that the Bowler Hat child, or Bowler Hat Twins, were at least considered to be manifestations of the twin Drid Archfiends Vazinath, Herald of the Dusk, and Xothtamal, Bane of the Dawn. But who really knows?\n\nThe Bad Place\n\n“Bad children go to that bad place” was a warning that parents still gave to their misbehaving children years after the Nightfall Orphanage was burned to the ground. When word of its existence had first reached people's ears, most thought it just a disciplinary implement for unruly children, if perhaps a little overbearing. But as time went on, and whispered warnings in the day turned to distant screams in the night, people began believing that The Bad Place was something different altogether. It became clear that all the children of the orphanage were bad, some people would even say evil. Bad children going to the bad place, was not perhaps so much a disciplinary action, as it was an invitation for the changeling children of the Orphanage. In the days leading to the fire, townspeople openly talked about dark rituals made, and dark beings being called. The most pervasive of these rumors was about someone or something the children reverently called “Mr. Giggles.”\n\nMr. Giggles\n\nAlthough the mystery of who or what Mr. Giggles actually had never been discovered, it was commonly said that he was some sort of demonic benefactor to the children of the Orphanage. Many believed that sightings of the so-called \"Bowler Hat Kid\" were related somehow, or that people who went missing during these sightings, were used in rituals to summon Mr. Giggles or taken to the \"Bad Place.\"\n\nOn Vasquez's blog, she says writing and illustrative fragments from the ruins of Nightfall Orphanage point to some kind of creature, that could assume multiple shapes to please the children. One at least seems to be the form of a giant clown.\n\n​\n\nCross-referenced with what can be gleaned from the ruined copy of the Codex Malificarium, she thinks that his being was from the Drid pantheon commonly worshiped by The Order of The Eastern Sky and especially by the Circle of Dusk.\n\n​\n\n\"Specifically,\" She said on a Paranormal Podcast concerning her research, \"I think Mr. Giggles is likely Ethroot, The Infestor, Baron of Flies and custodian of the Watch Tower of Disgrace. Which would probably mean the \"Bad Place\" is a reference to the Dark Reach, which is his domain.\"\n\nThe Dark Reach\n\nThe Dark Reach (aka just 'The Reach') is the domain of the Drid Ethroot. The Dark Reach exists as a construct, usually manifested as a hallway with many doors. The Codex Malificarium and the Order of the Eastern Sky make reference to it many times and are meant to make use of it as a multi-destination gateway. It is more than that, however, and it is not known what is truly behind the Red Doors in the Dark Reach. Do they lead out? Or is something trying to get in?\n\n​\n\nThe Red Doors are not limited to just Dark Reach lore and appear in other legends and other sources, as well as other places. There is some evidence that Red Doors were thought to exist in certain places in the Radiant Twilight. While they all seem to share a common purpose, what that is, despite the additional sources, remains a mystery.\n\n​\n\nThe Dark Reach is often confused with The Radiant Twilight, but the two are quite different.\n\nThe Drid Pantheon\n\nWhat remains of the Codex Malificarium found in the ashes of Nightfall Orphanage, speaks often of The Radiant Twilight. It is a place, it proclaims, between worlds, alternately describing it as the hallway between rooms, the space between the walls, the room behind the door, and the moment just after Dusk and just before the Dawn. It is a place behind the veil, where echoes of what has been, and nightmares that should never be take shape. Memories appear whole, places once visited return. In certain times of the year, such as October, the veil between this world and the Radiant Twilight grows thin and some things cross over.\n\n​\n\nAccording to the Codex, There are nine watchtowers in The Radiant Twilight, each with a custodian. It does not go into detail but these watch towers seem to be part of on going balance between opposing ideals and opposing forces, yet they are as much a part of the Radiant Twilight as anything else within it. Because of the states the purported Codex was found much of the information is missing. But it is known that The Custodians of the Watchtowers were from the Drid Pantheon worshiped and revered by the Eastern Sky and the Circle of Dusk. Only some of the watchtowers and their Drid custodians are legible. They are;\n\n​\n\nThe Watchtower of Despair, whose custodian is Daga'Thule, The Deep One and The Drowned King.\n\n​\n\nThe Watchtower of Regret, whose custodian is Belial, The Malignant, Teeth of the Wind\n\n​\n\nThe Watchtower of Disgrace, whose custodian is Ethroot, The Infester, Baron of Flies\n\n​\n\nThe Watchtower of Ridicule, whose custodian is Vazinath, Herald of the Dusk\n\n​\n\nThe Watchtower of Vengeance, whose custodian is Xothtamal, Bane of the Dawn\n\n​\n\nThe Watchtower of Deceit, whose custodian is Tothmaru, The Night Mother, Regent of the Somber Day. In the codex she appears as a powerful figure who holds sway over the Drid and the nine Watchtowers.\n\n​\n\nBut all the Drid are ruled over by the Elder God Bathuzel, King of Shadows, Threshold of the Eastern Sky\n\n​\n\n- Special thanks to Nomi Vasquez for sharing her information on this.\n\nThe Radiant Twilight\n\n​\n\nThe Codex Malificarium refers to the Radiant Twilight in fairly dark terms; Nightmares, Regrets, unfulfilled desires, haunting, and so on.\n\n​\n\n\"But this is not the whole picture,\" says acquitted surrealist anthropologist Dr. Beth Gilmore in her book The Secrets of the Eastern Sky, \"There are other sources, having nothing to do with Eastern Sky, that speak of it as a place of manifest dreams, of fond memories...it is more a place of balance, like the mortar between the bricks - a place between the walls and between worlds...It would be inaccurate to say that the Radiant Twilight is neither good nor evil, but rather that it is BOTH good and evil, co-existing at the same time -- like two quantum Ron Silvers*\"\n\nGilmore notes that some of the material explains that for all the Watchtowers there are opposing Lighthouses, both of which have some import in keeping an uneasy but necessary balance. \"The Codex only gives one mention, but other sources talk about a place usually referred to (depending on the translation) as The Bastion, which clearly relates to these Lighthouses in opposition to the Watchtowers. As if there are two sides of a balanced whole.\"\n\n​\n\n\"Imagine the foundation, the structures between the walls of a house, or its foundation. If the balance isn't maintained the foundation wavers and the house collapses,\" Reads Gilmore's chapter on the Radiant Twilight, \"The Radiant Twilight exists in someway as that foundation between reality and dreams, between the real and the imagined, between nightmares and waking.\" She concludes towards the end of the book that the collapse of that balance, a breaking of the walls separating the Radiant Twilight from other realities, may have been what The Dusk Circle was after all along,\" Dr. Gilmore concludes.\n\nNomi Vazquez further illuminates;\n\n\"It's not just these things, these echos appearing...there is...an energy it seems, almost like it's a living thing. And according to the Eastern Sky, that energy can be used for different purposes.\"\n\n​\n\nVasquez writes on her blog, \"Psychics and demonologists, such as Ed and Lorraine Warren, have documented how demons use fear to feed themselves, grow stronger and take possession of hosts, or of their souls. As far as the Drid are concerned, this kind of fear or despair is a savory meal to them. There are plenty of legends and folklore from all over the world that focus on the power of fear...some say a scream...like a good, solid truly terrified scream...is part of the soul leaving the body, presumably to be captured...or I guess eaten by...some demonic entity depending on the region of the tale. Likewise, there are plenty of stories and legends about the Radiant Twilight by other names such as the Spirit World, Goloka (Not the one who thought the Yulu's were too ugly to save**), The Astral Plane, The Veil...though it's quite different in its presentation I wouldn't be surprised if 'The Upside-down' from 'Stranger Things isn't at least loosely based on some legend of the Radiant Twilight. Likewise, the world is full of tales of spirits, ghosts, and demons who can inhabit both worlds or places where these worlds intermingle; Forbidden forests, haunted houses, spiritual vortexes.\"\n\n​\n\nIn another post she connects these concepts to The Black Carnival:\n\n​\n\n\"There are plenty of legends about these carnivals or circuses appearing, especially in the autumn. But none as pervasive as Mr. Blacks. When we think of the Black Carnival in the context of The Radiant Twilight, The Drid, and so on, it becomes quite compelling...almost Meta in a way. Sources point to a 'Debt long owed,' by Mr. Black, 'which must be paid in screams.' So here is this carnival of his, The Black Carnival, whose sole purpose it seems is to feed the Drid with the screams of unsuspecting guests. But where it gets kinda mind-blowing is that in today's terms at least, it's basically a haunted attraction...like for Halloween. If it's real it's really clever. Disguise what you are doing with the thin you are doing. Lie by showing the truth. If legends are real, then the black tents of Mr. Blacks' carnival are all gateways of some sort, connecting Radiant objects to those in our world. All the Nightfall echos, like the Orphanage, come out of this. Is it just a haunted attraction, or is it all a construct to steal a part of you through your screams? It's f--cking fascinating.\"\n\n​\n\nDuring October, the veil grows thin enough that the memories and echos of Nightfall Orphanage re-emerge on our mortal plane in a sort of half-reality.\n\n​\n\n*No one is going to get that reference.\n\n**Probably not that one either\n\nThe Black Carnival\n\nPer Nomi Vasquez Paranormal Blog:\n\nStories of the Black Carnival go back ages, and in different forms, usually passed down by word of mouth or oral tradition folklore. But some of the evidence of its actual existence comes from the paperwork of Benedict Orr. The Black Carnival definitely was erected throughout several Octobers on his farmland. There is even an old artist rendering of it from a local paper that depicted a sea of Black Tents against other normal carnival implements such as Rides and games...a sideshow of some type sponsored by Dr. Marvel & his Miracle Tonic and so on. It was there.\n\n​\n\nWhether there are gateways into and out of the Radiant Twilight, or they are just themed attractions based on the lore..maybe both... it's clear the main attraction was the stories or events that took place in those black tents. In legend at least, it seems The Black Carnival is or was a place that was half-in and half-out of this world and the next. Its purpose is to capture part of people's being, or their soul or whatever, by filling them with fear...by stealing their screams.\n\n​\n\nMr. Black himself seems to be a migrating spirit, or like an avatar, who inhabits a person in that time in order to gain access to the mortal plane and rebuild his Carnival in an effort to repay that \"Debt long owed.\"\n\n​\n\nThe Bastion\n\n\"If The Black Carnival is a place of Nightmares and Fear, the Bastion is a place of dreams and Imagination. They are perfect examples of the legends surrounding the Radiant Twilight and the balance kept through the conflict of these opposing paradigms.\" Writes Dr. Beth Gilmore in her forthcoming book, published by Hammer & Lowe, \"The Darkness of the Light in the Darkness of the Shadow in the Twilight Between the Light and the Darkness that make the Shadows and Thus by the Places they are Absent Reveal the Light in those places without Darkness\" (Working Title).\n\n​\n\nNomi Vasquez is particularly interested in stories of The Bastion, though she admits not much on the subject has been found beyond fragments;\n\n​\n\n\"I am really fascinated not only by The Bastion but by stories of The Wardens, this kind of ranger or warrior that patrol the Radiant Twilight and protect the Bastion. It just sounds cool...But I mean just imagine this place where dreams and ideas can actually take shape. In the same way, The Black Carnival can take you on these journeys into horror and darkness, it seems like the Bastion can take you to fantastic adventures and other worlds. It's almost like these things are some kind of imaginative Theme Park concept.\n\n​\n\nBut I also just like this idea, that somewhere out there there are these people, these Wardens in other realms, protecting the dreamers, the thinkers, the hopeful. Doing battle with Nightmarish forces. It's cool. I just feel an affinity there, especially around the legend of The Bright Warden. Sometimes when I find some new piece of information, or someone emails me some newly found text...I feel like I already know the story like I am remembering it instead of hearing it for the first time. It just sounds familiar to me. I want it to be real haha!\"\n\n​\n\n\"But this is also part of what makes Mr. Black so interesting. Even though he is The Proprietor of the carnival, he doesn't necessarily seem to be evil or have any real allegiance to either side.\"\n\n​\n\nMr. Black\n\nStories of Mr. Black go back ages, though sometimes he is referred to by different names. The tales themselves are as variant in tone as they are in the mythos. From one paranormal website or mythology blog to the next, and ancient tales from several cultures, Mr. Black has been painted as everything from a harbinger of darkness to a playful trickster spirit. But as divergent as his legends and purposes are, several elements remain constant;\n\nMr. Black is an avatar, or migrating spirit, who takes up residence in a host's body. He usually looks for artists or craftsmen, those with talents he can use to achieve his aims. He seeks out those who have been weakened or ill, and offers them a bargain in return for using them as a vessel. He uses the symbiosis between their talents and his magic to try to rebuild his Black Carnival; a dark festival of fear and Nightmares, where countless nightmares come to life. The carnival will pay his debt long owed in screams.\n\n\"Mr. Black is a much more complex legend than it seems on the surface. I mean there are versions of stories where he helps the wardens, or where he uses The Carnival to both pay his debt and help people in need. Even the host he makes a bargain with is much more of a symbiotic relationship; each gets something in return. He's back and forth. He's a trickster. He's like a dark Willy Wonka,\" Vasquez said on a recent Podcast.\n\n\"I mean look at Nightfall Orphanage. Is it a haunt just based on the Nightfall stories or is it actually part of the story? Is it just a haunt or is it partially a construct in Mr. Blacks' endeavor to pay his debt? Is it both? Is it a charity to help attract people to come and steal a piece of their soul, or is it just to help people? Again, is it both? And Aleister Black, that wasn't the name he was born with...but in the legends, all the hosts take the name...so is he just taking the name after the legends of Mr. Black, or is he actually f#$%ing Mr.Black? I mean he fits with the legend; He was an artist type, he did get sick, he even died for a few minutes and came back saying he was Mr. Black. So what is the truth?\n\nI mean we can guess because we live in this reality, but even that is just perception and there are things out there, things I have seen, that are not easily explained. There is strange S#%t afoot at the Circle K.\n\nEither way one thing is clear...this is just some small part of some larger design.\"\n\n\"In fields down low\n\nor high on a hill\n\nthe carnival comes\n\nand goes at will\n\n​\n\nA spider whispers\n\ninside your ear\n\nthat Mr. Black\n\nknows what you fear\n\n​\n\nWhere shadows walk\n\nand change their shape\n\nyou'll soon find out\n\nthere's no escape\n\n​\n\nFor when you scream\n\nhe takes you back\n\nthen you belong\n\nto Mr. Black\"\n\n​\n\n-Old Children's Sing-Song"
