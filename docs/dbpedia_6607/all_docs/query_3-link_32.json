        "text": "Townsfall\n\nThis project is currently in development. We will be having new pictures and features updates coming up soon!\n\nWhat is Townsfall?\n\nTownsfall is an upcoming map that is based off of the popular Starcraft II map, Mafia by DarkRevenant. The map itself will feature a similar gameplay style as the original Mafia map, except instead of playing purely from a series of complex and complicated menus, you will be using your units instead. During daytime, you are safe from being killed by enemy players, but once the nightfall hits...the townsfolk begin to fall.\n\nThe game is planned to have multiple gameplay modes, but the game's intended mode is Mafia. There will be 2 teams of players, The Town, and The Mafia. There will also be neutral players who will fill classic roles such as the Arsonist or the Serial Killer. Players will need to utilize their role's abilities to the best they can, for once they are seen, it is free game at night time. However with that said, the enemy must also stick to the shadows.\n\nRoles\n\nRoles are randomly selected for players at the beginning of the match after the game settings have been set. Players can have classes that range from being completely useless to roles that can kill players or help assist a player in figuring out somebody else's role.\n\nUseless Roles\n\nCivilian\n\nSupport Roles\n\nSherriff Investigator Escort Doctor Mayor Driver\n\nKilling Roles\n\nConsigliere Mafioso Consort Mafia Driver Godfather Jailor Bodyguard Veteran\n\nMore coming soon"
