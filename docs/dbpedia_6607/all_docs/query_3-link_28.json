        "text": "The Nightfall Incident Theme:\n\nTECHNIC\n\nReleased:\n\n2002\n\n'\n\nThe Nightfall Incident is a Spybotics Online game developed by Gamelab in 2002, formerly hosted by the LEGO official website. Currently, the game can only be found on various archive sites.\n\nThe game featured the four signature spybots from the Spybotics theme, Gigamesh G60, Snaptrax S45, Shadowstrike S70 and Technojaw T55.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nThe player character assumes the role of a \"SMART\" agent, whose job is to police crime on the net, using his or her personal spybot as a hacking tool. Most of the game consists of logging onto hacked corporate servers, restoring the company's access by destroying their corrupted security programs or retrieving locked files from the company's archives. In order to fight and move around within the corporate server grids, the player can purchase SMART designed hacking programs, each containing a different set of strategic abilities with which to combat rogue security software.\n\nThe player can also accept missions from various contacts on the net. Successfully restoring a corporate computer or completing a mission gains the player credits and sometimes unique or experimental programs.\n\nPrograms[]\n\nIn order to fight computer crime, both SMART agents and corporations use special programs that can fight against hostile software within a server. When hacking into a hostile node, the player is able to upload a certain number of programs onto the server grid, which will usually contain a number of hostile programs in waiting. Upon uploading his or her programs, the player can then control and use them to fight corrupted software and/or gather important data packages.\n\nMost programs are acquired through Warez nodes. In exchange for credits, Warez nodes will supply agents with what software they have available.\n\nLevel 1 Warez Node: Leo Leontis[]\n\nName Move Max Size Cost Commands Description Hack 2 4 500 Slice: Deletes 2 sectors from target Basic attack program Bug 5 1 750 Glitch: Deletes 2 sectors from target Fast, cheap, and out of control Slingshot 2 2 750 Stone: Range:3 Deletes 1 sector from target Basic ranged attack program Data Doctor 4 5 500 Grow: Adds 2 sectors to target Helps your programs grow Bit Man 3 3 250 Zero: Deletes one grid square\n\nOne: Repairs one grid space\n\nMakes sectors of the grid appear or disappear Clog* 2 4 N/A Lag: Range:3 Decreases move rate of target by 1 Slows down hostile programs\n\n*Clog is a mission reward.\n\nLevel 2 Warez Node: Tsumara285[]\n\nName Move Max Size Cost Commands Description Hack 2.0 3 4 1500 Slice: Deletes 2 sectors from target\n\nDice: Size Req:3 Deletes 3 sectors from target\n\nImproved Hack: larger size and better attacks Golem Mud 1 5 1200 Thump: Deletes 3 sectors from target Slow and steady attack program Wolf Spider 3 3 750 Byte: Deletes 2 sectors from target Speedy and creepy little program Seeker 3 3 1000 Peek: Range:2 Deletes 2 sectors from target Solid distance attack program Tower 0 1 1000 Spot: Range:3 Deletes 3 sectors from target Immobile long-range program Medic 3 3 1000 Hypo: Range:3 Adds 2 sectors to target Grows your programs from a distance Turbo 3 3 1000 Boost: Increases move rate of target by 1 and deletes 1 sector from Turbo Speeds up your programs\n\nLevel 3 Warez Node: Kimoni Ameotung[]\n\nName Move Max Size Cost Commands Description Hack 3.0 4 4 3500 Slice: Deletes 2 sectors from target\n\nMutilate: Size Req:4 Deletes 4 sectors from target\n\nThe top of the Hack series Golem Clay 2 6 3000 Bash: Deletes 5 sectors from target Clay is stronger than mud Black Widow 4 3 2000 Byte: Deletes 2 sectors from target\n\nParalyze: Decreases move rate of target program by 3\n\nSpeedier and creepier Mandelbug 5 1 3000 Fractal Glitch: Deletes 4 sectors from target It's not a bug, it's a feature Buzzbomb 8 2 3500 Sting: Deletes 1 sector from target\n\nKamikaze: Deletes 5 sectors from target and erases Buzzbomb\n\nFast and annoying Fiddle 3 3 2400 Tweak: Increases move rate of target by 1 and deletes 1 sector from Fiddle\n\nTwiddle: Increases maximum size of target by 1 and deletes 1 sector from Fiddle\n\nTwiddle and tweak the power of your programs Seeker 2.0 3 4 2500 Poke: Range:3 Deletes 2 sectors from target Bigger and better than Seeker Mobile Tower 1 1 1800 Spot: Range:3 Deletes 3 sectors from target Slow-moving long-range program Satellite 1 1 3500 Scramble: Range:2 Deletes 4 sectors from target Sort-range hard-hitting program Ballista 1 2 3000 Fling: Range:4 Deletes 2 sectors from target Extreme-range attack program Data Doctor Pro 5 8 1500 Megagrow: Adds up to 4 sectors to target\n\nSurgery: Increases maximum size of target program by 1\n\nTwice the expansion power of Data Doctor Clog.02 2 4 2000 Chug: Range:3 Decreases move rate of target by 2 Twice as effective as version.01 Turbo Deluxe 4 4 1750 Megaboost: Size Req:3 Range:2 Adds 2 to move rate of target and deletes 2 sectors from Turbo Deluxe Slow and steady is for losers Memory Hog* 5 30 N/A N/A Massive memory-filling bloatware\n\n*Memory Hog is a mission reward.\n\nLevel 4 Warez Node: Minerva[]\n\nName Move Max Size Cost Commands Description Golem Stone 3 7 5000 Crash: Deletes 7 sectors from target Nothing can stand in its way Tarantula 5 3 3500 Megabyte: Deletes 3 sectors from target\n\nParalyze: Decreases move rate of program by 3\n\nFast, with a venemous bite Heisenbug 5 1 4000 Quantum Glitch: Deletes 6 sectors from target They can't kill what they can't catch Logic Bomb 3 6 3500 Selfdestruct: Deletes 10 sectors from target and erases Logicbomb Self-destructing attack program Sumo 2 12 4500 Dataslam: Size Req:6 Deletes 8 sectors from target A massive and slow-moving powerhouse Seeker 3.0 4 5 4500 Poke: Range:3 Deletes 2 sectors from target\n\nSeek and Destroy: Size Req:5 Range:2 Deletes 5 sectors from target and 2 from Seeker\n\nSeeker with extra deletion power Laser Satellite 2 1 5000 Megascramble: Range:3 Deletes 4 sectors from target Long-range hard-hitting program Catapult 2 3 4000 Fling: Range:4 Deletes 2 sectors from target Extreme-range mobile attacker Clog.03 2 4 3500 Chug: Range:3 Decreases move rate of target by 2\n\nHang: Size Req:4 Range:3 Decreases move rate of target to 0\n\nBrings hostile programs to a halt Guru 2 3 4500 Fire: Range:2 Deletes 4 sectors from target\n\nIce: Range:2 Decreases move rate of target by 3\n\nMultipurpose software for the 133tist of the 133t Wizard* 3 4 N/A Scorch: Range:3 Deletes 2 sectors from target\n\nStretch: Increases max size of target by 1\n\nPay no attention to the man behind the curtain\n\n*Wizard is a mission reward.\n\nCorporate Programs[]\n\nCorporate programs are unobtainable, and can only be encountered as enemies. While most of the hostile programs the player will encounter are rogue corporate programs, there are a few instances in the game where the player will also come across rogue SMART programs."
