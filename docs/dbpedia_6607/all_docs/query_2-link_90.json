We also built the robust and secure scalable server solution able to handle millions of concurrent users.\n\nNot only this, we created a safe space for social play with limited (pre-set) in-game communication, free from any advertising and not a loot box in sight. “Amazing for Everyone” as we say at Goodboy!\n\nWe’re thrilled to see Nightfall fully live and the seeds of a community taking root.\n\nEnter the Dream. Defeat Nightmares. Become a Legend."
