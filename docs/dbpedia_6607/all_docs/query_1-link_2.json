        "text": "Demon Dog is a role-playing game set in a medieval history that never was. You play “Dogs”, revenants that were snatched from purgatory by Demon Barons, seeking redemption and a pint. You’re not a hero now and you weren’t one before you lived, but you’re possibly making things better, or worse, or at the very least less boring.\n\nYou died. It’s very sad. Get over it.\n\nLuckily for you, you negotiated with one of the six Demon Barons and you get to finish your unfinished business. Go get revenge, seek redemption and … um, oh yeah, you made a pact. You’d better do what the demon wants too.\n\nAs a ‘Demon Dog’, you get to wander the world, dealing with all those people who deserve a bit of a shoeing. There’s the Clergy and their Inquisitors that could do with tasting a head butt and they’ve got churches to burn. There’s the press that peddle lies to the gullible with an open ear and they might not like it if their scriveners get a wee bit stabbed. What about the toffee-nosed monarchy and their loud-mouthed guards, they might want to go home in an ambulance wagon. Give it some welly.\n\nBut don’t forget your Demon Baron needs stuff doing. Sometimes that’s a bit less fun; other times, it’s right up your street. Wayhey!\n\n‘Demon Dog’ is inspired by MÖRK BORG and is compatible with it, but is a stand alone product. You can smash together the ideas in both books or pull ideas from one into the other.\n\nMÖRK BORG’S rules are all about minimalistic simplicity. They designed them so that they will never interfere with your game, and so that you can easily adapt and change them to better suit your needs. In short: whenever you try to accomplish something in the world, be it climbing a ruin or bashing a demon head in, you roll a d20, apply a modifier and try to beat a set number. That’s it. And you either let your equipment define your character, or you pick one of the six optional classes that each has their specific quirks and strengths. The system is player-facing, and they will roll most of the dice, to really put the destiny of their characters in their hands. No fudging allowed. The few times the GM will roll the dice are when NPC’s morale or reaction is rolled, things like that."
