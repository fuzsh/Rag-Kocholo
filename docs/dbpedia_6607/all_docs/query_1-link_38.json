        "text": "Really enjoy this game!! However, I would like the text to be smaller or something like that so it doesn't need to scroll down. Also, I would love to see more games like this! Thanks for your hard work!\n\nBtw, why is the elevator so mean lol\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this game. Very clever and fun. I liked all those Nintendo easter eggs (Smash Bros, Metroid, etc). Original story for a short game, fun dialogues and good execution overall. Can't wait for the sequel! I like the Game Boy look, but I would prefer a Game Boy Color color palette. I know this is more work but it would look so much better while keeping the same overall look.\n\nThank you very much for playing it on stream! I wish I had been there so i could've told you that you missed that investigation table haha, the hints in chat were correct but those events don't trigger yet without knowing about the investigation.\n\nI'm glad you liked the graphics (and overall polish of the game), they were made by me specifically for this game and aren't available as an asset (saw someone asking about it in chat).\n\nAs you noticed during the credits the game was indeed made for Ludum Dare though I did spend A LOT of time afterwards polishing it :)\n\nThanks again and look forward to the sequel ;)\n\nI downloaded the game (MacOS Big Sur version 11.2.3) but the Mac said I don't have access/authority to open it even though Im the only person using my Mac and I did all the steps to give myself access to the files according to the Apple instructions but still can't open the game... Anyone have any idea how I can play it?\n\nI. LOVE. THE AESTHETIC. It nails that old retro GameBoy atmosphere. And the ability to change color palettes is great! One thing however. I was playing this game and I got to the part where you become a mouse and I was having a fun time, but then I had to make dinner, so I closed the application under the premise that it would save, but it didn't so that was a bit of a chore. Other than that, it is an extremely funny and charming game, and I hope you keep up the good work xx\n\nOh wow! I love this game. The graphics are so cool. I agree with the last comment that at a couple points it was necessary to search every room investigating everything... but I honestly I don't even know how developers come up with these puzzles so kudos to you. Very creative.\n\nAlso, I didn't know what to expect in length because some games on Itch are SO short. I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't over in 15 minutes. It probably took me 30-40 mins, which is a good length for a game where you can't save.\n\nReading below, I am shocked that English is not your native language. The dialogue is so natural and funny. When I have to use my second language at work I spend ages checking what I write, so I know how painful it can be when you don't want to make any mistakes.\n\nThank you for making this Game! very funny and enjoyable, also quite interesting, psychologically, i think. The searching for the phono number and dialing it felt al little bit repetitive, though, because its the same principle almost as the chore before. And i had to leave the game to write it down, because i didnt want to memorize it. Also, searching every object in the game for the code...i mean, there could have been a clue or something, where it would have been reasonable to find.\n\nLike your description this is a short and absurd adventure game but the ridiculousness of the game make me laugh over and over XD. I really enjoyed the music, U MUST UPLOAD IT ON SPOTIFY !!\n\nThis game is MASTERPIECE, can't wait for your next game haha :D"
