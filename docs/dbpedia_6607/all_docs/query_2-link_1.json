        "text": "The Terminator RPG by Nightfall Games is a table-top roleplaying game where you and your fellow players play characters trying to survive in a world where Skynet unleashes Terminators to fight humanity.\n\nLicensed by STUDIOCANAL, The Terminator RPG is based on the 1984 The Terminator movie and associated Dark Horse comics.\n\nMark Rapson, The Terminator RPG producer said\n\n“Now we have passed our funding level on the Kickstarter campaign, we are looking forward to showing you the world compiled in ‘The Terminator RPG. It’s is not just a role-playing game though—it’s a sourcebook for the Terminator film and its expanded universe. Any Terminator fan will want this gorgeous book on their shelf, whether they intend to play or not.”\n\nNightfall Games is working with the challenges of the current pandemic and has shifted all their meetings online, chatting on messengers and over the phone as often as will allow, and are working as a team in spite of the challenges this brings. Nightfall Games’ previous project, SLA Industries 2nd Edition has now been delivered to all the Kickstarter backers and the team is now focused on the Terminator RPG.\n\nJared Earle, production director, teases us with designs for some of the accessories in the Kickstarter.\n\n“As backers of the SLA Industries Kickstarter will know, the design, printing and manufacture of our games and accessories are of the highest quality. We have some wonderful exclusives coming including special edition covers and limited edition dice and dice trays.”\n\nThe art of The Terminator RPG is directed by the creator of SLA Industries Dave Allsop. Dave is working on the art direction for The Terminator RPG alongside his work on the next SLA Industries 2nd Edition supplements, adding\n\n“Terminator has always been a favourite of mine, and it’s great to bring the stable of artists we gathered for Nightfall Games to such an exciting world,”\n\nThe setting team is led by 2020 ENnie and UKGE award-winning author Andrew E.C. Gaska (ALIEN RPG)\n\n“I am looking forward to bringing the story to The Terminator RPG like I have already down with the Alien RPG. There is such a rich vein of information to delve into and so many stories yet to tell”.\n\nABOUT NIGHTFALL GAMES\n\nNightfall Games are Dave Allsop, Jared Earle and Mark Rapson.
