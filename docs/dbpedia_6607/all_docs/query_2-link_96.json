        "text": "I keep hearing about Nightfall strikes, but I have no idea how to access them. I've looked everywhere on the map when I'm in orbit choosing where to go, and I don't see it anywhere. I see the 3 symbols on the left of the screen that are arranged vertically, the two on the right, which are the strike playlist and crucible, but nowhere do I see anything that says Nightfall. How do I get to it? I'm really starting to get aggravated that how to access this stuff isn't just in the game somewhere, unless I totally missed it, which I suppose is possible. I'm level 23. Does it unlock later on, because I've read about people accessing it at level 23 before.\n\nI wish that Destiny came with a basic manual (actually, I haven't read the digital download book, so I may be wrong here.) But even a cursory description of certain things in the game would be nice. As an MMO toddler, I don't understand a lot of things about the conventions, so it would be kinda nice to be spoonfed descriptions of how to treat currencies, raids, and other high-level content. I'm kind of impressed that Bungie went for such a stripped-down tutorial system in the current age of hand-holding AAA games, but I also kinda feel like the content is disjointed and arbitrarily chopped-up."
