The 5v go to pin 8 and then via a 150ohm resistor to pin 16, this TV/monitor without this configuration doesn’t display the RGB image correctly.\n\nThese are the computer and consoles that use this VDP:\n\nColecoVision\n\nCreatiVision Memotech MTX\n\nMSX1 Computer\n\nNABU Personal Computer\n\nSega SG-1000/SC-3000\n\nSpectravideo SV-318/SV-328\n\nSord M5\n\nTatung Einstein\n\nTexas Instruments TI-99/4A\n\nCasio PV-2000\n\nColecoVision ADAM Computer\n\nHanimex Pencil II\n\nTomy Tutor\n\nToshiba Pasopia-IQ MSX1 Computer\n\nYamaha CX5M MSX1 Computer\n\nTelegames Personal Arcade\n\nPowertran Cortex\n\nHow much did i spend for each PIC9918 ?\n\n2 x Strip Round 40 Gold Pin : €1.15\n\n1 x RP2040 Pi Core Black : €2.69\n\n1 x JLCPCB Assembled (SMD components) PCB : €7.65\n\nMore or less for each single PICO9918 complete with all components you will spend €11.49.\n\nThe price of each component also includes the cost of shipping and customs clearance.\n\nNOTE: I forgot to write that the composite SYNC for the scart can be taken from one of the two SYNC (H/V) VGA.\n\nGallery:\n\nDownload: Pico9918 (VGA/SCART) Firmware v0.4.0 (PCB v0.3) (43)\n\nsource: wikipedia github\n\nPhilips Monitor (Black) VG0060-80 Power Stage Repair, the Monitor turned off unexpectedly without any suspicious noise.\n\nThis power stage is practically identical to other monitor models, for example: Philips CM8833 and Commodore 1084, but surely there will be others that mount the same power stage.\n\nRepair:\n\nAfter removing the PCB of the power stage i took the opportunity to replace also the power switch that no longer worked properly i also replaced the exploded fuse but obviously nothing worked.\n\nThe fault was due to the TS132 transistor completely short-circuited, the diagram says that a BU806 is installed but instead a 2SC3795B is installed.\n\nReplaced, still nothing works, i tried with the tester but i don’t find any voltage, even the 300v +/- on the capacitor C112 at this point in addition to the diode bridge (D107/D108/D109/D110) there was only the 47 Ohm 7W resistor R103 to try and in fact it was interrupted, i replaced it with a 5W one, i didn’t have a 7W one in the lab.\n\nI used the old trick of the 100W bulb in series, in my case instead of the fuse to avoid destroying other components.\n\nEverything worked perfectly, the bulb turned on for a minimum amount of time and then turned off and the output voltages of the power stage are all present (125v/15.8v/25.5v).\n\nGallery:\n\nDownload: Philips VS0060-80/CM8833/1084 Schematics (93)\n\nThis is a short story of the Roland MT32 Midi repair.\n\nThe MT32 MIDI interface had an annoying audio problem (you can listen to the audio files attached to this post).\n\nIt seemed like the classic problem of exhausted electrolytic capacitors, but instead it was due to the ROM ROLAND R15449121 (TC534000P) position IC37.\n\nTo replace the original ROM it would have been enough to use an OTP Eprom 27C040 which however i didn’t have in the laboratory so i used a FLASHROM AM29F040 by modifying some connections.\n\nThe filename of the file used to program the FLASHROM is “r15449121.ic37.bin” which you can find in the archive attached to this post.\n\nBelow is the documentation how to adapt the AM29F040 instead of a 27C040.\n\nAtmel AT27C040 – 4Mb (512K x 8) OTP, EPROM (32-pin Package)\n\nAmd AM29F040 – 4Mb (512K x 8) FLASHROM (32-pin Package)\n\nTie 29F040 WE (PIN 31) and connect to VCC (PIN 32)\n\nTie 29F040 A18 (PIN 1) and connect to PIN 31 on Socket or PCB\n\nMonkey Island Audio difference before and after repair:\n\nBefore the Repair (91)\n\nAfter the Repair (82)\n\nGallery:\n\nDownload: Roland MT32 (various OS and extra ROMs) (110)\n\nsource: Synth Eprom Dumps\n\nSD-1000/PiCOLECO/PiRTO-II are Flash Multicarts for Sega SC3000/SG-1000,CBS ColecoVision,Mattel Intellivision by Andrea Ottaviani based on the cheap version of the Raspberry Pi Pico clone (purple PCB).\n\nI wanted to try and assemble this interesting project and i must say that i was very satisfied. I also contacted Andrea for a small problem of loading the ROMs for the Multicart Intellivision and he was immediately available even though it was Sunday lunch time :-)\n\nI assembled two Multicarts for each console model because as soon as i informed my friend Andry about this project he wanted them too :-D\n\nThe Multicarts you see in this article are NOT for sale, for more information about firmware,flashing fw,gerber,3D case model i recommend you visit the github site where these projects are published.\n\nSD-1000: https://github.com/aotta/SD-1000\n\nPiCOLECO: https://github.com/aotta/PiCOLECO\n\nPiRTO II: https://github.com/aotta/PiRTOII\n\nHow much did i spend for each multicart?\n\n6 x Raspberry Purple Pi Pico clone (Aliexpress): €18.12\n\n5 x JLCPCB PiCOLECO PCB: €1.87\n\n5 x JLCPCB PiRTO II PCB: €3.74\n\n5 x JLCPCB SD-1000: €3.74\n\n1 x JLCPCB Shipping Charge: €6.66\n\n1 x JLCPCB Customs duties & taxes: €3.52\n\n1 x JLCPCB PAYPAL FEE: €0.47\n\n6 x Diode 1N4148 (spare parts)\n\n2 x Transistor BC547 (spare parts)\n\n2 x Angled Push Button (spare parts)\n\n4 x Push Button (spare parts)\n\nMore or less for each single Flash Multicart complete with all components you will spend around €6.00.\n\nThis includes the components that i already had at home and the minimum order from JLCPCB for each PCB which are 5 pieces, as a result i did the division on the JLCPCB invoice total.\n\nDownload the ROMs for Sega SC3000/SG-1000, ColecoVision, Intellivision (including CFG mappers) fully renamed and divided into folders in alphabetical order here.\n\nFlash Multicarts Cartridge Case Shell Cover:\n\nThe last photo with a small modification of the hole to insert colored button covers.\n\nHow to update the firmware with the case closed? You have to press the button on the PI Pico Purple while inserting USB-C for firmware updating.\n\nTotally excluded unscrewing and retightening the screws each time, so 1.5mm micro hole in the right position, perfect.\n\nGallery:\n\nI wanted to remake the RGB connections of my CBS ColecoVision console a bit and design a new diagram for connecting the RGB video output.\n\nThis console was sold with an external modulator (CBS Electronics Adaptateur Antenne 7466 – 6F) that converted the signal from RGB to RF and it seems a Scart cable was not provided for direct connection to the television.\n\nThe original ColecoVision D-SUB DB15 to Scart cable that i have doesn’t have the correct pinout but it works perfectly with another ColecoVision always with RGB output but with an internal encoder that converts the Y (B-Y) (R-Y) to RGB signals (PAL Secam Converter A).\n\nThis fact is really curious, apparently there are more versions with RGB output as well as RF.\n\nI decided to remove the old RGB cable that i soldered internally about 15 years ago and replace it with an RGB cable connected to the Coleco native connector.\n\nThe problem with doing this operation has always been the D-SUB DB15 connector which must be of a certain size, otherwise it won’t fit.\n\nBrilliantly solved using a SNK NeoGeo Joypad extension cable, where we have a DB15 D-SUB connector pre-cast in the plastic where all 15 pins are used (in theory only 14 are needed for the NeoGeo Joypad, but all 15 are connected)\n\nI cut the cable from the neogeo joypad male connector side and soldered the wires to a Scart connector and for the Fast Switching signal before connecting it to pin 16 of the scart i used a 100ohm resistor in series, i did not use the Function Switching signal.\n\nOne more thing, the Audio signal from the console native RGB connector is very low, so i made a jumper (see photo) to bypass a resistor and a ceramic capacitor, therefore i took the audio directly from PIN 7 of the SN76489 (Sound Generator).\n\nOf course everything works perfectly.\n\nGallery of work done:"
