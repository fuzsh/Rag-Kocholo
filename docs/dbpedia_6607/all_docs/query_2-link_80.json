Yet, occasionally, it'll roll into a dlc strike and lock everyone who doesn't have that dlc out of it for a whole week. Putting a randomly occurring time gate on it and any vanguard quests related to it, that you basically have to pay to get around. This is the sort of anti-consumer predatory practices I thought would be removed from the game after they split from activision.",
