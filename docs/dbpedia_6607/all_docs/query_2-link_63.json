If that account is subsequently closed for any reason, then a refund cannot be issued. In that event, we will offer store credit instead.\n\nSpecial Note Re: Pre-Orders More Than 6 Months Old:\n\nDue to PayPal policies, refunds on pre-orders more than 180 days old must be issued manually. This requires that customers verify the correct e-mail address linked to their PayPal account. Without customer verification, we cannot issue a refund for pre-orders more than 180 days old.\n\nSpecial Note Re: Orders Paid From a PayPal Business Account\n\nDue to Changes in PayPal Policies, if you pay for an order with a PayPal Business Account, orders cancelled more than 180 days after the purchase date will have standard PayPal fees applied to the refund, thus reducing the total amount refunded. Please note that we have no control over this. This ONLY applies to refunds for pre-orders more than 180 days old. Nevertheless, if you wish to ensure that you receive a full refund under all circumstances, we highly recommend making your purchase from a personal account, or use another payment option, such as a credit card or Amazon Pay.\n\nAfter Purchase and After Delivery\n\nDamaged Goods - If a game arrives damaged, just contact us within 30 days from date of receipt of items.

We will pay for return shipping and send you a return shipping label to use if you choose to return the game, or we agree to exchange the game with a replacement copy.\n\nDefective Parts - If your game has a production defectjust contact us within 30 days from date of receipt of item, we'll send you replacement pieces/parts if available. If not available in our inventory, we'll work with the manufacturer on your behalf to obtain replacement pieces/parts which we will ship at our expense.\n\nIncorrect Goods - If you receive a wrong order, just contact us within 30 days from date of receipt of items to receive a full refund on the price of the item or replacement if available.

We will, however, work with customers on a case by case basis.\n\nPlease note\n\nBy placing your order you accept responsibility to receive delivery of your order at your designated shipping address.\n\nHow to request a return and/or refund\n\nFor any Return or Refund requests, please email us at CustomerService@TheGameSteward.com.\n\nOur goal is to make you happy.
