        "text": "The Gods Have Fallen—Now It’s Your Turn\n\nAs fledgling deities, the player characters must undertake divine labors to fulfill their destinies. An ancient text directs them to slay a raver—a creature of profound malignancy. But there are other agendas at play, and what seems like a stepping stone to divinity may prove the characters to be all too mortal.\n\nAfter the Nightfall is an adventure for the Gods of the Fall setting for the Cypher System. It can be played as a standalone adventure, or it fits neatly into the divine story arc The Night Beast Awakens from Gods of the Fall. You need both the Cypher System Rulebook and Gods of the Fall to play this adventure.\n\nNote: The total page count of 21 pages includes the 9-page adventure, plus six double-sided pre-generated characters."
