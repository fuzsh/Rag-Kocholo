        "text": "Kent Thurston wore a red hooded cloak when fighting crime as the Invisible Hood.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\n\nIronically, he was not really invisible when he began his crime-fighting career. It wasn't until he tried to rescue a kidnapped chemist, who had discovered the secret of invisibility, that he was able to live up to his codename. During the botched rescue, the chemist was killed but not before entrusting his secret to Kent. With the secret chemical compound, which rendered the wearer invisible, now sprayed on his cloak, he continued to fight for the good of society.\n\nFreedom Fighters\n\nHours before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Thurston was recruited by Uncle Sam to join the Freedom Fighters in defending the base. Their mission was to stop the Japanese task force en route to Pearl Harbor.[1] They nearly succeeded, but a surprise attack supposedly left Thurston for dead. The entire team, except for Uncle Sam, was seemingly killed. It was later revealed that all of the team except for Magno had lived [2]\n\nThe Invisible Hood survived until 1974, when he was apparently murdered by Icicle and the Mist. This fact was recorded by the Shade, whose journal recounted his conversation with the Mist: \"As I recall, it was the Invisible Hood you killed. He'd semi-retired by then. Moved to Austin, Texas. And… um… wasn't it '74?\" [3] Thurston's great-grandson, Ken Thurston, died when he tried to carry on the Invisible Hood legacy. Also, Blindside, from the superhero team Relative Heroes, believes that Kent Thurston is his grandfather.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nAbilities\n\nInvestigation\n\nInvisibility\n\nParaphernalia\n\nEquipment\n\nInvisible Cloak: Kent wore a chemically-treated formerly-red hooded cloak, that was invisible and which could render him invisible. Already a covert crime-fighter, he decided to avenge the chemical's creator by continuing to fight crime, starting with retribution for the chemist's death.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Invisible Hood was created by Art Pinajian, first appearing in Smash Comics #1. However, the Earth-Two version of The Invisible Hood first appeared in All-Star Squadron #31 by Roy Thomas and Rick Hoberg.\n\nAlthough this character was originally introduced during DC's Earth-Two era of publication, their existence following the events of the 1985–86 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths remains intact. However, some elements of the character's Pre-Crisis history may have been altered or removed for Post-Crisis New Earth continuity, and no longer apply.\n\nIn the pre-Crisis timeline, Invisible Hood died helping Uncle Sam fight the Japanese armed forces on Earth-X (as shown in All-Star Squadron #32). In the post-Crisis reality, that battle did not happen. It was replaced by the pre-Pearl Harbor battle shown in Secret Origins (Volume 2) #26, which he did survive (barely).\n\nUnfortunately, though invisible, his footprints would be \"visible\" in dust, snow, etc., which proved to be his downfall many times.\n\nRelated"
