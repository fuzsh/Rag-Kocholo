He pursued two careers simultaneously, as professor of Latin and as editor, author of poems, essays, biography, literary criticism, political history, even children's books. He eventually suffered a mental collapse, and his reputation was irremediably tarnished because of a sordid affair involving a woman who sued for breach of promise. As a result, he was dismissed from his professorship in 1910. Peck committed suicide in 1914. \"Only a great pity and sorrow must abide for the unhappy ending of so brilliant a career,\" wrote his colleague Nelson Glenn McCrea."
