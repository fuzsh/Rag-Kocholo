        "text": "Thomas Weelkes (baptized October 25, 1576, Elsted, Sussex?, England—died November 30, 1623, London) was an English organist and composer, one of the most important composers of madrigals.\n\nNothing definite is known of Weelkes’s early life, but his later career suggests that he came from southern England. He may have been the Thomas Wikes who was a chorister at Winchester College from 1583 to 1584, because he was organist there from 1598 to 1601. He was appointed organist of Chichester Cathedral probably late in 1601. He received the degree of bachelor of music at the University of Oxford in 1602, and the following year he married. In his last volume of madrigals (1608) he claimed the title “Gentleman of the Chapel Royal.” From 1609 he was frequently reprimanded at Chichester for a variety of reasons, including bad language and drunkenness.\n\nNearly 100 of his madrigals survive, of which his finest work is in the two books of madrigals, of five and six parts, respectively, that appeared in 1600. His madrigals have been said to combine the elegance of Luca Marenzio and the firm sense of tonality characteristic of Thomas Morley with the verbal sensitivity of William Byrd. Weelkes is noted for his word painting, lively rhythms, and highly developed sense of form and structure. He also wrote music for virginal, viol, and organ. His sacred compositions, most of which were written before his appointment at Chichester in 1601, are largely unpublished. Of Weelkes’s 10 Anglican services none survives complete; three that have been reconstructed blend the solo writing of the English verse anthem with the massive antiphonal style of the Venetian school. Twenty-five of Weelkes’s 41 anthems are either complete or restorable; the “full” anthems (with no solo verses) show him deploying large numbers of voices. His range of expression is illustrated by the airy song in the Italian madrigal style, the balletto “On the Plains Fairy Trains” (1598). Examples of the graver manner include the madrigal “O Care, Thou Wilt Despatch Me” (1600), noted for its chromaticism (use of notes outside the basic scale, for effects of colour or intensity), and the massive anthem O Lord, Arise."
