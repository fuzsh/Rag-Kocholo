        "meta_description": "\"When the scholar and the poet wrestles in you,\" Bonnie Thurston was once asked by a friend at Tymawr, \"who wins?\" The poems in Belonging to Borders are her response. In these poems, Thurston reverences the borders, literal and metaphorical, that have been a part of her life since childhood. This reverence shines in her deep appreciation for holy space, for nature infused with the divine, for roots that are deep. These prayerful meditations on Celtic saints and places invite the reader to honor the borders in their own lives and to recognize the holiness of living on the borders.    Bonnie Thurston, after years as a university and seminary professor, lives quietly in her home state of West Virginia. She is the author or editor of fifteen theological books, including Philippians in the Sacra Pagina series; Religious Vows, the Sermon on the Mount, and  Christian Living; The Spiritual Landscape of Mark (Liturgical Press) and For God Alone: A Primer on Prayer (University of Notre Dame Press). Her poetry appears frequently in religious periodicals and has been published in two small collections from Three Peaks Press in Wales, The Heart's Lands and Hints and Glimpses.",
