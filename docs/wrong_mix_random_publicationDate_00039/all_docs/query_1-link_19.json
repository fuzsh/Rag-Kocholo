        "text": "Rembert - Thomas Jeffery Thurston, 66, of Rembert, widow of the late Linda Marie King Thurston, died Wednesday, December 30, 2020 at Prisma Health Tuomey. Born December 2, 1954 in Bangor, Maine, he was a son of Marstella Thomas Pirone, and the late Paul Arthur Thurston. He was an avid outdoorsman that enjoyed hunting and fishing. Thomas was also a card-carrying member of the NRA. He was a wonderful husband, father and grandfather who impacted the lives of his family and friends in so many ways. He was loved by everyone in his life and will be greatly missed.\n\nSurvivors include his children , Rachel Tilley and her husband, Matthew, Jeffrey Paul Thurston and his wife, Courtney, and Shannon Wells and her husband, Ryan; grandchildren, Hailey, Claire, Chloe, Everett and Stella Faye, as well as his mother Marstella Pirone and sisters, Paula Thurston and Elaine Thurston. In addition to his father, he was preceded in death by a sister, Suzanne Farber.\n\nMy dad was an incredibly kind, warm and caring soul. I feel so lucky to be his daughter. He taught me that when life gets hard you have to take it in strides and remember not to get too caught up in the little things. I will cherish all of our long talks and the moments after mom passed where we leaned on each other. I desperately wish you were still here, but know I will always carry you and mom with me wherever life may lead. - Shannon Wells\n\nThe impact that he had on my life was such a great one. I never knew that you could love an in law as much as I loved him, like he was my own father. I wish so much that my daughter could grow up and feel the love from him that I was so honored to feel. I know that he will always be with her no matter what, and for that I am so grateful. I’ll miss you forever, until we meet again. -Courtney Thurston\n\nServices for Mr. Thurston will be private.\n\nYou may go to www.bullockfuneralhome.com and sign the family’s guest book.\n\nThe family has chosen Bullock Funeral Home for the arrangements."
