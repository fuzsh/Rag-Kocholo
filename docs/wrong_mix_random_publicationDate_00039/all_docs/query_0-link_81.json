        "text": "[Photo by Victoria F. Gaitan]\n\nTom Carson won two National Magazine Awards during his time as Esquire’s “Screen” columnist and was nominated twice more as GQ magazine’s “The Critic.” He also won the CRMA criticism award for his book reviews in Los Angeles magazine. A longtime writer on pop culture and politics he wrote extensively for the LA Weekly and the Village Voice, including an obituary for Richard Nixon in the latter that the late Norman Mailer termed “brilliant.” He has contributed over the years to publications ranging from Rolling Stone to the Atlantic Monthly. His fiction and poetry have appeared in Black Clock. His verse and other random writings can be found at tomcarson.net.\n\nIn 1979, he was the youngest contributor — with an essay on the Ramones — to Greil Marcus’s celebrated rock anthology, Stranded. With Kit Rachlis and Jeff Salamon, he edited Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough: Essays In Honor of Robert Christgau in 2002.\n\nBorn in Germany in 1956, he grew up largely abroad at the hands of the U.S. State Department. He graduated in 1977 from Princeton University, where he won the Samuel Shellabarger award for creative writing. A former resident of Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, and New Orleans, he can now be found in Kentucky.\n\nHe is the author of three novels: Twisted Kicks (1981), Gilligan’s Wake (2003), and Daisy Buchanan’s Daughter (2011).\n\n[From The Baffler and Amazon.com]\n\n1981\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\nAmazon.com Review\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nFrom Library Journal\n\nFrom Booklist\n\n“[A] mad-real mind reel of a novel…The resulting playback is intoxicating, ecstatically inventive and…oddly touching.” ―The Washington Post Book World\n\n“An energetic pastiche…Wow. In their wacky conflation of fact and fiction–and their happy confusion of high and low brows–the septet of stories amount to [a] carnivalesque daydream….Just sit right back and you’ll hear a playfully paranoid history of the twentieth century.” ―Entertainment Weekly\n\n“Read[s] like a crossword puzzle based on the album cover photo of ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’…Vivid and inventive…Utimately, all that comic energy deepens into a genuinely moving elegy.” ―San Francisco Chronicle\n\n2011\n\n“Tom Carson’s new novel is simultaneously an epic sequel to The Great Gatsby,\n\na tour-de-force meta-narrative of the last 90 years of American history, and a\n\ndazzling feat of old-fashioned storytelling. The octogenarian narrator of Daisy\n\nBuchanan’s Daughter is by turns wistful, sarcastic, bemused, nostalgic, furious,\n\nand scathingly funny as she evokes—intimately, pungently, and in gorgeous\n\ndetail—the best and worst century in human history (so far). She is the first\n\ngreat literary character of the new millennium, and her all-encompassing\n\nstory is some sort of crazy masterpiece.”\n\n—James Hynes, author of Next and The Lecturer’s Tale\n\n“To the generations of Fitzgerald readers who wondered what became of Daisy\n\nBuchanan’s daughter, Tom Carson has the answer. She grew up not careless,\n\nbut witty, seductive, alarmingly intelligent, and possessed of supernal powers\n\nof observation. She lived nine decades that swerved to include everything\n\nfrom prewar depression, to war coverage, to Cold War power-jockeying and\n\nwell beyond, with Broadway, Hollywood, and jet-set stopovers aplenty. She\n\ndid it all with an eye that took in everything from the way her contemporaries\n\nwere wearing their suits to what lies they told the public and each other. And\n\nshe recorded it all in a playful, imaginative, and extremely funny narrative—\n\nand posted it online. Great dames of the 20th century, open your ranks: Pam\n\nBuchanan is part of the sisterhood.”\n\n—Farran Smith Nehme, the Self-Styled Siren\n\n“Daisy Buchanan’s Daughter is that rarest of triumphs—a laugh-out-loud funny novel\n\nthat’s also dead serious. Conjuring an American landscape in which fictional\n\ncharacters seem as real as flesh-and-blood people, Tom Carson’s unforgettable\n\nheroine escapes from The Great Gatsby to take us on a tour-de-force guided tour\n\nof the past century, from flipped-out flappers to Dubya’s dream of the orgastic\n\nfuture. Here is history seen through the looking glass—delirious, diabolically\n\nwitty, and absolutely unique.”—John Powers, Critic at Large for NPR’s Fresh Air with Terry Gross and author of Sore Winners: American Idols, Patriotic Shoppers, and Other Strange Species in George Bush’s America\n\n“Take a skippy, dizzy, dazzling joyride with a chick who cracks the East and\n\nWest Eggs wide open. The old lady holding the gun and the keyboard may be\n\nDaisy Buchanan’s daughter, but she’s the stylish stepchild of Nabokov, blogging\n\nabout what happened after Fitzgerald set down his pen. Her own wild adventures—\n\nliterary, sexual, historical—anticipate a fateful phone call from one of\n\nthe great villains of recent years. Pammie is the dame-iest of dames, and this is\n\nthe rompiest of reads. Huzzah!”\n\n—Susann Cokal, author of Mirabilis and Breath and Bones\n\n“In this inventive and masterful novel, Tom Carson takes us inside the privileged\n\npost-Gatsby world of the iconic Buchanans, bringing to bear his exquisite\n\nand confident imagination as he presents the world of Daisy Buchanan’s daughter—\n\na world no less fraught and socially dangerous than the one in which\n\nFitzgerald’s characters roamed. Carson’s skill with multiple voices brilliantly\n\nilluminates the kaleidoscopic sense of identity one invariably finds in a brittle\n\nmilieu. The reader will be captivated.”\n\n—Thaisa Frank, author of Heidegger’s Glasses and A Brief History of Camouflage\n\n“Sprawling, clever, flamboyant, recklessly ambitious, Daisy Buchanan’s Daughter\n\ntakes gigantic risks and delivers gigantic rewards. There aren’t many people\n\nwriting novels like Tom Carson, but one may be all we need.”\n\n—Geoff Nicholson, author of Bleeding London and Gravity’s Volkswagen\n\n“Who could have predicted the daughter of Tom and Daisy Buchanan would find herself, at the age of 86, a crotchety, irreverent, foul-mouthed blogger living in Washington, D.C., nursing an obsession for Kirsten Dunst? Or that her life would intersect, scandalously, with Lyndon Baines Johnson’s? Or that Nick Carraway would find religion? By the time you finish reading this trippy, hilarious, brilliant meta-memoir of a novel, you may need a refresher in 20th century history to parse fact from fiction.” –Susan Coll, author of Beach Week, Acceptance, and Rockville Pike\n\n“An extravagant act of imagination—magnificently written, and as seditious\n\nand blindingly smart as it is irresistible and laugh-out-loud fun.”\n\n—Steve Erickson, author of These Dreams of You, Zeroville, and Our Ecstatic Days\n\n“Daisy Buchanan’s Daughter is an acute, hilarious, and moving vision of the 20th century as refracted trough two unique sensibilities: that of its indefatigable narrator, and that of the supremely witty, deeply wise, and endlessly playful writer who dreamed her up.” –Glenn Kenny, critic for MSN Movies and blogger at Some Came Running\n\nInterviews\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1306435\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1174401\n\nTom Carson"
