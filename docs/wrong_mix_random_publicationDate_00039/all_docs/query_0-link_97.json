        "text": "Reflections for Trooper Louis Perry Bryant\n\nTrooper Bryant,\n\nOn today, the 40th anniversary of your death I would just like to say thank you for your service and sacrifice-not just as a Law Enforcement Officer but for our Country when you served with the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War. And to your Family and loved ones, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy.\n\nBPA Mike Casey\n\nUnited States Border Patrol(Retired)\n\nAs we approach another yearly milestone we pause once again to give recognition, respect and remembrance to Trooper Louis Perry Bryant for his dedication to duty, and ultimate sacrifice; he will always be remembered.\n\nRetired First Sergeant Thomas WebbNew York State Police - Troop\n\nNever to be forgotten.\n\nFirst Sergeant Thomas M. Webb (Retired)\n\nNew York State Police - Troop D\n\nI just saw the FBI Files episode about Trooper Bryant's assassination. May he rest in eternal peace.\n\nGod bless Teooper Bryant's and his family.\n\nDetective JAS\n\nNYPD\n\nNever to be forgotten as we continue to keep Trooper Bryant in our thoughts.\n\nRetired First Sergeant Thomas Webb\n\nNew York State Police - Troop \"D\"\n\nOne of my college professors in Texas was a boyhood friend of Trooper Bryant, and I learned about his death in 1988. I just happened across a youtube video regarding the hate group that was responsible for his murder. I'm about to retire from 29 years of law enforcement and I am thankful that I have survived several encounters with similar hate groups. These groups are still out there and they despise law enforcement. Stay vigilant and stay safe!!\n\nTrooper Bryant may your soul rest eternally.\n\nDuane Hicks, Sergeant\n\nSanta Monica Police Department\n\nToday I will take the time to give honor to Trooper Louis Perry Bryant for his service. May his soul rest in Heaven.\n\nRetired First Sergeant Thomas Webb\n\nNew York State Police - Troop \"D\"\n\nWe grew up together in Fayetteville. Lewis was one of the best guys you could ever meet, he loved fishing. Him and my brother Paul was suppose to go fishing that weekend when he came home.He loved what he did as a Trooper. When we was in high school he ran the hurdles like they were nothing.God took a good man home.#WemissyouPerry.\n\nJimmy Blackburn\n\nRetired diesel mechanic.cousins.\n\nLewis Bryant was my friend. He was the same guy all the time and never played games. He loved his family, job & his bass boat in that order. Some of the best memories I have from those years was as a deputy and working with Lewis Bryant. He made you laugh in times when you weren’t, but needed to do so badly! This was a tragedy that should never have happened. In these times now with a war on police front and center, at least he didn’t have to see it. If your a cop it makes no difference your ethnicity you do the job and Lewis liked everyone he met! He made a difference and is severely missed every day.\n\nEric Dean\n\nTrooper Louis Perry Bryant will never ever ever be forgotten. RIP sir.\n\nRetired First Sergeant Thomas Webb\n\nNew York State Police - Troop \"D\"\n\nI remember seeing this recently on FBI Files and thinking the frightening reality of domestic terrorism then and now. Trooper Bryant, you are a true hero sir and your memory, service and sacrifice will never, ever be forgotten. I hope your family can take some small consolation knowing that your LE brethren will never forget you. Rest in peace always.\n\nDetective Cpl/3 Steven Rizzo\n\nDelaware State Police (Retired)\n\nRest in peace Trooper Bryant.\n\nRabbi Lewis S. Davis\n\nI have waited a long time to comment on this. I remember Trooper Bryant asking for a bite of my cheeseburger from Sonic when my mom was going through his roadblock at the 41 bypass in DeQueen Jerry Green was there I was about 10 years old and had always wanted to be a policeman. I remember him leaning in on the passenger side (my side) very nice man. I have been an officer for 23 years now and I still remember how professional and nice he was. I try to treat people like he treated me and my mom that evening.\n\nDeputy Todd Tallant\n\nHoward County Sheriff's Dept.\n\nI am Remembering you, Louis and all my other Law Enforcement friends, brothers and sisters in Law Enforcement and the families of each of you that departed or were taken from our brotherhood. I am retired now, body intact but worn out as is the old mind and memory. I review and reflect back on the job and all of my friends and family that are not physically with us anymore. You will remain a part of many, many lives that you touched, changed or protected during your service to your family, friends, departments and the citizens of your city, county and or state. Your still live in those changed lives and all of our Memories.. Thank-You..\n\nCaptain (Retired) Paul \"Steve\" Watson\n\nDeQueen Arkansas Police Dept. (and Others)\n\nWe're thinking of you on this day. Our prayers are with you, your family and your fellow Troopers. Thank you for your service to Arkansas. God bless\n\nSpecial Agent-in-Charge Diane Upchurch\n\nFBI - Little Rock\n\nLouis, We are talking about and Remembering you. You are not forgotten, but remembered with an open and lovely heart.\n\nCaptain Paul \"Steve\" Watson (Retired) DeQueen AR. Police Department\n\nJacksonville AR. PD, Ashdown AR. PD, Foreman AR. City Marshall, DeQueen AR. PD\n\nTrooper Bryant. Thank you for your service. My heart tells me God has punished the coward who WRONGFULLY took your life. My heart also tells me you were a good and faithful man and trooper.\n\nJosh Holcomb\n\nnone\n\nTrooper Bryant was a graduate of Fayetteville High School class of 1965. We will be having our 50th reunion this week. Special remembrance will be made of Trooper Bryant in a remembrance ceremony for all those in our class who are gone. So many times our classmates have remembered Louis P. Bryant for the good person he was.\n\nChris Thurston\n\nHigh School Classmate\n\nTime may have passed but you are not forgotten. I believe as long as someone remembers you or speaks your name, you are still with us.\n\nThank you for your heroism.\n\nGOD Bless\n\nDetention Officer A.Zambito\n\nTexas\n\nI was a young nurse at a local hospital when Trooper Bryant would bring in folks under suspect of DWI. I was always impressed as to his professional manner. He took his job to heart did his best to protect and serve. Over the years in the medical profession I have had the privilege of dealing with numerous offices of many different branches of law enforcement. Trooper Bryant still stands out in my mind !\n\nDeborah Johnson Jordan\n\nnurse\n\nWe think and talk of Louis and his family less than we did in the past and that is a shame! I have too many law enforcement friends that have died, been injured or killed and we tend to remember but draw away from them and talking about it. This in not out of disrespect but out of the pain of the loss we all share and the knowledge how fast it can happen to any of us.\n\nI remember that day all too well. The report of an officer down. The wild hunt for the shooter then the shoot out with the offender as he tried to kill more officers. The relief of that person being shot and taken into custody. Next was the loss of 4 more officers killed as they went to pay respect at Trooper Louis Bryant's funeral. One man destroyed so many lives with his criminal action.\n\nWe will remember Trooper Louis Bryant, Arkansas State Police..DeQueen AR. Police Department: Captain William Mills, Patrolman Herman Jones, Patrolman William Gilham, and Sergeant Roy Brewer.\n\nYou are remembered !\n\nCapt. (Retired) Paul \"Steve\" Watson\n\nDeQueen Police Department (Retired)\n\nI was an EMT, and a deputy in Little River County at the time, and worked the accident..........I remember it like it was yesterday!!! It was a sad day for DeQueen Ar, and Ashdown!! I also fished several times with Louis......RIP my brothers!!!!!!\n\nRusty Book, EMT..Deputy\n\nLittle River County\n\nI remember this like it was yesterday. This was horrible. I was a reserve deputy sheriff at the Pulaski County Sheriff's Department just starting my career in law enforcement and praise God, I am still doing what I love. As I recall, the 4 officers were either going to or coming from the funeral and their wives were in the vehicle behind them and a truck jack-knifed and hit the officers vehicle and all 4 were killed. God bless the families of these four officers and of Trooper Bryant, especially at this time of year when we reflect back and remember people from the past both alive and gone on to be with the Lord. Please, let's all be safe out there and go home to our families at the end of our shift. God bless the peace makers.\n\nSenior Patrolman Donnie Meaders\n\nWewoka (OK) Police Department\n\nTo fully appreciate the heroes of the present, we must recognize our heroes of the past. Your heroism and service is honored today, the 28th anniversary year of your death. Your memory lives and you continue to inspire. Thank you for your service. My cherished son Larry Lasater was a fellow police officer who was murdered in the line of duty on April 24, 2005 while serving as a Pittsburg, CA police officer.\n\nTime never diminishes respect. Your memory will always be honored and revered. Rest In Peace\n\nI pray for the solace of all those that love and remember you for I know both the pain and pride are forever.\n\nPhyllis Loya\n\nMom of fallen California Officer Larry Lasater, Pittsburg PD, eow 4/24/05\n\nI am watching your story on \"The FBI Files\". Thank you for your service, you are a true Hero. RIP\n\nSergeant Bill Clock\n\nAnn Arbor, MI Police Dept.\n\nWant even more control of your Reflection?
