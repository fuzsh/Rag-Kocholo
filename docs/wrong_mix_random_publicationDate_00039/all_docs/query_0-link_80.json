        "text": "Who Did Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs Date Before Getting Together?\n\nIt’s no secret that Becca’s had a tough go with love in the franchise. First, the “Bachelor Happy Hour” host was engaged to former Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr.\n\nLess than two months after their engagement, Arie broke up with Becca to pursue a relationship with runner-up Lauren Burnham. Arie and Lauren later married in 2019 and share kids Alessi, Senna and Lux.\n\nAfter her relationship with Arie went kaput, Becca starred as the leading lady on season 14 of The Bachelorette. During the season finale, she and winner Garrett Yrigoyen got engaged.\n\nAfter two years together, Becca announced her split from Garrett. “I don’t think it’s going to come as a shock to anyone, but Garrett and I have decided to end our engagement,” she said during a September 2020 episode of her podcast.\n\nAs for Thomas, he appeared on Katie Thurston‘s season of The Bachelorette. During episode 4, Katie sent Thomas home after accusing him of being there for the “wrong reasons.”\n\nEven so, Becca didn’t know much about Thomas before meeting him on Bachelor in Paradise.\n\n“I had only seen, I think, the first two episodes of Katie’s season — it was before things got really bad for him,” the ABC personality admitted on “Talking It Out With Bachelor Nation.”\n\n“It was kind of like this weird mind [f—k], if you will because I was getting to know him for him on that beach and seeing how he interacted with everyone and seeing how everyone got along really well,” Becca continued. “And then when I would watch the show, I’d be like, ‘This isn’t what I’m seeing, what’s going on here?’ It was really, it was, like, this weird warp in my mind.”\n\nAre Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs Engaged?\n\nTo date, they haven’t shared an official timeline on when they are planning to get married. However, Becca and Thomas love gushing over each other on social media!\n\n“Soaking in this life. I’m working on being much more grateful for all of the little, special moments that make up daily life, and this weekend was abundant with them,” Becca captioned a series of sweet photos with Thomas via Instagram on January 17.\n\n“I feel safe with you. As if nothing could ever go terribly wrong … Thank you for being someone who I can put my trust in, someone who would never hurt me, someone who would never push ‘us’ away,” Thomas wrote via Instagram in October 2021.\n\nIn May 2022, Becca revealed via Instagram that she had proposed to her man.\n\n“In the ultimate plot twist … HE SAID ‘YES,’” she gushed in her caption. “We’ve been keeping this secret just between us and close family and friends for a while but we’re so excited to shout it from the rooftops! I finally found my chauffeur for life and the one who makes my heart smile every single day. I can’t wait to do it all with you Tommy, thanks for making me the happiest gal alive. I love you to the moon and back.”\n\nDo Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs Want Kids?\n\nBaby speculation began after the “Game of Roses” podcast claimed in May 2022 that Thomas said he and Becca were “trying to get pregnant” during a Bachelor Live On Stage performance in Los Angeles. “Literally, Becca says to the audience something like, ‘You didn’t hear that,'” the podcast claimed, adding that the interaction was “bizarre.”\n\nHowever, Becca seemingly shut down the rumors by commenting, “This is news to me!” while Thomas tagged his girlfriend and jokingly responded, “I’m pregnant.”\n\nAs of August 2022, Becca and Thomas seem happier than ever, regularly posting loved-up photos together on social media.\n\nNearly one year later, however, the couple confirmed that Becca was pregnant and expecting their first child.\n\n“Party of [five] coming September 2023,” the reality TV personality captioned an Instagram post in April 2023. “Little Bebe, we can’t wait to meet you, hold you and watch you grow. We already love you to the moon and back — mom [and] dad.”\n\nThomas revealed that Becca gave birth when he took to Instagram on September 23, 2023, to share a photo of a door mat outside of their home that reads, “Baby sleeping, please don’t ruin this for us.”\n\nBecca also shared the happy news by reposting the photo via her Instagram Stories. “Soaking in all of the love and snuggles for the time being but we have a new little pumpkin,” she captioned the picture."
