        "text": "The highest peak in Morgan and Davis counties - Thurston Peak - was officially named Monday in a special ceremony on the previously unnamed 9,706-foot-tall summit that straddles the counties.\n\nA permanent monument of Utah granite has been erected on the peak with a brass plaque, encased in concrete, that reads:\"Named in honor of Thomas Jefferson Thurston, a Centerville resident who viewed the virgin valley of Morgan from the summit of the mountain in 1852 and recognized its potential for colonization. Realizing its disadvantage was its inaccessibility, in 1855 Thurston influenced others to assist him to carve a passible wagon road through Weber Canyon. He was among the first to settle in Morgan Valley and is acknowledged for bringing about its colonization.\"\n\nDuring the noon dedicatory program, Morgan County Commissioner Herb Crittenden and Davis Commissioner J. Dell Holbrook addressed the gathering of 44 people, and Max J. Evans, director of the Utah Division of State History, read a proclamation from the governor.\n\nDale Thurston, a descendant of the peak's namesake, also spoke, and Joseph H. Francis, a member of the Morgan Historical Society, gave a dedicatory prayer.\n\nThose gathered, who reached the peak by helicopter, horseback or on foot, sang \"America the Beautiful\" and \"Springtime in the Rockies.\"\n\nThe Army Division of the Utah National Guard airlifted the monument to the peak while The Morgan Jeep Patrol and Morgan Lions Club dug the hole for the marker.\n\nThe dedication culminated a five-month-long effort by the Morgan Historical Society to name the peak. The mountain is the tallest Wasatch range peak between Willard Peak on the Weber-Box Elder county line and Big Cottonwood Canyon in Salt Lake County."
