        "text": "Instagram\n\nEven when Bachelor Nation stars aren‚Äôt at the Bachelor Mansion or on the beaches of ‚ÄúBachelor in Paradise,‚Äù they still spend a lot of time together off-screen.\n\nAnd this past weekend was no different, with several Bachelor Nation stars getting together at the 2021 Blended Festival in San Diego, California.\n\nAbigail Heringer and Noah Erb stayed with fellow ‚ÄúParadise‚Äù couple Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs at Thomas‚Äô place in San Diego.\n\nThe two couples joined up with many of the other Bachelor Nation stars who live in San Diego, including Katie Thurston, Hannah Godwin, Dylan Barbour, Casandra Suarez, John Hersey, and more.\n\nInstagram\n\nOthers, like Blake Horstmann, whose home base is in Denver, also came to town for the festival.\n\nBlake took to Instagram and shared a group photo of all the Bachelor Nation stars at the event and poked fun at all the former couples now hanging out in a group. He hashtagged, ‚ÄúTry to make the dating tree on this pic.‚Äù\n\nMany fellow Bachelor Nation stars who weren‚Äôt in attendance took to the comments to show some love for the group.\n\nTahzjuan Hawkins wrote, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall are the cutest üòçüòç.‚Äù\n\nNatasha Parker commented, ‚ÄúThisüòçüòçüòç.‚Äù\n\nFans also wrote things like, ‚ÄúMost epic BN group pic ever!!!‚Äù and ‚ÄúExes on exes on exes üòÇ but I love that they can all hang.‚Äù\n\nOne person also tweeted about all the love triangles, writing, ‚ÄúSo Katie‚Äôs hanging out with her season‚Äôs villain Thomas, who is dating Becca, who almost got engaged to Blake, who liked Hannah G., who is engaged to Dylan.‚Äù\n\nAt least there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any hard feelings between the exes because the group hung out at the festival all weekend.\n\nAnd the couples weren‚Äôt afraid to show some PDA.\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nBecca shared adorable pics of her and Thomas, writing, ‚ÄúShould I start following him on the gram yet or what?‚Äù\n\nInstagram\n\nAbigail posted photos of her and Noah, saying, ‚Äú@noah_erb stole my look and my heart.‚Äù\n\nIt seems like love was in the air at Blended Festival, and it was great to see so many Bachelor Nation faves spending the weekend together!"
