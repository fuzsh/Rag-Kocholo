        "text": "Very happy to be speaking with Two Tribes about Hambrecht Ventures and Growth Science. You can hear their podcast interview with me here, or checkout the transcript below.\n\nSpeaker 1: On to today's podcast, we are joined by Thomas Thurston who is the MD of Hambrecht Ventures and the founder of Growth Science, welcome Thomas.\n\nThomas Thurston: Good to be here.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're both a seasoned investor and an entrepreneur, can you give us a bit of a summary of how you've got to where you are today?\n\nThomas Thurston: Sure, I think I'll start the story about ten years ago I was in Intel and actually was part of a group of people that thought we had an interesting product for Intel to commercialize. At the time we thought we'd live the best of both worlds, we thought, oh great, we can play entrepreneur and have all the freedom and excitement but do it with the safety and security of a big company and a big brand. We were still na√Øve enough to think it would be the best of both worlds, turned out it might be the worst of both worlds.\n\nWe raised a bunch of money and the product was actually a big success but about three years into it Intel shifted directions, got out of communications and our project, we were told ever so politely that we weren't going to be funded anymore. They really loved our progress and way to go, good job, no more money, good luck.\n\nThe business was ultimately spun out and acquired by a competitor but I stayed at Intel. I think, off the back of that experience I just thought it would be really interesting if we could better predict when these kinds of things were going to happen so you don't have people spending millions of dollars and staffing up big teams and spending years of their life on something that gets blindsided and shutdown.\n\nI've done external startups as well as corporate startups but that's where my story started. I had this angst and I thought, wouldn't it be neat if I could just put together a little data set of all Intel's product launches over the past twelve years. Get the PowerPoint decks and secretly sneak them into a share drive at the company and start to put a lot of those details in those decks into Excel and create a lot of columns and rows. Then I thought hey let me add all the acquisitions I can find that Intel's done, which is about a hundred over that period. Then all the venture capital investments I could find.\n\nI started building this database, that took a long time but once I had it, I sort of dusted off some old statistics skills I learned in undergrad and forgotten, but rekindled. Then just very quickly realized, actually the variables that we thought about the most in venture capital and at Intel, that you hear venture capitalist talk about externally really weren't that predictive of outcomes five, seven years later. There was no statistical correlation between these variables as far as I could tell in what happened.\n\nThe other cool thing though is I found, there were some other variables that we all knew but no one obsessed over that were much more predictive than anything else. The realization was holy crap, we might be focusing on all the wrong things. Intel had NDA's with Harvard and MIT and some other schools which gave me safe cover to go to some academics and say hey, I think we're actually finding patterns that are predictive of startup success. That can't be right so, tell me what I'm doing wrong and give me some criticism. Which they as you know people like that do, easily and quickly without reservations, but it was great.\n\nWe ended up making the research a lot better but realizing oh my God we have something here. Clay Christensen at Harvard at the time had spent some time with me and looked at my data with another professor over there. He said hey would you want to come out to Harvard for a year and work with me, and let's get you an office in the building at the business school and let's really expand and build up this research because the criticism at the time was well okay what you've found is neat but it's one company's investments. How representative is it really?\n\nWe spent the year at Harvard doing that, and really could aggressively expand the database and everything we were working on. That's where it started and then Christensen introduced me to this guy Bill Hambrecht who's this sort of very seasoned venture capitalist, he was in Intel, and Adobe, and Google, and Amazon, and SalesForce, all of them right? He was very, very successful venture capitalist, had a bank Hambrecht and Quist before that. At the time Christensen was on Bill Hambrecht's Bank at the time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: I didn't know who Bill Hambrecht was, but Christensen says oh you got to meet this guy Bill, you guys have a lot in common and I know you'll hit it off. I say oh sure, Bill sounds like a nice guy. I meet Bill and then I googled him and I was like oh, okay I better dress a little sharper next time I see him. Essentially we ended up collaborating and then when my year at Harvard was over Bill said hey, if you want to come work with me I would love to start some venture capital funds using your methodology to screen our deals. He had some funds that he'd already just gotten started with Christensen, involved in that methodology, disruption theory and all of that.\n\nI said can we really just take that and make it this quant venture capital fund? Because there was a lot in common between the patterns I was finding quantitatively and the stuff Christensen had been writing about for decades.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: He was already famous even back then. I left Harvard and ended up at Hambrecht Ventures in 2008, now we've done several funds over that time. I think the cool thing about Hambrecht Ventures is one, in hindsight I think we were the first quantitative venture capital fund. Then I think the other cool thing is performance wise while we can't talk too much about that, we can say that we're somewhere up in the top one or two percent of funds in Silicon Valley in terms of performance.\n\nI really think the reason the funds are doing so well is because we have a very different approach in that we're using statistics to manage the portfolio. Which you know is heresy in the world of innovation, it doesn't make me a popular person. It's okay as long as my investors are happy.\n\nThat's how I got into all of this. When we look at deals we pre-screen using computer modeling and statistical analysis, and then it usually ends up leaving a small number of deals that have very high odds statically and then we do qualitative and regular due diligence to reduce the list even further.\n\nSpeaker 3: Before we go into the detail on looking at deals and how you screen them, how you use the statistics, it be great to dig into your personal history a bit more. I hear that you're originally growing up in Honduras, Bolivia, India, Nepal, and Indonesia which is pretty diverse background. I mean how much of that do you remember and how much do you think that's shaped you as well?\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah well it was really formative, I moved to the states for first time, which my family is from the US, not until I think I was fifteen or sixteen. I had lived overseas that whole time, my dad and mom married after graduating University of Oregon and immediately went to the Peace Corps in Venezuela, and really spent the next few decades overseas. My sister and I were born along the way. He ended up working for USA ID so in the State Department and so I was one of those expat kids.\n\nIt's a wonderful experience and I think growing up, I don't really know, I can speculate to how that might have shaped me but I did realize everywhere you go, no matter where you go, you go to Kathmandu or you go to Oregon, or you go to New York, or you go to Sydney, everybody thinks that they have a point of view anchored in where they're from and their history. Everybody is so damn sure that they're right about how everything is, they're sure about that and you talk to them and can get bought into that and agree with them. Then you move somewhere else and they got the people having the exact same certainty about how they view the world and often these things are mutually exclusive. Wherever you go everybody's sure that they know the right way to do things. I think just hopping around you realise well, yeah but are they? You can't help but stop taking peoples word for a lot of things.\n\nI think for me when I was at Intel, just at the beginning of this research, the way everybody told you you were supposed to look at startups and innovations was all the same things you hear today at every panel and every ... It's all about the team and a gut feeling, persist, and learn - right?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: That's great, I'm not saying those things are bad but I remember thinking to myself at the beginning of this, well you know all these really smart senior grey haired people, they sit there and they espouse all this wisdom and they could convince anybody of anything. When you look at the history of innovation, 70-90% of innovations fail and have since Thomas Edison. If they're so damn good at this, why do they do so poorly and always have?\n\nI think it was being young and na√Øve enough to say well I'm not going to go down that path because the results suck. Is there another way? I think that's where, maybe I was born with too much self-righteous indignation.\n\nSpeaker 3: Intel's got a fascinating innovation story obviously, it came from doing memory and went into micro-processing, if my memory serves me correct.\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: Do people talk about the statistical side of that transformation from a purely memory company to a micro-processing?\n\nThomas Thurston: You know that was before my time of course in itself.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I think Bergelman at Stanford did the best analysis of this that I've seen of this transition. The way he put it and I'm paraphrasing so apologies Bob if you're on the podcast, it's really, Intel's factory ... Okay I'm going to really oversimplify. The FAB is essentially all integrated and it's designed to prioritize the most profitable project. Cost accounting is actually built into FAB allocation. What was happening is the DRAM was getting commoditized and the CPU which at the time was this tiny little market, actually had good margins and was becoming more profitable but lower volume. The FAB was sort of shifting over from DRAM to processing and the end effect the company sort of shifted over to micro-processing and the last holdouts to sort of understand this were the leadership.\n\nAndy Grove tells this story that he and I think it was Greg Barrett, when they finally realized oh my God what would do tomorrow? They were struggling with strategy, what would we do if we were fired and came in here tomorrow as brand new, what would we do? They said oh we would be a CPU company, they were like oh crap right? They had this identity crisis. They ceremoniously walked out of the office fired themselves and walked back in and somehow rehired themselves and announced. It wasn't strategy that led the pivot it was profit seeking.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I'll hijack that point, so the computer models we use to predict startup outcomes and corporate outcomes, we model these complex systems including customers, and competitors, and markets. What we do is we give all of the agents of behavior, which is to seek profits, and that's what brings order to the chaos. It's not just a swirling nexus of chaos, individual actors are profit seeking so you can often infer a lot about what the behavior is going to be with some accuracy.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, so what have been some of the variables that, without giving away any secrets, that surprised you or are counter-intuitive to the norm?\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah, I think I'll talk about what we found on the quantitative side which dovetailed into what we found out later with Christensen's work. I don't just rehash Christensen because everybody already knows all of his stuff, but the way I look at it is; if you think of my system that we have today as a software model, we put a bunch of companies and products in there and they all seek profits.\n\nSort of that Christensen-esque idea that, if you're a startup and you position what you have as better performance than anybody else; you're the best technology, you're the best service, or whatever it is, if you are inherently targeting the most profitable customers of all of the big incumbents that are already there; you are little, they're big and you're trying to take their food away from them, they have to fight. It's not that they're mean they just have to right?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: They're big, you're small - they win about 85% of the time. If you find a way to start as a startup in these beach heads that are less profitable relative to the mainstream or just off the grid that nobody cares about, where nobody is going to fight you for those customers, your odds can go five to six times higher even as a startup.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I think that's where we're looking for business models that are finding beach heads that nobody else wants; those can then translate into bigger markets overtime. If you say hey I've got this huge big total addressable market and our product is the best and we can prove it, I'm like thank you, next. You've immediately disqualified yourself from my ability to invest. Anyway ...\n\nSpeaker 1: From your time at Intel, Intel is probably arguably had one of the best corporate venture arms in the world. Today apart from some maybe recent headlines that are shifting, but do you think that their investments that they made actually made its way back into its core DNA of innovation? Or was it seen as more of a financial vehicle?\n\nThomas Thurston: I think at first Intel was, again I'm paraphrasing here, no one in Intel agrees on anything so just know that everyone's going to disagree with me, but from what I understand and this was just as I got there when this transition was happening/ had just happened. It was completely really strategic before, so in other words we're going to invest in anything that might someday drive microprocessor sales.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: I don't care if it's software, whatever, especially if it's really bloated bloatware that's going to take a ton of processing, we love that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: In fact, lean elegant code is not our thing. That was a pure strategic shift and then when Arvind Sodhani became head of Intel Capital, which was just before I got there, he really said look we have to have a dual mandate, which is both strategic and financial value. Now he's recently left Intel about a year ago as I recall, I'm not actually connected to the new leadership over there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\n\nThomas Thurston: I think to his credit he really did show financial performance in a way that corporate venture capital hadn't, and Intel became very known, for delivering good results in a portfolio.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I think you have to have a dual mandate because you get accused of different things when people are trying to cut your budget. Right? One day it's you're not strategic enough and you have to be like yes we are. The next day it's like oh yeah but you're not making any money and you have to say no no, we're making so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I think in theory you shouldn't have to take, play both, but in reality I think you have to defend your funds.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: Perhaps moving on from Intel a bit, talking a bit more about Hambrecht Ventures, outside of probably Silicon Valley very few people know about Hambrecht Ventures, there's little on your website. Is that intentional?\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah in fact I don't think Hambrecht Ventures actually has a website. I mean there's little about us on the Hambrecht, the bank.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah there's a little sub, yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: No we're a quiet fund, it's intentional. We don't have a website, we have a small group of investors that's been with us the whole time that continues to reinvest. As we raise subsequent funds the returns have been good so that's been, so it's a very quiet captive thing basically and it's working and so nobody's going to muck with it.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I think we've been really lucky to be able to do that in part as well because Bill Hambrecht's networks are just unreal. When we do want deal flow it almost seems like, I don't know, he pushes a little red button and boom, right there it is. Then we have, then he turns it off very quickly and it seems like, I think if deal flow was more of an issue which, you know, he's all but retired now, he's 81 years old, we all hope he would do that with, which is he does the fun stuff but he doesn't do the stuff he doesn't like to do. I think that we can't always lean on his networks.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: We have so far.\n\nSpeaker 3: Just that model contrast to say the Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs of the world out there spruiking a lot. Is it about deal flow or is it about finding the deal that no one else found?\n\nThomas Thurston: I'm not the norm, because we use a quantitative method. I look at the world and I'm looking for clusters of variables that our algorithms like. I don't categorize things in terms of industries, it's just where are, and we find that companies with those variables have much more in common with each other than they do with their industry peers.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: It's a global marketplace, I don't think of it as geographically limited. We do deals in Silicon Valley but that's just if we see them. All things being equal I'd rather do a deal in a second or third tier market outside of the valley, because there's just tons of deals everywhere. Our most successful deals at Hambrecht, one is Israeli backed founders in the US, but in the other two are in China, in terms of our big ones.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: It's funny, someone asked Bill once when he was here in Sydney, they said Bill do you have any experience in Asia? He's like well not a ton, I mean we've been doing deals here for a while, I think when I came here in 71' we're like oh brother yeah, so you have more experience. Oh okay you've been here since the 70s, alright never mind.\n\nHis networks are global as well and I think, I want to cherry pick the best. We sort of believe there's a ton of startups everywhere but there's really only a few startups that are really going to change things right? A few Googles, a few Facebook's, we want to look across the world and say look where can we cherry pick those deals? We can look much more aggressively across geography because we're using algorithms to screen.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I don't have to go set up shop in Taiwan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nThomas Thurston: I can just get the data about companies. If I want to find out what deals are might be or might not be in Idaho, like that whole state without a lot of venture capital, I can go on Crunch base, I can pull every company in Idaho and I can run them through in about a week and decide if I want to call one or two of them.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: It's just that it's a really different shift. I think what algorithms do is it takes away, it's a totally different game in terms of labor intensity.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: That frees us up to be much more mobile and nimble than more of a traditional approach that's much more hands on.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you think that the, you know the current view to getting portfolio returns for a fund is find the one that pays back the other nine failures. Obviously your approach hopes to not find as many failures by default. Do you think that approach is kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy for some funds? By scatter gun approach hoping for just the one to save them from the other nine that may not work out?\n\nThomas Thurston: I think if your assumption is you can't predict them, then you need to cover the spread.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: Right, because all of the data says look if you do more than twenty deals you'll make pretty good returns. Okay, right twenty small deals, that is really early really small, or more, that's sort of the threshold. If you're brave enough to think well maybe we can actually do better, not perfect but better at finding the deals, I still think since we use probabilities we have to do lots of deals because I think the margin of error is something I'm very conscious of. If we predict a business is going to work out to be investment worthy, we're right about two out of three. We're wrong a third of the time which is great, that's a great track record. That means if I only did ten deals, six of them could be in the margin of error just by bad luck right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: If I do a hundred deals then I feel really comfortable going to bed at night saying at least sixty to seventy will be okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: With probabilities like a casino you just have to keep playing and playing. I have a kind of, I do like the idea if you can find small companies early and to do enough deals to make the odds work for us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I think I like that approach, I think it pencils out really well. You know just covering the spread because, I think it's tough because VC's on the one hand they'll tell you you should invest with us because we know how to pick them. Then on the other hand they'll tell you yeah but we're just going to invest in as many things as we can because we don't know how to pick them. You're almost standing there in the first part of the meeting and the second part of the meeting didn't agree with each other. You're like well just tell us which one you are, right? I guess whichever gets you funded.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nThomas Thurston: Maybe we all get a little guilty of that, myself included.\n\nSpeaker 1: Since you love numbers so much, of the third that don't work out that you pick, have you found a common trend in that bucket?\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah I mean I think the three big blind spots for our models are, one is we don't have any insight into technical risk which is if the product will physically work, will it actually cure cancer, will it actually ... We're blind, when we model a thing in out statistics we have to assume it works as stated. Now as a practical matter that's fine and if the odds are really high and it's a deal you want to do you have to due regular diligence and often we're talking to technical experts, we're looking for data. Like any other VC we're like okay, how are we going to convince ourselves this does or doesn't work? We don't have any magic sauce.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nThomas Thurston: The other thing we're pretty blind to, or don't, haven't automated I should say is the user experience issue, like will a human buy this product? Find it delightful or whatever, we can't automate that yet so same thing, we have to assume people will buy it but if we get down to diligence then we're looking for all the things, anything from Mitford Motor Score to Kickstarter or anything, just to show us if people will buy this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: Prove it to us. The third blind spot is in some countries that are very state controlled markets where it's not pursuit of profit deciding the survival of the fittest, we get in trouble because then our models assuming a condition of competitiveness that may not be there. Like I said we've done deals in China and what have you, lots of markets that are, and lots in healthcare so regulation is something we're used to but sometimes if that's all that matters, we can't predict which Minister in China will approve what thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: If I had that I would be a whole different thing. That's where we get stuck.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 3: Did it surprise you that there was such little data driven decision making being used in the VC community? It feels a little bit like Moneyball in a way where you look at baseball it's all stats and someone comes around with this statistical way of proving. Did it feel like that for you?\n\nThomas Thurston: It still feels completely bazaar to me, it is Moneyball.\n\nSpeaker 3: You see it in Michael Lewis books.\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah but isn't it weird? Okay it's one thing to look at baseball or some ... If you think about it this is actually just resource, this is asset allocation. Putting money into investment vehicles, in exchange for securities right? I mean name one area of risk management that doesn't use math, and there aren't any except for the trillions of dollars spent in venture acquisitions and organic growth. Unless you hire Deloitte of course. Aside from, present company excluded right. Yeah it's weird, I mean I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 3: Seems strange.\n\nThomas Thurston: I am a little gobsmacked even after doing this all this time, like how can it possibly be that nobody's quantifying and managing risk when it comes to growth investing?\n\nSpeaker 3: What do the naysayers say about you?\n\nThomas Thurston: A lot more probably when I'm not in the room. Look no, I think the first, when people hear the elevator pitch, oh here's this guy using algorithms to predict innovation, that's how it ... Everybody's first reaction is that's got to be bullshit right? Skepticism is the first, and that's okay, right that's all right actually. I'd feel the exact same way if I heard, that is completely natural and reasonable that doesn't offend me. Then the burden is on me to say look, we can either, we either have the results in the data or we don't and that's all fair game and that's fine.\n\nI think some people don't want this to happen, in other words it's not a question of fact, it's not a question of whether or not it actually works, it's irrelevant. It's that there's some camps that they've risen to their status in their job, I mean if you're a big VC and you're there and you're making money and you feel like a captain of industry and you've got MBA's lap dogging all around you, you feel like you're there because of your eye, your gut, your experience, your ability to see that startup and find that winner. The idea that some punk kid with a laptop could actually do better than you is not a comforting thought right?\n\nThere's a lot of that it's not that they don't think it's true, it's that they don't want it to be true. They're not afraid that my stuff doesn't work, they're afraid that it does work.\n\nSpeaker 3: Does work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I think, you know I think that the reality is going to be a lot softer and I mean I don't think we're just, quants are going to show up and put VC's out of business. I mean I think the future of venture is going to be similar, not the same but to how quant ended up in Wall Street, it used to not be a quantitative field right? Now you use some quant and some qual and every fund's got a different mix and some of them work and some don't. I think that's going to be the future, I don't think we have a monopoly on how to predict the future, there's probably an infinite ways you could predict the future right?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: How it moves, but I will throw my sword in the sand and I say look I think in the next ten years the use of data and analytics is going to separate the great funds that can continue to perform great and sort of the ones that just get lucky once in a while, just happen to be in Facebook.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nThomas Thurston: Oh, and didn't do anything right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: You know, I mean, so I do think consistent performance is the challenge for venture capital. There's only a tiny handful of funds that have kept good performance over time. I think if you just think of analytics as an ability to see insights that others don't see, you know the smart funds will be able to see more than their peers. It's going to happen, and we're already seeing some funds show up that are clearly quantitative but that's very rare. Then because we harvest data for a living at Hambrecht, we've seen some big funds very quietly trying to hire some data scientists.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: We get notified right away so. Which tells me it's a good thing though, it's like they're going to give it a try.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: They may be a little late but better late than never.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I would of thought that Google, who uses data for everything they do including what food they serve at their canteen, would've tried to use this approach in Google Capital, Google Ventures, or Google X. Have they ever reached out to you to try and use your method in what they do?\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah we have a great relationship, Bill did their IPO right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I mean there's a long great relationship with Google and Hambrecht and all this, and I have a lot of respect for those guys over there. I wish I had their brain power and their budget and their toys, and I never will.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who doesn't?\n\nThomas Thurston: No, you know I think at the beginning they knew that they could see things that others couldn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: They started to do that for some of their deals, but I think it was very much the old sort of intuitive style of investing but they could see a few things, it was more like some dashboards or some feeds that helped. I think they've been really working on that hard and now that it's formidable, they really have data scientists focusing on what we do and sort of how can they find insights and use predictive as well as descriptive analytics and the whole lot.\n\nI think today they're a legitimate force in this movement. I think probably the most well equipped pioneers out there. Now there's some other great ones too, I mean there's Link Ventures which is some folks out of MIT over by Kendall Square and they have a small fund that's been really successful and is now raising a lot more money.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: Really respect their work, what's interesting though the way Google models things, the way Link Ventures does, the way we do, and some others, they're all very, very different models. It's even so different that we don't mind being collegial and helping each other. They're just so different that it doesn't, it's not that threatening. Again the world can tolerate a lot of models.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: Honestly I think that if I'm going to invest in a deal that looks good in my models and I know that Google or Link Ventures or both also analyzed that deal and they also like that deal, like I am so sold right? If it's good enough to survive all those models it's going to be a hell of a deal right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: You know what I mean? It's actually a nice thing, it's a positive. That's where the world is right now, maybe it will get nasty in twenty years but right now it's awesome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: At one point, everyone's talking about artificial intelligence, I'm sure you hear it all the time. At what point does this become something that's more about an automated deal flow machine learned deal flow, or even predicting where are areas that there should be a deal that's not there?\n\nThomas Thurston: We do some of that in this company, this fund. Link Ventures, that is purely their thing. In other words they use analytics to find opportunities and then they staff them themselves.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: That's already here and we do that too, we have algorithms and modeling where we use it to find spots. We haven't staffed up companies but usually instead if we find a spot we'll try to see if there's somebody to target there, if not we'll move on. Link Ventures has this Cogo Labs which is an accelerator just to fill those spots.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: I mean it's, yeah, welcome, that world is here.\n\nSpeaker 3: It's right here, yeah, fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: What has brought you to Australia? Be it the last place that most people would expect you to come.\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah it was-\n\nSpeaker 3: You can't just say the weather.\n\nThomas Thurston: No it was a little bit of a shock, you know honestly we're working on some funds here in Australia. The team is strangely enough in Brisbane but the investors are mostly from Asia, and we're looking at startups globally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: It's no, geography wasn't part of the strategy there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I thought hey look they're all here so it can make sense for me to be here. The research firm where we do all this modeling and everything is run by Linda Ginger who also lives in Brisbane and is involved in the venture stuff. It does seem almost like coincidence that all the stuff was percolating and again, part of it was the weather. If you've lived in Oregon for 18 years one dismal dreary-\n\nSpeaker 3: Rains 280 days out of the year.\n\nThomas Thurston: You're like you know what? This is my chance.\n\nThat's the beauty, I don't think in terms of geography, because even in the states, I lived in Portland, Oregon and I worked from home. Hambrecht Ventures is in San Francisco which is just an hour away but I didn't, we're used to not having to, it's not about face time.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I mean they'll be, in the funds we're raising now they'll be four of us in Brisbane, Bill Hambrecht is on the board of those funds of course so he's in San Francisco. We have another general partner down in the Bay as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: Again, it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: A few late night phone calls still then?\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah but actually West Coast and Australia is totally fine, it's those East Coast, that just make me sad and I have to get up at five in the morning. That's the price of the weather. You know this more then I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: You've been here four months now, have you attended any of the startup events? Have you seen much of the entrepreneurial ecosystem here? What are your impressions?\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah we've met a lot of the great incubators and there's been some startup events we've gone too, getting to know the people both in government as well as in the investor community, and the startup community. I mean for me it's just, it's exciting to me to be out here because, maybe I'm just spoiled but the idea of raising another fund in San Francisco, you know it's just not that inspiring, it's starts to feel like work. It's like oh another one, we've already done that. Bill Hambrecht, he was there, like in 1968 he was part of the entire valley, he was part of that whole thing that became Silicon Valley from the beginning. It's there now and I don't know, I want to be part of something not just have a fund right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: Out here, this is the 1968 of this part of the world. Maybe it's a little later, maybe it's 75' already but it's, there's the big disruptions are coming from this part of the world and from Asia and from Australasia. That's where I want to be and that's where my next thirty, forty years are going to be. I want to be part of that growth and that's just personal more than, I mean it makes sense for business but to me that gets me up in the morning, it's like wow this could be so awesome. It won't be Silicon Valley, it's a different story that's playing out. Otherwise I feel like we're just another fund shoving startups into the Bay, like who needs it? You can have another Google in the Bay and no one would notice right, so what right? Anyway.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Last question before we go into a quick fire round, can you give some insight into what is a typical day actually look like for a VC investor? I'm sure most people think it's lots of coffees, sitting around, thinking about the future, you've outsourced all of that to a piece of code.\n\nThomas Thurston: Yeah, so do you want to say what my day or a typical VC's day?\n\nSpeaker 1: What your typical day would be. You can pick the best part of multiple days and ...\n\nThomas Thurston: You know I mean I would say I spend 90% of my time on the investor side of it. It's the raising and the babysitting of the money. I mean I think that's true for most funds, like you think we spend all our days listening to pitches and getting enthusiastic but it's like no, with any job there's a job hiding in the shadows which is you're dealing with your investors and their money. God I wish all I did was look at startups all day, that would be the best right? No, I mean that's it, the reality is it's all about money and getting the stuff done behind the scenes that's just not fun and it's just work. Then oh something comes up or a fund portfolio company has a new round and are you in or not? Or we have to review the docs and uh, that is, unfortunately that is it.\n\nOkay when we actually, for deals what we'll typically do is Bill will, he gets a lot of deals but the ones that he thinks kind of interesting he'll send to me and sometimes we'll actually sit there and entrepreneurs will pitch us like a regular VC. It's the same thing, we have thirty minutes to an hour, we'll hear a pitch, we'll get some PowerPoint. In that thirty minutes to an hour I can tell whether we should bother running it through the algorithms or not, because sometimes you can just tell, no they're going to hate this. I don't even have to run it, I can already tell it's out of spectrum for us. If that's the case you politely tell the founder why and what your philosophy is and how this is different, and then they usually find that really refreshing that you've given them a clear answer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: A lot of VC's just lead them on endlessly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nThomas Thurston: We tell them what we don't like and sometimes if they fix it they'll come back six months later and it's good, so it's okay right? Let's say you hear a hundred pitches over a month or so, or whatever time period, seventy of them are easy no's and then you take those thirty that might be interesting, run those all through our analytics so that's just time sitting with my team, part of the screen that's what we're doing. That's how we're spending time, it's not pretty, it's just sitting there clicking away. Let's just say ten of those thirty have really high odds, meet our thresholds. Then what we'll do is, Bill and I and some of the other partners will say okay which are our favorites? Which ones do we want to do? Let's do regular diligence. That's our work flow.\n\nYeah I mean it's, again I probably spend 90% of my time on other stuff, only 10% or less of the time on actual stuff that's involving startups. I wish it was the exact opposite.\n\nSpeaker 3: Fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: All right, well we're going to kind of common set of questions we ask everyone.\n\nThomas Thurston: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your most hated startup clich√© or piece of advice you've ever seen someone give?\n\nThomas Thurston: Oh God I'm going to burn in hell for this, okay so I hate that every VC, almost every VC, says it's all about the team. Right, just get the right people on the bus, we find statistically that the team only sways about 12% of the variance in outcome, so it doesn't explain 88% of it. Statistically you should never put 12% of your decision on the team, when every other VC puts about 50-90% of their decision on the team. I understand why and it's not an unreasonable intuitive thing to do, but the data actually says you need to weight that really differently.\n\nI get in trouble a lot because whenever I'm on a panel with other VC's, I always end up going last and they say what do you look for in startups? They say the team and everybody applauds, because I invest in people. Yeah that's a great answer, the next guys like I invest in people, I love people, if they're the right people, you know. It gets to me, the data guy right, and I've already got, I'm like well it only explains to 12% of the variance in outcome so we don't really look that much at the team because statically it doesn't matter. Then the other panelists give me the stare of death, sometimes they start arguing with me and they say like, you seem like a nice young man, which you know that the punch is coming right? That's like-\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, yeah\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: You know it's going to go bad as soon as you hear those words. They say something like I don't know about your data, but in my experience then they just start hammering you. Then if I've had too much coffee I'll go back. Never ask a VC what their accuracy is, unless you want to see them get red in the face, but anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good tip. If you could of changed one thing, what would it of been? If at all.\n\nThomas Thurston: Along this whole journey?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: You know I think, I think I started out way too self-righteous in that the models worked, it's like Moneyball, they work. We've done the level of vetting of a clinical trial for pharmaceuticals, we had done impeccable perfect, it worked. I felt like that should win every discussion right? Like it works, so give me the money, shut up, leave me alone, because it works and it's better. I wondered why that didn't go down very well. I think what I failed, in hindsight what I needed to understand is how can the models, whoever you're sitting across the table from, whether it's an investor or another VC, or startup, you've got to think how can this capability help that person become a rock star?\n\nIt's not about who's right or, it's how can this tool help that person get where they want to go? It doesn't always mean we can give them their money but if not we can give them advice, we can make it available to them. It's just been really in the last year, so that's how stupid I am, where I've realized it's not about who's right, it's about whether or not you're helping somebody. I know that sounds like a clich√©, but it really did take me too long to get over myself and realize that. I don't get nearly as many fights now as I used to, feels good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. What's been the best piece of practical advice you've ever been given?\n\nThomas Thurston: You know, I don't ... The first thing that came to mind which isn't exactly what you asked though, is I love working with Bill Hambrecht because he's one of the most successful people who's ever lived in his career. He's the most down to earth good human being, and what I like is I use him as a sounding board to find out really what I should get tied up in a knot about or not. In other words his experience which isn't data, is just so good for me. For example, the first thing when I started working with him was how do you do evaluations? I pictured like a hundred Deloitte Consultants on adding machines or something, like how do you get the valuation of the startup? He's like you know Thomas, he goes as long as it's reasonable who cares? He goes you know if you pick, if you're part of the next Google's A round, you know, and it's a fair deal just don't, just do it. I'm like wow, I was like I did not expect that answer. It's someone like that to say just you know, just don't sweat some of this stuff. There are some things you need to pay attention to but, so for me that's the first thing that occurred to me when you asked that question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's a good segue to the next one, so venture obviously was new to you as you shifted from what you were doing at Intel. What was some of the, other than Bill, a source of information that helped you get to where you are today in your career?\n\nThomas Thurston: Well we already mentioned Clay Christensen right? I mean I think he is also just a down to earth brilliant person, but just grounded and he's very, for all his accolades he's, there's no hint of pompousness about him, he's just genuine. He is a really good scientist it turns out, and I think Clay gets lumped in with gurus sometimes because he's been so well known. He does careful good empirical research. Now other people might take it and then bastardize it later, but like if you look at his work it is very, and he understands a scientific method and he follows it very closely.\n\nHe's the one who really, I mean of course I knew about the scientific method blah-blah, I got it. He put it into my fibre at the atomic level, like no you never get ahead of yourself, it's what's the step? What's the control group? What statistical a good fit? What's the hypothesis? How do you test it? I mean, so that has been ingrained in everything that I look at and think about in how we do our work or modeling. Clay's, that's not what I would have of expected to take away from all that work. I think he's really pushed that into my DNA.\n\nBill obviously for sort of the practical, like the reality. Bill starts a lot of sentences like, well in reality comma, and then he tells you what you really need to know. He does I know all that stuff seems important to you Tom, but in reality.\n\nThose are sort of my two biggest professional influences. Obviously I had great parents and they influenced me too, but everybody has great, lots of us have great parents. Anyway.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then last question, what's been your most unexpected source of inspiration for what you do?\n\nThomas Thurston: Oh, okay well you know it's what you said a little earlier, it's still amazing to me that people aren't using statistics when it comes to risk managing growth investments. I mean and that, I'm someone who tends to get positively motivated by being really pissed off right? If you make me mad I will spend the next ten plus years working on it. I think just realizing that people are guessing and it's not working and I'm not going to stand for it and I'm mad about that has fueled my whole career. I think it's positive, I don't wake up angry but it's like because nobody wins, my bumper sticker would say nobody wins when startups fail, right? By venture capitalists failing so much to pick good startups, venture capital doesn't get more money and so startups get less money. It's a destructive cycle.\n\nIf venture capitalist get better at picking winners, we will have better returns which means investors will give us more money which means startups will get more money. It's a virtuous cycle, if we didn't do our job right? To me that's, I'm angry because I think we need to live in a world where more businesses succeed. I think the idea that it's acceptable to have 90% of your portfolio fail is outrageous.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nThomas Thurston: I would like to get it to a coin top even, 50/50, that would be an incredible achievement for humanity right? Imagine if half of your startups actually succeeded, let's make that a goal that we can get excited about.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well thank you so much Thomas, it's been awesome.\n\nSpeaker 3: Thank you so much for your time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you both."
