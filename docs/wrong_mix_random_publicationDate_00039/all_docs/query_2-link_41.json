        "text": "ABOUT THE ALBUM\n\nDave Tucker says that he brought this disparate group of musicians together for a live performance at London’s Cafe Oto last March on “an educated guess,” predicting that the artists—Mark Sanders (Drums & Percussion), Pat Thomas (Piano & Keys), Dave Tucker (Guitar) and Thurston Moore (Guitar)—would be able to create something extraordinary through improvisation. The condition of their encounter would later become the collective’s name, an “Educated Guess” and the eponymous title of their first release, the first installment of a two-part volume. The album is another experiment in chance: an eclectic composition of spontaneous performance, layering guitars over complex, sometimes-scattered drum arrangements, and punctuating the noise with distinctive electronic manipulation. Demonstrating their different backgrounds, UK improvised music heroes Thomas and Sanders, already on a few 577 Records’ releases, join forces with UK-based guitarist Tucker (a longtime collaborator with The Fall, Dudu Pukwana, Louis Moholo) and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth to create something deeply inventive and experimental, pushing the boundary of noise music towards a complicated, dissonant electronica. The album, released online and on vinyl, will be available on April 2nd, 2021.\n\nDave Tucker, Pat Thomas, Thurston Moore, Mark Sanders\n\nEducated Guess Vol. 1\n\nDave Tucker - Guitar and Electronics\n\nPat Thomas - Piano & Keys\n\nThurston Moore - Guitar\n\nMark Sanders - Drums & Percussion\n\nRecorded at Cafe Oto, London, UK\n\nRelease: April 2021\n\nTotal LP time - 36:47\n\nCatalogue number 5833-1\n\nImage painted live by Gina Southgate\n\nGraphic design: Sergio Vezzali\n\nVinyl: Beautifully designed vinyl LP with printed inner sleeve\n\nDownload code included\n\nAlso, only available from us and the artist: Exclusive limited edition of 100 color LPs\n\nCD: Exclusive First Digipak CD Edition of 500\n\nTRACKS:\n\nSIDE ONE\n\nThe New Normal Part 1 16:34\n\nSIDE TWO\n\nThe New Normal Part 2 20:13\n\n100% of profit from the sale of most of these albums\n\ngoes to the musicians"
