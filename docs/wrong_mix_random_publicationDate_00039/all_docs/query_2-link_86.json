        "text": "Not only was grunge music influenced by hardcore punk but by New York punk. Chris Cornell explains that he was influenced by Television. To Patti Smith, Tom Verlaine`s signature guitar style sounds like “a thousand bluebirds screaming”. Whilst, The Guardian noted that Tom Verlaine is ‘‘a guitar antihero whose sensibility was more classical than Clapton’’. Soundgarden`s guitarist - Kim Thayil also was influenced by Verlaine and Television. Cornell explains that:\n\n‘‘Kim was influenced by Television a lot. And bands like Television are the reason I started playing guitar in Soundgarden. I started writing songs that had more than one guitar part, where it wasn’t just playing the same thing. There would be one colour part that would come in and out, or some rhythmic thing that would happen when the other guitar was doing its thing. That was directly influenced by bands like Television’’ (Sarig, 1998,p.180).\n\nChris Cornell also helped on Jeff Buckley`s album Sketches for my Sweetheart the Drunk (1998) which was co-produced by Tom Verlaine. Chris Cornell played a big part in this album. After Buckley`s death in 1997, Buckley’s mother, Mary Guibert, explains that Cornell helped her to navigate the music industry and get the album released:\n\n“Jeff hated name-dropping,” Guibert says, “Which is why Chris’ involvement in the project has surprised some people. Few people knew they were friends.”\n\nShe explained: “So everyone – the band, Chris – helped me to navigate the music business somewhat, and that was really important. They had impartial ears about what should and shouldn’t be released because, needless to say, my impartiality was shot”(Starkey, 2021).\n\nBuckley respected Verlaine and after working together Buckley knew that he should produce his next album:\n\n‘‘Verlaine was 17 years older than Buckley, who respected him almost as much as he did Patti Smith. When they met, Verlaine hadn’t released a solo record since 1992’s all-instrumental Warm And Cool, although he had recently composed the score for a film entitled Love And A .45. Verlaine’s reputation as a maverick must have impressed Buckley, because as soon as they connected during those sessions for Gone Again, Buckley decided that Verlaine should produce his next album’’(Apter, 2009, p.281).\n\nVerlaine and Buckley with his group did a recording session in the summer of 1996 and in February 1997. However, Buckley was not satisfied and decided that when the time was right Grace (1994) producer Andy Wallace should produce it. Nevertheless, the album was co-produced by Verlaine. Who is Tom Verlaine? Who is the musical genius who inspired not only Cornell, Thayil, Buckley but many more?\n\nDaniel Kane in his book Do You Have a Band?: Poetry and Punk Rock in New York City (2017) explains that during the mid-1960s and mid-1970s, the poetry-infused punk scene on the East Coast stood out as unique compared to other art communities in the US. For example with bands and artists like Patti Smith, Television, Neon Boys, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, Blondie, The Ramones, New York Dolls etc. It wasn't until the late 1970s and early 1980s that bands like Black Flag started incorporating spoken-word poetry, although they still maintained a bold and aggressive image.\n\nRock could be art (as opposed to \"craft\") without the moral responsibility and the more contradictions the better. Kane explains that there was definitely self-awareness and some knowledge of conceptual art. ‘‘These weren't culturati babes-in-the-woods, despite Johnny's and Joey's and Dee Dee's and Tommy's [The Ramones] matching leather jackets. Tom Verlaine once said that each grouping was like a separate idea, inhabiting their own world and reference points’’ (Kane, 2017, p.10). This is especially the case with Tom Verlaine who stands out from all of the punk bands.\n\nTom Verlaine actually known as Thomas Joseph Miller, took his stage name from the French poet Paul Verlaine. Whilst, Richard Lester Meyers was inspired by Arthur Rimbaud's A Season in Hell (1873), and transformed himself into Richard Hell. Both would form Neon Boys in 1972 with Billy Ficca on drums. In march 1973, the band regrouped recruiting Richard Lloyd as a second guitarist, changing the name to Television. However, in early 1975, Richard Hell left Television after a dispute over creative control. Thus, Verlaine took full creative control of the band.\n\nHowever, both would set the characteristics associated with the New York punk scene of the 1970s. Hell, quickly became a fashion icon of punk, having his hair spiked up and popularising the use of safety pins to hold his clothes together, inspiring the punk scene in England, as Malcolm Mclaren would take the aesthetic and fashion ideas from Hell and implement them in Sex Pistols’ styling. About Verlaine, Hell explains that:\n\n‘‘Tom was a wild card at Sanford. First, he was a day student, not a boarder, so he was less well-known. He was quiet and tense, but he made a lot of ghostly jokes. Most of the world seemed incomprehensibly weird to him, and he was susceptible to all kinds of irrational explanations for that, from things like flying saucers, to extreme conspiracy theories, to obscure religious mysticism. He knew that these beliefs, or suspicions, would seem crazy to a lot of people, and that was part of why he was so private’’ (Hell, 2013,p.39).\n\n‘‘He liked obsessive outsiders—artists whose works were made along patterns you could feel were viscerally, materially connected to the true wacky or hidden reality, because the works were made of the mind substance of people who couldn’t help themselves, because they were driven to create, even if unskilled by orthodox standards. And he liked the other side of that coin, namely highly gifted, hardworking, fully self-aware and sophisticated, worldly artists who nevertheless didn’t give a fuck about pleasing anyone or taking anything too seriously, and who were naturally subversive, and, in their own kind of purity, were incapable of doing bad work—like, in music, say, the original Sun Records musicians, or Link Wray, or pop artists just that wild, like the Rolling Stones in some of their earlier self-written singles, or Bob Dylan. And always there was the funniness of everything, or of everything that was interesting’’(Hell, 2013,p.40).\n\nUnlike the punk scene in England, poetry was always important in the New York scene. Before starting their musical career, between 1971 and 1975 both settled into bookstore jobs and lived around the East Village, New York. Verlaine and Hell under the under the pseudonym \"Theresa Stern’’ would release a poetry book Wanna Go Out? (1973). Hell recalls that:\n\n‘‘It was at this time, when we were both twenty-one, that Tom and I invented her. After we wrote that first “Ode to Mr. Sackin” poem, we kept writing poems together, usually late at night. It’s what we did instead of watch TV (we didn’t own one) when we were talked out and not wrapped up in reading. For me, it was stimulating. I liked doing it and it gave me thoughts and ideas. I liked the poems too’’ (Hell, 2013,p.100)\n\nRichard Hell has released eleven books (including I Dreamt I was a Very Clean Tramp(2013), Go Now! (1996) and more). Whilst, Verlaine and Patti Smith together wrote The Night (1976).\n\nTelevision would leave a big influence on artists like Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), William Duvall (Alice in Chains) who mentioned Verlaine as one of his ‘‘primary influences’’, U2, REM, Echo & the Bunnymen, Brian Eno and The Strokes. Here are some amazing songs from Tom Verlaine which show not only that he is a musical genius but a talented writer and lyricist.\n\nSouvenir From a Dream (1979)\n\nYou were living five lives in one\n\nTaking everyone's coat,\n\nWhy can't you show them\n\nWhat you've got in your cloak?\n\nCold hand on my shoulder,\n\nA star begins to beam,\n\nThat's when you show me\n\nYour souvenir from a dream\n\nEmpty handed, I awake,\n\nJust when I thought I had\n\nSo much at stake,\n\nSeems you've got something to say,\n\nWhy don't you say it?\n\nLittle Johnny Jewel (1975)\n\nTom had a twin brother, John Peter Miller (1949–1984), who died at age 34. John was addicted to heroin and eventually died from the disease. Verlaine’s twin brother perhaps is the inspiration for the Television song “Little Johnny Jewel”.\n\nHe's half-asleep at night\n\nHis head, sensation of flight\n\nDreaming\n\nHe wakes up dreaming\n\nHe run down onto the airport\n\nThe rush\n\nThe rush and the roar\n\nHe crouched down behind a fence\n\nA chest full of lights\n\nLittle Johnny Jewel\n\nHe's real cool\n\nIf you see him looking lost\n\nAin't gotta come on so boss\n\nKnow that he's paid\n\nPaid the price\n\nIf you see that little guy\n\nThe song was covered by Siouxsie and the Banshees on Through the Looking Glass (1987).\n\nThere`s a Reason (1981)\n\nWalking slowly into romance\n\nLions roaring by the entrance\n\nSaw you standing in my heartbeat\n\nCinderella with a new treat\n\nYou're my thrill, my dear\n\nBut I can't keep still I fear\n\nClose to zero, that is no cure\n\nThat ain't a reason I could go for\n\nBut you're the wonder that I follow\n\nAnd Heaven's preview starts tomorrow\n\nWords From The Front (1982)\n\nJanuary 23rd\n\nThere's no road\n\nIt's been raining now for three days\n\nWe're in mud up to our knees\n\nIf luck prevails and I'm given leave\n\nI should be home by the 17th\n\nOne word I hear all the time\n\nThis word I hear blind\n\nBlind\n\nJohn died last night, he had no chance\n\nBeneath the surgeon's drunken hands\n\nIt's hard to see who is about\n\nThe fires we light soon smolder out\n\nUpon the ridge they're dug in deep\n\nWe move in waves as if asleep\n\nAnd there they lay, 4000 men\n\nThe general orders, \"Attack again\"\n\nMarquee Moon (1977)\n\nI spoke to a man down at the tracks\n\nAnd I ask him how he don't go mad\n\nHe said, \"Look here, junior, don't you be so happy\n\nAnd for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad\"\n\nLife in the hive puckered up my night\n\nA kiss of death, the embrace of life\n\nThere I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon\n\nHesitating\n\n1880 or So (1992)\n\nO rose of my heart, can't you see\n\nI don't belong to misery\n\nThough she speaks fine with subtle art\n\nSuch misery clothes the rose of my heart\n\nNow what I see in the long twilight\n\nA star falls down on a hill so white\n\nOn a hill so white\n\nA face that glows in a golden hue\n\nNo-one in this world knows what they do\n\nI take my oath and I make my vow\n\nFor the tender things are upon me now\n\nIn the fragrance sweet of the evening air\n\nI could leave this world quite without a care\n\nJust like music, reading daily exercises the brain, improves sleep and reduces stress, so why not read some more?!
