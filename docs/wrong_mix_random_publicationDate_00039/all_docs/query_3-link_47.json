        "text": "There was no doubting Thomas – Redford Thurston's Marquie'l Thomas, that is – during the first quarter of Tuesday night's rivalry encounter pitting the visiting Eagles against host Redford Union.\n\nIn a game that would determine the owners of the coveted Redford Township traveling trophy for the next 12 months, Thomas scored 13 first-quarter points (and 16 overall) to power the Eagles to a resounding 76-37 victory.\n\nThe win improved the soaring Eagles to 14-1 overall and 9-0 in the Western Wayne Athletic Conference's Red Division.\n\nThurston will host Dearborn Heights Crestwood (8-1 in the Red) in a game that will determine the division champion(s).\n\nThe Eagles rolled to a 21-5 lead after one quarter before carrying a 41-12 advantage into the half.\n\n\"We were hitting our shots early – Marquie'l had three threes in the first quarter – which forced them to come out of their zone,\" said Thurston head coach Brian Bates. \"I thought we played very good team defense tonight. we were helping well and moving our feet.\"\n\nSenior forward Isiah Crofford scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for the winners. Also playing pivotal roles were Treven Gary (12 points) and Rickey Hudgens, who tallied seven steals.\n\nDeaunte Jackson contributed eight rebounds and three assists for Thurston, which made 10 of 17 free-throw attempts.\n\nJerrime Koger led the Panthers with 19 points. Anise Grady-Shelton chipped in with 10.\n\nGlenn stops Pats\n\nWestland John Glenn used a decided rebounding advantage to lift it to a 75-42 victory Tuesday night over host Livonia Franklin.\n\nJoe Chinavare led the Patriots with 11 points while Johnny Cantrell chipped in with eight.\n\nThe the Rockets' superior size was reflected in the number of times the two teams visiting the free-throw line: John Glenn, 22; Franklin, 5.\n\n\"We showed our age tonight,\" said Franklin head coach Jeremy Rheault. \"Glenn played very very well; the best I've seen them. Now that doesn't explain us shooting only five free throws to their twenty-two. Their rebounding absolutely crushed us.\"\n\nThe bright spot for the Patriots was a strong perimeter-shooting night as they canned 7 of 20 shots from beyond the three-point arc.\n\nSpartans victorious\n\nNoah Campbell scored 16 points to pace Livonia Stevenson's 68-57 victory Tuesday night over visiting South Lyon East.\n\nIan Knoph poured in 10 points for the Spartans, who also received eight point seach from Mike Muffler, JalenWebber and Jacob Dollar.\n\nStevenson led 16-10 after one quarter before the Cougars rebounded to take a 36-27 halftime lead. The Spartans regained the momentum after the break by outscoring their visitors 21-10.\n\nGC outlasts Trojans\n\nGarden City defeated host Livonia Clarenceville, 70-66, Tuesday night in a thrilling WWAC Red Division encounter that needed a four-minute overtime to decide.\n\nJermell Johnson led the Trojans with 25 points and James Hill added 17. Jake Kubiak scored nine for the hosts.\n\nHVL wins\n\nHuron Valley Lutheran defeated Lutheran Northwest, 63-60, Tuesday night. Details were not available as of Tuesday night's deadline.\n\nWarriors prevail\n\nLutheran Westland registered an exciting 48-47 victory Tuesday night over Taylor Baptist Park to improve its record to 6-6 overall and 4-3 in the Michigan Independent Athletic Conference.\n\nThe Warriors were led by Brent Croft's 16 points and Kory Barikmo, who contributed 14. Luke Smith was a beast in the paint, grabbing 16 rebounds to accompany eight points.\n\nAnthony Kaminski paced Baptist Park with 25 points.\n\n\"This was a battle tonight,\" said Lutheran Westland head coach Jim Hoeft. \"I am so proud of our guys for fighting the way they did.\n\n\"Cleve (Tarp) goes down in the first half with an ankle injury, Zach Anger gets elbowed in the lip (probably needing stitches), yet our guys fought and got a well-deserved victory. In the end we set up a play – one we have in our arsenal for end-of-game-situations – with about 10 seconds left. The guys ran it beautifully, and Zach got a bucket with under a second left for the win.\"\n\nTrojans rebound\n\nClarenceville avenged an earlier loss to Dearborn Heights Annapolis with a 51-46 victory in boys basketball Friday.\n\nThe key to victory was stopping opposing star Bryan Collins, who scored 38 points the last time the two teams met, according to Trojans coach Tony Paciero .\n\nA strong defensive effort by the team allowed for just that, he added. Led by senior Elijah Bean, Clarenceville held Collins to 13 points.\n\nOffensively, Jermell Johnson led the Trojans with 29 points and \"showed up in a big way rebounding,\" Paciero said.\n\nJames Hill added 10 points and was a force on the glass, too. Quintin Banks was efficient at point guard, handling pressure and knocking down a critical 3-point shot late in the game.\n\n\"It was a great overall team effort and a well-earned victory,\" Paciero said."
