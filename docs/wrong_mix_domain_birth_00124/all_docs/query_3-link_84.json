        "text": "A Chicago concert at the Pine Knob Music Theatre has become something different than when other acts play the 50-year-old venue.\n\n“This is the 82nd time we’ve played this place. I can’t believe that!” trumpeter and co-founder Lee Loughnane told a crowd of about 7,000 on Tuesday night, July 26, during the group’s show with Brian Wilson. That total makes Chicago the band that’s played Pine Knob the most — by a long shot — with an “and counting” implied.\n\n“You keep asking us back, we’ll keep coming,” Loughnane promised.\n\nA lot has happened to Chicago, as well as Pine Knob, since its 1972 debut at the venue, and for both the band and opener Wilson Tuesday’s show was something of a clinic in how aging acts morph and adapt over the decades, as well as perhaps a preview for how they maintain into the future.\n\nChicago performed without keyboardist, singer and co-founder Robert Lamm, whose absence was not acknowledged or explained during the nearly two-hour show. His vocal parts on songs such as “Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?,” “Saturday in the Park” and others were capably covered by Neil Donell and new bassist Eric Baines, it was still odd to see Lamm’s keyboard set up on a stage left riser without him playing it — a proverbial gorilla in the room that felt like a cheat mostly because it wasn’t addressed.\n\nAnd the missing member hammered in the ultimate and impending mortality that Chicago — now down to three original members, with Lamm, Loughnane and trombonist James Pankow — and any band of its decades-old ilk faces. There was even a moment during the early part of “Hard Habit to Break” when there wasn’t a musician on stage who had been with the band for more than five years.\n\nAt what point that kind of scenario makes Chicago its own tribute band or an acceptable evolution remains to be seen. But what can be said is that the 55-year-old group’s current incarnation is a strong one, ably representing the group’s abundant catalog with a precise, dynamic performance that powered through an inconsistent sound mix to touch on all eras of the band’s career. It began right at the beginning, as the nonet steamed into “Introduction,” the opening track on 1959’s “Chicago Transit Authority” debut album. As on record it was a showcase for Loughnane, Pankow and saxophonist Ray Herrmann, who quickly established that Chicago’s brassy front line was still a musical force of nature and the true star of the show.\n\nChicago smartly served up something for all fans throughout the night, giving the longtime die-hards the likes of the chops-flexing instrumental “Mongonucleosis” and the entirety of the “Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon” from 1970’s “Chicago II” (including the hits “Make Me Smile” and “Colour My World”) and even bulking up sappier 80s hits such as “Hard Habit to Break” and “Hard to Say I’m Sorry.” (But let’s try to forget the parade of cheesy, Hallmark Channel-worthy videos that accompanied many of the songs.) Chicago never went too long without a bona fide hit single, while “If This is Goodbye,” the single from its new album “Born For This Moment,” was well-received.\n\nThe band’s hot take on the Spencer Davis Group’s “I’m a Man” led to a lengthy percussion solo by Walfredo Reyes Jr. and Ramon Yslas, while guitarist Tony Orbrohta subtly put his stamp on “25 or 6 to 4.” The opening encore “Free,” meanwhile, was another extended romp — spotlighting Herrmann in particular — that gave every reason to expect an 83rd visit from Chicago in 2023.\n\nWilson’s nearly 90 minutes on stage, meanwhile, was another kind of balancing act. Since he began touring regularly in 1999, the genius behind the Beach Boys has presented his catalog with the help of a stellar and large (12 members) band that carefully captures the nuances of his studio creations. It’s been a successful enterprise, but on Tuesday it was undermined by some confirmation that time, and in Wilson’s case a legendarily hard life, ultimately catches up to all of us.\n\nThere’s no way to ignore that Wilson, who turned 80 in June, is in bad shape. While his youthful visage sat on the screen behind the stage, he struggled on and off the stage with a walker, and throughout the show he sat rigid and expressionless, barely acknowledging the audience or his band members but hopefully taking in the music and the exuberant reception for it. Wilson sang only a few tunes, and the standing ovation that greeted a tentative rendering of “God Only Knows” was mostly recognition of what a feat it was for him to get through the song.\n\nThe Wilson troupe was also uncharacteristically off in it last night on the road with Chicago, not playing with the command it’s displayed over the years and visibly battling some sound issues of its own. It was a testament to the strength of Wilson’s material — 19 beach Boys favorites and a cover of the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby” — that the show remained a singalong crowd-pleaser, and to the professionalism of the musicians that there were still some highlights.\n\nAmong those was anything Matt Jardine — son of original Beach Boy Al Jardine, who was also part of the show — sang, particularly “Don’t Worry Baby” and “Wouldn’t It Be Nice.” 70s Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin was not in particularly good voice but played stinging guitar solos during “Wild Honey,” “Long Promises Road” and “Sail On, Sailor,” and it was, as always, a treat to watch as well as hear the band recreate the sonic details of “Heroes and Villains” and “Good Vibrations.” A triplet of “Help Me, Rhonda,” “Surfin’ U.S.A.” and “Fun, Fun, Fun” ended the set on a high note, but the ebullience was still tinged with a bit of sadness as Wilson pushed off the stage."
