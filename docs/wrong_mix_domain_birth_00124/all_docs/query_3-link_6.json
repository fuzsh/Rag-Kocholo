        "text": "The Beach Boys in 1964 and Brian (second from left) at the height of their early fame. Photo: Getty Images\n\nAs horrified airplane passengers look on, Brian Wilson – the genius behind The Beach Boys’s sun-drenched sound – begins to howl, then screams out, “I can’t take it anymore!” Soon, he is lying in the plane’s aisle, his face crushed into a pillow, as he tries to muffle his misery.\n\nIt’s December 1964 and the band is on its way to play a show in Houston, Texas, but their troubled star can barely make it to the destination. At only 22 years of age, he has been crushed by a relentless recording and performing schedule, which has seen the band produce eight albums in just two years. But this public breakdown wasn’t a one-off warning to slow down the pace. For Brian, it was the first sign of a mental fragility that would drive him to find refuge in food, drink and drugs, and, ultimately, take him to the brink of madness.\n\nThat story – and his incredible renaissance – is the subject of a new biopic Love & Mercy, which is in cinemas now. The movie is more than another chapter in the Wilson myth. Filmed with the support of Brian and his second wife, Melinda Ledbetter, it’s an homage to their relationship, as well as to the enduring impact of his music. “When you listen to his recordings, you can hear him imagine virtually the rest of pop music for the next 30 years,” John Cusack, who plays Brian in the film, told Variety. “We take for granted all that music that’s in our DNA … for a large part, it was Brian.” The multi-layered vocals and complex music of The Beach Boys inspired many influential musicians, including The Beatles, while their 1966 album Pet Sounds is regularly named one of the greatest records of all time. The band has sold more than 100 million albums, and the Grammy-winning Brian has been rated both one of the greatest producers and singers in music history.\n\nPaul Dano as Brian Wilson in the film Love & Mercy\n\nBrian Wilson was born on June 20, 1942. He and his two younger brothers, Dennis and Carl, were raised in Haw-thorne, California, by his mother Audree, a homemaker, and father Murry, a frustrated songwriter who worked for a gas company. Murry was a violent, domineering drinker who reputedly caused his oldest son to go deaf in one ear after beating him when he was\n\nonly six. The brothers took to singing harmonies in their room to placate their music-loving father and began performing with their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine at high school.\n\nTheir big break came in 1961, when Audree and Murry went away for the weekend, leaving the boys home alone. The brothers, Love and Jardine took the emergency money they’d left – plus $300 given to them by Jardine’s mother – and used it to rent instruments to rehearse what would become their first single, “Surfin’” (ironically, Dennis was the only one to ever hit the waves). Murry was furious – until he heard the song. Excited by its possibilities, he insisted on becoming the group’s manager and helped secure their first record deal. “He was like our coach,” Brian has said. “He scared me so much, I actually got scared into making good records.”\n\nThe sunny surf-and-car songs of The Beach Boys were an instant success, led by Brian’s artistic vision. “He was obsessed, almost dictatorial, and he had a clear idea of what he wanted the music to say,” Jardine tells marie claire. “We’d gather round the piano and Brian would hand out our vocal parts. When we sang them back to him, he would hear the sound that was in his head, like we were a human tape recorder.”\n\nThe Beach Boys in 1974, with Brian bottom left.

In 1966 and 1967, they were voted Best Vocal Group (ahead of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones) by readers of influential British music magazine NME.\n\nBut soon, Brian’s musical control was overshadowed by his father’s bullying of him and the rest of the band. Murry imposed strict curfews, fining them for swearing and insisting they were neatly turned out at all times. He was ever-present in the studio, too, demanding they sing songs repeatedly to get the perfect take. “In some ways, I was very afraid of my dad. In other ways I loved him because he knew where it was at,” Brian later recalled. “My dad blew my mind.”\n\nSoon, Brian was affected by more than just his father’s demands.\n\nIn 1962, he met Marilyn Rovell, who was 14 (Wilson was 20 at the time). They married when she turned 16 as Brian sought stability amid the frenzy of The Beach Boys’s early success. It wasn’t to be. Around that time, a friend gave Brian his first joint. Not long after, he took LSD for the first time. “At first, my creativity increased more than I could believe,” he told journalist Alexis Petridis. “On the downside, it fucked my brain.”\n\nBrian with first wife Marilyn.

Over the next few years, as he began using harder drugs, including amphetamines, cocaine and heroin, his behaviour became increasingly bizarre. He would gorge on steak and ice-cream; he built a sandpit below his piano so he could feel the “beach” under his feet; he had a tent installed in his living room to hold meetings in; and held conferences in the deep end of his swimming pool, so the conversations couldn’t be bugged. While recording the album Smile, he insisted all the musicians wear toy plastic fire helmets. Afterwards, he noticed a rise in the number of fires in LA and, concerned his music had caused them, destroyed the tape of the session.\n\n“The band as a whole got into a lot of drugs,” recalls Jardine. “But Brian was very vulnerable to their effects and it became a crisis.” This time, from the mid ’60s to the late ’70s, came to be known as Brian’s “recluse years”, as he pursued his increasingly uncommercial – but now critically lauded – music. The band remained intact (except for Brian’s continued absence) and carried on recording and touring without him. Instead, Brian opened a health-food store named The Radiant Radish – largely at odds with his own state of health (he could be found behind the counter in his dressing-gown, hugely overweight, greasy hair hanging around his shoulders; the store closed in 1971).\n\nHe had therapy and spent periods in psychiatric hospitals, but little seemed to help the troubled star. By then, he and Marilyn had two daughters, Carnie and Wendy (who would later have their own musical success with their band Wilson Phillips). “My memories of him are him wandering from room to room. Who knows what he was thinking in his head?” recalled Carnie in the documentary titled I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times. “Mum would say, ‘Your father’s not like other dads. But he has this gift, and no-one will ever be able to take that away.’”\n\nEventually, life with Brian became too much for Marilyn, who divorced him in 1979. Wilson descended further into drink, drugs and depression, until one day he disappeared altogether. He was found days later in a bar in San Diego, playing piano for drinks.\n\nBrian at home in Los Angeles in the 1970s. Photo: Getty images\n\nIn 1975, Brian’s family and Marilyn had engaged controversial psychologist Eugene Landy, who had a reputation for treating Hollywood’s most dysfunctional stars (Alice Cooper and Richard Harris were previous clients). Landy wrongly diagnosed Brian as paranoid schizophrenic, treating him with huge doses of psychotropic drugs that actually worsened his mental condition.\n\nLandy employed a team of assistants to keep his patient under 24-hour surveillance and put him on a punishing regimen of diet, exercise and work; humiliating him in public and bribing (with a burger or joint), or threatening him (with a baseball bat) to sit at the piano and write so Landy could benefit from any new hit music. It’s these years that are the focus of Love\n\n& Mercy.\n\n“We were sucked into a vortex with that man,” admits Jardine. “He was extremely aggressive in his treatment of Brian and calculating, assuming the role of manager and director of Brian’s life.”\n\nIn 1976, Landy was fired by the family in a dispute over his fees (he charged $35,000 a month), although he was re-employed in 1982 when Brian slipped back into drug use. This time, Landy’s regimen was even more radical – he isolated Wilson entirely from his family and friends. “I live in a strange hell. I’m a prisoner and I have no hope of escaping,” Brian told a musician at the time, according to biographer Peter Ames Carlin in his book Catch A Wave: The Rise, Fall & Redemption Of The Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson (Rodale).\n\nDesperate, Brian reached out for help whenever he could. “In 1986, I was working in a car showroom when Brian came by with Eugene to buy a car,” recalls Melinda Ledbetter to marie claire. “Brian slipped me a note that said, ‘Scared, frustrated, alone’. I felt sorry for him and also curious, so when Eugene called me and asked me to go on a date with Brian, I said yes. Brian was just this gentle soul and he had an air about him; I wanted to know more about him.” They dated for three years.\n\nJohn Cusack and Elizabeth Banks as Brian and Melinda in the film Love And Mercy.\n\n“We mostly went to musical events choreographed by Eugene,” says Ledbetter. “We were like teenagers, tiptoeing around the disapproving parent.” Then, in 1989, threatened by their closeness, Landy cut off all contact between the pair. “It was just awful,” she remembers sadly. “From time to time Brian would call and tell me how lonely he was.”\n\nDesperate to help, Ledbetter contacted Brian’s mother and brother Carl to explain the level of control Landy had (including persuading Brian to change his will to make him a beneficiary of 70 per cent of his fortune). In 1992, with the help of evidence collected by Ledbetter, the Superior Court of Santa Monica finally banned Landy from all financial and personal involvement with Brian. Landy died in 2006. “Landy underestimated me, probably thinking, ‘Nice dumb blonde. She’ll be arm candy for Brian for a while,’” says Ledbetter. “He didn’t understand the power of love and redemption.”\n\nBrian with his daughters in 2004. Photo: Getty Images\n\nSince their 1995 marriage, Brian has experienced a renaissance, personally and professionally, physically and psychologically. Encouraged by his wife, he has reconnected with daughters Carnie and Wendy. The couple has also adopted five children. “I was 48 when we got married, and one day Brian announced we should have a baby,” explains Ledbetter. “Just like anyone that has five kids, we have ups and downs, but we have a lot of pleasure. It’s worked out great for us.”\n\nA diagnosis of bipolar schizoaffective disorder means Brian is now being treated with the correct medication, making day-to-day life easier, although he can still hear voices. “I don’t think he can boil water or fry an egg for himself,” says Jardine fondly. “He’s not an invalid, but he does need a facilitator. His world is focused on his music and that wonderful talent he has in abundance.”\n\nIn 2004, he finally released a version of the band’s lost classic Smile; the band briefly reformed in 2012 to celebrate their 50th anniversary; and he continues his work, both solo and with collaborators, such as Jardine. But it’s not all happily ever after. His brother Dennis drowned in 1983, after years of alcohol and drug abuse. Carl died 15 years later from lung cancer. And after years of lawsuits with his former band members, Mike Love legally leased the exclusive rights to tour under The Beach Boys name, without his remaining co-founders.\n\nInstead, Brian is busy touring his latest album No Pier Pressure in the UK and US. “His music will stand the test of time,” says his wife and biggest fan. “It just attacks your soul in a way that brings so much pleasure and joy.”"
