        "text": "Come join Peabody Award winning author and UCLA Professor David Leaf in an event celebrating the release of his critically-acclaimed book God Only Knows: The Story of Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys and the California Myth. Originally released in 1978, the new edition of what’s been called “The Beach Boys bible” has been massively updated. With new chapters that are more than half the length of the original, readers are getting “two books in one.” This new edition includes exclusive contributions from Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Barry Gibb, Jimmy Webb and Brian Wilson’s wife, Melinda Wilson, and many more.\n\nEmmy Award winning broadcaster Roy Firestone will interview Leaf in Lani Hall in front of a live audience and the event will be livestreamed. Attendees of the live event can stay for a book signing afterwards. Readers are encouraged to purchase a copy of the book to bring to the event for a signing (you can order it here https://amzn.to/3zNkbbp) and visit David Leaf’s website for more information about the God Only Knows VIP Experience.\n\nDavid Leaf became a friend and collaborator of Brian Wilson’s after the publication of his 1978 edition of God Only Knows. For this new edition, Brian Wilson himself wrote that “For over thirty years I’ve trusted David Leaf with my music and my story.” An early review of the book calls it “eloquently written, well-structured, and told with warmth and affection for the subject matter.”\n\nDon’t miss this exciting chance to meet the author of what is considered to be the definitive book about a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and a genuine legend in American music."
