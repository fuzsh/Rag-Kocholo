        "text": "None of these conversations were recorded and some I don’t even have notes for. I’m accurately reporting what was said, but not in the exact words. The photos and the comments on the photos were provided by Brian’s longtime friend Mike Hastie.\n\nConversation between me and Erika Takeo, National Coordinator, Friends of the ATC (Asociación de Trabajadores del Campo)\n\nIt took place back about a year ago:\n\nErika: Do you know Brian Willson, S. Brian Willson.\n\nJohn: I know of him, but I never met him.\n\nErika: He came to ATC today. He is living in Granada now. You got to meet him. He is such an interesting guy. Talking to him is like getting a history lesson.\n\nJohn: Do you have his contact information?\n\nConversation between me and Brian in his hospital room at Hospital Militar where he had a recent back surgery, on May 16, 2018:\n\nJohn: So Brian, all except for one “l” you share a name with one of the greatest musicians of the 60s and the title of your autobiography — Blood on the Tracks — is the same as, arguably, the best album of the 70s. This makes me wonder about your relationship to rock and roll. (OK. This may not have been my finest hour as an interviewer, but it is what I really wanted to know.)\n\nBrian: I’ve always been into the music, but not the personalities. I love to dance, but I’ll dance to anything. Who’s playing isn’t important to me.\n\nJohn: So, the title of the book isn’t a reference to Dylan or the content of that album.\n\nBrian: No. My publisher and I must have talked about two hundred titles for the book. He just chose that one.\n\nJohn: Another question. In photos from the day you were struck by the train you’re wearing a red, Saint Louis baseball cap. This same cap, or ones just like it, shows up in many photos taken over the years. What’s the story with that?\n\nBrian: I love the game! Always have! (There is a baseball game being broadcast out of the computer as we are talking.) You mean why is a boy from upstate New York a Cardinals fan? I have a brother who is nine and a half years older than me. My mother was a Cardinals fan and they would listen to the games on the radio together. She would iron and he’d sit at the kitchen table with her. Then when I was old enough for him to play catch with me, we’d be in the back yard for hours throwing the ball back and forth and he’d tell me stories of the Cardinals, especially Stan Musial, Stan The Man. My mother liked the Cardinals because she liked him. I had no choice. Being a Cardinals fan came with my family. Yeah, I wore that cap for a lot of years. I love baseball.\n\nThe next conversation took place in a taxi on May 25, 2018.\n\nIt was between me, Mike Hastie, an old friend of Brian’s, and a young woman who is the coordinator of volunteers for a Canadian NGO. All her volunteers have been pulled out of the country for safety reasons. She is getting ready to return to Canada. The shared taxi ride is taking a while. We are caught in traffic caused by a demonstration. People on foot crowd the road moving in the same direction as us. All of them are carrying blue and white Nicaraguan flags. While most of the country’s economy is in the toilet, the manufacturers and vendors of flags are getting rich. Everyone is moving toward the rotunda that we have to circle to drop the young woman off to get her hair done. The walls along the road are covered with political slogans and graffiti: “Los JOVENES volvemos a las calles a hacer HISTORIA”, “ASESINO”, “DICTADOR”. Mike did most the talking in this conversation:\n\nYoung woman: Mike, do you live here?\n\nMike: No. I’m visiting a friend here who is in the hospital. You may know him. His name is Brian Willson. (The young woman shakes her head no, as Mike continues.) Brian’s a Vietnam Vet. I’m a vet, too and we’re both active in Vietnam Veterans Against the War and Veterans for Peace. Brian’s been an activist ever since he got out of the air force, going on fifty years now. He’s made many trips to Nicaragua. He is a hero here, because on September 1, 1987, he was protesting the shipment of arms to the Contras at the Naval Weapons Station in Concord, California. The demonstrators were sitting down on the railroad track to block the trains that were taking the weapons to be shipped to Nicaragua. There was a whole protocol. The demonstrators would tell the Navy they were going to block the track. The train would come and stop. Then the police would come and arrest them. But that day, the train didn’t stop. In fact it sped up and it ran over Brian and cut off both his legs below the knee. His wife at that time saw it happen. His stepson saw it happen. Everyone thought he was dead, but he survived. This was during the first time that Ortega was president. His wife, Ortega’s wife, that is, and some of their kids came to visit Brian in the hospital. Later Ortega awarded Brian the Nicaraguan medal of honor. They treat Brian really well when he comes to Nicaragua.\n\n(We arrived at the hair dresser.)\n\nMe: You getting it colored or just cut?\n\nYoung woman: Both. Highlights and cut.\n\nMe: Have fun.\n\nOn May 17, 2018, I had this conversation with Brian in his room at the hospital.\n\nHe was in the bed, hooked up to a variety of tubes and bags, putting liquids in and taking liquids out.\n\nJohn: I’m intimidated by your book.\n\nBrian: Yeah? Why’s that?\n\nJohn: The sucker is huge. It must be 800 pages.\n\nBrian: No. It isn’t that long.\n\nJohn: Well I got it here. Lets see… OK. 441, but that doesn’t count the sixty pages of photos. Those aren’t numbered. So, its 500. Look, here’s my book mark. I read all the introductory stuff. Will you sign it for me?\n\n(Brian writes, “5/17 To John, Thanks for your support for the Nicaraguans. S. Brian Willson” Coming from him, that makes my day. Now, I’m well into the book. It is riveting, thorough and totally engaging. It expands outward from one life story, the awakening and loss of illusions of one man, to a portrait of our nation at a time when the myth of our exceptionality and essential benevolence was being laid to waste.)\n\nJohn: I watched the documentary, too.\n\nBrian: Paying The Price For Peace.\n\nJohn: You say in the documentary, and I’ve heard you say before, that losing your legs was the best thing that ever happened to you. Could you explain that to me?\n\nBrian: The only thing that is exceptional about me losing my legs is that I’m a gringo. We are conditioned to think that a gringo’s life and limbs are more valuable than the lives and limbs of people in other countries. But that’s not true. People all over the world are being killed or having parts of them amputated, because of the US’ imperialism and aggression. Anybody who really stands up to the military-industrial complex, to capitalism, can expect to pay a price, but it’s worth it because it is the right thing to do.\n\nJohn: In the documentary, it sounds like you had a pretty sweet life set up for yourself in Portland, Oregon, a life very consistent with your values. Why, after all these years, did you decide to leave and resettle in Nicaragua?\n\nBrian: There was a lot to it, but the main thing was that living in the US was destroying my soul. I woke up every morning knowing that on that very day my country was going to kill somebody in my name. I’d see a military plane that I knew was paid for by the biggest “defense” budget in the world, in history, but I’d seen what that plane would do and it had nothing to do with “defense.” At the other end was destruction of somebody who was in no way a threat to me or my country. I just couldn’t live with that any more.\n\nBrian’s friend, Mike Hastie, came to be with him during his surgery. He had planned to stay at Brian’s house in Granada and commute to the hospital every day. However, the political turmoil made the commute unpredictable and potentially dangerous, so Mike stayed with my wife and me in Managua. The surgery on Brian’s back was complicated, but it was supposed to be a three day hospital stay. Things didn’t go as planned and as of now Brian has been in Hospital Militar three weeks.\n\nThis conversation between Mike, my wife Deb, and me took place on May 26, the day before Mike went back to Portland, Oregon.\n\nDeb: How are you feeling about leaving?\n\nMike: I think I can go. I think he is going to be all right. He’s not there yet, but everything is going in the right direction. He’s a strong guy. He came into this very fit for somebody who is going to turn 77 on the 4th of July.\n\nJohn: Yeah. If there was a graph and the X axis was the extent to which the body had been battered and the Y axis was the health of the body, Brian would be way out there on both measures; healthiest body, most battered body.\n\nMike: It’s his discipline. There is nobody who works harder than Brian. When he’s got something he wants to do, he always gives it 100%, and that includes physical therapy and keeping himself fit.\n\nAnother bedside conversation between Brian and me at the hospital on May 27, 2018:"
