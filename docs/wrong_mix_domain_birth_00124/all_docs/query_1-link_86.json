        "text": "_\n\nLegendary Beach Boys frontman Brian Wilson has dementia, his family — who are asking a judge to place the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer under a conservatorship — revealed in February 2024, just weeks after the music icon lost his wife of nearly 30 years, Melinda Ledbetter, the woman he called his \"savior\" and his \"anchor.\"\n\nJoin us as we revisit the music icon's life in photos, including the last picture taken with Melinda at a public event as well as Brian's last public appearance…\n\nMORE: Follow Wonderwall on MSN for more fun celebrity & entertainment photo galleries and content\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson (top center) was born in Inglewood, California, on June 20, 1942, and grew up in the nearby city of Hawthorne. The oldest of three brothers developed an early love for singing and playing piano. He quit college early to pursue that love of music, starting a band called the Pendletones with his younger brothers, Dennis (far right) and Carl (bottom center), cousin Mike Love (top left) and pal Al Jardine (far left) in 1961. Brian and Mike wrote their first song for the band — \"Surfin'\" — that same year. They're pictured here in the early '60s.\n\nMORE: The most iconic rock couples through the years\n\n_\n\nThe Beach Boys are born! Brian Wilson and the band signed with Candix records in 1961, changed their name to the Beach Boys and released their first single, \"Surfin',\" that same year. The tune became a moderate hit, reaching No. 75 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. As the group started performing, original member Al Jardine left to focus on his education and was replaced by Wilson family friend David Marks (far right). The new lineup — seen here posing on a Los Angeles beach in August 1962 — featured Brian (far left) as a lead vocalist, keyboardist and bassist in Al's absence.\n\nMORE: What your favorite rock stars looked like when they were young\n\n_\n\n1962 continued to be a pivotal year for Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. After money issues with Candix, the group switched labels and signed a seven-year contract with Capitol Records. Their first single with the label, \"Surfin' Safari,\" was released that June and became another big hit for the band (seen here in August 1962). They named their first album after the song and released it in October 1962.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson (center) continued to enjoy success in 1963 — the year this portrait as taken — as the Beach Boys recorded their most successful single yet, \"Surfin' U.S.A.,\" that January. An album with the same title hit shelves in March and became their highest charting record yet, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard chart. Brian had also set his sights on music production and was working and writing with other acts and letting David Marks fill in for him on vocals with the band in the process. When it came time to start touring, Brian wasn't a big fan. Former member and bassist Al Jardine (top right) rejoined the group that summer and filled in for Brian on bass on the road. But that fall, after David decided to leave the group for good, Brian had to join the band on stage again to resume vocals.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson finally got an official credit as a producer for the Beach Boys on their album \"Surfer Girl,\" which was released in September 1963. He kept busy producing yet another album, the band's fourth, that same year — \"Little Deuce Coupe\" — which came out in October 1963. Later that year, Brian started en eponymous production company as well as his own music publishing company, Ocean Music. He's seen here working on a composition on the piano in 1964.\n\n_\n\nDespite not loving life on the road, Brian Wilson (center, pictured with his band in 1964) joined the rest of the group on a worldwide tour in 1964. He stayed busy writing and producing while they toured, which paid off in a big way. They released not one, not two, but three albums that year — \"Shut Down Volume 2\" in March, \"All Summer Long\" in June and \"The Beach Boys' Christmas Album\" in November. They also scored their first ever No. 1 single — \"I Get Around\" — that same year in May.\n\n_\n\nThough the Beach Boys enjoy success in the United States and abroad in the mid-'60s, there was another band stealing the spotlight — The Beatles. The popular British group served as a rival to the homegrown Beach Boys. Brian Wilson (seen with his dog in 1965) explained that his jealousy toward the U.K. foursome partially contributed to his emotional breakdown at the end of 1964. The musician was buckling from the pressure of writing, producing and touring simultaneously, which caused him to make a pretty rash decision in his personal life…\n\n_\n\nIn December 1964 after a year of quietly dating, a 22-year-old Brian Wilson married a 16-year-old Marilyn Rovell. The young bride (pictured with Brian in 1965) was a singer in the group \"The Honeys,\" one of the acts Brian had been working with as a producer and songwriter. In the wake of his marriage and breakdown, Brian informed his band that he would no longer be touring. Glen Campbell would fill in for him in the future.\n\n_\n\n1965 held more success for the Beach Boys, even without Brian Wilson on tour. They put out two more successful albums, \"The Beach Boys Today!\" in March and \"Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)\" in June, which included one of the group's most successful songs on a global scale — \"California Girls.\" The band — seen here in 1965 — then released 1966's \"Pet Sounds,\" an album considered by many to be one of the best of all time. Brian (second from left) produced the record from January to April 1966, and though it received serious acclaim, it wasn't an instant hit at the time… But their next single was! \"Good Vibrations\" hit No. 1 in December 1966 two months after its release.\n\n_\n\nThe Beach Boys' fans started to divide in the wake of \"Pet Sounds\" — there were those who preferred their wholesome original beach vibe and those who liked their psychedelic-influenced later tunes. As their fan base struggled with their changing sound, the group also struggled to complete their 12th studio album, originally titled \"Smile,\" as Brian Wilson continued to battle exhaustion and mental health issues in late 1966. In early 1967, Brian and wife Marilyn Rovell moved to mansion that included a home studio that became the site where his band (seen here in London in 1966) recorded that 12th album, which was ultimately titled \"Smiley Smile\" when it was released in 1967.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson and wife Marilyn Rovell welcomed their first child, Carnie Wilson, in April 1968. They're seen here a few months later at the premiere of \"Yellow Submarine\" in Los Angeles. Daughter Wendy was born less than a year later in October 1969. The girls inherited their parents' musical talents: As adults, Carnie and Wendy joined forces with another musical scion, Chynna Phillips — the daughter of the Mamas and the Papas members John Phillips and Michelle Phillips — to form the trio Wilson Phillips.\n\n_\n\n1967's \"Smiley Smile\" was the Beach Boys' worst selling album up at that point, and Brian Wilson and his bandmates struggled to win over both critics and fans. They tried their hand at a more soulful sound with their next album, 1967's \"Wild Honey,\" but that charted even more poorly. Brian was all smiles in this 1968 portrait, but it was in reality a tough year for the musical genius, who turned to drugs, food and alcohol and was admitted to a psychiatric facility later that year. In 1973 after his father passed away, he became a recluse for a time.\n\n_\n\nAs Brian Wilson's professional life became more complicated, so did his personal life. His marriage was falling apart due to infidelity on both sides, with Brian carrying on affairs with teenage Beach Boys fan Deborah Keil (which inspired 1977's \"The Night Was So Young\") and his wife Marilyn Rovell's sister Diane (which inspired the 1978 song \"My Diane\"). The couple (seen here performing together in 1970) finally separated in July 1978, and Brian continued to see Deborah for a few more months after the demise of his marriage.\n\n_\n\nThe late '70s were no kinder to Brian Wilson. He endured overdoses, alcohol poisoning and a stint in a mental institution during 1978 and 1979. He briefly reunited with the Beach Boys to record \"L.A. (Light Album),\" which was released in March 1979. He's seen here performing with the group that year, though the album wasn't a big success for the band.\n\n_\n\nAfter an overdose in 1982, Brian Wilson's family authorized an intervention with psychologist Eugene Landy, who'd previously helped the musician in the '70s (they're pictured together here in 1976). The controversial doctor became very involved in not only Brian's personal life but career during this era and faced criticism for allegedly being controlling and Svengali-like.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson is seen here in 1983, a year after he was convinced to re-enter treatment following an intervention and the same year his brother Dennis Wilson, who'd also struggled with addiction, tragically drowned. Brian soon reunited with his band to record their 25th album and first in five years…\n\n_\n\nThe album \"The Beach Boys\" came out in June 1985 to mixed reactions. Brian Wilson (right, with Al Jardine), performed with the group during \"Live Aid\" the following month. After that, Brian opted to pursue a solo career as he continued to live under Dr. Eugene Landy's controversial guidance.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson released his self-titled debut album in July 1988 (he's seen here in Malibu the same year); it achieved moderate success. Meanwhile, the Beach Boys had their first No. 1 hit in decades with the song \"Kokomo\" from the movie \"Cocktail\" the same month — but it didn't involve Brian, whose solo work was eclipsed by its release.\n\n_\n\nLegends only! In 1988, the Beach Boys were induced into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Brian (second from right) reunited with Al Jardine, Carl Wilson and Mike Love at the induction ceremony that year.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson's relationship with the other Beach Boys members was strained by 1990. When he released his first memoir, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story,\" in October 1991 — he's pictured here that same year — it only made matters worse as Mike Love, Al Jardine, Carl Wilson and Brian's own mother filed defamation lawsuits against him.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson found love again with Melinda Ledbetter, a model and car saleswoman who later worked as his manager. The couple dated in the late '80s while Brian was working with Dr. Eugene Landy, who Melinda blamed for their 1989 split. Once Brian cut ties with his controversial psychologist in the early '90s, he and Melinda reunited and married in 1995. They're seen here the same year at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson added to his brood via adoption after marrying Melinda Ledbetter. The couple started expanding their family when they welcomed daughter Daria Rose, who was born in 1996, and daughter Delanie Rae, who born 1998 — the same year the couple are pictured here.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson's first two children, daughters Carnie Wilson (second from left) and Wendy Wilson (far right), found success in the '90s with their music group Wilson Phillips. The women and bandmate Chynna Phillips joined their dad on stage in March 2001 during a tribute to his work at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson gave daughter Daria a glimpse into his career when he brought her along as he signed copies of his first live solo album, 2000's \"Live at the Roxy,\" at Tower Records in New York City in July 2001.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson and wife Melinda Ledbetter, seen here at a pre-Grammys party in 2005, continued to welcome children through adoption in the 2000s — son Dylan was born in 2004, son Dash was born in 2009 and daughter Dakota Rose completed their family in 2010.\n\n_\n\nDoting dad! Brian Wilson took daughters Daria (right) and Delanie (left) to the premiere of \"Just My Luck\" in Los Angeles in May 2006.\n\n_\n\nBrian Wilson was honored with a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor in 2007. The award recognizes a lifetime of contributions to American culture through the performing arts. Brian attended that year's ceremony alongside wife Melinda Ledbetter and three of their children: Daria, Dylan and Delanie.\n\n_\n\nIn December 2011, it was announced that Brian Wilson would reunite with some of the former Beach Boys for a 50th anniversary tour. The group hit the stage at the 2012 Grammy Awards for their first live performance that included Brian since 1996 (he's seen here on stage with Mike Love during the show). Two months later, they all headed out on the road to perform for fans around the world.\n\n_\n\nA film about Brian Wilson's amazing life premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2014. \"Love and Mercy\" saw actor Paul Dano play a young Brian while actor John Cusack portrayed him in later years. Actress Elizabeth Banks played his second wife, Melinda Ledbetter. Brian and Melinda posed with their on-screen counterparts at the film's DVD release event in 2015.\n\n_\n\n\"Love and Mercy\" garnered critical acclaim and two Golden Globe nominations. Brian Wilson also picked up a nod for best original song for \"One Kind of Love,\" a song he wrote for the biopic's soundtrack.\n\nHe attended the 2016 ceremony with wife Melinda Ledbetter, who died in January 2024 at 77.\n\n\"My heart is broken. Melinda, my beloved wife of 28 years, passed away this morning. Our five children and I are just in tears. We are lost,\" Brian shared on Instagram. \"Melinda was more than my wife. She was my savior. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career. She encouraged me to make the music that was closest to my heart. She was my anchor. She was everything for us.\" He concluded his post, \"Please say a prayer for her. Love and Mercy, Brian.\"\n\n_\n\nIn 2016, Brian Wilson put pen to paper for his second book, \"I Am Brian Wilson: A Memoir.\" He's seen here at a book signing in Los Angeles in October 2017.\n\n_\n\nAfter the release of a fictionalized account of his life, Brian Wilson took a front seat — literally! — for the next big-screen take on his story. The 2021 documentary \"Brian Wilson: Long Promised Road\" saw Brian (center, during a screening and Q&A event at the Grammy Museum that December) traveling alongside Rolling Stone editor Jason Fine (second from left) and recounting tales from his past at the exact locations where the events took place. The film, which also includes interviews with other big names like Elton John and Bruce Springsteen, received rave reviews from critics.\n\n_\n\nWhen Rolling Stone asked Brian Wilson in 2016 about retiring, the musician responded, \"Oh, man. No retiring. If I retired I wouldn't know what to do with my time. What would I do?\" He co-headlined a tour with the Zombies in 2019 and, after taking a break due to the coronavirus pandemic, returned to the road in August 2021. He's seen here in June 2022 at a Los Angeles stop on his most recent tour, which he co-headlined with the band Chicago.\n\nHowever, that may very well have been his final tour: Brian played his last show in July 2022 after which he canceled his remaining 2022 dates, with his management citing \"unforeseen health reasons.\" Daughter Carnie Wilson said on a January 2023 Beach Boys fan podcast that her dad would likely not tour anymore, which she called \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n_\n\nThe Beach Boys members Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, David Marks, Bruce Johnston and Mike Love reunited to watch a star-studded tribute concert honoring their band and musical legacy at a February 2023 taping.\n\nIt was the last public appearance Brian made before his family revealed a year later in February 2024 that it was asking a judge to place the icon under a conservatorship at 81, following the death of wife Melinda Ledbetter weeks earlier, because he has dementia.\n\nThe show, \"A Grammy Salute to the Beach Boys,\" aired on April 9, 2023, and featured performances by John Legend, Brandi Carlile, St. Vincent, Beck, Fall Out Boy, Mumford & Sons, Weezer, Charlie Puth, LeAnn Rimes, My Morning Jacket, Norah Jones, Pentatonix, Lady A and more."
