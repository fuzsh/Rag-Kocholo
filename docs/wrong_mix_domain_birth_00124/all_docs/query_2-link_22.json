We got a bass, guitar and a set of drums. … I was 19. Dennis was 15. Carl was 17. Mike was 18. Al was 19. And so we wrote a song called “Surfin'” in my living room, and that’s how it all started.\n\nBeing called a musical genius was a cross to bear. Genius is a big word. But if you have to live up to something, you might as well live up to that.\n\nI think because I felt so sad I had to bring out my feelings, and try to create music that would make me and all my friends feel better.\n\nWe wanted to bring some love to the world. I thought we were good at doing that. Bringin’ love to the world.\n\nHumor — it helps to make the vibe better — it loosens up the vibrations.\n\n1976\n\nBrian and Dennis Wilson"
