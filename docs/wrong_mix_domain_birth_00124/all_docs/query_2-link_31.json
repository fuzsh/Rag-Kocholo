        "text": "Edited From Wikipedia\n\nBrian Douglas Wilson (born June 20, 1942 in Inglewood, California) is a Grammy Award-winning American musician best known as the leader and chief songwriter of the American rock and roll band, the Beach Boys. Within the band, Wilson played bass, keyboards, provided part-time lead vocals and, more often, backing vocals, harmonizing in falsetto with the group.\n\nWilson was the primary songwriter in the Beach Boys, also functioning as the band’s main producer, composer, and arranger. In 1988, Wilson and his bandmates were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which refers to Wilson on its website as “One of the few undisputed geniuses in popular music.” In 2008, Rolling Stone Magazine published a list of the “100 Greatest Singers of All Time, and Wilson was ranked at #52.\n\nHe is also an occasional actor and voice actor, having appeared in television shows, films, and other music artist music videos.\n\nEarly Years\n\nWilson was born June 20, 1942 at Centinela Hospital in Ingelwood, California. When Brian was two, the Wilson family moved from Ingelwood to 3701 West 119th Street in nearby Hawthorne, California, a town in the greater Los Angeles urban area about five miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. He spent his entire subsequent childhood years in this middle-class family home.\n\nBrian Wilson’s father Murry Wilson told of Brian’s unusual musical abilities prior to his first birthday, observing that the baby could repeat the melody from “When the Caissons Go Rolling Along” after only a few verses had been sung by the father. Murry stated, “He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him.”\n\nAt about age two, Brian heard George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue”, which had an enormous emotional impact on him. Unfortunately, a few years later Brian was discovered to have extremely diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from Brian’s simply being born partially deaf, to a blow to the head from Brian’s father, or a neighborhood bully, being to blame.”\n\nWhile father Murry was ostensibly a reasonable provider, he was abusive and hard to please, liable to dispense harsh punishments for minor or perceived misdeeds. But Murry, a minor musician and songwriter, also encouraged his children in this field in numerous ways. At a young age, Brian was given six weeks of lessons on a “toy accordion”, and at seven and eight sang solos in church with a choir behind him.\n\nBy most accounts a natural leader by the time he began attending Hawthorne High School, Brian was on the football team as a quarterback, played baseball and was a cross-country runner his senior year.” However, the majority of his energy was directed towards music. He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home. Brian taught his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice when they were supposed to be asleep.\n\nHe also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of The Four Freshmen by listening to short segments of their songs on a phonograph, then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard.\n\nBrian enrolled at El Camino Community College in Los Angeles, majoring in psychology, in September 1960. However, he continued his music studies at the college as well. At some point in the year 1961 Brian wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of “When You Wish Upon a Star”.\n\nBrian’s tune would eventually be known as “Surfer Girl”. Brian has commented that he wrote the melody in his car, then later at home finished the bridge and harmonies. Although an early demo of the song was recorded in Feb. 1962 at World-Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top ten hit.\n\nBrian and his brothers Carl and Dennis Wilson along with Mike Love and Al Jardine first jelled as a music group in the summer of 1961, initially named the Pendeltones. After being prodded by Dennis to write a song about the local watersports craze, Brian and Mike Love together created what would become the first single for the band, “Surfin'”. Recorded by Hite and Dorinda Morgan and released on the small Candix label, the song became a top local hit in Los Angeles and reached number seventy-five on the national Billboard sales charts.\n\nLooking for a followup single for their radio hit, Brian and Mike wrote “Surfin’ Safari,” and attempts were made to record a usable take at World Pacific, including overdubs, on February 8, 1962, along with several other tunes including an early version of “Surfer Girl”. Only a few days later, discouraged about the band’s financial prospects, and objecting to adding some Chubby Checker songs to the Beach Boys live setlist, Al Jardine abruptly left the group."
