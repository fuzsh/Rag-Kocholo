chat.\n\nAnd when I first came to work at Rolling Stone in 1997, Brian had begun to start what was gonna be sort of a solo career.\n\nHe was putting a band together.\n\nHe was releasing a record called \"Imagination.\"\n\nAnd I convinced Jann, my boss, to let me go to Chicago, where he was rehearsing.\n\nOne of the first times we spoke, we were sitting in his living room.\n\nWe were talking, and sort of right in the middle of our chat, about 10 minutes in, he just started to fidget, and he said, \"I gotta go.\"\n\nAnd he got up and he left.\n\nAnd I was sitting there.\n\nI didn't know if he was coming back or -- or not coming back, and I waited a while.\n\nAnd I just sorta started looking around, and I found myself in the kitchen, where I found Brian in the refrigerator.\n\nI said, \"What's going on?\"\n\nHe said, \"I just got a little scared.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Well, what did you get scared of?\"\n\nHe said, \"I don't know.\n\nYou know, sometimes I just get scared.\n\nThings scare me.\"\n\nI said, \"Like what?\"\n\nHe said, \"Like 'What a Fool Believes.'\n\nYou know that song by the Doobie Brothers?\n\nScares the hell out of me.\"\n\nYou know?\n\nAnd it was just like that.\n\nAnd we started having these moments, and ever since then, it just kinda became part of my beat at Rolling Stone to cover Brian.\n\n-♪ Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?\n\n♪ ♪ Then we wouldn't have to wait so long ♪ ♪ And wouldn't it be nice... ♪ -And we became buddies.\n\n-♪ To live together ♪ -♪ In the kind of world where we belong ♪ -The idea of doing an interview makes Brian
