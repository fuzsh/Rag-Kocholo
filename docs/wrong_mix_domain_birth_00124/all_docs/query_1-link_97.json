        "text": "The new Brian Wilson bio pix is out in a limited release. I had the day off and rain was in the forecast, so a perfect day for a matinee.\n\nhttp://www.hulu.com/watch/778043\n\nThe movie is very good. If you caught the documentary \"The Wrecking Crew\", there are a lot of tie-ins. The movie primarily focuses on the Pet Sounds era and Brians recovery from psychological/mental health/drug issues in the 80's.\n\nOops, almost forgot. Murry Wilson, Brians father is never seen without a pipe in the movie. He's not the guy we want leading our charge....but it sure looks like he is smoking a GBD 9438 in those scenes. I couldn't find any, but below is an orignial\n\nI about died laughing when I heard a promo for this movie describing him as \"America's greatest songwriter\". Yeah. he had some good songs but no where near the greatest.\n\nI loved his early work. From Pet Sounds and on not so much.\n\nI agree he's not Americas greatest songwriters, but a great many music critics would disagree. And, curiously, most of them consider Pet Sounds to be his best work (the album, in fact, has topped as many critical \"All Time Best Album\" lists as often as \"Sgt. Peppers,\" \"Revolver,\" and \"Dark Side of the Moon.\" I'm not the worlds biggest Beach Boya fan, but I do respect them for their revolutionary impact on rock music during the 60s.\n\nI was never a big Beach Boys fan (way too poppy), but my wife loves their early stuff. Pet Sounds did win me over. If you have't seen the new documentary \"The Wrecking Crew\", definitely watch it. They were pretty much in awe of Brian Wilson and to that point, they worked with some pretty notable musicians.\n\nBrians new album is pretty rough....\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COtfZpf8LE\n\nHe was certainly tapped into genius for that Pet Sounds album. I had read that Pet Sounds served as inspiration for both Sgt. Pepper and Revolver by the Beatles, and the album consistently ranks as one of the greatest albums of all time. I was never a fan of the Beach Boys or the Beatles, but I certainly respect their immense talent and their influence on the countless musicians that followed.\n\n'Heard the film was good, well acted, directed, edited. Not a big fan when young nor now, but certainly admit the songs were on life's soundtrack though I never owned a record of his/theirs.\n\nIf I had to name one \"America's Greatest Songwriter\" it would have to be Irving Berlin. I know a lot of people don't know him that well these days, but his work is woven into the American psyche. You might not know the titles, and might not know he wrote them, but you'd recognize the tunes even if you were born in 2000. He lived to be about 101 (really). Not American, but Lennon/McCarney would have to go high on the international list, for melodies alone. The Canadians have a long list -- my favorite Leonard Cohen.\n\nI will probably see it it, sounds interesting.\n\nI was never a fan of the Beach Boys or the Beatles,\n\nMe either, but I picked up a CD of Beetles music performed by a symphonic band which is really great. It was a twofer I scored at the goodwill shop with some 60's pop music.\n\nEllie Greenwich had a great song writing career. Along with her husband, they penned six songs in Rolling Stones top 500 Rock songs list, more than any writer combo's. \"Be My Baby\" alone puts her pretty far up on my list!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellie_Greenwich"
