        "text": "Post by John Manning on\n\nReally, really enjoyed the interview with Mark Linett and Alan Boyd. Whenever ESQ talks to those two, I find myself salivating at the thought to what brilliant releases will come next!\n\nFirst, it’s great to know that they’re still pushing for the 1964 Keep An Eye On Summer and the 1968 Friends/20/20 material to get a proper physical release. Mark’s absolutely correct when he says the digital releases don’t resonate with audiences (well, the audience in this specific part of Yorkshire) in the same way as a proper physical release does. If Mark and Alan are listening, I’d love to see the rest of the Sunshine Tomorrow material gets it’s due as a physical release too: best, bundle the material together as a four-disc (or more) box. This is an era during which The Beach Boys produced a wealth of outstanding music, which deserves to get a proper showing.\n\nThe guys shared some fascinating tidbits about the Sail on Sailor release – discovering session material at the end (or beginning!) of other reused tapes; the facts about the VDP “hypnotism” session; the unused material they’d hoped would appear as a download but didn’t (as far as anyone knows); the hopes of a release for the second Flame album.\n\nSlightly surprised that there was no firm word on what project might come next. Loved the speculation about the 15 Big Ones—MIU era – I’m one of those who’d love to see each handled separately, with as much bonus matter as can be excavated. I’d be even more excited by an expanded In Concert album, preferably each gig released in full rather than simply acing the best performances from each cherry-picked for a smaller set (though I recognise the commercial restraints… while at the same time suspecting a thoughtfully priced set would do really well).\n\nThe Carnegie gig on this set is surely their best live release yet? Full marks to Mark and Alan for putting that out, I’m utterly thrilled by it. Good to learn the detail about the best songs being utilised though – again – I hope we get to hear both sets from each gig (physical, obvs!) one day, flaws and all.\n\nI was a little dismayed at the inference that vinyl production has been transferred to Czechoslovakia for seemingly no other reason than because it’s too toxic an industry for California. If our Czech cousins are being poisoned in the name of vinyl releases, then it’s maybe time to switch to CD/SACD/DVD-A/Blu-Ray-A… whatever – and I’m sure they have their own issues.\n\nIt struck me that there was no mention in the interview of Howie Edelson, and his role in putting the set together. Was that deliberate? Is his role being exorcised from history? Or has he simply moved on, perhaps to Macca or The Boss projects?\n\nFootnote: I haven’t bought the set yet. I’ve been streaming it on Apple Music, which my partner subscribed to. Currently between jobs and the price was set much too high for my means. But as soon as the price either tumbles or my situation improves, I’ll be buying.\n\nThank you Mark and Alan for bringing yet another treasure trove to our ears, and to David for another fascinating interview.\n\nPost by esqeditor on\n\nReally, really enjoyed the interview with Mark Linett and Alan Boyd.

Mark and Alan reviewed the Q&A before it went to press. Nothing intentional at all.\n\nPost by boogieboarder on\n\nI just finished reading the excellent premier article \"Revisiting Brian Wilson's relationship music 1967-1968\" by David Beard in the Spring 2023 Issue. At the end of the article he suggests what he calls a \"hypothetical album in lieu of what ultimately became 20/20 or the proposed last Capitol album - a conceivable, mixed album of vocal and instrumental recordings rooted in a relationship - similar to Pet Sounds.\" He lists 13 songs, along with their sources, for a playlist.\n\nI decided to make that exact album, and burn it to a CD for my listening pleasure. If anyone else wants to do this, I'd just like to point out (for accuracy), that one of the sources listed for a song is incorrect:\n\n\"Honey Get Home\" can actually be found on 1967: Sunshine Tomorrow, not Wake the World: The Friends Sessions as stated in the article.\n\nBy the way, I titled my CD We're Together Again, after the opening song.\n\nView Attachment\n\nI listened to this today, and it seems like everything in it except the opening tune sounds depressing, or emotionally negative. The lyrics are depressing, Brian sounds depressed on the vocals, and even the music is down. There’s nothing wrong with that. Some of Frank Sinatra’s great albums are called “suicide” albums, and it’s well documented that he had relationship problems that caused him difficult times. (In The Wee Small Hours, No One Cares, and Frank Sinatra Sings for Only The Lonely.)\n\nIf Brian had completed and released all these tracks, it certainly would not have been perceived as a fun-in-the-sun Beach Boys album. It’s more like a sequel to SMiLE called frOwn. I can see the cover now, a frown shop."
