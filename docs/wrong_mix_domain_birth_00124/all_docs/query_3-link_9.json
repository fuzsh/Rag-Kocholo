        "text": "Post by mattbielewicz on\n\nI remember all the hoo-hah on the boards back when this monument was unveiled, but as I wasn't able to get within several thousand miles of the place on the day (I'm in the UK), it was of limited interest to me at the time. I've been to LA several times since but not yet squeezed in a visit to the monument as yet. Maybe next time...\n\nIf I'm honest, it's of less interest to me than some other BB landmarks, as in this case the house itself has vanished under the thoroughly unremarkable freeway embankment. But this thread has set me wondering... where EXACTLY was the Wilson's house relative to what's there today? And so I set off on a voyage of discovery (admittedly, without going further than my computer at my house in the East of England... about all I can do at the moment).\n\nI haven't been able to find a picture of the Wilson house itself. I think there have been a few threads on-line at various boards about it in the past, and maybe someone had one in those, but I don't recall. I could find quite a lot of shots on line taken OUTSIDE the Wilson house (for example of Brian aged about 14-15 with a baseball bat), most memorably ones of the three brothers when young in their street, and the three of them larking about in front of the wall of a house with the famous number 3701 (the Wilson address) visible on a post in the background, but in none of these is the whole house clearly visible, as the shot is either framed too closely in on the house (as in the shot of the brothers in front of the wall), or as in the shot of the teenaged Brian with the baseball bat, the shot is facing AWAY from the house, although presumably shot in their front garden. The perspective of the baseball bat shot is the same as some of the shots used to create the montage seen on the front of the original 'Hawthorne, California' compilation and the shot of the boys when young - the houses and garages in the background are clearly the same - but again, I suspect that those photos (also on line, and apparently taken in 1965 before the Wilsons moved away?) were taken on the Wilson front lawn looking AWAY from their house, and therefore presumably the houses in the background of those picturs are those of their neighbours, NOT the Wilson house itself.\n\nLooking at what is there today — the street with the monument — it's clear that although this is called West 119th Street today, this isn't the original position of the street. For one thing, obviously, the Wilsons DIDN'T live next to the embankment to Freeway I-105 when they were growing up. That road was built in the mid-to-late 1980s from what I can tell, and its construction is what obliterated the house— although apparently the freeway didn't open until 1993, as the construction of the road was mired in legal fights until then. David Marks mentioned in articles from the monument's unveiling day that the streets he grew up in had moved and that even standing there in the street, he was a little confused as to exactly where he was. I wondered what he meant by that, so I started looking stuff up on line...\n\nAs anyone with access to Google Maps knows, this is where the monument is (see around the middle of the map at that link). But as you can see clearly at that link, as West 119th Street approaches the freeway embankment today, it bends slightly south, and runs on seamlessly into Almertens Place after passing the junction with Kornblum Avenue. It would seem that in the Wilsons' day, West 119th Street did NOT bend south like this.\n\nLook north of Hawthorne Municipal Airport on this 1964 street map of LA (look to the left and just below the middle of the map to find the airport), and you'll see what I mean. This predates the construction of the freeway by over 20 years. West 119th Street stays 'straight', doesn't bend south, and, unlike today, meets Kornblum Avenue at right angles. In 1964, after the intersection with Kornblum Avenue, the road continued as Almertens Place, and bent rather more sharply than it does today to regain the angle that it still runs at today.\n\nGoing by the well-known house numbers given on-line and in various reference books for the addresses of the Wilson and the Marks families, and comparing to the numbering of the houses around that intersection today as shown on Google Maps, I deduce that the Wilson house, 3701 West 119th Street, was probably on the north-west corner of the right-angled four-way intersection of West 119th Street, Almertens Place, and Kornblum Avenue in its original location (not the slightly shifted version of that intersection today).\n\nI'm less sure about the Marks house. David said in one video that I saw that his house was ON Kornblum Avenue, but the address I've seen in various reference works was 11901 Almertens Place. I suppose both could be true if Dave's house was on the South-east corner of Kornblum/West 119th and Almertens, as the intersection was originally. That would explain why both the Wilsons and the Marks houses were demolished when the freeway was built, as the original Kornblum/West 119th/Almertens intersection is clearly under the freeway today. However, it also suggests that the Wilsons and Marks houses were literally diagonally across from each other on the same intersection... and I had the feeling from historical quotes from Dave and the other Boys that they were *slightly* further apart than that... as in, a bit down the street from each other at least. Input from anyone who knows better (and I'm sure there are lots of you out there reading this board...!) is welcome.\n\nIf the above IS at least partly right, and the Wilson's house *was* on the North-west corner of the West 119th Street/Kornblum Avenue/Almertens Place intersection in its original pre-freeway location, then the current monument is probably a bit south of the house... more like on the spot where the Wilson's neighbours' house would have been on the south-west corner of the original intersection. That matches with something else Dave Marks said in one of the on-line interviews I saw about the monument, where he said he thought that the monument was probably about where the driveway was to one of the houses opposite the Wilsons house. Tracing the line of the original course of West 119th Street from west to east and intersecting with where it would have hit the original north-south line of Kornblum Avenue, I reckon the exact spot of the Wilson house is right under the middle of the southbound carriageway of the 105 Freeway. Which also fits Dave's feeling in the same interview that the Wilson house was now 'under the freeway'.\n\nI bet someone somewhere has probably long since worked all of the above out on-line somewhere already, and I just couldn't find it, but that's what I have figured out, admittedly with no knowledge of the area at all! Corrections very much welcome...!\n\nThe point of doing all this was so that I could nurdily work out which direction the old shots I found were facing (for example teenaged Brian with the baseball bat, or the shots of the boys doing chores outside the house that were collaged for the Hawthorne, California cover). But that will have to wait until I can be sure of the locations themselves... if I ever work that out...! A task for a rainy day...\n\nPost by boogieboarder on\n\nThat's a lot of great information from mattbielewicz's online research. Since every tidbit even remotely related to The Beach Boys may be of some interest, I'm going to present some first-hand information regarding the 105 Freeway, along with some easily available background information.\n\n1. In Southern California, freeways are named, and most residents called them by name when I lived there. They always use a \"the\" in front of the name. For example, \"The 405 Freeway\" is named \"The San Diego Freeway.\" In Northern California, where I lived for 10 years, and in Washington State where I live now, they never, ever, ever, say \"the,\" which marks you as a \"foreigner.\" Thus, they say \"To get there, take 405\" - not \"take the 405.\"\n\n2. The 105 Freeway was first proposed in 1947, and the route was designed between 1968 and 1972, and was named \"The Century Freeway.\" This is probably because it parallels Century Blvd., but that is speculation on my part.\n\n3. There was opposition to building the freeway because of the disruption to existing communities, the burgeoning environmental movement, and new fiscal austerity in the 1970s. A lawsuit held up construction for 10 years, until a consent decree in 1981.\n\n4. In 1978, I wanted to buy my first house. I had been living in a rental in Redondo Beach for the previous four years since I married my first wife who grew up in the area. But we couldn't afford to buy a house in Redondo Beach, or anywhere near the beach for that matter. A friend of mine suggested that you could get good value for your money in Hawthorne. We found a realtor who started showing us houses. One house he showed we were interested in, but then said that he was legally required to tell us that it was in the proposed path of a new freeway. He said the freeway was unlikely to ever be built. But if it was ever built, they would use eminent domain to condemn our house, and we'd have to move out. They'd give us \"market value\" for it. That didn't sound good to me, so we passed. We eventually bought a house in Hawthorne where we lived for four years, but we were not happy in the neighborhood. That's a story for another time.\n\n5. In 1988 I got a job in El Segundo, at Hughes Aircraft Company, with a picture window office on the second story of a high rise building directly across from the proposed Century Freeway. That's when they started building the freeway, so I spent several years in my office watching them (and listening to them) build the freeway.\n\n6. My father-in-law personally knew the CEO of the construction company who was building the freeway. There were seemingly endless delays in the construction, which was going over budget. The CEO finally went to visit the head construction manager's office on-site to find out what was going on. When the CEO arrived, the manager was wearing shorts and tennis shoes and said he was just leaving to go play a round of tennis, and wondered if the CEO wanted to join him. The CEO said, no, actually, \"You're Fired!\" I believe the CEO then took on the active role of overseeing the completion of the construction job himself.\n\n7. After the freeway was almost completed, but not yet opened, I arrived at work one day to find bullet holes in my office picture window. Apparently people were climbing up on to the vacant freeway, and shooting at the windows of the adjacent office buildings. (Welcome to The United States).\n\n8. On the very first day the freeway opened in 1993, people at work decided to go to lunch. One guy said \"I don't care where we go to eat today, as long as we take the 105 freeway to get there.\"\n\n9. The freeway's name was changed, named after Congressman Glenn M. Anderson who had advocated for the freeway's construction, although some maps still list it as the Century Freeway.\n\nPost by mattbielewicz on\n\nHere's another way of looking at the site of the Hawthorne house where all three Wilson brothers spent most of their childhoods. The fabulous site Historic Aerials.com has, as the name suggests, actual historical aerial photography of many areas, including Hawthorne, CA where the Wilsons grew up, with on-line coverage viewable at intervals of a few years. It was easy to find the right spot by looking for Hawthorne Municipal Airport (now home to Spacex, as Emdeeh noted above) and looking for the distinctive tap/faucet-shaped profile of Almertens Place just north of there.\n\nI've clipped and aligned as closely as I can a small section of the aerial photography taken at intervals of several years and added some labels on top in Photoshop. Of course, these images are decades old and so the quality (and the resolution of the scans) is not pin-sharp compared to Google's aerial view, but with the aid of the labelling, you can figure out where the Wilsons lived, see across the intersection where the Marks family must also have lived (thanks to Emdeeh and AGD for confirming the location of the latter). Advancing through the years, it also becomes plain why Brian literally can't go home anymore, as you can see exactly where their house would have been relative to the I-105 freeway...\n\nAbove is the area around the Wilson house in 1952 from the air.\n\nThe distinctive intersection of West 119th Street (to the West) with Kornblum Avenue (North-South) and Almertens Place (East, then bending South-east) is clearly visible. If everyone above me on this thread is right, the Wilson house was on the North-west corner of this intersection, and the future Marks residence (diagonally opposite) was not yet built, as Almertens Place had yet to be developed at that time.\n\nMoving to 1963, the aerial photography is of better quality, and Almertens Place has now been developed and built on. I wouldn't say you can quite reach out and touch Brian's music room, but you can certainly see the outline of the house. Sadly, this isn't quite the case for the Marks residence — it's definitely been built in this shot, but all you can make out is where it is, not what it looks like!\n\nIn the above aerial shot, it's now 1972, and the Wilsons are no longer living locally. You can still see where the house is, though, and where the Marks house must be, although details are not very clear.\n\nBy all accounts, by the time the above aerial shot below was taken in 1980, the area had become quite run-down, as local folk were now expecting the new freeway to come through this area (as it eventually did) and it was suffering from planning blight. This isn't very apparent from the air, but it's a shame to imagine the classic 'open lawns and barbecue yards' suburban America district we see in some of the 50s and 60s photography having gone rather to seed.\n\nThe above shot, from 1994, shows the big change. During the late 80s, the 105 Freeway was finally built and the area around the Wilson/Marks intersection completely destroyed. This 1994 aerial shot is still in black and white and not very clear, but you can see where the Wilson and Marks houses would be now relative to the freeway lanes, and how West 119th Street and Almertens Place were subtly realigned on a slant to accommodate the new highway.\n\nFinally, above is a view of the area on a 2018 aerial view. In colour at last, this can fairly be compared to the modern view you get at GoogleMaps and compare the former location of the Marks and Wilson houses to the spot where the current memorial is.\n\nThe above exercise is, of course, super-nurdy to the point of overload, but... isn't that what we do here?"
