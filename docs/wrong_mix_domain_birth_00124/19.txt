History Highlight:

Brian Wilson was born on June 20, 1942. He is 82. Wilson began crooning with the Beach Boys in 1961, acting as their band’s main songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. By the mid 1960s, he had written, or co-written more than two dozen U.S. Top 40 hits, such as "Surf City" and "I Get Around". In 1965 - when mental health struggles led to an extended break from touring with the Beach Boys - he took the music into more uncharted waters, producing the Beach Boys' seminal Pet Sounds album and his first credited solo release, Caroline, No, both in 1966. Wilson helped loosen the structure of pop music with experimental compositions and new studio recording techniques, with an aim to write songs that appear "simple, no matter how complex it really is." Earlier this year, Disney+ released a new documentary about The Beach Boys.
