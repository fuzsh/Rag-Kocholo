        "text": "Project Description\n\nMachado de Assis Prize 2010Joca Reiners Terron\n\nBrazil\n\nJoca Reiners Terron, born in Cuiabá, Brazil in 1968, is a poet, writer and graphic designer. He was an editor at the independent Brazilian publishing house Ciência do Acidente and is now a regular contributor to the prestigious newspaper Folha de São Paulo and TV Cultura. Joca Terron has won the Prêmio Machado de Assis 2010 and was shortlisted for the São Paulo Prize for Literature in 2011, 2018, and 2020.\n\n© Rafael Roncato\n\n//\n\nWhere Minotaurs Graze\n\nIn his new novel Where Minotaurs Graze (“Onde Pastam os Minotauros”), Terron relocates the myth of the Minotaur, that horrific, carnivorous hybrid of human body and bull’s head, deep in the Brazilian countryside. Somewhere in Mato Grosso, a huge slaughterhouse with its associated soya fields dominates a town as its sole employer. But the factory produces for export to Arab countries and the local employees have been replaced by Palestinian Muslims. The laid-off workers stand with other starving people outside the fence, waiting for the customary handout of leftover bones on the last working day of the year. But inside the slaughterhouse, two friends, Crente (engl.: Believer) and Cão (engl.: Dog), one of whom has just lost his wife to the pandemic and with it his faith, while the other is perhaps himself a hybrid creature, for he can hear the cattle speak, are planning an uprising. When a commission arrives late in the afternoon to investigate the possibility of kosher slaughter, the revolt breaks out. Cão, who planned it, is killed in the process, sacrificing himself to feed the hungry and free the cattle, but Crente and Cão’s girlfriend Lucy Fuerza, who in the meantime have blown open the company safe, manage to escape from the general destruction with the looted money.\n\nWith his powerful, empathetic and controlled pictorial language, Terron unfolds this apocalyptic story that exposes globalised capitalism as well as man’s ruthless treatment of the nature entrusted to him. At the end, despite everything, he hints at the hope that the path out of the labyrinth may lead to a more just world.\n\nQuotes\n\nWhere Minotaurs Graze\n\n»With Where Minotaurs Graze, Terron continues a dazzling sequence of febrile novels, written, it seems, from the point of view of the abyss.«\n\nAndré de Leones, O Estado de S.Paulo\n\n»A fable about the predatory jungle of capitalism, the new novel by writer Joca Reiners Terron surprises, frightens, and revolts in each of its almost forty short chapters. Direct and sharp as a knife, they pierce the reader with a reading that is breathless and unremitting.«\n\nO Valor Econômico\n\n»Terron shows that the denunciation of Brazilian social inequality is most vigorous when it imaginatively explores human moral ambiguity, poetic fabulation, and formal sophistication.«\n\nFolha de S.Paulo\n\n»The text is frenetic and wild, like the character’s mind, in constant delirium, caused by pain, by hunger, by reality. In this brutal narrative, Joca Reiners Terron creates an allegory of Brazil today.«\n\nGabriel Pinheiro, Columnist for Literature for Culturadoria\n\n»The new book is even more unsettling than the previous one. There is no escaping the cruelties, much less denying them.«\n\nHenrique Massaro, Correio do Povo.\n\n//\n\nThe Laughter of Rats\n\nIn his new novel The Laughter of Rats (“O Riso dos Ratos”), Terron creates a dystopian picture of Brazil’s present or near future. His nameless protagonist, an intellectual who works as a freelance translator and editor, lives in an equally nameless city. He is the father of an adult daughter, a student of acting who was raped by a bar owner. Not trusting the system of justice, the father feels obliged to seek revenge himself. A request that his daughter rejects in horror, as she believes it will set in motion an endless chain of violence. The daughter flees, the father sinks into lethargy, incapable of any action, and does not leave the apartment for months. When he is finally forced to, he enters a devastated city where – perhaps as a result of a deadly virus – all social norms have been suspended. The return to his apartment building is barred and suddenly he joins the ranks of the homeless. He finds refuge in the former Futurama supermarket, where he used to do his shopping with his daughter. But this is only the first stop in a cruel descent that leads him to the underworld, to the plantations of a dubious “bishop” and even as a prisoner to a slave ship. Like Dante in his Commedia, he traverses purgatory and hell to eventually find death on an apparently paradisiacal island. What keeps him alive is the thought of revenge, but also the memory of moments of happiness with his daughter.\n\nTerron tells this apocalyptic journey through hell in a powerful, often lyrical language that will remain fixed in readers’ memories.\n\nQuotes\n\nThe Laughter of Rats\n\n»The text is frenetic and wild, like the character’s mind, in constant delirium, caused by pain, by hunger, by reality.

There is no escaping the cruelties, much less denying them.«\n\nHenrique Massaro, Correio do Povo.\n\n//\n\nDeath and Meteor\n\nThere are only fifty Kaajapukugi Indians left in the world. It is an isolated and mysterious tribe that, with the destruction of the Amazon, finds itself facing extinction because it has lost its land and means of living. It is about to disappear forever. In a daring scheme, it is up to the enigmatic Boaventura, a mixture of indigenous rights activist and adventurer, to lead the last of the kaajapukugi, as political refugees, to a sanctuary in Mexico. The idea provokes controversy, and the world watches attentively the rescue preparations. But Boaventura suddenly dies, and the person given the responsibility for concluding the plan is another activist with little knowledge of the tribe. He goes on to find himself in the midst of a macabre conspiracy and a mystery whose tentacles expand into both the past and the future. It is he who tells the story.\n\nIn the novel Death and Meteor (“A Morte e o Meteoro”), Joca Reiners Terron creates an intricate and surprising literary adventure that combines the end of the Amazon with ancestral secrets, anarchist Indians and hallucinogenic insects.\n\nQuotes\n\nDeath and Meteor\n\n»Death and Meteor is an extraordinary political dystopia. It’s a book to be read before the world ends. If you don’t read it by then, my friend, you’ve lost your parachute.«\n\nAilton Krenak\n\n»In at least one respect Death and Meteor leaves no room for doubt: the end of the kaajapukugi will also be the end of us all.«\n\nRating: excellent.\n\nGlobo\n\n»The most outstanding contribution of Brazilian literature to cli-fi this year.«\n\nO Estado de S.Paulo\n\n//\n\nThe Tremendous Sadness of the Snow Leopard\n\nThe Tremendous Sadness of the Snow Leopard (“A Tristeza Extraordinária do Leopardo-das-Neves”) intertwines the gripping stories of three main characters to form an intriguing whole. A man in his fifties looks after his senile father, not knowing he has a sick sister. A shifty nurse is taking care of a strange child that is only awake at night while a taxi driver lets his attack dogs loose to hunt for human prey. Then an innocent night excursion to the zoo to see the lonely snow leopard turns into a nightmare. As the mysterious child’s secret is unveiled, the man shows his sister the sun after 66 years of darkness.\n\nCombining beautiful language with a touch of irony and magic realism, Joca Reiners Terron’s latest novel is full of eerie suspense.\n\nQuotes\n\nThe Tremendous Sadness of the Snow Leopard\n\n»Terron demonstrates great literary strength, just like César Aira at his best.«\n\nFolha de S. Paulo\n\n»A beautiful novel that oscillates between the social and the mysterious.«\n\nO Estadão\n\n//\n\nFrom the Bottom of the Well You Can See the Moon\n\nFrom the Bottom of the Well You Can See the Moon (“Do Fundo do Poço se Vê a Lua”) is a fast-paced crime novel about identity and brotherly love, written in a style at once entertaining and violent.\n\nWilson and William are twins born in São Paulo in the 1980s but their similarities are merely physical. After a tragic accident, Wilson loses his memory and starts a new life in Cairo. But the past keeps nagging at his subconscious, and as the pieces start falling into place, he lures his long-lost brother to Egypt to confront him with what he now knows really happened that night…\n\nQuotes\n\nFrom the Bottom of the Well You Can See the Moon\n\n»A well-worked piece of literature that masterfully blends the real and the fictional.«\n\nO Estado de S.
