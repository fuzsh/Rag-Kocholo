        "text": "Yesterday, the Norwegian Ministry of Energy presented a proposal concerning the announcement of the first exploration licensing round for seabed minerals on the continental shelf. This proposal is now subject for public consultation until the 26th of September 2024. Following this process, the Ministry of Energy expects to start granting exploration licenses during the first half of 2025. Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea (NCLOS)\n\nOn my way to Edinburgh to present in the workshop: 'Cooperation in the High North between Scotland, Norway, and the Arctic Council: Towards more Secure and Sustainable Oceans' organized by Jessica S.. I will be presenting on he topic of seabed mining in Norway. I will also be joined by my good colleagues from Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea (NCLOS) - Vito De Lucia and Youri van Logchem, PhD. Looking forward to interesting discussions. Faculty of Law | UiT - The Arctic University of Norway\n\nIt was a pleasure to present at last week's Bl√•tt Kompass conference organized by Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic. In my presentation I focused on 'selected legal aspects concerning Norway's decision to open the NCS for seabed mining'. This is a controversial decision by the Norwegian Government which requires careful consideration, particularly in view of the law suit being brought by WWF Norway against the State. Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea (NCLOS) Faculty of Law | UiT - The Arctic University of Norway #lawofthesea #mining #seabed #seabedmining\n\nI will be following this case with great interest. This case is also bound to be mentioned during discussions in the conference Bl√•tt Kompass (6-7 June), where I will be presenting on different legal aspects concerning seabed mining in Norway. https://lnkd.in/gjgmp6rY #DeepSeabedMining #lawofthesea Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea (NCLOS) Faculty of Law | UiT - The Arctic University of Norway\n\nAt the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) with the Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea (NCLOS) to hear the unanimous advisory opinion in Case No. 31 on Climate Change and International Law. Also thinking that Portugal should consider in the future to nominate a 'certain' woman to serve as judge üòâ!\n\nIt was a pleasure to represent NCLOS together with my colleagues Richard Barnes and Bastiaan Klerk at the 'BBNJ Workshop: Regime interaction under the BBNJ Agreement', which was hosted by ANCORS in collaboration with Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea (NCLOS) , NUS Centre for International Law, Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST), Ocean Voices Programme, and The Nippon Foundation. This workshop resulted in a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities linked to EIA and ABMTs/MPAs as we move forward in operationalizing/implementing the BBNJ Agreement - both in terms of interactions with different IFBs and with national regimes. It was also a great opportunity to reunite with my former colleague and good friend Kristine Elfrida Dalaker, PhD. Faculty of Law | UiT - The Arctic University of Norway üåäü§ìüìö\n\nOn my way to Australia to present at the BBNJ Workshop: Regime Interaction under the BBNJ Agreement, hosted by the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources & Security (ANCORS) and organized in conjunction with the Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea (NCLOS) and other institutions. üåäüê®üá¶üá∫\n\nOn the 12th of April 2024, the Council of State formally decided to open parts of the Norwegian Continental Shelf to seabed mining exploration activities. Following this, WWF Norway has recently announced its intention take the Norwegian government to court if they do not reverse this decision. In my latest blog 'Norway formally opens the Norwegian continental shelf to seabed mining exploration activities: Rowing against the tide?' I provide my opinion on this matter. Blog available here: https://site.uit.no/nclos/\n\nHappy to have participated in the launch of a much needed book on 'The 1982 Law of the Sea Convention and the Regulation of Offshore Renewable Energy Activities in Areas Within National Jurisdiction' by Dawoon Jung. Congratulations Dawoon Jung on this major achievement! For those interested in or working in this field I recommend you get a copy if you don't already have one! https://lnkd.in/dfZmKqdZ University of Wollongong Norwegian Centre for the Law of the Sea (NCLOS) #lawofthesea #offshorewind #Offshore"
