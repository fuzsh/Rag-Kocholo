        "text": "The present article offers the edition, accompanied by an English translation, of a Coptic homily on the Cross and the Good Thief (CPG 2622; clavis coptica 0395) attributed to Theophilus of Alexandria. The edition is based on the Pierpont Morgan codex M595, ff. 141ro-148ro, a 9th century parchment codex, which belonged to the Monastery of the Archangel Michael, situated near Hamuli in the Fayyum oasis. The critical apparatus records the variant readings of the three other surviving manuscripts of Ps.-Theophilus’ sermon. The introduction contains the description of the manuscripts, as well as a commentary which links the sermon on the Cross and the Good Thief by Ps.-Theophilus to the Patristic exegetical tradition. Literary connections between the long hymn to the Cross, which appears in the text edited here, and similar material in the pseudo-Chrysostomic work In venerabilem crucem sermo (CPG 4525) are also pointed out."
