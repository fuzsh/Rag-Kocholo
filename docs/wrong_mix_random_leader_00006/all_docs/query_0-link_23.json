EXCH- bull The life span of the diabetic has been lengthened considerably following the discovery of Insulin and the growing knowledge of its use. There is, however, a definite responsibility on the part of the physician to educate the many new diabetics in the importance of proper diet and proper use of Insulin preparations. The apparent increase in diabetes in recent years has been attributed to the modern manner of living, increased sugar consumption, overeating and lack of muscular exer- cise. With proper management the great majority of patients can be kept well- nourished, sugar-free, and at work. Insulin Squibb is an aqueous solution of the active anti-diabetic principle obtained from pancreas. It is accurately assayed, uniformly potent, carefully purified, highly stable and remark- ably free of pigmentary impurities and pro- teinous reaction-producing substances. Insulin Squibb of the usual strengths is sup plied in 5-cc. and 10-cc. vials. Protamine Zinc Insulin, Squibb com- plies with the rigid specifications of the Insu- lin Committee, University of Toronto, under whose control it is manufactured and sup- plied. It is available in 10-cc. vials. When this preparation is brought into uniform suspen- sion, each cc. contains 40 units of Insulin together with protamine and approximately 0.08 mg. of zinc.

Those physicians who have in mind where they can obtain prompt typing tests and a quickly available supply of specific serum are thereby assuring their patients the best chance for recovery and the shortest possible period of illness. When adequate serum treatment is given early, lives are saved and complications prevented. When serum treatment is postponed and used only as a measure of last resort, it mav occasionally prove effective, but it has often failed. Bacteremia, a serious development, occurs with considerablv less frequency in cases where early, adequate serum therapy is instituted. 50lf 45 40 H35 < (t >-30 FATALIT Y R AT E S IN LOBAR PNEUMONIA ADULTS Bacteremia appears at varying times in the course of the disease, but usually after the third day. Bullowa* has presented the following significant facts concerning bacteremia in Type i and Type z pneumonias: In non-serum treated cases, the inci- dence of bacteremia is 2.5% in Type 1 and 43% in Tvpe z. The mortality in each of these bacteremias is close to 75% if serum is not used, and consid- erably lower when serum is used. §20 Id o tf 15 id CL 10 5 0 2 < D O a- r 5 a. 3 O CL U Id Id <fi CD a s H - li CL CL Id D a) a 1 LORD AND HEFFRON 2 BULLOWA b CECIL The importance of immediate typing, even at the first suspicion of pneumonia, cannot be overemphasized. *BLILLOWA, J.

For Children’s Colds In prescribing ‘Benzedrine Inhaler’ for chil- dren’s head colds, yon are providing a first aid remedy which may prove of constant service. At the first sign of a cold the child is in- structed to use the inhaler. Since benzyl methyl carbinamine is volatile, it penetrates to areas not readily accessible to licpiid in- halants, and there is no oil to he aspirated and become a potential source of later trou- ble by accumulating in the lungs. (Graef — Am. J. of Path., Vol. xi: No. 5, Sept. 1935.) For the adult members of the family, ‘Benze- drine Inhaler'' is equally useful. Each tube is packet! with benzyl methyl carbina- mine, .325 gin.; oil of lavender, .097 gm.; menthol, .032 gm. ‘Benzedrine’ is the trade mark for S. K. F.’s nasal inhaler and for their brand of the substance whose descriptive name is benzyl methyl carbinamine. tM**' civ Hhedical ASSN.

Jan., 1938 CANNED FOODS IN THE CONTROL OF LATENT AVITAMINOSIS Bl • Apparently mild vitamin Bi deficiency in humans is not characterized by very definite or entirely specific symptoms. While such a condition may be attended by anorexia, hypotonicity of the bowel, indigestion, vague pains and malaise, latent avitaminosis Bi hardly presents a picture which is favorable to its early clinical detection. However, there are two procedures which may be employed when this type of avita- minosis is suspected. The first procedure (la) depends upon the nature of the response to administration of pure vitamin Bi. The second procedure, which has been more widely applied, makes use of the Cowgill formula for calculation of vitamin Bi requirement. By considera- tion of the actual vitamin Bi intake and the calculated vitamin Bi requirement in any specific instance, the probability of mild avitaminosis Bi may be evaluated (lb). It is difficult to estimate the frequency of mild vitamin Bi deficiencies in the United States. However, until such information is at hand, it is not illogical to suggest that latent avitaminosis Bi must he regarded as an active possibility in some crises which may come to the attention of the medical practitioner. Fortunately, several factors are operative which give assurance that eventually the incidence of latent avitamin- osis Bi will be reduced to a minimum. First, those concerned with human nutri- tion have today more definite information concerning quantitative human vitamin requirements than ever before in history (2). Second, every passing year brings marked progress in education of the layman to the necessity of a completely \"protective” diet. The control of the latent avitaminoses is, in large part, dependent upon proper food selection and correct formulation of the diet by the layman consumer. In the establishment of dietary regimes which will be protective against vitamin deficiencies, commercially canned foods may play an important part. Several hun- dred canned foods are available upon the American market at all seasons of the year. Nutritional research has shown (3) that modern canned foods retain in good degree the vitamin Bi contents of the raw ma- terials from which they were prepared. This great class of foods — available to all consumers regardless of economic status — will contribute substantially to the allevia- tion and prevention of latent avitaminosis Bi in this country.

The swaddled infant pictured at right is one of the famous works in terra cotta exqui- sitely modeled by the fif- teenth century Italian sculp- tor, Andrea della Robbia. In that day infants were bandaged from birth to preserve the symmetry of their bodies, but still the gibbous spine and distorted limbs of severe rickets often made their appearance. Glisson, writing in 1671, described an ingenious use of swaddling bands — \"first crossing the Brest and com- ing under the Armpits, then about the Head and under the Chin and then receiving the hands by two handles, so that it is a pleasure to see the Child hanging pendulous in the Air . . .

Jan., 1938 A bambino from the Foundling Hospital, Florence, Italy, — A. della Robbia STRAPPED FDR RICKETS C WADDLING was practised down through the ^ centuries, from Biblical times to Glisson’s day, in the vain hope that it would prevent the deformities of rickets. Even in sunny Italy swaddling was a prevailing custom, recom- mended by that early pediatrician, Soranus of Ephesus, who discoursed on \"Why the Majority of Roman Children are Distorted.” \"This is observed to happen more in the neighborhood of Rome than in other places,” he wrote. \"If no one oversees the infant’s movements, his limbs do in the generality of cases become twisted. ... __ Hence, when he first begins to sit he must be propped by swathings of bandages. ...” Hundreds of years later swad- dling was still prevalent in Italy, as attested by the sculp- tures of the della Robbias and their contemporaries. For in- MEAD JOHNSON fants who were strong Glisson suggested placing \"Leaden Shooes” on their feet and suspending them with swaddling bands in mid-air. How amazed the ancients would have been to know that bones can be helped to grow straight simply by internal administration of a few drops of Oleum Percomorphum. What to them would have been a miracle has become a commonplace of science. Because it can be administered in drop dosage, Oleum Percomorphum is especially suitable for young and premature infants, who are most susceptible to rickets.

It is a favorite device of those who seek to obtain the sentiments of practitioners of medicine, but the responses are often disappointing to the questioners, both in number and in content. The reason for the paucity of the replies is plain when one analyzes the conditions under which the questions are often sent out. Questionnaires are sent for the purpose of obtaining two kinds of answers : 1. Opinions. 2. Information. When a new project is proposed by The Medical Society of New Jersey, the members are usually not prepared to supply exact infor- mation; and they hesitate to express an opinion on a subject in which they have had no per- sonal experience. Even when the subject is one in which a member is experienced, the scope of the expected answer is often indefi- nite. Let us suppose, for example, that a doc- tor is asked for his opinion regarding the ethics of establishing an immunization clinic for children. He is in the position of a witness in court from whom a clear-cut answer of “yes” or “no” is demanded. If the answer is “yes” under certain conditions, and “no” under others, the judge will sustain the witness if he says that the question cannot be answered in the form in which it is asked. If a questionnaire is to be answered intelli- gently, the conditions must first be stated clearly. For example, suppose the question is “Do you believe that the County Medical So- ciety should support an immunization clinic?” The doctor is entirely right in answering “No”. Cut under certain conditions the answer may properly be “Yes”. For an example, see this Journal for September, 1937, page 580, regard- ing the Hunterdon County Clinics. A questionnaire regarding “Facts” or mat- ters of record is entirely proper, as was the survey of cancer facilities in hospitals (Jour- nals February, 1937, p. 113, and April, 1937, p. 260). If a committee sends out a questionnaire relating to “Opinions” and “Attitudes” regard- ing a new project, it will elicit little response unless the committee first issues a series of instructive articles or letters explaining the project. Only then will the members be able to answer' the questionnaire intelligently. 2 EDITORIALS Jovr. Med. Soc. N. J. Jan., 1938 Leadership by the The Journal has traced the major features of the development of organized medicine in New Jersey from the foundation of The Medi- cal Society of New Jersey on July 23, 1766, to the formation of the Welfare Committee in 1919 and 1920. It has recently carried three articles on the major divisions of the organ- ization as follows : The Public Health Committee, Oct., 1937, p. 634. The Welfare Committee, Nov., 1937, p. 687. The Trustees, Jan., 1938, p. 42. These brief articles set forth the constant evolution of older forms and methods to fit new medical needs in keeping with progress in civic affairs along other lines. BASIS OF LEADERSHIP The system of medical organization of New Jersey has grown up under the leadership of active practitioners who have been trained in the school of private practice and the county medical society. Every proposal of the State Society has been based on the experience of its leaders, first as physicians in private prac- tice; second, as officers of their county socie- ties, and third, as ex-officers still filling posi- tions of trust in their county societies and serving on State Society committees. These facts account for the evolution of organized medicine in New Jersey in a consistent, orderly manner, with the inspiration arising from the State officers who have risen from the ranks of private practitioners and have returned to the ranks at the ends of their terms of official service. PRESENT EVOLUTION The field of the practice of medicine is now undergoing an evolution more rapidly than ever before, — partly spontaneously by practitioners themselves, and partly compulsory by the threat of direct operation of the system by the Fed- Welfare Committee eral Government. The physicians of New Jer- sey are better equipped than those of any other State to retain control of the evolution of the practice of medicine. This is so because for a period of 171 years the State Society and its component county societies have always been progressive and wise in the development of the organization of its members for the pur- pose of distributing efficient medical service to all classes of people. New Jersey is almost the only State in which the Federal officials have permitted the practicing physicians to manage and administer the execution of the Federal Security Act. This is because, when the law was passed, The Medical Society of New Jersey already had complete machinery in operation along the lines which was pro- posed by the Federal officers. This form of organization centered in the Welfare Com- mittee, which is, in effect, a union of all other committees engaged in the services of public health and public relations. MEETING OF THE WELFARE COMMITTEE The Welfare Committee is the one whose activities are concerned the most intimately with the daily practice of the general practi- tioner. The principal subjects which were dis- cussed at its meeting on December 19, 1937, were the means by which physicians in general practice may enlarge their fields of activity so as to include preventive medicine and those forms of practice which have heretofore been left to specialists, such as venereal diseases, crippled children, and the serum treatment of pneumonia. The members of the committee gave close attention to the reports of work already done, and of plans for the future. But in order that the good work may spread and flourish, the delegates must become home missionaries to their county societies ; they must inspire their colleagues with a knowledge of the progressive methods and a zeal for ap- plying them in their daily practice. Volume XXXV. Number 1 EDITORIALS 3 Locating for Practice Inquiries about opportunities for medical practice in New Jersey frequently come to the Executive Offices of The Medical Society of New Jersey; and in order to answer them with accurate facts a study was made of the supply and demand of physicians in New Jer- sey as compared with conditions in other States. A brief study was made in 1934, based on that year’s issue of the Directory of the Amer- ican Medical Association. This review showed that the number of physicians practicing in New Jersey had increased 13 per cent during the last three years; and then came New York, with eight per cent increase, Massachusetts, six per cent, and Pennsylvania with 4.6 per cent increase ; while the increase for the whole United States was three per cent. (Jour., Sept., 1934, p. 501.) A more extensive study of the number of physicians in New Jersey, New York and Con- necticut has just been made, based on the A. M. A. directories of 1936, 1934 and 1929. This study confirms the impressions of 1934, — that the increase in the number of physicians has outrun the increase in population and the op- portunity to practice. The results are set forth in the full-page set of tables on page 4. FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS New Jersey is located between the two great metropolitan areas of New York City and Philadelphia, which are ninety miles apart. These two cities are great centers of manufac- ture and trade ; and their prosperity is shared by the great cities of Newark, Jersey City and Elizabeth and their surrounding municipalities, and also by Camden and other municipalities adjoining Philadelphia. New Jersey seems to offer two great inducements for a successful medical practice : 1. Business opportunities. 2. Human need. These are the major incentives for physi- cians to settle in New Jersey. The State of Connecticut is also included in the study, for a large part of it is in the met- ropolitan area of Greater New York City. The whole State of New York is included, because each of the great cities from New York to Buffalo is also in fact a great center of popu- lation and business. Indiana is added because it is nearly like New Jersey in population. POPULATION PER DOCTOR The number of persons per doctor is taken as the fundamental basis of judging of a physician’s prospect for a successful practice. On this basis, New Jersey would seem to offer an attractive field of practice, for its average number of people per physician is greater than that of its sister States, and also of the United States as a whole. However, when the increase is reduced to percentages, as in the second col- umn of the table, the result is not so attrac- tive. Certainly no one can claim that in 1929 the people of New Jersey suffered from the lack of available physicians. Yet while the popula- tion of the State increased 10.7 per cent dur- ing the years 1929 to 1936, the number of phy- sicians increased 27.8 per cent, and the num- ber of persons per doctor decreased 13.3 per cent, or one-seventh. In the same period New York State showed an increase in population of 13.1 per cent, the number of physicians 17.7 per cent, and the number of persons per doctor decreased 8.6 per cent. Connecticut showed an even greater ten- dency to an over-increase in medical service, for its population decreased seven-tenths of one per cent, while its number of physicians increased 20.4 per cent, and the population per physician decreased 16.9 per cent. The tables on page 4 give the correspond- ing figures for the entire United States, and show a nearly stable population per physician. CONCLUSION The supply of physicians in New Jersey is rapidly increasing beyond the actual need of the people ; and a physician seeking an attrac- tive field of practice had better seek a locality, outside of the great metropolitan States of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut un- less he can become associated with an estab- lished practice to which he may eventually expect to succeed. 4 EDITORIALS Jour.

As I sat back and listened to these reports of work done or contemplated in the field of preventive medicine, service to the poor, and the cooperation with govern- mental agencies in various fields of public health, it was impressed upon me more and more how many of our men were engaged not only in work which was not remunerative to themselves so far as actual time spent was concerned, but also in work which was delib- erately aimed at cutting down the amount of possible future efforts which they might other- wise make at a return to themselves.

What business is there whose workers and salesmen would spend time for which they are not paid to cut down their own market? Then, as this thought was turned over in my mind, I remembered a group of women in one of our suburban towns before whom I had the pleasure of appearing recently. They were quite interested and much enthused over statements that were made to the effect that we did have this large number of committees and men actively interested in improving the health of the citizens of New Jersey, reducing the morbidity rate, and all in all making our State a more healthful place in which to live. If organized medicine wishes to be con- sulted in regard to matters medical, they must assume the leadership in all public health lines. Volume XXXV. Number 1 EDITORIALS I believe our citizenry would rather hear from the medical profession on such subjects than from laymen engaged in similar lines ; but if we do not stand ready and willing to give the aid and assistance they are looking for, we cannot blame them for obtaining it from whence they can. Such work as our Public Health Advisory Committees are doing cannot help but make large sections of our public health-conscious, if we but let them know of our efforts. So, perhaps it may prove that in doing this public service with no immediate personal return and with the definite aim of lowering the morbidity rate, we may still educate the public to pay more attention to their physical well-being; and when they are in need of medical care and medical advice, to come to us instead of de- pending on self-medications, patent medicine, or cult therapy. Then will the Biblical saying be exemplified, “Cast thy bread upon the wa- ters, for thou shall find it after many days.” W. G. Herrman, President, The Medical Society of New Jersey. Freedom of Medical Practice The American doctor of today shares with his professional brothers the world over an age-old tradition, — the Hippocratic code of ethical conduct. Although the world often misunderstands the code, it is a simple one in which the welfare of the patient transcends all else. FREEDOM OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE The American doctor shares with the doc- tors of the world another age-old tradition, — a zealous devotion to progress. A medical truth once proved is immediately disseminated to all parts of the civilized world. By no means all of the discoveries in medi- cine were made by doctors. Many laymen have brought incense and myrrh and precious gifts to the healing art. Truth may be dis- covered in the retorts of a lay Pasteur or brought to light in the dark corridors of Scu- tari by a lady with a lamp. Truth may be torn from the bark of a tree by a Jesuit priest. No matter whence it comes, doctors the world over accept the proven truth, charlatans to the contrary notwithstanding. This is really scien- tific and scientifically real. Yet another traditional heritage handed down to the doctors of all lands is the princely privi- lege of caring for the unfortunate lame, halt, and blind who can ever hope to pay for their care except in gratitude. The code of ethics, the eagerness to spread medical knowledge, and the willingness to help those in distress are characteristics of doctors in Japan, Italy, Spain, Germany, America, — of doctors everywhere. AMERICAN SCIENTIFIC MEDICINE But, notwithstanding these characteristics common to doctors of all lands, the American doctor is becoming increasingly' different from his Old World confreres. The American doc- tor works in an atmosphere of freedom. — free- dom of speech, freedom of thought and free- dom of actions. His initiative is not destroyed by dictatorship or by bureaucracy. His pro- fessional progress is not hobbled by govern- mental red tape. His ambition is not stifled by collectivism and his effectiveness is not marred by lay control. The American doctor of today, unlike his professional brothers abroad, is spurred by the friendly competition of his col- leagues. His livelihood depends not upon a check from the government, not upon political preferment, but rather upon his ability to keep abreast of the times. In the old days Ameri- can doctors went to Europe for post-graduate study. But now the tide has turned. The doc- tors of Europe who can afford it come to Amer- ica, for here medicine is on the march, as yet surprisingly free from governmental regimen- tation and lay supervision. American medicine is where it is because it lias thrived in freedom. Our forefathers carved out a free land where any man could seek and find and speak the truth; where any man could lift himself and his children to higher social and economic levels by honest toil ; where a poor boy could become independent and an underprivileged youth could become President. This was one of the monumental achievements of the ages. G EDITORIALS Jour. Med. Soc. N. J. Jan., 1938 Freedom is priceless and must lie preserved at any cost. Complexity of life has narrowed the range of individual liberty, but nothing must ever destroy the love of freedom, which en- dows us with the right to become self-support- ing, self-reliant and self-respecting. But, to- day, even in America, leaders in high places would pull us about like puppets on wires re- gardless of tradition, heritage, ambition, or per- sonal capacity. The sacrifice of self-reliance and self-respect is too great a price to pay for temporary and synthetic prosperity. AMERICAN DISTRIBUTION OF MEDICAL SERVICES The medical profession and the public are aware of the present high standing of scien- tific medicine in America. But there is a wide- spread dissatisfaction with its distribution. Not all of the rich, not all of the great middle class and not all of the ten million unemployed in America receive all the scientific medical help available. To meet the failure in distribution, there have been proposed literally thousands of schemes. Sociologists, economists, politicians and organized medical groups each have pro- posed panaceas. Some would federalize the practice of medicine and make all doctors offi- cers of the government ; some would permit laymen to buy medical services and sell them for uniform premiums; some would subsidize all the physicians of counties and have them treat all residents, rich and poor alike ; some would have compulsory health insurance and pay for it by billions of tax-levied dollars ; some would furnish medical care for govern- ment employees with taxpayers’ money. These are but a few of the plans proposed. In ap- praising all these schemes, let us not mistake change for progress. Because distribution is imperfect, let us not destroy the most perfect medical product in the world today, — American medicine. Let us, therefore, not take from the American doctor the freedom to work unham- pered by political control. Let us not regiment him and destroy his initiative, nor rob him of the stimulus of competition. Let us not inter- pose between doctor and patient any third party. And what is even more important, let us not take from any free American the abso- lute freedom to choose his own doctor. The Medical Society of New Jersey has a plan for adequate distribution of medical ser- vices modelled after the old E. R. A. It awaits adoption by New Jersey. Meanwhile, the plans of the Welfare Committee and the Sub-Com- mittees are bearing fruit in cancer control, mental hygiene, crippled children, tuberculosis, child hygiene, venereal disease control, mater- nal health, adult health education, and pneu- monia control. Wm. J. Carrington, President-Elect, The Medical Society of New Jersey. Martyrs and Dictators It is often but a step from martyrdom to dictatorship. A martyr of the Middle Ages had the choice of either persisting in the open assertion of his independence, or withdrawing from his fellows and living the lonely life of a hermit. The early colonists of Massachusetts had the spirit of hermit martyrs who did not hesitate to banish or even hang their brethren who differed from them in what we consider to be unessential beliefs. Seeking freedom for themselves, they were intolerant of those who differed with them in either thought or action. It is unfortunate that today there are medi- cal practitioners who prefer to live the her- mit’s life rather than join their brethren in a common system of fraternalism. Charging the leaders of the medical society with practicing dictatorship, they themselves assume the role of dictators in asserting their own individuality and independence of thought and action. But, after all, their attitude is largely temperamen- tal. They are simply individualists. They are born so, and any form of coercive force only intensifies their persistence. They are seldom militant opponents of cooperative action. They are medical hermits who must be won with tolerance if they are to be won at all. It is better that they be in the medical society rather than be permitted to pose as martyrs to alleged domination. Volume XXXIV. Number 1 7 ORIGINAL ARTICLES COLLOIDAL THORIUM IN RADIOLOGIC PRACTICE By Raphael Pomeranz, M.D., Newark, N. J. Read before the Section on Radiology of the Annual Meeting of The Medical Society of New Jersey at Atlantic City, April 29, 1937. The present discussion is undertaken for the purpose of reviewing and evaluating the clini- cal and experimental data reported in the last six years on the use of colloidal thorium as a radio-opaque medium. The accumulated litera- ture on this subject is so vast that we can but mention a few of the more significant reports. “Thorotrast” is the commercial name for colloidal thorium oxydsol, in electronegative, 22 per cent solution. It is used for the visual- ization of the reticulo-endothelial system. Its radioactivity is small, as 100 cubic centimeters of thorotrast is equivalent to only 1.24x10° grams of radium; and its half value is reached in ten 10 years. With blood, it is miscible in any dilution, and produces no toxic effects, im- mediate or remote. Injected intraperitoneally or intravenously, it is retained by the reticulo-endothelial cells of the body, chiefly the liver, spleen, and hone marrow. Its elimination, which is very slow, occurs largely through the lungs and bile. The bulk of the injected thorium, however, is re- tained throughout the life-time of the individ- ual. Recently it was suggested by Robins 1 in a preliminary report that its elimination might be hastened by decholin. With the aid of this preparation, the thorium is excreted into the gastro-intestinal tract, where a large number of thorium granules can be found. Radt and Oka2 were the first to use colloidal thorium in the visualization of the liver and spleen. Since then much animal experimental work has been performed both in Europe and in America. While the European investigators, notably Einhorn,3 Buchner,4 Held.3 Kadrnka,6 and Leipert 7 have been occupied in visualizing parts of the reticulo-endothelial system and in studying the rates of distribution and retention of the thorium, we here in this country have been studying the tissue changes in animals. This was stimulated by Martland’s report s on luminous dial workers. Menville,9 Pomeranz,10 Pohle,11 and Ritchie 12 have presented evidences of degenerative and cirrhotic changes in the liver and spleen occurring in from six to eight- een months after the injection, and attributable to thorium overdosage. In some cases the amount used was as much as ten times the average quantity. On this point, the recent work of Naegeli 13 is illuminating. He reported on tissue changes in the liver of a dog killed five years after the injection of thorium. The organ revealed peculiar degeneration adeno- mata containing clumps of thorium. There were also adhesive changes around the splenic and hepatic capsules. Clinically, however, none of his animals showed any ill effects. On the other hand, Robbins, Tripoli, and Hamm 14 found no untoward tissue changes resulting from radioactivity six months after injection. They question the interpretation of the tissue damage found by others, suggesting that simi- lar hepatitis and cirrhotic changes could be pro- duced by other substances, such as tetrachlore- than. Indeed, a specific instance of this type of damage has been reported by Bollmann and Mann.15 These authors all agree that the thor- ium does not produce any functional damage to the reticulo-endothelial system in cases of infection. The liver and spleen, containing large num- bers of reticulo-endothelial cells, will retain the bulk of the injected thorium. The radiographs then show a homogenous shadow of these or- gans, which enables us to determine their size, shape, and position. After the thorium has been retained a year or more, it is redistributed to the regional hepatic and portal glands, and later to the peri-aortal nodes. This and other experimental data indicate that the absorption of thorium is not a wholly stable process. Part of the thorium is apparently again thrown into the blood stream and taken up by the reticulo- COLLOIDAL THORIUM IN RADIOLOGY— Pomeranz endothelial cells in other places, such as the bone marrow. Any pathological changes pro- ducing replacement or destruction of the he- patic or splenic parenchyma will be seen as a translucency in the otherwise uniform shadow of these organs. By this means, we can deter- mine the following conditions : In the spleen, secondary malignancy, cyst, thrombosis of ves- sels, or infarct ; in the liver: malignancy, ab- scess, cyst, leukemia or other blood dyscrasias, cirrhosis, syphilis (hepar lobatum), and in- farct. In the peritoneum: areas of metastases and localization of pancreatic or retroperitoneal tumors. DOSAGE A small dose, i. e., amounts of from five to fifteen cubic centimeters, may be used in such diagnostic procedures as arterio-venography, neurography (Saito10), and visualization of serous cavities, especially the peritoneum (Pomeranz10); pleura, lymph nodes, spinal canal, and even the cerebral surface (Lohr and Jacobi17). Recent experimental work reflects the use of minute amounts of thorium for the study and visualization of small traumatic and infectious bone lesions in animals. Solotukhin18 found a wave-like density over the point of injury of the shaft of the femur of a dog seventy-two hours after the injections of two cubic centimeters of thorium. I have just com- pleted a series of similar experiments, the re- sults of which are soon to be reported. For hepato-splenography, the dosage was formerly 75 cc., but this has been reduced to 40 or 50 cc., calculated as from 0.4 cc. to 0.6 cc. per kilogram of body weight. The material is in- jected in two or three installments, on succes- sive days.- Smaller doses, totalling from five to fifteen cubic centimeters each, may be used in other diagnostic procedures. HEPATOSPLENOGRAPHY Extensive use has been made of thorium in the problem of visualizing the spleen and liver. Rigler 19 reported 174 human subjects, observed for three years. Yater and Odell 20 recently- presented their experiences with 200 cases. They predict that hepatosplenography with stabilized thorium dioxide sol will eventually Jour. Med. Soc. N. J. Jan., 1938 be recognized as an essentially harmless and clinically valuable procedure. Some of their patients who had carried the thorium for four or five years were reported to have had no ill effects. Teschendorff,21 in a book published in 1937, omits all discussion of liver pathology associated with hepatosplenography, stating that the final action of thorium is unknown. In his opinion, pneumo-peritoneum can furnish the same help in the differential diagnosis of abdominal tumors as can hepatosplenography. RADIOACTIVITY Thorium is a radioactive substance. A bot- tle containing 12 cc. of thorotrast will blacken a film and produce an image of interposed metal in seven days. Kadrnka,6 Oliver, and (according to Yater and Odell 19) even the Bureau of Standards, however, consider its radioactivity negligible. On the other hand, Taft22 had demonstrated recently by means of the Geiger counter that the ashed substance of the human liver injected with 75 cc. of thorotrast contained 1.37 microgms of radio- active material. Martland,8 Schlundt,23 and the American Medical Association 24 have warned the profession of the hazards inherent in the intravenous use of any radio-active substance. Their opinion was based chiefly on experiences with the luminous dial workers, who devel- oped regenerative types of pernicious anemia ; and later, bone malignancies, due to the reten- tion of the radio-active substance in the bones. The decomposition of this material into meso- thorium was probably a factor. According to Martland,8 the danger lies in the continuous bombardment of the bones with alpha rays of thorium. When prolonged over a period of many years, this enhances the induction of malignant bone tumors. The smaller the ini- tial dose, the less the danger, and the longer the latent period before the onset of symp- toms. Some of the dial workers developed bone sarcoma ten years after exposure with as little as two micrograms of radio-active substance in the bones. Gye 25 recently reported the ex- perimental production of osteosarcomata in animals with thorium dioxide sol. The elapsed time of seven years is, in the opinion of Mart- land,8 a criterion entirely insufficient for the COLLOIDAL THORIUM IN RADIOLOGY— Poraeranz Volume XXXV. Number 1 establishment of the harmfulness of the thorium. HARMFUL EFFECTS From this brief review, it is apparent that on the question of the safety of this medium there are two schools of thought. One consid- ers it hazardous, the other thinks it harmless. Evidence can be cited to support either con- tention. What is our own stand in this mat- ter? I shall formulate it in this manner: The routine, indiscriminate use of colloidal thorium is prohibitive because the drug is defi- nitely radio-active, and may induce late bone malignancy. The time factor is contingent on the dosage ; lack of development of malig- nancy seven years after injection is not evi- dential of the menace of the drug, nor is it proof of its harmlessness. Doses of about fifty cubic centimeters, sug- gested in hepatosplenography, should be em- ployed only in elderly patients with incurable diseases. This dosage might also be used pre- operatively for diagnostic purposes in cases of abdominal or breast malignancy. In a word, dosages of such magnitude may be used in incurable conditions where it will help in the diagnosis, because in these cases, the lowered life expectancy of the patient necessarily re- duces the hazard of radio-activity. In such cases, every effort should be made to secure an autopsy for further study of the tissue changes. Many of these patients will live more than five years, and microscopic studies in such instances are especially valuable. Dosages of about 15 cc. should be used diag- nostically only when other methods have failed. Here again, the subsequent study of the case should be thorough, with particular regard to the accumulation of histologic data. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Robins, S. A., and Goldberg, B.

Associate in Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins Medical School Read before the Pediatric Section of The Medical Society of New Jersey at its 171st Annual Meeting, April 29, 1937, in Atlantic City, N. J. The pediatrician and the psychiatrist are each interested in the treatment of the psychologic difficulties of children. The pediatrician, how- ever, is really more in need of a sound under- standing of the normal psychology of children than is the psychiatrist, because the doctor in contact with both physically sick and well chil- dren must needs be educator, and only rarely does he have to be quasi psychiatrist. Further- more, it is the work of the pediatrician to be a prophylactic psychiatrist. Therefore, I feel that it is important that the pediatrician become acquainted with the methodology and outlook of psychology, — particularly medical psychol- ogy. I think the pediatrician should occupy a position in psychology analogous to the school physician in the physical health set-up of the schools. The heads of the physical education department provide normal and wholesome ex- ercise, and proper ventilation and adequate play. The school physician is interested in the control and prevention of disease. The treat- ment of disease is a field for the physician di- vorced from the school. EMOTIONAL TRAINING Now, on the mental side the educator is primarily oriented toward the acquirement of intellectual technic, and the expression of nor- mal emotional needs. He is not very inter- ested in the prevention of mental abnormality. Between the field of the development of intel- lectual technics and the treatment of abnormal conduct disorders there is a large field of psy- chologic need which neither the educator nor the psychiatrist can fill. This is the job of the pediatrics psychologist and it is to him that I would direct this talk. Whenever I talk about the training and di- rection and correction of children, I find myself driven to discuss before all else the problem of hereditary or constitutional endowment. I find myself frequently overstating my case against the hereditary and constitutional ele- ments of human endowment. I ask myself, “Why do I get driven to this position?” I do not believe it is stupidity on my part, or un- willingness to face frankly what is inborn or purely dispositional in human beings ; nor do I think I am blinded by an undue optimism. I believe my attitude comes as a reaction against the psychologic blindness of the present- day beliefs about the directing of human con- duct and behavior. Who would today recommend so inefficient a method of educating children in the intellec- tual fields and technical skills as that which we follow in the field of emotional and behavior training of children? If I were to suggest to you that all children be given their intellectual education by remain- ing at home with their parents, servants, and neighbors, and that instruction be given the children when by accident the child had a de- sire to know something or when his lack of knowledge made him unable to buy a pound of sausage, or unable to look up a movie list in the newspaper for his parents, and then to let the adult give him a few minutes of inconsis- tent instruction, I am sure that you would think I was as mad as my hospital clientele. Or if I were to suggest that piano playing could be learned by simply relying upon the inborn musical ability of the child put into a room with a piano without any insistence upon practice or instruction, you would say that I didn’t know anything about education. Would I be remotely justified in concluding, if the child in the room with the piano, without prac- ticing and without instruction, did not learn to be a brilliant musician, that the child was born without musical ability? Yet we know that some children do pick up quite a bit of information without being taught in school, and do learn to play the piano by ear without in- struction. Now the method of intellectual and technical- skill learning just suggested is not far from the Volume XXXV. Number 1 CONDUCT DISORDERS IN CHILDHOOD— Hohman 11 method used by the average teacher, doctor, parent, or nurse in the field of emotional and behavior training. As some children just happen to pick up in- formation without any schooling, or just hap- pen to learn to pick out tunes on the piano, just so some children “happen” to “behave” reasonably well emotionally, and happen to be able to learn the ability to get along in the world without training. But I insist that no- body is today willing to leave the learning of knowledge or special skills to the “just hap- pening”. If we did, we would conclude that the native or inborn educability of human be- ings both as regards knowledge and special skills was very low. There certainly would be a very low general level of knowledge in the community, and no musicians at all. But in the field of the emotions and human behavior, we are ready to accept the “chance” level of emotional and behavior educability and to regard it as fixed and for the most part the result of inborn disposition. TRAINING TEACHERS TO TEACH Again in the field of education and the teach- ing of special skills we require very special training for the teaching of children. Teach- ers must be educated thoroughly in educational theory and practice through several years of college training. For the teaching of special skills we require even higher standards. Yet in the field of emotional and conduct training practically anybody, no matter how unlettered, no matter how unstable, no matter how un- trained, is regarded as qualified to guide. Leav- ing aside the average parent who has no train- ing whatever for raising children, how much training has the average nurse girl or servant for handling any problem in the emotional sphere? Parents may happen in the rare case to be intuitively skillful in this field, but this is only the very rare case. Actually how much does the average physician or pediatrician know about scientific psychologic theory or practice? Even the best of parents and physicians are apt to say that good common sense is all that is required. Now how much value has good common sense in the treatment of children’s diseases without a knowledge of bacteriology, immunology, surgery, — in fact, all the special technical knowledge of pediatrics? I hardly know one good or bad pediatrician who does not feel himself qualified to discuss the psycho- logic training of children without any special knowledge of psychiatry or psychology. Al- most invariably when children begin to turn out badly in the emotional or conduct spheres, the parent and the teachers and physicians are surprised that loving common-sense care should have failed ; they immediately conclude that the child was born inferior, or unstable, or crim- inal. I feel that if we make the comparison be- tween medieval and modern medicine, we would find that most of our concepts about psychologic training belong to the medieval side. PURPOSE OF BEHAVIOR Perhaps now it might be wise for me to tell you some of the things that I think you should know, rather than quarrelling with you about the things you think you know. I have formulated a rule about the training of children which I know to be empirically true. Empirically, I say, because I have tried it often enough to make me certain that it is a fact. The rule is to the effect that no child holds onto any pattern of behavior (including emotional, or conduct response) unless it serves the child some useful purpose. Now that pur- pose is frequently bad for the child, and more frequently worse for its future adulthood; but there is always a purpose served. As soon as the environment robs the behavior of the pos- sibility of serving this purpose, the pattern of behavior drops out. and will be reinstated again only when satisfaction is permitted to accrue to a repetition of the behavior. How long does a baby cry at night ? Only so long as it has a chance of being picked up, or being fed, or getting attention. How long will a child continue to have tem- per tantrums? As long as a tantrum will pro- duce a stick of candy, or the achievement of some desire, or the reversal of some parental command. How long will a child refuse unliked food? 12 CONDUCT DISORDERS As long as there is a chance to get other food of its liking. I have asked these questions to you as pedia- tricians because I take it for granted that the answers are matters of common pediatrics knowledge. Now let me ask some analagous ones, the answers to which may seem less obvious. How long will a child remain fearful of the dark? How long will it be fearful or shy of strang- ers ? How long will it be tearful or pout after it has been thwarted or injured? How long will it remain excited at a birth- day party? Or again to turn from the purely emotional sphere to conduct? How long will it invent fanciful tales or tell lies? How long will it be impudent? How long will it be rude? How long will it steal ? How long will it be disobedient? Let us consult our rule, — only so long as the pattern of behavior serves some purpose of sat- isfaction for the child. Rob the behavior, be it in the conduct sphere or the emotional sphere, of its end or aim, and the pattern disappears. I am sure that many of you will not believe that I am correct in this because you will say what purpose or aim can unhappiness serve? What purpose can fear serve? The answer is — the same kind of purpose that the crying of the infant does, when it wants to be picked up; or the purpose that is attained by refusing any kind of food ; or the purpose that is served by a temper tantrum. Let me give you examples. Frankly, I do not expect you to believe me because your human sympathies will be aroused, and you will be saying to yourself, “How unsympathetic to treat a sensitive child in this way. I don’t be- lieve it will work.” Here are two little girls both eleven years of age — both fearful and unhappy about death. Both children are very well behaved, obe- dient, thoughtful, very intelligent, gentle, and friendly. Both are models in school and at home. Neither could by any stretch of the imagination be thought of as a problem child. IN CHILDHOOD — Hohman Jour. Med. Soc. N. J. Jan., 1938 The one had always been afraid of the dark. For two years before the appearance of death fears (accompanied by anxiety symptoms of shortness of breath, palpitation, and the sense of impending death) I urged the mother of the little girl that she was unwise in yielding to the child’s desire to have a light in her room at night. The mother felt that the child was too sensitive to force the issue. As friend and not physician I volunteered no further advice. But two years later a pediatrician asked me to see the child professionally because on the sev- eral preceding nights the little girl could not sleep, had developed anxiety symptoms, and was afraid she was going to die, — because she couldn’t get her breath and thought her heart was going to stop. The pediatrician could find nothing wrong and therefore asked me to see her. What does the rule say? Get rid of the sat- isfactions accompanying any mode of behavior. What are the satisfactions here? Attention from the mother, and sympathy from the mother. Rob the pattern of these satisfactions, and the pattern will go. We did this! We closed her door at night, turned out the light, and assured her that no amount of fear or crying would bring her mother to her, and it did not. Within three nights she was back on normal sleep. The fears, as far as objective observation or behavior could indicate, were gone. In fact, two years later there was no memory of the fears. At least when she teased a younger sister about a minor fear, I could elicit no memory in her of her former fears. The second little girl became fearful of the imminence of death after her intimite friend, a child a year older, had told her of the pos- sible death of a cardiac grandmother. My pa- tient reassured her friend, but fell heir to the same fear when she discovered accidentally that a friend of her own mother had dropped dead suddenly. She began to fear for the life of her own mother, and then for her own life. The school physician helped her by reassuring talk, but the fear recurred in a few days and the unhappiness became so profound that the school physician thought she should see a psy- chiatrist especially when she found that she could not reassure the child a second time. Volume XXXV. Number 1 CONDUCT DISORDERS IN CHILDHOOD— Hohman 13 Interesting facts in this child’s background were these — the mother had had some unrea- sonable fears herself ; also, in addition, unhap- piness was able to compel sympathy and atten- tion in the household. There was not much unhappiness in the household; but when it did exist, everybody gave sympathy and attention. The mother was really a very intelligent wo- man and gave evidence of her intelligent hand- ling of this child when she had refused to per- mit her to be promoted into a higher grade in which the child could have competed success- fully on the intellectual, but not on the emo- tional and social side. Now we used the same rule. We told the little girl that we could not give her real re- assurance about the danger of death — nobody could. We insisted that people did not and could not live in the aura of potential danger, but had to live as if there was not to be catas- trophe. We then told her that if she insisted upon being unhappy she would have to have the experience alone. As soon as she felt as if she must weep or appear downcast, she was to go to her room and stay until she had mus- tered sufficient control to conduct herself as if she were cheerful. Four hours the first day, and then one hour the second day were enough to change the mood. Nobody had paid the slightest attention to her, and nobody showed any signs of sympathy. Every bit of accessory satisfaction was eliminated from the dramatic unhappiness, and the unhappiness disappeared. Why should unhappiness disappear, or why should fear disappear when accessory satisfac- tions are eliminated? I insist that this follows from the nature of the conditioning of emo- tional behavior. REINFORCED CONDITIONING OF REFLEXES If we return to the classical experiments of Pavlov on the conditioning of the alimentary reflex, we must realize that even the most thor- oughly set conditioning requires reinforcement from time to time. That is even if we so con- dition the animal that it responds regularly with salivation when a bell is rung, neverthe- less it is necessary from time to time to give the dog meat. If we fail to reinforce or offer reward after repetitions of the conditioned stimulus the reflex is extinguished; i. e.. the dog will not salivate when it hears the ringing of the bell. Now the whole set-up of the con- ditioned reflex requires the use of reinforce- ment,— and reinforcement is just a type of re- ward or aim. The failure of reinforcement or reward means the extinguishing of the reflex temporarily, and finally permanently. This holds as true for desirable as for undesirable conditioned reflexes. All conditioned reflexes are builded in the same manner. They always make use of an unconditioned response, and the simultaneous use of a new stimulus. The unconditioned reflexes, as you know, are pres- ent at birth, or appear in the course of growth development, and do not have to be taught or learned. The first time food is put into the mouth of the newborn, alimentary reflexes are set going. The first touching of the lips of the infant starts sucking movements. The group of unconditioned reflexes is not limited to the alimentary responses, but includes in addition to the secretory and the motor group, a defi- nite group of emotional responses. Release the support from a new-born infant, or let it hear loud noises, and a response is elicited which resembles what we call fear. Restricting the free movements of the infant causes a reflex which looks like anger. Pain or hunger arouses something very like unhappiness — fondling and stroking something like happiness. The infant or animal has only these uncon- ditioned emotional responses to start with, but immediately the process of connecting itself with the outside world begins, and this is done by means of its cerebrum — through the mech- anism of the conditioned reflex. These uncon- ditioned reflexes exist in the absence of a cor- tex, but not so the conditioned responses. De- stroy the cortex, and you destroy the ability to establish conditioned reflexes — those reflexes which orient the child to the outside world. It is important to stress the idea of “reflex”, because widespread cortical connections can, and are, made without any intervention of purposive or so-called conscious activity. The conditioned reflex works as automatically as any other physiologic function. The range of stimuli is great in cerebral physiology, and the possible number of combinations is very large, 14 but the patterns formed are automatic and understandable. An interesting example of cortical connec- tion is given in the following: If we inject morphine into a dog, we will get sweating, salivation, vomiting, and then sleep. Apparently there is some sort of center in the brain which controls vomiting and sleep when stimulated through the blood stream by the morphine. Now at the same time that the dog is receiving the injection of morphine he is receiving visual and auditory stimuli from the presence of the experimenter. After a num- ber of injections, just the presence of the ex- perimenter with the hyperdermic needle will arouse the same train of responses as did the internal physical stimulus of morphine given through the blood stream. It is clear that two separate portions of the brain — that giving rise to vomiting and sleep, and that connected with seeing and hearing, — got connected by some pathway, so that the two separated stimulated regions in the brain resulted in the same final pathway; i. e., that leading to vomiting and sleeping. In this experiment, which was first observed accidentally and only later was subjected to experimental proof in Pavlov’s laboratory, we see how very accidental and bizarre is much of conditioning. To give an example from the emotional sphere — a little boy two and a half years of age suddenly became afraid of what was for- merly his beloved goldfish. For a long time no explanation could be found until his mother remembered that just at the time that the fear developed the child had been playing with the fish during a thunder storm. Immediately the explanation was clear — loud noise had condi- tioned the child with fear against the fish. I think that a realization of the accidental nature of conditioning will make us understand that we do not have to assume an inborn disposi- tion everytime we find an odd trait in the child. As we study the conditioned reflex inten- sively we find that there is a constant inter- play between excitation and inhibitory stimuli and often a stimulus that is excitory under one Jour. Med. Soc. N. T. Jan., 1938 set of circumstances may under other circum- stances become inhibitory. A stimulus which at one time might elicit an unconditioned re- sponse of defense may in turn become a con- ditioning stimulus for positive food responses — i. e., e. g. pain can be made to cause saliva- tion if an association with food is arranged. All conditioned responses tend to become ex- tinguished if they are not followed by rein- forcement or reward. For example, if food does not remain associated with pain by giv- ing meat from time to time, the association is broken. Now if we put these rules about the condi- tioned reflex together and look at the emo- tional sphere, we can see why and how our rule is made to work. Anger, and fear, and tearfulness are uncon- ditioned responses which are ready from birth for conditioning. Mainly by accident I sus- pect they get connected with a variety of cir- cumstances in the outside world; and if re- wards follow invariably or sufficiently fre- quently, the reflex or behavior become firmly conditioned. If reinforcement does not take place in the way of rewards, the forces of inhi- bition come in and the pattern is destroyed or extinguished. Inhibition of rage takes place when no stick of candy follows. But on the contrary, pain may lose its painful quality if a stick of candy does follow. Now in many situations the stick of candy may be repre- sented by a pleasant emotion ; and the pleas- ant emotion becomes the reinforcing reward. Leave out the reward of the pleasant emotion, and the unpleasant emotional pattern will be destroyed or extinguished. I feel that this ex- planation of the nature of conditioning the un- pleasant behavior accompanied by unpleasant mood, by means of the pleasant mood reward, explains the reason why “bad” behavior pat- terns get eliminated without positive punish- ment. I think it also explains why many ap- parently destructive patterns go on existing — we ignore the existence of the pleasant com- ponent. Often it is difficult to find or to see easily what the pleasure component is. But if we bear in mind that all condition reflexes are outside world orienting, and that they will dis- CONDL'CT DISORDERS IX CHILDHOOD— Hohman Volume XXXV. Number 1 CONDUCT DISORDERS IN CHILDHOOD— Hohman 15 appear if not reinforced by reward, — then the search for the reward element will be more often successful. Let me add another point about the nature of the conditioned reflex ; quantitative and qualitative strength of stimulus and strength of unconditioned reflex play an important role. To extinguish or destroy a strong positive re- flex requires equally strong inhibitionary influ- ences. What will destroy a weak or new con- ditioning will not inhibit a long-continued or strong conditioning. Modern parents and child guiders today are trying the experiment of using words (they call it reasoning) as the omnipotent inhibiting influence. As far as I can see, this is like using a fountain spray to extinguish a raging fire. The extinguishing inhibition is not strong enough. Try to talk a child out of eating after it has been starved for two days — that is when the hunger drive is powerful. Of course the same words may be effective when the child has just been fed. Talking a child out of a temper tantrum is about as sensible as allaying hunger with an oration. The inhibiting influ- ence must be of the same order of strength, as the positive conditioning. Furthermore, the very nature of the type of the conditioned re- flex may eliminate from usefulness such inhib- i"
