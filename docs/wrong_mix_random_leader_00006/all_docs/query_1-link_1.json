        "text": "Spanish (MarÃ­a); Italian and Portuguese; Hungarian (MÃ¡ria): from the female personal name, Latin Maria. This was the name of the mother of Jesus Christ in the New Testament, as well as several other New Testament figures. The Latin form of the name, on which all common variants from European languages are based (including English Mary ), derived as a back-formation from the early Christian female name Mariam. This was mistaken for an accusative case, with the usual Latin feminine accusative ending -am, but in fact it is an Aramaic form (originally Maryam) of the Hebrew name Miryam. The Hebrew name is of uncertain etymology, perhaps from a word meaning âwished-for childâ, from an Egyptian root mrj with the addition of the Hebrew feminine diminutive suffix -am. Saint Jerome understood it as a compound of mar âdropâ + yam âseaâ, which he rendered as Latin stilla maris, later altered to stella maris âstar of the seaâ, whence the medieval Christian liturgical phrase."
