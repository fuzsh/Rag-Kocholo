        "text": "Soldiers toppled the government of the tiny and potentially oil-lush West African nation of São Tomé and Príncipe at dawn today while the president was out of the country.\n\nSoldiers with machine guns patrolled the quiet streets of the capital after taking control of critical sites in a flurry of shooting around 3 a.m.\n\nPresident Fradique de Menezes was in neighboring Nigeria, working to help São Tomé develop its potential oil producing capacity, when the soldiers seized power in a move they said was intended to end the country's abject poverty.\n\nMr. Menezes appealed to fellow African leaders for help in restoring him to power. The Nigerian government wasted no time in issuing a strong warning that fell just short of a threat of military intervention should its interests be jeopardized.\n\nThe leader of the coup, Maj. Fernando Pereira, declared a state of emergency and said he wanted to form a transitional government.\n\n''The people are dying of hunger,'' Major Pereira told reporters. ''The politicians are doing nothing.'' He said soldiers were also suffering.\n\nSoldiers detained Prime Minister Maria das Neves and senior officials including the public works minister, Joaquim Rafael Branco, who is responsible for the oil reserves that could determine the country's future.\n\nMajor Pereira declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew, and coup leaders were meeting with the detained officials.\n\nSão Tomé has been shaken by political turmoil, partly because of wrangling over what may be billions of barrels of crude lying off its coast, though no oil has yet been found.\n\nAfrica's west coast, with oil reserves stretching from Angola north to Nigeria, is taking on increasing strategic significance as the United States tries to reduce its reliance on Middle Eastern sources.\n\nThe United States condemned the overthrow and urged the release of the detained ministers. ''We deplore these actions,'' said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman.\n\nIn the Nigerian capital, Abuja, Mr. Menezes called for help from ''all democrats, world leaders and African leaders'' to end the coup.\n\n''Africa cannot attain greatness with bad governance, corruption and coups d'état,'' he said. ''We must toe the path of democracy, good governance, transparency and civil liberty.''\n\nThe African Union called on the coup leaders to release the government members. Portugal, the country's former colonial master, called the coup ''an attempt to upset constitutional order.''\n\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe, Senegal and Ghana also condemned the coup. There was no immediate comment from Angola, which helped end a coup in São Tomé in 1995, when young officers took over the country for a week to protest poverty. They were pardoned after Angolan mediators persuaded them to return to their barracks."
