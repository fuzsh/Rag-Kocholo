        "text": "The tenth century Christian philosopher and theologian Yaḥyā ibn ῾Adī uses the triad ‘generosity-wisdom-power’ to characterise the Christian Trinity especially in his apologetic writings. The prolegomena to philosophy in general and to Aristotelian philosophy in particular, which precede the text of the Isagoge and of the Categories in the Alexandrian tradition, employ the same three attributes to describe the divine. As the prolegomena were translated into Arabic and most probably highly influential in logical education during the first Abbasid centuries, I suggest that Yaḥyā chose the triad ‘generosity-wisdom-power’ known from the prolegomena to serve as common ground for him and his co-religionists as well as for his Muslim interlocutors, all equally trained in logic. Among the few surviving Arabic versions and fragmentary traces of the prolegomena, we find Yaḥyā’s triad in Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s commentary to the Isagoge and in some excerpts by the Aristotelian commentator known in Arabic as ᾿llīnūs, whose identity remains a puzzle today. This triad as well as other characterisations of the divine, which derive from the prolegomena literature and were probably transmitted by Yaḥyā, also found their way into the works of tenth and eleventh centuries Muslim philosophers, such as Miskawayh and al-Isfizārī.\n\nTerminological confusion exacerbated by councils divided the church in late antiquity. John of Damascus addressed the resultant terminological impasse by providing the reestablished Jerusalem Patriarchate with theological polemic that reemphasized the preeminence of the council of Nicaea. John’s early works relied on scripture and patristic argument, but after his philosophic works, his theological method couched scripture and patristic argument in terms of a new philosophic acumen. Building on this change in theological method, I argue that John’s theological argument also underwent development using the term “perichōrēsis” as a case study, resulting in a provisional date-list of John’s polemical works. I then argue that development in John appears to have an ecumenical motivation by analyzing his redeployment of the theological technical term “perichōrēsis” from his Christology to his Trinitarianism. I argue that John subordinates his Christology to a terminologically clarified Nicene Trinitarianism in order to address concerns of his local interlocutors by re-casting local christological debate in three ways: 1) he couched his Christology in terms of a specifically Nicene heresiology shifting fifth and sixth century theologians off-stage, whether Cyril of Alexandria, Severus of Antioch, or Maximus the Confessor, pushing Gregory of Nazianzus to the fore as universal authority; 2) he avoided the critique of Aristotelianism by couching his Christology in terms of the Nicene locus classicus, John 10.30; and finally, 3) he adroitly granted but restated the theological premise of his interlocutors turning their argument on its head. Thus, John grounds his innovative theological polemic in the tradition while providing his bishop and the newly reestablished patriarchate with a more progressive and ecumenical theological method, argument, and polemic.\n\nBy using several contemporaneous compilations now embedded in the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria, and by putting these in conversation with parallel texts produced in Syriac, this article explores the revitalisation of the contacts between the Severan patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch in the context of the late Marwānid and ʿAbbāsid periods. It argues that, while the commitment to communion was a shared inheritance of the late Roman period, the same commitment was renewed and refashioned in a quite different context, wherein the shifting distribution of power within the caliphate had placed the Alexandrian patriarchs in a position of distinct disadvantage and discomfort, far removed from the centres of patronage and of power.\n\nArian controversy is one of the most important debates in the history of Christianity. This controversy, which was the reason for the first general council, the Council of Nicaea (325), occupied the Christian world for a long time. On the other hand, Arianism has been a theme that has survived until our time in polemics between Muslims and Christians. While some Christian writers saw Islam as a kind of Arianism, some Muslim writers evaluated Arianism as “true Christianity” or “anti-trinitarian movement”. These approaches on both sides are not out of date, and are still mentioned by some in our time. In this study, we will try to take a critical look at these approaches within the framework of some marked examples."
