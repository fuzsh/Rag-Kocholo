It was not that he w^as the first to notice the mere existence of the institutions in various races nor evoe that he added very much to our knowledge of them. Hut with the intuition or genius he perceived or divined the far-reaching influence which in different ways the two institutions have exercised on the history of society. The great service which he rendered to science was that he put the right questions ; it was not that he answered them aright. He did indeed attempt, with some confidence, to explain the origin of exogamy, but his explanation is prob¬ ably erroneous. On the origin of totem ism he did not even speculator, if he did, he never published his speculations- To the test he appears to have regarded that problem as unsolved, if not insoluble. While McLennan’s discovery of exogamy attracted atten¬ tion and excited discussion, his discoveiy of totemism made comparatively little stir, and outside of a small circle *of experts it passed almost unnoticed in the general world of educated opinion. The very few writers who touched on the subject contributed little to its elucidation. For the most part they contented themsetves with repeating a few familiar facts or adding a few fresh theories ; they did not attempt a ew ide induction on the basis of * systematic collection and classification of the evidence. Accordingly, when in the TOTEMfSM AND EXOGAMY jisi year 1 SS6 mjf revered friend William kober^on Smith s % tliserple of MeberTnan^invited m& writ* the article oft totem ism for the Ninth Edition of the Etuyribpt&fiii *$nf- annka % which was then in course oT publication liiider his ■jditorjjlup, J had to do nearly the whole work of collection and classification for myself with very little help fiom my predecessors. The article ivhich embodied my researches having proved sgmew'hat too tong for its purpose an a^ridg* ment of it only was inserted m the Encydvptfdia ; but* through Robertson Smith's friendly mediation * Messrs. A* & C Black kindly consented to publish the original article* unabridged and unchanged, in the form of ji small volume. The book comprised little more than a ^ssified collection of facts, for when 1 wrote i t I had *w yet formed no theory either of totem ism or of exogamy. However, the neiv evidence which it contained appears to have been welcome to students of primitive man ; for since the appear¬ ance of the volume in i JSSy totem ism has received a large* perhaps exorbitant, share of their attention ; the literature of the subject* which was extremely scanty be Tore, lias swollen enormously in volume; and 5 better than a|] p there has been a large accession of facts observed and recorded among living totem ic tribes by competent scientific investi¬ gators, As the little book has long been out of print and is still, I am told* in demand, l decided to reprint it i and it now occupies the first place in these volumes. The errors which subsequent research has revealed in it are generally nof very serious. Such as they are,* the* reader will find „ them corrected in the Notes appended to the last volume, in which l have also been careful to retrench the boundaries of totem ism wherever* in the first ardour of exploration* I had pushed them too far, f beg the reader, therefore* to read the “Notes and Corrections 31 throughout in connection with my original treatise. * * Having decided to reprint Tatnuism I resolved to add PREFACE is ftp it by way of supplement some essays which in the mean- \\imc 4 had written on tie subject The.^nain purpose of the?\" essays, which appeared' in Tht Fortnightly Revie-.t> Tor the years ^899 and 1905, was to direct attention to the great importance of th(* discoveries of Messrs. Spencer and Gillen in Central Australia and to point oflt tiip nefcessify of revising and remodelling our old ideas oT tcftemiifllri and •exogamy ifl the light of the new' evidente, My judgment as to the need of that revision has never wavcr&d since, but it is only after many'years of study tTiat I have come to see Slow thoroughgoing that revision must he if our conceptions are to square with the facts. Holding this view I felt that t* reprint Totem tint without noticing discoveries Svhich had. in iny opinion, revolutionised the whole aspect of the sub¬ ject, would be unpardonable; hence my decision to add the essays in question as an appendix to the reprint. They now occupy the second place in this work- Like the original Totemism they arc republished without any change except the addition of a marginal summary. Such correc¬ tions and modifications of them as subsequent reflection and increased knowledge have suggested will be found in the Notes appended to the last volume. This was all that at first T proposed to do ; for my intcntiou*had long been to defer writing a larger treatise on totemism until the whole totemic harvest should have been reaped and garnered ■ and moreover at the time, a little more than two years ago, 1 was deeply engaged in other work which I was‘unwilling to interrupt To-day ^hc totemlc harvest still stands white to the sickle in many fields, but it may be left for others hereafter to see the sheaves brought home. My sun is westering, and the lengthening shallows remind me to work while it is day. He that as it may, having begun with a notice of the new r Australian evidence I thought I could hardly pass over in silence the additions which had been made to our know*- X TQTMM/SM AND EXOGAMY ledge or totcmtsm in other parts of the world, and thtft * p F insensibly, step # 3 y step, 1 was led-injo writing the Ethno* graphical Survey of Toternism which now forms the Jfcat hulk of this book. Its asm is to providc # .studcnvtffijh what may be called a digest or corpus of totem ism and exogamy, so far as 4 he Two institutions are found in conjunction. I bav? taken p^jns to compile it from the best sources, both published and unpublished, so far as these wer^ accessibtef to the rigid exclusion of all such as appeared to me to be ol dubious or less than dubious authority. The Tacts are arranged in ethnographical order, tribe by tribe, and an attempt has been made to take account of the physical environment as well as of the general social conditions the principal tribes which arc passed in revypv. In this way T have sought to mitigate the disadvantages incidental to the study of any institution viewed abstractedly and apart from the rest of the social organism with which it is vitally connected. Such abstract views are indeed indispensable, being imposed by the limitations of the human mind, but they are apt to throw the object out of focus, to exaggerate some of its features and to diminish unduly others which may be of equal or even greater importance. These dangers cannot be wholly avoided, but they may be lessened by making our study as concrete as is compatible Vtth die necessary degree of abstraction. This accordingly [ have attempted to do in writing the Survey. My account of the facts would be very much more im¬ perfect than it is, had it not been for'the l iberal assistance * (* which I have received from experts, who have frecty im¬ parted to me of their knowledge, generously permitting me in many cases to make use of unpublished information.

John Roseoc, formerly of the Church Mis¬ sionary Society, for the great generosity witfi which lie has placed air the stortj of his unrivalled knowledge of Central * African tribes, especially of the Eagan da, unreservedly at jny disposal for the purposes of this work- If my account of Ccfltral African totem hm contains not a little that it new and instructive, it to him chiefly that 1 owe it. For America, I desire to return my grateful thanks to the authorities of the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Smithsonian Institution, the American Museum of Natural History at New York, and the Field Columbian Museum at Chicago, who have liberally supplied me with many valuable publications which have been of the greatest assistance to me in my work. Nor would I omit to mention my gallant correspondent, the late Captain J„ G. Bourke, of the United States Cavalry, who in the intervals of his arduous professional duties devoted much time to studying and describing with the pen the Indians whom he had fought witlt the sword. My primary subject is totcrnism, and I have treated of exogamy for the most part only so far as it occurs in con¬ junction with totemisrfl ; for the two institutions not only differ but overlap, each of them being sometimes found without the other. Tribes which are exogamous without being totem ic d* not properly fall within the scope of the book ; but I have\"noticed a few of them, such as the Todas in India and the Masai an Africa, either on the ground of ^heir association with totemic tribes or because their social system presents some features of special interest However, lit TOTEM ISM AND EXOGAMY * * I must request the reader to bear constantly in mind that * the? two instiqjLKms of totemism* aijd ext^jamy are- funda¬ mentally distinct in origin 3 nd nature, though they p *havc accidentally crossed and blended in m jny tribes. *^Thc dis¬ tinction was for the first time plated in a dear light by the epoch-making'researches of Spencer and Gillen in Central AifsTralia/whijfh proved that the exogamous class is a totally different sAial organisation from the ^otcmic dan and not, as we had previously inclined to suppose, a mere extension of iL Stilt more recently the siime sharp line between totem ism and exogamy has been detected by Dr. W. H. R. Rivers in the Banks* Islands, where the natives Itave pure totem ism and pure exogamy,* existing side by side, without the one institution exercising - the lea^E influence upon the other. That example should finally set at rest the doubt whether exogamy is or h not a necessary feature of true totemism. If the reader will only remember that the two things, though often conjoined* are really distinct and independent, he will escape many perplexities and much confusion of thought in tracing the history of their relations to each other En the following pages. Inseparably connected with exogamy is the ct unificatory system of relationship, and accordingly I have treated it as an IntegraE part of my subject. The discovexy of that remarkable system, which is now known to obtain through¬ out a large part of the human race, was the work of the great American ethnologist 1 * H. Morgan alone. In spite o£ its apparent complexity the system originated very simply. A community w*as bisected into two exogamous^ and intermarrying groups, and all the men and women were classified according to the generation ^nd the group to which they belonged. The principle of the classification was marriageability, not blood. The crucial question was not, Whom am I descended from? buti Whom may ^ marry? Each class no doubt included blood relations, but PREFACE JUKI * thEy were placed in it not on the ground^ of their con¬ sanguineous thcl* sodal relationship to *cach other* as, possible or impossible husbands and wives. When the custom of grbup marriage had been replaced by individual marriage, the classificator^- terms of relationship continued^ in use, bjjt as the old group rights fell into abeyance the * terms which once expressed them came mpvc and %ore tB designate* ties of blood and affinity in our sense of the jvords. Hence in most races of thcjvorld the classificatory system of* relationship now survives only as a social fossil * testifying to a former condition of exogam)' and group marriage which has long passed away. ■ Having completed the survey of totem ism, Exogamy, and the Vindicatory system of relationship 1 have en¬ deavoured in the last volume to mark the place which the institutions occupy in the history of society, to discuss some theories of their origin, and to state those which I believe to be true or probable. That my conclusions on these difficult questions are final, 1 am not so foolish as to pre¬ tend. 1 have changed my views repeatedly* and t am resolved to change them again with every' change of the evidence, for like a chameleon the candid enquirer should shift his colours with the shifting colours of the ground he treads. Ml t can say is that the conclusions here formu¬ lated are those which I have at present reached after a careful consideration of ail the facts known to me. I have not discussed the vexed question of totem ism in classical .and Oriental antiquity? With the evidence at our disposal the problem hardly admits of a definite solution, and in any case an adequate discussion of it would require a treatise to itself. In estimating the part played by totem Ism in history I have throughout essayed, wherever the occasion offered, to Reduce within reasonable limits the extravagant pretensions which have sometimes been put forward on behalf of the sjv TQTEMISM AND EXOGAMY * * * institution, as^fit had been a factor of primary importance • 'in the rc]jgfoi^*and economic development ^>f \"mankind, £$ a matter of fact the influence which it is supposed tffhav* exercised on economic progress appears to be Hjllc more Jihan a shadowy conjecture ; *an( though its influence on religion has b An rea] p it has been greatly exaggerated. By comparison wiih some other factors, such as the worship of^ r nature and the worship of the dead* the importance mf totem ism in religious evolution is altogether subordinate Its main interest for us lies in the glimpse which*it affords into the working oT the childlike mind of the savage ; it is ** as it were a window opened up into a distant past Exojfhmy is also a product of savagery* but it* has few or none of the quaint superstitions which ^end ;t certain picturesque charm to Eotcmbm. It is, so to say, a stern Puritanical institution. In its rigid logic, its complex rules, its elaborate terminology* its labyrinthine systems of relationship, it presents an aspect somewhat hard and repdlant, a formality almost mathematical in its precision, which the most consummate literary art could hardly mollify or embellish. Yet its interest for the student of history is much deeper than that of its gayer and more frivolous sister. For whereas totem ism, if it ever existed among the ancestors of the civilised races, has vanished without leaving a trace among their descendants* exogamy has bequeathed to civilisation the momentous legacy of the prohibited degrees of marriage. * However the two institutions iff ay have survived into higher planes of culture, both of them have their roots in savagery, and the intrinsic interest of their study is enhanced by the circumstances of the age in wbiA we live. Our contemporaries of this and the rising generation appear to be hardly aware that we are witnessing the last act of a long drama, a tragedy and a ^omedy in one, which b facing silently played, with no fanfare of trumpets or roll of drums. 1 * - # * PREFACE * f t bdbre our eyes on the stage of history* V\\ h^tever becomes df the savage^ the curing must soon desertfd on savagery for e**r r Of lafe the pace of ^civilisation has so quickened, its expansion has become so beyond example rapid, that many savage races, who ogly^t hundred years ago 'tilt led * their old life unknown and undisturbed In* tfic # depth of* .f virgin forests or in remote islands of the sea, are flow being rudely hustled out of existence or transformed into a pathetic burlestfue of their conquerors. With their disappearance or Transformation an element of quamtfiess, of piciuresqucness, w of variety will be gone from the world. Society will probably be happier on the whole, but it will be soberer in tone* greyer a fid more uniform in colouring. And as savagery recedes farther and further into the past, it will become more and more an object of curiosity and wonder to generations parted from it by an impassable and ever-widening gulf of time. Its darker side will be forgotten, its brighter side will be remembered Its cruelties, its hardships, its miseries will be slurred Over ; memory will dwell with delight on what¬ ever was good and beautiful, or may seem to have been good and beautiful, in the long-vanished life of the wilderne**- Time t the magician, will cast his unfailing spell over these remote ages. An atmosphere of romance will gather round them, like the blue haze which softens into tender beauty the harsher features of a distant landscape* So the patri¬ archal age is invested for us with a perennial charm in the enchanting narratives of Genesis and the Odyssey, narrative* which breathe the freshness of a summer morning an£ 'glister as with dewdrops in the first beams of the rising sun of history. ft is thus th*t by some strange witchery, some freak of the fairy imagination^ who plays us so many tricks, man perpetually conjures up for himself the mirage of a Golden Age in the far past or the Tar future, dreaming of a bliss fhat never was and may never £e fc So far as the past is » * kvi TQTEM1SM AND EXOGAMY m • concerned, it 15 the sad duty of anthropology to break tljat dr^im, to disfn^ that mirage, to^paint savagery in its tnje colours, I have attempted t# do so* in th& book, J**have extenuated nothing, I have softened nothing, and t I hope I have exaggerated nothing/ A* a*plai if record of 3 curious 'Fornf of which must soon be numbered with the past, the ♦look *may continue to possess an interest efen when, with the progress *f knowledge, its errors shall have been corrected and *its theories perhaps superseded by “Others which make a nearer ajfproach to truth.

Peter Jones, himself an Ojibway ; a dedam by Warren 3 and (as an alternative pronunciation to totem) by Morgan ;* and edodnm by Francis Assikinaek, an Ottawa Indian. 5 According to the abbe Thavcnet 4 the word is properly ofi, in the sense of “family or tribe/' possessive oteM* and with the personal pronoun mnd ottm H my tribe/ 1 kit cUm u thy tribe.\" In English the- spelling toUrn (Keatings James, Schoolcraft/ etc.) has become established by custom.

Other kinds - of totems exist and will be noticed, but they may perhaps he regaglcd as varieties of the clan totem. The litter ts by far the most important of all; and where wo speak of totems or totemism without qualification, tie reference is always to the clan totem, ■fVcirui TJu* Cfon Tofettti —The clan totem is reverenced by a body of men and women who call themselves by the name of the totem, believe themselves to be of one blood, de¬ scendants of a common ancestor, and are bound together by common obligations to each other and by a common Tu^m ^l faith in the totem. Totemism is thus both a religious and isgiousaiid a Social system. In its religious aspect it consists of the “ ^ relations of mutual respect and protection between a man and his totem ; in its social aspect it consists of the relations of the clansmen to each other and to men of cither clans. In the later history of totemism those two sides, the religious and the social, tend to part company 1 the social system sometimes survives the religious ; and, on the other hand, religion sometimes bears traces of totemism in countries where the social system based on totemism has disappeared. How in the origin of totemism these two sides were related to each other it is, in our ignorance of that^ origin, impossible to say with certainty. Hut on the whole the evidence points strongly to the conclusion that the two sides were originally inseparable ; that, in other words, the farther we go back, the more we should find that the clansman regards himself and his totem as beings of the same species, and the less he distinguishes between conduct towards his totem and towards I TOTEM!SM his fellow-clansmen. For the sake gf cxpgritlon, however, U IS convenient *o separate the two.

Once a party of Choctaws smoked them out, and, treating them kindly, taught them th\" Choctaw- language, taught them to walk on two legs, made them cut off their toe nails and pluck the hair from their bodies, after which they adopted them into i - the tribe. But the rest of their kindred, the crayfish are , stl11 lm ' n B underground. 1 The Carp dan of the Outaoualrs are descended from the eggs of a carp which had been deposited by the fish on the banks of a stream and warmed- by the sun.* The Ojibw-ays are descended from a dog. 4 The Crane clan of the O jib ways are descended from a pair of cranes, wuhieh after tong wanderings settled on the rapids at the outlet of Lake Superior, where they were transformed by the great spirit into a man and woman,* The Black Shoulder clan (a Buffalo elan) of the Omahas were originally buffaloes and dwelt under the surface of the water, 7 The Osages are descended fr*n a male snail and a female heaved The snail burst his shell, developed arms, feet, and legs, and 1 Timothy Dwight, Trnvth hi N*w Entfamd <md X/w Frfr* (London, 1 &<rmd Amwaf Effort #f tkt $ a ' r ‘ IM ■ t iVW:.. „ ' Wtohif^n.,ffl, isaj t P . 77 , * Tlmothv Dli-hrrlif 7 jw,J\\, r 1 .. tAt t itiifffffttt Xtifik jr. dviil; Bucnft t Xk/rpt &/ tht Pj.ific Sfa i, i i8w Scj with iFie Kiflkpnun, L*tl p A&uhi and in AVj«m*/ + p p 404 I. 6 TOTEJffSM r t p Mktm became a firfe*iall man; afterwards he married the beaver oTpcopi^ maW** The clans of the Jowas fire descended Fropi ihe from iheii animals from ivhith they take their names, namely* eagle, pigeon^ woEf, hear, elk, beaver, buffjiJo, and snake/ The Moqub say that long ago thfi Great Mother brought from r thcT west*nine dans in the form of deer, sand, water, hears, hares, tobacco-plants, and reed-grass.
