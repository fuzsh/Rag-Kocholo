        "text": "Ancient Egypt is commonly regarded, in a simple comparative analysis, as a civilization less violent than its counterparts in neighboring Mesopotamia, for example. Some traces of violence can, obviously, be detected in many behaviors of the ancient Egyptian society, namely the physical punishments to the less committed students and to the peasants who evaded or intended to evade the intricate system of pharaonic tax collection. We can also confirm the practice of violence (verbal, physical and sexual) on women. Violence was therefore practiced in ancient Egypt, both in the domestic and public sphere, even though the Egyptian moral ethics condemn it, including the kind that one that could play on their own servants and/ or subordinates: “I have not caused pain”; “I have not slighted a servant to his master” (Book of the Dead, Chapter 125, Negative Confession). On the other hand, scenes of domination and repression of the defeated enemies were a common theme, often depicted at a large scale on the temples’ pylons, according to the ideology of the winner that each and every pharaoh should be and proclaim, even if just in theory. The ritual scenes of offering of the enemies by the Pharaoh to the main gods of the Egyptian pantheon are, in this sense, an eloquent trait of what we might designate as “ritual violence”, that was greatly appreciated in the country of the Pharaohs. With this paper, we will try to present and characterize the practice of violence in ancient Egypt exactly through some of its real or deliberate expressions and ritual or ceremonial, as a phenomenon with forms and techniques culturally and socially integrated. Finally, we will discuss a type of violence that underlies many of the Egyptian iconographic and textual productions, especially those related to life expectancy in the hereafter: we mean the threat of violence and constraints faced by the ones who do not align their existence by maetic behaviors that, in many situations, acts as a powerful deterrent and regulatory force to the living Egyptians. Inherent to our questioning of the phenomenon of violence in ancient Egypt in its various forms is a concept and generic definition of violence that is not limited to the physical and material aspect, that is, to the level of physical integrity, but also to the level of moral or psychological coercion, that violates individual autonomy and the existential behaviors.\n\nViolence and Gender in Ancient Egypt comprehensively explores the complex intersections of violence and gender in ancient Egypt. This book builds on current discussions in philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, and draws from analysis of relevant historic texts, iconography, and archaeological remains by looking at possible gender patterns behind evidence of trauma. It also bridges the gap between modern understandings of gendered violence and its functioning in ancient Egypt. Areas explored include: the differences in gendered aggression and violent acts between people and deities; sexual violence; taking of women as spoils of war; gendered dimensions of “bound prisoner” and “smiting of the enemy” motifs; the absence of violence against foreign women and children in texts and iconography; and the effeminization of enemy men in war as presented in text and iconography. It is argued that gendered violence was part of everyday lives of ancient Egyptians but that it was rarely depicted. When gendered violence was represented, this was done according to strict social rules which served to construct normative masculinity.\n\nAccording to the evidence at hand, it appears that during the period spanning from the Old Kingdom through the Libyan Era, institutionally sanctioned ritual violence centered around two main ideas: interference with cultic practices (temple and funerary), and rebellion (both the uprising of conquered enemies rebelling against Egypt's hegemony and the rebellion of actual Egyptians). It seems that while there were many crimes that the ancient Egyptians felt merited capital punishment, and many ways such punishment could be inflicted, most did not include a ritual element. However, it is clear that there were many executions that did include a ritual element, and in many cases it is likely that information conveying a ritual context is unavailable. For now, it can only be concluded that some executions were ritualized and others probably were not. Evidence regarding the forms of punishment that received ritual trappings remains inconclusive.\n\nViolence is a common motif that appears throughout the well-studied narrative and historical texts and images from the region of the ancient Near East and its neighbors, from Prehistory to Late Antiquity. Although depicted in both divine and human realms (e.g. Enuma Elish, Stele of Vultures, Chronicles, Battle of Qadesh, Baʿlu Cycle, Torah, Josephus), violence, whether physical or psychological (e.g. interpersonal, corporate, or structural), has been insufficiently studied from the perspectives of intention, motivation and legacy. During this three-year session, we will investigate the topic of violence through different methodological frameworks: (1) in 2017, the anthropology and hermeneutics of text and image analysis, (2) in 2018, the intentions (voluntary or not) and motivations of the authors in their use of violence as part of the narrative arc, and (3) in 2019, the philosophy of a contextualized violence (its social, moral and political questions) based on the understanding of text as well as image. We welcome abstracts from art historians, philologists, historians, anthropologists, and scholars interested in extending their analysis of violence beyond the bounds of traditional text-oriented approaches and determinism. We envision an interdisciplinary session attracting papers from Prehistorians, Assyriologists, Bible scholars, Hittitologists, Egyptologists, Aegeanists, and Byzantinists alike."
