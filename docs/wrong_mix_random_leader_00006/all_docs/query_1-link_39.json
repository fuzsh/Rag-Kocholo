        "text": "NOW IN PAPERBACK! In this book I explore the ancient history and modern historiography of relations between Egypt and Greece from the fifth century BCE to the early Roman empire. Beginning with Herodotus, I analyze key encounters between Greeks and Egyptian priests, the bearers of Egypt’s ancient traditions. A series of four moments emerge as rich micro-histories of cross-cultural interaction: Herodotus’ interviews with priests at Thebes, Manetho’s composition of an Egyptian history in Greek, the struggles of Egyptian priests on Delos, and a Greek physician’s quest for magic in Egypt. In writing these histories, I move beyond Orientalizing representations of the Other and colonial metanarratives of the civilizing process to reveal interactions between Greeks and Egyptians as transactional processes in which the traditions, discourses and pragmatic interests of both sides shaped the outcome. The result is a dialogical history of cultural and intellectual exchanges between the civilizations of Greece and Egypt.\n\nPathyris is a small Egyptian town in the southern Thebaid, farthest away from the Ptolemaic court and the centre of government. The abundant bilingual documentation from this town allows us to keep close track of the relatively late hellenization process, which rose to a high under the reigns of Ptolemy VI and VIII. But the biculturalism in this provincial town appears to be fragile, as the inhabitants were able to switch over easily to their old, Egyptian traditions when governmental control was weak. This article wants to examine why the biculturalism was successful and fragile at the same time.\n\nThis paper scrutinizes the characterization of ancient Egyptian society as multicultural and the related use of the concept and terminology of multiculturalism in research and public communications on ancient Egyptian society. An initial outline of the concept of multiculturalism sets the stage for a review of its application in specialist literature. It may seem sensible to ascribe multiculturalism or a multicultural reality to Egypt, given its history of migrations. It becomes apparent that a comprehensive theorization of multiculturalism is yet to occur with respect to ancient Egypt. This affects scholarly assessments and perceptions of historical transborder mobility and social integration."
