But, with no end to social distancing in sight or financial support from government yet agreed, the future for concerts and festivals and the hundreds of thousands of people who work in them looks bleak. Until these businesses can operate again, which is likely to be 2021 at the earliest, government support will be crucial to prevent mass insolvencies and the end of this world-leading industry.”\n\nhttps\n\n://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/02/finale-risk-rolling-stones-lennox-and-mccartney-among-stars-seeking-music-aid\n\nFinale risk: Rolling Stones, Lennox and McCartney among stars seeking music aid | Music industry | The Guardian\n\nFinale risk: Rolling Stones, Lennox and McCartney among stars seeking music aid | Music industry | The Guardian\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com\n\nMore Daily Elvis!\n\nGive us This Day, Our Daily Elvis for\n\nJuly\n\nPrevious Day’s Daily Elvis\n\nDaily Elvis: June 30\n\nNext Day’s Daily Elvis\n\nDaily Elvis: July 2\n\nReference Sites:\n\nhttp://www.elvisnews.com\n\nhttp://www.scottymoore.net/tourdates50s.html\n\nhttp://www.elvis-in-concert.com/\n\nhttp://www.elvisconcerts.com\n\nhttp:www.keithflynn.com/recording-sessions/\n\nhttp://www.elvisrecordings.com/ Master and Sessions\n\nThe Elvis Presley Record Research Database\n\nElvis Presley | full Official Chart History | Official Charts Company\n\nhttp://www.elvisinfonet.com/\n\nhttp://www.elvis.com.au/\n\nElvis History Blog\n\nDaily Elvis: June 21\n\nGive us this day, June 21, our daily Elvis\n\n1868\n\nWagner’s opera “Meistersinger von Nuernberg” premieres in Munich\n\nTupelo, Mississippi\n\n1935-1948\n\n1935-1940\n\n306 Old Satillo Road, Elvis’ birthplace, is now 306 Elvis Presley Drive.\n\n, 1938\n\nVernon Presley in prison ( May 25 1938 to February 6 1939)\n\n,1939\n\n1940-41\n\nReese Street, where the Presleys stayed with Vester and Clettes Presley and their daughter Patsy,\n\n1941\n\nWayne King and his orchestra recorded “Time Was” with Buddy Clark.\n\n1942\n\nKelly Street, a rented, small apartment.\n\n1943\n\nThe Presley family moved to the Mississippi Gulf Coast, May 15 to June 20, Returning to Tupelo.\n\n1944\n\nAugust 8, 1945 to July 18, 1946\n\nBerry Street -“Doll” Smith lived here with the Presleys and then Minnie Mae Presley moved in.\n\n1946\n\nCommerce Street, a rental\n\n510 1/2 Maple Street, South Tupelo -the Presleys lived with Glady’s cousin Frank Richards and his wife, Leona.\n\n1947\n\nMulbery Alley\n\n1948\n\nColumbia Records launched a new vinyl disc that played at thirty-three and one third RPM in New York City, sparking a music-industry standard so strong that the digital age has yet to kill it.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee\n\n1948-1953 – Humes High School\n\nSept. 12, 1948-Sept. 20, 1949\n\n572 Poplar Avenue\n\nSept 20 1949 to January 7, 1950\n\n185 Winchester Street, a two- bedroom apartment (number 328)\n\nJanuary 7, 1950 to April 1953\n\n398 Cypress Street\n\nJune 21, 1951\n\n“17” opens at Broadhurst Theater NYC for 180 performances\n\nJune 3, 1951 to July 1, 1951\n\nElvis was employed as a machinist by “Precision Tool Co.”\n\nApril 17, 1952 to May 28, 1952\n\nElvis worked as an user at Loew’s State Theatre\n\n1952\n\nFats Domino‘s “Goin’ Home” became his first #1 hit.\n\n1953\n\n398 Cypress Street (rented from January 7 to April 1953\n\n, 1954\n\nElvis worked at Precision Tool company, operating a drill press for $1.55 a hour from September 21, 1953 to March 19, 1954\n\nElvis worked at Crown Electric, until mid-October 1954\n\nThe Presleys lived at 2414 Lamar Avenue, rented til the end of 1954 to mid-1955\n\nThe Sun Records Rockabilly Era\n\nJune 21, 1955\n\nJohnny Cash released his first Sun Records single, “Cry!
