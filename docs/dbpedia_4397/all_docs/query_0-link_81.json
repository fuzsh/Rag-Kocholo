He enjoyed collecting their bumper stickers and watching the DJs through a big plate glass window. His mother recognized his passion for entertainment, so she bought him a Mr. Microphone that allowed him to live out the dream of being a radio DJ. His first gig was in 1996 at WJMX-FM in Florence, SC., where he worked his way up from weekend warrior to afternoons and finally mornings. During his tenure there, he served as program director, music director and promotions director. He was also involved with other stations including, WDAR-FM, WEGX-FM, WJMX-AM, WSQN-FM, WFLZ-FM, and WPFM-AM. Working in radio for almost 12 years gave him the tools and knowledge necessary to branch off as a wedding/event DJ, worldwide voiceover artist and freelance video journalist for the Travel Channel. After eight years working with Howard Rosen Promotion on the programming side, Scotty decided he wanted to try radio promotion, and in 2009 he joined the HRP team from Florence, SC where he currently resides."
