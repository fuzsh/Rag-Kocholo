        "text": "Information and Communication Technology application in university libraries poses several issues to be addressed, including those related to the management of human resources. As part of a study on the technology management of university libraries in Kerala, the aspect of human resources was also evaluated. A radical re-design in the prevailing system of management is advocated by the study. As a key component in the proper application of modern technologies in university libraries, human resources play a vital role in the effectiveness of digital information services. It was also found that the principles of business process re-engineering can be applied effectively to re-define the human resource management system for adapting to the changed circumstances. The necessity of developing human resources in different cadres and also with stress on modern digital technologies is established. The paper provides a detailed account of the study and findings and also identified the thrust ...\n\nIntroduction University libraries can play a very important role in the higher education sector. In fact a few university libraries in India are playing an excellent job of producing knowledgeable citizens. But with the advancement in information and communication technology university libraries in India have faced with a number of challenges. In Kerala, University libraries have an important academic role in the teaching, research, and service that universities undertake. These libraries are facing serious competition from commercial information services providers which essentially use the resources available from libraries and analyze and repackage the same for customized use by the clients and online resources are emerging in a big way that will question the role and form of university libraries in future. The SWOT analysis provides an objective assessment as to whether the library is able to deal with the environment. Strength is a resource or capability an organization possesse...\n\nThe library environment is currently undergoing a rapid and dynamic revolution leading to new generation of libraries with the emphasis one-resources. In this era of information explosion E-resources are inevitable to support education, research and development of universities. So many of the libraries in India especially university libraries have started providing access to more and more e-resources for supporting educational and research programs. The universities in Kerala also adapted to these new ICT developments and increased the access to e-resources. This study helps to find out the electronic resources and the pattern of organization of electronic sources in the universities in Kerala. The present study point out that even though the library consortium provides a wide range of e-resources in different subjects, university libraries in Kerala due to the limitations of library consortiums are forced to subscribe online databases of E-journals, E-books and Electronic Thesis and Dissertations directly.\n\nThe book titled “Paradigm Shift in Libraries” is published as an E-book under Creative Common License so that anybody can access, read, share and download the book from anywhere free of cost. The Book consists of articles reflecting the modern views of libraries and librarians. There is a drastic change in all aspects of the library from the traditional libraries to the modern libraries. An inevitable shift from the traditional functions and services has become necessary today. The book includes ten papers dealing with various topics such as shift of the role of librarians to cybrarians, newly garbed libraries, user approach to the services of a library, proposal for a union catalogue of libraries of institutions in higher education, study on N-LIST, need for developing information literacy skills in e-learning environment, personal learning network for professional development, selection and management of Linux operating systems in libraries, the role of face book pages in libraries, and Scientometric study of open access psychology journals.\n\nOne of the important reasons for the under utilization of electronic information is the lack of requisite level of working knowledge and consumption skills among customers and information intermediaries. So, the conventional user education programmes need be redefined and reengineered with more emphasis on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). It should be designed in such a way to provide confidence to the users in locating desired information. There are 38 Agricultural Universities functioning in India and they are formed by special Acts and Statutes, either of the Government of India or of different State Governments. The Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) is the only one such university in the State of Kerala. It has 10 constituent colleges, six Regional Agricultural Research Stations, 26 Research Stations, three Centres of Advanced Studies, 10 Instructional Farms and six specific Centres of Research and Studies. The KAU Library and Information System (KAULIS) has ...\n\nThe study discusses about the Audio Visual Services provided by the agricultural science university libraries in South India. User opinion is collected and presented in different tables and the study found that 48% of PG Students, 56% of Research Scholars and 49% of Faculty Members are of the opinion that the audio visuals materials are available in their respective libraries. Further 43% of PG students, 50% of Research Scholars and 44% of Faculty Members said that they are availing the AV services in their respective libraries. 39% of PG Students, 41% of Research Scholars and 41% of Faculty Members are expressed that they have used the micro film readers; finally 26% of PG Students, 40% of Research Scholars and 37% of Faculty Members are satisfied over all the audio visual services. This shows that majority of the users are not satisfied as per as audiovisual services are concern."
