        "text": "Several weeks ago, WSSR (95.7 FM, \"Star\") switched to urban-formatted (hip-hop, R&B) \"The Beat,\" spinning 10,000 songs in a row before it will introduce new DJs.\n\nRadio Babe learned that WFLZ's (93.3 FM) Jomama Johnson will move his \"Quiet Storm\" program over to the sister station. He's currently on 9 p.m. to midnight Sundays, 8-11 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays on WFLZ, but no Beat schedule for the \"Jomama Radio Network\" has been announced.\n\nNor has any information turned up about other Beat talkers, yet. Stay tuned .\n\nAs for WSSR's former jocks, Kristy Knight moved to Clear Channel cousin WMTX (100.7 FM, \"Mix\"), from 3-7 p.m. weekdays, where she'll spin essentially the same music Star played.\n\nPLAYING CATCH-UP -- Also, dear readers, the usual program shufflings continue.\n\nThe audacious Bubba the Love Sponge morning program, originating from Tampa's WXTB (97.9 FM) expands to another outlet -- Fort Myers' WRQC (92.5 FM, \"Real Rock 92.5\"), its sixth station in syndication, not including XM Satellite Radio's Channel 152.\n\nWRQC's revamped weekday lineup is: BTLS 6-10 a.m., Fritz 10 a.m.-2 p.m., The Bob Narley Show 2-6 p.m. and Tim Savage from 6-10 p.m.\n\nSKYWARD BOUND -- The aforementioned XM Satellite Radio passed the 1 million subscriber mark Oct. 27, according to the company, less than two years since its inception.\n\nXM president/CEO Hugh Panero said the company is \"the satellite radio leader and one of the fastest growing entertainment media in history.\"\n\nOf course one usually says nice things about one's own company. However he pointed out the interesting fact that XM's million mark took only one year and 11 months, surpassed by only one other medium in recent history -- the DVD player (selling 1 million in one year and nine months).\n\nCompact disc and mp3 players sold a million in two years, four months; radio, three years, three months; TV, three years, four months.\n\nAbout four and a half years passed until 1 million digital video recorders sold; VCRs, almost five years; and cable and satellite TV didn't catch on for nearly 12 years each, according to XM's research.\n\nHOLIDAY TIME -- The fact that certain large commercial (and musical) holidays are upon us is inescapable, especially now that some radio stations will begin non-stop Christmas music.\n\nStarting at midnight Friday, Beasley Broadcasting's WJPT (106.3 FM) in Fort Myers, normally adult standards, begins \"All Xmas\" (reported in ALLACCESS) through Dec. 25.\n\nAlso, Sarasota's Christian WSMR 89.1 FM (\"Life FM\") claims it's giving an early \"gift\" with 100 percent Christmas music beginning Friday \"for your shopping weekend.\" (Because the holiday is about buying, right?)\n\nR.B. would rather listen to static, proclaiming \"Bah, Humbug!\" No Scrooge, she prefers celebrating her holiday joy on the actual day, rather than hearing already-over-played carols over-played for another whole month.\n\nOne more thing, WSMR also extended its \"Java Drive with Lee Miller & Douglas Poll,\" 6 a.m. weekdays, adding an 89-minute \"music sweep\" from 9-10:30 a.m.\n\nE-RADIO WEEKLY -- So much for those Web links R.B. provided the past two weeks.\n\nThe U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia may further silence terrestrial radio stations' streaming content with an Oct. 20 ruling that said stations must pay copyright fees to record companies and performers over and above what's already paid for the licensed material.\n\nMany stations discontinued streaming when this same argument arose over advertising aired via Internet streams.\n\nListening to far off (or nearby) real-world stations could end simply because this modern media (computers) -- which has all but replaced radios on desk tops -- differs from the old broadcasting method (radios), and the content creators feel they deserve additional compensation.\n\nWasn't modern technology supposed to simplify things and create unlimited options?\n\nTHRILLING P.S. -- Rush Limbaugh returned to his daily radio program, fresh from rehab. Saying \"it's one of the biggest thrills of my life\" to be back, one can only wish, one day at a time, that the thrill remains.\n\nTune in next week for Radio Babe's usual letters and answers.\n\nDirect queries and comments to Radio Babe c/o the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, P.O. Drawer 1719, Sarasota 34230, or e-mail dawnzig@hotmail.com. Answers will appear in this forum only. Radio station listings appear in the Herald-Tribune's Sunday Click TVGuide publication."
