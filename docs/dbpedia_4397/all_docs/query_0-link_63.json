        "text": "The more things change, the more they come back to haunt you. Consider that, through most of the 1980s, there was this powerhouse of a radio station in Tampa Bay, Q105, which was without peer in the ratings game.\n\nQ105 was packed with high-powered air personalties; among them: Morning Zookeepers Cleveland Wheeler and Scott Shannon and afternoon drive guy Mason Dixon.\n\nWelcome to the reunion of the class of the '80s: Wheeler now hosts mornings on oldies radio U92 (WYUU-FM 92.5); Dixon, after reigning over mornings at Mix 96, is the KISS-FM (WUSA-FM 100.7) wakeup man, and Shannon, now via satellite from New York's WPLJ, has the morning slot at Mix 96 (WMTX-FM 95.7).\n\nIn the meantime, Q105 dropped from its pedestal, switched from pop to country and is now the second-rated country station in what used to be a one-horse radio town.\n\nMornin'!\n\nThe emergence of a new sports radio station on WMTX-AM 1040, now called the Score, is another example of all-sports being an turn-key format of choice, especially for AM stations trying to reinvent their long-lost identities.\n\nIn 1991, the former oldies WHBO-AM 1040 became a Mix 96 simulcast and since barely registered in the Arbitron ratings.\n\nSo far, no plans have surfaced involving any local programing for the Score, but ...\n\n\"We have a bunch of local programing planned,\" Mix 96/the Score program director Chuck Morgan said. \"We are very close on two very strong personalities (with local identities).\"\n\nThe field of pickin' has only slightly narrowed recently; the Team recently signed Scot Brantley, refugee from the ruins of the WSUN/WFNS collapse; Todd Wright remains a free agent, while Steve Duemig (WFLA) and Paul Porter (WBDN) have found at least temporary, limited active duty. Perhaps local TV personalities, a la Ch. 13's Colin Cowherd on the Team, could figure in the new mix.\n\nIn the meantime, the Score people need simply to plug in to a certain satellite feed and, voila, they're all-sports. The centerpiece of current programing is Jim Rome, syndicated from noon to 3 p.m. from XTRA in San Diego. SportsFan Radio Network from Las Vegas provides the rest of the blabber for now, or whenever.\n\nMorgan noted that, unlike the Team (WZTM-AM 820), the Score runs \"the drill,\" its label for sports news updates every 20 minutes starting at the top of each hour. 820's \"team ticker\" clicks in at the top and bottom of each hour.\n\nHow all this affects Jacor's possible plans for reprograming WDAE-AM 1250 into all-sports is too early to call. Insiders propose that Jacor, which owns WFLA, WFLZ, WDUV, WXTB and WTBT and soon will own WDAE and WUSA, is considering a sports format and may have been taken aback when the Score signed on. Jacor recently received final Federal Trade Commission clearance to obtain WDAE and KISS; actual ownership should be final within a month or so.\n\nThree all-sports stations in a market with two, soon three, pro franchises may seem like overkill. In fact, for the dearly departed WSUN and WFNS, it became suicide.\n\nReports from Radio & Records indicate Bubba the Love Sponge's \"retirement\" was indeed another in a long string of Bubba's \"Please Say You'll Miss Me When I'm Gone\" hoaxes. The now-ex WFLZ-FM 93.3 night jock is said to be resurfacing within a month locally on 98 Rock (WXTB-FM 97.9) to do mornings. 98 Rock, like WFLZ, is owned by Jacor. Think this one's been in the works a while?"
