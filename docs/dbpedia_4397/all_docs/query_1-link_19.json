It is owned and operated by Davis Media, LLC. WXTG-FM airs an urban contemporary radio format. The transmitter for WXTG-FM is off Elbow Road in Chesapeake, Virginia. Studios and offices are on Little Neck Road in Virginia Beach. WXTG-FM signed on in August 2001 as WANN. It later became Mainstream Urban as \"Hot 102.1\" under the WWHV call letters. WWHV's then owner, On Top Communications, went into bankruptcy in 2005. WWHV was bought by Red Zebra Broadcasting in 2007. The company had already owned WXTG, and began simulcasting the two stations beginning January 29, 2007. On the air, the stations usually only used the FM's dial position, except once per hour for the formal station identification. Under Red Zebra, WXTG-AM-FM aired a sports radio format. \"102.1 The Game\" carried most of the Fox Sports Radio lineup as well as all games of the Washington Redskins (like Red Zebra, owned by Daniel Snyder). The station had one local weekday show, The 757 Club, which is named for the region's area code. The hosts were John \"Johnny D\" Decandido and Bartley \"Pretty Boy\" Barefoot. Decandido was a former host on Fox Sports Radio, and Barefoot is a graduate of Old Dominion University. On July 30, 2013, Red Zebra sold WXTG-AM-FM to Williamsburg-based Davis Media, LLC for $1.2 million. The sale was consummated on April 7, 2014. Davis Media, LLC, also owns WTYD in Deltaville, Virginia and WBQK in West Point, Virginia. On August 1, 2013, WXTG-FM began simulcasting WTYD's adult album alternative (AAA) music format. On January 7, 2019, WXTG-AM-FM became a 24-hour news and business station, calling itself \"All News 102.\" The AAA format continued on co-owned WTYD. On June 5, 2020, WXTG-AM-FM dropped the \"All News 102\" news format and switched back to a simulcast of AAA-formatted WTYD. On July 15, 2020, WXTG-FM flipped to urban contemporary, branded as \"Streetz 87.7 & 102.1\" (simulcasting low power TV station WMTO-LP channel 6, which airs at 87.75 MHz).\n\nHDR-14 Screengrabs:\n\nWFOS\n\n88.7\n\n204B1\n\nFormat: Big Band/Nostalgia/Old Time Radio // WHRO/90.3-HD2 Norfolk // 88.7 WFOS Chesapeake\n\nOn-Air Positioning: The Time Machine Radio Network\n\nCommunity Of License: Chesapeake VA\n\nOwner: Hampton Roads Educational Telecommunications Association\n\nHD Radio™: Not Licensed\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service) WFOS\n\nRT (Radio Text - Positioner) WHRO-HD2\n\nRT (Radio Text) Title - Artist\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): 635A\n\nPTY (Program Type): 14 Jazz\n\nWebsite: schedule.whro.org/radio?station=WFOS\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nAudio Clips: Problems listening?

This station used to be on 90.3 before doing a deal with WHRO so they could get a second station. This is Virginia's first high school-run radio station - started in 1955. In 2015, Chesapeake Public Schools abruptly stopped offering a radio program to their students, citing advancements in technology and music accessability. In November 2020, WFOS attempting fundraising, posting on its Twitter account that it was aiming to become listener-funded. By fall, it had only raised 15% of a $40,000 goal. It wouldn't be enough to cover the station's lengthy list of needed repairs, totaling about $150,000 on top of the $200,000 a year it costs to run it. On January 27, 2021, Chesapeake Public Schools and the Hampton Roads Educational Telecommunications Authority, parent of WHRO-FM and WHRV-FM, reached a programming and services agreement to allow for the operations of the station to continue; two months later, HRETA filed to buy WFOS outright. WHRO Public Media (HRETA) took over ownership of the station on May 1, 2021, but was required to wait on final FCC approvals to fully operate WFOS. The FCC gave final approvals in June 2021. THe station is now dubbed the Time Machine Radio Network, and its broadcast reach expanded to all of Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Chesapeake. WFOS can still be heard at its old frequency, 88.7 FM, as well as at a new one, 99.3 FM. Additionally, listeners can pick it up at 90.3 HD2 or stream it online at whro.org/timemachine. WHRO announced that two popular WFOS personalities are returning to host their own shows. Larry Williams, known for Larry's Doo Wop and Larry's Beach Party, will play beach music, and Jerry Carter, known for his show Blues Traffic Jam, will play blues. WHRV host Paul Shrugrue, known for his program Out of the Box will take on the role of music coordinator for the station. Time Machine Radio Network seeks to transport listeners to their favorite moments in time through music. Listeners will find a mix of tunes from the 1920s through the '60s, including Doo Wap, Motown, Oldies, Blues, Beach Music and more-- all without commercials.\n\nWRVS-FM\n\n89.9\n\n210C2\n\nFormat: Urban/Variety\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 89-9 ECSU\n\nCommunity Of License: Elizabeth City NC\n\nOwner: Elizabeth City State University\n\nHD Radio™: Call/Station Name: WRVS-FM\n\nStation Slogan: HD Radio\n\nHD1 - Format: Urban/Variety\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 89-9 ECSU\n\nBit Rate: 48kbps HDC\n\nHD2 - Format: Jazz\n\nOn-Air Positioning: Jazzy 89.9-HD2\n\nBit Rate: 32kbps HDC\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Static) WRVS\n\nPS (Program Service - Dynamic) Title by Artist 89.9 WRVS\n\nRT (Radio Text - Legal ID Positioner) WRVS-FM/HD1 Elizabeth City, NC\n\nRT (Radio Text - Positioner #2) NC Promise Tuition Plan: www.ecsu.edu/ncpromise\n\nRT (Radio Text - Positioner #1) Promote Your Business Here!

WRVS is the ECSU's public full-service radio station, with studios located in Williams Hall. In 1996, there was a fire in Williams Hall on July 3rd that would knock the station off-the-air for three months. They were silent because of soot and smoke damage to equipment caused by the fire in Williams Hall. . October 3, 1996 three months to the day of the fire, they signed back on the air at 6:00 a.m. with the song \"Fire\" by the Ohio Players. This song (and two others) played over and over and over for the entire day. This promotional gimmick was to get the word out to our 35,000 listeners that they were back on the air. WRVS first operated on March 18, 1986, as 10,000 watts of \"Wonderful Radio Viking Style\" (90.7). The radio transmitter housing and a 280-foot radio tower were erected in January 1986. The station's power was increased to 41,000 watts in 1990, and its frequency changed to 89.9. Significant equipment upgrades occurred in December 1992, and in February 1994, a 3.8 meter single feed satellite dish was erected, adjacent to Williams Hall.\n\nWZLV*\n\n90.7\n\n214B\n\nFormat: Christian Adult Contemporary\n\nOn-Air Positioning: Positive & Encouraging, K-Love\n\nCommunity Of License: Cape Charles VA\n\nOwner: Educational Media Foundation\n\nHD Radio™: Not Licensed\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Dynamic) Variable Station Positioner\n\nPS (Program Service - Positioner) WZLV\n\nRT (Radio Text) Artist - Title - K-LOVE\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): 97DF\n\nPTY (Program Type): 7 Adult Hits**\n\nWebsite: klove.org\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nAudio Clips: Problems listening?

LMA with Educational Media Foundation's (EMF) Christian Contemporary \"K-LOVE\" on December 1, 2000.\n\nHere's the history behind K-LOVE... The idea for a full-time contemporary Christian music station was conceived in San Francisco in 1980 by a popular Bay Area radio personality, Bob Anthony. Anthony thought that traditional Christian radio was not reaching the average person. His vision was to create a new, all-music station, featuring artists like Amy Grant, The Imperials, and Keith Green – a revolutionary approach in its day. Professional announcers would present the Gospel through brief vignettes, without adopting the \"Christian-ese\" terms and phrases. After several tries at purchasing a station in San Francisco, a small, non-commercial radio station was acquired forty-five miles north of the Bay Area in Santa Rosa, CA. The bankrupt station sold for $67,000. The dream for Bob Anthony became a reality on October 15, 1982, when \"KCLB-FM, The Positive Alternative\" signed on the air for the first time. In 1986, Bob Anthony moved to Portland, Oregon to start a new radio ministry, and Dick Jenkins replaced Anthony as KCLB's Station Manager. On September 12, 1988, a 9,000-acre brush fire destroyed KCLB's main transmitter building on Geyser Peak and the owner of the transmitter site was terminating the land lease. Another mountain-top location confirmed that the radio station transmitter could be relocated to 4,000-ft. Mount Saint Helena. Signal reports as far away as 125 miles from the new site were received from listeners who couldn't hear the station previously. Also in 1988, KCLB changed its name to K-LOVE. With satellite broadcasting and digital technology, K-LOVE slowly became a network of radio stations and FM translators (low-power repeater stations). K-LOVE's programming was now being delivered throughout the Western US as K-LOVE first expanded to San Francisco, Berkeley, and San Rafael, in 1987; Salinas and Monterey in 1988; San Jose and Fremont in 1989; and Redding, Los Gatos, Gilroy, Hollister, and Santa Cruz in 1990. Fresno, Chico, Merced, Portland, Salem, Klamath Falls, San Diego, and Phoenix were added during the early 1990s.

Signed on in the Spring of 2002. AFA has over 100 full-power, translator and affiliate stations around the country, four in Virginia and WBKU from North Carolina, with most relaying \"American Family Radio\" WAFR/88.3 Tupelo MS.\n\nA little background info on AFR... In 1987, American Family Association President Don Wildmon wanted to use satellite and the latest technology at the time to build hundreds of American Family Radio stations across America. Wildmon wanted to use these radio stations to inform Christians about what is happening. Reading 'Broadcasting' magazine in 1987, Wildmon ran across an article stating that the Federal Communications Commission would allow non-commercial FM stations to deliver their signal to local communities via satellite. He realized the vast potential and relative economic costs of such a system, AFA filed for a station in their hometown of Tupelo MS. It took four years to get a CP (construction permit) the FCC to construct the station. It was necessary this station before a signal could be transmitted to satellite. The Mississippi Authority for Educational Television, the group which is responsible for state funded radio stations, tried to block AFA from getting the station. MATA didn't want to build a station themselves, they simply didn't want AFA to be able to build the station for which AFA had applied. Four years later in February 1991, AFA received permission to build their station - WAFR. The station went on the air in August of that year. In February 1993, the first translator station went on the air in Jackson TN. Gradually the number of stations began to grow. AFR has built more stations in a shorter time than any other broadcaster in the history of broadcasting. In 1995, AFA begin their news department. AFR's schedule contains about 70% music and 30% talk. Musically, AFR is light contemporary with a mixture of older songs.\n\nWHBT\n\n92.1\n\n221C3\n\nFormat: Urban Adult Contemporary\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 92.1 The Beat\n\nCommunity Of License: Moyock NC\n\nOwner: iHeartMedia\n\nHD Radio™: HD - Call/Station Name: BEAT\n\nHD - Station Slogan: 92.1 The Beat HD1\n\nTraffic Maps: Yes, Hampton Roads (no Eastern Shore)\n\nWeaher Maps: Yes, Hampton Roads (no Eastern Shore)\n\nHD1 - Format: Urban Adult Contemporary\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 92.1 The Beat\n\nBit Rate: 48kbps HDC\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Dynamic) 92.1 The Beat + Variable Station Positioner\n\nRT (Radio Text - Advertisement Positioner) 92.1 The Beat - Kalfus & Nachman 888-HURTLINE Accident Attorneys 92.1 The Beat\n\nRT (Radio Text - Positioner) 92.1 The Beat - Hampton Roads' Throwbacks and R&B\n\nRT (Radio Text - Music) 92.1 The Beat + Title / Artist\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement):No\n\nPI (Program Identification): 17E4\n\nPTY (Program Type): 16 Rhythm & Blues\n\nWebsite: thebeatva.iheart.com\n\nInternet Audio Stream: Analog/HD1: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nAudio Clips: Problems listening?

Dropped Classic Country \"Foggy Mountain\" on 92.1-HD2 during the summer of 2012 for Gospel \"Hallelujah 92.1 HD2.\"\n\nAt 3 p.m. on 3/31/2011, WKUS/Norfolk broke the simulcast with WKSA to go Rhythmic AC \"Movin 107.7.\" The WKUS previously had moved to Norfolk in early 2011 making the signal coverage of 92.1 and 107.7 similar to each other with a difference of just 17 miles.\n\nChanged call letters from WCDG to WKSA on 10/27/2010. On Monday, October 11, 2010, the then Clear Channel Norfolk shuffled the format on three of its four FM frequencies. Urban AC \"KISS FM\" was dropped on 105.3 for (Adult Contemporary leaning) Classic Hits \"Magic 105.3.\" The Urban AC format replaced 60s-80s Classic Hits \"Cool 92.1\" on WCDG and Smooth AC \"Smooth Jazz 107.7\" on WJCD as \"92.1 & 107.7 KISS FM.\"\n\nDropped Adult Standards \"Vegas Gold\" on 92.1-2 in favor of Country Variety \"Country Mix\" that was bumped from sister station 107.7-2 in early January 2007. Added HD Radio broadcasts in early 7/2006. Dropped the Soft AC \"Lite FM\" simulcast on 92.1/WCDG (with 107.7/WJCD) and flipped it to 60s-70s Oldies on 8/12/05 at 1:03 p.m. The first song was \"What Kind Of Fool Do You Think I Am\" by Bill Deal. \"Cool\" filled the void left when Max Media dumped the format in July 2005 for Classic Hits/AC \"92-9 The Wave.\" When Lite FM, Started to carry the John Tesh Show on 3/8/2004. Tesh's first affiliate to do so in the mornings. Flipped to Soft AC \"Lite FM\" on 3/1/2004 at midnight and returned to a simulcast with 107.7 Windsor. Took the calls WCDG on 3/9/2004. Was urban contemporary oldies \"The Vibe\" until February 1, 2001 when it flipped to hip-hop '92.1 The Beat' and took new WBHH calls. Also carried the Doug Banks Morning Show. Since it first signed on in the early 1970s as WJLY doing Top 40. This station has gone through many musical incarnations. For a while it was WQZQ with a country format and Top 40 as \"2Q92.\" In the early 80s it became WOFM with a bland pop format. By the late 80s it was called \"The Border,\" playing punk/alternative rock. WOFM rn an on-air campaign called 'More Power To The Tower'. They were seeking from the Virginia Beach City Council to build a new tower and to increase its power from 6kW to 25kW. The City said \"no.\" The station was losing money. Monday July 16, 1990 it switched to WTZR \"Z-Rock,\" with a mix of satellite and local programming in a heavy metal format. It saw its highest ratings after the flip...a 2.9...good for 11th place at the time. But it only lasted 11 months. After playing urban AC for awhile (the last song was Boyz II Men's 'It's Hard To Say Goodbye'), on August 9, 1996 they became WMYK (92.1 The Beat...ironic that's what they are again today) after 93.7 gave up those calls and played dance/CHR. That didn't last long and shifted to hip-hop 'without the noise' and went by K-92, then fired the staff in July of 1997 and became urban oldies WSVV.

Started Internet streaming on Friday 3/10/2006. Moved the WTYD call letters from 107.9 to 92.3 (previously WSRV) on 12/9/2005 in anticipation of the breaking of the simulcast, to a single frequency, with the Triple A formatted 107.9/West Point. Davis Media, whose only station at the time was Triple A \"107-9 The Tide\" WYTD West Point/Williamsburg, agreed to purchase Bullseye Broadcasting's 50s-70s Oldies \"Surf 92.3\" WSRV Deltaville/Gloucester in August 2005 for $850,000 and immediately started a LMA (local marketing agreement). Davis Media purchased WWBR/107.9 (now WTYD) from Jim Campana's Winner Broadcasting. Bullseye Broadcasting was another company of Jim's. Jim passed away October 2004. His widow Sherry Campana took over both companies and ends up selling both stations to Davis Media. The 92.3 frequency signed on January 5, 1999 with an oldies format from Westwood One. In May, 2003, they dropped Westwood One in favor of \"Local and Live\" programming; continuing to program \"Oldies\" from the late 50s thru early 70s. Late 2002, \"The One and Only Oldies Station\" slogan was dropped in favor of \"The Greatest Hits of All Time.\" They targeted a 35+ audience on the Mid-Peninsula, Newport News and Williamsburg with music, news, sports, traffic and William & Mary football and Basketball. When Hampton Roads lost their only Oldies station in January of 2001 (regained one in December 2001), this station got noticed, picked up some listeners and started to show up on Arbitron's \"radar screens.\" WSRV built new studios in the Spring of 2003 in historic Gloucester Court House at 6558 Main Street.\n\nWTWV-FM\n\n92.9\n\n225B\n\nFormat: 60s-80s Hits\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 92-9 The Wave\n\nCommunity Of License: Suffolk VA\n\nOwner: Max Media\n\nHD Radio™: Call/Station Name: WTWV\n\nStation Slogan: WTWV HD1\n\nStation Message: HD Radio...www.HD-Radio.com\n\nHD1 - Format: 60s-80s Hits\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 92-9 The Wave\n\nBit Rate: 96kbps HDC\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Static) 92.9 THE WAVE\n\nPS (Program Service - Dynamic) 92.9 THE WAVE Variable Station Positioner\n\nRT (Radio Text - Positioner) 92.9 The Wave The Best Mix of the 80's To Today\n\nRT (Radio Text) Artist - Title\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): 8925\n\nPTY (Program Type): 7 Adult Hits\n\nWebsite: 929thewave.com\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nAudio Clips: Problems listening?

Subsuquently, WVHT's callsign would be changed to WVBW.\n\nOn April 20, 2022, WVBW applied for the ability to experiment with IBOC HD Radio. This request was approved by the FCC on May 27.\n\nOn March 10, 2015, Max Media lawyers submitted a letter to the FCC claiming WVBW was operating at 70% power. On April 9, 2015, the FCC approved the application for reduced power. Verizon Wireless claimed that Max Media had been causing interference to their equipment at their co-shared transmitter site, with WVBW being granted the authority to operate at 70% power to locate the issue.

A sixth station in the Barnstable cluster (1050/WVXX) was sold separately. Dropped the moniker \"Oldies 92-9\" in favor of \"92-9 WFOG\" early 2004. Took back the calls WFOG (12/5/2003) when the Classic Country format on 100.5 shifted to AM and displaced the Standards format on 1050. Flipped to Oldies on December 16, 2001 with the Beatles belting out \"`A Hard Day's Night'' as the first song. Was urban oldies 'Soul Classics 92.9' from 9/10/1999 to 12/16/2001.

Became Kick FM just after 4PM on 12/3/03 to fill the \"hole\" left when Barnstable decided to jettison the longtime Country format on WCMS-FM for Mainstream Rock as \"100.5 MAX FM\" WXMM. They went head-to-head with Barnstable's Country \"97-3 The Eagle\" WGH. Kristen Croot, the last jock heard on \"The Coast,\" was audibly upset just before the switch around 4. Nobody had a chance to say their goodbyes. Landed the legendary Country Music DJ Hall of Famer Joe Hoppel the following day. Stopped stunting at 12:06PM on 12/5/03 and introduced its regular playlist. Used to simulcast on WEXM/106.1 Exmore before the 106.1 signal was moved to Poquoson. The transmitter is in North Carolina, but the city of license is Chesapeake. This stems from a case that apparently went all the way to the US Supreme Court in the early 90s having to do with Virginia Lottery advertising. Turned out that it was illegal in North Carolina, so a change in the city of license to a Virginia locality was requested and granted. The WMYK album rock format started about 1976. They took over the progressive rock mantle from WOWI, which went to urban contemporary music in the mid 70s. K-94 was a huge station here in the late 70s and early 80s. The kids basically stopped listening to WGH (Top 40) and K-94 was one big beneficiary. About 1982, the format was altered to \"Rock of the '80s,\" and about 1984 or 1985 it was switched to urban contemporary music. In the late 80s, they were known as Power 94, going head-to-head with 'Hot 103' (now 103 Jamz) WOWI. Later they segued to urban AC. At 3PM on June 21, 1991, the calls were switched to WKOC with the change to the \"Coast\" adult album alternative format. It was the first day of Summer. In the early 90s, simulcast on WKOD (94.1). May 29, 1996, it briefly became K-94 again with a hard rock format before becoming the Coast again with AAA music.

WSLC-FM is owned and operated by Mel Wheeler, Inc. It airs a country music radio format, using the moniker \"94.9 Star Country.\" WSLC-FM's studios and offices are on Electric Road in Roanoke. The transmitter is off Honeysuckle Road in Bent Mountain.\n\nThe station is powered at 100,000 watts effective radiated power (ERP) on a tower 1962 feet in height above average terrain (HAAT). The Class C signal can be heard over much of Southwest Virginia and into North Carolina and West Virginia. On occasion, WSLC-FM can be picked up more than 200 miles away.\n\nOn July 11, 1948, the station signed on as WDBJ-FM. It was owned by the Times World Corporation, publisher of The Roanoke Times-World, which in 1955 started Channel 7 WDBJ-TV. At first, WDBJ-FM simulcast its AM counterpart, AM 960 WDBJ (now WFIR).\n\nIn the early 1960s, WDBJ-FM was separately programmed with an automated beautiful music format, which lasted till the mid-1990s. The station concentrated on instrumental versions of popular songs, as well as Broadway and Hollywood showtunes.\n\nIn 1969, Jim Gibbons Radio, Inc. bought the station. While the format remained beautiful music, on November 1, the call sign was changed to WPVR. In the 1980s, the station began playing several vocal songs each hour, moving to an easy listening sound.\n\nIn the 1990s, many easy listening stations began decreasing the orchestrated instrumentals, and by 1992, WPVR had evolved into soft adult contemporary, branded as \"Lite 95.\" In 1995, WPVR became \"Arrow 94.9\" with a classic rock format.\n\nIn 2000, Mel Wheeler, Inc. bought the station, along with 99.1 WSLQ-FM and 960 WFIR. At noon on May 25, the call sign was switched to WSLC-FM. The format flipped to country music, branded as \"The New 94.9 Star Country\". The sister station of WSLC-FM, AM 610 WSLC, had played country music for over 50 years, so both the AM and FM carried the same call letters and country music imaging for two years. On March 13, 2002, AM 610 ended its run as a country station, becoming urban adult contemporary WVBE, \"The Vibe.\" In 2016 it flipped to sports radio as WPLY.\n\nAfter April 1, 2004, WSLC-FM stopped calling itself \"The New 94.9 Star Country,\" and began using the branding \"94.9 Star Country; Your Big Giveaway Station\".\n\nThe station's logo appeared during a segment in Borat where he mocked the US National Anthem in a county fair in Salem, VA.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, WSLC-FM filed for an STA to lower their power to 30 kW. Engineers cited their antenna, shared with sister station WSLQ failed and they were in the process of rebuilding it. Claiming the stations are diplexed into a standby antenna on another tower, also owned by them, at the same site. This STA request for lower power was granted in under 24 hours, with it being finalized on 5/18/2021.\n\nOn November 9, 2021, WSLC-FM sent a letter to the FCC stating that the station resumed back to normal operations on June 7th, cancelling the STA that had been issued to them.\n\nWKHK\n\n95.3\n\n237B\n\nFormat: Country\n\nOn-Air Positioning: K95\n\nCommunity Of License: Colonial Heights VA\n\nOwner: SummitMedia, LLC\n\nHD Radio™: HD1 - Format: Country\n\nOn-Air Positioning: K95\n\nHD2 - Format: Classic Country\n\nOn-Air Positioning: Classic Country 104.3\n\nHD3 - Format: Christian Contemporary/Preaching (//WRVL/88.3 Lynchburg)*\n\nOn-Air Positioning: The Journey*\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service) Variable Station Identifier\n\nRT (Radio Text - Positioner): New Country K95!\n\nRT (Radio Text - Morning Show): The Bobby Bones Show On K95!\n\nRT (Radio Text): Title By Artist On New Country K95!\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): 6FD0\n\nPTY (Program Type): 10 Country Music\n\nWebsite: Analog/HD1: k95country.com HD2: classiccountry1043.com HD3: myjourneyfm.com\n\nInternet Audio Stream: Analog/HD1: LISTEN LIVE!

The new stations began stunting with a loop of \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\" by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.\n\nThe stunt ended just after Noon, on 9/9/2016, starting the Classic Hip Hop format using Westwood One's Classic Hip Hop network with the first song being heard on WKHK-HD2 being \"Rock It\" by Master P.\n\nWKHK's third subchannel carries Contemporary Christian music format branded as \"The Journey,\" based at WRVL in Lynchburg which feeds translator W235AI at 94.9 FM.\n\nOn 5/1/2013, SummitMedia, LLC purchased Cox Radio's Richmond properties as part of Cox's divestiture of \"non-core\" assets.\n\nOn 12/10/2007, WKHK increased its power. The station is now considered a full Class B station doing 47kW at 512 feet. They were doing 17kW at 394 feet. WKHK transmits from the same tower near the Chippenham Pkwy and I-95 interchange.\n\nOwner Cox Radio was granted a CP to reclassify as a full Class B license from its B1 status on 7/25/05. This will increase WKHK's power to 50kW from 17.5kW plus the antenna is 30 meters (98 feet) higher up (than its old one) on a new tower just west of Charles City (they ended up not moving the antenna but instead used the same tower location). To do this, Cox Radio compensated JLC Properties, headed up by John L Cole, to move the transmitter site of WHLF/95.3 South Boston approximately five miles to the NW and power down to 4kW (from 6kW) and lower it's antenna to 50 meters/164 feet (from 75m/246ft) at the new site. WKHK's studios are on Moorefield Park Drive in Richmond. It is owned by Cox. Used to be WPVA and use WPVA-AM 1290 AM to simulcast its country signal.\n\n* Logo SVG updated and redrawn by Aaron S. of SecludedFox Systems. I love you Aaron <3!

The Sports Animal was moved to 960 AM/WTGM, which was later changed to Fox Sports 960 AM in 2014. Whiskey and Randy have since been moved to mornings on sister country station WWFG/Froggy 99.9.\n\nOn 4/1/2010, WOSC changed their format to sports, branded as \"The Sports Animal.\" The station carried ESPN Radio programming with Whiskey teaming up with PD Randy Scott in the afternoon.\n\nOn 4/28/2009, the Clear Channel national layoffs hit WOSC, leaving JJ Roth, morning show co-host, and Afternoon Jock/PD Rich Drake without jobs. Whiskey was moved into the Afternoon slot, with the syndicated Lex and Terry in the morning. JJ is now the PD and Midday host at WOCM-FM, and Rich Drake is the Afternoon Drive DJ/PD on WBEY/Bay Country 97.9.\n\nIn September 2007, the owners moved \"Don and Mike\" to sister station Sportstalk 960 AM.\n\nIn February 2006, General manager Frank Hamilton hired Cowboy (former Morning Show co-Host at WZBH), and paired him with Whiskey in the afternoon. The show was successful and by September 2006 the station moved Whiskey and Cowboy to mornings, and Don and Mike back to afternoons live. The lineup stayed intact until mid-December 2006, when Cowboy retired from radio. The show returned in January 2007 as \"Whiskey in the Morning\" with JJ as co-host, and was renamed \"Whiskey in the Morning with JJ\" in April 2008.\n\nWOSC is the former home of Mancow's Morning Madhouse which aired from 1999-2003. After dropping Mancow, the station added Elliot in the Morning (from sister station DC101) for a year. The stations once again changed its slogan, to \"96 Rock, Elliot in the Morning and Don and Mike in the Afternoon.\" WOSC later decided to promote longtime air personality Jon \"Whiskey\" Wilson to the morning shift. Whiskey in the Morning lasted 15 months until September 2005. Then, WOSC decided to put Don and Mike on in the morning (tape delayed from the day before) and put Whiskey on in the afternoon.\n\nIn September 2000 the station was sold to Clear Channel Communications. Two months later, the station added Don and Mike to afternoons.\n\nIn early 1993 this station was sold to Benchmark Communications along with top-40 station WKHI from Ocean City, Maryland. Benchmark moved the top-40 programming and WKHI call letters down the dial to 95.9 FM to make room for the debut of Froggy 99.9 at 99.9 FM. 96 Rock disappeared from the airwaves of Delmarva Radio.\n\nIn May 1981, the station was sold to Coastal Communications-Delaware Corporation for $1 million. The new owners changed to the Burkhart/Abrahams Superstars 1 Album Oriented Rock format four months later in September 1981 as \"96 Rock - Delmarva's only Rock 'N Roll.\"\n\n95.9 WWTR-FM signed on the air on June 20, 1974 as an adult contemporary/oldies station owned by J. Parker Connor of Connor Broadcasting. The studios were located on the second floor of the now Connor Jacobson Realty Building at the intersection of North Pennsylvania Avenue and Campbell Place in Bethany Beach, Delaware. The owner's son Brad Connor served as a disc jockey as early as age 15, later progressing to sales and eventually management of the radio station.

Flipped to an alternative rock format, as \"Extreme 96X,\" in July 1999. Was contemporary for a while before that and modern rock \"96-X\" before that. The original plan for this frequency back in the mid 80s was to take up where WGH-FM left off in 1983 with the end of its run as a classical station. The calls were to be WWGH. Instead it started as WIAV \"Wave 96\" with a pop format. It was then co-owned with WVAB-AM 1550. Bishop L.E. Willis later bought the two stations and then bought 92.1, later spinning off WVAB. Was known as dance/CHR 'Kiss 96' (December 1988 to May 1989) WKSV. Flipped from dance/CHR to Christian when WXRI (105.3) was sold in May 1989. Later flipped to WMYA 'Touch 96' (August 1991). When the owner of the new WKOC flipped from adult urban to Triple A, he agreed with the Bishop to preserve the urban adult format by actually running commercials on the new 'Coast' to listen to 'Touch 96'. Was sold to Sinclair Telecable from Willis Broadcasting in late October 1993. That's when 96-X (\"Experimental Radio\") was launched...October 25, 1993. Note: 96X has a low-powered relay in Norfolk. In 1995, they fired up their new translator [106.1 W291AE (ERP 250W)] which is best heard in downtown Norfolk to help eliminate signal dropout in the downtown area. Tidewater Communications, which owned rocker 'FM99' WNOR and '106.9 The Fox' WAFX at the time, filed a petition with the FCC to deny WROX a construction permit.

Sister Alternative WROX (96X) PD Nick Chappell will serve as PD and morning host on Lucy FM. Chappell told radio industry leader All Access, \"We are very excited to launch LUCY FM and bring a mix of the best new songs and some classic throwbacks to Hampton Roads. Pop music is bigger than ever right now, and Lucy has a playlist that will keep people moving with hit song after hit song.\" Lucy FM was launched on Tuesday morning (September 6th, 2022) following the weekend long stunt, launching with Harry Styles' \"As It Was.\"\n\nDropped all-comedy format on 1/27/2014 for Sports/Talk, \"FOX Sports 850\" and later switched branding to \"Sports Radio 850 AM and 96.5 FM.\"\n\nDropped \"Funny\" for \"Comedy\" on 2/28/2013 staying with the all-comedy format. Dropped Talk for All-Comedy \"Funny 850\" at noon on 6/20/2011. Dumped \"TalkRadio 850\" for \"FOX Sports Radio 850\" just after midnight on 1/30/2006 but six months later, it trashed most of the FOX Sports programming and went back to its former format -- Talk but with a brand new line-up. WTAR used to be at 790 AM. 850 used to be WNIS (which moved here from 1350), which is now at 790. The 850 frequency dates back to 1952. For many years 850 used to be soul formatted WRAP.

The station can only be heard on 97.3 HD2 now despite the websites, logos and everything mentioning 1310 AM and 100.9 FM.\n\nOn June 17, 2022, at ~11pm, the tower for WGH-FM 97.3 was struck by lightning, knocking the station off the air. According to an FCC exhibit, WGH-FM shortly resumed broadcasting from the same site with the backup transmitter and antenna with 1.1 kW ERP at 350' AGL. Max Media claimed to the FCC they have had an engineer and tower crew examine the site to determine where the damage occured and once that review is completed, any necessary equipment will be ordered for repairs. Max Media requested an engineering-STA (Alternative Backup PDF) for reduced power on June 24, which as of June 27, is still pending in FCC database.\n\nSold to Max Media from Barnstable Broadcasting in early 2005. The cluster (92.9/WFOG, 94.1/WXEZ, 97.3/WGH, 100.5/WXMM, 1310/WCMS) went for $80M. A sixth station in the Barnstable cluster (1050/WVXX) was sold separately.\n\nWas known as \"New Country Eagle 97.3\" for the longest time until October 1, 2002. WGH-FM actually started in August 1947. The original frequency was 96.5 MHz.\n\nThe stated intention in 1947 was to shut down the AM station at sometime in the future, once the FM was well-established.\n\nThey also explored starting a WGH-TV (channel 7) in the late 40s, but this never came to fruition.\n\nThis FMer did a mix of simulcasting with the AM and FM-only programming, including classical music and live sports.\n\nEventually (in the late 60s or early 70s), they decided to go with the all-classical format.\n\nThat lasted until the sale on Sept 1, 1983, when it became WNSY-FM \"Sunny 97\" with a soft rock format.\n\nWGH was sold to new owners - Commcor - and unceremoniously pulled the plug on WGH-FM so quickly that they interrupted the final strains of Pachelbel's \"Canon in D major.\" in the middle of the track.\n\nThat lasted a year or so, then the format was flipped to Top 40 \"Y-97.\"\n\nIn 1985, Susquehanna took over, renamed it WRSR '97 Star' and kept the Top 40 format. The WGH-FM call letters came back in December of 1986.\n\nIn 1990, when Susquehanna decided to kill the Top 40 format and switch to \"New Country Eagle 97.\" Jeff Moreau signed off \"97 Star.\" The \"Eagle Country\" format used to be at 105.3 FM.\n\nThe WGH call letters stand for 'World's Greatest Harbor'.\n\nAlso to note that in the late 1980's, while 'Z-104' WNVZ and WGH were competing for ratings, WGH is where Paul 'Cubby' Bryant got his start in commercial radio.\n\nCubby is now at \"Z100\" WHTZ in New York as APD/MD.\n\nBig name MJ Kelli (Todd Schnitt) now with his own morning show at \"93-3 FLZ\" WFLZ Tampa FL and a syndicated talk show on several stations around the country also played a big part (evening DJ) at '97 Star' in the late 80's. He briefly jumped ship to 'Z-104' (August 1988 to October 1989) before eventually moving on to \"93-3 FLZ.\"\n\nHDR-14 Screengrabs:\n\nWWWV\n\n97.5\n\n248B\n\nFormat: Classic Rock\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 97.5 3WV WWWV\n\nCommunity Of License: Charlottesville VA\n\nOwner: Saga Communications\n\nHD Radio™: Not Licensed\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Dynamic) Variable Station Positioner\n\nPS (Program Service - DJ Voicetrack) WWWV 3WV Rocks!\n\nPS (Program Service - Music) Title BY Artist + ON 97.5 3WV WWWV\n\nRT (Radio Text - Commercial) www.3wv.Com - WWWV\n\nRT (Radio Text - DJ Voicetrack) 3WV ROCKS!\n\nRT (Radio Text - Music) Title BY Artist + ON 97.5 3WV\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): 9111\n\nPTY (Program Type): 6 Classic Rock\n\nWebsite: 3wv.com\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!

WWWV is owned and operated by the \"Charlottesville Radio Group\" subsidiary of Saga Communications.\n\nIn 2017, WWWV dropped all new rock to become strictly classic rock, coinciding with a slogan change from the longtime \"Everything That Rocks\" to \"Iconic Rock.\"\n\nSince flipping to a broadly rock format in 1977, the station's music has aged with its audience, remaining a modern rock reporter through the 1990s before adding recurrents and moving to active rock.\n\nIn 2004, Saga Communications would purchase Charlottesville Broadcasting Corporation's three-station cluster.\n\nIn 1998, Eure combined WWWV with Charlottesville Broadcasting Corporation's WINA-AM 1070 and WQMZ-FM 95.1 in a merger deal. Eure was ordered by the Department of Justice to spin off the merger's two remaining stations, WCHV-AM and WKAV-AM 1400 to Clear Channel, as FCC regulators took issue with Eure's potential ownership of five stations in the small market. The FCC under a different leadership permitted Clear Channel to own six stations just five years later.\n\nIn 1996, Michelle stepped down to become the Local Sales Manager of the station and Rick Daniels took over her news/sidekick responsibilities. The show was renamed the Big Greasy Breakfast and went on to gain local fame with his Friday Freakouts, a general weekly recap of the past week's news, sports and entertainment irritabilities. Rick then decided to leave the show after getting an offer to host the morning show on sister station WINA. Highway John, formerly nights (and sometime BGB participant) now fills Rick's chair.\n\nWWWV is known for its local popularity, its Fan Club, the 3WV Freeloaders and the Big Greasy Breakfast morning show. The BGB has been the most popular, highest rated, longest running morning show in Central Virginia for over 16 years. Through the 80's the morning show was helmed by Jay Lopez (now at sister station WQMZ) and Vinnie Kice (now at a crosstown Clear Channel affiliate). The duo left 3WV for another station in North Carolina and were replaced with the Max in the Morning Show in 1992 with Max Hoecker and Michelle DeLang.\n\nDuring the years of 1987-1988, Clay would sell all of his broadcasting interests, with WWWV and WCHV-AM going to Eure Communications, then-owners of WXEZ Yorktown.\n\nOn 4/1/1978, under Operations Manager Ed Owens, Rad Messick became 3WV's first program director and live personality/morning host. WDVE's Phil Kirzyc later joined for evenings with Messick moving to afternoons and Greg Wells becoming the new morning host. Jim Huste, Ashley Allen, Dave Mitchell, and Steve Harris were also members of the late 70s 3WV airstaff.\n\nOn 1/10/1977, the station would drop the beautiful music format in favor of album-oriented rock (AOR), branding as \"3WV\" with new callsign, WWWV. They would implement an automated version of the Lee Abrams 'Superstars' format that included voice tracking from WCHV-AM personalities.\n\nOn 1/1/1973, Evans would sell WCCV-FM and WCHV-AM to Lyell B. Clay's \"Clay Broadcasting,\" owner of several newspapers and television stations, most notably WWAY of Wilmington, DE, but no other radio stations.\n\nOn 5/1/1971, WCCV-FM would drop country format in favor of original beautiful music format.\n\nOn 3/7/1970, WCCV-FM would flip to country music daytime and a simulcast of WCHV-AM's adult contemporary format between 6p and 6a.\n\nOn 12/4/1968, WCCV-FM and sister station, WCHV-AM were sold to Charlottesville resident Edward S. Evans, Jr.\n\nSigned on as WCCV-FM on March 5, 1960, with a middle-of-the-road post-war pop and light classical music format, co-owned with WCHV-AM 1260 kHz by Roger and Louise Neuhoff's Eastern Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nWMDM\n\n97.7\n\n249A\n\nFormat: Classic Hits\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 97.7 The Bay\n\nCommunity Of License: Lexington Park MD\n\nOwner: Somar Communications Inc\n\nHD Radio™: Not Licensed\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service) Variable Station Identifier\n\nRT (Radio Text) 97.7 The Bay + Title/Artist\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): 74B2\n\nPTY (Program Type): 7 Adult Hits\n\nWebsite: 977thebay.com\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nFacilities: 298' 3.3 kW\n\nService Designation: FM – Full Service FM Station / Class A\n\nTransmitter Site: 38° 16' 57\" N 76° 33' 35\" W\n\nFCC Facility ID: 61314\n\nFrequency Background:\n\nOn 1/3/2018, WMDM dropped Active Rock \"97-7 The Rocket\" for Classic Hits \"97-7 The Bay\" with new on-air staff and new lineup.\n\nOn the afternoon of 4/18/2017, WMDM flipped the format to Active Rock from Classic Rock, retaining \"97-7 The Rocket\". DJ \"Blak Jak\" announced the change on his 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. program.\n\nOn 3/11/2011, WMDM flipped the format to Classic Rock from Soft AC \"Easy 97.7\" using \"97-7 The Rocket.\"\n\nOn 11/30/2009 and after doing CHR for just seven months, WMDM changes format to Easy Listening as \"Easy 97.7.\"\n\nOn 4/21/2009, the \"The Rocket\" branding was brought back, with the format switched to Contemporary Hit Radio from Hot AC \"Magic 97.7.\"\n\nWas Mainstream Rock as \"97-7 The Rocket\" until late March 2009.\n\nChanged call letters back to the station's original calls of WMDM from WYRX on 3/4/2009.\n\nChanged call letters back to WYRX from WRKZ on 1/22/2008.\n\nChanged call letters from WYRX to WRKZ on 9/12/2007.\n\nChanged the long time call letters of WMDM for WYRX on 7/6/2006.\n\nIn late 5/2006, the station dropped (50-70s) \"Oldies 97.7\" for Modern Rock/Alternative -- \"97-7 The Rocket, Southern Maryland's New Rock Alternative.\" Somar (the then current owners) picked up \"Moondog\" to run its stations (WMDM/97.7, WSMD/98.3, WKIK/102.9, WPTX/1690) a couple of months previous to the format flip.\n\nIn early 6/2006, Moondog said to a local newspaper \"What will you hear (on the new 97.7)?... Rage Against the Machine, Butthole Surfers, whatever … There\"s no corporate VP telling me to play these 5 songs every week.\"\n\nEight days later, the same newspaper reports that the owners had canned Moondog. Quickly in mid-6/2006, 97.7 morphed into Mainstream Rock -- \"97-7 The Rocket, Southern Maryland's Rock Station.\"\n\nProvides pretty good coverage on the Northern Neck. Can also be heard in DC's southeastern suburbs. Used to be \"Power 97.7\" with a Hot AC/CHR format. Then they switched it to Legendary Rock - 97.7 as some sort of classic rock/hits mix. Then to Westwood One's Country \"97-7 The Bay\".\n\nWTVR-FM\n\n98.1\n\n251B\n\nFormat: Adult Contemporary\n\nOn-Air Positioning: Mix 98.1, Today's Variety\n\nCommunity Of License: Richmond VA\n\nOwner: Audacy, Inc\n\nHD Radio™: HD1 - Format: Adult Contemporary\n\nOn-Air Positioning: Mix 98.1, Today's Variety\n\nHD2 - Format: News/Talk\n\nOn-Air Positioning: News Radio 1140 AM and 96.1 FM // WRVA-AM Richmond VA\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Dynamic) Variable Station Identifier\n\nRT (Radio Text - Promo Positioner) Download the free Audacy app today!

As the holidays ended, iHeartMedia rebranded the station as \"Mix 98.1\" on December 28. Despite the new branding, the format remains adult contemporary, although more uptempo.\n\nDropped The JAZZ Club on 6/25/08 for Broadcast Architecture's Smooth Jazz Network.

Started broadcasting digitally with iBiquity's HD Radio™ Sping 2005 and started its HD2 channel beginning of 11/2006 as Smooth Jazz. Studios on Basie Rd in Richmond. Started broadcasting in 1946; it was the first FM station in Richmond. WTVR used to have an easy listening format in the 1970s are early 1980s. Then became \"Stereo Country FM 98.\" It was country for almost 10 years before going back into the Easy Listening format in the early 90's. The late Scott Stevens, most recently of Richmond traffic reporting fame, was a DJ at WTVR during the Country format era. Its original calls were WCOD. WTVR used to be owned by Park Broadcasting with Channel 6; it is now owned by Clear Channel.\n\n* Mix 98.1 still retains iHeart's original positioner, which is similar to that WOWI, WNOH and WMOV.\n\n** Mix 98.1 still retains iHeart's PI code standard, changing the first number in the code to a number 1, supposedly for traffic info or other content, however, Mix 98.1 doesn't broadcast traffic info over their RDS or via HD Radio.\n\nW253BI\n\n98.5\n\n253D\n\nFormat: Country // WRXL-FM HD2\n\nOn-Air Positioning: BIG 98.5\n\nCommunity Of License: Glen Allen VA\n\nOwner: Audacy, Inc\n\nHD Radio™: Not Licensed\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Dynamic) WRXL-HD2 + VARIABLE STATION POSITIONER\n\nRT (Radio Text - Positioner) Big 98.5 - Richmond's New Country\n\nRT (Radio Text - Commercial Positioner) We're Always Streaming Live Download the FREE Audacy App Today\n\nRT (Radio Text) Artist - Title\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): D3AB\n\nPTY (Program Type): 10 Country Music\n\nWebsite: audacy.com/big985country\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nFacilities: 722' .25 kW\n\nService Designation: FX – Translator Station (retransmits signal, different channel than main station) / Class D\n\nTransmitter Site: 37° 36' 53\" N 77° 30' 55\" W\n\nFCC Facility ID: 148159\n\nFrequency Background:\n\nCountry Big 98.5 is a rebroadcast of 102.1 WRXL-FM HD2 and serves Greater Richmond and much of the surrounding Central Virginia. The WRXL-HD2 studios, and the transmitters for both WRXL and W253BI, reside in the Richmond suburb of Dumbarton.\n\nOn 11/1/2017, iHeartMedia announced that WRXL-HD2/W253BI, along with all of its sister stations in Richmond VA and Chattanooga TN, would be swapped to Entercom (now Audacy, Inc), as a result of that company's merger with CBS Radio. The sale was completed on 12/19/2017. THe deal had iHeartMedia taking over several former CBS and Entercom stations in Boston and Seattle in exchange for the Richmond VA and Chattanooga TN stations.\n\nOn July 27th, 2015, at 9:03 am, W253BI flipped to country as \"Big 98.5\" launching with 10,000 songs commercial free. Big 98.5's first song was \"Kick The Dust Up\" by Luke Bryan. Since translators aren't legally permitted to originate their own programming, by FCC regulation, W253BI is relaying WRXL-HD2.\n\nThe simulcast of WRVA ended on July 23, 2015, at 3pm, after the end of that day's Rush Limbaugh show. The station then began stunting with construction noises, with liners telling WRVA listeners to move to 1140 AM, and to listen the following Monday (June 27th) at 9AM for \"something new on 98.5\".\n\nIn April 2013, iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel Communications) applied for a construction permit of a translator on 98.5 FM in Glen Allen, VA. Originally listed as a translator for WRVQ, this translator would cover the Greater Richmond area and much of surrounding Central Virginia. In June 2013, the Construction Permit was modified to translate WTVR-FM. On May 5, 2014, the station signed on as a simulcast of iHeartRadio's (then Clear Channel Communication's) WRVA, using the branding \"NewsRadio 1140 & 98.5 FM\" and translating WTVR-HD2.\n\nWKJM\n\n99.3\n\n257A\n\nFormat: Urban Adult Contemporary // WKJS\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 105.7/99.3 Kiss FM\n\nCommunity Of License: Petersburg VA\n\nOwner: Radio One\n\nHD Radio™: Not Licensed\n\nRDS: No\n\nWebsite: kissrichmond.com\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nFacilities: 328' 6 kW / Directional Antenna\n\nService Designation: FM — Full Service FM Station / Class A\n\nTransmitter Site: 37° 14' 1\" N 77° 22' 36\" W\n\nFCC Facility ID: 60477\n\nFrequency Background:\n\nChanged call letters from WPZZ to WKJM on 11/25/2004. In a major station shake-up at midnight on Thursday, November 18, 2004, Radio One moved Gospel \"Praise 99.3\" to it strongest signal 104.7/Crewe and took on a new simulcast of Urban AC \"105.7 Kiss FM\" WJMO/Richmond. On 12/3/03, flipped from jockless Rhythmic to Gospel as \"Praise 99.3.\" Took the WPZZ calls on 11/25/2003. Stopped simulcasting 105.7 in mid-April 2001 to flip to Gospel as \"Praise 99.3\" WPLZ. The station had changed calls to WPZE so that the WPLZ calls could move to 105.7. In the summer of 2001, Radio One got wind of Clear Channel's pending flip of \"Oldies 106.5\" WRCL to a CHR/Rhythmic. So one day before \"106.5 The Beat\" WBTJ signed-on (6/10/2001), Radio One signed-on Hip-Hop \"Hot 9-9-3\" WRHH to flank market leader Urban \"Power 92-1\" WCDX. This didn't work. \"The Beat\" eventually shifted to Urban go head-to-head with \"Power.\" \"The Beat\" became the undisputed Urban leader in Richmond; knocking \"Power\" down to a tie for 8th place in the overall ratings in the Summer 2003 ratings Book. During this same time, \"Hot\" shifted to the Rhythmic format and went jockless and oddly enough, 99.3 enjoyed its best ratings. Was Urban AC until December 1998 when it switched to Urban Oldies. This station was purchased by Radio One in early 1999. Studios on Emerywood Parkway in Richmond. Call letters stand for former slogan: \"music to please,\" back when it was once an easy listening station. Dates back to 1966. An interesting sidelight, at one point in time the programming on \"Majic 99\" WPLZ was simulcast on 99.3 in Fredericksburg VA and in Charlottesville in an effort to extend the reach of WPLZ's signal to the north and west of Richmond.\n\nWCYK-FM\n\n99.7\n\n259B\n\nFormat: Country\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 99-7 CYK\n\nCommunity Of License: Staunton VA\n\nOwner: Monticello Media\n\nHD Radio™: Not Licensed\n\nRDS: No\n\nWebsite: 997cyk.com\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nFacilities: 1693' 3.3 kW\n\nService Designation: FM – Full Service FM Station / Class B\n\nTransmitter Site: 38° 3' 52.4\" N 78° 48' 17.0\" W\n\nFCC Facility ID: 70861\n\nFrequency Background:\n\nWCYK is a country formatted radio station licensed to Staunton, Virginia, serving Charlottesville, Harrisonburg, and Staunton in Virginia. WCYK-FM is owned and operated by Monticello Media.\n\nWANV-FM signed on August 1, 1984 with a light adult contemporary format. The station was co-owned by M. Robert \"Bob\" Rogers' High Fidelity Music Show, Inc. with country WANV (970 kHz) in Waynesboro. Bob Rogers was the former manager of WGMS in Washington, and with his wife Terry ran a series of annual High Fidelity Music Show expos to showcase the latest in home audio technology. The station initially transmitted from Elliott Knob west of Staunton, high enough to cover the Staunton-Waynesboro-Harrisonburg portion of the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nIn 1989, WANV-FM received a permit to move to Bear Den Mountain, just east of Waynesboro and north of Afton Mountain. Although this site is roughly 1,500 feet lower than Elliott Knob, it affords a much wider coverage area, with local-grade service to the Charlottesville metro in addition to the valley to the west. The station flipped to oldies during 1991.\n\nBob Rogers died in 1992, and the two stations passed to his son as executor, who began looking for a buyer. In March 1994, Michael Douglass' Clark Broadcasting Company bought WANV-FM along with longtime Charlottesville country stations WCYK (810 kHz) and WCYK-FM (102.3 MHz), based in Crozet. Clark changed the callsign to WVAO-FM and kept the oldies format. To take advantage of the 99.7 MHz facility's superior signal, Clark then moved the more popular country format and WCYK-FM callsign from 102.3 in February 1996. That station took the oldies and WVAO-FM callsign in return.\n\nClear Channel entered the Charlottesville market by buying Clark's three FM stations in 1998. The company ran the station as \"Country 99.7\", but otherwise did not make changes.\n\nClear Channel exited the Charlottesville market in June 2007 by selling all of its stations to George Reed's Sistema 102 LLC, which was later renamed Monticello Media. On November 3, 2007, Monticello tweaked the station's branding to \"Your Country 99.7\". On the morning of September 16, 2010, the station adopted the \"Hitkicker 99-7\" brand, which came with changes to airstaff but not music.\n\nExactly seven years later, on September 16, 2017, the station shifted brands again to \"99.7 CYK\", at the same time adding some recurrents to a music rotation that was largely hit-based. This occurred as a result of increased competition from WCVL-FM (92.7 MHz), which airs a 1990-based country format, and a format change at Monticello's own classic country outlet WKAV.\n\nWAQM-FM\n\n100.1\n\n261\n\nFormat: SHUT DOWN by FCC (Album-Oriented Rock)\n\nOn-Air Positioning: WAQM-FM 100.1 The Legacy\n\nCommunity Of License:\n\nOwner: Troy Cheever\n\nWebsite: voodoohippieradio.wixsite.com/a1audio\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nFacilities: ???' .035 kW\n\nService Designation: Unlicensed\n\nTransmitter Site: 37.544548° N 76.342332° W\n\nFCC Facility ID:\n\nFrequency Background:\n\nPirate radio station broadcasting from a house off of Fishing Bay Rd in Deltaville, VA. Was shut down by the FCC in mid-March 2018. Station was revived as a part 15 AM station on 1620 KHz under unlicensed call letters WAQM AM branded as \"The Legacy\" Hampton, VA on Derby Drive, Magruder Run. They claim to have coverage of \"1.5-2 miles sometimes further on High End Radios.\"\n\nComment Posted By Troy Cheever (Posted May 7, 2018 at 2:08 am):\n\nLook I enjoy Hobby Broadcasting and I did a little flirting around with a few Watts on FM (But Will Never Do so ever again) and people loved my Album Rock station. However it is not my interest to tease or taunt the FCC so I shut it down and switched to part 15 legal AM Hobby Broadcasting . I did find that on AM via part 15 section 219 compliance setup in an area that is not overrun by electrical interference one can legally transmit 1.5-2 miles on the upper section of AM broadcast band around 1630-1700 Khz. Now this is only to a Car Radio or HIGH END AM receiver but at least its legal. Your results may very upon location and some may not go beyond 300-600 Feet. If the FCC and broadcasters would go ahead and sign a truce with Hobby Broadcasters and allow for rural areas for hobby operators to have at or equal or near the signal intensity of a TIS station there is very good reason to expect that just like New Zealand and other contries the Pirate Radio issue will be nullified. In New Zealand its allowed on FM on a section of the band which has been given to Hobby or individual broadcasters who wish to start a station with a niche programming format without a licensing cost of well into the triple digit figures. Pirate Radio in the USA is not a new concept which can be verified via songs by well known artists like The Roaring Sixties which title is We Love The Pirate Stations asking the FCC to leave them alone. It even has someone crying in the back ground because their favorite Pirate station was shut down by the government and they can no longer listen to their favorite music. This happened sometime in 1966 when I looked up the original release of this particular song. Why did people like it in 1966 so much to make a protest hit single and public behavior shows they still do? Because just like in the 80s the FCC forced upon cable TV providers to have community access channels which allow individuals to schedule a show and broadcast it to the entire town. Hobby Broadcasting should be considered a citizen access frequency or audio channel and this should not be demonized or thought of as criminal behavior but rather a necessary outlet to share niche ideas and music not provided by other FREE to receive over the air Radio stations. Its safe to say that is what Broadcast Radio was originally intended before corporate outcry to the US government only to stifle a conflict to a growing cash flow. In conclusion just like the title of an album by The Kinks Give The People What They Want is really the best psychology and most humane way to handle this situation. that or make it mandatory that 1 receivable station with EVERY musical genera is receivable to every city in the USA even the most rural of cities. This also helps with emergency situations too. An example would be that every city better have one Album Rock (Deep Tracks, Progressive Rock), Classic Rock station and if not than the members of every broadcasting company shall be fined so much money per day until it is indeed met. They want HD Radio to tie up more space in the broadcast bands? They have no excuse why not then. Radio is for the people not for the cash cows and if they want to cry \"No Fair\" lets show them what \"No Fair\" is. Lovers of say Classic Country, Polka, Big Band and so on may also want to join this fight too. Maybe then these self minded folks will come down to earth and realize this is just human nature to want to put up a station that doesn\"t copy what others are doing.\n\nWVBW\n\n100.5\n\n263B\n\nFormat: Urban Adult Hits\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 100.5 The Vibe\n\nCommunity Of License: Norfolk VA\n\nOwner: Max Media\n\nHD Radio™: Call/Station Name: WVBW\n\nStation Slogan: HD1\n\nStation Message: WVBW THE VIBE\n\nHD1 - Format: Urban Adult Hits\n\nOn-Air Positioning: 100.5 The Vibe\n\nBit Rate: 96kbps HDC\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Static) WVBW\n\nPS (Program Service - Dynamic) WVBW VARIABLE STATION POSITIONER\n\nRT (Radio Text - Positioner) 100.5 The Vibe The Soul Of The 7 Cities\n\nRT (Radio Text - Advertisement Positioner) Injured?

Subsuquently, WVHT's callsign would be changed to WVBW.\n\nOn June 20, 2022, WVHT ended the stunt with a loop of Q-Tip's \"Vivrant Thing\" launching Urban Adult Hits \"100.5 The Vibe\" WVHT Norfolk VA at 5pm. The station is promoting it will launch with a \"massive playlist\" of Hip Hop, R&B, Classic Hip-Hop, and Classic Soul in the spirit of an Adult Hits station under the oversight of VP/Operations & Programming Eddie Haskell and Program Direcor Anthony 'Tone Hollywood' Wheeler. Wheeler joins WVHT from SummitMedia Adult R&B \"107.3 Jamz\" WJMZ Anderson/Greenville SC where he was most recently APD/MD/midday host. The Hampton VA native spent his entire career in Greenville at WJMZ and sister Rhythmic CHR \"Hot 98.1\" WHZT until departing last week. The move also sees the departures of former WVHT PD/midday host Paul McCoy and afternoon host Alex Waters. McCoy programmed WVHT for its entire thirteen year run as a Top 40. Waters joined the station in 2019 from \"Hits 96.5\" WDOD-FM Chattanooga, where he recently began co-hosting the \"Gluten Free Radio Show\" as a night show for syndication with Calista Liew. âWeâre excited to bring a unique, new radio format to Hampton Roads. We will be playing a massive playlist of Urban, R&B, Classic Hip-Hop, and Classic Soul in the spirit of the Adult Hits format. A ton of variety, not only in title count but musical styles. Because, why not?â, said Eddie Haskell Vice President of Operations and Programming. Anthony âTone Hollywoodâ Wheeler has been tapped to be the Brand Manager for the newly launched station. Tone was most recently the midday on-air personality for the Urban AC Juggernaut 107.3 JAMZ in Greenville, SC. Tone remarked, â757 music lovers we have exactly what you have been looking for. A station that plays basically everything! All of the hits that you grew up on and love! One listen to our playlist, and you will say âWOW This is a VIBE!â\n\nOn June 17, 2022, WVHT began stunting at 6pm with a loop of Q-Tip's \"Vivrant Thing\" with sweepers between the loop branding the station with its new \"100.5 The Vibe\" identity. On the morning of 6/17, radio magazine RadioInsight released information on the flip in their Domain Insight sectional, correctly predicting a flip was coming. According to a later Radio Insight Format Changes sectional, the new \"100.5 The Vibe\" would be primarily competing with Audacy's \"95.7 R&B\" WVKL and iHeartMedia's \"103 JAMZ\" WOWI, with the launch appearing to them to occur around the Juneteenth holiday on Sunday or Monday.\n\nOn April 20, 2022, WVHT applied for the ability to experiment with IBOC HD Radio. This request was approved by the FCC on May 27.\n\nBy 11/1/2016, WVHT would return back to the Mainstream CHR format, but retaining the \"Hot 100\" branding.\n\nOn 8/7/2016, WVHT would make another format adjustment, dropping \"Hot 100.5\" and Mainstream CHR format in favor of \"Hot 100\" Adult Contemporary.\n\nAt 8:45am on 1/13/2014, after stunting for an hour with construction sounds, WVHT was relaunched, retaining \"Hot 100.5\" and Top 40 format, but took a more music-intensive approach, as the home for \"25 Hits In A Row,\" with a new logo for the adjustment in format.\n\nChanged call lettrs from WXMM to WVHT on 5/4/2009. Dropped Chinese Hits \"Kung Pao 100.5\" for Mainstream CHR \"Hot 100.5.\" Dropped Mainstream Rock \"100.5 MAX FM\" for Chinese Hits \"Kung Pao 100.5\" Thursday 4/23/2009 at 5 p.m. Sold to Max Media from Barnstable Broadcasting in early 2005. The cluster (92.9/WFOG, 94.1/WXEZ, 97.3/WGH, 100.5/WXMM, 1310/WCMS) went for $80M. A sixth station in the Barnstable cluster (1050/WVXX) was sold separately. After more than 40 years of country music, the format was dropped on November 28, 2003 around 11:30PM for Mainstream Rock. The first song was AC/DC's \"Shook Me All Night Long.\" Previously, shifted to Classic Country at 3PM on April 10, 2003. WCMS-FM had been country formatted since they first came on the airwaves in 1962. The calls originally stood for \"where country music swings.\" However, we hear that the original slogan was \"Western Country Music Station.\"\n\nHDR-14 Screengrabs:\n\nW265EF\n\n100.9\n\n265D\n\nFormat: News/Talk\n\nOn-Air Positioning: FOX Sports 1310, 100.9 and 94.1 HD2\n\nCommunity Of License: Newport News VA\n\nOwner: Max Media\n\nHD Radio™: Not Licensed\n\nRDS: PS (Program Service - Static) WGH AM\n\nRT (Radio Text) MONEY TALK AM 1310 AND 100.9 FM\n\nTA (Traffic Announcement): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): No\n\nPI (Program Identification): 0000\n\nPTY (Program Type): 4 Talk\n\nWebsite: foxsportsradio1310.com\n\nInternet Audio Stream: LISTEN LIVE!\n\nAudio Clips: Problems listening?

Changed the call letlers from WCMS to WGH on 7/1/05 when the owners move the WCMS calls to a property in Eastern NC - 94.5/Hatteras. Sold to Max Media from Barnstable Broadcasting in early 2005. The cluster (92.9/WFOG, 94.1/WXEZ, 97.3/WGH, 100.5/WXMM, 1310/WCMS) went for $80M. A sixth station in the Barnstable cluster (1050/WVXX) was sold separately. Changed the call letters to WCMS from longtime WGH (since 12/10/84) on 12/6/04. The WCMS calls came from AM1050 when the owners sold that station to Davidson Media. Carries the Norfolk Tides Triple-A baseball games. Dates way back to 1928. This used to be Tidewater's main \"top 40\" contemporary station in the 1960s and early 1970s. This station took to the airwaves in October 1928 as WNEW (for Newport News). Call letters were changed to WGH about six weeks later to say 'World's Greatest Harbor.' (The WNEW calls were later taken by the 1130 kHz station in New York City.) WNEW (Newport News) was apparently the descendant of a station at Virginia Beach, WSEA, which did not last long and went dark about 1927. This allocation was picked up by a fellow named Tom Little, who moved it to Newport News. The original WNEW frequency was briefly 1430, then 1310, then and 1340 after the big frequency shakeup of 1941. In January of 1949, it was moved back to 1310 with a big power increase from 250 to 5,000 watts and a brand new transmitter and studio facility in what is now Hampton, VA (city of license stayed Newport News). Station was an NBC Blue, later ABC affiliate. In the mid-late 1950s, WGH dumped the network programming for Top 40, with the name \"Color Radio\" or alternatively \"Color Channel 131.\" They were still trying to compete with TV, then only black and white - so the radio had to be color! Go figure. From the 50s to the late 60s, many of their jingles said \"WGH in Old Virginia.\" Also known as Music 131, Mighty Radio, Famous 1310, the Rock of Virginia, and 13 WGH. Station has been licensed to both Newport News and Norfolk. From 1954 until 1971, WGH was the home of Bob Calvert, a legendary local radio announcer who was the inspiration for Wolfman Jack. During the mid 50s, Bob had a nighttime weekend show in which he became \"Baron Be-Bop,\" playing R&B music and speaking in a black-affected accent. The show was wildly popular, and part of the reason they switched to Top 40. Wolfman Jack at that time was working at 1270 WYOU in Newport News under a different name. He heard Calvert's act, decided to borrow from it, and the rest is history! WGH was the number one station in Tidewater from the late 50s until the mid-70s. The format was changed to adult contemporary in the early 80s, but t"
