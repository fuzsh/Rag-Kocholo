        "text": "TAMPA -- With a Grammy Award nomination, several hit singles, a multi-platinum debut album and millions of fans worldwide, Craig David is leading the pack of R&B artists that emerged in 2001.\n\nDavid's catchy tunes, steeped in R&B, hip-hop and British garage music, has given him an edge in a genre overrun with remixes and unimaginative lyrics.\n\nThe London native will be sharing the bill with Ashanti, The Calling, Michelle Branch, Darude, Paulina Rubio, Aaron Carter and O-Town for WFLZ-FM's Big One -- Version 2.0 concert Sunday in Tampa.\n\n\"I'm very passionate about music. I'd love to be an artist, but there are so many other people out there who want to do exactly the same thing,\" he told Interview Magazine. \"Every weekend, I'd go to London and buy promos or import records from the States. Listening to them helped me understand the different regions.\"\n\nDavid, who names Terence Trent d'Arby as a major influence, also took notes from musical legends Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. But as a teen-age DJ, it was David's ability to meld club beats and write meaningful lyrics that enticed him to create his own music.\n\nHis underground following led to a collaboration with the Artful Dodger on the track \"Rewind,\" further establishing his unique style.\n\n\"The key thing for me was the DJ-ing, because that allowed me to listen to a wide variety of music, so I was able to take (in) loads of different influences,\" the 21-year-old said.\n\nDavid, who's sharing headlining responsibilities with Ashanti, will give fans their fill of his trademark two-step beats and tongue-twisting ballads at the show.\n\nAlthough the Calling's single, \"Wherever You Will Go,\" has been a radio station favorite, the Los Angeles-based band first performed the song on the film \"Coyote Ugly\" in 2000. It followed up that hit with \"Adrienne.\"\n\nMexican singer Paulina Rubio -- who has been connecting with international audiences since she was a teen-ager in \"Timbiriche,\" a children's recording group in South America -- is after mainstream appeal. Rubio is touring the States to support the upcoming release of her English-language debut album \"Border Girl,\" and its first single, \"Don't Say Good-bye.\"\n\nDavid won't be the only DJ on the stage. Darude, who has had gradual cross-over success from the album \"Out Of Control (2000),\" will spin tunes that will give audiences a taste of pulsating trance beats and house rhythms. Half the singles from the album became club anthems in 2001.\n\nPint-sized singer/song-writer Michelle Branch, 18, will perform a set from her album \"The Spirit Room.\" Discovered at age 15 when she opened for the trio of brothers known as Hansen, later this summer she will headline her own tour.\n\nAlso performing is classically trained pianist and ballet dancer turned singer, Vanessa Carlton, who will also open for the Goo Goo Dolls and Third Eye Blind tours later this summer.\n\nOther pop acts scheduled to perform at the Big One include Aaron Carter and O-Town."
