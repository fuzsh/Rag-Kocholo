        "text": "Dave \"Rhino\" Reinhart balances playing den mother to his disc jockeys with his efforts to push Clear Channel Communication's Tampa Bay area radio stations to the top.\n\nIt's 9:30 a.m., and hosts of three of the top-rated morning shows on Tampa Bay radio are performing verbal acrobatics to grab the attention of fickle drive-time listeners.\n\nShock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem chats about excrement and female anatomy on WXTB-FM 98.1 (98 Rock). The top-rated team of M.J. Kelli and B.J. Harris serve up stunts, celebrity gossip and trick phone calls on WFLZ-FM (93-3 FLZ). The slightly more sedate duo of Carmen Connors and Chris White wax outraged over some item in the day's news on WSSR-FM (Star 95.7).\n\nTheir exertions seem a fierce competition for ratings, waged across the bay area's airwaves. In reality, they do battle from neighboring broadcast booths in a nondescript office building on Gandy Boulevard in South Tampa. They all work for the same media conglomerate, Clear Channel Communications.\n\nAnd they all report to the same unlikely media mogul: Dave Reinhart.\n\nA onetime disc jockey and stockbroker, Reinhart is the calm, low-key maestro of this broadcast madhouse. For the eight bay area radio stations owned by Clear Channel, Reinhart is in charge of keeping the rival egos in check, the raunch just short of raising the Federal Communication Commission's ire and the ratings high.\n\nAs Clear Channel's market manager for Florida's Gulf Coast, Reinhart also is in command of six more radio stations in Sarasota, not to mention the Tampa Bay Devil Rays Radio Network. He's a player in the consolidation that has swept the radio business since the FCC eased ownership limits that guaranteed diverse ownership of the public airwaves.\n\nIn Tampa Bay's $110-million-a-year radio market, where each rating share is worth about $1.1-million a year in advertising dollars, Clear Channel's take is about half.\n\nAll of which makes Reinhart one of the most powerful media executives in the bay area. Not that you'd ever hear him say it.\n\nReinhart, known as \"Rhino\" through nearly 40 years in the radio industry, downplays any suggestion of clout. Other chains have a strong presence in the bay area market, he says, citing stations owned by rivals Cox Radio and CBS/Infinity.\n\nOverall, Cox's WDUV-FM 103.5 (\"The Dove\") is top-rated, thanks to the \"easy listening\" station's appeal to older listeners. But among listeners age 25 to 54, the so-called \"money demo\" that advertisers crave, Clear Channel boasts five of the top seven stations.\n\nReinhart insists he's hardly complacent and that Clear Channel's lead \"can change at a moment's notice.\n\n\"We're happy to be successful but one of the things that happens is you walk around with a target on your back,\" he said. \"You're ranked high and you're the guy everyone is coming after.\"\n\nWith a pending deal to buy AMFM Inc., Clear Channel will become the largest company in the industry with 850 radio stations nationwide and syndicated programming rights ranging from Dr. Laura to Rush Limbaugh. Last year, Clear Channel reported an 84 percent jump in net income to $72.5-million while sales nearly doubled to $2.7-billion.\n\nInvestors, though, are wary that the company is saddled with too much debt. Its stock has tumbled to near a 52-week low in recent months, closing Friday at $62.13, down $2.88.\n\nIn the future, Clear Channel's unique edge may come from \"cross-marketing\" its side businesses.\n\nClear Channel owns Eller Media, the billboard king with 550,000 boards throughout the country. And it is buying concert promoter SFX Entertainment in a $4.4-billion deal, giving it ownership of some of the country's top sports and entertainment venues plus sports agencies representing some of the biggest baseball and basketball stars in the country.\n\nClear Channel could readily promote rock concerts that it is producing, using both its radio stations and its billboards. Its corporate leaders are toying with selling tickets for its concerts on the Web sites of its radio stations.\n\n\"You could see clips from earlier on a tour online; buy a T-shirt; sign up for a backstage tour,\" Clear Channel president Randy Michaels said. \"It's a huge play.\"\n\nIn the bay area, the company could arrange for Devil Rays players represented by Clear Channel to talk on the Rays' radio network controlled by Clear Channel.\n\n\"You take all those synergies and you put them in the hand of a guy who is a ringmaster like Dave Reinhart and it's very powerful,\" said Tim Menowsky, an area radio consultant. \"He has a great track record of combining hostile forces.\"\n\nWith Clear Channel's succession of acquisitions, Reinhart is bringing eight stations _ and their 270 employees _ under one roof on Gandy Boulevard.\n\nWXTB and WTBT-FM (Thunder 105.5) recently moved into the building. The final station, WHNZ-AM (1250 Wins), will move in within a few weeks.\n\nSome of the stations even share the same sales staff.\n\nSuch combined sales power hasn't driven up ad rates as local advertisers once feared, according to Menowsky, the radio consultant and a onetime competitor with Reinhart in the bay area market. But it has made it harder for ad agencies to pit one station against another in negotiations.\n\n\"Buyers used to be able to say that they would take their business elsewhere if they did not get requested discounts,\" Menowsky said. \"That is not as easy to do when eight stations in one office all talk with each other.\"\n\nReinhart insists the separate sales staffs under him compete for business, much like intramural squads playing for one school.\n\nLikewise, the DJs now under one roof have had to learn to play for the same team. That's where Reinhart steps in.\n\nM.J. Kelli, who is learning to live with arch-rival Bubba the Love Sponge as an office-mate, said Reinhart is more comfortable handling on-air personalities and more willing to experiment with programming than other radio executives who came up through the sales side of the business.\n\n\"He knows how to bring the talent in and just let them do their job,\" Kelli said. His partner, B.J Harris, said, \"He knows you have to have ratings before you can sell the station\" to advertisers.\n\nReinhart even plays the role of on-air authority figure for some of the DJs' stunts. No, Reinhart tells them patiently but firmly, they'll need a release form before they send Dave the Dwarf up in a balloon. Yes, he tells them, they can drop a guy swathed in bubble wrap from a moving car so long as Reinhart and an ambulance are standing by.\n\nReinhart says he enjoys occasionally \"playing the jerk boss\" on air but he tries to keep it to a minimum. \"I've got millions and millions of dollars in the value of the radio stations I'm responsible for, and I don't have time to horse around on the air anymore.\"\n\n+ + +\n\nReinhart, a native of Cincinnati, caught the radio bug as a kid and nurtured it in college.\n\nIn 1961, as a 19-year-old at student at Ohio University in Athens, he drove what he called the \"Ohio triangle\" every weekend: from Athens to a part-time job at a Columbus radio station to his girlfriend's place in Cincinnati and back to Athens. He figures he lost about $3 a weekend on the DJ gig considering gas expenses.\n\n\"But I did it for the experience in a larger market,\" he said, \"and it certainly paid off.\"\n\nAfter a stint in Dayton, he landed a job at WSAI-AM 1360 in Cincinnati as an afternoon DJ playing Top 40 music.\n\nDusty Rhodes, a fellow Cincinnati DJ and best man at Reinhart's wedding, describes his longtime friend as loyal, a straight shooter and unflappable during emergencies.\n\n\"This is a profession that attracts a lot of egos and quite frankly a lot of jerks, the flotsam and jetsam of the world,\" Rhodes said. \"This is a guy that just stood out as a class act and someone you could trust.\"\n\nReinhart and Rhodes took the same segue in their broadcast careers: becoming stockbrokers. For Reinhart, the interlude lasted 18 years.\n\nRhodes, who is now Hamilton County auditor in Cincinnati as well as a part-time DJ, said he wasn't surprised Reinhart was pulled back into broadcasting. \"Its like, how do you get the elephant out of the theater? It's in his blood.\"\n\nWhile at his full-time stockbroker job, Reinhart began working at WLW-AM 700 on the weekends in the mid-1980s. Soon he began jotting down notes for program changes and stuffing them each Saturday under the door of Randy Michaels, then part-owner and programming director at the station.\n\nMichaels, who later ascended to the presidency of Jacor Communications and then Clear Channel, liked the initiative and the ideas. As Michaels moved into Jacor's corporate offices, he encouraged WLW general manager J. David Martin to hire Reinhart as program director.\n\nWith his own background in sales, Martin found a perfect foil in Reinhart, who excelled in dealing with on-air personalities. \"I would say, \"Dave, you deal with those people. I don't think I understand them all that well.' \"\n\nReinhart gained respect in the station even though his buttoned-down style stuck out in an industry known for its zaniness. Michaels, the epitome of the irreverent boss, is still living down antics such as mooning fellow Jacor workers.\n\nReinhart, the family man, spent his time with hobbies such as collecting stamps and experimenting with a ham radio.\n\n\"Dave is such a Boy Scout that he may be the only radio guy I know of that I can't give an unprintable anecdote about,\" Michaels said. \"He's a guy you trust your wallet with or anything else _ certainly your radio stations.\"\n\nMichaels did just that in 1990, promoting Reinhart to run what was then a two-station franchise for Jacor in Tampa: WFLA-AM 970 and WFLZ-FM. Both, Michaels said, were losers.\n\n\"FLA was a dog. It had no ratings, no listeners and no advertising,\" he said. \"FLZ was \"Paradise 93.' Sappy Barry Manilow music.\"\n\nThat changed through the '90s as Jacor and Clear Channel went on buying sprees in Tampa and throughout the country. The companies were the two biggest players in the Tampa Bay area when they merged last year.\n\n+ + +\n\nReinhart's job today comes with its share of headaches.\n\nAmong them: Clear Channel's 75 stations in Florida are being investigated by the state attorney general's office on charges of deceptive or unfair trade practices. At issue is the company practice of forwarding contest callers to a national call center that handles thousands of calls from people around the nation who have entered the same contest in other radio markets.\n\nThe attorney general's office contends the company should run disclaimers telling listeners they are competing against callers from around the country.\n\nCloser to home, DJ Mason Dixon has sued Clear Channel, saying he was fired after he signed a non-complete clause under the erroneous belief that he was continuing on the air. Reinhart and Dixon refused to discuss the case.\n\nThen there's the continuing challenge of keeping the diverse talent happy and the clashing egos in check.\n\n\"He has so many people to deal with, and he has the patience of Job,\" said Carmen Connors of the Carmen & Chris tandem on WSSR-FM. At times, he plays the role of den mother, pampering the DJs.\n\nWhen Connors was trying to quit smoking, she mentioned to the boss that she liked Nestle's Crunch Treasures in blue wrappers. Henceforth, she said, she found a fully-stocked box of the chocolates in Reinhart's office whenever she stopped by.\n\nAs it turns out, Reinhart makes sure to stock caramel Nestle candies in purple wrappers (for M.J. and B.J.) and mini Reese's Peanut Butter Cups for his troops.\n\n\"Whenever I run out, I ask my wife to pick up some candy for the \"kids' at the grocery store,\" he said.\n\nNot that it's all candy and smiles at the office, particularly between M.J. Kelli and Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. \"M.J. stays clear of me and I stay clear of him,\" said Clem, who uses a rear entrance to avoid contact.\n\nIn the latest test for Reinhart, Clem stormed out of the studio a few weeks ago. He balked when Reinhart and WXTB-FM operations manager Brad Hardin refused to sponsor the rowdy rock extravaganza Livestock that has become an annual event in Zephyrhills.\n\nReinhart caved in after 25,000 listeners called and e-mailed the station.\n\n\"A lot of that was schtick,\" Reinhart said of the walkout. Clem insists it was serious.\n\nDuring more than seven years on the air, Clem has repeatedly stirred problems with his raunchy and explicit show. Reinhart convinced Bubba to tone down his act somewhat, though not enough to appease some who question its suitability over the public airwaves.\n\nDespite their run-ins, Clem said he is happy Reinhart has kept dodging lawsuits and kept his show on the air.\n\n\"I can't say enough about him,\" Clem said. \"He's gotten me out of a lot of jams.\"\n\nDavid C.
