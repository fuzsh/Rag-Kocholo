        "text": "Next Article\n\nWe launched our 30 and Under Superstars list, now in its third year, not only to highlight the next generation of radio stars, but to prove that young and talented men and women are joining the radio industry. They are catching the radio bug at an early age, and they are loving every minute of the career path they are now on.\n\nLike most people on a career path at an early age, some on our 2021 list chose radio, while others say radio chose them. No matter how they got here, they are here to stay because of how radio fulfills their career aspirations, and because of how they see radio’s role in their local communities.\n\nIt really isn’t difficult to find men and women 30 years of age and under working in radio. They come to us this year from all over the country, from many different companies and doing every job at a radio station. We gathered a lot of great content from each and every one of them, and you’ll be reading even more of that content in future issues of Radio Ink magazine.\n\nIn this issue, we asked them why they chose radio as a career, how radio can continue to recruit young people, and for any ideas they have to help the industry improve.\n\nHere is our 2021 class of Radio’s 30 and Under Superstars.\n\nANDREW BERGER Age: 30 Imaging Director KPWR (Power 106)/Los Angeles Meruelo Media 5 years with Power 106\n\n“I caught the radio bug at 14,” says Andrew Berger. “I was infatuated by what the mixers were doing. I would be glued to the radio all the time, and I loved how Eric Edwards sounded on Hot 97 and knew I wanted to make DJ drops. I was obsessed with knowing what really happened behind the scenes in radio. I found my way around the building to see everything. It was love at first sight. Funny story, when I first got up to Hot 97, I touched the walls to make sure I was really there!”\n\nBattling the “radio is dead” argument, Berger tells Radio Ink his generation still enjoys the radio — it’s the generation after his who think radio is for older people. “It’s for sure a tough sell!” he says. “I explain to people radio is all about companionship, and that seems to change their thinking.”\n\nBerger would like to see the radio industry work on instilling confidence in employees. “Make them feel valued, and for creatives, make them feel safe to think out of the box.”\n\nJOSEPH CARBALLO Age: 26 Host, The Joe Show, Mornings, WFLZ-FM/ Tampa PM Drive Host, WKQI (Channel 95)/ Detroit iHeartMedia Tampa 7 years in radio\n\nJoe Carballo didn’t have to search far for a mentor: it was his dad, WKQI/Detroit morning personality Mojo, a.k.a. Thomas Carballo. “I’ve been blessed to call many mentors, starting with my father,” Joe says. “He has hosted mornings in Detroit on WKQI for 20-plus years and has been coaching me since I told him I wanted to pursue a radio career. From teaching me techniques to the importance of prep and being a leader, I wouldn’t be the man I am without him, let alone a radio host.”\n\nHe goes on, “Tony Travatto gave me my first shot on air and has been my biggest support since. I wouldn’t be where I am without Tony. He gave me the best gift of allowing me to fail, embracing failure, learning from it, and growing daily. Lastly, Tommy Chuck, my current PD, is a huge mentor, giving my team our first shot at mornings.”\n\nHis number one challenge is the Tampa show, Carballo says. “Launching a brandnew morning show with no experience and no advertising dollars in a city that has some incredible morning shows has definitely been a challenge, but a fun one. I love my team more than anything. We lean on each other daily and know when we lean on each other and stick to being 100% authentic, we can, will, and do succeed.”\n\nTo bring the younger generation into the industry, Carballo has a simple approach: “Embrace new and unique content. Let them talk, let them fail, let them learn.”\n\nETHAN COLE Age: 28 Syndicated On Air Personality iHeartMedia Atlanta 6 years in radio\n\nIn 1973 The Eagles penned the lyrics, “And it’s a certain kind of fool that likes to hear the sound of his own name.” That could be why Ethan Cole chose radio.\n\n“I’ll be honest with this one: it was straight vanity,” he says. “I was in college and my friend had his own radio show. He asked me to come on one night just to have a laugh or whatever, and it was so much fun. The real hook was after, when people on campus were like, ‘Yo, was that you on last night?’ And it was right then and there I had a light bulb moment — Imagine getting paid to do that!”\n\nIn Cole’s world, radio isn’t dying. “It’s the complete opposite. Radio is thriving, and it’s evolving. While it’s still offered as a dial in your car — which drivers told us they still want — you now have the iHeart app on the aux and you can rock out with me there, too. And the best part is if you put me on, you’ve got a friend to vibe with. Radio is now available everywhere, on every device, thanks to digital.”\n\nWhen they find out he works in radio, people his age often respond, “People still listen to radio?” Cole says, “But then they get a look into my life and they realize I literally get to create these awesome relationships with people all over the country that are just trying to vibe. It’s crazy, like I’ll get DMs from people I’ve never met in person saying how much they love the energy I bring and after a long day at work, that’s exactly what they need. So once they see that, their thought on radio changes. It also doesn’t hurt that I’m the plug when it comes to concert tickets.”\n\nSHAUN DOLAN Age: 28 Partner Inrush Broadcast Services iHeartMedia Chicago 10 years in radio\n\nSo what is Inrush Broadcast Services? “It is a broadcast technology integration firm,” says Shaun Dolan. “We provide consulting, installation, and maintenance services to media creators across the U.S. With our roots in broadcast radio, we deliver the benefits of virtualized architectures while incorporating triedand-true broadcast technology, providing best-in-class solutions to enterprises and independent operators alike.”\n\nLike many in the business, the radio bug bit Dolan when he was a kid. “Growing up, I felt that radio was just a cool, transcendental, bigger-than-life force. For example, my favorite toy was a Wild Planet Real Radio DJ Studio, a tiny plastic console with a tape deck and a Part 15 AM transmitter inside, and I won tickets to my first ‘concert’ from Radio Disney. Once I got involved at my college radio station and learned there was a space for me in between the art and science of radio, I was hooked.”\n\nHe believes mentorship is a key to getting more younger folks into the business. “Successful organizations do not see mentorship as optional; rather, it is baked into the culture of the group. I can draw a direct line between each of my successes and multiple people who either provided the opportunity or helped me achieve it. In our small industry, the mentorship shouldn’t sour when the situation changes; no matter how long the mentee stays in your organization, you’ll always find a grateful friend in them nearby.”\n\nZach Fenner (l) with WTKW (TK99)/Syracuse afternoon drive radio personality Rick Deyulio, in their annual Slushie chug contest at the New York State Fair\n\nZACHARY FENNER Age: 27 Events Coordinator/Promotions Manager Galaxy Media Partners Syracuse, New York 9 years in radio\n\nZach Fenner tells Radio Ink it was production that initially got him interested in radio. “Recording and editing fascinated me,” he says. “However, as I got older I realized I’m a very outgoing person who loves being out at events and talking to strangers. Through discovery and putting myself out there, promoting the radio stations and our events has become my passion. I love being the signage and on-site coordinator of events.”\n\nTo bring more young people into radio, Fenner says the industry needs to be more fluid, flexible, and validating, and each employee needs to be managed differently. “I know, it’s difficult. I have managed 30-plus part-timers over the past seven years, and the number one thing I’ve learned is that you’re not going to get everything right. Just try your best and listen to what these young and talented people are saying, and be open to their ideas. Just listen. Nothing makes a company better than fresh ideas and new perspectives.”\n\nOverall, he’d like to see the industry be more accepting of new ideas. “If it wasn’t for new ideas and the willingness to expand, Galaxy wouldn’t be the company it is today. Ed [Levine] and the rest of us at Galaxy aren’t afraid to take chances. Each year in the events department we plan new and exciting events such as Baconfest, Halloween at the Park, and the Lights on the Lake 5k. Whether it’s a new event like these or taking on more avenues of advertisement like digital and video production, new ideas and taking chances are what keeps Galaxy on the map.”\n\nNIKKI HOLLIS Age: 25 Chief of Staff ESPN Cleveland Good Karma Brands Cleveland 3.5 years in radio\n\nFresh out of The Ohio State University, Nikki Hollis wanted to put her marketing knowledge to work. “When I signed on with Good Karma Brands, I knew I’d be getting the full breadth of marketing experience, from radio to event planning and more. I’ve loved being able to see the cross-channel execution of different campaigns and learning about various mediums and tactics. As someone starting out, I felt it important to get as wide a range of experience as possible.”\n\nAnd she got that experience with the help of her mentor. “I have had the privilege of working alongside Sam Pines, VP at Good Karma Brands, since I started in the workforce,” she says. “He is always pushing me toward new opportunities and consistently challenges me. Sam likes to think big-picture, so everything we do has a goal or strategy in mind. It’s that way of thinking that has really shaped my career path.” Hollis says her contemporaries aren’t as educated on all that radio has to offer. “They tend to live in the podcast and music streaming world. I think that there is a lot that my demographic could learn and benefit from the power of radio.”\n\nEducation and engagement are part of the challenge Hollis has been facing. “The most important part of radio is connecting with and engaging our audience. The past two years have made this more challenging than ever, so delivering new, successful ways to motivate team members, deliver for partners, and stay connected to our audience is a daily goal for us.”\n\nHer suggestion for bringing more young talent into the business? Develop the right type of workplace culture. “Continuously strive toward improving your company culture,” Hollis advises. “I believe that is the forefront of what attracts and maintains young talent in any field, including radio. If you have a strong culture, you will have an even stronger and more successful group of high performers committed to their growth within your company.”\n\nHANNAH CHERRY HOLMES Age: 25 Director of Integrated Marketing and Events Kentucky/Indiana Region iHeartRadio 6 years in radio\n\nHannah Cherry Holmes tells Radio Ink she chose radio as a career because every day is different, with new and exciting challenges. “It’s one of the only careers that allows you to work with a vast number of industries and the experts within them daily.”\n\nHolmes says that to recruit more young people to the business, communication is key. “Young professionals want to know you have the tools for them to succeed, opportunities for them to grow, and values to be proud of. The chance to work in a fun and exciting industry doesn’t hurt either.”\n\nWhat would she like to see the industry do better? “As an industry, we do a fantastic job of leasing our relationships with our listeners to our clients. I think there is still great opportunity to grow and monetize our listener relationships through events, experiences, partnerships, and retail.”\n\nCHARLIE KIRK Age: 28 Syndicated Host Salem Media\n\nCharlie Kirk is a young man on a mission. When he was 18, he started Turning Point USA in his parents’ garage in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. While he was doing that, he was listening to AM 560 The Answer in the same town. He listened to Rush Limbaugh. He absorbed all he could. His organization reaching the nation’s young people with true conservative values continued to grow. Today he counts over 2,000 chapters of Turning Point USA with over 2 million members on campuses all over America.\n\nToday Kirk is filling Rush Limbaugh’s former time slot across the country at many stations, in addition to his podcast, which is one of the top 10 most listened to podcasts on the Apple platform.\n\nKirk attracts 5,000-10,000 young people to each of his rallies across the country and is making a difference in today’s contentious political landscape.\n\nJEFF KURKJIAN Age: 28 Host, Jeff & Aimee in the Morning KCYE (Coyote Country)/Las Vegas Beasley Media Group 6 years in radio\n\nJeff Kurkjian tells Radio Ink he wanted to be a news reporter — but that changed when he found out what a depressing profession it was. “I have many friends who have taken this path and I absolutely support them, but I feel as if I’m too sensitive and optimistic to pursue that career,” he says. “I love to tell stories, make people laugh, find the odd in the ordinary, and be a student of the world. Also, playing music all day is pretty fun too.”\n\nTo get more young people into radio, Kurkjian says the industry needs to realize the importance of self-sustaining social media content creators. “The truth with radio is on-air numbers are so important, the ratings speak volumes to your station’s performance. However, if you have a station getting 500,000 views on every video you post on the Facebook page because the content is original, creative, and impactful, that speaks a whole different story.\n\n“Take advantage of young people who can both hit the post and edit a compelling video. I always say the show comes first, but that doesn’t mean I’m not quickly editing a video during a commercial stopset that will go on our station Instagram account.”\n\nALANA MARTINEZ Age: 27 Director of Sales Planning AIRE Radio Networks Spanish Broadcasting System Miami Beach 6 years in radio\n\nAlana Martinez says she wanted to work in an industry that supports and empowers the Hispanic community. “I fell in love with the complexity behind media planning and enjoy the fact that there is always a new challenge that makes me a stronger professional,” she says. “It’s extremely rewarding to be a part of the strategy behind what our community listens to on the radio on a daily basis.”\n\nHer advice to managers who hope to recruit more young people is to show them that “working in radio is strategic, vibrant, and gives you an opportunity to have a long-standing career, whether that be creative or on the business end.” She says, “Working in radio is exciting and fun, and that should be translated to younger crowds.”\n\nShe’d love to see the industry get better at integrating digital and terrestrial. “The industry must reinvent itself as we are seeing a shift to digital; it’s important to take notice of this and not let what happened to newspapers happen to our industry. We shouldn’t see digital as the enemy. Instead we should create exciting opportunities that show how both mediums work hand-in-hand through new, innovative, and fresh ideas to ensure radio is moving into the new era.”\n\nCELINA MARTINEZ Age: 26 Middays, KHUD (92.9 The Bull)/Tucson Afternoons, KRQQ/Tucson iHeartMedia 2 years in radio\n\nCelina Martinez started her radio career with iHeartMedia in Tucson on the promo team. She was soon promoted to reception, and shortly after got her first airshift. She started doing overnights on iHeart’s AM Tejano station in February of 2020 and a month later was offered middays on Top 40 93.7 KRQ. She has since transitioned to afternoon drive on 93.7 KRQ and middays on Country The Bull.\n\nMartinez tells Radio Ink she chose radio because music has always been a big part of her life. “Music has the power to influence us in so many ways and holds so many memories.\n\nShe goes on, “As a kid I didn’t really have the means to listen to mainstream music, so I relied heavily on the radio. On-air personalities have the power to create special connections with their listeners, and I was very much connected to them. I relied on them not only to keep me updated on the latest and greatest of all things music, but for their companionship and endless entertainment. It was an easy choice once I got to college, but it was one that I never thought I could make a reality. I just knew it was something I wanted to do, and I was determined enough to make it happen.”\n\nELLEN MCNALLY Age: 28 Executive Producer, Mojo in the Morning iHeartMedia Detroit 6 years in radio\n\nEllen McNally tells Radio Ink, “The number one challenge I face on a daily basis is balancing my workload. It is not secret that the number of people working in the industry has greatly decreased, but the work hasn’t. Every person I know in radio wears multiple hats.\n\n“The best way I’ve found to overcome it is to really prioritize what is important to the success of the station and our morning show. If I’m tracking a shift on the station and a break isn’t perfect, I don’t need to redo the break seven times until it’s flawless. Listeners don’t want perfection, they want authenticity.”\n\nThe key to bringing the younger generation into radio, she says, is making sure they know about all the opportunities available. “I think any young person entering the workforce or the radio industry is looking for opportunity. We have a lot of opportunity in radio that people don’t highlight. Someone can start their career as a sales assistant but ask a PD in their cluster if they can sit in on a music meeting and learn about programming. Or take a part-time job as a promotions assistant, learn the ins and outs of promotions and marketing, and become the marketing director for an entire cluster. Highlighting that room for growth and opportunity to learn is incredibly attractive to any young person looking to build a career. “\n\nWhat does McNally think radio needs to do better? “I would like to see the radio industry become better at focusing on diversity. Radio is still a very heavily male-dominated field. I would love to see more women in positions of power within the industry, as well as more people of color.”\n\nHUNTER MERITT Age: 26 Mornings with Hunter Assistant Operations Manager WIKK-FM/Newton-Olney, Illinois Forcht Broadcasting 3 years in radio\n\n“Music has always been a huge part of my life; it is an escape from everyday life and our daily struggles,” says Hunter Meritt. “That’s one great thing about radio — the music you play can really reflect who you are as a person”\n\nShe goes on, “Radio is always adapting to today’s society, and that’s one great thing about it. So my advice to managers and executives is to do just that. Adapt to the needs and wants of these young and talented people. One great thing that really attracted me was being able to help with our social media posts and promotions, and with social media in their hands. It’s a part of their everyday lives.”\n\nMeritt adds, “I’ve been very fortunate to have a job at such a great company that supports its employees and listeners, and I can only hope the same for other local stations. If there was anything I would like to change in the radio industry, it would be to see cooperation among area stations instead of competition between them.”\n\nDJ MIKEITH Age: 26 Radio Personality iHeartMedia Atlanta 5 years in radio\n\nDJ MiKeith tells Radio Ink he chose radio as a career because it was the only thing he had for entertainment growing up. “We couldn’t afford cable when I was younger, so everything from news to entertainment, I got it from the radio.”\n\nHe says, “I counter the argument that radio is dying by explaining and showing them radio is still entertaining and dope. Plus you can win things every day, unlike other mediums that just play music.”\n\nMiKeith says that for managers and executives in radio to be able to recruit more young and talented people, they need to be more understanding and flexible.\n\nAnd he adds that he would like to see the industry as a whole keep up with what’s hip and trending.\n\nPARKER Age: 28 Mornings/APD/Imaging Director WNDD (Wind FM)/Gainesville-Ocala North Central Florida Media Group 6 years in radio\n\nParker tells Radio Ink he was inspired to get into radio by a show he was listening to. “I loved listening to Dave and Chuck the Freak on WRIF every morning on my commute, and it just sort of hit me one ride home: these are real people, they live in my city, this is their job, they love what they do every day — why can’t that be me?\n\n“Eventually, I made a date to tour Specs Howard [School of Media Arts] and fell absolutely in love. I never wanted to leave. Being in a studio felt so comfortable. Radio has become my expressive outlet. There was always a part of me growing up that didn’t like who I was. I wanted to ‘be someone different.’ I’m naturally a very shy and introverted person, and this medium has allowed me to break out of my shell.”\n\nWhen people he knows tell him radio is a dying medium, here’s what Parker says to them. “It would be dead already. After TV, the Internet, now that streaming and podcasting have become more popular than ever, if radio were dying, it would most definitely be dead already. Yes, there is a ton more competition, but that just means a lot more work for those of us who want to succeed. Several morning shows and personalities I personally follow have found their own way to stay relevant and impactful during this age. It can be done, it just takes a lot more effort and a lot of work utilizing different platforms to complement and enhance the on-air brand.”\n\nWhat can the radio industry do better, according to someone under the age of 30? “We need to be better at being authentic and making a real impact on people’s lives. It’s one thing to make people smile or laugh during a break or to get a few solid calls on a particular segment, but there needs to be more of a commitment to make that connection outside of the airwaves. There’s a morning show I listen to out of South Florida, and when Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas, their morning crew raised $200,000 for the local community. Talk about making an impact.\n\n“People pick up on authenticity. It’s easy to tell when someone is fake or insincere. It’s very important, now more than ever, to relate to people on a much deeper level. I feel like too many shows out there are ‘yuk yuk, something’s funny, let’s laugh,’ and that’s the bit. Not everything in life is funny or happy — as much as we all would like it to be, it’s not. Being my authentic self has helped me nourish a genuine connection with the listener.”\n\nJOSE QUINTERO Age: 30 Producer/On-Air Talent KLLI (Cali 93.9FM)/Los Angeles Meruelo Media 5 years in radio\n\nJose Quintero tells Radio Ink that from a young age, he knew he wanted to work in entertainment, but didn’t know in which industry. “It wasn’t until I had the opportunity to go on air for a small segment in a station in Mexico that I felt I was really able to connect to listeners,” he says. “The mind is a beautiful tool, and as a radio host you try your best to paint a picture for whoever is listening. As a theater nerd, the idea of the theater of the mind fascinated me, so I stuck to it.”\n\nWhen people tell him radio is old school, a thing of the past, here’s what he tells them. “I think for the most part everyone lives a specific routine. Radio brings spontaneity to people’s lives, it allows for you to be surprised, to laugh, to cry, to think, to debate — you really don’t know what’s next. That is why there is still a huge market for radio. People long for human interaction, and radio is the bridge that allows that energy between the host and the listener.”\n\nQuintero would like to see more radio opportunities for the younger generation. “From the promotions team to programming to talent — having a network of aspiring professionals where they can learn, grow, and execute. Making the pipeline to these roles easier and better equipped.”\n\nCASSANDRA REIMOLD Age: 28 Regional Digital Campaign Specialist Salem Media Group Pittsburgh 5 years in radio\n\nEven though Cassandra Reimold works as a digital campaign specialist, the importance of radio is always on her mind. “While my focus is more on the digital realm, I always try to teach businesses the importance of integrated campaigns,” she says. “I’m a firm believer in ‘Radio drives the search that feeds digital campaigns.’ This is a motto I take to every meeting I have with a media strategist or business owner. I believe in using the knowledge I’ve been taught and passing that along to my teams in hopes they will also find the value it’s brought to me and my clients.”\n\nOn finding younger people to work in radio, she says, “My advice to managers or executives would be to find someone who is teachable and eager to learn, and invest your time into them. Some of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned in this industry have come from leadership and hearing their stories. I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for the managers who recognized my potential. I feel young and talented people are receptive to learning, and if you can find individuals with that same level of dedication, they’re worth the time.”\n\nAbout what radio can do better, Reimold says, “I would like to see the radio industry get better at using their own resources to promote themselves, whether that be using social media or their digital assets. We’ve gotten away from the very thing we teach to businesses, and that’s using marketing to grow your brand, or in this case, audience. I believe marketing ourselves in the same way we help our clients will be key as we look to the future of this industry.”\n\nBRANDON RENICK Age: 25 Sales Operations Manager Audacy New York 3 years in radio\n\nBrandon Renick manages and maintain Salesforce for the Audacy New York sales team of nearly 50 account executives. He also oversees six sales assistants, one project manager, and one national sales assistant. His job is to ensure that local management and the sales team are set up for success.\n\nTo counter the argument that radio is a dying medium, Renick says, “There is an intimacy and an accessibility to radio that I don’t think you get from television or social media. Listeners form genuine long-lasting connections with personalities or with the music they hear on their favorite stations. Radio is still the number one reach medium in the United States. I think that statistic speaks for itself.”\n\nRenick’s advice to the industry on how to recruit more young people? Emphasize that a career in radio isn’t just one thing. “There are a lot of avenues for growth. The industry is becoming increasingly digital-focused, and radio is now synonymous with streaming, podcasting, and digital marketing. Radio companies also put on some of the best live events in the country.”\n\nCOURTNEY REUKAUF Age: 25 Director of Marketing & Content ESPN West Palm (ESPN 106.3 FM, Deportes 760 AM) West Palm Beach 3.5 years in radio\n\nCourtney Rekauf says radio chose her. “Throughout college, I took a few sports management and marketing classes and fell in love. I decided to apply for a job with the Green Bay Packers, who offered me a position that I ultimately turned down. The experience interviewing with the Packers made me realize how much I loved sports. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin La Crosse, jobless, before finally finding the partnership coordinator position at ESPN Madison (100.5 ESPN).”\n\nRekauf tells Radio Ink that her friends enjoy Sports Talk. “They all prefer Sports Talk radio because it has variety, and it’s the perfect thing to listen to before heading to the big game!” she says. “Most of the listening is done in short spurts in the car, which is why I think podcasting is so important to our local shows. Give the fans small, digestible pieces that they can listen to whenever and wherever they want. It doesn’t limit our radio audience but rather widens it.”\n\nRekauf says radio is not dead — audio keeps it alive. “I like to say that audio is an evolving, not dying, medium. Between livestreaming, podcasts, and social media, there are so many new ways that fans can consume our content! I also think our sales successes and testimonials prove that audio works and isn’t dead. We have fan testimonials where they recite commercials word-for-word, our partners see new leads and business generation from our endorsers, and partners continue to invest with us year after year.”\n\nCARLY ROSS Age: 27 Brand Manager and Morning Show Co-Host Rochester, Minnesota Townsquare Media 4 years in radio\n\nCarly Ross says she always thought she was going to be a businessperson and that she would be just a fan of radio; it was something fun she got to participate in while in college. “I’m so glad JB Wilde reached out to me when he had an available position about four years ago,” she says. “I decided to apply because radio has always been so fun for me, so why not do it full-time? Never think that the hobby you love to do can’t be your career.”\n\nWhat does Ross hear about radio from her peers? “Some people my age still listen to radio, but many tell me that they listen to podcasts or Spotify instead. That’s why it’s so important for radio to stay relevant on all sorts of platforms (like social media and via podcasts), not just the car radio. It’s also important to have local personalities on the radio, not just DJs that fill time between songs. People want that personal connection that only a local radio personality is able to give. It’s the reason listeners keep coming back to their favorite station.”\n\nAnd here’s how she counters the “Radio is dead” argument. “Just looking at the numbers will tell you that’s not true. As long as radio continues to adapt to the changing times, we will continue to thrive. We need to be engaging with our listeners on their phones via our station apps and the social media platforms our listeners use. As long as we’re able to adapt, radio won’t be going anywhere.”\n\nAnd finally, Ross says radio can get better by hiring young, local, diverse talent and being open to new ideas.\n\nKELSEY SAUERS Age: 25 APD/Afternoon Personality KEWB/Redding, California Brewer Broadcasting 2 years in radio\n\nKelsey Sauers tells Radio Ink she was always told she should be paid to talk — and here she is. “I remember wanting some experience in college to put on my resume, and I stumbled upon a sheet wanting student news reporters for the campus radio station,” she says. “When I walked in, I saw a kid talking on a mic and found out he was doing his own show, and I immediately was enticed and asked how I could do that. I was able to do a studentrun hour segment for the station called Radio A La Carte. I was able to play my own music, just no Top 40 hits. I started to plan and prep for my show daily to create an engaging show for our listeners. I fell in love and knew it was something I wanted to continue.”\n\nSauers says there will always be those who say radio is a dying medium, and notes that there is some truth to the statement. “However, with younger and younger radio hosts joining the profession, I truly believe radio will continue to be a growing profession. Radio is less of a dying medium and more of an evolving medium. Radio is always changing with the changing world. In the days of having Spotify, Apple Music, and more at the touch of a hand, radio continues to evolve to keep listener engagement.\n\n“Radio is the only medium that still offers that live engagement aspect that other streaming services simply do not offer. We can connect and chat with listeners in real time. We are in that moment with you and where you are. The relatability and realness of radio will never die.”\n\nLAUREN “LO” SESSIONS Age: 30 APD/MD/Afternoons KTFM (Energy 94.1)/San Antonio Alpha Media 9 years in radio\n\nLauren Sessions tells Radio Ink college helped her choose radio as a career. “I chose radio because I was failing all of my science classes in college (LOL, kidding!). But honestly, that’s a true story. While I was attending the University of South Florida, I was having the typical ‘what do I want to do with my life?’ crisis. I hated all of my classes. School wasn’t fun anymore. I saw a Facebook page promoting internships for a local radio show, Ratboy & Staypuf, and I thought, ‘Well, I love that radio station. I love music and I might have a chance to meet some local DJs. Why not?’ I absolutely loved it.”\n\nThat experience gave her some good mentors. “I got a lot of my mentorship from The Ratboy & Staypuf Show when I was interning and working in Florida. They taught me how to be a ‘talent’ and to always stay true to myself, because being authentic in this business is the most important thing.”\n\nSessions hears a lot of different things when she talks to people her age. “Honestly, it’s a mixed bag,” she says. “A majority of my friends listen to the radio and still love it. Some days I tell people I meet that I work in radio, and the first response is, ‘Oh, I don’t listen to the radio.’ Then there are days where people know everything and anything about every radio station in town. The one thing I can say that people my age know and agree about traditional radio is that it’s free.”\n\nThe “cost” of radio, in Sessions’ mind, goes the distance in dispelling the myth that radio is dying. “It’s simple, and I mentioned it above: the counterargument is that it’s free. Another counter: if radio is a dying medium, why are streaming services re-creating the concept on their platforms while using current and previous radio personalities to host the shows? I don’t feel the medium of radio is dying, I think the prehistoric idea of what radio is, is slowly but surely fading away.”\n\nFAITH SPEAKS Age: 22 Graphic Designer and Social Media Manager Forcht Broadcasting Somerset, Kentucky 2 years in radio\n\nFaith Speaks tells Radio Ink the radio industry chose her, and she loves it. “I am a graphic designer, so I wasn’t necessarily seeking out the radio industry,” she says. “But now it’s hard to imagine it any other way. I’m so grateful to have such supportive and knowledgeable colleagues and to be a part of the radio industry.”\n\nTo recruit more young talent, Speaks says it’s important for radio to not focus only on sales, but to remember to be involved in the community. “The fun of radio comes from the interaction between the station and the listeners. A good show host, the appearances at events or local businesses, and the music are what bring listeners back.”\n\nAnd she’d like to see the radio industry educate more on the digital side. “While digital is growing and ever-present today, it is still relatively new to the radio industry. It can be overwhelming to tackle, but digital is vital to maximizing the reach of radio to your intended audience and beyond.”\n\nGARRETT STOLT Age: 29 Vice President, Sales iHeartMedia Multi-Platform Group Atlanta 5 years in radio\n\nGarrett Stolt says he likes the daily challenge of building relationships. “The community is the lifeline to local radio stations, and somewhere along the line, some in our industry have forgotten the importance of that. I try to build my relationship with the city of Atlanta and make change in the community each and every day. My job is to develop true partnerships with leaders of this community and provide our medium as a platform to better Atlanta.”\n\nThose partnerships, in his mind, are something radio needs to pay more attention to. “True partnerships is something that we can all be better at. Are we a for-profit business? Of course, but sometimes it takes going the extra mile for your partner to create new opportunities!”\n\nHe goes on, “The biggest thing I hear from people my age is, ‘I don’t listen to the radio.’ That’s the biggest misconception with who I associate with. It’s not that they’re not listening to the radio, but how they’re consuming it. No longer are we using our parents’ boombox or that giant stereo system we got as a kid. It’s all through our Airpods, smartphones, and our smart home speaker devices.”\n\nStolt says, despite the challenges and the misconception that radio is dead, he’s happy he chose radio as a career. “For me, it was the bright lights of showbiz. Whenever that On Air sign lights up and those mics turn on, we have the ears of millions of listeners. The way we’re able to connect with the community and provide that trusted source of information and entertainment is the real reason I love doing my job every single day.”\n\nDAKOTA WOODS Age: 29 Chief Revenue Officer/Market President Townsquare Media Lawton, Oklahoma 4 years in radio\n\nThe music is what brought Dakota Woods into the radio industry. “Music is the main reason why I was always a fan of local radio,” he says. “I grew up in the Lawton, Oklahoma, area listening to the local stations where I work now. I remember as a kid during the summer months, going to work with my dad listening to Bob and Tom during the morning drive on KZCD [Rock Z94] all the time!”\n\nAt 29, he says the biggest moment in his career was landing his current job. “Becoming the chief revenue officer/market president at Townsquare Media/Lawton. This was a massive step for me in my career. You don’t see many young CROs in any media company. One of the most rewarding things about my role in the company is the support I have from my management team. I’m truly grateful for their knowledge and leadership.”\n\nHe is also grateful for his mentor. “A great friend and one of the best mentors I’ve ever had is Jared Story. If you want to learn the true meaning of ‘Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard,’ spend a week working with this guy! Jared never gave up on me during my troubled youth and always told me I could do great things in my life if I worked hard and gave my best effort every day. He invested more than just eight hours a day with me, he invested part of his life with me, and I’m forever grateful for Jared and his family.”\n\nFor radio to thrive in the future, Woods says, “Be the Swiss army knife in your marketplace for listeners. I think we need to plan for the future and embrace how people consume radio. With news, sports, podcasting, streaming, and terrestrial radio being consumed constantly, we need to become more of a one-stop shop for all of these things so we can appeal to all listeners.”"
