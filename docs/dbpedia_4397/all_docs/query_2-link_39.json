        "text": "On January 4, 2022, Ryan began hosting The Ryan Gorman Show, airing weekday mornings on NewsRadio WFLA and via the iHeartRadio app. The show breaks down the day's biggest news and trending stories and features interviews with national, state, and local newsmakers, analysts, and experts. The show combines entertainment and information with a style and approach that appeals to a broad audience, regardless of one's political persuasion. Ryan also hosts iHeartRadio Communities, a national show running on nearly every iHeartRadio station, dedicated to highlighting the people and organizations working to make a positive difference in communities across the country. In addition to those two shows, Ryan hosts national coverage of elections and major news events for iHeartRadio news/talk affiliates and contributes to the Daytime TV show on the local Tampa NBC affiliate.\n\nRyan’s radio career started at 16 while he was still in high school. He began interning at the legendary pop music station WFLZ-FM (93-3 FLZ) in Tampa, FL, and became an afternoon talk show host at a small station, WWJB-AM, in Brooksville, FL.\n\nAfter Ryan graduated high school, he went on to study political science and history at the University of South Florida while continuing to work at 93-3 FLZ. He quickly rose from intern to weekend talent to the late-night show host. He also became an on-air talent for the cities largest Alternative station, STAR 95.7. In addition to his 93-3 FLZ and STAR work, he hosted USF’s top college radio show on WBUL-AM, where he focused on politics and coverage of the 2004 Presidential election.\n\nIn May 2005, Ryan left the University of South Florida and 93-3 FLZ to take a job as the Night Show Host and Music Director for WFKS-FM (97-9 KISSFM) in Jacksonville, FL. During his time at 97-9 KISSFM, he helped the station reach record ratings in both his day-part and overall. He continued to host his highly rated night show until January 2007, when he accepted a position as Morning Show Co-Host on WKSS-FM (KISS 95-7) in Hartford, CT.\n\nWhile he was Morning Show Co-Host, he helped improve the show's ratings, reaching new highs in listenership and web traffic, and received the Best Morning Show award from the Hartford Advocate. He also led a petition, garnering over 20,000 signatures, to stop the state's gas tax increase. The petition was brought to the state legislature floor and led to the increase proposal being voted down, saving state taxpayers from paying even more at the pump.\n\nIn July 2008, Ryan added Afternoon Talk Show Host duties for 960 WELI-AM in New Haven, CT, and his morning show co-host job. During this time, he lent his insight into the 2008 Presidential elections while interviewing prominent local, state, and national political figures, including the Governor of Connecticut and a U.S. Senator.\n\nIn May 2009, Ryan returned to his home state of Florida and accepted the position of Afternoon Show Host at WFKS-FM (97-9 KISSFM) in Jacksonville, FL. In addition to his show, he ran the day-to-day operations of the radio station.\n\nFinally, in October 2010, Ryan accepted the position of Afternoon Show Host at WKSC-FM (103-5 KISSFM) in Chicago, IL. Ryan’s show quickly became the highest-rated afternoon show in the station's history, going #1 in all demos for four consecutive quarters. Plus, for 2012, Ryan finished #1 in all key demos for the entire year. His show continued to be the most-listened-to radio show in Chicago, consistently averaging over 1 million listeners per week. In February 2012, Ryan was promoted to Assistant Program Director of WKSC-FM, where he helped in the day-to-day operations of the radio station. He also hosted The Weekly Show, a half-hour talk show each week dedicated to covering all things Illinois in addition to interviewing the biggest names in music and news. The Weekly Show aired on WKSC-FM, WLIT-FM, and WBEG-FM each weekend in Chicago."
