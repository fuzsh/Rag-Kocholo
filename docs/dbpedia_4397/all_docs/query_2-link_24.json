        "text": "Originally Posted by Hockeyice\n\n93.3 FLZ - Seems to be the most popular radio station here, and many young people like it. However, it is not my favorite radio station. They play some songs I like, but they also play a good majority of songs I absolutely can not stand. This station is mainly the new, mainstream music. I probably listen to this station 10% of the time.\n\n94.9 Magic - This is a mix of new mainstream songs, and old songs (from the 90s, 80s, etc.). It is mostly new songs, though. It plays a variety of different genres of music. I probably listen to this station 10% of the time.\n\n97.1 X - This station plays rock songs. Mainly just the newer rock songs. Pretty good station. I recommend it. I probably listen to this station 25% of the time.\n\n97.9 Rock - This station is very similar to 97.1. It plays basically newer rock songs. However, they just don't play as many rock songs I like as 97.1 does. However, different people like different songs, so if you like rock songs, don't tune this station out. Give it a shot. I probably listen to this station 5% of the time.\n\n98.7 Play - Their slogan probably describes themselves the best: \"Today's best hits without the rap.\" This is my favorite station, and I like a very high majority of the songs they play. I probably listen to this 30% of the time.\n\n100.7 Mix - Pretty much just like 94.9. Variety music from all different time periods, but mostly just newer music. Good station. I probably listen to this station 15% of the time."
