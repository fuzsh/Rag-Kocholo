        "text": "HENRY FONDA puts in a long, hard winter out there on the Western plains in \"Welcome to Hard Times,\" which opened at the Festival yesterday.Here he is, stuck in this burned-out hamlet that looks a lot like the one in \"Shane\" before it is busted up and set afire by a passing badman, Aldo Ray; virtually without companions, except for Keenan Wynn with a wagonload of girls he is hopelessly trying to hustle, a 12-year-old boy, and Janice Rule.And, worst of all, he has to sit there and listen to the tireless taunting of Miss Rule, who assuses him of being a coward because he didn't step right up like Alan Ladd and shoot the badman when he was on his destructive rampage.Well, anyone who knows Mr. Fonda — and certainly most of us do—can see exactly why he didn't shoot him, as he might easily have done. He didn't shoot him because the script wouldn't let him, it being one of those arbitrary things in which the middle-aged man (they call him the mayor) is supposed to be more prudent than bold.That isn't at all convincing, because at any one of several points, while Mr. Ray is breaking windows and setting roaring around the hamlet, buildings on fire, even I, with a .22 rifle, could have got him. Certainly Mr. Fonda could. Burt Kennedy, who wrote the screenplay and directed, taxes credulity here.But I think a much better reason for Mr. Fonda's not shooting Mr. Ray is because he is fascinated and hypnotized by the performance the latter gives. I would guess, in all his times in Western movies, Mr. Fonda has never seen a more wild and implausible badman than this jughead whom Mr. Ray plays. Not only does he knock the tops off bottles instead of pulling out the corks when he wants to guzzle a couple of quarts of whisky (that's a standard badman ploy), but he ravishes bar girls, shoots his own horse and guns down Elisha Cook Jr. with even more cold-blooded arrogance than Jack Palance did in \"Shane.\" (Mr. Cook seems to be a favorite target for itchy-fingered gunmen in Western films.)Anyhow, I would guess that Mr. Fonda may have felt the same way I did: let this kook have his head. He's crazy, man! We'll get him the next time he comes around.And he does, of course. But, in the meantime, there's that winter of terrible discontent, with the wind howling, Mr. Wynn's girls whimpering, and Miss Rule taunting him for being a coward. I suppose it would have been unendurable for Mr. Fonda, if he hadn't been told he was doing it for the sake of Art—for the sake of a different Western, which Mr. Kennedy evidently meant it to be.It's different, all right. It's listless, haphazard, and there isn't a single person in it with whom you're made to identify. Not even Mr. Fonda, who walks through it drearily. Miss Rule is surly and obnoxious, and an Irish brogue doesn't do her a bit of good. The best things about it are the settings and the color photography.Incidentally, Hard Times is the name of the hamlet, in case you haven't guessed. It is also the name of what this picture gives the audience.\n\nThe CastWELCOME TO HARD TIMES, screenplay and directed by Burt Kennedy, based on a novel by E. L. Doctorow; prdouced by Max E.
