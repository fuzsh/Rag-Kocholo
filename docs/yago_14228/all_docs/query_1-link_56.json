        "text": "\"I got figuring something the other day. To make good, you don't have to be smart all your life. You only have to be smart for about ten seconds, that's all.\"\n\nMarried couple Chet (Aldo Ray) and Florrie (Judy Holliday) sit in divorce court before Judge Anne B. Carroll (Madge Kennedy) who gets them to talk at length about their relationship in the belief that it will get them to remain together.\n\nThe film is structured as a series of flashbacks punctuated by contemporary reactions of the couple and judge in the present. Since the events unfold in a largely linear order, some of the more impactful moments of the marriage that represent real inflection points don't have quite the…\n\nI went into this one thinking it was a romantic comedy... it’s not. It’s actually quite sad! But very good. Judy Holliday was absolutely wonderful here, and I was impressed with Aldo Ray, too. I’d never seen anything with him before. (He was a cutie!)\n\nIt’s about a couple on the brink of divorce who are looking back on their marriage, trying to figure it all out. So many quotes that stuck with me:\n\n“You don’t seem to remember anything and when you do you remember it all wrong.”\n\n“The kind of love they got in books and movies that’s not for people, you’ve gotta be more realistic.”\n\n“Well I always thought if I ever got married the one thing…\n\nHere is the first of five Cukor posts—a director whose qualities seem to vary somewhat radically depending on his time in Hollywood. Sarris’s original take on him in American Cinema tends to be a bit reductive. Kent Jones comments, “Cukor at his best, which covers about 90% of his career, is never less than vibrantly alive to textures, behaviors, rhythms, moods, emotional tones. His career offers ample proof that there are numerous varieties of consistency apart from thematic, and that movies “move” in many different ways. In Cukor’s case it has to do with staging, always with a keen understanding of the frame.” While his films I think are perhaps defined in narrative mostly by romance (which is to say,…\n\nThere are plenty of 1950s films about the false promise of postwar middle class prosperity and consumerism, but not many reverberate with the sadness of this one. Though it does have comic elements (mostly in the first third but recurring in strange additions like Ray’s stress-induced hustle culture nightmares), but even then this is a shockingly modern depiction of just how depressing it is on one’s soul to try to do more than merely subsist and to dream of any possible escape route from the rat race of living to work. Cukor is surprisingly hands off throughout, leaving plenty of literal space for his actors to work through the subtle and the explosive angst of their characters. Probably the closest…\n\nAside from some early walk-ons, Judy Holliday made just eight films, but her name still endures today due to the second of them, a rom-com par excellence by the name of Born Yesterday, for which she won the 1950 Best Actress Oscar.\n\nHalf of the eight were scripted by Garson Kanin, an erratic but talented screenwriter and director who often worked in partnership with his wife, part-time character actor Ruth Gordon. Holliday had torn up the screen as a nervy, murderous wife in Adam's Rib, starred in Kanin's Born Yesterday on stage and screen, and would go on to appear in It Should Happen to You, a superlative satire that triples up as an affecting romance and knockout comedy.\n\nThe…"
