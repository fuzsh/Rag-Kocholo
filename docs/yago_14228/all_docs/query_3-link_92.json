        "text": "It is with heartfelt sorrow that the family of Kenneth Ian O’Donnell husband of Minerva (Loggie) O’Donnell, announce his sudden passing on Wednesday, November 15, 2023, at the Saint John Regional Hospital.\n\nBorn in Newcastle, NB on August 14, 1949, Ian was a son of the late Beverley and Alice (Ingram) O’Donnell. He was employed as an Instrumentation Technician with Heath Steele Mines, then Potacan Mining Company, Cassidy Lake, New Brunswick for several years. In 1998, he and Minerva moved to Amherstburg, ON, where he worked for Honeywell before retiring in 2014, and moving back to Rothesay in 2016. Ian was a long-standing member of the Valley Cruisers Car Club He liked nothing better than to go for a cruise with Minerva in their 1964 Galaxie 500XL and was proud of the car, a 56 Ford Fairlane, that he was in the process of restoring for Minerva. Ian was also a member of the Hampton and Windsor Curling Clubs. He enjoyed travelling. Much like his life, their trips were planned with a focus first on the journey rather than the destination with a highly researched itinerary of waypoints driven by the food adventure of the day!\n\nIan is survived by loving wife Minerva of 36 years, as well as his sons; Gary Sullivan (Tanya) of Darlings Island, and Robert Sullivan (April) of Hampton, daughters; Cindy Matthews (Jeff) of Kingston, and Bev Burhoe (John) of Upham, brother John (Jean) of Moncton, grandchildren; Jodie and Evan Sullivan, Emma and Bennett Sullivan, Taylor and Jon Matthews (Paige), and Brooke and Hailey Burhoe, as well as several nieces, nephews, and extended family. Ian will be missed by many, especially close friends Harold and Marilyn Duplacey. Ian and Harold shared many interests such as antique cars and car racing. This led to many memorable trips and stories.\n\nIan was predeceased by his parents, and his son Michael Sullivan."
