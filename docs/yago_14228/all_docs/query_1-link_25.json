        "text": "The simple domestic problems of a young married couple in New York—he a postoffice worker and she an ex-secretary—have been treated with cheerfulnees and wisdom in the clever and facile script Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin have written for Columbia's \"The Marrying Kind.\" And the wonderfully fluent talents of that grand actress, Judy Holliday, and an equally potent new actor by the name of Aldo Ray have been put by Director George Cukor to the incarnation of this script into what will undoubtedly stand up as one of the happiest entertainments of the year. It had its opening performance at the Victoria yesterday.Think it not curious if we don't seem to be as side-splittingly impressed with the hilarities in this picture as its promotion might lead you to expect. Hilarity is in it—hilarity of the best—as would be almost mandatory in any picture with Miss Holliday. But the charming and lastingly affecting thing about \"The Marrying Kind\" is its bittersweet comprehension of the thorniness of the way that stretches out for two young people after they have taken the marriage vows.Thorniness isn't apparent at the start, we'll concede—and that's a cue not alone to the pattern of this picture but to the realism of its view. The present is full of sunshine as our two young people meet in Central Park and, before they know it—he, at least—are saying, \"I do.\" It is also loaded with laughter when they light up their first private home—an apartment in Peter Cooper Village—and start being man and wife.There is even hilarity in their squabbling over such a ridiculous thing as his getting tight at a party and paying too much attention to a blonde. And humor, less strident but tender, is in their confusion and dismay when a radio jackpot-show calls them and dangles that bright, elusive prize.But \"The Marrying Kind\" is not so funny when tragedy strikes the little home and a good bit of mutual understanding and sacrifice are required. And it is in this phase of the story that Miss Gordon and Mr. Kanin have conveyed the poignancy of frustrations that make marriage so challenging. It is here that they prove their moral—that the natural and ever-hopeful chase after glittering, material ambitions is a wistful and endless dream.Although the form of the picture is a good bit on the obvious side, with the two frustrated spouses telling their story to a judge, Miss Gordon and Mr. Kanin have made it most palatable by wittily having the narrator tell a different story from that which is played on the screen. Thus when the husband tells his story of how he met his future wife, the facts as he narrates them are not entirely in accord with what is shown. \"It so happens I remember it different,\" Miss Holliday primly says.Also the rather sharp transition from the hilarity of gentle farce to the tension of sober drama may be a bit abrupt for easy assimilation, but the development is sound and the contrast in mood and comprehension elevates the significance of the film.Naturally, everybody is eagerly anxious to know how well Miss Holliday's performance stands up with her one in \"Born Yesterday.\" Have no dread on that score. Her portrayal of an average New York girl—a girl who makes her marriage resolution, \"I'm gonna think a half-hour every day,\" to the utter bewilderment of her mother, who wants to know what she's going to think about—is beautifully textured and colored with expressions, modulations of voice and a good bit more outgive of emotion than was evident in her other role.But the big surprise of this picture is the talent of Mr. Ray in presenting a richly appealing and naturally complicated young man. Not handsome but sturdy in appearance, and possessed of a melting, husky voice, he has a gift for flowing humor and straight-faced pathos that is almost beyond belief. His winning performance of the husband is a great factor in this film.Under Mr. Cukor's fine direction, others turn in superb performances, too—Madge Kennedy as the judge, John Alexander as a wealthy brother-in-law, Mickey Shaughnessy as another in-law, Rex Williams as a friend and many more. The colorful performance of I much of the exterior work in New York enhances the happy illusion of actuality.This reviewer has fond recollections of King Vidor's old film, \"The Crowd,\" which was also about the frustrations of a young married couple in New York. \"The Marrying Kind\" compares to it, and that's the nicest compliment we can pay.\n\nTHE MARRYING KIND, written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin; directed by George Cukor; produced by Bert Granet for Columbia Pictures.

Elsie HolmesThe first third of \"Marry Me,\" a J. Arthur Rank import that was quietly ushered into the downtown Art Theatre yesterday, is a delight to watch. The ticklish subject of a commercial marriage bureau, with its practical conniving and lonely customers, would seem to be a natural for the restrained penetration of the British trademark.In this Betty E. Box production, Terrence Fisher has directed an excellent cast in four varying vignettes of successful and unsuccessful romance as arranged by a pair of spinsters operating a \"respectable business\" in London. But though there is talent on all sides, the film as a whole is a disappointingly contrived package job. It has none of the slickness of a recent Hollywood go at the subject, \"The Model and the Marriage Broker,\" a much better all-around effort, but little of the latter's conviction.The episodes are linked smoothly enough by a brash young reporter's research for a syndicated expose. This eager beaver, played by David Tomlinson, gets paired off with a day-dreaming waitress, Carol Marsh, who poses as a debutante. The second brackets Derek Bond, a business man, and Zena Marshall, a desperate French refugee, who are presently menaced by the lady's vengeful criminal lover. The third, and most provocative, concerns a handsome couple, Susan Shaw and Patrick Holt, who turn out to be a night club hostess and a village clergyman. And the best, involving Guy Middleton, Nora Swinburne and Denis O'Dea drolly tells how a galvanized bachelor swipes a schoolmarm from his butler, and rates inclusion in one of the Somerset Maugham showcases.The dialogue is persuasive and the performances are excellent throughout, including those of Jean Cadell and Mary Jerrold, the marriage \"brokers,\" and Brenda Bruce, Miss Shaw's stand-by.However, Scenarists Dennis Waldock and Lewis Gilbert have blunted their ingenious stories with some melodramatic and whimsical resolutions. Terrence Fisher's direction is strictly assembly-line. And whoever dreamed up one merciless scene squelching the hopes of a sweet-faced spinster should be filed away under Z. Without accomplishing much else, \"Marry Me\" succeeds in casually raking the exposed human heart with some civilized spurs.\n\nMARRY ME, screen play by Dennis Waldock and Lewis Gilbert; directed by Terence Fisher; produced by Betty E.
