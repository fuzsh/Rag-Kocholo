        "text": "This is a 1955 Lydia Lane article where actress Jeff Donnell talks about a bunch of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nI first met Jeff Donnell during the war, She was a blonde then, and under contract to Columbia. “I want very happy with my career at the tune,” she told me on the set at NBO the other day. “The publicity men had me posing on leopard skins, trying to make a glamour girl out of me. I never kidded myself. All I wanted was lo make people laugh, not compete with the beauty queens. I’m a home body, like simple things and have never felt very comfortable ‘in sophisticated clothes. I admire them on models but I know they are not for me. I’m happiest in simple, basic dresses. My favorite is a plain nay blue with a white peter-pan collar. “I firmly believe it’s a mistake for a woman to go against what she feels is her type,” she said seriously.\n\n“But even if you didn’t go for the glamor routine, being under contract to the studio might have taught you how to improve your appearance,” I commented. “That’s true,” Jeff agreed. “I learned that eye make-up is flattering to me. The make up men pointed out that the eyes need some accent when a vibrant shade of lipstick i used, otherwise all the attention will be drawn to the lower part of the face. “I have a unique trick for doing up my eyes.” Jeff confided. “I use a match, a saucer and a fine paint brush. You light the match,” she explained, “put the saucer over it until the bottom is black with carbon and then use the carbon to paint a fine line close to your lashes. This is more doable than a pencil and gives a softer and more natural effect.”\n\n“I find this method more convenient because I always get quite a line keeping a sharp point on a soft eyebrow pencil. I’ve always been careful not to extend the line in doe-eyed fashion because my face is round. “Try this on one eye,” Jeff advised, “and compare it with the other. You’ll be surprised what this little bit of accent doe, even though it’s so subtle no one would know it was there. “I’m not a pretty girl but I’ve always been interested in enhancing good features without fretting about the things I couldn’t change. I’ve found that being interesting, well informed and friendly have taken me a long way. In fact,” Jeff concluded. “I think the ugly ducklings who work at developing personality and individuality often go farther than the pretty girl who feels that her looks are all she needs and is foolish enough to rest on her laurels.”\n\nThis is a 1955 Lydia Lane article where ballerina Moira Shearer talks about a bunch of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nMoira Shearer, the beautiful and talented ballerina of “Red Shoes,” confided to me some time ago during a tour that”A Midsummer Night’s Dream” was her swan song as far as the-ballet was concerned, although she had not’yet made a formal announcement. “I am not retiring from the theater.” she explained. “I enjoy making pictures and hope to continue, but the ballet is too demanding now that I have a family. After my baby was born, I found that in order to get back to where I left off, I’d have to work strenuously for six months. The ballet requires ‘tremendous control, discipline and concentration and I no longer desire that kind of dedication,” Moira told me in her suite at the Ambassador Hotel.\n\n“Ballet dancers look fragile but they have to train like boxers -and have the same kind of stamina. “We eat energy foods like tartar steak, the yolks of raw eggs and lots of honey. A few hours before going on stage I always drink the yolks of two eggs mixed with honey and lemon.” Moira was wearing a soft blue dressing gown which she tied around her tiny waist. “What does your waist measure?” I asked her. “Twenty – two indies — without lacing,” she replied. “I think having good firm muscles made it easier for me to get back in shape after the baby came. Ballet is a wonderful body conditioner. ‘I recommend it for anyone who’leads a sedentary life. Besides being wonderful exercise, it develops grace,”\n\nMoira gave me her favorite exercise for keeping her waistline trim when she isn’t dancing. Here it is just as she demonstrated for me. Sit on the floor close enough to a walls so you can rest the soles of your feet against it, making a 45 degree angle with legs straight. Now try to lie down, lowering your spine to the floor, one vertebra at a time. The idea is to get your back flat against the floor without removing your feet from the wall. As you go down, stretch your arms above your head. This helps to release spinal tension. Moira agreed that this not an easy exercise and it. will require working with before you can do it to a steady rhythm but its benefits are three-fold. It reduces the waist, flattens the stomach and helps you relax.\n\nMoira has traveled many times across our continent and observed Americans in every section of the country. She has a great admiration for the fashion sense of the American women and admits that we are much better dressed than the Europeans. “Even the women on limited budgets manage to look very smart,” Moira said, “but I find ‘ that in following fashion they seem to have sacrificed individuality, I’m constantly impressed how much alike the American women seem to look. Personally, I’m more concerned with being different than being in vogue.”\n\n“It’s very easy to fall into a rut about clothes and let others dictate what you should wear but remember that the fashion designers may not be designing for your particular type of figure. Be objective and critical and choose your clothes with discrimination, it isn’t always easy to be honest about yourself but if you are to achieve anything, whether It is success in your career or your personal relationships with people, you must have a true evaluation of yourself,” Moira advised. Moira places a sense of humor high on her list of beauty requisites. “The expression on a woman’s face is equally as important as he shape of the features. If you can laugh-, at yourself and treat trouble in the light perspective, you won’t tear yourself down with worry.”\n\nMoira has the most beautiful red hair I’ve ever seen. “No one ever gives me credit for being a natural redhead,” Moira complained. “I do my hair myself once a week. I think , the right shampoo makes stick a difference, especially with hair as dry as mine,” she added, suggesting that women try different brands. Moira has a typical English complexion — clear and smooth and fresh looking. “The climate In England makes for a good skin. It’s cold over there and we arc used to chilly rooms. It was’difficult for me to get used to the awful central heating in the hotels here. I think the hot, dry air that you are used to in your homes is drying. “With the highly heated rooms in winter and the summer sun, I don’t wonder that your women complain about dry skin so much,” was Moira’s sage observation. Moira also had some definite ideas about make-up. “One has to look natural or it is wrong.” she said. “Too many American women, I think, wear too much make up. Some seem lo think that unless you are overly made – up, you arc not properly made up. I can’t agree with this.”\n\nThis is a 1955 Lydia Lane article where actress Barbara Lawrence talks about beauty for teenagers. Enjoy!\n\nBarbara Lawrence has a coveted role in “Oklahoma” and Is now playing In the brand new Broadway comedy “Put Them All Together.” When I first met her she had just been signed by 20th Century-For. It was during the war and we were going to the soldiers hospital and Barbara was fuming because although she was all of 17, and married, She was still forced to have a school teacher on the set. Just before she left for New York recently, Barbara and I reflected back on those frustrating days. “I couldn’t grow up fast enough,” she admitted. “And because I was tall. I could get away with it- Nothing used to thrill me more than passing myself off as 18 when actually I was several years younger. “But now, even though I’m only 24, people think I am much older because I’ve been in pictures so long.\n\n“My advice to teenagers is don’t try to grow up too fast. They have the rest of their lives to be grownup. Don’t rush the girlish years away. “And don’t be too eager to use makeup,” Barbara continued. “When your complexions arc young and fresh, lip stick is all the makeup you need. Learn to put it on neatly by using a farmhand a brush will help re-shape your mouth if you need to change It. One of my favorite tricks with lipstick is to use a dark shade for outlining and then fill in with a lighter color.” Barbara was wearing a vibrant shade of lipstick and her mouth was an excellent testimonial for the brush method of applying lipstick. “I’ve discovered that lipstick has a way of losing its color.” Barbara continued. “What looks just perfect when you hold your face next to the mirror may not be effective across the room. It’s a good idea to look at your- sell from a distance as well as close up.\n\nBarbara, like so many wise women, doesn’t underestimate the importance of the right attitude toward life and its contribution to beauty. If you allow yourself to be filled with resentment when someone disappoints you, or is rude or unfair, you will undermine your health, your ability to work well and certainly your good looks. “If you can lick inner conflict, you’ll find you have just about everything you need for happiness, health and beauty. “I don’t mean that it’s ever wise to ignore the rules pf good grooming, but what is behind your face is equally as important as what you put on it. Instead of fussing because your parents wont let you go overboard with your make-up,” Barbara concluded wisely, “give some thought to what expression you are going to wear.”\n\nThis is a 1955 Lydia Lane article where actress Lori nelson talks about make-up. Enjoy!\n\nWhen I picked up Lori Nelson at Universal-International to take her to visit the veteran’s hospital, she looked pretty enough to have stepped off the cover of a magazine. “There is no doubt about it,” she said. “Under the guidance of the Hollywood studio, you learn to make the most of everything you have. I was only sixteen when Universal signed me up and I’ve seen myself on the screen. “Don’t you think a series of good photographs would be a good substitute for those who cannot see themselves on a movie screen?” I suggested. Yes. I do.” Lori replied. “You can never look Into a mirror with enough detachment to give a good analysis. “One of my mistakes was that T was inclined to dress too fluffy. The studio recommended a more simple line as being the most effective for me, because of my diminutive size. As soon as I saw myself on the screen, I knew exactly what I was doing wrong and from then on I was able to correct such things myself.”\n\nIt was a bright sunny day and even in the revealing sunlight it was not obvious that Lori was wearing make-up. I’ve learned the art of applying make-up so lightly that it looks perfectly natural,” she told me. “Indeed you have,” I agreed, wanting to know more about this trick she had acquired. “I used a cream base which is exactly the color of my skin. Getting the right shade is very important. I apply it by putting four-dots of the cream on my face-one on my forehead, one on the chin and one on each cheek. I use both hands to spread and work it in well so that it leaves only a light film. Using a liquid rouge makes it easier to blend the color into the base and I use only enough to give the illusion of a natural blush. “I powder over this very lightly, using the shade of powder recommended for my skin tone, and always using a clean puff. You can buy little powder puffs, designed for use just once, so inexpensively that you can well afford to throw them away.\n\n“I brush off the powder to take care of any excess with a soft complexion brush and then apply a tiny bit of powdered rouge over this. I use a rabbit’s foot as a rouge puff.” “Striving for the natural look when putting on your make-up may take a little more time,” Lori concluded, “but the effect is well worth it.”\n\nThis is a 1954 Lydia Lane article where actress Cathy Downs talks about make-up and perfume. Enjoy!\n\nI first met Cathy Downs when she was a contract player at Twentieth Century-Fox. The other day I lunched with her at Republic where she’s now shooting the Joe Palooka series for TV. It was a warmish day and we agreed that it was difficult to realize that New Year’s Eve would be here so shortly. “That’s the glamour night of the year,” I commented. “How are you going to dress for the gala event?” “I think glamour begins by being clean that scrubbed look is the best foundation for beauty. It’s fun to be dramatic,” Cathy said, “but we should not exaggerate it, or it becomes comical. This is the time when you can use more eye make-up than usual but experiment before-hand so you’ll know your most becoming shades of eye-shadow and mascara.”\n\nI wanted to know what type of mascara Cathy favored? “I like the cake type but the important point is to let one coat dry thoroughly before applying another. ‘ ; I “THEY SAY familiarity with your, tools brings perfection and mascara is no exception,” Cathy remarked. “If your brush is too wet your lashes will stick together and if it is too dry it will not achieve the desired affect. I like to use a tiny brush the circular type to go over my lashes so that they are completely separated. If you pencil in a line close to the lashes, draw this with a sharp pointed pencil so that – it is not too heavy. ‘”One important thing about applying lipstick,” Cathy continued, “is to check your lighting.” When in doubt, use a shade with a touch of blue , in it or you’re liable to find your mouth is completely overshadowed.\n\n“When I was a model in New York they told me I must learn to use a lipstick brush. I had to practice for weeks before I could handle one properly. Now I am lost without it. ‘ “What about rouge?” I asked. “I like the dry type and I powder over it. This should be blended in so well that you are not aware of it at all. Where you place your rouge should depend on the shape of your face. It is better not to use any rouge,” Cathy warned, “than to use it carelessly.” “Does perfume enter into your glamour picture?” I asked. “Definitely,” Cathy agreed. “I like to spray it on my skirts, undies and through my hair. When you get a fine mist it doesn’t spot your clothes and gives you an all- over fragrance.\n\nThis is a 1954 Lydia Lane article where actress Barbara Bates talks about dieting and make-up. Enjoy!\n\nBarbara Bates is known to her TV fans as Cathy Morgan in “It’s a Great Life.” When I visited her set at NBC, she was relaxing in a contour chair. “TV has taught me to relax every minute I can,” she told me. As we chatted a man came on the set wheeling a cart of tempting sweets. “Get thee from me,” was Barbara’s reaction. “I have had such trouble keeping thin,” she explained. “I dearly love anything sweet especially chocolate and to say ‘no really takes discipline.”\n\n“But it isn’t healthy to be dieting all the time and letting your weight go up and down is not the right way to go about it. The thing to do is find the weight at which you are comfortable and level off. I keep a check by weighing in every morning and if I’ve gained even a pound, I start cutting down. I have a calorie chart which I carry in my handbag and this helps me limit myself to 500 calories a day until I’m back to normal. But,” she added, knocking on wood, “I haven’t had to diet for quite a while and it’s a wonderful feeling.\n\nI ASKED Barbara to tell me the most useful thing she had learned from. the make-up men. ; “How to put on foundation so that it gives your skin a smooth, even tone without ever looking like make-up,” she replied. “The trick is to use a wet sponge, rub it lightly over a cake of make-up and smooth it quickly over your face and under the thin so as to leave no unblended places. I usually let it dry for about 10 minutes and then with a slightly damp piece of cotton I pat lightly over, the same area. This removes the surface powder but leaves enough color to give my skin a flattering, yet natural look. ”\n\n“I think it’s the exceptional complexion that doesn’t need some make-up but it s better to use nothing than to apply make-up so that it looks obvious. “Subtlety is especially important in eye make-up,’ Barbara continued. Eyebrows should always follow your natural arch and if you fill them out with a- pencil, use feather strokes. A thin, straight line is never flattering. After I have penciled my brows, I brush them to help blend the hairs in the line. For the most natural look, keep trying until you find a pencil which matches your own coloring exactly.”"
