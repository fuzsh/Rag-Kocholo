        "text": "He was in a porn movie in the 1970s when he was a raging alcoholic and his career was in the shitter, but he didn't have any sex scenes in the movie.\n\nHe was hot as hell in his youth and rumored to be hung like a horse.\n\nWas a member of the US Navy's UDT-17. Trained in Hawaii, the team cleared landing beaches of obstacles and coral heads in the Pacific during World War II, and participated in the largest UDT operation of the Pacific War--the invasion of Okinawa, in March 1945. In 1983 the UDTs (Underwater Demolition Teams ) were re-designated as SEAL Teams.\n\nThere's a scene in the Marrying Kind where he has a dream that he's going down a conveyor belt. He's only in his boxer shorts and a t-shirt, and as he goes down the belt, his t-shirt rides up, exposing his hairy torso.\n\nThat scene made me a fan.\n\nWhat I loved about him was his unabashed manliness. Hairy chested in a world of shaven torsos. Raspy voiced in a world of mellifluous tones. Kind of clunky in a world of smooth operators.\n\nKnew a guy years ago who said he grew up in a suburban L.A. neighborhood where Ray was his next door neighbor. Said he kept to himself, but was nice enough. Used to mow his lawn, then sit out with a couple of beers. Normal guy.\n\nR15 It's talked about here. The actual quote from Aldo Ray:\n\n\"George Cukor gave me my big break in this business. He thought I could be a star, and I knew somebody important like him could easily help me, so I let him take his pleasure and it didn't compromise me in the least.\"\n\nLove him but I'd like to say these photos don't really even do him justice. He had a particular manly charisma that really came through best in his early screen appearances. Check him out in Miss Sadie Thompson opposite Rita Hayworth. And God's Little Acre opposite Tina Louise.\n\nSex on a stick as they like to say around here.\n\nStudio sent Aldo Ray to ballet lessons because he walked like a truck driver or something.\n\nJudy Holliday and Aldo Ray were magic in \"The Marrying Kind\". Their respective accents alone conjured a NYC that is long gone now.\n\nI'm a big fan of Nightfall which has Aldo in his medium buff period. There one scene where he stands with his back to the camera and we get a great look at his ass.\n\nR6 I first saw this picture in a massive well-illustrated book called \"A Pictorial History of the Talkies\" published in 1958.\n\nThe author Daniel Blum had thousands of movie stills plus around 20 pictures of men in very skimpy costumes.\n\nI couldn't figure out if this was a private picture where he'd roll the fabric up to expose as much flesh as decency permitted.\n\n^ I was suspicious there were so many beefcake pictures in that book.\n\nAnother picture from the 1930s showed the buttock of young teen washing in a wooden tub. I'm guessing it was from 'Huckleberry Finn' or The Adventures of Tom Sawyer from 1938\n\nHe was a big lunk, wasn't he?\n\nYou didn't expect him to make any conversation except grunting.\n\nI didn't like that Aldo Ray joke on The Golden Girls. He was so hot so I can't see why it would be embarrassing for Dorothy to be in his fan club."
