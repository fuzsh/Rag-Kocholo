        "text": "Vinayagane Vinai theerpanae..\n\nAayar paadi maligaiyil ..\n\nEllam Yesuve Ennakellam Yesuve..\n\nAllavai Naam tholuthaan…\n\nSenthamizh Naadennum Pothinile..\n\nMy mornings were this secular, I have been woken up to these set of secular playlists for almost 15-20 years of my life. Thanks to Madurai/Trichy All India radio AM Stations. After these songs, news will be aired. News without sensationalizing things and TRP Stunts. It was with neutral tone and full of information. At 7 AM at Trichy “Indru oru thavagal” by eminent Orator Thenkachi Ko.Swaminathan a five min program with motivational stories which provide new perception of our life in a humorous way. This was one of successful in terms remuneration in radio program those days. Now Zen Stories are common right he used say Zen stories in those days. Immediately once this program completes without sparing a second myself or anyone form my family will turn the Radio to Ceylon Tamil Radio Station. A lively AM radio station which only play most new and trendy Tamil songs when compared to All India Radio stations. Srilankan Tamil station is also famous for its wonderful hosts like K.S.Raja, P.H.Abdul Hameed, kamalini and Rajeswari Shanmugam. Mostly 60s & 70s Kids would have fond memories listening to great hosts. My mother is one among them. Because of her I liked radios she used sing along every song which played in radio which was quite obvious habit of those era’s women. After seeing her I also started memorizing lines. Now we both sing along any songs together. Memorizing line helped to revisit that song because we don’t know when we would listen to the song again.\n\nWhen I am studying 10th Standard as the usual practice in those days, my father cancelled the cable TV connection. Radios was only allowed. I had an exception to listen radios for one hour in mornings and nights. May be I was the generation was the last to listen One hour movie which broadcasted in the radio.\n\nI am an engineering graduate (2002-2006). I stayed in college hostel. During those college days radios were only way to know the cricket scores especially for test matches and matches during our tests. The main challenge in listening to radio commentary was for every 15 minutes Commentary would swap from Hindi/English. During the crucial moments of the match when commentary was in Hindi, It would be tough to understand what is exactly happening and I know Hindi numbers till 20 so anything greater than 20 it is Greek and Latin to me. Only thing we get was the ads for 4s, 6s and wickets I still remember one “Yeah BSNL ka Chakka Connecting India” that means it is a Six. Now those struggles are fresh and strike in mind and whenever I get to know the scores and commentary by many means thanks to Internet and smart phones.\n\nMy friend Jeevan Kumar was from Electronics and Communications Branch he is few guys who selected the right engineering branch. He was passionate about electronics, He could create his own custom FM radio after college he pursued his dream by becoming a software testing engineer in top MNC. Jeevan’s custom radio used drag Sri Lanka Sakthi/Vetri FM around 12 AM -12-15 AM they play new songs. Listen to that there were around 10-15 guys will be gathered in a single room. At 2AM in vetri FM used to play only fast numbers and new songs to keep auto/bus drivers entertained, sometimes we used to stay awake to listen to those songs.\n\nAround 2003-2004 Private FM Radio Stations was started in Tamil Nadu like Suriyan, Radio Mirchi. I think everyone would remember box like FM radio in share auto buses after that. They were known for its huge sound and easy breakable quality. In our college Suriyan FM thirunelveli was available.we bought a FM radio in our room. We used to play that all night long for the first few months.\n\nI came to Chennai in 2006, I used to listen Radio Mirchi one of the young, energetic and full filled FM even now. I was attracted to Radio mirchi so much because it was entirely different from southern tamilnadu. Hosting and promos were thing were interesting. My favorite RJ is Suchitra. Her ”Good Morning Chennai & Radio mirchi ithu Semma Hot Machi ” is enough to you to be her fan. Her Spontaneous will shock you and laugh out loud. Bigtime stars now like Mirchi Shiva, Chinamai,Dharbuga Shiva, Gopi Nath, Jhon Vijay were RJs those days. These Fun filled and humorous RJs helped me in bigtime to cross a Job less year. I still cherish some moments like I used call FM radios for contests and won some movie tickets to watch movies like Vettaiyaadu villaiyadu & jillunu oru Kadhal in Abirami Complex. I would be cursed if I didn’t mention Suriyan FM’s night RJ and Ilayaraja Fanatic Yaazh Sudhagar, his narration on each song will make you love songs even more.\n\nNow we have smarter and bigger memory phones and faster internets where we can store stream any number of songs. Now I can play whichever song I feel like listening, there are lots options but still these can’t match to joy of listening to radios, waiting eagerly in front of radio and tuning one station after another expecting our favorite songs to be played irreplaceable and finally your favorite song is played that feeling is a bliss, Radios are like parents they won’t give your favorite things all time but right things always. Because radios can amaze your joyous moment by playing a song apt for that situation which will magnify your Joy. Even If you are down, a random song in radio which we would feel consoling us. There is no way you can’t stop shedding tears. The biggest problem with modern apps is lack of surprises. Radios surprises you"
