        "text": "2022 was the year that wasn’t.\n\nEverything was supposed to come together this year, remember? The Covid insanity had passed, the economy was starting to boom again, demand was pent up and the party-as-a-verb crowd was raring to go.\n\nInstead we had inflation, supply chain teeth-gnashing, water woes and travel nightmares.\n\nWe started the year in Paris and ended it in London. In between two tasty bookends there was grief aplenty, health issues and the gnawing sense that the town and body we live in both have their best days behind them. A dear friend (original Proper Lunch Buncher Bruce Bloch), and local food writer (Greg Thilmont) — both left us far too soon — leaving us reeling from too much sadness compressed into one twelve month period. It is one thing when folks older than you kick the bucket, quite another when your juniors start checking out without warning. If 2022 will be remembered for anything, it will be recalled as the year of serious reassessment — the time when the preciousness of time and life was brought to the fore.\n\nOn the bright side, deaths tend to bring people closer together (“Even if we’re just whistling past the graveyard,” as my mom put it), so we saw more of our relatives (and children) than we have in any year in recent memory; we lost a little weight (TRUE!); regained our golf swing, and kept our hearing and our hair, so there’s that.\n\nAnother year-end bonus was a very successful Desert Companion Restaurant Awards fête, which had me tearing up with pride at how far these awards have come.\n\nFrom very modest beginnings, these magazine awards have endured and flourished over 25 years. In the early days (1997-2005) I was a committee of one, and for years, I paid for the tiny plaques and awards myself, and drove all over town delivering them to a recipients. (You can still see one near the front door at Sen of Japan.) Now, under the stewardship on Nevada Public Radio, there’s a yearly banquet, with all the trimmings, and they’ve grown into something meaningful to our culinary community, instead of a solo poofter bestowing them like some imperious potentate bellowing into the wind.\n\nWhich means there’s a fair amount of pomp and circumstances accompanying them…not to mention a tremendous lunch. The banquet was a big success; glasses were raised and speeches given, but not before the crowd was acknowledged as we usually do to begin the proceedings:\n\n2022 will also go down as the year where your majesty truly lost a bit of his appetite…but not so much that he cannot bestow credit where credit is due, one last time, for the myriad of marvelous meals he enjoyed.\n\nSo here goes….first with the actual, important awards (decided by a committee of Desert Companion food writers), then the Major Awards you’ve been waiting for….with commentary, of course.\n\nNeighborhood Restaurant(s) of the Year (tie):\n\nKhoury’s Mediterranean Restaurant:\n\nRosa Ristorante:\n\nAsian Restaurant of the Year: Trattoria Nakamura-Ya:\n\nRestaurateur of the Year: John Arena\n\n– the godfather of the Las Vegas food scene, and a force of nature in the world of pizza, Arena should’ve gotten this award years ago. (My bad.)\n\nHall of Fame (tie):\n\nPiero’s Italian Cuisine – which didn’t care enough to show up for the awards (or even acknowledge them), so we won’t do more than give them a mere mention here (even though it was some of my best prose in the ‘zine).\n\nPeppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge – which was my father’s favorite restaurant, right down to the indelible fruit platter brimming with melon (at varying degrees of ripeness) and cottage cheese. No matter what you think of the Miami Vice lighting or gargantuan portions, there’s no denying its place in the firmament of iconic Vegas eats.\n\nRising Star of the Year: Eric Prato, Garagiste Wine Bar:\n\nPrato’s mission is educating customers to try something new, and if the steady stream of younger, adventuresome wine lovers at the bar is any indication (along with his burgeoning online sales), he is succeeding by tapping into (or helping create) a market no one in Las Vegas knew existed.\n\nChef of the Year: Nicole Brisson:\n\nStrip Restaurant of the Year: Brezza – A hit right out of the gate, Brezza scored the daily double with this award and the kudos to its chef. As Heidi Knapp Rinella put it in DC:\n\nBrezza is the Italian word for “breeze” — an apt name, as executive chef Nicole Brisson and business partner Jason Rocheleau have imbued their Resorts World restaurant with a freshness that seems to drift from the Amalfi Coast.\n\nNew Restaurant of the Year: Scotch 80 Prime – the name might not be new (this is its second incarnation), but the steakhouse that now occupies a corner of the Palms is a whole different beast that the previous tenant. Chef Marty Red DeLeon Lopez has this joint firing on all cylinders with an arresting menu of seared cow classics mixed with creative apps and killer sides. A unique addition to our thundering herd of steer emporiums. Jim Begley:\n\n…it can be difficult to differentiate one [steakhouse] from another. But Lopez manages do so in the details. He highlights his heritage in his tiradito with the inclusion of traditional Filipino ingredients such as jackfruit, pickled papaya, and taro chips. His kitchen takes risks with burrata topped with uni and Osetra caviar, pairing seafood with cheese, and the sweet sea urchin assuming a role normally reserved for fruit.\n\nRestaurant of the Year: Anima by EDO – When it came time to debate ROTY the discussion was short, obvious and unanimous. No other restaurant in Las Vegas made the splash that Anima did this year.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nWith the prestigious awards out of the way, let us further flounce some flummery, and focus on the fatuous. Here they are food fans, our favorites follies of feast and misfortune in 2022:\n\nTHE PANS\n\nWorst Meal of the Year – Lago\n\nRunner-Up – whatever this was (at The Pepper Club):\n\nSo Not Worth It Meal of the Year – Wakuda:\n\nCry Me a River Award – every chef or owner who bent my ear in the last year over staffing woes, supply-chain issues, and money problems, and then was spotted cavorting through Tokyo, slurping up Tuscany, or making whoopee at a Mallorcan fish market.\n\nSaddest Closing – Saga Pastry + Sandwich\n\nYou Tell Me and We’ll Both Know Award – the inexplicable appeal of Asian hotpot…….the only meal on earth where no matter what you order, everything always ends up tasting the same:\n\n(…and we’ll have the A-5 wagyu that tastes just like the U/15 shrimp…)\n\nSchadenfreude Award – David Chang’s overblown, overrated, overpriced Majordomo fiasco at The Palazzo. It takes real talent to screw up a steakhouse in Vegas, but Mr. Bao Bun figured out how.\n\nWe’re So Over It –\n\ncaviar\n\nQR codes\n\norange wine\n\nnatural wine\n\nany beer it takes more than two words to describe\n\ncelebrity chefs\n\ncronuts\n\nfood competitions\n\npizza fetishization\n\ngooey food videos\n\nimpossible to get into restaurants\n\nsmoked cocktails\n\nsmoked everything\n\nsmoked anything but smoked meat\n\ncommunal seating\n\nmicro-greens\n\ntweezer food\n\n“vegan” butchers\n\n“vegan” cheese\n\nlet’s face it: vegan anything\n\nJapanese beef\n\ntequila bars\n\nMartha F**cking Stewart\n\nTits on a Bull Award – I’m rooting hard for you, Eater Vegas, because you could be such a force for good on the Vegas food scene. But the reliance on p.r. fluff and listicle after listicle needs some seasoning with actual opinion. On the plus side, at least Bradley Martin is nowhere to be found. ;-)\n\nTHE PICKS\n\nBest Restaurant That’s Closest to My House (toss-up) – Main Street Provisions and Esther’s Kitchen\n\nFavorite Watering Hole – Garagiste\n\nSteak of the Year – Sparrow + Wolf:\n\nRunner-Up – CUT:\n\nSushi of the Year – Sushi Hiro:\n\nRunner-Up – YUI Edomae Sushi\n\nMost Anticipated Opening of the Year – Lotus of Siam at Red Rock\n\nItalians of the Year – these guys:\n\n(Vetri & Trees sounds like a haberdashery)\n\nLunch(s) of the Year – Cipriani\n\nLunch of the Year (European Division) – La Tour D’Argent Paris (France, not Kentucky)\n\nBrunch of the Year – Al Solito Posto\n\nFrench Meal of the Year – Guy Savoy (Paris)\n\nRunner-Up – Guy Savoy (Las Vegas)\n\nJapanese Meal of the Year – Raku:\n\nRunner(s)-Up – Sanga, Kaiseki Yuzu\n\nChinese Meal of the Year – Genting Palace (Resorts World)\n\nRunner-Up – Rainbow Kitchen\n\nKorean Meal of the Year – Soyo Barstaurant\n\nTacos of the Year (toss-up) – Sin Fronteras Tacos and Letty’s\n\n(Quesotacos FTW)\n\nFavorite Meat-fest – Rincon de Buenos Aires\n\nRunner-Up – 8oz Korean Steakhouse\n\nBurger of the Year – Main Street Provisions\n\nRunner-Up BOTY – Nusr-Et:\n\nSlider of the Year – this mini-filet on a hot-buttered bun at Jamon Jamon Tapas:\n\nHot Dog of the Year – Windy City Beef N Dogs:\n\nRunner-Up PSOTY: Amalfi by Bobby Flay\n\nMost Expensive Meal of the Year – a $400 fagri (red porgy) at Milos:\n\n(It says right here: I owe $14.72 because you had the salad with the dressing on the side)\n\nMost Fun Food Event Not Connected with Any Awards or Eating: Las Vegas Book Festival:\n\nButcher of the Year – Featherblade English Craft Butchery\n\nPodcast of the Year – Eat.Talk.Repeat. – Have you been living under a rock or something?\n\nHole-in-the-Wall of the Year – The Daily Bread\n\nMost Visited Hotel Because It Has the Most Good Restaurants in the Most Accessible Space – Resorts World\n\nRestaurant We’re Rooting Hardest For – Mariscos El Frescos:\n\nCappucino Award – Mothership Coffee Roasters\n\nRunner-Up – PublicUs\n\nCrabcake of the Year – this concupiscent crabby concoction at Vic & Anthony’s:\n\nWe Wish We Had Eaten Here More Award – Kaiseki Yuzu:\n\nFood Writer to Watch of the Year – Brent Holmes\n\nVlogger of the Year – So-Chan! (Even if you don’t speak Japanese, his videos are informative, well-produced, and ton of fun….and mercifully short.)\n\nLifesaver Awards – to those places we repaired again and again when our favorites were busier than a whisky concession at an Irish wedding:\n\nNoodlehead – Szechuan noodles in a pinch\n\nIzakaya Go – all-purpose Japanese fills the bill:\n\nMt. Everest – friendly and fast Indian\n\nMatteo’s – always underrated; always excellent\n\nDelmonico – great steaks; fabulous Friday lunch\n\nYu-Or-Mi Sushi – so much better than The Pepper Club\n\nCarversteak – just edged out for steak of the year by two heavyweights\n\nWally’s – best wine selection and prices on the Strip\n\nEd. note: In case you’re wondering, we didn’t include any meals/restaurants from our recent London trip to any of these categories, it’s because we are just days back from the trip and want to share our British musings with you in a separate post early next year.\n\nMerry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to all!"
