        "text": "(Another one bites the crust)\n\nIt’s been a banner year for new restaurants, but most of the growth has been confined to the ‘burbs. (Face it: the Strip is now more boring than an Elon Musk boondoggle.)\n\nWhether the engine is a booming economy, pent-up demand or big money finally stepping into the food game (Hello, The Sundry and Lev Group!), the greater Las Vegas area is teeming with worthy newcomers, some done on a shoestring, others well-financed, each seeking a slice of the hunger pie. In years past we might’ve had trouble coming up with half a dozen lip-smacking joints, this year has been a bounty of riches, with more to come in the final four months.\n\nAnd yes, I know the year is only 66.6% over, but whether it is out of habit (10 years of writing my guidebook, and 25 of doing the Desert Companion/KNPR Restaurant Awards), I seem to be congenitally wired to start writing about the “year’s best” when summertime is on the wane.\n\nSo consider this a partial list, which bears updating, but a good start if you’re looking for what is recent and deserving of your dining out dollars:\n\nThe Best New Restaurants of 2023 (in no particular order, with commentary):\n\n138 Degrees Craft Chophouse CLOSED\n\n(…and then this lawyer dude asked for ketchup…)\n\nHenderson has a steakhouse to call its own, aging everything from the sirloins to the salmon.\n\nBasilico Ristorante Italiano\n\n(Surf and turf risotto alla Francesco Di Caudo)\n\nIt’s hard to get excited about Italian anymore, but I can almost work up a woody over this one.\n\n1228 Main\n\nYou will not find me here most mornings only because my waistline won’t allow it.\n\n(ELV’s usual at 1228)\n\n(I can resist anything but temptation)\n\n(Shrimply the best)\n\nAs good as the pastries are, the lunch/dinner options (including the best pasta of the year pictured above) here are every bit as technically perfect as you would expect from a Wolfgang Puck operation.\n\nAzzurra Cucina\n\n(Not your father’s Water Street)\n\nIf this keeps up, we’re going to have to retire the word Hendertucky and start eating crow….with a proper demi-glace, of course.\n\nAroma Latin American Cocina\n\nNueva Latina in Green Valley makes about as much sense as a salsa band at a Mormon social, but here it is, just waiting to be discovered by the mortgage-poor crowd. Full disclosure: we haven’t been, but Eat. Talk. Repeat. co-host Ash the Attorney raves about this place.\n\nOcean Prime\n\nVegas needs another chain steakhouse like I need another ex-wife, but when the payoff is this spectacular, the heart goes where the heart goes.\n\nKaiseki Yuzu Sushi Bar\n\nJonathon Mau knows his Maguro)\n\nStrictly for purists; no sushbags allowed.\n\n00 Pie & Pub\n\n(A crust above)\n\nMike Vakneen is a pizza savant and Chinatown is now his playground.\n\n(Not pizza; too delicious not to post)\n\nThe starters — including the roasted Calabrian peppers with anchovies above — are Esther’s Kitchen-worthy.\n\nMizunara at The Sundry\n\n(Bun-Bun Hiyashi Chuka)\n\nHomie don’t order off no QR code. Home boy (who hasn’t been a boy for 50 years) demands old-fashioned service…and cold ramen noodles like these.\n\nMarche Bacchus – Bradley Ogden edition\n\nMB has been through so many incarnations we’ve stopped counting. So has Bradley Ogden for that matter. But the menu here hasn’t been this good in a decade, and though things might look the same, you’re basically eating in a whole new restaurant.\n\nNaxos Taverna\n\nThink of it as a slightly cheaper, local’s Estiatorio Milos, with free parking and without the fish displayed like jewelry… and thank me later. (Efcharistó, Mark Andelbradt)\n\nTaste of Asia\n\nChinatown-level Chinese in Summerlin makes about as much sense as haute Latina in Henderson, but the times they are a-changin’. Karrie Hung is out to raise the Asia steaks in a part of town who finds Panda Express too “foreign”. There’s plenty to placate the sweet and sour pork crowd, but the real gems are in the chef’s specials and seafood, plus the best Peking duck deal ($80) this side of New Asian BBQ.\n\nDaeho Kalbijjim\n\nhttps://twitter.com/i/status/1686209325663244288\n\nYears of dining with our Korean komrades has taught us that Korean restaurants are usually known for doing one or two things well, and the rest of the menu is just filler. Daeho does its justifiably famous sweet-spicy beef rib stew, with promiscuous cheese pulls for those infected with Tik Tok brain….like us above, straining to influence the f++k out of this place.\n\nB.S. Taqueria at The Sundry\n\nThe B. S. stands for “Broken Spanish” and it’s the best Mexican food we had this year. Second only to Viva! by Ray Garcia in Resorts World. Same chef, terrific tortillas, serious south of the border stuff.\n\nLamoon\n\nLamoon packs a one-two punch of fiery food and highly-curated wine that will leave you fit to be Thai’d. The decor (in an old Dairy Queen!) is pretty snappy too.\n\nHola Mexican Cocina + Cantina\n\nI once made the mistake on KNPR radio of pronouncing “cocina” as co-CHEEN-a instead of saying co-THEEN-a or co-SEEN-a — which apparently meant I was describing a local restaurant as a prostitute instead of a kitchen. No matter how you pronounce it, the food here tastes great no matter how much Mexican you speak.\n\nYukon Pizza\n\nWhy a burger and not a pizza pic? Because of all the griddled, frilly smashed cheeseburgers in town, this one meats all expectations…as do all their kick-ass pies.\n\nYen Viet Kitchen\n\nNot strictly new this year, but new to us, and best Vietnamese food we have eaten in Las Vegas, ever — and we’ve eaten in all of them, up and down Spring Mountain Road. What this video lacks in dynamism and drama, it makes up for in information. A must-stop on SMR, and the definition of a hidden gem.\n\nSpeaking of hidden gems….\n\nYummy Kitchen\n\nThey don’t get much more tucked away than Yummy Kitchen, tossing its chili crab and other Singaporean-Malaysian delights inside an Asian supermarket, far across a parking lot at Spring Mountain and Decatur. The crabs are still-moving fresh, and the garlic shrimp, roti, Hainanese chicken, and Malay curries will save you plane fare to Disneyland-with-the-death-penalty.\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nWhile we’re at it…..\n\nWorst new restaurants of 2023:\n\nM.Y. Asia (Closed!)\n\nFrom stunt noodles to chicken so bad it left us yearning for a Panda Express, this tourist trap was D.O.A.\n\nTold. You. So.\n\nVic’s\n\nComically < average Italian at the Smith Center, brought to you by folks who’ve never dined at Brezza or Basilico….and wouldn’t understand them if they did.\n\nBespoke Kitchen\n\nNothing bespoke except the name.\n\nCathédrale\n\nBy-the-numbers dining for the selfie wall crowd, brought to you by the Tao Group — who haven’t had an original idea since 2005. Soulless decor, jaw-dropping prices, insulting wine list — the symbol of every unimaginative ripoff late-stage Las Vegas has become in one, overdecorated restaurant.\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nDid we miss a few on both sides of these equations? Probably, but this list should get you started, and we have three months to keep eating and augment things.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your summer, and cheers!\n\nTHE END\n\n(When influencers attack!)\n\nIf you have an appetite for life, stay hungry.\n\nSuch has been my mantra for 50 years. Half a century of searching for the best things to shove down the ole pie hole.\n\nAnd apparently, I’m not done yet. Our new podcast — Eat. Talk. Repeat. (w/ Sam Mirejovsky and Ashley Watkins) — is keeping me busy most weeks, searching for good meals and food topics of interest. As long as someone is listening, I’ll still be flapping my gums.\n\nWho am I kidding? I’d still be gasbagging away even if no one was around to hear me. At this point, I’m having fun eating what I want where I want when I want, and not being controlled by the dictates of putting out a guidebook (although that was a blast while it lasted), or paid-for writing gigs. Being on podcasts and not having to actually produce one is more fun than shooting monkeys in a barrel. Color me happy as a clam in linguine.\n\nAlong the same lines, I am determined to champion the great food of our Chinatown as long as I can pick up a chopstick. To that end, I’ve started an Asian Lunch Bunch with a few writers, influencers, and other Asian aficionados to figure out ways to help the best places along and around Spring Mountain Road, many of which do not have the savvy or wherewithal to do much marketing on their own. Suffice to say, when we invade, the food photogs are out in force (see pic at top of page).\n\nIt’s been nine years since I did a survey of every place along SMR. In 2014, there were 112 eateries up and down the three miles between Valley View and Rainbow. I’d venture the number has almost doubled since then. Shanghai Plaza alone has almost twenty restaurants in it, and several other strip malls have popped up in the past few years — each studded with eateries from all over the Pacific Rim.\n\nIf there’s a food scene for which Las Vegas should be famous in the 2020’s, it should be this one. The Strip (with a few exceptions) has become more boring than a Donny and Marie concert. It’ll be interesting to see what Fontainbleau brings to the party, but when Martha Stewart, Peter Luger (a 136 year old brand) and the Voltaggio Brothers (whoever they are) are the best you can do, you’re just milking the old cows for all they’re worth. And as much as we love Vetri Cucina, Balla, Cipriani, and Brezza (and have had nice experiences at Amalfi by Bobby Flay and RPM), if one more Italian opens to a bunch of forced fanfare, I’m gonna commit seppuku with a splintered chopstick.\n\nAs usual, every place listed has been visited by me recently (and by recently I mean the last six weeks), and all places come highly recommended unless otherwise noted.\n\nTHE LIST\n\nVetri Cucina –\n\nBest Italian in town. Don’t even think about arguing with me about this.\n\nNeed proof? Here ya go:\n\nOsteria Fiorella –\n\n(Pistachio > pineapple on pizza)\n\nSorta like Vetri-lite, but still damn tasty at a friendlier price point, with outdoor seating and the same great cocktails and wine. The weird-looking pizza above (mortadella/capicola with pistachios) raised an eyebrow when ordered but then sent a shiver down our spine when we tasted it. Marc Vetri’s food will do that to you.\n\nSparrow + Wolf –\n\n(Don’t try this at home)\n\nBrian Howard’s food can astonish, and it can confuse, but it’s always damn tasty, vividly composed and never boring. Witness the gnocchi with sweetbreads above — garnished and sauced to a fare thee well.\n\nThe Daily Bread –\n\n(You dough’nt want to miss this)\n\nGo early. go often, for the best artisanal baked goods you’ll ever taste next to a fake lake.\n\nChengdu Taste –\n\n(Not-as-innocent-as-they-look lamb skewers)\n\nThe best of Szechuan, tucked away behind Spring Mountain Road and impossible to get into at dinner. Pro tip: Go early for lunch — like around 11:30.\n\nPro tip #2: Bring a crowd. This food is best enjoyed family-style with 3-6 folks at a table.\n\nPro tip #3: Bring a firehose (see below).\n\n(Asbestos-lined palate required)\n\nSen of Japan –\n\n(Oh, the salad days of ‘o7)\n\n(Uni’d to try this omakase)\n\nA granddaddy among our sushi mainstays. Still brings the goods and always comforting, always welcoming, even if it doesn’t compete (or try to match) the higher end Japanese joints opening up everywhere these days. The $100 omakase is a steal.\n\nMarché Bacchus –\n\n(Bradley O. has his work cut out for him)\n\nBradley Ogden has taken the helm of one of the toughest gigs in town. He’s not ready to retire and has a kitchen expansion (sorely needed) and menu upgrade in mind. Restaurants are like sharks: they have to constantly move forward or die. If Ogden can pull it off, he’ll have a Great White on his hands.\n\nPublicUs –\n\n(Salmon-chanted breakfast toast)\n\nFirst-class coffee; house-baked savories and sweets; incredible bread; never a misstep for nine straight years. And me and The Food Gal® come here, all. the. time. PublicUs is a downtown phenomenon: a major success in a location that defines the term “challenging.” But its customers know quality when they taste it and this place never fails to deliver the goods.\n\nPro tip: Breakfast is faster than lunch, but both can be maddeningly slow at peak times (they make everything to order and slowness is the price you pay). Go early or go elsewhere if you’re in a hurry. Or show up Sunday mornings at 7:00 am like we do and be the first in line.\n\nShangHai Taste –\n\n(Las Vegas Fill-ing up)\n\nWe don’t get into “Who has the best xiao long bao?” debates. Soup dumplings are like sex: the worst we ever had was still pretty good. (Funny how women never agree with this statement.) That said, these are the best, and Jimmy and Jeng Li are two of Chinatown’s treasures.\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nWe temporarily interrupt this food blog bloviation for a….Nusr-Et v. Yukon Pizza BURGER THROWDOWN!\n\nHow do you take your burgers? Thick and juicy and dripping with onion jam:\n\n(Be my burger bae?)\n\n….or are you more of a griddled, smashburger kinda person?\n\n(Smashing)\n\nHowever you grind it, these two beauts will take your breath away. Nusr-et’s at $32 is a wonder of barely-held-together, fatty wagyu, slicked with fat and dripping with beefy intensity. Yukon’s double-burger ($14) took me straight back the Steak ‘N Shake steakburgers of my youth, and with its house-made pickles, American cheese, grilled onions and sweet/tangy sauce is the last word in ground Maillard-reactive meat umami.\n\nWe’ve pitted these two meat patties against each other in our head for weeks, and can’t decide on a winner. Nusr-et is open for lunch and is always empty, so your burger will get special attention if you’re the only one in the joint. Yukon is open for service continu (as the Frogs say) every day but Monday and Tuesday, and has been a hit from the jump, so you’ll have to either call ahead or elbow your way in. Good luck solving this delicious connundrum.\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nYukon Pizza –\n\n(A crust above)\n\nBest dim sum? Top burger? Pizza wars? Who cares? The only thing that counts is quality, and Yukon has it in spades. The tiny space (seating about a dozen, tops) has been crowded every moment since it opened with pizza hounds who know a properly blistered and charred cornicione when they taste one. Between the pies and the burger, I’m going to have trouble keeping The Food Gal® away from this place.\n\nThose Guys Pies –\n\nCome for the pizza; stay for the cheesesteak. Actually, there’s no staying at The Lakes location — it’s take-out only.\n\nConsumer warning: the “Pizza Margherita” should renamed Pizza Garlicrita — best eaten alone or far away from any sentient human beings.\n\nManizza’s Pizza –\n\nAsh Watkins said this pizza ranked 37th in the United States on Yelp’s list of “Best Pizzas in America” (#eyeroll), so we had to trek out to the southwest to taste for ourselves. Yelp rankings always smack of paid-for advertising, and this joint is obviously playing the game. It’s a decent facsimile of a deck oven New York slice and that’s about it. (#Yelpsucks)\n\nPrime Steakhouse –\n\nWhat doesn’t suck is this grand dame — still, after 25 years, the prettiest steakhouse in America. The menu’s barely changed in that time, and the tuna tartare is way too cold and the mixed “Greek” salad not that great and the crab cake too deep fried…but we still hold it dear to our hearts…mainly because the steaks and the sauces (and the Parmesan-crusted chicken) still tickle our fancy:\n\nJamon Jamon Tapas –\n\nWe’re sad about Chef Rafael moving his hard-to-find ode to Spanish cuisine all the way to Henderson, but we’ll be happy for him if he finds a more appreciative audience out there. His food is an exquisite rendering of the best of Spain, with paellas like you won’t find anywhere not named Jaleo. He plans on moving at the end of April, so get your jamon Iberico fix in now before he disappears into the wilds of Boulder Highway.\n\nWeera Thai (3 locations) –\n\nThe new one on south Rainbow is stunning (above). The slightly older one in Chinatown is a smaller version and the perfect venue to tuck into some roast duck pad Thai or pumpkin red curry. The original on west Sahara is no less popular, and between the three of them, you’re never too far from some incendiary Khua Kling, bone broth soup, or a ginormous pork shank:\n\nBalla –\n\nIf Vetri Cucina tops them all these days, Shawn McClain’s Balla is running a close second. It’s menu isn’t quite as adventurous and the setting is not as dramatic, but it’s easier to get to, the short wine list is a knockout, and everything from the artichokes to the bomboloni (above) tastes like they were imported from Rome. The wood-fired veal Milanese and lamb tartare are not to be missed. This old beet hater even found something to like for McClain’s beets — dripping with agrodolce (a sweet/sour dressing) and festooned with mint and hazelnuts.\n\nAfter two visits, we can’t wait for a third.\n\nMain Street Provisions –\n\nPatrick Munster is killing it with a gutsy menu that fits downtown like a hipster’s fedora.\n\nToscana Ristorante & Bar –\n\n(Come to Pappa al pomodoro)\n\nThere are so many great Italians in town right now, hauling one’s ass to the far reaches of whatever they’re calling the Monte Carlo these days to eat makes about as much sense as putting your paycheck on double-aughts at roulette. Regardless, haul our sizeable arse we did to Eataly for a San Marzano tomato tasting that confirmed why I stopped going to press events ten years ago.\n\nFor the record: the tomatoes were great (see the pappa al pomodoro above) and the restaurant perfectly fine, but putting out 100+ plates of the same, tepid food at the same time is no way to deliver pasta…or rice. Risotto waits for no one, and is almost impossible to serve at volume. Most of the crowd didn’t notice the gumminess though — they were just happy to be eating for free.\n\nRaku –\n\n(Spring Mountain superstars)\n\nFor my money, Raku is Las Vegas’s greatest restaurant — a chopstick-dropping combination of precise cooking, authentic recipes, pristine ingredients, and unwavering consistency…for fifteen years. Strictly for Japanese fanatics, though. Raku is not the place to ooh and aah over enormous slabs of A-5, or tuna the size of a canoe. Everything is about subtlety and precision here. If you don’t like your fish with eyeballs, look elsewhere. I’ve never had a bad meal at Raku; I’ve never even had a bad bite. If there is such a thing as an exquisite izakaya, this is it.\n\nWe broke the story on social media a couple of weeks ago about Mitsuo Endo taking over the convenience store fifty feet away from Raku’s front door, and turning it into a “members only” omakase restaurant with only eight seats. We intend to be a member.\n\nSerrano’s Mexican Food –\n\nEveryone should have a default Mexican hole-in-the-wall and this one is ours. Nothing super special, just solid renditions of chilaquiles and a nice Mexican pizza (above).\n\nMg Patisserie –\n\n…where Michael Gillet runs the cutest little French pastry shop in all of Vegas — hand-crafting the best of France all by his lonesome in a spot which is too good for its location.\n\nYen Viet Kitchen –\n\nVietnamese food tastes maddeningly the same to us, no matter what the restaurant. Or so we thought, until we took one sip of the cleanest, clearest, most intensely rich broth in our Bún Bò Hué (above) we’ve encountered up and down SMR. Shockingly good, and the perfect antidote to the same old same old pho parlor. P.S. the Banh xeo (a huge crispy turmeric rice flour pancake) was a show-stopper as well. As are the soups. All of them.\n\nCarson Kitchen\n\nWe hit CK at the very end of last year to give its new menu a spin. There wasn’t a clinker in the bunch as we plowed through grilled oysters (above), roasted cauliflower, wild boar tacos, and a crispy, deeply succulent sandwich most foul which we called “Kentucky Fried Duck.” A new expansion has opened an outdoor patio in the back of the restaurant, but we think a seat at the six-person bar is still the way to go. CK has always been too industrial (and too loud) for our tastes, but there’s no denying the talent in the kitchen. This new menu reminds us of why it was love at first bite, almost nine years ago.\n\nEsther’s Kitchen –\n\n(Our usual at EK)\n\n“That place is so crowded no one goes there anymore,” is our favorite saying about this place. Can you believe it’s been five years since James Trees started the Arts District culinary revolution? People who says it’s lost its fastball don’t know what they’re talking about. The can get slammed, putting both the kitchen and bar in the weeds, but when the drinks and dishes show up, all is forgiven.\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nFor the umpteenth time in the past four decades, I tried to find something to like about Filipino food. Hungry as hell one day last month, I scurried over to some rando roach coach near City Hall and walked away with this pork belly sisig:\n\n…hoping against hope to find some appealingly porky rice with which to sate my hunger. What I found was some sour, off-tasting melange of chopped veg and protein bits which seriously detracted from a fine slice of crisp, fatty belly. The thick, dull lumpia didn’t help the cause, nor did waiting almost 20 minutes for my order…when I was the only one in line. At this point, I’ve concluded most food found in the Philippines was conceived on a dare, and the reason Filipinos are so skinny is they never overeat, for good reason. Or maybe to get the good stuff you have to go to someone’s home. Either way, include me out.\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nLet’s end on a high note, shall we? Rather than dwell on Filipino food fails, let us celebrate the best service staff in Las Vegas, and some squid:\n\nCipriani –\n\n(The Dream Team)\n\nEveryone knows the service at Cipriani is the tits….but we wouldn’t be there multiple times a month if it weren’t for dishes like this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/eatinglasvegas/status/1620236917131587590?s=20&t=bl5sbwFOZ7WH3Cafm1U65A\n\nSquid ink risotto (Risotto al Nero di Seppia), may not be everyone’s cup of cephalopod, but it’s as faithful to the flavors of Venice as a gondola.\n\nRegardless of mixed metaphors, the fact remains that the Big C puts out the best lunch in Vegas. You find me a better one and I’ll come to your restaurant three times a month, too.\n\nAt my age, I’m too old to eat in mediocre restaurants anymore, and at my age, can you blame me?\n\nCheers!\n\n(Luxury looks good on me, even if I can’t afford it)\n\nEating is like sex: sometimes you do it as a form of art, and sometimes you do it to satisfy an urge. – Me\n\nIt’s time I shared a little secret with you — one I usually keep to myself: As open-minded as I try to remain when eating out, I do play favorites. Sometimes I go out with a purpose in mind, other times it is simply to obtain tried and true pleasure from an old, comfortable companion — a place that consistently brings me to a satisfying finish, once in a while, without too much thought.\n\nYou know, kinda like marriage.\n\nPut another way: when it’s time to unwind and dine on my own dime, rather than opine or repine about where I’ve reclined…. sometimes I’m supine about places most fine, which you and I know have already shined.\n\nSure, I trumpet the merits of everything from sushi bars to pasta joints all over town, and, at the drop of a hangar I’ll rattle off my top ten steakhouses, or five favorite Frenchies…but truth be told, when the time comes for the Food Gal and I to grab a quick bite, there’s usually only a few (okay, more like a few dozen) places on our agenda.\n\nAnd by “on our agenda” I mean places we rely upon, but still manage to argue about.\n\nTake any random week night or Sunday afternoon. If you’re hanging around our kitchen counter, at the palatial Curtas manse, you might overhear a conversation that goes something like this:\n\nThe Food Gal®: “I’m hungry.”\n\nThe World’s Greatest Restaurant Critic®, i.e., me: “What are you in the mood for? Uh….(I then proceed to call a grammar foul on myself) I meant: for what are you in the mood, my sweet?”\n\nHer: “I dunno, what do you want”?\n\nMe: “I thought you said you were hungry. What would you like?”\n\nHer: “Anything. I’m starving.”\n\nMe: (realizing we’re getting nowhere) “Okay, how about brisket and ribs?”\n\nHer: “No, they’re too smoky.”\n\n“Korean?”\n\n“Too garlicky.”\n\n“Mexican?”\n\n“Too much cilantro.”\n\n“Pasta?”\n\n“Too filling.”\n\n“Sushi?”\n\n“Not filling enough”\n\n“Indian?”\n\n“It’s too hot for Indian.”\n\n“How about we hit up that Bahamian-Nigerian-Sicilian pirogi truck that just opened? I hear its breadfruit-jackfruit-eggfruit empanadas are the bomb!”\n\n“Nah, it’s not cold enough yet.”\n\nAnd so it goes.\n\nAre we the only couple who goes through this? Doubtful. At this point in my life I’m convinced EVERY couple on earth goes through this (or some version of this) at least once a week.\n\nAt the grandiose Curtas digs:\n\n….it’s a daily conversation. I kid you not.\n\nBut we have our favorites — old reliables we default to whenever we can’t find inspiration in the new, or are desperate for a tried and true definitive chew.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are a few of my favorite things, restaurant-wise:\n\nBREAKFAST\n\n(Off-menu “Bodega” at Vesta)\n\nWe’re not big on breakfast at our opulent marital abode.…..even though The Food Gal®, like most women, seems to have this odd predilection for wanting to eat something in the morning.\n\nLike every morning.\n\nIn fact, she takes this unreasonable position to extremes, often insisting that something go into her stomach on a regular basis, morning, noon and night. Yours truly, being (like most men), less emotional and more level-headed, encourages her to resist mightily these spasms of silliness. “Breakfast is good for only one thing: thinking about lunch,” we tell her, and once in a while, she listens. Why waste calories on carbo-bombs and caffeine when delectable full meals beckon, only a few hours hence?\n\nBeing of sound mind, she usually bows to this impeccable reasoning and concedes to a morning ritual of coffee at either Bungalow Coffee Co. or Vesta, followed by a discussion of where to have lunch. When she wins the argument, here’s where we end up:\n\nCafe Breizh (for the best French pastries…)\n\nBurgundy Cafe & Bakery (for the best French pastries + great sandwiches + feeling like you’re sitting in Paris – the city, not our ersatz version)\n\nLife’s A Bagel (for the best Bagel in Vegas)\n\nSaginaw’s Deli (for Vegas’s best deli only tourists ever go to….)\n\nLa Vecindad (for chilaquiles – below – which have been scientifically proven to be the best Mexican breakfast on earth):\n\n7th & Carson (for the Full Irish – one Irish breakfast usually being more than enough for two)\n\nPublicUs (a culinary/coffee gem on East Fremont – an incredible success in an unlikely location)\n\nVesta Coffee (exclusively for its “Bodega Sandwich” – see above – which is all you need to start your day, along with one of their high-octane brews)\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\nLUNCH\n\nShe works out by the airport; he works downtown at City Hall. Somehow, they make it work — rendezvous-ing for a midday meal several times a week. He will tell you that, after four decades of intense research, three failed marriages, two nervous breakdowns and thousands of $$$ in alimony, the secret to a happy marriage is having lunch with your spouse at least every other day. Historical records have shown that Mesopotamian sociologists discovered this around the year 3652 B.C..\n\nRelated factoid: Einstein’s fourteenth theory of infidelity relativity has firmly established that regularly having lunch with someone else’s spouse leads to the opposite effect.\n\nI’m a downtown guy so downtown is where we mainly stay….when we’re not heading to Chinatown…which we do at least twice a week. We don’t think about going to the Strip much anymore, because, with a few exceptions, it’s become one giant tourist trap. F**k the Strip (most of it, anyway) with a margarita guitar.\n\nEnough negativity. Here’s where you’ll find us most middays partaking of a palate-pleasing repast:\n\nEsther’s Kitchen:\n\n(You knead to know, Esther’s spreads don’t loaf around.)\n\nNevada Brew Works (strictly for the boffo burgers)\n\nSoulbelly BBQ (Best. BBQ. In. Vegas.)\n\nLetty’s on Main (Get the chicharrones and quesotacos and thank me later.)\n\nCipriani:\n\n(4 words: carb-o-nar-a)\n\nDE Thai Kitchen (for incendiary delights in a teeny tiny space)\n\nShangHai Taste (worth the wait for superior xiao long bao)\n\nXiao Long Dumplings (right across the street from ShangHai, bigger, more varied menu)\n\nPho So 1 (our Vietnamese mainstay)\n\nMatteo’s (Italian that’s too good for tourists):\n\n(Seppia – baby calamari a la plancha at Matteo’s)\n\nEstiatorio Milos (still the best lunch value on the Strip)\n\nNew Asian BBQ (Super busy translates into super-fresh dim sum)\n\nRamen Hashi (for the shoyu ramen lover in you):\n\nRincon Buenos Aires (beef glorious beef, Argentine-style)\n\nRainbow Kitchen (Every Chinese’s favorite it seems, especially on weekends):\n\nLet us finish lunch with some faithful Chinatown friends who never fail us:\n\nDistrict One\n\nYummy Rice\n\nBig Wong\n\nCurry Zen\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nDINNER\n\n(Beef, it’s what’s for dinner)\n\nHere’s where things get tricky. The Las Vegas of 2022 has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to dining out. There are dozens of restaurants we like/love as much (or more) as these, but those below represent our default settings when we can’t agree on the time of day. Some may surprise you Some we only get to once in a blue moon. None of them have ever bored us, even a little, even after dozens of visits. Like a good spouse, they keep us intrigued, even if we’re sampling the goods for the umpteenth time:\n\nBouchon (A bitch to get to, but worth it.)\n\nNoodlehead (when you can’t get into China Mama)\n\nChina Mama (when you want the best Chinese food in town)\n\nJamon Jamon (If this isn’t the best gazpacho you’ve ever tasted, I’ll eat a pound of rancid octopus):\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nSUSHI INTERLUDE\n\nSushi is a “dinner only” thing in America, which is odd since modern sushi began as a quick lunch/street food snack in Japan in the 19th Century. What it’s gained in cache it has lost in accessibility. Even our better izakaya are only open after 5:00 pm. If you’re craving Japanese at noon, your best bet is:\n\nChanko Shabu & Izakaya\n\nAfter work, you’ll find us haunting one of these four joints, mostly, because a fifth favorite (Sushi Hiro ) is too farking far from our ‘hood to hit with any regularity.\n\nHiroyoshi\n\nYu-Or-Mi Sushi\n\nYui Edomae Sushi\n\nIzakaya Go (Need we say more?):\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nSpeaking of “in my ‘hood”, this collection of kebabs and curries is as convenient as it comes:\n\nMt. Everest Indian Cuisine\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nSTEAK BREAK\n\nThe wife loves steak. Perhaps a little too much.\n\n(Tibia honest with you, The Food Gal® often strays from the straight and marrow, which I find fibulous. She says I bone this way out of proportion, which is more than a little humerus.)\n\nWhenever the subject of a big, juicy steak dinner comes up, here’s a typical conversation at Chez Curtas :\n\nMe: “I’m in the mood for a big, juicy steak dinner…”\n\nHer: “Me too, but you can have the meat; I’m in it for the bone (see above) …you know how I get with a big hard one: licking, sucking, gnawing it clean until my face is slick with…”\n\nMe: “Let’s stay in tonight. I have a better idea. “\n\nAssuming our carnivorousness triumphs over the carnal, here’s where we usually end up:\n\nBrezza (Go for the Italian food, stay for the steak.)\n\nCarversteak\n\nCUT\n\nBazaar Meat\n\n8 Oz. Korean Steakhouse\n\nOscar’s Steakhouse\n\nVic & Anthony’s\n\nCapital Grille (Bonus: It’s open for lunch!)\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\nThe last lap — all consistently terrific:\n\nElia Authentic Greek Taverna\n\nSparrow + Wolf (not-a-steakhouse but features one of the best steaks in Vegas – see steak pic above under “Dinner” – along with some incredible veggies.):\n\n(Beware: too much of this great hummus can make you falafal.)\n\nLamaii (Thai + wine heaven)\n\nKhoury’s Mediterranean (Tastier than many a Greek…there, I said it.)\n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>\n\nThis is not to damn many other fine places all over town. We crave Kevin Chong’s food at Japaneiro even though it always feels like driving to Bakersfield to get there. Spring Mountain Road has places popping up every week it seems, but rarely do they seem to have the talent behind them that our old favorites do. There are too many good Italians in town to count (Aromi, Milano, Ferraro’s, Al Solito Posto, D’Agostino’s…) and maybe it’s their ubiquity that keeps them off our regular rotation.\n\nYou’ve no doubt noticed the many favorite and “essential” restaurants are also not listed. As much as we love Kaiseki Yuzu, Raku and Golden Steer, popping into them for a nightly bite is almost impossible in these post-Covid times. Ditto big deal meals like Joël Robuchon, Guy Savoy and ‘e’ by José Andrês.\n\nAnd as long as I’m letting you in on secrets, here’s another one: It takes a whole lot of chef or restaurant to get me interested in trying something new these days. Call it age, jadedness, or whatever, but hauling my carcass out to try someone’s idea of a culinary/business experiment is no longer my idea of fun. It sounds like the height of arrogance to say so, but at this point in my career, I can smell failure from the parking lot. My heart goes out to small business people trying to make a success in this cruel, cruel world, but trying to enlist me in your cause is a waste of time. If you’re any good, I’ll find you. If you’re really good, I will help spread the word to my small audience. They, like me, are not interested in popularity or mediocrity. Our tastes are simple: we simply want the best of everything.\n\nTake us home, Julie:"
