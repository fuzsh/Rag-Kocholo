        "text": "Put me in a room full of chefs and winemakers and I go into overdrive, flitting around like a little foodie social butterfly.\n\nTwo weekends ago I was at the East Meets West weekend at Arrows Restaurant in Ogunquit to celebrate the talents of some great California and East Coast chefs.\n\nOn Saturday, I got to go to a wine dinner and on Sunday, the tent was filled with food, wine and 600 people, many of whom I greeted with air kisses and squeals of \"long time, no see\" and variations on that theme.\n\nAt one point a woman came up to me and said, \"Are you a chef? Everyone knows you!\" No, ma'am. I'm not a chef. I'm a food writer. I'm a food writer who doesn't just sit in my office typing up recipes or experimenting with cilantro in my kitchen, although that's a part of it all. I'm a food writer who meets and greets, schmoozes and networks (not in a smarmy way, I hope).\n\nI'm the food writer who Homaro Cantu from Chicago's Moto (seen on the cover of this month's Gourmet Magazine) googled while I dined in his restaurant and then served me my dessert personally. I will walk into a kitchen and snoop. Yes, I hobnob. I go out and find the folks who count in the food world just for you, Wine Me Dine Me readers. OK, sure, for me too. I admit it, it's a blast! Who doesn't want to talk to the greatest talents in the food and drink world?\n\nEven better than hobnobbing is shameless namedropping combined with describing some great food and wine. I think I'll call that \"dishdropping.\" So here goes.\n\nFirst, I barged into the kitchen at Arrows' on Saturday night to meet Marc Vetri of Vetri Restaurant in Philadelphia (named number 25 out of 50 best restaurants this year by Gourmet Magazine -- Arrows is 14) and to let him know I couldn't get a table at his restaurant on the night before I fly to China from Philly (more on that in a few weeks). I have a reservation now! Score! Was it the eyelash batting?\n\nThen I went down into the pastry kitchen to say \"hi\" to Chef Jim Dodge, one of my favorite people in the biz who gave me a bite of chocolate almond torte with cr?me fraiche and raspberries before anyone else got some.\n\nThen it was up to the lawn where we sipped champagne and nibbled hors d'oeuvres made by the very dashing Taite Pearson from Wolfgang Puck's Spago in Vegas and Marc Djozlija from Puck's Atlantic City restaurant, American Grille. Mmmm a quail egg sunny side up on a crunchy brioche with bacon and black truffle. Ohhhh, blue fin tuna with sticky rice, sweet soy and shiso.\n\nIt was on to dinner and I got to sit at the cool kids' table (in my eyes. I'm sure there were other cool tables) with the lively winemakers Adam LaZarre from Hahn and Billy Grant from Four Vines as in Biker Zin and Naked Chardonnay. They're wild. We saw pictures of Adam's goat while we ate an excellent roasted baby goat with soft polenta from Chef Vetri. We were the first in the nation to try Hahn's new Pinot Noir. I sat next to Bill's mom who owns a bed and breakfast in Ogunquit called Almost Home and across from Vivian Lacroix, wife of Chef Jean Marie Lacroix of Philadelphia's Lacroix at The Rittenhouse (very, very good), who made a crispy brik of black bass and conger eel with smoked maitake mushrooms, Kaffir lime \"fluff\" and organic pea shoots. I saw his chefs out in the lovely garden picking veggies earlier in the day.\n\nAnd that's just part of the Saturday dinner, where once again I sat next to Gene Burns, the San Francisco radio personality who used to be in Boston. He broadcasted his show from The Village Market in Ogunquit that day. When I asked him if he'd dined at Manresa in Los Gatos (number 42 on the Gourmet list) he good-naturedly exclaimed, \"Have I been there?! Of course! Eric Ripert of La Bernadin recommended it!\"\n\n'Nuff said.\n\nGood restaurant. And nice namedrop!\n\nThe next day was the big food fair where Rebecca Charles of Pearl Oyster Bar in New York City (mentioned last season on \"The Sopranos\") made chowder and lobster rolls and Browne Trading from Portland brought tons of excellent caviar and salmon. Chef Melissa Kelley from Primo brought rare tuna with a romesco sauce (spicy!) and her partner pastry chef Price Kushner fried feather light beignets in a huge wok, put them in little paper bags and dusted them with powdered sugar.\n\nKathy Gunst, who wrote the new Stonewall Kitchen Favorites cook book, was there with the SK founders Jim Stott and Jonathan King dishing up tiny salmon cakes and the Arrows' staff made a Vietnamese noodle soup to order with veggies and hot or sweet sauce. Chefs from Wheatleigh in Lennox, Mass., made saut?ed chicken oysters, the part where the backbone and thigh meet and that everyone throws away.\n\nThere was plenty of wine from not only Hahn and Four Vines but many others as well. Everyone -- keep this Sunday afternoon event on your radar for next year -- it's only $15 and a great afternoon of sampling food from some of the best chefs on the East or West Coast.\n\nOh, did I mention I love my work? Must get to the gym soon. Bye!\n\nTHE DISH\n\nThe grand opening of the Seacoast School of Technology's Julia Restaurant, a student-run lunch spot at the school is Thursday, Oct. 12. The theme is Fall Harvest and you can go to to see the menus for each week. It's a great way to sample some great food and help out the student chefs (it's inexpensive too!). Call 775-8573 for reservations.\n\nCalling all Seacoast chefs! Win $500 and a year's supply of tea, courtesy of the Portsmouth Tea Company, by creating a great recipe using tea! Simply submit your original appetizer, entr?e or dessert recipe(s) by Oct. 20 and a panel of local independent restaurateurs and chefs will review all entries. Eligible recipes must use at least one type of tea (black, white, Oolong, green, fruit tisane, Rooibos or herbal blends).\n\nFive finalists will be selected and will move on to the final round. On Nov. 2 at 6 p.m. the finalists will prepare their recipe at Attrezzi in Portsmouth and a panel of judges will select a winner. Pre-preparation is allowed, but all recipes must be ready to demonstrate in 30-minutes on the day of the event. Local amateurs as well as professional cooks are encouraged to participate with no limit on the number of recipes that can be submitted per person. Your original recipe must accompany the contest entry.\n\nRachel Forrest is a former restaurant owner who lives in Exeter. Her column appears Wednesdays in iT.
