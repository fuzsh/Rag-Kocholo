        "text": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Interim Union Budget 2024-25 in Parliament today. This was the current government’s last budget ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha polls and FM Sitharaman’s sixth overall.\n\nSince a new government will take over later this year, a full budget will be presented post elections by the next finance ministry.\n\nThe interim budget focused on areas like infrastructure, agriculture, green energy and railways while maintaining fiscal prudence. However, income tax slabs were left unchanged.\n\nThis is how India’s leading founders, entrepreneurs, business owners, policy makers and economists reacted:\n\nMr. Dinesh Khara, Chairman, SBI\n\n“The interim budget has laid out an affirmative action of fiscal glide path towards 4.5% in FY26. The heartening news is that the anticipated tax buoyancy in FY24 excluding the outlier pandemic year is the highest in 7 years. This apart, the budget has laid out reinforced architecture of Big possibilities, creating an all-encompassing action-oriented roadmap to embark upon an arduous yet rewarding journey for each and every Indian, chiefly the fringe and hitherto vulnerable masses, entrepreneurs, agripreneurs and women, making them an equity holder in Viksit Bharat.”\n\nMr. George Alexander Muthoot, MD, Muthoot Finance\n\nFM’s interim budget is balanced from the point of view of adhering to fiscal prudence, boosting infrastructure growth and prioritizing focus on four key sections of the economy – the poor, women, youth and farmers. We believe the FM’s focus on higher outlay for infrastructure will help in boosting the broader economy and in the long term will boost investment activity. The government’s support to MSMEs, women entrepreneurs and the agricultural sector aptly aligns with our aim to provide credit support to MSMEs, small business owners, farmers and women entrepreneurs thereby addressing their economic needs. FM’s focus on addressing housing challenges by building two crore additional homes under the PM Awas Yojana-Grameen is certainly positive for boosting the housing sector. While inflation has been a concern globally, FM’s focus on staying on the path of fiscal prudence in the interim budget, will surely be an enabler for stable interest rate scenario in the economy and bodes well for the overall financial sector.\n\nDebashis Chatterjee, MD & CEO, LTIMindtree\n\nWe welcome the interim budget’s focus on skilling, deeptech, R&D, innovation, and digital infrastructure, all of which are critical drivers for the IT industry’s growth. The Skill India Mission has helped in building a highly skilled workforce, and the Rs. 1 lakh crore corpus with interest-free loans for tech-savvy youth will be a true game-changer. This will fuel innovation and entrepreneurship, fostering the next generation of tech leaders. As we strive towards achieving the goal of “Viksit Bharat” by 2047, LTIMindtree stands committed to partnering with the government in its digital transformation journey. We believe this interim budget has laid a strong foundation for continued growth, with technology playing a pivotal role in shaping India’s future.”\n\nNandini Mansingka, CEO of Mumbai Angels\n\nThe Union Budget announced looks very promising to see long-term investments with a significant increase in capital expenditure with initiatives in EV, agricultural tech, and logistics industry. The government is taking technology adoption across various sectors and usage very seriously and looking at ways technology can benefit everyone, also by providing a corpus of Rs 1 lk cr will be established with 50 yr interest-free loan tech-savvy growth.\n\nAmit Khatri, Co-Founder, Noise\n\n“The Interim Union Budget 2024 presented by FM Nirmala Sitharaman reflects the Government’s undeterred focus on inclusive growth. The focus on boosting employability through training and skill development, along with the significant support to foster the entrepreneurial spirit of Indian youth through 43 crore loans amounting to Rs. 22.5 lakh Crore, is indeed a commendable step towards pushing India’s growth at the global stage. These reforms encourage us to work towards India’s vision to become a developed nation by 2047 through enhanced capability and empowerment.\n\nBeing a homegrown brand, we believe that the initiatives like PM Mudra Yojana & Start Up India will play a crucial role in catalysing the growth of the startup ecosystem in India and eventually further strengthen the ‘Make in India’ efforts. We appreciate the economic policies adopted to foster growth, improve productivity, increase opportunity, and fulfill aspirations through strategic technological advancements. Driven by the vision of Vikasit and Aatmanirbhar Bharat, we look forward to actively participating in the nation’s journey towards global prominence and innovation leadership.”\n\nMr. Vetri Subramanian, Chief Investment Officer, UTI AMC\n\n“This is a judicious interim budget. The degree of fiscal consolidation with a target of 5.1% in FY25 is more than anticipated and is positive for softening of bond yields. Further the reiteration of the fiscal target for FY26 gives the bond market medium term visibility. The consolidation impacts expenditure including capex by the government.\n\nThe tax estimates appear reasonable and the stability in tax provisions is welcome. The government has done the heavy lifting during the post pandemic period and is now passing the baton to the other players in the economy. As regards FY25 we would expect more policy direction to emerge when the full budget is presented later this year.”\n\nSusanne Pulverer, CEO and CSO (Chief Sustainability Officer), IKEA India\n\n“We welcome the positive strides taken by the Indian government in the Interim Budget. The focus on manufacturing, youth, skilling and women empowerment is truly commendable and will pave the way for a more inclusive growth and economy. The emphasis on making energy security and infrastructure for green mobility accessible and affordable for the many people resonates with IKEA’s sustainability vision. We believe that the government has only furthered the country’s resolve for a Viksit Bharat.”\n\nRequest you to kindly incorporate Susanne’s views about the Union Budget 2024 in case you are working on any budget related stories.\n\nMr. Ajit Venkataraman, MD, Finolex Industries Ltd.\n\n“We applaud Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman for presenting a visionary Interim Budget 2024, setting the stage for an inclusive development. The significant focus on infrastructure and housing, especially the PM Awas Yojana Grameen, achieving 3 crore houses and planning 2 crore more in the next 5 years, resonates with Finolex Industries’ commitment to sustainable communities. The farmer-centric initiatives like PM Kisan Samman Yojana and PM Fasal Bima Yojana showcase the government’s dedication to our ‘Anna Data’. Finolex Industries anticipates these initiatives to have a positive impact and looks forward to participating in these transformative initiatives, reinforcing our belief in a prosperous and empowered India by 2047.”\n\nSindhu Gangadharan, SVP and MD, SAP Labs India; Vice Chairperson, Nasscom\n\n“The Interim Budget 2024 is reflective of the India’s sustained focus on Atma Nirbhar Bharat (Self Reliant India). The long-term financing and re-financing scheme with a corpus of INR 100,000 Cr with a 50-year interest free loan to promote R&D in the private sector in sunrise domains, as well dedicated initiatives to promote DeepTech/R&D in the defence sector underscore the commitment to position India as a global leader in the world of technology. The focus on skilling, upskilling, and reskilling of youth will ensure an industry-ready workforce to navigate the headwinds of a volatile marketplace.\n\nAdditionally, the extension of tax exemptions for eligible startups, granting newly incorporated ventures until March 2025 to claim tax benefits for three out of their first 10 years, is a progressive and encouraging move. By incentivizing entrepreneurship, the government is actively promoting the creation of a robust startup ecosystem, which is crucial for driving economic development.”\n\nMr Manoj Nair, Head of India GDC, Fujitsu India\n\n“We welcome India’s Union Budget 2024-25 unveiled today and applaud the Indian Government for putting digitalization, inclusive and sustainable development, and enhanced capabilities and contribution to the generation of resources to power investments at the core. As the demand for tech talent surges, the Government’s Skill India Mission has played a pivotal role in stemming the talent gap in the IT industry. With 1.4 crore youth upskilled and reskilled the announcement of higher learning institutions including IITs and IIMs will help India address the AI skill crunch and bridge the gap effectively. Additionally, the Government’s corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore with a 50-year interest-free loan will encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovation significantly in sunrise domains. This will be a big boost for tech-savvy youth and help the Nation strengthen capabilities in the deep tech sector. The government’s continued focus on EV ecosystem is indeed a pragmatic step forward and will continue to help India succeed in achieving its long-term decarbonization objectives. This is an exciting time for the country’s green industrial and economic transition. At Fujitsu, we are committed to providing sustainable transformation and supporting green growth and we shall continue as strong partners in helping the nation in its journey towards net-zero!”\n\nRavi Kunwar, Vice President – India & APAC at HMD Global (The Home of Nokia Phones)\n\n“The Interim Budget is forward-looking and represents the remarkable evolution of India’s mobile and telecom landscape in the last decade, standing true to our expectations. The allocation towards the development of electronics manufacturing clusters unlocks the accessibility of high-quality technology for varied consumers, including those at the bottom of the pyramid. Additionally, the proposal to further provide relief in customs duty on the import of battery covers, main lenses, back covers, and mechanical items will boost the Make in India initiation and solidify the mobile manufacturing ecosystem in the country.\n\nThis reduction, coupled with the establishment of a one-lakh-crore corpus supported by a fifty-year interest-free loan, will empower the private sector to significantly advance research and innovation in sunrise domains. Despite the industry’s growth, there is substantial room for expansion in India, and we are optimistic that supportive government policies, infrastructure investments, and a vibrant innovation ecosystem will unleash the next wave of digital transformation.”\n\nKami Viswanathan, President – MEISA, FedEx Express\n\n“The 2024 interim budget’s increased capital expenditure for infrastructure development is a strategic and commendable move. It promises to accelerate economic growth and positively impact the logistics sector. The emphasis on expanding air connectivity, along with the development of existing airports and the establishment of new ones, is a pivotal step that aligns with our advocacy for efficient multimodal logistics.\n\nThe government’s commitment to the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan, is encouraging. These initiatives aim to enhance logistics efficiency and reduce costs, aligning with our objectives of service excellence and innovation in logistics. Additionally, the ‘Amrit Kaal’ initiative, which focuses on empowering MSMEs and boosting their global competitiveness, is set to benefit the broader logistics sector.\n\nFedEx welcomes the forward-looking approach of the 2024 interim budget, reflective of the ‘Viksit Bharat’ vision. We remain committed to actively contributing to India’s growth journey, aligning our efforts with the government’s vision for a smarter and more sustainable logistics infrastructure in India.”\n\nMr. Anil G Verma, Executive Director and CEO, Godrej & Boyce:\n\nThe Interim Budget 2024 is extremely well thought of and clearly a step towards the vision of Developed India @ 2047. The FM has stayed away from populist measures in an election year and needs to be congratulated for the same.\n\nBy limiting the deficit to 5.1% of the GDP which should be achievable given the rather conservative tax receipts, fiscal prudence has been given the due importance. Lower borrowings and thus lower borrowing costs will help prioritize domestic spends and guard against external shocks.\n\nThe increased capital expenditure of Rs 11.11L Cr, constituting 3.4% of the GDP, bodes well for the infrastructure led GDP growth and will also crowd in the private sector investments as we are now witnessing improvements in consumer sentiments (and demand).\n\nThe focus on sustainability through rooftop solarization, adoption of E-buses, capacity enhancements in renewable energy and coal gasification are a must, given the impact of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe continuation of emphasis on women, youth, farmers, and the underprivileged through skilling and welfare measures and financial assistance under PM-KISAN is to be lauded. This will ensure that India moves forward as a whole.\n\nMr. Rampraveen Swaminathan, Managing Director and CEO of Mahindra Logistics Ltd:\n\n“The Union Budget 2024’s pivotal focus on infrastructure development, aligns seamlessly with our vision for enhanced logistics efficiency. The government’s commendable commitment to supporting EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure is a significant stride towards sustainable mobility. We appreciate and commend the government’s efforts towards Green Energy, aligned with the Nation’s commitment for ‘net-zero’ by 2070.\n\nThe announcement of three major economic railway corridor programs, spanning energy, mineral, and cement corridors, port connectivity corridors, and high-traffic density corridors under the PM Gati Shakti initiative, is poised to be transformative. These corridors not only promise to decongest high-traffic areas but also elevate the safety and speed of passenger trains. The integration of dedicated freight corridors is poised to catalyse GDP growth and significantly reduce logistics costs.\n\nWith an increased outlay in FY25 and the expedited development of various infrastructure projects, the government’s proactive approach is set to spur economic growth. The India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor announcement is particularly game-changing, strategically positioning India on the global trade map. We at Mahindra Logistics, eagerly anticipates actively participating in and benefiting from these initiatives, ushering in positive transformations in the logistics and transportation sector.”\n\nMr. Abhinav Jain, Co-Founder & CEO, Almonds AI.\n\n“Government’s forward-looking budget aligns remarkably well with the impetus required for the AI and technology sectors. The focus on digital infrastructure lays a robust foundation for innovation, and the commitment to skill development among youth mirrors the mission to empower the next generation with AI capabilities. The support for electric vehicles and clean energy initiatives resonate with the Green Loyalty Program, reinforcing belief in sustainable technological advancement. This budget not only catalyzes a tech-driven economy but also heralds a golden era for companies like ours at the intersection of AI and market technology. We are eager to contribute to this transformative journey and commend the government’s vision for a tech-empowered, inclusive growth trajectory.”\n\nDr Mayank Aggarwal, MBBS, MD, DrNB. medical oncologist at Venkateshwar hospital, New Delhi.\n\nCervical cancer ranks as the second most prevalent cancer in Indian women, following breast cancer, and is associated with substantial death rates. The recent declaration by the finance minister to enhance preventive measures through HPV vaccination is a laudable initiative. Coupled with increased awareness, this endeavor is certain to contribute significantly to reducing the disease burden and improving healthcare in our nation. Moreover, HPV vaccination will play a role in lowering the incidence of other cancers, such as head and neck, anal cancer, and various gynecological cancers.\n\nSunil Sharma, Vice President- Sales, Sophos India & SAARC\n\n“We at Sophos are in complete alignment with the vision presented by the Honorable Finance Minister in the Interim Union Budget 2024, towards creating a prosperous and inclusive India. The highlighted emphasis on skill development, technology-driven innovation, and sustainable infrastructure resonates with our organizational mission, focused on empowering Indian businesses through state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions. The government’s steadfast commitment to increasing the cybersecurity budget from INR 400 crores to INR 750 crores within a year is a noteworthy development within the industry, and promises to address cybersecurity threats that may endanger the rapidly digitizing nation.\n\nThe intersection of democracy, demography, and diversity, encapsulated by the ideology of “Sabka Prayas,” emerges as the key force that will unlock India’s true potential in the technology sector. Other significant initiatives such as the allocation of a substantial amount of Rs 1 lakh crore for tech startups and the strategic emphasis on deep-tech for defense, underscore the government’s dedication towards realizing its Atmanirbhar Bharat vision.\n\nWithin this transformative landscape, Sophos remains unwavering in its commitment to playing a constructive role in realizing the vision of a cyber-secure India. Our dedication extends to equipping businesses with resilient cybersecurity solutions and nurturing a culture of cyber awareness, thereby contributing to the empowerment of citizens and the assurance of our digital future.”\n\nMr Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, MD & CEO, Bandhan Bank\n\n“The interim budget focuses extensively on inclusive development and is a step forward in the $5 trillion economy aspirations of the nation. The focus on housing sector will benefit a range or peripheral sectors like cements, paints and, steel, among others, and create employment opportunities. The focus on women empowerment will further boost the economy. The emphasis on infrastructure and rural development will lay a strong foundation for India’s growth story.”\n\nSachin Panicker, Chief AI Officer, Fulcrum Digital\n\n“Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s sixth consecutive budget presentation sets a decisive course for India’s future, rooted in the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. The government’s emphasis on GDP – Governance, Development, and Performance, lays a sturdy framework for sustainable growth. With a focus on empowering youth and fostering innovation, the budget outlines a roadmap for unprecedented development over the next five years.\n\nIn addition, initiatives like the Skill India Mission, training, upskilling and reskilling 1.4 crore youth and establishing new educational institutions, reflect a commitment to human capital development and digital empowerment.\n\nAt Fulcrum Digital, we stand ready to leverage deep technology and the power of our youth to continue to create opportunities for India at a global level. As a global enterprise AI organization, we are committed to contributing to India’s growth story, and fostering innovation for heightened development.”\n\nDr. Hari Shankar Shyam,Chairperson-Executive Education at Sharda School of Business Studies Sharda University\n\nI am delighted to see the substantial allocation of funds for 50 year interest free loans to tech savvy youths. This will help our economy to produce many unicorns in near future and many youths will take the path of entrepreneurship. At the same time this fund will be utilised for developing various technical products indigenously which will help our economy to become trillion dollar economy. It will also help in reducing our fiscal deficit as IT related exports will increase and there is a substantial reduction in depending on imports. This fund will become boon for many incubators for startup’s across the country.\n\nDr. Kulneet Suri Senior Director, IMS Noida, Adjunct Professor-Harvard University(T.H.Chan School of Public Healthcare) Harvard University, HKS Alumna\n\nWhile the temporary budget serves as a bridge until the formation of a new government after the elections, the budget unveiled several noteworthy initiatives aimed at boosting economic growth and promoting social welfare. Though the interim budget discusses Technology & Innovation, Women empowerment, healthcare the focus must routed by embracing Al. Looking ahead the trends of AI in 2024 this is the year AI will move from the testing to the macro-implementation stages be it any Industry and especially the retail industry. With Microsoft announcing “AI Copilot key” for laptops there is a stronger indication that AI will further enter the consumer mainstream in 2024 and therefore India should also prepare by Intentional investments in teaching new skills, collaborative development and deployment of AI. On-line learning must be promoted to reach out to youth in the Tier 2-3 cities to shape a future of equitable learning and enable a learn and work ecosystem. An upbeat policy implementation for the higher Education sector to foster academics will help build an equitable economic advancement.\n\nMr. Anand Dubey, CEO, Indkal Technologies\n\n“We applaud the Finance Minister for the astute measures taken in the budget to enhance the financial sector’s size, capacity, skills, and regulatory framework. These initiatives are pivotal in fortifying the foundation of our economy. Additionally, the commitment to ensuring energy security for businesses across sectors is commendable, providing a robust foundation for sustained economic growth. We look forward to leveraging these enhancements to further contribute to the nation’s progress and prosperity.”\n\nArchana Surana , Director and Founder of Arch College of Design and Business Jaipur\n\nThe Union Budget’s steadfast emphasis on strengthening infrastructure for higher education and skill development is instrumental in preparing India’s youth for the workforce of tomorrow. With a forward-looking approach, initiatives such as the establishment of 390 new universities and the implementation of skill development programs benefiting over 2 million young individuals underscore the government’s commitment to nurturing a skilled workforce.\n\nOne particularly promising aspect is the noteworthy improvement in female enrollment in higher education, which has surged by an impressive 28%. This surge not only signifies a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape but also heralds a significant boost to gender diversity in various industries.\n\nAlso, 30 crore Mudra Yojana loans given to women entrepreneurs is a welcoming scheme.\n\nThese strategic investments are laying the groundwork for a more robust and dynamic economy. By equipping the youth with relevant skills and knowledge, the budget is fostering a generation of job-ready professionals capable of meeting the demands of an evolving marketplace. Moreover, the expansion of educational institutions and skill development initiatives promises to address the longstanding gap between industry requirements and available talent, thus driving innovation and productivity across sectors.\n\nAs these initiatives continue to unfold, their impact on the industry and economy is poised to be substantial, with the youth of India emerging as key contributors to the nation’s growth story.\n\nPuneet Gupta, Vice President & Managing Director, NetApp India/SAARC\n\n“The Interim Union Budget 2024 focuses on data-driven innovation, and this gives us much to look forward to. The Honourable Finance Minister has acknowledged the potential of deep technologies like AI in transforming varied industry sectors. In addition, the GoI’s focus on training, upskilling, and reskilling the youth of the nation through the Skill India mission is likely to place India well on the global map of tech-savvy nations. With India’s tech prowess growing, we expect the need for unified storage and intelligent data infrastructures to grow as well. Harnessing the power of data will be a key growth driver and differentiator for businesses across sectors. At NetApp, we are aligned with the government’s focus, with innovation in data management being at the heart of everything we do. Combined with the capabilities of our tech talent, particularly the youth, we are well poised to contributing towards building a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047.”\n\nMr. Rajat Goel, Co-Founder of Eye-Q, Super Speciality Eye Hospital\n\nIn line with the government’s commitment to health, the announcement of extending Ayushman Bharat coverage to Anganwadi and Asha workers, and consolidating maternal and child healthcare schemes, marks a commendable step towards a more inclusive healthcare system. Notably, the allocation of a 1-lakh crore corpus with 50-year interest-free financing for R&D will encourage the tech-savvy youth, signalling a golden era of entrepreneurship. However, we note a missed opportunity in addressing the critical needs of the eye care industry. Taking into account the demands of eye care stakeholders would have contributed to approaching the World Health Organization’s goal of reducing blindness to 0.3% of the population, especially considering India’s current figure of 0.36%.\n\nMr. Gaurav Balani, DGM-Marketing, Infiniti Mall\n\n“The insights unveiled by the Union Budget 2024 indeed project a favorable growth trajectory for the economy and display the remarkable performance of the nation throughout the years. An increase in the average income of people by 50% is a significant milestone and we expect it to positively impact retail sales, leading to an increase in customer willingness to spend on shopping, recreation and leisure. Further, the presence of a dedicated freight corridor, together with the three economic corridor programmes under the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan will help us reduce logistic costs and elevate efficiency while serving customers. We further hope for the moderate inflation period to be monitored and maintained at minimal levels to ensure sustainable growth. Lastly, the introduction of an increase in threshold for presumptive taxation for retail businesses from INR 2 crore to INR 3 crore is a well-appreciated move and will assist in achieving higher revenue figures.”\n\nMadhusudan Ekambaram, Co-founder and CEO of KreditBee\n\n“I applaud the government’s steadfast commitment to fostering comprehensive and inclusive development. Initiatives such as PM Mudra Yojana, Fund of Funds, Startup India, and Startup Credit Guarantee Schemes are effectively nurturing the entrepreneurial spirit nationwide. It is truly inspiring to witness a visionary approach that extends beyond mere economic growth, with a goal to transform India into a Viksit Bharat by 2047. The proposed measures, including tax reductions, specialized support for developing industries, and augmented infrastructure spending in the forthcoming Budget 2024, are encouraging signs for the future, reflecting a collective endeavor towards sustainability, growth, and innovation within India’s dynamic startup ecosystem.\n\nThe reinforcement of the financial sector has significantly enhanced the efficiency of savings, credit, and investments. Ensuring timely and ample financial support, leveraging relevant technologies, and providing appropriate training for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are pivotal policy priorities for the government. This strategy aims not only to foster their growth but also to enhance their global competitiveness. Aligning the regulatory environment to facilitate the expansion of MSMEs will be a crucial aspect of this comprehensive policy framework.”\n\nMs. Aparna Acharekar, Co-Founder, coto.\n\n“At coto, we are pleased with the Union Budget 2024’s emphasis on women’s welfare and empowerment, which closely aligns with coto’s vision and mission. The introduction of strong policies in the favour of women across socio-economic groups undeniably leads to long-term economic growth. The startup ecosystem is also gradually witnessing a rise in women entrepreneurs and their ownership stakes within organizations.\n\nWe also share the strong belief that this is a golden era for tech-savvy youth. We hope that more women will be inspired by this to enroll in science courses and pursue STEM-related employment. This not only promises a stronger representation of women in traditionally male-dominated fields but also offers them greater opportunities for financial independence through these careers. An increased presence of women in scientific professions can contribute to addressing pressing issues pertaining to mental health, which are highly relevant in today’s world.”\n\nMs. Sakshi Bakshi, CEO of EPIA (Healthcare)\n\nWe had bucketed our aspirations prior to the budget into several categories, and it is heartening to see that the government checked at least some of them. The FM’s commitment to women’s health shines through the extension of Ayushman Bharat and the consolidation of maternal and child healthcare schemes. The surge in women’s enrolment in STEM courses is a positive leap, and the expanded ‘Lakhpati Didi’ initiative showcases a commitment to economic empowerment of women at grassroots level. Importantly, the allocation of a 1-lakh crore corpus for interest-free long-term financing demonstrates a dedication to fostering private sector R&D. This strategic move has the potential to open doors for women, allowing them to assume pivotal roles in shaping the future of technology, science, and engineering.\n\nDeepak Kaushik, Regional Practice Head – App & Data Modernization, Insight Enterprises\n\n“The Interim budget contains numerous forward-looking elements, particularly in recognising the transformative role of data and modern technology on both individuals as well as businesses. One lakh crore corpus with a fifty-year interest-free loan would be a game changer specifically for the tech-savvy youth. This significant influx of funds has the potential to usher in an era of unparalleled opportunity and will undoubtedly act as a driving force for private-sector innovation. The synergy between our domestic industry’s strengths and the government’s smart outlook on global potential has paved the way for a favourable environment for exceptional growth in the IT sector.”\n\nMayuresh Raut, Co-founder & Managing Partner, Seafund\n\n“The scheme for deeptech in defence will not only help the government start addressing the Make in Bharat initiative through indigenous technologies in defence but also unlock these technologies to other civilian uses. Deeptech focused funds like ours will definitely benefit from enabling initiatives like this.\n\nThe solar rooftop schemes will be a big boost to not only meet our goals for clean energy, but will also set up India to start addressing the EV charging infrastructure that is currently holding back wider adoption of EVs. It will also create enormous jobs for installation, manufacturing and maintenance of solar infrastructure and a secondary effect will be opportunities available for startups to build on this.\n\nExtension of tax benefits for sovereign wealth funds expiring on 31st March 24 to 31st March 25 is a good signal from the government to indicate that there will be continuation of beneficial policies and friendly institutional investor policies”\n\nVinesh Menon, CEO – Human Development & Social Impact Solutions, Ampersand Group\n\n“The union budget has been tabled as expected as ‘Vote on Account’ budget and has set the expectations for driving VIKSIT Bharat at 2047. I am particularly excited about the PM shri schools program & the Nep 2020 Execution and the vision to have more girl children enrolled fot STEM programs. My only wish is that we add a 5th caste along with Garib, Mahila, Yuva & Annadata and that is ” Baccha “…as there is a lot more we need to do for the 300 plus million pre school and school going children in the country. Overall, with emphasis on technology, innovation and upgradation of angamwadis, it looks like an exciting decade ahead”\n\nRavin Saluja, director with STERLING AGRO INDUSTRIES LIMITED( Nova Dairy Products )\n\n“At Nova Dairy, we are dedicated to helping dairy farmers across India through a comprehensive program to improve productivity and sustainability in the dairy business. Building on the fulfillment of existing programs such as the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, the National Livestock Mission, and the Dairy and Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Funds, we seek to formulate a cohesive approach that utilizes these initiatives to maximum effect.\n\nAs Nova Dairy, we believe that the current GST rate of 12% on milk products is a significant challenge for the dairy industry and the private sector. While milk is an essential part of daily nutrition for millions of people, the high GST rate adds to the financial burden on both consumers and producers. By reducing the GST rate to 5%, the government can not only alleviate the GST burden but also promote the health and well-being of the general public. This reduction would make dairy products more affordable and accessible to a larger segment of the population, especially those from lower-income backgrounds. Additionally, it would incentivize dairy companies to invest in quality and innovation, ultimately benefiting the entire dairy ecosystem. We urge policymakers to consider this adjustment to the GST rate as a crucial step towards supporting the dairy industry’s growth and ensuring the health and nutrition of the nation.”\n\nMr. Amit Kapoor, Co-founder and CEO, Eupheus Learning\n\n“As the Interim Budget for 2024-25 unfolds, we welcome the notable 6.1% increase in the schooling outlay, with a substantial Rs 4,200 crore boost in the School Education Budget, and a significant allocation of Rs 6,000 crore to the PM SHRI program, marking a remarkable 50% surge from the previous year. This underscores a dedicated focus on enhancing the quality of school education including digitalization. While we await the full-fledged budget post the upcoming elections, these initial steps are encouraging notes for the education sector to partner with edtech companies like ours.”\n\nMr. Gaurav Goel, CEO, Toprankers\n\n“In light of the recent Union Budget and FM’s announcements, we’re heading towards transformative changes in education. With Skill India Mission successfully upskilling 1.4 crore youth and establishing 3000 new ITIs, alongside the inauguration of prestigious institutions, the education landscape is evolving. Notably, the surge in female enrollment, particularly in STEM at 43%, highlights our dedication to inclusivity and innovation.\n\nThis shall have a profound impact on the education industry. Together, we stride towards a future where opportunity knows no bounds.”\n\nDr. Kavita Pathak, Director Jaipuria institute of management. Lucknow\n\n“The interim budget spells out four thrust priorities, i.e. women, farmers, poor and youth; therefore a thrust on start-ups, support to farming communities and encouraging use of solar panels by offering 100 units of free power. Adding 1 crore additional lakhapati didis promises to bolster women empowerment within the SHG framework. Overall nothing out of the ordinary and mostly supportive of the government’s overarching vision.”\n\nDr Arvind Chaturvedi – Pro Vice Chancellor and Director, School of Management, IILM University\n\n“The Interim Union Budget 2024, presented by the Honourable Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, places significant emphasis on women empowerment and housing.”\n\n“Ensuring every homeless individual has a home within the next five years delivers a major boost to the country’s infrastructure and is a laudable initiative. The government’s commitment to an inclusive society was also evident during the Republic Day parade, where women were given preeminence. Overall, the budget reflects the Narendra Modi government’s commitment to women’s development and progress.”\n\nMayank Bhatnagar, Co-founder and COO, FinEdge\n\n“Overall a balanced budget considering it is a ‘vote on account’. Tight fiscal consolidation with a view on future growth of the economy is a big positive. All eyes will be on the main budget in July to see a more detailed plan on growth and development plan over the next 5 years.”\n\nHimanshu Kohli, Co-founder, Client Associates\n\n“This budget reflects a commendable focus on fiscal responsibility, with the fiscal deficit pegged at 5.1% for FY25, a move towards increased Capex spending, and a shift away from excessive subsidies. The brevity of the speech suggests either an interim measure paving the way for a comprehensive budget in July or a vote of confidence in the current state of affairs. It reaffirms the notion that significant announcements can transcend the budget, showcasing a government committed to prudent fiscal management and consistent economic growth.”\n\nDr. Narendra Vankar, Founder and CEO, Quantum CorpHealth\n\n“This fiscal year’s interim budget, which covers a wide range of areas and lays out specific actions to be carried out, is a demonstration of the government’s progressive thinking. We applaud the government’s dedication to bolstering the healthcare industry, with a particular emphasis on building a strong system for today’s contemporary India.\n\nIt is very appreciated that girls between the ages of 9 and 14 will now receive cervical cancer vaccinations in schools, as stated by Hon. Finance Minister Nirmala Seetharaman. By focusing on nutrition delivery as a component of early childhood care and development, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 will contribute to the creation of a healthy community. With the kind of components being combined to make health the most reliable foundation of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the Indian government is providing strong assistance to the healthcare industry. We anticipate some more encouraging announcements with the planned outline in the coming months, which will help the industry grow even more and thrive in a more improved manner.”\n\nMr. Harshit Jain, Co-Founder and CEO, OnePlay\n\n“By focusing on initiatives like Skill India, the budget reflects the government’s dedication to make our youth skilled and inculcate a sense of entrepreneurship, closely resonating with the values we share at OnePlay. With this, the budget presents not just an opportunity to contribute to technological progress but also a means to attract a fresh wave of talented individuals while also ensuring skills development. As we move forward, let’s focus on empowering the youth in entrepreneurship, scaling up research in the sunrise sectors, and building the necessary physical, economic and digital infrastructure for a developed India by 2047.”\n\nMr. Anurag Mittal, Head of Fixed Income\n\n“The budget is distinctly positive for fixed income market. The budget continued its push on public capex while balancing fiscal responsibility. The fiscal deficit target of 5.1% for FY25 was below all consensus estimate & the most positive aspect was gross borrowing number of 14.1 trillion well below market estimates of 15-15.2 trillion.”\n\nJaya Vaidhyanathan, CEO, BCT Digital\n\nThe budget presented was on expected lines. Being a vote-on-account, there were no major announcements, but at the same time it provided a clear overview of India’s economic trajectory and the government’s dedication to development through targeted schemes.\n\nRevenue receipts for the year exceeding budget estimates, robust growth in GST collections, and a fiscal deficit at 5.8% of GDP – lower than anticipated – all indicate robust economic growth. This is bolstered by the formalization of the economy, which will have a positive impact on the banking system that lends to the formal economy. Further, despite the huge amount of welfare measures in place, the strong revenue figures have kept the fiscal deficit in check – estd at 5.1% in FY25 and on track for 4.5% by FY26 .\n\nSignificant capital expenditure growth of over 11% this year, accounting for 3.4% of GDP, underlines the focus on key areas like railway infrastructure and green energy. This is expected to transform the country while also ensuring employment generation to harness demographic dividend. Specific steps like viability gap funding and other financial assistance to achieve net zero by 2070 are expected to catalyze new industries and enable cleantech players to transform the landscape through innovative tech solutions. Overall, the budget aligns with India’s path towards sustainable growth and development, balancing welfare measures with economic expansion.\n\nSulajja Firodia Motwani, Founder and CEO of Kinetic Green\n\n“Today’s announcements on the interim budget for Viksit Bharat illustrate the government’s steadfast commitment to creating a developed India by 2047. The significant progress gained in all aspects of infrastructure physical, digital, and social over the last decade demonstrates our multifaceted economic management, which effortlessly aligns focus on infrastructure building with aggressive capital expenditure; with inclusive and people-centric development.\n\nThe allocation of 2.78 lakh crores to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is a clear indication of strides toward progress, particularly in fortifying the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem. The government’s commitment to the expansion and fortification of the e-vehicle ecosystem, promote deployment of EVs for the masses, coupled with support for manufacturing and charging infrastructure, marks a pivotal moment.\n\nThe government remains resolute in its commitment to expanding and sustaining this ecosystem, fostering entrepreneurial opportunities for vendors engaged in the supply and installation of charging infrastructure. Simultaneously, it aims to create employment opportunities for the youth equipped with technical skills in the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance of these vehicles.\n\nThe EV sector was expecting an announcement in the interim budget regarding the continuation of the Fame scheme for demand generation. We are hopeful to have this coming in the weeks ahead.\n\nWe receive this budget with great enthusiasm, confidence and hope for the coming Amrit Kaal.”\n\nTarun Gupta. – Co-Founder – Lissun\n\nIn analyzing the interim budget, I find it to be a well-rounded approach towards health initiatives. Extending Ayushman Bharat to Anganwadi and Asha workers and bringing maternal and child healthcare schemes under one roof, reflect positive strides. The initiative to establish medical colleges through existing structures and committees is another noteworthy development. Commendably, there is a strong commitment to Research and Development (R&D) with a substantial 1-lakh crore corpus allocated to the private sector. Additionally, India’s leadership is evident in STEM courses, boasting an impressive 43% women enrollment. However, as we await the post-election full budget, there’s a need for specific attention to the mental health sector. Allocating resources for infrastructure, qualified professionals, research, and destigmatization campaigns is imperative to address to escalating mental health crisis in India.\n\nPooja Sodhi, Co-Founder and CEO at Combonation\n\nThe budget 2024 redefines the dedication to the empowerment and welfare of the ‘Mahilayen’ (Women), and ‘Yuva’ (Youth), and stands resolute, as articulated by our Prime Minister. Financial budget underscore their needs and aspirations, acknowledging that the country’s progress is intricately related to the development in these areas. To bolster this, the budget champions Nari Shakti, spotting the momentum received in women’s empowerment over the last decade. Importantly, the budget introduces strategic tax benefits for startup ventures, aligning with the government’s dedication to fostering entrepreneurial spirit. As part of the broader initiative, the Mudra Yojana has dispensed 30 crore loans to women entrepreneurs, reflecting a tangible commitment to assisting female-led organizations. The expanded enrollment of women in higher education, mainly in STEM courses, highlights the advantageous trajectory toward gender inclusivity. Budget 2024, with its multi-faceted method, now not only addresses the various desires of our society but also propels the nation closer to inclusive increase and monetary prosperity.\n\nMs. Kavita Sharma, Co-founder and CEO, Ziyyara Edutech\n\nAs the Co-Founder and CEO of Ziyyara Edutech, I firmly believe in the transformative power of education, aligning with the progressive strides outlined in the National Education Policy 2020. PM Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI) exemplify our commitment to quality teaching, fostering holistic individuals. With thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans empowering women entrepreneurs and a commendable twenty-eight per cent rise in female higher education enrolment, we witness the impact of these reforms. The Skill India Mission, training 1.4 crore youth and establishing numerous institutions, resonates with our mission of accessible and personalized online tutoring. At Ziyyara Edutech, we stand proud in contributing to the educational landscape that empowers and equips the youth for a brighter future.\n\nMr. Nishant Sinsinwar, Founder of Homiie Studio & Projects Makers\n\nWe appreciate this Interim Budget that reflects a positive trajectory for the real estate and construction sectors, as well as infrastructure development. The government’s commitment to sustained growth and economic development, evident in the meticulous handling of the economy since 2014, is commendable. The emphasis on improving taxpayer services, withdrawing outstanding direct tax demands, and maintaining stable tax rates for direct and indirect taxes is a step in the right direction. The extension of tax exemptions for startups and IFSC units demonstrates a supportive approach to fostering entrepreneurship.\n\nThe focus on the GST system, reduction in compliance burden, and the positive impact on trade and industry is acknowledged. We appreciate the government’s efforts to streamline tax provisions, making filing returns simpler and faster. The budget estimates for 2024-25, with a continued emphasis on interest-free loans and fiscal discipline, instill confidence in the economic roadmap. The proposed interest-free loan for reforms by states and the significant FDI inflow showcase a forward-looking vision.\n\nDr. Bhavya Vankar, Co-founder, Quantum CorpHealth Pvt. Ltd.\n\n“We value the Finance Minister’s emphasis on female entrepreneurs in the Interim Budget for 2024–2025. In the past decade, the empowerment of women through entrepreneurship, improved living conditions, and upheld dignity has surged forward. With 30 crore Mudra Yojana loans supporting women entrepreneurs the strides made are evident with a remarkable 28% rise in female enrollment in higher education, and a notable 43% representation in STEM courses. As India stands as a light of progress, we recognize the positive impact on increasing female participation in the workforce.\n\nThe ‘Amrit Kaal’ strategy focuses on economic policies which foster sustainable development, inclusive growth, and empower Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) across the country. Guided by the mantra of ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform,’ that our government encourages commitment to next-generation reforms, building consensus, and providing timely resources to further aspirations.”\n\nAnkur Bansal, Co-Founder & Director, BlackSoil Capital\n\n“The FM’s interim budget announcement on deep-tech aligns with our expectations. The Government had earlier identified vital focus sectors, which included deep-tech; thus, a progressive announcement around the sector was anticipated. Besides EVs, renewables, agritech, deep-tech is now widely used in defence and surveillance. The proposed scheme focused on deep-tech defence technologies will not only ignite innovation and bolster national security but also provide a fertile ground for startups to thrive. Further, this will encourage entrepreneurship, augmented by the announcement of establishing a Rs 1tn corpus with a 50-year interest-free (or low) loan for long-term financing for research and innovation in sunrise areas. In addition, such initiatives by the Government will attract investment from the private sector and foreign investors, driving growth and propelling India towards self-reliance – ‘atmanirbharta’.” – Ankur Bansal, Co-Founder & Director, BlackSoil.\n\nMr. Varun Tangri CEO and founder at QueueBuster POS\n\n“Entering India’s Interim Union Budget 2024, the spotlight on infrastructure and road development marks a pivotal moment for the Retail and Retail Technology industry. With an injection of 11 Lakh crore and the PM GatiShakti project, we witness a strategic push for economic corridors, opening doors for three new corridors that will strengthen and expand organised retail in newer cities.\n\nAcknowledging the retail sector’s key role in India’s economy, the budget commits to launching new retail destinations, aligning seamlessly with our vision. Globally, our country has secured its place as the fourth-largest retail destination, driven by a surge in demand for lifestyle products. As India targets the third-largest consumer market by 2030, strategic investments in infrastructure promise substantial growth.\n\nIn a noteworthy move, the budget raises the presumptive taxation threshold for retail businesses to Rs 3 crore, offering valuable support to SMEs in the sector. These initiatives will surely be instrumental in positioning India as the world’s largest retail destination in the coming decades.”\n\nMrs. Rajita Kulkarni, President, Sri Sri University\n\n“The Interim Budget presented by Hon Finance Minister today is People-Centric budget focussed on Inclusive Development with substantive development of all forms of infrastructure-Physical, Digital and Social. Its particular focus on Women , Youth, Farmers & the Poor of the country will ensure that employment is created & economic empowerment happens and no one is left behind in the process of development. The emphasis on climate action, health , enabling innovation & startups will make India well poised to take a global leadership position as we approach Amrit Kaal.\n\nThe 2024 Budget signifies significant progress in the government’s commitment to enhancing the skills of today’s youth. The Skill India Mission, a pivotal initiative, has effectively trained 1.4 crore individuals and reskilled 54 lakh youth, emphasizing empowerment for the younger generation.\n\nAt the forefront is the National Education Policy (NEP) of 2020, introducing transformative measures to instill entrepreneurial mindsets in students.

Additionally, the government’s emphasis on developing new tourist attractions has the potential to elevate tourism nationwide, possibly spurring demand for travel loans and enhancing economic growth. This not only strengthens the lending sector but also extends credit accessibility for travel to a broader audience keen on exploring emerging tourist destinations.\n\nFurthermore, the recent establishment of prestigious higher education institutions such as IITs, IIITs, IIMs, and AIIMS underscores a commitment to skilling and reskilling the workforce. This, combined with increasing aspirations for higher education, may lead to a surge in demand for education loans, creating fresh opportunities for the fintech industry.\n\nIt is also commendable that the FM announced initiatives under PM Mudra Yojana and Start-Up India for young Indian startup founders who have been creating employment opportunities for Indian citizens in various sectors, including fintech.

Recognizing the pivotal role played by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in propelling India’s economic growth and global competitiveness, the government emphasizes ensuring timely and adequate financial support, fostering the adoption of innovative technologies, and implementing effective training programs for their success. Furthermore, a commitment to regulatory reforms aims to create a conducive environment for the flourishing of MSMEs. This dedication is in line with the overarching vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047, emphasizing the transformation of India into a Developed Nation with a balance between progress and nature, modern infrastructure, and equal opportunities for all. It resonates with the Development Mantra, focusing on comprehensive development, and aligns with the strategy for Amrit Kaal, promoting inclusive and sustainable development, increased productivity, and empowered citizens. The substantial allocation of INR 6,200 crore for the (Product Linked Incentive) PLI Scheme is a pivotal step in strengthening the MSME sector, providing tangible financial assistance and empowering them to contribute significantly to national resource generation and the realization of shared aspirations.”\n\nMr. Soumya Sarkar, Co-founder, Wealth Redefine (AMFI registered MFD)\n\nThe salient features of the interim budget 2024 include a CapEx target for FY25 rising by 11.1% to 11.1 lakh crore. Specifically, there is no change in direct or indirect taxes status quo. The FY25 physical deficit target is pegged at 5.1 percent of GDP; this represents a marginal decrease from that of FY24.

The corridor of India-Middle East- Europe has been projected as a game changer for infrastructure and exports with the foresight of India becoming a developed economy by 2047.\n\nMs. Sonam Motwani, CEO & Founder, Karkhana.io\n\nKarkhana.io commends the Finance Minister’s visionary budget, especially for empowering women entrepreneurs through initiatives like MUDRA Yojana, fostering inclusivity in fields like manufacturing.\n\nThe increased support for MSME training in the 2024 budget is crucial for growth, aligning with the ‘Amrit Kaal’ initiative for inclusive economic development.

It’s not just about creating policies; it’s also about nurturing the adoption of innovations and world-class technologies that emanate from the dynamic efforts of our youth to create world-class products.\n\nWe had requested for a separate budget for adoption of world-class technologies developed by Indians under Atmanirbhar Bharat and Start Up India and be adopted by the government under Digital India initiative. Now as we stand at a pivotal juncture, the recent budget updates signal a positive shift, streamlining funding processes and enhancing digital infrastructure and skill development initiatives. The commitment to establishing a ₹1 lakh crore corpus with a 50-year interest-free loan reflects a visionary approach towards providing long-term financing to catalyze the startup ecosystem. The government must adopt a transparent and fair policy in all areas while emphasizing on sectors where India has historically lagged and give them a special advantage.\n\nIn the words of Finance Minister Sitharaman, ‘Our prosperity depends on equipping and empowering the youth,’ and indeed, our young country’s high aspirations are being met with positive transformations. The reduction of the corporate tax rate and the extension of tax benefits for startups and investments underscore a commitment to fostering a conducive environment for innovation.\n\nAs we embrace the changes outlined in the interim budget, we remain optimistic about further reforms that will propel the startup ecosystem in India. The new-age tech opportunities for India are expanding, and our platform stands ready to contribute to this journey of innovation and social impact.\n\nReal-life collaborations through social networks will be the jet fuel for Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’.\n\nMr. Beas Dev Ralhan, CEO, Next Education\n\n“In the latest budget, the government places a significant emphasis on elevating higher education standards through upskilling and reskilling initiatives. This underscores a continued commitment to the transformative reforms outlined in The National Education Policy 2020. The substantial allocation, with the Education Ministry receiving its highest-ever budget of Rs 1,12,898.97 crore, reflects a prioritization of educational excellence.\n\nWhile PM Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI) play a pivotal role in delivering quality education and fostering holistic development, it is crucial to address the persistent challenge of unemployable youth. Urgent attention is needed to realign our education system with market demands, ensuring that our youth not only receive theoretical knowledge but also acquire practical skills. This strategic focus is essential to empower the younger generation to contribute meaningfully to the progress of our nation.”\n\nDr. Santanu Paul, Founding CEO and MD, TalentSprint\n\n“We welcome the Government of India’s interim budget proposal announced by honourable FM Nirmala Sitharaman highlighting a new scheme to be launched for strengthening deeptech technologies for defence purposes and expediting ‘atmanirbharta’. This will facilitate partnerships between defence organizations, academia, and industry players to co-create an ecosystem that will focus on building skilled capacity for the sector. To this end, all three partners must collaborate to curate curriculum, provide hands-on experience and promote knowledge exchange in cutting-edge defence technologies and related expertise in cybersecurity, devops, spacetech etc. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be the bedrock of all emerging technologies and will play a major role in defence tech. This move will act as a catalyst to bring about self-reliance in India’s growth narrative and simultaneously create experts for the global market.”\n\nAnshuman Das, CEO and Founder, LONGHOUSE Consulting\n\n“We commend the government’s commitment to nurturing entrepreneurship and promoting the empowerment of women through its visionary budgetary measures. The sanctioning of 43 crore (0.43 Billion) loans, amounting to Rs. 22.5 lakh crore (2.25 Trillion), through the PM Mudra Yojana, has provided a significant boost to the entrepreneurial aspirations of our youth. In addition, the Fund of Funds, Startup India, and Startup Credit Guarantee Schemes have played a crucial role in supporting our budding entrepreneurs. The remarkable increase in women’s participation in the workforce is a testament to the government’s dedication to fostering women’s empowerment and ensuring a dignified standard of living. We applaud these endeavours and eagerly anticipate contributing to this transformative journey of progress.”\n\nMr. S Pasupathi, Chief Operating Officer, HirePro\n\n“We commend the government’s commitment to empowering the youth of India through its focus on skill development and employability in the recent budget.

At HirePro, we recognise the importance of a skilled workforce in driving economic growth. The government’s emphasis on talent mobility aligns with the global demand for Indian talent. This presents a tremendous opportunity for collaboration, where platforms like ours can play a pivotal role in connecting skilled Indian youth with both domestic and international opportunities. Additionally, the strides made in education reform, particularly the establishment of prestigious institutions like IITs, IIITs, IIMs, AIIMS, and universities, will contribute to nurturing a pool of well-rounded and highly capable individuals.

We wholeheartedly embrace the Lakhpati Didi initiative, aligning with the Government’s vision to create 3 crores self-reliant Lakhpati Didis. Through our association with various livelihood missions across states, we have successfully onboarded 100,000+ women as Business Correspondents, empowering them with skills to offer financial and digital services to their communities. As we eagerly anticipate Union Budget 2024, we seek specific measures, including a 5% GST rate for last-mile empowerment startups, a GST waiver on all financial services from BC outlets, Income Tax relief, and reduced import duty on essential financial services devices.”\n\nAnkit Ratan, Chair, Regtech Committee, Fintech Convergence Council, and Co-founder, Signzy:\n\n“The Budget has recognized the importance of Digital Public Infrastructure as the new factor of production driving the formalization of the economy. A key factor that drives the digital economy and enhances adoption is Digital Trust. It revolves around customers’ confidence in the security, reliability, and honesty of transactions carried out through banking channels. We believe a robust digital public infrastructure along with an enhanced digital trust ecosystem will promote responsible innovation while risk-proofing businesses from cybersecurity concerns. Creating an environment of trust beyond the established physical branches of a bank through real-time monitoring of biometric systems and cybersecurity resilience among others is the way forward. This promises an economy where technology empowers trust that paves the way for a brighter and more equitable future.”\n\nMr. Chakravarthi C.- Managing Director – Quantum Energy\n\n“The interim budget might not have specified any policy or allocation towards the EV sector, however, it did mention the intention to promote EV in public transportation. Additionally, what we need right is to strengthen the EV ecosystem holistically for which the budget is indicated towards policies and measures that will be undertaken to support manufacturing and charging infrastructure. Clearly, EV stands in the priority list of the government and we can expect the upcoming FAME policy and August session to encompass all the particulars”\n\nAnkit Kumar, CEO, Skye Air and Saurabh Rai, CEO, ARAHAS Technologies\n\nThe India Budget 2024 heralds a powerful catalyst for our nation’s economic advancement. By extending concessional tax rates for new manufacturing units, fostering innovation receives a significant impetus. The strategic emphasis on training for MSMEs not only enhances competitiveness but also nurtures a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem, propelling Bharat towards global leadership. The unwavering commitment to realizing a ‘Vikshit Bharat’ by 2047, coupled with the remarkable success of the Skill India Mission in elevating average income by 50%, underscores the profound impact of these initiatives on the nation’s growth trajectory. This budget’s unwavering focus on growth, inclusivity, and productivity not only aligns with our aspirations but also lays the groundwork for a flourishing Indian economy, poised to seize opportunities and surmount challenges on the global stage.”\n\nHarshvardhan Lunia, Chair, Fintech Convergence Council, and Founder & CEO, Lendingkart\n\n“In examining the Interim Budget, it is evident that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has crafted a vision encapsulating the themes of inclusivity, self-reliance, and comprehensive national development. The focus on marginalized groups and regional empowerment reflects a nuanced understanding of the diverse needs driving India’s progress. Zooming into the Fintech and Lending landscape, the budget introduces strategic measures to catalyze long-term financing for private sectors, aligning with the nation’s pursuit of technological advancement. The emphasis on innovation, skilling initiatives, and MSME support underscores a forward-looking approach tailored for India’s digital age, aligned with the imperative of steering India’s economic growth in the digital era. The financial sector’s preparation and borrowing targets for the upcoming year signify a well-balanced approach to meet investment requirements.

This pivotal attention comes at a crucial time when the industry grapples with a funding winter, compounded by challenges such as the geopolitical crises and global slowdown. The announcement of a substantial corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore, featuring 50-year interest-free loans for Startups & MSMEs, is a commendable move that will undoubtedly provide the private sector with long-term financing opportunities at low or nil interest rates. This initiative aligns seamlessly with our vision to foster innovation and scale up research in sunrise sectors.\n\nThe extension of tax benefits for startups until March 31, 2025, further reinforces the government’s commitment to nurturing the entrepreneurial spirit.

These measures collectively pave the way for a robust and resilient startup landscape, and we at Perfios are optimistic about the positive impact they will have on the industry as a whole.”\n\nMr. Anil Agarwal, CEO, and Co-Founder of InCruiter\n\n“While we appreciate the focus of the Skill India Mission on training and upskilling millions of youths, the emphasis should be on bridging the gap between skilling initiatives and industry needs. Hiring skilled talent for the right opportunities remains a challenge for HR professionals, and a more targeted approach could be the adoption of AI tech-driven HR software to make the process faster and more efficient. Fostering a culture of continuous learning to align skill development with emerging sectors and specific job profiles is crucial. The new institutions of higher learning are commendable, but ensuring quality education and industry exposure is key. We also need to see stronger industry-academia partnerships to equip graduates with the practical skills that businesses demand.\n\nFurthermore, for the startup ecosystem, access to skilled talent can make or break their ventures, and schemes like PM Mudra Yojana and Start-Up India are positive steps for budding entrepreneurs. We stand ready to collaborate with the government and skill development bodies to bridge this gap, ensuring that India’s startup ecosystem can hire skilled talent for the evolving economy.”\n\nMr. Piyush Goel Founder and CEO of Beyond Key\n\n“In 2024, a transformative surge in technology is predicted, propelled by India’s unwavering commitment to skill development and innovation, as articulated by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The Skill India Mission has actively educated 1.4 crore youths, imparting essential skills and upskilling 54 lakh youths, alongside establishing 3,000 new ITIs. The academic arena has witnessed remarkable growth with the establishment of 7 IITs, sixteen IITs, 7 IIMs, 15 AIIMSs, and 390 universities, fostering a strong atmosphere for technological advancement. Furthermore, the fiscal budget 2024 allocates resources to increase the number of airports, rail infrastructure, and other infrastructure, undoubtedly impacting mass lives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) would become a pivotal force, and stronger funding to harness its benefits is poised to elevate the technological landscape. Corporate sectors also stand to benefit from the decreased corporate tax of 22%, fostering a greater favorable commercial enterprise environment and selling economic growth through accelerated investments and expansion opportunities. The budget’s strategic investments underscore India’s steadfast determination to a dynamic and tech-driven future.”\n\nSaurabh Rai, CEO, ARAHAS Technologies\n\nThe Indian Government’s forward-looking Interim Budget for FY 2024-25 marks a transformative moment, aligning perfectly with mission and values. The introduction of ‘Kartavya Kaal’—a call to duty for the private sector to significantly boost research and innovation—resonates deeply with our ethos. We’re poised to lead in pioneering sustainable solutions across sunrise sectors, leveraging this budget as a springboard towards a greener, more innovative India. This budget not only fosters a circular economy and sustainable development but also emphasizes India’s role on the global stage through initiatives like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor. It’s a clarion call for us to harness technology and innovation, ensuring India’s vibrant future. We’re committed to contributing to ‘Innovation India,’ driving transformative changes that will benefit our society and economy.\n\nVishvanathan Subramanian, CFO & Director, PayMate\n\n“It’s a forward-looking Interim Budget that places a premium on stability and predictability which is welcome.

This will set the stage for a thriving startup landscape and signals a bright future for innovation, job creation, and economic dynamism. I am confident this will significantly impact the startup ecosystem, fostering innovation and growth”.\n\nPravin Agarwala, Co-founder and Group CEO, BetterPlace\n\n“The Union Budget 24-25 presented by FM Nirmala Sitharaman strongly echoed Centre’s vision of further increasing & scaling up employability in India, with holistic training, skilling, and reskilling being the decisive pillars. The vision of furthering domestic tourism is set to create a plethora of job opportunities for local workers, thereby bolstering the employment landscape for frontline workers in India.\n\nThe Budget also stressed upon taking collective efforts towards bringing more women, youth, farmers, and the underserved workers to the forefront, which strongly mirrors our collective efforts of empowering the dignity & wellbeing of these different cohorts of the population, who are resiliently driving India’s growth. Extension of Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) to all ASHA and Anganwadi workers will further ensure medical & health care facilities reach women workers.\n\nIt was truly exciting to hear how India’s tech stack has become a robust case study for the world and with our innovation-first approach, tech-first companies, like ours, are providing solutions to the global markets.\n\nWhile we were looking forward to more concrete policies directed towards extending the social security of gig workers, thereby enabling the formalisation of the workforce, it will be important now for industry leaders and enterprises to have an open dialogue and with the support of policymakers, develop frameworks which can be conducive for the employing companies and the gig workers alike.”\n\nRatheesh D, Director, CABT Logistics- First Mile, Mid Mile & Last Mile services\n\n“Logistics gets a shot in the arm with Budget 2024!

It is notable that the government puts emphasis on long-term economic growth and development. The withdrawal of standing direct tax demands and maintenance of tax rates reduce the burden on many construction business owners. The fact that interest-free loans are to continue and the commitment to bring down the Fiscal Deficit implies an exercise in good fiscal policies. The focus on affordable housing, rooftop solarization, and green energy is in sync with Magicrete’s emphasis on environment-friendly construction technologies. We anticipate a proactive role in fulfilling the mission of Viksit Bharat towards nation-building.\n\nDr. Prof Anand Achari, Principal, Vivekanand Education Society’s College of Architecture\n\n“At VESCOA, we appreciate the budget’s focus on empowering the youth for a prosperous future.

The proposal to withdraw outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 for years up to 2009-10 and Rs. 10,000 for the period from 2010 to 2015 is a welcome relief for 1 crore taxpayers. This step aligns with the government’s efforts to ease the burden on taxpayers and foster a more supportive financial environment. Furthermore, the decision to maintain the current tax rates for both direct and indirect taxes, including import duties, provides stability and predictability for businesses. The extension of tax exemptions for startups and IFSC units until March 31, 2025, is a strategic move to encourage continued growth and innovation in these sectors.\n\nThe announcement of interest-free loans with an outlay of Rs. 1.3 lakh crore for the next year is a noteworthy initiative.
