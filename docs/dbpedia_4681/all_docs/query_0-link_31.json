Pa 19101 (800) 257 7951 Vol 92 No 36 XommenlQfy The Tangled Status Off Tape By JUE BRESSI ThL- ailvcnl ihe tape tarlriiigc in ihc nnil-'60s was as much Thi* laiencv. of tape rdca^ei. in general, and ihe lack (.f any ol' a boom lu our busincs;. as many ot the \"benchmarks\" we as an industry recognise as landmark achicvemcnis When we IcHtk back we should certainly include Ihc tape cartridge right along with the slercn record, lihts Preslev and ihc Bea ties as stimuli for the giant leaps made m the past quarter ot a ccniur\\ Vet. in recent months, despite ihc bo- nanza that the tape cartridge has brought to us all. I find it disiressmg that thi>se of us oul m Ihe retail trenches must deal s^ilh ivorv towerattituJesand decisions about tape that don't nects- s;iriK apply in the real world the marketplace. Ihc prevailing themes that I find cause the most problems are. \"8-track is dead\" and \"blank tape ls evil.\" There is no question but that 8-track is slowly regressing while the cassette is vcr) much on the rise Prerecorded cas- sette has perhaps overtaken prere- corded 8-track on a national basis, al- though figures from our stores m I!5 slates still show them running pretty much neck and neck Yet. the major labels now have taken the stance, \"let's kill 8-track It's down, so lefs put It oul of iLs misery!\" Right?Wrong! 1 have news for you It ain't gonna diejust yet. There are millions of R-irack players oul there that are not go- ing to disappear and turn inio cassette decks o\\ernight. There arc plenty of older cars out on the roads w ith 8-irack players Are vou fellows in Los Angeles and New Yi.>rk aw jre that there aren't too manv new tars being sold these dav s, so thi>se old cars may be around a while longer ' Millions of 8-tracl( players out there won't disappear Our figures have always shown that llic great Hulk ort>ur 8- irack business comes from three categories: (1) heavy metal- lype rock i2) black music, and country music Now if \\ou relate our national economic distress to these three groups of tonsumers. ii should seem clear that they are the least likely to rush on down to Radio Shack and pick up a new cassette deck just so thev can hear those hot new releases that aren't being issued in 8-irack anymore. ObviousU. the 16 to 18 year olds {heavy metal), blacks, and all those blue collar factttry wtukers {heavy country) on the uneniplo\\ment rolls are the groups most affected bv the current recession While there still mav he enough disposable income to allow them to entertain themselves while they are not working or trying to make ends meet in these inflationarv times, they arc not presentiv mio upgrading their entertainment systems They can afford software, but no new hardware. Stop down al vour corner ht fi shop and the ow ner will vcrif\\ this lor vou. So my first point is that S- track is not going to disappear over* night There is an 8-track buscr out there, and w ill be for some lime We. as an industry, have no business ignoring his wants and needs Let's move over to some cause and elTeci on home taping. Mow about it wc lake time out from damning Mcmorev TDK. radio, and everyone else for home taping. Why don't wc shoul- der a little of the burden ourselves? The albums that oiler the mo^i potential in tape sales also dc* mand a certain immcdiacN in jvailabilitv Retailers, go back and took at your receipt dales on the last few month's hot re- leases jnd \\ou'II find that on so man\\ of the big cape sellers, the tape releascMboth K-track and cassette! followed the LP release by as much as two weeks. Name them things like Ted Nugent. Teddy Pendcrgrass. AC 'DC B O C . Charlie Daniels, etc.. etc. Tape buyers were waiting for these albums, so when thc\\ po to the store to buy und thes'rc not there. lhe\\ tape them off a friend s record or olT the radio And sou know something. ihc\\ are so used to not being able to get their new music on tape on time, they don't even come in much anvmore And. to those tape hu\\ers wc lose because ol later release dates, add those we lose when an 8-track isn't even issued. How many people have hud lu tape Benny Mardones from a friend's nvord, or how aboul Cameron, or All Thiimpsiin? Joe Bressi: \"Lateness of tape releases has alienated the buyer and sent him over to Menwex.\" release al all on 8-track on many breaking artists has alienated the tape huvcr and sent him over to Mcmore\\. But we retailer) are castigated for at least being able to provide that Memorex 8-lrack to our customers. And now comes ihis quc*stionablc policy of not allowing blank tape adver- tising along with record advertising. Manufacturers should realize that this will have very litlte effect on home tap- ing. It will just hurt record sales mure, and hurt the health of your accounts w ho are already hurting in case you haven't looked at your accounts receiv- jble lately Ihe person that tapes at home is the person who really cannot afford to buv all his music from the record store We have priced ourselves out of his reach and he would rather take the time and the effort land taping is time and cffon) to make his own tape than spend the S7. S8 or SI4 a tape costs today Except for an iKvasional purchase, he/she is Imi to us. He/she just can't afTord us. That person that man\\ of us try to reach in our print and radio advertising IS called an audiophile He likes to bu\\ a lot of records and then put them on a high quality TDK or Maxell cassette because they sound much better than the tape we use m our prerecorded cartridges He is a voracious rtxord buvcr and the ad policies are now making it tougher for us to get him mt4> our stores Believe me. that 17-vcar-otd taping Pink Floyd off the radio isn't reading our newspaper ads anyway. And what do wc do about him? Do wc ihrow' all the blank tapcout of our stores jusi so he can'l get ans music at all. forgetting that someday he ma\\ grow up and become prosperous and prefer buying tape from our stores (lor that old 8-track player that he has) rather than spending valuable leisure time screwing around with paus,c buttons Do we turn off our future customers? Let manufacturers begin addressing ourlape business fromj realistic standpoint rather than from an emotional one. 1 1 Don't stop making 8-track Be more careful in your selling and get the label salespeople to monitor their accounts more closeK. Returns have been a problem because no one was mak- ing an adjustment in selling and bu\\ing to compensate for the recession, the cassette and the massne cutout dumps of 8- tracks that have been made by the labels because tho^e re- turns Let's stop blaming others for inroads of home taping Iran st^lved its return problems It banned music. Are we ic lake a similar stance on 8-irack'' 2) Release W-lratks and casscuci on cslahlishcd artists at the same time as the LP Our industry has enough duplicating ca- pacity to do this and should cX'rtainly be able to schedule the^c shipments to arri\\ e at the same time Don't chase the upe buyer out of the store before we have a shot at him Develcip the abilitN toquickis build and release the tape con- figurations on a new artist who begins to break We've surely lost 1,000 8-track sales on Benny Mardones in the past month How often can wc alTord this* ^) Relent .md do awas with the reactionary and emotional blank tapead\\criising p*>lic\\ that many of vou base issued. It is pointless and diK's not soixe the problem Ad dollars are hard to get and so are customers these days You are cutting oil the hand lhal feeds sou . your accounts and their customers.
