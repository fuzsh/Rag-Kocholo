Understanding and solving the feral cat problem on a local level here in Babylon involves several key factors:\n\nCats:\n\nFeral cats are the offspring of domestic cats that have not been socialized or domesticated. Cats in general are highly territorial and they will not roam very far from where they were born.\n\nCommunity:\n\nFeral cats are a community problem and likely occur because of neglect and miscommunication. When cats who are not spayed or neutered are allowed to be outdoors for long periods of time roaming a community, the likelihood of feral cats increases.\n\nThe Town of Babylon's Department of Animal Control provides its community with several resources to curtail the feral cat population:\n\n• Supplies residents and caregivers state of the art traps for the TNR (Trap/Neuter/Return) of the feral cats\n\n• Supplies low cost $35 TNR vouchers so there is no cost to the residents and caregivers\n\n• Hosts regular seminars on the TNR program\n\nCircumstances:\n\nEach colony of feral cats is unique, as are the dynamics and circumstances of the location. Feral cats also generally don't leave a community because of lack of food, on the contrary removing the food source will force the cats to roam further for food, cause them stress, and make them quite unhealthy.\n\nCommunication:\n\nCivil communication between parties affected by feral cats is a key factor in resolving the inevitable differences caused by the presence of feral cats. The caregiver cannot assume that everyone has the same devotion to cats as they do. It helps in the longterm to acknowledge the caregivers right to provide proper care for the cats as well as understanding that some neighbors to not share the same devotion. If all neighbors communicate and share a common plan to solve the feral cat problem, results will be swifter and tangible.\n\nCooperation:\n\nAll people in a neighborhood are affected by feral cats; if the entire community works together to control the problem, results can be that much more swifter and tangible.\n\nTime:\n\nIt takes time to control a feral cat problem in a neighborhood. Please be patient as the community and TOB representatives work together towards a common solution.\n\nIf you feel your property is over assessed, you can file a grievance to challenge your assessed value. You must fill out an application to begin the process, sometime in mid-April through the third Tuesday in May (Grievance Day). Application forms can be obtained from the Town Assessor’s office or the New York State website @ www.tax.ny.gov/forms. All grievances must be submitted by the third Tuesday in May.\n\nIf you wish, you may appear before the Board of Assessment Review (BOAR), an independent board, to have your complaint heard. Regardless of whether or not you appear, you must still file a written grievance form.\n\nAll Assessment Reviews are held in the Town Board Room on Grievance Day. Meeting times are from 10:00 am to noon and 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. It is not necessary for a grievant to appear before the Board in order to submit their grievance.\n\nGrievance forms can be mailed or brought in personally. If it is mailed, it is the applicant’s responsibility to be certain that the application is received in time by this office.\n\nThe Board of Assessment Review (BOAR) is responsible for making a determination on a grievance complaint. The grievant is usually notified of the BOAR’s determination by July. If the applicant disagrees with the Board’s decision, they may seek judicial review by proceeding to the next step; filing a small claims petition with the Suffolk County Clerk’s Office in Riverhead, NY.\n\nBelow is the exemption listing with some general descriptions.

(as Agent for Town of Babylon) 180 Oser Avenue, Suite 800 Hauppauge, NY 11788 Telephone #: (631) 435-4710\n\nAll concerns regarding abandoned property should be directed to the Office of Citizen Services at 631-957-8696 or 3-1-1 . The Town will schedule an inspection of the property in question. The Town will make every effort to ensure that the property is secure and safe for the public. All costs associated with securing the property will be at the property owner’s expense. If necessary, the Town will send a cleanup or violation correction notice to the property owner. The property owner has at least five days to respond. If the clean up notice is not responded to in a timely manner, The Town will schedule a cleanup and bill the property owner for the associated costs. If not paid promptly, charges (including late penalties) will appear on the property owner’s next tax bill. If the house is in need of board up and/or demolition or other measure that actually requires a handling of the structure, the process is more complex. For those violations, a Town Board resolution is passed and a legal notice sent to the property owner. The property owner has 30 days to comply with requirements of the notice. If compliance is not made in this period the Town can take appropriate (i.e. board up or demolition) action against the property in violation. This process can take several months while utilities are contacted for service turnoffs and mark outs for underground utility lines, pipes etc. are prepared. In some cases, depending on the legal and safety issues associated with the particular situation, interim measures may be initiated. This requires definition and approval by the Town Board and Town Attorney. Escalation will occur on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOver the course of time, the Town has experimented with a number of solutions to mitigate the flooding concerns along our south shore. Unfortunately, much was met without success.\n\nFlapper valves were installed on the water side of several drainage pipes only to have them seal up in the closed position with marine life causing flooding during normal rain events. These valves require a lot of maintenance and, since there are potentially thousands of locations that these can be installed, this is not a feasible solution.\n\nAt one time, duckbill valves were mounted on the outside of Town controlled bulkheads to prevent contaminations due to the backflow of water. A duckbill valve is generally made out of rubber and shaped like the beak of a duck. They are more costly than flapper valves and boats tended to break them off when docking. In addition, they also had a tendency to freeze in the winter, which makes them non-viable solutions.\n\nIn certain areas, the Town built catch basins that serve to hold stormwater in rain events. However, because of the high water table, the catch basins are often ½ full most of the time causing a mosquito problem (so they don't work in every area).\n\nThe Town is committed to developing new and affordable solutions for the flooding problems along the shore line and will work with the residents and businesses in those areas.\n\nAll requests are made through the Office of Citizen Services at (631) 957-TOWN (8696).\n\nOnce a request is received, it is forwarded to Code Enforcement or the Office of Sanitation for investigation. If in violation, a Notice of Violation is placed on the door of the home, or if there is nowhere to leave the notice (such as with vacant property), it is mailed, registered mail, to the owner of the property. The property owner has a period of 5 days to cure the situation. A reinspection will be conducted just beyond the 5 day cure period. If the violation is not corrected, the Town will clean the property and bill the cost of this work to the property owner and if not paid will be transferred to the property’s tax bill. This is a legally binding lien (debt that stays with the property until paid).\n\nSuffolk County is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all County properties. Constituents are encouraged to call (631) 853-5941 about neglected county lots.\n\nYour road may have been selected for repaving. If so, it is probably because of the overall condition of the road as well as the need to improve the drainage system. Please be aware that the entire reconstruction process may take approximately two months, weather permitting, to complete. The reconstruction process is extensive and involves many separate steps.\n\nThe first step is to remove any obstacles to reconstruction including sidewalks, curbing, driveway aprons, telephone poles, and, in some cases, trees. During the reconstruction process, we may, unfortunately, be forced to remove some healthy trees. The Town of Babylon is very dedicated to the preservation of trees and will only remove a tree as a last resort. Trees will be removed for the following reasons:\n\nRoots are uplifting the road\n\nRoots are interfering with a drainage basin\n\nThe tree is in the boundaries of the proposed road expansion (Federal and State guidelines dictate how wide a street must be)\n\nThe condition of the tree jeopardizes public safety (roots that are cut or damaged compromise the integrity of the tree which could in turn become a public safety issue)\n\nThe tree is diseased or dead\n\nFollowing this, the road itself is pulverized and recycled on site. The existing road is regraded and used as the sub-base for the new road. After regrading occurs, the road cannot be paved until the moisture levels drop below 2%. This usually takes 3 or 4 days.\n\nThe next step is to pave the road. The final step in the reconstruction process is the restoration work. This is another time-consuming phase as sidewalks, curbs and other items removed must be restored.\n\nAlthough it is a long process, you will have access to your road throughout the entire reconstruction process, with limited exceptions. The end result of this work will be a brand new road for you and your neighbors.\n\nDuring working hours (Monday through Friday, 7:00 am to 6:00 pm), your street will be open, but at times access may be limited.\n\nPlease do not leave any vehicles parked in the roadway during working hours. If possible, park on the nearest cross street not under improvement, a minimum of 100 feet from the corner. Please adjust your plans for deliveries and other daily functions. During non-working hours, you will have unlimited access to your street. Pre-construction photos have been taken of your driveways and Town right-of ways (shoulder areas) to assist the contractor in the restoration phase of the project.\n\nPlease contact the Office of Citizen Services at (631) 957-TOWN (8696) to answer any inquiries you may have.\n\nYour road has been selected for reconstruction due to the overall condition of the road as well as to upgrade the drainage system. Please be aware that the entire reconstruction process may take approximately two months, weather permitting, to complete. Although it is a long process, you will have access to your road throughout the entire reconstruction process, with limited exceptions. The end result of this work will be a brand new road for you and your neighbors.\n\nAll sign requests should be made to the Office of Citizen Services at 631-957-8696 or 3-1-1 or by using this online form. Requests for new signs (or other traffic devices) will be submitted to the Traffic Safety Committee for review and analysis. The Committee will then, if warranted, submit the application to Traffic Engineering. Traffic Engineering will then do a site study and make a recommendation on the request. This may take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. The Traffic Safety Committee will make a decision based on a review of the original request application and the engineering site study. The recommendation then goes to the Town Board and a hearing is scheduled. Once the hearing is held the Town will consider a resolution at the next Town Board meeting to finalize the process and effectuate the change. This entire process may take several months before a final decision is rendered.\n\nThe objective of Green Homes is to reduce your homes energy usage, thereby reducing your utility bills. To start, an energy assessment will be performed by a town licensed, BPI ((Building Performance Institute) certified, Energy Auditor. The cost of the energy assessment is $250, which will be paid directly to your auditor. There is no longer a $250 assessment fee.\n\nFollowing the Home Performance Evaluation, you will be given a detailed explanation of how your home uses energy, where the most energy is being wasted or lost, and specific improvements that could increase energy efficiency. The report also calculates a fixed cost for each recommended improvement along with the projected dollar amount you will see in energy savings on an annual basis, from that specific improvement.\n\nThe Green Homes Program can pay the contractor the entire cost of the energy-efficiency improvements. Under a separate contract with the homeowner, the Town sets up a monthly payment plan that has the homeowner pay for the improvements over time only from a projected utility bill cost savings.\n\nThe best part of the Green Homes program is that there are no up-front costs to the homeowner for the improvements.\n\nOnce the licensed contractor has completed the work, the Town will directly pay the contractor. The homeowner will then pay the Town for the improvements on a monthly basis for an amount and term that is agreed upon in advance. With almost every customer, the savings from reduced energy bills will be greater than the cost of the improvements. This means that the homeowner will have a positive cash flow; the money that was going to the utility companies is now going to make your home greener and healthier. Once the improvements are completely paid for all of the savings go directly to the homeowner, saving him/her an average of $1,000 every year.\n\nThe Town is not loaning money to homeowners. The Town is expanding the definition of solid waste to include energy waste, based on its carbon content. By defining energy waste in this way, the Town is able to provide energy-efficient improvements to Babylon residents’ homes from its solid waste fund. This type of measure is known as a “benefit assessment.” A benefit assessment can be established when a municipality provides a specific improvement on a parcel of property for a public purpose, assessing the cost of the benefit against the property. In the case of Green Homes, the energy-efficient improvements to homes serve a vital purpose, remediating the environmental damage caused by leaky and inefficient homes.\n\nThe Town will provide for energy saving improvements up to $14,000 per home (up to $19,000 for heat pump work scopes) and the homeowner will pay for the improvements through a monthly benefit assessment fee. The amount of the monthly benefit assessment fee is structured to be less than the monthly savings on a resident’s energy bills resulting from the energy-efficient improvements. The Town will charge a 3% administrative fee which will be built into the monthly payments residents will make to pay for the improvements.\n\nBefore we can schedule you for a Home Performance Audit, we need some information about your home's energy use. Please fill out the Self-Check Home Inventory Form, which includes some basic questions about your home, as well as your energy usage habits. In addition to the form, you will be asked to provide your two most recent years of utility usage data; that includes your electricity, oil, and/or gas. If you don't have this information, please request it from your utility providers by calling or visiting their websites. Click HERE for step by step directions on how to get your PSEG-LI electricity data from www.psegliny.com, and click HERE for directions on how to get National Grid natural gas data from http://www.nationalgridus.com This .information helps us to insure that we estimate your energy savings accurately and is required in order to receive an energy audit at no cost. If you have not been living in your home for more than two years, or are unable to obtain the data, you can still participate? Please give us a call and we'll help you get started.\n\nOnce we have processed the data from your Self-Check Home Inventory Form, a Town of Babylon licensed Long Island Green Homes Contractor will perform a Home Performance Audit on your house. The contractor will provide a detailed report that will recommend certain energy efficient home improvements and estimate the savings that will result. You make the decision to hire the contractor to perform the energy-efficient home improvements. What energy-efficient home improvements are offered through the program? Improvements include efficient Green Home sting, weather-stripping, caulking, air and duct sealing, insulation and upgrading of heating units, heat pumps, etc. We will advise participants which appliances, cooling units, and other eligible measures offer the best return and what rebates and incentives (from NYSERDA, PSEG-LI, and/or National Grid) apply. Please call our office at (631) 422-4411 if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nIn Person: In person (drive-thru) purchasing will begin in April at various parks throughout the Town.
