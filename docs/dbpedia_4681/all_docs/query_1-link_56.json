In the sector of radio broadcasting, ITN manages ITN FM, which has an audience reach of 0.48 percent and Vasantham FM, which has an audience reach of 1.6 percent. ITN FM was formerly known as Lakhanda and this radio station originated as a subsidiary of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). It was incorporated into ITN in April 1997.\n\nThe Annual Report of Independent Television Network Limited (ITN) for the year 2015 provides the ownership details of the Independent Television Network Limited (ITN), which is the company that manages Vasantham TV. Further data on ownership was collected from the annual returns available at the Department of Registrar of Companies. The most recently available data for ITN is from the year 2018. Secondary sources were referenced for details regarding the founder and key people of the media outlet. Meanwhile, viewership data was gathered from the Kantar Lanka Market Research Bureau (LMRB) for the year 2017. While the Media Ownership Monitor research team reached out to ITN by formally requesting for the companyâ€™s information on 20 July 2018, the company did not respond to the aforementioned request."
