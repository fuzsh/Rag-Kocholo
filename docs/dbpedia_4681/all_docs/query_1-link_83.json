        "text": "Actor Vijay entered into politics with the formation of his party Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam in February 2024 and this move has often been compared to fellow actor and part-time politician Kamal Haasan and his party Makkal Needhi Maiam. This parallel is evident in the strategic moves and statements made by Vijay, which align closely with the ideology of the Dravidian movement and the DMK.\n\nThe political landscape of Tamil Nadu, gearing up for the 2026 state legislative assembly elections, will also be witness to yet another cine star namely Vijay, seemingly propelled by the DMK to echo their Dravidian ideology and potentially further divide the votes in the state.\n\nThis strategy echoes the historical move where Kamal Haasan entered politics at a time when actor Rajinikanth was contemplating starting his own party, with Rajinikanth’s vision leaning towards spiritual politics. To counter this, the DMK strategically supported Kamal Haasan’s political debut to split the votes.\n\nA notable example of Vijay’s alignment with the Dravidian ideology and the DMK is evident in his recent actions. He extended congratulations to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and its leader Chandra Babu Naidu, along with the Jana Sena Party and its leader Pawan Kalyan, for their significant victory in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nDespite the impending oath-taking ceremony of Naidu as Chief Minister on 12 June 2024, Vijay extended his felicitations. Additionally, he congratulated the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi party and the Naam Tamilar Party for their recognition as state parties in Tamil Nadu. Although indirectly, he also acknowledged the success of the DMK alliance in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.\n\nNotably absent from his remarks was any mention of the BJP’s victory at the central level, where a meeting has been convened, and the NDA alliance has unanimously chosen PM Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of India for a record third time, with the oath-taking ceremony scheduled for 9 June 2024.\n\nLooking back at how Vijay exposed his alignment with the Dravidian ideology, it is noteworthy that on the auspicious occasion of Tamizh Puthandu (Tamil New Year) on 14 April 2024, amidst the festive spirit engulfing Tamil Nadu, Vijay stirred controversy by refraining from extending wishes to the people for the Tamil New Year. Instead, Vijay took to social media to share greetings for Ambedkar Jayanti, which coincidentally falls on the same day. This is the same strategy employed by the DMK on the auspicious occasion of Hindu celebrations and festivals such as Vinayagar Chaturthi, Saraswathi Pooja, and other festive occasions.\n\nAs expected, aligning with the stance of Dravidian parties, Vijay (very ignorantly) expressed opposition to the notification of CAA. His press release read, “Any law like the Indian Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 (CAA) is not acceptable in an environment where all the people of the country are living in social harmony. The rulers should give an assurance that they will not implement this law in Tamil Nadu.”\n\nBased on these observations, it can be inferred that part-time politician and full-time actor Vijay is yet another emerging foster project by the DMK and embodies the principles of Dravidian ideology in Tamil Nadu."
