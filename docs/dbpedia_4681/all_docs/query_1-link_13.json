        "text": "Sadiq said:\n\nMy native town is Porayar (Nagapattinum district of Tamil Nadu). But now I am in Karaikal. When I was there in Porayar (1996, 1997), I used to get Only DD National and DD Podhigai in one single channel from DD's terrestrial relay station located in Karaikal.\n\nApart from that, I used to get around 10 or 15 channels from Sri Lanka. Most of them were in Sinhala and few Tamil and English Channels.\n\nSakthi TV (Tamil) - Used to re-telecast programs from SUN TV. Later had their own programs and few from Sun TV.\n\nSirasa TV (Sinhala and part time Hindi)\n\nChannel 1 (English)\n\nSwarnawahini (Sinhala, part time Tamil and part time Hindi) - Used to re-telecast ATN (Hindi) and Raj TV (Tamil) programs. Used to telecast latest Tamil and Hindi movies before Indian channels telecast them.\n\nRupavahini (Sinhala, Tamil, English)\n\nRupavahini-I (Sinhala, Tamil, English)\n\nE-TV (English)\n\nand many other Sinhala channels (don't remember the names now )\n\nI still remember listening to \"ilangai vanoli (Srilanka 24/7 Tamil Radio)\" and their programs were awesome. Even now i sometimes listern to their sooriyan FM for good classical songs.\n\nAlso now in south many srilankan tamil FM seems to be available, a few of them are given below,\n\nAlai FM 91.4 MHz\n\nShakthi FM 103.9 MHz, 104.1 MHz\n\nSooriyan FM 103.4 MHz, 103.6 MHz\n\nTamil National Service 102.1 MHz, 102.3 MHz\n\nThendral 104.7 MHz, 104.9 MHz\n\nVasantham FM 102.6 MHz, 102.8 MHz\n\nVelichcham FM 92.7 MHz\n\nVettri FM 90.4 MHz, 90.6 MHz\n\nI heard a Chinese Tamil FM with name \"Cheena vanoli\" broadcasting since 1963."
