Maxwell Stephens is a specialist facilities management recruitment consultancy founded in 2006 by managing director Peter Forshaw. With over 50 years of combined experience in facilities management recruitment we are experts in the industry and are renowned for providing unparalleled results through our unique combination of focus, knowledge and industry experience. At Maxwell Stephens we are always keen to share our inside knowledge of the industry and in 2012 we conducted our first salary survey of the facilities management sector. The survey proved immensely popular both with job seekers and recruiters, providing insightful information into the future of the industry. Due to its success we decided to create a more comprehensive salary survey for 2014 to determine what matters the most to facilities managers and establish any significant changes to the sector over the past two years. At Maxwell Stephens facilities management is truly our speciality, so should you wish to discuss any of our findings with us, feel free to get in touch. Our contact details can be found at the back of the survey. BACKGROUND 4 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment\n\n5. Welcome to Maxwell Stephens’ 2014 Facilities Management Salary Survey. Our 2014 salary survey looks at remuneration and benefits within the industry and compares qualifications, training, job satisfaction and general well-being within the facilities management sector. We at Maxwell Stephens wanted to determine what matters the most to facilities managers and provide a true representation of what working within the industry is like. In completing this survey we received a total of 568 responses from FM professionals working across all levels and a wide range of sectors throughout the UK. The collection of data took place over several weeks at the beginning of 2014 and invitations to complete the survey were sent to over 10,000 facilities management professionals. This has proved to be the largest salary survey we have completed to date and we would like to thank everyone who took part in the survey; your input has proved invaluable and allowed us to publish some extremely interesting findings into the future of facilities management. INTRODUCTION 5 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment\n\n6. Male Female Are you... Confidence seems to have returned to the industry since the economic uncertainty demonstrated in our 2012 results; permanent employment levels have remained unchanged and on the whole salaries have been steadily increasing over the last few years. Most of our respondents indicated that they were also confident of a further salary increase in the next 12 months. So what matters the most to facilities managers? We found that interesting and engaging work topped salary for the first time since 2012 for what FMs valued the most in their career. Pensions were the most valued benefit when considering a new position and a ‘fresh challenge’ was what the majority of individuals indicated as attracting them to their current position. Our findings provided a wide range of useful information and indicated that remuneration was only one of the factors for choosing a career in facilities management. Since our 2012 survey the gender divide within the FM industry has remained largely unchanged; the vast majority of our responses came from males with only 23% of responses coming from females working in the industry. 18% of Director/ Head of FM positions were filled by females. Although the numbers of females in senior positions were still low, it was encouraging to see that generally there were a greater number of females employed in senior roles since our 2012 results. OVERVIEW GENDER 6 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment\n\n7. It is clear that overall the industry is still largely male dominated however, our responses demonstrated much greater gender equality within office management roles, where 48% of FM professionals were female. This could potentially indicate the beginnings of a longer term trend toward a less male dominated industry as emerging professionals develop their skills and experience before taking on more senior positions. More recently the role of a facility manager has moved away from the traditional ‘trade’ orientated and male dominated image to one that is more customer service orientated and more equal in who it employs. Greater gender diversity within the industry could perhaps therefore be on the horizon with this strong change in image. GENDER Continued 7 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment Gender and roles of FM professionals 0 20 40 60 80 100 Male Female\n\n8. Of our 568 respondents it was interesting to see that 58% were aged over 45. It would appear that the industry has an extremely low representation of young college leavers and graduates with just over 1% of respondents aged 18-24. It seems experience and knowledge of the industry is preferred by employers before the more junior entrants are able to secure a role in the industry. 72% of directors and heads of FM were found to be over the age of 45 64% of facilities assistants were below the age of 34 Generally the age of FM professionals tended to reflect their proficiency levels. Overall older individuals held higher level roles, whereas younger professionals held more entry level positions such as facilities assistant roles. The findings suggest the importance of experience within the industry. However with only 16% of FM professionals below the age of 35, the impact of an ageing workforce could be devastating for the sector if new professionals fail to be attracted in to FM. The attraction of new professionals into the industry should perhaps become more of a priority for employers in the future. Apprenticeships, graduate programmes and internships would provide an excellent entry route for young professionals in to the industry where senior experts could transfer their knowledge to junior professionals, therefore ensuring a highly competent future workforce within the FM industry. AGE 8 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 Age Range\n\n9. It was encouraging to see that 92% of FM professionals who completed the survey are currently employed on a permanent basis, a level which has remained unchanged since our 2012 survey. Only 8% of professionals stated they were working in temporary or interim employment. The sustained number of professionals in permanent employment would suggest that employers are feeling confident with the state of the economy as they continue to move away from the trend of hiring people on temporary/interim contracts in an effort to reduce costs and increase flexibility during economic uncertainty. EMPLOYMENT STATUS 9 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment In Temporary/Interim Employment In Permanent Employment How would you describe your current employment status?\n\n10. As a national FM recruitment firm we see a large proportion of the roles we recruit for coming from London and the South East, a trend reflected in the responses we received from the survey. According to our responses London and the South East account for 57% of FM roles; a figure which has increased by 17% since our 2012 findings. Clearly the largest proportion of the FM industry is based in and led by the capital, but in other large cities across the UK such as Manchester and Liverpool there is a strong demand for facilities management. The lowest represented areas for FM roles, according to our responses were Northern Ireland, Wales and the North East.

REGION Continued 11 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment Based on our responses, average salaries by region followed the trend that you might expect with the highest average salaries coming from London and the South East. The lowest paid regions were the North West, North East and Northern Ireland, however, this may in part be a reflection of the low response rates we received from individuals working in these areas. It is interesting to note, however that FM professionals who stated that they worked across the UK with ‘National Remit’ responsibilities averaged the highest salary overall of £63,000 (based on 37 responses).

According to our responses over half (52%) of FM professionals specialise in Total FM. Clearly businesses continue to see the value of having multi- skilled professionals in both hard and soft services as standard. Interestingly twice as many of our respondents stated that they specialised in Soft FM compared with Hard FM. This was a big change from the results of our 2012 survey which saw these two specialisms more equally weighted. Proportionately twice as many females specialised in Soft FM; 22.66% compared with a figure of 10.68% for males.

In comparison 55% of individuals specialising in Total FM received over £46,000 as a basic salary. Soft Services and Building Management were the worst paying specialisms with only 36% of individuals earning over £46,000.

Since our last survey we have seen a greater variety of responses from individuals working across a wide range of industries, which has led us to include some new industry sectors in our 2014 findings. Law & Legal Services as well as Media & Publishing were two of our most popular additions Property and real estate remains the biggest employers of FM professionals since our 2012 survey with 26% of respondents stating they work in this sector (compared with 30% in 2012). 10% of respondents were working in the finance, banking and insurance sector (compared with 11% in 2012). However, the engineering and construction sector was represented less well this year with only 5% of individuals stating they work within this industry compared with 13% in 2012. Other industry sectors such as IT & Communications and the Charity & Not for Profit sector have remained largely unchanged since 2012 in terms of their representation.

Based on our responses we found that the highest paid FMs worked within the healthcare & pharmaceutical industry, with finance, banking and insurance professionals close behind. The worst paid industries, however, were found to be transport and logistics and the charity and not for profit sector.

The findings of our recent survey suggest that salaries have generally increased over the last two years; with 12% of our respondents in receipt of a basic salary of more than £75,000 and only 6% of respondents receiving less than £25,000. The largest portion of individuals indicated that they were in receipt of a salary of £36,000 to £45,000. SALARY 16 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment Up to £25,000 £26-35,000 £36 - 45,000 £46-60,000 £61-75,000 £91,000+ £76 - 90,000 What is your current basic salary?\n\n17. Since our 2012 survey the representation of different FM roles has largely unchanged; 20% of our respondents indicated that they were working in Director / Head of FM roles (compared with 22% in 2012). ‘Head of Engineering’ was still the lowest represented role within the industry with only 2% of respondents indicating that they worked in this position. The biggest changes however came from Office Management positions; only 4% of respondents indicated that they worked within this position compared with 20% in 2012. Twice as many individuals indicated that they worked in a senior FM position compared to 2012 (16% related to 9% in 2012). The largest number of responses (29%) came from individuals that worked in regional or multi-site FM roles. Interestingly this was identical to the result we saw in 2012.

Individuals working within a Director / Head of FM position on average earned the highest salary of £73,013, whereas entry level positions such as facilities assistants earned the least; £28,682. This figure of £28,682 has increased considerably since 2012 when the comparative average salary for a facilities assistant was only £19,590. We further analysed our findings in terms of the number of individuals falling within certain salary brackets: AVERAGE SALARY PER JOB TITLE 18 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment Average Salary by Job Title £0 £10,000 £20,000 £30,000 £40,000 £50,000 £70,000 £60,000 £80,000 Director/HeadofFM HeadofEngineerring SeniorFacilities Manager(HQ) RegionalorMulti-Site FacilitiesManager OfficeManager Single-SiteFacilities Manager FacilitiesSupervisor FacilitiesAssistant\n\n19.

As few as 3% of FMs indicated that they received no benefits at all in their current position and half of all of our responses indicated that more than 6% of their total remuneration package is made up of benefits. Our findings indicated that the percentage of benefits individuals received as part of their total package tended to increase with salary; 36% of top earners received over 21% of their total package in benefits, whereas 72% of FMs earning up to £25,000 received only 0-5% in benefits. The property and finance, banking and insurance sectors were found to be the most well rewarded in terms of the benefit package individuals received: 10% of FMs working within the finance, banking and insurance industry received over 25% of their total package in benefits.

Other popular benefits included life insurance and bonus schemes and only 3% of FMs stated that they received no benefits at all.

BENEFITS/BONUSES Continued 21 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment The vast majority (74%) of individuals confirmed that one of the most important benefits they looked for when seeking a new role was a pension scheme. This is most likely due to government changes and the uncertainty of future state pension contributions. Other important benefits individuals looked for were annual leave and bonus schemes. It was reassuring to see that generally employers seem to matching the benefits they offer with what employees value the most. Which of the following benefits do you consider the most important when looking for a new job role? 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Pension ShareIncentives BonusScheme/commission LifeInsurance FlexibleWorking PaidOvertime CarAllowance AnnualLeave GymMembership NoneOfTheAbove\n\n22. It was good to see that the majority of facilities management professionals seem to be well qualified; with 64% of respondents holding at least a HNC/ HND or equivalent (although less reassuringly this figure has decreased by 10% since our 2012 findings). 38% of our respondents, however, have achieved a degree or masters and less than 6% of individuals indicated that they had achieved no qualifications at all.

This is not unexpected when the high costs of obtaining these qualifications are taken into consideration.\n\n23. Interestingly, our findings indicated a positive correlation between salaries and qualifications; with higher qualified FMs largely rewarded with higher salaries: 31% of respondents earning over £76,000 have a Masters or MBA, whereas in comparison only 9% of individuals earning a salary of up to £60,000 had these qualifications. Our results would suggest that although qualifications aren’t essential to reach the most senior positions, they do generally seem to have a positive effect on salary, which makes them something worth considering for future investment. What other qualifications do you hold that are relevant to your role? Employers seem to placing increasing emphasis on the value of additional qualifications such as a NEBOSH and/or IOSH certificate. Nearly every employer we deal with now asks for one or both of these qualifications as standard, and encouragingly 82% of our respondents indicated that they already held one or both of these. NearlyaquarterofFMs,however,statedthattheyholdnoadditionalqualifications. Although these qualifications are not a substitute for experience, most employers seem to place emphasis on NEBOSH and IOSH qualifications as a benchmark for competence. Consequently, it would certainly be worthwhile for individuals seeking employment to make sure that they have these to help them secure their next job role.

Extremely Valuable Valuable Somewhat Valuable Not Valuable How valuable do you feel your qualifications were in securing your first facilities management position? Extremely Valuable Valuable Somewhat Valuable Not Valuable How valuable do you feel your qualifications were in securing your most recent position? We received mixed responses from the following questions regarding qualifications. However, the vast majority of individuals felt that their qualifications were valuable to some degree in helping them secure their first and most recent facilities management position. Only 31% of respondents felt that their qualifications weren’t valuable in helping them secure their first role. Nearly half (48%) of individuals felt their qualifications were extremely valuable to valuable in helping them secure their most recent position. Nearlyaquarterofrespondentshoweverindicatedthattheyfelttheirqualifications were not valuable at all (a notably smaller percentage, however, than the number of individuals indicating this for their first FM position) Overall qualifications were considered more valuable in helping individuals secure their most recent position compared with their first FM position, which could perhaps be an indication of the importance of experience over qualifications before being able to make a move in to the industry. VALUE OF QUALIFICATIONS 24 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment\n\n25. This year we found a much wider variety of professional bodies that FM professionals were a member of; CMI, IOSH, CIPS and FMA proved to be some of the most popular that we hadn’t included on our original list. BIFM members remained the most prominent with 70% of our respondents indicating they were members - a figure which has decreased by 5% since our last survey which could be a reflection of the wider variety of responses we saw for different professional memberships. FMs are perhaps beginning to favour more role specific professional memberships. It was encouraging to see, however, that such a large majority of individuals still value being a member of a professional institute. Individuals working in director or senior FM positions were found to have the greatest variety of professional memberships, often being a member of two or more. Individuals working in more junior roles, such as facilities assistants, tended to only be a member of BIFM and were far more likely than any of other job roles to have no membership to a professional body.

Our findings proved extremely informative as to the working lifestyle of the majority of professionals working within the FM industry. On the whole FMs seem to work rather demanding hours compared with the national UK average. According to the Office of National Statistics, the average working week for full-time workers in 2014 is 39.1 hours; the majority of respondents to our survey, however, work a minimum of 41 hours a week, and nearly a quarter (23%) of FMs were found to be working over 51 hours a week. How often are you required to work unsociable hours? DespitethelongerthanaverageworkingweekforthemajorityofFMprofessionals, the impact on work/life balance seems to be minimal as 60% indicated that they are rarely asked to work unsociable hours, and 6% of individuals said they are never asked to work outside their contracted hours.

WORKING LIFESTYLE Continued 27 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment What attracted you to the FM Industry? As we saw in our earlier findings it appears as though longer working hours are considered to be the norm within the FM industry with only 12% of individuals stating that work/life balance attracted them to the industry. The vast majority of respondents said they were attracted to the FM industry due to the variety of work. Opportunities for career progression were also high on respondents agenda; however, many individuals additionally commented that they entered the industry by chance rather than being attracted to it for a specific reason. Over 70% of respondents stated that they were attracted to the FM industry due to the variety of work, while a third of respondents stated they were attracted to their current position due to the ‘fresh challenge’ that it gave them. In comparison only 13% of respondents stated that salary was what attracted them to the FM industry What attracted you to the FM Industry? 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 CareerProgression VarietyofWork Work/LifeBalance Salary JobSecurity PersonalInterest FastPace\n\n28. How likely are you to change employers in the next 12 months? The majority of individuals (56%) suggested that they are likely to change employers within the next 12 months. ‘Job hopping’ has certainly become more of the norm within the industry recently with many professionals now moving jobs more regularly to increase their experience, skills and salary prospects. Only 11% of individuals felt fully confident that they would not change employers in the next 12 months. Very Fairly Not Very Not at All How likely are you to change employers in the next 12 months? What attracted you to your current position? Surprisingly, only 13% of individuals indicated that a better salary was what attracted them to their current role. A ‘fresh challenge’ was what was considered the major attraction by most, with 33% of individuals indicating this choice. Career advancement also proved to be very important to individuals with 27% of respondents indicating this choice.

As our previous findings would suggest, movement between roles seems to have become more fluid since our 2012 results. 44% of our respondents indicated that they had been with their employer for less than 3 years (a figure which has increased by just over 10% since our last survey). In comparison only 16% of individuals stated that they have been with their employer for more than 10 years. 80% of respondents were fairly to very satisfied with their current position. Whilst on the whole these findings are positive, 21% of respondents still felt unsatisfied with their current employment which does demonstrate room for improvement. Employees that are satisfied have a positive knock on effect relating to the overall service delivery and business growth of the organisation. Retaining talent and increasing employee satisfaction should therefore increasingly become more of a focus for organisations. Since we looked at earlier what attracted individuals to their current position it would be interesting to find out if their expectations were met, perhaps this could be one of the reasons for such a high level of employee dissatisfaction? WORKING LIFESTYLE Continued 29 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment Very Fairly Not Very Not at All How satisfied are you overall with your current job?\n\n30. Clearlyindustryexperienceisimportantwithinthefacilitiesmanagement profession as the majority of respondents (60%) had over 11 years’ experience within the industry. Only a small minority of individuals (15%) had less than 5 years’ experience within FM. We found that seniority and job role generally increased with years of experience: The majority of directors/ head of FMs (44.35%) were found to have over 20 years of experience in the FM industry, while individuals with more entry level positions, such as facility assistants, tended to have less than 5 years experience.

When did you last receive a salary increase? The overwhelming majority of respondents received a salary increase in 2013, and many others received one in the beginning of 2014. It was refreshing to see that the vast majority of employers are willing to pay more for the right level of skills and knowledge. By what percentage did you salary last increase? Our findings have remained largely unchanged since our 2012 survey with the majority of individuals (66%) stating that they received a salary increase of up to 5%, and 18% of individuals stating that they received a salary increase of more than 5%. Interestingly, 75% of the respondents who received a salary increase of over 5% received it during the last year, which would suggest employers are feeling confident about the future of the industry and are willing to invest more in order to retain the best employees. Increased by More than 5% Increased by Up to 5% Remained the same Decreased By what percentage did your salary last increase?\n\n32. Do you think your salary accurately reflects your role? Despite the encouraging findings for salary increases during the last year, over half of all the individuals questioned still didn’t believe that their salary accurately reflected their role. Employers perhaps need to further increase remuneration if they want to retain their top talent. SALARY INCREASE Continued 32 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment Yes No Do you think your salary accurately reflects your role? People are generally feeling optimistic about future salary increases; over half of all respondents expect their salary to increase by up to 5% in the next year, while 18% of respondents expect their salary to increase by more than 5% in the next year.

Where do you expect your next career move to come from? It was interesting to see where FM professionals felt their next career move would come from. Encouragingly, nearly a quarter of respondents are expecting to gain an internal promotion. However, by far, recruitment agencies seem to be the most popular choice with 37% of respondents indicating that they felt this is where their next career move would come from. This level of indication seemed to be consistent across all industries and job roles within FM. The only exception was that of directors and heads of FM where 54% believed their next career move would come from being head hunted. This is not an unexpected finding as their proven expert knowledge and experience will be in high demand amongst potential employers.\n\n34.

Despite the industry being generally well paid, with over 72% of respondents receiving a salary of over £36,000 (almost £10,000 above the UK average of £26,500) salary did not top the list for what facilities managers value the most in their career. Interesting/ engaging work came out on top which is certainly a huge change from our 2012 results where the vast majority of respondents stated salary was the most important to their career. With the overwhelming majority of our respondents receiving a salary increase since 2012, perhaps FM’s are now feeling more secure with their pay and other factors such as challenging work, responsibility and recognition are becoming more important.\n\n35. CONCLUSIONS 35 SALARY SURVEY 2014 Maxwell Stephens Recruitment The industry certainly appears more confident since our last salary survey in 2012, with the majority of individuals receiving a salary increase in the last year and many more feeling optimistic that they will receive a further salary increase in the next 12 months. It was reassuring to see that salaries on the whole seem to have been increasing steadily over the last two years. Remuneration, however, is no longer considered the most important element of the position to facilities managers, who instead regard interesting engaging work more highly. Our findings have proved extremely informative and show there is increasing importance now being placed on the variety of work, recognition and responsibility within a facilities manager’s career. Despite the majority of individuals indicating that they were satisfied in their current job role, over half of our respondents still felt they were likely to change employers in the next 12 months. This would suggest that movement between job roles has become more of the norm since our last survey. The survey also identified that the majority of FMs have over 11 years of experience within the facilities management and it is clear that experience is still highly regarded within the industry. Despite this, however, it was encouraging to see that the majority of FMs are still highly qualified, and that their salaries tended to reflect this. The prospects within the facilities management industry on the whole look optimistic. Not only do these roles appear more secure and better paid, they also provide the opportunity to become involved in a challenging, wide variety of work, which is what most of our respondents indicated as valuing the most in their career."
