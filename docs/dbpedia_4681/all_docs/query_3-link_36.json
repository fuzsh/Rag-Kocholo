        "text": "Netflix’s Paava Kadhaigal consists of four stories written by Vetri Maaran, Sudha Kongara Prasad, Gautham Menon and Vignesh Shivan. Vetri Maaran’s short film, titled Oor Iravu, which runs for 36 minutes, stars Sai Pallavi and Prakash Raj in the lead roles.\n\nPaava Kadhaigal explores how love, pride and honour influence complex relationships through four intricate and beautiful stories. Oor Iravu talks about how a father would go to the extent of killing his pregnant daughter in the name of honour. In an in-depth conversation with IndiaToday.in, Sai Pallavi talks about how impromptu her performance was, working with Vetri Maaran and how Oor Iravu has educated her.\n\nadvertisement\n\nExcerpts from our conversation:\n\nWhen Vetri Maaran narrated the script, at which point did you decide to do the film?\n\nHe [Vetri Maaran] didn’t give me the complete script. Only on the day of the shoot, I came to know the dialogues and setup. I generally like being prepared when I walk on to a set. This was a different experience for me. He gave me the gist of what happens and the journey my character and my dad's will go through. Deep inside my heart, I wanted to speak my heart out. We have been exposed to crimes against women in the name of pride. We have a group of people who give excuses for their doings like how my dad [played by Prakash Raj] does in the film. It doesn’t make it right. What is the use of protecting a culture when you don’t have humanity?\n\nI watched Visaranai and was shocked. It made me uncomfortable because I came to realise that it [police brutality] existed. I realised that Oor Iravu is going to be 30 minutes but going to be as elaborate as it gets. I found the intense moments in the film very painful. I was counting on that emotion because when people watched it, it could make them introspect. It could be the start of a conversation. This was me telling myself that I was contributing. In a way, I felt less guilty. I wouldn’t want to sit at home and cry thinking about what was happening in the world. Maybe I am blessed with this form of art as I can express. I found this quite liberating.\n\nYou said you like to go the sets prepared. How did you prep for the role especially when you didn’t have the script?\n\nI’ve played a pregnant woman in Maari 2 before. It’s different when you have pillow stuffed and when you have a prosthetic tummy. It changes a lot. What I had to change was the way I walked. I walk very fast in my day-to-day life. Even when I slowed it down, it was of normal speed. So, I had to slow it down even more. I had Vetri sir tell me to walk slower even as we were shooting.\n\nOnce you have a prosthetic tummy, it puts a lot of pressure on your body. You wouldn’t be able to breathe for a while. I called my mom and said, “Mom, it’s hurting.” She said, “That’s how it is when you’re pregnant. It’s hard to breathe. Pallavi, it’s 2-3 days. So, get it done with.” I think women are goddesses to go through that pain, still remain happy and want to have a second child. Otherwise, I didn’t have much to prep because I was not aware of what I was going to do in the scene. It was a raw experience because I did what I felt at the moment on the shoot. The emotions were organic as I didn’t prep much.\n\nWe’ve heard directors say that you are involved in the script and Vetri Maaran believes in utmost detailing. What were your conversations like?\n\nI asked him, “Sir, you haven’t given me the script,” and he said, “I’ll give you the script when I know what I am going to do. I was shocked.” We were one day away from the shoot and he tells me this. I started wondering what if he doesn’t know what he wants to do. You have experiences in the past where the script doesn’t get translated on screen. I always have that insecurity and now I am even more scared. I think it was the blind faith I had in Vetri sir, it worked for this script. If I was that prepared, I think it wouldn’t be as real.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs I was shooting a scene, Vetri sir asked me to say the dialogue, which hit my heart and I cried more. For example, I say the dialogue, “Appa naan dane unga favourite (Dad, I’m your favourite),” it’s a simple one. But, when you say it at that point, it has a lot of meaning. He told me this dialogue half an hour before the shot and when I said it out loud, it hurt me so much. I felt, “Dad you’re willing to see me go through pain for some belief of yours.” It’s the most intense script I had worked on and the one that hurt me the most. Before this, it was Kali. In the second half when the lorry driver chases me, I actually got scared. After that, it was Oor Iravu.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe most disturbing aspect of Oor Iravu is that honour killing still exists in our country. Was this running in your mind when you shot for it?\n\nIt was after I shot for it that I felt it. When I was shooting for the film, I didn’t realise how it would play out. I was going through multiple emotions at that time. In the film, they brought me home and they’re doing this to me. I was unaware of the impact that it would have on society. It was when I dubbed for it that I realised. I disconnected from the character and when I watched it, it was more disturbing. I am glad that Vetri Maaran has done it in a way that one might feel bad for what their daughter might go through if they decide to do it to her. If the film starts a conversation, it’d be the start of a change. I am glad I am a part of this project that could be a conversation starter. I think if people can see and feel the pain, it might work.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOor Iravu from Paava Kadhaigal showed the disturbing reality. Do you think sensitive issues like this should show reality and not glorify it for the sake of cinematic liberty?\n\nAll of us have that trait in us that when people point out our flaws, we get defensive. We say that there’s a reason for their action. We’ve made it so normal that we fail to question it. How many of us are okay with sharing a plate or a glass with a helper or maid? In the grassroots level, if we start seeing change, we might be able to treat people equally. We wouldn’t have to take pride in coming from a particular community, which is something we [humans] created. It is not an alien thing where one person does it. All of us do that in some capacity. In my village, people from other community leave their slippers outside. They have been taught that way for ages and they do it even if we don’t ask them to. I never realised it. But, after working with such directors and being part of this kind of cinema, you are educated politically. You try to see things which you have avoided all these years. I’ve grown as a person, educated and been taught a lesson. So, I hope we all change.\n\nCan you talk us through your emotions during the climax portions?\n\nI was appalled thinking about how my dad puts me in a room where I am crying in pain. At one point, he comes and sees if am dead and he has come to that level. At that point, the baby inside me stopped moving. I had this internal conflict that I am his child and I am carrying my child, unable to help. I was being a child and a mother at the same time. I was torn apart. Even if you turn 50, your parents pamper you. I was thinking where is the love? All that I had was pent up frustration. That was a disturbing thought of being betrayed by your father. I would want to be with my father but not at the cost of my child. So, that battle was strenuous. I remember being exhausted. Whenever I finished performing the scene or dubbed for it, I would come home and cry for a while. Even talking about it makes me feel weak.\n\nBut, it also worries me that me talking about it so much would give out a different impression. But, it’s a very internal thing. Few films have an impact on you internally. Professionally, there may be roles that wouldn’t help you much as an actor, but internally it would shake you. This was one of the films that shook me from within.\n\nWe saw you write a medical exam in Trichy. Are you looking to practice medicine?\n\nI was going crazy during the lockdown. I like to stay at home, but I like to be disciplined as well. I was starting to forget what I learnt because I haven’t touched my books in four years. I felt so betrayed thinking that I have put six years into medicine and this is not how I would want to go down. That’s how I went back to books because I wanted to use the time. I was thinking if I had given my exam before, I could have gone to the hospital during the Covid-19 pandemic. I felt so useless. I’ve put six years of hard work, my blood and soul into medicine. This is one time where they need medical personnel and I wasn’t ready. That’s why I thought of giving the exam. There might be another time. Well, I hope we don’t have another pandemic. If there’s another time, I want to be useful. That’s what drove me to prepare for the exam.\n\nALSO SEE | Paava Kadhaigal Movie Review: A timely anthology on caste pride and honour\n\nALSO SEE | Netflix's Paava Kadhaigal to release on December 18.
