        "text": "Actor Vetri, who has been around for almost 15 years in Tamil cinema, has finally arrived as a villain in Nayanthara’s Dora. “I started as a dubbing artiste for serials and commercials. Though I was acting in small roles, I waited for the right chance. When I came to know about that Doss Ramaswamy sir was looking out for an actor for the character of a north Indian paani poori seller, I approached him. He rejected me stating that my native look would not suit the character, who needed to speak Hindi. So I changed my looks, and also worked at an outlet selling paani pooris before getting selected!” Vetri says.\n\nHeaping laurels on Nayan, he said, “Despite her stature, she was very down-to-earth. She also took great care while filming an action sequence, when she had to strangle my neck. While shooting a particular scene in which she hit me with a cloth stuffed with glass pieces, I writhed in pain... but at the end of the day, when audiences felt I was a real villain while watching the film, all the pain vanished!"
