A remake of the 1987 Hindi film Khudgarz, itself based on Jeffrey Archer's 1979 novel Kane and Abel, it stars Rajinikanth, Khushbu and Sarath Babu with Radha Ravi, Nizhalgal Ravi and Manorama in supporting roles. The film revolves around Annaamalai, a poor milkman, and Ashok, a wealthy hotelier, who have been friends since childhood, a friendship opposed by Ashok's father who attempts to create a rift between the two.\n\nAnnaamalai was announced in March 1992 with Vasanth as director, though he later opted out for personal reasons. Suresh Krissna replaced him as director, and also contributed to the screenplay while Shanmugasundaram wrote the dialogue. Principal photography began the same month and the entire filming process lasted 45 working days. The music was composed by Deva and the lyrics for the songs were written by Vairamuthu. The cinematography was handled by P. S. Prakash and the editing by the duo Ganesh Kumar."
