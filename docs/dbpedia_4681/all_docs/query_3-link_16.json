        "text": "\"Give a man a fish, feed him for the day; Teach a man to fish and feed him for his life\" says a Chinese proverb! That is the life changing power of knowledge! Thanks to FM Rainbow 101.4 for having created such a platform today for sharing knowledge generously for 60 minutes. Through the programme 'Vetri Nichayam' (means 'Success for Sure') I had the opportunity to share views, information, knowledge and interact with people about role of behavioural skills and self-initiated change in enhancing performance at workplace/business. We discussed at length about the importance of aspects such as communicating with clarity, emotional intelligence, interpersonal relationships etc. It was a bit challenging, yet exciting when RJ Santhosh Raj requested me to explain the art of setting SMART goals in simple terms that a lay man can understand. Creating visibility about our good work to the top management/clients/customers is a great opportunity that many of us shy away from and offer a cake walk to our colleagues/seniors to claim credit out of our hard work and climb up the ladder. I emphasized on this point and encouraged the listeners to utilize every opportunity available to them to showcase their work without any inhibitions! In today's world of knowledge and new developments in every field it is imperative for both employees and entrepreneurs to keep themselves abreast of happening and developments in their field by learning continuously. With such a powerful platform like radio which can reach lakhs of people in my hands, I did not miss the opportunity to enlighten the listeners about the availability of knowledge resources on the internet with which they can learn and certify themselves on multitude of skills from institutions of global repute without any major investment. Stephen Covey's four quadrants of time management was a very simple and powerful tip shared today to manage time very well as stated by one of the listeners who dialled in. The master stroke of the day was the quote from Chanakya Neethi about effective planning while beginning any task. Being an admirer of traditional wisdom of India, it was a proud moment for me to mention about Chankaya's management philosophy and its relevance tin today's business! The thoughtful questions raised by RJ Santhosh Raj were a great trigger for me to share knowledge abundantly to the listeners. I should certainly thank him for this! While I have handled workshops and helped many people to develop the above skills in my decade long HR career, the great difference that this show has brought to me was its ability to benefit a variety of audience from all walks of life. It was a great sense of satisfaction that I could feel when a tailor expressed his confidence to improve upon his communication and English speaking skills from the tips that he got through this show! Radio is certainly a powerful medium that can be effectively utilized for the benefit of this nation! Looking forward to your comments and interaction."
