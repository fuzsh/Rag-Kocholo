        "text": "Synopsis\n\nDespite exit poll predictions, the BJP failed to secure any seats in the southern state after multiple rounds of vote counting concluded on Tuesday. Candidates affiliated with the DMK and its coalition, including prominent figure Kanimozhi, secured significant victories in declared constituencies. Given the substantial margins, it's highly likely that all other candidates from the Dravidian party and its allies—Congress, CPI, CPI(M), VCK, MDMK, and IUML—will also emerge victorious. Notable figures like Dayanidhi Maran (Central Chennai) and T R Baalu (Sriperumbudur) are expected to clinch their seats as well.\n\nAfter several rounds of couting of vote ended on Tuesday, the BJP was not able to open its account in the southern state, despite exit polls predictions. Candidates belonging to the DMK and its allies including star nominee Kanimozhi won by huge margins in constituencies where results have been declared and going by the unassailable margins, all other candidates of the Dravidian party and allies Congress, CPI, CPI(M), VCK, MDMK and IUML are all sure to emerge victorious including Dayanidhi Maran (Central Chennai) and T R Baalu (Sriperumbudur).\n\nEven in the constituencies of Coimbatore and Dharmapuri, where BJP and PMK (Saffron party's ally) were confident of a win fell into the DMK's kitty. In Puducherry, where the BJP had hopes of winning has gone the Congress way with senior leader VE Vaithilingam set to win by a big margin.\n\nA key takeaway from the Lok Sabha polls is the continuing popularity of the ruling DMK, led by Stalin and the perfect cohesion at the ground level among alliance partners. Another outcome is the significant contribution of a split in the anti-DMK votes in the victory of candidates belonging to the DMK combine in a number of constituencies.\n\nA many as 950 candidates were in fray in Lok Sabha polls for Tamil Nadu. The state also recorded a voter turnout of 69.72 per cent in the April 19 single-phase election, which marked the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nHere is complete list of winners:\n\nWhat Exit polls predicted?\n\nAccording to the Axis My India exit poll, the BJP-led NDA is expected to win 2-4 seats in Tamil Nadu. The INDIA bloc, which has both DMK and Congress in it, is set to win 33-37 seats.\n\nThe exit poll predicted a marked rise in NDA's vote share in Tamil Nadu which is expected to go to 22 per cent. INDIA bloc is predicted to get 46 per cent. Tamil Nadu sends 39 MPs to the Lok Sabha.\n\nAccording to News 18 exit poll, NDA is expected to win 1-3 seats in Tamil Nadu while the INDIA bloc can win 36-39 seats in the state.\n\nPolling for the earlier six phases of Lok Sabha elections was held on April 19, April 26, May 7, May 13, May 20 and May 25. Assembly polls have also been held in Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. Odisha is seeing simultaneous polls to Lok Sabha and assembly in the last four phases.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nRemember the July 19 global computer outage?
