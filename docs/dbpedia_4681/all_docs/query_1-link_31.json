        "text": "He is young and a do-gooder. He is a crowd-pulling cult figure. He is a money-minting superhit generator. More than anything else, he is Thalapathy Vijay.\n\nRarely does it get bigger than being Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, who churns out Rs 1,000-crore blockbusters and is Thalapathy (commander) to millions of fans across the world.\n\nTamil Nadu has always been about people power cults and superstar Vijay is at the top of that.\n\nadvertisement\n\nVijay has now made a promise to the people of Tamil Nadu, and he is coming with his political party -- the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK).\n\nFirstly, let's get the facts right. Just being a superstar doesn't guarantee success in Tamil Nadu politics. We saw Rajinikanth squirm away.\n\nBut the 49-year-old Thalapathy Vijay is much more than being a superstar.\n\nHe is a student who has for over a decade studied the political geography and history of Dravidian politics. Its successes and failures. And he has taken lessons.\n\nThalapathy Vijay is ready now. And so is Tamil Nadu.\n\nVIJAY’S CALCULATED DECISION TO ENTER POLITICS\n\nPeriyar tried to rid Tamil Nadu of idols. The craving for worship turned people to on-screen demigods.\n\nTamil politics has seen a plethora of stars from the Kollywood cineverse. Starting with MG Ramachandran (MGR), to K Karunanidhi, to J Jayalalithaa, Vijayakanth, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth.\n\nBut not everyone was lapped up by the voters.\n\nIf cult-like stardom matters, so does ideology. If Kamal Haasan couldn’t make a dent due to his centrist stance, Rajanikanth’s “spiritual politics” failed to hit the right notes with the people.\n\nThe timing, too, has to be right.\n\n“Tamil Nadu was known for demigod cult leaders and there is a sudden deficit of such leaders, which means there are no organic crowd-pullers. The current leaders of the DMK and the AIADMK need money to mobilise cadres,” a person working in Vijay's political team tells IndiaToday.In on condition of anonymity.\n\nVijay has been preparing to enter politics and working towards it for over a decade now.\n\n“That is why he named his fan group Vijay Makkal Iyekkam. Makkal means people. It is a people’s front and not a just fan front. The front has been nurtured with infrastructure on the lines of political parties. It has booth committees in 156 of Tamil Nadu's 234 constituencies,” says the member of Vijay's political team.\n\nVijay, now, will be seeking to convert his fan base into an electoral base.\n\nIn the past one year, Vijay Makkal Iyekkam has rolled out several welfare schemes named after Periyar, K Kamaraj and BR Ambedkar. The fan outfit is facilitating evening tuition classes, eye and blood donation initiatives and free breakfast initiatives across Tamil Nadu.\n\n“Vijay is preparing his fans to be the future cadre base of his party. There is a long-term strategy and plan in place,” the Team Vijay member adds.\n\nIn his statement on Friday, Vijay said that the “goal is to contest and win the upcoming 2026 assembly elections and bring about the fundamental political change that people want”. He also said neither will he be contesting the 2024 Lok Sabha elections nor will he back any party.\n\nThe idea is clear. Vijay wants to be the primary force in Tamil Nadu politics and not an alternative force.\n\nExperts say that the timing is right as there is a lack of strong Dravidian leadership in the state, the government is in an autopilot mode and Tamil Nadu is seeing the growth of Tamil chauvinistic politics of Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK) led by Senthamizhan Seeman.\n\nWhile Dravidian politics is accommodative and takes along the Malayalam-, Kannada- and Telugu-speaking people of the state, Tamil nationalist politics is more about son-of-the-soil rights and Tamil pride.\n\n\"Vijay will bring about a hybrid of the Dravidian-Tamil ideology in his politics,\" according to the person in Vijay's team.\n\nadvertisement\n\nCertain sections, however, have tried to highlight the 'Joseph' part of Vijay for political gains.\n\n“Joseph Vijay is not a practising Christian. He is a Christian Pillai and that is where caste-neutrality comes in. His mother and wife are Hindu Mudaliar. That diversity works in Tamil Nadu,” says Team Vijay member.\n\nHis fan base cuts across caste and community lines. They even pay for tickets to watch the trailers of his movies.\n\nVijay, who started as a child actor in 1984, came to be known as Ilaya Thalapathy (young commander) in the 90s. It was in 2017 that Vijay and director Atlee changed the epithet to Thalapathy (commander).\n\nThe proclamation that the Thalapathy had arrived was made through the poster of 'Mersal' and came after the death of AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa in 2016. His fans were elated and celebrated the occasion like a festival.\n\nTHALAPATHY VIJAY -- THE SUPERSTAR BRAND\n\nVijay is a global brand. Much bigger than anyone has ever been, say experts.\n\nRarely has anyone from Tamil Nadu dominated the international market like Vijay has.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Vijay comes in the league of MK Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, Tamil Nadu's first superstar, MGR and Rajinikanth. That is the primary league. If you want the chair, you have to come from the primary lineage,\" the member in Vijay's team tells IndiaToday.In.\n\nHe explains how the \"primary superstars are mobocratic, have a mass-frenzy fan base, and are cults equivalent to the political cults and are movers and shakers of commercial movie markets\".\n\nVijay has around 36 superhit movies to his credit, according to IMDB, and is among the top-paid actors in the country today.\n\n“His leaving acting will be at least Rs 1,000-crore annual loss for the Tamil Nadu film industry. He personally makes Rs 400 crore with two films a year,” says a trade expert.\n\nThat Vijay is choosing to take the political plunge during his peak is also a studied decision. Experts say Rajinikanth would have become the chief minister had he made his electoral debut when he was of Vijay’s age, in 1996.\n\nVIJAY AND HIS LEADERSHIP QUALITIES\n\nThe 'Leo' star was hinting at his political entry in the last few audio launches of his movies like 'Mersal' and 'Varisu'.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe has been referring to incidents in Tamil Nadu and India and saying how the condition of the common man needs to be improved.\n\nBeing a superstar is very different from being a politician. Does Vijay have the leadership qualities?\n\n\"Thalapathy is a man of action with power of silence and endurance. He is assertive when he needs to be assertive,\" Bussy Anand, general secretary of Thamizhaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), Vijay's political party, tells IndiaToday.In.\n\n\"He believes in demonstrating his vision first through action before articulating it,\" says Bussy Anand. \"He is humble and doesn't get glory into his head,\" he adds.\n\nVijay's associates say he values people's time and loves his fans unlike any other star does.\n\nThat's why the fans love him back. And that's going to be a big challenge for Team Vijay.\n\nHow do you bring Thalapathy Vijay out to campaign? Videos show how the fan frenzy around him and how he is mobbed.\n\nThat Vijay connects with people off the screen too is the reason for his immense popularity.\n\n\"Once Thalapathy stood for 13 hours non-stop on a stage, awarding the first three toppers from 234 constituencies of Tamil Nadu personally. This shows his resilience and endurance and the love that he reciprocates with people,\" Bussy Anand tells IndiaToday.In.\n\nVijay reiterated his commitment to the people on Friday.\n\n“Politics is not just another career for me. It is a sacred people’s work. I have been preparing myself for it for a long time. Politics is not a hobby for me. That is my deepest desire. I want to fully involve myself in it,” Thalapathy Vijay said.\n\nVijay also said he would quit cinema after completing two films ('The Greatest of All Time' and an untitled film) to become a full-fledged politician.\n\nBut Vijay alone can't pull a party, he needs organisers and able leaders.\n\n\"Vijay will be bringing known faces with clean image into his party. He has certain criteria in his mind to pick those people. Around 20 per cent of the team will be handpicked by him,\" says the person who is working with Vijay's political team.\n\nBussy Anand himself is a good example. A former Congress MLA who has political and organisational experience, Anand has been associated with Vijay's outfit for 26 years.\n\nAnand has helped build a fan outfit into the people's outfit, Vijay Makkal Iyakkham (VMI), and now into a political outfit, the Thamizhaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK).\n\nWHAT TAMIL NADU PEOPLE SAY OF VIJAY’S MOVE\n\n\"The entry of Vijay into politics is a source of great happiness for me,\" Chennai native Gautam Balaji tells IndiaToday.In.\n\n\"Presently, there seems to be a lack of opposition to the DMK in Tamil Nadu. Despite the BJP's efforts to gain a foothold in the state, having a figure like Vijay, a native of Tamil Nadu, could potentially bring about more significant changes,\" says Balaji.\n\nNot everyone is that enthused.\n\n\"No, Tamil Nadu is not craving for a star politician. The state has moved beyond the stars. Vijay is trying his luck here,\" says a Chennai-based doctor.\n\nCoimbatore-based Prasath Selvaraj isn't that optimistic either.\n\n\"I didn't feel anything when I heard about Vijay's entry to politics,\" Selvaraj tells IndiaToday.In. \"I have no high hopes from him.\"\n\n\"Many stars like Vijayakanth and Kamal Haasan entered Tamil politics before. But none of them could make any significant changes. First, Vijay needs to explain exactly what his political stand is,\" adds Selvaraj.\n\nVijay has been making his stance clear, albeit silently.\n\nIn a state which is known for fiery speeches, Vijay is about silent politics.\n\nHe participated in protests supporting the holding of Jallikattu in 2017 and seeking justice for the 13 protesters killed in police firing at Sterlite plant in Tutirocrin in 2018. He carried relief material himself for 1,500 people in January this year in flood-affected Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu.\n\nVijay fans see a change coming not just in Tamil Nadu but in other southern states as well.\n\n\"Vijay boasts a substantial fan base not only in Tamil Nadu but also across all South Indian states. Vijay's decision is poised to have a considerable impact on the political landscape in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana,\" says Gautam Balaji.\n\nWHY THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THALAPATHY VIJAY\n\nVoters in Tamil Nadu have never given a second term to the DMK. MK Stalin’s government doesn’t have much to show either.\n\nThe AIADMK is in decadence and riddled by factionalism.\n\nSo, Vijay has a more than better chance in the 2026 Tamil Nadu polls with the right alliance because there are too many splinter groups catering to the niche voters.\n\n“There isn’t just a leadership vacuum in Tamil Nadu, but a vote-share vacuum as well. There is a 40 per cent untapped vote share beyond the DMK and the AIADMK. They are unable to organically attract voters despite being in alliance with multiple smaller parties,” says the member in Vijay's political team.\n\nThe future of Tamil Nadu politics could well be Thalapathy Vijay, BJP's Annamalai and Udayanidhi Stalin, son of Chief Minister MK Stalin.\n\nWith fans in every household, the 2026 election will most likely be Vijay-centric. Eight crore people will be talking about their Thalapathy. The TRPs will be about Thalapathy Vijay.\n\nWill Thalapathy Vijay emerge as ‘The Greatest of All Time’ (GOAT)? We will have to wait for the screening in 2026. All signs, however, hint at a blockbuster political entry.\n\n(With inputs from Sushim Mukul)"
