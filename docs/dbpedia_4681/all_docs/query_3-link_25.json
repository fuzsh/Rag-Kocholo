        "text": "Thank you for your reply.\n\nYes, That is what I need.\n\nWhat is the reason for the straight line at that point ?\n\nCould you please tell me ?\n\nThe function in that range, jumps from minus infinity to plus infinity. These jumps occur, in the case of rational functions, in correspondence of the poles of the function. This is what happens to your function. We should analytically determine the values of x that make the function infinite. In other words a method could be this: what are the value of x which make the first derivative of f(x) equal to Ï€ / 2.\n\nDear FM,\n\nThank you so much for your reply.\n\nCould you please tell me in detail from the above program, how to determine for which\n\nvalue of x, the function becomes infinite which will be very much helpful to me ?\n\nBecause, in mathcad, for x ranging from -3 to 3, if I enter f(x), it just shows an error as \"divide by zero\" it is difficult to find\n\nfor which values of x, the function becomes infinite ?\n\n> Because, in mathcad, for x ranging from -3 to 3, if I enter f(x), it just shows an error as \"divide by zero\" it is difficult to find for which values of x, the function becomes infinite ?\n\nWhat do YOU think happens here, if x equals zero?\n\nCheck:\n\nSolving for the other denominator gives you the position of the vertical asymptote, the pole:\n\nThe exact value is\n\n> I can't type fnew(x) = NaN on error f(x).\n\nYou can't simply type this, you have to use the symbolic palette to insert the \"on error\" statement\n\n> Also, when I type 1+beta.G(x).Vm^2 solve,x -->\n\n>I am getting error as bad solve variable.\n\nProbably because you have already assigned x a value or range.\n\ntype x:=x before the symbolic solve - this clears the variable (but only for symbolic operations).\n\nBTW - what do you see as my name when you are logged in? You should see WE when you are mot logged in, but after you logged in you should see my full name. Do you see it?\n\n> Since, F.M used your name in the previous comment as W.E so I followed that.\n\nNo problem. He seems to like initials as he is using intials as his \"real\" name, too.\n\nI just wondered if anything with the settings was broken but am glad to hear that all works as it should.\n\nYou have basically 2 errors:\n\n1) The definition of h.plot is wrong in the first line. The wrong version cannot be distinguished from the correct one with the naked eye. In the left placeholder of the \"on error\" statement there is only \"NaN\". Then the whole \"on error\" statement must be assigned to F. You made the assigment \"F <- NaN\" in the left placehoder of the \"on error\" statement.\n\nI tried to make it more clear by highlighting it in yellow and setting parenthesis in the picture below\n\n2) The second problem is the range variable used for plotting. You defined a range from -3 to 2 with a step width of 1. Thats far to coarse. My stepwidth 0.001 may be a bit too fine and you may try -3,-2.99 .. 2.\n\nBTW, you don't have to use a range variable for plotting at all. Delete the definition of x.plot and see how mathcad choses its own range for plotting. This feature is called \"quick plot\". Most the time it works fine but I nevertheless often find it better to use a range as it gives me the control over start and stop value and stepwidth.\n\nI try to avoid to name that variable which is just used for plotting \"x\" as I usually want x to be a \"free\" variable without any value. Thats the reason for naming it \"x.plot\". Often I name it just \"x.\" because when the focus is outside of the plot this variable looks like \"x\".\n\nBTW, your function h(x) plot quite fine without any vertical artefact if you use a simple quickplot. No need for any tricks\n\n@ptc-4127093 wrote:\n\nThank you very much for your help.\n\nYour \"trick\" works fine !\n\nI wish you a Happy New Year from Belgium.\n\nRichard\n\nYou are welcome!\n\nHappy New Year to you, too, from Austria!\n\nWerner"
