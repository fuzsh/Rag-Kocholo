        "text": "2 Philadelphia Pizzerias Named Among The Best In The U.S.\n\nBoth the New York Times and the Italian publication 50 Top Pizza have recently published their distinguished “best pizza in America” lists. Philadelphia had one restaurant named on each of them.\n\n“The American pizza movement is in great ferment, with a new generation of artisans increasingly focused on product quality and ingredients, which has gained strong momentum in the past year, including the introduction of tasting menus by many pizzerias.” stated the guide’s 50 Top Pizza’s curators Barbara Guerra, Luciano Pignataro, and Albert Sapere via a press release.\n\nThe New York Times seems to agree with this sentiment, saying, “Pizza in America has never been better.”\n\nAs someone who frequently reviews (and eats) pizza, I too feel like the pizza game has around the country has hit new heights. With that does come challenges. For example, sometimes to find these stellar pies, you have to navigate through some sub-par variations. However, in addition to features that details these unique pizza shops we also have the likes of Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports who have become huge personalities behind the world of pizza, producing reviews and creating apps like One Bite that help guide people where to find the highest scoring slice.\n\nWhat you have to appreciate about both of these “best of” lists is that they feature almost every style of pizza you can think of. Sure, the traditional cheese slice may be considered the classic, but Neapolitan, deep dish, and artisan pizza have become just as common.\n\nThese Philadelphia Spots Made The Best Pizza In America Lists\n\nStarting with the New York Times, they featured 22 establishments across the country you need to know about. San Lucas Pizzeria located at 2000 S Bouvier Street. has been open since 2005. The pizza choices top their menu with 18 different options. We’re talking everything from shrimp pizza to Hawaiian to traditional pepperoni.\n\n50 Top Pizza highlighted Pizzeria Vetri, naming it the third best spot in the country. In fact, they also gave Pizzeria Beddia on North Lee Street an honorable mention as the “new entry of the year.”\n\nAs for Pizzeria Vetri their style is more Neapolitan. They now have four restaurant locations in and around the great city area. They offer 10 different pizzas on the menu and in two different sizes. A “metro” style is 28 inches and feeds up to four people. Your choices include Margherita or marinara pizzas topped with items such as mushrooms, fennel sausage, or truffle asparagus.\n\nJeff Gorra is a Boston-based writer who has been with Beasley Media Group since the beginning of 2023.
