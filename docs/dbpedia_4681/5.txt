Politics was not yet another vocation but "holy public service," Vijay said in a statement.

The announcement prompted spontaneous celebrations from his fans, even as speculations were rife for some time about the actor taking the political plunge in a state known for stars graduating from cinema to politics, including the late veterans M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa.

Vijay said his party will not contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, nor would it support anyone, as decided in its recently held General Council and Executive Council meetings.

"I have decided to complete the film I have already committed to, without affecting the party work and completely involve myself in the politics of public service," he said.

Meanwhile, Vijay's entry into the political milieu of the southern state is closely watched by many regional parties.

Kamal Hassan's Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), Vijayakanth's Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and Tamil Maanila Congress are likely to join Vijay's political front to form a united alliance against DMK and AIADMK.
