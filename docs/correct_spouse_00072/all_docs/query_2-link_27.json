        "text": "\"I think I married the right person. I think some of that's just like luck, or maybe karma. Maybe I did something right in this lifetime because I was a disaster in my 20s,\" the 43-year-old exclusively tells OK! while talking about her partnership with Egglife Foods, the innovative food company that uses cage-free eggs instead of flour to redefine carb-heavy foods.\n\nShe continues, \"We just complement each other. We've been in couples therapy since we met — all three of us, collectively: me, my therapist, and Jason. We're all about doing the work. I'm not afraid to pivot and take notes and change, and he's an actor, so he likes to have notes. He likes to hear feedback.\"\n\nWhen the couple, who share sons Sid and Lazlo, is hitting a rough patch, the blonde beauty will \"text our couples therapist and be like, 'We really need to meet.' And then we'll have a session, and we'll both be pissed off, but by the end of it, we're like onto the next.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the duo love to take their kids on the road with them. \"We love traveling. I think that we are obsessed with travel and experiencing new things and trying new foods and seeing different parts of the world. I think that that really is something for us as a family that that bonds us year after year,\" she gushes.\n\nAs for if Mollen's sons will venture into the entertainment biz, she quips, \"They're very artsy. I throw a ball at them, and they get hit in the face.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the comedian teamed up with Egglife Foods, as she is very passionate about eating healthy. \"It makes so much sense because I'm such a believer in like cutting sugar wherever you can, especially when you're feeding kids who are eating sugar at every turn,\" she shares. \"With Egglife, I have this egg white wrap there and it's five grams of protein in each one. It's simple. I hate when I look at ingredients on the package, and it goes on for miles. I like having one to two ingredients on the back of a package.\""
