        "text": "Coronation Street’s Jenny Platt left us all stunned after dropping a reminder she married another star of the cobbles.\n\nJenny is best known for playing the role of Violet Wilson in the ITV soap, who is Dylan Wilson’s (Liam McCheyne) mum.\n\nShe recently made a return to Weatherfield after getting word of Dylan’s involvement in a gang of bullies.\n\nWhen she eventually arrived, Violet fumed at Dylan’s dad Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) for his lousy parenting and placed the blame on him – ordering Dylan back to London to live with her.\n\nShe eventually went back on her word, and he was allowed to stay – as long as Sean made an improvement on his care for their son.\n\nFamily was the subject of a recent Instagram post shared by Jenny, as the actress shared a picture of her husband Rupert Hill from when he was younger, who also happened to be Jamie Baldwin in the show!\n\nThe picture was of Jamie from an episode of Classic Coronation Street, which airs as part of ITV3’s weekday afternoon schedule.\n\nCaptioning the post, Jenny wrote: ‘Well well well, look who’s popped up on classic corrie! What a reprobate that Jamie Baldwin was eh? (Reader, I married him).’\n\nRupert played Jamie from 2004-2008. On his departure from Weatherfield, he left with Violet and a young Dylan to start a new life in Clapham, London.\n\nHowever, in 2011, the couple’s relationship ended.\n\nSpeaking of her recent return, Jenny admitted that she was ‘very, very scared’ to step back into Violet’s shoes: ‘It was such a massive part of my life and one that I absolutely adored and genuinely loved every minute of being there’.\n\n‘Even though it’s a different building, it’s still got the exact same kind of family vibe that it always had’ she added.\n\n‘I’ve never felt like “oh yeah, that’s it, I want to put that character to bed”, I’ve always found Violet really lovely to play, she’s got heart and she’s warm but she’s made a lot of mistakes so I always feel like she’s one of us.’\n\n‘And of course, I’d love to see what she could get up to if Dylan was getting into more trouble.’\n\nIf you’ve got a soap or TV story, video or pictures get in touch by emailing us soaps@metro.co.uk – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nJoin the community by leaving a comment below and stay updated on all things soaps on our homepage.\n\nMORE : Coronation Street legend wracked with guilt as two characters leave the Street"
