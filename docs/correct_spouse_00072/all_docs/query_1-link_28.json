The National Trial Lawyers Association selected Jenney as one of the “Top 40 Under 40” lawyers in Tennessee in 2014, 2015, and 2016. She was also selected as one of Nashville’s Top 30 Under 30 young professionals in 2012.\n\nJenney is a proud Fellow of the Nashville Bar Foundation and a member of the 2018 Tennessee Bar Association Leadership Law class.
