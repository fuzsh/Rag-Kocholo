Working as a professional makeup artist in Los Angeles first, she moved to South Carolina after the birth of her first child in 2006.

She absolutely adored making them feel like the best version of themselves for their wedding but also like the superstar they should feel like on their big day! Her favorite quote and personal motto is a quote by Marilyn Monroe, “Everyone is a star and deserves the right to twinkle”. Through working with venues and vendors she loved, she quickly found that she couldn’t be everywhere at once, and began to build a team of fabulous artists that had the same passion as she did.

That decision proved to be a life-changing event, leading Donna to retire from education to pursue her Humanist Celebrant business full-time. Donna has since officiated hundreds of ceremonies and built a full-time Celebrant business, Lehigh Valley Celebrants. Under her leadership, the business has grown to include six other working, Humanist Celebrants.

Everything about them makes my heart flutter with excitement. My journey began in 2010 when a friend of mine asked me to serve as a Hostess for her wedding.

It was so much fun and I felt like part of the family. I was born in Miami, Florida and have lived in Virginia, Texas, North and South Carolina. Whew, that's a lot, but thankfully I've been blessed to reside in the good 'ole southern state of Georgia with my loving family.
