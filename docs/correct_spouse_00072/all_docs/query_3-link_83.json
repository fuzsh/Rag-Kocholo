        "text": "KEVIN McCloud has become a household name thanks to Channel 4's hit architectural show, Grand Designs.\n\nBut when he's not busy fronting several shows, he's a devoted husband to his wife Jenny Jones.\n\nWho is Jenny Jones?\n\nIt's no secret Kevin McCloud likes to keep his life private so there isn't a lot known about Jenny.\n\nHowever, according to Hello! it is believed the couple's relationship began in 2021.\n\nRumours first began after they were spotted together taking a stroll and visiting some shops in Somerset.\n\nWhen did Jenny Jones and Kevin McCloud get married?\n\nThe pair tied the knot in November 2022, after he split from his ex-wife Suzanna.\n\nThe two married in secret and the union was only confirmed when it was announced they were returning from their honeymoon.\n\nIt's believed the couple live in Frome, Somerset, where he previously lived with Suzanna.\n\nKevin grew up in a village in Bedfordshire.\n\nIt was here that his interest in architecture became the inspiration for his career.\n\nKevin and Suzanna were married for 23 years.\n\nThey met when Kevin was in his 30s and got married in 1996 - a few before Grand Designs aired.\n\nIt was reported Suzanna was left heartbroken after Kevin walked out of the family home.\n\nNews of their break-up hit headlines in 2019, but it came to light the couple had been separated two years prior to that.\n\nA pal of Suzanna told the Daily Mail of the previous split: \"Zani is absolutely devastated. She came home one day to find that Kevin had taken his things and left.\"\n\nThe pair had two children together Milo and Elsie.\n\nKevin also has two more children from another relationship, Hugo and Grace.\n\nHugo followed in Kevin's footsteps and is now an architect.\n\nWhat does Jenny Jones do for a living?\n\nIt is unclear what Jenny's profession is, however, it is believed she is a businesswoman.\n\nWhere she works or what sector she works in is unknown.\n\nHer TV host husband previously trained to be an opera singer in Italy before he studied at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAfter graduating he trained as a theatre designer, later setting up his own lighting design practice.\n\nHis first TV gig was in 1998, making a guest appearance presenting Home Front In The Garden on BBC 2.\n\nHe later began writing and hosting Channel 4's home improvement show Grand Designs.\n\nHe has also presented spin-off show Grand Designs: House Of The Year, as well as Rough Guide To The Future, and Kevin McCloud's Escape To The Wild.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with the Daily Mail, Kevin said: \"I don't think I'm a celebrity.\n\n\"If I welcomed people into my lovely home every week in the pages of a magazine, they'd soon see how incredibly dull it is. It's important to maintain a bit of mystique.\"\n\nHe added: \"The more of your private life you put into the public domain, the smaller your private life becomes.\""
