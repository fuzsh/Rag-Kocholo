        "text": "Jenny Lisk’s young husband started feeling dizzy and stopped making sense. The next thing she knew, she was a widowed parent, desperately wanting to know: how exactly do you raise grieving kids, anyway?\n\nA heartbreaking doctor’s visit. A fate she never saw coming. She’d dig deep for the strength she so desperately needed…\n\nSeattle, 2015. Jenny Lisk was happy with a perfectly normal, busy life. But after the usual bustling week, Friday night turned from downtime into mild alarm when her forty-three-year-old spouse shared that he’d been feeling dizzy. And after ten days of his condition steadily worsening, she still wasn’t prepared for the stunning news: He was terminally ill.\n\nReeling from his diagnosis of an inoperable brain tumor, Jenny suddenly became not only a wife, mother, and career woman, but also a cancer-patient caregiver and parent of grieving children. And her many fears and uncertainties swirled around one relentless question:\n\nDid she have what it takes to help her young family survive?\n\nThrough a vulnerable, honest account of preparing for the death of a loved one, Jenny shares tips and information about childhood grief, how to be there for mourning friends, and ways online communities provide essential support. And for those who feel lost and alone, or are grappling with any kind of loss, her deeply personal journey provides a universal beacon of hope.\n\nFuture Widow: Losing My Husband, Saving My Family, and Finding My Voice is a brave and raw narrative that doesn’t pull any punches on the realities of caregiving and bereavement.
