Keep up the good work.\"\n\nMurray and Carmen, Australia\n\n\"We just finished a 7 month 22,000+ mile scouting trip from Alaska to the bottom of Chile and I can't tell you how many times we referred to your site for help. From how to adjust your valves, to where to stay in the back country of Peru. Horizons Unlimited was a key player in our success. Motorcycle enthusiasts from around the world are in debt to your services.\"\n\nAlaska Riders\n\n\"Fanatastic usefulness aplenty!\"\n\nPhil Owen, Australia\n\n\"Your website is amazing. I dont know how we would've planned for this trip without it. Everyone from Colombia (Rob wrote to the HU Communities in Colombia) has been very warm and helpful. I only wish I would've thought to contact the Communities long ago. Thanks Again, Hope to ride with you one day\"\n\nRob Noble, Canada\n\n\"best web site I've ever seen for traveling, on or off a bike, keep it up, thank you.\"\n\nTony Brimble, UK\n\n\"Thanks again. Can honestly say that we would not have made it through DRC Angola without this site and the people we met through it. Keep it up.\"\n\nJames Thomas, UK\n\n\"fantastic site - 5 months ago I had no bike, no licence and no idea - and now in three weeks I set off to Cape Town. This site, especially the HUBB has proved invaluable.\"\n\nPaul Hurcomb, UK\n\n\"Many years ago I travelled much of Southern Africa, and Madagascar on my 500XLS Honda. But since becoming gainfully employed... it has been a long time since I have ridden any distance, plus I committed the unforgiveable sin of selling my 'bike. Now I'm re-looking at a long trip, and found your website not only highly informative, but also extremely inspiring in restoring the ethos of the human spirit. Thank you.\"\n\nMarco Turco, USA\n\n\"...reading and e-mailing with others on your site who have already done what I want to do and much more is quite inspirational!!\"\n\nSimon Dufton, UK\n\n\"folks asked me how I did it - ride around the world that is. I told them it can be done on one's own, but for more information HU was the place to go!\"\n\nDavid Petersen, Canada\n\n\"Hello guys; I've been reading your great web page these last few days and just wanted to say thanks and maybe offer my services. I've been riding bikes most my adult life (I'm 41) and have some experience with long trips (here in Greece and around Europe and Canada). I thought I'd check in with you first to see how I might help out. It's such a helpful site and I just feel that I'd like to somehow be a part of it. I'm planning a round the world tour right now for the spring and the information here has been simply priceless. Once again, thanks very much and let me know what I can do. Cheers!\"\n\nGeorge Cham, Greece\n\n\"Hi guys! I really love your site and work - its an indispensible info source for touring!\"\n\nDavid Katz, Germany\n\n\"It is really THE source for travel information.\"\n\nUlrike Teutriene\n\n\"A Travel Encyclopedia\"\n\nPaul, NatureSeeker.com\n\n\"Hi, I love the site and check it regularly. I am planning a big trip for next year.

I've also met some of your most frequent collaborators, Chris & Erin Ratay, and also Richard Hewitt/Canada. Although the bike-thing is in the family's blood (my brother-in-law has a Suzuki dealership and my sister runs a nice Moto Café at the shop's premises), I've never been a biker myself... However, there's a time for everything and I guess mine (for changing that!) is around the corner! Using your words, 'It is not the unknown, but the fear of it, that prevents us from doing what we want.' Meanwhile, let me tell you that reading this e-zine (as well as visiting the site) has brought more than nice moments into my life - and to lots of other people, I'm sure! Thanks a lot! Hope to meet you, some day, somewhere... Kisses from sunny Porto Alegre,\"\n\nHeloisa Fialho, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n\n\"I have long wondered how in the hell you guys have survived on goodwill and free air. The new idea of receiving some financial support is long overdue. What you do for the motorcycle adventure community is priceless. You are entitled to some income to support all that you do. My check will be in the mail this afternoon. I am, unfortunately, now too old for adventuring. At age 70 I simply ride on hard road trips and read your website. But Lord it was fun riding through Mexico with my daughter and all over Europe before bikes became so popular.\"\n\nJames Brosman, USA\n\n\"You've probably heard this before, but thanks for the superb site - it has made the planning task so much easier - especially the 'bits round the edges' -Russia to Japan, Carnets, etc.\"\n\nSimon McCarthy, UK, leaving soon for an around the world trip\n\n\"Hola amiga mia(?),Si quieres apprender algo del mundo de motoviajes, aqui hay mucho informacion.\"\n\nPorter Watson\n\nMy girlfriend and I are going to leave on a RTW trip in December or January.

Finding it was even more exciting than finding my new bike:-) (650 Dominator). Until yesterday, me and my friend thought we were the only ones in this world that had figured out the meaning of life.

Found the site because he's a friend of the Duvals (Ken and Carol), and says: \"Give them LOTS of money to go away again soon, the incredible stories are killing me.\"\n\n\"This site is phenomenal, i love it. My dad and I are interested in doing a cross or semi cross continent adventure in 2003 either in Latin America or Australia. We're fascinated by both and know little about either, we live in Africa. Doyou have any information on travlleing in these countries or any adventures done there? Thanks for a very wonderful site!\"\n\nBianca Salamon, Windhoek, Namibia\n\n\" Tremendous website with a mass of useful information and links.\"\n\nAndrew Pearce, Ascot, England\n\n\" ... looks very useful, helpful site, with much fun. I'll keep watching.\"\n\nCenk Barutcu, Istanbul, Turkey\n\n\"Your site is absolutely fantastic! I can't believe how fast people have replied to my questions. I've been floundering for months trying to put an overland trip together and in less than two weeks of viewing your site and posting questions I've accomplished more. Thank you so much.\n\nToday I was in a cyber cafe in Dharamsala India and, as usual, the server was painfully slow. I looked over my shoulder and saw someone with your site up on the screen. Turns out it was Cheryl and David (Laing) who are heading to Pakistan. We struck up a conversation and it looks like I might have found the travel companions I was looking for, timing seems to work for both of us.\n\nThanks so much for all your help. Love your site, looking forward to the day I can provide people with information when I have a little experience under my belt.\"\n\nCat Syrbe, USA, in India\n\n\"I have NO idea how you can keep working so much on your (free) site. It's a goldmine, and yet it's free, and yet it must take every single hour of every single day.

You both do a wonderful job of bringing so many people together.

It is superbly presented and I had no idea that there is so much info on it, you guys are really doing a superb job. Please, please keep it going at the high standard that you have maintained. I can imagine the pressure that you work under to meet your deadlines, preparing your copy and hoping that it will make interesting reading for us all.

Many's the time I've pulled the bike over on a backroad, sat by a river for a while, and imagined what it'd be like sitting by a similar river in a far off land...just the bike and me...living like a modern day 'nomad'. I thoroughly enjoy spending time at your site, reading the stories and in my own way planning my own RTW adventure.

It is not the same as being lonely, although there is often a desire, not always accomplished, to meet up with strangers who might be able to empathize at the end of a long day's haul. Grant and Susan Johnson's Horizons Unlimited site and accompanying newsletter were created for just that purpose, as a place where people can meet and greet other like-minded souls. An e-zine also provides extensive information on the Johnsons' more specific passion, that of international motorcycle trekking.\"\n\nNetSurfer Digest\n\n\"Just want you guys to know that this is the best site I have bookmarked!\"\n\nShaun Dubyts & Kristie Cote, Calgary, AB Canada\n\n\"...Just expressing thanxs for some convincing words during my planning of what turned out to be a fabulous trip through Iran, Syria and Jordan by bike.

I will definitely share your website with WOW members. At a rally several years ago in Seattle, I met a lady in her 70s who had just returned from the Soviet Union. She was telling us how she had to solve the problem of riding her Gold Wing plus trailer over their railroad tracks that stuck 5\" up over the road.

We probably use it differently from most in that we like to keep up with where everyone is on the road rather than for planning. Particularly people we have met along the road and wonder where are they now!!! On the size, sometimes it is a little too long to read at the exorbitant rates of some countries internet cafe's. But don't leave anything out we just have to read quicker... actually your site has reduced our emails considerably as most people we keep in touch with get E-zine and so keep up to where we are and don't need to contact us directly as much.

I remember receiving the first newsletter whilst on the road last year ...I think we had just arrived back in Islamabad after having diced with death on the icy stretches of the Karakoram Hwy. We met up with two fellow bikers there, one of whom had cracked 2 ribs, and the other a sprained ankle, whilst attempting the same thing. They were more than a little dispirited, but we consoled them with the newsletter ...'Look, there are other people out there doing the same mad things, driven by the same inexplicable compulsion.' I think we all felt a slightly warm and fuzzy feeling at the confirmation of the existence of this brother (and sister-) hood of RTW motorbikers, although we'd already had the proof along the way. It was also an exciting feeling to be there at the beginning of the internet wave, having been through several places that had just started up their first public internet place--in Tripoli, Aqaba, and others.\"\n\nSiobhan McInerny, Ireland\n\n\"Congratulations on a great site.

I have ridden in every state in the continental US except for Michigan and every Canadian Province except the Northwest Territory. Like you, I love to ride. Enough already... I just wanted to complment you on this FANTASTIC Website. Thanks... Take care, be well and ride safe...\"\n\nDavid\n\n\"I find it a really great and interesting site, and it seems to come in handy now when I'm about to plan my own trip.

Thanks!\"\n\nJustin Hamel, Massachusetts, USA\n\n\"Grant, Just found your website a couple of weeks ago, think it is absolutely fantastic. A combination of reading thru the site and watching the Dakar on the gogglebox has convinced me that it is time to sell the Magna 750 and buy a R80 GS. Thank you for setting me on the road to fulfilment...\"\n\nStephen\n\n\"Every month you send your very good e-zine to my e-mail address at work. When I receive the e-zine I stop working and start to read.... This gets the highest priority :). But in May we are leaving on our trip to Asia. Can you change the e-mail address, where to send the e-zine to, so we can read them during our trip. Thanks\"\n\nUdo Lamers\n\n\"...Your site is fantastic; the most interesting one I have ever seen.\"\n\nHenri Pearson, Canada\n\n\"I appreciate the time and effort on your part to provide your excellent e-zine...Thank you\"\n\nPhil Roddenberry, Live Oak, FL USA\n\n\"Thanks very much.

I bought the computer one year ago so I had a way to \"Talk Motorcycle\" when I wasn't riding or working on a motorcycle. Browsing this site is great entertainment, educational, and provides motivation to get out and ride, ride, ride. \"\n\nJim Corzette\n\n\"I've been reading your whole site for months and I find it the most informative / entertaining site on the net, figured I should subscribe.\"\n\nEd Gaffney, Windsor Ohio USA\n\n\"Thanks for everything, it is very exciting to be a part of Horizons Unlimited!\"\n\nJuan Carlos Ibarros, Mexico\n\n\"Thanks SO MUCH for adding the bikes being used on the trip reports where possible in the Traveller's E-zine!
