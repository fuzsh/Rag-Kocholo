        "text": "Who is Jenny Agutter married to?\n\nAgutter, 70, is married to Swedish hotelier Johan Tham after the pair met at an arts festival in Bath, Somerset in 1989.\n\nThey tied the knot a year later and welcomed their son Jonathan in December 1990. Her son is now a GP in London.\n\nThe actress and her husband are said to split their time between their home in south London and their house on The Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall.\n\nShe said being married was “lovely” and “very grounding”, admitting her marriage continued to flourish through the years.\n\nThe star continued: “I was thinking: ‘Maybe I will just remain single.’ And, more worryingly: ‘What does the future hold?’\n\n“Then all this came at once with Johan. It came as a shock but it was the best thing that happened.”\n\nAgutter went on to say: “As I reached my late 30s, before I met Johan, the gynaecologist told me: ‘You might find it difficult to become pregnant because of your age but I don’t see any problems.’”\n\nShe was 36 when she got married but said she didn’t have any problems conceiving her son.\n\nCall the Midwife airs on BBC One tonight at 8pm"
