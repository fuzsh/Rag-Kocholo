One of the guests was Brightman's School of Rock co-star Sierra Boggess, who shared a photo from the evening on Instagram.\n\nBrightman, who is also a writer, originated the role of Dewey in School of Rock on Broadway. He departed the show after a year and returned for a two-week stint in April 2017. His other Broadway credits include Matilda, Big Fish, Wicked, and Glory Days."
