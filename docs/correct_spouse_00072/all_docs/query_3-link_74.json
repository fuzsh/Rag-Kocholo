        "text": "Powered by RedCircle\n\nToday we are talking with my friend, Jenny Price, and an incredible, practical tool for couples to strengthen their marriage called Marriage on Mission. Jenny is a Pastor’s wife, mother of five, and coach who is passionate about building healthy marriages. The Marriage on Mission tool is one that will help you and your spouse dream, plan and sharpen your direction in a healthy way.\n\nIf you find this podcast helpful, you can subscribe and click here to find past topics and free resources. Feel free to share with others, as well! If you would like to help support Let’s Parent on Purpose, you can do so by becoming a patron.\n\nI send a weekly email called “Things for Thursday” and it includes things I’ve found helpful related to parenting, marriage, and sometimes just things I find funny! You can sign up for “Things for Thursday” by joining my newsletter on my homepage.\n\nSHOW HIGHLIGHTS\n\nNo matter what stage your marriage is in, if you can get your marriage on mission, you can push toward health.\n\nMarriage is the one thing that is definitively shaping our nation. It is not government or healthcare; it is growing healthy marriages.\n\nYou do not have to simply endure a hard marriage. Putting your marriage on mission will help it grow healthy and thrive.\n\nEverything stems from relationships. The fruit of your relationship with your spouse will have a long-lasting impact after you are gone.\n\nThe most important concept to remember concerning your marriage is that the ultimate mission is not to stay married or have a good marriage. If your marriage is the most important thing to you, it has become an idol. If marriage is the highest priority, you are depending on your spouse to satisfy things that only God can satisfy. There is no person to complete you, and if you are looking to your spouse to do that, you are setting them up for something they are incapable of doing. Your marriage should be a blessing and an absolute source of joy, but it is not your core identity and it is not the main source of joy in your life.\n\nMarriage should be combined with:\n\nMinistry\n\nCareers\n\nEternity\n\nSo, where should one start to get their marriage on mission? The following steps are part of the Marriage on Mission tool. I encourage you to print the full resource out as it contains additional details that will help you and your spouse get the most out of the exercise!\n\nAsk yourself where you are right now.\n\nYou can’t work on where you want to go without knowing where you are starting from.\n\nTalk to your spouse about where they are.\n\nSometimes, one spouse might feel they are in one place and the other has a totally different take on it. We all carry presumptions!\n\nIt should not scare us if one feels the relationship is in a better place than the other. Evaluating where you both are should not be an exercise in ascribing worth to the other.\n\nDo vision-casting exercises. This exercise takes about an hour and a half and is great for a date night:\n\nSpend 5 minutes praying and getting into context.\n\nSpend 20 minutes individually writing your 1 year vision. This resource provides a number of questions you can use for this step.\n\nRead what each other has written.\n\nPay attention to the similarities and differences you discover.\n\nSet S.M.A.R.T goals. These should stretch us and push us.\n\nSpecific\n\nMeasurable\n\nAttainable\n\nRisky\n\nTimely\n\nFocus on eternity.\n\nLong for God. He is the goal!\n\nThink: My marriage matters because of the legacy that God is building in me.\n\nIs my marriage pointing others to Christ?\n\nSet a mission statement rooted in scripture.\n\nFind a scripture passage that you want your family to be about and live by it.\n\nTWEET THIS\n\nEverything stems from relationships. Share on X Your marriage should be a blessing and an absolute source of joy, but it is not your core identity and it is not the main source of joy in your life.
