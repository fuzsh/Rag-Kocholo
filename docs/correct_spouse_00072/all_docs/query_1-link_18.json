        "text": "We all need a break at times. Have you ever taken a break from your phone? I did it! It was easier than I thought it would be. It was better than I thought it would be. I probably needed it more than I thought I did. I took a 9 DAY tech break! I put my phone away - in a closet - for 9 days. I recently switched companies, and I had a week off. The weekend before the week off and the weekend after gave me 9 days. I THOUGHT: “I better do this now before I get flooded with customer calls in the new role.” I’m glad I did. HOW I DID IT: 1. I set my out of office settings in email. 2. I changed my voicemail to say that I was away for 9 days. 3. I turned on “Do Not Disturb While Driving” on my iPhone. (I changed the automatic outbound message on that feature to say that I was away from texts until July 15 and would respond then). 4. I cleared my calendar for July 15 because I knew I’d be catching up on all messages that day - when I returned. 5. I told my immediate family that I wouldn’t have my phone for a week - and to call my wife if they needed me. TAKEAWAYS FROM MY TECH BREAK: 1. I survived! 2. Oddly enough, I did not miss my phone. 3. I was more peaceful that week. 4. I slept better. 5. I Googled less stuff. It’s amazing to me how often I look up meaningless trivia. I couldn’t do that, so I didn’t. 6. I switched from audio books to actual reading. That was nice. 7. I even drove a few places without my Maps feature. THE RETURN: I came back to around: 250 text messages 120 work emails (some from before I left) 400 personal emails (mostly junk) 15 missed calls (mostly telemarketers) 15 Webex Teams messages 1 Voicemail (thanks, Honorée Corder - 😀) NOW: I’m caught up! Back to “inbox zero” and nothing unprocessed. IT WAS WORTH IT! ————————————————————————- What about you? Have you done a tech break like this? How did it go?

The coolest thing happened that night. Our youngest son said that he saw a sign on the downtown Franklin Theater that night that said, “25 Years Later.” So, we drove by there before our celebration date night. That night, they happened to be replaying the movie “Notting Hill” with Julia Roberts & Hugh Grant. We didn’t stop for the movie, but we did stop to get this picture! We cropped out “Notting Hill” and kept the “25 Years Later” part! I could not be more thankful for my wife! Jenny has been by my side through every up and down and twist and turn in my career. She’s celebrated wins and stuck beside me through losses. When the going gets tough, she shines the brightest. Jenny isn’t on LinkedIn, but I’ll show this to her. Babe, THANK YOU for 25 years!!!!!"
