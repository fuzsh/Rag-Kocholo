        "text": "Jason Biggs is opening up about his past battles with alcohol, revealing he used to hide his addiction from his wife, Jenny Mollen.\n\nThe American Pie alum made a recent appearance on his wife’s podcast All the Fails, where he admitted that he continued to drink alcohol while attending counseling.\n\n“I’m going to therapy and ‘working on things,’ but meanwhile I’m leaving therapy, having just had a good session, and I’m going to the liquor store and buying a fifth of vodka, drinking it and then driving home,” Biggs recounted.\n\nMollen said she was shocked to learn that she never realized the extent of his alcohol addiction. “How did I not notice?” she asked.\n\n“I knew how to get wasted enough to where I took myself out of the life equation, took myself out of the present, didn’t have to connect in a way that made me feel things,” Biggs explained. “I had it figured out to a T but not get too drunk where I couldn’t have a conversation with you.”\n\nHe added, “I was replacing those bottles in the bar all the time, all the time.”\n\nThe Orange Is the New Black actor has previously been open about his struggles with alcohol and drug addiction, celebrating his one year of sobriety on Instagram in October 2018.\n\n“I first tried to get sober over 5 years ago, when the weight of my obsession with booze and drugs became too heavy for me to handle. Turns out this shit is hard,” Biggs wrote at the time. “After some fits and starts, I’ve managed to put together one year of sobriety. I’m as proud of it as anything in my life.”\n\nHe continued, “If you’re struggling, know there’s help. Don’t be ashamed. We can do this.”\n\nBiggs and Mollen — who share two sons — have been married since 2008 after meeting while filming My Best Friend’s Girl."
