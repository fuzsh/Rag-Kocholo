        "text": "Mom, teacher, Navy veteran, military spouse - I’ve worn many hats in my lifetime. I’m grateful for those experiences because I’m able to see through the lens of both a teacher and a parent. My educational philosophy is to teach and to treat your children in the same manner I would like for my own children to be treated and taught. I taught 8th grade English in Fairfax County, Virginia, for the last 12 years. I served as department chair and taught a variety of levels. Serving ten years in the Navy helped me to develop strong leadership skills and to understand the importance of teamwork and collaboration. I impart those same skills to my students, inspiring them to achieve not only academic success but also to develop social and emotional skills that will guide them throughout their lives. Students feel valued and empowered to grow in the environment we create together, leaving my classroom as problem solvers ready to positively impact the world.\n\nMy husband recently retired from the Navy, and we decided to follow our children to the great state of Alabama! Our daughter, Kayla, graduated from UAB and is attending the McWhorter School of Pharmacy at Samford. Our son, Logan, is a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. We have two rescue pups, a yellow lab named Mabel, and a catahoula mix named Blue. I enjoy cooking, hiking, biking, and reading. I am thrilled to be a Liberty Lion, and I am grateful for the opportunity to work with your students. It’s going to be a spectacular year!"
