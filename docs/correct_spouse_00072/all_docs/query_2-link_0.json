        "text": "This is my attempt to analyse Colleen Hoover’s novel, Regretting You. That is CoHo’s first book that I read and fallen in love quickly. For starter, I only provide the character analysis of Clara and Morgan.\n\nThere are 2 main characters in this novel, Morgan and Clara. Morgan is the main protagonist of the story. Her character is dynamic because she changes throughout the story. Clara, her daughter, is also a dynamic character. She is another main protagonist in the story.\n\nMorgan had Clara when she was 17 years old. Her pregnancy was an accident that she made with her boyfriend, Chris. She married Chris later and they both raise the child responsibly. Morgan’s character in the story is written when she is already 34 years old, with some flashbacks when she was a teenager. She was a quiet teenager. It stays the same until she reaches her 30s. She often keeps her mouth shut when she thinks about something. Becoming a mother at such a young age also makes her lose her passion. She does not know what her passion is aside from being a mother who takes care of her daughter and her husband. Additionally, being a mother at 17 years old forces her to mature faster than most of her friends. She went to college for 2 years because she had to take care of her daughter, do the part-time work, and do her responsibility as a college student. She always considers herself boring. She has her routine that stays the same every day, which is watching cable that shows the same show every night, she goes to bed at the same time every night, she wakes up at the same time every morning, and she goes to the gym to do the same workout routine and run the same errands and cook the same scheduled meals (page 50). Even Clara says that she is predictable, ““I’m serious. What one word would you use to describe my personality?” Clara tilts her head and stares at me for several long seconds. Then, in a very honest and serious tone, she says, “Predictable.”” (page 53–54). She has not lived for herself ever since she got pregnant, she hopes to figure herself out before she starts to live for everyone else (page 146).\n\nShe felt disappointed when she knew that Clara shared her story with Jenny. “I like the setup, although I’d much rather Clara just ask me. But I get it. I’m her mom. Jenny is the cool aunt.” (page 38) as said by Morgan. She understands that her daughter needs advice from someone older — who is not her parents — like Jenny. But, Jenny sometimes does not know how to give the advice and Jenny calls Morgan to help her giving advice and later Jenny gives Clara the advice that Morgan told Jenny. In the end, whether Clara shares her story with Morgan or not, Morgan still knows the story because Jenny told her (page 38). Everyone around Morgan relies on her. Morgan and Jenny’s father died when they were little and she has been a mother figure to Jenny since she was a teenager, as a result of not having a mother that does not meddle in their lives (page 12). Morgan’s teenage pregnancy was also a result that comes from not having sheltered from her mother. Thus, Morgan becomes overprotective towards Clara’s love life since she does not want Clara to end up like her.\n\nHer routines change when Chris and Jenny (Morgan’s sister) die in a car crash (page 72). Not only does Morgan go through a grieving phase, but she also has to accept the truth that her sister and her husband were having an affair. She often caught in her own thoughts, wondering for how long the affair has been happening. Thinking about that only makes her cry every day. After their death, Clara and Morgan barely speak to each other. Morgan seems to refuse to talk about her problems. She keeps the affair between Chris and Jenny as a secret from her daughter. She finds some evidence about the affair but she decides not to face the truth. There was a part in the book where Morgan and Jonah go to the hotel where Chris’ car was parked (which happened before the accident) at a hotel parking lot. She finds a bag consisting of Jenny’s belongings and she does not want to see more of what is in the bag in case she will find another evidence or clue about the affair (page 89). She also finds envelopes hidden inside a toolbox in her house, addressed to Chris, with Jenny’s handwriting. At first, she decides to keep it hidden, afraid that Clara will be the one that finds it (page 167). At the end of the story, she does not read the letter or even takes a glimpse of what is inside the letter. She just ripped all the letters, leaving the reader’s curiosity without an answer (page 297). From Clara’s point of view, there is much not to like from Morgan. Morgan keeps things at herself that ruin her relationship with Clara.\n\nClara is smart, tough, and has the maturity to face the depressing phase of losing family members. She often acts uncontrollably which will make the reader dislike her. At the beginning of the story, she knows a boy named Miller. He becomes close to Clara. Morgan and Chris do not like her daughter being close with Miller, she thinks Miller brings bad influence to her daughter. At her father’s funeral, she ran away with Miller and she smoked weed. Morgan caught her in the act and punished her. Eventually, Clara feels tired of her mother for always making her grounded. She begins to disobey her mother and do things that will make Morgan mad. The lack of communication between Morgan and Clara causes bad blood.\n\nClara’s anger towards her mother makes her prefer to lie to her since it is easier than telling the truth (page 166). She is tired of adults assuming that she will not understand some of their problems (page 118). Other than that, she learns that being an adult does not mean that “You’re emotionally mature, so you can handle crises better.” “They just wear more-convincing masks.” (page 187).\n\nIn the end, Clara and Morgan reconcile. Morgan learns to accept Miller as Clara’s boyfriend. Morgan admits the truth to Clara about the affair between Chris and Jenny. Clara was devastated when she heard the truth. The fact that the 2 people that she loved the most turns out to be disappointing. She blamed herself for their death, she texted Jenny during the accident. Turns out, it was Chris who drove the car, not Jenny. She feels guilty as she learns the truth because she has been hating and blaming her mother for not being devoted to her marriage with Chris.\n\nReading this book from 2 points of view gives the reader more story and perspectives. It is not only a mother-daughter relationship but also a story that tells about grieving. Facing the truth, growing up, and learning from the past. Reading this book is like putting yourself in someone’s shoes. Readers are expected not to hate Morgan or Clara. That is why Colleen Hoover wrote this story using the first-person point of view of the mother and daughter. It is focusing on their lives too. The readers get to know Clara’s school life and her friends. From Morgan point of view, we get to know the truth and her perspective about being a mother at a young age. Feeling her struggle to raise her daughter and not wanting her to follow her path and knowing parents’ fear of not being a good parent to her child. With its chapter that is written from a different point of view makes the readers understand their stories from different perspectives and not taking sides from each of the characters.\n\nClara is like most teenagers. However, one thing that differs her from most teenagers is the grieve she suffers from losing her relatives. Sometimes she feels like the world revolves around her while in fact, it does not. She often disobeys her mother as if Morgan does not deal with the loss too. One thing that I do not like about her character is the way that she treats her mother and Miller (her significant other in the story). She is an egoist and acts arbitrarily. Sometimes she annoys me for the reason that she acts impulsively. Despite her poor behaviour, people around her still want to be with her.\n\nThe conflict between the mother and daughter is caused by their personality. Both of them have a strong character and sometimes they do not listen to each other. But in the end, Clara’s character develops and their relationship gets better.\n\nTo conclude, the chemistry between the characters is warm and loving. The character development is relieving. The conversation of each character in the story is well written and not seem forced or cheesy. Though, there are some things that I do not like personally from the book. Morgan’s character is too selfless. She is rather to be hated by her daughter rather than telling the truth. Meanwhile, sometimes Clara’s decision while taking action is outrageous. Morgan and Clara have strong personalities. They are both smart, stubborn, and loving. In fact, Clara is a lot like Morgan when she was at that age (202). Also, the story in the book is fast-paced. Therefore, it does not bore me. Though there are some conflicts that I think are too lengthy and it could make the reader impatient and want to finish the book as soon as possible.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this book despite its flaws. The plot, drama, and twist of this book are entertaining and amusing. There are only 366 pages in this book and it is a light-read for someone who avoids complicated and thick books."
