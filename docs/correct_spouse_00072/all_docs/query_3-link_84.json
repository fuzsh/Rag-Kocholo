Kildare on Friday.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in the beautiful four star Killashee Hotel just outside of Naas.\n\nREAD MORE:Virgin Media star Martin King breaks silence on wife Jenny's brain tumour news\n\nThe groom looked dapper in a navy suit and white tie, while the bride was simple stunning in a white dress with a lace-up back and traditional veil.\n\nJenny also looked incredible for the celebration as she chose a baby blue floral gown, which was paired with a headpiece, created especially for her by designer Aimee Farrell to match the colours in the dress.\n\nThe mum of the groom, who is a wedding photographer, took the day off work as snapper Elaine Louise captured the day with help from Amy, who works with Jenny.\n\nShe took to Instagram to share a video from the big day, which was created by videographers bigday.ie.\n\n\"Our son got married yesterday to the love of his life, Alison,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Our hearts are just filled with love today. But when the incredibly talented Richard from @bigday.ie sent this video to us this morning, we cried all over again.\n\n\"Their adorable little boy Aaron carried his new baby sister Mia up the aisle, and read a beautiful poem and there wasn’t a dry eye in the room. What an incredible day, our first child getting married. Memories captured forever.\"\n\nIn the video, Dean and Alison's son Aaron can be heard reciting a poem for his parents as they tied the knot.\n\n\"Keep our houses filled with laughter, let's have fun forever after,\" he reads.\n\nJenny and Martin were joined by their other children James, Victoria, Matthew and Alex as they toasted the newlyweds.\n\nJenny told RSVP Magazine: \"My son Dean got married on June 24 in Killashee Hotel in Kildare. There was a lot of planning in advance and any problems that arose I was able to fix them because I know everything there is to know about weddings.\"\n\nShe added: \"I practically organised it. They booked Killashee and picked their menu, but I have done pretty much everything else [laughs].\n\n\"I was able to tell them who to get for their flowers and hair and make up. We had a great day.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:"
