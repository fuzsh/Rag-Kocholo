        "text": "By\n\nGH fans now know that Steve Burton is back taping all-new episode of General Hospital, and as has been revealed, the character of Jason Morgan will be back on your screens starting with the March 4th episode of the ABC daytime drama series.\n\nWhen we last saw Jason he was buried under rubble in a cave that collapsed. But, where has he been since then? And when he makes his way back to Port Charles, who would you like to see him romantically involved with?\n\nThere had been speculation that he could reignite his relationship with Carly (Laura Wright), who before Sonny (Maurice Benard) arrived back from Nixon Falls, the two were married, or, the besties could just go back to being just that.\n\nCarly has been in a relationship with Drew Cain (Cameron Mathison), but could it be the series will play up that Carly is now torn between the two brothers?\n\nElsewhere, there is Sam (Kelly Monaco), who was a great love of Jason’s life. However, now she is with Dante (Dominic Zamprogna), and it has left fans wondering will Lulu eventually coming out of her coma be the trigger that causes a dilemma in their relationship, or could it be Jason’s return and old feelings re-emerging that might spell trouble for them, especially given that Jason is Danny’s father?\n\nThen, there is Elizabeth (Rebecca Herbst) who shares a deep-rooted past with Jason and the two share a son, Jake. Could it be possible that Liz and Finn’s (Michael Easton) second attempt at a relationship will go bust, thanks to a Jason return? Finally, if not Carly, Sam or Liz, who on the canvas could you see Jason with?\n\nNow weigh-in, who do you think Jason should be with romantically when he finally returns alive and well to Port Charles? Comment below.\n\nUp Next\n\nUsher Headlines Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show; Remember When He Was on The Bold and the Beautiful?\n\nDon't Miss\n\nJordi Vilasuso’s Baby Girl Lucy is Home From the Hospital Following Health Crisis\n\nYou may like\n\nGENERAL HOSPITAL: With Lucky on the Way, Will Lulu Wake Up Out of Her Coma So Laura Can Be Reunited With Her Children?\n\nGENERAL HOSPITAL: Should Anna Let Cates Take Valentin Away For His Crimes and Free Jason?\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nGENERAL HOSPITAL: With Lucky on the Way, Will Lulu Wake Up Out of Her Coma So Laura Can Be Reunited With Her Children?\n\nBy\n\nFriday’s July 19th episode of General Hospital had Laura (Genie Francis) visiting her daughter Lulu who is still laying in a coma. Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) also happened to stop by to see his beloved ex-wife at the same time.\n\nThe scenes brought with it more questions for the ABC daytime drama series. Are they setting up the moment many have been waiting for? Will Lulu wake up out of her coma and be reunited with her mother, her returning to Port Charles brother, Lucky Spencer (Jonathan Jackson), and finally be able to tell Dante her true feelings for him, which, in turn. would cause drama in Sam (Kelly Monaco) and Dante’s relationship?\n\nThe flip side would be if these scenes were just meant as a way for GH to remind viewers that in story they know Lulu is still lingering in a coma and not forgotten. If Lulu were to awaken, it could also bring Charlotte (Scarlett Fernandez) back to Port Charles with a parent, if her father, Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart) is truly written-off the canvas.\n\nIf you recall, it was back in November of 2020 that Lulu suffered a traumatic brain injury after a bomb explosion went off and killed her beau, Dustin (Mark Lawson). At the time of the explosion, Dustin was actually about to pop the question over dinner at the Floating Rib when the bomb went off! Lulu seemed okay, but collapsed as she was trying to confess her true feeling for Dante.\n\nIn the present day, Laura sits with Lulu and tells her about Charlotte and Rocco (Finn Carr). Laura says that Lulu’s children are growing up fast, and she’d be proud of who they have become. Laura gets an emotional and says she really misses her daughter a lot and could really use her as a sounding board. As Laura laments how much she needs her thoughtful, sweet, perceptive daughter more than ever, Dante shows up.\n\nLaura and Dante talk about how it is for Kevin (Jon Lindstrom) and Laura to raise Ace, and how it would be so meaningful to Laura, if one day Lulu would be able to wake up and meet her little nephew. Next, Dante takes Lulu’s hand and says he prays daily for her to wake up. The two reminisce over things Laura would say or do with Lulu when she was growing up proving that she was the best mother.\n\nDante shares that he was going to bring Rocco to visit Lulu today, but he had plans to see a baseball game. Laura asks how often Rocco visits. Dante says that it is getting harder and harder for Rocco to visit his mom. He tells Laura he is worried Rocco coming to see Lulu might be doing more harm than good. Offering up her sage advice, Laura suggests that since Rocco is at an age where he knows what feels right, Dante should leave that decision up to Rocco.\n\nSo, what are your thoughts GH fans? Will GH finally wake up Lulu? If so, who do you think will play the part? If they don’t wake up Lulu, what do you think was the point of the touching scenes between Laura and Dante? Share your theories via the comment section below.\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nGH’s Tabyana Ali Opens Up on Trina’s Grief Since Spencer’s Presumed Death, “They Were Rooted, They Were Soulmates”\n\nBy\n\nComing up on the Friday, July 19th episode of General Hospital, Trina’s (Tabyana Ali) grief and survivor’s guilt over life without Spencer (formerly Nicholas Chavez) comes to the forefront and it’s going to be an emotional ride for Sprina fans.\n\nThe question also becomes, how soon is too soon for Trina to have a new relationship when she had such a magical connection to Spencer, and all that they had gone through and endured to finally be together.\n\nSpeaking with Soap Opera Digest, Ali shared her thoughts on Trina’s state of mind, where she is in the grieving process and how she feels about how quickly GH should rush her into a post-Spencer relationship.\n\nTabyana expressed, “I think the show should take its time with this.,” adding on Spencer and Trina’s love, “They were very rooted. They were soulmates. So you can’t rush something like that, you can’t just get over it quickly. This is something that builds and it takes time to get over, to visually see your soulmate die.”\n\nEven personally for herself, Ali shared, “I feel like I would need so many years to get over that. I wouldn’t even probably entertain the thought of being with anybody else for a minute. Especially because it’s not like, ‘Spencer was a bad guy, he did bad things to me and so it’s easy to move on from.’ No. They worked up to the relationship they had and as soon as she had him, she lost him, in the peak of their love. I feel like that would take a lot of time to get over.”\n\nIn story, Trina becomes emotionally triggered when Josslyn presents her with the turtle dove that had such deep meaning to her relationship with Spencer, that had fell during the young women’s recent apartment move. Ali says, “There is an immense amount of guilt behind that, where it’s like, ‘How can I even live day to day knowing that you sacrificed yourself, and now you don’t get to do all the things I get to do in my day to day life?’ She’s trying to move on, but there are all these little things that keep popping up that remind her of Spencer and it’s like a rock going through a glass window.”\n\nSo, do you want GH to take their time and not rush a new relationship for Trina? Do you think she will end up with Gio? Do you think the show might recast Spencer and he comes back alive with a new face?
