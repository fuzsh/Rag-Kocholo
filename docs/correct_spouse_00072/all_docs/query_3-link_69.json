        "text": "JENNY Apple had been updating her fans on her fight against an inoperable form of stage four lung cancer.\n\nThe influencer and YouTube star was married to Kyle, who appeared in her videos on the video-sharing platform.\n\nWho is Jenny Apple's husband, Kyle Appleford?\n\nJenny was married to Kyle Appleford, and they lived in California.\n\nJenny was first diagnosed with a form of inoperable stage three lung cancer in March 2021, but it has advanced to stage four, spreading to her brain and some of her lymph nodes.\n\nSadly, she shared her hopes for the future after she died.\n\nJenny said her husband was allowed to remarry and fall in love again.\n\nShe told fans: “I want him to be happy so let him be happy.\n\n“I’ll be an angel sparkling in the sky. I’ll be sparkling over you guys when you get a glimmer of light in your eyes, it's me saying ‘hi.’”\n\nDo Jenny and Kyle Appleford have any children?\n\nThe couple share two young children called Ellis and Winnie.\n\nIn July 2023, Jenny shared a YouTube video titled: “We told the kids I’m dying.”\n\nKyle said that their son Ellis was “clinging onto the hope that there could be a miracle.”\n\nHe defended his and his wife’s decision to inform their children, and said: “It takes a lot of courage to be honest with them because it’s a scary thing to say but this is the route and I’m glad we did it.”\n\nJenny revealed at the time that her daughter Winnie was “struggling” with the news.\n\nShe said: “We wanna get her some help because I can’t imagine how hard it is as a 4-year-old going through this … She seems to completely understand — it’s a bummer.”\n\nWhat has Kyle Appleford said about Jenny's death?\n\nOn October 29, Jenny gave her fans a heartbreaking update on her health by releasing a livestream titled \"I'm Dying.\"\n\nThe influencer, who was in the hospital, said: “I have bad news guys. I’m dying – like I’m actually dying right now.\n\n\"I’m so scared. I don’t know what to do.”\n\nThe influencer’s husband Kyle explained her breathing has labored, and said: \"She’s here and she can’t go home.\n\n\"We wanted to be at home if we ever got this news but we unfortunately can’t they think if we tried to transfer her home she might not make it.”\n\nKyle revealed that Jenny’s left lung is now mainly covered in tumor, and said that doctors feared Jenny’s family may only have “days” remaining.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 8, Kyle announced on his wife's YouTube page that Jenny passed away.\n\n\"Jenny became a beautiful angel on November 5, 2023, at exactly five o'clock,\" he said.\n\nHe revealed she was \"only in hospice for a week.\"\n\n\"She was ready to go,\" he said.\n\n\"Her poor body went through enough,\" he said.\n\n\"She used to say, 'When I'm gone and my heart is no longer beating, that cancer will not be able to survive,'\" he continued.\n\nHe said that their families have come together after her death and are helping him with laundry, cooking, and putting up Christmas decorations.\n\n\"I miss my wife,\" he said through tears."
