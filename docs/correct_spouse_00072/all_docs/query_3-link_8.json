        "text": "One of the most surprising moments on The Masked Singer was when Cluedle-Doo was revealed to be none other than Jenny McCarthy‚Äôs husband, Donnie Wahlberg, during Season 5. None of the panelists were able to guess the rooster‚Äôs identity, including McCarthy. As the show heads into its 11th season, fans may be wondering if Donnie Wahlberg and Jenny McCarthy are still married. Keep reading for all the details on their relationship.\n\nThe Masked Singer is Fox‚Äôs reality TV singing competition series, in which celebrities compete against each other in performances while wearing head-to-toe costumes and face masks to conceal their identities. Each week, a panel of judges guess the celebrities‚Äô identities based on their voices and clues provided before and after their performances. At the end of every episode, the judges and the live studio audience vote on their favorite contestant. The singer with the least amount of votes is eliminated and must then take off their mask to reveal their identity. The last singer to be unveiled is determined the winner.\n\nThe series premiered in 2019 and is based off of the South Korean show King of the Mask Singer, which follows a similar format. Since its U.S. debut, The Masked Singer has since expanded to several different countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.\n\nAlong with Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong, McCarthy has served on the judging panel for all 11 seasons. Former Pussycat Dolls member Nicole Scherzinger was on the panel for seasons 1-10, but had to step away this season due to a scheduling conflict. She has been replaced by British singer Rita Ora, who is also a panelist on The Masked Singer UK.\n\nMcCarthy got the surprise of a lifetime when Cluedle-Doo (a rooster in a court jester outfit who served as a clue giver rather than a competing contestant) revealed himself to be her husband during the Season 5 semifinals. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two reasons why I‚Äôm here, honestly,‚Äù the New Kids on the Block founder said after the big reveal. ‚ÄúOne, obviously to see my wife, and two, you know, it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve performed for my fans.‚Äù\n\nIn a March 2024 interview with TV Insider, McCarthy joked: ‚ÄúThat will go on in the history as the biggest dumb blonde moment maybe I‚Äôve had of not being able to recognize him.‚Äù Read on to see if Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg are still together, plus more details on their relationship.\n\nAre Donnie Wahlberg and Jenny McCarthy still Married?\n\nAre Donnie Wahlberg and Jenny McCarthy still Married? The answer is yes! The power couple, who got married in August 2014 after one year together, are still going strong nearly a decade later. Wahlberg and McCarthy celebrated their nine-year wedding anniversary this past August, sharing sweet tributes to one another on Instagram. ‚ÄúHappy Anniversary, Jenny! So hard to believe it‚Äôs been 9 years already ‚Äî the ride is so sweet! I love you more than I could ever describe. Thank you for taking care of my heart. I promise to keep taking care of yours. We‚Äôre on to forever baby! Happy Anniversary! üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏èüí´,‚Äù Wahlberg captioned a montage of photos and videos of themselves.\n\nFor her part, McCarthy shared a photo from their wedding day, captioned in part: ‚ÄúAs I reflect on our journey, I feel honored, grateful and blessed that I get to live inside the greatest love story ever lived. I‚Äôm grateful for your kindness that touches every soul you meet, and the love that has become the very heartbeat of my existence.‚Äù\n\nThe pair frequently share photos and videos of themselves on social media and are very open about their love for one another. They also renew their vows each year. ‚ÄúIt keeps it fresh,‚Äù McCarthy said of their vow renewal tradition while appearing on Watch What Happens Live in September 2023. ‚ÄúAnd to do vows in front of your pastor, it just cements it even more.‚Äù\n\nDespite their busy careers (Wahlberg has starred on Blue Bloods since Season 1), the couple still make their marriage work. They live away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood in St. Charles, Illinois, with their blended family ‚Äî made up of McCarthy‚Äôs son Evan, whom she shares with ex-husband John Asher, and Wahlberg‚Äôs sons, Xavier Alexander and Elijah Hendrix, whom he shares with ex-wife Kimberly Fey.\n\nSince Wahlberg made a surprise appearance on her show, fans are holding out hope that McCarthy will make a cameo on Blue Bloods‚Äò final season ‚Äî and it could actually be in the cards. ‚Äú[Wahlberg] did make a comment the other day and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôd love to have you come on before I leave.‚Äô And I go, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs really sweet. I love you,‚Äô‚Äù she told TV Insider, adding: ‚ÄúAnd if there‚Äôs an opportunity that presents itself, possibly.‚Äù However, the television personality noted that the long-running procedural ‚Äúdeserves to have a beautiful ending on its own without me getting involved.‚Äù"
