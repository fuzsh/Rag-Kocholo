She was featured in the pilot episode, \"Days Gone Bye\" and was played by actress Keisha Tillis.\n\nBiography[]\n\nJenny Jones was the wife of Morgan Jones and the mother of Duane Jones. She lived in Georgia and was one of the earliest to fall victim to the zombie outbreak that swept across the country. Like many \"walkers\", Jenny had an instinctual connection to things that seemed familiar to her. She accompanied a horde of zombies that meandered about a house where her husband and son had taken refuge in. At one point, she even tried opening the front door, but it was locked.\n\nMorgan could not bear to see his wife wandering about as an undead creature and the effect it had on their son was even worse. Tearfully, Morgan did what needed to be done however. Taking up a high-powered rifle, he tried to put Jenny's soul to rest, but was unable to bring himself to do it.\n\nSometime later, Morgan encountered Jenny again, but was powerless to stop her from attacking Duane and turning him into a walker. This time, Morgan had little choice but to finish her off.\n\nNotes & Trivia[]\n\nThe character of Jenny Jones was created by writer Robert Kirkman and director/producer Frank Darabont.\n\nIn the closing credits of \"Days Gone Bye\", the character is identified only as Morgan's wife.\n\nSee also[]\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nThe Walking Dead images\n\nThe Walking Dead episodes\n\nThe Walking Dead characters\n\nThe Walking Dead cast & crew\n\nThe Walking Dead miscellaneous\n\n[]"
