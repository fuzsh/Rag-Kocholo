        "text": "Adapted by Max Wilk from his own novel, Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River, is a mildly diverting production, filmed at Britain’s Shepperton Studios, and starring Jerry Lewis as a perennial dreamer. An initial lack of clarity in plot premise, followed by routine and not very exciting episodic treatment add up to a generally flat result.\n\nWeaknesses are apparent at the very beginning: a series of disparate locations, after which it finally is established that Lewis is an eternal dreamer.\n\nSubsequent to this revelation, story plods along in a dramatic monotone, progressing, but never building, towards an inevitable happy ending, after 99 slow minutes.\n\nFeatured players Terry-Thomas as the typical promoter; Bernard Cribbins as a garage mechanic who doubles as a steward on unscheduled airlines; and Patricia Routledge, a man-hungry Girl Scout leader, are quite excellent in their appearances.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nLewis comes across as uncertain of whether he is supposed to ham it up at times, play it down at others."
