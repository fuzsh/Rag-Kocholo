        "text": "December 2\n\nWONDERWALL MUSIC (lp sound-track for the movie \"Wonderwall\") is released by George Harrison (Apple)\n\nGeorge Harrison: \"Joe Massot, the director, asked me would I do the music for his film...I decided to do it as a mini-anthology of Indian music because I wanted to help turn the public on to Indian music.\"\n\nDecember 17\n\nCANDY (movie) featuring Ringo Starr is premiered in New York\n\nDecember 20\n\n\"BEATLES 1968 CHRISTMAS RECORD\" is issued to fan club members\n\n**1969**\n\nJanuary 1\n\nBeatles begin filming LET IT BE\n\nJanuary 10\n\nGeorge Harrison walks out on the band while working on \"Let It Be\"\n\nWhile it remains true in the film that Paul McCartney seemed to have gotten to George Harrison over a dispute in how to play chords on a number (\"I'll play what you want me to play. Whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it,\" said Harrison) the real reason why George left (according to an October 2000 edition of Mojo magazine) was because of \"John's obsession with Yoko deeply insulted Harrison. Lennon repeatedly refused to participate in group planning; on January 10, Harrison told Lennon he was leaving the band immediately.\" George would reconcile their differences a week later on the condition that they don't do a live concert abroad and to stop filming at the dreary Twickenham studios.\n\nJanuary 13\n\nYELLOW SUBMARINE (lp) is released (Apple Records)\n\nJanuary 18\n\nJohn Lennon announces to Disc and Music Echo that APPLE RECORDS is in financial chaos: \"Apple is losing money. If it caries on like this, we'll be broke in six months...\"\n\nJanuary 20\n\nBeatles resume filming the \"Let It Be\" sessions but this time at Apple Headquarters, 3 Savile Row in their studio basement.\n\nJanuary 30\n\nThe Beatles last \"live\" public appearance held on the roof of the Apple building at 3 Savile Row. (The rooftop performance was based on an idea two days earlier by engineer Glyn Johns.)\n\nExcerpt from Apple's Deluxe \"The Beatles Get Back\" book describes atmosphere on the roof: \"With the wind sweeping the roof and blowing through the Beatles' hair, it seemed as if the roof concert were occurring on ship deck, Paul stomping the wooden planks, middle aged men and women on an adjoining roof waiting for the boat to arrive, boys and girls on nearby buildings lying against the roof slopes and waving, the Beatles smiling and singing to each other in the wind: 'You can syndicate any boat you row.'\" The Beatles performance ran about 40 minutes before the police arrived to stop the noisy noon disturbance.\n\nFebruary 3\n\nAllen Klein appointed to look after the Beatles' affairs by John, George and Ringo. Paul McCartney rejects the appointment, preferring Lee Eastman, Linda Eastman's father.\n\nMarch 12\n\nBirth of the APPLE SCRUFFS. Female fans stalk 3 Savile Row, Abbey Road, Trident and Olympic recording studios and the Beatles homesteads waiting for an appearance of a Beatle. Recalls Apple Scruff Wendy: \"We only wanted to know them as people really, it was never a groupie kind of thing. We didn't know what sex was all about....I thought these are my Beatles and one day I'll be in the right place at the right time and it'll be wedding bells.\"\n\nGeorge & Pattie Harrison's home is raided and they are charged with possession of cannabis.\n\nPaul McCartney marries Linda Eastman at St. John's Wood Church in London. Reverend Noel Perry-Gore presides.\n\nMarch 20\n\nJohn & Yoko married in Gibraltar by Cecil Wheeler in the British Consulate building\n\nMarch 25 - 31\n\nJohn & Yoko hold \"Bed-in\" in room 902 at Amsterdam Hilton\n\nJohn Lennon: \"Our life is our art. That's what the bed-ins were. When we got married, we knew our honeymoon was going to be public anyway, so we decided to make a statement. We sat in bed and talked to reporters for seven days. It was hilarious.\"\n\nMarch 31\n\nGeorge & Pattie Harrison fined in court for possession of cannabis\n\nApril 1\n\nJohn & Yoko appear in \"a bag\" while in Vienna\n\nPlayboy (1980 interview): \"What about the reports of you making love in a bag?\"\n\nYoko Ono: \"We never made love in a bag. People probably imagined we were making love. It was just, all of us are in a bag, you know. The point was the outline of the bag, the movement of the bag: how much we see of a person. Inside there might be a lot going on. Or maybe nothing's going on.\" See Bagism.\n\nApril 3\n\nBilly Preston, brilliant keyboardist signs on with Apple\n\nGeorge Harrison would later produce his first two albums on Apple: \"That's The Way God Planned It\" and \"Encouraging Words\". Billy would be used on the LET IT BE and ABBEY ROAD albums. George Martin would later acknowledge that Billy's musical contribution to those albums would act as \"emollient\" to buffer the on-going friction between band members.\n\nGeorge Harrison: \"It's interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in because they don't really want anybody to know that they are so bitchy...and told him [Billy] to come into Savile Row which he did. Straight away it just became 100 percent improvement in the vibe in the room.\"\n\nBilly Preston (reflecting on how it all happened): \"I was with Ray Charles in London and George was in the audience and he recognized me and called me the next day and invited me over to see the guys. When I went over, they were in the studio, you know, recording and filming and they asked me to sit in with them. It was a thrill enough just being there and playing with them. And I really didn't know about the label credit until the record was out,\" said Billy. \"The record was a big surprise. I was at the Beatles' office, and John said, 'Look, Willy,' and he showed me the record. I looked, and it was great. Wow! It was really something to do that for me.\"\n\nApril 7\n\nGOODBYE / SPARROW (single) by Mary Hopkins is released (Apple Records)\n\nCredited as a Lennon-McCartney song, '\"Goodbye\" was written by Paul McCartney. \"Goodbye\" reached #13 in the United States; #3 in Canada's National Music Magazine RPM (compiled from record company, radio stations and record store reports) for June 9, 1969; and went #1 in Ireland and the Netherlands.\n\nMay 5\n\nGET BACK / DON'T LET ME DOWN - featuring Billy Preston, (single) is released (Apple Records).\n\nMay 24\n\nThe Beatles \"Get Back\" continues to topple the number one hit position as compiled by Ottawa radio station CFRA.\n\nMay 25\n\nJohn & Yoko arrive in Toronto and are temporarily detained by Canadian Immigration authorities for over two and a half hours because of Lennon's previous drug conviction.

While in Canada, the couples activities spans from May 25 to June 5 and are headlined in major newspapers, television media and radio.\n\nMay 26\n\nJohn & Yoko hold \"Bed-in\" at Hotel La Reine Elizabeth, room 1742, in Montreal\n\nELECTRONIC MUSIC (lp) is released by George Harrison (Zapple Records)\n\nUNFINISHED MUSIC NO. 2 - LIFE WITH THE LIONS (lp) is released by John & Yoko (Zapple Records)\n\nMay 29\n\nFrom New York City, Howard Smith of \"Village Voice\" interviews John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Bed-In Montreal.\n\nClick on this link to hear refreshingly candid remarks from the couple and Howard Smith that epitomized the peace movement.\n\nJune 1\n\nJohn & Yoko record \"Give Peace A Chance\" which would become John's first solo record but still credited as a \"Lennon/McCartney\" song.\n\nSee: Rabbi Feinberg joins Beatle in song.\n\nJune 3\n\nThe Lennons visit Ottawa\n\nJohn and Yoko travel by train from Montreal to Ottawa. The train ride takes about 2 hours, covering a distance of about 110 miles (178 km).\n\nAt about 5:30 p.m., John and Yoko convenes for a peace seminar at the Ottawa University Arts Building organized by Allan Rock, who today is now an Ambassador to the United Nations (previously he held several Canadian cabinet positions including Minister of Health, Minister of Justice and Minister of Industry.) A lively discussion on peace was held including panelist Prof. Colin Wells, vice-dean of the university of arts faculty along with Canadian actor Bruno Gerussi and Martin Loney, president of the Canadian Union of Students.\n\nSee details of their visit to Ottawa with 15 rare exclusive photographs,\n\nand follow in John's and Yoko's footsteps on a tour of Ottawa in 2001.\n\nJohn and Yoko's visit to the city would only last several hours.

They arrive the next morning at 6:30 a.m. at the Union Station in Toronto where the couple stayed at the Windsor Arms Hotel.\n\nJohn is seen here carrying Yoko's 5-year old daughter Kyoko.\n\nPhoto: Jim Huber Click the pic for story\n\nJune 4\n\nBALLAD OF JOHN & YOKO / OLD BROWN SHOE (single) is released (Apple Records)\n\nJune 5\n\nJohn and Yoko leaves Canada\n\nOn this date, John Lennon and Yoko Ono check out of the Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto to catch a 9 p.m. flight to London, via Frankfurt. \"We are very happy with the results of our visit and the Montreal bed-in,\" said John Lennon to reporter Ritichie Yorke for the Globe and Mail. \"You can't change things overnight, but I believe we've made a lot of people think about peace. We're going to keep plugging away.\"\n\nYesterday's activities saw the Lennons head down to Niagara Falls to do a \"film documentary footage on his visit to North America,\" wrote Yorke. Meanwhile, Allan Klein reported that The Ballad of John and Yoko had already sold 900,000 copies in the United States and was Number 10 on the English charts in one week.\n\nJune 28\n\nNZBC in New Zealand bans offending words in The Ballad of John and Yoko - censored version airs over the radio\n\nPirate Radio Hauraki plays the uncensored version much to the delight of New Zealand Beatle fans. There is more media coverage on this topic and an excellent video history of Radio Hauraki by clicking on this link:\n\nPirate Radio Hauraki rules the waves.\n\nJuly 1\n\nBeatles begin recording Abbey Road album\n\nJuly 7\n\nGIVE PEACE A CHANCE / REMEMBER LOVE (single) is released by the Plastic Ono Band (Apple Records)\n\nJohn Lennon: \"We all have Hitler in us, but we also have love and peace.

The band would now earn 58 cents per album up until 1972 and then it would jump to 72 cents after that. Part of the new EMI contractual agreement required the Beatles to release at least two albums per year until 1976. Prior to this re-negotiated agreement, the Beatles 1966 contract with EMI had them earning 39 cents per album and when the Beatles first signed up with EMI, they only made 6 cents per album.\n\nSeptember 13\n\nCONCERT: \"LIVE PEACE IN TORONTO\"\n\nJohn & Yoko's second visit to Canada. At the Varsity Stadium in Toronto, the couple perform live with Eric Clapton, Klaus Voorman, and Alan White. Together, at this performance, the band records an Apple album later released as \"The Plastic Ono Band -- Live Peace in Toronto 1969\"\n\nMal Evans, the Beatles roadie recalls the event in an interview with Beat Publications in 1969: \"It was the first show I had roadied for three years and I was really loving every minute of plugging the amps in and setting them up on stage, making sure that everything was right. Everyone wanted the show to go particularly well because Allan Klein, who had flown over, had organised for the whole of John's performance to be filmed. This was on top of it being video-taped by Dan Richter.\n\n\"Finally, at midnight, the compare, Kim Fowley, who is a well-known singer, producer and songwriter in his own right, went on stage to announce the Plastic Ono Band. He did a really great thing. He had all the lights in the stadium turned right down and then asked everyone to strike a match. It was a really unbelievable sight when thousands of little flickering lights suddenly shone all over the huge arena, \" said Evens.\n\n\"Then John, Yoko, Eric, Allan and Klaus were on stage, and lined up just like the old Beatles set-up. Bass on the left, lead guitar next, then John on the right with the drummer behind. Each guitarist had two big speakers, one on either side of the stage, and the sound was really fantastic right from the moment they began. But just before they launched into their first number, John said quickly into the mike \"We're just goin to do numbers we know, as we've never played together before\". That was all. Just a brief word to put everyone in the picture.\n\n\"The whole show was recorded for a special album...and you will hear all this on the LP. After that, the boys gave a ten minute Press conference.\"\n\nMal Evans noted in the interview to Beat Publications that after they left Varsity stadium, the band piled into four cars and drove two hours until they reached the estate of Mr. Eaton, a wealthy Canadian businessman whose son had picked the band up after the show. The next day, for fun they got into golf-carts exploring the huge landscape that surrounded the estate. Ritchie Yorke, pop reporter for Toronto's Globe and Mail later wrote that John and Yoko spent a total of 36 hours in Canada before flying back to England.\n\nSeptember 17\n\n\"Paul Is Dead Hoax\" starts up in America\n\nOriginating from Des Moines Iowa when Tim Harper, a college editor, writes an article for the schools \"Drake Times-Delphic\" entitled: \"Is Beatle Paul McCartney Dead?\" On October 12, WKNR-FM picks up on the story from a phone caller revealing \"hidden clues\" in Beatle songs. The Chicago Sun-Times later covers the story on October 21. Paul would later appear on the front cover of LIFE Magazine (November 7) with an interview by John Neary entitled \"The Case of the 'Missing Beatle': Paul is still with us.\"\n\nSeptember 20\n\nJohn Lennon announces to the others that he is leaving the band\n\nAuthor Barry Miles in his book \"The Beatles: A Diary\" explains that as Paul attempted to discuss Beatle matters, John Lennon kept saying \"No, no, no\" to everything Paul suggested. Paul asked John what he meant by \"no\". John replied: \"I mean the group is over. Im leaving. Allen was saying don't tell. He didn't want me to tell Paul even. So I said 'Its out.' I couldnt stop it, it came out. Paul and Allen both said that they were glad that I wasn't going to announce it, that I wasnt going to make an event out of it.\" Lennon's announcement never made it to the press because of their newly negotiated royalty contract they signed with EMI.\n\nOctober 1\n\nABBEY ROAD (lp) is released (Apple Records)\n\nThis is the Canadian release date.\n\nOctober 6\n\nSOMETHING / COME TOGETHER (single) is released (Apple Records)\n\nContrary to the popular belief that Something was released as a money-maker, the real reason for giving George Harrison his first A-side to this single was to inspire him on as a composer. For in 1990, Beatle historian Mark Lewisohn received a letter from Allen Klein which reads as follows: \"It was done on purpose, not to make money but to help the guy,\" wrote Klein. \"Lennon wanted to help him. He knew that for all intents and purposes for a period of time they weren't going to be working together anymore. Something was a great song. But to make money? Not a chance. It was really to point out George as a writer, and give him courage to go in and do his own LP. Which he did.\"\n\nOctober 20\n\nWEDDING ALBUM (lp) is released by John & Yoko (Apple Records)\n\nCOLD TURKEY / DON'T WORRY KYOKO (single) is released by the Plastic Ono Band (Apple Records)\n\nNovember 26\n\nJohn Lennon returns his M.B.E. to the Queen.

The Lennons third visit to Canada was brokered by Ritchie Yorke. In his book, \"Axes, Chops & Hot Licks - The Canadian Rock Music Scene\" that was published in 1971, he recalled how the arrangement came about: \"In London, in December 1969, I found myself in the office of John and Yoko Lennon discussing their forthcoming peace campaign in Canada. The Lennons needed somewhere to stay during their visit to Toronto, and I suggested the Hawkins estate. Lennon needed a quiet spot, well away from the never ending assaults of the press; he enjoyed the company of rock 'n' rollers; and it appeared that the visit might provide the attention needed to get Hawkins' career back into the orbit internationally.\"\n\nFor the next 6 days, John and Yoko become houseguests with pop rock star Ronnie Hawkins. \"Ah'm friends with the people promoting this peace festival,\" said Hawkins in his Arkansas accent. \"And John and Yoko don't like hotels, so they phoned me from London an' asked if they could stay here while it was being organized. They were wonderful, great. Ah was very honored.\"\n\nHawkins would refer here to the proposed Mosport Peace Festival that was to be held from July 3-5. The event was being organized by rock promoter John Brower, the same person who had John and Yoko perform at Varsity Stadium in Toronto.\n\nAlso on this date, John Lennon and Yoko Ono decide to put up on eleven billboards in major cities from around the world, the following slogan:\n\nClick on the above image for a larger picture. Used with permission from Michael McLuhan.\n\nPop journalist Ritchie Yorke lamented on the historical importance of the peace campaign: \"John totally believed that love could save us. He thought that if one person really stood up, things could be changed. I've never seen anyone so committed to a cause, regardless of the cost. If he thought his actions would serve a purpose, he didn't give a damn if they cost a lot of money or if they offended anyone's sensibilities. The guy was amazingly open-minded; we used to sit around thinking of things to do in the peace campaign, and he never ruled out anything. At one point, somebody decided that the way dates were broken up into B.C. and A.D. was ridiculous, that we should start all over with YEAR ONE A.P., which was AFTER PEACE. John didn't think that was too far fetched; he threw himself into the campaign.\"\n\nClick here for a photo of John and Yoko.\n\nDecember 19\n\n\"BEATLES SEVENTH CHRISTMAS RECORD\" is issued to fans club members\n\nDecember 22\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono arrive by train and arrive in Montreal \"just to say hello\". A press conference is held at Chateau Champlain Hotel. There it is revealed that the Lennon spent $72,000 anti-war billboards and that he would \"send the bill for his ads and posters to U.S. President Richard Nixon,\" wrote the Canadian Press.\n\nAnd although not known to the Montreal press at the time, probably the real reason for John and Yoko arriving in Montreal was to hold talks with two representatives from the Le Dain Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs: Ian L. Campbell and Dr. Heinz Lehmann.\n\nThe Le Dain Commission of Inquiry was the Canadian government's response to the concern over the use of illicit drugs and the need to obtain more information about some of them, in particular cannabis, LSD, and prescription drugs such as tranquillizers and amphetamines. The inquiry was officially announced in the House of Commons on May 1, 1969, by John Munro, Minister for Health and Welfare. (see also: January 19 and May 17, 2003, entry in this timeline for John Lennon's official testimony.)\n\nDecember 23\n\nJohn & Yoko meet with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau which lasted 50 minutes. John declares to the Canadian press about his pro-active peace movement: \"Peace is no violence, no frustration, no fear,\" John Lennon said in a C.B.C. interview, \"If I smile at you, you're liable to smile back. We're smiling at the world.\" On this day, John & Yoko also meet with Canadian Health and Welfare Minister John Munro to discuss the drug culture of the times.\n\nBoth John and Yoko on this date would later fly back to Toronto from Ottawa and while on board the plane, they accidentally meet Lester B. Pearson, a former Canadian Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize recipient for his diplomatic achievement: the proposal of sending United Nations peacekeeping force to the Suez Canal area. Shortly after arriving in Toronto, the couple head back to England by plane.\n\nGRAMMY AWARD (1969):\n\nBest Engineered (Non-Classical Recording) - The Beatles \"Abbey Road\", Geoff Emerick, engineer.\n\n**1970**\n\nJanuary 6\n\nTEMMA HARBOUR/LONTANO DAGLI OCCHI (single) is released (Apple Records)\n\nThe cheerfully bright and breezy \"Temma Harbour\" is released by songstress and Apple recording star Mary Hopkin.

It doesn't,\" wrote Mark Lewisohn in his book \"The Beatles Day by Day.\"\n\nInterestingly enough, printed on March 25 for newsstand sales until April 16, 1970, RollingStone Magazine gives John Lennon's response about the cancellation after a query was made to him from the publisher. \"In the early stages we weren't sure whether the show would be free or not,\" said Lennon. \"There was a lot of talk about the Stones' disaster and we were swayed into thinking maybe if it's free, people would have less respect or some such bullshit. However, Brower and Yorke persuaded us to come to Canada and 'announce the peace festival,' which we did in our usual way.\n\n\"Later, when we were in retreat in Denmark, we began thinking, 'Why shouldn't it all be free? Surely they can hustle some big firms or something to put up the money,\" exclaimed Lennon. \"And anyway, it looked like the national and local government were interested. Wouldn't it be a great plug for 'Young Canada' -- and the tourist trade?\"\n\nHowever, promoter John Brower on at least on particular point disagrees about the two levels of government cooperating together for the Mosport Peace Festival: \"We had tremendous problems with the Ontario government at the time,\" he said to William Ruhlmann of Goldmine Magazine, \"which was a Conservative [Party] government, as opposed to the federal government, which was Liberal [Party]. And since the prime minister of Canada was Liberal and had met with Lennon, therefore the Conservative government was against the festival, because they felt that if it was staged in Ontario it would make the Liberal prime minister look good, and they didn't want to do that.\"\n\nBrower also went on to say that Lennon \"gave us every opportunity to 'Get it together, man,' so to speak, and when we were not able to get a site together and we were not able to consummate financing that would allow us to put the festival on in a way that John felt was most appropriate, he walked away from it.\"\n\nFebruary 26\n\nHEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (lp) is released (Apple Records)\n\nMarch 1\n\n\"Ed Sullivan Show\" - From the Let It Be movie, two film clips are presented to the viewing audience: \"TWO OF US\" and \"LET IT BE\"\n\nMarch 11\n\nLET IT BE / YOU KNOW MY NAME (LOOK UP THE NUMBER) (single) is released (Apple Records)\n\nApril 10\n\nPaul McCartney publicly announces he has left the Beatles because of \"..personal, business and musical differences\"\n\nApril 20\n\nMcCARTNEY (lp) is released by Paul McCartney (Apple Records)\n\nApril 24\n\nSENTIMENTAL JOURNEY (lp) is released by Ringo Starr (Apple Records)\n\nMay 4\n\nIN THE BEGINNING (Circa 1960) (lp) is released (Polydor Records)\n\nMay 11\n\nTHE LONG AND WINDING ROAD / FOR YOU BLUE (single) is released (Apple Records)\n\nThe orchestral score for \"The Long and Winding Road\" was conducted and arranged by Richard Hewson and not scored by Phil Spector as some Beatle fans would assume. Hewson also did the orchestral score for Mary Hopkin's \"Those Were The Days\", \"Goodbye\" and her album \"Postcard\".

It was happening: it was evident on \"Let It Be\"...it was evident in India when George and I stayed there and Paul and Ringo left. And it was evident on the \"White Album, you know...\"\n\nPaul McCartney (interview from Musician & Player on \"When did the Beatles bubble burst?\"): \"About a year before the Beatles broke up, I suppose...friction came in, business things came in, relationships between each other. We were all looking for like...people in our lives, like, John had found Yoko. It made it very difficult. He wanted a very strong intimate life with her, at the same time, we always reserve the intimacy for the group. So we're starting to find those things flashing at you - with Yoko. You had to understand, he had to have time with her. But, does he have to have that much time with her was the sort of feeling in the group. And, uhm, so these things started to create in movable objects and pressures that was just too big.\"\n\nRingo Starr (interview from Anthology): \"You know Allan, a lot of days even with all the craziness it really works still. Instead of working every day, it worked like two days a month, you know, and then there were still good days, we were still really close friends, then it would split up again into some madness.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison (interview from Anthology): \"I just like spent like the last six months producing an album of the fellow Jackie Lomax and hanging out with Bob Dylan and The Band in Woodstock and having a great time and for me to come into the Winter of discontent with the Beatles in Twickenham was very unhealthy and very unhappy....I thought I'm quite capable of being relatively happy on my own and if I'm not able to be happy in this situation, you know, I'm getting out of here.\"\n\nBeatles record producer, Sir George Martin (excerpt from Canadian Music Week, television broadcast, 1998): \"John got very heavily into drugs and his relationship with Yoko was very disruptive with everybody because...I mean, at one point she was always at the sessions -- her very presence was disturbing. She wasn't even introduced to me until four weeks into this, you know. At one point she was ill and John insisted on bringing her bed into the studio so she could lie there ill and watch us make records, and that isn't the best atmosphere to make a record.\" And, \"What upset me most of all, wasn't the fact that I was losing control, which I was, but the fact that they were fighting so much amongst each other. I mean, at one point, John and George actually hit each other - they had a fist fight. And it was very sad because they were such mates. And John was acting very strange at that time...the Let It Be thing...\"\n\nFootnote:Despite their \"ill-will feelings\" towards each other during filming of Let It Be and under their more \"amicable\" recording sessions of Abbey Road, unknown to Beatle fans, Paul McCartney instructs Neil Aspinall to collect all past TV newsreels about the Beatles to be culled from around the world: \"You should collect as much of the material that's out there, get it together before it disappears.\" Recalls Neil: \"So I started to do that, got in touch with all the TV stations around the world...got news footage in...we edited something together.\" In 1996 at the 2nd Annual Ottawa Beatle Convention, Louise Harrison revealed that her brother George had discussed with her back in 1970, the plans for a future Beatle project tentatively called: \"The Long And Winding Road*\". It would be 25 years later before the project would be realized and under a completely different name: \"The Beatles Anthology\". Note: Ian MacDonald's book, \"Revolution in the Head\" claims Neil collected 100 minutes worth of video material from various news sources. An eyewitness to the project was Apple's house-hippie, Richard DiLello, author of the \"The Longest Cocktail Party\" who wrote in his book said that \"a massively ambitious cinematic Beatle document that chronicled their rise from the Cavern to Savile Row\" was being overseen by Neil Aspinal. \"With his two assistants, Tony and Graham, he had amassed all existing footage of the Beatles...the entire gamut of Beatlogical film history...\"\n\nJune 13\n\nThe Beatles \"The Long and Winding Road\" hits the #1 position in Ottawa\n\nSpecial notes of interest: The Beatles \"Let It Be\" and Paul McCartney's \"McCartney\" are the number 1 & 2 albums in Ottawa.

His essay appeared in The Paper, a student newspaper that was distributed at the Loyola College and Sir George Williams University of Montreal (which is now called Concordia University.) To add more grist to the article, \"Power to the People\" by John Lennon/The Plastic Ono Band is being presented. The song was recorded between January 27 - February 9, 1971 and was released as a single in the USA on March 22, 1971. Both the article and video are truly synonymous.\n\nDecember 18\n\nBEATLES CHRISTMAS ALBUM is issued to fans club members only. Compiled on the album were all the previous holiday greetings (45 r.p.m. singles) done by the group and becomes the final yuletide gift. This album was distributed by \"Beatles (U.S.A.)

In a Associated Press report, Lennon accuses McCartney of \"starting to take over\" the group after Epstein's death. \"We broke up then... That was the disintegration.\"\n\nNote: By February, the nastiness would peak. According to \"Apple to the Core\", a book by Peter McCabe & Robert D.Schonfeld, headlines would start \"exploding across...the British papers: \"BEATLE'S FIRM IN GRAVE STATE!\" , \"PAUL IS A SPOILED CHILD -- RINGO!\" \"BEATLES AND THE SPONGERS -- BY LENNON.\"\n\nJanuary 19\n\nLawyer David Hirst, filed papers demanding legal dissolution of the Beatles on behalf of Paul McCartney. The suit is filed against John Lennon, Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr), George Harrison and manager Allen Klein on three grounds: 1) The group no longer performs together; 2) Much against Paul's wishes, Allen Klein was appointed as business manager by the other three Beatles; 3) Paul never saw audited accounts of the bands revenue after Klein was brought on board to manage the group.\n\nApril 15\n\nMOTION PICTURE \"LET IT BE\" GETS AN OSCAR!\n\nOn this date the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gives the nod to the Beatles and awards them with an Oscar for \"Best Film Music-Original Film Score\". This is the only time the Beatles ever won an Oscar and this feat has never been duplicated during their individual solo careers. The award was presented at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles.\n\nNovember 23\n\nAll female band \"Fanny\" from the United States of America covers \"Hey Bulldog\"\n\nHonourable mention: On this date Beat Club, a German music program which ran from September 25, 1965 to December 9, 1972, presents \"Fanny's\" cover version of \"Hey Bulldog.\" Wikipedia writes that Fanny was one of the \"first all-female rock groups to achieve critical and commercial success, including two Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 singles.\" Pop icon David Bowie once declared: \"They were extraordinary: they wrote everything, they played like motherfuckers, they were just colossal and wonderful, and nobody's ever mentioned them. They're as important as anybody else who's ever been, ever; it just wasn't their time.\" Fanny paved the way for later female groups such as the Go-Go's, the Bangles and the Runnaways. These bands have acknowledged Fanny as being a key influence in the development of their musical career.\n\nIn 1969 music producer Richard Perry signed the band to Reprise Records and the original members rocked together on five albums: Fanny (1970); Charity Ball (1971); Fanny Hill (1972); Fanny Live In 1972 (eventually released in 1998); Mothers Pride (1973). The band's final album from that period (minus original band members June Millington and Alice de Buhr) was entitled Rock and Roll Survivors (1974). Here then, is a list of \"Fanny\" band members:\n\nOriginal line-up:\n\nJune Millington: Guitar, vocals\n\nJean Millington: Bass guitar, vocals\n\nNickey Barclay: Keyboards, vocals\n\nAlice de Buhr, Drums, vocals\n\nLater members:\n\nPatti Quatro: Guitar, vocals\n\nBrie Howard: Drums, vocals\n\nCam Davis: Drums, vocals\n\nWendy Haas: Keyboards, vocals\n\nPadi Moschetta: Percussion, vocals\n\nAs you can tell from the above video, these are \"real women playing real music\" in 1971. David Bowie mentioned that the girl band could write their own music and there may have been some spill over when Fanny recorded \"Hey Bulldog.\" The band cleverly writes an additional verse to the song: \"Hedgehog, rubbing in the sand. Bullfrog, giving him a hand. Some kind of attitude is measured out inside. You think you're going but you haven't got a ride.\" This was a great improvisation that turned it into a longer song! Well done Fanny!\n\nFor more information about the band, please visit their Official Fanny Website.\n\nSee also a great interview with June Millington dated October 28, 2021 on NBC News NOW entitled: \"NEW DOCUMENTARY CELEBRATES FANNY, PIONEERING ALL-WOMAN ROCK BAND.\" The documentary is produced by Bobbi Jo Hart and is appropriately called \"Fanny: The Right To Rock.\"\n\n**1973**\n\nMarch 31\n\nAllen Klein's contract and his company ABCKO with John, George and Ringo expires and is not renewed\n\nApril 2\n\nTHE BEATLES / 1962-1966 (double lp) is released\n\nTHE BEATLES / 1967-1970 (double lp) is released\n\nJune 28\n\nAllen Klein and ABCKO sue John Lennon for a total of $508,000 over allegedly unrepaid loans\n\nNovember 2\n\nThree Beatles sue Allen Klein\n\nUnhappy with the past business management practices by Allen Klein, John, George and Ringo decide on legal proceedings against their former manager. According to Allen J. Wiener, author of \"The Beatles - The Ultimate Recording Guide\" wrote that the three Beatles \"fired Allen Klein and sued ABKCO (his company) in High Court over payments due The Beatles. Klein then countersued for $19 million claiming that he was due unpaid fees. When the suits were settled on Jan 10, 1977, Klein paid The Beatles $800,000 and The Beatles paid ABKCO between $1 million and $5 million. Klein had also sued Paul for $34 million, but that suit was thrown out of court. Klein was later sentenced in New York to two months in prison and a $5,000 fine for tax offences. Klein's approaching departure from Apple ushered in a period of renewed goodwill among The Beatles.\"\n\n**1975**\n\nJanuary 9\n\nJudge rules in McCartney's favor and the Beatles are \"officially dissolved.\"\n\nJuly 17\n\nRingo Starr and Maureen Starkey are divorced\n\nGRAMMY AWARDS: \"Hall of Fame\" - The Beatles\n\n**1976**\n\nMay 7\n\nBeatles bodyguard and roadie, Mal Evans, dies tragically from police gunfire\n\nMay 31\n\nGOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE / HELTER SKELTER (single) is released (Capitol Records)\n\nJune 11\n\nROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC (double lp) is released (Capitol Records)\n\nThis album becomes the largest promotion campaign ever made by Capitol and Parlophone records.

Keith Badman reports that on Friday, November 28, 1980: \"As part of a legal deposition for Apple Corps against the producers of the 'Beatlemania' stage show, John states today that: 'I and the three other former Beatles have plans to stage a reunion concert', an event to be filmed and included as the finale to The Long and Winding Road, an official Beatles produced documentary to be released in the mid-Eighties.

His music and that of the Beatles was worldwide in importance. Every death of someone of John Lennon's stature intensifies this trauma. We mourn his loss.\"\n\nELLIE GREENWICH (who wrote \"Be My Baby\"): \"It's a sin he was taken away from us. He was a tremendous talent. What he gave to the world can't be comprehended.\"\n\nNORMAN MAILER: \"We have lost a genius of the spirit.\"\n\nFRANK SINATRA: \"It was a staggering moment when I heard the news. Lennon was a most talented man and, above all, a gentle soul.\"\n\nMURRAY THE \"K\": \"The thing that impressed me about John Lennon in particular was his honesty. He was truthful. He told you what you felt. The man also had a tremendous amount of empathy. I remember when I was having a few problems. I had been Murray the K, a celebrity in my own right, for years before the Beatles came along. Now it seemed that everyone identified me only with them. John and I had a long talk about it. He encouraged me a lot. I also remember John's courage. He came out against the Vietnam War before most other entertainers. He also fought a deportation hearing because he wanted to stay in America. I was proud to be with him in that battle.\"\n\nHOWARD COSELL: \"I'll tell you something that no one should forget about John Lennon: he was never, ever a hypocrite about anything he ever did or said or believed. With his family, his music, his ideals and his opinions, he was a man of conviction and commitment. I am proud to have known him.\"\n\nRead also: Lennon dreamed for us all + 5000 in Ottawa say farewell\n\n**1981**\n\nApril 27\n\nFive years after his divorce, Ringo marries actress Barbara Bach\n\n**1982**\n\nFebruary 2\n\nAmerican radio DJ Murray The \"K\" Kaufman who was responsible for promoting the Beatles over the New York airwaves, passes away from a long fight with cancer\n\nMarch 22\n\nREEL MUSIC (lp) is released (Capitol Records)\n\nMOVIE MEDLEY / I'M HAPPY JUST TO DANCE WITH YOU (single) is released (Capitol Records)\n\nOctober 11\n\n20 GREATEST HITS (lp) is released (Capitol Records)\n\n**1984**\n\nMay 18\n\nEast Germany's first book on the Beatles became an instant hit\n\n**1985**\n\nAugust 10\n\nMichael Jackson buys up publishing rights of the Beatles music for $47 million\n\n**1988**\n\nMarch 7\n\nPAST MASTERS VOLUME 1 & 2 (cd) is released (Capitol Records)\n\n**1989**\n\nGRAMMY AWARD: Lifetime Achievement Award, John Lennon\n\n**1990**\n\nVIDEO: \"THE BEATLES FIRST U.S. VISIT\"\n\nAPPLE/MPI Home Videos release an 83 minute video which includes the first three Ed Sullivan shows\n\nGRAMMY AWARD: Lifetime Achievement Award: Paul McCartney\n\n**1994**\n\nJohn Lennon is inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, performers category\n\nNovember 30\n\nTHE BEATLES LIVE AT THE B.B.C.

While George begins to proceed down to the ground floor room to investigate, Olivia alerts the staff on the intercom. George discovers that a 33-year-old knife-wielding intruder has entered his Friar Park mansion. George confronts the attacker first in an exchange of words but cannot determine the intruders identity. Harrison then tackles the intruder in an effort to subdue him but gets stabbed in the chest. George slumps to the floor and screams out. Upon hearing the screams, Olivia runs downstairs while their son Dhani emerges. The attacker spots Olivia on the landing and steps over Georges body and starts to move toward her. At this point, Olivia picks up a very heavy brass base -- a lamp, and yelled at the attacker. She manages to take the lamp and smashes it across the assailants head, but in the exchange, Olivia receives cuts to her forehead and hands. Miraculously, Olivia's blow to the assailants head was hard enough to cause him to stagger up to the landing where he collapsed and allowing them to detain the attacker. By this time, the police are well on their way to Friar Park after a staff member alerted authorities by phone. Thames Valley Police arrive and they arrest the suspect. George and Olivia are rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. Olivia is treated for minor injuries and is released but George Harrison would be transferred just before 3:00 p.m. to the Harefield Hospital in west London where he would be treated for a minor collapse of the right lung. There, George would remain in stable condition with Olivia and their son Dhani staying by his bedside during the night. George Harrison would be released from hospital on January 1. The suspect is formally charged with two counts of attempted murder. His next court appearance would be scheduled for February 11.\n\nWHAT THE IMMEDIATE BEATLE FAMILY SAID:\n\nSir Paul McCartney: \"Thank God that both George and Olivia are all right. I send them all my love. I have no further comment to make.\"\n\nRingo Starr: \"Both Barbara and I are deeply shocked that this has occurred. We send George and Olivia all our love and wish George a speedy recovery.\"\n\nSir George Martin: \"I am shocked and naturally appalled by this....George leads a very quiet life...Hes very down to earth. He likes nothing more than doing his garden....George is a very peaceful person who hates violence of any kind.\"\n\nYoko Ono: \"My heart goes out to George, Olivia and Dhani, and I hope he will recover quickly.\"\n\nUpdate: The attacker's date for his first trial hearing was postponed so that a more in-depth psychiatric assessment could be made of the accused. The attacker eventually pleads not guilty by reason of insanity. The actual trial date commenced on November 14, 2000, at Oxford Crown Court and lasted for two days. During the hearing, medical testimony was submitted from three different psychiatrists supporting their position that the attacker was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia since 1990. Based on the evidence presented during the hearing, Judge Michael Astill instructed the jurors to find the accused innocent by reason of insanity. The jurors acquiesced to the judges request. Judge Michael Astill then ordered the assailant to be held in a mental hospital \"without time restriction\" and must gain the approval of a mental health tribunal if he seeks release.\n\nDecember 31\n\nAt the Dome in Greenwich, London, the Beatles song \"All You Need Is Love\" is sung by performers to herald in the New Millennium.

Right behind The Beatles (\"The White Album\") are The Beatles 1967-1970 at fifteen million, The Beatles 1962-1966 at fourteen million, Magical Mystery Tour at six million, Revolver at five million and Love Songs at three million. The July certifications bring the Beatles' totals up to 113.5 million units, solidifying their spot as the highest certified artists in history.\n\nOctober 5\n\n\"THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY\" book is released\n\nWith 340,000 words and 1,300 images spread out over 368 pages, The Beatles first memoir is released by Chronicle Books on this date. Matt Hurwitz of Good Day Sunshine magazine in an interview with Edna Gundersen of USA Today, reports the Anthology as \"a well-put-together book that certainly worth the price. The four most important pop-culture icons of the past several decades finally tell their own story and set the record straight,\" he says. \"Funny thing is, they have different recollections.\"\n\nIn that same report, leading Beatle historian Martin Lewis had this to say about the Beatles Anthology book: \"It's an absolute joy to possess....It's an auto-chronology, in the tradition of an oral history. People react differently when responding in spoken word to posed questions. It's the difference between recollection and reflection. The Beatles have made such a deep impact on society and history and culture, they owe it to themselves to place their immense contribution in perspective.\"\n\nThe USA Today report revealed that 75% of attendees at Los Angeles and New York Beatle Conventions are under the age of 25. With such a captivating interest held today by the younger generation regarding The Beatles and their music, Martin Lewis related that this group of Beatle fans will also embrace the new book: \"Cynics, all these Blue Meanies, claim The Beatles appeal only to boomers\", Lewis says, \"But young people like the music and understand the message. You can be Dionysian, like the Stones or Eminem, and be negative and aggressive, or you can be Apollonian, like The Beatles, and engage with the noblest part of the human spirit. That never goes out of fashion, because it's natural to yearn for things to be better.\"\n\nOctober 14\n\n\"THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY\" tops New York Times bestseller list\n\nAs reported in Rolling Stone.com by Andrew Dansby: \"Anyone who thinks Beatlemania died with the birth of the Seventies is mistaken. The Beatles Anthology hit stores a week ago to reams of press and scores of eager buyers, enough to send the book to the top of the New York Times bestseller list. A sixty dollar price tag for the coffee-table book didn't seem to have any affect on Anthology's sales as the book outsold all non-fiction hardcovers on the Times' Oct. 22-28 bestseller list, even besting the debut of Stephen King's latest book, the anticipated On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.\n\nWith an initial printing of 300,000...the book has been moving in numbers large enough to put it atop Barnes & Noble.com's list of bestsellers. A more telling statistic is the book's life in independent bookstores. One of New York City's finest independent booksellers, Coliseum Books, reports that they've sold more than half of their initial shipment and after one week, they've placed an additional order for more copies, describing the early sales for such a pricey book as \"quite strong.\"\n\nOctober 17\n\nWalter Shenson, producer of the first two Beatle movies, \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help!\" passes away at the age of 81.\n\nOctober 26\n\nPAUL McCARTNEY HAS NEW LOVE\n\nOn an Independent British television program where Heather Mills was being interviewed, Paul made a surprise guest appearance. Said the show's producer, Will Hanrahan, \"Sir Paul and Heather are quite clearly madly in love and we are delighted to have been part of that.\"\n\nPaul McCartney expressed that his year-long relationship with Heather Mills has put \"romance back into my life. I love her, and I get a lot of pleasure from that.\" Paul also acknowledged that his relationship to Mills had helped him overcome the pain of losing his wife Linda, who died two years ago as a result of breast cancer (Linda and Paul were happily married together for more than 30 years up until that point.)\n\nNovember 13\n\nTHE BEATLES 1 (double-lp; CD; cassette) is released (Apple/EMI Records)\n\nWith a collection of 27 all-time chart-topping hits assembled on an album, The Beatles 1 becomes the 15th U.K. No.1 record by John, Paul, George, and Ringo. A report dated November 22 from the Reuters news agency, declared the album as being officially certified as the fastest-selling album in Britain. A spokesman for the three surviving Beatles said: \"The record has sold more than 319,000 copies in Britain in its first week. Robbie Williams sold 313,000 albums earlier this year, so the Beatles have topped him.\" In that same report, a spokesman for Tower Records in Britain mentioned: \"Teen bands seem to knock each other off the charts week after week....They don't seem to have staying power, but the Beatles certainly do.\" In the United States, since the albums first debut, a November 22 report in Billboard Magazine claimed the album had sold 595,000 copies. Capitol president Roy Lott said \"1\" is also tops in 16 other countries to date, including such key markets as Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Australia and Spain. Towards the end of November, a revised figure from Reuters news agency revealed that the new album actually \"has hit number one in 19 countries in its first week of release\". The same report went on to say that Japan's fans led the way, buying up 750,000 copies of the Beatles' greatest hits album.\n\nBy the end of the third week, Beatles 1 became the No. #1 album in 28 different countries. Having thus sold 12 million copies within those first three weeks, the disc is recorded by the press as the fastest seller ever in the pop music industry.\n\nAlso on this date \"THE BEATLES 1\" official website is launched\n\nExecutive producer for the site is Neil Aspinall Click on the Beatles 1 album cover above...the link will transport you to another historical magical mystery tour of the band filled with rare photos of The Beatles and slick high-tech computer animation!\n\nNovember 17\n\nTHE BEATLES REVOLUTION\n\n\"The Beatles helped bring down communism in Russia\"\n\nABC Television in the United States broadcasts a two-hour documentary called \"The Beatles Revolution\". The show was televised on Friday between 8:00 - 10:00 p.m. which attracted 8.7 million viewers.\n\nMilos Forman, director of Academy Award-winning \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" said: \"It sounds ridiculous but I'm convinced The Beatles are partly responsible for the fall of Communism.\"\n\nHis claim is backed up by Dr. Yury Pelyushonok, a Canadian based Doctor of Soviet Studies in Medicine and author of \"Strings For A Beatle Bass\" who grew up in the former USSR in the 1960s: \"The Beatles had this tremendous impact on Soviet kids. The Soviet authorities thought of The Beatles as a secret Cold War weapon,\" he said.\n\n\"The kids lost their interest in all Soviet unshakable dogmas and ideals, and stopped thinking of an English speaking person as the enemy.\"\n\nAs the interview progressed, Milos Forman also added in: \"That's when the Communists lost two generations of young people ideologically, totally lost. That was an incredible impact.\" Rolling Stone Keith Richards suggests that the music of the 1960s played a big part in bringing about the end of Communism: \"After those billions of dollars, and living under the threat of doom, what brought it down? Blue jeans and rock 'n' roll.\"\n\nInterestingly enough, the ABC television program pointed out that today there is a special \"Yellow Submarine Ride\" with Beatle cartoons located at what was once known as \"Check-point Charlie\" at the Berlin wall. The ride is used to help to bridge and mend the differences between East verses West societies. \"All You Need Is Love\" cartoon was featured as the younger children in the ride watched on.\n\nSee letter to The Guardian from Dr. Yury Pelyushonok.

The present interior is not designed to fit the present day activity of a lively parish.\"\n\nCannon John Roberts' announcement quickly gave rise to hostile reaction when, in a BBC News article dated April 13, reported that the clergyman was receiving \"hate mail\" from Beatle fans in an attempt to prevent the destruction of stage. \"I have received hate mail. These people are ignorant. I have gone out of my way over the years to welcome Beatle fans.\"\n\nLater, in article from the \"Daily Post\" dated June 18, reveals the Church Council had been in discussion the night before and have given consideration to sell off pieces of the stage during an auction. The amount of money the church could collect from a future auction is unknown but Paul Wane, owner of Trax, a Beatles memorabilia company suggested parts of the stage could be \"mounted on plaques\" and auctioned off: \"This is what we did with the bricks from The Cavern Club and The Empire. If the church decides this is what they want to do with the stage, then we would be very interested in selling it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the same article, the Daily Post goes on to say that \"Liverpool City Council is pleading with the church not to destroy the stage.\" In spite of the Council's pleas, the church attempts to auction off the stage on November 27, 2001, at \"London's Sticky Finger's Cafe\" but fails to sell it for £50,000.\n\nMay 3\n\nBBC NEWS REPORTS:\n\n\"EX-BEATLE HARRISON TREATED FOR CANCER\"\n\nIn a statement from George Harrison's solicitors, George visited the Mayo Clinic in the United States which specializes in cancer treatment to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs.

The Times Newspaper went on to say that \"Within a year or so of his first encounter with the Fab Four, Millings was playing a self-mocking role as a miserable tailor in the film A Hard Days Night, while pop stars, aristocrats, barristers and foreign diplomats lined up for suit fittings at his small workshop in the heart of Soho.\" The article also acknowledged the fact that Millings made the special costumes for Paul McCartney's 1972 \"Wings\" tour as well as the specials suits used in the photography shoot for the \"Band on the Run\" album cover.

Under the care of Dr. Gil Lederman, a specialist who works with advanced cancer cases, used a treatment on George that is called \"stereotactic radiosurgery\" which \"attacks tumors with high doses of radiation but with minimal damage to surrounding tissue\" the BBC reported.\n\nThe Staten Island University Hospital helped George get his appetite back up which he had lost before. Though Dr. Gil Lederman would not state whether or not George would live as a result of the treatment, it is suspected by fans that the prognoses not looking good for the former Beatle.\n\nIn a report from Australia's News.com.au dated November 21, states that both Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr had an \"emotional reunion with George Harrison\" and that Paul had \"broken down in tears when the three surviving Beatles got together in New York last week.\"\n\nNovember 25\n\nAPPLE DISCUSSES A STAGE PRODUCTION\n\nWITH INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED \"CIRQUE DU SOLEIL\"\n\nThe Sunday Times report that Apple Records is currently in discussion with \"Cirque du Soleil\" regarding a theatric stage production of \"Yellow Submarine.\" The show would include acrobats, clowns, and aerial contortionists featuring the cartoon music from the Beatles \"Yellow Submarine\" film.\n\nIn an article from Launch.com, they report that: \"The negotiation process has been slow moving due to the complexity of the Beatles' business affairs. Others involved in the talks include Yoko Ono, on John Lennon's behalf, and Michael Jackson, who co-owns many of the copyrights to the Beatles' songs.\"\n\nWhen the contract is signed, it is expected that the \"show will be at the heart of a themed entertainment complex in London, according to sources close to Cirque du Soleil.\"\n\nNovember 26\n\nABC NEWS HEADLINE: \"FADING STAR\"\n\nABC News.com reports the following on George Harrison:\n\n\"No Luck With Radical Procedure -- Harrison, 58, left New York's Staten Island University Hospital last week after undergoing an experimental type of radiosurgery. That process reportedly did not stop Harrison's brain tumor from spreading. He flew from New York to UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles to treat the inoperable malignancy with the more conventional chemotherapy.\n\n\"Harrison is said to be weak and near the end of his life. But Sunday People said the rock star is not giving up.\"\n\nNovember 29\n\nA \"LIGHT THAT HAS LIGHTED THE WORLD\" IS NO MORE:\n\nGEORGE HARRISON PASSES AWAY\n\nAfter a brave and valiant fight, George Harrison, known as \"the quiet Beatle\", succumbs to cancer. The 58 year-old songwriter, musician, reportedly died at 1:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m., U.K. time) on Thursday in the Los Angeles home of his friend and noted security expert on celebrities, Gavin de Becker. According to Geoff Boucher, Los Angeles Times staff reporter noted in their November 30th on-line edition that \"Harrison's wife, Olivia Arias Harrison, and son, Dhani, were with him at the time of his death, which was not announced until early Friday morning.\"\n\nWhile George was dying in Becker's Studio City mansion that Thursday, the Sunday Telegraph reported that both Olivia and Dhani \"were at his side and with two Hare Krishna friends, Shayam Sundara and Mukunda, they sang soft chants as he died serenely.\" The Daily Record reported that \"Within hours, he was cremated in a private Hare Krishna service.\n\n\"His ashes will be scattered in the holy River Yamuna, 40 miles from the Taj Mahal in India.\" (Note: More details were slowly surfacing over the weekend as to where George's ashes would be scatterd. In a Fox News report dated December 3, reveals George's ashes were \"to arrive in India on Monday and be sprinkled in the Ganges River in the northern city of Varnasi....They were also to be scattered in Allahabad, where hindu's three holiest rivers -- the Ganges, Yamuna, and Saraswati -- converge.\" -- end of quote.)\n\nThe Harrison family, upon reacting to the immediate outpouring by all those who loved and enjoyed George Harrison for his friendship, music, and spiritual beliefs, released a statement which was picked up by the news media including \"Ananaova.com\" on December 2. The following was read to the press by their friend, Gavin de Becker:\n\n\"We are deeply touched by the outpouring of love and compassion from people around the world,\" said Mr. Harrison's wife Olivia and son Dhani.\n\n\"The profound beauty of the moment of George's passing - of his awakening from this dream - was no surprise to those of us who knew how he longed to be with God. In that pursuit, he was relentless.\"\n\nMr. de Becker said: \"Olivia and Dhani invite you to join them in a minute of meditation in honour of George's journey, wherever you are on Monday at 1:30 p.m. PST (1830 GMT).\"\n\nGeorge leaves behind his wife, Olivia who is 53, and his beautiful son Dhani, who is 24. He is also survived by his brothers Harry, Peter and sister Louise. George is also survived by his first wife, Pattie Boyd, who met each other on the filming set of \"A Hard Day's Night\" in 1964, the Beatles first motion picture.\n\nWHAT THE IMMEDIATE BEATLE FAMILY SAID:\n\nOLIVIA HARRISON (issued their first statement to the press on behalf of the family through Gavin de Becker): \"He left this world as he lived in it, conscious of God, fearless of death and at peace, surrounded by family and friends.\n\n\"He often said, 'Everything else can wait but the search for God can't wait, and love one another'.\"\n\nDHANI HARRISON: \"We're truly grateful for the tremendous support we've received from friends and from the very many members of the public whom we don't know personally, but who thought of us and send us good wishes.\"\n\nSIR PAUL McCARTNEY (speaking from his St John's Wood home, north-west London): \"I am devastated and very, very sad.\n\n\"We knew he'd been ill for a long time. He was a lovely guy and a very brave man and had a wonderful sense of humour.\n\n\"He is really just my baby brother.\"\n\nRINGO STARR (from Vancouver, Canada): \"George was a best friend of mine. I loved him very much and I will miss him greatly.\n\n\"Both Barbara and I send our love and light to Olivia and Dhani.\n\n\"We will miss George for his sense of love, his sense of music and his sense of laughter.\"\n\nYOKO ONO: \"George has given so much to us in his lifetime and continues to do so even after his passing, with his music, his wit and his wisdom.\"\n\n\"His life was magical and we all felt we had shared a little bit of it by knowing him.\n\n\"Thank you, George - it was grand knowing you.\"\n\nSIR GEORGE MARTIN: \"George was a wonderful musician and a fine human being.\n\n\"He was the baby of the Beatles, and unlike Paul and John, he had a hard time developing his songwriting talent and making his music alone.\n\n\"But he worked hard, and with enormous patience, building his music meticulously, and he eventually came to write one of the greatest love songs of all time - Something.\n\n\"George was a true friend, intensely loyal, caring deeply for those he loved and he inspired much love in return. Now I believe, as he did, that he has entered a higher state. God give him peace.\"\n\nNEIL ASPINALL (Head of Apple Records): \"This is a very sad day for Apple and for all Beatles fans worldwide.\n\n\"It was my privilege to have been a friend of such a very special man - he will be greatly missed by us all.\"\n\nPATTIE BOYD (George's first wife said with tears streaming from her eyes): \"I am just so, so sad. Of course, we've been expecting it, but when it actually happens it is still a great shock and I'm terribly upset.\"\n\nCYNTHIA LENNON: \"This is a very sad day for myself and everyone who knew and loved George. He was part of my teenage years, he was part of my marriage to John, in fact, a very important and unforgettable part of my life. He was part of my family.\"\n\nJULIAN LENNON: \"It is a sad day for all of us, I loved George very much. He was the kindest of men. Our time together, though little, was always memorable. He was a man to be inspired by and he certainly touched my heart and millions of others. He will be missed, but I believe that after all the pain he has endured, he is finally at peace. My heart goes out to Olivia and Dhani, but I know that George is still with them in spirit and will be guarding them every day of their lives until they meet again. George you are beautiful.\n\nLuv Ya Always,\n\nJulian x\"\n\nWHAT THE FAMOUS SAID ABOUT GEORGE:\n\nTONY BLAIR, PRIME MINISTER OF BRITAIN: \"He wasn't just a great musician, an artist, but did a lot of work for charity as well. He'll be greatly missed around the world.\"\n\nGERRY SCOTT, LIVERPOOL'S LORD MAYOR: \"He was one of the greatest Liverpudlians. He was a warm, peace-loving man who was much more than a talented musician.\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH II (a spokesperson, representing the Queen, announced): \"The Queen was saddened by the news of George Harrison's death.\"\n\nBADRUDDOZA CHOWDHURY, PRESIDENT OF BANGLADESH (on remembering George's August 1, 1971 \"Bangla Desh\" benefit concert): \"The people of Bangladesh consider Harrison as their beloved man, who felt for them in 1971 during their days of agony and distress.\"\n\nKHALEDA ZIA, PRIME MINISTER OF BANGLADESH: \"George Harrison will be remembered forever by the people of Bangladesh.''\n\nJEAN CHRETIEN, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: \"He was a great personality. The Beatles were, for a lot of people, extremely important and they made a big impact at that time and it was a great group.\"\n\nLIONEL JOSPIN, PRIME MINISTER OF FRANCE (declared George as): \"...one of the great figures of pop music\" and \"an impressive and masterful guitarist.\"\n\nBOB DYLAN: \"He was a giant, a great, great soul, with all of the humanity, all of the wit and humor, all the wisdom, the spirituality, the common sense of a man and compassion for people. He inspired love and had the strength of a hundred men. He was like the sun, the flowers and the moon and we will miss him enormously. The world is a profoundly emptier place without him.\"\n\nMICK JAGGER (of the Rolling Stones): \"I am very saddened by George's death and will miss him enormously. As a guitarist, he invented many classic lines that were much copied by others and he wrote several very beautiful songs that we will always remember.\"\n\nALLAN WILLIAMS (Beatles' first manager): \"He was a loveable person. I would say he was the major cog in The Beatles at that time. He kept them together probably because of the calming effect he had.\"\n\nPETE BEST (the Beatles original drummer): \"It is a tragic loss of life, a tragic loss of a great musician.\"\n\nGERRY MARSDEN (of \"Gerry and the Pacemakers\" who shared the Cavern spotlight on stage with the Beatles): \"This is a black day...he was always trying to find his own way. By the end, he had.\"\n\nJAMES BROWN (the \"godfather of soul\"): \"George Harrison was one of the world's few good men, one of the better people I ever met. I will and the world will miss him. He was truly loved.\"\n\nDENNY LAINE (who played in Paul McCartney's post-Beatles group, Wings): \"It was an uncanny feeling....George was a very special person. I know you all loved him. I loved him. God bless you George.\"\n\nPHILIP NORMAN (author of Beatles biography \"Shout\" stated it was an \"awful shock\"): \"There was a certain bitterness about him, but later in life he realized what good fortune he had enjoyed.\n\n\"He had a happy marriage and a son and realized there was more to life than being a Beatle.\"\n\nJEFF HEALEY (who did a cover version of George's \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"): \"I never had occasion to meet the man, unfortunately. I definitely would have loved to.\n\n\"George's work with the Beatles is probably my favourite.\n\n\"He was a wonderful writer and a great guitar player as well and he wasn't given credit enough for that. His general positive attitude towards things will be missed. However, it's still present in the music that he made.\"\n\nMARY HOPKIN (former Apple recording artist and who, until recently, lived near him in Henley-on-Thames, said): \"It was not a surprise but was nevertheless tragic news. I hadn't seen him for some time, not since his illness, and it's a great loss especially as he had such enormous talent.\"\n\nCILLA BLACK (songstress from the Cavern days who later had enormously successful string of hit songs composed by the Beatles, said): \"I am deeply saddened and shocked to hear the news about George. My sympathies are with Olivia and Dhani and the rest of the family at this very sad time.\"\n\nPETE TOWNSHEND (from \"The Who\" rock group): \"Goodbye sweet man. ATMP.\"\n\nBRYAN ADAMS (Canadian singer/guitarist, performed with George in 1998 at the Prince's Trust charity concerts at Wembley Arena in London): \"It's a sad day, because we don't need fewer people that make such beautiful music.\"\n\nJEFF LYNNE (member of George's \"Traveling Wilburys\" and music producer): \"You always knew where you stood with George, he was totally honest. I feel blessed to have been so close to him. He was a great friend. He wrote brilliantly original songs, played the greatest slide guitar and had the most amazing sense of humor. He really had the 'Inner Light' and always will. Some of the happiest days of my life were spent in the studio with George.\"\n\nBRIAN WILSON (from the '60s rock group \"The Beach Boys\"): \"I am horribly saddened by the death of George Harrison. While we were not personal friends, I think that just like everybody in the world, I have always considered all the Beatles to be my friends. Their arrival in America in 1964 was electrifying, one of the most exciting things that ever happened in my life, and their music has always and will always mean so much to me.\"\n\nTONY BARROW (Beatles press officer from 1962-68): \"George was certainly the friendliest Beatle from the very beginning.\n\n\"He had the reputation for being the quiet one. He hated all of the Beatlemania thing. When I was arranging interviews for George I had to be very selective because sit him down in front of an interviewer who wants to know about his collection of instruments and he would talk all day.\n\n\"He was a fastidious musician - before a performance he'd often be putting not only his own guitar in tune but also the instruments of the other lads....He was a fine musician, and if he had not lived under this overbearing shadow of Lennon and McCartney he would have been recognized as a great songwriter rather earlier.\n\n\"This is a very sad day.\"\n\nBOB WOOLER (The Cavern's compère who introduced the Beatles on stage): \"George had to fight all the way to get the recognition he deserved.\n\n\"The others really asserted themselves, and of course, eventually found the winning formula which was Lennon and McCartney.\n\n\"But in those early days it would have been wrong to talk in terms of the Mersey Sound, because all the Beatles sang in strict rotation, and mostly cover numbers made famous by other artists.\n\n\"This meant that George, who always stood on the left, looking at the stage, sang quite a lot.\"\n\nMICHAEL PALIN (former Monty Python comedian): \"I was amazed and delighted he was such a Python fan.\n\n\"He enabled us to make Life of Brian and other films like A Private Function - none of these would have happened without his enthusiasm.\n\n\"George had a great sense of humour - some of the best laughs I've had have been with George.\"\n\nJOOLS HOLLAND (one of the last musicians to work and record with George): \"I'm deeply saddened to hear of the loss of my dear friend George.\n\n\"We've not only lost one of the most important figures in popular music, but more importantly one of the friendliest, most generous and funniest of people I've ever met.\"\n\n(Note: It is believed that George's final recording was on October 1, 2001, at his Swiss home. He cut vocal to the track \"Horse to the Water\" which is co-written by his son, Dhani. George, knowing the eventual fate of his own mortality, used his dark humour and credited the song to \"RIP Ltd 2001.\" The album -- \"Small World Big Band\" -- contains George's new composition and made its debut in the final week of November, coming in at 18th spot on the U.K. charts.)\n\nMARTIN LEWIS (Beatle historian): \"As a guitar player, he was exemplary. So many musicians talked about how they wanted the George Harrison sound. The group the Byrds, in America, listened to Harrison and said, 'I want to be like that.' So many guitar players today emulate Harrison's guitar playing. You listen to his playing in the '60s, he doesn't sound out of date at all. It is as contemporary today as it was then.\"\n\nALLAN KOZINN (Beatle historian and New York Times reporter): \"...he served as an anchor for the quartet, leading the others on a spiritual quest toward Eastern philosophy that influenced their music in the latter part of the 1960's, epitomized for millions of fans by the sitar he played on \"Norwegian Wood.\"\n\nRAVI SHANKAR (sitar virtuoso): \"George was my student. But on the other hand he was a very close friend. His death has been a tremendous shock to me which cannot be expressed in words....I pray to God that his soul to rest in peace.\"\n\nKEITH RICHARDS (of the Rolling Stones): \"To me, George was, always will be, above all, a real gentleman, in the full meaning of the word...Let's hope he's jamming with John.\"\n\nDecember 2 GEORGE HARRISON SECRETLY RECORDED FINAL CD: \"PORTRAIT OF A LEG END\"\n\nThe Times of London reports that George Harrison was secretly recording in his final months on an album entitled: \"Portrait of a Leg End.\" The project's title is inspired on a parody taken from \"a squashing foot graphic\" found in the opening sequence of the Monty Python television series.\n\nIt is believed that there are 25 tracks that have been recorded. George, apparently, played the tracks on CD format to family and friends -- just four days prior to his death. There are a few tracks that date back to the early '80s but the Times of London reported that the bulk of material is more recent and is an attempt by George to put his musical legacy in order. Actually, taking care of his musical legacy really began when he re-released \"All Things Must Pass\" not too long ago which contained a new recording of \"My Sweet Lord\" and several other bonus tracks.\n\nJim Keltner, long-time friend and musician who drummed on a lot of Harrison's solo tracks including \"Portrait of a Leg End\" said that \"It was fantastic to be in the studio with him again. Some of the new songs are very poignant concerning his life in the past few years. It will be obvious when you hear them what they are about. There is a certain soulfulness about George's music that doesn't need a lot once he has put that voice on.\"\n\nKeltner also went on to say: \"I saw him last Sunday night. It was a great gift to us that he was so beautiful. He looked fantastic. He looked like a prince. He didn't look like a person suffering from cancer. His skin was shining and he was smiling.\"\n\nThe Times of London also believes that Eric Clapton and a host of other musicians played on the tracks.\n\nDecember 22\n\nBEAT BROTHER ROY YOUNG TELLS ALL!\n\nPhoto: © Greg Malo, Thunder Bay Blues Festival, 2004. Used with permission.\n\nOn this date, Beat Brother Roy Young gives an exclusive interview with Ottawa Beatles Site proprietor, Tony Copple. Roy Young, famous for his boogie woogie piano talents throughout the music industry, reminisces about his days when he performed on stage in Hamburg with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Tony Sheridan and Pete Best. Roy provides the reader with his observations about the musical growth of those band members and also comments on those famous Polydor recording sessions they did for Burt Kaempfert.\n\nRoy Young also brings us up-to-date on his latest recording project entitled \"Now and Then.\" It is during this section of the interview when discussing his musical tributes from the album that we learn about Roy's most heartfelt reflections on the passing of his former band mates John Lennon and George Harrison.\n\nFor the complete text interview with RealPlayer audio files, please click on following link:\n\nhttp://beatles.ncf.ca/roy.html\n\n**2002**\n\nFebruary 7\n\nHISTORIC BEATLE STAGE SAVED\n\nLiverpool City Council reaches an agreement with church authorities: The stage at Saint Peter's Church Hall in Woolton will be put into storage \"in an undisclosed location while talks are held to find a permanent home,\" reports the BBC.\n\nWhile the church attempted last year to sell the stage at London's \"Sticky Finger's Cafe,\" it failed to do so because a buyer could not be found to match the £50,000 price tag they were asking for.\n\nWith the failed auction, Liverpool City Council quickly moved in to rescue the historic stage: \"The days are long gone when the city council turned a blind eye to its heritage by allowing places like the Cavern to be demolished,\" said Councillor Mike Storey. \"We will never let that happen again. It was on this very spot that one of the most successful musical partnerships in history first began.\"\n\nMike Storey concluded by saying: \"This stage is an important part of The Beatles legend - Liverpool without the Beatles would be like Stratford without Shakespeare.\"\n\nFebruary 8\n\nEMI RECORDS TO BE SCRAPPED\n\nOn this date, the BBC News reported the following: \"Troubled music company EMI Group is to reshuffle its artists and staff in a move that will mean the EMI record label will cease to exist.\n\nThe EMI Group will merge its labels into two global brands, Virgin and Capitol.\"\n\nSurprisingly, the origins of EMI happened under similar conditions: to avoid bankruptcy, the Gramophone Company and its arch-rival the Columbia Graphophone Company merged in April 1931 to form Electric and Musical Industries when the Great Depression hit.\n\nBOB WOOLER -- THE CAVERN CLUB'S COMPÈRE -- PASSES AWAY\n\nAfter a lengthy illness, Bob Wooler, the man who introduced the Beatles nearly 400 times between 1961 and 1963 in the Cavern Club, passes away at the age of 76 in the Royal Liverpool hospital.\n\nLiverpool music promoter, Joe Flannery -- who was a personal friend to Bob Wooler since 1950, made the following comments about the loss of his friend: He was the gentleman of the Cavern. He was so loved by everybody. Flannery also added that Bob never cashed in on being such a vital part of the Beatles scene, but his name will remain forever a vital part of that story.\n\nBob Wooler, who was restless working as a clerk in the railway dock offices in Garston, entered the music business in 1956 by managing skiffle acts. His job involved booking skiffle acts (such as the Kingstrums) into different club venues where he soon found himself introducing his acts as a way to warm up the audiences. The next natural progression in Bob Wooler's music career saw himself taking on the additional role of \"Disc Jockey\" at those clubs. Bob would play records between performance breaks while the next act was getting ready to perform. By 1960, his name became synonymous within Liverpool's music scene thus allowing him to have a solid foundation to work from.\n\nBob Wooler first met Paul McCartney and George Harrison at a bus stop at the Holyoake Dance Hall in Liverpool during the month of December in 1960. Upon noticing that both Paul and George were carrying guitars, he offered them a booking at the Litherland Town Hall on December 27, 1960 for a £6 fee. Paul McCartney singles out the December 27 date in his Whos Who entry as being the \"first important appearance as the Beatles.\"\n\nShortly after the Litherland Town Hall venue, Wooler booked the bands first residency at the Cavern Club on February 9, 1961. Wooler would later witness the first contract offer made to the Beatles on December 3, 1961, from Brian Epstein who became the group's manager.\n\nThe Cavern Club's compère became the first writer to predict just how successful the Beatles were to become. In August, 1961, Bob Wooler wrote down this observation in the Mersey Beat edition concerning the Beatles: \"Truly a phenomenon. I dont think anything like them will ever happen again.\" Perhaps Wooler's best summation about the local success of the Beatles during that period can be found in a one catch-phrase slogan that he came up with. He declared the phenomenon of Cavern-era Beatles as being \"The Stuff That Screams Are Made Of.\"\n\nFebruary 26\n\nROYAL LINE-UP CONFIRMED FOR QUEEN'S GOLDEN JUBILEE\n\nDubbed as a 3-day \"Party At the Palace,\" it is announced that Sir Paul McCartney is scheduled to perform at the Queen's Golden Jubilee concert on June 3. Among others confirmed in the line-up are: \"Eric Clapton, Brian Wilson, Phil Collins, Aretha Franklin, Queen, S Club 7, Tom Jones and Pop Idol winner, Will Young,\" writes a Dotmusic.com news source.\n\nAnd in a much later report filed by Ananova.com on May 17, revealed that Sir Paul McCartney \"plans cheeky song for the Queen. The star will perform The Beatles song Her Majesty - originally a hidden track at the end of the Abbey Road album.\"\n\nSir George Martin who was chosen as musical director for the entire jubilee (including a \"classical tribute\" slated in the program for June 1st) made the following comment: \"The artists today represent the greatest composers and performers of their generation.\"\n\n\"Thousands will relish the chance to see them perform together live on stage at Buckingham Palace.\"\n\nHe added: \"No country has a finer tradition in producing great talent than ours, and we should be very proud of the enormous contribution that British artists and composers have made to the world of entertainment over the last fifty years.\"\n\nIt was decided that 24,000 tickets be made available to the general public for the Queen's Golden Jubilee. The tickets were distributed evenly in the following regions: all of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Isles and the Isle of Man.\n\nMarch 4\n\nPAUL McCARTNEY TO WED\n\nThe Daily Post reports that Sir Paul McCartney announced yesterday that he will marry his 34-year-old fiancée Heather Mills during the month of June.\n\nWhile the wedding location was to be kept secret from the media, the Daily Post article did find out what kind of wedding dress the bride-to-be was planning to wear: \"Heather has already decided on a off-white Chantilly lace and silk traditional wedding dress with a corset-style bodice, veil and train.\" The Daily Post also mentioned that Heather was \"adamant to design the dress herself.\"\n\nBEATLES PHOTOGRAPHER HERBERT DIES AGE 89\n\nEmma Gunby of Liverpool Echo, writes: \"One of the Beatle's first official photographers has died.\n\n\"Herbert Hughes, 89, from Birkenhead, was employed by the Fab Four's manager Brian Epstein to take a photo of the band on December 17, 1961.\"\n\nMarch 14\n\nYOKO ONO BUYS JOHN LENNON'S CHILDHOOD HOME\n\nIn a C.B.C.
