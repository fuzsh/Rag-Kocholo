        "text": "Parking for Floaters:\n\nPark & Float is open for summer June 22 - Sept. 2. Contact Tumalo Creek for rental opportunities, weather-permitting, until June 22.\n\nPark & Float is at Simpson Ave. and Bradbury Way, across from The Pavilion at 1000 SW Bradbury Way, and has free parking, rental services, access to the river shuttle and more. It’s a convenient one-stop location for a day of river fun. Shuttle rides have a $5 fee.\n\nParking Options:\n\nPark & Float location at Simpson Ave. and Bradbury Way, across from The Pavilion at 1000 SW Bradbury Way. One block south of the whitewater park. (Directions)\n\nRiverbend Park, 799 SW Columbia St. (westside) (Directions)\n\nMcKay Park, 166 SW Shevlin Hixon Dr. (westside) (Directions)\n\nMiller’s Landing Park, 80 NW Riverside Blvd. (eastside) (Directions)\n\nRide the River shuttle service:\n\nThe Ride the River shuttle starts and ends at Park & Float, beginning June 22 (weather permitting) and ending on Labor Day. Round trip makes transportation easy for river users with shuttles departing every 15-20 minutes from 11 am to 7 pm. Advanced tickets available at Tumalo Creek Kayak & Canoe. Reservations for 2024 season are available now. On your reservation date, check-in at Park & Float for the wrist band valid the entire day.\n\nParking is available at Riverbend Park, Farewell Bend Park, Miller’s Landing Park and Park & Float (across from The Pavilion). It’s only a block away from McKay Park and about a one-mile walk to Riverbend Park. Please respect neighborhoods, businesses and parking time limits.\n\nWe don’t recommend parking at Riverbend Park, floating to Drake Park and then walking back. It’s an option, but the walk back will be about two miles. A better option is parking in “the middle” across from The Pavilion and splitting the walk up to one mile before and one mile after instead.\n\nWe also don’t suggest shuttling vehicles as parking is extremely limited and may not even be available in the area by Riverbend Park and/or Drake Park. There is also a new neighborhood parking permit required."
