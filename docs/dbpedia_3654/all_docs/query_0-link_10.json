Running Time: 99 Minutes TECHNICOLOR® 25% Page 6 [Mat IA; Still No. 17) Jerry Lewis, as a fast-buck operator in London, wonders why his wife is angry when all he did was turn their home into a Chinese discotheque! It's a scene from \"Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,’ Columbia release in Technicolor. Terry-Thomas a AS Terry-Thomas, the gap-toothed, lightly-mustached British comedian, proves an invaluable comic foil to the exuberant Jerry Lewis in “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,” a Co- lumbia Pictures release in Technicolor now at the ...... Theatre. Co-starred in the Walter Shennon production are Jacqueline Pearce and Bernard Crib- bins. Terry-Thomas plays a_ fast-buck character with gold-lined dreams of fantastic financial success. Once regarded as typically English in his approach to humor, Terry- Thomas found the turning point in his career that set him on the road to becoming an international star with “Private’s Progress.” Since then the comedian has appeared in “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,” “Those Mag- nificent Men in Their Flying Machines” and “Guide to a Married Man.” Walter Shenson produced and Jerry Paris directed “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,’ from Max Wilk’s screenplay based on his novel of the same name. Bernard Cribbins ee ee ee eee ae ee Bernard Cribbins has one of those nondescript faces that seems to blend into the scenery. Yet without him, stars like Jerry Lewis, whose current vehicle, ““Don’t Raise the Bridge, Low- er the River,” is now at the ........ Theatre in Technicolor, would have more difficulty in shining so brilliant- ly. It is by playing against an actor like Cribbins, with both feet solidly on the ground, that Jerry is better able to project his antic personality on the screen. Jacqueline Pearce and Terry- Thomas also co-star with Lewis in the new Columbia Pictures release, a Walt- er Shenson production. At 14, Cribbins was a student with the Oldham Repertory Company in Lancashire, England. His first part in London’s West End was in a musical version of the “Comedy of Errors,” the dual role of the twin Dromios. Two more musicals followed and then Crib- bins branched out into television. Be- sides appearing in such successful films as “Wrong Arm of the Law” and Jerry Lewis oe Jerry Lewis recently went to Lon- don on holiday. The happy result is “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,” the Colum- bia Pictures release at the ....Theatre in Technicolor. A Walter Shenson pro- duction directed by Jerry Paris, “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River” was filmed from a screenplay by Max Wilk about an American operator whose’ grandiose get - rich - quick schemes keep him in constant hot water with his British wife, his friends, his enemies ... and with girls. The names are important, not only in their own right, but because they meant that Lewis could concentrate happily on the frenetic type of comedy for which he is most famous. He could enjoy himself acting, and let the be- hind-the-scenes problems be taken care of by others instead of, as he had been doing in recent years, by Lewis him- self. Instead of “producer” Jerry Lewis, there was Shenson who had made the fantastic Beatles’ pictures. Instead of “director” Jerry Lewis, there was Paris, who had directed many of the Dick Van Dyke television shows. In- stead of “writer” Jerry Lewis, there was Wilk who also was author of the popular novel on which the film is based. And, of course, instead of his pre- vious hectic pre- and current produc- tion activities, there was comedian Jerry Lewis alone, a name and a talent to conjure with. “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River’ is considered by the star his most rambunctious per- formance in years. Incidentally, during one month’s shooting of “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,” 17 hours of television programming in England, France, Western Germany, Italy and the Neth- erlands were devoted to star Jerry Lewis as performer, director or on the French Riviera, where he attended the Cannes Film Festival. : Included was a 90-minute TV spe- cial, “Great Directors of Our Time,” a show which has featured such di- rectors as John Ford, Jean. Renoir and Roberto Rossellini. The BBC show- cased Lewis’ talents in two one-hour shows. Titled “The Movies,” the pro- gram delved extensively into the his- tory of his earlier films and into his later career as a movie quadruple threat—actor, writer, producer and di- rector. Lewis also was invited to lec- ture at the Royal College of Art. nn Mat 2A; Still No. 80) A gun is the last thing Jerry Lewis needs or wants in this scene from \"Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,’ in which he plays an American operator trying to make a buck in England. The Columbia Pictures release in Technicolor co-stars Bernard Cribbins, left, Terry-Thomas and Jacqueline Pearce. \"Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River'' was produced by Walter Shenson and directed by Jerry Paris. (Mat 2B; till No. 51) While she's breakfasting in bed, and talking on the phone to her new boy friend, is no time for a husband to try to win back an estranged wife! But no one can blame Jerry Lewis for trying, in \"Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,’ when the girl is lovely Jacqueline Pearce. Others in the cast of the Columbia Pictures release in Technicolor are Terry-Thomas and (Mat 1B; Still No. 57) Jerry Lewis stars and lovely Jacqueline Pearce co-stars in Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,’ new Columbia Pictures release in Technicolor. The made-in-England comedy also co-stars Terry-Thomas and Bernard Cribbins. Jacqueline Pearce SSS Pixie-faced Jacqueline Pearce, who has the looks and appeal of a young Audrey Hepburn, was selected from scores of candidates to play Jerry Lewis’ leading lady in “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,’ Columbia Pictures release in Technicolor at the 5 Sethi: « Theatre. Also co-starred with Lewis in the Walter Shenson produc- tion are Terry-Thomas and Bernard Cribbins. Jacqueline was auditioned to play Jerry’s estranged wife on a Wednes- day, screen-tested on Thursday, signed to a contract on Friday—and played a love scene with Jerry for her first scenes on the following Monday. On Tuesday, they quarreled, for the cam- eras, of course. Miss Pearce was educated at the Maris Convent at Byfleet, England. Even at 16, she was nearly expelled from school when she shocked the sedate sisters there by performing, with another girl, an outspoken scene from John Osborne’s “Look Back in Anger.” Only the fact that the pair won awards for their performance, prevented instant dismissal. Made In London For the first time in 18 years, co- median Jerry Lewis stars in a motion picture away from Hollywood. London is the setting for Walter Shenson’s production of “Don’t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River,’ Columbia Pictures release in Technicolor now at the eres Theatre.
