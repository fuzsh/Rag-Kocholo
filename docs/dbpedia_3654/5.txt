Movie plot tags

A man, threatened with divorce by his wife, retreats into daydreams of adventure and excitement. With the aid of a con man, he plots to steal the plans for a valuable new invention, a high-speed oil drill, and peddle the plans to oil-rich Arabs. This spoofing of spy-thrillers continues with the inevitable hidden microfilm, high-speed chases through Lisbon, a sinister double-crossing dentist.
