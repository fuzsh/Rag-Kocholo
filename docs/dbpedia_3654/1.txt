American writer and producer of publicity shorts from 1941 who served as the London-based supervisor of Columbia European productions beginning in 1955. Shenson went on to make his mark as a producer (usually of comedies), hitting pay dirt with the farcical, "The Mouse that Roared" (1959), and two Beatles romps, "A Hard Day's Night" (1964), and "Help!" (1965). He made an unsuccessful directorial effort, "Welcome to the Club" (1971), and orchestrated the witty "Reuben Reuben" (1983).
