        "text": "back to the phenomenon of the moment!\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe world of comics has undergone a major revolution in recent years with the rise of the webtoon, a form of digital comic originating from Korea. Unlike traditional manga, the webtoon is in color and is specifically designed to be read on screens, especially smartphones. This innovation has not only changed the lives of readers but has also shaken up the comic industry worldwide.\n\nBorn in South Korea, these digital comics quickly found their place in the French publishing landscape, offering a unique reading experience tailored to the digital age. By scrolling through images on their smartphone screens, readers can devour entire episodes in no time. This ease of access, combined with the richness of Korean culture and history, has made the webtoon a global phenomenon.\n\nThe influence of hallyu, or the Korean cultural wave, has played a crucial role in the rising popularity of webtoons. With giants like Naver, which claims two million unique users per month in France and one hundred and eighty million active monthly users worldwide, it's clear that the webtoon is far more than just a passing trend.\n\nBut what makes the webtoon so special? Is it simply a digital version of traditional manga, or does it bring something new to the table? And why are so many readers around the world so passionate about this format? In this article, we will explore the meteoric rise of the webtoon, from its origins in Korea to its impact in the world of comics, and discover why this format has become a must-read for so many.\n\nWhat is a Webtoon?\n\nA webtoon is a form of digital comic that originated in South Korea, designed primarily for reading on smartphones and tablets. This media form has experienced exponential growth, not only in South Korea but also internationally, rivaling traditional Japanese mangas.\n\nOrigin and Development\n\nThe term \"webtoon\" is derived from the combination of the words \"web\" and \"cartoon.\" In Korean, it's referred to as \"웹툰\". Historically, the Korean web portal Daum launched a webtoon service in 2003, closely followed by Naver in 2004. These platforms regularly publish webtoons, which are often available for free to readers. Due to their accessibility and format tailored for mobile devices, webtoons quickly gained popularity.\n\nCharacteristics of Webtoons\n\nUnlike traditional comics that are structured in pages, webtoons are typically formatted in long vertical scrolls, allowing for smooth reading by scrolling the screen. This vertical layout is suited for a progressive and continuous portrayal, making reading a webtoon more immersive.\n\nWith the advancement of technology, webtoons have also incorporated interactive elements such as flash animations and sound effects. Moreover, with the advent of smartphones and tablets, webtoons migrated to new platforms, including dedicated apps.\n\nPopularity and International Expansion\n\nOver the years, webtoons have gained popularity in Western markets. In July 2014, Naver's subsidiary, Line, began publishing English translations of popular webtoons via the Line Webtoon service. Additionally, the webtoon market was valued at 420 billion won (approximately 316 million euros) by the end of 2015.\n\nOne of the reasons for this growing popularity is the easy access to webtoons, most being free or low-cost compared to traditional printed comics. Furthermore, the digital nature of webtoons allows for rapid global distribution, leading to swift expansion in international markets.\n\nThe History of Webtoon:\n\nFrom Korea to the World The webtoon, this digital comic format, originated in South Korea. Initially designed for online reading, it has captured the hearts of millions of readers worldwide. But how did this phenomenon come about, and how did it manage to spread beyond Korean borders?\n\nThe Early Days in South Korea\n\nThe term used to refer to comics in South Korea is \"manhwa\". However, while South Korean comics were long overshadowed by Japanese creations, a significant shift occurred in the early 2000s. Visionary entrepreneurs saw the potential of digital and decided to breathe new life into manhwa. Thus, the webtoon was born, tailored specifically for screens. These comics, designed to be read from top to bottom by scrolling on a smartphone, experienced meteoric success in South Korea, generating revenues of 480 million euros in 2019.\n\nInternational Expansion\n\nThe enthusiasm for this format wasn't limited to Korea. In France, for instance, the platform Delitoon, launched in 2011, was a webtoon pioneer. While the majority of its catalog consisted of Korean series translated into French, Chinese, Japanese, and even European works began to emerge. Among them, the French series \"Lastman\", which was later adapted into an anime on Netflix in 2016.\n\nIn 2019, Naver, the South Korean web giant, launched its French version, Webtoon. In just two years, it attracted over a million readers. Other \"historical\" French publishers, like Dupuis, also invested in this market. In January 2021, Delcourt editions launched their platform Verytoon, offering exclusively South Korean creations.\n\nThe Impact of Media and Growing Popularity\n\nThe media's impact was pivotal in popularizing the webtoon. Numerous series were adapted into animated series, like \"Tower of God\" or \"The God of High School\", both released in 2020. Others, like \"What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim\" or \"Itaewon Class\", were adapted into TV series. These adaptations played a vital role in highlighting the webtoon on the international stage.\n\nWebtoon in France\n\nAlthough of South Korean origin, the webtoon has found a particular resonance in France. This digital comic format, adapted for smooth reading on screens, has captivated a wide French audience, ranging from teenagers to adults. But how did this Asian phenomenon manage to establish itself in France?\n\nThe Arrival of Webtoons in France\n\nThe first platform to introduce the webtoon in France was Delitoon, launched in 2011. Although the majority of its catalog consists of translated Korean series, it paved the way for other creations, including European ones. In 2019, Naver, the South Korean web giant, launched its French version, attracting over a million readers in just two years. Other players, such as Toomics, Piccoma, Tappytoon, Ono, Alskreen, and Delitoon, also entered the French market. Unfortunately, Verytoon, one of the major players, announced the closure of its site in 2023.\n\nMost Popular French Webtoons\n\nAmong the French webtoons that have made an impression are \"The Eternal Rose\", a fantasy romance, \"The Secret of Angels\", blending mystery and the supernatural, \"Without Limits\", an action series with superheroes, and \"Life in Colors\", a romantic comedy. These series have received numerous positive reviews, especially from young readers aged 15 to 25.\n\nAdaptation of Foreign Webtoons\n\nThe bulk of the French catalog, however, consists of adaptations of Asian or English-speaking webtoons. These translations allow French readers to discover captivating stories while enjoying a reading experience adapted to their native language.\n\nWhy Such Enthusiasm?\n\nOne of the main reasons for the popularity of webtoons in France is their accessibility. Most platforms offer free webtoons with regular updates. Moreover, online reading offers an interactive experience. Readers can not only appreciate the drawings and the plot but also interact with the creators and other fans through comments and discussion forums.\n\nWhat the Webtoon Format Brings Anew\n\nThe world of comics has undergone many evolutions over the decades. From the first printed volumes to Japanese mangas, each culture has contributed to the medium. However, the arrival of South Korean webtoons marked a decisive turning point in the history of comics. What makes this format so unique and innovative?\n\nA Reading Experience Suited for the Digital Age\n\nUnlike traditional comics that are divided into pages, the webtoon is designed for vertical reading, scrolling the screen from top to bottom. This adaptation is perfectly suited to the smartphone culture that dominates our era. The colorful images, often accompanied by soundtracks, offer total immersion, turning each episode into a genuine experience.\n\nInteraction with the Community\n\nOne of the most innovative aspects of webtoons is the ability for readers to leave comments directly under the episodes. This direct interaction between authors and readers creates a tight-knit community around each series. Real-time feedback allows creators to adapt, adjust their narrative, or respond to their audience's questions.\n\nAn Innovative Economic Model\n\nMost webtoon platforms offer the first chapters for free, thus encouraging new readers to discover new series. Once hooked, they can choose to pay to access the following chapters or wait for their free publication at a rate of one episode per week. This economic model, combined with advertising, has generated impressive revenue, especially in South Korea, where it reached 480 million euros in 2019.\n\nA Diversity of Genres and Styles\n\nWebtoons are not limited to one genre or style. From romance to action, through fantasy or comedy, there's something for everyone. Moreover, with the entry barrier being lower than for traditional publications, many independent authors have the opportunity to share their stories, thus enriching the comic culture with new voices and perspectives.\n\nWhy is the Webtoon So Popular?\n\nThe webtoon, this digital comic originating from South Korea, has won the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. But what makes this format so irresistible to so many? Let's dive into the reasons for its growing popularity.\n\nAdaptation to Digital Culture\n\nWebtoons are designed for vertical reading, perfectly suited for smartphones. This approach caters to the habits of mobile device users, especially Generation Z and millennials who make up more than 75% of the webtoon market. Adapting to digital culture has been a key factor in their success.\n\nAn Attractive Economic Model\n\nWebtoon platforms, such as LINE WEBTOON, often offer the first chapters for free, allowing new fans to discover new series without any initial financial commitment. This economic model, where fans can choose to pay to access additional chapters or wait for their free release, has proven its effectiveness, especially in South Korea.\n\nInteractivity and Engagement\n\nThe interaction between authors and their fans is another distinctive element of webtoons. Platforms provide a discussion space under each chapter, allowing fans to share their opinions, appreciations, and emotions. This interactivity strengthens the bond between creators and their audience, creating a tight-knit community around each series.\n\nDiversity of Content\n\nWebtoons cover a wide range of genres, offering diversity that caters to the varied tastes of fans. From romance to action, through fantasy, there's a webtoon for every reader. This diversity is enhanced by platforms opening up to authors from all over the world, thus enriching the culture of digital comics.\n\nThe Biggest Webtoon Hits\n\nThe world of digital comics, or webtoons, has seen many titles emerge that have captivated millions worldwide. These works, originating from Korea, have charmed with their originality, thematic diversity, and format suited for mobile screens. Here are some of the biggest hits that have defined this genre.\n\nDown To Earth: Kade leads a quiet life until a cute alien lands in his backyard.

Each volume unveils a new chapter, a new twist in the story, offering fans an immersive and addictive experience. Many countries have also adopted this format, attesting to its universal success.\n\nThe key to this success lies in the authors' ability to weave captivating stories, enriched by vibrant and colorful illustrations.

This format, designed for online reading, has captivated millions of enthusiasts worldwide. In Korea, the term for comics is \"manhwa\". However, while South Korean comics remained in the shadow of Japanese creations for a long time, they experienced a revival in the early 2000s thanks to visionary publishers and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe manhwa, in its digital version or webtoon, is designed to be read from top to bottom by \"scrolling\" on one's smartphone. This approach has reached a broader audience, especially the youth who are constantly connected. In 2019, webtoons generated a turnover of 480 million euros in South Korea, and their popularity extends internationally.\n\nThe craze for webtoons is not limited to Korea. In France, the Delitoon platform, launched in 2011, experienced unexpected success. Although the majority of its catalog consists of Korean series translated into French, Chinese, Japanese, and even European works have begun to emerge. The French series \"Lastman\", for example, was published by Casterman editions and adapted into an anime on Netflix in 2016.\n\nThe success of webtoons is not limited to online reading. Many comics have been adapted into animated or TV series. Titles like \"Tower of God\" or \"The God of High School\" were adapted in 2020. Others, such as \"What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim\" or \"Itaewon Class\", were turned into TV series. Some popular webtoons are even published in print in France.\n\nThis South Korean cultural phenomenon also has a community dimension. Authors often interact with their fans, and some enthusiasts voluntarily translate webtoons into other languages or imagine other stories with their favorite characters. This online interaction plays a crucial role in a title's success.\n\nIn conclusion, the webtoon has become a genuine soft power tool for South Korea, allowing the country to extend its cultural influence well beyond its borders. Thanks to this new wave of creativity, South Korea continues to assert its place as a cultural leader in the world.\n\nMaybe you want to learn how to draw your favorite manga characters?
