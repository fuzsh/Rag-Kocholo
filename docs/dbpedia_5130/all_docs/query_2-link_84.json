        "text": "The beloved Korean drama Misaeng released in 2014 is still popular today.\n\nKorean movie Along with the Gods, with Ju Jihoon, Ha Jungwoo, and many other big name actors, had a fresh storyline. This movie was a hit in Australia, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.\n\nMany people were healed and entertained by these romantic comedy dramas!\n\nDo you know what both the Kdrama Misaeng and movie Along with the Gods have in common? They both originally started as webtoons!\n\nWebtoons are becoming more popular with Koreans lately because of the quality of the work.\n\nToday we will introduce some behind facts on webtoons, and platforms you can find and read webtoons in foreign languages.\n\nKOREA WEBTOON CHARACTERISTICS\n\nMost webtoons are published on a week by week basis.\n\nIt is hard work to be a webtoon writer, you are responsible for creating 80 cuts in one week! This is a difficult task for even the most seasoned writers.\n\nHeo Youngman author of Sikgaek and Yoon Taeho author of Misaeng\n\nFor example, in the Misaeng Making Story, writer Yoon Taeho shared his perspective on making Misaeng.\n\nWriter Yoon Taeho first created the scenarios, and a rough outline of the drawings with circles and lines.\n\nThen a staff of six fill in the remaining design and details.\n\nScene from Korean webtoon Misaeng\n\nAlthough Yoon Taeho is capable of creating these webtoons on his own. He says it'll would take him more than 1 month.\n\nIf he were to produce these cuts on his own, within the week time frame, there would be a significant reduction in the quality in the story, and artwork. By splitting up the work with a staff, the quality of the story and artwork are better\n\nThis established method is a systemic way to produce a lot of webtoons.\n\nWebtoon writer Kian84 and his staff working\n\nMany fan are are aware of this system, so if webtoons are late fans believe that there is a lack of professionalism.\n\nThis is a misunderstanding created due to the lack of understanding about the creative process.\n\nHaving to produce 80 cuts a week is a huge criticism of writers, who believe this is overkill. This aspect needs to be improved in the webtoon industry.\n\nLACK OF EDITORS & MANPOWER\n\nTypically in the cartoon industry, writers have editors. But there are very few editors that can adapt to this format of rapid distribution.\n\nThe current lack of editors bring three major problems.\n\nFirst, political and social issues are not well reviewed which can lead to many controversies.\n\nSecond, writers are responsible for two roles, writing, and editing.\n\nThird, basic editor responsibilities, like proofreading, falls onto the writer.\n\nWebtoons should be edited by professionals to make for a higher quality product.\n\nTherefore, it is unrealistic to expect the writers can do all this work (create and edit) under pressing deadlines. Currently, it is difficult to have an editor in charge of all the works.\n\nAlso, the industry does not have enough fund to employ editors for each individual piece.\n\nThis process makes it difficult for webtoons to become mega hits.\n\nIf you look at webtoons that have been published for a long time, you start to notice a decrease in the power of the writing and art work.\n\nMost of the long-term webtoons in Korea tend to have this drop-off due to work fatigue of the editorial department.\n\nONE SOURCE MULTI-USE (OSMU)\n\nKang Full's webtoon The Neighbor, and movie adaptation of The Neighbor\n\nKorean webtoons are now being adapted for dramas and movies due to their recent rise in quality and popularity.\n\nIt mainly began in 2000 with Korean webtoon writer Kang Full. He has written webtoons for 26 years, and many have been adapted to movies such as The Neighbor.\n\nSince then, there has been a boom in popularity of Korean webtoons since 2012, so more and more webtoons have been adapted to dramas and movies.\n\nAlong with the Gods webtoon and movie adaptation\n\nOne of the more popular webtoons is Along with the Gods, written by Joo Homin.\n\nThe first episode titled \"Sin and Punishment\" reached over 14 million viewers. Subsequent episodes maintained about 10 million viewers.\n\nExtraordinary You, webtoon turned drama in 2019.\n\nMany dramatizations of Korean webtoons began in 2010. Webtoons like Misaeng, True Beauty, Extraordinary You, Itaewon Class, and Cheese in the Trap are now also popular Korean dramas.\n\nThe Remarried Empress Korean webtoon based on a web novel\n\nAlso, since 2010, more webtoons have been based off web novels so they would be easier to adapt to dramas.\n\nWebtoons currently being released on Naver (WEBTOON, Line Manga) such as Tower of God, The God of High School, and Noblesse are going to be animated for Japanese TV.\n\nNaver Webtoon expresses hope that the one source multi use format will continue to gain momentum in the future.\n\nKOREAN WEBTOON MARKET ISSUES\n\nBelow we will outline some issues surrounding the webtoon industry.\n\nUNFAIR CONTRACTS\n\nThere are various webtoon platforms in Korea, each with different genres, and classes, but it seems that this system is out of date.\n\nAgencies (webtoon distributors) charge fees, then keep the additional profits.\n\nFor example, agency contracts will include a term that writers are to release 90% of their profits to the agency.\n\nIt has been three years since this controversy arose, but it still remains as a huge problem that writers are often exploited through unfair contracts.\n\nPIRACY\n\nPiracy has been a huge rising issue.\n\nIf left unchecked, this issue could completely decimate the Korean webtoon industry.\n\nWith the rise of Korean webtoons in other countries, there have been many sites that illegally distribute translated Korean webtoons.\n\nThe profits from these translated works do not return to the original author.\n\nIt is almost impossible to block sites that share Korean webtoons illegally. Since these sites are connected to the original webtoon site, it is difficult to remove the illegal webtoon without effecting the original webtoon.\n\nSince 2018 there were about 90 sites that distribute Korean webtoons illegally. This number has continued to rise.\n\nRecently there are sites that offer Korean webtoons in English, Taiwanese, and Japanese. We recommend using the sites below!\n\nKOREAN WEBTOONS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES\n\nBelow we will introduce some platforms available globally to read Korean webtoons in a different language!\n\nWEBTOON & LINE MANGA\n\nWEBTOON (Line Manga) is operated through Korea's primary search engine, Naver (Korean version of Google).\n\nThis platform supports six languages; English, Taiwanese, Indonesian, Spanish, French, and Thai.
