        "text": "Perhaps you noticed the brush of graphics that floated onto the screen every now and then in Netflix’s joyous queer drama Heartstopper. And how the cells in Yumi’s Cells are faithfully animated throughout both seasons of the psychological romance. Or the strange yet magical way the K-drama romcom Business Proposal first unveiled its starry lead: a suave, sharp man slowly glides through the halls of an airport, only he’s fully animated unlike the rest of the passersby surrounding him. To the uninitiated, the instantly memorable introduction for the latter might simply read as a visual metaphor for his supposedly stunning visuals (you’re not wrong), but for those in the know, this was also a welcome and gratuitous homage to the source material: a webtoon or manhwa of the same name.\n\nHeartstopper and Business Proposal both join a number of many other dramas—mostly in the South Korean entertainment space—that are based on said webtoons, perhaps more easily referred to as animated comics. Rather than the superhero-led scene of the comic universe in Hollywood—think Marvel or DC Comics—these manhwas are more closely paralleled to indie comics or the vast animated world of Japanese animes.\n\nNot only do webtoons span endless genres, they are also formatted to be read like a dream; in full colour (much unlike Japanese manga in this sense), a miasmic variety of alternative art styles and attuned to the intuitive motion of scrolling from top to bottom on our mobile devices. Considering most of these webtoons first stemmed from countries such as China and South Korea, a huge chunk of them are also reflective of East Asian cultures and histories. Take for instance, My Roommate is a Gumiho—now also a popular K-drama—that melds romance and Korean folklore into its plot.\n\nWith the sheer breadth of creative material popping up in this space, it only stands to reason that an increasing number of directors and production houses are seeing the value in adapting these presently available narratives for the TV screen. Unbeknownst to many, some of the hottest Korean dramas in the past few years alone have actually been based on ongoing or completed webtoons. We’ll flip through the catalogue for you: simply recall the likes of thriller-horrors Sweet Home, All Of Us Are Dead, Hellbound and romance favourites My ID is Gangnam Beauty, True Beauty and Business Proposal. Or perhaps the most recent offerings in the K-drama space might be of notable mention; think Choi Woo-shik’s recent delivery in A Killer Paradox, Yang Se-jong and Bae Suzy’s cosmic team-up in Doona! or the superhero venture of Disney+’s Moving starring Han Hyo-joo, Ryoo Seung-ryong and Jo In-sung.\n\nAnd it doesn’t end there. In the works, a number of upcoming South Korean drama releases based on webtoons have already been timed for release—the next in line being the socio-political dram-com Pyramid Game which is currently airing, and Netflix’s The 8 Show, starring Ryu Jun-yeol, timed for a May release. Whilst a slew of others have been confirmed for production, and stand to benefit from some extremely smart casting decisions in the K-drama space. Below, spy a shortlist of the most exciting Korean webtoon-based drama adaptations to look out for no matter what genre enthusiast you are, with source material that boast stunning panels of visuals; captivating storylines and intriguing main characters to get acquainted with."
