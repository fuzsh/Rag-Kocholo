        "text": "This thesis conducts a form analysis of the webtoon Annarasumanara, created by Ha Il Kwon and originally released in 2010. The thesis examines this webtoon from multiple directions: as a new form of graphic narrative emerging from developments in digital technology and its powerful use of digital image production, synthesizing digital photography with cartoon art; as a historical narrative of post-IMF Korean everydayness; and as a digital pop culture commodity within the flourishing Korean media industry. This form analysis will highlight Annarasumanara as a piece of art performing a powerful critique of capitalism that particularly speaks to the contemporary South Korean context. However, it must be read as emerging from, and embedded within, an industry that is organized through the relationships of capital. This contradiction culminates in the translation of Annarasumanara, in which its critique of capitalism is filtered through a process of commodification aimed at export to for...\n\nAbstract: Digital supremacy is ruling the present era in every aspect and our reading experience is also changing day by day. Now readers are not pivoted on printed pages only; rather they are relying more on their smart phones, laptops, computers etc. as every kind of books are now available in these devices. Like other genres, comics are also available in digital forms just to become a companion to the readers in their digital journey. With the evolving digital revolution, comics have taken less time to adopt the digital forms than any other genre of literature. The fact is that readers can enjoy the best reading experience of comics when the genre includes multimedia. Comics have gone one step further and offer its various digital forms so that the readers can enjoy many varieties. Hence there are many interesting forms of digital comics like web comics, web manhua, web manga, webtoons, motion comics etc. This paper is a detailed analysis of the history of digital comics and is a critique of its various forms.\n\nThis essay examines the global expansion of the webtoon-anime phenomenon that has quickly become mainstreamed by the 2020 partnership between the American anime streaming giant, Crunchyroll, and the South Korean webtoon platform, Naver-Line Webtoon. Marked specifically by the global simulcasts of the anime adaptations of SIU’s Tower of God (Sin-ui Tap, 2020) and Park Yongje’s The God of High School (Gat Obeu Hai Seukul, 2020), the explosion of webtoon-anime adaptations—conveniently marketed alongside what the streaming service describes as “Crunchyroll Originals”—indicates yet another fraught flashpoint within the tensely bound networks of South Korean creators, Japanese producers, American distributors, and global fans. From a critical Marxian and post-Deleuzian reassessment of the webtoon-anime media ecology through these three texts, this chapter examines what Brian Yecies, Aegyung Shim, Jack (Jie) Yang, and Peter Yong Zhong describe as the emergence of the “Korean Digital Wave” and Naver-Line Webtoon’s “webtoon IP-engine\" alongside the works of world film scholars like David Martin-Jones JungBong Choi, and Robert Stam to postulate how the current post-global philosophical troubles of the digital expanse have upended tidy discourses of translinguistic, transnational, and transcultural participatory culture, squarely reestablishing the ideological and transmedial frameworks of these webtoon series. By reading the popular work of South Korean webtoonists SIU and Park alongside an aesthetic and ontological examination of scrolling, screens, and streams, this chapter hopes to explore the philosophical potentials and limitations of their Crunchyroll anime adaptations, and further express a serious interrogation of the emergent webtoon-anime assemblage.\n\nThe Japanese comic industry (popularly referred as manga industry) showed a remarkable growth on the second part of the XXth century. Even with the appearance of new media like T.V. and video games, the manga industry notoriously outgrew other international comic markets. Even now, with the saturation of digital media into the XXIst century, consumers and producers are adapting the market and maintaining its momentum online. The current research surveys the business history of the postwar Japanese comics from 1945 to 1995, roughly the growth and shakeout phases of the industry life cycle. We present the main macro economic factors, the industrial sectors change, and the social change of the Japanese entertainment markets in this period. Historical evidence suggests that the comic industry suffered a meteoric rise after the U.S. occupation. The departure of the U.S. presence in Japan not only pushed political reorganization, but had already influenced a series of policy changes that we present as the explanatory factors of the industry's growth. We present an empirical overview of the time period, putting emphasis on economic and industrial metrics (e.g. GDP, population, industry sectors shares, manga units sold, and manga market revenue). Additionally, we include the adoption of new media and comparison of their adoption during the period in the Japanese society. Before our quantitative model results, a description of the manga industrial organization is presented. We consider the previous and posterior eras (i.e. Showa era and Pacific War organization of the comic market, and a few years into the Heisei era with the popularization of the internet). After this theoretical and historical review, we present our approach using regression techniques (ARIMA models and Random Forest) to evaluate the effect of the factors on the industry's growth. Results show the relative role of economic and social factors over the growth phase of the Japanese comic industry life-cycle.\n\nIn Indonesia, comics are one of the material courses in Visual Communication Design (DKV). As one of the fields included in the Creative Industry sub-sector in BEKRAF, DKV is very different from the advances in digital technology. The current media trend has turned digital. Digital comics are available on mobile application platforms, websites and egalleries. Master the way of lovers to make comics in an interesting digital platform to study, especially to develop creativity in Indonesia. This quantitative research is based on BEKRAF data and uses in-depth interviews and questionnaires to DKV students from several Indonesian universities regarding the trend of digital comic platforms. Based on the attitude components which consist of affective, cognitive, and conative factors, student responses are expected to present recommendations to the government in formulating digital platform development policies in the creative industry. Exposure to the potential, the digital comic platform ...\n\nComics are media stories that are not specific to a particular group of readers. But in reality, comics are often regarded as mere children&#39;s reading. This raises a negative paradigm for comics, and comics are considered as reading that degrades children&#39;s morale. This article will describe the history, definition, and function of comics as storytelling media, and how the negative paradigm affects the comic industry in Indonesia. As a medium, the comic is a means to convey messages similar to television, radio, newspapers, and magazines. And similar to other media, comics can be used to convey various kinds of information, not merely intended for entertainment only. Various kinds of messages, ranging from advertorials, political propaganda, public services, even education, can all be conveyed using comic media. However, most people still believe the false paradigm that that comic is only for children. This is a misunderstanding and is not true. Since the beginning, the Indo..."
