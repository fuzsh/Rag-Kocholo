        "text": "With a lively backdrop of superheroes, comic books, and animated comics, Drawn Together: Comics, Diversity and Stereotypes brings together three talented artists—a Sikh, a woman, and an African American—who are challenging the racist stereotyping currently endemic in America through their work.\n\nThe documentary provides the rare opportunity to explore the subjects of race, gender, and religion stereotyping through the universally popular medium of comic books and cartoons. Drawn Together boldly encourages viewers to unlearn stereotyping, look beyond the obvious, and confront media prejudices—all through an uncommon and inherently engaging everyday source.\n\nExpert commentary is provided by Professor Arvind Singhal, world renowned expert in entertainment education; Andrew Farago, the curator of San Francisco’s Cartoon Art Museum; and Adam Elrashidi, a cartoonist and a producer at Al Jazeera. They share their thoughts on how to solve the problem of racist stereotyping through changing the stories being told and discuss how the three profiled artists have brought about a groundswell movement to combat the way we traditionally look at racist stereotypes.\n\nAs a woman, as a brown woman and as a brown mom I was stereotyped at various levels. Some blatant, others hidden. I always wanted to make a film on this subject of stereotyping, but instead of just showcasing a problem, I wanted to showcase solutions. The concept of the film started to develop when I heard Eileen’s story whom I had recently befriended. Eileen’s struggles with gender stereotyping felt familiar, and I was instantly drawn to her story as a creator of action-based comics -a field which has only a handful of woman in creative roles. What drew me in more was comics and how their universality could connect with people across the board.\n\nWhat struck me about Keith was his easy going, sweet and gregarious nature. His work had the power to make me smile, think, and react all at the same time. While he spoke about everyday happenings and of African-Americans, it was very relatable as a person of color. The impact that his work was having was great and I wanted to capture that on cinematic lens.\n\nVish came across as a person who was unafraid of being stared at. He wanted to have a conversation with people so that maybe one person out there can change their perception of stereotyping or just how a superhero should look.\n\nWhile all three of them looked diverse at first, there was a connecting thread that bound them and that thread drew me to creating this documentary. I spent 3 years with these artists and I am grateful, above all, to have found marvelous friends. Like many others who have been inspired by their work to do more to challenge stereotyping, I have become more focused and fearless and am ready to do my bit to showcase their story and start a conversation on embracing diversity and how we are all drawn together."
