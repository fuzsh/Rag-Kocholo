Exceptions to this rule are names of filmmakers, actors, and political leaders whose spellings are known to English-­speaking readers, such as Bong Jun-­ho, Chun Doo Hwan, Im Kwon-­taek, Lee Byung-­hyun, Park Chan-­ wook, and Park Chung Hee. Whenever Korean authors’ works that have been published in English are cited, their names are presented the way that they are printed in source materials. Korean and other East Asian names appear in their native standard, with surname first (except for names printed otherwise in English-­language publications).

Led by a hardened yet charismatic criminal named Chen (Simon Yam), the gang members await the arrival of a fourth crew member, a skilled safecracker named Julie (Angelica Lee) who will play a part in a diamond heist that promises to net them millions of dollars. Once Julie arrives, the Beretta-­packing leader informs her that another gang of thieves—­a group of outsiders from overseas—­will be arriving in the former British crown colony soon, and that they will band together to steal the famed “Tear of the Sun” from a casino in Macao. Significantly, that valuable, one-­of-­a-­kind jewel was itself lifted from an exhibition in Tokyo and is currently in the possession of a Japanese woman, Madame Tiffany (Ye Su-­ jŭng). The latter character is the mistress of an underworld kingpin named Wei Hong (Ki Kuk-­sŏ), and she is carrying the “Tear of the Sun” to one of China’s two Special Administrative Regions, a former Portuguese colony that is now among the world’s most popular gambling locations. Macao thus eventually replaces Hong Kong as the site of illicit activities, a city of glitzy, kitschy excess that brings together a diverse cross-­section of locals, tourists, and transnational migrants. The previous scene, drawn from a recent example of East Asian blockbuster cinema, might remind readers of the gritty crime thrillers directed by Hong Kong action auteurs, such as Tsui Hark, John Woo, Ringo Lam, Johnnie To, 1\n\n2 • Introduction\n\nand Andrew Lau. These directors, in their own distinctive ways, have been instrumental in breathing new life into their local film industry and in providing Hollywood with grist for the remake mill, with neo-­noir dramas like City on Fire (Lóng hǔ fēng yún, 1987) and Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou, 2002) being adapted into Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Martin Scorsese’s The Departed (2006), respectively. However, the nighttime scene described in the opening paragraph comes not from a Hong Kong film, but rather from a South Korean production, an all-­star heist flick entitled The Thieves (Todukdŭl, 2012). Directed by Ch’oe Tong-­hun (Choi Dong-­hoon), this border-­crossing film is indeed redolent of the works by his Chinese predecessors, owing not only to its diverse cast (Simon Yam in particular, a fixture in Johnnie To’s Fulltime Killer [Chuen jik sat sau, 2001], PTU [2003], and Election [Hēi shè huì, 2005]), but also to its dynamic visual style. Filled with spectacularly choreographed set pieces and stunt work as well as humorous yet deadly interludes in which Chinese and Korean characters interact, Ch’oe’s commercially successful, stylistically audacious throwback to Hong Kong action cinema captured the imagination of local audiences after its theatrical release in the summer of 2012, eventually becoming South Korea’s third highest-­grossing motion picture (with 12.9 million ticket sales in the country). But it has also generated positive reviews in places as far-­flung as Jakarta, Sitges, Taipei, and Toronto, where it was shown in film festivals and multiplexes before finally making its way to the US market via DVD and Blu-­Ray distribution, giving international audiences the opportunity to see what many reviewers were calling a Korean remake of an American, rather than a Hong Kong, film. In fact, among The Thieves’ many direct homages and indirect allusions, it is Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s Eleven (2001) that tends to be singled out by many viewers as the most decisive influence on Ch’oe Tong-­hun’s stylistic and narrative choices. This intertextual connection between a big-­budget Hollywood production and a South Korean crowd-­pleaser necessarily situates the latter film in a less-­sanctified position: that of a lowly “remake” (intentional or not) that presumably “pales in comparison” to its American antecedent. And yet, by referring to Soderbergh’s film as an “originary” text, critics push to the side Ocean’s Eleven’s status as a derivative text, conveniently overlooking its own indebtedness to an earlier motion picture bearing the same title and released in 1960. Directed by the Hollywood stalwart Lewis Milestone and starring members of the famous “Rat Pack” (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop), Ocean’s 11 set the template for many of the all-­star heist films that followed it, helping to establish (along with postwar European productions such as Rififi [1955], Bob le flambeur [1956], and Big Deal on Madonna Street [I soliti ignoti, 1958]) some of the formal conventions that would be adopted and adapted by Ch’oe Tong-­hun in the process\n\nIntroduction • 3\n\nof making a Korean variant five decades later. But The Thieves is more than merely a Korean variant of a genre that has roots in Hollywood’s earliest crime pictures. Although it reproduces many of the tried-­and-­true visual tropes and narrative formulas associated with Milestone’s and Soderbergh’s caper movies (including the gathering together of co-­conspirators, the “casing” of the place to be robbed, the revealing of plot twists and unexpected setbacks, and the pitting of once-­unified group members against one another), The Thieves ultimately breaks from cinematic tradition to showcase intercultural encounters and transnational flows. Moving fluidly from one international location to another and hinging on the sometimes-­strained partnerships between Chinese and Korean characters (some of whom pretend to be Japanese), The Thieves is very “contemporary” in its cosmopolitanism—­its awareness of cultural differences and similarities among global communities as well as its eagerness to transcend national boundaries. But, as we will explain throughout this book, such awareness has been an ingrained feature of South Korean cinema since its golden years of the 1950s and 1960s, despite the country’s (clichéd) status as a “hermit kingdom” historically cut off from regional neighbors and other nations. As the latest in a long string of cultural productions concerning South Korea’s evolving status as an increasingly “connected” yet deterritorialized “imagined community” (a kind of “virtual nation” held together by mediated communication networks), this film thus crystallizes an enduring feature of the country’s cinema, which has long gravitated toward non-­Korean sites (and sights) as sources of localized discourse. The localization of heist film conventions in The Thieves is therefore tied, perhaps paradoxically, to globalizing trends within the motion picture industry and within South Korean society more generally. Tellingly, the film’s principal visual motif—­the recurring image of thieves scaling skyscrapers and other buildings by way of a wire facilitating freedom of movement yet preventing deadly falls—­is an apt metaphor of local and global connectivity. Beginning with a lengthy sequence in which a cable-­swinging cat burglar named Yenicall ( Jun Ji-­hyun [Chŏn Chi-­hyŏn]) breaks into a gallery filled with priceless artifacts, and escalating toward a climax in which another Korean character, Macao Park (Kim Yun-­sŏk), flees Chinese thugs while suspended from a similar contraption outside an apartment complex in Pusan, The Thieves offers up images of wire-­work that hint at South Korea’s figurative ties to other cultural contexts and regions, from Hong Kong to Hollywood and beyond, despite remaining tethered to local traditions that are presumably threatened by the presence of global others. The high-­flying acrobatic wire scenes in The Thieves also suggest the “escapism and voyeurism” that Kirsten Moana Thompson and other critics see as central to the heist film genre (or what is sometimes referred to as the “caper movie”). According to Thompson, “Heist films afford a powerful screen\n\n4 • Introduction\n\nFIGURE 0.1. In one of the many action scenes in The Thieves, a Korean jewel thief confronts a\n\nChinese gunman while suspended from a wire outside an apartment complex in Pusan.\n\nidentification with criminals breaking the law.” Thus, “the pleasure of watching stories about illicit worlds and transgressive individuals” is part of this genre’s appeal and perhaps one reason for its revived popularity in recent years.1 By combining the horizontality of border-­crossing movement (from Seoul to Hong Kong to Macao to Pusan) and the verticality of edifice-­scaling lawbreakers (climbing great heights as they plunge deeper into criminality), the film highlights the fluidity of identity in spaces that are themselves permeable and always shifting. But The Thieves, like other caper movies, also “encodes in story form a particular desire to elude the oppressive aspects or limitations of contemporary mass society,”2 something that makes this South Korean motion picture an especially useful case study in thinking about the utopian impulses of a nation and a citizenry pursuing new social realities that do not always gel with older value systems. As Daryl Lee states, “The genre inscribes a wish-­ fulfillment for a new social order with the express intention of breaking away from a technologically and institutionally threatening society.”3 It is possible, then, to posit genre conventions associated with the heist film (in particular the “extraordinary robbery of a formidable institution that requires careful planning and the skills of specialists”)4 as a cultural response to the challenges faced by very real social actors snared between dueling desires: the craving for change and the countervailing need for stability. If, as Lee maintains, caper movies “are part of a broader reflection about the role of film artists in consumer societies,”5 then The Thieves can be framed as a metatextual mirror of sorts. Self-­consciously, the film nods toward its many non-­Korean predecessor texts and pushes to the fore a titular fascination with thievery—­a metaphor for the act of appropriating or “lifting” elements from earlier motion pictures. Indeed, the title of Ch’oe Tong-­hun’s film reflexively comments on the predilection for pilfering apparent in the\n\nIntroduction • 5\n\nworks of other cultural producers—­globally recognized cineastes (such as the aforementioned Tarantino and Scorsese) who express a “migratory” interest in various national/regional contexts. Such “movie migrations,” we hope to explain, are the textual expressions of an extratextual phenomenon, one that maps onto broader transnational flows—­of capital, of labor, of technologies, of ideas and values—­unique to the era of rapid economic and cultural globalization. In many respects, the concept of transnationalism has been used by media scholars and cultural critics as a counterbalance to the more monolithic, homogenizing notion of globalization. According to Françoise Lionnet and Shu-­mei Shih, “The transnational designates spaces and practices acted upon by border-­crossing agents, be they dominant or marginal.”6 This differs from the logic of globalization, which “assumes a universal core or norm.” As Lionnet and Shih explain, transnationalism can be thought of as “a space of exchange and participation wherever processes of hybridization occur and where it is still possible for cultures to be produced and performed without necessary mediation by the center.”7 In recent years, the widespread circulation of contemporary South Korean films, as part of the so-­called “Korean Wave,” is significant because of the country’s peripheral status throughout the prior century—­a period when it had been dominated by Japanese and American imperial influences, in much the way that an adolescent might be subjected to an older sibling’s taunts or commands. Today’s rising tide of Korean popular culture, also known as Hallyu (the millennial inter-­Asia craze for Korean dramas, popular music, films, and celebrities, among other things),8 has contributed to enhancing cultural solidarity among peripheral nations without the “Big Brother”-­like intervention of the global cultural center (i.e. Hollywood). But it has also reintroduced the problem of the “national” in a presumably “post-­national” world, one in which geographical and political borders still exist but are said to be permeable. Until the 1980s, the commonplace understanding of a national cinema as films produced within a particular nation-­state and as expressions of a countrywide spirit had been largely accepted without challenge. Over the past three decades, however, the concepts of “the nation” and “national cinema” have been increasingly scrutinized and destabilized by such theorists as Benedict Anderson, Paul Willemen, Ernest Gellner, Eric Hobsbawm, and Andrew Higson. In 1983, Anderson famously defined the nation as an “imagined community,” one that is culturally constructed through a variety of mediating forms (including print media).9 Apart from this theoretical deconstruction of the nation by Anderson and others, geopolitical conditions of the 1980s and 1990s applied further pressure on the conceptual paradigm of the national. Those conditions include the transnational relocation of people as immigrants,\n\n6 • Introduction\n\nexiles, refugees, and guest workers; the weakening of national, economic, and cultural borders with the consolidation of regional and global markets (thanks to the World Trade Organization [WTO], the European Union [EU], the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN], the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA], etc.); and the further development of global media channels, which were opened up in heretofore unprecedented ways through satellite technologies and the Internet (materializing Marshall McLuhan’s prophesy of humanity consolidating into a “single global tribe” based on electronic interdependence).10 In the context of East Asian cinema studies, the advent of globalization and transnationalism introduced an imperative to renew outdated concepts of national cinema. When film studies was first institutionalized in North American universities in the 1960s and 1970s, such classic Japanese auteurs as Kurosawa Akira, Ozu Yasujirō, and Mizoguchi Kenji (who had been making films for decades) managed to ascend the ranks of world cinema canons after their works were held up as essentialized expressions of Japanese culture, aesthetics, and spirituality. However, other East Asian cinemas that subsequently entered the critical-­academic pantheon in the United States and beyond since the 1980s (e.g. the Fifth Generation Chinese cinema of Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou; the Taiwanese New Wave cinema of Hou Hsiao-­hsien, Edward Yang, and Tsai Ming-­liang; and the Hong Kong art cinema of Wong Kar-­wai and Stanley Kwan) cannot be fully grasped within the traditional frameworks provided by “national cinema.” As many scholars have pointed out, these East Asian cinemas are transnational on several fronts. First, upon attaining fame both locally and globally, the previously-­mentioned auteurs often pursued and acquired co-­production financing opportunities from neighboring countries, as well as from European “suppliers” (particularly France), in hopes of circumventing the political, industrial, and artistic restrictions of their countries of origin. For example, Chen Kaige’s epic The Promise (Wu ji, 2005) is a pan-­Asian co-­production involving three countries (China, Japan, and South Korea) and pairing Korean superstar Jang Dong-­g un (Chang Tong-­g ŭn) with the Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung as the leads. Second, many transnational films textually foreground the act of border-­crossing—­a movement that finds its extratextual correlative in the flow of talent and creative personnel moving “to-­and-­fro” (from country to country) as part of an ever-­decentralized production process. For example, Wong Kar-­wai’s Happy Together (Chūn guāng zhà xiè, 1997) locates and displaces a Hong Kong Chinese gay couple in Buenos Aires, while Tsai Ming-­liang’s What Time Is It There? (Ni na bian ji dian, 2001) is set in both Taipei and Paris. Ch’oe Tong-­hun’s The Thieves is simply a contemporary spin on that border-­crossing phenomenon, shuttling from one location to another with the greatest of ease. And finally, in terms of the global reception of East\n\nIntroduction • 7\n\nAsian cinema, many films emanating from Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea tend to be more popular in specialized international markets—­film festivals and art-­house theaters—­than in domestic commercial markets. The films of the internationally renowned (and steadfastly controversial) Korean auteur Kim Ki-­duk (Kim Ki-­dŏk) are exemplary with respect to this trend. For example, his meditative Buddhist fable Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter . . . and Spring (Pom yŏrŭm kaŭl kyŏul kŭrio pom, 2003) garnered 370,000 admissions in US art-­house theaters, breaking all previous box-­office records of Korean imports in North America. By contrast, that film was seen by a mere 30,000 theatergoers in its country of origin. Without wishing to “obscure the question of imbalances of power (political, economic and ideological)” that accompany global cultural exchanges,11 we wish to follow Olivia Khoo, Belinda Smaill, and Audrey Yue’s lead in positing transnationalism as a critical “methodology.” In the Introduction of their recently published book Transnational Australian Cinema: Ethics in the Asian Diasporas, Khoo, Smaill, and Yue argue that such a self-­reflective approach goes beyond the merely descriptive to address the ways in which media scholars themselves might occupy a liminal position vis-­à-­vis the local and the global. Methodologically, transnationalism assists in meeting a cinematic text on its own terms, engaging in a dialogic relationship with its form and content while resisting the fixity that comes from asserting one’s own national identity or cultural background too forcefully. Moreover, it aids in the critical unpacking of genre films—­ostensibly the most fixed and circumscribed categories of cultural production—­which are ultimately shown to be just as fluid and boundless in their solicitation of spectatorial activity as the most challenging or rigorous of art films. As Christine Gledhill explains, the cross-­border circulation of specific categories of cultural production (for instance, “the Italian development of the spaghetti Western which Clint Eastwood then [brought] back to Hollywood” in the 1960s and 1970s) attests to the destabilizing potential of film genres once they are retooled “according to different local and national-­cultural interpretations.”12 If, as Miriam Hansen has argued, Hollywood genre productions functioned as the “first global vernacular” upon the US film industry’s consolidation of power in the 1920s and 1930s (a time when the influx of immigrant populations ensured some degree of heterogeneity below the surface of what was becoming a monolithic machine of global dominance), then the international circulation of those motion pictures could be said to have informed the “horizon of expectations” that local audiences in various parts of the world bring to the viewing of non-­Hollywood films. Thus, Gledhill reminds us, “local film production is pressured to engage or differentiate itself against such expectations, maintaining Hollywood’s power of definition. In this context, Hollywood comes to stand for ‘popular culture’—­obscuring from critical view\n\n8 • Introduction\n\nthe existence of an indigenous popular culture which is similarly relegated by the artistic criteria espoused as ‘national culture.’”13 Concluding with the comment that “genericity has broken free from the master genres to create an international pool of protagonists, actions, icons, and performances, capable of multiple configurations and effects to which the genrified ‘national’ now contributes,”14 Gledhill clears a rhetorical path for our own undertaking in the following pages, which examine particular uses of cinematic traditions within the South Korean context—­a cultural-­industrial space that has grown enormously since the first motion pictures were produced in Seoul and other cities beginning in the 1920s (when such colonial-­era works as The Plighted Love under the Moon [Wǒlha ǔi maengsǒ, 1923], The Nation Border [Kukkyǒng, 1923], The Story of Chunhyang [Ch’unhyang jǒn, 1923], and Arirang [1926] were released). However, it is a space that, perhaps paradoxically, can only be fleshed out by moving outside that national context from time to time, taking into consideration the many transnational valences of genericity that have come to define “local” productions over the past several decades. With this in mind, Movie Migrations: Transnational Genre Flows and South Korean Cinema examines global genre transformations and the concept of cross-­cultural intertextuality through analyses of South Korean melodramas, literary adaptations, comedies, Westerns, historical dramas, monster movies, psychological thrillers, and multicultural films, all of which are comparatively linked to non-­Korean counterparts, from Hollywood to Japan and beyond. As the title of this volume indicates, we intend this work as a “migratory” project that focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on South Korean films—­separate yet interlocking case studies—­so as to illustrate broad, theoretical concerns about cultural flows. By doing so, we hope to bring South Korean cinema (which still remains relatively unknown in US academia, despite its growing influence in regional markets) to the forefront of recent and ongoing debates about globalization and transnationalism. We also aim to revitalize American genre studies, an area of research and critical theory that has long been attached to Hollywood as a kind of signifying nexus. Many of the major works concerning film genre—­Barry Keith Grant’s Film Genres: Theory and Criticism (1977), Thomas Schatz’s Hollywood Genres (1981), Rick Altman’s Film/Genre (1999), and Steve Neale’s Genre and Hollywood (2000)—­have neglected the question of transnational permutations, the necessarily politicized transformation of genres once they are mobilized outside of Hollywood’s dominant industrial models and narrative modes. Indeed, a full understanding of genre hybridization and textual pragmatics cannot be achieved without looking beyond US borders and examining the deterritorialized manifestations of a given category of cultural production globally. We aim to reconceive genre as a transnational, transhistorical process, one that\n\nIntroduction • 9\n\ninvolves dialogic hybridity and multiplicity beyond the institutional constraints of any one national cinema, be it American or Korean. Our conceptualization of the project is partly indebted to an essay written by Christina Klein and published in American Quarterly. In that essay, Klein poses the timely question, “Why does American Studies need to think about Korean cinema?”15 As the author argues, local transformations of Hollywood genre conventions and iconographies, as demonstrated in many of the “Hollywood-­inflected films” produced in South Korea, merit the attention of non-­Koreanists as significant indicators of the ambivalent relationship between the two nations as well as tools through which to measure the impact of US popular culture’s global circulation. Equally noteworthy is what we call the “reverse cultural flow” from South Korea to the United States and other countries (including China, India, and Japan) in recent years. This is demonstrated by over a dozen Hollywood and Bollywood remakes of Korean films in the past few years, including Mohit Suri’s Murder 2 (2011), which was inspired by Na Hong-­jin’s crime drama The Chaser (Ch’ugyŏkja, 2008), and Spike Lee’s high-­profile remake of Park Chan-­wook [Pak Ch’an-­uk]’s cult film Oldboy (Oldǔ poi, 2003), as well as the YouTube craze for the Korean rapper Psy’s “Gangnam Style” in 2012. That reversal demonstrates an increasing fragmentation of cultural hegemons in a global era. This book is divided into two main sections. The first part charts the postcolonial implications of multivalent genre flows connecting “the West” to “the East” while examining intertextual points of contact or convergence linking Classical Hollywood cinema (of the prewar and postwar eras) to Golden Age South Korean cinema (of the 1950s and 1960s). The second part of the book, comprised of four chapters and a Conclusion, continues this investigation of genre flows but expands its focus to consider the recent vogue for adaptations and remakes in an age when New Korean Cinema and Hallyu have not only gained a strong following among Western art-­house patrons but also attracted the attention of Hollywood producers and movie studios eager to cash in on that craze. Chapter One establishes a theoretical model or base for understanding South Korean cultural producers’ borrowings from Hollywood (in the form of imitations, remakes, and restylings)—­creative appropriations or moments of strategic “thievery” that we frame as examples of “transnational détournement.” Literally meaning “turning around,” détournement is a technique of cultural recycling and political resistance adopted by French Situationists in the 1960s and 1970s. South Korean Golden Age classics produced during the 1950s and 1960s often deflected the romantic excess of Hollywood melodrama by recontextualizing familiar visual tropes and star images in a realistic, postcolonial setting where desperate women could be seen selling their bodies to American GIs and unemployed veterans plotted bank robberies, as illustrated in\n\n10 • Introduction\n\nthe neorealist masterpiece The Stray Bullet (Obalt’an, 1960). This chapter will elaborate some of the cinephilic strategies of generic/textual détournement in South Korean Golden Age melodramas, comparing particular visual tropes from The Stray Bullet with their more aesthetically and ideologically idealized counterparts in Hollywood “woman’s films,” such as Waterloo Bridge (1940) and Love Is a Many-­Splendored Thing (1957). Building upon the theoretical framework established in the preceding chapter, Chapter Two is devoted to an investigation of the neglected genre of pǒnan yǒnghwa (“cross-­cultural adaption films”). Such American classics as Fox’s family melodrama Over the Hill (1931) and MGM’s aforementioned wartime “weepie” Waterloo Bridge were adapted into Korean versions entitled Over That Hill (Chǒ ǒndǒk ǔl nǒmǒsǒ, 1968) and Grief (Aesu, 1967), respectively. In these and other adaptations, the process of historical and cultural recontextualization shifts the original semantic elements across syntactic lines, altering their denotative and connotative meanings in the process.16 For example, Over That Hill resituates the Depression-­era story of the American original, thematizing the schism between rural parents and city children in an era of state-­initiated modernization, overseen by Park Chung Hee’s military government (1961–­1979). In Chapter Three we cast a net over South Korean “modernization comedies” of the 1960s, paying attention to films featuring the iconic male star of the era, Kim Sŭng-­ho, who was known as the “Emil Jannings of Korean cinema” (a reference to one of Germany’s most famous—­or infamous—­silent-­ era actors). As a subgenre of film comedy proper, the modernization comedy hinges on clashes between “modern” values (associated, problematically, with American and European customs) and “traditional” Korean values. Those two sets of values strike a delicate balance, the source of much humor in such representative films as Romance Papa (Romaensŭ ppappa, 1960), Mr. Park (Pak sŏbang, 1960), Third Rate Manager (Samdŭng kwajang, 1961), and Under the Sky of Seoul (Sŏul ŭi chibung mit, 1961). However, that sense of equilibrium ultimately tilts to one side, in favor of the newly ascendant younger generation of the postwar period, as a result of the films’ principle settings, their strong foregrounding of a rapidly urbanizing, developing society seemingly content with leaving the past behind. In modernization comedies, the emasculation of the father—­his insufficiency, meager wages, and alienation from his sons’ and daughters’ generation—­is a pretext for his ultimate obsolescence or even disappearance (a recurrent theme in Golden Age Korean cinema). Any laughter that might be generated by these comedies of the 1960s is thus “nervous,” insofar as melodramatic pathos and social consciousness permeate even the most comic situations and scenarios—­a generic marriage, we argue, that is symptomatic of a postcolonial national identity. Chapter Four explores the “Manchurian Western” genre, a transhistorical phenomenon that first emerged in the 1960s and 1970s but has been given new\n\nIntroduction • 11\n\nlife in a handful of contemporary productions, most famously Kim Jee-­woon (Kim Chi-­un)’s recent blockbuster The Good, the Bad, the Weird (Chotǔn nom, nappǔn nom, isanghan nom, 2008). Set in Manchuria during the 1920s and 1930s, and populated by members of the Korean colonial diaspora (including freedom fighters, hired guns, and peasants), South Korea’s Manchurian Westerns are unique. In addition to mixing syntactic variants of the war film, the espionage film, martial arts cinema, and the family melodrama, this most hybridized of cultural forms tends to look down the proverbial barrel not at Native Americans (Hollywood’s go-­to “bad guys”) but at another archetypal enemy—­the Japanese Imperial Army—­whose representatives often assume the antagonist position within the narrative. In addition to offering an overview of the Korean “Manchurian Western” genre, we will analyze the intertextual linkages between George Stevens’ Shane (1953) and its cross-­cultural counterpart The Man with No Home (Musukja, 1968), directed by the legendary Korean auteur Shin Sang-­ok (Sin Sang-­ok). Through scene-­by-­scene comparisons, we address generic hybridity of the latter text, which blends American Western conventions with Korean melodramatic sentiments. Toward the latter part of the chapter, we investigate how Kim Jee-­woon’s aforementioned The Good, the Bad, the Weird further dilutes conventions of the American Western genre not only by harnessing iconography associated with South Korea’s Golden Age productions of the 1960s but also by borrowing from another “bastardized” form of the genre: the Italian spaghetti Western. Taking a cue from its title, we address the “weird” manner in which Kim’s film depoliticizes the Manchurian Western’s anti-­colonial content to cater to a broad demographic of younger audiences throughout the world. Chapter Five continues our shift toward more contemporary productions, and centers on E. J-­Yong (Yi Jae-­yong)’s Untold Scandal (Sŭk’aendŭl: Chosŏn namnyŏ sangyŏljisa, 2003). This unique cross-­cultural adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos’s 1782 novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons) had been adapted for the big screen several times in Europe and America. As the first Asian adaptation, Untold Scandal is the most interesting as a site of cultural convergence, creatively recontextualizing the original tale by resituating it within Korea’s late Chosŏn period (during the King Chŏngjo era [1776–­ 1800]). A major migratory break from Untold Scandal’s source material comes at the point of the Korean film’s narrative closure, with the actions of the three romanticized lead characters (Valmont, Marquise de Merteuil, and Madame de Tourvel) departing from the original novel’s moralistic ending—­a departure as fascinating as director-­writer E. J-­yong’s decision to incorporate baroque-­style chamber music (rather than traditional indigenous tunes) as the sonic backdrop for this most unusual example of sagŭk (historical dramas). These issues, as well as the specific appeals that Untold Scandal holds for different spectators (including fans of Bae Yong-­joon [Pae Yong-­jun], star of the\n\n12 • Introduction\n\nKorean Wave drama Winter Sonata [Kyŏul yŏnga, 2002], which had become a cult sensation in Japan only a few months prior to this film’s theatrical release), will be broached in this chapter, which not only charts out the genealogy of the historical drama in South Korean cinema but also points toward the crucial role that Untold Scandal played in the genre’s recent revival in the domestic market. While striving to historicize South Korean filmmakers’ adoption and subversion of Hollywood genre conventions in the geopolitical context of the Cold War (a period in which US hegemony swept through the Korean peninsula, in ways both obvious and not-­so-­obvious), our volume will also investigate another important postcolonial relationship: that between Japan and Korea. In Chapter Six we compare and contrast two significant monster movies—­one Japanese, the other Korean—­that share thematic concerns despite a significant temporal gap separating them. After summarizing the rich history of kaijū eiga sparked by the theatrical release of the original Godzilla (Gojira, 1954), we discuss the critical tendency to assign allegorical meanings to those texts, through symptomatic readings that reveal the metaphorical suggestiveness of the movies as well as the monsters within them. That tendency is also on view in the many written commentaries surrounding director Bong Joon-­ho (Pong Chun-­ho)’s The Host (Goemul [Koemul], 2006), a Korean variation on the earlier Japanese creature feature that is simultaneously unique and derivative. Unlike the semiotically overloaded title monster in director Honda Ishirō’s Godzilla (which has been said to represent, in its singular form, the horrors and anxieties of the nuclear age, in particular the threat of the atomic bomb that was prevalent throughout the immediate postwar period), the misshapen creature at the heart of The Host is hard to pin down—­a literally slippery signifier that squirms away from many critics’ grasp. And yet, while it is a closer approximation of what Maria Beville and other horror film scholars might call an “unknowable” or “unnameable” monster, that Thing has been rendered “knowable” and “nameable” through a kind of critical consensus among local (Korean) reviewers, who see its “thingness” as a visual representation of the otherwise unrepresentable horrors associated with the nation’s tumultuous past (particularly the period of mass protests known as the minjung era of the 1980s). Another kind of “monster” is on view in director Park Chan-­wook’s award-­ winning film Oldboy, the title character of which becomes, according to Kyung Hyun Kim, “larger-­than-­life” after gaining “superhuman agility and strength” while living in captivity as a mysteriously imprisoned salaryman.17 Seeking revenge for his incarceration as well as the death of his wife, Oh Dae-­su [O Tae­su] moves from one extreme to another. That word—­“extreme”—­is significant, insofar as Oldboy has been seen as one of the progenitors of the “Asian Extreme” cinema craze among Western fanboys and cinephiles, especially following the\n\nIntroduction • 13\n\nfilm’s Grand Prix win at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival and the praise heaped upon it by the festival’s Jury President, Quentin Tarantino. Since that time, “extreme cinema” has been used as an umbrella term referring to a variety of films characterized by exploitative or sensationalistic use of sex, violence, and horror/terror. The UK-­based Tartan Films (now Palisades Tartan based in the United States) launched the popular “Asia Extreme” brand in 2002 and subsequently distributed numerous Asian horror films, thrillers, and erotica (including Park Chan-­wook’s celebrated “Vengeance Trilogy,” Kim Jee-­woon’s A Tale of Two Sisters [Changhwa, Hyongryŏn, 2003], and Japanese auteur Miike Takashi’s Audition [Odishon, 1999]) to British and American markets. Park’s 2003 cult sensation Oldboy is certainly a part of that phenomenon, but its abduction and detention narrative makes it a much more profound statement about, or at least allegorical evocation of, the US War on Terror and the CIA’s practice of extraordinary rendition. Although the history of rendition (the extra-­legal transfer of a detainee to the United States or a foreign government) dates back to 1886, its modern incarnation date can be traced to 1986, when Ronald Reagan authorized renditions to the United States of criminal suspects, but only from locations where the US government is unable to attain custody through normal extradition process. The Clinton administration also practiced renditions of terrorist suspects into the United States for criminal prosecution. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the scope and number of renditions expanded significantly to include transfers to third countries for sole purposes of detention and interrogation (with prospects of torture). Within days of 9/11, the Bush administration granted authority to the CIA to conduct these “extraordinary” renditions without preapproval of the White House or the Justice Department.18 Although the film is seemingly remote from that political context, we argue that Oldboy’s underlying themes gain transnational resonance in light of such events. Released in South Korea in the fall of 2003 (in the wake of news reports on prisoner abuses in Guantánamo prisons) and inclusive of an image of 9/11 attacks on the Twin Towers, Oldboy is a richly encoded transnational political allegory. As we will demonstrate in the chapter, Park Chan-­wook draws an implicit parallel between human rights abuses during the harshest period of the Korean authoritarian past (1972–­1987) and those in overseas CIA black sites and US military-­operated prisons after 9/11. In Chapter Eight, we address the latest trend in which ethnic diversity, diasporic consciousness, and new intraregional cultural flows reveal how heterogeneous South Korea has become in recent years. In the past few years, tamunhwa (“multi-­or plural culture”) has become a buzzword in Korean society. Contemporary statistics indicate that approximately 3.1% of the country’s population are foreigners—­data that does not take into consideration the hundreds of thousands of “illegal immigrants” who are frequently\n\n14 • Introduction\n\nexcluded not only from the government’s statistical assessments but also from programs that promote (if not actually promise) basic civil and human rights. Despite their peripheralized status as economically deprived, undocumented workers living on the fringes of society and fighting against exploitative labor practices, such individuals have become the focus of several contemporary cultural productions that together comprise an emergent genre: that of the multicultural film. Recent Korean multiculturalism films made by liberal young filmmakers—­particularly, Sim Sang-­g uk’s Where Is Ronny? (Roni rŭl ch’ajasŏ, 2008) and Shin Dong-­il (Sin Tong-­il)’s Bandhobi (Bandubi, 2009), which will be analyzed in detail in the chapter—­tackle such thorny issues as xenophobia, racial discrimination, illegal immigration, and migrant workers’ rights. We argue that these films should be understood as “pedagogical films” that advocate inclusion and tolerance and aim to educate Korean audiences about an ethics of “unconditional hospitality,” a concept coined by Jacques Derrida. Finally, in the book’s Conclusion we briefly discuss the effects of convergence culture and new technologies in disseminating Korean films and videos to non-­Korean audiences in the United States and beyond. Along with Hulu and Netflix (where wide selections of subtitled Korean television shows and/or films are available for instant streaming), YouTube has become a major media exhibition venue where many of the otherwise inaccessible cultural productions originating from South Korea can be instantly accessed. Not coincidentally, that video-­sharing platform was largely responsible for transforming Psy, a Korean pop singer, into an overnight global star in the second half of 2012. With over 900 million hits generated in the course of a five-­month period, Psy’s “Gangnam Style” became the most-­watched viral video in the history of YouTube. Less well-­known than this music video are the many cinematic classics from South Korea’s Golden Age, which are now available on YouTube, including dozens of subtitled motion pictures that the government-­subsidized Korean Film Archive has uploaded for purposes of promoting its national cinema. We will conclude our volume with departing thoughts about the impact that increased online distribution and media convergence has had on the present state and future developments of South Korean cinema as “spreadable” cultural products in global digital spaces. Ultimately, this book is a call for critical transnationalism, using film genres as the appropriately mobile vehicles through which to move movie audiences beyond conventional readings of hybridized texts (bearing the imprint of Korean as well as non-­Korean influences). Many of the core ideas that we present in this book—­ideas related to migrations both literal and figurative—­are meant to invite readers to speculate on the prospects of “post-­purity cinema” in South Korea, a formally colonized nation once obsessed with racial, ethnic, and cultural homogeneity as a means of resisting (neo)colonial powers as well as the specter of difference that came with each new wave of immigrants\n\nIntroduction • 15\n\nlooking for opportunities for professional growth and personal well-­being. As its government continues to promote multiculturalism as an official policy and its cultural producers seek to expand their overseas markets for the Korean Wave, the cinema of South Korea might be expected to move beyond ethnocentrism and heteronormativity to embrace marginal identities (LGBT individuals, migrant workers, foreign brides, North Korean refugees, etc.) that once were excluded from the public sphere. Only time will tell if such prospects for progressive social and political change pan out.\n\nChapter 1\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia A Transnational Détournement of Hollywood Melodrama A slight yet significant gesture: a man lights a cigarette with the graceful elegance and the casual demeanor of someone whose cool exterior belies a passionate, romantic streak. He hands another, unlit cigarette to a young woman standing opposite him. She brings it to her lips and leans seductively toward him. Face to face, the couple poses as if on the verge of a kiss. As they slowly draw nearer to each other, the ends of the two cigarettes touch, one lighting the other. By visualizing the convergence of two cultures—­one ostensibly bound to tradition, the other representative of modernity—­this blissful contact not only seals the pact of their newfound affection but also inscribes, at a deeper level, the complex cultural hybridization bound up in the symbolic image of the romantic couple. Any American movie fan worth his or her salt will recognize this famous “nicotine kiss” between William Holden and Jennifer Jones as the most memorable scene in Henry King’s sweeping East-­meets-­West melodrama Love Is a Many-­Splendored Thing (1955), a film that taught would-­be-­lovers around the world a particularly Hollywood way of igniting both cigarettes and passions. Aficionados of South Korea’s cinematic Golden Age, however, might recall a different scene upon hearing the previous description. In place of a picturesque Hong Kong beach, dramatically framed in CinemaScope and populated by a 19\n\n20 • Movie Migrations\n\nswimsuited twosome, a drab black-­and-­white apartment in poverty-­stricken Seoul might flicker in their minds. This is one of the settings of director Yu Hyŏn-­mok (Yu Hyun-­mok)’s critically acclaimed The Stray Bullet (Obalt’an, 1961), a postwar classic that ingeniously rearticulates and recontextualizes the scene in Love Is a Many-­Splendored Thing by situating its cigarette-­lighting couple within a claustrophobic interior. The male hero is not the American correspondent played by Holden, a personification of the escalating US imperial presence in the British crown colony, but rather an unemployed, battle-­ scarred Korean War vet played by matinee idol Ch’oe Mu-­r yong, emasculated by his lack of financial means to court and marry another woman, his movie star fiancée (Kim Hye-­jŏng). His partner in this scene (Mun Hye-­ran), unlike her Hollywood counterpart (the financially stable Eurasian medical doctor played by Jones), is a struggling part-­time college student who earns her tuition by spending four hours a day in a smoky cellar as a factory worker. Counterpoised against Hollywood’s star-­crossed lovers who whisper sweet-­ nothings against a swelling musical score, the Korean couple confesses familial loss and destitution while mimetically enacting the romantic Holden-­Jones pose accompanied by a soundtrack featuring little more than caged birds chirping offscreen. Yu’s film subtly critiques Hollywood’s Orientalist geopolitical imaginary by decisively refusing its fantasy settings and romantic excess. Like French Situationist guru Guy Debord,1 director Yu mobilizes the technique of détournement, whereby the tropes of dominant popular culture are appropriated, rerouted, and reconfigured so as to provoke a counterhegemonic disarticulation of meaning. The Korean détournement of the melodramatic scene cleverly registers the squalor and despair of postwar Seoul in which a young, handsome couple is literally caged inside slum walls while their Hollywood counterparts leisurely engage in touristic consumption in exotic Hong Kong and neighboring Macao. The Stray Bullet is a remarkably modernist text that not only hybridizes Korean and Euro-­American signifiers (costumes, languages, and soundtracks) but also commingles and intermixes Hollywood melodramatic tropes and realist South Korean aesthetics. Golden Age South Korean melodrama diverges from its American equivalent of the Eisenhower era due to the former’s focus on ordinary lower-­middle and working-­class citizens (sŏmin or sosimin) as opposed to the latter’s gravitation toward upper-­middle-­ class bourgeois housewives and widows.2 In this respect, one could argue that South Korean film melodrama offers a more discursive range of spectatorial positions than that engendered by Hollywood’s 1950s family melodrama, which, as Christine Gledhill points out, opens up a cross-­class fantasy of identification for petite bourgeois or working-­class audiences vis-­à-­vis screen surrogates basking in “lavish furnishings and consumer goods”3 whose fetishistic potency represents America’s postwar prosperity and abundance. In marked\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia • 21\n\nFIGURES 1.1 AND 1.2.

Melodrama sided with underprivileged masses suffering social and familial alienation in the shadowy margins of modernization and economic development. Thus, in terms of its aesthetic characteristics and semantic ingredients, South Korean melodrama was seldom divested of its realistic, socially conscious core. Although many commentators observe the influence of Italian Neorealism and German Expressionism in The Stray Bullet,4 few scholars have pointed out the film’s intertextual relationship with Hollywood melodrama. By linking South Korean Golden Age cinema (1955–­1972) and Classical Hollywood\n\n22 • Movie Migrations\n\nmelodrama within a comparative paradigm, this chapter addresses not only the cross-­cultural translation and adaptation of particular scenes and star-­ images but also South Korean audiences’ unique cinephilic fixation on overlooked Hollywood films. Korean audiences’ infatuation and identification with Hollywood cinema should be historicized in the postwar cultural context rather than being simply frowned upon as a symptom of US cultural imperialism. The post-­Korean War generation’s intense nostalgia for sentimental Hollywood melodrama is a significant indicator of the cultural displacement that occurs when spectatorial desire for the “other” operates within a postcolonial setting. Before embarking upon specific comparative case studies, a brief examination of the otherwise discursive cultural forces intermingled within and responsible for the formation of South Korean melodrama will provide a historical backdrop against which to frame intertextual relations.\n\nOrigins of South Korean Melodrama: Sinp’a, Han, and Hollywood In her book-­length study of Korean melodrama, feminist film scholar Yu Chi­na identifies three origins of the genre that figured decisively in the context of an emergent national cinema.5 The first source is the Japanese sinp’a (new school) drama introduced and localized during the colonial era (1910–­1945). In the late-­nineteenth-­century Meiji period, the sinp’a drama arose in Japan as a popular alternative to the kup’a (old school) drama, kabuki.6 Set in a modern milieu, it usually features a sentimental plot revolving around family tragedy and heterosexual romance. After Japan’s annexation of Korea in 1910, the sinp’a drama strongly influenced Korean theater, film, and literature, injecting Japanese theatrical modes of storytelling into the syntactic core of Korean cultural productions. Famous silent sinp’a films include Twin Jade Pavilion (Ssangongnu, 1925), Arirang (1926), Long Cherished Dream (Changhanmong, 1926), and Fallen Blossoms on a Stream (Nakhwayusu, 1927). During the Golden Age of South Korean cinema in the 1950s and 1960s, the sinp’a drama became associated with female audiences, identified by such derogatory nicknames as “handkerchief army” (sonsugŏn pudae), “tear gas” (ch’oerut’an), and “rubber shoes” (komusin: trademarks of married, middle-­aged women who migrated to the metropolis from rural areas).7 The term sinp’a is still used by South Korean critics and audiences to derogatorily designate old-­fashioned melodramas filled with unlikely coincidences and fortuitous reversals as well as excessive sentimentality.8 In addition, Yu and other scholars claim that Korean melodrama hinges upon the national sentiment of han, a slippery and subtle term that, depending on context, denotes everything from “resentment” and “lamentation” to “unfulfilled desire” and “resignation.”9 Han can be vaguely defined as the\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia • 23\n\ndeep-­rooted sadness, bitterness, and longing sparked by prolonged injustices and oppression. Various scholars have identified the sociopolitical sources of Korean han to include: a long history of foreign invasions by the Chinese, the Japanese, and the West; patriarchal Confucian traditions that have silenced and enslaved women for hundreds of years; the inhumane treatment and exploitation of the subaltern class under the feudal caste system as well as during the full-­throttle modernization process; and the gross violations of civil rights by successive authoritarian military regimes in the postcolonial period.10 Indeed, the recuperation of the abiding sense of han in South Korean melodrama seems to facilitate our appreciation of the indigenous and dormant forces behind a genre deeply influenced by colonial cultural import. However, overdependence on this elusive, psycho-­phantasmic concept for the explication of generic categories intrinsic to a particular national cinema risks generating what can be labeled “critical nationalism.” By “critical nationalism,” we refer to the attitude of filmmakers, critics, and scholars alike who contend that han is uniquely Korean, a concept that almost, if not completely, escapes translatability in other cultural lexicons. Im Kwon-­taek (Im Kwŏn-­t’aek)—­a household name in South Korea and a director whose oeuvre brims with han-­ centric films that aestheticize Korean history, tradition, and culture in melodramatic modes—­concisely sums up this position: “Han is not a concept that Koreans can agree on. I can’t even count the number of books that have been written about han. . . . However, han is a specific emotion that has profound links to the history of the Korean people, and as such, might be a difficult concept for non-­Koreans to grasp fully.”11 The critical overemphasis on such an ambiguous concept as definite marker of Korean-­ness contributes to the erection of “imagined [emotional] communities” of the nation and its culture. From the point of view of genre studies, han can be better understood as a historically and culturally specific mobilization of what Peter Brooks defines as the “melodramatic imagination” or “melodramatic mode.”12 Han indeed connotes melodramatic affect and sensibility in the Korean context. However, what is unique about Korean han is its context rather than affect in and of itself. The overlooked transnational valency of the concept becomes salient once we examine the etymological roots of this monosyllabic Sino-­Korean character. According to a Chinese-­English dictionary, “han is hen (‘hate’) in Chinese, kon (‘to bear a grudge’) in Japanese, horosul (‘sorrowfulness’) in Mongolian, korsocuka (‘hatred,’ ‘grief ’) in Manchurian, and hân (‘frustration’) in Vietnamese.”13 Although similar concepts exist throughout East and Southeast Asia, only han has emerged as a privileged marker of national culture and identity. Instead of essentializing the uniqueness of Korean melodrama on the grounds of the ontologically uncertain han, it is useful to examine how similar concepts function in other national cinemas and how they converge with and diverge from it. For example, in exploring the transnational circulation\n\n24 • Movie Migrations\n\nof filmic han as it cross-­pollinates into neighboring cultural arenas, attention could be directed to the historical epics and melodramas of Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, and other Chinese Fifth Generation filmmakers who anchor their stories in the imagery of suffering female bodies. Is the han expressed by the Korean surrogate child bearers in Im Kwon-­taek’s Surrogate Mother (Ssibaji, 1986) fundamentally different from the pain and suffering of the Chinese concubines in Zhang Yimou’s equally exoto-­ethnographic melodrama Raise the Red Lantern (Dà hóng dēnglóng gāogāo guà, 1991)? Or does the difference lie in the cultural and historical crevice separating these two nations? One can similarly cast doubt on the concept of mono no aware as being distinctively Japanese. Defined by Donald Richie as “sympathetic sadness . . . a serene acceptance of a transient world” and by David Bordwell as “the pathos of things,”14 mono no aware is an underlying emotional chord struck in the meditative family melodramas of Ozu Yasujirō and other Japanese auteurs sensitive to quotidian poetics. It is tempting to argue that mono no aware is what distinguishes tranquil Japanese melodramas from their more emotionally intense South Korean counterparts. However, many Japanese audiences appear to have experienced mono no aware when they saw Hur Jin-­ho (Hŏ Chin-­ho)’s Christmas in August (8wŏl ŭi K’ŭrisŭmasŭ, 1998), a critically lauded pan-­Asian success already canonized as a representative South Korean melodrama. According to film critic Deruoka Sojo, many Japanese who compared this film to Ozu’s work were surprised to discover that Korean sentiments were, after all, very similar to their own.15 This dispels prejudiced perceptions about South Korean cinema as alienating and defamiliarizing due to its imagined exoticism and emotive primitivism. The cult status of Christmas in August in Japan is such that the film was remade into a Japanese version directed by Nagasaki Shun’ichi in 2005. As evidenced by the Japanese reception of Christmas in August, mono no aware as well as han can be unraveled as a discursively radiating transnational experience rather than as a uniquely indigenous manifestation of a given culture’s resignation to or transcendence of sorrow. Granting that han and mono no aware have different origins, histories, and connotations, both concepts have been similarly mobilized by critics as the aesthetic purveyors of national identity. If it is true that South Koreans can sense han in Zhang Yimou’s melodramas and the Japanese can feel mono no aware in Christmas in August, both concepts need to be reexamined from a critical perspective more attuned to the cross-­cultural implications of not one but many melodramatic imaginations. While many Korean film scholars have emphasized sinp’a and han as two foundational determinants of South Korean melodrama,16 the third influence, Hollywood melodrama, remains notably understudied. The unabated influx of American films since the US military occupation (1945–­1948) and the Korean War (1950–­1953) significantly affected the genre formations of\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia • 25\n\nthe embryonic South Korean industry. Golden Age melodramas of the 1950s and 1960s register palimpsestic traces of Hollywood’s tropes and iconography, which undergo a process of cross-­cultural translation or, as Stuart Hall defines it, a “continuous process of re-­articulation and recontextualization, without any notion of a primary origin.”17 These visual and aural motifs and semantic elements are recycled and recast in specifically South Korean contexts. South Korean melodrama furthermore complicates American melodrama’s entrenched country/city binary as well as its nostalgia for a preindustrial past, both of which, as Gledhill asserts, replaced the class oppositions permeating European melodrama and created the myth of American egalitarianism.18 Rather than vilifying the city like in early American melodramas (especially those directed by D. W. Griffith), South Korean melodramas represent Seoul as bearing the imprint of modernization—­as a polyphonic center that mediates confrontations, conflicts, and compromises among rivaling values and camps: European, American, Japanese, and Korean; tradition and modernity; the ruling class and the working class; male and female; the urban and the rural. Perennial favorite The Stray Bullet, for example, does more than simply evoke or copy Hollywood melodramas, specifically Mervyn LeRoy’s Waterloo Bridge (1940) and the aforementioned Love Is a Many-­Splendored Thing. Its translation and détournement of Hollywood melodramatic scenes lay bare the artificial constructs and ideological spuriousness of larger-­than-­life romantic trappings that often obscure the disparity of power among various nations, races, genders, and classes.\n\nWaterloo Bridge and Postwar Korean Cinephilia While relatively obscure in the United States, Waterloo Bridge is among South Korean audiences’ favorite Classical Hollywood films. According to the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)’s nationwide survey of “100 Films That Audiences Want to See Again” (conducted in 1996), the ten most requested films were, in order of preference: Roman Holiday (1952), Gone With the Wind (1939), Romeo and Juliet (1968), The Sound of Music (1965), Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961), Ben-­Hur (1959), Waterloo Bridge, Doctor Zhivago (1965), The King and I (1956), and Casablanca (1942).19 The popularity of these films remained strong across generations, from parents who saw them in theaters during the 1950s and 1960s to their children who encountered them through television reruns dubbed in Korean. Considering that 6,523 out of 11,064 participants responded by means of local computer networks (such as Chollian [Ch’ŏllian] and Hitel [Hait’el]) rather than conventional postcards, it can be inferred that the voice of the younger generation was considerably amplified in the survey. In fact, among the top fifty were a number of 1980s and 1990s films including Dead Poets Society (1989, No. 14), The Shawshank Redemption (1994,\n\n26 • Movie Migrations\n\nNo. 19), The Mission (1986, No. 22), The Terminator (1984, No. 24), Forrest Gump (1994, No. 25), The Last Emperor (1987, No. 26), Once Upon a Time in America (1984, No. 29), Amadeus (1984, No. 31), Out of Africa (1985, No. 32), A River Runs through It (1992, No. 37), Ghost (1990, No. 38), Rain Man (1988, No. 39), Schindler’s List (1993, No. 40), Top Gun (1986, No. 41), Back to the Future (1985, No. 44), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981, No. 45), Braveheart (1995, No. 47), and Scent of a Woman (1992, No. 48). However, the fact that the top ten list consists primarily of Classical Hollywood films clearly attests to South Korean audiences’ general preference of what they call “unforgettable classics” over contemporary Hollywood blockbusters. Although Love Is a Many-­ Splendored Thing ranks relatively low on this list (No. 84), its status would likely have been much higher if more fans from the older generation had participated in the survey. Regrettably (and tellingly), only one South Korean film, Im Kwon-­taek’s Sopyonje (Sŏp’yŏnje, 1993), broke into the list, coming in at No. 74. This is not surprising. Attracting record-­breaking audiences at the time of its theatrical release, Sopyonje became a cultural phenomenon in its country of origin, reviving the popularity of the waning indigenous operatic storytelling art form p’ansori.20 Despite the fact that the survey was conducted before the arrival of South Korean cinema’s fin-­de-­siècle renaissance initiated by a series of box-­office hits such as Contact (Chŏpsok, 1997), Whispering Corridors (Yŏgo koedam, 1998), Shiri (Swiri, 1999), Attack the Gas Station (Chuyuso sŭpkyŏk sagŏn, 1999), Joint Security Area (Kongdong kyŏngbiguyŏk, 2000), Friend (Ch’in’gu, 2001), and My Sassy Girl (Yŏpgijŏkin kŭnyŏ, 2001), it is both curious and disturbing that not a single Golden Age South Korean film appears on a list dominated by Classical and post-­Classical Hollywood cinema. The distinctive characteristics of South Korean cinephilia should be analyzed and contextualized before such preferences are dismissed as the by-­ product of US cultural imperialism in general and of Hollywood hegemony in particular. For many post-­Korean War theatergoers, whose mania for “Dream Factory” products and whose celebration and recognition of the “genius of the system” rivaled that of contemporaneous Cahiers du Cinéma critics in Paris, American films offered much more than an entertaining night out with friends and family. With few exceptions, Old Hollywood films, packed with glossy images and blessed with wholesome, innocent characters and story lines, represented the hopes and dreams of poverty-­stricken masses in the underdeveloped country. Like the poor Sicilian child Toto (Salvatore Cascio) and his undereducated projectionist friend Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) in Cinema Paradiso (1988)—­the highest ranked Italian film (No. 11) on the KBS list—­cinephilic Koreans managed to endure postwar poverty and hardship in the therapeutic glow of the movie screen. From a political standpoint, it is indeed problematic that audiences were passively sutured into a cross-­racial\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia • 27\n\nset of identificatory gazes and were often oblivious to the ideological transparency normalizing the implicit white, male subject position. However, the enormous spectatorial pleasures and comfort provided by Classical Hollywood films, as well as the emergence of a cinephilic competency and potential to engage the act of cross-­cultural détournement, should be recuperated as a critical intervention in the cultural history and memory of the 1950s and 1960s. In renowned South Korean journalist-­writer Ahn Junghyo (An Chŏng-­ hyo)’s novel, The Life and Death of the Hollywood Kid (Hŏlliudŭ k’idŭ ŭi saengae, 1992),21 the narrator dreamily reminisces about the period’s obsessive theatergoing: We chased dreams and escaped the sorrows of our ugly lives through the films. We sought outlets for our anger and longing for happiness at the cinema. Although we missed the early silent era when such screen legends as Greta Garbo, Rudolph Valentino, and the Barrymores reigned, we still had many names to evoke our fantasies: Rudolph Maté, Henry King, Henry Hathaway, Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Capra, George Cukor, Michael Curtiz, Delmer Daves, Edward Dmytryk, Fred Zinnemann, Howard Hawks, Fritz Lang, Jean Negulesco, Mervyn LeRoy, Lewis Milestone, Mark Robson, George Seaton, George Stevens, King Vidor, Raoul Walsh, Robert Wise. . . . Upon my first encounter with the world of cinema, I was, like a drug addict, unable to resist the magical power of the screen. . . . For us, going to the movies was a religious act, like going to Mass.22\n\nAlthough the star-­struck, auteurist narrator is retrospectively critical of his and his friends’ (a group of schoolboys who proudly proclaim themselves the “Magnificent Seven”) blind fascination with Classical Hollywood films, which caused them to “misrecognize white faces as [their] own faces” and “misconstrue Indians as [their] enemies and genocidal American and English troops as [their] allies,”23 the novel unmistakably evinces nostalgia for a bygone era. It was a time when South Korean audiences had access to thousands of North American and European classics, many of them now available only as faded images flitting about in failing memories due to the limited South Korean video and DVD markets. Although South Koreans were so engrossed by Occidental cultural productions that they deemed indigenous films inferior to their Western counterparts, the reception of Hollywood products remained emphatically Korean in terms of canon formation and cross-­cultural hermeneutics. Historically, Koreans have often gravitated toward sad stories centering around star-­crossed lovers separated by war, death, or social prejudice—­ melancholic films, in other words, that demand a certain willingness to withhold ironic judgment in the face of providential coincidences and emotional excess.\n\n28 • Movie Migrations\n\nExcept for The Sound of Music, all of the films in the aforementioned top ten list depart from Hollywood’s conventional happy endings. Tragic romances—­ unconsummated due to the intervention of social upheaval, familial opposition, or cruel fate—­form the narrative trajectory of many of these films. Although Ahn Junghyo’s narrator unfurls an impressive list of favorite directors, South Korean audiences generally flock to star vehicles in lieu of auteur films. Remarkably, yet tellingly, not a single Hitchcock, Ford, or Welles film broke into the KBS 100 list, whereas four romantic comedies starring Audrey Hepburn (Roman Holiday [No. 1], Breakfast at Tiffany’s [No. 6], Sabrina [No. 16], and My Fair Lady [No. 33]) were included in the top fifty. It is noteworthy that the quoted passage from The Life and Death of the Hollywood Kid lists Henry King and Mervyn LeRoy, who directed Love Is a Many-­Splendored Thing and Waterloo Bridge respectively, without a trace of such legends as Douglas Sirk and Nicholas Ray, film melodrama’s preeminent auteurs whose combined work is crucial to the academic legitimization and canonization of the genre. Mervyn LeRoy’s MGM melodramas and literary adaptations, including Waterloo Bridge, Random Harvest (1942), Madame Curie (1943), Little Women (1949), and Quo Vadis (1951), are considered classics by South Korean audiences, while his critically acclaimed Warner Bros. gangster and social problem films such as Little Caesar (1931) and I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932) remain virtually unknown. Screen (Sk’ŭrin), a leading South Korean movie magazine, described Mervyn LeRoy as “The Father of Melodrama Who Made Waterloo Bridge” and referred to the film as one of the five best melodramas ever made,24 an audacious statement in light of the Western canon’s preference for such films as Stella Dallas (1937), Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948), Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and Imitation of Life (1959). Indeed, Waterloo Bridge and Love Is a Many-­Splendored Thing are the archetypal sentimental melodramas popular among South Korean audiences. The older generation of theatergoers who saw these films upon their original release during or not long after the Korean War could easily identify with the tragic stories of two lovers who suffer the separation and loss caused or exacerbated by wars.25 During the three-­year civil conflict, 3 million Koreans were killed, wounded, or missing. Another 10 million people endured familial breakups.26 This transpired only a decade after the Japanese colonial government mobilized millions of Koreans for labor, military service, and sexual slavery to expedite their war efforts across Asia and the Pacific Islands, dividing countless families and lovers.27 South Korean audiences wept for Vivien Leigh’s Myra, a ballet dancer-­turned-­streetwalker in Waterloo Bridge, just as they shed tears for Jennifer Jones’s Han Suyin, a Hong Kong Eurasian doctor who loses her American lover during the Korean War in Love Is a Many-­ Splendored Thing. These unfortunate heroines whose ill-­ fated lives were\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia • 29\n\nravaged by war, functioned—­in the collective spectatorial consciousness—­as surrogates for millions of Korean daughters, mothers, and sisters who either lost their fathers, husbands, and sons during World War II and the Korean War or became sex slaves (“comfort women”) for the Japanese Imperial Army and prostitutes for American GIs. The theme of military prostitution, a shadow looming over Korean femininity, plays a pivotal role in Waterloo Bridge. Robert E. Sherwood’s eponymous play was adapted into three very different studio films over a twenty-­five-­year period. Director James Whale’s pre-­Code Universal version (1931) is most faithful to the original story and stars Mae Clark as the heroine. Two MGM remakes followed: Mervyn LeRoy’s 1940 film, held dear by South Koreans, and director Curtis Bernhardt’s Gaby (1956), unanimously panned as the worst of the three despite the endearing, pixie-­like presence of Leslie Caron and a revised happy ending. Sherwood’s original play is regarded by literary critics as “melodramatic, and . . . as sentimental as the author warns in his preface it is going to be . . . the sophomore’s story of the Fallen Woman and the Nice Young Man . . . [which] can in no sense establish a claim to literary distinction.”28 The play’s setting is World War I. Myra is an expatriate American chorus girl who is stranded in London and enduring German air raids. After befriending Kitty, a cockney British prostitute, Myra—­penniless and desperate—­descends into a life of soliciting sexual bargains from GIs on furlough. The chorine-­turned-­prostitute soon falls in love with an innocent compatriot soldier enlisted in a Canadian regiment, Roy Cronin, who offers tender affection to Myra, mistaking her as a decent girl. Roy is even willing to desert the military to stay with his loved one. Myra persuades him to return to his duties as a soldier, assuring him that she will wait steadfastly for him. After parting with her lover on Waterloo Bridge, where the two first met, Myra, unable to escape her shameful past, invites death by making herself a visible target for German bombers. Whale’s and LeRoy’s cinematic adaptations of Sherwood’s anti-­war play fit conventionally into the category of what Lea Jacobs calls the “fallen woman film . . . the genre [that] is not popular with present-­day audiences . . . [but] was a staple of Hollywood melodrama”29 from the 1920s to the 1940s. Due to its focus on illicit sexuality, the fallen woman genre was subjected to careful scrutiny by the industry and was prone to censorship, which became more systematic after the 1934 installation of the Production Code Administration (PCA) headed by Joseph I. Breen to enforce the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930. Warner Bros., a socially conscious studio known for its founders’ pro-­Roosevelt political affiliation and sensitivity to working-­class interests, first attempted to remake Whale’s Waterloo Bridge. The PCA discouraged the studio by stating, “We regret to inform you that it is our opinion that this story, as treated in the play, is definitely objectionable from the point of view\n\n30 • Movie Migrations\n\nof the Production Code. . . . The story is objectionable on the ground that it glorifies a prostitute, shows details of prostitution, sympathy is created for acts of prostitution, and the sin itself is not shown to be wrong.”30 When David O. Selznick knocked on the door of the PCA again with the same material in tow, Breen this time forwarded the producer a cable from the British Board of Film Censors that expressed their disapproval of the earlier version: “Film Waterloo Bridge submitted for censorship September 1931 considered prohibitive heroine being a prostitute. Film drastically amended to eliminate this characteristic and was passed. Board considers reissue most undesirable.”31 Once MGM began toying with the project and finally submitted their early draft to Breen’s office, the PCA still found the script objectionable on three counts: the details of prostitution; the condoning of prostitution by Roy’s mother; and the inclusion of air raids over London, a taboo topic for the British censors. LeRoy and his screenwriters gave the original material a thorough “cleansing” to conform to the PCA’s standards and regulations. The details of Myra’s descent into prostitution were curtailed and no direct mention of her occupation was made; the dialogue in which Roy’s mother condones Myra’s past was eliminated; and Myra’s death scene was rewritten so that the heroine commits suicide by throwing herself in the path of speeding army trucks rather than being bombed. One of the notable differences between Whale’s and LeRoy’s versions is the pre-­fall status of Myra. As Cam Tolton comments, “Mae Clark’s Myra [in the 1931 version] was a cheap chorine packaged much as she was in The Public Enemy with James Cagney in the same year. A far cry from the exquisite ballet-­hopeful that Myra would become when played by Vivien Leigh. When LeRoy upgraded Myra’s cultural status, he upgraded the whole production with her.”32 Just as Vivien Leigh’s Myra is a much more polished, respectable variation of Mae Clark’s, Robert Taylor’s Roy likewise rose from a humble Canadian soldier to a Scottish aristocrat officer. Leigh’s character changed from an American-­ born chorus girl to an English schoolmaster’s daughter who works as a ballet dancer under the stern disciplinary watch of Madame Kirowa (Maria Ouspenskaya). Vivien Leigh’s Myra turns to prostitution only after she is unjustly fired, is mistakenly informed of her fiancé Roy’s death, and learns that, after months of sickness, her best friend Kitty (Virginia Field) has been supporting her with money earned from streetwalking. As Mary Ann Doane points out, the “situation is an impossible one”33 because prostitution is unspeakable and unrepresentable in Classical Hollywood cinema. For example, Myra manages to make Roy’s mother (Lucile Watson) understand her past by answering “You are naive” to the future mother-­in-­law’s question, “Has there been someone else?” Belatedly discovering Myra’s secret after her disappearance and suicide, Roy relieves Kitty of the burden of speaking the unutterable word by saying, “I understand—­you don’t have to say it.”\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia • 31\n\nThe American censorship of Waterloo Bridge contrasts sharply with South Korean censorship of The Stray Bullet. While American motion picture censorship, with its principal of self-­regulation that precluded the need for federal restrictions, focused on issues of sexual and religious morality so as to prevent local censorship and church boycotts, Korean films have constantly been subjected to stringent state regulations, whether the colonial government’s suppression of anti-­colonial, nationalistic films or South Korea’s authoritarian, military regimes’ (1961–­1987) severe censoring of politically subversive subjects. In The Stray Bullet, prostitution is unambiguously foregrounded in the narrative and is explicitly named by characters. For the Park Chung Hee (Pak Chŏng-­hŭi) regime, which came into power through the May 16, 1961 coup d’état during the original release of The Stray Bullet, the threat posed by the film stemmed not from its representation of military prostitution but from its realist critique of social illness and corruption. The anti-­communist government banned the film, suspecting a pro-­North subtext couched in recurring scenes where the North Korean refugee family’s demented matriarch (No Chae-­sin) yells, “Let’s get out of here!”34 The ban was not lifted until 1963, when the film was rereleased. Unlike in Classical Hollywood film, prostitution and adultery emerged as normative subject matter in South Korean cinema, culminating in the “hostess genre” cycle of the 1970s,35 under the acquiescence of dictatorial regimes encouraging sexual subjects to divert the public’s attention from political oppression. If the story of Waterloo Bridge seems deviant by Hollywood’s sometimes-­puritanical standards, it is completely normal and familiar to South Koreans accustomed to realistic portrayals of illegitimate sexual relations. Interestingly, at the time of its original release, Waterloo Bridge was not deemed an “impossible text,” as contemporary cine-­feminists might be predisposed to label it. The film was instead promoted and reviewed as a typical Hollywood romance with top stars. Much publicity has been generated from the fact that this was Vivien Leigh’s first starring role after her Academy Award-­ winning portrayal of Scarlett O’Hara, a compelling performance in Gone with the Wind (1939) that turned a little-­known British actress into a big-­name marquee attraction. The studio also milked what was being touted as the “happiest reunion in Hollywood”—­that between Leigh and Taylor, who first costarred in MGM’s A Yank at Oxford (1938), one of the studio’s many productions shot in England. The film additionally marked LeRoy’s anticipated return to the director’s chair after overseeing the production of The Wizard of Oz (1939) and other big-­budget MGM projects of the late 1930s. Although Waterloo Bridge is now nearly forgotten or ignored by critics and the public alike in the United States, the film received glowing reviews upon its release. Commentators, for the most part, described the film as a fine love story or a woman’s picture, calling it “a persuasive and compelling romantic\n\n32 • Movie Migrations\n\ntragedy that will sweep through for smash grosses . . . adult entertainment, particularly aimed at femme customers” (Weekly Variety, May 11, 1940), “a sure-­fire woman’s picture headed for important coin” (Weekly Variety, May 11, 1940), “a beautiful, tender love story that should have special appeal for femme fans” (Film Daily, May 16, 1940), and a picture with “deep appeal for women patrons, as evidenced by the extensive use of handkerchiefs at the preview” (The Hollywood Reporter, May 11, 1940).36 Considering this observation of the film’s appeal to female audiences, it is peculiar that Waterloo Bridge continues to fall by the wayside whenever the feminist film canon is revamped or reformulated. One interesting aspect of the film’s American reception is that it did much better at the box office when rereleased in 1944 than it did on its original release in 1940. On October 4 of that year, the New York Times reported “astonishment over at MGM these days [concerning] the success being enjoyed by the current reissue of the 4-­year-­old Waterloo Bridge.” As the newspaper elaborates, “In thirteen out of the fourteen cities it has played so far, managers of Loew’s Theaters have reported grosses ranging from 24 percent to 179 percent above business done by the film when it was brand new.”37 Even though many reviewers commented on the film’s “timeliness” upon its original release in the wake of Great Britain’s entrance into World War II (the historical frame of the film encapsulating Roy Cronin’s flashback), the United States of 1940 was only a precariously situated yet distant observer of conflicts brewing in the European political arena. By the time the picture was rereleased four years later, its story was no longer foreign or abstract. No doubt, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, American audiences could better appreciate the immediacy of a narrative depicting the tragic effects of the war on the lives of sympathetic young men and women. The same was true for South Korean audiences who encountered the film for the first time during the Korean War. Myra—­a respectable ballerina who sinks into prostitution for GIs when her fiancé is mistakenly reported dead—­is an all-­too-­familiar figure in the minds of South Koreans: she is the image of the yanggongju. As Hyun Sook Kim succinctly defines her: “Historically, the term ‘Yanggongju’ has referred to Korean women who engage in sexual labor for foreign soldiers. . . . Used derogatorily, it means ‘Yankee whore,’ ‘Yankee wife,’ ‘UN lady,’ and/or ‘Western princess.’ This epithet, ‘Yanggongju,’ relegates Korean women working in militarized prostitution with foreign men to the lowest status within the hierarchy of prostitution.”38 Following the Korean War, US troops became permanently installed in South Korea so as to protect the host country from communist threat from the North. Accordingly, over 1 million Korean women have served as “entertainment hostesses” to accommodate the sexual needs of American military officers and soldiers—­VIPs of the South Korean government.39 Although Vivien Leigh’s Myra is not a prostitute for foreign soldiers of different racial\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia • 33\n\nbackgrounds, her suggestive smile at uniformed GIs carries an unsettling resemblance to that of South Korea’s cinematic yanggongjus, from the evening gown-­clad seductress Sonya (Ch’oe Ŭn-­hŭi) in Hell Flower (Chiokhwa, 1958) to the peasant widow-­turned-­“UN Lady” Ŏl-­lye (Yi Hye-­suk) in Silver Stallion (Ŭnma nŭn oji annŭnda, 1991). Raven-­haired, brown-­eyed Myra even physically approximates the ubiquitously inscribed filmic yanggongju image. Throughout the cinematic Golden Age, yanggongjus were portrayed either as temptresses equivalent to the dangerous, powerful, and sexually promiscuous femme fatales of American film noir or as tragic fallen women forced to sell their bodies due to postwar poverty and familial duties. For Hell Flower, director Shin Sang-­ok (Sin Sang-­ok) cast his wife, Ch’oe Ŭn-­hŭi (a Golden Age actress who is best remembered as the chaste widow in The Houseguest and My Mother [Sarangbang sonnim kwa ŏmŏni, 1961]), against type. In the film, Ch’oe plays an egoistic, decadent yanggong ju, a bad “spider woman” who lures male characters into her web of deceit and is ultimately punished for her transgression by an avenging husband who kills her. In The Stray Bullet, Myŏng-­suk (Sŏ Ae-­ja), the decent-­minded daughter of an impoverished North Korean refugee family, slides into the life of a yanggongju when rejected by her disabled Korean War vet fiancé for whom a marriage is too heavy a burden. When her brother Ch’ŏr-­ho’s wife (Mun Chŏng-­suk) gives birth, it is Myŏng-­ suk’s savings earned from military prostitution that pay for the hospital fee, despite the fact that Ch’ŏr-­ho (Kim Chin-­g yu), in an earlier scene, turned his face in shame when he spotted his sister with an American GI. Myŏng-­suk is emblematic of the tens of thousands of postwar Korean women who were forced into military prostitution out of economic urgency. The pro-­ democratic, anti-­ authoritarian, anti-­ American labor union and student demonstrations that comprised the minjung movement of the 1980s and early 1990s instigated a new perception of and interest in yanggong jus. Having been long neglected and despised as the lowest of the low, these women emerged as the victimized “sisters and daughters” of the nation enslaved by American imperialists, so long as their legacy was couched within the rhetoric of nationalist activism and political dissidence urging the withdrawal of the US military and the reunification of the Korean peninsula. One case in particular—­the brutal rape and murder of a bar woman, Yun Kŭm-­i, by Private Kenneth Markle (who stuffed two beer bottles into Yun’s womb, a cola bottle into her uterus, and an umbrella into her anus after killing her) in 1992—­sparked nationwide rage and stoked protests against the US military. As a convenient corporeal metaphor for the oppressed nation and the disfranchised classes, the yanggong ju conspicuously haunted the margins of the New Korean cinema throughout the 1980s and 1990s (from In the Heat of the Night [Pam ŭi yŏlgi sok ŭro, 1985] to Spring In My Hometown [Arŭmdaun sijŏl, 1998]), a period dominated by intellectual New Wave male directors emerging\n\n34 • Movie Migrations\n\nfrom the leftist student movement, such as Jang Sun-­woo (Chang Sŏn-­u), Park Kwang-­su (Pak Kwang-­su), and Chung Ji-­young (Chŏng Chi-­yŏng).\n\nThe Hollywood “Scene of Misrecognition” vs. the Korean “Scene of Recognition” Returning once again to the question of intertextuality linking The Stray Bullet and Waterloo Bridge, we would like to draw attention to two contrasting, yet parallel scenes—­one from each film—­in which the same event of the fallen woman’s accidental encounter with her lover at a place of prostitution is repeated in radically different configurations. Built upon dissimilar gaze structures and moving toward different narrative outcomes, these scenes provide a mutually enriching case study through which to unmask the ideological mechanisms undergirding the construction of a transnational imaginary. In the former, Myra makes her usual trip to Waterloo Station to solicit a customer. She enters the station, sending inviting glances and smiles toward a crowd of arriving solders. When she greets one, saying “Welcome home,” the soldier condescendingly responds “Thanks, ducky,” and exits. The camera dollies in to a close-­up of Myra’s face overwhelmed by shame and pathos. Looking blankly into the camera, her sad, trance-­like visage suddenly beams with a combination of shock and joy. The following shot cuts to several soldiers walking toward the camera along the platform, a stampeding crowd from which Roy emerges. The point-­of-­view immediately shifts to Roy, who spots Myra and rushes toward her, frantically calling her name. With climactic orchestral accompaniment, the lovers reunite in each other’s arms, gazing at each other adoringly in tightly framed shot-­reverse-­shots. The officer’s excitement and euphoria overflows into a torrent of words in contrast to a speechless Myra who can barely utter, “Roy, you’re alive.” The miraculously returned fiancé seems unaware of any change in Myra’s appearance and status despite her tawdry dress and tell-­tale makeup as well as her feeble excuse that she has come to the station to meet “no one in particular.” There are two moments when Roy makes a deliberate effort to look at Myra, to subtly fix his gaze on a woman who no longer conforms to the ideal image of virginal heroine. The first moment occurs when he tells her that he cannot believe what has happened: “Darling, let me look at you. I’m not dreaming, am I?” The second instance takes place in the following scene set in a teashop, where they sit and talk. “Let me have a squint at you,” Roy says, as he inspects Myra up and down after she improvises the meager excuse that she cannot accompany him to his family mansion in Scotland because she looks unfit and has no decent wardrobe. Although Roy reluctantly agrees with her, stating, “Now I look at you, there is something in what you say,” he misreads her dress code as a sign of destitution rather than prostitution. In both cases, Roy’s\n\nToward a Strategic Korean Cinephilia • 35\n\nscrutinizing gaze fails, for he does not see what the spectator sees. Oblivious to Myra’s dilemma and internalized agony, Roy takes charge and dominates the scene, pouring tea for the sobbing woman, telling her that she will quit her job and marry him, calling his mother to inform her of their impending arrival, and suggesting a trip to the clothing store. Once again, Roy misunderstands when Myra musters courage to say that she cannot go with him. He asks if she has someone else, a suspicion Myra adamantly denies, assuring him, “I loved you. I never loved anyone else. I never shall”—­a statement which will resurface during middle-­aged Roy’s oral flashback in the film’s last scene. Roy’s momentary doubt evaporates and his ego remains intact due to Myra’s oath of platonic devotion, which the unknowing fiancé self-­servingly misrecognizes as sexual fidelity. In the corresponding scene of The Stray Bullet, Myŏng-­suk, dressed in Western attire, is shown in a deep-­focus shot standing alone with her head hung low as she sets up “shop” on a street corner where nightly transactions between Korean women and American GIs take place. The background shows the traditionally coded gate of the Chosŏn Hotel, which displays a bilingual sign. Into the middle distance streams a group of men and women. The “new face” is noticed by a GI who addresses Myŏng-­suk in English, fishing for her name. The flirtation between the two is juxtaposed with a long shot of Myŏng-­suk’s disabled ex-­fiancé, Kyŏng-­sik (Yun Il-­bong), limping toward the scene from afar. Laughing mischievously, Myŏng-­suk runs away from the GI who claims her for the evening. The scurrying woman and her Korean lover with crutches bump into each other and fall to the ground. Recognizing Myŏng-­suk, Kyŏng-­sik flashes a smile, in a rare close-­up shot, which quickly turns south into a frown against a grim musical cue. Myŏng-­suk’s reaction shot is suppressed. The camera stays with Kyŏng-­sik’s point-­of-­view as he watches her flee the scene with the American GI chasing after her. The wounded veteran immediately comprehends the gravity of his lover’s situation as he stands alone, looking in the direction where Myŏng-­suk has disappeared. His horrific recognition is visually accentuated as a yanggongju-­GI couple emerges from the left side of the frame and crosses the foreground. Picking up his crutches, Kyŏng-­sik despondently starts limping away. A bilingual traffic sign is clearly visible in the background, indicating the Korean man’s displacement in a space reserved for American masculinity. Kyŏng-­sik eventually sinks into a nearby bench, sobbing uncontrollably. The scene of his breakdown is intercut with a shot of an escaped Myŏng-­suk, guilty but relieved, leaning against a tree. These two scenes are symptomatic of the aesthetic and ideological ruptures separating a Classical Hollywood text and a Golden Age South Korean text. In Waterloo Bridge, the use of close-­ups and shot-­reverse-­shots are pronounced. As the station scene progresses, shots get tighter and tighter until Myra and Roy look into each other’s eyes in a self-­contained and flattened romantic\n\n36 • Movie Migrations\n\nFIGURE 1.3. Roy misrecognizes Myra in a close-­up from Waterloo Bridge.\n\nspace winnowed from its external setting. Background passers-­by, though occasionally visible in frame, are conveniently out of focus so that the spectator’s attention stays fixed on the main couple. The scene in The Stray Bullet, by contrast, extends and maximizes focal depth and suppresses close-­ups in favor of long shots so as to accentuate the surroundings in which the characters are situated.
