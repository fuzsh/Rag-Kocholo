        "text": "By: Sarah Jessica Mercado and Mari Mikhaela Javier\n\nAccording to Bloomberg News, Webtoon is today’s “viral export” from Korea. Based on the survey released by Statista on April 5th this year, Webtoons are becoming increasingly popular around the world.\n\nNot only it is the trend of the recent K-Drama adaptations, the vertically-read digital manhwa is already paving its way next to the K-Wave success. But before becoming a trend, Webtoons went through different changes before expanding to different genres to cater to its audience’s tastes and the variety of storytelling preferences.\n\nGetting to know Webtoon\n\nThe word “webtoon” is derived from the words “world wide web” and “cartoon.” It is a digitally enhanced manhwa (Korean comics) made just for digital devices such as phones and tablets with just a quick swipe and scrolls up and down instead of the standard page flipping like our traditional comic book.\n\nThe rise of smart devices correlated with the accessibility to the internet that’s available almost anywhere, at any time, the number of webtoon consumption in Korea is also growing. According to Time Magazine, the most popular and widely used is Naver WEBTOON in Korea, which has about 89 million active users on a monthly basis. Its readership is made up of 60% women and 75% Gen Z and younger Millennials.\n\nAs the popularity of Webtoons is increasing in cyberspace and as K-Dramas grew in popularity and began targeting global audiences, many TV producers, and screenwriters are gaining interest in adapting these web contents into series or in television in particular.\n\nSouth Korea is home to numerous popular webtoons. Through the years, the younger population of Korea has been enjoying a series of storytelling in the form of visual images and texts. This unique form of storytelling started to gain popularity worldwide, and thus brought webtoon characters and their narratives to life through K-Dramas.\n\nSince webtoons are mostly made by young creators, there’s a wide range of genres that compete to earn the interest of the readers. This is also the main reason why it is a good source material for K-Drama producers and companies. It has an established popularity already and all cards are laid out, increasing the success of viewership when aired as K-Drama. Marketing-wise, webtoon is already popular, so the fans of the original series can already create a buzz online for others to anticipate the K-Drama.\n\nThe Trend: What’s Popular Among Webtoon Readers\n\nWebtoon comes in various genres, including comedy, horror, slice-of-life, and everything in between. A recent study, conducted by the Korea Creative Content Agency in 2022, found that the fantasy romance genre is the most popular among consumers. Some of the famous Romance Fantasy genre webtoons are ‘Remarried Empress’ or ‘Suddenly Became a Princess One Day’.\n\nThis is pretty much the reason why we are getting much more fantasy and romance, adapted into a TV series. Some of the fantasy romances adapted into a series were “Yumi’s Cell,” “True Beauty,” and “Extraordinary You” to name a few. However, as more webtoons are being adapted to K-Dramas, the global audience is starting to consume more types of content throughout the years.\n\nSome genres that consumers enjoy\n\nFantasy and Supernatural\n\nCurrently, the most popular webtoon-based K-Dramas include fantasy and supernatural elements. Some of the hit K-Dramas that revolve around this theme include “W: Two Worlds”, “Tomorrow” and “The Uncanny Counter” and “Hellbound”. These shows proved that the viewers are thirsty for dramas in other genres, given that “The Uncanny Counter” and “Hellbound” released news that they will be having season 2.\n\nSchool\n\nAnother popular theme is the school setting and some of the popular ones include “Extraordinary You”, “Cheese in The Trap,” “My ID is Gangnam Beauty,” “Love Alarm” and “True Beauty”. These kinds of K-Dramas have already been popular for a long time. But these titles are widely loved by many because of its relatable scenes and characters. Because of that, these webtoons made a strong TV drama debut and have managed to earn high viewership ratings throughout its airing.\n\nIn a recently concluded 3-day webtoon workshop by webtoon artist Na Seung Hoon in the Philippines, he sees that the trend in Korean webtoon stories nowadays is where the main character passes and is reborn as a rich person. And he added that it may be because Korean people wish that to happen in their life.\n\nWebtoon Turned K-Dramas\n\nWhat is your favorite webtoon-turned-drama?\n\nBased on the article released by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism back in November 2020, the first dramatized webtoon was Yoon Tae Ho’s “Misaeng: Incomplete Life” starring Im Siwan and Kang Sora. The drama aired on tvN way back in 2014 and received a lot of sympathy from the viewers as they have seen themselves in each character. And if you are a fan of slice-of-life K-Dramas then, you have definitely seen this series already.\n\nAnother hit webtoon adapted to a series that gained so much love recently, producing 2 seasons in 2 consecutive years was “Yumi’s Cells” which revolves around romance, the work life of a single woman in her 30s starred by Kim Go-Eun. According to Song Jae-Jung, the head screenwriter of the TV version of Yumi’s Cells in an interview with Time, as K-dramas grew in popularity and began targeting global audiences, many producers became reluctant to take risks. As a result, they would lean into safer and more universal stories which webtoons can offer. As webtoons have already proven their popularity and quality within the platform, they became a primary source for so many K-Dramas.\n\nMeanwhile, if you are a fan of thriller and suspense, you probably came across the Netflix series “All Of Us Are Dead” which highlights the story of high school students trapped in their school building and trying to find a way to escape the zombies who used to be their friends and teachers. When this K-Drama debuted on the streaming platform Netflix, it took the world by storm, opening a bigger global audience for zombie-themed K-Dramas. Aside from that, the platform also announced that this series will be having a season 2!\n\nThe Pros and Cons\n\nThe adaptation of a webtoon to K-Drama is a popular way to transform images into visually appealing moving art in the form of drama. It has a huge potential in the global market, especially if streaming platforms carry the title. However, the hype for webtoon-turned-K-Dramas may cause high expectations and backlash, as readers already know the story and characters through the webtoon.\n\nIn addition, there could be a large difference between the style, pacing, and transition of characters and storyline at some point, which could affect the viewership of the K-Drama. To make the adaptation successful, the author, scriptwriter, and director need to find a balance between the original webtoon and the drama script.\n\nUpcoming K-Dramas that came from Webtoon to watch out for\n\nWorldwide trends show that webtoons are becoming more and more popular. It’s not surprising that there are more adaptations available, given the weekly publication of fresh stories online. We should expect to see more television series and motion pictures this year as more webtoons land deals for adaptation. Below are some of the series to watch out for this year!\n\nDaily Dose of Sunshine\n\n정신병동에도 아침은 와요 or Morning Comes to Psychiatric Wards Too. The story is based on the author’s true-to-life experience when working as a nurse in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. This webtoon adaptation will star Park Bo-Young, Yeon Woo-Jin, Jang Dong-Yoon, and Lee Jung-Eun.\n\nBloodhounds\n\nThe series will be based on JungChan’s thriller webtoon story “Hunting Dogs” (in Korean, “사냥개들”). It depicts the tale of three men who became involved with one another as a result of debt and their efforts to escape it. This webtoon adaptation will star Woo DoHwan, Lee SangYi, Park SungWoong, and Jung DaEun.\n\nAll in all, webtoons are without a doubt going to keep expanding as the mainstay of Korean youth culture and cultural industries, and eventually the worldwide cultural scene."
