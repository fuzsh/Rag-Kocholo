        "text": "What is a Webtoon?\n\nWhere does the format come from?\n\nWebtoons originated in South Korea and are a form of digital storytelling for comics.\n\nWhile this format was at first especially popular in Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Japan in recent years, it has also become more and more commonplace in western countries.\n\nA characteristic feature of the webtoon is the format’s vertical scroll and reading style, which is meant specifically for smartphones. Webtoons are usually free to read for anyone who is a casual comic reader.\n\nThere are a number of popular Webtoon original series that have been adapted into books and TV series, such as Lore Olympus, Cheese in the Trap, and Lookism.\n\nIf you already know what webtoons are you can find more on how to construct them here!\n\nWebtoons articles\n\nClip Studio Paint articles\n\nComic drawing articles\n\nManga drawing articles\n\nWebtoon platforms available\n\nWebtoon is a service and a website where artists can upload and read comics in the Webtoon format.\n\nIn order to read the comics on your smartphone, it’s recommended to download the Webtoon app.\n\nMost Webtoons can also be read using your smartphone browser, but you’ll need to use the app to read paid or exclusive content.\n\nBelow are some of the most famous Webtoon sites:\n\nWebtoon.com\n\nTapas.io\n\nlezhin.com\n\nToomics\n\nYou’ll find that on these websites, comics by professional comic/webtoon artists are published for serializations and will sometimes be translated into English for a broader audience.\n\nWhat’s more is that on sites like Webtoon.com, comico and Tapas.io, individual artists are also able to upload their own stories for others to read. This might be your chance to bring your story to a new audience!\n\nWebtoon.com: Webtoon Canvas\n\nTapas.io: Publishing\n\nWhat makes a comic a Webtoon?\n\nLet’s have a look at what makes the Webtoon-format different from other comic formats.\n\nReading the story vertically\n\nThe biggest difference between the Webtoon-style and conventional comics is the panel division, this is due to the vertical format.\n\nSince smartphones have limited screen sizes, overlapping panels may be hard to read and oftentimes, zooming in and out of a page is necessary to see details.\n\nIn a Webtoon-style comic, panels are arranged in a mostly vertical order, with more space in between them, to accommodate for the smaller display size. Most of the space for your story to unfold will be given to your from scrolling. For this reason, the image size is usually very long.\n\nThis vertical scrolling format for the panels has the following features:\n\n1. Placement of characters and dialog is deliberate\n\nIn traditional comics and manga, the shape of the panels, the placement of characters, and dialog are arranged according to the page size. Webtoon-style comics, on the other hand, make use of the long page format and arrange these elements to go vertically.\n\nFor example, if you continue to display dialog for a while, followed by the depiction of a character, you can make them seem to be deep in their own thoughts.\n\n2. Use the space between panels to create a dramatic effect\n\nYou shouldadjust the space in between panels and leave more room, to create a place for the reader to rest and focus on the text.\n\nDepending on the size of the space between panels, the perception of the action changes. Large spaces can also be used to indicate scene changes as a whole.\n\nComposition and style\n\nAs the Webtoon-format is based on scrolling, there is no page turning. This means that reading continues uninterrupted.\n\nIn order to not break the reading flow, it is helpful to reduce the text and use a simpler art style than in traditional comics.\n\nColor\n\nTo accommodate for smartphone screens, Webtoon-style comics are usually in color.\n\nThe area surrounding a panel is not limited to white. Black or a theme-based color is also quite common. Use color to expand your expression beyond panel borders.\n\nWhile in manga, screen tones and black areas are used to dramatize scenes and express time, Webtoons can make use of color for these aspects.\n\nFor example, instead of indicating a flashback with solid blacks or specific frame divisions, it can instead be expressed with sepia tones.\n\nDrawing a Webtoon-style comic\n\nSo you want to draw a comic in this style, but you may find it difficult to express the action in a vertical format and in color. However, you will find that there is a lot of new freedom for you to explore with scrolling and color.\n\nIf you are used to drawing illustrations, this might be a great challenge for you!\n\nHere are some pointers below of tips and tricks for drawing a Webtoon comic in Clip Studio Paint .\n\nCreating a vertical canvas\n\nThe recommended size for a vertical manuscript varies depending on the website you plan to upload your comic.\n\nThe width is usually based on a size that fits the general screen resolution of smartphones.\n\nThe height of a document usually only depends on the limitations of the website.\n\nExample:\n\nWidth: 800px\n\nHeight: 1280px\n\nNote: Based on the size specified by WEBTOON.\n\nIn Clip Studio Paint, you can find settings for Webtoon-style comics in the presets.\n\nIn the [New] dialog box, select [Webtoon] from [Project] to show settings for creating a webtoon canvas.\n\nSelect the most suitable canvas from [Preset] for the site you will post to.\n\nThe size of the canvas will vary depending on the site. If you don’t find the right setting in [Preset], you can freely set the canvas from [Width] and [Height] below.\n\nCheck out how it will look on smartphones\n\nFor vertical scrolling comics such as webtoons, adjusting the spacing of images and dialogue to fit the visible on-screen area of a smartphone can help readers read your work more effectively.\n\nClip Studio Paint has a [On-screen area (webtoon)] function that allows you to preview and check how the image will look on a smartphone.\n\nTurn on [View] menu > [On-screen area (webtoon)] to check how any part of a canvas looks on a smartphone screen.\n\nUse it for every stage of your work from sketch to finishing details.\n\nSplitting and exporting your work\n\nWhile files on Webtoon are displayed in the long, vertical scrolling format, each file for upload is limited to a maximum height of 1280px. The uploaded files are then displayed one after the other.\n\nHowever, creating a longer, vertical canvas enables you to check the overall composition and flow of the story. Cutting the canvas into the appropriate size for the upload afterwards helps you to keep an overview of the story.\n\nClip Studio Paint allows you to export your work into sections with a specified length.\n\nThese settings can be changed from [File] menu > [Export webtoon].\n\nCut the original long canvas into smaller images that are at most 1280px in height and save each file separately.\n\nUsing multiple windows to display the canvas\n\nWith such a long canvas, it is difficult to check the entire canvas when zoomed in for drawing.\n\nIf you use multiple windows in Clip Studio Paint to display the same file, you can view the canvas as a whole while also working on specific parts.\n\n▼ Open the Window menu > Canvas > New Window to create a separate view of the same document.\n\nSave frequently-used colors in a Color Set\n\nIt is convenient, when drawing the same characters over and over, to create color sets for them.\n\nAdd moods and dramatic effects with adjustment layers\n\nTry using adjustment layers, to vary the mood in your panels.\n\nFor example, you can add a gradient map and select the sepia gradient in the dialog box. This effect is often used for flashbacks.\n\nUsing materials\n\nWhen you use materials for backgrounds and effects, not only will you be able to change the overall expression of a scene, but you can do so more efficiently.\n\nClip Studio Paint offers the service Clip Studio Assets, where you can find a great variety of materials for download.\n\nUploading your file to a website\n\nOnce your Webtoon-style comic is finished, you can upload it just like you would with an illustration.\n\nCreating a full comic or manga for print is a lot of work, but when it comes to Webtoon-style comics, even a shorter story with fewer panels can be uploaded and reach an audience.\n\nIn the following, we will discuss a few points to consider when uploading your comic.\n\nCheck your document type and size\n\nBefore attempting to upload your comic, make sure to check the upload guidelines for the service you wish to use.\n\nSince changing the file type, and especially the file size, can take a lot of work, we recommend you decide on a suitable size, before you start drawing.\n\n– WEBTOON\n\nPanel size: 800px wide and 1280px long per image\n\nFile size: 2MB per image, total size up to 20MB, 72 dpi or higher is recommended\n\nImage format: jpg\n\n– Tapas.io\n\nPanel size: 940px wide and 4000px long per image\n\nFile size: up to 2MB per image, up to 40 images can be uploaded per episode\n\nImage format: jpg, png, gif\n\nGetting your comic in front of an audience and get it more popular\n\nWhen creating a comic and putting a lot of work into it, you probably want as many people as possible to read it.\n\nPopular and new comics will usually be displayed at the top of the site you uploaded it to.\n\nTo have more people pay attention to your work, try following the steps below.\n\nUpload regularly\n\nUse inviting titles, tags and feature images\n\nListen to feedback from your readers\n\nFinal checklist\n\n・Can you upload from a smartphone?\n\nMany platforms may only allow uploads from a desktop computer or an iPad.\n\nIf you only have a smartphone, make sure to check the website’s permitted devices.\n\n・Are you allowed to upload on multiple platforms?\n\nAs an individual publisher you are usually free to upload wherever you like. Try and get your story out there to the people who want to read it!\n\n・What are the content regulations?\n\nIn many cases, expressions contrary to public order and morals, as well as for-profit purposes are prohibited. Including private information or making defamatory claims of any sort within a story is usually forbidden.\n\nExtreme depictions of violence or other mature content may be restricted. Make sure to choose your platform based on the content you wish to publish.\n\nWe hope that this guide helped you along on your webtoon journey! Check out the articles linked at the top of the article for more tips on the actual execution of drawing your Webtoon."
