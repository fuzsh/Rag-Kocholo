        "text": "South Korean culture has become part of global culture in the last few decades in part due to the efforts of the South Korean government and part due to changes in how we consume media and how foreign cultural exports have become more accessible to audiences around the world. The Korean Wave (Hallyu) has brought Korean music (K-pop), Korean TV shows (K-dramas, in particular), and Korean cinema to audiences all over the world.\n\nBut why does South Korean cinema have such a global appeal and what is behind its success?\n\nIn this article, we'll look at the factors driving Korean cinema's global popularity and point you in the direction of some of Korean cinema's most popular movies.\n\nThe best Korean tutors available\n\n5 (12 reviews)\n\nEunsung\n\n$21\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n4.9 (7 reviews)\n\nTressia h.\n\n$35\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (4 reviews)\n\nYongwook\n\n$30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (4 reviews)\n\nGrace\n\n$50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (3 reviews)\n\nBenjamin\n\n$25\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (5 reviews)\n\nErica\n\n$40\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (3 reviews)\n\nYongeun\n\n$50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (1 reviews)\n\nJay\n\n$18\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (12 reviews)\n\nEunsung\n\n$21\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n4.9 (7 reviews)\n\nTressia h.\n\n$35\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (4 reviews)\n\nYongwook\n\n$30\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (4 reviews)\n\nGrace\n\n$50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (3 reviews)\n\nBenjamin\n\n$25\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (5 reviews)\n\nErica\n\n$40\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (3 reviews)\n\nYongeun\n\n$50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (1 reviews)\n\nJay\n\n$18\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\nLet's go\n\nThe Factors Behind Korean Cinema's Success\n\nThere's no single factor behind Korean cinema's success but rather a multitude of factors that are all helping Korean movies gain international recognition and popularity.\n\nWe're certainly not going to be able to cover all the factors behind it such as the geopolitics of Asia, the government of South Korea and all its economic and cultural policies, or how it uses culture to exert soft power in the area, but we still think these factors are among the most important and interesting.\n\nCritical Acclaim and Awards\n\nNothing helps a movie become popular like critical acclaim or winning movie awards. The South Korean movie Parasite, for example, was definitely helped by becoming the first Korean movie to win the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, winning 4 Oscars, and the first non-English-language movie to win Best Picture!\n\nWhile not everybody will automatically watch a movie because it wins an Academy Award, as critics and awards shows start paying more attention to Korean cinema, more people will naturally find Korean movies.\n\nCultural Exchange\n\nIt isn't by accident that Korean movies are being discovered by audiences and award shows. South Korea has actively promoted its cultural exports for decades as part of the Korean Wave and makes a concerted effort to ensure that music, cinema, TV, and many other aspects of Korean culture are enjoyed and experienced by audiences all over the world.\n\nThis not only helps these industries, but it helps South Korea politically, especially when it comes to fostering interest in Korean culture, gaining international investment, or even getting political deals done.\n\nDiverse Genres\n\nKorean cinema is far from being a singular genre and while there are trends and aspects of Korean cinema that occur quite commonly, Korean cinema doesn't stick to a singular genre.\n\nOne of the main appeals of Korean cinema is that there's something for everyone from romantic comedies to action movies, dramas, and thought-provoking social commentaries.\n\nEven if you didn't really enjoy the last Korean movie you saw, that doesn't mean you won't be able to find a movie that you do like.\n\nDiverse Storytelling\n\nMuch like the range of genres Korean cinema is famous for, Korean cinema is also famed for how it tells stories, often in ways that are quintessentially Korean while also being accessible to international audiences.\n\nThe relatability of Korean storytelling while also being a product of the country and culture from where it hails is what so many viewers enjoy about Korean cinema.\n\nThe same is also true of Korean television and K-dramas, which also cover a large number of different genres and are famed for their incredible storytelling and character development.\n\nInfluential Filmmakers\n\nAs the popularity of Korean cinema increases, so does the number of influential filmmakers and big names that can help promote it.\n\nIn the same way that American audiences look forward to new works from their favorite Hollywood directors, names like Bong Joon-ho, Park Chan-wook, and Kim Ki-duk (to name but a few) are becoming more well-known.\n\nStreaming and Social Media\n\nTechnological advances, social media, and streaming have all played a huge role in the Korean Wave and helped make not just Korean cinema, but also Korean music, particularly K-pop, and TV shows more popular all over the world.\n\nNot only do audiences have a broader range of movies that they can watch through popular streaming platforms, but they can also watch to their hearts' content and then immediately take to social media to tell all their friends and other fans of Korean cinema about it.\n\nSocial media buzz can both promote upcoming movies or drive new audiences to older Korean movies that are available to be watched on-demand through streaming services.\n\nWestern Adaptations\n\nThe popularity of Korean cinema has led to Western filmmakers becoming interested in making their own adaptations of the movies. It's difficult for a remake to be better than the original, but audiences that see the remakes are far more likely to discover the original.\n\nThe Most Popular South Korean Films\n\nNow that you know why South Korean cinema is so popular, you might be interested in watching a Korean movie. While we can't cater to everybody's tastes, here are some of the most popular Korean movies, and hopefully, there'll be something that you'd be interested in watching.\n\nAll of the movies we've picked are from the 21st century and while it's definitely worth looking into traditional Korean cinema, too, we think that some of these more recent movies provide a better starting point for people wanting to learn more about contemporary Korean culture and the Korean language, especially since they were all made in the period after the Korean government had started actively promoting their cultural exports around the world.\n\nMy Sassy Girl (2001)\n\nMy Sassy Girl is a romantic comedy and Korea's highest-grossing comedy at the time. The 2008 American remake featuring Elisha Cuthbert and Jesse Bradford went straight to DVD, but the original Korean version remains a must-see for fans of the genre looking to discover Korean cinema.\n\nOldboy (2003)\n\nOldboy is a revenge thriller that was loosely adapted from the Japanese manga “Old Boy”. The story follows a man who's abducted and imprisoned in a windowless hotel room for 15 years.\n\nThe movie was critically acclaimed, though it is a somewhat violent movie and something you might want to avoid if you're not into that kind of thing.\n\nThe Host (2006)\n\nThe Host is a Korean movie about a monster that starts attacking people from Seoul's Han River. When the film was released in 2006, it performed really well at the box office and has been lauded by critics.\n\nOde to My Father (2014)\n\nOde to My Father is an emotional drama film about an everyday man and covers South Korean history from the 1950s to the present. Though the movie was released nearly a decade ago, it's still one of the country's highest-grossing titles.\n\nIf you're interested in Korean history, this could be an excellent Korean movie to start with.\n\nVeteran (2015)\n\nVeteran is an action comedy movie about a police detective against a rich boy trying to use his wealth to get away with committing crimes. It's a fun movie but you can also gain a better understanding of Korean culture through it, because nothing explains people better than their sense of humor.\n\nThe Handmaiden (2016)\n\nThe Handmaiden is another movie by Park Chan-wook, the director of Old Boy. The movie takes place in 1930s Korea with an intriguing plot that includes crime, drama, and romance.\n\nTrain to Busan (2016)\n\nTrain to Busan is a zombie thriller with incredible storytelling and excellent action sequences. Because of the massive success of this movie, there was also an animated prequel and a standalone sequel, neither of which was able to match the success of the first installment.\n\nAlong with the Gods: The Two Worlds (2017) and Along with the Gods: The Last 49 Days (2018)\n\nThis fantasy action movie and its sequel are both hugely popular in Korea and around the world. It's about a firefighter who dies and has to be guided through the afterlife by three guardians.\n\nIf he can pass seven trials within 49 days, he'll be reincarnated.\n\nExtreme Job (2019)\n\nExtreme Job is an action comedy about detectives trying to save their jobs by hiding out in a chicken restaurant to bust a criminal gang.\n\nThe twist comes when their new recipe turns the failing eatery into one of the most popular places to eat, leaving them to manage the restaurant and try and catch the criminals.\n\nIt's the highest-grossing movie in Korea but the title of highest-grossing Korean movie worldwide belongs to our next movie.\n\nParasite (2019)\n\nThe 2019 Korean movie Parasite is probably the one that most people have heard of and not just because we mentioned it earlier in this article.\n\nThe movie made history because of the awards it won but it's also Korea's highest-grossing film of all time.\n\nThe movie's dark humor and social commentary resonated with audiences all over the world and at the time of writing, there's a TV series in development.\n\nLearn More About Korean Cinema with Korean Lessons\n\nTo really get the most out of Korean cinema, we'd recommend learning to speak Korean. It isn't an easy language to learn for English speakers, but you can always get help from private Korean tutors!\n\nYou can learn Korean with a face-to-face private tutor who'll tailor every session to you, what you like to learn, and what you need to know.\n\nYou could even learn Korean from a native Korean speaker in South Korea with online tutoring.\n\nMany Korean tutors on Superprof offer their first lesson for free so you can always try out a few different tutors before deciding which one is right for you and how you want to learn. Learning to speak any language, especially Korean, can take years of study so it's important you use the right resources and teachers.\n\nAs you learn the Korean language, you'll naturally learn more about Korean history and cultural practices and it should be noted that while Korean culture is certainly fascinating, it's multifaceted. Like anywhere else in the world, Koreans are individuals and while there are certainly cultural practices that will be shared by Koreans across the country, it's also important that you remember that the best way to learn about any culture is from the people who are part of it."
