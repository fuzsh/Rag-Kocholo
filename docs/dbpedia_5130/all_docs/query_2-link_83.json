        "text": "It's been another strong month for K-dramas in October, with the Netflix hit Extraordinary Attorney Woo having been in the streamer's ranking of top 10 non-English television series for at least 16 weeks.\n\nLittle Women, the Korean remake of the coming-of-age book/film of the same name starring Squid Game star Wi Ha-jun, has been in the top 10 for 7 weeks.\n\nHere we look at some of the upcoming compelling K-dramas and Korean films to binge-watch in November.\n\nLookism\n\nRelease date: November 4\n\nLookism is an animated K-drama series adaptation based on the South Korean webtoon of the same name, released in 2014. The show is the first work from WEBTOON, the world's largest digital comics platform, to be adapted for an original Netflix animation series, according to The Korea Times.\n\nThe new series is the latest work from Studio Mir, the team behind the Netflix originals The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf (an animation film spin-off of The Witcher television series starring Henry Cavill) and DOTA: Dragon's Blood animation series.\n\n\"Ever since I was born, I've been at the bottom of the food chain,\" a voice says in the show's official trailer. That all changes when high school student Hyeong-seok wakes up one day to find that he has \"a handsome face and a perfect body,\" Netflix says.\n\nFeaturing vivid, colorful scenes with \"gorgeous effects\" and a theme tune by K-pop band ATEEZ, Lookism touches on themes around materialism and other social issues in modern society, according to Netflix.\n\nThe Fabulous\n\nRelease date: November 4\n\nStarring Minho (the rapper/singer from K-pop boy group Shinee) and Chae Soo-bin (from Love in the Moonlight on Netflix), The Fabulous follows the lives of four best friends who navigate \"romantic dilemmas and wild nights on the town,\" while chasing their dreams in the cut-throat fashion industry, Netflix says.\n\nSet in Seoul, the bustling South Korean capital, the chic and stylish drama lends the feel of The Devil Wears Prada film, featuring fashion parties, tears, tantrums and \"gorgeous, elegant\" VIP guests, according to its trailer.\n\nBehind Every Star\n\nRelease date: November 7\n\nThe upcoming Netflix series is based on the French comedy drama series Call My Agent!. The Korean spin-off, starring Kwak Sun-young (from Encounter, VIP and Hospital Playlist on Netflix) and Joo Hyun-young (from Extraordinary Attorney Woo), follows the happenings at a talent firm as agents manage office politics and big personalities while trying to keep their celebrity clients happy.\n\nRevenge of Others\n\nRelease date: November 9\n\nThis revenge thriller series on Disney+, starring Lomon, also known as Park Solomon (from the hit Netflix zombie K-drama All of Us Are Dead), and Shin Ye-eun, sees a teenage girl get embroiled in a shocking incident while on a quest to uncover the truth behind the mysterious death of her twin brother, reported South Korea's News1.\n\n\"The reason why I've transferred to this school in Seoul is to find out who killed my brother,\" a voiceover says in the show's chilling trailer. \"Listen up you murderer! I'm definitely going to find you.\"\n\n\"I have warned you that later you'll face incidents that are far worse and even more unjust than now,\" another voice says in the trailer, which features pulsating car chases, body-slamming throwdowns and dramatic face-offs.\n\nDitto\n\nRelease date: November 16\n\nThis remake of the hit 2000 Korean science fiction fantasy film Ditto (which stars Yoo Ji-tae from Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area) sees two students from the same university living in different time periods connect with each other via an old radio during a total lunar eclipse in 1999 and 2022.\n\nStarring Cho Yi-hyun (from All of Us Are Dead) and Yeo Jin-goo (from Hotel Del Luna on Netflix), the latest film focuses on the \"characters' growth, their dreams and friendship,\" rather than the \"hopeless romance\" captured in the original work, the film's director Seo Eun-young explained at a press event, the Korea JoongAng Daily reported this month.\n\nSomebody\n\nRelease date: November 18\n\nThe new film sees a software developer of a dating app and her friends find themselves entangled in \"inexplicable issues surrounding a mysterious figure,\" according to Netflix.\n\nThe developer is drawn into a dark world of romance and murder mysteries after a serial killer uses the app to find his next targets.\n\n\"I just hate people who act like they are sophisticated, when, in fact, they are worthless,\" a voice says in the eerie trailer. In a scene in which two people are seen embracing in a bedroom, another voice cries out: \"Hold on, I can't breathe\" as the person struggles to break free.\n\nReborn Rich\n\nRelease date: November 18\n\nThe upcoming series, airing on South Korea's JTBC network and available on the Rakuten Viki streaming service, stars Song Joong Ki (known from Vincenzo, Descendents of the Sun, Arthdal Chronicles and Space Sweepers on Netflix) as Hyun-woo, a secretary overseeing risk management for a Korean conglomerate family who is killed by the family's youngest son.\n\nHe later finds that he has been reincarnated in the body of the youngest son of the family and a chilling revenge plot unfolds as he attempts to take over the giant family business group."
