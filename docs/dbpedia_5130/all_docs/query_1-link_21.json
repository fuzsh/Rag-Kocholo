        "text": "Have you ever read Korean webtoons before? These are like comic books but entirely digital; in short, they’re digital comics. They’ve become much more popular among Koreans than traditional comic books. They’ve grown to be a big industry with even global success and Netflix deals getting made.\n\nOne of the most exciting factors of a webtoon is that a new “episode” is released weekly. In comparison, you’d get a new issue of a comic book available to you only once a month.\n\nWhat are webtoons?\n\nThe word webtoon derives from the words “web” and “cartoon.” They are entirely digital, most commonly published on Naver and Daum, the top search engines in South Korea. You can access them directly on the website, or you can download an app for them.\n\nAre Korean webtoons popular?\n\nWebtoons are extremely popular in South Korea, especially among younger generations. Some factors contributing to its popularity are the accessibility and communication available for the readers to the artists. But above all, reading webtoons is entertaining!\n\nWhy would you enjoy reading a Korean webtoon?\n\nThere are multiple reasons why you would enjoy reading a webtoon! For example…\n\n1) They are a great additional source for finessing your Korean language skills. Even if you cannot instantly understand everything written down, the visual images will aid in knowing the context.\n\n2) They are easy to read anywhere, anytime. Because you can access them straight from your phone, you don’t need to burden yourself with a book or a Kindle in your bag. Reading webtoons is a great way to unwind on study breaks or while traveling by public transportation.\n\n3) They are visualized awesomely, just like how visuals in comic books would be but in a wholly digital form.\n\n4) They are not heavy on words. The dialogues aren’t complicated or rambling, and, again, the visual images are always there to give you the context clearly.\n\n5) You get to choose how fast or slow you read it. If you’re reading a caption five times before you’re ready to move on, that’s okay, and you’re in full control to do so.\n\n6) They tell stories about Korean culture. Like Korean dramas and movies, you’ll learn more about South Korea and Korean culture through webtoons. It’s also a great way to learn about the Korean language.\n\n7) They are entertaining! And for that simple reason, you’d enjoy reading them. Many favorite webtoons have also been made into movies and dramas, doubling the fun of consuming them.\n\nWhat are the most popular webtoons?\n\nIt may be impossible to point to a single webtoon as there are incredibly many options for you to choose from when choosing great webtoons. They come in all shapes and sizes today, meaning there are various genres and stories to choose from.\n\nBut to help narrow down your options, we’ve included below a few that are especially popular or that we otherwise think could offer you a great experience to the fans.\n\nAlong with the Gods\n\nKorean title: (신과 함께 ㅣ singwa hamkke)\n\nAlong with the Gods is especially intriguing as it has a structure of three different stories, each of which is released separately, taking place in their own world. The first story focuses on the underworld, the second one takes place in the world of the living, and the third story tells you about the gods.\n\nTwo movies have been made of this webtoon, making each movie popular up to this date!\n\nMisaeng/Incomplete Life\n\nKorean title: (미생 | Misaeng)\n\nThe English translation of misaeng (미생) would be “Incomplete life.” It tells the story of Jang Geurae, who, after failing at his first job, begins working in an office, despite having no qualifications for the job.\n\nHis story depicts many different aspects of a regular office worker’s life in Korea. That’s why this became so popular that a TV series starring the Kpop idol Im Siwan from ZE:A was created, also reaching explosive popularity among viewers.\n\nLookism\n\nKorean title: (외모지상주의 ㅣ oemojisangjuui)\n\nLookism is an interesting story of a school student who is often regarded as the ugliest student in his school. However, his life changes entirely when he happens to acquire a second body, of someone who is seemed incredibly handsome, even perfect.\n\nThis high school student then can change between his two bodies by going to sleep, leading him into interesting situations.\n\nTrue Beauty\n\nKorean title: (여신강림 ㅣ yeosingangnim)\n\nThis tells the story of a shy teenage girl who becomes a pretty girl sensation in her school overnight after mastering how to apply make-up by binge-watching several online beauty videos. She decided on this makeover so she no longer gets bullied by high school students for her appearance.\n\nNow she has to keep her true identity a secret from her friends and worries whether the cute guy she has her eyes on could handle knowing who she truly is. The live-action drama version of this webtoon is as entertaining to watch!\n\nNoblesse\n\nKorean title: (노블레스 ㅣ nobeulleseu)\n\nAt the center of the fantasy webtoon story of Noblesse is a character named Rai, who has to start attending present-day high school after 820 years of slumber. Not only does he have to navigate the life of an ordinary high school student, but he continues to find himself in the middle of various dangerous adventures.\n\nMy Secret Brother\n\nKorean title: (말할 수 없는 남매 ㅣ malhal su eomneun nammae)\n\nOn her very first day of starting at a new school, Hanmi tells a lie for the sake of getting somebody’s attention. Unfortunately, she had not thought of how far that lie would carry. And now she’s finding herself in a situation where the whole school thinks she’s dating Junhyuk.\n\nThe problem in the story is that Junhyuk is actually her brother!\n\nMy ID is Gangnam Beauty\n\nKorean title: (신의 탑 ㅣ nae IDneun gangnammiin)\n\nThis webtoon-based series tells the story of a young girl named Kang Mirae. Because she has received humiliation due to her appearance, she decides to have plastic surgery. However, at university, she now ends up being ridiculed for that plastic surgery.\n\nOver the course of the webtoon, she journeys on to find and build her self-esteem and perhaps even romance. This has gained popularity and has been adapted as a K-drama starring one of Korea’s most popular leading men.\n\nTales of the Unusual\n\nKorean title: (기기괴괴 | gigigoegoe)\n\nIf you’re a fan of the scary genre comics, you’ll surely love this.

A romance genre is often paired with another genre like drama, comedy, or fantasy. Some popular webtoons under this genre are True Beauty, Love Olympus, and Cheese in the Trap.\n\nHorror Webtoons\n\nThis is another popular genre because even if a webtoon is not animated or doesn’t have sound effects in a movie, it can still be terrifying.

This is the term generally used to refer to comics and printed cartoons in Korea. Due to the similarities between Japan’s manga and Korea’s manhwa, a manhwa is often referred to as Korean manga.\n\nKorean Manhwa vs. Korean Webtoons\n\nBoth Korean manhwa and webtoons provide entertainment in the form of comics. However, Korean manhwa specifically refers to printed ones, while webtoons are digital comics.\n\nKorean Webtoons vs. Japanese Manga\n\nNow, let’s go to webtoons and Japanese manga. Both the webtoons from Korea and manga from Japan bring entertainment to their readers through stories with amazing visual art. But what makes them different?\n\nAccessibility\n\nFirst, webtoons are mostly accessible on the web only. This means that there are no printed copies available unless artists make a deal with a publishing company. On the other hand, Japanese comics or mangas are more traditional and are normally printed but are also becoming available digitally in recent years.\n\nReading Format\n\nAnother noticeable difference between the two is their reading format. Webtoons are in a vertical webtoon format, so you will be scrolling downward as you progress. The reason behind this is to make it easy to read on the phone and to carry along than a book. Japanese manga is read from right to left, so the first page is the usual last page of a book.\n\nAdaptations\n\nLastly, some webtoons and Japanese mangas may also have adaptations. Normally, webtoons can be adapted as a K-drama or movie, while mangas have been adapted into anime.\n\nWrap Up"
