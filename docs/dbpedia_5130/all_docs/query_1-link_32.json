        "text": "Annyeonghaseyo (안녕하세요)! It's no secret that the Korean language can be a challenging language to learn, and it's only natural that you'll need to have the right resource material to help you progress.\n\nYou probably know by now that watching K-Dramas is a great way to help you improve your listening skills and learning vocabulary. If you need some tips on what to watch, check out our awesome Best Kdramas to watch on Netflix post.\n\nBut what about your reading and writing skills? Many Korean learners struggle to find written content online to assist them with learning Korean. Fortunately, Korean webtoons are a great way to access content in writing. They can be used as an effective tool for learning Korean in a way that is not only fun but also engaging.\n\nIn this post, you'll find some of the best Korean webtoons online.\n\nAnd, to make yours an all-around language learning experience, why not check us out at Lingopie? We're an innovative platform to study Korean with TV shows and movies.\n\nWhat are Korean Webtoons?\n\nKorean webtoons are a form of manga (manhwa) that is native to South Korea and that is only available online. Webtoons are essentially South Korean comics that come in digital form only.\n\nKorean webtoons differ from Japanese comics in that they're more colorful and more visually intense.\n\nWebtoons come in a very convenient form, which is ideal for language learning. You can read webtoons online on your phone, just by scrolling down, so there's no need to turn any pages.\n\nWhere to find Korean Webtoons\n\nYou can find webtoons on the Naver and Daum apps. The Naver webtoon app is where most popular webtoon artists publish their work.\n\nNaver's webtoons are more appropriate for beginners too, whilst Daum is more suitable for intermediate learners.\n\nAn interesting fact is that Daum is also owned by the same company that owns KakaoTalk, a messaging app that's popular in South Korea.\n\nBenefits of Learning the Korean Language with Webtoons\n\n💡\n\nReading webtoons will help you to learn everyday life expressions, and have fun while doing so! Being entertained will help optimize your learning.\n\nYou can learn about language and Korean culture by studying how webtoon characters react in a range of situations. In addition, you'll get a sense of how native Korean speakers actually speak in daily life.\n\nApart from their practicality, Korean webtoons are an effective form of language learning content, since the text is accompanied by images.\n\nYou can follow the story visually, whilst you decipher the meaning of the words. This way, you'll learn how to read Hangul.\n\nYou can also find different genres and material for different levels and vocabulary.\n\nUltimately, it's an entertaining way to become familiar with the Korean alphabet even if you're not a fan of anime and manga.\n\nHow to Learn Korean with Webtoons\n\nActively or passively\n\nIf you choose to just sit back and read the stories for fun as a form of light reading, you'll be learning passively, which means that your brain will absorb the vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structures subconsciously.\n\nIf you'd like to turn your reading session into an active learning experience, you'll write down new words, or even a whole sentence that may be useful, and you'll consciously work on it by looking it up.\n\nCheck out the English version if you're at a beginner level\n\nIf you're just starting on your path to learning Korean, then you might want to check out the English translation of the webtoon stories you decide to read.\n\nHowever, don't rely too much on the English version as you progress so that you don't stunt your growth.\n\nDon't just pick the first webtoon you see\n\nOnce you improve, you can start to search for more complex storylines. As a Korean learner, being strategic about which webtoons to read can take you a long way.\n\nBe sure to start by reading webtoons that are easier to follow and that employ simple daily conversations that will help you to understand the story.\n\nLook up the meaning of new Korean words and phrases\n\nIf you've decided to make the most out of your language learning experience and make your study session an active one, you can look up the meaning of what you've written down so far, so you can consolidate your new vocabulary.\n\nMoreover, you can also study and adopt certain sentences, expressions, and phrases so as to incorporate them into your own speech. This will help you to communicate like native Korean speakers.\n\nTake your time with each episode\n\nHow long you spend on each chapter will determine how much you can get out of the webtoon linguistically. So, be sure to go in-depth with each story.\n\nChoosing webtoons that are collections of short stories will be helpful to do this.\n\nThe Best Webtoons to Learn Korean\n\nNow let's check out the list of Korean webtoons we've put together as a resource to help you organize and plan your Korean studies.\n\n1.
