        "text": "Park Will Produce First English-Language Series Adaptation of The Film for Lionsgate\n\nSANTA MONICA, CA, April 17, 2024 – Lionsgate Television is partnering with renowned Korean filmmaker and television creator Park Chan-wook to develop his acclaimed film Oldboy for television, marking the first English-language series adaptation of the iconic property. Park, who directed and co-wrote the original film, is attached to produce the series along with producing partner Syd Lim.\n\nOldboy has earned numerous accolades, becoming the first South Korean film to win the Grand Prix at Cannes in 2004 and named to numerous lists of the greatest movies of all time. The movie was re-released last year for its 20th anniversary, landing in the top ten at the domestic box office in its opening week, a rare feat for a re-release. Adapted from a Japanese manga of the same name, the film follows a man who is released from prison after 15 years, only to find that he must find his captor in five days. The film is part of Park’s Vengeance trilogy, which includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.\n\nOne of world cinema’s most revered creative voices, Park is also known for directing The Handmaiden, Decision to Leave, for which he won Best Director at Cannes, Stoker and Thirst, as well as producing both the film and television series Snowpiercer. Now an accomplished creative force in television, he is producing as well as directing The Sympathizer, starring Robert Downey, Jr., which just premiered on HBO.\n\n“Lionsgate Television shares my creative vision for bringing Oldboy into the world of television,” said Park. “I look forward to working with a studio whose brand stands for bold, original and risk-taking storytelling.”\n\n“Park is one of the most visionary storytellers of our generation, and we’re excited to partner with him in bringing his cinematic masterpiece to the television screen,” said Scott Herbst, EVP and Head of Scripted Development, Lionsgate Television. “This series adaptation of Oldboy will feature the raw emotional power, iconic fight scenes and visceral style that made the film a classic.”\n\nExecutives Courtney Mock and Tara Joshi are overseeing the project for Lionsgate Television, and Bryan Weiser negotiated the deal.\n\nPark is represented by WME, Industry Entertainment and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.\n\nAbout Lionsgate\n\nLionsgate (NYSE: LGF.A, LGF.B) encompasses world-class motion picture and television studio operations and the STARZ premium global subscription platform, bringing a unique and varied portfolio of entertainment to consumers around the world.
