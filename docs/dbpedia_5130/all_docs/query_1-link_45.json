Korean webtoon companies are emerging as major players in the global comic content market, disrupting traditional norms and captivating audiences worldwide.\n\nSales in the South Korean webtoon industry surged to KRW 1.83 trillion (USD 1.3 billion) in 2022, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth, according to a study by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Creative Content Agency.

Naver Corp’s Line Manga and Kakao Corp’s Piccoma have become Japan’s highest-grossing mobile apps outside of gaming.\n\nOne key factor contributing to the favorability of Korean webtoons is the free-reading service offered by most apps, supplemented by in-app currency called coins.
