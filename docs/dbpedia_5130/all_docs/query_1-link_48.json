        "text": "Ok so Iâm going to try and be quick. I absolutely love love love webtoon. I know fast pass is annoying because you have to wait so long but it really is worth it because there are literally so many amazing storyâs for whatever you like. I was actually going to give this a 5 star review until it glitched. Iâm reading this super great story called âMy Deepest Secretâ witch is soooooooooo good and probably one of my favorite storyâs. But... Iâve been waiting seven days for the next one to come out because of fast pass and itâs felt like forever because I love this story and the episode before the one coming out ended at a cliffhanger so I was so excited. it said it would come out in like 8 house yesterday in the morning. I forgot about that and looked to read it today. I go and it says 7 days still. it didnât come out it says I have to wait another seven days!!! Iâm really mad about this because I donât spend money on storyâs and now I have to wait longer because of a stupid glitch the app had. If anyone is reading this who wants to get this app you totally should because itâs amazing and this is really the first time this has ever happened. I donât like complaining really but I just wanted to write this mostly for the people who made the app because I am sad and mad about what happened and just really wanna read my book. Please try and make sure these glitches never happen again cause it really made me disappointed. Thank you so much.\n\nWow! I canât say enough good things about this app. I have been using webtoon daily since 2015 and while a lot of things have changed since then it is still my favorite app of all time. The amount of selection you have is fantastic and all the webtoons are completely free which is great considering similar apps have you pay per chapter and itâs incredibly expensive to read a whole story. The webtoons have amazing plot lines and impressive art and I canât get enough of it. Recently webtoon started adding daily pass to completed stories and some ongoing series and Iâve seen a lot of complaints about this new feature. And while im not the biggest fan of it either considering you could read unlimited chapters for free without having to wait for a daily passâ¦ you still can read everything for free so itâs not the worst thing in the world and it gives a way for the creators to be supported. In the past few years Iâve gone through periods where I wasn't doing the best mentally and reading was the only thing I had to look forward too (and served as an amazing distraction). Im really happy that this app exist and I will continue to read every day so if youâre still looking at the reviews STOP and just hit install.\n\nPs. If youâre new and looking for a few recommendationsâ¦ in no particular order (Eleceed, Lore Olympus, Devil number 4, Remarried Empress, Tower of god, and unholy blood)\n\nI have been using webtoon for over a year now and I canât imagine life without it. This amount of time, however, has exposed some of the most glaring issues with the app. The first being: Daily pass, daily pass was simply pretty annoying at first, because completed series would be impossible to binge, so I just wouldnât. The issue has exploded now that brand new series are daily passing their series, I am not sure if that is something webtoon decides or the author but every time I see a new interesting series then click on in to see the daily pass sign, I immediately thing âthe audacity!? Your series hasnât even started and your already interrupting the flow of binging?!â I assume daily pass must have some kind of financial incentive for the author, which in theory I donât mind, but it is just too inconvenient. I am at the point that I just wonât read any series that has daily pass. Second issue: battery drain, this one could be specific to me, but Iâve noticed that webtoon is extremely draining on my phone battery. My theory is that having a bunch of episodes rendered (all the ones opened while the app is opened, even the ones not being read at the moment) is taking up too much data processing power. Other than that webtoon is amazing, but those two concerns are spoiling the enjoyment."
