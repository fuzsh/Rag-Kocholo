        "text": "Filmmaking is telling stories through motion pictures. The use of storytelling to convey a plot and construct a narrative has existed since the introduction of film, from the silent eras to modern times of technological advancements in film and media. Before technological inventions like the camera and other recording devices, literature, and writing had been in existence. Writing became a way of preserving history, culture, and civilization. Presently, the literary world is booming and improving now more than ever. The introduction of self-publishing has no doubt contributed to the expansion of literature. This essay explores the concept of book-to-screen adaptation with a concentration on Korean Webtoons and Manhwa dramas and the potential for Nigerian filmmakers and industry. Webtoon Analysis Service, a data provider, states that there are over 14,000 webtoons created by 9,900 creators in South Korea alone. Through their webtoon units, tech companies Naver and Kakao are aiming for global expansion and facilitating film adaptations to global audiences. This is a testament to the huge potential of adapting literary work into films for a global audience. The economic and financial gains are immeasurable, Nollywood, Nigeria's film industry currently sits as the second largest film industry in the world, ahead of Hollywood and below Bollywood. Nollywood contributes up to 5% of Nigeria's GDP with more than 300 million films produced annually. Despite these huge numbers, and successful movies like Half of a Yellow Sun, The Wedding Party, King of Boys, and Lionheart Nollywood for the majority of their productions still lacks good stories, complexity, and depth in films and are yet to tap into the huge opportunity of adapting literary works into films for global consumption. The influx of giant streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime in Nigeria presents an opportunity that should be explored. The successful adaptations of webtoons into dramas and films has led to a rise in sales of the Korean web-based comic market to 1.6 trillion won (US$1.3 billion) in 2021, up nearly 50% from the previous year, according to the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA), a bureau in charge of overseeing South Korea's cultural content.\n\nA brief history of literature in Nigeria and South Korea.\n\nFrom primordial times, when man learned how to communicate with each other, and build communities, history was preserved through storytelling. Folklores, myths, and songs were creative methods through which history and traditions were preserved for generations. Nigeria, often referred to as the Giant of Africa practiced this form of storytelling, its rich literary tradition in local dialects dates back centuries before the European invasion and the use of the English language. Literature was practiced in the form of orature that later evolved into written form. The first published Nigerian novel written in the English language was Amos Tutuola's The Palm-Wine Drinkard in 1952. Other books had been written prior in local dialects such as Igbo and Yoruba. Though attempts at adapting literary works into films in Nigeria date back to the 1970s when Ossie Davies adapted Wole Soyinka's Kongi's Harvest into a film. However, it is Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart published in 1958 and adapted to film in 1987 that gained immense success and has become a reference for many scholars about film and literature in Nigeria. The Nigerian literary industry has evolved and expanded, and the establishment of self-publishing platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, Rakuten, and Okadabooks have contributed to its growth. New novelists are emerging, and notable authors like Chimamanda Adichie, Buchi Emecheta, and Wole Soyinka continue to create literary works that appeal to the global audience.\n\nSimilarly, Korean written literature is categorized into three parts; works written in the early transcription system, works written in Chinese, and those written in Hangul. Though Korea had its language, during the Three Kingdoms periods between 57BC-668 AD, literary works were written in Chinese characters as Korean literature was heavily influenced by Chinese literature. Korean literature derived its primary narrative source from mystical folktales, myths, and legends. Thematic structures of the myths were based on the Sun and the Moon and the lives of ancient kings. The legends explored places and the natural world. The folktales touched on stories about animals such as goblins, ogres, and supernatural beings. In recent times, webtoons and manhwas have become extremely popular in Korea and globally. The term Webtoon is a mix of two words, web, and cartoon, and was coined in the early 2000s in South Korea when two of the country's major internet portals, Daum and Naver focused on publishing free, web-only comics on their platforms. With the influx of smartphones, comic webtoons gained immense popularity and became readily accessible, today it is one of the world's most popular forms of entertainment. In 2020, Webtoons generated over $744 million in revenue according to a report by the Korea Creative Content Agency. The style of adapting comics to the screen is gaining momentum, the Nigerian film industry must explore ways to catch on the trend and learn from their Korean contemporaries.\n\nThe process of book-to-screen adaptation.\n\nAn adaptation refers to retelling an old story in a new media form. Original concepts are expanded upon, converting an old story to a new work. Welsh and Morawaki (32) posit that film adaptation \"is necessarily an interpretation of the original (novel), with the (novelist's) language and themes filtered through the mind and imagination of the film director and his team of collaborators\". It is the style of converting a literary piece of work, such as a novel and in the case of this essay, a comic book into a cinematic form such as a film or television series. Often, filmmakers struggle with staying faithful to the material source as adaptation entails the recreation of a work but telling the story differently, it is portraying the same ideas but differently through situation and time. Adaptation is a multifaceted and challenging form of filmmaking as directors are often burdened with figuring out how to balance the demands of cinema and remaining true to the source material.\n\nA review on successful Korean book-to-screen adaptation.\n\nIn recent years, adapting Korean Webtoons and manhwas has become a popular trend in the Korean film industry. This is due to the immense success of many film adaptations on streaming services. These films have gained international acclaim, and have successfully appealed to a global audience despite the films being made in Hangul, Korean language. These films are also praised for their compelling stories and production quality. Book-to-screen adaptations have also been influenced by the mega popularity of Korean culture, lifestyle, music, and people across the globe making their dramas marketable. Also, Korean filmmakers have over time been willing to venture and experiment with different dramatic genres and formats. The success of webtoon adaptations did not happen overnight. Korea witnessed the premier of screen adaptations of Webtoons as far back as the 2000s. Dasepo Naughty Girls and Apt, webtoon adaptations failed to be smash hits as they flopped beyond expectations. Despite this poor start, webtoon-based films and dramas made a comeback and rose to be game changers, films like Incomplete Life, The Along with the Gods: Two Worlds, and others were box office hits and reached high viewer ratings on cable television. More than 17 years since it started, webtoon to film adaptations, a once risky investment, has become a popular choice for producers.\n\nWebtoons refer to digital comics found on the web that can be consumed online while manhwa are printed comic books. Webtoons and manhwa are released in series and are popular because they are an easily accessible and low-cost form of entertainment. The use of smartphones has made it more convenient for people to easily access Webtoons anywhere, unlike years ago when they had to borrow them from rental stores. They also explore diverse genres and themes. Genres such as thriller, fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery are explored. Themes such as love, friendship, and political and social issues that appeal to the young generation of readers are employed by the writers.\n\nOver the years, there have been numerous book-to-screen adaptations that have garnered critical acclaim and commercial success globally. Notable examples of successful adaptations are:\n\nThe Handmaiden is a 2016 movie based on Sarah Waters's novel Fingersmith. The Handmaiden is a psychological thriller that explores themes of deception, desire, and class struggle in the 1900s period in Korea. The movie reviewed numerous awards including the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nParasite (2019) is a dark comedy thriller inspired by Charles Burns's graphic novel, The Glass Castle. The film depicts the stark contrast between the rich and poor in contemporary South Korea. The film became a global hit winning four Academy Awards including Best Picture.\n\nTrain to Busan is another successful film adapted from a comic of the same name. This action-horror film follows a group of passengers fighting for survival during a zombie apocalypse on a high-speed train. The film became a global box office hit grossing over $200 million worldwide.\n\nItaewon Class is a 2020 series based on the webtoon of the same name. It follows the lives of a group of social misfits working at a bar in Itaewon, a multicultural district in Seoul, South Korea. Itaewon Class was a sensational hit worldwide and is one of the highest-ranked dramas on Netflix.\n\nThe King's Affection is a 2021 historical drama Inspired by the webtoon of the same name. This historical drama portrays a young woman who disguises herself as her twin brother to ascend to the throne. The series gained popularity for its gender-bending storyline, captivating performances, and lavish production.\n\nOther notable mentions include True Beauty, Hell is Other People (Strangers from Hell, Uncanny Encounter, My Girlfriend is a Gumiho, and Sweet Home.\n\nThese examples highlight the versatile genres of Korean book-to-screen adaptations. From psychological thrillers to dark comedies to romance, historical dramas to zombie apocalypse epics. Each film uses its source materials in a fresh, unique, and creative way to drive its narrative. These adaptations have received positive reviews, garnered audience appreciation and successfully connected with a global, diverse audience. They have also been lauded for their high production quality, compelling narratives, and colorful characters and have immensely contributed to promoting Korean culture.\n\nThe Nigerian film industry and lessons to learn from the Korean film industry: a comparative analysis.\n\nThe Nigerian film industry may currently have a distant relationship with book adaptations as most filmmakers rely on developing new stories rather than source materials from literary work, nevertheless, they have successfully adapted stories to screen. Chimamanda Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun, a historical drama about two sisters' perspectives of the Nigerian Biafran war in 2013 received global recognition and numerous awards. Beasts of No Nation, a film adapted from the novel of the same name by Uzodinma Iweala, is a raw and unflinching portrayal of war's impact on children. It follows the journey of a boy's transformation into a child soldier during the Sierra Leone civil war. Sefi Atta's Swallow was adapted into a film by Nigerian director Kunle Afolayan in 2021. It is a psychological thriller that follows a heroine, Tolani Ajao who is entangled in a drug trafficking scheme. Swallow was praised for its plot, performance, and exploration of Nigerian social issues. Other notable mentions include The King's Horseman from Wole Soyinka's play Death and the King's Horseman, Maami by Femi Osifisan adapted by Tunde Kelani, and Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart.\n\nThere are major areas Nigerian filmmakers can take notes from their Korean contemporaries in adapting books to films.\n\nNigerian filmmakers need a mentality shift about film as an art rather than a business. One of the major problems of Nollywood is that filmmaking is perceived more from a market perspective than a dramatic and creative perspective. Although this has helped the market grow commercially, it has stunted its growth in terms of creativity. For most Nollywood producers, films are a commodity to be sold and not a creative endeavor. However, this mindset has in recent times been challenged by the emergence of art and creativity-centered film directors and producers like Tunde Kelani, Kunle Afolayan, Kemi Adetigba, Kenneth Gyang, Jade Osiberu, and others. A large part of Nollywood still churns out content with the sole intent of making as many box office returns as possible or the detriment of the shelf life. For Korean filmmakers, more thought is put into deciding themes and narrative structures for their webtoon to film adaptations. Because webtoon-based dramas take their source from comics that people have read, a lot more effort is put into film production to gain public interest. Though there have been certain instances where viewers were let down by the production quality of anticipated dramas, the ratio to well-produced and thought-out dramas is comparably higher.\n\nNollywood filmmakers need to explore different genres aside from romance and comedy. There is a lot of room and potential for Nigerian filmmakers to explore different genres and themes as Nigeria boasts a rich and diverse pool of literary talent and traditions. From classic novels to contemporary literature, to dystopian and sci-fi narratives, Nigeria has a large pool of creative materials waiting to be adopted for the big screen. Webtoons are a popular material source for adaptations because they often inspire creativity. Webtoons and manhwas have been a way for writers to create stories without thought to production cost because they don't have any restrictions on their imagination, webtoon writers can create innovative ideas and write unusual and interesting stories. Korean webtoons often explore universal themes that resonate with both the local and global audience. This ability to appeal to viewers and connect on an emotional level is key to achieving global success.\n\nNollywood filmmakers can also take cues from Korean filmmakers on story and character development. Korean book-to-screen adaptations are typically admired for their strong plot and character development, which makes their story and characters more relatable and engaging to audiences. Filmmakers in Nollywood should strive to give characters complex motivations and goals and develop round characters. One major factor that makes Korean adaptations popular is their ability to strike a good balance between staying true to the source material when adapting for the film medium. They often demonstrate a deep understanding of the source material and carefully translate the essence of the novels into their adaptations. The storyline or ending of an adaptation may change, however, they have over time learned how to pay rapt attention to plot structure, character development, and the overall essence of the original works in their adapted versions. This has in turn created a sense of trust with the audience in the ability of the filmmakers to do a good job in adapting their favorite webtoons, and anticipate their works.\n\nThe need to invest in high production value cannot be overemphasized. Perhaps this is why comedy and melodramas are the safe options for many Nigerian filmmakers as they often struggle with production costs and finding the necessary funds to carry out big productions. Korean manhwa drama adaptations are marked by their high production quality which includes cinematography, editing, and special effects, no wonder Parasite won an Academy Award for Best Pictures at the 92nd Academy Awards Ceremony. They often employ visual artistry, elaborate sets, and sophisticated costumes to bring their stories to life, which enhances the storytelling experience and contributes to the success of the adaptations. Korean filmmakers also struggle with high production costs in reality but have found a way around it with collaborations with streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and others. Nigeria has the opportunity to utilize this factor also as giant streaming platforms are looking for ways to penetrate the African market and strive to produce films, and television series with similar production quality.\n\nKorean webtoon adaptations have not only inspired storytelling, it have also had a huge economic impact on the South Korean creative industry. K-dramas have continuously successfully appealed to international audiences transcending cultural and language barriers. The Nigerian music industry currently is penetrating international shores in the form of Afrobeats and so can its films. Nigeria and Africa as a whole have a large diasporic audience hungry for authentic content. Nigerian filmmakers should strive to work with materials with global appeal and adaptation of African literary works can help them achieve this. The Nigerian film industry can utilize adaptations as a means to foster economic and cultural exports. Adaptations of indigenous writers' work will help the younger generation understand their history and appreciate their culture and in the process, help reshape the African narrative globally. With the influence of major streaming platforms like Netflix, and Amazon Prime which are constantly encouraging indigenous African stories and adaptations, Nigerian cinema can play a role as a cultural ambassador promoting African heritage globally.\n\nIn conclusion, Nigerian literature is a good source for film narratives and despite its growth, filmmakers have yet to utilize it as a tool to drive storytelling in their films. Book-to-screen adaptations are still underutilized and explored in the African creative industry. In South Korea, when producers and directors need good scenarios and plots, they often turn to webtoons for inspiration and source materials. The global practice of book-to-screen has been a game changer in the creative industry around the globe, from America to Japan to Korea. Korean webtoon dramas with their impressive track record offer invaluable lessons for the Nigerian filmmaking space. In Korea, more than thirty webtoons have been adapted to films, and animations over two years with different degrees of success beyond small and big screens. The continuous growth and success of webtoon adaptations show that adapting literary works is not limited to specific industries or cultures. Nigeria can also leverage its literary wealth to create compelling films for the global audience. This practice also helps bring Nigerian literature to a wider audience as well as contributes to advancing the reputation of Nigerian cinema as a powerful medium for storytelling and cultural expression. This is the age of the African storyteller and it is wise for Nigerian writers and filmmakers to not be left behind and ride the wave of book-to-screen adaptations. By adapting novels to film and television, Nigerian filmmakers can attract new investment and negotiate better deals from investors such as streaming platforms and distribution channels. By following the lessons of Korean webtoons to film adaptations, Nigerian filmmakers can benefit from their experience in terms of balancing creativity, maintaining standards, gaining global appeal, tapping into economic opportunities, and promoting their unique cultural identity.\n\nWorks Cited.\n\nAdewale, A. \"The Challenges and Opportunities of Adapting Nigerian Novels to Film.\" Journal of African Cinemas, vol. 10, no. 1, 2019, pp. 1-15.\n\nBook Review: The Korean Wave: Evolution, Fandom, and Transnationality.
