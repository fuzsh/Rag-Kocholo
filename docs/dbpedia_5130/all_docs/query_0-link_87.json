        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nIt's precisely eight fifty-five.\n\nJoshua steps into the lecture hall, the golden rays of spring caressing his velvety skin. His soft auburn mullet is impeccably styled, complementing his navy dress shirt that accentuates his agile omega physique. A beige knitted scarf drapes gracefully around his collar. Each step he takes is a masterpiece, embodying the art of the gods themselves.\n\nThe hall buzzes softly with the murmurs of students, some already riveted by the presence of the young, enthusiastic professor.\n\nThe whiteboard behind him is covered with notes from previous lectures.\n\nJoshua glances at his watch, his arm raised and the sleeve neatly folded, exuding a mix of elegance and anticipation.\n\nThe clock strikes nine. Joshua clears his throat, instantly capturing the students' attention. The room falls into pin-drop silence. His warm smile puts everyone at ease.\n\nWith a fluid motion, he reaches for his breast pocket and places his glasses on the bridge of his nose.\n\nWhispers ripple through the hall about how tempting he looks with the glasses, while some might argue they obscure his captivating fawn chocolate eyes.\n\nThough it's only his second month at the Hanseong University of Excellence, Joshua's popularity is no joke. His status as an unmated young omega adds to his allure.\n\nIn society, being an omega often reduces one to a breeding tool in the eyes of many. At first glance, people often label them as such. It's why many parents' faces darken when their child is designated an omega at sixteen.\n\nThe once-sweet sixteen becomes a gateway to a hellish existence for many, but Joshua holds a different perspective.\n\nHe is a constructive, confident male omega who knows how to bring out the best in every situation. He never saw his sub-gender as an insult; instead, he takes pride in it.\n\nBeing an omega offers many advantages, or at least that's how Joshua sees it. People should be judged by their deeds, not by a sub-gender beyond their control. This is the mantra Joshua Hong lives by.\n\nPeople may throw subtle jabs at him, but they pale in comparison to his list of achievements.\n\nHe loves to groom himself, both physically and mentally. He is the epitome of elegance.\n\nHe believes the individual scent is the ultimate evidence.\n\nJoshua’s omega scent is a harmonious blend of elegance, freshness, and warmth, with a touch of personal uniqueness. It’s designed to be both alluring and approachable, enhancing his presence and reflecting his stylish, confident nature.\n\n\"Good morning, everyone. Hope you're all doing well,\" Joshua says, flashing his professional smile.\n\nThe students respond, some greeting him back.\n\n\"Over the last two weeks, we've delved into poetic analysis. So, why not shift gears today, much like the changing season? How about we dive into medieval literature? What do you think?\" he suggests expectantly.\n\nThis is his style of lecturing—engaging in dialogue with the students.\n\nHis eyes meet the eager sparks in the students' eyes. It’s a yes.\n\nHe knows it. Every literature devotee has felt the allure of the Renaissance and Medieval eras at least once. For Joshua, if you don’t love it, you can’t truly savour the richness of literature.\n\n\"Today, we’re diving into the world of Geoffrey Chaucer, often hailed as the 'Father of English literature.' We’ll be focusing on his most famous work—can anyone guess?\"\n\nJulie, an exchange student, raises her hand confidently.\n\n\"The Canterbury Tales,\" she states, her voice steady and assured. Joshua loves confident people.\n\nAt this moment, at least the front row can catch the hint of Joshua’s cedarwood scent. He nods approvingly.\n\nHe turns to the whiteboard and writes Geoffrey Chaucer in perfect cursive, marking it with double quotation marks for emphasis.\n\nAll eyes follow their professor’s movements. Notebooks open, pens poised.\n\nThis is the advantage Joshua boasts about. Whatever others may call it, he commands attention wherever he goes. His aura—omega or not—captures everyone's focus, holding them spellbound.\n\n\"Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales in Middle English. It's a collection of 24 stories presented as part of a storytelling contest by a group of pilgrims. Now, can anyone tell me why this work is so significant?\" he asks, leaning back against the wooden table, arms crossed over his chest.\n\nJulie practically leaps in her seat as she raises her hand, reminding Joshua of Hermione Granger. He extends his hand, gesturing for her to speak.\n\n\"It was one of the first major works in literature to be written in English instead of Latin or French?\"\n\nJoshua beams. \"Exactly! At that time, English was considered a 'vulgar' tongue, used by the common people, while Latin and French were the languages of the educated and the elite. Chaucer’s decision to write in English was groundbreaking and helped elevate the status of the English language in literature.\"\n\nPens scribble furiously on paper as Joshua speaks. He moves across the room, his hands animated, engaging the class with his passion for the subject.\n\n\"Chaucer’s tales are also significant for their use of a variety of voices and perspectives. Each character has a unique story to tell, reflecting the diverse fabric of medieval society. For instance, we have the Knight, who tells a tale of chivalry and romance, and the Miller, whose story is far bawdier and more irreverent.\"\n\nStudents chuckle at the mention of the Miller. Joshua giggles with them, unable to deny how his scent sweetens in satisfaction at their reaction.\n\n\"Let’s delve into the General Prologue, where Chaucer introduces us to his colourful—\" Joshua and nearly the entire class shift their attention to the boy who enters noisily through the backdoor, taking a seat in the last row with a loud thud.\n\n\"—cast of characters. He gives us vivid descriptions, and through these, we get a glimpse of the social hierarchy and the characteristics valued in that era. Who remembers how Chaucer describes the Wife of Bath?\"\n\nJoshua finishes his sentence with professional poise, despite his irritation at the disturbance. He can't do anything about it.\n\nNow back at the front of the class, he turns only to meet the university heartthrob’s brown irises.\n\nYoon Jeonghan shoots him a deceptively sweet smile. Joshua looks away.\n\nOr, in professional language, ignores him.\n\nA boy answers this time, “He says she’s had five husbands and is somewhat of a gold digger?”\n\nJoshua laughs softly. Before he can shake his head, Julie interjects.\n\n“Absolutely not! Chaucer does portray her as a woman who knows her way around marriage, but there’s more to her. He describes her as a skilled cloth-maker, gap-toothed, which was considered a sign of lustfulness, and with a bold, assertive personality. The Wife of Bath is one of the earliest feminist characters in literature. She speaks openly about her experiences and asserts her own agency in a male-dominated society.”\n\n“Well, isn’t that the extended version of what I just said?” Mark grumbles.\n\n“NO! Your words were humilia—”\n\nThough Joshua would love to echo Julie's sentiment, he can’t let a debate drag on. He has an outline for today’s class, and it's crucial.\n\n“Please, guys, let’s not fight over something fictitious. I have a better plan. Why don’t we write an essay on The Wife of Bath? Mail it to me by the end of this week. Each of you. Your marks will be counted from it.”\n\nSome students let out bored groans. Joshua smiles sympathetically.\n\nJoshua's subtle eyes seek out the latecomer, who is now resting his chin on his palm, eyes fixed on—him?\n\nOkay. That’s a problem now. It’s not the first time this has happened. Jeonghan isn’t even his student. What is the Political Science student doing here with another boy, Seungcheol if he isn’t mistaken?\n\nThough the Law major seems preoccupied, looking out the window.\n\nJoshua turns on the projector, gesturing to the screen where a passage from the General Prologue is displayed.\n\n“Let’s read this section together. Pay attention to Chaucer’s use of irony and satire. How does he use these to critique societal norms?”\n\nAs the students read the passage, Joshua walks among them, offering insights and answering questions. His energy is infectious, and the students are visibly engaged, jotting down notes and highlighting key points.\n\nHe soon reaches the last row. Jeonghan is too bold to let his eyes leave the elegant professor even for a moment.\n\n“Mr. Yoon, if I am not mistaken, this is the third time you’ve shown up late.” Joshua gives a small smile.\n\n“It’s not my fault, professor. I got into something so interesting last week,” Jeonghan answers sweetly.\n\n“You say it was last week. How can it be the cause of you being late today?” Joshua frowns, his voice still laced with honey.\n\nNo matter how angry you are, you can’t show it to the senator’s son. Not at all.\n\nJoshua isn’t ready to go back to LA and see the disappointment on his already disappointed father’s face.\n\n“And you aren’t even submitting any assignments. If it goes on this way, I’m afraid I won’t be—” Jeonghan cuts him off.\n\n“I’m really sorry, professor. But I promise I have everything done. I worked so hard last night that I woke up late,” Jeonghan answers gleefully.\n\nOkay, so the boy who never even cares what’s going on in the classroom or what assignments are given has done all the classwork Joshua assigned?\n\nJoshua is suspicious. He narrows his eyes.\n\n“I didn’t get any mail,” he reasons.\n\nSeungcheol snickers beside Jeonghan, but Jeonghan shoots him a death glare, and Seungcheol raises his hands in surrender, mumbling, \"Sorry.\"\n\n“I want to show it to you directly. Is that okay?” Again, those innocent eyes.\n\nJoshua is incredulous. He nods. “At 12:30 pm.”\n\n“No, actually after classes end. At 5:30 pm. At your office. You and me. Thank you, professor, for the appointment.” Jeonghan stands and slings his bag over his shoulder.\n\nHe gives Joshua his sweetest smile and leaves the room, with Seungcheol following him out.\n\nLeaving a dumbfounded Joshua staring. He frowns. ‘Just what does that motherfucker think of himself?'\n\n'Wait, did he just say it when there were at least ten assignments?’\n\n∗ ∗ ∗\n\nThe basketball match between Hanseong University of Excellence and Busan Institute of Technology is in full swing. The roar of the crowd fills the stadium, a cacophony of cheers and anticipation. Joshua and Mr. Xu, the art teacher, make their way into the arena.\n\n“Do you think we’ll win?” Xu nudges his colleague, his anxiety palpable, his green tea scent souring with the tension.\n\n“It’s already the tenth time you’ve asked, Hao. Enough. You yourself said we have the best players,” Joshua replies, his voice tinged with exhaustion from the repetitive questioning.\n\nHe’s not even sure why he’s attending the match. Basketball has never been his interest; in fact, it never has been.\n\n“That team is also quite strong. They won last year too,” Minghao mutters, nervously nibbling on his index finger’s nail.\n\nJoshua sighs, his patience wearing thin as the excitement of the game pulses around them. The stakes are high, and while he might not share Xu’s fervour, he understands the importance of the moment.\n\nJoshua can’t help but wonder when Minghao developed such an obsession with the university basketball league. Did he miss something crucial?\n\nThey finally reach their seats, a pair of perfect spots in the middle row. They apologize profusely and thank each other as they settle in.\n\nJoshua exhales with relief as he sinks into the coarse seat, his body collapsing with the exhaustion of having delivered four lectures on his feet. The crowd around them is a massive, pulsating sea of energy. Each time the team scores, a thunderous roar erupts. \"Vortex Viper!\" the crowd chants, their mascot's name echoing through the arena. Another goal sends the cheers to a fever pitch.\n\nIt’s not that Joshua dislikes crowded places, but the constant screaming and shouting create a cacophony that threatens to give him a splitting headache.\n\nHe tries to join in the excitement, raising his arms and mimicking the students’ cheers. Then he busies himself with a large tub of caramel popcorn.\n\n(Seriously? Caramel popcorn?) He thinks, chuckling to himself. Despite his irritation, he’s a sucker for sweet treats and refuses to sully his hands with the greasy salted ones.\n\nAs he munches on his popcorn, Joshua can’t help but feel the infectious thrill of the game, even if he’s just a reluctant participant. The electrifying atmosphere, combined with the relentless cheers and the sweet crunch of his snack, makes him almost forget why he didn’t want to be here in the first place.\n\nJoshua glances at his friend with a disapproving tsk. “Hao! Take these instead of your painted nails! They’re neither tasty nor nutritious.”\n\nA sophomore nearby, if Joshua’s memory serves him right, giggles at their banter. Joshua extends the popcorn tub toward him, and the student shyly accepts a handful, mumbling, “Thank you, Professor.”\n\nJoshua returns the smile before shifting his attention back to Minghao, who’s now nervously nibbling at his nails. Joshua rolls his eyes and swats Minghao’s hand away.\n\nMinghao glares at him with a mix of irritation and mock anger. “Stop being such a mom!”\n\n“Geez, like I’m dying to,” Joshua retorts, playfully shoving the popcorn packet toward Minghao, who ends up wrestling with it as it lands on his face.\n\n“J-O-S-H-U-A!!!” Minghao finally pulls the packet away, his half-eaten nail pointing accusingly at Joshua’s caramel-coated popcorn. “I hate these!”\n\n“That’s because you’re a spicy food fanatic!” Joshua shoots back.\n\n“Because I’m Chinese!” Minghao quips, leaving no room for further discussion.\n\nJoshua falls silent, unable to counter the remark. He pouts and turns his gaze back to the game, feeling a bit like a sulking child.\n\nMinghao, relieved by the change of topic, muses that Joshua, at twenty-nine, sometimes acts like an overgrown eight-year-old.\n\nThe sudden silence between them feels a bit awkward. Minghao glances at Joshua’s pouty face and raises an eyebrow, questioning the lack of professionalism from the professor.\n\nA smirk slowly forms on Minghao’s lips as he leans in, pinching Joshua’s squishy cheek with a playful touch. He then grabs a handful of the brown sugar-coated popcorn. Joshua winks at him, their shared laughter easing the tension and making the moment feel lighter.\n\nThe final buzzer sounds, and the Vortex Vipers clinch the victory with a score of 103 to 97. The stadium erupts in a wave of excitement as fans flood the arena in a sea of red jerseys. Minghao and Joshua leap from their seats, embracing each other in sheer elation.\n\nThe crowd's roar crescendos focused on one name: Number 4, Yoon Jeonghan, who had just scored the match-winning point. As Jeonghan celebrates, he kisses his silver chain and tosses flirtatious gestures toward the adoring audience. His movements are fluid, his energy magnetic. Joshua can’t tear his eyes away from the scene.\n\nDespite not being as muscular as his teammates—Jungkook, Mingyu, or Seungcheol—Jeonghan possesses a different kind of allure. His lithe, athletic frame, with broad shoulders and a lean build, contrasts sharply with the other players' bulk. The sweat glistening on his pale skin, the way his dark hair clings to his forehead, create an irresistible draw.\n\nJoshua’s heart pounds erratically. He feels an unexpected storm brewing within him, a turmoil of fascination and desire. Jeonghan's effortless charisma, and the way he teases the crowd with his playful flirtations, stir something in Joshua he struggles to understand.\n\nIs he falling under Jeonghan’s spell? Is he becoming one of the star-struck fans?\n\nThe situation intensifies as Jeonghan’s eyes lock with Joshua’s. For a split second—was it just his imagination?—Jeonghan winks directly at him. In front of the entire university.\n\nJoshua's heart skips a beat, and his cheeks flush. He quickly averts his gaze, his mind reeling. He can’t believe what just happened. His omega is practically howling in confusion, a mix of excitement and frustration.\n\n'Fuck, shut up YOU HORNY BITCH!' Joshua mentally curses his wolf, feeling a surge of embarrassment and longing.\n\nDesperate to escape the overwhelming wave of emotions, Joshua starts making his way out of the stadium, pushing through the throngs of jubilant fans. He needs to get away—from the noise, the crowd, and most importantly, from Yoon Jeonghan. The last thing he needs is to be caught in a web of unexpected feelings.\n\n∗ ∗ ∗\n\nJoshua sips from his coffee, savouring the brief respite. The department meeting had been cancelled due to the game, giving him some unexpected free time to catch up on research papers.\n\n\"You aren't leaving?\" Minghao raises his brow in confusion as he walks in.\n\n\"No, I’ll be late. I have a meeting with a student,\" Joshua says, not taking his eyes off the papers.\n\nMinghao nods and looks around Joshua’s cabin. It’s not as big as his but comfy enough for the newly joined teacher. The room reflects Joshua's personality perfectly—elegant and meticulously organized.\n\nThe wall-length windows in the east let in the gentle spring breeze, rustling the pristine white curtains. A sizable bookshelf stands against the wall opposite the desk, filled with a curated collection of the world’s richest literature. Titles like \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Wuthering Heights,\" \"The Great Gatsby,\" and \"Moby Dick\" sit alongside classics like \"Beowulf,\" \"The Canterbury Tales,\" and \"The Divine Comedy.\" This collection is a testament to Joshua’s deep passion for reading and teaching.\n\nJoshua's desk is occupied with several of Chaucer’s books, a clear indication of his preparation for the next class. The workspace is immaculate, with neatly stacked papers, an elegant fountain pen, and a tasteful desk organizer. Joshua hates disorganization, and it shows.\n\nThe whole room exudes a subtle, sophisticated scent from a high-end brand’s freshener, mirroring the ambience of Joshua’s apartment, as Minghao recalls. Every detail, from the elegant desk lamp to the framed literary quotes on the walls, reflects Joshua's refined taste and dedication to his profession.\n\nMinghao can't help but feel a twinge of admiration for his colleague's impeccable taste and dedication. He picks up one of the Chaucer books, flipping through the pages. “You really immerse yourself in your work, don’t you?”\n\nJoshua finally looks up, a small smile playing on his lips. “It’s not work if you love it, right?”\n\nMinghao chuckles. “Touché. Just don’t forget to take a break once in a while.”\n\nJoshua nods, glancing at his watch. “I will. After this meeting.”\n\nMinghao gives him a supportive pat on the back before heading to the shelf, leaving Joshua to his tranquil, book-filled sanctuary.\n\nMinghao's eyes scan the books. He’s a bookworm too, though not as avid as Joshua. His particular interest lies in ancient art and literature, a passion that connected these two omegas during their college days.\n\n“I’m taking this,” Minghao announces, pulling out a well-preserved copy of \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" by Cao Xueqin. His gaze shifts to other notable works such as \"Journey to the West\" by Wu Cheng'en, \"Water Margin\" by Shi Nai'an, and \"The Art of War\" by Sun Tzu, but he settles on his first choice.\n\nJoshua only nods, absorbed in his research. As long as nothing happens to his precious books, he doesn't mind.\n\nWith that, the Chinese man takes his leave, the classic novel tucked under his arm. Joshua gets alone again, the tranquillity of his office settling around him. He takes another sip of his coffee, feeling the familiar comfort of being surrounded by the literary giants that fuel his passion for teaching.\n\nMinghao takes the stairs to get from the third floor, his thoughts so preoccupied that he doesn’t notice the six-foot-two man walking up. They collide, and Minghao falls on his butt, his belongings scattered across the floor.\n\nHe lets out a shrill cry and shoots a furious glare at the man, but his expression changes as soon as his eyes meet the boy, who is equally shocked and already leaning down in front of him with a concerned face.\n\n“Professor Xu! I’m really sorry. It’s all my fault. I should have seen it. I wasn’t careful—” Panicked, Mingyu begins to utter apologies non-stop.\n\n“At first, help me get up, will you?” Minghao clicks his tongue in irritation.\n\nThis boy is the last one he wants to meet, especially with his companion, who is more engrossed in his phone than the scene.\n\n“I will leave. You two continue.” Jeonghan pockets his phone, turning to the professor with a small, mocking smile.\n\nThere is some unknown beef between them. Jeonghan doesn’t like the professor, and Minghao has some kind of problem with him, actually not only with him but with the whole basketball team.\n\n“Hello, Professor.” It sounds more like a mockery than a greeting.\n\nWithout waiting for a response, Jeonghan is already heading upstairs. Minghao's attention is again captured by the goofy, puppy-like human—that’s what students call Mingyu to emphasize how sweet he is.\n\nJeonghan's rebellious nature is evident in the way he dismisses Minghao, his disdain barely concealed. He carries himself with a nonchalant arrogance, making it clear he couldn't care less about the professor's authority or the university's rules. This defiant attitude only fuels Minghao's irritation, but he decides to focus on the task at hand—getting back on his feet and retrieving his scattered belongings with Mingyu's help.\n\n\"Take my hand.\" Mingyu stretches his hand out to help.\n\nMinghao tsks and slaps his hand away. He won't take help from that boy, even if he badly needs it.\n\n\"I can manage by myself.\" Minghao grips the stair railing and tries to stand up, but damn, his butt hurts like hell.\n\nMingyu notices. He's about to help him again, but to his dismay, the Korean Literature professor walks onto the scene.\n\n\"Oh my god, Hao! What happened to you?\" Wonwoo hurriedly crouches in front of him.\n\nMingyu clicks his tongue audibly. Both professors hear it, but Minghao’s situation is more important.\n\n\"I was testing how hard I can hit my hip!\" Minghao snarls, his face contorted in pain and frustration.\n\nWonwoo sighs at the remark. Minghao is frustrated, and trust him, you shouldn't test the waters when that man is angry. He knows this more than anyone as Minghao's freshly-ex.\n\nIgnoring Minghao’s protests, Wonwoo places one arm around his back and another around his thighs, lifting him up in a bridal carry. Minghao lets out an involuntary \"Ouch.\"\n\n\"What the fuck! Put me down! I SAID P-U-T M-E DOWN!!\" Minghao struggles to break free from Wonwoo's grasp, his face flushed with anger and embarrassment.\n\n\"You'll get hurt more if you don't stop. I'll take you home. I was leaving anyway.\" Wonwoo keeps his composure, his voice calm and steady.\n\n\"NO!!! Students—\"\n\n\"None are here. It's already 5:25 pm. If there are, it's not like they don't know we're friends—\"\n\n\"—I don't care! Put me down!\"\n\nMinghao’s anger is palpable, his eyes blazing as he struggles against Wonwoo's hold. The discomfort is clear on his face, every movement eliciting a wince. He glares at Mingyu, then at Wonwoo, feeling utterly humiliated. His pride is wounded more than his body, and the pain in his hip is nothing compared to the sting of his bruised ego.\n\nWonwoo tightens his grip slightly to steady him, his own face showing a mix of concern and determination. \"Just hold still, Hao. You'll only hurt yourself more if you keep fighting.\"\n\nMinghao huffs, still fuming but too pained to continue his struggle. He resigns himself to being carried, shooting a final glare at Mingyu, who stands there, looking both apologetic and helpless.\n\nAs they make their way out, the spring breeze from Joshua's office windows follows them, a stark contrast to Minghao's heated temper.\n\nWonwoo lets out a sigh, walking out of the faculty building with Minghao in his arms. Mingyu trails behind them, fuming as he watches the exes grumble. He unknowingly clenches the art paper in his hand, the proximity of the professors gnawing at him.\n\nJeonghan hyung was right. If you want something, you shouldn’t waste time. Get it or snatch it.\n\nBut Mingyu isn’t as cold-hearted as Jeonghan.\n\n\"You’re the one being awkward, Xu. The whole campus knows we’re friends. No one will think anything,\" Wonwoo says, unlocking his car and carefully seating Minghao in the passenger seat.\n\nMinghao hastily tugs his blond hair behind his ear, his face as red as a tomato, if you ask Mingyu. Wonwoo thanked Mingyu for his help and walked around to his side of the car.\n\nMingyu watches them still arguing as Wonwoo starts the car. The vehicle pulls away, leaving him standing there with a deep frown.\n\nHe feels like a loser.\n\n\"You should confess to Professor Xu,\" Jungkook says, suddenly appearing beside him.\n\n\"Like it’s that easy,\" Mingyu rolls his eyes.\n\nJungkook snorts. \"It is, actually. You’ll either get a no or a yes, which is quite impossible.\"\n\n\"I’ll get kicked out,\" Mingyu whines.\n\n\"It’s complicated, dude. Why do you even wanna try on that grumpy old hag?\" Jungkook earns a kick on his butt for that.\n\n\"He isn’t old; he’s only thirty!\" Mingyu gives a scandalized look.\n\n\"Kinky for old people,\" Jungkook smirks, rubbing his knee.\n\n\"You are impossible.\"\n\n\"Not as impossible as Jeonghan,\" Jungkook teases, winking.\n\nMingyu sighs, running a hand through his hair. \"It’s not just that, man. There’s something about Minghao... I can’t stop thinking about him.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, you’ve got it bad for the prof,\" Jungkook mocks, \"But seriously, just go for it. What’s the worst that can happen?\"\n\n\"I dunno, maybe he’ll think I’m a total creep,\" Mingyu grumbles.\n\n\"Or maybe he’ll realize you’re a total hottie,\" Jungkook retorts, slapping Mingyu on the back. \"Just man up and do it.\"\n\nMingyu shakes his head, a small smile forming despite himself. \"You’re such a pain, Kook.\"\n\n\"That’s why you love me,\" Jungkook laughs, slinging an arm around Mingyu’s shoulders. \"Now, come on. Let’s get out of here before Jeonghan Hyung finds out and gives us another lecture on seizing the day.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Mingyu mumbles, but his mind is already drifting back to Minghao. Maybe Jungkook is right. Maybe it’s time to take a chance.\n\n∗ ∗ ∗\n\nJeonghan idly strolls to Joshua’s cabin, a rare sight considering Yoon Jeonghan's usual elusiveness, even within his own faculty building. As he walks, some students give him questioning looks. He only responds with a lopsided smile, continuing his way to the third floor.\n\nThis faculty building is markedly different from his business one. The corridor isn’t as wide, with the left side open to offer a clear view outside. Half of it is constructed with red bricks, and the floor is marble-coated, exuding a faint scent of old books in the air.\n\nThe sun is ready to set, casting a warm, orange glow over the earth. As Jeonghan nears the specific cabin, he spots the professor. Joshua is leaning against the red brick wall, a blue coffee mug resting beside his hands, his face nestled in them. The breeze plays with the professor’s brownish mullet, making it slightly dishevelled. Joshua is humming something, eyes closed, seemingly lost in his own world.\n\nSo, the whispers going around the campus aren’t completely unfounded. The professor is beautiful.\n\nJeonghan thought the same last week when he saw Joshua in a vulnerable state for the first time, paying more attention to him. Now, looking at him, Jeonghan can’t deny the professor’s exquisiteness.\n\nThe dusk is enchanting. The sky, painted in shades of orange and pink, seems to hold its breath as the sun dips below the horizon. The gentle breeze carries the scent of blooming flowers and freshly cut grass, mingling with the aroma of old books, creating a nostalgic symphony that unknowingly tugs at Jeonghan's heart.\n\nJeonghan’s thoughts wander. Joshua isn’t just beautiful; he’s captivating. There’s a certain allure in the way he stands, in the way the dying sunlight caresses his features, making them glow softly. The professor's serene expression, the delicate hum escaping his lips, all add to his undeniable charm.\n\nJeonghan leans against the opposite wall, observing Joshua. There’s something about the professor that draws him in, something that makes his heart beat a little faster. He wonders what Joshua is thinking about, what song he’s humming, and what it would be like to get to know him better.\n\nThe way Joshua's eyelashes flutter against his cheeks as he hums softly, lost in his own thoughts, makes Jeonghan's heart skip a beat. The professor's peaceful demeanour contrasts sharply with Jeonghan's usual chaos, and he finds himself inexplicably drawn to it.\n\nJeonghan's mind drifts back to their last encounter, the subtle glances, the unspoken words. He can’t help but feel a growing curiosity, a desire to unravel the mystery that is Joshua. The professor’s calm and composed exterior hides depths that Jeonghan longs to explore.\n\nFor the first time, Jeonghan's heart prominently draws its presence, which he thought he never had.\n\nAs the sky deepens into twilight, Jeonghan takes a deep breath, gathering his thoughts. He straightens up, his gaze never leaving Joshua. There's a flicker of determination in his eyes as he decides to make his presence known.\n\n“Good evening, professor.”\n\nJoshua's eyes snap open at the sudden intrusion. Oh, right. He had forgotten that Jeonghan had (forcefully) secured an appointment with him. Joshua usually avoids any engagements during dusk, reserving this precious time solely for himself. This time of day is sacred to him, a moment when inner peace washes over him, providing a respite from the chaos of life.\n\nQuickly regaining his composure, Joshua clears his throat and takes a sip of his coffee, now cold and far from its original warmth.\n\nJeonghan's eyes remain fixed on the professor, watching intently as Joshua tucks a strand of hair behind his ear and smooths out the creases in his dress shirt.\n\n“Sorry, I forgot about your visit,” Joshua says, offering an apologetic smile.\n\nJeonghan shrugs, his lips curling into a faint smirk. “No problem, professor. I’m used to being unforgettable.”\n\nJoshua chuckles softly, the sound blending with the rustling leaves and the distant chirping of birds. “Well, you certainly have a way of making an entrance.”\n\nJeonghan steps closer, the setting sun casting a warm glow on his features. “I hope I’m not interrupting your personal time too much.”\n\nJoshua shakes his head, a gentle smile playing on his lips. “Not at all. I was just enjoying the quiet for a bit.\"\n\nJoshua picks up his coffee mug and walks into his cabin, with Jeonghan trailing behind, eyes still fixed on him. Joshua places the mug near his coffee maker, then turns to his student, patting the seat for him to sit down.\n\nJeonghan follows, taking a seat and basking in the attention.\n\nJoshua is too childish to bring up the topic of Jeonghan's wink at him--- who knows if it was really at him.\n\nSo like an of age, he lets that go.\n\n“Would you like some coffee?” Joshua asks, looking at Jeonghan expectantly.\n\n“You like to watch the sunset,” Jeonghan abruptly shifts the conversation, catching Joshua off guard.\n\n“Um—yeah?” Joshua responds, slightly taken aback.\n\n“I see. No, I don’t take coffee,” Jeonghan replies with a smile.\n\nJoshua notices the room filling with the distinct scent of nicotine, his omega instincts kicking in. He hates that odour; it irritates his senses.\n\n“Yeah, but yes to smoking,” he remarks, turning to his marquee coffee maker to hide his scrunched nose from Jeonghan.\n\n“That’s my scent, actually,” Jeonghan says triumphantly, noticing Joshua’s reaction.\n\n“T-that’s unusual,” Joshua stammers, embarrassed by his judgmental reaction.\n\n“It’s okay, professor. No need to get worked up over something so trivial,” Jeonghan reassures him, leaning back casually.\n\n“Rich and rebellious, I see,” Joshua comments, noting Jeonghan’s frown. “That’s what the scent means.”\n\nJoshua feels a sense of triumph, having momentarily caught Jeonghan off guard.\n\nJeonghan laughs, sprawling out in the chair. Although Joshua typically despises such behaviour, his patience holds him back. He understands that Jeonghan’s age and wealth fuel his rebelliousness—he remembers being like that once.\n\nTaking graceful steps toward Jeonghan, Joshua asks, “So, you’re here to submit assignments, if I’m not wrong?”\n\nJeonghan stands up, meeting Joshua’s gaze. “I am, actually,” he says. “But before that—” he walks to the door and, before Joshua can react, locks it.\n\nJoshua’s omega instincts flare up as he stands in confusion. “What’s going on?”\n\nJeonghan smirks, walking toward him. “Why do you have to close the door, Yoon Jeonghan?” Joshua asks, his voice tinged with panic.\n\n“Because it wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t. You’ll thank me for this,” Jeonghan replies.\n\nJoshua’s scent sours with panic, and Jeonghan’s alpha instincts pick it up. “Tonka bean, I see,” Jeonghan comments, contemplating.\n\n“What?” Joshua’s frown deepens.\n\n“Your scent.”\n\n“It’s cedarwood, Mr. Yoon,” Joshua corrects, stepping closer to the door. “And it’s inappropriate to keep the doors closed. I don’t see a need.”\n\nJeonghan is undeniably attractive, and Joshua is unmated and horny, but he would never allow his student to cross such boundaries. Joshua loves his job too much to jeopardize it.\n\nLost in thought, Joshua doesn’t notice Jeonghan’s presence right behind him until he feels the heat of his body. He reaches for the handle to unlock the door but stops when he hears an obscene moan filling the room, followed by continuous others and the sound of skin slapping.\n\nJoshua’s heart drops, and his hand freezes on the handle. He turns instantly, only to be caged between the wall and Jeonghan, who holds a triumphant smile on his face.\n\nJeonghan turns the screen towards Joshua, whose eyes widen in shock. Cold sweat beads on his forehead.\n\nJeonghan places his other hand against the wall beside Joshua’s head. Joshua shifts his gaze from the screen to Jeonghan’s smitten face, swallowing hard.\n\n“Isn’t that you, Pro-Fe-ssor?” Jeonghan taunts, his voice dripping with mischief."
