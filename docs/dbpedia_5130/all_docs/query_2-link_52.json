        "text": "The global webcomics market size was valued at USD 7.13 billion in 2023. The market is projected to be worth USD 7.63 billion in 2024 and reach USD 13.04 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.92% during the forecast period. Asia Pacific dominated the webcomics market with a market share of 48.53% in 2023.\n\nWebcomics (digital or electronic comic books) are comics created for online publishing on a website or mobile applications. Digital comic books are created using various art software such as Adobe Illustrator.\n\nThere has been a significant rise in digital comic book platforms worldwide in recent years. The major players are expanding their presence by launching apps for digital comics owing to increasing digitization worldwide. New launches are expected to increase the availability and adoption of electronic comic books among consumers in the coming years. For instance, in February 2022, Byte Dance, an internet technology company, launched its new comic app, Fizzo Toon, in Japan and invested USD 42 million in KidariStudio, a web novel and webtoon creator. The content partnership agreement is poised to strengthen webtoon operations in China, and ByteDance is expected to get the intellectual property of around 1300 webtoons.\n\nIn May 2021, Black Sands Entertainment, a publisher and media company, launched the Black Sands Publishing app, a digital comic platform.

The new Webtoon comic platform is free for mobile devices on both Android and iOS devices, exclusively for India. It features genres such as Bollywood, romance, fantasy, mythology, and superheroes.\n\nThe sudden outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic affected the traditional comic book market throughout 2020 and 2021, given the temporary and permanent closure of physical retail outlets.\n\nDespite the impact of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions in the global physical comic book industry, the demand for digital comics increased during the lockdown in 2020 as individuals across countries turned to reading comics online during their extended free time and to reduce boredom through reading. Several players in this market focused on launching digital comics to cater to growing demand owing to the closure of comic book stores in 2020. For instance,\n\nIn June 2020, Bakarmax, an India-based animation and comic studio, announced the launch of Karejwa, its new webcomic, illustrated by Ankit Kapoor and written by Varun Grover.\n\nIn June 2020, DC Entertainment, a U.S.-based entertainment company, collaborated with HBO Max, a Warner Bros subsidiary, to launch a new original digital comic book series, To the Max, with three new superheroes.\n\nWebcomics Market Trends\n\nIncreasing Adaptation of Digital Comic Books into Movies, Series, and Games to Drive Product Demand\n\nThe rising adaptation of comics into popular television series, movie franchises, and video games into comics has emerged as a key trend within the global digital comic industry. The popularity of movies and games introduces new audiences to digital comic books, contributing significantly to the growth of the global webcomics market. Moreover, several players focus on partnerships with animation studios to boost product demand. The partnerships allow companies to integrate their famous characters and create new exciting plots, increasing fan curiosity and positively influencing the global webcomics market trends. For instance,\n\nIn March 2023, Webtoon, a digital comic platform, partnered with Line Studio, a game developer, to launch a new mobile game, True Beauty, based on the digital comic True Beauty.\n\nIn August 2022, Dark Horse Media, a U.S.-based comic book publisher, extended its partnership with Netflix, a U.S.-based media company.

The increasing availability of digital NFT comics has the same collectable value as physical editions, increasing demand from comic collectors and boosting market growth. Several prominent players focus on launching new NFT comics to boost their product sales. For instance,\n\nIn October 2022, DC Entertainment, a U.S.-based entertainment company, launched a new collection of NFT digital comics, DC Collectible Comics (DC3). The new collection is available in two categories: Legacy (collection of classic comics) and Modern (collection of latest releases).

Governments worldwide are also promoting comic books as a great and fun way of learning among children. The increasing government initiatives and institutions' increasing need for more digital content to engage students are boosting the product demand among parents and children. For instance,\n\nIn January 2024, the South Korean government announced plans to open a webtoon-dedicated school by 2027. The government also announced its ambition to help the South Korean webtoon market grow by USD 1 billion by 2027.\n\nIn March 2022, OverDrive Education, a digital distributor of eBooks and audiobooks, announced its new offering of digital comics to schools via its Sora student reading app. Schools can purchase cost-effective, age-appropriate bundles of around 1,500 digital comic books from popular publishers such as Marvel, Dark Horse, and Image Comics.

The comics are accessible online on the DIKSHA app or web portal.\n\nRESTRAINING FACTORS\n\nIncreasing Availability of Substitute Products May Impede Market Growth\n\nThe increasing availability of substitutes such as digital non-fiction and digital fiction books limits market growth. Audiobooks have become more prevalent in recent years, and the lockdown in 2020 has only increased the demand for audiobooks. The ease of accessibility for disabled and non-English speaking consumer groups is increasing the demand for audiobooks. Unlike fiction and non-fiction, comics are not available in audio format, hampering the global webcomics market share. With increasing preference and popularity for audiobooks, audiobook platforms are introducing new formats and expanding their libraries. For instance,\n\nIn September 2022, Spotify, an audio streaming company, launched its new audiobook business with a library of 3, 00,000 titles to purchase and listen to the U.S. consumers.\n\nIn November 2022, Spotify, an audio streaming company, announced the expansion of 3, 00,000 audiobooks available in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand for listening and purchase.\n\nWebcomics Market Segmentation Analysis\n\nBy Genre Analysis\n\nAction Segment Dominates Due to Increasing Popularity and Demand for Superheroes Webcomics\n\nBased on genre, the market is segmented into action, comedy, sci-fi, horror, romance, and others. The action segment held a major market share in 2023 owing to the significant demand for superhero digital comic books across countries. Several prominent players focus on launching new action electronic comic books. For instance, in April 2022, Valiant Entertainment partnered with Blackstone Publishing to debut a new line of adult novels featuring beloved Valiant characters. The new line includes iconic heroes and villain characters from the valiant universe, such as Livewire, Eternal Warrior, and Shadowman.\n\nThe romance segment is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period due to the increasing popularity of romantic graphic novels among women and teenagers. The increasing popularity of romantic digital comic books with plots of marriage, divorce, lust, jealousy, teen break up and betrayal, and, of course, teen heartbreak coupled with the emerging trend of LGBTQ romance stories are driving the segment growth. Recent years have witnessed industry stakeholders launch new comics to cater to the increasing demand for romance webcomics.

The subscription-based segment is expected to dominate the market throughout the forecast period. In this model, consumers pay a monthly subscription fee and get access to all the comics during that period. The accessibility to a wide range of electronic comic books, monthly payments, and convenience drive the demand for a subscription-based model. Industry participants are focusing on expanding their portfolio across subscription models. For instance, in July 2023, Manta, a South Korean subscription-based digital comics platform, announced the launch of 10 new exclusive comic series. Furthermore, the ad-based segment is expected to grow steadily during the forecast period.\n\nREGIONAL INSIGHTS\n\nThe global market is analyzed across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, South America, and the Middle East & Africa.\n\nAsia Pacific Webcomics Market Size, 2023 (USD Billion)\n\nTo get more information on the regional analysis of this market, Request a Free sample\n\nThe Asia Pacific market for webcomics accounted for the largest share in 2023.
