        "text": "(Singapore) August 22, 2023 – Singapore’s Momo Film Co, a Beach House Pictures production company, has signed a co-production deal with Seoul-based Bros Studio to develop a slate of Kenaz webtoons into scripted content. The deal will see the two entertainment companies adapting the popular comics, designed specifically for mobile phones, and bringing them to life as television series for international audiences.\n\nWebtoons, originally designed for mobile phones, have developed a massive global fanbase and are becoming an exciting Asian entertainment category that is experiencing fast-growing international success.\n\nKenaz is one of the leading platforms for webtoons in Korea and the first Korean studio to provide webtoon IP to Apple Books. Working with Bros, Kenaz is expanding its webtoon film and television productions.\n\n“We are in the era of NFTs, AI, VR, and K-content, and I believe that webtoons is the medium that connects all of those trends and technologies,” said Woody Lee, CEO of Kenaz. “Webtoons not only has the potential to be a source of entertainment and content, but it also can become the source of technology and content such as NFTs and AI.”\n\nBased in Seoul and Los Angeles, Bros is a leading Korean-American talent management company with an emphasis on cross-border content, acting as a bridge between Korea and Hollywood. Bros has a division exclusively focused on creating content based on webcomics IP.\n\n“We are now seeing the global markets open up to viewing webtoon IPs, popular in their native digital format for many years in Korea, in motion-picture format,” says Joseph Jang, co-founder of Bros Studios. “We look forward to working alongside Momo Film Co. to bring more of those stories to the global viewing audience.”\n\nThis is the first foray into webtoons for Momo Film Co, a leading scripted Southeast Asian producer with an extensive background in award-winning content.

In Mirror Game, it’s an ultimate race against time when a Master illusionist with devious intentions becomes a viral sensation after successfully hypnotizing people online. In All About Money three best friends unexpectedly come across one billion dollars and are thrown into the illicit world of crime and corruption.\n\nThe original webtoons written and illustrated by Sunny and Baolong (Mirror Game) and BaStards and Siho (All About Money) have been consistently selected by writers and studios as two of the top 5 Kenaz titles to be adapted into a series.\n\nThe projects will be backed by Beach House Pictures who have been rapidly increasing investment into scripted development and productions internationally, releasing the series Mr Midnight on Netflix in 2022 and recently announcing an Ink Factory development deal for a television series of the iconic 70s Singapore action trilogy, Cleopatra Wong.\n\n“We are excited about supporting this unique collaboration between Singapore and Korea.” said Donovan Chan, Creative Director & Co-Founder of Beach House Pictures, “Together, we have plans to launch even more webtoon adapted series across Asia and bring these Asian IPs to territories beyond including the U.S. and the UK.”\n\n-30-\n\nAbout Momo Film Co\n\nMomo Film Co, part of Beach House Pictures, is a Singapore-based film and TV company founded in 2018.
