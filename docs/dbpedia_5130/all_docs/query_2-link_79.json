        "text": "Originating in Korea, webtoon (웹툰) is colorized mobile and digital comics, an offshoot of the older Korean manhwa. In other words, it is the counterpart of manga in South Korea. The name itself is a compound word, derived from “website” and “cartoon.” The webtoon reader community around the world is quickly expanding, making the webtoon a “syndrome” in the current generation. If you’re familiar with K-dramas (Korean dramas) such as Itaewon Class, True Beauty, and What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim?, you have to know that they all were adaptations based on highly popular webtoon series. Gripping plots, interesting characters, and exquisite art make millions of fans obsessed with these revolutionary comics.\n\nWebtoon was created by the mobile internet ecosystem. In the early 2000s, they were recognized as independent stories in a “snack-culture” format. As of date, the fairly simple and linear distribution of webtoons by Korean platform providers and easy-to-access resources fuel the Korean comics market growth. Indeed, the South Korean webtoon market is expected to grow at an impressive rate as it continues to boost its content competitiveness worldwide. Before, webtoons were exclusively produced by Korean content creators; now, any artist from all around the world can make and upload their own webtoons.\n\nSo, what is “snack culture”?\n\nThis term is pretty popular in South Korea, and it refers to entertainment that is consumed in a short period (not more than fifteen minutes). That is to say, you can enjoy it anytime and anywhere like devouring a snack.\n\nThe success of webtoons\n\nContinuously growing internet penetration along with the increasing number of internet users presented a notable opportunity for the country. Hence, optimized for smartphones from the get-go, webtoons have generated strong demand and significant progress over the years not only in the homeland but also across the globe.\n\nIt goes without saying that communication between the audience and the artist/writer is crucial for success. Having considered this communicational factor also helped webtoons to become a leading cultural trend at the international level.\n\nAll things considered, webtoons, the flagship of the cultural phenomenon of South Korea, continue to accomplish extensive commercial success far beyond their predictions. Its ongoing evolution contributed to a new term: “webtooniverse”.\n\nParallel to the growing number of digital publishing houses specializing in Webtoon, high-quality Korean webtoon English translations are becoming more and more in-demand.\n\nThus, to translate webtoons from Korean to English correctly, webtoon translators and localizers should possess strong creative writing and translation skills, as well as a profound understanding of cultures. Besides this, it is also vital to be an ace at conveying meaning rather than just translating words to another language. The translator should grasp the subtle nuances of the dialogues and details without betraying the sense and feel of a scene.\n\nAs one of the leading manga translation companies, CCCI offers official manhwa or webtoon translation services from Korean to English, English to French, English to German, and many other languages.\n\nManga and comics translation is one of our flagship services. We have a dedicated team of manga and webtoon translators and typesetters who provide flawless translation and meticulous localization services for every project. They possess a comprehensive knowledge of the Japanese and Korean subculture, convey the appropriate tone of language, and make the text seamlessly blend with the images. Thanks to our ineffable experience, we guarantee that the feeling of the comics is delivered appropriately in the target language.\n\nThe work is highly creative. Based on our and many other manga and webtoon translators’ experiences, the work does not only require translation and linguistic skills but also writing skills. We have resources for more than 30 languages to enable the simultaneous distribution of translated webtoons worldwide.\n\nMoreover, we make small and huge adjustments on the level of the sentence, phrases, word usages, or typography to meet the clients’ needs, while ensuring a high level of entertainment for the intended audience no matter the genre, whether fantasy, light novels, seinen, shōjo, shōnen, josei, romance, a slice of life, action, or anything else.\n\nFor the past 10 years, CCC International has contributed to the spread of manga and comics culture. We help translate Japanese manga, American comics, Korean manhwa, French bande dessinée, Chinese manhua, digital comics called webtoons, and many more, into major Asian and European languages."
