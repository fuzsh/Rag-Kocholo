        "text": "Synopsis\n\n‘Kalki 2898 AD,’ the highly anticipated film starring Prabhas and Deepika Padukone, has encountered issues prior to its theatrical release. The trailer has captivated audiences with its depiction of a post-apocalyptic world awaiting the birth of Kalki, a messianic figure from Hindu scriptures. However, the filmmakers face accusations of plagiarizing the work of South Korean artist Sung Choi.\n\n‘Kalki 2898 AD’, the much-awaited Prabhas-Deepika Padukone-starrer has run into trouble even before its theatrical release. The trailer has ignited the audience’s curiosity and intrigue about the post-apocalyptic world which is awaiting the birth of Kalki, a messiah-like figure in the Hindu scriptures. However, the makers have come under criticism for plagiarising the work of a South Korean artist named Sung Choi.\n\nChoi took to Instagram and shared one of his artworks along with a screenshot of the beginning of the trailer which showcases a city torn apart by war. The image bears an unmistakable resemblance to one of his artworks. Sharing the post, he wrote, \"Unauthorized use of the artwork is a bad practice. This makes me question doing art in this lawless environment. @Kalki2898AD @VyjayanthiFilms #kalki2898ad.”\n\nNetizens flooded his comment section and called out the makers of ‘Kalki 2898 AD’ for plagiarising Choi’s labour of love without giving him credit.\n\n“I hope you pursue legal action if possible. This is awful,” wrote an Instagram user in the comments section. Another commented, “The whole trailer gives off the vibe of Epoch, Mad Max, Dune, and other films. The trailer of the film gives me the vibe of the Saga comic book series published by Image Comics. A lot of designs from the trailer of the film are ripped off from the Halo series and Death Stranding too. Idk how some of the concept designers who worked on the film can stay silent.”\n\nChoi is an artist based in South Korea. He has worked with Hollywood companies such as Marvel Studios, Disney, Warner Bros, and Netflix Animation.\n\nRedditors also called out the producers for not giving Choi his due. “This is shameful and disappointing. They just copied and pasted a 10-year-old artwork on literally the first frame of the trailer. Even the weapons and other stuff look directly ‘inspired’ by so many games and movies. I wonder what else people will spot that will be without any credits. I’m too afraid to post this in Tollywood sub because of fanboys,” wrote one.\n\nAbout ‘Kalki 2898 AD’\n\nKalki 2898 AD transports viewers to a dystopian future where survival is challenging in the city of Kashi. As citizens and scientists anticipate an incarnation, Ashwathama from the Mahabharata emerges after decades of seclusion. The film is set to hit theaters on June 27.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n10 stocks that can defy the yen upheaval, as Sensex comes out of Dow shadow\n\nThree reasons why Mumbai, NCR beat Bengaluru in the IPO treasure hunt\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nIs the great Indian snacking boom slowing down finally?\n\n3 key things Nirmala Sitharaman can do to restore Buddha’s legacy, draw global tourists\n\nAnalysing Hindenburg’s three key allegations against Sebi’s Madhabi Buch\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
