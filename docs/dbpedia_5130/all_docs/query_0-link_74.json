        "text": "A celebrated figurative painter who only gained critical attention in her sixties, Maria Lassnig (1919–2014) coined the term \"body-awareness painting\" to describe her intention to depict not an external view of physical feelings but their perception from within. The epiphany came when she was sitting in her studio, about to make a self-portrait. Feeling the chair pressing against her body, she realized that a true representation would focus on that sensation – soft flesh against hard wood – rather than what the body looked like at a distance. Many of her later works reveal the ageing body and the frustration the artist felt at the physical limitations imposed by age. Krankenhaus (Hospital), painted when Lassnig was in her eighties, is a composition split horizontally. In the top half, three heads resting on pillows are fearful and pained – one is reminiscent of the face in Edvard Munch’s famous The Scream (1893) – and suggest the patients’ misery, lying helpless and anxious beneath the uniform, institutional lights. The bottom half, like an X-ray of what lies under the bedclothes, reveals two grotesque, misshapen bodies with absent limbs and gaping wounds. The work is a powerful depiction of the wretched reality of ill health and incapacity in old age.\n\nTHE HINTERLAND\n\nGlenn Brown\n\n2006\n\nFrom afar this ambiguous painting appears to depict a bizarre, cartoon-like head. Closer up, an even more grotesque form emerges, from which arms and hands sprout and an embedded eyeball stares out. The creature’s flesh seems to be made from lashings of thick, viscous oil paint, but the surface of Brown’s (b.1966) painting is entirely flat; each apparent agglomeration of paint and gestural brushstroke has been laboriously created with small brushes and layer upon layer of thinned paint. Brown plunders imagery from art history and popular culture to make his own twisted versions of other artist’s paintings. Here the artist continues to borrow from the art of the past but without any obvious references pieces together numerous fragments from unidentified artworks to form a monstrous, mutant head of his own imagining. Recognizing that most art is primarily encountered through reproduction, Brown’s preferred source materials are art books, posters and postcards, which are scanned into his computer and then digitally collaged together. For this painting limbs, body parts, poses and gestures from across art history were distorted in various ways and combined to form a complex image that hovers between abstraction and figuration.\n\nTHE BLINDFOLDED MAN\n\nMarlene Dumas\n\n2007\n\nMarlene Dumas paints portraits of figures, often focusing on the head or face. She draws her subjects from politics, news reports and popular culture, and is often inspired by photographs in newspapers or magazines, though she also creates portraits of herself and her family, particularly her daughter, whom she has painted since she was a young child. The themes in her work will often be harrowing or difficult: The Blindfolded Man is one of a series of paintings portraying torture victims, and she has created many images of the dead, including of children. Another theme focuses on portraits of controversial or complex public figures, including Osama Bin Laden, singer Amy Winehouse, record producer and convicted murderer Phil Spector, and Princess Diana. A 2008 portrait, titled Dead Marilyn, was inspired by an autopsy photograph of Marilyn Monroe and presents the actress as blotchy, bloated and virtually unrecognizable. Working with oil paint as well as watercolor and ink, Dumas’s style is often simple, with the features of her figures minimally expressed. The colors she uses are muted, adding to the melancholic tone of her work. Dumas was born in Cape Town in 1953 and raised in rural South Africa, though she moved to Amsterdam in 1974 where she continues to live.\n\nORGY COMPOSITION\n\nGeorge Condo\n\n2008\n\nSince the start of his career in the early 1980s, the richly inventive creations of George Condo (b.1957) have merged the beautiful with the grotesque, and the recognizable with the profoundly strange. Deeply engaged with the traditions of Old Master painting, as well as with twentieth-century comics and cartoons, Condo’s art filters the past through the outlandish humour and imagination of a decidedly contemporary sensibility. Featuring an invented cast of tragi- comic characters, often pictured in the throes of frantic desperation, unhinged rage or manic glee, his paintings arouse horror, fascination and delight. It is tempting to read many of Condo’s paintings, including Orgy Composition, as social allegory, reflecting a society oscillating between irrational exuberance and crashing despair. They offer biting commentary on contemporary culture’s noisy and continuous stream of scandals, meltdowns and celebrity shenanigans. In Condo’s words, they reflect the \"madness of everyday life,\" evoking \"the idea of what is going on behind closed doors in religion, within corporations like Enron, in the private home or in the psychiatrist’s chair.\" Speaking of his brothel paintings, Condo says \"they may not be pretty, but I think we can all see ourselves in these pictures. They are so hideous and yet so utterly real.\"\n\nPIE FACE\n\nLisa Yuskavage\n\n2008\n\nA young woman, naked except for underwear and thigh-high socks, poses for the viewer in front of a draped sheet, a small bunch of flowers in her hand. Her face is smeared with cream, obscuring her facial features, as though she has been recently hit in the face with a pie. Lisa Yuskavage’s (b.1962) painting maintains the tradition of the female nude through a sly combination of satire and homage. Here, the nude has been taken down from her pedestal, both literally and figuratively; the pie in the face is a long-established mark of disrespect. Her physique is also exaggerated to comic effect: her breasts and hips enlarged in accordance with a kitschy sexuality that makes women into simpering, coquettish flirts, performing for the benefit of men. The implied viewer of this picture might well be a cartoonish version of an average consumer of Renaissance nudes, for whom the female body was ever available and ever compliant. However, despite its comic distortion of the female body, Yuskavage’s painting is made with old-fashioned attention to naturalistic space and tone, and the work is tempered by an attention to anatomical logic that gives the figure its immediacy and presence.\n\nARMPIT\n\nEllen Altfest\n\n2011\n\nIn Armpit, Ellen Altfest (b.1970) presents a part of the body that is rarely depicted in visual culture, and indeed regarded with disgust in many contemporary societies due to associations with uncleanliness and odour. While the stretch marks and blue veins hardly suggest celebratory inten tions, the scrupulous, obsessive skill of Altfest’s brushwork makes it difficult not to admire the image, consequently elevating the unorthodox, humble subject matter. After developing a distinctive, highly detailed style in her paintings of domestic plants, trees and vegetables, Altfest began a series of male nude studies with the candid, full-frontal work The Penis (2006). In this, as in many of her compositions, the subject is tightly edited and framed. She frequently fragments the body into isolated parts – hand, foot, back – that offer little indication of the overall form or identity of the sitter. Yet Altfest’s images are faithful records of the observed world, in hyperreal close up, beyond the human eye’s usual perceptive capacity. The small format and painstaking detail invite the viewer to examine her paintings at an intrusively close range. Revealing every crease of skin, bulging blood vessel and individual hair, Altfest’s work is at once voyeuristically revelatory and technically masterful."
