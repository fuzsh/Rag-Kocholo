        "text": "Picture Location Description On the ground before the Animus, at the end where Desmond's head rested. The Eye of Providence Immediately before the door that Warren Vidic and Lucy Stillman used to leave the laboratory. Triangle and Apple, an original design resembling a pyramid which consists of a series of eyes bound within a triangle with a radiating apple directly above it. It symbolizes the Templars' plan to send the Eye-Abstergo satellite with a Piece of Eden to join the Akashic Satellite Plexus in orbit to control humanity.[8] On the ground before the Animus, between the Eye of Providence and Pyramid of Eden. The Square of Writing, when read from bottom to top and right to left, spells out \"Artefacts sent to the skies to control all nations, to make us obey a hidden crusade. Do not help them.\" Note the British English spelling of Artefacts. On the ground before the Animus, next to where Desmond's right hand lay. The upside-down pentagram is usually associated with evil and Satanism. Note that one prong of the star points directly to the head of the Animus: this is an attempt by Subject 16 to show that the Animus is used for evil purposes. Whilst throughout history the pentagram is usually affiliated with Satanic rituals, its origin comes from the Roman goddess Venus, as the planet Venus forms a pentagram in space. This is Clay's way of explaining that Venus and many other gods from Greek and Roman mythology were actually Isu.[8] On the floor before the Animus, where Desmond's feet rested. The Pyramid of Letters, when read from bottom to top and right to left, spells out \"They drained my soul and made it theirs. I drain my body to show you where I saw it.\" On the floor before the Animus, behind the Pyramid of Letters. Barcode and Date: Both the Interleaved 2 of 5 barcode and numbers in middle-endian format make reference to the date 21 December 2012. Found on the floor before the Animus, near where Desmond's head rested. Borromean Rings In a corner, past the Pyramid of Letters. Nazca Lines of a hummingbird, monkey, and spider. Between the entrances to the conference room and Desmond's quarters. Yonaguni is a Japanese island with an underwater formation that could be man-made. Adjacent to the text are 3 symbols: outlines of Mount Fuji, a Japanese torii, and two Nara-style pagodas. Next to the platform near to the entrance of the Animus laboratory. The Eye of Ra. While this may be a reference to Ra, Egypt, and all related Pieces of Eden, it can also refer to the Ordo Templi Orientis, a Germano-Austrian esoteric order similar to the Freemasons which was believed to be related to the Knights Templar and which had the Eye of Ra drawn at the top of their lamen. On the platform near to the entrance of the Animus laboratory. Three Triangles, most likely indicating the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt. On the platform near to the entrance of the Animus laboratory. Step pyramid, a common symbol of Mayan and Egyptian architecture. On the platform near to the entrance of the conference room. Mountain Valley, most likely Machu Picchu. Message Description Mandelbrot Set zn+1 = zn2 + c A Mandelbrot Set formula עולם הבא Hebrew for Olam Haba, or \"The world to come\" in Judaism after the Messiah's arrival. 13.0.0.0.0 In the Mayan Long Count calendar, this corresponds to the date 21 December 2012. We are all books containing thousands of pages and within each of them lies an IRREPARABLE truth The 'books' are an analogy for humans, with the 'thousands of pages' symbolizing countless ancestors' memories; therefore, the truth cannot be erased or 'repaired', even when the Templars try to 'rewrite' history.[8] الزلزلة Al-Zalzala; Arabic for \"The Quake\", the title of Sura 99] in the Quran. An Omega symbol with a dot in the center. See also 22.13, below. 22.13 A Bible reference to Revelation 22:13: \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\" This verse is a declaration of God's power over the world, which the Templars strove to achieve.[8] Lorenz attractor Within Emperor Jiajing's sin and Quetzcoaltz's hunger lies the Answers The Jiajing Emperor's sins include ignoring established rites, isolating himself from court and relying on unqualified individuals to handle affairs of state, exiling or killing dissidents, overspending public funds on monuments, religious intolerance, self-aggrandizement, and cruelty.[9] 'Quetzcoaltz' is a misspelling of Quetzalcōātl, the Aztec sun god. The Aztecs believed the gods required regular human sacrifices for nourishment. I've entered the Abyss and never returned Subject 16 briefly explains who he is and what happened to him. 不聞不若聞之 聞之不若見之 見之不若知之 知之不若行之 Chinese for \"Hearing is better than not hearing, observing is better than hearing, knowing is better than observing, and doing is better than knowing.\" 前事不忘後事之師 Chinese for \"One who does not forget what was before is the master of what comes after.\""
