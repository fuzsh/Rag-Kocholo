        "text": "Huey, Dewey, and Louie are Donald Duck's triplet nephews created by Ted Osborne and Al Taliaferro. They first appeared in the 1937 comic strip and corresponding 1938 animated short Donald's Nephews. Traditionally, the boys are identified by the three primary colors of red, blue, and green. Disney archivist Dave Smith once said, \"Note that the brightest hue of the three is red (Huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (Dewey), and that leaves Louie, and leaves are green.\"\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie were originally created as gag characters for the purpose of provoking Donald's temper. Their conception drew inspiration from the archetypal \"unruly children\" that had previously appeared in cartoons throughout the early 1900s, such as Frederick Burr Opper's Happy Hooligan. To keep the characters from growing stale, story artists Carl Barks and Harry Reeves further developed the nephews as a subversion of patriarchal standards wherein they display greater competence and maturity than their uncle, Donald.\n\nBarks incorporated the nephews as regular players in his comic stories, where they often accompanied their grand-uncle, Scrooge McDuck, on globe-trotting expeditions. Barks envisioned the nephews as being \"the brains of the place\" and recontextualized their trickster behavior as a method of self-defense against foes, namely Donald.[5] The nephews have also been portrayed as being members of the Junior Woodchucks scouting group, and as such, they regularly consult the Junior Woodchucks' Guidebook to resolve their problems.\n\nThroughout their appearances in both screen and print, the nephews had largely been indistinguishable beyond their color-coded apparel. In 1987, Huey, Dewey, and Louie appeared extensively in the animated television series DuckTales, the success of which spawned a reboot in 2017. This reimagining would define and develop the nephews as individual personalities; Huey as the mature eldest, Dewey as the attention-seeking middle child, and Louie as a treasure-obsessed loafer.\n\nBackground\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie are the sons of Donald's sister, Della Duck, however, in Donald's Nephews, their mother is instead named Dumbella. In the original theatrical shorts, they were originally sent to visit Donald for only one day; in the comics, the three were sent to stay with Donald on a temporary basis until their father came back from the hospital (the boys ended up sending him there after a practical joke of putting firecrackers under his chair). In both the comics and animated shorts, the boys' parents were never heard from or referred to again after these instances, resulting in the boys ending up permanently living with Donald, in keeping with Disney's usual elimination of kid characters' parents. All four of them live in the city of Duckburg in the state of Calisota.\n\nThe boys are noted for having both identical appearances and personalities in most appearances, with the three sometimes shown as finishing each other's sentences as a running joke. In the theatrical shorts, Huey, Dewey, and Louie would often behave in a rambunctious manner, sometimes committing retaliation or revenge on their uncle Donald for something he did to them. In the comics, however, as developed by Al Taliaferro and Carl Barks, the boys are usually depicted in a more well-behaved manner, usually helping their uncle Donald and great-uncle Scrooge McDuck in the adventure at hand. In the early Barks comics, the ducklings were still wild and unruly, but their characters improved considerably due to their membership in the Junior Woodchucks and the good influence of their wise old great-grandmother Grandma Duck.\n\nPersonalities and appearance\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie are Donald Duck's mischievous nephews, who have a usual rivalry with him. While they each have a distinct character trait, they share some similarities. All three are shown to be crafty and troublesome and usually think alike. In some earlier cartoons, they would often argue among themselves and have been shown to whine and cry. But in later films, they are seen to agree on pretty much everything. All three also share joy in tormenting Donald for their own amusement (such as when they tied him in his own hammock). However, this is sometimes an act of revenge from a prank committed by Donald instead (such as when he imitated Ajax the Gorilla and they did the exact same thing, inadvertently endangering their uncle's life if they hadn't sprayed both Ajax and Donald with tear gas). Individually, the personalities and quirks of the boys were inspired by real-life sibling dynamics. Huey is the eldest triplet, so he acts the most responsible. Dewey is the middle child and just wants to stand out. Louie, the youngest, often shows that he prefers to appreciate a lazy lifestyle.\n\nDespite the rivalry, they love their uncle very dearly, and he loves them, too.[6][7]\n\nThese young ducks have white feathers and amber bills and webbed feet. Their eyes are oval and light blue with black pupils. Often their eyes are simply black. Their shirts are in different colors, with the most common color arrangement being Huey in red, Dewey in blue, and Louie in green (except in many printed comics, in which all three of their shirts are instead colored black).\n\nIn most appearances, they are children no older than 10. In a number of Carl Barks' stories, they were instead portrayed as kindergartners (Kite Weather, The Crazy Quiz Show and Want to Buy and Island?); Another Barks story, Truant Officer Duck, depicts the boys in second grade, putting them around 7–8 years old. In the DuckTales episode \"Yuppy Ducks\", it is stated several times that they are 10 years old in that episode, and in \"Bubbeo & Juliet\", the nephews begin their fifth grade school year. However, in the later episode \"Bubba's Big Brainstorm\", Louie says Bubba the Cave Duck is in first grade, yet Bubba is also shown to be in the same class as the triplets, implying them all to be in first grade despite the previous fifth grade and 10-years-old episodes. Meanwhile, they are uniquely depicted in Quack Pack not as young children but instead as teenagers who, by the time of the episode \"Need 4 Speed\", are old enough to drive.\n\nIn the 2017 reboot of DuckTales, each triplet wears newly updated clothing to differentiate from each other: Huey wears a red polo T-shirt while still retaining his colored hat as seen in previous appearances. Dewey wears a long-sleeved shirt inside his normal T-shirt. Louie wears a green hoodie.\n\nThe distinct character traits of each of the boys seemed to have a large impact on their personalities in the DuckTales reboot.\n\nIn 2017's DuckTales, Huey's role as leader is validated by him being the eldest triplet (by three seconds)[8] and the most responsible. Huey is tactical and has a strict sense of order. He shares Scrooge McDuck's intelligence, but values the safety of others (as well as himself) more so than \"the next big adventure\". As the oldest sibling, Huey often acts as a caretaker for Dewey and Louie when Donald or Scrooge are absent. The younger ducklings look to Huey for comfort, despite the fact that his persnickety attitude can annoy them at times. Along with Dewey and Louie, Huey is also a member of the Junior Woodchucks, though he takes the position much more seriously. Huey usually has the official Junior Woodchuck guidebook by his side at all times, and will consult it when trouble arises. According to co-executive producer Frank Angones, Huey's intelligence is due to him being responsible for paying the bills while living with Donald.[9]\n\nIn the 1987 DuckTales series episode \"Duck in the Iron Mask\", Dewey had an identity crisis, as he wanted to separate himself from the trio to stand out on his own. This carried over into the 2017 reboot, in which Dewey's \"middle child syndrome\" has made him obsessed with attention and standing out from the crowd. He typically goes about this by trying to embark on death-defying adventures, alone, as a way to prove himself as someone special. This can drive Dewey to act selfishly at times (he also created the \"Day of the Only Child!\", in which the triplets act as if they have no siblings), but he still cares deeply for his family. Officially, Dewey's full name is Dewford Dingus Duck.[4] In the episode \"The Town Where Everyone Was Nice!\", it is stated that, when the triplets were eggs, Donald dropped one of them while juggling with them. Upon hearing this, Louie and Huey looked at Dewey and nodded at each other, implying that some (if not all) of Dewey's personality traits in the series are product of brain damage.\n\n\"A Nightmare on Killmotor Hill!\" suggests that he is far more devastated by the fact that his mother was trapped in the moon for 10 years, than he himself realizes, as he claims that in all of his dreams there's an image of him in a moon created by his tears, yet he doesn't know the reason why it always appears nor what it is suppose to mean. The episode also implies that he isn't sure of his sexual orientation, as, during his high school dream, he finds a figure which is meant to represent his love interest, which lacks a form as he is too threatened by the concept. However, when the figure asks Dewey to sing a duet, both male and female voices can be heard from it.\n\nIn 2017's DuckTales, Louie is portrayed as the most laid-back of the brothers. While adventurous in his own right, Louie would much rather loaf around on the couch while watching TV all day. For all his laziness, Louie is also incredibly crafty and intelligent. Like Scrooge, he loves treasure, having grown under the assumption that his life will be easier with more money due to being raised by his broken uncle,[9] but doesn't want to actually put in the work to earn an honest living. Instead, he resorts to creating \"get-rich-quick\" schemes in hopes of making a buck by doing as little work as possible. Louie takes after Gladstone Gander in this regard, whom he affectionately refers to as \"Uncle Gladstone\". Because of his mischievous ways, Huey, Dewey, and Webby refer to Louie as the \"evil triplet\", which he takes in stride. Louie has a moral compass, however. Though he loves money, he will never resort to endangering others for the sake of getting it. In fact, Louie is the most vulnerable and emotional of the triplets. Behind his mellow attitude, he is somewhat of a coward, which plays into why he'd rather lounge around at home than partake in Scrooge's adventures.\n\nVoices\n\nIn most of their animated portrayals, the nephews speak with a similar \"duck speech\" as their Uncle Donald. As such, Clarence Nash - who originated the voice of Donald - gave the boys the exact same trick voice as their uncle, which lasted for a number of decades until the 1960s.\n\nFrom the '60s onward, there was an effort to make the boys more intelligible than Donald, while still maintaining a duck-like quality in their voices. This began with Dick Beals, who voiced the boys in the animated educational films Scrooge McDuck and Money and Donald's Fire Survival Plan as well as Tony Pope in the 1978 Disney Read-Along album Dumbo's Day at the Circus, but was cemented with the introduction of Russi Taylor in the late 1980s. Russi's portrayal of the triplets was so well-received that she continued to voice them in a majority of their speaking roles until her death in 2019. Tony Anselmo also performed the nephews in Down and Out with Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse Works, House of Mouse, and Have a Laugh! for voiceovers using the same voice as their uncle Donald but with slightly high-pitched voices.\n\nIn the episode DuckTales episode \"Duck to the Future\", adult versions of the triplets were voiced by Hal Smith.\n\nIn Quack Pack, the boys are given distinct personalities, and therefore each given separate voices: Jeannie Elias voices Huey, Pamela Adlon voices Dewey, and E.G. Daily voices Louie. A similar method was used for the DuckTales reboot, of which Huey, Dewey, and Louie are voiced by Danny Pudi, Ben Schwartz, and Bobby Moynihan, respectively.\n\nHistory\n\n1937-1940; Creation\n\nDevelopment of an animated short centering the nephews of Walt Disney's popular character, Donald Duck, had already been underway by 1937. The idea of Donald's nephews came from Al Taliaferro, who served as an artist for Disney's Silly Symphonies comic strip. A memo to Taliaferro from the animation story department (which included Carl Barks), dated February 5, 1937, reads, \"Inasmuch as we have decided to actually put a story crew to work on 'Donald's Nephews', we would like to recognize the source from which the original idea of these new characters sprang... Thanks.\"[10] Their names were devised by Disney gag man Dana Coty, who was inspired by the names Huey Long, Thomas Dewey, and Louis Schmitt, an animator at the Disney Studio in the 1930s and 1940s. It has also been noted that the duck triplets were influenced by Mickey Mouse's nephews, Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse. Before the short's completion, Taliaferro featured the nephews in the comic strip simply titled Donald's Nephews, released on October 17, 1937.\n\nSix months afterward, the short of the same name would debut on April 15, 1938, and marked Huey, Dewey, and Louie's first animated appearance. In the short, Huey, Dewey, and Louie were portrayed as wily and mischievous, while Donald's perspective was an exaggerated look at the difficulties of parenting. The tone, like most of Donald's cartoons, was comedic and filled with adversarial hijinks, and this battle-of-wits relationship between Donald and the boys would become a staple in the former's animated career from that moment forward.\n\n1940-1960\n\nOver the span of 27 theatrical short cartoons, Huey, Dewey, and Louie were amongst Donald Duck's most frequent adversaries (rivaled only by Chip and Dale, who first encountered Donald in 1947). They were interchangeable, having the exact same physical appearance, personality traits, and voices (usually provided by Clarence \"Ducky\" Nash, who also voiced Donald). Their colors varied by short except red, which had always appeared on at least one of the triplets sans 1941's The Nifty Nineties, where they all wore blue. Throughout the late '40s and 1950s, all three of the nephews wore red.\n\nOver the course of their career, while still filled with comedic slapstick, the relationship between the boys and Donald became slightly more domesticated and down-to-earth. In 1942's The New Spirit, for example, Donald listed the boys as his dependents on his tax form, which also stated that they were legally adopted by him.\n\n1960-1990\n\nAfter the conclusion of the theatrical Donald Duck shorts with 1961's The Litterbug (which co-starred the boys) Huey, Dewey, and Louie would appear in 1967's Scrooge McDuck and Money, released nearly a year after Walt Disney's death. As the name suggests, it starred Scrooge McDuck, a character created by Carl Barks for Disney comic strips, who first appeared two decades earlier in 1947. The boys had previously interacted with Scrooge regularly on the printed page, but never before in animation until this point.\n\nThe boys would not appear on the silver screen again until 1983's Mickey's Christmas Carol, where they were briefly seen trimming a Christmas tree during Fezziwig's party.\n\nIn 1987, Huey, Dewey, and Louie once again co-starred alongside Scrooge McDuck in Sport Goofy in Soccermania. In the television special, the boys team up with Scrooge and Goofy to win back the latter's coveted trophy by beating the Beagle Boys in a soccer game. Russi Taylor (most famously known for her work as Minnie Mouse) voiced the boys for the first time here, and she would reprise her role numerous times in the following decades. Months later marked the debut of DuckTales, an animated series part of the Disney Afternoon television block. It was based on the Carl Barks Uncle Scrooge comics and centered the miserly duck on his globe-trotting adventures, with Huey, Dewey, and Louie under his care following Donald's enlistment in the U.S. Navy. The short established what would become Huey, Dewey, and Louie's trademark colors: red, blue and green. Disney archivist Dave Smith once said, \"Note that the brightest hue of the three is red (Huey), the color of water, dew, is blue (Dewey), and that leaves Louie, and leaves are green.\"\n\n1990-present\n\nIn 1996, after the huge success of DuckTales, Huey, Dewey, and Louie would star in their own series, Quack Pack, which significantly featured them as teenagers. The series ran for one season, and a total of 39 episodes.\n\nIn 2017, Disney debuted a reboot of DuckTales. The producers of the series made an effort to develop the nephews into their own, individual characters. They also established that the order of how audiences say their names - \"Huey, Dewey, and Louie\" - is also the order of their birth.[11] The series also removes Dewey and Louie's caps, leaving that signature design element for Huey.\n\nFilms and television\n\nDuckTales\n\nThe boys later starred in the 1987 animated television series DuckTales as the main protagonists, in which they appeared in adventures with their great-uncle Scrooge McDuck (due to Donald having enlisted in the U.S. Navy). The boys' personalities were mainly based on their comic book appearances as opposed to the ones in the theatrical shorts. The series focuses on the boys' life with Scrooge while Donald is off serving in the Navy.\n\nThroughout the course of the series, the boys come to know various characters such as Launchpad McQuack (Scrooge's personal pilot and bumbling sidekick), Gyro Gearloose (a wacky inventor whose convoluted inventions constantly cause mayhem in Duckburg), Scrooge's maid, Mrs. Beakley and her granddaughter, Webby. With all these characters, the boys create strong, family-oriented bonds that last the entire series. Specifically with Webby, who acts as the \"honorary niece\" at times, with the young girl duckling even referring to Scrooge as \"Uncle Scrooge\", like the boys. Even so, Huey, Dewey, and Louie have often expressed dislike of having Webby tag along on their adventures.\n\nThey also meet several of Scrooge's enemies and are often their targets in the villains' plots to overtake Scrooge--Magica De Spell (a wicked sorceress) is one of the many antagonists, along with Scrooge's rival Flintheart Glomgold and, most notably, the infamous Beagle Boys, who are some of the more bumbling foes the boys face, though they still cause a great threat to McDuck's fortune due to their enormously large family.\n\nIn 1990, the boys starred alongside Scrooge in DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp. In this film, the boys must help Scrooge defeat a powerful wizard named Merlock in his quest to dominate the world through the use of a genie's magic.\n\nQuack Pack\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie also starred in the 1996 TV series Quack Pack, in which the three were portrayed as teenagers and their full names were given as Hubert Duck, Deuteronomy D. Duck[3], and Louis Duck. In Quack Pack, the boys were given more distinct personalities, with Huey being something of a ladies' man, Dewey as a computer whiz and Louie as a comic book geek. Most episodes revolved around the boys' mischievous nature and often getting into trouble with their Uncle Donald, the only duck to retain his \"quacking\"-style voice.\n\nIn some episodes, including the series' pilot, the boys would become their superhero alter egos known as \"The T-Squad\". Huey had the ability of super speed, Dewey had incredible intelligence and psychic powers and Louie held the power of super-strength. All of them also showed the ability of flight in \"The Return of the T-Squad\". The hero forms were provided by their great-uncle Ludwig Von Drake.\n\nMickey Mouse Works\n\nIn Mickey Mouse Works, the boys played recurring roles. Like their original classic cartoon appearances, the boys would often battle Donald. In the series, they were voiced by Tony Anselmo.\n\nIn \"Donald's Rocket Ruckus\", the boys attempted to ride an attraction they were too short for.\n\nIn \"Survival of the Woodchucks\", they followed the guidelines of the Junior Woodchucks but retaliated against Donald when they learned that he didn't pass the survival test.\n\nOne of their most notable appearances in the series is in \"Mickey's Remedy\", where they were babysat by Mickey while Donald went out. They tricked Mickey into spoiling them until Mickey learned of their trick. As punishment, Mickey had the boys believe that they were dying until they promised to change their ways.\n\nMickey's Once Upon a Christmas\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie appeared in the 1999 direct-to-video film, once again voiced by Russi Taylor.\n\nIn the film, the boys star in a segment where they wish for Christmas every day, which is them reliving the exact same day from before in a never-ending loop due to the wish's effects. The first two days are great, but then become increasingly annoying afterward. When they try to fix time, they sabotage Christmas in order to mix things up. Despite this, they ended up destroying and ruining Christmas. When Donald is hit by the Christmas tree, instead of yelling at the boys and losing his temper, as usual, he just lies there depressed and humiliated, and the boys realize what they did was the worst thing they've ever done. Feeling guilty and wanting to redeem themselves, they make sure the next day became the greatest Christmas they ever had. This restores the balance to their family and the daily Christmas ends.\n\nThey later appear during the grand finale, singing Christmas carols with the other characters.\n\nHouse of Mouse\n\nIn House of Mouse, the boys served as the club's band, first calling themselves the Quackstreet Boys (an obvious parody of the Backstreet Boys). They then changed their name to the Splashing Pumpkins (parodying the Smashing Pumpkins) but went back to being the Quackstreet Boys in later episodes. Other names have been used as well, such as QuackWerk, Plymouth Rock, and Kid Duck. Like in Mickey Mouse Works, they were voiced by Tony Anselmo, although they were portrayed as teenagers like in Quack Pack.\n\nThe boys' biggest role in the series was in the episode \"Music Day\", which showed them breaking up after arguing over which one of them was the leader during a photoshoot, forcing Mickey, Donald, and Goofy to try to reunite them before the show ends.\n\nIn \"Pete's House of Villains\", when the club was briefly taken over by Pete, they were replaced by the Three Little Wolves.\n\nThey also appear trapped in the club with the other characters in Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse.\n\nMickey's Twice Upon a Christmas\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie are brought into the third dimension in the CGI sequel.\n\nIn their starring segment of the film, they realize they are on the Naughty List this year. In order to receive presents, they leave home and have a grand adventure in Santa Claus' workshop in The North Pole. They once again ruin Christmas by accidentally making a mess on Santa's workshop but redeem themselves by saving it again. But when they finally find the list's room, they write Scrooge's name instead of theirs. Due to their good deeds, they receive presents and a \"Thank You\" note from Santa himself.\n\nThey play supporting roles in Donald's segment, where they are seen under the care of Daisy, wanting Donald to come with them for Christmas festivities. However, Donald's grumpy attitude towards the holidays and his desire to be left alone prevent such a thing from happening peacefully. After a mishap at the mall's Christmas show where Donald destroys the Christmas display in a fit of rage, Daisy sadly takes the boys out without their uncle, disappointed in him for his selfish behavior and lack of Christmas spirit. Later, Donald's Christmas spirit eventually gets the better of him, allowing he and his family to reconcile. They join the others outside around the big Christmas tree to sing \"We Wish You A Merry Christmas.\"\n\nThe boys reappear at the end of the film, singing Christmas carols with the other characters in Mickey's house.\n\nMickey Mouse\n\nIn the episode \"Black and White\", the boys can be seen walking past the movie theater at the very beginning of the episode. In this appearance, they appear wearing black shirts along with caps sporting their traditional colors.\n\nThe boys later appear in \"No\" (donning outfits similar to the ones they wore in Mr. Duck Steps Out), where they take advantage of Mickey's inability to say the word \"no\" by asking to borrow toilet paper and using it to teepee his house, taunting him afterward. In the end, the boys are seen with the other characters of the episode, returning their favors by giving Mickey three new rolls of toilet paper and in asking Mickey to join the latter in watching TV.\n\nThe boys reappear in \"Duck the Halls: A Mickey Mouse Christmas Special\", where they join Scrooge, Ludwig Von Drake, and Daisy on a winter migration to a beach resort in the south. They are notably upset by Donald's absence, who chose to stay with Mickey in the north to celebrate Christmas. When Donald falls ill due to the cold weather, Mickey rushes him to the boys and other ducks. As they're all together, the boys learn that Christmas can be spent anywhere, and thusly do so with their blood and extended family.\n\nThey also take part in the town's annual \"Three-Legged Race\" (each hopping on one leg) in the episode of the same name, and attend Mickey's birthday party in \"The Birthday Song\". In \"New Shoes\", they join Scrooge, Chip, Dale, and Spike the Bee in tormenting Donald.\n\nDuckTales (2017)\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie return in the reboot series with their full names given this time as Hubert Duck, Dewford Dingus Duck[4], and Llewellyn Duck. They are featured in the series with distinct appearances, voices, and personalities, though they each take after their Uncle Scrooge in some way: Huey has Scrooge's intelligence, Dewey has Scrooge's fearlessness, and Louie shares Scrooge's greediness.\n\nEach season gives one triplet predominant focus, as Season 1 mostly focuses on Dewey, Season 2 mostly focuses on Louie, and Season 3 mostly focuses on Huey.\n\nAbout 10–12 years of age,[12][13] the series depicts the nephews as having been raised by Donald since birth, due to the absence of their mother, Della Duck. Together, the family lives in the Duckburg harbor in Donald's houseboat, and although the nephews love their uncle, they eventually grow tired of his overprotective and \"boring\" ways. In \"Woo-oo!\", they plot to use the houseboat to sail the seas and explore nearby cities while Donald is at a job interview, but their plan backfires. With no other option, Donald sends the boys to stay with Scrooge McDuck, his housekeeper, Bentina Beakley, and Beakley's granddaughter, Webby Vanderquack, for the time being. Scrooge is initially disgruntled by the sudden appearance of his great-nephews, but slowly comes to admire their adventurous spirits - so much so, that he invites them to join his expedition to find the lost city of Atlantis (on the condition that they keep it a secret from Donald).\n\nDonald, being on the same expedition with his new employer, Flintheart Glomgold, finds Scrooge and the boys in Atlantis and berates the former for putting his love of adventure before the safety of the family. To Donald's surprise, Dewey is able to use what he's learned from Scrooge to safely guide the family out of the sunken city and to safety. Back in Duckburg, Donald comes to terms with his nephews' love of adventure and allows them to visit Scrooge every so often. When the houseboat explodes, however (due to Dewey having accidentally left the engine running) Scrooge invites Donald and the boys to stay in McDuck Manor until Donald can fix the boat. Dewey uses the opportunity to analyze some of Scrooge's old keepsakes and discovers a portrait depicting Scrooge and Donald on an adventure, with Della by their side. Over the course of the first season, Dewey and Webby team up to learn more about Della. They discover that Della had stolen something from Scrooge called the \"Spear of Selene\" - a revelation that puts Della's moral alignment into question.\n\nOut of fear of worrying his brothers, Dewey keeps the investigation a secret from Huey and Louie, though he eventually confesses the truth in \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\". Both Huey and Louie rebuke Dewey for his secrecy, accusing him of acting selfishly. Dewey apologizes for this, and the brothers agree to band together to continue the investigation and learn the truth. By the time of \"The Last Crash of the Sunchaser!\", however, the uncertainty of Della's absence becomes too much for Dewey to handle, prompting him to demand the truth directly from Scrooge. A downhearted Scrooge explains that before the nephews had hatched, he, Donald and Della had been going on amazing adventures all around the world until there was a point in time when they had almost nowhere new to explore. This had prompted Della to have ambitions to explore outer space, knowing it was the most uncharted area of all. Scrooge manufactured a rocket dubbed The Spear of Selene to gift to Della in honor of the nephews' birth. Della discovered the rocket early, however, and stole it behind Scrooge's back. Through radio transmissions, Scrooge tried to navigate Della to safety, but she was caught in a cosmic storm and declared lost in space ever since. In response, Donald blamed Scrooge for the tragedy and adopted the boys as his own. Blaming their great-uncle for the loss of their mother without letting him explain what really happened, the boys resent Scrooge to the point of wanting to leave McDuck Manor and return to the bay. In \"The Shadow War!\", they are trying to get rid of all the souvenirs that they got on adventures with Scrooge right before they move to Cape Suzette the following day. Mrs. Beakley explained to the boys during a farewell party on what really happened and scolded them for turning their back on Scrooge. After some thinking, Donald and the boys realize how much they and Scrooge need one another, and decide to go back to the mansion to reconcile with him. As soon as they find out about Magica, they break into the mansion and manage to save Scrooge. They forgive him and the boys, Donald and the rest of Scrooge's workers are reinstated back into McDuck Manor.\n\nLouie, being inspired by Scrooge's success in the business world, decides to create his own company of Louie Inc, while he and his brothers come across a few more new faces known to their families such as their distant cousin Fethry Duck, and Donald's old college buddies Panchito Pistoles, and Jose Carioca.\n\nSoon after, Christmas had finally come with Huey decorating the Mansion, Louie writing a letter to Santa trying to reason with him to put him on the nice list after some bad things he did over the year, and Dewey sulking in his room, revealed to still be depressed over the realization of spending yet another Christmas without his mother. Dewey then discovers Scrooge with three spirits, with Scrooge explaining to Dewey that they accidentally haunted his home once, and from there on spent each Christmas crashing some of the greatest Christmas parties in history with them. As the four went off to travel back in time, Dewey had held onto the Future spirit's cloak, but fell into the snow and realized he had gone back in time, likely to when his mother hadn't yet disappeared. Dewey searches the mansion, only to run into a strange emo-looking kid, who was revealed to be Donald when he was close to Dewey's age. Dewey then goes with young Donald to the back of McDuck Manor to find his sister, Della, where she had been setting up traps to try and capture Santa Claus. They find her, but soon after the three ran into a giant Wendigo monster, and fight it off until they are able to tangle it into a rope Della had used earlier as a trap. Later, young Donald and Della decide to go back into the mansion to get Scrooge to deal with the monster, but not before Dewey hugged Della out of instinct, knowing how much he wanted to spend Christmas with her. Although Dewey wanted to warn his mother about what would happen years from then, Della and Donald reminded him not to as it would have disrupted the space-time continuum. After Donald and Della went back inside, future Scrooge picked up Dewey and took each other back to their present, where they sang some Christmas carols with the rest of their family for the remainder of the night.\n\nWhen Della Duck returned to Earth, she was surprised to learn their names, as she had planned to call the three Jet (Huey), Turbo (Dewey) and Rebel (Louie), even writing it down in case no one could understand Donald Duck. Dewey was initially shocked that he missed out on being called Turbo but Della comes to accept Huey, Dewey, and Louie as the three's names.\n\nUnlike the comics and 1987 series as well as other series, while all three were Woodchucks, only Huey served as an actual Woodchuck.\n\nCameos\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie appear in the opening animated intro to The Mickey Mouse Club. Unlike most of the shorts, they all wear blue shirts and red caps.\n\nIn the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Huey, Dewey, and Louie appear in a picture on a newspaper clipping in Eddie Valiant's office, describing how Eddie and his now-deceased brother Teddy saved them from an unknown kidnapper.\n\nHuey, Dewey and Louie appear in Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue, teaching Michael about the dangers of drugs.\n\nIn Once Upon a Studio, Huey, Dewey and Louie appears in the group photo for Disney's 100th anniversary.\n\nPrinted material\n\nWithin the comics, Huey, Dewey, and Louie often play a major role in most stories involving either their uncle Donald or great-uncle Scrooge McDuck, accompanying them on most of their adventures. Also seen in the comics is the boys' membership in a Boy Scouts of America-like organization called the Junior Woodchucks, including their use of the Junior Woodchucks Guidebook—a manual containing all manner of information on virtually every subject possible (however, there are some resources, such as the ancient libraries of Tralla La, that hold information not found in the guidebook). This excellent youth organization, which has twin goals of preserving knowledge and preserving the environment, was instrumental in transforming the three brothers from little hellions to upstanding young ducks. As such, they become a bedrock of sanity for their older relatives and valuable assets to them in the field.\n\nTrue to his jocular style, Duck comic artist and writer Don Rosa occasionally made subtle references as to what became of the nephews' parents. In his 1990s comic serial The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Rosa depicts how Scrooge first met his nephews, saying \"I'm not used to relatives, either! The few I had to seem to have... disappeared!\", to which Huey, Dewey, and Louie answer \"We know how that feels, Unca Scrooge!\"\n\nIn 2014 comic 80 is Prachtig, a Dutch Disney comic was published in honor of Donald's 80th anniversary, and it was finally explained what became of the nephews' mother. An astronaut, Della left her children with her brother Donald before leaving for a space trip. Years later when the nephews were able to see their mother on screen through a transmission in space, it was revealed that to Della it had only been 15 minutes since her departure from the space station. Nevertheless, the boys decide not to tell their mother the truth because they not only wouldn't want her to worry during her expedition, but they would also rather stay with Donald. The story was written by Evert Geradts and drawn by Maximino Tortajada Aguilar.\n\nVideo games\n\nDuckTales and DuckTales 2\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie all appear at certain points in the DuckTales NES games, including on the level select screen of the first game (where, due to color limitations, Dewey is colored as a second Louie). Throughout both of the games, the boys appear at select points in each of the levels to give hints to Scrooge about what he will need to do in order to progress through the levels. At one point in the Transylvania level in the first game, Huey is held hostage by one of the Beagle Boys and, after being rescued, tells Scrooge about the illusion wall in the level. The HD remake expands on this by having all three of the nephews get captured by the Beagle Boys in the new Money Bin level as well as in the Transylvania level.\n\nMickey Mouse Preschool\n\nPrior to the shooting game, the boys accidentally bump into their uncle Donald who is fixing up the laundry. After he leaves, Dewey encourages the player to shoot particular things such as letters, numbers, colors, and shapes marked on the board.\n\nDisney's Magical Quest 3\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie appear in the third Magical Quest game. The object of the game is to rescue them from the clutches of the villainous King Pete.\n\nMickey's Racing Adventure\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie run a print shop in Mickey's Hometown, where you can have pictures in the game printed out on a Game Boy Printer if you have one. They have locked themselves in the shop and Chip and Dale has the key to the door needed to unlock it, which they will only give to you if you give them nine nuts to trade.\n\nMickey's Speedway USA\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie all appear in the game. Huey presents the winner with their trophy and reminds the racer that is going the wrong way when they are going the wrong way, while Dewey continues a player after they fall into the water or down a pit and Louie starts the race by saying: \"On your mark, Get Set, GO!!!\", plus they appear as unlockable characters.\n\nDonald Duck: Goin' Quackers!\n\nIn Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers!, if Donald manages to spell out the word \"Special\" in each level, the nephews will contact him after he finishes it to tell him how to activate a new special move.\n\nKingdom Hearts series\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie appear as supporting characters in the Kingdom Hearts series.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts, they open up an item shop in Traverse Town, which sells recovery items along with weapons for Goofy and Donald, but are seen returning to Disney Castle in the end credits. Whenever they are visited in Traverse Town, they rotate who is on the counter to offer services while the other two stand on the floor to offer various non-important info.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts II, they run their own individual shops again, this time in Hollow Bastion as they rebuild following the events from the first game. They again return to Disney Castle during the end credits, now joined by their Uncle Scrooge, Uncle Donald, Goofy, Pluto, and King Mickey Mouse.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, the trio appears in Disney Town participating in the world's mini-games. Scrooge McDuck has left them in charge of an ice cream machine, which they are having trouble handling. Captain Justice comes to lend them a hand but only ends up making a big mess. When Pete fails to get the machine to properly work, Ventus arrives and asks if he could try getting it to work. With his help, they manage to make it work properly.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts coded, data representations of them appear within Jiminy's Journal.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts χ, the triplets appear as medals with their design from the Kingdom Hearts series. A variant of their medals features the triplets with their designs from the DuckTales reboot.\n\nDisney Magical World\n\nHere, Huey, Dewey, and Louie work for Scrooge in Castleton's finest shop, introduced to the player through Minnie. For Huey, fashion's his specialty, Dewey's in charge of furnishing, and Louie takes care of the rest.\n\nDisney Heroes: Battle Mode\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie are playable characters in Disney Heroes: Battle Mode. They are Control Role Heroes. The triplets are using their slighshots to throw rocks at enemies with their basic attacks, while in other skills they are using skateboard to drive around battlefield to leave behind them bear traps which damage and debuff enemies. Dematerializer is used by them in White Skill to move furthermost enemy to front and also damaging them and applying stun for a duration.\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie's friendship campaigns are with Joy and Donald Duck. Their other friendship campaigns are with Scrooge McDuck, Simba & Nala, Russell & Kevin, and Luca Paguro & Alberto Scorfano.\n\nWhile their design is based on DuckTales, their dialogues and characteristics are based on the reboot DuckTales (2017 series).\n\nDisney Parks\n\nIn spite of being major characters in the Donald Duck cartoons and comics, Huey, Dewey, and Louie rarely make live appearances at the Disney theme parks. However, in recent years, they've been making far more appearances, specifically during special events.\n\nThe park versions of the characters were notably featured in the Sing-Along Songs videos The Twelve Days of Christmas, Campout at Walt Disney World and Happy Haunting: Party at Disneyland.\n\nThey also appear in Disney's Magical Express' bus videos, viewed during transportation.\n\nDisneyland\n\nIn Disneyland, the boys can be seen with their DuckTales 2017 reboot designs at Donald's Duck Pond, formerly Donald's Boat, which opened in 2023 as part of the reimagining of Mickey's Toontown.\n\nWalt Disney World\n\nIn Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom, the trio has their own spell card called \"Huey, Dewey, & Louie's Snowfort Barricade\". This card was only available to guests that attended Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party in 2013. Statues of the boys are also featured in one of the courtyards of Disney's All-Star Sports Resort.\n\nIn the past, the boys appeared as animatronics in Mickey Mouse Revue at the Magic Kingdom.\n\nTokyo Disney Resort\n\nIn Japan, Huey, Dewey, and Louie make occasional appearances in select parades, most notably during the holidays. In Tokyo Disneyland, the boys are prominently featured in the Duck Family Chocolate Competition confection shop. Their names also appear on Toontown's only major eatery, known as Huey, Dewey, and Louie's Good Time Café.\n\nDisneyland Paris\n\nIn France, the boys appeared in the former Disney's Fantillusion parade, as well as Twelve Days of Christmas in Disneyland Paris park.\n\nDisney Cruise Line\n\nOn the Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy cruise ships, Huey, Dewey, and Louie are the hosts of The AquaLab. The AquaLab is an interactive water playground for children and the sister activity to the popular AquaDuck, which the boys created as a gift for Donald.\n\nA statue depicting Huey cutting the support line of Donald (while working on the ship's paint job) is featured on the Disney Wonder ship.\n\nPhooey, the Fourth Nephew\n\nA few comics feature a fourth nephew brought about accidentally through artistic error. He is often jokingly dubbed as Fooey or Phooey, the nephews' \"long-lost brother\". Later, Phooey Duck was purposely written into the Danish comic Much Ado About Phooey by Lars Jensen who established Phooey as a scientific phenomenon who sporadically popped in and out of existence in proximity to his siblings.\n\nIn the 2017 reboot of DuckTales, Phooey is mentioned as an in-joke in the episode \"What Ever Happened to Donald Duck?!\" when Dewey mistakes a mustard stain on a childhood photo of himself and his siblings as eggs, as an extra egg that magically disappeared mid snap. He finally makes a physical appearance in \"A Nightmare on Killmotor Hill!\", but as a dream construct created by the triplets. Understandably, he is depicted as looking like them, but with his own hairstyle and adorned in yellow.\n\nFilmography\n\nGallery\n\nTrivia\n\nTypical of cartoon characters, Huey, Dewey, and Louie rarely appear to age (note Quack Pack), even where the story they're involved in shows characters around them to age like Max Goof (though they appeared alongside him in House of Mouse at older ages) or Sora from the Kingdom Hearts series.\n\nThe triplets were intended to appear as a combined character with Scrooge in the canceled Epic Disney Racers.\n\nIn the opening of the Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color episode \"Disneyland Goes to the World's Fair\", Walt Disney is seen standing around three Audio-Animatronic brontosauruses (presumably for the Magic Skyway attraction) that he has named Huey, Dewey, and Louie.\n\nIn \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\", Huey, Dewey and Louie are revealed to have been born April 15, 20--, as a nod to when the characters debuted. If the episode took place on August 4, 2018 (the day the episode aired) that would place the triplets' age most likely between 10-12.\n\nReferences\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie at INDUCKS\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie on Wikipedia\n\nMedia Short Films: Mickey Mouse series • Donald Duck series • Goofy series • Pluto series • Chip and Dale series\n\nFeature Length Films: Fantasia • Saludos Amigos • The Three Caballeros • Fun and Fancy Free • Melody Time • DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp • Disney's The Twelve Days of Christmas • A Goofy Movie • Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas • Fantasia 2000 • An Extremely Goofy Movie • Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse • Mickey's House of Villains • Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers • Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas • Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\n\nTelevision: Mickey Mouse Club • The Wonderful World of Disney • DuckTales • Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers • Darkwing Duck • Goof Troop • Quack Pack • Mickey's Fun Songs • Mickey Mouse Works • House of Mouse • Mickey Mouse Clubhouse • Minnie's Bow-Toons • Mickey Mouse • DuckTales • Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures • Legend of the Three Caballeros • Mickey Go Local • The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse • Mickey Mouse Funhouse • Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life • Mickey Mouse Clubhouse 2.0\n\nDisney Parks Mickey's Toontown • Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway • PLAY!\n\nEntertainment: Disney Adventure Friends Cavalcade • Stitch's Interplanetary Beach Party Blast • It’s Very Minnie! • Minnie's Tiara of Dreams • Minnie, We Love You! • Club Mouse Beat • Mickey and Friends: An Extra Big Adventure • Minnie @ Funderland • Quacky Celebration ★ Donald the Legend!\n\nSpring: Disney's Easter Wonderland • Hippity Hoppity Springtime • Usatama on the Run!\n\nSummer: Summer Blast • Disney's Summer Oasis Splash • Mickey's WaterWorks\n\nHalloween: Re-Villains!
