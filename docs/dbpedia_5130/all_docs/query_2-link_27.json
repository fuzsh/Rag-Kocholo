It put $15 million into unlisted webtoon producer Kenaz this year, becoming its largest shareholder.\n\n\"Right now there are great opportunities in the webtoon market,” Park Ji-hong, the firm’s chief executive, said in an interview in Seoul. \"Although there are not many listed companies to invest in, we are focusing on nonlisted companies with attractive valuations.”"
