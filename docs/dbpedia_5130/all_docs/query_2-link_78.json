        "text": "Global Webtoons Market Outlook\n\nThe global webtoons market size reached approximately USD 5.55 billion in 2023. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18.6% between 2024 and 2032, reaching a value of around USD 25.82 billion by 2032.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn March 2022, Naver attracted nearly 180 million monthly active global users, a 291% increase from 46 million in May 2017.\n\nAs of Q2 2022, Webtoon Entertainment boasted 85.6 million monthly active users in over 100 countries.\n\nEfforts to translate and culturally adapt content have made webtoons accessible and appealing to a global audience.\n\nWebtoons are webcomics or graphic novels that are published online and can be read on smartphones, tablets, computers, and televisions. These digital comics, originated in South Korea, contain different genres and themes to appeal to diverse readers. The rise of smartphones and tablets contributed significantly to their popularity, as the format is well-suited to the vertical, scroll-down interface of these devices.\n\nThe global shift towards digital media consumption is one of the major factors boosting the webtoons market growth. With the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and high-speed internet, digital content, including webtoons, has become easily accessible to a wide audience.\n\nThere is a growing preference, especially among younger generations, for on-demand and mobile-friendly content. Webtoons cater to this trend by providing entertainment that is not only easily accessible but also engaging and interactive. Webtoons cover a wide range of genres and themes, appealing to various demographics and interests and the platform also allows for a diversity of voices, with creators from different backgrounds sharing their stories.\n\nKey Trends and Developments\n\nExpansion of webtoons globally; cost-effective price of drawing instruments; rising adaptation of webtoons in movies and shows; and integration of monetisation models are the major trends impacting the webtoons market growth\n\nDate Event Jan 23rd, 2024 Studio Bones ventured into the webtoon space with a new adaptation of \"Metallic Rogue\" Jan 23rd, 2024 Penguin Random House entered into a distribution agreement with Wattpad Webtoon Jan 24th, 2024 Webtoon announced the expansion of its digital library by adapting 14 popular web novels from Aethon Books into webcomics Jan 29th, 2024 The South Korean government laid out an ambitious plan to boost the webtoon business and foster its development\n\nTopic Details Expansion of webtoons on a global scale The popularity of webtoons is spreading from East Asia to South Asia, North America, and Europe, among others, due to their easy accessibility on digital platforms. Cost-effective price of drawing instruments and screens Reduced costs of sketching pens and screens have made it easier for new creators to invest in quality tools and enter the webtoon business. Rising adaptation of webtoons in movies and television shows Growing adaptation of webtoons in movies and television shows increases their exposure by introducing them to a wide range of audiences and attracting new readers. Integration of monetisation models in webtoon platforms Key players are experimenting with various monetisation strategies beyond the traditional ad-based model, which includes premium models, where readers pay for early access to episodes.\n\nWebtoons Market Trends\n\nOne of the prominent trends aiding the market expansion is the growing popularity of webtoons, which originated in East Asia, notably South Korea, and is spreading globally, including to regions like South Asia, North America, and Europe. The widespread availability of smartphones and high-speed internet has made it easy for audiences worldwide to access digital content, aiding the webtoons market growth.\n\nDigital platforms have broken down the traditional barriers of content distribution as webtoons can be instantly published and made accessible to a global audience, unlike physical comics which require printing and distribution.\n\nStudio Bones, a name synonymous with high-quality animation and storytelling, is broadening its horizon by stepping into the webtoon domain with the adaptation of \"Metallic Rogue\". \"Metallic Rogue\", a sci-fi series, is set to leverage Studio Bones' expertise in animation and storytelling to offer an immersive and visually engaging experience to webtoon readers.
