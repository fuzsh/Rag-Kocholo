        "text": "#20: “Too Beautiful to Lie” (2004)\n\nAn ex-con con artist has just missed her train to help a pharmacist retrieve a stolen ring he planned to propose with. She must now use her skills to crash with this stranger's family as his fake fiancée, inevitably causing trouble and finding the love she never believed in. \"Too Beautiful to Lie\" sounds like a typical \"meet the family\" farce with a criminal twist. But it delivers uniquely elaborate twists and a clever perspective on how society inherently trusts attractive people. Our antihero turns out to have some comedic and emotional layers, played by Kim Ha-neul in Baeksang award-winning form. \"Too Beautiful to Lie\" still has delightful absurdity and warmth to spare, but with deceptively deeper ideas.\n\n#19: “Nothing Serious” (2021)\n\nWhat happens when a lonely romance columnist and a career woman become friends with benefits over a dating app? Well, you can probably guess. Sure, “Nothing Serious” essentially lives up to its name. At least it spices up its zany humor with themes that are typically scandalous for a K-comedy. On top of a tasteful use of this edge, the distinctly millennial love story is less about the cheap rom-com standards for love than about two cynics scrutinizing them for something deeper. With help from rising superstar Jeon Jong-seo’s promotion on TikTok, “Nothing Serious” became a commercial hit with young audiences. With a Baeksang award for Best Screenplay, it was an all-around critical hit across generations.\n\n#18: \"Salut d'Amour\" (2015)\n\nVeteran actor Park Geun-hyung plays the quintessential grump who refuses to sell to land developers. His fight will require the help of friends, family, and the special friend who just moved next door. \"Salut d'Amour\" is an ideal blend of community crowd-pleaser and senior romance. Both angles are formulaic, but uplifting for their poignant sense of the characters. Never mind the sweet sense of humor in trying to find love late in life. This is just the most prominent of the many funny and moving relationships that make up a tight-knit community in peril. As wholesome as it is heartfelt, \"Salut d'Amour\" is a winning romantic dramedy for more mature audiences of any age.\n\n#17: \"On Your Wedding Day\" (2018)\n\nA wedding tends to be the perfect close for a romantic comedy. That's not the case for Woo-yeon, who reflects on hilarity and heartbreak with his high school sweetheart… when he's invited to her wedding. \"On Your Wedding Day\" gives audiences fair warning that its love story will not have a happy Hollywood ending. It's too mature for that in how it depicts the maturing of first love. Not so much in the hijinks and sentiments in that process. This wide range of emotions captivated viewers and showed off the range in the lead actors' acclaimed performances. \"On Your Wedding Day\" may not always be easy on the heart, but it's sure to have a special place there.\n\n#16: “Scandal Makers” (2008)\n\nRom-com darling Cha Tae-hyun plays a former teen idol-turned-radio personality… turned grandfather? When he meets the daughter and grandson he never knew he had, it’s time to finally grow up. A love interest in the boy’s kindergarten teacher is important in this process. Of course, the real love story in “Scandal Makers” is between an immature star and the family that brings him down to earth. Everything else, including the romance, is a part of his personal journey. The movie’s own adorable, heartwarming journey was a huge hit at the box office and an unexpected critical success. It even inspired a few international remakes. But the public still can’t get enough of the original “Scandal Makers.”\n\n#15: \"My Wife Is a Gangster\" (2001)\n\nRomantic comedies and gangster movies have had a storied marriage. But of course, men have traditionally been expected to lead the action. Megastar Shin Eun-kyung shifted that dynamic as a mob boss who fulfills her sister's dying wish that she get married. Just when she thinks she's out, rival gangsters pull her and her husband back in. It's a tricky mix of genres, but from heartwarming romance to darkly comic crime thrills, \"My Wife Is a Gangster\" has it all. The movie was such a ready-made hit that it inspired two sequels. For all of its ups and downs, \"My Wife Is a Gangster\" remains a cult classic to match romance and action fans.\n\n#14: \"Sweet & Sour\" (2021)\n\nAn engineer may have hit a fork in his future when he lands a job in Seoul, while his nurse girlfriend stays in Incheon. A couple’s efforts to stay together through hard work and distance is treated like a lively farce, with a bitter aftertaste. True to its title, the Netflix Original \"Sweet & Sour\" is a flavorful balance between quirky K-comedy and a more mature love story. Some critics felt that the movie could have been more savory in its drama. Still, the themes of work fatigue and long-distance relationships really struck a chord with audiences at the height of COVID. Even afterward, “Sweet & Sour” remains a treat for fans of rom-coms with a kick.\n\n#13: \"100 Days with Mr. Arrogant\" (2004)\n\nAfter damaging a wealthy playboy's car in a heartbroken tantrum, a poor student has to become his servant for 100 days to cover the repairs. This premise was part of an early 2000s trend of K-comedies inspired by popular fiction on the internet. \"100 Days with Mr. Arrogant\" was clearly not out to rewrite the rom-com playbook… or blog post. But it nails that formula with unique hilarity and heart to win over its audience. Ha Ji-won and Kim Jaewon's inter-class courtship became an instant cult sensation while helping to cement the actors as strong romantic leads. Though \"Mr. Arrogant\" airs on the humble side of its genre, it manages to be a fan favorite.\n\n#12: “Whatcha Wearin’?” (2012)\n\nPop idol Kim Ah-joong shows off a more seductive vocal range in “Whatcha Wearin’?”. When Yoon-jung attempts to revitalize her relationship with phone sex, a wrong number leads to her possibly meeting her Mr. Right. Needless to say, this movie has a bit more mature content than the average K-comedy. That doesn’t just mean that the humor is as raunchy as it is funny. The silly story of coincidence truly earns its heart on intimate conversation in every sense of the term. Kim and Ji Sung’s chemistry makes the humor and heart all the more grown up. Even with an edgier rating “Whatcha Wearin’?” really spoke to general audiences as an unlikely box office and critical winner.\n\n#11: “My Tutor Friend” (2003)\n\nKim Ha-neul may have broken out through a comedy, but she didn’t completely break out of drama. “My Tutor Friend” follows a college student who helps her struggling family by tutoring an educationally challenged high schooler of rich stock. As an unlikely friendship blooms into something more, the movie tackles some complex themes of education and class. Of course, it always does so with a lot of laughs. The refreshingly grounded rom-com was inspired by a true story and was such a hit that it inspired a standalone sequel. It’s safe to say that for a classic romance that teaches the audience a lesson, “My Tutor Friend” is worth the investment.\n\n#10: \"The Beauty Inside\" (2015)\n\nHollywood's innovatively interactive web series hit the big screen in South Korea. A star-studded cast plays Yi-soo, a furniture designer who changes bodies every time he wakes up. No matter the age or gender of his host, he can always count on his crush to be his true north. Along the way, Yi-soo gains a perspective on the human experience that was overlooked for gimmick in the original \"The Beauty Inside.\" What this remake lacks in interactivity is made up for in comedic and emotional connection with the audience. 2015's \"The Beauty Inside\" became its own hit, inspiring a popular show on TV instead of Facebook. No matter how much this story changes, the heart remains the same.\n\n#9: \"I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK\" (2006)\n\nPark Chan-wook made his name on some of the most influential and idiosyncratic dramas in Korean cinema. He couldn't just make your typically quirky rom-com. It had to be the love story of a girl who thinks she's a cyborg and a boy with schizophrenia. Meanwhile, other patients at the psychiatric hospital try to get by with their delusions and an overwhelmed staff. Park's farce is obviously divisive in its cluttered story and darkly bizarre humor. But his bold filmmaking confronts audiences with the humanity of the oddest among us. It helps that the central romance is strangely so heartwarming. \"I'm a Cyborg, But That's Okay\" may not be the most commercial of rom-coms. But with its unique engineering and humane directive, that's okay.\n\n#8: \"Penny Pinchers\" (2011)\n\nJust when it seems that Ji-woong's mooching days are done, his obsessively frugal neighbor is in need of a partner for her savings account. The two must now team up to teach each other how to scrimp and scheme until they discover something more valuable than money. Clearly, \"Penny Pinchers\" breaks the South Korean consumerist image with the glossiest of movie genres. It spares no expense in showing the riotous chaos of how to financially get by in modern society. Still, its economical rom-com beats endear you to the lovably sleazy leads. On top of breaking out Song Joong-ki as a bankable leading man, \"Penny Pinchers\" is just a wealth of thrifty but extravagant fun.\n\n#7: “Windstruck” (2004)\n\nThe director and the star of “My Sassy Girl” really struck again with “Windstruck,” going beyond the market of a strict romantic comedy. Jun Ji-hyun juggles action-packed police work and a heartwarming love story with Jang Hyuk as a heroic schoolteacher. With tragedy kicking off the second half, both storylines have to be resolved with a supernatural twist. The movie is clearly ambitious in its genre-bending, despite the obvious parallels with the Hollywood classic “Ghost.” But with that same level of fantastical passion comes a lot more charming humor and thrills. There are also some nods to “My Sassy Girl” to further lift viewers’ spirits. Of course, “Windstruck” stands on its own as an enchanting emotional ride for romance fans.\n\n#6: “Love 911” (2012)\n\nA firefighter's personal life starts to heat up when he's asked by a cold-blooded doctor to testify on her behalf in a malpractice suit. With the character witness still grieving the death of his wife, he finds a chance at redemption and love in getting the defendant to truly appreciate her work. \"Love 911\"'s romance between two broken people is handled with refreshing warmth. This drew a Baeksang nomination for actress Han Hyo-joo, and a strong reception for the movie. With humor, heart, and action, \"Love 911\" just has it all. Tourists should just keep in mind that, contrary to the movie's English title, South Korea's fire and rescue line is 119.\n\n#5: \"Spellbound\" (2011)\n\nStreet magician Jo-goo becomes a headliner with a spooky act featuring Yeo-ri. What's the trick? Yeo-ri can actually see ghosts! And one spirit that's particularly close to her is out for revenge. Rom-com screenwriter Hwang In-ho's bold directing debut promises to be a lively supernatural romp. Sure enough, its comedy and horror are a real scream. But the movie's subtext about trauma and lifting lonely souls is a surprisingly poignant anchor for the romance. This range earned the versatile Son Ye-jin one of her many Baeksang nominations for Best Actress. It also makes \"Spellbound\" spellbinding for rom-com, horror, and drama fans, with a 2023 remake in the Philippines.\n\n#4: \"Castaway on the Moon\" (2009)\n\nAfter Kim Seong-geun's troubles drive him into the Han River, he finally finds freedom from civilization on a remote island. It turns out to not be too remote when he begins communicating with a reclusive shutterbug from afar. At least she's better company than a volleyball. \"Castaway on the Moon\" still delivers great humor in its divisive premise. More importantly, it delivers an expressive adventure into the power of connection to make the outside world worth the grind. This dramedy's audacious concept and style didn't attract a significant audience. It did, however, win massive acclaim and major awards. In bringing high art to high rom-com entertainment, \"Castaway on the Moon\" has become a beloved cult classic.\n\n#3: \"My Little Bride\" (2004)\n\nAt only 15 years old, Bo-eun is forced to marry a college man because of a pact between their grandfathers. Her efforts to continue being a normal high schooler with an age-appropriate romance hits a wall when her husband becomes her new art teacher. Needless to say, the concept of the Hong Kong comedy \"My Wife Is 18\" is even weirder when it's revised for a younger demographic. Despite the obvious controversy, \"My Little Bride\" won over a huge audience with its irreverent humor and gutsy character development. Even the critics gave high praise and prizes to the breakout stars. Since then, \"My Little Bride\" has gone the distance as one of the most popular rom-coms in South Korea.\n\n#2: “200 Pounds Beauty” (2006)\n\nSinger and model Kim Ah-joong made a bold film debut under a lot of prosthetics. The golden-voiced Hanna Kang achieves her wildest dreams after undergoing plastic surgery to become gorgeous pop idol Jenny. While trying to conceal the truth about her ideal image, Hanna finds her true voice through an old friend. “200 Pounds Beauty” presents itself as a vocal criticism of South Korea’s pop and plastic surgery culture. It ironically does so with glamor and broad comedy to amass a major commercial following. But with its uplifting themes and Kim’s breakout performance, the movie was also a hit on the award circuit. As clever as it is catchy, “200 Pounds Beauty” hits all the right notes for a rom-com classic.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions..\n\n“Hot Young Bloods” (2014)\n\nAll Generations Identified with Teen Culture in the Last Days of School Uniforms\n\n“Seducing Mr. Perfect” (2006)\n\nA Corporate Broker Changes His Outlook with Help From His New Assistant\n\n“Love and Leashes” (2022)\n\nAudiences Submitted to This Kinky Yet Heartwarming Romance\n\n“Mood of the Day” (2016)\n\nA Sports Manager & an Ad Agent Do Romantic Business While Lost in Busan\n\n“A Year-End Medley” (2021)\n\nA Star-Studded Ensemble of Moving Love Stories Ring in the New Year\n\n#1: “My Sassy Girl” (2001)\n\nIt doesn’t sound like there’s much romance in the epic story of an engineering student falling in love with an unnamed girl over gruel games. Certainly, there is a lot of hilarious silliness to spare. But “My Sassy Girl”’s genre-defying sense of its characters and the messiness of relationships was almost unheard of for a commercial K-comedy. The movie was met with massive international acclaim and box office success. This success didn’t just inspire a sequel, TV shows, and remakes around the world. It is widely considered a watershed moment for Korean movies as a global phenomenon. The movie’s impact on the industry and pop culture is almost indescribable. But in the pantheon of K-rom-coms, “My Sassy Girl” is still irresistible."
