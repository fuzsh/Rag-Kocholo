With the advent of smartphones and tablets, a larger audience is gaining access to comic books through various apps and websites. This digital transition is making comic books more accessible to a global audience while catering to the preferences of younger generations who are more inclined toward digital media.

Popular franchises like Marvel and DC Comics have seen their characters and stories brought to life on the big screen and television, leading to an increase in popularity and demand for original comic books. These adaptations often create a renewed interest in classic characters and storylines, attracting a new audience to comic books. The cross-promotion between films, TV series, and comic books effectively boosts sales and visibility for comic book publishers.

This symbiotic relationship between the film/TV industry and comic books plays a pivotal role in the expansion and sustainability of the comic book market.\n\nNostalgia and Collector's Demand\n\nPresently, the comic book market is witnessing significant growth owing to a strong sense of nostalgia and the high demand from collectors.
