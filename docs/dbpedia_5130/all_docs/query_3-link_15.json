        "text": "Although the film is a handsome and very watchable adaptation, retaining its brilliant twists, it doesn’t quite capture the book’s ruthless efficiency.\n\n9. 200 Pounds Beauty (2006)\n\nAdapted from the manga Kanna’s Big Success!, the romantic comedy 200 Pounds Beauty was one of the surprise successes of 2006. It delighted viewers with its colourful staging and a concept that would be difficult to bring to the screen today.\n\nKim Ah-joong made her mark as Jenny, an overweight ghost singer who contemplates suicide – only to undergo extensive plastic surgery and embark on a K-pop career.\n\n8. Luck-Key (2016)\n\nThe sleeper hit Luck-Key is a hugely entertaining body-swap action comedy based on the film Key of Life.\n\nLee Joon, formerly of the K-pop outfit MBLAQ, plays Jae-sung, a struggling actor who deliberately switches identities with Hyung-wook, a rich-looking man who has just lost his memory in a sauna after slipping on a bar of soap.\n\n7. Be With You (2018)\n\nFanciful though it is, she somehow keeps her promise, returning to her husband and son during the rainy season a year after dying. However, she does so without any of her memories. Not only that, she must also leave when the rainy season ends.\n\n6. Broken (2014)\n\nAuthor Keigo Higashino makes the list again, through Broken, an adaptation of his novel The Hovering Blade.\n\nThis gruelling revenge drama features Jung Jae-young (who also features twice on this list) as an ordinary father whose quiet life is shattered following the rape and murder of his daughter.\n\nFrustrated by the slow progress of the official police investigation, the man takes matters into his own hands and decides to hunt down the perpetrators himself.\n\n5. Little Forest (2018)\n\nBased on the Daisuke Igarashi manga of the same name, which was previously shot as a two-part film, Little Forest is a mood-lifting and calming adaptation directed by Yim Soon-rye.\n\nLiving in the humble cottage her mother left her, Kim’s protagonist tends to the garden, eating only home-made food, and rebuilds her confidence as well as her childhood relationships.\n\n4. Josée (2020)\n\nDespite her stand-offish attitude, the man takes an interest in the woman and begins to learn about the unique world she has made for herself in the humble home where she lives with her grandmother.\n\nArt-house director Kim Jong-kwang brings a lyrical touch to the story, which is gorgeously filmed and designed, and wonderfully performed.\n\n3. Going by the Book (2007)\n\nA remake of the 1991 film Bang!, Going by the Book is the uproarious tale of a strait-laced police officer who takes his role as the robber in a bank robbery simulation very, very seriously.\n\nA saturnine Jung Jae-young has rarely been funnier as the fake bank robber who outwits his arrogant colleagues at every turn during a police simulation in the countryside, which begins to gain national attention and bring shame to the police force.\n\nThe film is directed by Ra Hee-chan and written and produced by master comedian Jang Jin, who embellishes the terrific concept with his dry wit.\n\n2. Helpless (2012)\n\nThe frantic man does everything he can to track her down, but the more he looks, the more he realises he had no idea what kind of person he was about to marry.\n\nIn this wonderfully twisty psychological mystery, a missing person’s case morphs into a deranged and unpredictable criminal case.\n\n1. Oldboy (2003)\n\nIn an iconic performance, Choi Min-sik plays Oh Dae-su, a salary worker kidnapped on the street during a rainy night and imprisoned for reasons unknown. After 15 years of slowly going mad he is released, and given five days to figure out who put him there and why."
