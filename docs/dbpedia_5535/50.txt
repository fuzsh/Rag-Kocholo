Abstract

The paper is concerned with the study of the French historical revolution: the Annales School and the New History. The Annales School is the innovatory trend which had an important influence upon the historiography of the 20th century. Annales approach rejected the predominant emphasis on political history by positivism of the 19th century historians. Their ideal was the “total history” which implied to reflect thoroughly the historical reality. Marc Bloch died during the Second World War and Lucien Febvre continued to carry on the Annales approach. In 1947 was founded by him the 6th section of the École pratique des hautes études. The second era of Annales’ historiography is connected with the name of Fernand Braudel who pioneered la longue durée, an approach forstudying long-term structures over historical events. Since 1960s the history of mentalities getting characteristic for the Annales School. Attitudes toward death, childhood, love, sexuality etc. had become prevailed in the works of Ph. Ariès, M. Vovelle, J. Le Goff, E. Le Roy Ladurie. The book « Montaillou, village Occitan de 1294 à 1324 »had been published in 1975. The work is based on the unique source – notes of the Inquisition active in 1318-1325 in the village of Montaillou against Cathar heresy. It is shown in the paper how E. Ladurie managed to offer a picture of both the material and mental worlds of the villagers. The Georgian translation of the chapter “Death in Montaillou” with a commentary, is appended to the article.
