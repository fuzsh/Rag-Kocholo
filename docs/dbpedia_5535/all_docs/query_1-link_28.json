The works of David Levine are in black and white and those of John Springs, Pancho, James Ferguson, and Siegfried Woldhek are in color.\n\nAt this time, we are only able to sell prints by David Levine. Each print has an approximate image size of 7″ x 9-½″ and is printed on heavy white archival paper with an off-white acid-free archival mat (with a 9″ x 11.5″ opening). A matte black wood-composite glass frame is 13-½″ x 17-¾″ x 1-⅝″. The black front border of the frame is 1″ wide.\n\nUse the search and browse functions to view the the drawings by date or subject, and click on the thumbnails provided for a larger image and ordering information.
