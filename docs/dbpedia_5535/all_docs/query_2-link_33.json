        "text": "2\n\nNoble Landholders\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHY OF NOBLES IN FRANCE\n\nJust as the distribution of nobles as a percentage of the European population varied widely from country to country during the Old Regime, so it did within France.1 A brilliantly innovative study of eighteenth-century Brittany contrasted a penurious but pullulating petty nobility on the north coast of the peninsula with the wealthier, titled families around Nantes.2 The eastern marches of France, Alsace and Lorraine, counted a smaller noble component of their populations than in the south; for example, Provence, Languedoc, or Gascony with its proverbial swarms of erstwhile d’Artagnans. Evidence of this uneven geographical presence of nobles in Old Regime France is varied but persuasive, and during the nineteenth century this regional contrast remained. Of course, within smaller provinces, or pays, there were also variations in the number of nobles compared with the local populations.3 In Provence, where individuals from the Bouches-du-Rhône and Var departments took more than half of the titles awarded between 1800 and 1870, the Hautes-Alpes and Basses-Alpes represented no more than 10 percent each.4 Thus the former departments were overrepresented among new nobles proportionate to their population, and the latter, underrepresented. To complicate matters still further, one might point out that some regimes preferred provençaux nobles more than others (see table 2). This makes plain the uneven pace of creation of nineteenth-century nobles and thus warns us against geographical determinism over time.\n\nThe implications of this distribution of nobles in France, especially their tendency to cluster on the richest lands, those with the highest value yield per hectare as given in the agricultural statistics collected in 1836, are examined in more detail below. A detailed departmental map based on the declared “political domicile” of male voters of the requisite age and tax payments during the late 1830s has been drawn by Thomas Beck,5 but we are less well served for the periods twenty years before and twenty years after his compilations. From samples of birthplaces recorded in vicomte Révérend’s genealogies, the almost three hundred individuals who established majorats sur demande between 1814 and 1830, and over two thousand entries from a directory of nobles published in 1866 a strikingly consistent picture of regional distribution emerges (see table 3). Based on major geographical contrasts superimposed on departments, those regions do not, of course, chart the geographical variety of French pays. There are no universally accepted criteria for contrasting the different parts of France, although individual writers on agriculture have advanced their own schemes. In 1844 Lullin de Chateauvieux proposed a map of eight agricultural regions: (1) North, (2) Northeast, (3) Southeast or the Alps, (4) South or the olive trees, (5) Center or the mountains, (6) Southwest or the Pyrenees, (7) West, and (8) Northwest or heaths and gorse. This was a rather unequal mixture of points on the compass, natural features, and vegetation.6 A century later a French geographer enumerated more than 425 agricultural regions.7 Despite this diversity, any geographical study of nobles in France after the Revolution shows that they were not to be found everywhere in the same proportions in the population.\n\nBesides showing the persistence of regional proportions, table 3 indicates a slight decline in the number of nobles in eastern France, the most economically innovative area of the nation in embracing the new industrialism of the nineteenth century. Brittany changed hardly at all, but the southwest seemed to provide a home for increasing numbers of nobles. However, these changes on the peripheries of France merely underscore that the noble heartland of the nineteenth century was the Paris region with the rich farmlands to the northwest. At a time when the absolute number of nobles in France was in decline (as pointed out in chapter 1), their concentration waxed in Paris and the northern lowlands. Much evidence from almanacs and directories points to the growing preference of nineteenth-century nobles for the northwest of the country. If the birthplaces of individuals who set up majorats sur demande under the Bourbon Restoration are compared with those of the Second Empire titled, a rise in the proportion of those born in the capital is apparent. Paris and its immediate region—Seine, Seine-et-Marne, and Seine-et-Oise—predominate. Despite the advance in titrés from the southwest and the Massif Central during the Second Empire, the south of France overall, with its plethora of relatively impoverished noblesse, shrank in its representation among the new titles awarded. Under the Bourbons 26.8 percent of titrés were born in the southern region at a time when 37.9 percent of the French population lived there, but under the Second Empire this dropped to 23 percent of the titrés when the south still contained more than a third of the French population. If Paris supplanted Versailles as the central stage of noble life, this was (in geographical terms) merely a small adjustment, since the two centers were separated by less than thirty kilometers. Figure 1 shows the location of the entailed estates of candidates for hereditary titles under the Bourbons—a map that is arguably an indicator of where the most successful nineteenth-century nobles lived.\n\nNOBLE URBAN LIFE\n\nAnother, less sweeping way of looking at the distribution of nobles in nineteenth-century France is to consider those towns and cities that under the Old Regime were fountains of nobility, that is, places where courts or the municipality offered to those who staffed them access, under specific conditions of tenure, to the second estate. In 1800 many nobles still had property and an attachment to the towns where, over two or three generations, their families underwent the transformation from roturiers into accepted nobles. A quarter-century after the parlement’s abolition and that of venality of office in Aix-en-Provence, Rennes, Grenoble, Dijon, Besançon, Douai, and other administrative centers, numerous nobles lived close to the site of the source of their family’s distinction. When Napoleon ordered a particular effort to recruit members of parlementaire families back into the judiciary at the 1811 reorganization of the regional appeal court, those robe families who remained loyal to their localities felt, justifiably, that their hour had returned. This was particularly true in a backwater like Pau, where the family names of the eighteenth-century parlement constituted a fifth of the mid-nineteenth-century regional appeal court.8\n\nSmall towns or big cities sometimes boasted a distinct noble district, although its location changed at the behest of taste and fashion. Restoration Toulouse had a “rue des nobles.” One scholar noted that in nineteenth-century Bordeaux the townhouses of the great landed nobility, families such as the Lur-Saluces, the Carayon-Latours, and the Myre-Morys, were concentrated around the former archepiscopal palace, but they were gradually given up during the course of the century.9 In the nineteenth century there was also a blurring of the often remarked preferences under the Empire and the Restoration of the Parisian aristocracy to live in the Saint-Germain district (especially the rues de Lille, de l’Université, de Grenelle, Saint Dominique, and so on), while the titrés and more recent nobles of the Empire settled for the right bank. In fact, large estates and smart addresses in Paris united the aristocracy and the titrés while deepening the gulf between them and the provincial noblesse. Some towns attracted nobles because nobles had always been drawn to them. Of nowhere was that more true than the quartier Saint Louis of Versailles, where lived “the old Legitimists of that last stronghold of French aristocracy deeming an error in pedigree a sin which no amount of penitential contrition can obliterate.” The same journalist noted that it was to Versailles that the families of the noble faubourg of Paris made their escape during the panic over the cholera outbreak in October 1865.10\n\nWith its echoes of the Old Regime, Versailles held an understandable attraction for nobles, but the draw of other places was less evident. For instance, in 1819 the Norman town of Bayeux boasted eleven nobles on the urban electoral list, while nearby Honfleur, with approximately the same population of ten thousand, possessed only one noble family.11 Chartres, Arles, Sens, and Pamiers had a similar allure for nobles, while nearby centers did not. This was either because they provided cheaper living than commercial towns or because nobles within their walls were not jostled, figuratively speaking, by an aggressive commercial group. In nineteenth-century Rouen, for example, the old parlementaires and their descendants increasingly lost their eminence in local society to business and manufacturing families. In Rennes, on the other hand, the nobility remained at the peak of local society; baron Régis de Trobriand wrote ironically of the “brilliant and select society” of nobles who set the tone of social life and were in a position of prestige.12\n\nSome towns gained a seasonal popularity in the nineteenth century that had no connections with the life of the Old Regime. From the 1820s Dieppe became fashionable as a temporary residence in summer thanks to repeated visits by the young duchesse de Berry. Deauville and Dinard became the beau monde’s refuge from the Parisian summer during the 1840s. Biarritz owed its prosperity in the 1860s to the empress Eugénie’s fondness for a resort on the road to Spain.\n\nAs mentioned above, the noble district of nineteenth-century Bordeaux shrank in size, not only because of the demographic decline pointed to in chapter 1. Investigations into the movements of noble families suggest that impoverished former residents of large townhouses in Amiens, Rouen, and similar regional capitals sometimes relocated to Paris, or else they moved to cheaper lodgings in the smaller cities.13\n\nSave through family letters and account books, it is difficult to find reliable information on the changing location of the principal residence of nobles. Did nobles become more urban or more rural, or were rich nobles more likely to live in the country than poor nobles? In the first thirty years of the eighteenth century the Toulouse nobility lived mainly in the country, although after 1740 improved incomes permitted more purchases of townhouses.14 In the Sarthe the same flow to regional centers and even Paris was evident in the later Old Regime, at least prior to the difficulties before 1789.15 Something can be gleaned from the declarations of residence on the printed electoral lists of the constitutional monarchies or from the registers of the enregistrement.16 One investigation in the Sarthe found that the nobility moved away from Le Mans in the 1830s and 1840s to smaller places in the department.17\n\nA family’s principal residence is germane here. Long before the eighteenth century an alteration existed between the urban “season” and a rural retreat for the hot and harvest times. Of course, a winter in Paris was not at all the same as one in Bordeaux or, even less, Sens or Bourges. An aristocrat interviewing his bailiffs or indulging in a little hunting on his estates during a brief rural escape from Paris had a very different sense of country life than did a Breton gentleman conscious that economies in running the family estate would permit the annual extravagance of spending the winter in a rented house in Rennes. The relation of rural noblesse with their tenants was different from that of a duc d’Uzès, whose wife, Anne de Mortemart, described a series of visits in 1867 to the various family properties at Boursault, Bonnelles, Uzès, Entrains, Sancerre, and Villers-en-Prayères. At Uzès they were welcomed by twenty-five shots from a cannon with the family crest upon it. She claimed that the château had been protected during the Revolution by local people, who, to conceal their aim, turned the building into a school, an act approved by the authorities.18 (The same thing happened to the La Rochefoucauld château at Liancourt.) After the Revolution Uzès was too delicate to take over his old home before a new school had been found—to the costs of which he made a generous contribution, we are assured—and only then, around 1830, did the family return under the ancestral roof. Anne de Mortemart added that the estate manager (régisseur) had received permission to take home some furniture and barrels of wine at the time of the Revolutionary confiscations and that in those barrels were all the Uzès family papers: “And that is how our precious archives remained intact.”19\n\nSuch visits from aristocrats living in Paris were not the same thing as inspections by penny-pinching country squires. Faced with crucial decisions about investing limited funds in either urban or rural property, increasingly the poorest of the noblesse chose provincial towns. Yet sometimes the choice was dictated by the unpredictable demands of age and health, as when one recently widowed grandfather gave over to his son, around 1808, the running of his estate and château of Aguts and took up residence with a sickly daughter-in-law living in Toulouse.20 A common lament was that urban pleasures had seduced the rich away from their rural responsibilities. Emmanuel d’Harcourt wrote in 1822: “Today the charm of the countryside is not the same; the towns are depleted of rich people, who, no longer enjoying in them their former respect, willingly leave their province and their manor in order to go and look in Paris for the liberty that is born in the middle of the crowd and the diversity of pleasures.”21\n\nNoble attitudes in the Oise were deplored by the prefect Boudet de Puymaigre, who served there from 1824 to 1828: “As for the others, avid for the rewards of the court, they come to their lands in order to economize, to check the accounts with their managers [intendants], and the common people, who do not receive any sign of interest from them, feel no obligation in their regard.”22 Forty years later another noble voiced the same perennial complaint with a slightly different emphasis: “Everyone comes back to town when the autumn leaves are falling, and then, having paraded during long months all the magnificence of ruinous extravagance, they decide to go back to their uncared-for châteaux to live in solitude in order to repair by strict economy the mad prodigality of the winter season.”23\n\nFerocious economies could be undertaken in the country. At the other end of the noble social hierarchy, the aristocracy lived primarily in Parisian townhouses although spending the summers on a large estate not far from the capital. Generalizations about the “emigration to the interior,” that shunning of the Orleans regime by disgruntled supporters of the Bourbons, have greatly exaggerated and obscured this increasing metropolitanism. Leading nobles were well aware that suitably genteel hostility to the regime could be expressed in their townhouses, especially by the family women. One noble newspaper’s gossip columnist claimed in the 1840s that “the Hôtel Castellane [71, rue de Grenelle] has become, without doubt, the rendezvous of the noblesse and of the best Paris society … the Polignacs, the Bauffremonts, the Sainte-Aldégondes, the Bondys, the Crillons, the Villoutreys, the Brissacs, etc., are all to be found there.”24 Great aristocrats, as well as those who hoped to be considered such, needed a season in the capital and its contacts to maintain their claim to rank.\n\nTo sum up we can turn to the labors of Thomas Beck, who counted 13,721 adult male noble voters, that is, those with titles and those whose surnames included particles, in the 1830s. One fifth of these can be considered rural–resident in cantons with less than 5,000 in the chief town. This is broader than the French definition of rural in the 1846 census, when the number was fixed at 2,000. Conversely, more than half of the nobles lived in cities with over 10,000 people. The remainder lived in small towns, where there was also the sharpest contrast in the average amount of tax paid between the northern half of France and the southern half. Overall, despite points of detail that might constitute matters of contention between historians, Beck’s computer analysis revealed that most nobles were predominantly urban dwellers.25 Despite the doleful clamor of traditionalist commentators, nobles were well in the forefront of urbanization in France.\n\nTHE VARIETY OF ESTATES\n\nLandownership remained the touchstone of the noble social hierarchy even more than in the last century of the Old Regime. I shall return below to the vexed question of precisely what losses the nobles sustained as a result of property confiscations during the Revolutionary period. Moreover, those given awards under the compensation known to French history as the Emigrés’ Billion, individuals frequently of an advanced age, often transferred payments into state bonds, the interest of which paid for apartment rentals. Yet the newest recruits to the nobility, the titrés, wanted to add to the landholdings that underpinned their new dignity. For example, of thirty-eight adjustments to the terms of majorats sur demande between 1814 and 1830, thirty registered changes in the locations of entailed estates or increased their value. Only two reduced the total value entailed, and one transferred the entailment from land to rentes.26 These very wealthy aspirants to respectability hungered for broad hectares. As a result, the aristocratic families found more and more titré neighbors in traditional preserves of large properties close to Paris: Seine-et-Oise, Seine-et-Marne, Oise, Aisne, Eure, Eure-et-Loire, Loiret, and Orne. Choiseul-Praslin (at Vaux-Praslin), Lafayette (Rozay-en-Brie), Montmorency-Laval (Beaumesnil), Davout (Savigny-sur-Orge), and many other great names had estates relatively close to the capital.\n\nThe descriptions of general fortunes contained in the same registers of the majorats sur demande gave thumbnail sketches of noble estates in different parts of France. Clerel de Tocqueville, prefect of the Moselle when he was named a hereditary comte in 1820, owned in the Manche department the Tocqueville château, five farms, and three mills, all of which he said were in his family “from time immemorial”; domaines in the Cherbourg arrondissement worth over half a million francs; and forty-nine fractions of annual incomes (parties de rentes) on various individuals. When subtracting the dowry reserves of Mme de Tocqueville, he estimated his net worth at 861,484F, or an annual revenue of 45,611—and this did not include his prefectoral salary. Moussaye, also of old noblesse, described his Breton château, the buildings and lands around it, the métairies (rather than the fermes of the Norman Tocqueville estate), mills and meadows situated in the Saint Brieuc arrondissement, Côtes-du-Nord, containing some two hundred hectares in arable land and thirty hectares of heath—in all an estate producing a revenue of 8,860F. This was a very low per-hectare yield compared with that of regions producing more than 200F per hectare. The very first Restoration request for a majorat sur demande was by comte Jean de Gouey de la Besnardière, a conseiller d’état in charge of the political section at the Foreign Ministry who put forward a property in the Indre-et-Loire purchased in July 1808 from a Fouasse de Noirville comprising the principal manoir and ten métairies, totaling about four hundred hectares, for which he had paid the modest price of 148,125F. In the Midi, Duplessis de Pouzilhac, living at Avignon, described property he possessed in the arrondissements of Uzès, Nîmes, and Arles which produced a net revenue of 30,191F; a hotel in Avignon and a country house nearby, producing a net revenue of 3,989F, and two 5 percent bonds—giving him a net revenue of 35,343F annually. Pouzilhac château had been bought in 1781 by his uncle, at that time the local curé, from comte de Lannion for 166,000 livres. This uncle had made him the sole owner by bequest some thirty-three years before. A grander estate in Provence of 651 hectares inherited from his mother carried the ducal majorat of Emmanuel-Marie-Pierre-Félix-Isidore de Caderousse-Gramont:\n\nInstitution par M. le duc de Gramont, père du futur époux, dud.

Of course, not all châteaux belonged to nobles, and not all nobles possessed châteaux. However, the prestige of spacious (if often uncomfortable) living which derived theoretically from the feudal past lasted into the nineteenth century. When Napoleon inhabited the Tuileries, it was called a palace, but when the more genteel Bourbons were in residence, the court spoke of the château.27 Indeed, nobles in general did have more spacious housing than commoners. There were châteaux throughout France.\n\nThe comparison of the living space of nobles and commoners as revealed by the doors-and-windows tax on the electoral lists of the constitutional monarchies revealed that titled individuals paid more than two and a half times as much house tax as commoners, and twice as much as those with a particle in their name.28 Commoners and nobles who paid a similar total tax did not pay a similar doors-and-windows tax: nobles lived in larger establishments.29 Moreover, since nobles were overrepresented in the wealthiest part of the electorate, spacious dwellings were more likely to be associated with them. In the Manche, payment of a doors-and-windows tax of more than ten francs was more frequent among those with a title or a particle in their name than among those without.30\n\nAlthough the splendor or mere suitability of housing should match the owner’s pocket, there is no doubt that maintaining the château, the adjacent lands, and the country life style was one of a noble family’s highest imperatives. Descriptions of château life are found in many nineteenth-century memoirs. Mme d’Armaillé recalled the annual stay of the Ségur family at their elegant château near Fontainebleau, with its famous groves of chasselas white wine grapes and impressively large grounds, which her father had bought in 1829. The annual visit followed an immutable timetable. At the beginning of June they went to the château of La Rivière, overlooking the Seine at Thoméry (Seine-et-Marne), taking with them piano, safe, her father’s manuscripts—he, like his own father, belonged to the Académie française—and cartloads of other furniture and linens. In the countryside, she emphasized, the social life was different from that in town. Their visitors varied in background more than they did in the capital, and at lunch there was almost always a peasant farmer or former soldier and sometimes the priests from the environs. After lunch there were more visitors and informal conversation.31\n\nThere was not a specific nineteenth-century definition of a château, but it was generally understood to be a large and imposing country house, preferably with a chapel. Joseph de Villèle had a chapel constructed next to his château at Mourvilles-Basses (Haute-Garonne). The 1832 Seine-et-Oise almanac listed a “maison bourgeoise, jardin et terres” belonging to comtesse Lepie, the adjoining château of general Lepie, a “château peu important” belonging to comtesse de Lastour, a “petit château” (de Singensse), a “château assez considérable” (Lerat de Magnitot), another which was not only considerable but had an “ancienne tour” (duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt), and a “Grand et beau Château” (Tourteau de Septeuil). Of the almost one hundred châteaux listed, 61 percent belonged to noblemen, 6 percent to noblewomen, 32 percent to commoner men, and 1 percent to commoner women.32 There were infinite variations on this 1831 description of a property near Toulouse: “The lands designated under the name of Lafitte château in the commune of Castelnau d’Estrefonds [were] composed of the château buildings of all kinds, park, garden, orange trees, arable lands, vines, permanent and temporary [artificielles] meadows.”33 In the event that the residence could not pass muster to be called a château without drawing the neighbors’ smiles, it might pass under the label of maison de maître, manor, gentilhommière, or among the peasantry of the southwest, a castel. The château and its surroundings were, in theory if not always in fact, the tangible backdrop of the family existence, impregnated with traditions, memories, and prompts to appropriate conduct. This was very true of the château of the comte de Selve, a former cavalry officer, located near La Ferté-Alais (Seine-et-Oise). His family had started their climb into the nobility from a series of sixteenth-century robe positions, and by the eighteenth they were military men. We can see the château layout from the 1836 inventory of its contents.34\n\nIn the case of a family lacking such historical baggage or of a cadet starting a fresh branch, a new château was required. There was also the desire for more comfortable lodging for the family, as when the father of Corélie de Gaix decided in the early years of the nineteenth century, thanks to good agricultural profits, to pull down the old citadel (château fort), with its towers and ruined ramparts which dominated part of the countryside near Castres, and build a more commodious structure in its place. His daughter had a romantic nostalgia for the antique discomforts of the old building.35 That was not the case of baron Deschamps de la Vareinne, who produced an attestation from the subprefect and seven other witnesses that the embellishments and additions he had made to his château, together with the buildings, canals, and plantings added since 1811, had made it “one of the most agreeable places in the Montluçon arrondissement.”36 Some families found such efforts impoverishing. One young noble wife of Mayenne, upon marrying Alfred Doublard du Vigneau, replaced his modest house on the Vaucençay estate with a château complete with balustrade, donjon, two pointed towers, a library, and large reception rooms, thereby plunging the family into severe financial difficulties.37 Even the fortune of the duc de Choiseul-Praslin was strained by the expenses of repairs and improvements to the family seat at Vaux-Praslin (today Vaux le Vicomte), near Melun, when he acceded to the title in 1841.38\n\nIndeed new constructions in the “noble” style were almost as numerous between the 1820s and 1880s as during the seventeenth century. In Mayenne, for example, there were on the average, two château per commune by 1900.39 There was a similar proliferation of noble buildings in the Hautes-Pyrénées in the same period.40 Périgord also saw a rash of new châteaux, including the château of Rastignac, which appears to be a replica of the White House.41 Others were repaired, enlarged, remodeled. Madame de Dino lavished money on the Rochecotte château (Indre-et-Loire), which she bought in 1825 and which the aging Talleyrand so much enjoyed. The newer châteaux were necessarily simplified from the remains of earlier centuries to serve the needs of modern life. Moats, fortifications, and drawbridges were no longer needed save as decorative accents. By contrast, prestige rooms for dining, dancing, and receptions were emphasized to the limits of expense, as were the park, serving no purpose at all save for good-weather sauntering, and the grande allée, lined with stately trees or at the least potted flowers, which served as a repeated motif marking the progression from the gate to the main entrance. Historical whimsy was sometimes indulged, as when baron James de Rothschild had a château built at Ferrières (Seine-et-Marne) in English Elizabethan style, which attracted the visit of Napoleon III in 1862 to enjoy the opulent appointments: six carriages decorated with the baron’s livery and drawn by thoroughbreds followed the imperial coach from the railway station at Ozoir la Ferrière.42\n\nPerhaps the supreme town planner of the nineteenth-century, baron Georges Haussmann, showed a mixture of vanity and shrewdness when he took over a large property at the death of his parents-in-law and purchased an adjoining château (remodeled by the architect of the Paris Halles, Victor Baltard), to which he added a large H on the pediment. He needed “a residence where I might honorably fix my domicile and lead a sufficiently comfortable life, although less expensively than at Paris.”43\n\nTo enable one to live with honor—that was the purpose of the château. Even if they were not all exclusively in the hands of nobles, the châteaux affirmed an earlier form of dignity. It was for that that they were prized. Even if the nobles had no monopoly of the cash required to buy status, the association with nobles made the purchase of a château alluring. That was clear as far away from the Paris region as the Pyrenean foothills, where an 1854 pamphlet lauded a property near Pau not merely for its fertility but also for the neighbors: “One is there quite in the country but without being at an inconvenient distance from town. That is, once again, an advantage which many families look for, rather than that of excessive propinquity.” Besides invoking the rising land values as a result of the railway’s arrival, the pamphlet pointed out the fashionability of the property:\n\nOne can add that it [the property] is in a classy district [des mieux habités]. In fact one finds there the vacation homes [les maisons de plaisance] and the properties of M. le comte de M. (one of the finest names of the Empire); of M. le baron P.L., former peer of France; of M. le marquis d’A. (one of the oldest and richest families of Béarn); of Mme La maréchale marquise de G.; of M. de C., on the Taillefer estate; of MM. de P. et F., honorary judges at the imperial law court at Pau; and finally of several other good families both foreign and of the pays.44\n\nIdeally, each château was part of a network of relatives’ properties between which individuals moved. The de Maupas family, for example, was listed in one 1868 directory as follows:\n\n(1) Le marquis de M. au château de Poissons (Haute-Marne);\n\n(2) Le vicomte de M. au château de la Gérinière, par Château-Renault (Indre-et-Loire);\n\n(3) de M., grand officier de la légion d’honneur, sénateur, préfet chargé de l’administration du départment des Bouches-du-Rhône, conseiller général à Bar-sur-Aube, et 44 rue St. Dominique, St. Germain (Paris);\n\n(4) de M., au château de Maupas par Aix-d’Anguillon (Cher);\n\n(5) Paul de M., maître des requêtes, 72 rue de Varenne (Paris);\n\n(6) Edouard de M., à Soissons (Aisne).45\n\nThe antiquity and respectability of family property—which should not be made up of land confiscated and sold during the Revolution—was desirable for the setting up of majorats during the Restoration. When Henri de Cadevac, marquis d’Havrincourt, upgraded an 1810 comtal title to one of marquis in 1825, he proposed that the newest rank be established on the Havrincourt terre bestowed on his ancestors by letters patent dated at Chantilly in 1693.46 Comte de Rancher put up the Matetour château in the Seine-et-Oise, a property he held as the only inheritor from his brother, the marquis de Rancher, who had died before the Revolution.47 Other châteaux were innocent of any family cachet. Baron Gaullier, son of the Tours procureur du roi, received farms from his father’s 1810 will; his father before him had received them from his father, a secrétaire du roi, who had bought them from comtesse d’Adhémar in 1784.48 Comte Lejéas paid 226,800F in 1811 to buy a fine château, farmyard, and nearby land at Aiserey (Côte-d’Or), sold by the creditors of a bankrupt.49\n\nYet, possession of a château however come by, ancient or modern, was a large part of effective claim to rank. The bonne compagnie immediately recognized a noble family without a country seat as distinctly odd. There was a sense of the appropriateness of property to pretension. Armand de Melun described the Montalembert château at Roche-en-Brénil (Côte-d’Or) in 1856 as “a château that, if neither princely nor too gothic, has, however, enough moats and towers without, enough escutcheons, old tapestries, and emblems within, to suit the son of a crusader and the historian of Saint Elisabeth.”50 This importance shone through family attitudes to buildings often extremely uncomfortable and expensive to maintain. A roseate recollection of the Rességuier château at Drudas (Haute-Garonne) during the Restoration gives a rather positive account of the family’s country seat:\n\nA considerable property surrounded the château. Two steps away lay the church and village. In a word, from the size and number of the farms that were attached to it and the extent of the inhabited buildings and rooms, this agglomeration richly deserved the name château which it was given in the district. The land was fertile, the hunt abundant; the only fault was of being of a difficult, almost forgotten, access … it took a good seven hours to cover the forty kilometers that separated Drudas from Toulouse.51\n\nThe Rességuiers occasionally called the château Druidas to evoke druids and cultivated mistletoe on the oaks to underline the Ossianic touch.\n\nMary Boddington had a less lyrical response to the country houses of the same district: “The châteaux within view are sad castles of discomfort, the campagnes worse; I remarked two, each with the embellishment of a huge straw stack planted exactly in the middle of the avenue which led to the entrance door, so as to interdict all approach.… Yet some have a look—half farm, half manor house—that is not amiss.”52 “Half farm, half manor house” was how many châteaux appeared to visitors used to the great country establishments of English aristocrats, generally wealthier than their French counterparts.53\n\nTHE PLACE OF NOBLES IN THE RURAL ECONOMY\n\nCuriously, it is harder to examine the place of the nobility in the agricultural economy of the nineteenth century than a hundred years earlier. After the Revolution, however, nobles were not separated from non-nobles on the tax roles, so details of their estate size or tax assessments became swallowed up in the general taxonomies of the enquiries of 1840, 1852, 1862, and 1882. Historians are still hard at work trying to arrive at a better understanding of the changes that took place in French agriculture during the nineteenth century, and until they reach some conclusions, the participation of nobles can be gauged only from observations made by informed contemporaries such as the agronomist Léonce de Lavergne or from aggregate statistics together with studies of individual estates.54 The task is not lightened by the great variations in terrain and climate within France.\n\nAs H. D. Clout’s French Agriculture on the Eve of the Railway Age pointed out, historical studies of French agriculture have been fragmented by concentration on the department or region or on the individual estate.55 This resulted from the inaccessibility or unwieldiness of information dealing with agriculture at a national level. The nineteenth century saw the emergence of national statistics in a more usable form, and Clout himself made exhaustive use of the enquiry of 1836. At that time the land survey (cadastre) initiated by Napoleon 1 was still incomplete. The cadastre was also department-bound and could not express the elaborate network of holdings that made up the collective property of noble families. These were linked together by obligations in marriage contracts on properties held in other names than that of the male head of household. They were also linked by a sense of obligations other than those spelled out by the Civil Code, as in the example given below of a bachelor on the maternal side whose death so handsomely contributed to the prosperity of the Raigecourt family. His own family name being on the verge of extinction, since he was without progeny, he passed his property on to a male in another family to whom he had only collateral obligations. As the social category most likely to have properties in scattered parts of France, the nobles, particularly at the wealthiest levels, were least well portrayed in the aggregate statistical compilations drawn from local studies of the cadastres.\n\nThe electoral lists (and those of the various enumerations of notables) of 1800–1870 cannot adequately overcome these obstacles. They were of uneven quality. Historians have made the greatest use of those dealing with the constitutional monarchies. In 1937 Sherman Kent pointed to the imperfect picture given by the focus on a single jurisdiction, the exclusion of wealthy women (although widows and other women of means not blessed with a mate could designate a family member to represent their property; however, there was no evidence of this on the list), and problems involved in calculating the real wealth represented by the sums of taxation printed on these rolls.56 With these reservations in mind, a variety of insights can be gleaned from electoral lists. For agricultural history, however, there is a serious flaw in that many historians refer to the land tax, the predominant part of the totals for eligibility as elector or deputy (the cens), as though it were everywhere taken at a standard rate. The late Albert Soboul does this in his magisterial chapter in the Histoire économique et sociale de la France when he discusses the impact of the Revolution on land ownership. It is important to realize when drawing national conclusions that this was not the case, although it is not easy to recalculate the statistics.\n\nSet up during the Revolution under the impulse of physiocratic notions, the foncière provided some two-thirds of the total of all direct taxes during the July Monarchy and over a quarter of the kingdom’s annual revenue.57 Kent deduced from an examination of statistics that 79 percent of the foncière on average was derived from land but that only 21 percent was derived from the buildings, barns, houses, bridges, and so on, to be found on the property. By using an estimate of net average income to landowners in France of 40F per hectare, he advanced that the land tax took 12.5–14.3 percent of net income. Kent readily admits that these are notional figures, especially to the extent that the net yield per hectare is the residue of the gross after the deduction of costs for seed, cultivation, harvesting, and the expense of maintaining farm animals. Thanks to Clout, we now have a map of average yield per hectare by arrondissement calculated from the 1836 statistics; it shows the considerable gap between levels of return.58 At various times under the Empire, the Restoration, and the July Monarchy, voices were raised in protest against the inequities of taxation of this varied agricultural production. However, the chorus of unhappy landowners never swelled sufficiently to overturn these differences, differences that had actually been increased by bureaucratic adjustments in the 1820s as prefectural staffs tried to manipulate tax assessments of landowners according to their political sympathies. The amount of foncière to be paid was fixed for each department, and each then subdivided the assessment among its cantons. To Paris, the status quo was preferable to reform, which would inflame jealousies. One generally overlooked calculation after the Revolution of 1830 emphasized inequities in levels of land tax. This was the work of an individual and may be exaggerated, but it suggests the need to correct nuances in earlier accounts (see appendix 1).\n\nSome nobles farmed their properties directly, but it was more usual to have one of the three main types of tenant farmers, just as in the eighteenth century.59 A widespread method of managing property was to lease land to tenants, in either sharecropping units (métairies) or small farms to families, who cultivated the land for an annual rent under the surveillance of the régisseur. The total area of leased land was usually less than 25 hectares but might reach 50 hectares. Another type was the large-scale tenant, almost exclusively from the Paris Basin and northeastern France and specializing particularly in wheat production for an accessible urban market. He was thus in direct contact with production and marketing, or what in our own century might be called agribusiness. His lease was often for nine years or longer. Finally there were fermiers généraux, who collected rent from up to a dozen or more subtenants, who might pay their dues in produce or cash. Leases were usually of six to nine years. Before the Revolution, the biggest landowners and aristocrats had preferred this form, and they continued to do so afterwards. Longer leases were assumed to stimulate innovation. The large landowners of the 1787 Assemblée provinciale of Melun protested against three-year leases as too short. A deputy from Meaux, in the same wealthy agricultural region, was behind the 25 May 1835 law permitting communes and hospitals to lease their property for as long as eighteen years.60 The fermiers généraux were common along the Saône and Rhône valleys, in Maine and Anjou. The fermier général was often involved in lending and rural credit. Tenant hostility was more likely to be against him than the noble landowner, who, for his part, at one remove from the peasantry, was content to receive a regular and, he hoped, trouble-free income.\n\nTHE EFFECT OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION ON NOBLE LANDOWNERSHIP\n\nThe nobles’ place in nineteenth-century French agriculture can be surveyed in order to comprehend better both continuities and change, but to do so requires brief consideration of the lasting effect of Revolutionary legislation on the property of the former noblesse. It is well known that before 1789 everywhere in France, although to differing degrees, the proportion of agricultural property belonging to nobles exceeded their proportion in the national population. This was truest in northern France, especially near Paris, where nobles owned the best arable land. In the south, estates were generally smaller, but the nobles possessed from 20 percent to a third of the agricultural land, usually the best arable land, as in Aquitaine. Often described as an attack on seigneurialism, the Revolution brought to an end many financial and feudal exactions on tenants. The confiscated property of noble émigrés was put up for sale. To inquire into the economic and social consequences of the sale of the biens nationaux a commission was established under the Third Republic. The commission reported in a series of publications that traced the extent of land transfers; analyzed how confiscated property, both ecclesiastical and individual, was sold; and examined the results of the property confiscations of émigré nobles. The investigations usually revealed buyers to be predominantly urban office holders, mostly lawyers and petty bureaucrats, together with speculators, merchants transferring paper profits into real estate, and the richer peasants. Large commercial estates in the modern sense rarely emerged, reflecting that the lots were often small: in the Toulousain the average purchase was seven and a half hectares.61 When larger estates were assembled, it was generally from clerical property, which in the Meurthe and other places sold more cheaply than noble property. Perhaps the cheapness resulted from the absence of the agents or relatives of the despoiled, who made 16.7 percent of the total purchases in that department in salvage operations of family estates.62\n\nA growing body of historical evidence questions the lingering idea that the Revolution saw a lasting spoliation of nobles at large. Some sales were simply never carried out. Adroit nobles in touch with local politics and administrators were often in the best position to set in motion a whole network of complicities to defend their patrimonies. Nobles had not lost the Old Regime taste for litigation, and so the French archives were bequeathed a rich harvest of account books, receipts, leases, bills, and, on occasion, vituperative pamphlets directed against tax assessors. During the Revolution the nobles who remained at home, or at the least the elderly men and women of the family, spurred on by family legends of tax gatherers confounded and lawsuits that had lasted for generations and aided by the faithful (or so they hoped) notary, who often enough under the Revolution found himself a municipal official, used every procedural device to stave off confiscation and exactions on the family property.\n\nMarquise du Hardas de Hauteville requested and obtained legal separation of property in 1792 after her husband’s emigration in order to save her dowry: a château and estate that had been in her family for two centuries. Subsequently she divorced the marquis and successfully reclaimed part of her dotal property. At this point the counterrevolutionary activities of her sons posed a new threat to the estate, but she showed admirable tenacity in warding off confiscation of the presuccession on her twelve farms, a walled garden, two mills, and a château, property that had been evaluated at a half-million livres in 1789. After 1800 she recovered in her husband’s name some portions of the sold property. On 18 nivôse XI she repurchased the splendid new château which they had constructed just before the Revolution. In 1825 the properties were producing an annual revenue of 9,442F, indicating recovery of about half of the pre-Revolutionary value. In 1827 the marquis was awarded an annual rente of 14,558F, for a total indemnity of 485,283F in the Emigrés’ Billion. The family had, after many vicissitudes, survived quite well financially, thanks largely to the efforts of the marquise.63 To the south Christine de Fleury saved her family property from confiscation by ten years of unremitting legal chicanery to hold on to the hot springs that provided the bulk of her family’s income in the nineteenth century.64 Among the court nobility similar prodigies were to be found. The wife of one of Louis XVI’s bankers, Laborde, saved for her son’s return from Austrian emigration what contemporaries called the considerable remains of a colossal fortune.65 With Napoleon’s advent as first consul, the women showed an equal diligence in requesting the removal of names from the lists of proscribed émigrés in the event that there were any among their kin. The documentalist mania of the French bureaucracy was plaited into a protective cocoon around the family property.\n\nIf the majority of noble families preserved the bulk of their wealth, a minority did suffer grievous losses. As a rough rule to which all kinds of exceptions can be made, the principal losers among the nobles were the poorer noblesse (represented especially heavily among the military officers who left France to continue to support the princes and then, as often as not, younger sons) or those from areas closest to the frontiers, such as the shabby gentry of the Pyrenean valleys. More spectacular losers were found among the rich aristocrats. They were in evidence at Versailles and in fashionable society, habitual absentees from their properties, especially vulnerable to a vengeful société populaire or a greedy overseer, although the Saulx-Tavanes were very lucky in their estate manager. The losses even for the court aristocrats should not be overstated. Of fifty-one hereditary ducs at the outbreak of the Revolution twenty emigrated, but at least twenty-seven stayed in France and were in a position to protect some, if not all, of their interests.66 Of the peers on 1 January 1825, 121 received indemnities from the Emigrés’ Billion.67\n\nThe majority of nobles followed the dictates of prudence in as self-effacing a way as possible in the hope of avoiding confiscation or exactions. Indeed, for many of them the Revolution brought immediate material advantage, at least in those places where the profits of seigneurial dues represented a small proportion of income. Abolition of the tithe more than compensated for the losses of seigneurial payments. Of course this was untrue of those provinces such as Burgundy, where feudal exactions exceeded the tithe by quite a lot, but the observation serves to remind us that when we look more closely at the actual conduct of the nobles and the various means used to avoid punitive legislation, we are far from encountering a ruined or spoliated class. A resident nobility that survived the Revolution relatively unscathed thanks to submission to the local authorities and ingenious legal pettifogging was scarcely promising material from which to manufacture a mythology of modern Bayards. As a result, right-wing historians found no reason to quarrel with the judgments of their republican colleagues about the serious wounds inflicted on the privileged. To do so would have detracted from the martyrology of the Revolution that they wished to promote. Conservatives and republicans agreed, then, in stressing the damages sustained by nobles, but what were the facts of the matter?\n\nConclusions derived from the sale documents of the biens nationaux may sometimes be questioned. The main criticism of histories based on the documentation of the sales is that they almost never follow what happened to the property afterwards. Transactions were rarely permanent. Often they represented no more than a speculative purchase for quick resale within a year or two. Property changed hands frequently at the beginning of the nineteenth century, as shown in a study of the search for tangible assets in an economy as volatile and inflationary as that in Paris between 1795 and 1803.68 A variety of investigations have shown that nobles remained in a leading place among post-Revolutionary landowners. In the Laval district of Mayenne 26 percent of émigré property was sold, but of that as much as 62 percent was repurchased by relatives or returned émigrés. In consequence the permanent property transfer from the former owners to another family was a scant 10 percent.69\n\nOf course, in that situation the poorest nobles were most vulnerable, for they could not command the credit (even in depreciating assignats) to pull off such deals. In western France the Sarthois noblesse at least partially recovered their hold on local property, despite the sale to commoners of almost 200 châteaux during the Revolutionary period.70 Paul Bois claimed more boldly that after the Revolution as before, local nobles owned about 21 percent of the Sarthe.71 A study of the Loire-Atlantique estimates that the nobility lost at least 20 percent of their pre-Revolutionary holdings—a heavy blow but in no sense a complete spoliation.72 In neighbouring Mayenne, however, only 24 of the 250 existing châteaux, or less than 10 percent, were sold.73 A study of landownership in the Nivernais in the period 1830–40 showed that nobles possessed 26.5 percent of the surveyed area, and this in the largest estates, which allowed the author to write of “true latifundium.”74 Property sold and repurchased, property never put up for sale in fact, and property protected from confiscation by a host of legal strategems, especially delays of sale, help to explain the success of the majority of the nobles in warding off ruin.75\n\nAggregate statistics giving the location of the largest estates and statistics drawn from the electoral lists may be usefully compared. In 1862, 53,000 out of 11,511,841 landowners in France paid over 500F in foncière; put another way, the richest 1 percent of all landowners generated some 20 percent of the tax revenue. By contrast, in the largest category of tax-paying landowners, 77 percent of the total, the mean land tax paid was less than 20F.76 One study of the electors in the 1840s showed that nobles whose title figured on the lists paid a mean land tax of 2,050F. Those whose name contained a particle but without mention of a title paid a mean tax of 871F. The vast majority of the electors with neither title nor particle paid a mean tax of 380F. Moreover, 85 percent of those with a title paid more than 500F in foncière even though they numbered only 1.5 percent of the electorate. Of those with a particle, 59 percent paid more than 500F in foncière while making up 1.7 percent of the electorate; 23 percent of commoners paid more than 500F in foncière while making up 96.9 percent of the electorate. From the two sets of figures we deduce that nobles were very heavily overrepresented among the 53,000 wealthiest landowners.77 Such calculations are less easily made for the period after 1848, since the nature of the electoral rolls changed, and we need to find another measure of the evolution of noble landholdings through the 1860s. However, a survey of agricultural tax statistics for the decades from the 1850s to the 1880s made plain those regions in which large-scale property predominated. Joined with the earlier deductions, it permits a crude but fair contrast between wealthier, northern nobles with large estates and less successful, southern counterparts, despite notable exceptions such as the sizable Gramont-Caderousse estates in the Vaucluse and Gard described earlier.\n\nUltimately, however, the success or failure of the noble landholder, wherever his lands were located, depended on family strategies. Not all nobles behaved in the same way—a statement that is self-evident save to those who deny the noble capacity for change. This is shown by two examples completely at odds but both drawn from estates in the Saône-et-Loire. The comte de Rambuteau at Chaunay had an estate of over ninety-five hectares in size until 1873, at which time it was sold to his grandson, Lombard de Buffières, a baron and avocat at Millassière who was married in that year. The latter demolished fourteen cottages belonging to vintners in 1882 and sold off almost fifteen hectares in 1896 but promptly bought another sixteen. There was no further change until 1912. Despite the change of ownership between nobles, albeit that the avocat carried a less famous name than the former peer of France, this property remained in the hands of the titled for a century. By contrast, comte de Noaille’s estate near Mâcon (Senozan) steadily wasted away as small lots were sold off, going from 119 hectares in 1826 to 80 in 1834, 62 in 1842, and 54 in 1857. By 1857 this steady attrition had reached its term, at least until 1906.78 The first estate could be cited for the stability of noble property, and the second for its relentless decline, but neither makes much sense unless we can recreate the overall evolution of the Rambuteau and Noailles fortunes. We need to know the location of their land and real estate holdings throughout France, as well as their choice of other investments.\n\nSales and exchanges of land by Parisian residents were particularly numerous and affected limitrophe departments. A rather detailed example of the changes in one estate, Gineste in the Montfort commune near Rambouillet (Seine-et-Oise), illustrates the recent history of a piece of property in the radius of highly desirable properties close to Paris. It was sold in August 1808 for 161,000F, of which 60,000 was paid in cash, with the remainder, plus 5 percent interest, due a year later. The sale act traced the ownership for the preceding thirty years, covering the whole of the Revolution:\n\nFrom\n\nAdjudicated to\n\nDate\n\nBouillé\n\nSimon\n\nJuly 1775\n\nSimon\n\nde Chavigny\n\nAugust 1778\n\nde Chavigny\n\nd’Espagnac\n\nJanuary 1786\n\nd’Espagnac\n\nAllemand de Champier\n\nFebruary 1792\n\nde Champier’s widow\n\nde Gricourt\n\nAugust 1808\n\nThe property was described as having been before the Revolution of 46 percent biens nobles and 54 percent common (rotures), complete with château, but in 1808 de Champier’s widow, now married to a commoner, described the “maison de maître” with its variety of rooms, including a fine billiard room, four servants’ rooms, and stables with space for six horses, four carriages, and sleeping for two coachmen. The furniture was included in the sale and estimated at 3,000F. The estate boasted five houses, a small vineyard of 48 ares, a watermill and its dependencies, 29.5 hectares of arable land, 7.6 hectares of meadow, and 29.5 hectares of woodlands.79\n\nThe purchase and sale of châteaux and estates continued at a steady pace throughout the century, and just as much as property transfers resulting from dowries and wills, this commerce altered the noble place in the countryside more than the legislation of the Revolution had. Nobles, particulary Parisians, often made transactions outside their department of residence. On 2 November 1850, to take two examples among tens of thousands over the century, M. Joseph de Monicault, a prefect under the July Monarchy now dwelling on the quai Voltaire, and his wife sold to a sapper captain’s widow who lived on the unmodish boulevard Gobelins a farm in Coulommiers arrondissement (Seine-et-Marne), with a total area of 234 hectares, for 260,000F. On the same day the notary exchanged various parcels of land in the Pontoise arrondissement (Seine-et-Oise) between an avocat and César de Choiseul, who lived on the fashionable rue de l’Université.80 A few months earlier he had acquired for 300F a small field of just 38 ares in Cosne arrondissement (Nièvre) from Clerel de Tocqueville, who owned it as a result of a four-elevenths claim as the nephew of M. de Damas-Crux on the estate of his widow. The plot of land was surrounded by Choiseul-owned fields.81\n\nThese continual transactions in different departments incite considerable caution over conclusions based on the study of mini-regions on the turnover of property, as in the Saint-Léon near Toulouse: “During the eighteenth century property of under 5 hectares stagnated, that of 30 to 60 receded, while there was an advance of large properties of over 60 hectares which made up 10 estates in 1830 instead of only 8 in 1730. From 1830 to 1885 massive advance of small and medium property, collapse of the large. The four domaines of more than 100 hectares disappear.”82 The historian of a noble family would wish to complete strictly localized information by a study of whether the lineage dwindled in wealth or whether the property was sold in one place and the money reinvested elsewhere. One division of property in the Basses-Pyrénées, not far from the Spanish border, in 1839 revealed a military noble family’s widely scattered property, including a Parisian house, a flour mill in the Lot-et-Garonne, woods in the Oise which had provided a seigneurial title to the grandfather before 1789, as well as lands from Calvados which figured in their father’s 1810 majorat. Girardin property was thus in five departments and two different regions, as well as in the capital. The dispersal of the properties means that any conclusions about the economic situation of nobles drawn from regional studies, let alone those of departments or small towns, do not necessarily apply to that aristocratic family.83 This point has been made forcefully by Clout in his discussion of the effects of the monographic tradition in studies of French agricultural history on the eve of the railway age.84 The noble family strategy in agriculture lies between aggregate statistics and those of the department or agricultural regions.\n\nEconomic decisions by noble landowners were crucial to their success at a time of real change in French agriculture with the evolution of regional specializations—such as the wine of the Midi, the northern sugar beet, wheat growing in the Paris Basin, the Massif Central’s changeover to rye—which were marked by the time of the agricultural enquiries of the 1880s and sounded the death-knell of the diffuse and often ill-adapted polyculture of pre-railway days. However, it was simpler for nobles, and anyone else who thought that long-established big landowners were stabilizing “tradition-carriers” in the countryside, to find a scapegoat in the Civil Code. They preferred to believe that the Revolutionary laws had sapped the moral basis of monarchy in the countryside rather than to accept that a commercial rationalization of agriculture affected even nobles. Napoleonic inheritance laws splintered property, and in turn this produced the collapse of family solidarity—so ran the conventional wisdom in the salons of Norman cháteaux or the dining room of Gascon manors. Robert-Trancrède de Hauteville in an 1862 pamphlet made a typical lamentation about the “new legislation”: “One cannot ignore the unfortunate results produced daily by its application. Not only does it have as a consequence this unlimited parceling out of landed property which puts such regrettable obstacles to agricultural progress but, even more, this perpetual turnover of estates tends to weaken without ceasing the bonds of the family, to efface its traditions, and to thus shake the very bases on which it rests.”85\n\nIn general one can say that nobles preferred moral explanations of their changing circumstances to any appreciation of economic innovations. However, a few candid nobles voiced the truth. Martignac coolly appraised myth and reality in the chorus of noble groans about their spoliation during the Revolution:\n\nOf émigré property only a billion was sold—exactly 987,819,968F96—and most of that billion was restored to those who were entitled by the indemnity law of 17 April 1825. Even among the goods sold some had been bought covertly by the families of the émigrés or by go-betweens; others were voluntarily sold by those who acquitted them freely, by legal agreements, by wills, by exchanges, or by the reimbursement of all or part of the price. The true dispossession has not exceeded three or four millions, and the equivalent of that loss and beyond having been recovered by marriages, one would probably find, if one looked closely, that the majority of the families that the Revolution believed it had ruined are richer today than in 1789.86\n\nLéonce de Lavergne, a prominent member of the Société centrale d’agriculture under the Second Empire, took up the same refrain in his book about French rural economy, republished on various occasions between the 1850s and the 1870s, saying that nobles were wealthier in the mid-nineteenth century than on the eve of the Revolution.87\n\nIn the crucible of productivity changes and the new crops introduced into French agriculture a new taxonomy emerged among nobles, more significant by far than former distinctions between robe and sword, noblesse and titré, Legitimists and those who served the government of the day: by 1870 the major stress line between nobles was that which separated landed families of real means from those who no longer found, in the countryside, adequate revenue for their pretensions. The wealthiest noble landowner in France during the first half of the century was probably the duc de Choiseul-Praslin (whose family property is discussed in chapter 3).88 A little later the closest rivals in point of wealth were the marquis d’Aligre, of an Old Regime robe family, and the duc de Crillon.\n\nAn estate’s profitability certainly depended more on location than on the gentility of its owner, and despite notable exceptions, there seem really to be no grounds for arguing that there was any appreciable difference in farming skill between nobles and commoners with estates of similar size. In any event, the different ways of running an estate were found side by side. In mid-century Loir-et-Cher there were châteaux whose immediate environs were cultivated by gardeners under the eye of the owner, while adjacent farms on the estate were leased; estates where all the land was leased, with the interests of the owner being watched over by a régisseur; and even a few estates like that of the mayor of Launay, de Brunier, who himself managed the large farms.89 Comte de Falloux took great pride in the consolidation and profitability of his Angevin estate at Bourg d’Ivré, to which he devoted all his energies after his withdrawal from active politics at the advent of the Second Empire.90 However, despite individual exceptions—and the historian is generally better informed about the successful and dynamic farmer than about the slovenly and incompetent one—all indices reveal that northern agriculture improved at a faster rate than did that of the south.\n\nGreat landowners in the departments near Paris emerged at the pinnacle of wealth among nobles now more rarely funded by the profits of state service than from the commercial agriculture of the Seine-et-Marne, Seine-et-Oise, Eure, and so on. In 1822 Harcourt noted with satisfaction the decline of the triennial rotation and other pernicious agricultural practices in the progressive northern departments, although one can recall that the elder Villèle in the southwest was just as eloquent on this topic under the Empire.91 The marquis de Chambray, a graduate of the Ecole polytechnique, wrote in 1831 of the agricultural improvements possible in the Nivernais while excoriating the sharecroppers for their backwardness. He told his readers that far too many buyers of land were careless about the true value of what they purchased, and he told of selling for almost 100,000F in small lots a property that did not bring in 1,200F in revenues.92 The north-south contrast in France was evident to contemporaries such as Léonce de Lavergne, who compared the feudal law, large properties, work done by horses, leased farms, and triennial rotation of the north with the Roman law, small properties, work done by oxen, sharecropping, and biennial rotations of the south. He perceived that these characteristics linked together to produce an agriculture not solely because of climate.93\n\nA historic turning point in French agriculture occurred between 1850 and 1860 when the total area of arable land in wheat began to shrink from the high point of 58.8 percent (of eighty constant departments). For the first time in more than a thousand years the pressure to sow ever more land in wheat ended, despite the rising national population and a generally better-fed one. The reflux was owing mainly to the approximate doubling of wheat yields during the century but also to improvements in the transport of grain by both ship and rail, which caused landowners to give up wheat cultivation on marginal or unsuitable soil. Instead, wheat cultivation became increasingly a speciality of the northern lowlands and the environs of Paris—the Beauce, the pays Chartrain, Champagne, the Brie, Picardy, Flanders, and Upper Normandy. This was the area preferred by the court aristocracy with large northern estates. By contrast, nobles sowed fewer potatoes, another crop that dramatically increased its yield during the nineteenth century. The new crop of sugar beets took only 1 percent of the cultivated arable land but predominated on the northern plains. The mildew crisis of the vineyards permitted rapid growth in industrial production of sugar-beet alcohol, while waste pulp could be used economically for feeding slaughter cattle. Great fortunes were to be made in the drink trade, as the English “beerage” attested, and the aristocrats in France reaped some profits from distillation.\n\nAt the same time that urban requirements and new crops offered great possibilities, other traditional crops dropped out of favor, either because of a collapse of demand—as when madder was replaced by a cheaper, metallic dye—or because of changes in consumer tastes. Market gardening provided bounding profits for suppliers of the burgeoning cities. Increased beef and mutton consumption considerably stimulated new animal husbandry methods adapted to large farms with plenty of stables and pasture. The dairy industry offered increasing rewards thanks to rising demand for butter and cheese. Speaking loosely, farmers in northern France profited from the structural changes in agriculture that took place during the nineteenth century. The Midi saw its traditional polyculture collapse, just as the silkworm diseases, maladies of the vine, the demise of dye plants such as woad and madder, and the inauspicious terrain and climate for the production of the fleshy sheep and cows sought by the hungry towns all heightened the contrast.94\n\nOne must bear in mind that a map of noble rural residences in the nineteenth century tells us little about comparative land values. For example, an 1807 report on the average per hectare price of top-grade land in adjacent arrondissements of southwestern France indicated the following: 2,800–3,200F (Castelsarrasin), 2,200–2,400F (Toulouse), 2,000F (Villefranche), 1,500F (Saint-Gaudens).95 In the 1850s a hectare on the Limagne Plain, close to Clermont (Puy-de-Dôme), perhaps the richest soil in France, sold in the range of 5,000–10,000F. Theoretically, a regional study would thus show that a noble estate near Castelsarrasin under the First Empire could be half the size of one in the foothills of the Pyrenees, close to Saint-Gaudens, and represent the same level of wealth. A similar, even more dramatic contrast could be drawn between a noble family owning a Bordelais vineyard and an impoverished Landais petty noble family owning fetid ponds and salt-and sand-blown fields of almost sterile earth. Obviously, estimates like that provided by Lesur in La France et les français en 1817, which gives the national average gross product of one hectare as 110F per annum, or that of Lullin de Chateauvieux in Voyages agronomiques en France (1843), giving 40F as the average net income per hectare (that being the gross minus costs of seed, planting, cultivation, harvesting, and draught animals), are of little precise use.96\n\nPressures generated by the short-term crises of 1847–52 and 1853–57, together with bigger structural changes in techniques and the increase in the number of mini-properties, were not fully understood by contemporary nobles. The most disquieting effect was the rural exodus, blamed more on the insidious attractions of vice-ridden, drink-sodden towns than on the stricken condition of landless journaliers.97 During the 1840s the depopulation continued apace, and the first signs of the demographic consequence of the definitive migration of younger adults appeared: aging field hands and fewer births in the villages. The noble landowner became as conscious as his untitled neighbor that he had fewer sharecroppers to choose among and that workers asked for more. Cardevac d’Havrincourt found with great satisfaction that women could do many of the traditionally male jobs on his big estate near Arras, and this stopped the pernicious tendency to take up embroidery.98 Cheap labor had been important to the recouping of noble prosperity in the Empire and the Restoration in the absence of innovation in crops or techniques, but now the situation reversed as urban growth offered refuge to the victims of the driving exploitation of the landlords, noble and commoner alike. Doubtless the improved mobility introduced into France by the railway quickened traditional migratory flows such as that from the poorer soils of the Yonne. Local nobles found that the peasants were attracted away by the prospects of higher wages. The railway that carried them ruined traditional transport-associated industries (carters, innkeepers, rivermen-boatmen) which earlier had provided a supplementary income to local peasants. All over France the increased mobility and urban growth upset traditional economic arrangements and set the feet of the excess rural population itching to escape their often insufferable conditions.\n\nLiterary testimony by observers of the aching misery of the poor concord with the more rebarbative but equally damning statistics of the enregistrement, which charted the growing destitution of the bottom echelons of rural society, landless day laborers, called by a host of names according to region but everywhere the victims of an agricultural society sloughing off the last vestiges of communal and village rights.99 The bold assertion that rural poverty excited special compassion among nobles was, alas, not wholly true. Nobles could scarcely overlook the fact that poverty, at least in the short run, guaranteed a source of servile cheap labor. Tenant farmers relied on the inexhaustible supply of poverty-stricken migrants from the Massif Central for whatever extra hands were needed and usually paid starvation wages. To judge from random evidence, tenants themselves took increasing profits: in Mees (Mayenne) a noble rented farms on a nine-year lease without changing the conditions between 1819 and 1828, while the tenant’s livestock rose in value from 2,254F to 5,671F.100\n\nIt is difficult to know how many noble landlords were also good managers and farmers. Did nineteenth-century nobles show a particular bent for innovation in agriculture, by contrast with their traditional methods of precise bookkeeping, but little technical renovation? The question is worth posing, since historians have noted that before the establishment of training centers such as the Institut national agronomique (1876) farmers learned mainly by example. Training in new agricultural techniques at the handful of privately funded schools—such as Grignon (Seine-et-Oise), which was founded in 1827 on a property provided by Charles X (and became a public institution in 1848), or the model farm of Grand Jouan, near Rennes, founded in 1830—was not sufficiently widespread to counteract the traditional and less productive methods employed on many family estates. Views on the merits of rye or sugar beets, or on the merits of one breed of pig or cow over those of another, were most frequently transmitted from father to son.\n\nNobles were, of course, prominent on the membership lists of many agricultural societies, but it remains to be investigated how assiduously they attended meetings. Article 8 of the royal ordonnance of 28 January 1819 had stated that corresponding members of a national agricultural council would be chosen by Paris after nominations by the prefect of each department of those most active in those pursuits. The accompanying circular made plain that these individuals should not only be sufficiently rich to afford a slow return on investment but, even more important, have the personal reputation and the honorable renown that would cause others to follow their example. Each departmental correspondent was, rather optimistically, supposed to donate a piece of his property for instructional purposes. Some months later a clarification followed to say that landowners would not lose the profit from those experimental lands and to add that all the nominees would be named correspondents (to assuage any jealousies that might have arisen). The vocabulary used was a set of code words encouraging the landed gentry to collaborate with commoners, and they were reminded that without doubt the encouragement most likely to stimulate them to further exertions was the likelihood of being useful to their pays, as well as drawing “a benevolent look from His Majesty.”101\n\nCertainly noble participation in local agricultural societies was greatly increased. In the Yonne the prefect nominated two nobles and two commoners: one of the latter was chosen, but he joined to his other merits the fact of being a councillor at the prefecture. The Tonnerre subprefect nominated marquis de Tanlay, who possessed in the Yonne, Aube, and Côte-d’Or domains with an annual revenue of 60,000F from a variety of terrains, fields, vines, meadows, woods, and gorse. He also owned a flock of 150 merinos descended from the first animals imported from Spain in 1777. The total value of his properties was over 1.5 million francs. The marquis spent most of the year at Tanlay, where he himself oversaw some 60–70 hectares of good soils on his property that he was prepared to donate to experimental agriculture.102\n\nOf the 288 French members the leading figures were the duc de la Rochefoucauld, baron Morel-Vindé, and comte Chaptal, all peers of France. There were also baron de Ramond, like Chaptal a member of the Académie des Sciences, and comte de Lasteyrie as secretary. Taking the membership at large, 18 percent were titled, and a further 21 percent had a particle in their names.103 Examination of the 136 members of the Nièvre agricultural and industrial society in 1839 showed 11 percent titled and 24 percent with a particle.104 The publisher of Lullin de Chateauvieux in 1843 noted that in 86 departments there were 157 agricultural societies; 22 model farms, of which some had schools associated with them; a further 15 schools and chairs of agricultural science for prisoners; and another 664 comices agricoles or comités d’agriculture.105 The membership lists of these agricultural societies showed variations in the number of noble members but also a continuing aristocratic taste for the mysteries of drainage, irrigation, and crop improvement.\n\nBesides knowledge of new advances in crops, there was also the issue of what might be called management attitudes. In 1822 Harcourt summarized the economic outlook necessary for being a successful farmer in terms worthy of modern agribusiness: “The same precision and spirit of order is needed, the same symmetry in every part of a rural establishment, as in a factory, which only prospers thanks to the strictest economy in the making of its products; and it is that which makes agriculture really profitable.”106 Those attitudes seem to have found an attentive ear in comte Charles de Polignac, so celebrated for the large flock of merino sheep that he carefully supervised on a Norman estate. At his death in 1830 he owned nearly seven thousand purebred animals bearing the prize-winning wool. He explained that the sheep were\n\nplaced with local farmers, who are charged to nourish and care for them according to uniform conditions laid down by printed leases renewed annually from one Saint Michael’s Day to the following. The landowner pays 9F 50 a head for the animal that does not produce and 16F 50 per ewe with lamb.… All the expenses, even the shepherd’s wages, food, and that of their dogs, are at the expense of the farmers.… I never change my farmers unless they force me into it by negligences or other reprehensible acts. In this way I keep them very mindful of their obligations.107\n\nHavrincourt also was concerned about the surveillance of agricultural workers in the Nord. He thought them bad, “the enemy of all order and arrangement, of all accounting and innovation, and there is no sort of malice that he does not employ with an incredible perseverance to demonstrate the uselessness and the inconvenience of any new tool or procedure. This is the character that gives the agriculturalist who wishes to improve his crops and to have a regulated accounting the most difficulty, for each day he has to struggle much more against his employees than against the sun and the bad weather.”108 At the same time, Havrincourt wrote of feeling obligations to farmers whose families had been tenants of his own for centuries.109\n\nOne may note Polignac’s reference to keeping tenants on, which was the usual practice across the Channel in England at the time. This has been seen as an important difference between English and French agriculture in the eighteenth century; in France there was not only a steady series of rental increases but also a constant turnover of tenants. Robert Forster emphasized the positive aspect of the English practice of not pushing tenants so hard as to stifle initiative.110 Constant turnover of tenants was not everywhere the case, of course. In his study of the Old Regime Vannetais Le Goff discovered that family tenancies held under the domaine congéable often lasted as long as ninety years, apparently more because of the expense of changing the leases than because of enlightened agricultural policy. That regional stability was perhaps continued into the nineteenth century.111 As will be seen below, even the avaricious M. de Fleurigny had maintained the Bourgeois family through a number of leases on his estate.\n\nA famous estate of the 1820s and 1830s was Roville (Meurthe-et-Moselle), celebrated in the often reprinted Annales agricoles of M. de Dombasle, which sang the praises of the plough he had invented. In order to keep up the exemplary estate at Roville, Villeneuve-Bargemont, then prefect of the Meurthe, organized a subscription, to which Choiseul, Decazes, Durand de Chagny, Hunolstein, Pange, and a galaxy of other titled individuals subscribed.112 Falloux in Anjou spent heavily on improving bloodlines and increasing yields.113 Lorgeril in the Ile-et-Vilaine was the first in his area to demonstrate the utility of large-scale liming.114 Comte d’Angeville, a retired naval officer, stimulated his neighbors in the Ain by his agricultural experiments.115 In the Loir-et-Cher in the 1840s Vibraye and Périgny were the best-known among twenty-eight nobles who made up a quarter of the agricultural society.116 In the 1850s and 1860s Havrincourt, a former polytechnician who became president of the general council of his department and a chamberlain to Napoleon III, was considered a model farmer. In 1867 he published a monograph recounting his techniques of estate management developed during the years since he had left the artillery in 1834. He reduced the number of small lots on his estate, started a successful sugar mill using a coal-fired pump to provide the necessary water, and strove to pay his workers at an hourly rate rather than by the day, and this in combination with piecework.117\n\nBadly run farms, naturally enough, were less often found in the hands of latter-day agronomists. Some nobles were maladroit, for example, Charles-Théodore-Antoine-Palamède-Félix de Forbin-Janson, owner of extensive properties in the Durance Valley, who attempted a series of unfortunate experiments. He put blood on his fields but found that any fertilizing effect was offset by the attraction to wolves. He unsuccessfully attempted large-scale sugar-beet cultivation. Despite hiring an engineer and making an investment in factory building, he had not correctly estimated the cost factors of production. The Villelaure sugar factory, the rental value of which was 11,290F paying a patente of 1,760F—an amount unmatched by any other local establishment—was forced to close and precipitated Forbin-Janson’s bankruptcy.118 From his records it was possible to reconstruct his misfortunes, but the hallmark of the incompetent farmer was inadequate estate records.\n\nThe smaller the estate the easier to follow in an unthinking way the traditional routines. The difficulties of one petty noblesse family, the Puybusque-Toutens, shone through the saccharine evocations of an early twentieth-century genealogy. Soon after his 1826 marriage, Ferdinand overreached himself in rebuilding the Toutens château (Haute-Garonne) with cash raised from a very heavy mortgage on his property. Later he saw the château and its lands slip out of his grasp and pass to a commoner. In 1848, with four children and a wife to support, desperate for money, he enlisted the sympathy of a relative, who gave him in return for annual dues the produce of properties at Villate, near Muret. The family settled into the long uninhabited château of Lacombe, where they spent about twelve years, during which “numerous births arrived to augment the lineage.”119 Puybusque-Toutens fell out with his benefactor, who had obviously sized him up shrewdly enough and who wanted to change a situation that was “from all points honorable” to that of a “mere manager” (simple régisseur), whereupon with his wife and eight children Ferdinand took himself off to stay with his grandmother. At this point some inheritances and the economy of living off the old lady gave the family, or at least Ferdinand and his wife, the wherewithal to frequent good society in Toulouse. At this point Ferdinand again revealed his inability to estimate his situation correctly and took loans far beyond the capacity of his income to repay. Even with stringent economies, he was unable to balance the family budget. Meanwhile one son made a successful military career under the Second Empire, like so many other members of the southern and Breton noblesse, and he received a dotation from Napoleon III. This son tried valiantly to pay off a variety of debts weighing on the family, but the fall of the Second Empire cut off his income. By this point there had been an (unexplained) rally in the family fortunes, although it was perhaps put in jeopardy by Ferdinand’s excessive preoccupation with his unpublished verses in French and Occitain, which, the genealogy assured posterity, were “vraiment remarquables.”120 A branch of the Hautpoul family in the nearby Aude displayed similar uneven revenues and misfortunes.121 Examples of other poorly managed small estates could be cited from all over France.\n\nThe causes behind success or failure in agriculture were thus numerous and could range from poetry to fertilizers. However, land rents rose more rapidly than salaries in nineteenth-century France, at least in the first four decades.122 On the one hand, the rural proletariat remained pauperized, and on the other hand, landowners in general saw little reason to seek for improvements in their agricultural technology. Certainly, better iron ploughs and new seeds made progress, but one can scarcely speak of a period of rapid innovation. Nonproductive, status elements of noble estates were a burdensome imperative, especially the wasted space of hallways, reception rooms, and driveways, or the crumbling vestiges of feudal donjons, or other architectural follies constructed if there were no genuine relics on the property to attest to family distinction. Only forest land could match its ornamental purposes with economic utility, as a source of wood for building materials, fuel, and cover for game. To sacrifice these symbolic dispositions of rooms and land, to plant the park with cabbages, so to speak, sacrificed status irrevocably. Exterior, visual, observed aspects of rural life were least open to change. If financial need ground landowners down to the point of selling the château and its lands, they chose to flee to urban anonymity rather than to remain diminished in the eyes of country neighbors.\n\nThe position of nobles in French rural society evolved at different rates in the partially independent regions and communities, each one with its own ethos and economy, in the years before and immediately after the advent of the railway. Some parts of France, such as Velay in the Haute-Loire, saw a precipitous decline from the numerous monastic estates and noble holdings of 1789 to what Lavergne called the “rural democracy” of small holdings by the 1850s. By contrast, in the pays de grande culture, the Beauce or the unhealthy Sologne, lying between Loire and Cher, saw a continuation of many properties of over two hundred hectares in size.123 In addition to estate size, proximity to urban markets, access to investors, and individual skill in farming, whether on poor land or good, on vineyards, meadows, or deep-ploughed fertile soil, determined profitability. Each estate had its specifics, and enough has been said to show that any claim that nobles as a social category had particular skill as farmers is highly dubious. Contemporaries preferred to make general estimates, such as that of Léonce de Lavergne comparing the landowners’ situation in 1789, 1815, and 1859 (see table 4).\n\nThe Lavergne figures show that the landowner improved his position vis-à-vis the tenant. Lavergne’s generalizations were based on a past time of agricultural prosperity propitious to landowners revealed by the tax returns on the electoral lists of the constitutional monarchies, 1815–48. Some modern historians propose a different picture.124 They emphasize that if landowner profits rose, tenant revenues rose even faster. Easier profits could be made from urban real estate in the frenetic speculations of the 1860s, secure bonds with trouble-free returns, and industrial investment. Large landowners were more disposed to sell land, just as tenants could accumulate the capital to buy. New pressures during the 1850s and 1860s were particularly deleterious to those aspects of country life most prized by nobles. Servants and fieldworkers became ever more expensive with the ravages of the depopulation. The subprefect at Joigny (Yonne) replied to the 1856 enquiry into the flight of agricultural workers from the land with a warning against official tampering with conditions of employment: “To intervene in such a delicate matter, to wish to regulate salaries and land rentals, would overthrow, to the detriment of the interests that one is trying to serve, the natural and necessary relationships that must exist between master and worker, between the landlord and his farmer.”125\n\nIn fact it was the agricultural crisis of 1846–47 that sharply drew attention to these developments. Léonce de Lavergne described it as closing “the grand epoch of the national agriculture” and summarized the difficulties as follows: “From 1846 a mysterious malady attacked the potato.… The same year saw a bad cereals harvest which produced the 1847 dearth. Then we saw, successively, the political crisis of 1848, the bad crops of 1853 and 1855, the war of the Orient, the cholera, the Italian campaign, the special construction in Paris and in some other large cities which drained the countryside of a great number of workers—all being circumstances that were very little to the advantage of agricultural development.”126\n\nAlthough the process of change was less abrupt than Lavergne believed, and the national increase in the number of small properties did not reveal its full extent until after 1880, it remains true that the golden period for the landowner, titled or not, during the first half of the century was evanescent. Increasingly heavy demands were made on the landowner to respond to a new situation; in the north the largest estates emerged from the trial strengthened and prosperous, but others splintered. The statistics of the subdivision of land show an increase in the number of smaller farms and a slight drop in the average size of the largest estates.127 This resulted partly from a fall in the rural population, which put those rural workers who remained in a better bargaining position. The markets for their produce had much increased in the towns. Those vestiges of Old Regime rents in kind (suffrage), which evoked feudal payments—of eggs, poultry, butter, cartage services, and sometimes even a promise of a day or two of work on hedges or other chores—although encountered in some post-Revolutionary leases, became much rarer after mid-century. The widow de Gussy was harking back to an earlier age when in 1839 she leased for nine years two small estates, one of under eleven hectares in sixty-eight pieces, another of sixteen hectares in seventy-one plots, for the money rental, quantities of good-quality wheat, a “plump, lively, and feathered” pair of chickens, as well as twelve kilos of fresh butter, to be delivered to her at her house in Sens.128 Everywhere in France the trend was away from these details towards an impersonal, commercial practice. Terms of leases appear to demonstrate a widespread similarity to what has been found in a part of Provence: a veritable collapse of “landlord power” between 1870 and the 1890s.129"
