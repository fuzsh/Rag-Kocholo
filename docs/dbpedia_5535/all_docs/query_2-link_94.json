There is the gerund and the gerundive, the gerund and a participle, the gerund and an infinitive, and finally the gerund and a possessive. If you promise not to raise questions such as this one again, I will refrain from telling you about each form of the gerund.\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nJustin. and I promise to never use the word again. Lets just stick with Durant's history of China. God bless him.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\n# 7006 The Chinese peasant farmer must have lived a precarious life. The only thing I can think of comparable in the US is frontier farming in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. It was a time when we were pushing our native people off their traditional lands and they did not like the idea.\n\nBubble\n\nBubble\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nMal - how delightful are those paintings. How they could paint the Great Wall, you can just imagine it from this small painting. The colors are so vibrant.\n\nJustin\n\nThese paintings by Chinese peasants represent a significant shift in the use of color. Very little of Chinese art work in the past has exhibited an interest in color. I sense an exposure to western art forms. There were several primitives in the manner of Grandma Moses shown in the Shanghai exhibition and the guache of Vegetable's exhibits techniques introduced by Georges Brach, Cezanne, and the Fauvists, particularly painters such as Derain. It would be interesting to see the works exhibited in Shanghai museums for comparison. I'd be willing bet the work of these western painters is available to the Chinese.\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nMal, would not the peasants live in mud huts still today? I doubt if they would hang such delicate paintings in their modest dwellings, but i could be wrong. In any case, I would be very happy to have most of them for my own modest home.\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nRobby: Zero.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nMaryPage\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJere Pennell\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nThe mixing of races in fairly new to Quebec, I would say it slowly increased after the war. Now in Montreal it is even hard to see someone who seems to have been born here, like me. But we have a neighbor woman who is first generation Vietnamese married to a French Canadian. You have to look hard to detect any oriental features in their 4 children and the kids speak just like everybody else around here. In Vancouver, the unofficial ratio of orientals is 1 in 3. The tendency seems to be that all races will be mixed on earth in a few centuries and it is yet unclear as to which of 2 languages between English or Chinese will be predominant.\n\ndecaf\n\nFaithr\n\nI went to high school with both Japanese and Chinese students. Many in fact. We had a large oriental population in the foothills. One of my friends Anna Park was Korean which she told us was neither one nor the other. Her family was third generation so she was as American as anyone in school. As were most of the other students. They were valuable citizens and added to our school much in the way of academic standing and the Japanes boys were wonderful athletes and also added to our standing in all games except basketball. The war was a terrible thing in the California town I was in. All those American Japanese students sent away to camps...their parents farms and orchards confiscated and many never returned. It was devestating.faith\n\nBubble\n\nJohn Murphree\n\nBubble\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJohn Murphree\n\npatwest\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nJere Pennell\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJohn Murphree\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nI wonder if the tea trade was just another leg in the opium trade with China.

I wonder what they use now in guns? Shows how ignorant I am. But the needle was surely used before the 12th century? Why mention the first use of the needle by mariners? I don't understand, I would think that the needle was invented centuries before that and it would be normal that mariners would use it to make sails.\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nI knew there was something that I didn't get Mal. Thanks.\n\nJustin\n\nIf the south pointing needle came about in the 12th century BCE and the arabs also had the device at an early date, why not Europe until the early 16th century CE. That's a lapse of 2500 years. Columbus sailed with out benefit of south pointer. The device could have come to europe via the crusades but there does not seem to be any indication of that happening. Gun powder had no difficulty making the trip to europe. Why not the compass?\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nAre we talking about two different things here?

If the needle is an arrow the flow of magnetic properties may well be toward the nock rather than the head. The nock points north and the head points south. The direction of flow is the determining characteristic and not the shape of the needle or the arrow. Once the needle is magnetized it orients itself along the North-South axis and that is unrelated to the shape of the needle or the arrow.\n\nJere Pennell\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJere Pennell\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJere Pennell\n\nFaithr\n\nit sounds like religion to me. I think of Druids in Europe and England. I think of the Aztec's Sun Worship and Fertility Gods too. And all the American Native peoples for that matter. These things are the basis for all religion, and religion begins with the awe and wonder at the natural forces that really rule this planet then progress's to the magic then the mystical with all the trappings of \"real\" religion. Of course, in MHO. fr\n\nJustin\n\nJustin\n\nMal; You touched at the heart of a market economy. It is ability and the freedom to arrive at a mutually agreeable price that makes a market economy. Communism is far in the future and not very relevant in this context. The Chinese, today, have passed well beyond Communism and have adopted a form of dictatorial government unrelated to government ownership of the means of production. Price supports, subsidies, and tariffs encourage some industries but in the main, I think, people are generally able to bargain for goods and services. Someone who is closer to the Chinese economy than I am can probably say more about current business practices.\n\nJustin\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nNo Robby, she teaches her sons what he must learn in order to become the ruler of his kingdom and her daughters to accept that she will always play second fiddle to the man who will rule the world.\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJustin\n\nIMO people want happiness HERE, but few people think they are happy HERE so many accept the premise that happiness is posible in the HEREafter. However, folks generally tend to forget they are human and therefore will just naturally do things that St Peter won't like. There are only two ways to get the happiness ticket punched. One is by struggling to accomplish things that you consider worthwhile and to be content with the joy that activity brings. The other way is by making it posible for other people to find the joy of accomplishment. There is no benefit in looking elsewhere for happiness. It is HERE in this life and it is HERE one must seek it.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nI read S of C regularly, Durant has a thorough knowledge of history and writes in a most brilliant manner and I respect him for that, but I don't know what to say that can be of interest to the participants.\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nTejas\n\nElizabeth N\n\nPerhaps we should wait six months or so before we go on to the next volume. Robbie, Mal, Justin, Sea Bubble, Eloise and all of you, thank you so much for your efforts in this discussion. I come to your \"class\" each day with anticipation and leave bouyed to follow my day. My understanding of the world slowly increases under your tutelage.\n\nMaryPage\n\nJustin\n\nHere we are in a crisis caused by lack of active participants. We have reached 7000 postings in a fairly short time. We have struggled through ancient China and are now at the point in Chinese history where the west plays a part in it's development. Durant, covers the period from the introduction of the Portuguese in the 16th century to the Boxer Rebellion in the 20th century in a half dozen pages. He gives the western exploitation short shrift and so do we as we pull out of China before examining it's modern mix. That's a disappointment. We had more people in the middle eastern discussion because the topic is more topical. We can't expect broad participation in every aspect of the history of civilization. In some periods we will have four participants and in others we will have twenty. That's the nature of the beast. Do not be discouraged, Robbie. The group will increase in size when we go to Greece. But even then I do not expect large numbers of participants. How many people have read Bury, for example.\n\nMaryPage\n\nJustin\n\nThe Portuguese were rewarded by the Chinese Emperor in 1557 for help in defeating pirates. They received Macao as a gift and developed there opium factories which they used to supply opium to the Chinese. The revenues coming from the opium trade were so great that it attracted Britain,Spain, France, Japan, and the United States to the business. Spain took the Phillipines and Formosa to aid in its opium trade. Britain found Hong Kong. The Chinese government forbad the use of Opium by it's people. In 1838, the Chinese government tried to wipe out tthe trade. They seized and destroyed twenty thousand chests of the drug. The Brits went to war. Won it and cut down Chinese tariffs, Opened five treaty ports, and with the United States gained extra territorial rights. Again in 1856, an opium War broke out with the US, Britain, and FRance demanding legalization of opium. Again the Allies won and China opened ten new ports to foreign trade, legalized opium, agreed to pay an indemnity. Russia took Amur, the French took Indo China, Japan took Formosa and Korea. The Us took the Philippines from Spain to aid in the traffic with China. Franklin Roosevelt's grandaddy Delano was deeply involved in the early Opium trade. This was the kind of exploitation that took place and led to the Boxer Rebellion which was designed to drive out the \"foreign devils\".\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nJustin\n\nIn my view, the timing of our entrance into Greece depends more on you, Robbie than on the participants. You are the one who is constantly involved. We move in and out depending on availability. I know, you've been absent occasionally but in the main you are the one driving the vehicle. If you would like a hiatus of a week or more, fine. I am ready to continue when you say, \"go\". Stopping permanently is not an option for me.\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJere Pennell\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJere Pennell\n\nBubble\n\nJustin\n\nRobby: We are floundering. Your direction is needed. Are we going to by-pass the crest of the Chinese civilization? Are we going to enter Japan? Are we going straight to Greece? Which? Select the topic and we will proceed.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nMany signs of change were in China in 1935, when Durant last looked at the ancient giant. Thousands of Chinese youth had been trained in western colleges. Confucius was out and science was in. Mandarin dialect became the language of literature. The new China was listening with special eagerness to John Dewey and Bertram Russell, whose independence of all theology and respect for experience and experiment was the only logic. These changes were evident in spite of the obvious exhaustion of the peasants which caused one to wonder whether China could ever rise again. But under the surface Durant saw factors of convalesence and renewal. China had a great untapped resevoir of natural resources whose exploitation would bring China to leadership in a world of luxury. Now, seventy years later, we can see China still struggling to find it's destiny.\n\nMaryPage\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nTejas\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJere Pennell\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJere Pennell\n\nJere Pennell\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJustin\n\nDurant's introductory paragraph to the work on Japan is a masterpiece of Clairvoyance. After describing two stages in Japanese history, he proposes a third stage, called \"Modern\" in which the Japanese imitate the imperialistic ardor and methods of the West. The previously self contained Japan now seeking foreign materials (especially, oil),fights wars of irrepressible expansion and threatens both the ascendancy of the white race and the peace of the world. \"By every historical precedent, Durant says, the next act will be war\". This was said in 1935.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJustin\n\nSome interesting comparisons can be made between the Judaic creation and the Japanese creation. Both creations required the gods to bring it all about. The Judaic god did the complete job. He made the world.The process took six days and it was done with out the aid of any devices. The Japanese gods used intermediaries, a brother and a sister and a device called a spear. The islands were formed by drops of water from the spear. There were 4223 drops in all resulting in the formation of 4223 islands. There is no mention of time. The Japanese gods were not interested in doing the complete job. Creating Japan may have been the equivalent of creating the world. The Japanese were so isolated they may have thought they were alone in the world. Where did the people come from? They sprang from an incestuous relationship with the aid of tadpoles. The emperors came from the goddess of the sun who sprang from the left eye of the male half of the creation duo. In Japan tadpoles taught the art of copulation. In Judaic history a snake took care of the instruction. In Japan the gods created brother and sister to do the job. In Judaic history The god created Adam and Eve to do the job. Similarities in creation stories abound without apparent prior contact.\n\nOrchidLady\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJere Pennell\n\nmoxiect\n\nJustin\n\nWell, Robby, That's two more.

Land bridges existed at that time connecting The Asian Mainland with Japan. I see, looking at the map, that Iki and Tshushima are islands lying between Kyoto and Pusan. Pusan is about fifty miles distant and the two islands between are like stepping stones reducing the distance to gaps of five miles and ten miles apart. This area could have been the site of a land bridge. We know that rice cultivation spread from Korea. Perhaps other things as well. Perhaps, people mingled and acculturation led to the unique being we call Japanese.\n\nJustin\n\nMetal working and the pottery wheel also came to Japan from Korea and later after the Yamato family established the imperial seat, we find things like Buddhism coming across the Korean Channel. A 200 year mission to China brought governmental forms, Chinese art and architecture to Japan. I guess Japan was not as isolated as I had previously thought.\n\nJustin\n\nThe De Young Museum in San Francisco has just acquired Ainu ceremonial robes from the late 19th century. They are made of elm bark fiber and cotton into a plain weave with embroidery and applique.The motifs and design systems emphasize meanders and the interchange of positive and negative ground. The patterns are believed to hold magical and protective powers that ward off evil spirits. The physical features of the Ainu are very different from their mongoloid neighbors. They have long noses, deep set eyes, curley hair and beards. Their language is a linguistic isolate, much like Basque.Culturally the Ainu are a northern people who have close affinities with population groups from Siberia and North America.\n\nOrchidLady\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJustin\n\nLouise: The Japanese government seems to be supporting the Ainu museum in hopes of popularizing Ainu culture. However, I do not know about the acceptance of Ainu people by Japanese. I think they were confined to Hokaido so their aceptance was not a national concern. I think Jere might know something of their acceptance in Japanese society.\n\nJere Pennell\n\nJere Pennell\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nMaryPage\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMaryPage\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nmoxiect\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMaryPage\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJere Pennell\n\nJere Pennell\n\nBubble\n\nMaryPage\n\nJere Pennell\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nmssuzy\n\nThanks, Robert, this is interesting indeed. have the whole series of those books and have looked into several volumes, but not ancient Japan.

In europe the Catholic church made usury a sin and in so doing left the banking business to the Jews. They prospered but the restriction limited economic Growth in Europe. That does not appear to have happened in Japan. The money lenders belonged to the most powerful guild and the mercantile wealth of the nation grew. I suspect we will find that it was the money lenders who helped Peary open the Japanese economic world in 1856.\n\nJustin\n\nI am reading the section on \"People\" and must comment early. Among those who could afford it, clothes were changed three times a day and everyone bathed daily. This is in 1905. People in the US at this time were addicted to Saturday night baths, once per week. When I was a child, in the twenties, I had a bath once per week whether it was needed or not. I don't think American bathing habits changed until the second world war when showers became popular. In Japan people bathed in tubs outside their homes while gossiping with their neighbors. Americans do that today but tub bathing is recent innovation and only invited neighbors may participate. In Japan hot baths at 110 degrees were used to keep warm in winter. In the US, 104 degrees is the recommended temperature for fitness clubs. When my tub reaches 106 I am cooking and at 107 I must get out and fix the heater to prevent par boiling.\n\nJustin\n\nI know I am out in front of you, But I can't resist talking about the pleasures of warm sake. It is smooth and warms the tummy like no other liquor. It is easy to drink too much for each little cup is better than the last. I have been sipping sake for 60 years. It was the one nice thing the Japanese did for me during the war. My platoon liberated a storehouse full of it and we knew it would make a poor souvenir and in addition the poet Tahito declared way back in the seventh century that sake was the one solution for all the problems of life.\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJere Pennell\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nmoxiect\n\nJo70\n\nThere was a Will Durant that was chief of the Choctaw Indians.

New year practices in the US include some traditions that are not only worthless but also destructive. People have \"gone out on the town,\" drinking on New year's eve, as far back as I can remember. A few drive home, drunk, in the early hours, in reckless disregard for the lives of innocent people. It would be nice if we could find some worthwhile tradition that people could follow that would not require a mix of drinking and driving. Staying at home to watch a ball fall in Manhattan is not much of an entertainment. We need a way to celebrate that involves the family. When Mom and Dad go out on New Year's Eve, the kids are left with baby sitters and are left out of the celebration. Families in the US must try to find their own tradition for New Year's Eve and Day. The Japanese have a tradition that sounds admirable.

The priests know that too. So why all this fuss about victims and suffering years later. This one is really a conundrum. It must be a Christian thing. The men are sworn to be celibate but so too were Buddist monks. The Buddists reasoned that celibacy meant avoiding sex with women. Sex with males was considered ok. The Christians seem to interpret that to mean sex of any kind. Boy, that is a real challenge for any healthy person. Of course, in the US, pederasty is a crime but it was certainly not a crime in Japan where the Samurai practiced nonshuoku as a normal relationship. I wonder if Japanese society at that time would have frowned on sex with children of any age. In the US where the practice is a crime, we are concerned about children who can be hurt and in some cases raped and even killed.

In my judgement, the answer is \"Yes\". Of course, we will never know until we try a woman in the office. There have been several examples in recent years of women in the top job. Golda Mier, Indira Ghandi, and Margaret Thatcher come to mind- all successful leaders. There are several strong candidates among US women today and I for one would like to try a gal in the job before I am planted. Further, I have hopes that such an election would embarrass Islam and Fundemental christianity into recognizing that women have value beyond washing dishes and raising children. Further, such an election would serve notice that a woman is not an object that may be possessed. Women may be loved and treasured but not owned and they deserve the right to be all they can be in life. In the US, Abigail Adams told her husband when he was working on the constitution, \" Don't forget the ladies.\" He did forget and it was not till the suffrage adoption in 1920 that women got the chance to show what they can do.

Japan had always been feudal in social structure with a Shogun at the top of the pecking order. A divine emperor existed but his power was minimized. In the 1840's the Shogun government was reformed. In the late 1850's Commodore Perry forced Yokohama, open to trade. The influence of the US and European nations entered Japan and thing began to change significantly. By the late 1860's the Shogunate had been overthrown and the country westernized by imitation. The teaching of Confucius was less influential in the schools and topics became more relevant to life. Among the many things Japan copied from the west was a tendency toward empire building. This was the beginning of a national attitude that led Japan to war with Russia, and with China, and eventually to war with the US.\n\nOrchidLady\n\nJustin\n\nI have no wish to prolong this discussion but do wish to add a thought.

There is a fine example in this morning's paper. Will Bagley, who writes a history column for one of the local papers, wrote a book charging Brigham Young with responsility for the murder of 120 California-bound pioneers on September 11, 1857. The church's chief official historian denies Young's culpability and promises to write a book chronicling his version of the massacre. Since 17 children were spared in the slaughter in which 70 children died, it is to be expected that their grands and great grands will spawn another version of the tale. It is these conflicting versions of an event as well as biography, news coverage,witnesses, and artifacts that enable the unbiased historian to to leave posterity with an opinion.\n\nMaryPage\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJustin\n\nAfter examining China and it's exploitation by the west, and it's resistance to western culture (with the possible exception of the Treaty Ports), I was amazed by the rapidity with which Japan adopted western ideas as well as Chinese ideas. Beginning in 1870, feudalism comes to an end. The Shogunate loses power and the sainted emperor takes over. Further, those at the bottom of society, the merchants, find themselves further up the pecking chain. Japan quickly learned the lessons of the western exploiter, found gadgets useful,changed its dress, modernized it's school system, modernized it's army and navy, and made use of its power by defeating Russia, and capturing a piece of China. It is most remarkable to me that Japan could have remained isolated for so long resisting the invasive powers of the west with religion at the head of the spear.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJere Pennell\n\nJere Pennell\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJere Pennell\n\nmoxiect\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElizabeth N\n\nMoxiect says deep-rooted ideas pass down the generations: We read here that the ancient Japanese put great importance on correct costuming--from the pictures Mal found for us it seems a valid art form--so perhaps today that inheritance is working and what is seen on American tv is embraced as the modern, absolutely perfect style.

It extends all the way from Manet to Van Gogh- from the Independents to the Post Impressionists. In the 1850's a little volume of Hokusai was found on paper that had been used to pack china and in 1862 La Porte Chinoise was opened as an oriental shop in the Rivoli Arcade by French people who had lived in Japan. The shop was frequented by Manet, Fantin, Tissot, Degas, Whistler, and Baudelaire who were impressed with things oriental. In 1867, I think, the Worlds Fair opened with a showing of Japanese prints.\n\nwinsum\n\nlots here I don't know..I seem to remember that the distancers weere not indicated by our rules of perspective, but more like the size? of objects??? just a faint recollection. anyhow no vanishing jpoints.\n\nJere Pennell\n\nJustin\n\nJapanese things- fans, prints, robes,and other objects found their way into French painting from about 1860 on. Manet painted a portrait of Emil Zola with two Japanese prints showing on the table. Van Gogh in 1887 painted Pere Tanguy with several Japanese prints on the wall behind the subject. Degas painted a portrait of Tissot with Japanese prints on the wall behind the subject. Of course these were not the only use to which Japanese prints were put by the Impressionist painters. Black and white in contrast and shades of gray were prominant in Japanese prints. Black was used to outline edges- to harden edges. Whistler became so interested in black as a subject he painted a \"study in Gray scale\" which we renamed \"Whistler's Mother\".Whistler's painting of the Bridge is also in gray scale. Both are rooted in Japanese prints. Degas also focused on black in some of his portraits. Manet used black outlining to establish hard edges- a direct derivative from the Japanese.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nJere Pennell\n\nJere Pennell\n\nwinsum\n\nuh huh. apples aren't oranges and men arn't women and days aren't nights endlessly. we can't use generalities except very loosely to describe anything much. . . . even races although they seem to be defined by certain physical characterisations cna't be described generally.

Now we are about to have a religious war-the Fundementalist Christians vrs the Fundementalist Islamists, with Falwell, Grahamm, Robertson, and Dobson cheering from the sidelines. We can't possibly be this ignorant. Can we? Did we inherit this behavior too from the Orient?\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nMaryPage\n\nJustin\n\nMal; Lets hope so.\n\nHubertPaul\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nOrchidLady\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJustin\n\nI will use the seventh element to say thanks to Robby for a pleasant learning experience.\n\nBubble\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nJustin\n\nEloise: Your chance of making anyone angry by expressing yourself openly is less than one in a billion. Perhaps the opposite is more the case. If you don't express yourself openly, we will be angry. You refer to 9/11 as September Nine. That's understandable since French Canadians refer to dates in the European manner. In the US we write the month first and the day next. In your part of the world you write the day first and the month next. One gets November ninth for 9/11 using that method.

There is a standing nude sculpture in wood (2321 BCE) from the Old Kingdom,a standing Sesostris lll, from the Middle Kingdom, and a great many pieces from the New Kingdom. You will remember that the New Kingdom included the powerful Thutmose lll,Akhenaten the Heretic, and Tutankamon. In addition there are pieces from the Rameside period, the Hyksos period, and a few encaustic portraits from the Roman 2nd century. If you are near San Francisco you should try to see the collection. It is well worth your time. The collection moves on in late November to Minneapolis, then Chicago and finally Baltimore before returning to Britain in January 2004.\n\nmoxiect\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\ndapphne\n\nI will be following this \"Life Of Greece\" discussion......\n\nBubble\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nMarvelle\n\nMalryn (Mal)\n\nElizabeth N\n\nI will be following \"The Life of Greece\" discussion.\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nNorth Star\n\nI'm going to try to keep up with the discussion on Greece.

In the Religious Issues, we just had a go at roots of modern religions and turned up some really interesting stuff on the Canaanites, Eyptians, Sumerians and Zoroastrians. We didn't have a nice, fair moderator like Robbie so it was no holds barred.

One event was Hearst (of Hearst Castle) passing money (probably gold) in a leather satchel to a steel manufacturer who did work for Mussolini who in turn arranged for a di Vinci and a Michael Angelo to be smuggled into this country. The story was that M. needed the money for his army. The movie is called The Cradle Will Rock and is very much like a documentary. The credits say it was even edited on \"old machines,\" and it is stuffed with wonderful actors. In the art world, is it thought to be true that Mussolini sold some of Italy's treasures?\n\nJustin\n\nYes, many Italian owned art works were sold to Hearst during the thirties usually with the aid of Berenson who was a resident of Florence. He recomended and was the consulting art agent for many art deals with US citizens and American Museums. He operated until War broke out, lived in Italy under the Nazis, and arranged many deals after the war. I am not aware specifically of a Leonardo or a Michelangelo that came to this country during that period. There are so few Leonardos that are transportable and the same is true for the Michelangelos-some cartoons, perhaps. Of course we would expect that these would appear in the Hearst catalogue.\n\nJustin\n\nYes, many deals were made by American citizens and museums for the sale of Italian owned art during the thirties, usually with the aid of Bernard Berenson who lived in Florence before, during and after the War. I don't know specifically, about the Leonardo and the Michelangelo you mention, however, it is doubtful because there are so few pieces of art by these artists that are transportable- cartoons perhaps, maybe sketches. In any case, the works would show up in the Hearst catalogue and in the catalogues for these artists.\n\nJustin\n\nAAlice: Congratulations. We may be old but we're not asleep, are we? We can still learn. We are proud of you. What do you think of the \"Documentary\" Elizabeth mentioned? I wonder about Leonardo's \"notebooks and models\" that have been kicking around the US for some time. There were some sketches for St. Anne cartoons rumored to have come in a strange way but I think they were fakes. Perhaps, Elizabeth can tell us more about the pieces in the story. Tales like these abound and they are always fun to follow-up.\n\nFaithr\n\nElizabeth N\n\nI did not recognize the paintings shown in the movie, but I will take closer note when I see it again so I can perhaps describe them.\n\nAAlice\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nBubble\n\nElizabeth N\n\nElizabeth N\n\nI cannot find the meaning of the word envoi--\"Do you mean envoy?\" I have been asked twice.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nElizabeth N\n\nGood word.\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nÉloïse De Pelteau\n\nLady C\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nFifi le Beau\n\nrobert b. iadeluca\n\nAlki\n\nI'll join in too, in between other activities.
