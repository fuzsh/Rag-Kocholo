        "text": "Citation preview\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto The Industrial Exhibition and the Shaping of a Late Victorian Culture North American cities of the late nineteenth century, grappling with the effects of industrial capitalism and urban growth, were subject to a succession of massive social transformations. Scientific and technological advances were shifting the balance of cosmopolitan power, and people faced the challenge of comprehending and adapting to the rapidly changing social environment. In Becoming Modern in Toronto, Keith Walden shows how the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, from its founding, in 1879, to 1903 (when it was renamed the Canadian National Exhibition), influenced the shaping and ordering of the emerging urban culture. Unlike other studies of its kind, it fully integrates experiences on and off the fairground by viewing the fair as a microcosm of developing structures in the city and surrounding rural areas. The book is arranged around seven thematic elements - order, confidence, display, identity, space, entertainment, and carnival - each of which concerns the way the Exhibition contributed to a search for definition in the face of innovation. The efforts to divide existence into logical, unambiguous categories and to promote controlled conduct was, however, constantly frustrated by the novelty of the fair itself. The Exhibition presented fairgoers with new perspectives and information, while the exhibits simultaneously denied and invited their participation. Though the fair seemed to glorify professional accomplishments and legitimate elite leadership, it also implied that the fruits of industrial capitalist society were not exclusive. Walden concentrates on these ambiguities, revealing how the status quo was both confirmed and challenged at the fair. Becoming Modern in Toronto takes into account a variety of social tensions and concerns that pervaded late Victorian culture. It will be compelling reading for historians, sociologists, and cultural anthropologists, as well as for those interested in the symbolic and social meaning of public festivity and its regulation. KEITH WALDEN is a professor of history at Trent University, and the author of a cultural history of the Canadian Mounties.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nKEITH WALDEN\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto The Industrial Exhibition and the Shaping of a Late Victorian Culture\n\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PRESS Toronto Buffalo London\n\nwww.utppublishing.com University of Toronto Press Incorporated 1997 Toronto Buffalo London Printed in Canada ISBN 0-8020-0885-2 (cloth) ISBN 0-8020-7870-2 (paper)\n\nPrinted on acid-free paper\n\nCanadian Cataloguing in Publication Data Walden, Keith, 1948Becoming Modern in Toronto : the Industrial Exhibition and the shaping of a late Victorian culture Includes index.

After this first quarter century, the fair became known as the Canadian National Exhibition.1 The name change represented neither a sudden metamorphosis in the character of the show nor a formal expansion of status, but simply the ambitions of organizers and the fact that no other fair in the country was big enough to challenge the claim. Despite its original title, the exhibition was never just a showcase for manufactured products. Industry was meant in the broad sense of 'useful effort.' Agriculture and the fine arts shared the pedestal, though the latter was much the weakest sister. As well, like most fairs, this one was an occasion for many sorts of commercial activities, leisure entertainments, and socializing. It was not the only fair in nineteenth-century Ontario, but it was the largest, bringing together a broad segment of the population from Toronto and the surrounding areas. For farm people, it was something of a harvest festival. For the city's elite, it marked the end of summer, cushioning regrets at leaving cottages and resorts. For ordinary urban folk, it offered a regular injection of excitement, exotic novelty, and sometimes inconvenience to punctuate the tedium of routine. By any measure, the fair was a distinct and important component of life in Toronto. To approach the exhibition from the perspective of cultural history requires some brief comment. The study of culture has evolved substantially in the last few years. Long ago, the narrow focus on great artists and thinkers, and their influence, was supplemented by more-embracing anthropological notions that understood culture to include everything people do and think. Their relationships, activi-\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nties, and world views became targets of investigation, not simply their concrete productions; any human creation was relevant, not just those accorded high prestige; all individuals and groups were significant, not just the most technologically and artistically developed. For scholars beyond anthropology, this broadened conception stimulated investigations of marginalized groups and mass pastimes, legitimizing the study of such things as Native culture, Black culture, working-class culture, and popular culture.2 Until recently, most analyses dealt with the structure of social organizations or the content of beliefs. Now, this approach has begun to be complemented by more interest in how meaning is constructed through active human practices. Growing concern with different forms of cultural domination has directed more attention to dynamic processes rather than static elements.3 Indeed, structures themselves seem to be merely convenient shorthand for never-ending interactions. Content is unceasingly negotiated. Even language has become destabilized as deconstructionists like Jacques Derrida have undermined presumptions that precise vocabulary can lay bare fixed qualities about the world. Naming, it now seems, is always provisional and contingent.4 For many investigators, then, discovering how meaning is debated and disseminated, rather than uncovering any specific meaning, has become primary. Historians have not been immune to this development. From various quarters, calls have been sounded to pay more attention to the processes of representation. The project of cultural history,' says Catherine Belsey, 'is to identify the meanings in circulation in earlier periods, to specify the discourses, conventions and signifying practices by which meanings are fixed, norms \"agreed\" and truth defined.' The most pressing question in cultural history today, argues Roger Chartier, 'is that of the different ways in which groups or individuals make use of, interpret, and appropriate the intellectual motifs or cultural forms they share with others.'5 By taking the construction, propagation, and contestation of meaning as its major focus, cultural history has suddenly moved from the sidelines to the forefront of historical writing. As Richard Fox and Jackson Lears noted in the introduction to a recent collection of essays on cultural themes in American history, the higher profile is due partly to a broadened definition that includes many analyses formerly slotted as 'social' and 'intellectual,' but it also reflects the impact of postmodern sensibilities. Cultural history, they suggest, 'is the rubric under\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nwhich a massive doubting and refiguring of our most cherished historical assumptions is being conducted.'6 As an effort to respond to these challenges, this book is an exercise in what Lynn Hunt has labelled 'new cultural history.' Although this approach, she suggests, has no rigid methodology or model, it is characterized by a tendency to apply insights from anthropology, cultural studies, and linguistic theory to close examinations of localized social productions and activities.7 This study conforms to that description. My intent has not been to survey the contents of the fair for their own sake. I have not paid much attention to the exhibition's beginnings or administrative development. I have not tried to catalogue every feature offered up for edification and enjoyment. Rather, I have tried to explore how, once established, the exhibition helped shape understandings in a society being altered profoundly by industrial capitalist production, technological developments, and new ideas and values, including consumerism. This is not a history of an institution, but an attempt to understand how certain cultural dispositions formed around an institution. The 'Ex' has long been recognized as one of Toronto's primary attractions. Celebratory volumes have appeared at regular intervals,8 but there has been no detailed assessment of its impact. This imbalance is not unusual. Considering the prevalence of modern local fairs, the absence of scholarly investigations of them is surprising. Popular histories abound; sustained, critical studies are scarce. There are exceptions. Sally Alexander's short pamphlet The St. Giles Fair, 1830-1914 is very suggestive about the evolution and social meaning of entertainments at an Oxford event. Anne Lincoln Fitzpatrick, in The Great Russian Fair, is mainly interested in the market at Nizhnii Novgorod as a case-study of commercial modernization in the nineteenth century, but she does pay considerable attention to the disruption it created.9 Closer to home, Wayne Neeley's The Agricultural Fair, now more than half a century old, is still the only broad survey of American institutions that, he claims, were important agents of socialization. Ted Ownby, in Subduing Satan, suggests that turn-of-the-century fairs in the American south were instruments of modernization and centralization, breaking down rural isolation, broadcasting evangelical moral and domestic ideals, and, via the midway, introducing a version of urban decadence. In tracing the evolution of the Iowa\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nState Fair, Chris Rasmussen pays particular attention to the tension between amusement and instructive features. As befits a historian of material culture, Karal Ann Marling approached the Minnesota State Fair like an artifact, trying to understand 'the ways in which a culture sees and what it chooses to observe.' The survey of activities lends itself to an extensive use of photographs, but her sophisticated appreciation of the nuances of the fair experience makes this much more than a coffee-table book for aficionados. Even if studies of fairs abounded, this would be a useful one.10 In the Canadian context, David Jones's insightful Midways, Judges and Sharp-Tongued Fakirs emphasizes the desire to use western Canadian fairs in the Progressive era to promote economic development and community life. Elsbeth Heaman's recent PhD thesis on central Canadian fairs and Canadian displays at international exhibitions in the nineteenth century takes a broad look at their role in economic development and in the creation of a public sphere. Elwood Jones's Winners: 150 Years of the Peterborough Exhibition, on the other hand, provides a more focused depiction of how a specific show became more urban, more commercial, and more formulaic in its attractions.11 Compared with the paucity of materials on local events, the secondary literature on world exhibitions is positively voluminous. Robert Rydell's historiographical essay in The Books of the Fairs documents its broad range of themes. Singly or together, expositions have been looked at in relation to such themes as nationalism, international peace, trade, women's participation, popular culture, art, architecture, and technology. At present, interest is especially keen in their use as justifications of imperialism and racism, in their role in reorganizing society around capitalist production and mass consumption, and, as a corollary, their influence on the development of museums, department stores, and other institutions of modern industrial society. There is no need to duplicate here this exhaustive review.12 American cultural historian Neil Harris has divided recent works into two basic categories. The nostalgic school of'urban sentimentalism' revels in the decorative exuberance of these events and emphasizes their aspirations for human progress. The 'revisionist' school strips away benign facades to find not idealizations of harmony and abundance, but revelations of unequal distribution of wealth and power; not innocent entertainments, but ideological weapons to\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nimpress particular world views.13 My own slant on this material is not dissimilar. For me, the key distinction is whether these events are seen as mirroring or as moulding culture. The line is not hard and fast, but individual analyses have tended to lean heavily towards one side or the other. The 'snap-shot approach,' as the former might be termed, is implicit in older studies in which culture is viewed as finished artifacts, and has been used more recently by historians seeking concrete markers for phenomena not easily pinned to conventional political chronology. Exhibitions represent dense nodes where complexly interwoven currents can be dissected. Thomas Schlereth uses the American fairs of 1876, 1893, and 1915 as time-specific anchors for discussions of broad aspects of everyday Victorian life. Deborah Silverman suggests that the Paris show of 1889 'crystallized' the confrontation between advanced technological structures and bourgeois liberalism stemming from the Enlightenment. These authors do not necessarily believe that the effect of expositions was entirely passive, but this impression is a by-product of the way they have made use of them.14 For some scholars, however, freezing time is not simply a convenient analytical tool but the whole point of the actual shows. Reid Badger's explicit goal in studying the Columbian Exposition was to determine what light it shed on the overall psychological or emotional condition of American society in the 1890s. He concludes that it had 'far greater significance as a reflector of the general culture than as an influence upon it.' Robert Muccigrosso's centenary reexamination of the same event acknowledges that the show led to new directions in architecture, design, and social reform, but maintains it was more fundamentally 'an expression of what Americans had accomplished, were accomplishing and promised to accomplish.' Dwelling on those accomplishments allows him to downplay allegations of 'racism, class and gender domination, social control and cultural regression' that, to him, 'ring hollow.'15 The second approach is less interested in defining the character of specific eras than in understanding how and why exhibitions were used to shape attitudes in and towards industrial capitalist society. For Alan Trachtenberg, the 1893 extravaganza was a ruling-class device to 'win hegemony over the emerging national culture.' The White City was intended to show how places like Chicago might look and be governed, and to prove that business, political, and cultural\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nelites knew how to fashion a modern industrial society better than workers, farmers, women, and immigrants did. For Paul Greenhalgh, the great expositions were the principal means by which governments and private bodies presented their visions of the world to the masses. They were instruments to define national identity, marshall support for imperialist policies, and persuade ordinary folk that the harshness of life was being dispelled. To Burton Benedict, fairs were sites where those with power and those reaching for it competed for ascendancy and legitimized their social dominance. They were display cases to sell both ideas and mass-produced goods. Industrial products on view did not merely cater to middle-class taste but helped to form and validate that taste. People were taught what to buy and how those purchases defined their social niche. According to Robert Rydell, in the period up to the First World War, exhibitions were used to make the social world comprehensible and to organize the direction of society from a class perspective. Fairs, he says, were triumphs of hegemony that deeply influenced many individual and collective beliefs, particularly with respect to ideas about race and progress. In a more recent book, he characterizes depression-era fairs as exercises in 'cultural and ideological repair work,' representing 'a drive to modernize America by making it an ever more perfect realization of an imperial dream of world abundance, consumption, and social hierarchy based on the reproduction of existing power relations premised on categories of race and gender.' Neil Harris is probably the most positive of those in this stream, pointing out that fairs improved the status of local institutions, contributed to the beautification of urban landscapes, helped identify new local leadership, stimulated support for local improvements, and generally legitimized the urban idea. However, he too acknowledges that they reinforced prevailing notions of cultural hierarchy, generated class and ethnic tensions, and became giant advertising organs.16 Notwithstanding their different shades of emphasis and angles of approach, all these works in the second stream hook into the same complex of assumptions: fairs were instruments of hegemony, used by elites to generate support for a culture dominated by white, male, middle-class values, and organized increasingly around capitalist production and the possibilities of consumption thus provided. In fostering and reinforcing hierarchies of taste, gender, and race, they shaped class identities, social spaces, and public policies. This book shares these premises. What can it contribute that is new?\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nFirst, it is focused on an annual fair, a relatively neglected kind of event, qualitatively different in some ways from world's fairs. Although it resembled these prestigious but short-term shows in many ways, and wished the similarities were greater, the Toronto Industrial Exhibition was more local, more firmly integrated into yearly routine, more concerned with corporate than national identities, more oriented to immediate commerce than encyclopedic presentations of human accomplishments, and more devoted to readily available and mass-produced commodities than to exotic products from distant lands. Though annual fairs may not have admitted as many people in any given year as world expositions, it is arguable that they had a greater impact on visitors, who often returned time and again. The opportunities for moulding were more sustained. There is little point, however, in trying to measure degrees of influence. What is obvious is that the Industrial Exhibition, and other annual fairs like it, were significant institutions, highly successful over a long period, and deeply connected to the emergence of an urban, industrial, consumer society. They deserve more notice. Second, this study attempts to integrate more fully experiences that occurred both on and off the fairground. Most analyses of exhibitions and local fairs view them as self-contained, almost insulated, environments. The Columbian Exposition, says Trachtenberg, set itself off against what lay beyond its gates. It enforced its lessons by contrast. World's fairs, according to Benedict, built idealized cities within their walls. His gaze on these fantasy environments is directed internally. Even James Gilbert's Perfect Cities, which draws attention to other Utopian presentations in Chicago outside the fairground - the experimental community of Pullman and the 'evangelical metropolis' conjured by Dwight Moody's revival - treats them as coexistent but discrete realms. It is not clear how they intersected in individuals' consciousness or experience.17 What has to be remembered is that the fair represented a time as well as a space. For out-of-towners, the show itself was only one part of a total experience. What happened in a hotel or a store could be just as significant as what happened within the gates; who was encountered on the street could be just as memorable as who was noticed in a pavilion or sideshow. For city residents, as well, fairtime was different from the rest of the year. Even those who chose to abstain from the actual event had trouble ignoring crowds and the\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nconditions they created. This study, then, assumes that understanding the impact of the Industrial Exhibition requires consideration of what was happening in Toronto as a whole. Third, following from a focus that is external as well as internal, this analysis tries to comprehend more broadly how the fair experience shaped understandings of modern urban culture. Unlike previous works that have attempted to document the effect of exhibitions on popular perceptions, this one does not deal only with deliberate messages intended by formal displays but, rather, tries to show how these messages intersected and competed with others, inside and outside the grounds, that were contradictory and subversive. The analytical scaffolding used to explore meaning is ritual. Other scholars have also noticed the applicability of this concept to exhibitions. Warren Susman argued that fairs served as rites of passage for American society, generating acceptance of new technologies, new possibilities of consumption, and large capitalist organizations. Burton Benedict described world's fairs as 'a series of mammoth rituals' in which all sorts of power relations were expressed. Rydell suggested that fairs provided 'symbolic universes' which 'ritualistically affirmed fairgoers' faith in American institutions and social organization, evoked a community of shared experience, and formulated responses to questions about the ultimate destiny of mankind in general and Americans in particular.'18 For all these authors, rituals are understood as consistent statements or ceremonies that coherently express the values of those who direct them. My notion of ritual, derived from anthropologist Victor Turner's concept of liminality and from Peter Stallybrass and Allon White's discussion of transgression, refers to situations when ordinary structures are dissolved and cultural elements are allowed to interact and combine in ways normally prohibited. Fairs were useful for exploring the meaning of modern urban society not because they were thoroughly stable, but because they were in some ways highly unstable, and so allowed exceptional perspectives. It is all very well to investigate the creation of meaning, but this presupposes some way of determining exactly what elements of culture are worthy of scrutiny. In the recent past, much debate has centred around Robert Darnton's analysis of the 'Great Cat Massacre' in eighteenth-century Paris. Darnton described how a group of printers' apprentices and journeymen expressed dissatisfaction with condi-\n\nPreface\n\nxvii\n\ntions in their own workplace and with decreasing opportunities for advancement within their trade by subjecting neighbourhood felines to mock trials and executions.19 As a number of critics have pointed out, by assuming that symbolic forms have transparent meanings, Darnton felt free to assign a greater measure of importance to some actions and metaphors than to others.20 His criteria for deciding what was worthy of notice and what was not lay beyond the text and was ultimately subjective.211 acknowledge the same flaw. My themes, and the examples used to support them, are not the only ones that could have been selected. I have no hesitation in arguing the significance of these choices, but I do not pretend to have used any scientific or objective method in isolating them. My experience of the Victorian fair probably duplicated that of many contemporary visitors who discovered too much going on to assimilate it all, even with repeated trips. Forced to be discriminating, I lingered in the places that most aroused my own curiosity. I spent much more time in the Crystal Palace than in Machinery Hall, was more intrigued by the midway than the animal barns, found more to contemplate in the crowd than on the walls of the Art Gallery. Others, with different priorities, will think I missed the most important parts. They will have to make their own excursions.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis book has taken a long time to materialize, and many debts have been incurred in the process. It has been published with the help of a grant from the Humanities and Social Sciences Federation of Canada, using funds provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Earlier, the research was facilitated by grants from the Trent University Committee on Research and from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. I am grateful to all these bodies, and to the people of Canada whose taxes were the ultimate source of these monies. The staffs of the Metropolitan Toronto Reference Library, City of Toronto Archives, Metropolitan Toronto Police Archives, National Archives of Canada, Archives of Ontario (particularly Carolyn Heald and Leon Warmsky), and Robarts Library at the University of Toronto were unfailingly helpful. At the latter institution, Judy Young Chong, Joan Links, Iqbal Wagle, and Mary Ann Wilson in the Microtext Department merit special thanks for their courtesies over a protracted period and for helping so often to get the microfilm copier into better focus. I am deeply grateful to Linda Cobon at the Canadian National Exhibition Archives. Since most of the nineteenth-century records of the fair have long since disappeared, that repository had much less material than I anticipated, but Linda was always considerate in making available the sources that did exist and, later, in arranging for photographic reproductions. Other individuals also contributed in specific ways that deserve mention. Joe Muldoon, of the Trent University Office of Research and Graduate Studies, did much to ensure the success of my SSHRC application. With insight and enthusiasm, Liz Wilton, my research\n\nxx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nassistant, scoured small-town Ontario papers for references to the exhibition. Peter Bailey first drew my attention to Stallybrass and White's The Politics and Poetics of Transgression, a book that became critical to the analysis that follows. Elsbeth Heaman generously shared many useful leads to studies about exhibitions and exhibiting and allowed me to read her recently completed PhD thesis on nineteenth-century central Canadian fairs. Joan Sangster read an earlier draft of chapter 3, while another colleague, Doug McCalla, commented with great tact and charity on a longer and more tedious version of the introduction. Pam Johnson forsook valuable bicycling time to read a number of chapters at early stages; her interest was much appreciated and her encouragement greatly sustaining. At the University of Toronto Press, it has been a pleasure to work with Gerry Hallowell, Emily Andrew, Karen Boersma, and Darlene Zeleney, and a privilege to have Rosemary Shipton as copy editor. Many people helped in ways that were less direct but no less significant. For accommodation, hospitality, comfort, advice, intellectual stimulation, and other forms of support, I especially would like to thank Holly Benson, David Churchill, Ken Dewar, Bob Gerein, Carol Gerein, Margaret Hobbs, Colin Howell, Peter James, Pam Johnson, Laura Macleod, Doug McCalla, Alison Melville, David Monod, Tamara Myers, Diana Pederson, Joan Sangster, Colin Savage, Donald Smith, Eleanor Walden, and Liz Wilton. George Rawlyk, the first person to read the entire manuscript, died while it was in final preparation. He had previously commented on early drafts of several separate chapters, so the bound version bears the firm imprint of his astute critical eye. I had looked forward to a time when I could offer some small token of appreciation for his unstinting support by presenting him with a copy of the book. Not being able to enjoy that moment has detracted significantly from the satisfaction at completing the project. George was a good friend, and I miss him very much.\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn 2 September 1892 Hannah Heron was struck by one of Toronto's new electric trolleys in a downtown residential neighbourhood. The sixty-one-year-old woman from Scarborough, at the city's eastern edge, had been staying with an aunt. Shortly before 3 p.m. she was being escorted to the Church Street car by her host's companion, who saw the trolley approaching. As they stood on the northeast corner of the intersection, Heron was told she had to board at the southwest. She raced into the street, intending to cross diagonally. Recognizing the danger she was in, the driver rang a warning bell, but the noise disoriented her. She stopped in the middle of the street. Too late to brake now, the motorman started to shout, increasing her bewilderment. Finally, she darted in front of the car, which knocked her down and passed over both her legs below the knee. She was carried back to her aunt's house, where she died five hours later. An inquest held the next day revealed that the two motormen were almost as unfamiliar with the capabilities of the modern trolley as Heron was. The cars had been introduced to Toronto less than three weeks before, and workers were being trained during regular service. The actual driver, with only one day's experience on the vehicle, was under instruction from the other, who himself had yet to pass an examination for competency. Neither had read the manual outlining operating instructions, though one had had it read to him. They were unsure of the speed of the car, of the most effective braking techniques, of stopping distances once the brakes were applied, and of official procedures for emergency situations. They and the victim were assigned equal blame for the tragedy,1 which was soon forgotten as the city went on adapting to the tumultuous transformations\n\n4\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nof the late nineteenth century. However, for those involved, the incident was a sobering example of the problem of meaning in a dynamic society. This book is about that problem. The extent of change in the late Victorian Western world was staggering. None of it materialized abruptly out of thin air, nor was there any dramatic turning-point that marked the arrival of modernity, but by the closing years of the century even those most insulated from overt effects and most determined to resist intrusions could sense that Western society was shifting its axis. Cities grew inexorably; powerful new business organizations announced their presence with high-rise office towers and sprawling factories; bureaucratic centralization and regulation became more pronounced; migrations from distant parts of the globe snowballed; medical breakthroughs abounded; scientific discoveries spawned startling new theories; and bicycles, automobiles, dry-process photographs, halftones, movies, tractors, electric lights, typewriters, telephones, and other marvels of technological sophistication appeared with dizzying regularity. The list could be extended for pages and still not begin to capture the full effect of the innovations. The world seemed to have speeded up, to have become more complex. Change itself was in the saddle. Nothing, it seemed, was immutable. As so much gave way, as so much was pushed together, people were required to re-establish the comprehensibility of their physical and intellectual environments. The necessity was obvious, though precise meanings to be ascribed were not. Meaning is never self-evident. Nothing in the world is straightforwardly 'given.' Human beings create reality by interpreting and relating some elements of a universe whose totality can never be completely comprehended. How they make sense of existence invariably reflects where they are situated within a given social structure and historical continuum. What is designated as 'natural' or 'true' varies considerably - across cultures, within a specific culture over time, and within a specific culture at any given moment.2 Meaning is established through hierarchies of value that are complex and fluid. Language in itself is inherently incapable of pinning down reality.3 What is understood as *high' has significance only in relation to what is considered 'low.' What is 'big* or 'fast' depends fundamentally on what is simultaneously perceived as 'small' or 'slow.' These spectrums are never completely separate, discrete categories. According to Peter Stallybrass and Allon White, the 'fundamental\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nbasis to mechanisms of ordering and sense-making in European cultures' is the intersections of high/low oppositions in four main symbolic domains - the human body, social order, geographical space, and psychic forms: 'Divisions and discriminations in one domain are continually structured, legitimated and dissolved by reference to the vertical symbolic hierarchy which operates in the other three domains. Cultures \"think themselves\" in the most immediate and affective ways through the combined symbolisms of these four hierarchies.'4 Change in one category has consequences for all the others. Not only is the entwining of scales conducive to infinite permutations and combinations, but rankings on any given spectrum are affected by a wide assortment of factors, including race, class, gender, and age, to mention just some of the most obvious. Meaning, consequently, is always contested. It is continually debated by different groups and individuals, each attempting to assert its own understandings, derived from its own assessments of interests. Not all versions of reality have the same authority or are propagated as widely. These cultural productions are regulated by the same relations of power that govern all social interactions, though the ability to influence meaning is not just a straightforward reflection of wealth or numbers: marginal groups can sometimes exert disproportionate influence, at least in some fields. Those disadvantaged by a particular sort of interpretation, however, resist to whatever extent, in whatever ways, they can. Often, enough overlap and intersection exist to allow some more commonly accepted version of reality to emerge, but rankings and connections are constantly negotiated and refigured in the context of specific circumstances. Meaning is always rooted in concrete situations, is generated at all social levels, and invariably remains unstable. When Hannah Heron stepped into the middle of Church Street, she was articulating a particular understanding of what a Toronto roadway meant - of the nature of the vehicles likely to be encountered there, of the dangers that needed to be considered, of appropriate ways of moving through that space, of the status of a human body relative to all these things. Unfortunately, her understanding, based on past experience, was contested by the street railway company, a much more powerful entity, which wanted to run cars at speeds faster than had been possible with horse-drawn wagons. By changing just one element in the situation, the entire web of signification had to be reknit. Whether individuals or trolleys should have precedence,\n\n6\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nwho was responsible for regulating encounters, what space should be occupied by pedestrians - such questions, which went to the heart of the meaning of the street, bodies, machines, and citizenship, all had to be renegotiated because hierarchies of speed and power had changed.5 The effort to communicate by both parties in this confrontation was intense, yet the gap between what each was trying to say through bells, shouts, or expressions of abject terror - and what actually came out was, to risk a pun, striking. Nor was the significance of the encounter fully understandable without precise knowledge of who had been hit, who had charge of the car, where and how the accident occurred, and so on. A different configuration of bodies, locations, and movements would have produced a very different message - as another incident, just three days after Heron's death, confirmed. Harris Weise from Orangeville, fifty miles to the northwest, was almost run over in downtown Toronto by an electric tram. He ran into the roadway to catch a horsedrawn car, oblivious to a trolley coming from the other direction until he was standing on the track. He dived headfirst out of the way onto a pile of mud, gathered himself up, and 'guessed' he would walk to the exhibition grounds.6 Both encounters pointed up public inexperience with streetcars and the consequent dangers, yet their social meanings varied profoundly. An energetic male was judged differently from an elderly female. A rustic tourist was not the same as the close relative of an affluent city resident. Mortification did not call for the same response as mortality. As examples of contestations, these run-ins between citizens and streetcars were all too concrete, but they demonstrate how, as old formulations began to corrode, as new technology began to appear, as industrial capitalism reshaped structures and expectations of modern existence, the problem of meaning became more insistent. Meaning could not simply be imposed from above. It was generated and contested at every level, in ways that were conscious and unconscious, formal and informal, carefully considered and spontaneous. Nevertheless, many agents and agencies, recognizing the extent of cultural fluidity, were anxious to shape responses favourable to their own projects. In many cases, they hoped to shuck away the inertia of routine, the stasis of inherited conceptions, to make people more receptive to new ideas, new commodities, new patterns of behaviour. They sought physical and mental spaces where consciousness, or certain ranges of it, would be more acutely susceptible to revision. The\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nimpulse to propagate new messages, in other words, stimulated the creation of new sites of public discourse and the transformation of older ones - among them, fairs. This book explores one specific site in the late Victorian period the Toronto Industrial Exhibition - and tries to suggest how it contributed, intentionally and unintentionally, to the shaping of understandings of modernity. The show's impact was rarely straightforward. As was often the case, the increased intensity of efforts to mould perceptions encouraged more pronounced reactions. The fair could never generate universal acceptance of its preferred messages, but it could, and did, illuminate significant areas of social concern. The establishment in Toronto of an Industrial Exhibition that devoted considerable attention to farming interests made perfect sense. In the late nineteenth century the city was metropolis to a hinterland that was markedly agricultural in character, with a growing industrial base. In 1871, 78 per cent of slightly more than 1.6 million Ontarians lived in rural areas, the vast majority in the eastern and southwestern regions. Only thirteen places had more than 5000 people, representing less than 11 per cent of the population. These ratios began to change quickly as urbanization took hold in the last three decades of the century. By 1911, only 47 per cent of the now more than 2.5 million residents were classified as rural.7 Farm people worried about their declining influence, but, well into the 1930s, agriculture remained the keystone of the economy. If the proportion of rural people was declining, their absolute numbers were not. Ontario farms were not depopulated in this period. According to census data, 309,000 people were gainfully employed in agriculture in 1901, 78,000 more than three decades earlier.8 Most farms were family owned and operated and were relatively prosperous, though obviously there were exceptions.9 By the 1870s the shift from growing wheat for export to mixed production for local urban markets was well under way.10 Along with fruit, vegetables, meat, and dairy products, farms also sent to the city much of their excess population. Some family members who were unable to acquire land in traditional settled areas took up homesteads in the West, but many were attracted to industrial and white-collar employment in cities. Their departure allowed the rural sector to escape constricting poverty from overpopulation, and meant that, instead of supporting large numbers of indigent relatives with nowhere to go, surpluses\n\n8\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\ncould be used to modernize operations and to purchase consumer goods. As agriculture was restructured, industry matured. Throughout the 1860s, much of it, such as implement manufacture, butter and cheese making, and milling, had been farm centred. In the 1870s production became much more diversified, with many firms much larger than those that had existed previously.11 Some industries recorded impressive advances. The gross value of baked goods and confectionery rose from $3 million in 1870 to more than $14 million in 1910. Agricultural implement production in the same period went from $2.3 million to more than $19 million. Clothing went from slightly more than $4 million to over $30 million.12 Clearly, industry was supplying new needs, not just more people. Although the performance of the provincial economy as a whole in the late nineteenth century was not spectacular, it was 'creditable.'13 At a time when population growth was comparatively sluggish, as in the 1870s and 1880s, or virtually non-existent, as in the 1890s, when many Ontarians emigrated to the United States, this was perhaps the most that could be expected.14 Despite occasional downturns, there was no general depression, and expansion in most respects was uninterrupted from one decade to the next. The beneficiary of much of this development was Toronto. By the 1870s, when industrialization began to take off, its well-developed entrepot structure, as well as its reserves of capital and labour, rapidly attracted scores of enterprises, including foundries, metalworking plants, furniture workshops, clothing sweatshops, distilleries, piano manufactories, and slaughter houses. In 1870, 11 per cent of the province's industrial employment was located in Toronto. By 1910 the figure had risen to 27.3 per cent.15 Other places also grew, sometimes at rates that outpaced Toronto's.16 None, however, had the same range of industrial activity, and most came increasingly under Toronto's control, especially in the 1890s and after, when the city's investment tentacles began to stretch. By the end of the First World War, when Toronto was rivalling Montreal as a national metropolis, the nickname 'Hogtown' was only partly attributable to its flourishing meat-packing plants.17 With industry came other economic activity. Factories, office buildings, and houses were erected in a series of construction booms.18 Streets, sewers, and utility infrastructures were set out. The railway system was overhauled and expanded, tightening the city's grip on\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ncentral and southwestern portions of the province and extending its transcontinental reach.19 Retail trades, already well established, grew even more. In 1871 the city had 71 dry-goods dealers; in 1891 it had 119, including several large department stores.20 These shops were important sources of jobs for women, as were expanding government and business bureaucracies, where more and more clerical workers were needed. Economic dominance inevitably produced cultural influence. Toronto became headquarters for religious bodies, labour groups, professional organizations, and voluntary associations, not to mention legal, medical, and educational institutions.21 Naturally, economic growth was reflected in population changes, which, though not nearly as dramatic as in places like New York and Chicago, were still impressive. In 1871 there were 56,000 residents, a few more than twice the number in the next largest Ontario centre, Hamilton; by 1911 there were in excess of 375,000, more than four times the number in Ottawa, now the closest provincial rival. Even through the general deflation of the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s, Toronto grew by 270 per cent; the province as a whole, in comparison, increased by less than 35 per cent. In 1871 the city accounted for 3.5 per cent of the entire provincial population. By 1911 it represented 9.5 per cent, and the proportion was increasing.22 Some of this boom was due to the annexation of adjacent villages, but most was the result of natural increase and immigration. No other urban place in Canada rivalled it as a destination for newcomers. In the 1890s, more than a third of Toronto residents were not native born.23 The most remarkable thing about Toronto's mushrooming population in the late Victorian period was its homogeneity. Not only did rural emigrants from the surrounding hinterland come from AngloCeltic stock but so did the majority of those from abroad. From the middle of the nineteenth century to its end, no more than 6 per cent of residents were characterized as 'foreign born.' The rest came almost entirely from the British Isles.24 A significant component were Irish Catholics, sometimes viewed with hostility by Protestants, but the linguistic and ethnic differences so apparent in many American cities at this time were largely absent. By the 1890s even Orange-Green antagonisms were subsiding.25 All this sameness made at times for a large degree of conservatism and smugness among the better off. Many working people continued to struggle at the margins of subsistence, often protesting strenuously about intrusions of industrial capitalism into their traditional\n\n10\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\npractices.26 Affluent burghers, on the other hand, easily overlooked the pockets of slums, emphasizing instead the number of shady streets, comfortable houses, large churches, and substantial public buildings. Theirs, they believed, was a 'British' city - God-fearing, loyal to Queen and Empire, and, particularly compared with centres south of the border, moral. Boosters painted it as a progressive, goahead kind of place, full of evidence of civic-mindedness and material progress.27 \"The industrial and social evolution of Toronto, especially within the last two decades, is so remarkable as to be almost without a parallel in the history of the communities of the New World,' rhapsodized publisher and man of letters G. Mercer Adam in 1891, as the city approached its centennial.28 A year later, Adam moved to the United States. Toronto, it seemed, was not the only centre of opportunity. Nor was it as distinctive as Adam maintained. Notwithstanding its ethnic homogeneity, it was in many respects a typical North American provincial city: though it was not not in the first rank of urban places, it was ambitious to prove that it belonged there and was convinced that it would soon arrive. It was a little too impressed by its own sophistication, a little too insistent about its own virtues. Though every city is unique in some respects, Toronto was not really unusual, and one indication was its annual fair.29 Fairs are ancient institutions. The impulse to suspend routine, exchange goods and information with those from beyond, and enjoy extraordinary entertainments seems deeply rooted in human experience. Certainly by the Middle Ages, fairs had become an integral part of Western culture.30 Some were connected to particular moments of the annual round, such as harvest or pre-lenten carnival celebrations. Others were mainly market opportunities and occurred much more frequently. While appreciating the commercial possibilities of fairs, authorities were often wary. From their perspective, acceptable levels of civility, order, and deference all too often went by the boards as crowds caroused, miscreants of various sorts plied their trades, and outsiders such as travelling actors introduced dangerous notions - particularly about the failings of those on top. There was often good reason to be suspicious. St Bartholomew's at Smithfield, for example, was a 'raucous, free-spending fortnight' during which thousands gorged, drank, gambled, and brawled. This oldest and biggest of London's fairs acquired a reputation for riot and lewdness\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nthat persisted long after it was abolished in 1855.31 From the seventeenth century on, respectable elements in many areas joined forces to suppress, moderate, or transform traditional shows that they considered excessive. This process became easier as middle-class mores gained ascendancy and as the commercial importance of many events was undermined by the increase of permanent retail shops.32 Shows that evolved into largely entertainment occasions became much harder to defend. Paradoxically, festering intolerance towards some fairs in the nineteenth century was accompanied by the creation of all sorts of new fairs.33 Two currents fed this resurgence of respectability and acceptance - the commitment to scientific agriculture and the success of international expositions. With the agricultural revolution of the eighteenth century, advances in farming became tied to fairs where new techniques and implements could be demonstrated, and where competitions were used to foster the improvement of crops and livestock. The notion that shows almost automatically stimulated the impulse to do better became conventional wisdom. 'He must be a very thick-skinned and out-of-date farmer, indeed,' declared the editor of Farming at the 1895 Toronto event, 'who does not feel incited by the sight of so many fine farm animals brought together, to try, in a small way, to emulate those breeders in improving his own stock.' The dissemination of improvements proceeded along many other avenues, but fairs sponsored by local agricultural societies became a key avenue of advance.34 The deep roots of the Toronto show were often traced to this sort of commitment to progress: to be precise, to a $40 prize purse donated by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe to the Niagara Agricultural Society in 1792. This commitment was interpreted as proof of an enlightened approach to agriculture from the province's very start, though not until 1830 did the Upper Canadian government make a systematic effort to encourage district agricultural societies and their shows by giving legislative recognition and small grants.35 Although this support seems to have been about a decade earlier than the revival of interest in agricultural societies in the United States, it was not until 1846, five years after the first New York State Fair, that the newly formed Provincial Agricultural Association and Board of Agriculture for Canada West, set up as a coordinating body for local societies, organized the first provincewide fair, held in Toronto that fall. The site of the Provincial Fair, as it came to be\n\n12\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nknown, moved from year to year, eventually settling into a rotation among London, Kingston, Hamilton, Ottawa, and Toronto.36 By 1878, when its turn came around again, Toronto had hosted on seven previous occasions, and local leaders were anxious to secure the fair as a permanent attraction. After obtaining a long-term lease on a portion of the Garrison Common, federal land reserved for military purposes, the city erected a number of substantial buildings, hoping that provincial exhibition directors would recognize the desirability of reusing the facilities. These worthies heaped praise on the 1878 organizers, then promptly picked Ottawa for the next fair. Toronto responded by forming a separate Industrial Exhibition Association and, in direct challenge, mounting its own show a year later.37 As the name of the new organization indicated, urban manufacturing and business interests were now extensively involved. They had long attached themselves to agricultural shows to advertise and sell, but their interest in this sort of venue was reinforced by the other, more urban, current that rehabilitated fairs in the nineteenth century the phenomenal popularity of international expositions. Although London's 1851 Exhibition is usually considered to have inaugurated the era of great international shows, the British merely expanded on a concept that had been evolving for at least six decades.38 After the resounding success of the Crystal Palace exhibition hall, the popularity of such extravaganzas spread like wildfire. Between 1855 and 1914, an event involving more than twenty nations was held somewhere in the world on an average of once every two years, and these exhibitions were supplemented by many smaller ones. The French were probably the most ambitious sponsors, having decided to use expositions to establish their cultural pre-eminence. The great Paris shows of 1867, 1878, 1889, and 1900 set glittering standards for others to follow. Americans were relatively slow in getting started, but the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876 inaugurated a long succession of grand fairs, including the largest and most successful at Chicago in 1893, the Columbian Exposition.39 The character of international exhibitions evolved quickly. By the early 1870s organizers discovered that straightforward presentations of technology and manufactured goods were no longer sufficient to attract visitors. Space was given increasingly to other things, including natural history, science, agriculture, and educational methods.40 The two most important additions were fine art and popular amusements. The latter brought in more people, but the former\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nhad a higher symbolic status. A dominant theme in most fairs was the union of new forces of industrialism with the great traditions of art. For the most part, conservative juries chose staid, academic works, creating striking contrasts between the new, innovative, and unsettling, represented by industry, and the reassuringly familiar, represented by art. As Paul Greenhalgh has pointed out, the juxtaposition encouraged perceptions of a wide gulf between high and popular culture, between the functional and the ethereal, but the presence of art also conferred prestige on the whole proceeding. Without it, 'an exhibition became just a trade fair.'41 The first amusement additions were fairly innocuous landscape attractions long featured in pleasure gardens - lawns, mazes, grottos, lakes, islands, fountains, and the like. As with fine art, part of the motivation was a desire to set industry into a more humanized, pastoral context.42 Before long, other respectable entertainments were allowed, especially after working people were targeted as visitors. The Crystal Palace show had been inaccessible to anyone who was not at least in the prosperous artisan class, but Napoleon III deliberately opened the 1867 Paris show to the masses as a way of winning their loyalty.43 Allowing amusements brought in more revenue, permitted authorities to monitor popular entertainments more closely, and kept tourists out of more dangerous dens elsewhere in the city.44 Of course, middle-class people were just as eager as workers for light frolics - and far more able to pay. Altogether, the attractions of the grand expositions were exceptionally diverse, making them unusual social phenomena. As Neil Harris has pointed out, in an age when many cultural institutions were carving up and dividing social spheres, the exposition was bringing them together.45 The Toronto fair was never an international exposition, though it constantly aspired to be one. Talk of getting official accreditation began as early as 1880 and continued throughout the century.46 Although the formal designation was never attained, many supporters claimed that the Industrial was little different - 'Not a World's Fair but Nearly So,' as the 1893 program cover put it. The disappointed took consolation in the permanence of what Toronto had. Recent expositions at Chicago and Buffalo, 'efflorescent and beautiful as they might be,' said the News in 1903, 'were yet evanescent, a dream prolonged over half a year.' The Industrial's glory would grow and last.47 Whether the Toronto fair rivalled international events or not, it\n\n14\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nwas viewed as part of the same tradition. The 1851 Crystal Palace show had marked 'an era in the history of the humanities of the world,' wrote a Globe columnist somewhat obscurely, and from it came all the smaller ones, 'our own amongst the number.' In fact, association managers did keep a close eye on exposition innovations, adapting features of demonstrated popularity or utility according to their own budgetary constraints. Organizers were most interested in American expositions, which were not only more accessible but had audiences and exhibit priorities that more closely resembled their own.48 The 1893 Chicago show had not closed its gates, for example, before some of its star attractions arrived in Toronto. Individual exhibitors likewise were sharply attuned to developments elsewhere and quick to adopt them. Again, influences from Chicago in 1893 soon pervaded Toronto. 'On every side,' wrote Mail columnist Kit Coleman in 1894, 'one could see that we had profited by certain teachings. Goods were better set out, practical workings of machinery and the different trades were better operated, harmony of form and coloring more closely studied with beautiful effect than ever before. The Exhibition was fuller, broader.'49 The impact of the Columbian was profound, but it was not the only exposition to which Torontonians paid attention.50 Nor were world's fairs the only models from which they drew. Amusement parks, vaudeville theatres, museums, trade shows, and department stores all became sources for general ideas and specific features. In the Victorian period, distinctions among these institutions were often fuzzy, which was not surprising. All were shaped by the same basic conditions, including more disposable income in more hands, more leisure time, better transportation, and more commodities that had to be sold. Inevitably, a certain sameness was evident in spectacle environments of all kinds, and fairs specifically took on a 'generic likeness,' as a European visitor noted in his diary after seeing the 1883 Toronto show.51 However desirable it might be to tag onto the broad exposition tradition, pride and ambition ensured that the Toronto production would be viewed as something more than the local version of an international phenomenon. The Industrial was special, maintained boosters, because, of all annual shows, it was the largest. The editor of the Orillia Packet called it 'the chief exhibition on this continent.' The editor of Farming was convinced there was nothing like it in North America or Europe.52 Such language was hyperbole. As North\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nAmerican fairs went, Toronto's was one of the biggest, but it was similar to many state fairs and other regional Canadian shows, such as the Central Canadian Exhibition in Ottawa and the Western Fair in London. With larger audiences and greater revenues, Toronto could draw more exhibitors and offer more attractions, but they were not significantly different ones. According to the Mail and Empire at the turn of the century, the modern era had become the 'age of the exhibition.' 'Recent times have been so fertile of new processes and of economies that there has been a veritable profusion of improvements. To get to know anything about these at first hand we must have specimens of them assembled at some one point of observation.' A decade earlier, The Week had insisted that exhibitions Tiave done and are doing very much in the way of stimulating enterprise and giving fresh impulse to ingenuity and effort in almost every department of human activity.'53 For both agriculture and industry, fairs were seen as essential tools of progress, necessary both to comprehend and to continue it. The effect of these assertions, and countless others in the same vein, was to obscure the fact that they were also instruments of hegemony, intended to further the goals of specific interests. The exhibition was designed to engineer consent, to legitimate the leadership of particular interests. The most effective kind of consent, as Gramsci explained, derives from structures of understanding that are common in a culture. Where traditional Marxists emphasized the coercive clout of the state to enforce compliance with elite projects, Gramsci highlighted the socializing power of the civil sphere in turning elite biases and values into 'common sense' perceptions of day-today existence. Relations forged here appeared to exist apart from the potentially menacing state and from the often bitterly contested realm of production.54 Although promoters were of course unfamiliar with Gramsci's insights, they recognized the fair's utility for inserting self-interested predispositions and values into the fabric of ordinary life.55 Farm and factory interests backed the Industrial, not just for immediate monetary gain but for the favourable light it cast on their pursuits. Other groups had less transparent but still impelling objectives. For Torontonians trying to extend the influence of their metropolis, for the city's industrial capitalist elite trying to prove itself, and for a growing middle class trying to solidify its identity and secure its hold, the great show was a valuable lever.\n\n16\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nIn an immediate sense, its power lay in the hands of those who administered it. The Industrial Exhibition Association was composed of delegates elected or appointed annually from various political bodies and from societies representing agricultural, manufacturing, horticultural, commercial, and educational interests throughout the province. The fair began in 1879 with fifty-three representatives from eighteen organizations. By 1883 it had expanded to seventythree members from twenty-six organizations, ranging from the Toronto City and York County councils to the Canadian Institute and the Ontario Beekeepers' Association. About half these groups, including the Toronto Horticultural Society and the Toronto Board of Trade, represented strictly local interests; the rest had broader geographic bases, though many were headquartered in the city as well, such as the Ontario Department of Education and the Ontario Society of Artists. The Toronto City Council, with thirteen seats, and the Toronto Electoral District Society, with twelve, had by far the most influence. Except for the Manufacturers' Association of Canada, with five seats, and the Ontario Association of Mechanics' Institutes, with three, none of the other organizations sent more than two representatives.56 From this larger body, a twenty-person board of directors was elected to advise the general manager on the planning and operations of the show.57 The directors had the real clout. Although some effort was made to choose proportionally from the various societies, virtually all directors were Toronto residents. This, in itself, suggests how the fair was used to normalize Toronto's metropolitan dominance. What has to be remembered is that this preeminence was relatively new and, for many people, disturbing. As Robert Wiebe argued in a now classic study of the Progressive era, one of its major features was the gradual demise of the 'island community.'58 With improved transportation and communications, and the reorganization of production on a continental basis, the isolation of small centres scattered throughout the hinterland eroded. Many hamlets and crossroads became redundant and disappeared.59 The rest were pulled increasingly into new orbits by such things as telegraph and telephone wires, travelling salesmen, railway tracks, and mail-order catalogues. Communities with traditions of relative selfsufficiency and autonomy were not happy at the prospect of becoming mere satellites. The refusal of smaller Ontario cities to permit Toronto's monopolization of the Provincial Exhibition was one example of resistance to the process, although Hogtown's assumption of\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\npre-eminence was an indication that it was well under way by the time the Industrial was founded. For Toronto, then, the fair was a useful way of persuading the periphery to acquiesce with minimal resentment to increasing centralization. People in the hinterland came to the Industrial Exhibition because it was more impressive than local shows, but also because it claimed to be more than just a Toronto venture. Representation on the overall governing body of groups, such as the Eastern and Western Dairymen's Associations, the Fruit Growers' Association of Ontario, and the Dominion Grange, disguised the effective control by city interests. Of course, power was exercised by specific individuals, not simply by anonymous agents. Who were these men? The initial cohort of twenty directors was typical of those who served during the first quarter century. In fact, over half remained directors for a decade or more, and two for the entire period. The large majority were prominent business figures. John Withrow, president of the association for more than twenty years, owned a construction firm, developed real estate, and was president of the Canadian Mutual Loan and Investment Company. W.F. McMaster, nephew of a prominent dry-goods dealer, had himself been involved in numerous retail enterprises, was a promoter and director of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway, and eventually became secretary of the Bureau of Industries in the Provincial Agricultural Department. John Hallam, 'one of Toronto's most prosperous citizens,' was a hide, wool, and leather merchant, and Robert Barber, of Barber and Company, was an agent for woollen manufacturers. William Christie presided over a well-known biscuit company that produced for the national market. Both James Fleming and William Rennie owned seed-growing companies with large retail divisions, while George Leslie operated a highly successful nursery. Joseph Davids and W.H. Doel had drug businesses. W.H. Rowland took over his father's milling business and from there become prominent in other financial, insurance, and electrical enterprises. W.B. Hamilton manufactured boots and shoes, and Samuel Wilson, cigars. George Booth ran a copper and brass foundry, and Patrick Close was a wholesale grocery, wine, and spirit merchant. Of the remaining five directors, at least two could be described as professionals. Dr Andrew Smith was principal of the Ontario Veterinary College and president of the Ontario Veterinary Association. D.C. Ridout, trained as a civil engineer, was a patent solicitor. Both\n\n18\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nhad close connections to the business sphere, as did James McGee, identified in the City Directory as a bookkeeper. Lucius O'Brien, a distinguished painter, might also be considered a kind of professional. As founding president of the Royal Canadian Academy, he was a central figure in establishing an accreditation organization for fellow artists. The occupation of the final director, Alex McGregor, was unspecified in city directories, though he lived in a fashionable district and, like ten of the others, served on the Toronto City Council.60 What does this heavy business presence suggest about the fair as an instrument of social power? Why were these people willing to give it a considerable portion of their energies? Individual ambition played a large role in determining specifically who came forward for service. The only material rewards for their labour were free lunches on the grounds while the show was in progress, but directorship conferred a significant measure of prestige, which some may have hoped would translate into other advantages. However, the homogeneity also suggests that these individuals represented not simply private interests, but a particular social and economic constituency that was attempting to flex its muscles. As J.M.S. Careless has pointed out, political and social power in late nineteenth-century Toronto was shifting from 'old families,' whose prominence was rooted in land ownership and patronage connections, to new men whose claims lay in industrial and mercantile success.61 Merchants, factory owners, railway entrepreneurs, and contractors - precisely the sort of men who served as directors - were emerging as the city's most influential element. In the initial cohort, even the two with ties to the older elite - Ridout, whose family had long been socially prominent, and Howland, whose father had been lieutenant governor of the province - were firmly enmeshed in the new business culture. There was no sharp antagonism in the transition; the values of the two groups were close. Still, a general snobbishness towards the newly rich by the old made it clear that the process was not completely uncontested,62 and the eagerness of the former to gain municipal office suggests that their priorities were not identical. This was an elite committed to capital as the vital coordinator of social organization. The fair was invaluable to the new men in asserting their claims. Running it successfully gave them a chance to demonstrate their competence to the wider public, suggested they were motivated by ideals of community service, and allowed them to bypass the parti-\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nsan quagmire of regular politics. Through the Exhibition Association and its board, they not only inserted themselves into dominant positions in an alliance with agricultural and cultural organizations but they heightened the impression that they deserved support, not because they were wealthy or because they wore a particular party stripe, but because they stood for honest, efficient administration of public affairs. Though many were appointed to the board because of their positions as aldermen, thereby ensuring that the city's concerns were carefully considered, the ostensible arm's-length relationship, as well as the participation of individuals who did not hold political office, implied that the fair was operated on principles far different from the patronage and self-interest that seemed to underlie the older elite's approach to public service.63 If the directors represented a new business elite trying to legitimate claims to civic leadership, they also represented more generally the middle class, the large body of respectable citizens whom Careless described as the 'balance-weight' of late Victorian Toronto.64 This was a group in ascent, but also in considerable flux, and not just in Hogtown. Some would say that this class had been rising since the dark ages, but in nineteenth-century North America its situation did, in fact, change dramatically. The merchants, professionals, and more prosperous artisans who made up the 'middling sorts' in its early decades were relatively few, and not far removed from the mass of people in the lower orders. They soon became more numerous and, at least initially, more distinct. The stimulus, according to Stuart Blumin, was the growing distance between manual and non-manual labour. Previously, both kinds of activities were carried out in close proximity, with no great differentiation between the status of the two. Many business proprietors themselves plied a craft beside their employees. Economic specialization, concomitant with the increasing size and complexity of enterprise, drove a wedge between those who worked with their hands and those who did not. More and more, the former tended to earn hourly wages in rough, utilitarian environments, while the latter were paid salaries for wearing more presentable clothing in finished, centrally located offices and stores, well separated from the sweat and grime of production. As the number of non-manual workers swelled and the status of manual workers declined, the former became more intent on shaping a distinct identity. They began to live, as well as to work, apart, and\n\n20\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nthey used these spaces to nurture new values. The domestic sphere became, in Mary Ryan's words, 'the cradle of the middle class.' Protecting the sanctity of the family, honouring its rituals, preserving its genteel accoutrements, and supporting agencies that extended its influence, such as evangelical religion and voluntary reform societies, became the central focus of efforts at self-definition.65 By the closing decades of the century, with the growth in professions, bureaucracies, and sales forces, this class had swollen enormously. In addition to those whose wealth and education placed them firmly in its ranks, it encompassed many who thought they belonged there by virtue of self-employment, acceptance of bourgeois ideals, or aspirations to positions of affluence and responsibility. As late as 1905, according to Jurgen Kocka, about 50 per cent of American retail clerks saw their positions as an apprenticeship before they began their own businesses; the public saw them as potential future store owners as well. This ideological identification with businessmen was not unique to sales clerks or to men. Many working women, themselves ghettoized in menial jobs, believed with good reason that they could achieve higher status through marriage. Nor was it exclusively urban: prosperous farm families, not to mention village notables, also saw themselves as something other than lowly labourers.66 Needless to say, the internal cohesion of this class should not be exaggerated, not just because the collar line was really a murky zone but also because the effects of industrial capitalism cut across middle-class interests and sensibilities. Not everyone welcomed the arrival of experts, large enterprises, and commercial values. Not everyone felt comfortable with the urbanization, mass immigration, and deskilling of jobs that sank the status of workers.67 Still, there was broad unanimity within the middle class in the pursuit of two far-ranging projects: to ensure their leadership of society as a whole, and to define more precisely their own class characteristics. The fair was a useful tool for both objectives, because it was embraced at all social levels. The fair's popularity was indisputable. Over the quarter century after its founding, paid attendance rose from 102,000 to 527,000. In only four of those years did admissions drop from what they had been the previous season. In 1881, 125,000 people passed the turnstiles equivalent to 6.5 per cent of the provincial population. In 1901, 439,000 official entrances amounted to 20 per cent of the provincial population.68 It is hard to know precisely what these figures repre-\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nsent, since multiple visits became more common as the show got larger, but it seems safe to assume that participation more than kept pace with immigration and natural increase. If contemporary reports can be believed, the entire social spectrum was attracted. 'People of all sorts and conditions of life are here found in promiscuous confusion, the bootblack bustling elbows with the millionaire,' commented a News reporter in 1883. The following decade, a Guelph editor remarked on 'the delightful mingling once a year of the rich and poor upon the same level, the elbow to elbow contact of aristocrat and plebeian.'69 Such comments were no doubt accurate as far as they went, but whether the fair drew in the same proportion from every constituency is harder to assess. Excursion trains from outlying parts, 'crowded with passengers as thick as they can hang on,' as one contemporary put it,70 testified to the interest of small-town and farm folk. Probably a higher percentage of the former came, since they were less encumbered with day-to-day chores, but diaries indicate that even in this harvest season many farm people managed a visit, often by alternating days on which family members were freed up.71 They were sometimes torn between conflicting local and metropolitan pulls, and not always at ease in the city, but they were ideologically at home on the fairground. Were working people equally enthusiastic? A good number of firms hoped they were and actively promoted attendance. In 1881 the Compton Corset Company actually provided tickets for employees.72 The city and the Exhibition Association encouraged these gestures. In 1880 Mayor Beaty issued a special request asking employers to grant a half holiday on the first Saturday of the fair so workers would have a chance to visit.73 'Citizens' Day,' as it was designated, quickly became an annual feature, proclaimed by council each year in response to petitions from some of the larger companies, including the Massey agricultural works, the Gurney stove factory, the Heintzman piano factory, and the Morse soap works.74 By the end of the decade, except for operators of essential services and for merchants reluctant to turn away visitors with money to spend, most employers were conceding the holiday.75 Their generosity may not have been entirely altruistic. Firms like Massey and Morse, which mounted large displays, had an interest in generating excitement by boosting attendance, and they may have preferred to shut down production on a planned basis than to cope with unpredictable patterns of absenteeism.\n\n22\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nAs well, they may have appreciated that the fair was a more effective instrument of working-class subordination than moralistic hectoring or outright coercion. By cultivating a labourer's tastes, counselled a Dry Goods Review editorial in 1894, his desire for more and better goods would increase. 'His bare floors must be carpeted, his windows curtained, his furniture covered, his walls papered, his bookcases replenished, and his wardrobe enlarged.' With the props of bourgeois domesticity in place, the corresponding sentiments would follow. Although there was some danger that the fair might kindle resentment, its overall effect was thought to work more consistently in the other direction. The coming together of manufacturers, mechanics, and labourers for a common purpose at the fair, preached Rev. Theodore Parr to a Toronto congregation in 1892, was an important instrument in educating the population for carrying out the duties of citizenship. Putting goods out for mass display not only provided tangible proof of the advantages of class cooperation but seemed to suggest a commitment to making them available to all, regardless of station. Show the worker that he can be cultivated and educated, and still pursue a calling that was honest, said the Dry Goods Review, and 'bitter feelings will be removed from the hearts of those who under very adverse circumstances come to hate capital, government and the social structure.' Such ideas about the utility of exhibitions were long standing. From the Crystal Palace show on, fairs were deliberately intended as antidotes to class conflict.76 Did working people take the bait, on Citizens' Day or any other time? Notorious congestion on the official holiday suggests that many did, as do other snippets of evidence, the most compelling of which come from labour bodies that sometimes found the fair too much competition. The Toronto Star summarized the problem in 1903, when some unions considered petitioning to change the date of Labour Day: There are only two propositions to work upon to celebrate the day. If it is decided to go to the Exhibition the individuality and distinctive characteristics of the day are lost sight of in the magnitude and national character of the Exhibition, and the social features of the day are entirely set aside. If it is decided to go to the Island or elsewhere, the Exhibition as a counter attraction on the only holiday during the Fair makes it almost impossible to bring the workers together to celebrate labour's holiday.\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nOrganizers spoke from experience. In 1896, for example, when labour festivities took place on Toronto Island, only two hundred people had gone to hear the speeches. The problem was never resolved in the Victorian era. Toronto unions waffled from one approach to the other, sometimes meeting on the grounds, sometimes not. When they did not, many in the rank and file opted for solidarity with the middle class.77 As a bourgeois influence, the Industrial had a big advantage. Because it was a new institution, no traditions of rough conviviality, no long-standing working-class rights, had to be accommodated. This independence became abundantly clear in 1898 when the Exhibition Association cancelled a commission arrangement with the local Trades and Labor Congress on Labour Day admission tickets sold to its members. Union officials were furious. 'Shall we calmly submit to this ignoble insult thrown at us by this practically irresponsible body,' asked the secretary in an open letter, 'or shall we rise indignantly and prove that we can, when occasion demands, give the lie to those who tell us we will not work unitedly to assert our dignity and influence in the community.'78 Labour Day was celebrated that year at a skating rink rather than at the fairgrounds. The congress preserved its dignity, but only by boycotting the show. Similarly, three years later, when the Knights of Labor objected to the association's refusal to cancel a coal contract with a non-union employer, their recourse was a resolution not to attend.79 Workers' organizations protested from a distance, without disturbing the symbolic coherence or the festive mood of the actual grounds. When working people did come, they had to conform to acceptable standards of behaviour, or risk being ejected. While the fair supported bourgeois hegemony, it also helped the middle class to explore and fix its own identity. This was not a settled constituency. More and more people were working with their brains than with their hands; more and more were achieving levels of economic comfort well beyond mere subsistence; more and more believed they could achieve some reasonable degree of gentility. By the end of the century, according to Eric Hobsbawm, this group was larger than the working class itself. As the number of white-collar positions at the lower end proliferated, the obscurity of class boundaries produced enormous confusion and anxiety. The urgent need to create comprehensible markers resulted in much greater attention to the signifying power of knowledge and to lifestyles.80 The fair fed into both, especially the latter.\n\n24\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nIn an economy that put increasing emphasis on managerial and technical expertise, an intensification of formal accreditation was not surprising, but it also served desires for social exclusivity. According to Robert Wiebe, two main tracks towards proficiency emerged. One stressed professional education at universities, in fields such as medicine, law, administration, and economics; the other, consultation and cooperation among those grappling with common problems in areas such as business, labour, and agriculture. For individuals in both groups, 'identification by way of their skills gave them the deference of their neighbors while opening natural avenues into the nation at large.' Class boundaries were protected by increasingly rigorous training requirements and the 'shared mysteries' of occupations.81 The 'People's University,' as the Industrial was sometimes called, offered no degrees, but it continually reinforced the prestige of specialists, from agricultural scientists, through mechanical and electrical engineers, to professional display designers. The very composition of the Exhibition Association, with its high proportion of representatives from breeder and producer organizations, indicated that status, not just progress, derived from professional cooperation. Although visitors were exhorted to learn from the fair, a studious demeanour was not necessary to demonstrate bourgeois inclinations. Simply being there went some way towards that end because it indicated an ability and a willingness to indulge in leisure, a sphere that became central in the definition of class boundaries. Having the wherewithal and the time to play sports, take vacations, and patronize commercial amusements were luxuries much less available to working people, though in the case of the fair, with a relatively modest twenty-five cent admission, exclusivity was not the point. Rather, mass accessibility universalized a middle-class standard, suggesting that rational recreation was not a wasteful extravagance but a normal expectation. Those who did not participate were eccentric or inferior. Those who did found at the show a secure field where constraints of class and ethnic background interfered less with the practice of new ways of being. Leisure was an important part of the bourgeois lifestyle, but not the only component. Although that culture was becoming homogenized, its forms were not preordained. What it meant to be middle class was something to be defined and promulgated, in the home and on the street as well as at work. Language, dress, domestic accoutrements, public deportment - all such important mechanisms for\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\ngrounding identities had to be debated, ranked, tested, propagated, normalized. As much as anyone else, middling sorts had to decide the meaning of what was new in modernity, and had to integrate it into their ordinary existence. For them, the exhibition was an extraordinary site not because of its commercial functions, but because it laid out with unusual comprehensiveness the hierarchies of taste around which class consciousness took shape.82 What made the fair so effective a catalyst in helping people handle new arrangements and possibilities was its ritual quality. It may seem strange to think of ritual as a device for encouraging openness to alternatives. After all, many prominent rituals are marked by rigid schedules and strictly prescribed behaviour. For some observers, this is their essential characteristic. Ritual is a declaration of form against indeterminacy, say Sally Moore and Barbara Myerhoff. It must be orderly because it Veils the ultimate disorder, the nonorder, which is the unconceptualized, unformed chaos underlying culture.'83 Repetition and order disguise the contingency of being, permitting cultures to function on fairly stable foundations at a cost of discouraging inquiry. According to anthropologist Victor Turner, this understanding, typical of those observing from the outside, is incomplete. From the perspective of serious participants, a ritual looks very different. Its essence is liminality - a condition 'betwixt and between' ordinary existence when 'anything can or even should happen.' Turner suggested that a participant in ritual crosses a threshold, leaving behind the ordinary realm, and enters one where everyday forms and conditions are dissolved. Here, things are able to interact and combine in ways that are inconceivable in regular life. Not that they necessarily do combine, but they may. Anything is possible. The ritual concludes when the participant recrosses the threshold to ordinary existence, sometimes having been changed in the process.84 An outsider observing a religious congregation, for example, might see a group of people who assemble week after week in the same spot to perform a series of unvarying activities. True believers have a different sense of what is transpiring. For them, the space is an access point to the primary forces of the cosmos. Through methodical ceremonies, they are attempting to become more attuned to the presence and purpose of those powers. The House of God is a place 'betwixt and between' mundane reality, where anything can or even should\n\n26\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nhappen. If the proper connection is made, miracles are possible. New ways of being that are learned here can be carried back to normal life, though there is no guarantee that substantive change will occur during any particular session. Ritual, in other words, permits 'a heterodox merging of elements usually perceived as incompatible.' The quotation comes from Stallybrass and White's description of fairgrounds, and, indeed, their conception of this transgressive space, where high/low oppositions in all domains have the greatest freedom to intersect and upset usual hierarchies, fits comfortably with Turner's notion of liminality. It is this tolerance of the 'radically hybrid' that makes ritual so effective for investigating meaning.85 From this perspective, its rigidity derives not from a desire to stifle imagination, but from a recognition of the need to tread warily where so many protean possibilities exist and the effect of powerful forces is unpredictable. In rituals, then, there is usually a continual tension between prescribed forms and formlessness, between structure and what Turner called anti-structure. Those who preside make some effort to control the encounter by organizing the context where it occurs, mediating between participants and forces that may be unleashed, and directing responses into appropriate channels. Toronto burghers were comfortable with the amalgam of extraordinary creatures, bizarre objects, and aberrant behaviour at the Industrial Exhibition just because its external scaffolding seemed so stable. Its firm administrative structure kept it a step or two removed from the hurly-burly of party politics. Its spatial structure, set off from the rest of the city and enclosed, allowed more careful regulation and protection of what was inside and buffered the ordinary world from disturbing influences. Its temporal structure, two or three weeks that began and concluded with unambiguous precision, ensured that any transgressive overflow would be of limited duration. With these reassuring constraints, abnormalities produced by the fair could be viewed as playful experiments rather than as challenges to prevailing hierarchies. Though most rituals invented by industrial capitalism were not understood at the time in these terms, they were crucial in forging transitions to modernity. To a large extent, they defined the modern. In an expanding consumer culture, where many groups had an interest in proliferating messages about abundance and the possibilities of material gratification, liminal environments which suggested that anything could or should happen were central. The innovators of\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\ndepartment stores, advertising pages, billboards, and display windows who attempted to expand the import of consumption were just as intent on awakening expectations about the possibilities of existence as those who presided over more traditional religious ceremonies. They, too, sought to mediate encounters and channel responses while they extended horizons. Though older rites were not necessarily abandoned, modern culture was shaped as people participated in these new rites, then integrated perceptions gleaned from them into other spaces of their lives. It is impossible to comprehend the acceptance of industrial capitalist culture without grasping the role of rituals like the Toronto Industrial Exhibition. Before embarking on an extended discussion of how the fair influenced meaning, it is important to have a realistic expectation of what can actually be charted. Many people of all ages and from all levels of society went to the Industrial; few bothered to record what they did there, let alone what they thought of it. Aside from odds and ends of municipal records, administrative reports, photographs, cryptic diaries, and the like, information about the fair in the Victorian period is available only from the press, mainly Toronto daily newspapers. Canadian trade periodicals, like the Canadian Grocer and Electrical News, sometimes commented on exhibits and issues relevant to their particular readers. Papers in smaller cities and towns occasionally contained columns by special correspondents or reports by staff writers on their own visits, but their coverage was sporadic, probably because metropolitan papers, teeming with news of the Industrial, circulated widely in the hinterland.86 Though ideally it would be otherwise, Toronto newspapers are the single detailed source of information about what happened on and off the fairground.87 Like most large cities in the late Victorian period, Toronto supported an abundance of daily papers - a minimum of five by the early 1880s, six by the end of the decade, and seven between 1892 and 1895. The Globe, Mail, and Empire, the last founded by the Conservative Party in 1887, when the Mail started to stray from the party line, and then amalgamated with the Mail in 1895, were more staid and expensive, at two or three cents an issue. The Telegram, World (founded in 1880), News (founded in 1881), and Star (founded in 1892) were shorter, more spritely, and cheaper, at one to two cents an issue. Though political leanings varied in sort and in degree, and though,\n\n28\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\naccording to Thomas Walkom, readerships were more sharply delineated by class during the 1880s and 1890s than before or after,88 all these journals had remarkably similar attitudes towards the exhibition. The Globe and the Mail offered more exhaustive coverage. The penny papers generally tried to capture more of its colour and excitement. Occasionally one organ or another mounted a high horse to berate the fair's administration for some failing. Every one, however, strongly supported the exhibition as a municipal institution, and all had fairly uniform ideas about the significance of its features. In part, consistency was due to the commercialization of news occurring in this period. As papers began to compete more intensively for readers to pay for more expensive printing equipment, quality journals like the Globe and the Mail reached out more deliberately to the lower classes, while the penny presses tried to appeal to wealthier readers. Class conflict was downplayed across the board.89 The older emphasis on political commentary and partisan advocacy declined. Instead, the press concentrated more consistently on serving the commercial needs of the business community, which bought advertising, and making the rapidly changing, increasingly diverse urban milieu more comprehensible. Instead of merely reporting on already transpired political events, reporters went out to gather news, looking for sensation and Tiuman interest' stories that they delivered in vivid, exciting prose.90 The exhibition became a natural target for extensive coverage, though it took on a homogeneous tone. The other reason for consistency was the fact that all the Toronto dailies were city boosters. Paul Rutherford has argued that the entire Canadian daily press in the Victorian period had a uniformly bourgeois outlook which stressed progress, nationality, democracy, order, and social harmony.91 Hogtown editors certainly saw the Industrial as a progressive, popular institution advancing Canadian economic and social possibilities, but, more particularly, they saw it as a key part of what made Toronto notable and successful. Since their own fortunes depended on the prosperity of the metropolis as a whole, they were not inclined to dwell on the shortcomings of an important civic project. Quite the contrary. Coverage of the fair, depicted as a shining example of local capabilities, was overwhelmingly positive and bright. Although Toronto papers contain an enormous amount of material about the fair and fairtime, the information is problematic. It is\n\nIntroduction\n\n29\n\nimpossible to tell who produced much of it. Some appeared with bylines, but the bulk was churned out by anonymous scribes who revealed almost nothing about their age, class origin, ethnic background, and sometimes even gender, although, fortunately, a substantial part of fair coverage was supplied by female columnists. Ultimately, meaning is achieved by individuals whose perceptions are affected by complex personal situations. With the information available, analysis at this level is seldom possible. As well, the information is not disinterested. Reporters and editors worked for instruments tied closely to the city's dominant economic forces. A few had slightly more scope for personal expression, but all spoke as journalists, not Orange Protestants, migrants from small towns, children of unskilled parents, or any other peculiarity of identity. Direct voices of many significant groups - farm people, workers, ethnic minorities, children - are hard to come by. What can be heard from them has been filtered through other ears - how accurately is hard to know. In any event, press reports were regularly distorted. Negative impressions were often muted and expressed long afterwards. Some things were interpreted too generously. Contexts for evaluating observations were sometimes obscure. What did saying the fairground was 'relatively free' of drunkenness, for example, really mean? These failings are disappointing. Homogeneity of perspective and interpretive warping make it difficult to discover diverse readings and plural uses of symbolic elements. However, although the circumstances that created the records produced certain kinds of uniformity, the event was so large and complex that completely consistent responses across the board were impossible. Aggravations, anxieties, and competitions among values and purposes could never be entirely submerged. What do these sources reveal, then? Though offering at best a onesided view of its contestations with subordinate groups, they provide important insights into the attitudes of an urban middle class in a fairly typical North American provincial city during the emergence of the culture of consumption. Although the evidence may not always be accurate in describing actual conditions, the distortions are themselves indications of how late Victorian, bourgeois Torontonians wanted to make sense of their world. Since this was the hegemonic class, its interpretations of everyday, mundane experience spread to other segments, establishing the norm against which non-conformity was measured.\n\n30\n\nBecoming Modern in Toronto\n\nHowever, bourgeois understandings of industrial capitalist society were by no means definitive or monolithic. What these sources indicate most acutely is the urban, middle-class desire to impose meaning in a culture that had become remarkably fluid, and how problematic that goal was. What they allow, for the most part, is an analysis of some of the ways that this group tried to erect and test its hierarchies of value. What they highlight are not crisp, straightforward assertions about what was, but troublesome issues arising from the circumstances of modern existence. As a mechanism to engineer support for metropolitan, middle-class leadership, the fair was relatively successful; as a device to provide absolute reassurances about the anxieties of modernity, it was much less effective. Its messages were ambiguous and contradictory, pulsing fir"
