Publishing these works in English would have been very difficult, if not impossible, without the generous financial help of funding institutions from a number of international organizations, and we would like to express our sincere gratitude to all of these.\n\nOrganized by language of origin, you will be able to get a taste of Chicagoâ€™s translation program, which confirms both our commitment to excellence and our mission to make scholarship available to a wide audience around the globe."
