It is a pleasure to acknowledge these debts here. The idea for such an anthology first arose in conversations with Dr. Sergio Cañedo Gamboa, then Secretario Académico and profesor-investigador in the Colegio de San Luis Potosí, a distinguished Mexican institution of advanced studies, and with his colleague, Dr. Juan Carlos Ruiz Guadalajara, profesor-investigador of the same institution, conversations that eventuated in the publication of a much longer but overlapping set of my essays in Spanish in 2010, Economía, política y cultura en la historia de México. Ensayos historiográficos, metodológicos y teóricos de tres décadas (San Luis Potosí: El Colegio de San Luis Potosí/El Colegio de Michoacán/El Colegio de la Frontera Norte, 2010). I am grateful to both Sergio and Juan Carlos not only for their patience and support in this project, but also for indirectly stimulating the writing of the introduction, which bears some resemblance to the introductory pages of this volume, and which helped me gain some altitude over my own previous work in order to see its shape and direction. When in a fit of hubris I approached Norris Pope, director of Scholarly Publishing at Stanford University Press, about the possibility of doing a revised but overlapping collection of my essays in a single volume for an English-reading public, rather than laugh at my proposal he expressed keen interest in the project and encouraged it at every step. The anonymous reviewers for the Press (who turned out to be not so anonymous), Margaret Chowning and Gilbert Joseph, provided perceptive and very helpful comments for revisions to writing, approach, and structure, most of which I acted upon, some of which I declined to make, but all of which were useful. A friend and highly skilled editor who helped me whip the entire collection into shape wishes not to be named, following his own deeply held professional standards, but he will recognize himself when he reads these pages. One of the essays in this volume, Chapter 4, has not appeared in print before, but I would nonetheless like to acknowledge John Coatsworth\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nfor commissioning it as a conference paper, and William Roger Louis, founding director of the National History Center, for sponsoring the event with the Center’s imprimatur.

My scholarly energies have been occupied since 2000 in researching and writing a biography of the early nineteenth-century Mexican statesman, entrepreneur, and historian Lucas Alamán (on whom more in a moment). On one level the logic of how this inquiry grew out of my previous research is fairly clear. At the suggestion of the eminent Mexican historian Enrique Florescano, my interest in Mexican rural history came to be focused on the colonial Guadalajara region for doctoral study. Where the interest itself had originated, I confess, is a mystery to me. While working on that project, my archival encounter with prolonged insurgent activity during 1810–1821 in the Lake Chapala basin, to the south of Guadalajara, especially among Indian villages, led me to a study of popular groups in the Mexican independence movement more generally. Finally, my reading of Alamán’s multivolume, magisterial, and deeply opinionated work on independence opened to an interest in the author and the way his political career was entwined with 1. This introductory essay is a somewhat more developed but heavily overlapping version of my introduction to Eric Van Young, Economía, política y cultura en la historia de México: Ensayos historiográficos, metodológicos y teóricos de tres décadas (San Luis Potosí: Colegio de San Luis Potosí/Colegio de la Frontera Norte/Colegio de Michoacán, 2010). I would like to acknowledge highly useful comments on several aspects of the collection from Margaret Chowning and Gil Joseph, who read the manuscript for Stanford University Press; Norris Pope at the Press for entertaining the notion that such a volume might be of value; and a generous subvention to aid in publication authorized by Arthur Ellis, vicechancellor for Research, University of California, San Diego, and help in obtaining it from John Marino, my colleague and sometime chair in the Department of History at UC San Diego. Acknowledgment of permission from various journals and presses for republication of the articles and chapters appears at the beginning of each essay.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe new nation whose movement for separation from the metropolis I had just studied and he had chronicled. There is another level in the logic of this progression no less clear to me, if perhaps less obvious to readers of my work, which follows a trajectory from economic history, to social and cultural history, to biography. This tracks a growing interest in what I would call “interiority”; that is, in people’s interior lives, especially their emotional and experiential processes, whether in groups or as individuals. This virtual obsession (for such it has become) was not on my horizon when I opted to study the Guadalajara region and the logic of regionality more generally, but emerged more and more clearly as I puzzled over how to interpret the actions and symbolic understandings of popular insurgents in my research on Mexican independence. I had moved, therefore, from the relatively impersonal, large-scale processes of economic history to the more intimate, often hidden dimension of culture and the dynamics of social groups in the context of collective political violence, albeit also on a large scale. Any reader familiar with my book on the popular sectors in the independence movement, The Other Rebellion: Popular Violence, Ideology and the Struggle for Mexican Independence, 1810–1821 (Stanford, 2001), will notice the attention I devote there to forms of internal mental life, psychopathology, collective manias, and even psychoanalytic approaches to history. From this cluster of interests I was drawn to a history of Mexican psychiatry from the late colonial period to 1930 or so, a study for which I began research but in which I never advanced beyond the publication of a single essay on the theme.2 Although biography as a form of writing history still remains quite retro in North American academia, it seemed to offer another route to the same sort of interiority I had hoped to explore in charting the delusional worlds of the mentally ill, but within the framework of political culture rather than psychopathology and the social intervention of state institutions in the lives of the mad. While the first two stages of this evolution are represented by the essays in this volume, the third is only hinted at and awaits the completion of my project on Lucas Alamán to be fully realized. My readers will perhaps indulge me, then, as I begin with a few thoughts on Alamán.\n\nletters and lives The age of electronic media and the personal computer has for most of us eclipsed the art, habit, and pleasure of writing letters on paper. The widespread practice in the Western world of corresponding in written 2.

During the last several centuries, the transmission of information in letters has served a variety of purposes. Especially for common people of some education, letters have facilitated the pursuit of love, the nourishing of friendship, the acquisition of wealth, and the exchange of scientific ideas and information. For states and powerful political actors the sending and receiving of letters have also underwritten the integration of polities, the administration of justice, the collection of taxes, and the advance of political, military, and colonial projects. For biographers and historians letters of all sorts (and, since at least the eighteenth century, newspapers) have proved to be one of the primary sources for reconstructing the past, and for the study of historical actors both humble and famous. Particularly within a cultural tradition deeply and intensely literate but little given to the publication of memoirs or autobiographies, such as that of the Spanish-speaking world, the survival of letters on paper is for the historian an essential point of entry into the private lives of public people.3 I have been especially struck with this in recent years as I have advanced through the archival phase of a biography of Lucas Alamán—polymath, political thinker, statesman, avatar of import substitution industrialization in Mexico, Panamericanist, codifier of Mexican conservatism, éminence gris behind the last dictatorship of Antonio López de Santa Anna, and arguably the greatest historian of ­nineteenth-century Mexico. Alamán himself observed in the early 1830s the lack of an autobiographical/memoirist tradition in the Spanish-­ speaking world more generally (his specific comparison was to France, but one may assume he had in mind Europe more widely), and lamented it as necessarily reducing the access of historians to the lives of past historical actors: The historical memoirs that form such an important branch of French literature have not up to now occupied writers in our Castilian language. Nonetheless, [such writings] not only provide important historical materials, but also at times [illuminate] history itself with the knowledge of events and the secret sources that produce them. . . . A wit said that memoirs present us with heroes en robe de chambre; that is, how they are inside their houses, while history [writing] offers them to us wearing armor or a blonde wig. And it is not rare to find that\n\n3. For a more developed discussion of the weakness of an autobiographical/memoirist tradition in the Hispanophone world, see Van Young (2002), and in the same number of the journal Secuencia the wide-ranging essay of Pablo Piccato (2002).\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nsomeone who appears grand in a ceremony is reduced to nothing when we see him naked.4\n\nWere it not for Alamán’s prolific letter writing (although relatively little of his personal, intimate correspondence seems to have survived), it would be almost impossible to reconstruct his thinking, his internal world, and his motives during a long public life.5 Apart from the mountains of correspondence he generated during his periods as a high official in the national government, there are clusters of quite revealing letters that tell us much about the man and the mind behind the rather aloof and certainly conservative public persona, even if they fall short of intimate self-­revelation. Among these are his exchanges in the early 1830s with his friend the political general Manuel Mier y Terán, in the years before Terán’s suicide; his brief exchange of letters with the American historian William H. Prescott in the 1840s; and his three-decade correspondence (stretching from the mid-1820s virtually up to the day of Alamán’s death in 1853) with the Duque de Terranova y Monteleone, the Neapolitan nobleman and heir to Fernando Cortés’s great entailed estate, the Marquesado del Valle, for whom Alamán served as political informant, business agent, adviser, and general factotum in Mexico. Also revealing were his occasional notes to and from Carlos María de Bustamante; the letters he exchanged with informants who provided information for him as he wrote his great history of Mexican independence in the late 1840s and early 1850s; and even his half-dozen or so surviving letters to and from Antonio López de Santa Anna, especially if one reads between the lines.6 While he was a great writer of letters, apart from scattered notes and a few fragmentary outlines Alamán seems to have kept no diaries or working notebooks about either his political activities, his business enterprises, or his historical writing, or at least none that have survived or come to light. 4.

Translations from Spanish here and elsewhere are mine. 5. The exception to this, apart from a rather formal and remarkably unrevelatory autobiographical sketch from the 1840s and the necrological essays published after his death in 1853, is the extremely interesting unfinished autobiographical fragment cited above, written during the 1830s and 1840s, that survives unpublished. There are, of course, biographical treatments of Alamán, and partial accounts of his life, thought, and public activities in many works. The last (and best) full-scale biography is that of Valadés (1938); and for a useful biographical summary, including a time line of Alamán’s life, see Morán Leyva (2002). 6. Most of this correspondence is to be found in Condumex and the Archivo General de la Nación (Mexico), Ramo Hospital de Jesús. One would hardly be aware of the magisterial status of Alamán’s great Historia de México from reading Enrique Florescano’s very accessible and often acute National Narratives in Mexico: A History (2006), in which Alamán’s work merits scarcely three sentences of discussion (pp. 310–11).\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nHis admirer and friendly correspondent, the contemporary American historian William H. Prescott, for example, did keep such notebooks, which have been published and make for mildly interesting reading, especially where the composition of his great historical works is concerned.7 Alamán’s working methods as a historian in gathering information are illustrated in his correspondence with informants, but his larger ideas about historical processes or anything approaching what we might think of as a philosophy of history do not show up in his letters. His increasingly Olympian and rather pessimistic view of Mexico’s history (and, by extension, of historical processes more generally) comes through most explicitly in some passages of his great Historia de México and must be extracted from that work. His view of how history writing was to be realized as a craft, on the other hand, is addressed in the autobiographical fragment of the 1830s that apparently formed the seed of the later published Historia.8 By contrast, a number of modern historians, especially in the Francophone and Anglophone traditions, have left not only ample collections of published correspondence, but also autobiographies.9 The more formal, self-­conscious concern with producing treatises on how to write history seems by and large to be a modern tendency, mostly of the twentieth century, when history as a distinct academic discipline separated itself more clearly from a belle-lettristic tradition, although there are some notable earlier exceptions. To continue with the Alamán theme for a moment, the strong influence of public circumstances—the political instability in Mexico during the decades following independence, and the war with the United States, for example—and the disappointments of his own life (the failure of several business enterprises, his long semiexile from the center of national political life, and the death of several of his children, common enough though such personal losses were at the time) seem to have tempered his earlier positive views about the significance of human agency in history. These ideas could never at best have been characterized as “optimistic,” and what he may well have thought of as failures in many areas of his life and that of his country led him to the cool, rather melancholic pronouncements at the close of his Historia de México toward the end of his life. Take, for example, his view of the historian’s task at the beginning of his autobiographical fragment, apparently written in the early 1830s. Here he began 7.

Some recent well-known examples from the Anglophone world are Schlesinger (2000) and Hobsbawm (2002); on historians’ autobiographies in general, see Popkin (2005). Closer to home for readers of Mexican history is the revealing autobiographical essay of Brading (2007).\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nto approach the writing of political history, which occupied his attention throughout his life as a writer, almost from the point of view of a social historian, allowing much room in the course of history itself for chance, and even the play of ludic elements. Near the passage quoted above he penned some thoughts on the historian’s craft that are worth quoting at some length, I think: Frequently the greatest events depend upon [such] small, even ridiculous causes that the gravity of history would be offended by presenting them in all their details; nonetheless, it is through these details that we come to know men. . . . And although history should make us know them in all their aspects, there are still in almost all great actions small circumstances, perhaps unfavorable to the person who figures [in those events], that the historian and the writer of tragedies try to dress with the majestic clothing with which they dress their heroes, while the memoirist and the comic poet strive to present them in the nude, and even sometimes with malignity.10\n\nAlamán took up his pen again in the early 1840s to advance the memoir, a decade or so after he had begun it, but by then the work itself had mutated from a more personal account to a larger-scale, more selfconsciously historical one (tellingly, from “Una memoria de mi vida” to “Una memoria de mis tiempos”) and had become a sort of predraft of what some years later would come to be the Historia de México.11 The earlier, almost lighthearted tone of the lines just quoted had given way to a much darker, more fatalistic vision reflected in the later sections of the “Memoria,” in which Alamán wrote of . . . the great revolutions that have lifted from nothing those nations that have come to be lords of a great part of the world, and which give origin with their destruction to other nations that in the impenetrable order of providence have played a part in their time, suffering [in their turn] the same vicissitudes. But there is the force of circumstance, and such conjunctures of these that compel the will. . . . There are [many] examples of these verities demonstrated on every page of history. . . . And so it is that the form of the world changes ceaselessly, empires and nations succeeding each other, with no human power sufficient to impede it.12\n\n10. “Memorias de D. Lucas Alamán.” 11. The titles of the two works bear a striking similarity: that of the early 1830s and early 1840s, given to the work in 1843, is “Memorias de D. Lucas Alamán, Ministro de Relaciones exteriores e interiores de la República Megicana en diversas épocas. En las que se contiene la verdadera historia de esta República desde el año de 1808 en que comenzaron la inquietudes que condujeron a su independencia hasta el año de 1843. Escritas por el mismo”; whereas the complete title of the great published work we know by its abbreviated title of the Historia de México is Historia de México desde los primeros movimientos que produjeron su independenia en el año de 1808, hasta la presente época. 12. “Memorias de D. Lucas Alamán.”\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nAnd by the time Alamán came to write the concluding passages of the Historia a decade later still, he famously voiced the doubt as to whether a nation called Mexico had ever existed at all, whether there were any Mexicans, and by implication whether Mexico could come to exist in future. The focus had narrowed here from the history of nations and revolutions in general to that of Mexico in particular, but the vision is no less dark.\n\nthe essays My research in recent years on the life of Lucas Alamán has stimulated me to think not only about the nature of historical sources, but also about my own career as a historian as refracted through my studies of Alamán’s historical methods and writings. The modern world would not be poorer for the destruction of my particular correspondence (most of which, in any case, has for some time taken the form of electronic mail and therefore has a short half-life), or the lack of any autobiography that hubris might tempt me to write. It would have been of enormous value to our understanding of Alamán’s life, the history of Mexican letters, and even to the profile of early nineteenth-century political thought in the Atlantic world, on the other hand, had he (or someone) preserved his personal correspondence in a systematic way, and even more so had he finished his autobiography.13 The publication of the present volume of essays, however, provides me with an occasion both welcome and sobering to consider my own evolution as a historian whose life experience—not easily separable from my writing of history—was shaped by the late twentieth century, and by personal circumstance, no less than Lucas Alamán’s was by the early nineteenth century and the events of his life. It is a welcome occasion because one does not often have the opportunity to commit to paper thoughts on one’s relationship to one’s own work in a relatively formal way that may be read by other people, however few. And it is a sobering occasion for much the same reason, since in the process of remembering and organizing such recollections, one may not only invent things, but also realize how many gaps there are in one’s own account of oneself, not to mention that even putting such thoughts into print constitutes an embarrassing act of narcissism. In framing this collection of essays it might be useful for me to offer some observations on the historian’s craft, at least as I have practiced it, in addition to placing the essays in the context of my own historical research on Mexico and of how the field of 13. Some of Alamán’s political, business, and even personal correspondence is published in Aguayo Spencer (1945, vols. 10 and 12).\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nMexican history has evolved over the last three decades or so. With the patient indulgence of my readers, I take the opportunity to do so now, although the emphasis is more on contextualizing the essays published here and explaining why they were written when they were, than on offering any lectures about the discipline, or offering up personal confessionals.14 A good place to begin such reflections, perhaps, is with an earlier volume of my essays that appeared in 1992 under the title La crisis del orden colonial: Estructura agraria y rebeliones populares de la Nueva España, 1750–1821, all but one of them published previously.15 With a couple of exceptions those were all substantive rather than historiographical essays; that is, they dealt with aspects of history itself rather than the ways in which history is written by professional historians, with conceptual tools that historians employ, or with the state of historical research on Mexico. Five of the essays looked back to work I had done on the agrarian history of the Guadalajara area (see Chapter 1 in this volume), while four of them looked ahead to a book I was then writing on popular groups in the Mexican independence struggle, and came to be integrated more or less into that work, published in 2001, considerably later than I had optimistically predicted in 1992.16 In the introduction to the 1992 collection I basically discussed the theme of the materialist interpretation of history versus a culturalist approach, and more specifically which of these might offer the most apt conceptual tools for looking at the participation of common people, mostly indigenous peasant villagers, in the struggle for Mexican independence. This foreshadowed a major concern of mine in the intervening years that forms a major thematic axis in the present volume—the promise and limits of cultural history, and the relationship of cultural to economic history. The basic question for me then, as even now, was whether subaltern participation in the decade-long insurgency that sundered New Spain from the metropolis is most convincingly described as a massive agrarian rebellion, or as a movement to assert localist and ethnic identities, and to preserve the cultural practices associated with them. According to the first scenario, agrarian rebellion would have arisen from material deprivation due to economic conditions in the Mexi14. I have made some brief autobiographical notes that address my personal background, and to some degree my development as a historian, in Van Young (2007b). 15. Van Young (1992c). Of the eleven essays in that volume, only one is reproduced here (Chapter 5; chap. 3 in the original version). All the other essays in this volume were published after 2000, except Chapter 6, “The Cuautla Lazarus” (1993) and Chapter 7, “The New Cultural History Comes to Old Mexico” (1999). 16.

According to the second, an explanatory scheme in a more cultural register would take into account popular, especially indigenous, impulses to vindicate some sort of political rights, assert ethnic identity in the face of late colonial pressures toward homogenization, and defend village communities. These diminutive polities were bounded by Indianness, a distinct ritual cycle, lifestyle, and a diminished subjecthood signified under the colonial regime by ethnic prejudice, differential tax obligations, legal disabilities, and so forth. Looking back now on the introduction to my 1992 volume of essays, it seems to me that my answer to the question I had posed was ambivalent. The ambivalence arose from a growing realization that there exists a salutary but irresolvable tension between materialist and culturalist explanatory frameworks, and between structure and agency in human history. Chapter 7 in this volume, “The New Cultural History Comes to Old Mexico” (originally published in 1999), deepened that discussion in exploring the limits and achievements of cultural history, and the dynamics of its ascendancy during the decades of the 1980s and 1990s in historical writing on colonial Mexico. A number of my colleagues and other readers found the essay to be highly tentative in its assertion of the claims of cultural history, and agnostic about its accomplishments and potential. This opinion surprised me, since I had thought at the time (and still do) that I was merely offering a number of sensible reservations about the writing of cultural history rather than expressing tepidity about its value, or voicing skepticism about whether it can be done at all. In reading this essay my readers may want to revisit the 1999 issue of the Hispanic American Historical Review (HAHR) in which the article first appeared along with several other contributions by accomplished historians of modern Mexico addressing the same issues.17 Ambivalence is not necessarily symmetrical, however, and my ambivalence some years earlier, in the 1992 introductory essay, leaned somewhat toward the materialist end of the spectrum, as suggested by my citation of an anecdote putatively involving the English philosopher Bertrand Russell, an elderly woman in one of his lecture audiences, and a turtle, while the 1999 essay leans in the opposite direction.18 The final point I was trying to make in 17. Specifically with relation to my book on Mexican Independence, some of the issues about cultural history as exemplified in that work are addressed in my extended exchange with Alan Knight, originally published in Historia Mexicana and republished in booklet form as En torno a La otra rebelión by El Colegio de México in the series “Miradas a la historia” (Van Young and Knight 2007). 18. Since that anecdote may not be familiar to my present readers, let me quote integrally\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\ninvoking that story at the close of my 1992 introductory essay is that however many layers of ideology, culture, mentality, or language one peels back, there must always be a layer of materiality underneath them, basically an economically determined framework of class relations. Certainly this is true in a commonsense way, since we apprehend our surroundings through our senses, which constantly remind us at the most basic level of the world’s materiality. Thus our own experience demonstrates to us the barrier that materiality interposes to our understanding of history through the basic fact that people are distinct physical beings whose internal mental processes, as mediated to the world by language and act, are at best only imperfectly accessible to their fellow beings. It is a major part of the historian’s job, however, to try to transcend this separateness and make sense of the disparate narratives, and the points of view they represent, which form the basis of historical accounts. This is a rather conservative position these days—that there is an actual object (an event, a person) to be apprehended at the center of historical narratives, or where a number of narratives converge—although most practicing historians seem to hold this view, or at least write history as though they do. In my 1992 introductory essay I invoked the term “culture” just three times, twice as a noun, once as an adjective, and wrote about “collective behavior” rather than culture; that is, about action rather than belief. By the time the introductory chapter of my book on independence, The Other Rebellion, was written in the late 1990s, my ideas about the relationship of culture and the forces of material life to collective political violence had changed considerably, tending ever more in the direction of culture and away from traditional models emphasizing relative deprivation and class relations as the wellsprings of action. When exactly the change in my thinking occurred eludes me now. While this reorientation in my approach to writing history was of course in part impelled by the intellectual currents around me in the 1990s (the general subject of Chapters 3, 6, and 7 in this volume), it also grew out of an encounter with the archives. This recapitulated my experience of some two decades earlier, in the early 1970s, when I was beginning the research for what eventually became my first book, on the agrarian history of the Guadalajara region here the paragraph in which it appears: “A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: ‘What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.’ The scientist gave a superior smile, replying, ‘What is the tortoise standing on?’ ‘You’re very clever young man, very clever,’ said the old lady. ‘But it’s turtles all the way down!’” (Hawking 1988, 1).\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nin the late colonial period (Chapter 1 of this volume is now the introduction to the second edition of that book). On that occasion, however, my shift had been in the opposite direction, away from social history and its larger penumbra, and toward economic history. Influenced by my reading in European rural history (especially the French historians Marc Bloch, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, and Pierre Goubert, but also English scholars such as Joan Thirsk, R. H. Tawney, and others), my original ambition had been to write a social history of a regionally delimited rural society, but I found that the archives did not readily yield the sort of data I felt was required; or at least I did not have the conceptual tools to squeeze the sources in order to extract social history from them. So in a sense I fell back on economic history; Chapter 1 in this volume is in part an updated survey of the background to that shift, and Chapter 2 is one of its sequelae. As I gravitated toward economic history, moreover, I also became more aware of the debates of the time regarding dependency theory, a body of empirical studies that I have never seen as very theoretical, but simply as instantiating obvious statements about economic asymmetries between societies, and about modes of extraction of surplus value. My book about the haciendas of the Guadalajara area in the late colonial period, therefore, with its emphasis on coherence and change in regional systems of production, consumption, and exchange became a sort of antidependency case study. My writing on Mexican regions and the nature of regionality more generally, represented here by Chapter 5, grew out of this.19 My methodological, conceptual, and interpretive reorientation of the 1990s, as I have suggested, moved in the opposite direction, away from economic history, toward social and cultural history. The original plan for my book The Other Rebellion, in fact, had been to examine the popular insurgency of 1810–1821 using three regional case studies of economic change in the late colonial period—the Guadalajara, ­Cuernavaca, and Huasteca regions. I anticipated that such a study would support the hypothesis that the intersection of rural population growth, agricultural commercialization by large estates in response to increasing urban demand, growing land shortages in the peasant sector, falling living standards for common people, and increased taxation spurred by the Bourbon Reforms had combined to produce a situation of material deprivation in the Mexican countryside. These changes occurred within a structure of marked class and ethnic differentiation that pushed humble people into rebellious alliance with the Creole directorate of the independence movement under the covering ideology of protonationalism, a providentialist 19. Van Young (1992c), and my introductory essay in that volume, pp. 1–36.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nnarrative (the banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe), and a virulent antigachupín sentiment shared by commoners and members of the elite alike. This approach would have produced a study similar in many respects to those of John Tutino, Brian Hamnett, or more recently the Mexican scholar Carlos Herrero Bervera, among others.20 While there is much to be said for this scheme, and while a substantial residue of it remains in The Other Rebellion (especially in Chapter 3), I found it wholly inadequate to explain what I was encountering in the archives. In other words, one might say that while the deprivation model of subaltern political action, and more generally a materialist interpretation of the independence movement were true, they were certainly not only true, perhaps not even primarily true, and definitely not interestingly true (to me, at least). It would have been extremely difficult if not impossible, for example, to account with reference to material conditions alone for elements of messianic thinking among popular rebels. Similarly, the political choreography of village riot during the insurgency, the forms of spatial mobility and boundaries in the participation of indigenous villagers, the nature of violence and its objects, and the very different responses to the insurgency of rural people who shared the same material conditions were not easily explained without according culture a more central role in collective political action. To marginalize such apparently anomalous speech acts and behaviors (anomalous only if one tries to extrude them through a rigid materialist grid) as forms of “false consciousness” or hegemonic cooptation would have been to discount deeply the historical actors’ own versions of their reality, and thus foreclose the possibility of a much more nuanced and interesting account of Mexican independence. It would be possible, I suppose, to dismiss the belief of the Lazarus of Cuautla (see Chapter 6 in this volume) that he could be raised from the dead by Father Morelos and his miraculous child as a sort of inconvenient excrescence of his relationship to the means of production; but it would relegate to the dustbin of history his own view of how otherworldly and mundane forces were related to each other, substituting our version for his, and in the process impoverishing our understanding of the ways common people understood their world. Then, too, I found there to be little evidence that ordinary people had material conditions in mind when they took up arms, little indication that they consistently attacked their masters as economic oppressors, and little sign of a program to remedy agrarian grievances or redress imbalances of wealth. All this turned me in the direction of a 20. Tutino (1986), Hamnett (1985), and Herrero Bervera (2001); and see Chapter 4 in this volume for a survey of Independence historiography and the way it has changed over the last several decades.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ncultural interpretation of popular rebellion, especially among rural indigenous people, and I even went so far as to place cultural factors—issues of identity, community, ethnicity, and religious sensibility—ahead of material ones, thus reversing the normally presumed direction of causal arrows from the material to the cultural, depicting them instead as moving from the cultural to the material.21 The change in my own thinking about the wellsprings of collective action would not be especially interesting were it not for the fact that it exemplifies larger shifts in the practice of history during the last thirty years or so, at least among Anglophone historians. Many of the essays republished here constitute an exploration of this theme, of the shift from more materialist to more culturalist approaches, within a historiographic framework. The arc of this trend in the way Mexican and Latin American history more generally has been approached in the United States (and to some extent in Mexico, although less robustly even now) can be followed beginning with my essay of 1979, “Recent Anglophone History” (not included in this volume), in which I suggested that the older forms of political and institutional history that dominated the middle decades of the twentieth century had given way to economic and social history, a shift I traced in the changing vocabulary of historical work. Where once the titles of monographs and of articles in the Hispanic American Historical Review, for example, spoke of boundaries, treaties, parties, wars, and so forth, by the late 1960s they were likely to feature such terms as socioeconomic, stratification, and elites. The atrophying of economic history among Anglophone scholars, with a few exceptions—although it is much stronger, indeed even thriving in Mexico today—was accompanied through the 1990s by the consolidation of cultural history, developments traced in Chapters 3, 6, and 7 in this volume. Having temporarily abandoned economic history (I think of myself as a recovering economic historian), by the way, for the seductions of social and cultural history, and now returned to economic history with my work on economic thinker and entrepreneur Lucas Alamán, I have come to see as unfortunate the decline of economic history among Anglophone historians of Latin America, and especially of Mexico. I nonetheless issued an evangelistic call for the colonization of economic by cultural history in Chapter 7. I give two main reasons for this intellectual move. In the first place, I make the case that human beings spend so much time getting and spending that economic activities must be the sites of meaning production and expressive practices that are the major arenas of interest for 21. For some examples of this approach, in addition to my book on Mexican independence, see Van Young (1995b, 2009a).\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\ncultural historians. In the second place, even with the interesting shift in interest among some economic historians to the institutional frameworks suggested by the work of Douglass North, I think it useful to explore the notion that institutions do not arise from a vacuum, but reflect the cultural substrate of a given society—religious ideas, normative values, systems of gender practice, and so on. I have since climbed down off this soap box with a partial and implicit mea culpa, however, in essays not included in this collection and in the form of private reservations about the hegemony cultural history has come to exercise over the field.22 My own feeling these days is that cultural history in the absence of economic context is just as likely to render a distorted view of its object as is economic history (or political history, for that matter) extracted from its cultural context. There are of course practical limits to what the individual scholar can do—limits of time, documentation, theoretical preparation, personal interest, the dynamics of academic careers—that make this ecumenism a counsel of perfection. Some of my readers may find in all this navelgazing and shilly-shallying evidence of a failure of intellectual nerve, while I prefer to think of my reservations as the product of a healthy skepticism and of a lifelong tendency to be eclectic rather than doctrinaire. Let me return to the theme of culture. Now, it is true that not everyone means the same thing when they talk about “cultural history” as both an object of inquiry and an approach. My own definition would focus on what we might call the economy of symbolic exchange, the arenas of collective representation and discourse, and such matters as religious belief, individual and collective identity, gender relations, the forms in which belonging to a community is expressed, and other ways in which people organize their relationship to the material and human worlds around them, and endow those objects and relationships with meaning. It seems to me that “meaning” is the central category of cultural history—it is the honey in the hive, the nut in the shell, the emotional resonance of the song, the memory or analogy evoked by a smell, a touch, a sound, an image. Since meaning is therefore a relational property—it valorizes one thing by reference to another—and there may be a number of distinct meanings attached to a behavior, a belief, or a symbol, cultural history can get pretty complicated and messy in adding an entirely unseen but inferred layer of connections to any historical scene. This is even more obviously the case when a number of historical actors are involved. Take, for example, the land suit, one of the classic sorts of behavior that colonial historians use to reconstruct past realities. From a purely materialist point of view what 22. In addition to my essay “De razones y regiones” cited above, interested readers may consult Van Young (2003c).\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nis at issue when a peasant village is pitted in litigation against a private landowner or a neighboring village is encapsulated in the need for peasants to accumulate funds for subsistence, ceremonial rites, and reproduction (seed to plant the next crop); to pay their rents and taxes; and to pass on property to the next generation, however little it may be. Symbolically, however, the piece of land being fought over may “mean” more than its economic value now or in the future. The geographical location of the land—a modest milpa (cornfield), let us say—may have significance because of where it is in relation to a cave, a stream, an ancient tree, or some sacral site. Apart from its productive capacity, access to land itself may signify belonging to a community, a lineage, or some other social grouping. Control over a piece of property may entail strongly gendered aspects, such as the right to marry and establish an independent household, the passage from youth to adulthood, or the support for patriarchal dominance over women, other family members, or non-kin dependents. And those “meanings” are only projected by one party in the equation, and may be reflected, mirrorlike, in the unspoken or even unconscious mental realm of the contending party to the litigation. It will be noticed that this very broad (critics might even say flaccid) definition is by no means class-specific; that is, it does not suggest that the study of cultural history need be limited to those social groups that leave written records, or are the producers and consumers of the literary artifacts of a given society. The way I myself have practiced it, the boundaries of cultural history clearly embrace social groups not inscribed in the historical record, which embraces most of the population in most societies during most of history, although one always faces the issue of limited or ambiguous sources in dealing with subaltern groups. Nor should cultural history, in my view, be limited explicitly to expressive realms of human activity such as celebratory life, religion, or ritual, but should map a huge geography including everyday life and activities not perhaps universally regarded as the territory of the “cultural.”23 By the same token, cultural history is strongly linked to local knowledges in the sense propounded so powerfully (and sometimes opaquely) by cultural anthropologists such as the late Clifford Geertz. Nor does cultural history in any way exclude economic life except by convention, a point I have made above and at some length in Chapter 7, in which, in particular, I try to develop the point that although the institutional approach to economic history associated with Douglass North and his followers has somewhat loosened the grip of neoclassical 23. I have dealt with issues of definition and delimitation in a number of essays in addition to those included in this collection, among them the conclusions of at least two volumes of essays: Van Young (1994a, 2001a).\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nmodels on economic history, it is arguable that institutions themselves are the products not only of contingent historical conditions, but also of underlying cultural templates that express pervasive social values as well as instrumentalist ideas about the frameworks of economic action. I have alluded in passing to the differences in the way the history of Mexico is written in Mexico and in the United States, or in the wider Anglophone world, for that matter; cultural history exemplifies one of these, although it is becoming increasingly difficult to generalize about it. Another difference, at least until a few years ago, would have been the application of Marxist theory to the writing of history, which was never strongly established among Anglophone historians of Mexico in particular or Latin America more generally (although dependency theory was), while it seems to me that it flourished in Mexico. These differences, however, are not restricted to theoretical approaches. They are also very noticeable with regard to certain themes, although the treatment of the themes also takes place within prevailing models of what effective history writing looks like, and these can be very distinct in Mexico and the Anglophone world. This is the subject of Chapter 4, which deals in a necessarily abbreviated way with the Anglophone and Hispanophone historiographies of Mexican independence. The essay traces the textual and ideological genealogy of writing on the insurgency of 1810, touching on some of the great canonical works produced by nineteenth-century Mexican scholarship, moving into the twentieth century, and ending with a long section on how the trends in United States historiography in recent decades have influenced how the history of independence is written there, and in what ways this literature differs from what Mexican scholars have produced during the same period. Apart from the early pages in this introduction, discussing my work in progress on Lucas Alamán, and Chapter 6, which is essentially a methodological essay about interpreting ambiguous source texts so as not to lose their cultural importance, Chapter 4 is the only essay in the volume that deals directly with my research interest of the 1980s and 1990s, the rebellion of 1810–1821. Let me close with a word about the ways in which the essays have, and have not, been revised from their original forms.24 Some repetitions between the original essays—identical passages and close paraphrases— have been eliminated. There have also been some changes in titles and 24. Throughout this volume published works are cited social science style, with the author’s last name and the date of publication in parentheses, either within the text or in the endnotes. I have done this to avoid cluttering the text unduly and to keep the length of the book within reasonable limits. Readers are encouraged to consult the unified bibliography at the end of the volume.\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nother minor adjustments for the sake of clarity of exposition. This still leaves two potential problems that might well crop up in any such collection of essays authored by one scholar over the span of nearly twentyfive years: the age of some of the chapters, and overlap among them. Overlap occurs primarily between the first two chapters and the last one. Chapter 1 was written during 2004–5 as a historiographical update encompassing works on the colonial, and to some degree the nineteenthcentury, Mexican hacienda since the initial publication in 1981 of the book ­Hacienda and Market in Eighteenth-Century Mexico, and my 1983 article “Mexican Rural History since Chevalier: The Historiography of the Colonial Hacienda,” not reprinted in this volume although it has appeared in several other venues over the years. While the historical research on the colonial landed estate was just cresting in the early 1980s and dropped off sharply in quantity over the ensuing years, a great deal of work was still to appear. There is comparatively little overlap or cross talk between Chapter 1 and the 1983 article, therefore, except for purposes of setting a framework for the newer essay. But what there is in Chapter 1, I have chosen for the most part to leave in place so as not to disrupt the continuity between what should finally be seen as “Part I” and “Part II” of the same project, much in the way that movies sometimes spawn sequels. The overlap between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 is substantial but contained. My account of the Spanish American highland hacienda literature in Chapter 2, an essay written around 2006–7, constitutes about one-third of the text, relies substantially on Chapter 1 for that part, and is meant to provide an opening into a broader discussion of Latin American rural history parallel to extended treatments of export economies and slave-based sugar plantations. Excising the hacienda section of this chapter would be like removing one leg of a three-legged stool—the entire thing would topple over. Thus I have left that section of Chapter 2 largely as it is, not out of indolence but rather a concern for coherence and breadth. On the other hand, what was to have been Chapter 8 in this volume, an essay titled “The Meeting of Economic and Cultural History,” was a sort of narrowed development of the earlierwritten Chapter 7, but a conceptual extension rather than a historiographical one. The two essays were written five or six years apart, the second after further reading, and after my own deeper experience with cultural history had fermented a bit conceptually in the writing of my book The Other Rebellion and several essays. However, my thinking on these issues is not so profound that it needs to be preserved intact, like an ancient papyrus or a Shakespeare first edition; thus I have incorporated much of the conceptual pursuit of the points of encounter between economic and cultural history as portrayed in the erstwhile Chapter 8 into\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe current Chapter 7. Similarly, while I gave some thought to the possibility of publishing Chapter 5, on Mexican regions, in its original form, I finally decided to incorporate much of the material from a later essay on regionalism and regionality (Van Young 1992b). This makes for a considerably longer, more complex essay. In the end my readers will judge whether these overlaps and emendations produce synergy or just tedium.\n\nchapter 1\n\nWaves and Ripples Studies of the Mexican Hacienda since 1980\n\n; In an astute, wide-ranging analysis of Mexico’s social and economic problems published on the very eve of the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the ­jurist, writer, and agrarian reformer Andrés Molina Enríquez produced the somewhat gnomic, oft-quoted statement, “La hacienda no es ­negocio” (The hacienda is not a business).1 By this he meant that the Mexican landed estate was in general not profit oriented, probably not capitalistic, and certainly not modern, but a “feudal” legacy of the Spanish colonial past. At the very moment he wrote, however, capital-­ intensive Mexican- and foreign-owned agricultural interests were in some regions of the country producing tropical crops for export (fiber, coffee, bananas), as well as more traditional agropastoral products (meat, wheat, maize) primarily for domestic markets. Molina Enríquez’s characterization proved more accurate in some areas of the country, among them tracts of the arid north (although some large estates in this region 1. Andrés Molina Enríquez, Los grandes problemas nacionales (1909). Molina Enríquez (1865–1940) was actually imprisoned briefly by the revolutionary government of Francisco I. Madero for having launched his own radically agrarista rebellion under the Plan of Texcoco. His ideas were central to President Carranza’s 1915 agrarian decree, and also to the famous Article 27 of Mexico’s 1917 constitution, later used as the basis for the expropriation of hacienda lands and in many parts of the country the creation of ejidos, the collective agricultural holdings partially dismantled under the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s. On his life and thought, see Shadle (1994). A number of writers on the Mexican hacienda besides me have used Molina Enríquez as a whipping boy to dispute the older view of the feudal estate; among them are Brading (1978); Miller (1995); Nickel (1997); Langue (1998); and Chevalier (1999). I want to acknowledge my own former doctoral student, Javier Villa-Flores, of the Departments of Latin American Studies and History, University of Illinois-Chicago, for research assistance with this essay that went far beyond bibliographic compilation, and also an eleventh-hour reading of my text by Paul Vanderwood.\n\n22\n\nPart I\n\nof Mexico produced cattle and other livestock for export and domestic consumption), the more isolated zones of the west coast, and the Indian south outside henequen-, coffee-, cacao-, vanilla-, and sugar-producing areas. In these places the insertion of the hacienda into local, regional, and international markets was much shallower, capital investment and economic rationalization were at much lower levels, and social relations of production were largely untransformed from older practices, including debt peonage. To the extent that the Mexican Revolution of 1910 was an agrarian upheaval, much modern scholarship would ascribe it to the social and economic stresses generated by growing commercialization and modernization in large-scale agriculture, while other scholars would see the Mexican countryside of that era, and the hacienda within it, as feudal and backward in much the same way that Molina Enríquez did. The apparent internal contradiction in the central institution of Mexican rural life—that in some incarnations the hacienda could look feudal and in others highly commercialized, even capitalistic—did not originate in the nineteenth or twentieth century, however, but found its origin in the colonial period. It is therefore with the colonial period, and to some degree with the nineteenth century, that one must begin to construct a genealogy of land-labor regimes in Mexican history, and the ways in which these have affected virtually all spheres of life up to the present, even as the Mexico of the twenty-first century continues becoming year by year less rural and more urban, less peasant and more industrial, less “traditional” and more “modern.” The extended scholarly debate in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s over the nature of the Mexican hacienda (and large landed estates elsewhere in Latin America) and the institution’s place in rural society, often still framed today in terms of a capitalist versus a feudal model, deeply influenced historical writing on Mexico in general and on the colonial period in particular.2 There emerged in this extensive literature a number of important questions, still to some degree unresolved today, about colonial landlabor regimes and the legacy they bequeathed to Mexico and the other nations of Latin America. As research advanced, for example, the hacienda began to look a lot less feudal as an agrosocial unit (that is, a place where rural people both lived and worked simultaneously) than previously imag2. A recent synthetic-interpretive treatment of Latin American history, for example, affirms the supplanting of “medieval” (that is, feudal) forms of economic organization by “capitalist” ones only in the late eighteenth century; see Voss (2002, xii). For a useful review of the feudalism versus capitalism debate as focused on the Mexican colonial hacienda, see Knight (2002b), who spends a good many pages (especially 72–83, 185–201) discussing this hoary controversy. He finds that while the ideal-typical hacienda of the colonial period may have been commercialized, it was not capitalistic in any meaningful sense of the term.\n\nChapter 1\n\n23\n\nined. Nor was this a purely academic debate: there were political stakes involved, especially outside Mexico, in Latin American countries that had yet to experience anything resembling an agrarian political revolution. For if the “traditional” rural estate was capitalist (or proto-, quasi-, or even cryptocapitalist) from its inception in the sixteenth century, rather than feudal, then the emergence of a bourgeois order and the ensuing social revolution that must inevitably follow in its wake were not as distant as Marxist thinkers of radical tendency might once have feared. Empirical studies of the colonial hacienda uncovered in the institution an economic dynamism and a social polymorphism suggesting that it was in fact sensitive to changing market and labor conditions, and to the availability of capital, rather than a fly trapped in the amber of seigneurial tradition. Even the most market-oriented haciendas in the late colonial decades often relied in part on coerced labor, however, retaining a strongly paternalistic social organization and equally paternalistic labor practices, and therefore presumably a precapitalist character. This is quite apart, of course, from sugar plantations, concentrated in the ­Morelos lowlands to the south of Mexico City but also scattered in pockets elsewhere throughout the colony, which relied upon a core labor force of African slaves while still producing a highly commercialized commodity for the domestic market. We are thus faced with the apparent paradox of commercial economic organization and feudal/paternalist social organization, a theoretical anomaly but a manifest historical reality. It is also necessary to keep in mind that the large landed estate did not exist alone in the colonial countryside, in a moonlike landscape devoid of other population concentrations or other types of production units. Rather, it ­cohabited—sometimes symbiotically, often conflictually—with small towns, semidependent or independent family holdings (often called ranchos), and most importantly with landholding indigenous communities. Certainly the terms of this conflict have increasingly been studied, from informal to litigated contention over land and other resources, through everyday forms of subaltern resistance (including some forms of criminality), to small-scale riot and rebellion, and finally widespread popular insurgency, as exemplified by the Mexican independence movement (1810–1821) and the Mexican Revolution of 1910 that followed it by exactly one century.3 Since the initial publication of my book on the haciendas of the Guadalajara region (Van Young 1981; revised 2006a), one of the most obvious 3. For a still unsurpassed discussion of the relationship of Latin American banditry to forms of peasant resistance, framed in historiographic terms, see Joseph (1992). Banditry is, however, a highly ambiguous activity, and scholars such as Paul Vanderwood (1992) have made a convincing case that bandits sought to force their way into the prevailing social regime rather than resist it.\n\n24\n\nPart I\n\ntendencies in historical writing on colonial and nineteenth-century rural Mexico has been a shift in focus from the hacienda as an economic and social institution, which drew the attention of scholars for three decades or so, to the forms of political conflict, the technologies of power, the configuration of large regional societies, the long-term macro­economic trends, the repertoires of social distinction (among them ethnicity and the constitution of elite family networks), and even the cultural contexts that the traditional landed estate was in large measure instrumental in shaping, and in which it therefore came to be embedded. This shift in focus was partly the result of broader positive changes in the discipline of history, among these its “anthropologization.” By this I mean the bleeding over into history of concepts and questions derived from its cousin discipline—questions about symbolic systems and culture, for example, or the tendency to see powerful groups of landholding elites not only in terms of genealogies and intergenerational property transfers, but also in terms of kinship systems, kinship ideology, and elite social reproduction.4 There were also negative changes, however, including an unfortunate decline in interest in economic history, at least in the United States.5 As I noted in a 1983 review article about the hacienda literature, the change was also possibly due in part to the apprehension of scholars that in undertaking more studies about the traditional landed estate, especially at the level of the individual enterprise, they were tending to repeat an exercise at which they had already become adept, with the addition of each case study learning more and more about less and less (Van Young 1983). The wave of historical studies of Mexican landed estates beginning with François Chevalier’s pathbreaking 1952 work on colonial haciendas waned in the early 1980s, giving way to a hiatus in this literature that has continued until very recently.6 While there has occurred something of a 4. For discussions of the theoretical and methodological issues between history and anthropology, see, for example, Hunt (1989b); Ohnuki-Tierney (1990); Axel (2002). 5. For some discussion of the interaction of these currents, especially within the context of the rise of cultural history for the colonial period, see Van Young (1999), and Chapter 7 in this volume, where I make the suggestion that cultural history should “colonize” economic history; a withering riposte to the entire cultural history project is offered by a distinguished economic historian in Haber (1999). Alan Knight (2002c) finds strengths and flaws in both approaches. For the relationship between economic and cultural history, see Van Young (2003c), and Chapter 7 in this volume. On the other hand, anthropologists do maintain something of an interest in the Mexican hacienda, as exemplified by a recent special number of the journal Ethnohistory (Alexander 2003) devoted to the theme “Beyond the Hacienda: Agrarian Relations and Socioeconomic Change in Rural Mesoamerica,” to which I contributed a commentary (Van Young 2003a). For an overview of the changes that have occurred in the field of Mexican colonial history during the last three decades or so, see Van Young (2004b). 6. Arnold J. Bauer (1998) has made this same observation in a review article devoted to works on the history of the Mexican countryside. In his view the cycle of Mexican hacienda\n\nChapter 1\n\n25\n\nresurgence of interest in agrarian structures in the pre-1910 countryside, much of it has been in the hands of anthropologists and ethnohistorians, and much of it has focused on the historical interplay of class and ethnicity rather than exclusively on the conflictual relations between haciendas and indigenous communities (for some early examples, see Wasserstrom 1983 and Schryer 1990), let alone the economic history of the haciendas themselves. Some of the impulse behind this newer approach may be traced to the internal logic of investigation, by which the more accessible sources used by an earlier generation of researchers who concentrated on the economic aspects of the great estate (account books, records of litigation, notary records) gave way to more fragmentary and difficult sources (local tax returns and census documents, parish records, and the like) or to rereadings of familiar documents in a new light (e.g., Van Young 1996). Then, too, the growing maturity of ethnohistory as a hybrid discipline (this is where the “anthropologization” of history comes through most clearly), heavily historical in method and subject but anthropological in conceptual framework (e.g., Radding 1997), has brought new sets of questions to bear on established economic, political, and sociocultural themes. Finally, the convergence of subaltern studies with ideas about the agency of common people as historical actors and shapers of their own destinies has redirected the gaze of scholars to arenas in which people formerly seen only as objects—of labor exploitation, of resource appropriation, of social domination—are reimagined as subjects: subsistence farmers, petty commodity producers, consumers, participants in markets, strugglers over local forms of power, religious celebrants, and above all as resisters, rioters, and rebels (e.g., Joseph 1992; Schroeder 1998; Ducey 2004; Guardino 2005). The apparent ebbing by the early 1980s of the wave of hacienda studies that had surged during the preceding three decades or so by no means left the institution flopping on the sand and gasping for breath on the historiographical shore. Excellent studies were and are still being produced that focus on the great estate itself (e.g., Miller 1995), but it is difficult to call to mind any historians other than the prolific Mexican scholars Rodolfo Fernández (1994, 1999, 2003) and Gisela von Wobeser, somewhat earlier (1980, 1983, 1988, 1994), or the German historian Herbert studies extended from about 1950 to the early 1980s, coming more or less to a close with the publication of Enrique Florescano’s synthetic essay (1984) on the colonial hacienda. Bauer notes that the history of rural Mexico, moving away from a focus on the great landed estate, then bifurcated into two tendencies, the first looking to the internal life of the great estates, “leading to the very entrance of the worker’s household where . . . the sources still do not permit us to hear the peasant voice,” the other tendency reinserting politics into rural life (or vice versa) in the form of studies on peasants and landowners in the process of state formation.\n\n26\n\nPart I\n\nNickel (1987, 1988, 1989, 1997), who have consistently continued to produce high-quality monographs on this theme. Although Fernández’s work, for example, has strong elements of regional history and the history of western Mexican elites during the colonial era, these approaches are not incompatible with economic ones, and Fernández still works basically within the parameters of economic history. Moreover, while the anthropologization of the discipline drew the attention of historians toward the symbolic and the local, the linguistic turn destabilized the written accounts on which historians had always relied (although never uncritically). The result of these two convergent tendencies was that the questions many historians began to ask during the last twenty-five years or so found no answers in the economic realm. This meant that the traditional Mexican hacienda, whose history was already reasonably well known, simply lost its compelling interest for us. When the apparently inexhaustible variation in the form and function of the hacienda at the local and regional levels was reduced to a limited number of categories or analytic variables—amount and type of land, technological regimen, productive mix, scale of capital investment, organization of labor, patterns of ownership, nature of the available markets—the question arose as to how much variation there really was, and whether the variations from ideal type were worth studying so closely.7 Given these trends, many of the Anglophone and Mexican scholars who made early and major contributions to the historiography of the hacienda followed very roughly similar trajectories in their research, moving from the economic history of the colonial and nineteenth-century Mexican countryside, to studies of social movements or protest, and thence to cultural or even intellectual history, in some measure abandoning the field (no pun intended) of basic economic history to pursue more elusive but fashionable themes. To cite but four examples among Anglophone historians of Mexico, this was certainly true of William B. Taylor, David A. Brading, Cheryl E. Martin, and me.8 Leaving aside for the moment his excursions into other historical areas, we can follow Taylor’s movement from his important 1972 book on haciendas and native peasants in co7. The most fruitful conceptual work in breaking the landed estates of the New World down into a limited number of component variables was done as long as fifty years ago by Eric Wolf and Sidney Mintz (1957). 8. This trajectory in the work of scholars who had made contributions to the history of the colonial countryside was not restricted to English-speaking historians working on Mexico. Steve Stern, for example, moved from an early study of indigenous society in the Peruvian highlands (which, while not exactly a study of agrarian structures, nonetheless put a good deal of emphasis on landholding and labor relations), through a stage of interest in forms of rural protest, to gender relations in late colonial Mexico, and most recently to forms of historical memory in modern Chile; see Stern (1982, 1987a, 1995, 1998).\n\nChapter 1\n\n27\n\nlonial Oaxaca, to his innovative study of seven years later on forms of rural social deviance and protest, and thence to his massive investigation of priest-parishioner relations and forms of popular religious sensibility in the eighteenth century (Taylor 1972, 1979, 1996). A similar shift in theme can be seen in the work of David Brading, who followed up his classic interrelated works on silver mining and rural landholding in the Bajío region of central Mexico with a series of major studies of Mexican national identity, and most recently the intellectual and cultural history of Marian devotion and the Virgin of Guadalupe (Brading 1971, 1978, 1984b, 1985, 1991, 2001).9 Cheryl E. Martin’s scholarly trajectory marked a similar course. From her fine study of sugar production and labor systems in the Morelos sugar zone (Martin 1985), she moved in her 1996 book on late colonial Chihuahua to a more complex study of a diminutive frontier social order (Martin 1996). They are both works on local communities, but the first is single-stranded and economic in emphasis, the second multistranded and largely social and cultural in approach. Among better-known Mexican scholars the same was roughly true of Enrique Florescano, for example, whose early pathbreaking works on the economic history of the Mexican countryside were followed in subsequent years by a series of studies on collective indigenous memory, native cosmogony, and forms of Mexican national self-representation (Florescano 1969, 1971, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999). While a personal anecdote hardly constitutes proof of this trend, at the risk of being overconfessional let me suggest that my own experience in selecting a venue and a theme for my doctoral dissertation research in rural history demonstrates it. Around 1970 or so I was looking for a relatively uncrowded part of colonial Mexico (that is, not overpopulated with the work of other historians) in which to do my own work. I had considered the Valleys of Puebla and Cuernavaca when in a casual conversation Enrique Florescano suggested the Guadalajara area because of its rich archival sources and sparse modern historiography. Initially I had hoped to concentrate this study on social rather than economic history, but during the first stage of the research—as early as the reconnaissance phase, if you will—discovered that I had neither the obvious materials at hand for such an inquiry, nor the knowledge of how to read the primary sources that I did encounter for evidence of forms of domination, covert resistance, accommodation, and so forth. So in a sense I fell back on the economic history of the city and its hinterland, and of the great estates 9. Despite his anomalous detour into the history of popular protest in editing Caudillo and Peasant in the Mexican Revolution (Brading 1980), Brading never developed much of an interest in forms of popular politics or political upheaval as such. For a discussion of his trajectory as a historian, see Van Young (2007a).\n\n28\n\nPart I\n\nthere, producing the kind of single-stranded history typical of economic studies. Only later—having asked myself why this region beginning in 1810 should have produced such a long-lived rural insurgency among common and indigenous people (especially in the villages around Lake Chapala, for example), a problem only alluded to briefly in the conclusion of my book on the Guadalajara region—did I turn to social, political, and cultural themes, including popular religious sensibility, political culture, and the nature of community and ethnic identifications (Van Young 1992c, 2001c). My own doctoral students have since produced much more sophisticated work on rural society both in Mexico and elsewhere. The net result of the intersection of these shifting personal interests with larger historiographical trends is that precisely as my study of Guadalajara and its hinterland was being published, in 1981, or at least within the next couple of years, the wave of hacienda studies had already crested and was receding. One is hard pressed to think of major studies in English on this theme that have appeared within the last decade, although I will allude to some works in Spanish by Mexican historians. Younger scholars doing their doctoral research seem not to be interested in the topic. When one does see studies of rural economy in more recent years, rather than focusing on the economic workings of rural estates as such, they are quite likely to be cast in terms of environmental history (still not very well developed), and/or the struggle over resources between powerful landowners and humble people, or the way some particular agropastoral activity fit into regional, colony-wide, or even international markets. Examples of these styles of work, respectively, are Elinor Melville’s (1994) fine study of sheep culture and its environmental consequences in the Mezquital Valley of the Mexican near north, Sonya Lipsett-Rivera’s (1999) work on water rights and farming in later colonial Puebla, or Jeremy Baskes’s (2000) reconsideration of the cochineal (a brilliant red organic dye produced from cultivated insects) industry in Oaxaca. Then, too, sometime in the 1970s or early 1980s rural history, embracing primarily hacienda studies, began to be subsumed under the rubric of the “new regional history” in the sense that everything in the country outside the Valley of Mexico tended to become known as “regions” or “provinces” (often, and still today, with an implicitly dismissive connotation). The oversaturation of the central parts of the country (historiographically speaking), the increasing organization and accessibility of provincial archives, and the need to test hypotheses beyond single cases or miniregions—about the feudal nature of the colonial rural estate, for example—all contributed to this outward shift of focus. Although a technical or conceptual definition of what regions were, and how they changed over time, was hardly ever\n\nChapter 1\n\n29\n\noffered, many scholars confidently carved regions out for study, spaces most often organized by urban concentrations at their centers.10 My 1981 study of the Guadalajara region, therefore, for whose second edition (Van Young 2006a) the present essay was written as an introduction, needs to be situated within the historiography of rural Mexico as the product of a particular historical and autobiographical moment. I suppose many of us who studied the traditional hacienda—immersing ourselves in account books, wills and testaments, sales and rental contracts, and dusty files of litigation over landownership not infrequently running to hundreds of pages each—felt ourselves to be getting under the surface of conventional wisdoms about rural life as we looked at the actual economics of the putatively feudal agrosocial units that dominated much of the Mexican countryside in the colonial era, and even up to the early decades of the twentieth century. But these interests were by no means completely homegrown among historians of Mexico. They found antecedents and models in other historical literatures, most notably in that of medieval and early modern Europe, where both the origins of the modern state system and the transition from feudalism to capitalism focused the attention of historians importantly, if by no means exclusively, on the premodern countryside (e.g., Aston and Philpin 1987). A complete discussion of these influences lies outside the scope of this brief essay, but it is represented iconically by the composite picture adorning the cover of the 1999 reedition of François Chevalier’s La formación de los latifundios en México, the foundational classic of the field of hacienda studies.11 The image shows an old engraving of unmistakably European fortified walls, buildings, and fields (probably of late medieval vintage) partially superimposed over a modern photograph of an equally unmistakable Mexican landscape, organ cactus and all. Chevalier’s own book bears a dedication to the great French historian Marc Bloch, his teacher at one point, whose work on French feudalism obviously so influenced Chevalier’s work on Mexico, and therefore many subsequent studies of the Mexican great estate.12 But the enormous and rich literature on the agrarian history of 10. For a discussion of how regions might usefully be defined by historians, specifically drawing upon the colonial economic historiography, see Van Young (1992a, 1992d). 11. See Chevalier (1999). Originally published under the title La formation des grand domains au Méxique: Terre et société aux XVle-XVIIe siécles (1952), the book appeared in Spanish in Mexico as La formación de los grandes latifundios en México (1956), and was published in English as Land and Society in Colonial Mexico: The Great Hacienda (1966). The 1999 reedition includes a new introductory essay by Chevalier, two other essays of his published as addenda to the original monograph, and a new bibliography. 12. It is interesting to note in this regard that Chevalier’s great book adopts a sort of derived medievalist framework for the development of the great landed estate in colonial\n\n30\n\nPart I\n\nEurope furnished other exemplars widely influential on me and other scholars, among them works by the Dutch historian Bernhard Slicher Van Bath (1963), the Frenchmen Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie (1966) and Pierre Goubert (1960), and the English economic historian R. H. Tawney (1967/1912), to mention only a few. In my 1983 review article on the hacienda historiography, written just as my Guadalajara book was itself being published (but appearing in print two years later), I remarked that intellectual disciplines—subgenres or thematic historiographies would perhaps have been better, less grandiose terms in this case—have life cycles of their own: conceived and born, they advance through various stages of maturation, and may even fall into senescence (Van Young 1983). In that article I tried to think both diachronically and synchronically at the same time—to provide both a genealogy and a geography, in other words, of historical works on the colonial landed estate and the Mexican countryside more generally. I attempted to look not only at how the literature on the colonial Mexican hacienda and its broader rural environment had developed to that point, and how works in this field were related to each other, but also to map in extremely broad patches what its major research findings had been. Some of the approaches I suggested at the end of the article in terms of a research agenda for the future were already in evidence at the time, while some have flowered very little. It would be incorrect to say that the historical work on landed estates reached a dead end, however, since the findings of investigators in the three decades or so up to the mid-1980s continued to illuminate Mexican history specifically, and Latin American history more generally, as scholars became interested in new themes and documentary sources.\n\nthe outlines of the literature If the Mexican hacienda no longer occupied the center of attention, neither was it relegated to the margins. It is the purpose of this section to outline in very broad strokes where this literature went after 1980 or so, Mexico, emphasizing the politico-institutional dimensions that Marc Bloch highlighted in his masterwork Feudal Society (1961/1939). It is only in the new bibliography of the 1999 edition of his book that Chevalier includes Bloch’s other great work on the French countryside, French Rural History: An Essay on Its Basic Characteristics (1966/1931; originally published before the treatise on feudalism), which deals with rural society from a more strictly economic angle, and for a later period (sixteenth through eighteenth centuries)—approaches that correspond more closely to the way the Mexican hacienda came to be treated by historians after Chevalier.\n\nChapter 1\n\n31\n\nsuggesting how it became partially transmuted into other sorts of historical research, and along the way to allude thematically to some of the most important findings of the historiography as a whole.13 Macrohistory and the Hacienda Without the basic work done on the Mexican great landed estate in the thirty years or so up to the mid-1980s, it is difficult to imagine that a whole generation of macroeconomic studies of the colonial economy could have been produced, since that economy was so obviously supported by the twin pillars of silver mining and large-scale agricultural production. Since about 1990, approximately, a series of ambitious, important, and methodologically sophisticated works in economic history have deepened our knowledge of the eighteenth century in particular. Even when they do not say so explicitly, these studies appear to be structured around a specific teleology, the necessity of explaining Mexican independence, just as much of the historical literature on the nineteenth century is aimed at explaining why the Revolution of 1910 came along when it did, and why it took one form rather than another. In the case of independence the question would be: Why did New Spain separate itself from Old Spain, and what sorts of factors, internal and external, were most important in determining the timing and nature of the break? Furthermore, this issue has often been considered in relation to a larger question regarding both revolutions, that of why Mexican economic development had advanced in fits and starts, with periods of retrogression, rather than in a more linear fashion. Mining and the great estate were so inextricably entangled—price levels, labor requirements, backward and forward linkages of mining enterprises (that is, the weight of the mining industry as a user of inputs, and the effects of silver on the Mexican economy), and complementary patterns of capital investment were only a few of the points at which they grew into each other—that works in macroeconomic history ipso facto addressed the history of the hacienda whether or not they said so explicitly. The fundamental essays of John Coatsworth (e.g., 1990) demonstrate this, for example, setting forth a number of hypotheses about Mexican economic development within a 13. With several exceptions I have left out of my discussion works on the hacienda or rural history after the colonial period, works published before 1980 or so, and journal articles and book chapters. A useful bibliography of studies on the Mexican hacienda published between 1966 and 1988, embracing the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as well as the colonial period and organized by Mexican state, is the list provided by Tortolero Villaseñor (1995, 365–68); more useful still, since it takes a genuinely historiographical approach to this vast literature, is Langue (1998).\n\n32\n\nPart I\n\nmacroeconomic and institutional framework, as do a number of essays by the Spanish historian Pedro Pérez Herrero (1989, 1991, 1992a, 1992b), which brought into question the vaunted prosperity of the silver age at the close of the colonial period (see also Van Young 1986a, and the other essays in the same volume; Jacobsen and Puhle 1986). Then starting in the decade of the 1990s a number of even largerscale works appeared, five of which I will mention here. The five texts (Garner and Stefanou 1993; Ouweneel 1996; Ibarra Romero 2000b; Miño Grijalva 2001; Knight 2002b), one by a British scholar, two by Mexicans, and two by Americans, can all be seen at least in part as lateral extensions of hacienda studies, or at least as bird’s-eye views of a colonial economy dominated in large measure by the great landed estate (and see also the slightly earlier Calderón 1988). Garner and Stefanou deal with the economic development of eighteenth-century New Spain, placing much emphasis on the mining and rural economies; Ouweneel chiefly with demographic and environmental changes during roughly the same period, and the movements of production factors and people that these provoked; Ibarra Romero with a major regional economy (centering on the western city of Guadalajara) at the very end of the colonial period, demonstrating its dynamism and close linkages with other Mexican regions; and Miño Grijalva with late colonial Mexico’s urban network against the background of population growth. Alan Knight’s very ambitious but nicely balanced survey of Mexican history, whose first two volumes—one on pre-Columbian Mexico, the second on the colonial period—have recently appeared, is not strictly economic history in the conventional sense of the term, but with its deeply materialist framework leans so far in that direction that for most purposes it can be taken as such. Knight even goes so far as to write that the hacienda . . . was in fact the chief single determinant of New Spain’s pattern of development. By the late eighteenth century—when mining and commerce had grown substantially—the hacienda still rivaled the peasant village as the hub of economic life; it contributed the greater part of New Spain’s domestic product, outstripping the mines; and its resident communities surpassed some provincial towns not only in population but also in the “diversity of [their] social, religious, and economic functions.” Apart from bullion, the bulk of goods circulating in urban markets were products of the hacienda. The hacienda thus “had the power to set the pattern according to which the rest of rural life was organized,” in a society which was still overwhelmingly rural.14 14. Knight (2002b, 74); quotations are from Lindley (1983, 11, 211). It is a telling comment on the state of the literature that Knight’s footnotes, insofar as the history of the colonial hacienda is concerned, are mostly based on works published up to about 1983.\n\nChapter 1\n\n33\n\nThese five studies have a good deal in common despite their differences. First, they all employ quantitative techniques seriously (except for Knight), although the book by Ibarra Romero about the regional economy of Guadalajara around 1800 is the most explicitly “cliometric.” In their heyday the hacienda studies did the same thing, but replete as they were with tables and graphs tracing prices, inventories of estates, wages, and so forth, compared with other work by more technically trained economic historians (e.g., Coatsworth 1981; Salvucci 1987; Baskes 2000; Ibarra Romero 2000b) they were actually quite primitive in their methodologies, their statistics compiled by the authors counting on their fingers and toes. Second, the five studies all take regionalization very much into account; that is, they suggest that economic development is perhaps best studied on a regional level, rather than a colony-wide or local one, with Ibarra Romero’s work again most explicit in this dimension. This was an approach shared by the most ambitious of the hacienda studies (e.g., Serrera Contreras 1977; Brading 1978; Van Young 1981), since rural estates were almost always embedded in supralocal networks of markets, labor recruitment systems, and political structures calling for investigation at the regional level. Third, the books were obviously all influenced by the economic historiography of early modern Europe, also a hallmark of the hacienda literature, since what the Europeans had called agrarian history was highly developed from at least the beginning of the twentieth century, and very suggestive about how preindustrial societies were put together. In Ouweneel’s case this takes the form of an explicit dialog with ideas about “high-pressure” and “low-pressure” ecological and demographic situations as theorized by Victor Skipp, Ester Boserup, and Bernhard Slicher Van Bath, among others, but the same orientation is present in both Ibarra Romero and Miño Grijalva, and to some degree in Knight. The Regional Context While historians have labored to fit the hacienda into large-scale histories of the sort just discussed, they have also tried to essentialize the hacienda by generalizing its history across cases and periods, and in so doing have come to the paradoxical conclusion that beyond certain generalities applicable to all haciendas (already captured in Wolf and Mintz 1957), the institution was very much a creature of place. In other words, location in a particular valley, a particular relationship to an urban or miningdistrict market, a particular situation with regard to land, water, or labor resources, and so on, not to mention a particular history of ownership and management, very much determined why one estate might look so much different from another. This realization had not so much escaped\n\n34\n\nPart I\n\nearlier scholars, as it had been submerged by the powerful model of the seigneurial estate derived from François Chevalier’s (1952) foundational study of colonial haciendas. To be fair to the French historian, he had been careful to distinguish between the sort of estates that took shape during the seventeenth century in the vast, semidesertic spaces of northern Mexico, and the more intensively cultivated, market-oriented ones in the center and south of the country, although other scholars were less careful in applying his findings. But when the simplified Chevalier model began to crack under the impact of Charles Gibson’s (1964) pathbreaking study of the Valley of Mexico, and then sagged even further with a succession of later researches on other areas of the country where the colonial hacienda looked more different still (e.g., Barrett 1970 and Taylor 1972; for all of this see Van Young 1983), it became clear that regional specificity was required to understand all the variation. That is where my 1981 book on the Guadalajara region fits into the literature, for example, as an attempt to see how market forces, landholding patterns, demographic trends, and other factors configured a major colonial region. Somewhat later I and other scholars attempted to explore the processes of regionality from a more theoretical perspective (Van Young 1992b, 1994b; Pérez Herrero 1991), employing a combination of French cultural geography and central-place theory. There was more at stake in placing the traditional rural estate in its regional context, however, than simply adding a nuance or two to the picture of Mexican history. And this brings us back to the debate over whether colonial haciendas were more feudal or more capitalistic, or at least more seigneurial (landlord-dominated and paternalistic, that is) or more commercialized. Regional specificity seemed to offer the key to explaining this conundrum, suggesting that the nature of regions determined the nature of haciendas, and not the other way around. Where there were readily accessible markets, for example, as near cities or mining areas, estates looked less feudal because the possibilities for profit meant that they warranted larger injections of capital, produced larger surpluses for commercial sale, and functioned more within a cash-wage nexus for labor rather than a situation of coercion. My own research on a specific historical region suggested to me that despite the still paternalistic social ethos of their estates, hacendados worked more or less to maximize their market positions, as rational economic actors, and I therefore hazarded the characterization of them as economically capitalist but socially seigneurial (Van Young 1983). In a tactical retreat in which he ceded some ground about the regional variability of the institution and its potential adaptivity to market conditions, in order to save the social ethos of the seigneurial regime that was so much the essence of his earlier work, Chevalier (1999)\n\nChapter 1\n\n35\n\ntook up"
