There is certainly no shortage of books on the subject. Several general surveys of the witch trials and numerous regional and micro studies have been published for an English-­speaking readership. While the quality of publications on witchcraft has been high, some regions and topics have received less attention over the years. The aim of this series is to help illuminate these lesser known or little studied aspects of the history of witchcraft and magic. It will also encourage the development of a broader corpus of work in other related areas of magic and the supernatural, such as angels, devils, spirits, ghosts, folk healing and divination. To help further our understanding and interest in this wider history of beliefs and practices, the series will include research that looks beyond the usual focus on Western Europe and that also explores their relevance and influence from the medieval to the modern period. ‘Avaluable series.’ – Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft.

TOIVO\n\nThe verdict was the culmination of a five-month trial, in which Francesca di Rosata had been accused of various kinds of love magic and witchcraft (sortilegio), including the baptism of a magnet. By vehemently pronouncing her guilty of heresy, the inquisitor deemed Francesca a grave offender against the faith. After abjuring her heretical beliefs, she was to spend four months in prison and to be handled with the caution with which one treated excommunicated persons.2 As well as being an example of the many individuals in the early modern period to be sentenced for heresy, magic and witchcraft, the case also illustrates how these concepts could be interwoven. Francesca had contested orthodoxy. By making use of rituals of love magic, she had mocked the doctrine of free will and she had made herself a suspect of heresy and apostasy. By baptizing a magnet, a common feature in love magic, she had believed she was capable of providing objects with godly powers, although it was in fact the Devil working in these rituals. Whereas heresy, magic and witchcraft all represented ways of contesting orthodoxy, such contests were not reserved for legal trials; they could take place in many ways and on many levels, be they institutional, popular, ideological or social. This volume is about some of these various ways and levels of contesting religious orthodoxy or orthodox religions in late medieval and early modern Europe. As such, it deals with religion as the major ideology in late medieval and early modern culture. Religion is a concept understood in many ways in current historiographical work, ranging from theological institutions and dogma to social processes and structures of worldviews.3 It can be understood as communal and public or individual and private – the former forms have usually been considered dominant in premodern cultures, whereas the latter have been considered part of ‘modern’ religion and piety.4 What is important to understand is that religion, and heresy, magic and witchcraft as linked with it, operated on many levels of society and culture and was not restricted to a separate theological sphere. In the medieval and early modern periods, religion, politics and economics were each part of the other. Moreover, in this collection, religion must not be understood as an institutional imposition. Rather religious beliefs were constantly shaped and negotiated by individuals and institutions just as were political, economic and social developments. In the medieval and early modern period of confessionalization, religious orthodoxy represented the dominant form of religion among the authorities. Early modern religious orthodoxy meant strict adherence to established dogma, usually one that was presented as original and pure.\n\nAPPROACHES TO MAGIC, HERESY AND WITCHCRAFT\n\n3\n\nThe newly formed definitions of each denomination dictated how the Bible and church tradition were to be ‘purely’ and correctly understood, and what parts should be emphasized. Despite the seeming fixedness of the concept of orthodoxy, the distinction between heterodoxy and orthodoxy concerned interpretation. What, when and by whom beliefs and practices were deemed heterodox was a crucial issue in the cultural formation of the period, which led from negotiation to religious wars and persecuting violence. Nevertheless, this volume also shows that even though some beliefs and practices were contesting orthodoxy, they were not per se condemned as heretical. Orthodoxy was defined institutionally, but contested on yet many more levels, not limited to institutional, but also ideological or popular, social and performative. In the process, heterodoxy added to and shaped orthodoxy. Religion and religiosity, orthodox or heterodox, were less about what theologians described and defined, and more about what people did and how they acted. Consequently, religious agency became diffused. Whether one approaches religion as a subjective, a social or an authoritative phenomenon, it is also a medium of power. Studying late medieval and early modern orthodoxy and the contesting of it can shed light on central aspects of power, its use and construction in medieval and early modern society. The suppression of heterodox beliefs can be seen as expressing and displaying power, as a long tradition of research on confessionalization shows.5 Those representing orthodoxy were also explicitly or at least implicitly representing those in power. After the Reformation challenges to orthodoxy and the effort to suppress them became particularly visible. The Catholic Church suddenly experienced a need to define its doctrines in opposition to the emerging denominations, and it did so by negation, branding ‘the other’ as anathema. The Protestant churches, on the other hand, could not in an equal manner reject everything Catholic – since the churches shared a 1500-year history, condemning everything would have meant condemning themselves. Still, they needed to distance themselves from the rejected faith by certain key differences of opinion that centred on the sacraments, especially the Eucharist and baptism, the role of the Bible and the adoration of saints. In practice, much was invested in priesthood: Who had the right to administer certain religious rites and symbols?6 This is also visible in many of the essays here: although not directly administering sacraments, the actors in the essays are adopting the right to decide what was magic, and witchcraft or prayer and work, what was sacred and what profane. By doing so, they were using a central power in defining religion and heresy.\n\n4\n\nL.N. KALLESTRUP AND R.M. TOIVO\n\nContemporary scholars are generally aware of a connection between heresy, magic and witchcraft.7 In past decades, the historiography of magic and witchcraft has evolved in the direction of conceptual history, investigating the meanings of magic, witchcraft and heresy within given historical contexts.8 For this collection, these concepts have been chosen from a variety of related ideas, such as superstition, preternatural or supernatural. They are not chosen because they always serve all purposes best – the other terms have their uses – or even because they are the most important. They are chosen because their nature, as concepts that have had multiple meanings in history and therefore will evade precise definition today, allows them to create a cross-point where different approaches intersect. We hope that this cross-point will make this work appeal to a large number of scholars, not only of religious but also cultural, social and political history. This book also covers the period from late medieval to early modern, acknowledging that despite the Reformation, the modern ideas were built on medieval plinths. We acknowledge that the essays are unevenly distributed on this timeline, and that the essays on heresy tend to be medieval, the essays on witchcraft concentrate on the turn of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the essays on magic cover the late medieval and early modern periods. This reflects not only the interests of scholars working in these fields but also the interests of the contemporaries of each period. The volume presents essays in three rough and overlapping parts; however, the essays cover more than one, and some all three concepts. The volume starts with essays drawn together by the most general concept, heresy. Thereafter the focus will move to magic and finally to witchcraft. In the next introductory section, however, we will progress in the opposite order.\n\nWitchcraft In medieval thought, the concept of witchcraft held a place in the moral cosmology as a necessary evil receptacle of the hierarchically contrasting good of the community of Christians, God, piety and virtue. Still, the contents of the concept of witchcraft were dependent on the contents of its superior counterparts – and vice versa. In medieval and early modern thought, there could be no Christianity without the Devil and without witchcraft. This gave witchcraft an inherently unstable place on the threshold between orthodoxy, heterodoxy and heresy.9\n\nAPPROACHES TO MAGIC, HERESY AND WITCHCRAFT\n\n5\n\nIt had been a widely spread premise throughout the history of the medieval period that magic and maleficia could only work because of the power of the Devil. In his Summae Thomas Aquinas had put forward what would be the foundations for the early modern Catholic condemnation of witchcraft by outlining the relationship between magicians and the devil. Although focusing on ritual magic, Thomas Aquinas stated that while magicians may claim it was divine powers at work in magical rituals, in fact the powers were always diabolical. Magical rituals were practised with a selfish aim, so making it an arrangement only the Devil would participate in. To have the Devil provide a magical ritual with power required the magician to enter a diabolical pact.10 In the fifteenth century this demonized idea of magic gained much more force. During the later Middle Ages heresy became more demonized and gradually evolved into the idea of the fully fledged witch.11 Since the work of Norman Cohn (1975), scholars generally agree that the first witch-­hunts grew out of a demonization of magic, which took place roughly at the same time as the eradication of Cathars and Waldensians. More recent studies of these heretical roots have documented that the fifteenth-­century witch prosecutions were explicitly linked to these persecutions.12 Members of these sects were misleadingly accused of being devil worshippers (Luciferanists), and the constant presence and activities of the Inquisition spurred on the transferral of these ideas and accusations to witches.13 The first fully articulated conception of witchcraft occurred in writings in 1428 and 1442 in the area around Lausanne in Western Switzerland. Soon thereafter, in 1448, a series of trials was conducted in the same area, in all of which the witches were described as ‘modern Waldensian heretics’.14 Together these trials and writings represent what Richard Kieckhefer has named the ‘Lausanne paradigm’ – the formation of the fully articulated witch.15 By the end of the fifteenth century, a witch was not just any performer of magic, but a heretical and diabolical figure, one who had explicitly given herself to the Devil. Witchcraft was thus placed on the platform of heresy, apostasy, idolatry and possibly even schismaticism. In this collection, Charles Zika explores how this process was reflected in late medieval visualizations of the Witch of Endor, pointing also to a rise in the personal agency of the depicted necromancer alongside the rise of the demonic elements in the images. The witch was no mere channel, but had herself made a pact and worked together with the Devil in disguise. Johannes Geiler, presented in Rita Voltmer’s essay, and Giovanfrancesco\n\n6\n\nL.N. KALLESTRUP AND R.M. TOIVO\n\nPonzinibio, whose works are discussed in Matteo Duni’s essay, were figures right on the threshold of old and new ideas of witchcraft. The ambiguity of witchcraft ideas shows in both their works. The same personal agency of the witch, the rise of whom is shown in Zika’s essay, was emphasized by Ponzinibio in order to make witchcraft a crime among those to be investigated and judged by lawyers, instead of an exceptional crime to be moved to the realm of priests and inquisitors. To Ponzinibio, the Devil had no material power in the world and witchcraft was merely a spiritual phenomenon: the real heresy was believing that witches in fact went to the Sabbath. While Geiler never presented witchcraft as the exceptional super crime that had to be prosecuted without mercy, he did present it as the archetype of blasphemous crime. In fact, in these three essays we can already see at the turn of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries all the ingredients of both the persecution and the waning of it. The essay by Zika demonstrates how by the late sixteenth century the woman of Endor was depicted as a fully fledged witch parallel to the rise of the post-Reformation witch-hunts. In the Latin regions, and where inquisitions continued to handle trials for witchcraft, the link between heresy and witchcraft persisted. In the reformed churches of northern Europe, the correlation tended to take a secondary position to maleficia in the courts. The essay by Kallestrup investigates the link between heresy and witchcraft in the post-reformation witch-hunt in Denmark, from authoritative theologians such as Niels Hemmingsen to the practical handling of the trials – and how this correlation gradually faded when secular authorities handled the offence. The condemnation of witchcraft as heresy then became part of a sharp rhetoric applied for consolidating the Evangelical faith. In his contribution, Rune Hagen turns his attention to another part of the Danish-Norwegian kingdom, namely the most northern part, the Finmark. He demonstrates how the myths of the evil north were applied in the efforts to gain power over the new territory and how this implied persecuting the indigenous population. In this sense, the prosecution of witches in the Finmark becomes an example of early modern state-­ building, since it is about consolidating the power of the Danish king on the frontiers of the kingdom. Whether the transformation of witchcraft into a form of heresy was a result of the hunt for heretics, Waldensians and Anabaptists dying out and then moving on the witches, or a new creation of post-Reformation period polemics between different religiopolitical parties – of course, not straightforwardly accusing each other\n\nAPPROACHES TO MAGIC, HERESY AND WITCHCRAFT\n\n7\n\nfor being witches, but creating an atmosphere where that was a viable possibility – witchcraft acquires the place of the most important and most horrifying heresy, the necessary ‘enemy within’ a Christian society.16 Nevertheless, witchcraft and witch trials also fulfilled similar religious functions to those served previously by ghost stories and anti-Jewish stories: they were an arena where the transcendent could be explored. The trials with testimonies, sentences and executions also provided proof of the existence and reality of the other world, and with it, the supernatural that was the principal essence of Christianity.17 Another way of exploring the metaphysics and epistemology or the virtual reality was the abundant fiction created around witchcraft, and explored in this volume by Willem de Blécourt in examining magic and witchcraft in the late medieval Dutch play ‘Die Hexe’ as a commentary on historical events. In making a mockery of witchcraft and presenting magic as a series of fraudulent and useless tricks, the play presented an early version of the scepticism that came to mark witch trials in the Netherlands.\n\nMagic Richard Kieckhefer has described magic as a ‘kind of crossroads’ where religion and science, popular and learned, as well as reality and fiction intersected.18 As such it also takes a prominent place in this volume. The Christian worldview was inherently magical from the start, and it still is. Nevertheless it would not approve of all kinds of magic or of supernatural help. The border between prayer and magic, therefore, became one of the most lasting intrigues of Christianity. Still, a fairly early line was drawn according to where the power lay. In prayer humans submitted to the supernatural power of God, Christ and the saints, and could only hope for divine aid. In magic humans invoked and commanded the supernatural powers. The reality was, however, much more blurred, even among theologians. Indeed, it could be said that the neo-Platonic view, which juxtaposed magic and (Christian) faith was a major ideological trend but yet never secured full supremacy: it was always contested. The section on magic in this volume is initiated with Richard Kieckhefer’s essay on angel magic. In the later medieval period angel magic became still more widespread and consequently it was heavily debated. Angels were ambiguous – they could be either good or evil, they often acted in groups and they owned the power of locomotion the same way as demons, and as opposed to saints’ fixed location. In his essay, Kieckhefer argues that the\n\n8\n\nL.N. KALLESTRUP AND R.M. TOIVO\n\nproblems concerning angel magic resembled the problems with lay people practising magical healing: the practitioners of angel magic did not adhere to any intellectual or institutional control. Concepts of witchcraft, often including the witches’ submission to the Devil, are a case in point. Even when the juxtaposition of magic and prayer was fully accepted and its rhetoric used, it was still debatable whether any individual act, invocation or application was on this or that side of the distinction. The essays by Søndergaard and Toivo deal with these intersections, made even more complicated, as Toivo points out, by the fact that religious definitions are never used in an arena that is only theological: politics, social peace and other intellectual values mattered in the interpretations given to deeds, words and objects as religious or otherwise. The question of adiaphora and tolerance despite disapproval thus enters the world of magic as well as heresy. As Søndergaard points out in his essay, the functional character of the Scandinavian spell-books and spells made it natural for them to fuse elements from pre-Christian, non-Christian and Christian backgrounds, and thereby blurred the borders between religion and magic as well as between natural science and magic. Natural magic in the form of magnetism and planetary influences likewise blurred the boundaries of the forbidden and acceptable, as explored in Dillinger’s essay. Natural sciences, growing during both the Renaissance and the Enlightenment or even the proto-industrial technological period, formed another area bordering on magic. In the blurred areas, the idea that new profitable knowledge existed gained usages which did not require the trouble of acquiring the actual knowledge, like the Italian charlatan Saccardini’s semi-scientific or quasi-empirical view on medicine laid out by David Gentilcore located in the section on heresy, or the divining rod explored in Dillinger’s essay. It is commonly stated that Protestant worldviews were at least as detrimental to magical worldviews as the rise of science, resulting in a more rational northern and more superstitious or sacramentalist southern Europe despite the spread of rationalism and virtues of moderation to Catholic Reformation religious life, too. This bias can be a result of defining Protestantism from the nineteenth-century viewpoint – as rational and ‘modern’. Such a starting point is, however, not a very stable one if applied to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This collection as a whole would challenge such a view from both north and south.\n\nAPPROACHES TO MAGIC, HERESY AND WITCHCRAFT\n\n9\n\nHeresy In short, complying with heresy means the intentional break with the dogma of the church and the rejection of church doctrines as false. According to Thomas Aquinas, heresy meant ‘a species of infidelity in men who, having professed the faith of Christ, corrupt its dogmas’.19 In the medieval and early modern era, theologically various degrees of heresy existed, and it often involved related offences such as apostasy and idolatry.20 Heretics who refused to abjure were often executed, especially by fire, and they were often executed collectively, thereby strengthening the position of orthodoxy in opposition to heterodoxy. Not every dissenting religious view was heresy, neither before nor following the break with doctrinal unity in the sixteenth century. Heresy needed to have a real subversive potential, even will, and it needed to tackle a religiously important point, such as the Cathar ideas on resurrection. As there was a considerable number of German debates on Lutheran identity and corresponding debates on Calvinism and Catholicism, various views on adiaphora had to be allowed. Although not correct, these matters were considered indifferent to the essence of faith and salvation. Therefore adiaphora were not heretical – although considerations of what exactly were adiaphora could be. Alongside merely indifferent matters the late medieval and early modern religious were concerned with a number of things that were certainly unwanted and worse than quite indifferent, but yet not important enough to be prosecuted as heresy: things that were tolerated because of a greater cause, be that religious, social or political.21 On the other hand, heresy needed to be identifiable as a branch of the religions which considered it heresy: infidels, pagans and other outsiders could not be heretics. The first part of this book deals with various expressions of heresy, and how they could contest orthodoxy. It introduces three cases from the twelfth to the seventeenth century and illustrates the fluidity of definition that has marked the discussion of heresy itself and the differentiations or conflations of heresy, magic, witchcraft and superstition in the late medieval and early modern period. Since heresy, magic and witchcraft have mostly been studied separately, the varying ways of narrowing down this fluidity, however much acknowledged in themselves, have caused some controversy. We acknowledge that fluidity of definition is a major characteristic of any discussion of heresy, magic and witchcraft, which will effect and vary research results in time, culture and space. We seek not to reduce this fluidity and variation to a single definition, but rather to explore its variety to suggest ways it can be used in comparisons and generalizations\n\n10\n\nL.N. KALLESTRUP AND R.M. TOIVO\n\nas well as individual studies. Correct faith and heresy had to be negotiated. Among theologians, this could be done via tractates and treatises, learned writings – and since heresy required an obstinate persistence in subversive thought, this was a viable option to test things that were not yet classified on one side or the other. Among lay members of society, other means had to be sought, and they could lead to trouble. During the middle ages the heartlands of Christendom faced the great heresies. In north-eastern parts of Europe, the church continued to expand its territories, and was faced with contests from pagan and newly Christianized people. Nancy Caciola writes of a way of transferring the competition between pagan and newly Christianized people’s ideas about life after death into the safer realm of stories and fantasies of the dead. Real and unreal, existing and gone at the same time, the dead offered a stage where differences between pagans and Christians could be laid out and the newly Christianized people could try out identities and thought forms. In these north-eastern borderlands medieval epistemologies of the dead as either demons or ghosts were incorporated into the church’s project of acculturation. Explanations for how and why a person, though dead, might nonetheless display agency or power varied widely amongst different social groups and their associated epistemologies. Beliefs about the dead were left as an open field of interpretation and debate in this period; this makes the subject an excellent point of entrée into the multidimensional complexity of medieval thought and culture. Stephen Mitchell likewise explores the debates of heterodoxy and orthodoxy in the newly Christianized area in his essay on trials for heresy in medieval Scandinavia. Trials for heresy and the harsh penalties they generated demonstrated the power of the authorities and served as a means for social control, and in which the trials for heresy were often linked to magic and witchcraft. Despite the apparent similarity of the cultures presented in the essays of Caciola and Mitchell – newly established Christianity – they present very different ways of dealing with the problem of identifying orthodox and heretical behaviour. The German parishioners in Caciola’s essay created a vivid culture of the dead to explore the differences in unofficial ways. In Mitchell’s discussion, the Scandinavian church authorities appear as the defining powers in a series of heresy and witchcraft cases. The Protestant reformations brought an end to doctrinal unity of the Christian church. Catholic confessional expansion was aimed at the new world and internally efforts were aimed at preventing future divisions of the church and to maintain territories already Catholic. The reformations brought about renewed attention by Catholic authorities to heresy. In his\n\nAPPROACHES TO MAGIC, HERESY AND WITCHCRAFT\n\n11\n\nessay on the case of Constantino Sacccardini, a charlatan sentenced for heresy by the Roman Inquisition in Bologna, David Gentilcore directs the focus to the Mediterranean context again. The Roman Inquisition had been reorganised as a direct response to Protestant followers but gradually the Inquisition became a crucial weapon in the religious disciplining of the populace.22 In early seventeenth-century Bologna, after the profanation of a series of sacred images, the authorities, lay and secular, proceeded in order to find and sentence the guilty parties. The essay explores the intersection between ideas about magic, God, the devil, science and faith, by revisiting the thoughts, words and deeds of an early seventeenth-­ century Italian charlatan. The view of charlatans was ambiguous, not only in Bologna. Charlatans offered medical/healing aid and were an accepted alternative to the church and trained physicians; still, they needed to be registered either with the medical tribunal or with the papal legate. Historians have been tempted to relate Saccardini’s radical religious views to his presumed radical medical ones, drawing into this mix his dual negative roles as jester and charlatan. And yet there is little in either of these two occupations that could have foretold or led to Saccardini’s fate. Far from being a ‘dangerous’ or even liminal occupation, his medical activities had official recognition and sanction via inspection and licensing. Saccardini’s performances, medicines and treatment strategies, and printed chapbook give little clue to the fate that would befall him. From the beginning of the seventeenth century the persecution of witchcraft and popular superstition decreased among most tribunals, but clusters of trials continued to appear throughout the seventeenth century, in some tribunals until the eighteenth. The Roman Inquisition was organized in regional tribunals with the Congregation in Rome as the centre. Still, the collaboration of the tribunals with local secular and church authorities varied. Throughout the medieval and early modern period, the Christian church represented an orthodoxy that was continuously contested. The challenge of heterodoxy, especially as expressed in various kinds of heresy, magic and witchcraft, was constantly present during the period 1200 to 1650. With this volume we aim to break down three common scholarly barriers – of periodization, discipline and geography – in the exploration of the related themes of heresy, magic and witchcraft. By setting aside constructed chronological boundaries, inherent in periodizations such as medieval, early modern, Reformation and Counter Reformation, we hope to achieve a clearer and more continuous picture of what ‘went before’ and what ‘went after’, thus demonstrating continuity as well as change in the concepts and understandings of magic, heresy and witchcraft. The\n\n12\n\nL.N. KALLESTRUP AND R.M. TOIVO\n\ngeographical pattern of similarities and diversities suggests a comparative approach, transcending confessional as well as national borders. Theology, magic and science provided the framework for human knowledge, which shaped the medieval and early modern understandings of the world.\n\nNotes 1.

One night a priest, assigned to a newly repaired and reconsecrated church in a village called Deventer, noticed that a crowd of dead folk were using the building after dark. Each night, they conducted mass. Puzzled, the priest sought counsel of his bishop, who ordered him to prevent the dead congregation from gathering there. But as it transpired, when the priest attempted to defend the building it was he who was ejected. The dead mob unceremoniously picked up the living man and threw him out of the building, with his bedding after him. When the priest reported all this to the bishop, however, the latter insisted that he return to his vigil the next night. The terrified cleric fortified himself with holy water and took blessings from the relics of saints; dread kept him awake as darkness fell and the dead throng filed into the church at their customary hour. Noticing the priest, they picked him up as before – but this time, they carried him to the altar, placed him upon it, and there ‘burnt his body to a cinder’.\n\nN.M.

CACIOLA\n\nThe story is strange but not singular. Indeed, preoccupation with the continuing vitality and power of the dead was a characteristic feature of medieval society. After the millennium, in all corners of Europe we find accounts of defunct people who seem far from fully extinct: corporeal revenants attacked their former neighbours; ghosts possessed their descendants; undead dancers skipped their feet in cemeteries and fields; Harlequin’s dead army marched across the winter skies; royal courts of the dead were discovered inside mountains; and of course, everywhere relic cults proliferated for the powerful dead. The living, for their part, classified deaths as either ‘good’ or ‘bad’; treated human remains in particular ways depending on whether they elicited reverence or fear; staged dances of death in graveyards; painted macabre motifs; and eagerly gathered around spirit mediums. Both medical specialists and regular folk struggled to precise the exact physiological differences between vitality and mortality, and to diagnose deaths when someone was unresponsive. Concern to assist the dead escalated steeply in monastic and clerical circles, as evidenced by the innovation of necrologies, the increasing formalization of Purgatory after 1170, and the multiplication of assistance techniques for the ‘Church Suffering’ there. In sum, the struggle to imagine death and afterlife is a recurrent theme in every region, social stratum and area of cultural endeavour. Like Thietmar’s doomed priest, who turned to the remains of the holy dead for protection against the dangerous dead, medieval people encountered the deceased at every turn, in contexts of veneration, of supplication, and of fear.2 Yet the systemic importance of the dead has been either overlooked or under-emphasized by medievalist scholars. Indeed, I would go so far as to suggest that the majority of medieval people who believed that they had had direct experience of the supernatural realm did so in intimate confrontation with dead human beings, rather than through encounter with a transcendent deity. Medieval church doctrine permitted, even fostered, a great deal of latitude when it came to the imagination of death and afterlife. It is striking that stories of ghosts and revenants, for example, while not quite orthodox, never were declared heretical either. They occupied a capacious middle ground of toleration without endorsement, an unusually ambiguous emplacement for such a significant area of thought. Indeed, it is the distinctively non-heretical character of my source material that is key to its usefulness as a point of entry into a discussion of medieval natural philosophy and the supernatural. I begin with some remarks about the medieval people’s struggles to define mortality precisely; then\n\n‘NIGHT IS CONCEDED TO THE DEAD’\n\n19\n\noffer some reasons why I think tales of ambiguously powerful, this-worldly dead folk were allowed to persist without objection in the interstices of medieval culture. I move on to some close readings of tales about return from the dead; and finally close with some remarks about why the dead are ‘good to think with’. The state of knowledge about death and afterlife offered by medieval Christian intellectuals was as follows: death was born amid the lushness of Paradise, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God’s commandment not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. Thus, as the seventh-century Bishop Isidore of Seville wrote, in a famed etymology repeated for many centuries thereafter, death, mors, derives from our first ancestors’ bite, morsus, of the forbidden fruit.3 Ancient medicine and later, medieval natural philosophers suggested that, physiologically speaking, death occurs at the moment when the human spirit ceased to power the spiritual system, for it regulated the vital signs: heartbeat, pulse, respiration. The dissolution of the spirit was, in turn, linked to the exit of the soul from the body, for the spirit was the soul’s instrument for interacting with the flesh. Afterwards the soul transitioned to a tripartite, otherworldly realm of punishment, purgation, or paradise, according to its merits, where it persisted in a purely spiritual state; the body, meanwhile, decayed to bone and then to dust. This separation of body and soul would persist until their joyous reunion at the General Resurrection at the end of time. Yet, medieval people had many more things they wanted to know about death and afterlife. Their questions continually recur in medieval texts. What was the difference between death and sleep? Why did falls, drownings or other accidents sometimes result in death, even though the body was still intact? How did death feel? What did the soul look like and what were its capacities? And on and on: these are significant queries insofar as they indicate the scope of non-convergence between available systems of knowledge and human curiosity. Furthermore, death remained mysterious even at the most basic level of physical verification. Our sources tell us that when someone became unresponsive and unconscious, observers frequently were unsure how to proceed. We read of debates, of vigils held over unconscious bodies to watch for revivals, of checking for pulse, splashing cold water on victims’ faces and sometimes even inserting needles under the toenails to see if there was a pain response. The medical branch of natural philosophy tried to precise the signs of death, some of which we would recognize (lack of pulse, breath and heartbeat); and some of which seem less useful (the nose becoming pointed or the forehead\n\n20\n\nN.M. CACIOLA\n\nhard). Lists of the signs of death even were translated into mnemonic vernacular rhymes or ‘jingles’, for reference in cases of unclear death. Consensus about the forms and possibilities of afterlife was equally elusive. From the church fathers on down, there was significant diversity of thought on this topic. On the one hand was a tradition originating with Saint Augustine, which held that the souls of the dead were translated to another dimension, and could not return to this worldly plane. Augustine’s treatise On the Care to Be Taken for the Dead, composed around 422, erected a firm barrier between this and the other world.4 This strand of thought persisted throughout the Middle Ages and was, indeed, the dominant school of thought among theologians, natural philosophers and other intellectuals. A good, clear statement of the Augustinian position may be found in the writings of William of Auvergne: ‘If [they] are in the society of the blessed and sublime spirits, why would they descend … from the joys of blessedness? If, however, they are in the infernal prison or the purging fire, in either case they would seem to be confined and incapable of leaving.’5 According to Augustinian heuristics, the dead, once departed, cannot return: the veil between worlds is thick. Hence, apparitions of the dead could only be demons impersonating the deceased and wreaking havoc with the imaginations of the living. Yet another ancient tradition accepted the possibility that the dead might indeed linger on earth. The fourth book of Gregory the Great’s Dialogues, which is filled with tales of ghosts and revenants in this world, is the locus classicus for this stance. Gregory’s specific tales, and the motif more generally, were commonly to be found in predicatory texts, courtly entertainments and histories – all works aimed at largely lay audiences. Why were these kinds of stories allowed to persist, despite the fact that the highest levels of the theological elite were following Augustine’s lead rather than Gregory’s? I would suggest it was because, quite simply, the main idea about death that the church wished to promote to the laity, one so important that it overwhelmed all other considerations, was that there was life after death. The suggestion that everything was extinguished at the death of the body likely was rare in its most radical form – but it certainly is attested. Thomas of Cantimpré, for instance, recounted a story of drinkers debating the afterlife. When the sceptic offers to sell his soul for another ale, a dark stranger promptly appears, buys the drink and flies off with the man right after it is done.6 Likewise, pagan peoples who were still actively being evangelized in the high Middle Ages were said to\n\n‘NIGHT IS CONCEDED TO THE DEAD’\n\n21\n\nbelieve that ‘everything finishes with temporal death’.7 Thus, doubt about the afterlife was a highly threatening area of unbelief for those charged with missionizing journeys or pastoral duties. Annihilation: this was the unthinkable, the truly heretical, for immortality is the central promise of Christian faith. Thus ghost stories were simply too useful to reject, for they offered direct, first-hand evidence for the afterlife: … [some] say that what we teach about the Other World is nonsense: they suggest we made it up! … They won’t believe it … unless they hear it from someone who either resurrected from the dead, or who appears to the living after death. For how can anyone know about something they have neither seen nor experienced?8\n\nIn brief, representations of ghosts and revenants persisted, even flourished, in large part because they served the church’s broader acculturative projects. They provided a form of epistemic proof about the persistence of the individual essence beyond the death of the body. At the same time, tales of the restless dead were a particularly active conduit for the circulation of ideas among different sociocultural groups in the Middle Ages. They frequently were drawn from earlier cultural antecedents, yet were suffused with an ecclesiastical ideology: thus they were able to function within more than one field of meaning simultaneously. A group of tales from the Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg9 can serve as excellent evidence for this point. This bishop served in a place (the far eastern frontier of Christendom, amid Slav communities that still were only partially converted); and a time (the 10-teens) in which the Christian church still was actively evangelizing a mixed population. Here, Christianity was relatively young. This was the second great wave of missioning activity eastward, attempting to extend the gains of a previous generation (which brought the new religion beyond the Rhine and to the North Sea) now across the Elbe and into the Baltic region. Christianity was embraced by some Slavic peoples, but actively rejected by others.10 The indigenous Slavic group just east of the Elbe, known variously either as the Wends or Redarii, proved militantly resistant to the acculturation projects of the German princes, and pushed back with bloody uprisings from the late tenth through the eleventh centuries. The Ottonian rulers, in turn, pushed back.11 The eastern frontier of Christendom collapsed entirely in both 986 and 1066, with the result that the eastern Marches were not truly Christianized until the mid-twelfth century.\n\n22\n\nN.M. CACIOLA\n\nThietmar, though born of Saxon aristocracy and an advisor of the Ottonian ruler Henry II, also was a keen observer of his surrounding culture. In book six of his work, for instance, he provides a detailed description of a pagan cult site, one that is regarded as reasonably reliable by modern scholars. Nor was Thietmar unique among Christian clerics in the region: Merseburg also was home to an anonymous cleric who collected and preserved two pagan incantations sometime during the tenth century. The so-called ‘Merseburg Charms’ are short, rhythmic invocations of valkyries, Phol, Wodan, and Frija, composed in an archaic German and carefully transcribed onto a leaf of an otherwise Christian manuscript found in the library of the Cathedral of Merseburg.12 The decision to commit the charms to writing suggests an active interest, on the part of clergy in the area, to understanding local beliefs and practices. Thietmar’s text provides our richest contemporary testimony to how the imported religion of Christianity interacted with older native traditions.\n\nA Gathering of the Dead, or of Demons? The story of the priest incinerated by a congregation of dead folk, with which I began, is the last of a group of three such stories in Book I of Thietmar’s eight-book work. The first one is set in Walsleben, a town that, as Thietmar recalled, had been attacked and burned by Slavic forces some time earlier. The church had since been repaired and reconsecrated. The new priest rises at the first blush of dawn to sing matins, but finds the church and cemetery already occupied by corpses arisen from their graves. A deceased woman of his acquaintance assures him that they already have taken care of the morning’s liturgical duties, and tells him he has not long to live (her words prove true). The next tale is set in Magdeburg, where the night guards of the Merchants’ church notice activity in the attached cemetery. They recruit some prominent citizens to keep watch alongside them. These witnesses aver that they saw the dead holding lights in candelabra; near dawn, they heard voices sing the morning mass in full, with proper chanting and responses. The last tale is the one from Deventer, with which I began. Thietmar heard this one from his niece, an abbess, who claimed to know of many similar instances. A number of details in these stories are worthy of close consideration. First, and as a precondition for everything else, the dead conduct their nightly activities on the same plane of existence as the living: in short, Thietmar adopted a Gregorian framework. The dead are portrayed as\n\n‘NIGHT IS CONCEDED TO THE DEAD’\n\n23\n\nremaining close to the spaces they occupied during life, and they behave much like a living congregation. There is a lay–clerical social division; the dead can sing mass and they sometimes carry candles; they can see and speak to the living. These are corporeal, revenant corpses with physical capabilities to sing, to speak, to grasp, and not least, to kill. One reason why cultural fragments about the dead were so ubiquitous to medieval culture is that they held a surfeit of meanings. Thietmar’s tales exemplify this: they are hybrid formations with several different sets of cultural meanings bundled together into a syncretic narrative form. In fact, I find in Thietmar’s text intimations of three ways of understanding these tales. First, they may be taken at face value, as the Christian dead arisen before the end in order to offer a theological lesson; second, they may be interpreted as demons impersonating the dead for nefarious purposes; or third, they may be interpreted as embodying a fundamentally pagan sensibility about the afterlife, albeit one transposed to a Christianizing context. In the remainder of this essay I unpack each of these notions in turn. However, it is necessary to offer one caveat: the analysis to follow somewhat artificially dissects a narrative that functions as an organic, integrated whole. Thietmar’s stories are plurivocal and sometimes inconsistent, and this in itself is interesting and important to observe. I begin with a rationale that Thietmar himself offered for his stories as he recounted them in Book I of his eight-part work. The bishop introduced this series of anecdotes as transparent proofs so that ‘no one faithful to Christ may doubt the future resurrection of the dead’. This is a theme to which he returned obsessively. Shortly thereafter, for example, he paused to exclaim, ‘I have written these things down so that unbelieving people may learn that the words of the prophets are true: “Lord, your dead will live!” And another, “The dead shall rise up, those who lie in graves; they will hear the voice of God’s son and rejoice!”’ And he concluded the series: ‘I speak to the uneducated and most especially to the Slavs, those who believe that everything finishes with temporal death, firmly indicating to the faithful the certainty of our future resurrection.’13 Thus Thietmar persistently argued that congregations of living cadavers demonstrate the truth of the General Resurrection at the End of Time. The latter doctrine apparently was one to which he had encountered resistance from pagan Slavic populations. As someone charged with pastoral responsibilities at the geographic limit of Christendom – Thietmar was the second occupant of the see of Merseburg – it is easy to see why he would have found these tales appealing: they provided compelling entertainment\n\n24\n\nN.M. CACIOLA\n\nmingled with a frisson of fear and pity; they foregrounded worship in a church; and they are premised upon the continuing life of the physical body at some point after death and burial. Thus on one level, it makes sense that he would point to them as a rejoinder to pagans, recent converts and other Resurrection sceptics. Yet at the same time, one is struck by the fallacy of Thietmar’s reasoning. Just how, exactly, do contemporary groups of revenant corpses, in the year 1013, establish the truth of the General Resurrection of all humanity at some future time? Thietmar undoubtedly meant to suggest that the moving, animate cadavers of these dead folk provide a pattern of possibility: proof that the mortal coil may transcend corruption, rise and live again. Yet the illogic of his proposition is manifest: the doctrine of Resurrection is more than the paradox of life returned to a defunct body. It plays a specific role within the unfolding of universal history, and the process of human salvation. It takes more than a few reanimated cadavers in a cemetery to do it justice. Finally, the gruesome murder of the priest in the last story obstructs any transparent understanding of these revenants as patent symbols for the most exalted mystery of the Christian faith. Other medieval sources likewise reported congregations of the dead, though usually they were deployed as evidence for spiritual afterlife after bodily death, rather than as proofs of the bodily Resurrection. The Fournier register tells us that in Montaillou, groups of the dead continually moved between churches in the region, in a form of post-mortem penitence from which they would eventually be released.14 The belief that the dead came out of their graves at night to worship also was known to medieval German Jews: in some regions the living customarily knocked on the synagogue doors before entering in the morning, in order to give fair warning.15 Thietmar’s contemporary Raoul Glaber told of a monk who witnessed a matins service in church early one Sunday, conducted by a dead bishop on behalf of some recently killed Crusaders on route to Paradise.16 Likewise, Peter the Venerable recounted how a novice was summoned into the cemetery one night by his deceased uncle, to attend a post-mortem chapter meeting of all the defunct brethren.17 Yet though the structural substratum of these other stories is similar to Thietmar’s narratives – religious communities of the dead, encountered on this plane of existence and with some indications of corporeity – the meanings attached to them differ. Thietmar is alone in arguing that his reports prove the doctrine of the General Resurrection.\n\n‘NIGHT IS CONCEDED TO THE DEAD’\n\n25\n\nIt is perhaps all the more surprising, then, to encounter this sentiment in Book VII of Thietmar’s history: ‘I would truthfully proclaim … that following the commendation of the soul and completion of the solemn office of burial, no corpse will rise from the dead before the resurrection of all flesh.’18 Thietmar likely composed Book VII four or five years after he wrote Book I. By then, he had changed his mind about how best to explain movements of corpses and appearances of the dead. The cadavers of the deceased lie quiet in the ground after they receive the solemn rite of burial: they do not, on any account, wander forth from their graves. What, then, of reports of dead people coming back to life? Thietmar no longer regarded such events as salutary indicators of Resurrection, but rather as sinister evidence of demonic mischief: ‘The cunning enemy of mortals appears in the image of dead people and tries to delude us. Fools accept his deceit as truth.’ More fool he, then. Of course, blaming evil spirits either for mimicking the dead, or possessing their cadavers, had long been the strategy of choice for sophisticated Christian sceptics called upon to explain reports of ghosts or revenants.19 To frame the switch in terms of the heuristic patterns introduced above, in Book VII Thietmar switched to an Augustinian from his earlier, Gregorian understanding of animate corpses. To wit: they cannot be taken at face value, but are a form of demonic interference and deceit. In so doing, Thietmar was coming into line with the explanatory mechanism that traditionally was preferred by men of higher education and higher clerical orders like himself. Yet Thietmar failed to go back and edit Book I in line with his newly sceptical outlook, thus preserving two distinct interpretations of return from the dead.\n\nMarvelous, Ancient Sacrifices Thus far, I have concentrated on setting forth two explanations that Thietmar of Merseburg offered for appearances of the collective dead. In the early part of his chronicle, he suggested that night-time companies of the dead at worship provide potent evidence for the doctrine of the General Resurrection. In a later passage, he opined that the deceased cannot arise before the end of time; but are simply demons in disguise. In both these cases, however, the heuristic framework was rationalizing and ideologically Christian. Accounts that, in themselves, had no intrinsic theological content, were appropriated to a doxology in which the living, the dead, and demons all have precisely predetermined roles.\n\n26\n\nN.M. CACIOLA\n\nI return now to a key point that requires illumination: the peculiar fact that this apparently pious congregation of dead folk kill the hapless living priest in their midst. This facet of the story is rather puzzling: How ought we to understand these pious, yet murderous, revenants? What kind of cultural logic is expressed in a Christian congregation that kills a cleric? The best point of entry lies in the details of where and how the dead folk killed the priest: these details are specific and they are revelatory. According to Thietmar, the dead men picked up the priest bodily and transported him to the altar before killing him. There, they offered him up, apparently as a sacrifice, in a specific way: they incinerated him, flesh and bones, down ‘to a cinder’. Thietmar’s undead congregation, in short, made of the living priest a burnt offering. And this, in turn, alerts us to the fact that these living cadavers were not fully or self-evidently the Christian dead of this contested region. There is a good case to be made that the underlying core of this urban legend concerned a group of pagan dead folk who managed to invade a once-wrecked, deconsecrated church; who resisted the return of Christian clergy to their reclaimed territory; who arose in a physically embodied form as the pagan dead traditionally were imagined to do; and who engaged in human burnt offering as a form of worship. This makes sense when we recall that burnt sacrifice was well known as a characteristic practice of Northern European paganism, one well attested in both ancient and contemporary sources.20 Indeed, Thietmar himself was fully familiar with the custom. Indeed, it is no coincidence that, just after concluding his stories about revenants, Thietmar was moved to offer an ethnographic sketch of exactly this tradition of human immolation among pagans of the region: Since I have heard marvellous things about their ancient sacrifices, I do not wish to pass over these without mention. … Every nine years … they gather and offer to their gods a burnt offering of ninety-nine men … They believed with certainty that these sacrifices would serve the dead below [inferos].21\n\nIt is telling that Thietmar should offer this description of burnt offerings of human victims only a few short paragraphs after describing how a congregation of revenants burned a living man upon an altar. Significantly, Thietmar’s description of sacrifice is neither formulaic nor repetitive of antecedent works.22 Yet at the same time, the dead in all these tales were celebrating a Christian mass. If the living priest, the vicar of Christ, was in some sense functioning as a pagan burnt sacrifice in this story, at the same time he was\n\n‘NIGHT IS CONCEDED TO THE DEAD’\n\n27\n\noffered upon the altar of a church, the place where the sacrifice of Christ would ritually have been re-enacted in the Eucharist. In fact, the story intermingles pagan and Christian symbolisms rather promiscuously and indifferently; Thietmar himself does not appear concerned to sort them out. It is a frankly syncretistic tale that combines several contrary motifs, a fact that perhaps attests to its survival through oral transmission for some time before being preserved in written form by Thietmar. Other details of the story function in a similarly fluid manner, poised between traditional pagan cultural norms and newer Christian ideals. For instance, Thietmar reported in passing that the defunct congregations gave offerings to their priest. This small feature, which might quickly be glossed over, seems to me quite significant, for it suggests that the dead owned material possessions. In other words, these physically embodied dead folk retained social divisions, material wealth and an economy of exchange. Offerings at mass would normally, in Thietmar’s time, have been coins or small trinkets of value: these informal gifts were used for miscellaneous parish expenses, including support for the mass and as supplementary sustenance for the lower clergy. Thus it is tempting to suggest that the alms of the dead are helping to support intercessions on their own behalf: masses, prayers and offerings were beginning to be part of the regular memoria for the dead in the eleventh century.23 Yet, the detail also implies something else very intriguing: the dead must pursue other activities outside of the communal worship at which they most frequently were observed. The lay dead must have secular engagements that produce goods or wealth, which they then share with their local dead cleric – just as they did in life. In short, the detail of the offerings opens up a vista onto a fuller post-mortem existence. And this, in turn, prompts new questions and observations. Life is characterized above all by change, by shifting temporal rhythms. Indeed, one significant difference between this life and the next is the continually changing nature of vitality: the successive occurrence, and then the passing away, of people and events. The afterlife of the Christian imagination, by contrast, is static in its eternity: since the world to come is perfect and under direct divine governance, there is no place for change. The realms of the Christian afterlife generally lacked the texture of continual events – only graduation from Purgatory and eventually Resurrection. Yet as we have seen, the distinction between vitality and mortality was not always very sharp in the imaginings of medieval people: the dead often were portrayed as an ‘age class’24 of those who had passed on, but who yet remained organized in a complex society. The materialist logic of this representation derives from\n\n28\n\nN.M. CACIOLA\n\nEuropean paganism, in syncretic fusion with Thietmar’s Christian afterlife ideals. When describing the pagan concept of afterlife around the Baltic, for instance, the chronicler Peter of Duisberg wrote, The Prussians used to believe in the resurrection of the flesh, but not in the way they ought to have. They used to believe that if a person was noble or not, rich or poor, powerful or powerless in this life, he would be the same after resurrection in his future life. … [And so] they burnt whatever was appropriate to their station: they believed that things when burnt would rise again with them and serve them as previously.25\n\nAfterlife is a continuation of this life – including the transfer of worldly possessions (burnt sacrifices from the living). And there are versions of this materialist afterlife scattered throughout northern European sources: anecdotes about the dead glimpsed at tournaments, in courts, at the hunt. Usually, when followed home they are found to live inside mountains. Thus, Étienne de Bourbon tells us that, when a peasant followed a dead crowd of huntsmen, they entered Mont du Chat (‘Cat Mountain’) in Savoy. Inside, he found King Arthur and the rest of his long-dead court inhabiting a sumptuous palace: ‘They were playing and dancing, drinking and eating gourmet foods. Finally, he was told to go to bed, and was led to a room with a bed made up with most precious things. On it lay a woman who appeared wondrously beautiful.’26 Gervase of Tilbury and Caesarius of Heisterbach likewise describe Arthur’s glittering court of the dead as persisting inside a mountain, though they identify locations in Norman Italy: Mount Etna, Mount Gyber or Mount Stromboli. Indeed, Caesarius included several tales in his Dialogue on Miracles about different groups of the dead happily residing inside mountains, and welcoming new arrivals as they die. Thomas of Eccleston updated these sorts of tales by reporting that it was the German Emperor Frederick II who ruled over the dead in Mount Etna, an idea he gathered from local gossip while sojourning in the region.27 No doubt, there are strong literary elements in this group of courtly tales, yet the precise form this narrative takes – of the dead forming complex societies inside mountains – is significant. The motif also is found in Iceland: for example Eyrbyggja Saga describes how a shepherd witnessed the mountain of Helga Fell open up to receive a newly dead arrival; he hears the sounds of joyous feasting as the defunct man is welcomed to the community of his dead kinsmen.\n\n‘NIGHT IS CONCEDED TO THE DEAD’\n\n29\n\nPerhaps the richest portrayal of post-mortem society as complex and materialist may be found in the chronicle of Henry of Erfurt, however. A dead man named Reyneke was perceptible to the living as a single ‘little human hand, soft and elegant’. The hand was ‘touched and felt by perhaps a thousand people, though no other part of him could ever be touched or seen’. The phantom’s voice, however, was clearly discerned by all. Accordingly, a crowd gathered at the hand’s location, an inn, and began to question it intently about the forms and customs of the afterlife: When asked what or who it was, it replied, ‘Truly, I am a man and a Christian just like you, baptized in the town of Göttingen …’ ‘Are you alone?’ – ‘No, there is a large community of us.’ ‘What do you do?’ – ‘We eat, we drink, we take wives, we have children; we arrange the weddings of our daughters and the marriages of our sons; we sow and we reap, and various other things just as you do.’28\n\nThis is quite a peculiar conversation. Reyneke assured his interlocutors that he was a faithful baptized Christian just like them, only dead. Yet, his form of afterlife was far from that imagined by the church: it included sowing and reaping in the fields, eating and drinking the fruits of these labours, and most astonishing, marriage and reproduction. The dead, in other words, are fertile: they were imagined as sexual beings whose numbers were not replenished simply by more deaths from among mortal men and women, but through their own self-sustaining fertility. They were assumed to be a fully parallel society that created new ‘life’ on their own; their progeny then grew up in turn, married, had sex and went on to create a new generation of, one supposes, living dead infants. The dead, in short, had an afterlife cycle just like a traditional life cycle. These dead folk led lives of change, rather than impassibility; of temporality, rather than static eternity; of production and reproduction, rather than of sterility and decay. In light of the above explorations, Thietmar’s stories now appear ever more as an appropriation, into a Christian setting, of an originally pagan imaginative construct of an afterlife lived materially and socially.\n\nThinking with\n\nthe\n\nDead\n\nIn conclusion, Why were the dead so ‘good to think with’ for medieval people, and what can we learn from this investigation? As for the first question, the dead were good to think with because they were fluid, rather\n\n30\n\nN.M. CACIOLA\n\nthan fixed, signs. Private religious beliefs relating to the family and the ancestors often are those most resistant to change, for they speak to deep matters of identity, and of connections to the past and to place. For this reason, traditional ways of thinking about the dead were an area of culture that persisted even as Christianization slowly advanced.29 Stories such as Thietmar’s thus represent a kind of afterlife for paganism, both literally and metaphorically. For its part, the medieval Christian theological tradition was fully and definitively otherworldly, focusing intently upon life after death as the sum and goal of all action and experience. In Pierre Chaunu’s phrase, this was ‘the religion of the soul’.30 The overwhelming importance of life after death was an intrinsic part of the pastoral agenda of missionizing clergy, who sought to implant an otherworldly consciousness in the new parishes of Europe. In such a context, rumours of first-­ hand encounters between the living and the dead held an obvious appeal. Moreover, such stories existed in an ambiguous position vis-à-vis Christian doctrine: though not quite orthodox, they never were declared heretical either. Hence they could conveniently be put to use as vivid proofs of the reality of life after death, thus sustaining the central doctrine of the faith. For we modern scholars, investigating the ways in which medieval people imagined the dead casts light upon the multiplicity of overlapping religious epistemologies in the Middle Ages, and their conceptualizations of the human. Indeed, the dead are the ultimate test case for this: simultaneously real and unreal, the dead are people, yet they are not. As wholly imaginary persons, the dead were convenient depositories of social values, serving as a medium of exploration for ideas about how the individual, as a physical microcosm, existed within the macrocosms of society and the well-ordered universe. Yet at the same time, this imaginative aspect of the dead was built upon real memories, real personalities and real cadavers: thus any history of the dead necessarily is both idealist and materialist.\n\nNotes 1.

What did medieval canonists, bishops and other church authorities mean when they referred to heresy?6 The most influential canonist of the Middle Ages, the twelfth-century Bolognese scholar, Gratian, argued that, in the words of Anders Winroth, ‘a heretic is someone who follows false and novel opinions for the sake of worldly gain’.7 Thomas Aquinas described it in his thirteenth-century Summa Theologica as a form of unbelief among those who profess Christianity, which corrupts its dogmas (Hæresis est infidelitatis species ad eos partinens, qui fidem Christi professi sunt, et ejus dogmata corrumpunt).8 A key component of the concept was highlighted by the thirteenth-century Bishop of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste, who, as quoted by Matthew Paris, defined it as ‘an opinion chosen by human perception contrary to holy Scripture, publicly avowed and obstinately defended’ (Hæresis est sententia humano sensu electa, Scripturæ Sacræ contraria, palam edocta, pertinaciter defensa).9 The heretic’s choice of a view contrary to church teaching and its studied resistance to correction, as in Bishop Robert’s characterization, was long held to be a critical component of the crime that helped distinguish it from mere error, but as McSheffrey notes, ‘recently a number of historians have challenged Grosseteste’s emphasis on intentionality in the make-up of the medieval heretic’.10\n\nHERESY AND HETERODOXY IN MEDIEVAL SCANDINAVIA\n\n37\n\nIn addition to heretical views that challenge articles of faith and other established church doctrine, so-called heresy in the first degree, lesser degrees of heresy also exist. These heterodox views are nonconformist, unorthodox and unwelcome, but they are not understood to be as serious as heresy in the first degree.11 A range of suspected errors, of heterodox views, thus exists, extending out from instances of clear and establishable heresy in the first degree. These include sententia haeresi proxima, an opinion approaching heresy but not specifically challenging established doctrine; propositio theologice erronea, a theologically erroneous opinion but not a heretical view; and sententia de haeresi suspecta, a probable but not demonstrable heretical view.12 What then does all this have to do with medieval Scandinavia, a region singularly unrenowned for, and insignificant, it would seem, as regards, heresy? After all, the medieval North experienced no large-scale inquisitions of the sort known from the Continent, a fact usually credited to its lack of extensive organized heretical movements, such as the Waldensians, Cathars, Lollards, Hussites and so on.13 Thus, H.C. Lea, in A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages (1888), argues concerning Niels Johansen in Odense (named by Pope Martin V in 1421 as Inquisitor for the kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden), that ‘there is no trace of his activity in those regions, and the Inquisition may be considered as non-existent there’.14 Even if ecclesiastical institutions geared to suppressing heresy may not have existed on a large scale in the Nordic Middle Ages, we do know that at least some heresies, heretics and substantially heterodox views did, some of which plausibly involve issues connected with witchcraft and magic. How many? The answer, as it turns out, is more uncertain, and, to my eyes in any event, more interesting, than previously thought. At one level, a discussion of this problem could easily turn solely on important if relatively narrow terminological and administrative issues, but my interest resides rather in the broader issue of those who walked outside of, or on, the lines of doctrinal and behavioural acceptability in medieval Scandinavia. How were these ideas of orthodoxy, heterodoxy and heresy understood and employed by bishops, canon lawyers and others in Catholic Scandinavia, and, especially, what sorts of light might such instances shine onto the murky image that emerges of superstition and so-called popular religion in the medieval North? By examining a number of cases where such charges are made or implied, as well as those where they are not, can we arrive at both a better tally of cases of heterodoxy and\n\n38\n\nS. MITCHELL\n\nheresy, and thus a better understanding of spiritual life more generally, in the Nordic Middle Ages?15\n\nTerminology The terms employed in medieval Scandinavia for heresy are well reflected in the late thirteenth-century discussions surrounding the division of responsibility between the church and the Norwegian crown. In documents from 1277 outlining the results of the negotiations between the bishop and the king, the parallel Latin and vernacular documents employ, respectively, Latin heresis and Old Norse-Icelandic villa eða vantru, ‘error or false belief ’, in their enumeration of the cases belonging to the jurisdiction of the church.16 In addition to the specific sense of ‘error’, tha"
