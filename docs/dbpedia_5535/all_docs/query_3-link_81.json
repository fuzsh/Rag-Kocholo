This volume scrutinises the changing status of the human case study, that is, the medical, legal or literary case study that places an individual at its centre. With close reference to the dawning of ‘sexual modernity’ during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and to ideas about sexual identity in the period immediately before and after the fin de siècle, the following chapters examine the case writing practices of selected pioneers of the case study genre.1 Alertness to the exchange of ideas between the empirical life sciences and the humanities is key to A History of the Case Study. Defined by desire to unravel the mystery of human sexuality and the depths of the human condition, the case study can be linked to the modernist project itself. Indeed, the case study can be defined as one of modernity’s vital narrative forms and means of explanation. A History of the Case Study builds on our earlier edited collection, Case Studies and the Dissemination of Knowledge, and outlines how case knowledge actively contributed to the construction of the sexed subject.2 The present volume tells the story of the medical case study genre in a historically and geo- graphically contingent manner, with a focus on Central Europe, extended also to the USA. The lives of individual brokers of case knowledge are pivotal to this book, as is the task of mapping their agency and inter- ventions. ‘Brokers of case knowledge’, however, can be shown to include newly emerging sexual publics, as well as members of professional elites (psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and jurists) and creative writers. These practitioners took up case studies as a representational practice so as to demonstrate or classify a new phenomenon or pathology; to register a deviation from existing knowledge; to raise questions concern- ing the meaning of a given example (and by implication its explanatory framework); and to disseminate specialist knowledge to reading publics.

There resulted a range of case modalities. Such ‘incarnations of case studies’ across different social and disciplinary contexts came to encompass published psychiatric, sexological and psychoanalytic case studies of individuals, as well as case study compilations; unpublished medical notes and juridical case files; autobiographical or journalistic case studies; and fictionalised or fictional case studies (‘case stories’). All of these iterations of the case study are inseparable from the history of three fields or kinds of knowledge: sexology, psychoanalysis and literature. Thecasestudypioneersatthecentreofourinvestigationallparticipated and were actively involved in discourses connected to the disciplinary sphere of medicine, and especially to the psychiatric realm: Austrian psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing embraced patient narratives in an attempt to quantify what he could not measure – the sexual paradigm he presupposed. Psychoanalysts, the majority of whom were trained phys- icians, used the case study genre to reconceptualise the role of creative genius in the light of new scientific and medical insights, or to explore newly urgent socio-political questions, as did Viola Bernard in her analysis of race. State prosecutor Erich Wulffen was able to revitalise the judicial case study genre through the new field of forensics, an imbrication of legal and medical discourse. Physician-writers Oskar Panizza and Alfred Döblin developed new literary cases that incisively commented on specific case writing practices. Each of these writers exemplifies a new language and paradigm, often in competition with other case writers, through which to explore challenges that presented themselves in their time and in their respective fields. An aim of this volume is to chart the emergence and development of the case study in historical terms, and through the medium of biography. Definitions of the case study For the key modern theoretician of the case, André Jolles, case studies belong to the very archetypes of narration.3 Two distinct features define the discursive possibilities of the case study genre: the intrinsic element of judgement; and the ‘abductive’ or ‘guessing’ nature of the case study, which can be used in both inductive and deductive styles of reasoning.4 Case studies are examples or instances that can be used either to illustrate a rule or a norm, or to signal a deviation from it.5 In turn, readers of case studies in varying professional, cultural and historical contexts measure the examples or singular events against the norm. In what Umberto Eco would have called ‘closed’ case studies, clear discursive rules exist within well established fields of knowledge and power, such as the judicial system or institutional religion.6 These fields shape the structure and wording of a case study, but also presume certain values and beliefs on Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n10. ∙ 3 ∙ IntroDuctIon the part of the readership. A case study simultaneously lends itself to re- interpretation, because the genre ‘hovers about’ – to cite Lauren Berlant’s phrase – ‘the singular, the general, and the normative’.7 In comparison with ‘closed case studies’, ‘open case studies’ manipulate their readership in more subtle ways, and with greater insight about their readers, as seen in some psychoanalytic and literary case studies discussed herein. They exploit the genre’s tendency towards undecidability, which introduces ongoing ambiguity and provides the condition for the ever-shifting nature of the case study. In this study, the focus on possibilities for reinterpreting a case study is key; the ‘slippery’ quality of the genre is highlighted, as a result of the volume’s vantage point with regard to the example of the history of sexuality. After Foucault, the case study genre has been identified predominantly as an anchor for new forms of disciplinary authority.8 Scholars of homosexual and transgender history have made an invaluable contribution to revising this narrative, as part of an attempt to restore agency to those subjects who voluntarily embraced sexological discourse.9 Yet case studies were powerfully in play beyond the milieu of specific sexual counterpublics (a term from both Michael Warner and Berlant).10 Their wider workings in relation to a broader history of medical, legal and literary knowledge have not been analysed; neither has the agency of case writers. This volume contributes to the historiography of sexuality by contextualising the preferred case modality of historians of sexuality: the juridical case file. In her study of the ‘passing’ as male of Hungarian count/ess Sandor/Sarolta Vay, Dutch scholar Geertje Mak underlines the subversive nature of juridical case files, in which are gathered a range of statements that are free of editorial intervention and which do not necessarily present a clear conclusion at the end.11 The cacophony within the historical juridical case represents a more evocative and open case modality than the typical sexological case, with the editing process seem- ingly reduced to a minimum, although manipulations of the reader still take place. The seemingly open nature of juridical case writing traditions also prevails in Foucault’s case compilations, most famously in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-Century French Hermaphrodite, published in French in 1978 and in English trans- lation two years later. Here, the task of judgement is apparently left to the reader, framed only minimally by the editor-author. The case is not presented through the lens of a sexological expert seeking to present the ‘true’ sex of the human subject in question. Foucault’s Barbin case begins with the subject’s autobiographical account, moves on to the historical dossier – including a timeline of the course of events, two accounts of sexologists and a handful of newspaper articles and surviving personal documents – and ends with ‘A Scandal at the Convent’, the English translation of a literary account by the German writer Oskar Panizza. Thus, Foucault moves from the intimacy of Barbin’s autobiography to the depersonalisation of the medical case Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n11. ∙ 4 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY study, in order to ambiguously challenge his readers’ propensity to find a single truth defining sexuality.12 The apparent disjunction between autobiographical confession and the clinical language of the medical case studies disquiets the reader, who is left with the knowledge that Barbin’s autobiography was literally cut short by sexologists. That Foucault himself edited the sexological case studies in order to present his pub- lication in this way, and in doing so separated autobiography from the sexological frame narrative, is mentioned only in passing. The trajectory of Foucault’s compilation clearly takes the reader from a subjective to an objective, less authentic mode, which in turn serves to exemplify Foucault’s hypothesis clearly: whatever is fundamental to Barbin’s sex, it is not the truth. Foucault understood that the epistemological nature of case writings always gravitates towards a truth; his writings demonstrate his mastery of the case study genre and its predisposition towards a truth. He inge- niously creates a platform from which to launch his theories of sexuality by capitalising on the confusion that arises in the reader when faced with a range of case studies. Combined with the ongoing interest of historians of sexuality in juridical case files as a valuable resource that ‘can take the researcher beyond the crime itself into the social and cultural worlds in which the act took place’, Foucault’s generic intervention epitomises the strengths and limits of the juridical approach.13 He subverts the juridical case study form, retains its evocative and open aspect, and minimises its powers of judgement in order to question – with a little additional editorial effort – sexological case writings as well. Separating the juridical case files from the narrowly defined context of the court, and opening the genre to new enquiries is a commendable and necessary task for historians of sexuality. Yet it seems ironic that during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, the subjects on trial, as well as the newly forming sexual public or audience for such case studies, often preferred the medical discourse to the punishment of the law. The former was less judgemental, readily accessible and even more risqué. The analysis of the human case study undertaken in this book provides the history of sexuality with a more complex account of how the sexological case was differentiated and disseminated within and across different fields of knowledge, as well as its transnational diffusion during the course of the twentieth century. Of course, the case study predates this history. A brief history of the medical case study Traditionally in medicine, case notes and case studies have been used to develop new categories for disease patterns. In accordance with Ludwik Fleck’s notion that the fundamental problem of medical thinking lies in the need to find laws for irregular phenomena, psychiatrists such as Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n12. ∙ 5 ∙ IntroDuctIon Krafft-Ebing sought such laws.14 Carol Berkenkotter describes how, within psychiatry, both the move away from mainstream scientific discourse, and the central role of case histories in setting the discipline’s professional discourse, produced an increasing emphasis on individual stories.15 Ivan Crozier has noted that psychiatrists learned to interpret case studies as part of their doctoral training and that the choice to publish specific case studies represented their efforts to position themselves in a dynamic new field of knowledge.16 By comparing similar cases, psychiatrists created concepts and categories in an attempt to classify patients and their non-normative – or non-reproductively oriented – desires and behaviours. In these developments, the medical case study became the key form of writing, since it was singularly capable of summarising the patient statement as well as the doctor’s assessment. Krafft-Ebing, for instance, arguably used the mode of the medical case study to order his thoughts on the narrative presented by a given patient, editing, omitting and evaluating what was said, while embedding this knowledge into his own theories of sexual taxonomy. The fact that the early study of sexuality was based primarily on the oral or written testimony of patients con- trolled their statements, but also privileged them. This underlines the possibility of patient agency, and also better explains patients’ desire to participate in the Foucaultian ‘perpetual spirals of power and pleasure’ that defined sexological discourse.17 In other words, the exploration of sexuality became a widely anthropological project, with a propensity to reconceptualise and rewrite patient statements. Such a ‘narrative turn’ constituted a veritable shift away from the body, and presented numerous opportunities and challenges, including the potential for a new interdisciplinarity. Previously, case studies had functioned as a means of conveying and containing medical knowledge about patients’ bodies (notably about their sexual anatomy). Now the focus on testimony and truth-finding forced psychiatrists like Krafft- Ebing to think more deeply about the evidentiary value of their sources. The same concern with testimony and truth-finding also made the medical case study attractive to a range of disciplines and fields of knowledge that relied on the spoken and written word, such as psychoanalysis and litera- ture. The fact that medical interest in sexuality in the nineteenth century was ‘intrinsically linked to forensic medicine’ – as Harry Oosterhuis has forcefully stated – meant, furthermore, that the human case study was situated at the intersection of medical and legal discourses.18 At the advent of sexual modernity, the accessibility of case vignettes in medical case study compilations also proved compelling for lay readers, who were more and more willing to engage with the world around them, and with literary works, through a new scientific paradigm that suited their needs with respect to identity formation. By the 1890s the global base of psychiatry had shifted from France to the German-speaking world. This shift influenced those institutional practices that were affecting the range of emerging case modalities. Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n13. ∙ 6 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY Case writings in France traditionally allowed for a greater permeability between different fields of knowledge. The legal situation in Germany and Austria, as well social and religious taboos, shaped distinctive disciplinary-based case modalities: in Germany and Austria literature had traditionally provided another way of examining ‘pathological’ case studies.19 Yet in German-speaking Central Europe in the late nineteenth century, belles-lettres rarely explicitly portrayed sexual feelings or sexual activity, and did so mostly through suggestion. Sophisticated intellectual debates about sexuality remained sporadic, even for the most revered literary case modality, the German novella. Early psychiatrists regretted such limits in representation, and by 1900 researchers working in the life sciences controversially used the lives of certain creative writers and other ‘cultural greats’ to illustrate psychiatric illness to a lay audience. Due to the powerful nature of medical discourse, literature responded to this medicalisation most vehemently, by means of satire. The proponents of such mockery included: German playwright Frank Wedekind, whose polemic poem ‘Perversität’ (‘Perversity’) was originally titled ‘Krafft- Ebing’; contrarian Viennese cultural critic Karl Kraus; and German entertainer Otto Reutter, whose satirical ‘Hirschfeld song’ (1908) made fun of the classificatory ambitions of sexologists and psychiatrists. Panizza’s Psichopatia criminalis (1898) represents the most poignant example of such a satire, in that he ridiculed the implications of the psychiatrists’ will to classify, and used the formal elements of the medical case study to subvert its meanings. Only after the First World War did writers embrace the empathetic potential of the medical case study with greater self-confidence. The democratisation of Central Europe coincided with the peak and downfall of the case study in its medical guise after 1918. The dissemin- ation of academic and expert knowledge to specific target audiences and, for the first time, to a mass audience returned to the genre a new sense of urgency and morality. Yet this new accessibility coincided with a wider shift in the life sciences away from the case study as an important methodological means; the result was a broad decline in the respectability of the genre. Pedagogical warnings from academic experts lost their appeal. The criminal and sexed subjects who had been the focus of the human case study for three decades now wrote and published their own cases, and found a keen readership. As elaborated in Chapter 4 of the present volume, the authors of such autobiographical texts included master thief and con man Georges Manolescu and convicted sex offenders, such as the paedophile teacher Edith Cadivec. Their autobiographical accounts could include a self-aggrandising romanticisation of sex and crime, and thus helped to foster cultural anxieties, particularly among liberal academic experts. In a politically unstable democratic milieu where the scope for effective censorship was limited, caught between profanisation and moralisation, the liberating and empowering potential of the case study became largely neglected during this period.

After ambiguous beginnings, and a need to separate from psychiatric modes of reasoning, psychoanalysis came into its own as a discipline at this time. However, in the 1930s the overwhelming majority of Central European practitioners were forced into exile, from which most did not return, a pattern that continued throughout the Second World War. From 1945 onwards, the case study as a genre was conspicuously mobilised in numerous contexts, and notably in the USA, where a more open approach to sexuality helped to promote studies by Alfred Kinsey, and William Masters and Virginia Johnson. Sexology The rise of the human case study was shaped by two crucial and inter- related circumstances: its medical origins and its geography. The genre’s prestige was underpinned by the high social status accorded to the spheres of medicine and psychiatry in Germany and Austria in the late nine- teenth century. Always concerned with respectability, in their moralising discourses the middle classes focused on decency and avoided excessively detailed descriptions of sexual matters (with the exception of avant-garde theatre, which frequently pushed the limits of respectability to the brink). Erotic and pornographic writing flourished, but was published in private editions; both kinds of writing were usually censored, and on the same grounds. Within this broader discursive context, sexological case studies presented by far the most respectable framework for the depiction of sexual behaviour, even though their predominant focus on non-normative sexual conditions and identities was generally embedded in a larger forensic discourse of criminality. Edited by medical experts, these historical case studies of sexual pathologies functioned, like medical case studies today, as an attempt to ‘control the subjectivity of the observer-narrator and to stabilise and evaluate the encapsulated narrative of the patient who is its object’.20 The closed form of the sexological case study compilation underlined the respectable nature of the undertaking. Here, case narratives – presented through the threefold structure of anamnesis, personal enquiry and diag- nosis – illustrated newly emerging sexological and psychiatric theories. Since bodies did not ‘speak’ (at least before the onset of hormonal research), and fieldwork included sometimes insurmountable moral and practical difficulties, psychiatrists were obliged to give new levels of credi- bility to their patients’ own statements and words. As a consequence, psychiatrists’ carefully edited summaries of medical case notes were often interspersed with autobiographical material sourced directly from their patients, or from correspondents. Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n15. ∙ 8 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY The formalised configuration of sexological case studies, as well as their presentation in case compilations, adhered to the structure of medical discourse and served, therefore, to rebut criticism from other medical disciplines. The quoted autobiographical materials provided rich evidence of explorations into emerging sexual subjectivities, which included some quite explicit and potentially sexually arousing passages for their readers. The subjects of these case studies sought legitimisation for their sexual preferences, life choices and identities. As Klaus Müller highlights in his account of the historical writings of male ‘inverts’, these individuals presented their autobiographical writings to sexologists voluntarily, and often expressed a desire to aid German science.21 As mentioned above, Foucault has ascribed such desire to the workings of ‘perpetual spirals of power and pleasure’ between sexology and its informants.22 However, sexological case studies provided for an array of emerging sexual subjectivities, subjectivities that were judged by, but also legitimised through, the respectable medical framing narrative. Hence reading offered an opportunity for recognition but also – and this was feared by sexologists and their patients – for sexual arousal. Readers’ reinterpretations of particular passages written in the first person in turn influenced sexological thought, as seen with reference to Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, who was categorised as a masochist by some of his maso- chist readers. This readership reinterpreted Sacher-Masoch’s novellas; their interpretation was then valorised through sexological discourse, and contemporaneously by cultural historians of sexuality, making the readers’ views more socially acceptable at the time. Psychoanalysis Themostpowerfulinnovationinscientificknowledgeofthehumansubject in the second half of the nineteenth century came from psychoanalysis. If sexology created a new platform for modern subjectivities, psycho- analysis made the relationship between analyst and patient the central scene of the (talking) cure and offered a new understanding of the reading public at large. Different from psychiatry and sexology, psychoanalysis reflected on the idealising trends of the German public in a sophisticated manner, and regularly expressed the fear that expert deliberations on genius and creativity would be interpreted as a defamation of national idols. Psychoanalyst Wilhelm Stekel sought to counter resistance to such interrogation in 1912: Until recently the maxim prevailed that the image of a great artist needs to be conveyed in an untainted form to posterity. Biographers saw their main task in removing dark chapters – or what they conceived to be dark chapters – from the life of their ‘hero’ and to convey an image of impeccable shine. We nearly retained a gallery of great human beings, a Valhalla of farouche gods, had not the accounts of one artist or the other, just like Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n16. ∙ 9 ∙ IntroDuctIon their works, taught us from time to time that geniuses – be they inventors, philosophers, founders of religions, poets and artists – are only human beings, with all their mistakes. What they lost in scope, they won in love and deepened insight.23 While analysts used the case study more self-reflexively than psy- chiatrists, both were vividly aware of the genre’s persuasive hold as an instrument of projection and objectification. The heated nature of debates concerning artists and creativity in psychoanalytic circles owed much to the identification of psychoanalysts with creative artists. Sigmund Freud himself considered these tendencies in the German readership by developing a new case modality, the dialogic-psychoanalytic case study, which considered fragments of the life and oeuvre of creative minds. The impetus for Freud’s variant of the case study was partly his wish to avoid causing offence to his middle-class readership. Psychoanalysis was conceptualised as a life science; like literature, psychoanalysis was considered to stand astride the presumed divide between science and arts, and so it provided a bridging link between the two fields of psychiatry and literature. In the history of psychoanalysis, the years 1906–14 engendered what Frank J. Sulloway has called, by way of criticism, a literary style of reasoning.24 While psychoanalytic case studies decisively differed from their psychiatric counterparts, the scientific self-image of psychoanalysis is undeniable. John Forrester, in his pioneering article ‘Thinking in cases’, best describes how psychoanalysis created ‘a new way of telling a life in the twentieth century, a new form for the specific and unique facts that make that person’s life their life; and at the same time, it attempts to render that way of telling a life public, of making it scientific’.25 Received more positively than implied by Freud, psychoanalyticapproacheswereincorporatedintootherdisciplinaryfields, while also meeting some resistance. Overall, psychoanalysis pioneered the case study as a methodological approach and produced ‘an authoritative form that is distinctly interdisciplinary, profound and enduring’.26 In the USA, the period between 1945 and 1965 witnessed the rapid rise of psychoanalytic psychiatry. By the mid-twentieth century, psycho- analysis was becoming well accepted; increasing numbers of psychiatrists with medical backgrounds, were beginning to train in this approach.27 Psychoanalytic writings found expression in the popular arena through films, literature and magazines, and over this period ideas from Freud’s writings and his immediate circle of adherents found expression in many cultural forms.28 Literature Most recently among historians of sexuality as well as literary scholars, debate about the making of sexual modernity has emphasised the inter- play between the realms of science and those of literature and cultural Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n17. ∙ 10 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY history. While literature played an important role in the formation of sexological knowledge in England and France, the role of literature in the German lands has been understood differently.29 French writers of the nineteenth century had already observed that the modern age urgently needed to anchor its literature in real life and to document modern maladies. The sickness of their era was hysteria, and writers such as Gustave Flaubert plumbed this topic for a voracious readership.30 In German-speaking Central Europe the mere perusal of Krafft-Ebing’s medical case study compilation Psychopathia Sexualis was feared to have ‘psychopathic effects’ on some readers. This is at least in part attributable to the belief of medical elites that masturbation had a detrimental influ- ence on the mental health of individuals. Thus it is hardly surprising that Krafft-Ebing originally hesitated to include references to literary works in his oeuvre. Between 1886 and 1890 he discussed literary works and their authors – such as the Marquis de Sade or Jean Jacques Rousseau – only whenother,mostlyFrenchsexologistshadcitedthembeforehand.31 Krafft- Ebing also remained within the bounds of bourgeois sexual respectability by avoiding references to the plethora of erotic fiction that could have provided a useful source for his studies. Such material – whether relatively respectable works of erotic fiction marketed to middle-class men; pulp fiction; saucy romance novels or photographs – was available to wide segments of the male population in the late nineteenth century through the black market in erotica and pornography.32 Initially, the moral division in the German-speaking world between erotica and belles-lettres prompted a turn to satire among literary writers. The most provocative example of such satire, Panizza’s Psichopatia criminalis, represents the inversion of the case study genre. However, by the early twentieth century, bourgeois forms of cultural expression needed to adapt so as to contend with newer maladies and social ills. As the privileged cultural form of the Bildungsbürgertum, literature faced challenges from many quarters, challenges that an ‘empirical turn’ could not adequately address without a more radical reinvention of the parameters of literature itself. In the modern metropolis, the writers of belles-lettres found themselves confronted by the great complexity and interconnectivity of life forms, and with competing and multiplying forms of knowledge about these life forms. Any attempt to make sense of the many innovations in science and the arts felt daunting. Indeed, especially since the rise of naturalist movements, writers of literature experienced immense pressure to move with the times. Each successive new movement or style that emerged in the first two decades of the twentieth century – expressionism, Dada, surrealism and the avant-garde – sought to address the many economic, political and social crises of the era in different ways. Expressionism, which dominated the literary scene in the years from 1910 to 1925, was advocated as a corrective to naturalism, challenging perceptions of reality far more radically than before. In the words of Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch, the predominant Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n18. ∙ 11 ∙ IntroDuctIon way all writers adapted material from real life for literature was ‘by smashing it’: ‘the prevailing world no longer offers them a representable illusion which may be fashioned into a story, but just emptiness and inside this some mixable rubble’.33 Both naturalist and expressionist writers had striven to incorporate the latest findings from disciplines as disparate as medicine, psychiatry, sexology, criminology and the law. As was typical in the aftermath of the First World War, writers were unsure of the future of literary markets and of what increased competition from other media might mean for their livelihoods. In this rapidly modernising field, the case study genre arguably became for a brief time ‘the answer’ to ‘the problem’ that literature had become. Yet in the process of espousing this answer, the resultant literature became almost incomprehensible, shaped by an anxiety, if not a neurosis, about shoring up each work’s epistemological foundations. Literature became a laboratory, a humanistic corollary to the laboratories of other life sciences from which it borrowed some of its inspiration. Still, in taking on the empirical world, as well as the worlds of fiction and make-believe, literature came almost entirely unstuck. Joe Cleary has contended that the collapse of the European imperial world brought about the collapse of the Anglo-French literary world system. Until the First World War, Paris and London were the un- contested centres of world literature; bourgeois realism and the advent of the novel were considered the supreme achievements of world literature. According to this view, the ‘breakup of the old London- and Paris-centred literary world-system’ sparked a concomitant crisis of realism.34 By far the greatest threat to realism, and hence to the dominant literary world system, came from the newer fashion of modernism. As Cleary points out, interestingly, the major theorists of the modern novel of the early twentieth century – as well as its main detractors – all came from the semi-periphery of the literary world system. Georg Lukács was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Erich Auerbach hailed from Berlin, Mikhail Bakhtin from Oryol in Russia. Most of them cast this aesthetic crisis in catastrophic and even apocalyptic terms. Due to their personal experience of collapsing empires and regimes, these theorists and critics could not help but view the downfall of realism as the passing of a literary style. Moreover, in all but one of their accounts, modernist literature had itself become symptomatic of a more global, far-reaching trend of declining morality and value systems.35 The antidote they envisaged was to turn the clock back to an earlier mode of representation based on realism and mimesis. For example, Auerbach praised the more moderate modernist Virginia Woolf over the more radical Irish modernist James Joyce, because of Woolf’s ability to portray with ‘realist depth’.36 Lukács pitted Joyce, Döblin and Robert Musil unfavourably against Alexander Pushkin and Thomas Mann. He argued that Joyce and Döblin displayed ‘a morbid preoccupation with the perversely atypical’, while Mann and Pushkin confronted the spiritual problems of the German and Russian peoples.37 Although Bakhtin’s account of the rise and fall of realism differs Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n19. ∙ 12 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY from those offered by Auerbach and Lukács, his work, too, in the view of Cleary, is ‘in the throes of the terrific European and world crisis that had erupted with devastating effect in World War I and would erupt again, even more violently, in World War II’.38 The return to realism that many intellectuals from Central Europe imagined as the answer to modernity’s aporias involved a rethinking of the relationship between the arts and sciences. It required writers to undo the strict division of natural sciences from the arts or humanities (Geisteswissenschaften), which, although a hallmark of the age, cultural historians today commonly regard as obsolete. In recent years, European literary scholars such as Ottmar Ette have emphatically stressed litera- ture’s affinity with the life sciences. Ette describes literature as an ‘experimental dynamic space’ that is concerned with the social aspects of life, that is, our ‘knowledge-of-living-together’ (ZusammenLebens- Wissen).39 Bernhard J. Dotzler argues in a similar vein. He remarks that literature itself can be an ‘exploratory practice’, in multiple senses of the term.40 Latterly, rather than seeking the points of intersection between the human and the natural sciences, literary scholars have been keen to explore the particular ‘poetology of knowledge’ that supports literary knowledge in distinction to other forms. Before discussing ways in which the various writers and thinkers discussed in this volume grappled with these questions, it is worth recollecting that all literature simultaneously conveys knowledge and processes it.41 As Dotzler affirms, nonetheless, not all knowledge is science.42 *** A History of the Case Study begins in Chapter 1 with an exploration of the influence of literature on both sexology and psychiatry in the early history of these fields during the late nineteenth century, an era in which human case studies were used to stabilise knowledge and to dismantle it. That chapter investigates the agency of the sexual public, and the indirect power wielded by these readers and patients of sexology in defending the truth of sexological case writings. Through the works and the figure of Sacher-Masoch, the chapter considers how during this period medical case studies functioned as sites of reinterpretation by doctors, and by sexological patients and other members of an emerging sexual public. Sacher-Masoch’s literary case study, his novella Venus im Pelz (Venus in Furs), constitutes the first fictional account of what became known as masochism; readers’ reinterpretation of the novella demonstrates how an emerging sexual public reappropriated an alleged biographical truth about the author. Ian Hacking – who has described himself as a ‘philosopher of the particular case’ – speaks of the ‘looping effect of classifying human beings’; Hacking’s phrase expresses how ‘classifying changes people, but the changed people cause classifications themselves to be redrawn’.43 Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n20. ∙ 13 ∙ IntroDuctIon Chapter 1 describes such a looping effect and exemplifies how a newly forming sexual public, valorised through medical discourse, created an important epistemological shift in sexologists’ thinking about authors. Chapter 2 turns to another discipline that was crucial to the formation of the modern sexual subject: psychoanalysis, which was in the 1890s and into the early decades of the twentieth century a discipline ‘in the making’. The chapter investigates how psychoanalysis and its proponents co-opted and adapted the medical case study as an extant and authori- tative rhetorical form through which to forge a new mode of enquiry. Like sexologists, psychoanalysts were keen advocates of the case writing method, adapting techniques and writing styles from medical case his- tories and also from literature. Psychiatrists as well as psychoanalysts in the German-speaking world explored the discursive connection between insanity and creativity. Additionally, Chapter 2 examines how psychoanalysts sought to incor- porate and adapt sexological pathographies into psychoanalytic thought. Responses within the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (WPV) to Isidor Sadger’s psychoanalytic biographies of writers and their works fuelled a debatethatdirectlycontributedtoFreud’sdevelopmentofpsychoanalytic case writing. Much of Freud’s thinking about artists and writers can be found in the works of Otto Rank. Freud advised Rank, and collaborated with him while Rank was theorising the creative personality for his book Der Künstler (The Artist), first published in 1907; the collaboration continued for many years. Freud took the debate concerning creative genius to a new methodological level. He concluded that – as intensive discussions within the WPV had shown – the life and work of artists, like the life and work of any patient, could not be encapsulated in a single case study. Rather, the psychoanalytic method could represent only a certain aspect of a patient’s life. This finding freed the case study genre from its biographical focus and made it a site of explanation rather than mere illustration.44 Late nineteenth-century and fin-de-siècle writers first engaged with the case study genre in its psychiatric and psychoanalytic manifestations by means of satire, as recounted in Chapter 3. The chapter contrasts the interpretative powers of modern sexual publics and professional elites with the agency of the writer. It does so through enquiry into Panizza’s satirical and delusional negotiation of the boundaries between the two ‘cultures’ of art and science (pace C. P . Snow). Panizza’s first exposure to the case study genre was in the context of his training as a psychiatrist. More than a decade before Freud’s elaborations on the psychoanalytic case, Panizza made the human case study a central form in his literary oeuvre. Panizza’s case writings encompass two modalities through which literature engaged with the case study genre: he fictionalised actual patient case studies and he parodied medical case writing in his biting anti-psychiatric work Psichopatia criminalis. Panizza’s engagement with the case study genre remains haunted by his own unruly psyche.

His case writings took the shape of cultural historical studies of topics related to his progressively more delusional inner world, and so they contributed to the process of Panizza’s self-destruction. A short investigation into the way that psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic case studies enabled literary satire concludes the chapter. A History of the Case Study also investigates the widely neglected field of juridical sexology, Chapter 4 showing how Wulffen’s works incorporated literary knowledge into a legal and criminological framework. The chapter focuses on the pedagogical imperatives of legal reform and on Wulffen’s recourse to the case study genreso that he might appeal to various coexist- ing professional, literary and mass audiences. His professional investment in the case study makes for a telling illustration of the rise and fall of the genre in the first decades of the twentieth century, when the increasing dissemination and accessibility of case modalities beyond the professional realms of the clinic and the court led to a change in its status. In order to popularise issues of legal reform, Wulffen exploited the accessible nature of the case study genre in an attempt to reach a wider audience, and he wrote some of the first published expert case studies that addressed both a professional and an educated public. While Wulffen’s expert case studies were highly successful during the Wilhelmine era, the same approach and model for case writing met a more critical audience after 1918. Wulffen embraced the challenge of a new democratic environment by writing implicitly didactical popular crime novels. However, eventually his criminal subjects literally ‘wrote back’ after their sensationalised trials, using case studies in an attempt to narrate their own versions of events. The accounts of these criminals-turned-writers were often more marketable, influential and financially successful than the accounts by sexological or legal experts such as Wulffen. Thus the popularisation of sensationalist case studies written, for instance, by perpetrators of crime, was an important factor in the case study genre’s loss of respectability. After the First World War, realist literature continued to be informed by new configurations of knowledge around the criminal and pathological self.ThisiswitnessedinChapter5,whichconcentratesonworksbyDöblin, a medical doctor and a main representative of the 1920s New Objectivity aesthetic movement in Germany. Other authors were preoccupied with questions of social justice, but Döblin was particularly interested in gender relations and sexually motivated violence. He represented these by drawing on contemporary psychoanalytic and sexological discourses about masochism and sadism. Many of Döblin’s main characters were convicted criminals and he fashioned himself in his autobiographical writings as a literary Jack the Ripper. This coincided with the publication, for the first time, of convicted criminals’ autobiographical accounts of their own lives outside the spheres of the clinic and the public of the court.

The latter had developed an appetite for shocking crime stories based on empirical cases. In the lead-up to the outbreak of the First World War, writers in major cities such as Berlin, Vienna and Munich had begun to tackle several of the pressing social problems of the age, and after the war many continued to focus on war-related problems such as war trauma, shell-shock and sexually motivated violence. Readers’ interest was heightened by additional anxieties of the age concerning society’s decadence and the perils of accelerated modernisation and urbanisation. Somewhat to their surprise, doctors and judges also found themselves in competition with an unexpected source of knowledge about the criminal underworld. This competition was provided by the latest craze in first-person accounts penned by the con men and criminals themselves. Possibly, the writer of middlebrow to highbrow literature with insider knowledge of crime still had some advantage over criminals, but he or she needed to find fresh ways to seize the attention of an audience. If there was an unmet demand for criminal material, then Döblin, practising as a social welfare doctor in one of Germany’s most seductive and dangerous metropolises, was well placed to respond. Chapter 6 discusses the use of the psychoanalytic case study in a very different and modern form, drawing on the dramatically different historical context of post-war American politics and society, and the civil rights movement. The writing and experience of Viola Bernard, a psychoanalyst of German-Jewish background, is the subject of Chapter 6. Bernard’s history allows for a close examination of the transnational and transcultural aspects of sexuality and psychoanalysis in connection with the case study genre. The chapter describes a set of circumstances in which case writing from one discipline was brought to bear directly on a landmark juridical case, and demonstrates how the wide dispersal of the rhetoric of the case study within the public domain can be placed in the service of a socio-political cause. Rather than an examination of a case modality per se, here the theme is a case study ‘in formation’. The issue of race is brought into the expert purview of psychoanalysis, and Bernard is involved in assisting the development of a highly topical and trans- formative case study narrative about black subjects for and within the African-American community. Through the figure of Bernard, Chapter 6 points to the challenges involved in publicly advocating case studies that have immediate, appreciable consequences for redefining a long- institutionalised ‘norm’ such as racial segregation. As such, the chapter sustains the approach taken in earlier ones, referencing an individual’s pioneering case writing with an attunement to its radical implications. Laura Doan has recently argued that, for the historian of modern sexuality, the ways ‘in which the normal might be seen as jostling against … existing discourses of morality and class-inflected notions of respect- ability’ can represent a major challenge.45 The analysis of the case study Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n23. ∙ 16 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY genre presented in this volume contributes to a more multifaceted under- standing of the formation of knowledge and the agency of case writers. The reinterpretation and circulation of knowledge undertaken by those foregrounded in the following chapters did not take the form of the case by chance. John Frow has argued that the work of genre ‘is to mediate between a social situation and the text which realizes certain features of this situation, or which responds strategically to its demands’.46 Case studies exemplify a norm and are measured against other norms by their readers in varying professional, cultural and historical contexts. For this reason they are bound more tightly to their interpretative framework than other genres.47 They can often be found at the forefront of knowledge formation, since they have the ability to poignantly epitomise deviation from a presumed norm. At the same time, they rely on a framework of interpretation, however exploratory; changing frameworks and imme- diate historical contexts, in turn, may gravely alter or compromise the given interpretation of a case study’s meaning. A History of the Case Study highlights this vital, generative aspect of the case study genre.

The case remained a site of dialogue and reinterpretation for nearly thirty years, far exceeding the naming of masochism after Austrian writer Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1836–95) by sexologist and psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840–1902). The narrative of Sacher-Masoch as a masochist emerged only with the establishment of psychiatry and only after the transition within medical thought from the anatomical world of sex to that of sexual identity.2 Generic similarities between Sacher-Masoch’s novellas and the medical case study eased this transposition of ideas from the literary to the sexological realm for Krafft-Ebing’s patients – and for a newly emerging sexual public that reinterpreted the original meaning of Sacher-Masoch’s Venus im Pelz (Venus in Furs). In current scholarship, the naming of masochism after Sacher-Masoch denotes the clash between the clinic and the literary world in an iconic manner. The contentious naming has a history considered at once simplistic and presumptuous; it is commonly represented as an oversim- plification of the intricate relationship between Sacher-Masoch the author and his writing, and – by extension – between authors and their works in general.3 This critique of the subjugation of literary discourse to the act of sexological classification seems particularly warranted in light of the immense academic and public success of the category of masochism – a category which, by the early twentieth century, had proven crucial to the understanding of the principles of sexual formation and human be- haviour.

To analyse the ‘caseness’ of masochism reveals a more complex picture.4 The outcome of the struggle for new ways to debate love and sex was a distinctive discourse of sexuality that became a central feature of individual identity, as Michel Foucault first observed.5 By the turn of the nineteenth century, masochism had evolved into an established field of truth and falsehood.6 Patients needed to recognise themselves in such a field, while the endeavour of sexologists was to recognise the truth and falsity of their patients’ statements.7 Meanwhile, literary and medical case studies contributed to the growing understanding of a new language of love and sex. As first observed by Harry Oosterhuis in his biography of Krafft- Ebing, during the late nineteenth century, while sexology was in its foundational phase, patients actively contributed to the construction of sexological terminology.8 Their life experience, including their interpreta- tion of literary works, resonates clearly in these early medical works, and its impact on sexological methodology was greater than has hitherto been acknowledged. Specifically regarding masochism, literary knowledge preceded scientific knowledge and was reinterpreted by Krafft-Ebing’s patients, who functioned as the translators between the world of sex and that of sexuality. A proliferation of cases accompanies the making of masochism. And henceforth the case study became a vehicle for the transformation of literary into scientific knowledge, and vice versa. First published in 1870, Sacher-Masoch’s Darwinian novella Venus im Pelz represents an innovative mode of genre writing, and was part of a larger exploration of nature that allowed the author to represent the crisis of love at the dawn of the scientific age. Sacher-Masoch was the first German writer to contend with Darwinian thought, and he had a unique stance on questions concerning love. His approach contrasted with that of the generation of Darwinian writers who succeeded him from the 1890s onwards; these authors highlighted the unity of man and nature. Sacher-Masoch’s Darwinian novellas presented a new literary-scientific voice, and allowed him to open the pervasive genre of the novella – the most common contemporary form for the literary case study – to highly topical matters of intimacy and sexuality. His interest was not unlike that of Krafft-Ebing, who set out to investigate sexual perversions and pathologies: Sacher-Masoch problematised the role of love and sexuality in the human world and explored its ‘dark sides’.9 As the above terminology suggests, Sacher-Masoch’s novellas refer to a Darwinian rather than a sexological discourse. That is, the literary freedom he exercised to explore the subjectivity of ‘supersensualism’, a formation of identity related to that of masochism, was not embedded in a sexological framework of meaning. Sacher-Masoch’s literary-scientific investigation explored ways in which humankind was able to resolve the tension between natural instincts and an ethical life.

Changing atti- tudes towards Venus im Pelz in subsequent decades culminated in the identification of the author with his antihero Severin von Kusiemski, and paradigmatically represent the shift from an anatomical to a psychiatric style of reasoning. A close reading of the cases and their shifting frameworks surrounding the reception of Venus im Pelz sheds light on the circulation of the case study as a discursive form and on the gradual acceptance of masochism as a highly specific category for sexual proclivity. Much of this encounter was shaped by the interdependence between psychiatry and literature at the very moment when German psychiatry was founded. This is not to say that the debate about Venus im Pelz was confined to the realm of the clinic. Just as psychiatry relied on patient confessions and cultural histories to construct knowledge, the multitude of (auto)biographical and literary cases in public discourse were at least partly modelled on medical case studies. After Sacher-Masoch’s ‘outing’ by his biographer, and his subsequent pathologisation in the psychiatric realm, the debate surrounding Sacher-Masoch shifted from his work to his perceived sexual identity. This was followed by autobiographical and biographical case studies that referenced medical discourse. To analyse Sacher-Masoch’s work through the lens of the case study genre is to investigate the intricate question of the development of a language of sexuality. It shows that masochist identity formation was based at least partly on the reinterpretation of a literary case, and reveals important insights concerning the construction and currency of this new language of sexuality. The sexological case: Krafft-Ebing and the merits of literature In his seminal work Psychopathia Sexualis (1886), Krafft-Ebing coined the key sexual pathologies of modernity: the homosexual, the fetishist, the sadist and the masochist. The concept of masochism became so popular that Sigmund Freud, in his 1924 study ‘Das ökonomische Problem des Masochismus’ (‘The Economic Problem of Masochism’), declared ‘it is unnecessary to quote cases to illustrate this; for the material is very uniform and is accessible to any observer, even to non-analysts’.10 The naming of a sexual perversion after a well known author left a sour taste early on. Russian imperial prosecutor Dimitry Stefanowski, a competitor in the race to develop a sexual taxonomy, argued that Krafft-Ebing had ‘covered the name of the novelist with ignominy’.11 In his academic works, Stefanowski insisted on Sacher-Masoch’s sexual normalcy, yet misinterpreted the intention of the original name-giving, which in fact paid tribute to Sacher-Masoch as an expert in the understanding of masochism. In these early years, Krafft-Ebing at no point implicated Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n29. ∙ 22 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY the writer but justified the naming through the fact that ‘the well-known novelist Sacher-Masoch has made this sexual perversion the favourite subject of many of his novels, especially in the famous Venus im Pelz’.12 As revealed by the fluctuating archive represented by successive editions of Psychopathia Sexualis, Krafft-Ebing’s tribute to Sacher-Masoch’s writing marked a methodological shift in his treatment of literature – an acceptance of literary texts as medical evidence. Krafft-Ebing owed this acceptance largely to his patients, since they referred to Venus im Pelz as the most accurate portrayal of their own desires. The sexologist’s appre- ciation of Sacher-Masoch waned only after 1901, when he first identified the author as a masochist and thus subjugated him to medical norms.13 Case studies form the backbone of Psychopathia Sexualis, which was first published in 1886 and quickly revised and enlarged. The importance of the case study genre for Krafft-Ebing can be explained by his pro- fessional context. During his lifetime the renowned sexologist published eleven editions; by 1924 the seventeenth edition had been released. Krafft- Ebing’s cases typically commence with a short physical description of the patient, and summarise the psychiatric family history. Reminiscent of the anatomo-clinical gaze dominant before the rise of sexology, the physical description could include genital anomalies.14 The core of the case study consisted of the description of sexual behaviours – reported to Krafft-Ebing by the patient and rephrased by the sexologist. Over time, he relied on an increasing variety of testimonies. The first edition of Psychopathia Sexualis mainly comprises the collection of cases already published in the field, showing Krafft-Ebing to have been widely read in various languages.15 In the 1890s, Krafft-Ebing sometimes privileged cases of individuals who had entered into correspondence with him, suffering from what they themselves perceived as deviant conditions and seeking an exchange with a medical expert in order to come to terms with their own feelings about their desires. Krafft-Ebing assumed that his correspondents agreed to the publication of their anonymised cases.16 As with the collection on homosexuality, the number of masochist cases pub- lished increased considerably over the years.17 His case correspondences concerning the more general field of neuropathology included letters from sufferers and their carers, case notes from colleagues, or other sources such as newspaper articles.18 Comparable evidence from his masochist patients did not exist or has not survived. With his reputation on the rise, Krafft- Ebing’s access to clinical and judicial cases increased, and these form the almost exclusive source of new cases in the editions of Psychopathia Sexualis from the late 1890s onwards. The sexological turn from patient bodies to patient narratives consti- tuted a paradigm shift, and attracted medical critics. In the eyes of some members of the medical profession, the entanglement of patient narra- tives with doctor narratives in attempts to coin new sexual taxonomies threatened to subvert professional standards, through the creation and dissemination of speculative knowledge.

The American journal Alienist and Neurologist stated in a review of the work: ‘a book to be read only by the sexually mature and psychically balanced. In its psychopathic effects it might prove dangerous in its influence over the neuropathically unstable. To the prurient curiosity of that morbid sexual element, which too extensively abounds in modern social life, its examples and personal histories would prove psychopathic poison.’21 Krafft-Ebing’s methodology was also scrutinised by his direct competitors in the field. Stefanowski’s critique of the naming of masochism has already been mentioned, while in the context of homosexuality Krafft-Ebing was accused of trusting his patients too much – patients who, critics argued, were prone to lying because of the discrimination they faced and the double lives they were forced to lead.22 Krafft-Ebing’s response to such criticism was differentiated, adhering to standards of academic credibility and bourgeois respectability; the latter had become entrenched by the beginning of the nineteenth century.23 From the mid-1890s onwards, he used Latin for overtly explicit passages of Psychopathia Sexualis, in an attempt to rein in those critics who feared for the ‘sanity’ of his readership. This certainly made his work less accessible to the lower classes, and to women, who learned modern rather than classical languages at school. As the example of Stefanowski shows, Krafft-Ebing rebuffed academic debates within his professional publications, with direct ripostes often printed in the latest edition of Psychopathia Sexualis. When it came to the relationship with his patients, however, Krafft-Ebing would not open himself to scrutiny. Biographer Harry Oosterhuis has indicated that Krafft-Ebing was held in high regard by many of his patients and that his concern for patients often went beyond mere professional commitment.24 Exactly how these relationships werestructuredandhowKrafft-Ebingtransposedhisknowledgeofpatient ‘confessions’ into case studies remains difficult to reconstruct. Yet from his case vignettes it becomes clear that patients served as his ‘informants’. Krafft-Ebing recognised their identificatory reading of Venus im Pelz – even if he did not necessarily agree with their interpretation. Yet, and dissimilarly to comparable studies in England and France, fiction played only a minor role in the first four editions of Psychopathia Sexualis.25 Krafft-Ebing considered literary works that might have met the criteria of respectability naive in the area of psychiatry. While attest- ing that literary writers possessed a deep understanding of the human psyche, he viewed their works as overtly idealising – a comment on the tHE SHIFtInG cASE oF MASocHISM: SAcHEr-MASocH’S VENUS IM PELZ Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n31. ∙ 24 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY strong strand of post-Darwinian pantheism in German literature that celebrated the unity of nature and man.26 Introducing the first edition of Psychopathia Sexualis he argued: For now poets are the better psychologists, rather than experts in psychol- ogy and philosophy. But they are emotionalists rather than rationalists and definitely biased in the depiction of their topic. This is because they only see the sunny and cozy side of the subject matter, and not its deep shadows.… To deal with the psychopathology of sexuality in an academic treatise means to be confronted with the dark side of human life and misery, in whose shadows the shining idol of the poet turns into a hideous grimace, and morality and aesthetics become insane in the face of the ‘image of God’.27 Only four years later, Krafft-Ebing’s approach to literature took a definiteturn.In1890hepublishedhisNeuereForschungenaufdemGebietder Psychopathia Sexualis (Newer Research into Psychopathia Sexualis). This can be described as a spin-off from Psychopathia Sexualis which presented cutting-edge research – and integrated literature methodologically into the chain of evidence. It was in this work that Krafft-Ebing first named masochism in obeisance to Sacher-Masoch, since so many of his patients referred to Venus im Pelz as fundamental for the understanding their own condition. The case study at the heart of Neuere Forschungen is that of Mr X from Berlin, a ‘highly cultured man’, according to Krafft-Ebing, and ‘the stimulus for this study’.28 Of good social standing, Mr X showed profound insight into his own condition and provided his autobiography voluntarily. His eloquence implied that he had overcome the shame associ- ated with his condition, at least to the extent of being able to write about it. Having attracted the attention of a medical specialist, he entrusted Krafft-Ebing with his autobiographical account. To have been quoted in the Neuere Forschungen must have given Mr X some satisfaction, since he is noted as having been keen to ‘serve science’.29 Krafft-Ebing’s fascination with his Berlin correspondent is written all over the Neuere Forschungen volume. He does not claim Mr X as the author of the term ‘masochism’, as Oosterhuis has suggested.30 Nevertheless, Krafft-Ebing’s new notion of literature is intimately linked to the case of Mr X. Directly before presenting Mr X’s autobiographical account, Krafft-Ebing outlines his new taxonomy of textual evidence, one that differentiates between patient statements, autobiographical accounts and literary works. Patient statements rank highest, since these have been established in a medical context and can be verified by medical authority. Autobiographies such as Les Confessions (1782) by Jean Jacques Rousseau rate second – even as this text is pronounced a ‘superb example of good self-observation’.31 Works of fiction are positioned last. They merit inclu- sion if they depict the shadowy aspects of love, exploring taboo subjects otherwise inaccessible to the medical practitioner, such as female sadism, of which Krafft-Ebing writes: ‘it is of great interest if such occurrences Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n32. ∙ 25 ∙ appear in literary works. Even though they cannot be of the same value as case histories [Krafft-Ebing’s term for medical case studies], they are of psychological interest since the author must have drawn from his own experience or at least must have felt in such a way’.32 Krafft-Ebing then introduces the case study of Mr X and describes his patient’s appreciation of autobiographical and literary texts. Mr X reveals I was looking for connections with my preferred fantasies in all kinds of literature. Rousseau’s Confessions, which fell to me, were a great revelation. I found experiences portrayed which at crucial points were similar to my own. I felt even more surprised when I realised how my ideas agreed with the literary works of Sacher-Masoch. I devoured them all with desire, despite the fact that many of the bloodthirsty scenes far exceeded my own fantasies.33 Mr X’s account also offers insight into a masochist subculture in which Sacher-Masoch’s text plays an important role. In Vienna a man of exceptional standing has undertaken trips to the Prater, dressed as a servant, on the coach box of his mistress. This was probably a deliberate imitation of Venus im Pelz. In general it seems to me that the works of Sacher-Masoch have contributed much to the development of this perversion in people disposed to it.34 The same notion is emphasised by the subject of Case 10, who ‘believes he could only be attracted to women who resembled the heroines in Sacher-Masoch’s novels’.35 Consequently, in the second edition of Neuere Forschungen Krafft-Ebing concludes: ‘as becomes clear from the above observations, many individuals afflicted with this perversion explicitly refer to Sacher-Masoch’s works as typical representations of their own psychological condition’.36 The concept of masochism underwent marked conceptual and editorial shiftsinthe1890s;asearlyasthesecondeditionof theNeuereForschungen, the case of Mr X begins to recede into the background.37 Krafft-Ebing shortens the autobiographical account, removing passages that point towards a more general nervous disorder, and editing the case to fit more obviously into his suggested disease pattern.38 Any reference to original correspondence with Mr X is omitted, and Krafft-Ebing quotes as his own the cultural history of masochism previously provided by his informant.39 While it stands to reason that Mr X felt some disappointment at this loss of importance, such modifications were common in the practices of sexological and medical writing, and were not considered unethical in these professional contexts. Krafft-Ebing’s revised concept of the role of authors, however, would remain unaltered for the remainder of his career, with literary works continuing to function as a useful means of gaining insight into taboo subjects. He explored in passing the pathologies of writers like de Sade and Rousseau, and even the canonical German writer tHE SHIFtInG cASE oF MASocHISM: SAcHEr-MASocH’S VENUS IM PELZ Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n33. ∙ 26 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY Heinrich von Kleist.40 While Krafft-Ebing clearly stated that certain authors were afflicted with sexual pathologies – as Anna Katharina Schaffner has pointed out – in his view, to have convincingly portrayed certain psychological conditions in literary works did not necessarily make an author a ‘psychopath’.41 In the case of Sacher-Masoch, Krafft-Ebing never made any explicit reference to the author’s pathology. To base a key sexological category on a writer who had not made his desires public in a confessional, auto- biographical text would have been counterproductive to the success of Krafft-Ebing’s project, undermining his professional credibility and possibly resulting in a defamation court case. Krafft-Ebing was nonethe- less persuaded to name masochism after ‘the first portrayer of masochism’, because his patients were able to recognise themselves in Sacher-Masoch’s literary cases. Therefore the act of naming expressed appreciation for the creator of a literary work who encouraged Krafft-Ebing’s patients to reflect on their own condition. Should Krafft-Ebing have entertained any methodological doubts about the influence of literary cases on his patients, these were dispelled by the number of individuals referring to Venus im Pelz. Krafft-Ebing had identified an irregular phenomenon and was aiming to define its laws. A case of ‘self-intensification’: early masochists Reading Krafft-Ebing’s masochist case studies, it becomes obvious that writing about sex was no easy matter. The ways in which the sexologist presents his patients, their statements and his consideration of their predicament is defined by two central elements: the interpretation of Venus im Pelz as an erotic text, and the moment of recognition maso- chist readers experienced during their perusal of Sacher-Masoch’s work. Arousal and acknowledgement were likewise central to Krafft-Ebing’s understanding of pathology. The former represented the symptom; the latter was the prerequisite for the treatment that some of Krafft-Ebing’s patients so earnestly sought.42 It is impossible to say what other issues his patients might have raised in their conversations with him, but clearly their knowledge of arousal and acknowledgement had been shaped by the literary text that many of them referred to as the foremost representation of their unruly desires. Venus im Pelz tells the story of the antihero Severin, who does not manage to establish an emancipated relationship with his partner. The confession of his submissive desires to his lover Wanda von Dunajew, and several explicit and brutal scenes that depict Severin’s emotional and physical humiliation, are features of the novella. Although critical in many respects, Sacher-Masoch’s relatively sympathetic and intimate portrayal of Severin, as well as the story’s confessional tone, encouraged Krafft-Ebing’s masochist patients to interpret Venus im Pelz as an expression of their own sexual identity.

In the second edition of Neuere Forschungen (1891), Case 4 reports that, on reading Venus im Pelz, his ‘semen just comes out’.43 The subject of Case 4 was the only patient to admit so explicitly to physical arousal through his reading experience; by far the most common interpretation mentioned in the case studies was that of promoting self-awareness. Acknowledgement rather than arousal domin- ates descriptions of the effects of reading, a fact that might well have been imposed by Krafft-Ebing’s careful editing. Hence Case 3 states: A most remarkable, even amazing fact is that there is an author who exposes such passions to the public at large, namely in the forms of novellas and novels, rather than others, who keep their passions to themselves in their innermost soul. In Venus im Pelz we find the same familiar feelings expressed, word for word, line for line, feelings which until now we believed were our own most unique experiences.44 In absence of other forms of acknowledgement, this first recognition of desire in a twenty-year-old literary text must have been powerful. In her long essay on the uses of literature, Rita Felski points to the power of texts through ‘self-intensification’: ‘recognising aspects of ourselves in the description of others, seeing our perceptions and behaviours echoed in a work of fiction, we become aware of our accumulated experiences as distinctive yet far from unique’.45 Such close identification, often sidelined in literary criticism, is not necessarily overpowering, nor must it produce an utterly uncritical reader.46 Indeed, several of Krafft-Ebing’s case nar- ratives show subjects distancing themselves from what they perceived as the overtly pronounced, even shocking depiction of brutality in Venus im Pelz, a depiction which certainly surpassed their own desires. This was seen above in the response of Mr X, and is again evident in Case 3, where the patient remarks on the consequences of the unexpected transposition of fantasies from the private to the public sphere. Hence, maybe exactly because such secrets are dragged into the limelight, reading this book has repulsive, and hence sobering and healing effects also upon masochists. It is something different to imagine things with closed eyes in solitude and to read those same things printed in a novel. The reader can never completely suppress the critic, and hence it must seem outrageous to present such nonsense to an audience of which only a minimal part consists of masochists. It is sufficient to point to the fact that all characters involved continuously wear fur while in hot Florence, even when they are inside.47 For Krafft-Ebing such a critical stance towards Sacher-Masoch’s text might have intimated a new consciousness on the part of the patient, a potential distancing that could lead to recovery, since the patient’s acknowledgement of his own condition was central to the exchange between doctor and patient.48 For many of Krafft-Ebing’s masochist tHE SHIFtInG cASE oF MASocHISM: SAcHEr-MASocH’S VENUS IM PELZ Birgit Lang, Joy Damousi and Alison Lewis - 9781526106117 Downloaded from manchesterhive.com at 05/25/2020 03:20:14PM via free access\n\n35. ∙ 28 ∙ A HISTORY OF THE CASE STUDY patients, it can be said that Venus im Pelz served, rather, as a ‘coming out’ novel, powerfully portraying a new sort of sexual sensibility, or one previously unmapped in medical terms. All evidence indicates that this was not the author’s main intention. Within the cycle of novellas of which it was part, Venus im Pelz was supposed to be the author’s key representation of the struggling dilettante of love who subjects himself to the forceful powers of nature – personified by his sexually domineering female lover. Sacher-Masoch envisaged the portrayal of an emerging modern subjectivity, a symptom of the crisis of modernity: a sensitive man gifted with the capacity for aesthetic pleasure, but lacking the powers to constructively convert his gifts into living an ethical and productive life. Venus im Pelz was not the first literary text to embrace the sexual preference or the sensibility of masochists. Earlier erotic novels had likewise engaged with the sexual practices represented by Sacher-Masoch. Rousseau’s Confessions had painstakingly and painfully described the burden of the author’s sexual preferences in his own life, while Ivan Turgenev, in Dnevnik Lishnego Cheloveka (Diary of a Superfluous Man, 1850), gave an influential description of the mindset of an outsider whose explorations in the realms of love remain stunted and unsatisfactory. When compared with erotic texts portraying similar deeds, Venus im Pelz was a more respectable text, written by a prized author in a key fictional form favoured by the German middle class, the novella. Having constituted the exemplary ‘case’ in German literature since the late eighteenth century, novellas were a popular genre, published in most middle-class journals. Their focus on one character, and their frequently expressed aspiration of unpredictability, novelty and truth, made them the key genre for the description of peculiar and remarkable people or events.49 Different from Rousseau’s Confessions, or from Turgenev’s hero, who dies at the end of his story, Venus im Pelz characterises Severin as a somewhat deluded man who, through the ‘inversion’ of his desires, eventu- ally finds a more commonly accepted place in society, as a misogynist. The main difference between Venus im Pelz and its literary predecessors lies in the relatively positive characterisation of Severin, and in its confessional power – that is, in the detail and richness of its description, which fostered the sense of acknowledgement emphasised by Krafft-Ebing’s patients. A comparison between Turgenev’s Dnevnik Lishnego Cheloveka and Venus im Pelz highlights the positive thrust of Sacher-Masoch’s work, and is of particular relevance since Sacher-Masoch makes several allusions to Turgenev’snovella.ThelatterrevealsthetormentsoftheheroChulkaturin, a social outsider.
