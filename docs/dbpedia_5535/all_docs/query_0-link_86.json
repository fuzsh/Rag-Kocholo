It will ensure that students in European Languages have the opportunity to acquire some understanding of the broader European picture into which their chosen language(s) fit(s). It will provide a non-language-specific general preparation for subsequent study of society, politics, language and culture of all the languages taught in the Department. It will be open to students outside the Department and presupposes no linguistic competence.\n\nThe module is deliberately 'thin' in order to allow students, over the duration of the module, to assimilate the ideas concerned and to deepen their understanding of the underlying general themes.\n\nReading List\n\nGeneral Text\n\nHooper, J (1995) The New Spaniards (or later edition) Penguin Primo search Kurlansky, M The Basque History of the World Jonathan Cape Primo search Le Roy Ladurie, E (2001) Histoire de France des regions: la peripherie fran√ßaise des origines a nos jours Seuil Primo search Ross, Christopher J (2000) Spain 1812-1996 Arnold Primo search Sahlins, Peter (1989) Boundaries: the making of France and Spain in the Pyrenees University of California Press Primo search Tosi, Arturo (2001) Language and society in a changing Italy Multilingual Matters Primo search Wesseling, H L (2002) Certain Ideas of France: Essays on French History and Civilization Greenwood Press Primo search Recommended Text\n\nCavalli-Sforza, Luigi Luca (2001) Genes, peoples and languages Penguin, London Primo search Hobsbawm, E J (1992) Nations and nationalism since 1780.
