Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998.\n\nReview: F. J. Baumgartner in Choice 36.7 (1999), 1330: \"A.'s erudite study of artisan self-expression takes its title from the myth of Icarus — symbol of audacity and pride... [in that it suggests] how autobiographical writing allowed its practitioners to soar above their place in society. A.'s definitions of autobiographical writing and artisan are broad: autobiography includes diaries, journals, travel narratives, memoirs, and true autobiographies, while his writers range in social status from shepherdesses to wealthy merchants and in time from the early 1500s to the early 1800s. He shows the enormous range of topics that can be illuminated by studying artisan autobiography: lower-class education and literacy rates, familial ties, godparenthood, friendships, neighborhoods, business dealings, civic and political views, and private religious beliefs and practics. He traces what remained consistent and what changed in artisans' self-images and self-expression over three centuries.\"\n\nARTIGAS-MENANT, GENEVIÈVE and ANTONY MCKENNA, eds.

This journal is also available via internet: http://lancelot.univ-paris12.fr/arb-publi-htm.\n\nReview: Friedhelm Beckmann in ZFSL 109 (1999), 200–202: Useful summary of research activities resulting from the organization of this on-going colloquium/bulletin/committee and of the contents of this volume containing the review of research (by A. McKenna and G. Artigas-Menant) and among 17th-century studies one by 0. Block exploring the intertextuality of Cyrano and Molière.\n\nReview: J.-P. Cavaillé in Revue philosophique (1998), 223–5: This volume includes the Acts of a \"journée d'études\" held at l'Université Paris XII on 12 April, 1996 on the \"tendances actuelles dans la recherche sur les clandestins à l'âge classique.\" C. devotes a paragraph to describing the highly-commended paper given by O.

Raillard in QL 751 (1998), 18: Les photographies dans ce livre sont \"reproduites avec le souci du meilleur point de vue, celui où apparaîtrait le souci de 'vie' qui fut celui du Bernin. Il recourait volontiers à la 'vue unique'.... Ses croquis, ses études reproduites ici montrent comment il recherchait en imagination ....

The authors note that \"[l]es monarques d'Ancien Régime, et les artistocrates à leur suite, aimaient à exhiber ces espèces insolites.

The Noblest Triumph: Property and Prosperity Through the Ages. New York: St. Martin's, 1998.\n\nReview: E. L. Whalen in Choice 36.6 (1999), 1103: \"The disciplines of law and economics come together in this volume in a novel way. The author ... seeks to demonstrate that secure private property rights must be in place for economic growth to occur. To support this view, he invokes both legal and economic analysis and historical examples.\"\n\nBINNEY, MARCUS. Town Houses: Urban Houses from 1200 to the Present Day. New York: Whitney Library of Design, 1998.\n\nReview: H. W. Marshall in Choice 36.7 (1999), 1252: \"[P]resents the saga of the urban dwelling.... Chapters trace the evolution of European urban housing from the Middle Ages to the present, and the emphasis ranges across the need for preservation of significant historic structures, the varieties of town houses on European and American cities, and on new urban forms being built today....

Especially noteworthy are handsome cut-away drawings showing construction and details in perspective.\"\n\nBLACK, JEREMY. War and the World: Military Power and the Fate of Continents, 1450–2000. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998.\n\nReview: G. B. Osborne in Choice 36.2 (1998), 386: \"B. describes how European states, forged out of incessant warfare, were more successful at 'competitive military emulation' than their non-European counterparts. Taking a 'Gibbonian' approach, B. argues that military success was not always the result of superior technology. He convincingly demonstrates that it was not the technological advances themselves that led to the rise of the West, but rather the unique 'political, social and economic contexts' that gave European states the prevailing technique for putting these advances to more effective use. This was especially the case with naval power and maritime exploration, which allowed Europeans to extend their global hegemony.\"\n\nReview: n.a. in VQR 75.1 (1999), 7: B. \"successfully argues for war to be discussed within the context of world history. Europeans were not the sole dynamic powers in the world, he argues, nor were differences in military technology the sole reason for European successes.\" Other reasons posited include \"contingency, the political context of wars, psychological factors, and disease — even at times pointing out the benefits of defeat to the vainquished.\"\n\nBORZELLO, FRANCES. Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self-Portraits. New York: Abrams, 1998.\n\nReview: M. M. Doherty in Choice 36.3 (1998), 507–508: \"Beginning with 14th-century manuscripts, B.... traces the development of this small but phenomenal genre.... Through painting, photography, and sculpture, Borzello reveals artists who, like Rembrandt, depicted themselves through bloom, maturity, and decline.... A chronologically arranged social history, the book introduces artists and notes their contributions to the genre. A major theme is the visual messages artists sent about themselves not just as women, but as fledgling members of the artistic profession. Portraits of women as artists (painted by male colleagues) contrast with the self-portrait.\"\n\nBOTS, HANS and FRANÇOISE WAQUET. La république des Lettres. Paris: Belin-De Boeck, 1997.\n\nReview: Jacques Solé in RHEF 84 (1998), 397: \"Livre complet et brillant, fort bien informé\" charts the geography and the concerns as well as providing profiles of the main inhabitants of learned Europe, 1550–1750.\n\nBOYER, JEAN-CLAUDE, ed. Pierre Mignard 'le Romain.' Actes du colloque. Paris: La documentation Française, 1997.\n\nReview: H. Keazor in Burlington Magazine 140 (1998), 759–60: These Actes du colloque also include an interesting series of documents that Boyer assembled in preparation for the event. Yet K. notes, \"despite these added extras, the book faithfully reflects the reluctance, clearly discernible during the colloque, to confront the aesthetic qualities of Mignard's work.\"\n\nBREJON DE LAVERGNÉE, ARNAULD. \"Who was Pierre Lemaire?\" Burlington Magazine 140 (1998), 739–46.\n\nA biographical sketch of Pierre Lemaire, based on contemporary documents, and an analysis of the corpus of works attributed to him, in the context of what is known about his life.\n\nBROKLISS, L.W.B. and J.H. ELLIOTT, eds. The World of the Favorite. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999.\n\nReview: Jonathan Powis in TLS 5038 (22 Oct. 1999), 8–10: Papers from Oxford conference, most of which focus on the late 16th and early l7th-centuries with heavy coverage for England, France, Spain. Jean Berenger's seminal article (1974) exploding the stereotypes given to favorites, increasingly during this period in the mixed press of literature, is followed out here and the reviewer establishes his own typology without specifically identifying any of the essays or authors on l7th-century France included in the volume othe than \"subtle essays\" by Linda Levy Peck and Orest Ranum.\n\nBROWN, KENNETH and MARIANO GOMEZ ARANDA. \"A New Collection of Seventeenth-Century Spanish and Portuguese Poetry from Italy and its Sephardic Connection.\" RPh 52 (Fall 1998), 45–70.\n\n19 complete poems that provide \"anecdotal insights into the casual reading and listening pleasures of some displaced Sephardim\" and an \"important addition to the scant Spanish language documentation of the Seventeenth-Century Sephardim\" of Italy.\n\nBRUTER, ANNIE. L'Histoire enseignée au Grand Siècle. Naissance d'une pédagogie. Paris: Belin, 1997.\n\nReview: Philippe Bousquet in DSS 203 (1999), 392–394: \"Cet ouvrage étudie la façon dont l'histoire s'est constituée en matière d'enseignement.\" Chapters examine methodological and definitional diffulties in discerning pedagogical norms; the workings and pedagogy of an Ancien Régime school; and transformations in methods of teaching history over the course of the century. Reviewer praises the clarity and rigor of the study.\n\nBULL, MALCOLM. \"Notes on Poussin's Egypt.\" Burlington Magazine 141 (1999), 537–40.\n\nA study of Egyptian motifs in Poussin's paintings of Moses, and the possible sources from which Poussin may have drawn his inspiration.\n\nBULL, MALCOLM. \"Poussin and Nonnos.\" Burlington Magazine 140 (1998), 724–38.\n\nB. discusses the influences of the surviving texts of Nonnos—particularly the Dionysiaca, a 48-book epic in Greek hexameters about the life of Dionysius—on the works of Poussin.\n\nBURKE, PETER. The European Renaissance: Centres and Peripheries. Oxford: Blackwell, 1998.\n\nReview: J. Harrie in Choice 36.8 (1999), 1524: \"B. examines the place of the European Renaissance, by which he means the 'revival, reception, and transformation of the classical tradition' between 1330 and 1630, in world history.... He argues that it was during [the period after 1530] that those on Europe's peripheries made their most important contributions to the international movement and that the Renaissance became 'domesticated,' transforming the European elites' central values and attitudes. Informed by the language and methods of anthropology, B. focuses on the contexts in which humanist ideas were received, the channels through which reception took place, and the range of local responses to the movement.\"\n\nBURKHOLDER, MARK A., ed. Administrators of Empire. Aldershot/Brookfield, VT: Ashgate/Variorum, 1998.\n\nReview: D. R. Skopp in Choice 36.10 (1999), 1842: \"Gathered here are 16 previously published scholarly articles and essays on European expansion during the early modern era.... Only European-born nobility and experienced soldiers—literacy and military service apparently were the two formal requirements—were eligible for appointment as colonial governors, lieutenants, and placement.\"\n\nBURY, EMMANUEL. \"Actualité des moralistes classiques: A propos de quelques publications récentes.\" IL 51.2 (1999), 48–51.\n\nBury starts with the following question: \"Quelle place réserver aujourd'hui, dans le cadre de l'enseignement de la littérature, à la production des moralistes classiques?\" At the same time, he wonders whether or not society should fear the return of the word \"morale.\" Bury suggests that texts dealing with the \"science de l'homme\" could in fact \"renouer avec la 'réflexion citoyenne' qui est constamment souhaitée par les différents editorialistes des medias les plus en vogue.\" Citing a number of scholars including Louis Van Delft and Patrick Dandrey, Bury claims that \"la morale est plus que jamais à l'ordre du jour.\" This notion is underscored in Lafond's 1992 anthology, where one observes in the contributions of various seventeenth-century humanists, \"le retour...du souci de morale...[ce qui est] donc le signe qu'une étude 'littéraire' de ces textes est possible, voire souhaitable aujourd'hui.\" B. also highlights the emphasis on La Rochefoucauld in the examination for the agrégation, as well as renewed interest in La Bruyère, as proof of the increased relevance and \"insertion de cette littérature dans la culture de l'homme moderne.\"\n\nCABLE, JAMES. The Political Influence of Naval Force in History. New York: St. Martin's, 1998.\n\nReview: R. Higham in Choice 36.6 (1999), 1110: \"C. ... has now provided a broad introductory survey of the relationship of diplomacy to naval power.... C. starts with the Falklands in 1982 as a clarifying introduction and then works forward from the 16th century to the modern world, in each case linking diplomacy and naval force, not only in peace, but also in war. The result is a panoramic survey of world history as related to the use of naval force.\"\n\nCHALINE, OLIVIER. \"De la gloire.\" Littératues Classiques 36 (1999), 95–108.\n\n\"La gloire\" defined, denounced (by those who defend a religious view of \"gloire\" linked to humility), in crisis (under Richelieu's tenure, during the years of the French struggle against the Habsbourg), and finally \"quasi monopole royal\" under Louis XIV.\n\nCHAMBERS, FRANCES, comp. Paris. Oxford/Santa Barbara: Clio, 1998.\n\nReview: H. E. Whitmore in Choice 36.3 (1998), 500: This bibliography is a \"list of 430 items, mostly in English. A majority of the works cited are monographs; journal articles are also included. Most titles are relatively recent, although earlier publications are well represented.... The chapters on history and literature are the most extensive...\".\n\nCHARD, CHLOE and HELEN LANGDON, eds. Travel, Pleasure and Imaginative Geography, 1600–1830. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996.\n\nReview: Ann Berringham in ECS 32 (1999), 406–407: Stimulating collection of original and incisive essays on the discursive and representational practice of the writing of the grand tour, accommodating the culturally unfamiliar.

Her gifts for dance and theatre cast a spell on the aging sovereign. C. studies her personal role as an actress, dancer and regular spectator in Versailles, Saint-Cyr, Marly, Fontainebleau and Paris, and the relationships which she had with the main artists of the stage.\n\nCLARK, HENRY C. \"Commerce, the Virtues and the Public Sphere in Early Seventeenth-Century France.\" FHS 21 (1998), 415–40.\n\nA close study of the use of traditional moral language in attempting to shape, articulate or understand royal policies of commerce. The article focuses particularly on Antoine de Montchrestien's pioneering Traicté de l'économie politique (1615) and reveals a new appreciation of how the state becomes the main arbiter of a system of social values and of how other elements of society (the nobility, mercantile interests) need increasingly to define their own worth and status by reference to terms appropriated by the monarchy.\n\nCLARKE, JAN. \"Illuminating the Guénégaud Stage: Some Seventeenth-Century Lighting Effects.\" FS 53.1 (1999), 1–15.\n\nAuthor examines the lighting environment for performances at the Guénégaud; traces a significant evolution in the use of lighting in the machine plays; and studies the way in which this reflects the evolution of the genre.\n\nCLEARY, RICHARD L.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999.\n\nReview: Jeremy Melvin in TLS 5010 (9 Apr. 1999), 37: Valuable addition to architectural history, with an unusual guide to 23 French cities with such urban places.

Selon C., nous sommes assez désarmés \"s'il s'agit de préciser les contours d'un continent littéraire qui déborde les frontières chronologiques et formelles, celui du libertinage érudit, critique, d'inspiration philosophiques ou religieuse, satirique ou grotesque, tel qu'il remonte aux premières années du XVIIe siècle.\"\n\nCLOULAS, IVAN and MICHELE BIMBENET-PRIVAT. Treasures of the French Renaissance. Trans.John Goodman. New York: Abrams, 1997.\n\nReview: P. Emison in Choice 36.2 (1998), 302–303: \"The decorative arts and architecture are beautifully photographed, in support of the thesis that what the French most valued in Renaissance culture was a luxurious manner of living, leading ultimately to the excesses of Louis XIV.\"\n\nCOHEN, RICHARD I. Jewish Icons: Art and Society in Modern Europe. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.\n\nReview: J. Gutmann in Choice 36.2 (1998), 303: \"C. attempts to place Jewish participation in the arts within a historical perspective.... He devotes a chapter to Jewish art patronage in 17th- and 18th-century Europe.\"\n\nCONSIBEE, PHILIP. \"Atticism in French Art.\" Burlington Magazine 141 (1999), 55–6.\n\nAn exhibition review of \"Eloge de la clarté: un courant artistique au temps de Mazarin, 1640–1660\" at the Musée de Tessé in Le Mans. C. indicates the exhibition \"examines that rarefied current of classicism in mid-17th century French, or rather Parisian, art known as 'atticism',\" and regrets only that the modest scale of the museum in question limited the scale of the exhibition. He also notes the surprising absence of any works by Claude, whose reputation in France was at its height during the period in question.\n\nCORNETTE, JOEL. Chronique du régne de Louis XIV.

Histoire de la chanson française. 2 vols. Paris: Seuil, 1998.\n\nReview: Thierry Gandillot in L'Express 2470 (5–11 nov. 1998), 74–75: \"Le show-biz est né au Pont-Neuf,\" contends the author, and shows it in sections on performers—Bruscambilles, Jean Farine, Desidério, Descombes, Baron Grattelard, Hiéronvous, Phillipot, Le Savoyard—their songs and their ethos. \"Pas seulement un livre qui enchante, c'est aussi un livre qui se chante.\"\n\nEKBERG, CARL J. French Roots in the Illinois Country: The Mississippi Frontier in Colonial Times. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1998.\n\nReview: L. T. Cummins in Choice 36.3 (1998), 582: \"In this well-researched and meticulously written study E. examines patterns of land holding, agricultural practices, and settlement in the Illinois country from the late 1600s until after the area became part of the US in the early 19th century. The geographical area included the French Colonial settlements of Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Vincennes, Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and Prairie du Chien. The author discusses a unique system of long lot and common field agriculture that developed in this region, motivated both by the French cultural heritage and the specific needs of living in the upper Mississippi valley during the Colonial era. Settlement patterns in these communities revolved around a tripartite configuration of the nuclear village, open fields where a distinctive style of cereal agriculture predominated, and common lands for the grazing of animals. Such practices were not seen elsewhere in Colonial North America. The study also examines the cultural differences between the French mentalité and the assumptions held by citizens of the US that brought an end to this system in the decades after the Louisiana Purchase. This work breaks new ground and is a welcome addition to the literature.\"\n\nERNST, GERMANA, ed. Campanella, Tommaso. Monarchie d'Espagne. Monarchie de France. Trans.Serge Walbaum andNathalie Fabry.

Jean Lemaire pittore 'antiquario.' Rome: Ugo Bozzi, 1996.\n\nReview: J.-C. Boyer in Burlington Magazine 140 (1998), 756–9: B. praises the large number of canvases catalogued by Fagioli dell'Arco, but cautions that the author may well have underestimated the problem posed by the confusion between Jean Lemaire and Pierre Lemaire, his contemporary.\n\nFERRETTI, GIULIANO, ed. Philippe Fortin de la Houguette. Lettres aux frères Dupuy et à leur entourage (1623–1662). Florence: S. Olschki, 1997.\n\nReview: C. Rizza in SFr 42 (1998), 566: An edition of more than 500 previously unpublished letters by Philippe Fortin de la Houguette, the author of a Catéchisme royal, a work that ought to have ensured him the position of Louis XIV's tutor. Of particular interest are the letters detailing the relations between the Dupuy family and Richelieu, l'affaire Cinq-Mars and the arrest and condemnation of de Thou. R. praises the rigorous introduction (which offers an interpretation of the political doctrines being elaborated during the crucial rise of absolutism), the exhaustive notes and the useful biographical index and critical bibliography. \"An exemplary work both for its completeness and its methodological rigor an inexhaustible source of information concerning political and cultural life during the first half of the 17th century.\" With a preface by M.

Rizza in SFr 42 (1998), 566: A detailed examination of a series of texts (many of which were previously unpublished) from the time of Richelieu's death and that express opposing views of the cardinal as a tyrant and as the great statesman to whom France owed its unity and prestige. Feretti claims that during this period of French history, the image of Richelieu was a battleground on which two visions of the monarchy contended with each other for supremacy, up until the end of the Fronde.\n\nFINKELMAN, PAUL, and JOSEPH C.

The arcticle focuses on two hundred cases brought before an urban court of first instance in Nantes between 1598 and 1710, which indicate that at this level women were twice as likely to petition for separate property alone as they were to petition for separations of persons and property, and that petitions for separate property alone increased over time.\n\nHARDWICK, JULIE.

Her subject is public notaries in Nantes, a town of 25,000, who struggled to maintain their economic and social position in the difficult years 1560–1660. Based on archival records ..., as well as an impressive array of secondary sources extending well beyond France, the author sets out to determine how the concept of gender shaped the nature of authority in family life and its implication for political culture, which saw the king posited as father of his people. The result is a highly sophisticated picture, seeking to explain rather than to judge patriarchal relationships. The author deftly depicts the role of bilateral kinship, customary law, equitable inheritance, expectations of good management, property ownership, and human relationships in both limiting as well as reinforcing the power of husbands and fathers over their families, while at the same time creating possibilities and challenges for women within the household structure, as spouses worked together for common goals.

Nevertheless, the goal of bridging the gap between art and science is seldom reached, since most essays remain fixed in either the art or science mode, with at most a nod to the other. Thus, Svetlana Alpers's study of the artist's studio in the 17th century makes some suggestive comments on the scientist's laboratory as an analog, but the essay is mostly about the studio.

To someone in North America, where a sizeable share of Francophones are of African descent, it has an entirely different meaning, the Caribbean face of the failed French colonial enterprise across the Atlantic.

From the Royal to the Republican Body. Incorporating the Political in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century France. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.\n\nReview: n.a. in VQR 75.1 (1999), 8: Book discusses \"...the politics of the body. This well-researched and well-written collection of essays is ... a welcome addition to this already substantial literature. In a chronologically ordered series of studies, major scholars from a number of different disciplines make a convincing case for the centrality of bodily practices, as well as metaphors, in the transition from royal absolutism to republicanism in France. One of the real strengths of this collection is its attention to the relatively neglected question of the role of dance in 17th- and 18th-century political culture (essays by Mark Franko, Susan Leign, and Susan McClary), as well as to such obvious corporeal topics as sexuality, punishment, medicine, and clothing. The essays are also consistently attentive to issues of gender and race. All in all, this volume persuades the reader of the importance of the body to the study of political culture.\"\n\nReview: J. Black in JES 28 (1998), 414–415: \"This exciting account of cultural identities and politics begins with a bold statement of the centrality of the subject: 'Few states were as body centered as seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France. The rhetoric, rites, and rhythm of political life derived from bodies. Political discourse abounded in body metaphors.' Debate about these and other bodies provides an interesting way to explore beliefs and tensions in ancien régime France and to understand rising problems with the image of the Bourbon monarchy. The essays are methodologically acute and provoke much thought. At times the fascination with image is pushed too far, but the collection provides an insightful exploration of the culture of the period. Jeffrey Merrik indicates how the image of the royal body could be employed to criticize the monarchy—a theme of many of the essays; Abby Zanger considers images of Louis XIV at the close of the Mazarin period, explaining why there was a need to stress his potency; Mark Franko has a rather humourless discussion of Louis XIV's cross-dressing roles, with opaque passages ... Susan McClary considers the very different agendas of French and German composers of dance pieces, with a focus on the body. Joseph Roach discusses the Code Noir and links this to control over black bodies. Thomas Kaiser looks at criticism of Louis XV.... A stimulating collection.\"\n\nMILLER, PAVIA. Transformations of Patriarchy in the West, 1500–1800. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1998.\n\nReview: S. Bailey in Choice 36.10 (1999), 1859: \"In this major contribution to European social history M. has succeeded in doing to history what Richard Wagner did to music—weaving together powerful motifs with dramatic results. She traces such major themes as the rise of fraternalism, the emergence of bureaucracy, the growth of capitalism, and the evolution of modern schooling. All can be said to have triumphed at the cost of patriarchal domination. What shifts have taken place in the West in the mechanisms of social control? She finds that external coercion has given way to internal restraint, and that what appears to be a regimentation is triumph of gyroscopic engineering. This is a fascinating and impressive argument, one that owes much to historical materialism but goes beyond it. Impressive, too, is the way that M. shows that domination, while becoming internalized, remains strongly gendered.\"\n\nMINOIS, GEORGE. History of Suicide: Voluntary Death in Western Culture.

One continuity, however, ... is the inverse relationship between state power and the political opposition to suicide.\"\n\nReview: J. A. Kegley in Choice 36.11/12 (1999), 2022: \"Based on a variety of sources from religious and philosophical texts to judicial proceedings and personal journals, M.'s illumnating study shows that Western culture's attitude toward voluntary death has been contradictory and highly ambivalent.... M. discusses how the debate on suicide began with Shakespeare's Hamlet, in a time of doubt and conflicting values. It continued until the 19th century.... M. describes suicide historically as a class phenomenon: suicides among the elite were fewer in number but tolerated by society, which saw them as done for nobler reasons...; among the common people suicide resulted from excessive physical, moral, and emotional suffering and remained stable but subject to 'judicial savagery'.\"\n\nMOINET, ERIC, JEAN-PIERRE CUZIN, ELISABETH MARTIN and CLAIRE BARRY.

Le génie de Louis XIV est d'en avoir fait un instrument de pouvoir politique, en le fixant dans l'étiquette de la cour. En 1664, sous la plume de Nicolas Faret, la culture de l'honnête homme, faite de maîtrise de l'agressivité et de féminisation des valeurs masculines, est devenue un 'art de plaire à la cour.'

Paris: Honoré Champion, 1996.\n\nReview: Christian Jouhaud in DSS 202 (1999), 203–204: The first modern edition of Pasquier's work, this book reproduces the 1665 edition and includes an introduction, glossary, index and bibliography. The annotation is relevant \"sans jamais glisser vers le commentaire bavard.\" Reviewer emphasizes \"l'importance et la superbe qualité de cette édition qui permet enfin de lire et de comprendre Pasquier.\"\n\nPEI, IEOH MING. \"Les métamorphoses du Louvre.\" RDM (septembre 1999), 90–92.\n\n\"Ce texte est extrait d'une conférence prononcée le 10 avril 1999, à l'auditorium du Louvre, dans la série 'Musée-musées'.\"\n\nPEKACZ, JOLANTA T. \"The Salonnières and the Philosophes in Old Regime France. The Authority of Aesthetic Judgement.\" JHI 60.2 (1999), 277–297.\n\nBy examining two operatic quarrels of the 18th-c., the author demonstrates how women came to be excluded from aesthetic arbitration and did not maintain \"their roles as guardians of propriety and good manners for the philosophes.\"\n\nPELLEGRINI, ROSA GALLI. \"Turcs et turquesques nell'Ibrahim di Georges de Scudéry.\" Lo Straniero. Mario Domenichelli and Pino Fasano, eds. 2 vols. Rome: Bulzoni, 1997. 2: 555–67.\n\nReview: C. Bernazzoli in SFr 42 (1998), 566–7: After emphasizing the literary value and the typically baroque thematics of Ibrahim, Pellegrini spends some time describing the political project which contributed to the genesis of Scudéry's first novel: due to the official participation of France in the Thirty Years' War, in the context of which good relations with the Ottoman Empire were indispensable, Richelieu put some effort into reestablishing ties with the oriental world during the first decades of the 17th century. Scudéry took it upon himself to stimulate the interest of his readers towards the east by conveying a positive image of the Turk, and of Suleiman II as the ideal monarch. P. then examines the narrative devices used by Scudéry to carry out his plan.\n\nPELLETIER, MONIQUE, et al. Couleurs de la Terre. Paris: Seuil/Bibliothèque de France, 1998.\n\nReview: G.

Les femmes ou les silences de l'Histoire. Paris: Flammarion, 1998.\n\nReview: C. Dauphin in QL 751 (1998), 20: \"Le parcours prend ici la forme d'un recueil d'articles, présenté comme autant de jalons dans un des courants les plus foissonnants de l'historiographie récente.... Les 'silences' imposés aux femmes se conjugent au propre comme au figuré, dans leur présence au monde et dans la culture écrite, dans l'opacité des traces comme dans l'opération historiographique curieusement frappée de cécité à leur égard.... La chronologie aurait pu servir de fil directeur, elle s'impose en filigrane.\" Ce livre \"offre une autre lecture de l'histoire des femmes. L'agencement de ces éclats de recherche, dans une perspective nouvelle, thématique et chronologique, montre que le théâtre des 'ombres silencieuses' reste le lieu bouillonnant de rêves et d'espoirs, l'amorce d'une appropriation de la mémoire.... [L]'histoire des femmes ainsi restituée sert de fil d'Ariane pour revisiter les problèmes posés en tout temps: travail, pouvoir, souffrance, violence, séduction.\"\n\nPIERRARD, JEAN. \"La peinture des bords de l'eau.\" Review of an exhibition entitled \"La marine à voile de 1650 à 1890\" at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen.

Théories du portrait. De la Renaissance aux Lumières. Paris: Gallimard, 1998.\n\nReview: Karl Cogard in DSS 203 (1999), 406–408: The first part of this book studies Italian theories of the portrait; the second focuses on the paradoxical status of the portrait during le grand siècle. Considered a genre mineur under Louis XIV, the portrait was nonetheless a propaganda tool and very much in vogue as a literary and plastic art form. Reviewer writes \"[L]oin de n'être qu'un chapitre de l'histoire de l'art, l'auteur montre l'importance du portrait, que n'ont d'ailleurs jamais démentie les plus grands peintres, en le plaçant dans un cadre philosophique, socio-historique et anthropologique.\"\n\nPOWELL, KIRSTEN H. Fables in Frames: La Fontaine and Visual Culture in Nineteenth-Century France.

She concentrates particularly on illustrators and caricaturists who transformed the material inherited from La Fontaine into commentaries, usually subversive and sceptical, upon contemporary social and political questions. . . . The strength of Powell's book lies in that minute attention to graphic detail which characterizes the art historian.\"\n\nPRAKASH, OM. European Commercial Enterprise in Pre-Colonial India.

A Case of Witchcraft: The Trial of Urbain Grandier. Montreal/Buffalo: McGill/Queen's, 1998.\n\nReview: R. B. Barnes in Choice 36.8 (1999), 1525: \"The sensational story of Urbain Grandier (d.1634), priest of Loudun in western France, and his trial and execution for sorcery has been told and retold many times .... R., an independent scholar, has studied virtually all the relevant sources, both primary and secondary, as well as a considerable background literature on early modern witchcraft, politics, social tensions, and gender relations.... R.'s reconstruction of the sexual, political, and legal entanglements that led to Grandier's buring at the stake is generally persuasive, if still quite speculative. He disputes some aspects of the tale as traditionally told, and offers a few genuinely original insights. Scholars of the period will find that he often oversimplifies complex background in order to tell a good story.\" Nonetheless, \"a very good read.\"\n\nRAYMOND, GINO. Historical Dictionary of France.

How actions, situations, and concepts have been treated through history and in different cultures constitutes the core of 120 alphabetical entires by 42 contributing scholars. Related topics, selected works of art, and a compact bibliography conclude each section....

La chasse sous l'Ancien Régime. Paris: Fayard, 1996.\n\nReview: Christian Desplat in RHMC 46 (1998), 373–75: On a subject that would seem already exhaustively treated, a brilliant rereading of historical sources resulting in an especially solid depiction of hunting's relation to society. Traces the chaotic detail of legal regulation, rules and conventions, the collaboration of booksellers-printers in Part I; Part II, \"d'une remarquable nouveauté\" examines the table of \"bons et mauvais gibiers,\" the humanization of nature, and the status of animals.\n\nSMITH, BONNIE. The Gender of History: Men, Women, and Historical Practice. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1998.\n\nReview: S. S. Arpad in Choice 36.7 (1999), 1317: \"S. begins by challenging historians' claims that the modern, scientific, professional methods of history allow them to practice a 'value-free' science. In a series of eight essays, she demonstrates the ways in which history is gendered, arguing tht 'the coupling of science and politics is the quintessential installation of sexual difference at the core of professional history'.\" Ranges across many Western countries.\n\nSMITH, PAMELA. \"Science and Taste: Painting, Passions, and the New Philosophy in Seventeenth-Century Leiden.\" Isis 90 (1999), 421–61.\n\nRemarkable essay paralleling the practice of the new science by Sylvius, professor of practical medicine (16581672) and pioneer in its institutionalization with his taste in art collecting and the display of it in his Leiden residence. Explores the subject of medical quackery in Brouwer, the personification of the senses in Jan Molenaer's series, the illusionism of Dou.

The 'time' element is given major priority, but the literature treating 'space' has not been adequately engaged....

Te Brake... skillfully links social and political developments to provide an account of social politics that suggests an ongoing process of popular pressure and interaction with state formation, rather than an episodic series of uprisings, whether revolutionary or reactive....

First \"focuses on the patriarchal conditions that historically rendered the voices of women silent.\" Second \"is a sample of rhetorical pratices\" over the centuries.

Includes observation that colonization marked a domain where \"l'Etat se mêle de ce qui avait été le domaine exclusif de l'Eglise.\" Among the topics mentioned in the essay are Colbert's displeasure with the Church at how slowly Amerindian peoples assimilated French culture. Of note also is author's emphasis on language as a colonization strategy. Originally, Champlain believed that teaching French to the native populations would suffice in terms of their Europeanization. When this technique failed, the Jesuits decided to \"captiver les 'coeurs&courages' amérindiens par leurs propres langues.\" Wilkin then discusses the various lexical, grammatical, written, and rhetorical barriers native languages presented to the French. For both Colbert and the Jesuits, this \"impuissance verbale\" contributed significantly to the failure of the Europeans to acculturate peoples of the New World.\n\nWINE, HUMPHREY. \"Claude Lorrain.\" Burlington Magazine 140 (1998), 858–9.\n\nAn exhibition review of \"Claude Lorrain and the ideal Landscape\" in the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo.

Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.\n\nReview: E. Goldsmith in SubStance 28.1 (1999), 133–135: Z. argues that Louis XIV's marraige \"set in motion the process of fiction-making that was to become so crucial to the spectacle of sovereign power under the sun king.\" Z. studies images of kinship, what she calls a \"marriage archive,\" including pamphlets, almanacs, news accounts, etc., and maintains that \"the more ephemeral commentaires on the marriage gave voice to a public fascination with the spectacle of power in the making, providing both harmonious and competing interpretations of the event and, above all, of its significance in the life of the young king.... Z. shows how the Infanta's initiation to the French court involved a symbolic conquest and refashioning of the Spanish by the French.\" The last two chapters discuss Corneille's Conquête de la Toison d'or and Madeleine de Scudéry's Célinte as \"literary conversations about the power of the young king at the founding moment of his reign.... Z. shows how Scudéry manages to rehabilitate and defend curiosity against a strong philosophical tradition condemning it. Thus Scudéry was already exploring the interactive nature of ceremonial display, and arguing for a view of political spectacle that takes fully into account the importance of different forms of response to it, from the authorized published interpretations to the casual conversations of salon women. Like Scudéry, Z. proposes an approach to the mythology of royal power that emphasizes the multiplicity of voices that responded to and contributed to its construction. More than this, though, her study documents and argues convincingly for an understanding of ceremonial moments that do not simply work to symbolically buttress the power of those that stage them. Such occasions have also always offered opportunities for individual onlookers to promote their own particular interests, which were not necessarily in harmony with those that the ceremonial occasion was designed to sustain.\"\n\nReview: Helen L.

Papàsogli in SFr 42 (1998), 571–2: P. praises this \"courageous\" study which is divided into three sections, each of which describes one of the principal forums of \"l'éloquence d'apparat\": the Academies (Parisian and provincial), the Parlements (Parisian and provincial), and the \"municipality\" in its more complex ramifications. \"A research of extraordinary breadth... which presents classical France as a theatre in which stock roles are played with subtle variants in an unchanging comedy.\" P. is generally favorable to the study (she does note that the topic is perhaps a bit too broadly defined, and excludes entire sectors of \"l'éloquence d'apparat\", such as the \"oraison funèbre\"), and commends Zoberman for maintaining a \"firm grip on the sprawling material.\"\n\nPART IV: LITERARY HISTORY AND CRITICISM\n\nAERCKE, KRISTIAAN. Gods of Play: Baroque Festive Performances as Rhetorical Discourse. Albany: SUNY, 1994.\n\nReview: G. Berghaus in ThR 23.2 (1998), 182–183: Comparative treatment. \"Analyses of five representative examples from four European countries are preceded by a long theoretical introduction which discusses the political and ritual functions, means of presentation, and rhetorical conventions of the 'splendid festival performances,' as A. likes to call the genre.\" Approach is \"laudable,\" yet the reviewer disagrees with many details he calls \"speculative. The main message is on deciphering the political messages behind the performances. Most of his readings are plausible, and certianly debatable, even when one disagrees with some of the details of his interpretation.\" No visual material/illustrations.\n\nALIVERTI, MARIA INES. \"An Unknown Portrait of Tiberio Fiorilli.\" ThR 23.2 (1998), 127–132.\n\nAn excerpt from M. A. Katritzky's introduction to this issue of ThR summarizes the article as follows: A. \"presents a painting which she has discovered. With reference to other pictures, she identifies its central character as a portrait of the actor Tiberio Fiorilli (1608–1694), who made his name at the Théâtre Italien in the role of 'Scaramouche.' A. explores the significance of his stage costume, and of his skill in portraying the passions, through his trademark expressions of laughing and weeping, and relates them to wider issues.\"\n\nANIS, PAUL. \"L'Eros dans la littérature populaire de la première moitié du XVIIe siècle: vers une codification du comportement amoureux.\" PFSCL 26 (1999), 39–50.\n\nAnalysis of a few examples of \"littérature de colportage\" (among which \"Canards\") in order to establish distinctions between \"le modèle amoureux et les conventions de l'éthique amoureuse populaires\" from those of the nobility, \"mieux connus et plus étudiés en raison de leur richesse documentaire.\"\n\nASSAF, FRANCIS. \"Le corps baroque dans les histoires comiques.\" Littératures Classiques 36 (1999), 79–94.\n\nThe \"baroque body\" (in Théophile's La première journée, Sorel's Francion, Le Gascon extravagant, Tristan's Le page disgracié, and Scarron's Le roman comique) which is perceived as defining a fragmented and contradictory \"baroque episteme\" while claiming a reality \"qu'il n'hésite pas à dénoncer alors même qu'il la conforte.\"\n\nASSAF, FRANÇOIS AND ANDREW H. WALLIS, eds. Car demeure l'amitié. Mélanges offerts àClaude Abraham. PFSCL/ Biblio 17, 102 (1997).\n\nReview: L. Benatti in SFr 42 (1998), 130–1: This review summarizes 18 essays included in this collection of critical analyses of different aspects of 17th-century literature and culture.\n\nASSAF, FRANCIS. La mort du roi. Une thanatographie de Louis XIV. PFSCL/Biblio 17, 112 (1999).\n\nStudy of the monarchic rituals and the absolutist theory put into motion on the occasion of the King's death, analyzing historical facts, concepts, and texts, and reflecting on the epistemological status of these texts and the construction of History they propose.\n\nAUCHTER, DOROTHY. Dictionary of Historical Allusions and Eponyms. Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio, 1998.\n\nReview: A. J. Dedrick in Choice 36.4 (1998), 657: \"A.'s compilation consists of more than 550 words and phrases. Its stated purpose is to provide more extensive coverage of the selected items 'than is available in reference literature.' Sources are cited for each entry, and a useful subject index is included.\"\n\nAUERBACH, ERICH. Le culte des passions. Essais sur le XVIIe siècle français. Paris: Macula, 1999.\n\nReview: J.-C. Esslin in Esprit (juin 1999), 223: \"Ces essais de l'auteur de Mimésis surprendront le lecteur par leur intelligence de la culture classique. La précision et la force des analyses sur Pascal et la raison d'Etat en France, Racine, la généalogie historico-religieuse du terme 'passion', et enfin sur 'le public', 'la cour et la ville', mènent au coeur des réalités françaises. On sera peut-être surpris de l'affirmation d'Auerbach selon laquelle le culte des passions, dans la seconde moitié du XVIIe siècle, chez un Racine par exemple, témoigne que la mondanité française est déjà étrangère à la culture chrétienne et que les passions y ont valeur autonome.\"\n\nBAKER, MONA with KIRSTEN MALMKJAER. Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies. London: Routledge, 1998.\n\nReview: W. E. Hannaford, Jr. in Choice 36.4 (1998), 666: \"The encyclopedia has two parts, the first covering the conceptual framework of the discipline, the second the history of translation in major linguistic and cultural communities. The entries, in alphabetical order, ranger over a wide variety of topics, practices, and countries.\"\n\nBECK, A. \"Le XVIIe siècle au miroir du XVIIIe.\" Littératures Classiques 34 (1998), 251–266.\n\nHow the 18th century saw itself in the mirror of the preceding century.\n\nBEUGNOT, BERNARD. Le discours de la retraite au XVIIe siècle — Loin du monde et du bruit. Paris: PUF, 1996.\n\nReview: F. Briot in RSH 250 (1998), 158–160: \"[L]e geste inaugural qui consiste, comme l'indique le titre, à inventer l'objet d'un discours de la retraite est novateur. Il invite à chercher, au sens noble du terme, le lieu commun du siècle, et non à se laisser séduire par des oppositions de surface; il contraint à une articulation rigoureuse entre les discours (la rhétorique notamment), les fictions et les actualisations de la retraite. ... C'est donc toute une reconstruction du siècle et de ses modèles existentiels qui s'opère peu à peu sous les yeux du lecteur, à qui s'offre l'image d'une époque plus mouvante, plus précaire et aux lignes de fracture plus subtiles qu'on ne le dit souvent. Un des points les plus sensibles de l'ouvrage réside dans la rigoureuse analyse, nourrie de lectures par définition variées et hétérogènes, de l'extraordinatire plasticité des modèles invoqués, modèles réaménagés selon les besoins et l'usage qui est fait de la retraite.... Habiter sa retraite, qu'elle soit euphorique ou non, religieuse ou libertine, choisie ou imposée, c'est ... se bâtir ... sa propre demeure de langage.... Nul doute ... que ce livre est appelé à jouer un rôle de référence, et de 'camp de base' pour nombre d'expéditions à venir dans la littérature du XVIIe siècle. Une véritable recherche, en un mot, et un modèle de méthode.\"\n\nBEUGNOT, BERNARD. Les Muses classiques. Essai de bibliographie rhétorique et poétique. Paris: Klincksieck, 1996.\n\nReview: Nathalie Grande in RHL 99.3 (1999) 539–40: This work, which the reviewer calls an \"ensemble remarquable,\" mirrors the renewed interest in seventeenth-century French classicism. While B's stated purpose to \"mettre à la disposition des jeunes chercheurs...un manuel bibliographique [leur] permettant de se repérer dans la forêt des références,\" is relatively \"modest,\" G. states that the volume contains the research of some of France's most renowned dix-septiémistes. B's text divides itself into five sections: 1) \"Héritages\" dealing with the Greco-Latin, Medieval and humanists influences on seventeenth-century French literature, 2) \"Poétiques et rhétoriques générales,\" where one finds a list of principal source manuscripts, 3) \"Poétiques et rhétoriques particulières,\" which extends the previous section and centers on the question of genre, 4) \"Poétiques et rhétoriques en acte,\" where the volume describes specific authors, works, and controversies, and 5) \"Perspectives européennes,\" a section largely comparative in scope. Concluding her review, G. states that B's work is an \"outil...indispensable pour tous ceux que le XVIIe passionne.\n\nBLOCH, OLIVIER AND ANTONY MACKENNA, eds.

Discontinuité et/ou hétérogenéité de l'oeuvre littéraire. Les Cahiers Forelle 8 (1997).\n\nReview: M. Petersen in OeC 24.1 (1999), 317–19: Actes du colloque (janvier 1996) par le groupe de recherche \"Littérature et société en France, en Italie, en Espagne et au Portugal aux XVe–XVIIe siècles.\" Contributions \"académiquement irréprochables\" mais \"il n'est pas nécessaire . . . de légitimer ces beaux travaux en les regroupant sous une banière thématique des plus ternes.\" Voir: R Zuber, \"'Les Belles Infidèles' et la formation du goût classique\"; L. Picciola sur l'Astrée d'Honoré d'Urfé; B. Delignon sur des \"Peintures morales\" du Père le Moyne.\n\nBOLOVAN, MARGARET M. \"Surfing le dix-septième: Accessing French Literature on the World Wide Web.\" PFSCL 26 (1999), 301–308.\n\nCommunication delivered during the 1998 MLA Convention conference on \"The Seventeenth-Century in the Media: Cinema, Television, World Wide Web, CD-Rom.\" This essay on the \"digital 17ème\" focuses on availability of material, as well as on the extended space for dialogue created on the internet. Sites of interest analyzed: \"Le Théâtre de la foire\", \"A la découverte de Jean de La Fontaine\" and \"Madame de La Fayette: Book of Hours.\"\n\nBONTEA, ADRIANA. \"Tragédie et histoire universelle.\" SCFS 20 (1998), 57–68.\n\nLoosely defined and rambling explorations of the concepts from the principal handbooks of tragic theory that give the genre the status of \"royal\" and of the strategies forced upon history to accredit allied \"royal\" mythmaking.\n\nBOURGEOIS-COURTOIS, MURIEL. \"Réflexion morale et culture mondaine (matériaux pour une synthèse).\" DSS 202 (1999), 9–19.\n\nReviews recent scholarship on culture mondaine as a source of inspiration to moralists but argues in conclusion that, despite the close affiliation of moralists and court society, current research on moralists should not neglect \"culture populaire\" and the minores.\n\nBOUVIER, MICHEL. \"Les minores.\" DSS 202 (1999), 21–26.\n\nAuthor defends the status and importance of \"moralistes dits mineurs,\" often overlooked because they did not practice the brief, fragmented discursive form of canonical moralists. Ultimately argues that the generic definition of moralists should be grounded in thematic specificity rather than formal features of the work.\n\nBRINK, ANDRE. The Novel: Language and Narrative from Cervantes to Calvino. New York: New York University Press, 1998.\n\nReview: J. F. O'Malley in Choice 36.3 (1998), 515: \"These 15 essays ... focus on the language, not the history, of the novel .... Brink considers language a prison house, not a reliable path to the truth, a fall into a gnostic world of confusion and chaos.\" Thus, language \"becomes ... a gender trap\" in La Princesse de Clèves,\" etc. This perceptive reading of 15 great novels sensitizes the reader to the nuances of language.\n\nBRIOT, FREDERIC. \"L'empire des cygnes (poétique du travestissement sexuel au XVIIe siècle.\" RSH 252 (1998), 37–48.\n\nAnalyzes Furetière's definition of \"l'oubli,\" as well as a fragment of the \"Songe de Vaux\" of La Fontaine, Rotrou's L'Hypocondriaque ou le mort amoureux and Agésilan de Colchos, L'Astrée, Hortense Mancini's Mémoires, the abbé de Choisy's Mémoires de l'abbé de Choisy habillé en femme, Voiture's \"Sur sa maîtresse rencontrée en habit de garçon, un soir de carnaval,\" Sévigné's correspondence, a sonnet by Saint Paulin, and Boileau's twelfth satire. Conclusion: in all the texts studied, \"le motif du travestissement (sexuel) conduit à une poétique de l'oubli (textuel).\" C'est une \"exigence de liberté où l'oubli créateur est avant tout déréglement.\"\n\nBRIOT, FREDERIC, ed.
