        "text": "Contents\n\nNote: ALL of the material below is sourced from this document. I do NOT claim to be the author of any of this material. I created this page because I found the original page (on Google Docs) too laggy and difficult to navigate. Any modifications or notes of my own are included in a blockquote, such as this note.\n\nThis document will always be in progress. Please make suggestions!\n\nNote: Please make suggestions on the original document instead of contacting me (Geoffrey).\n\nI’ve divided this document into four sections. The first consists of “surveys,” textbooks, and similar books that are (1) meant to be read (2) high-quality and (3) useful for quizbowl learning and writing. The second consists of print reference works, lists, anthologies, and other resources that are useful to consult, along with other media like documentaries. The third is a selection of online resources from both categories. Finally, the fourth gives top-quality journals, specialist news websites, and similar resources. The idea is to provide a comprehensive list of resources to help writers and players (primarily college-level and above) move past Wikipedia and whatever (dubious) books they randomly happen to find.\n\nBolded authors are famous enough to get you quizbowl points from just knowing who they are; even more so with bolded and underlined authors.\n\nNote: Due to the copying over from Google Docs, most of the bolding and underlining is not present on this document. Consult the original document for bolding and/or underlining.\n\nThis is a list for secondary sources only (except mythology, where there’s often no point), and restricted to English-language sources. The point is to have a list of “good-for-quizbowl” texts you’re unlikely to encounter through quizbowl questions themselves—it’s not supposed to be an ad-hoc NAQT-style frequency list.\n\nThis list skews heavily toward scholarly works, and I’d prefer to keep it that way. “Quizbowl is an academic competition that….”\n\nIn general, Oxford Very Short Introductions (what the name says) and Cambridge Companions (more in-depth; individual chapters will often be plenty) are great starting points. Cambridge Histories are the gold standard for humanities reference handbooks, but can often be very dense, and may not always translate well into points.\n\nThis list originated as an expansion of lists of science textbooks compiled by Eric Mukherjee and Jerry Vinokurov; it has benefited especially by suggestions from Matt Bollinger, Stephen Eltinge, Joey Goldman, and Taylor Harvey, among many others.\n\n1 Surveys/Textbooks\n\nunder construction, suggestions very welcome\n\nGeneral Humanities/Cultural History\n\nJ.L.
