The cover of my first book, on Wordsworth, was illustrated with a populous revolutionary crowd scene, while the cover of my second book, about information culture, imitated the Apple-like look of a computer whose uncrowded, minimalist, white design is punctuated by the mark of the individual: a cursor arrow. Somewhere between that lonely (romantic/cool) cursor and that crowd lay the trajectory of my argument.\n\n/\n\nx\n\n/\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe present book also owes much to many (named in individual chapters and notes). But I am clearing the field to let stand only a single acknowledgment. This book is dedicated to Richard Helgerson. Mentor, colleague, friend, and intimate of my family, Richard is himself a multitude—and unique. When I first met him at a conference on romanticism and the New Historicism at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1986 (where, as I remember, I had the temerity as a young unknown to call on him in the audience to speak generally about the New Historicism from his vantage in the Renaissance field), I knew only that he was one of the leading intellects in a new movement with which I found my own work increasingly resonating. I did not know that in the next year he would bring me (and my spouse, the Renaissance scholar Patricia Fumerton) to the West Coast to join him at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Nor could I have known that, in the score of years since then, he would be such a champion and companion of my work, consult so generously when I made my risky, midcareer move into the field of information culture (suffering my cascades of e-mail when it was all new and I took the medium out for a ride), and maintain such a steady interest in my research even as it drifted further afield from his. I do not know of a more consummate citizen and leader of our profession: at once disciplined and open, rigorous and generous, pragmatic and idealistic, careful and caring, great and good. Those who have followed Richard’s work will by now be acquainted with the already legendary book he wrote in a single, sustained burst— both breaking new ground and summarizing his life’s work—after he entered treatment for pancreatic cancer in 2005. That book, A Sonnet from Carthage: Garcilaso de la Vega and the New Poetry of Sixteenth-Century Europe (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007), is for me the model for what my own scholarship might one day hope to be. Emergent from a lifetime’s rigorous and detailed knowledge, it strips away the inessential apparatus at last to lay bare the bones and the heart. The bones are the sociopolitical framework of early modernity—that coupling of expansive imperial desire and tight internal repression that set the mold for our own global modernity. The heart that pulses within is the poetic sensibility of Garcilaso, in whose sonnet we read the alternately diastolic and systolic, socially expansive and inwardly reflective rhythm of the individual caught in the great movements of history. The strategy of Richard’s book on Garcilaso—reading multitudes in an individual, an epic within a sonnet— is the template for my present acknowledgment. As he is to Garcilaso, so I am to him.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n/\n\nxi\n\n/\n\nI remember those heady days in the 1980s and 1990s when cultural criticism, the New Historicism, the New Cultural History, cultural anthropology, postmodern theory, and the other movements I address in the chapters that follow were new. This passage from Richard’s book (which he calls an essay) about Garcilaso and the “new poetry” of the sixteenth-century seems to me to capture, mutatis mutandis, the spirit of the “new” movements—in, not out of, history—that are my theme: Though this essay concerns a very specific place and time, its implications reach well beyond those limits, reach to efforts at self-conscious literary renewal wherever and whenever they have occurred. The most obvious of those extensions, included within the essay itself, are back to Roman antiquity and to the fourteenth century of Petrarch’s Italy. But they also extend forward. The five fundamental conditions I find working through Garcilaso’s sonnet and through the new poetry of sixteenth-century Europe—(1) a political transformation needing a new literary expression, (2) a set of formal literary innovations responding to those changes, (3) a commitment to a particular place that sometimes challenges the grander designs of imperial politics, (4) a loss of self in desires that may arise from but often counter political ambition, and (5) the intimately immediate relations between the writers who collectively assume the task of radical literary change—have in different mixes and with different emphases recurred again and again. (xvi–xvii)\n\nTo be new in such a historically full sense, as Richard has been, is a high accomplishment and beyond the reach of most in today’s season of start-ups. Along with the introduction, two of the essays in this collection have not previously been published: chapter 6, which earlier appeared only in an abridged, German translation (by Jürgen Blasius) titled “Die interdisziplinäre Kriegsmaschine” (The interdisciplinary war machine) in Texte zur Kunste, no. 12 (November 1993): 127–37, and chapter 9, which has not before appeared at all. The other essays in this volume were previously published in earlier forms as follows: chapter 1, “The Power of Formalism: The New Historicism,” in ELH 56 (1989): 721–71 (© 1989 The Johns Hopkins University Press); chapter 2, “Trying Cultural Criticism: Wordsworth and Subversion” (as “Wordsworth and Subversion, 1793–1804: Trying Cultural Criticism”), in Yale Journal of Criticism 2, no. 2 (Spring 1989): 55–100; chapter 3, “Local Transcendence: Cultural Criticism, Postmodernism, and the\n\n/\n\nxii\n\n/\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nRomanticism of Detail,” in Representations 32 (Fall 1990): 75–113 (© 1990 by the Regents of the University of California); chapter 4, “Remembering the Spruce Goose: Historicism, Postmodernism, Romanticism,” in South Atlantic Quarterly 102 (2003): 263–78; chapter 5, “The New Historicism and the Work of Mourning,” in Studies in Romanticism 35 (1996): 553–62 (© 1996 by the Trustees of Boston University) (reprinted in slightly revised form in The Wordsworthian Enlightenment: Romantic Poetry and the Ecology of Reading, ed. Helen Regueiro Elam and Frances Ferguson [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005]); chapter 7, “Sidney’s Technology: A Critique by Technology of Literary History,” in Acts of Narrative, ed. Carol Jacobs and Henry Sussman (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2003): 174–94 (© 2003 by the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University); and chapter 8, “Transcendental Data: Toward a Cultural History and Aesthetics of the New Encoded Discourse,” in Critical Inquiry 31 (2004): 49–84 (© 2004 by The University of Chicago). For the previously published essays, I have only occasionally made substantive additions or revisions. More commonly, I have added illustrations that earlier could not be included, expanded notes that were cut for journal publication, updated some references, consolidated citations, and made stylistic as well as other minor emendations. I have also altered the “time sense” of the essays wherever I felt that an especially noticeable mention of “recent” developments in the original might better be allowed to recede into a longer perspective—one from which, today, some of the trends I discuss appear in a sunset light announcing the coming of their own status as historical. But I have not altered the time sense too much, choosing to let the essays have their moment. Appropriate to my theme, now is a traversing, historical moment.\n\n/\n\nIntroduction Contingent Methods\n\nIn the postindustrial West, the history of the new millennium has opened on a sense of loose beginnings and loose ends. Chasing the new or innovative in business, technology, media, art, fashion, and so on, we seem to ourselves to slip the bonds of the past and become, again, aboriginals. We are post- rather than prehistorical aborigines (ab + orı¯gine: “from the origin”) seeking a new beginning. Multibillion-dollar companies thus defend patents that legally eschew all “prior art.”1 Artistic and theoretical movements cut themselves off from the past with the prefix post- (the successor to twentieth-century movements signed avant-). And even our darkest collective visions—whether the postapocalyptic fantasies of the Road Warrior and Matrix films or the post–September 11 realities of terror—make us out to be survivors in a starkly new age. In short, we are the people of what Joseph Schumpeter—in a phrase of 1942 now widely applied to\n\n/\n\n2\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\npostindustrialism—called “creative destruction.”2 We make a sharp, jagged break with the past so that we can create. And all our creations, we decree, will be worlds—or at least patents, corporations, architectures, arts, intellectual movements, and now, above all, information—seeming ab ovo, sufficient unto themselves, knowing no historical other. Such is the beginning of a new millenarianism—a loosening of beginnings from all that gave beginnings their beginning.3 Never mind that the new beginnings expressed by “electronic frontier foundations,” “declarations of the independence of cyberspace,” doctrines of “spreading democracy,” and so on also seem unaccountably needy of history (at least an Enlightenment, revolutionary history at the origin of the modern credo of the new). But ours is a history of loose ends too. Symmetrical with the search for new beginnings is a search for a new concept of what it means to have an end. Once, the ends that truly mattered—the endings that made sense of beginnings—were eschatological or teleological: all things ended in a single design of God, spirit (Geist), classless society, and so on (and, in personal life, death, salvation, damnation). But now we crave an ending appropriate to a history of loose beginnings. If all our creations are imagined to be discrete worlds, then in the idiom of communications technology they are structurally “nodes”; and the end of a node—in the sense that a wire beginning at one node terminates in another—is connectivity. Expressed geopolitically as globalism, technologically as networking, and artistically as intertextuality, appropriation, sampling, and so on, connectivity is the presentist, “just-in-time” end—or loose end—of multiple, reconfigurable terminations. In the now-dominant information metaphor: it is all a web. We are all nodes sending “packets” (encoded with a brief TTL, or “time to live”) to other nodes in a call for instantaneous, transient connectivity.4 Never mind that we seem simultaneously to crave the conviction of absolute endings, whether marked by a fallen Berlin Wall announcing the “end of history” or military pyrotechnics of “shock and awe” intended to end a war as soon as it begins. Shall such a neoaboriginal, just-in-time, confl icted history—I will call it postmodern historicism—be our only sense of history? Or are there past experiences of history whose alternate balance between denying and needing history haunts us in ways that put in question the very notion of a uniquely postmodern historicism of pure beginnings and instantaneous endings? After all, it is history itself that incessantly loosens people from their land, ancestors, nation, and so on to make them look away from,\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n3\n\n/\n\nyet hunger for, the haunted connectivity that is the sense of history in the first place. And a metaquestion: Might it be the task of the most advanced, recent expressions of postmodern historicism—the various new historicisms and cultural criticisms of the past few decades—not just to participate in postmodern historicism, but also to give utterance to such haunting by alter histories, thus saving a place within the age of creative destruction for premonitory or oppositional senses of history? These are the questions that frame Local Transcendence. The essays collected here were written from 1986 to the present during a period when I, like others, was engaged in sustained projects of historicist cultural criticism yet felt the need to reflect on and—from the inside—criticize the methodology of such projects. The best way to characterize these essays, indeed, is to say that they are an internal critique of the historicist way in contemporary cultural criticism. The nature of such internal critique—or critical advocacy—will emerge from glossing the key concepts in this latter description of my topic: historicism, cultural criticism, contemporary, and way. I will do so in two movements, treating the first three terms as one related sequence, and then addressing the last as an expression of the inner logic of that relation. Historicism\n\nThe underlying object of study in this book is historicism—specifically, postmodern historicism—as a pervasive sociocultural condition. Theorists of postmodernism or, on its socioeconomic and political side, postindustrialism have described this condition in large, systemic terms as, for example, “space-time compression” and the “end of history.”5 The late-capitalist and -democratic world system, essentially, has taken on the features of the global, just-in-time corporation that is its microcosm, and vice versa. But I prefer to personalize such a condition as the ethos—the generalizable character, posture, or attitude—of the individuals who live and work in the changed world system. In The Laws of Cool: Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information, I studied this ethos under the name cool, which, I asserted, is a fundamentally historical condition even if its presentist “now” seems to epitomize postmodern space-time compression. Who, I asked, are the people who “work here” but are “cool”?6 They are the people whose folk, class, gender, racial, ethnic, religious, and other historical identities have been so thoroughly restructured by postindustrialism—for example, in organizations that “change their culture”—that they no longer have any effective means to assert an identity. Or, rather,\n\n/\n\n4\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nthey have no means to do so except through ad hoc instruments of style fashioned precisely from the antihistorical commodities, technologies, and media produced by postindustrialism. Internalizing just-in-time creative destruction, they—which is to say we—thus become the people of the cutting-edge new. To ventriloquize: our company and our brave new world, they destroy all the history that makes us us in the name of innovation, which, because the cutting edge is sharp, we suffer as restructuring, downsizing, outsourcing, decreased benefits, scaled-back safety nets, and all the other weapons of mass destruction in the current corporate and government armament. But we’re cool. Even as we bleed on that edge where the new world order comes down like a guillotine on historical identities, we internalize an edgy, avant-garde cool that both mimics postindustrialism and gestures toward a folk identity like that of old. We instant-message and blog at work, for example, using the coolest new tech to refresh old, communal habits. Or we retreat behind iPod earphones that save us from being cubicle-people shuffl ing documents by making us pod-people shuffl ing music in a phantom tribal dance.7 The very practices, media, and tools we use to deny history, in sum, paradoxically declare our need for the experience of history. The result of such a split sense of history—at once needy and in denial—is that history manifests in the distinctive style of the postmodern. We do not have history, but we have historicism. Historicism is a facade or screen history like a Hollywood history film or computer game in the style of Civilization.8 It is a “pastiche” of special effects, virtual “worlds,” or detachable “skins” (computer user interfaces) levitating just above historical foundations.9 More destabilizing still, such screen (or, emphasizing its neediness) cling-wrap historicism subversively whispers that any sense of foundational history must itself have been only a misconstruction of the looser stuff of life, which may be history all the way down but—exactly for that reason—has no bottom. Foundation itself is just tectonic plates sliding free. We remember, after all, that the analogism of the as in the “as it really was” (or “how it really was”) of nineteenth-century historicism already implied such instability. The apparent robustness of Ranke’s wie es eigentlich gewesen—the gusto of contact it enabled between the present and the immersive past—depended perilously on the slender thread of that simulational wie, which, as historicism developed from the nineteenth century to its so-called crisis of historicism circa World War I, proved to be a link that had to be looped around in complex, interpretive knots of hermeneutics to be made adequate to belief.10 But now the link of experi-\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n5\n\n/\n\nence between present and past is even more stretched, and we lack the patience to tie the complicated knots that would secure historicism—no matter how immersively simulated in detail and anecdote—to a history deeper than ourselves. Cultural Criticism\n\nIn this book, the particular screen of historicism I study as a mediation of general postmodern historicism is the coolest of recent intellectual movements: cultural criticism. While my underlying topic is postmodern historicism in general, in other words, my proximate object of study consists of the interdisciplinary intellectual movements from the 1980s on that have shaped our most advanced understandings of such historicism. They have done so by situating any and all cultural phenomena within that great facsimile of historical experience: context. Intellectuals today worship few things they will admit to, whether beautiful or true. But they worship cultural context, which thus becomes the ark for whatever works, creeds, identities, ethics, and so on still retain the root sense of cult in culture that Walter Benjamin called “aura” and that cultural criticism renders through microauras of detailism, anecdotalism, subculturalism, and other nanohistoricisms that dedicate themselves to the universal by way of the holy local.11 In particular, the main witnesses I call are the subset of cultural criticisms that I have myself most engaged as participant and/or critic in the last two decades. These include the New Historicism (with whose variant in the romantics field my early work was associated), the New Cultural History, cultural anthropology, certain kinds of the New Pragmatism, the new Marxism, and various aspects of postmodern and postindustrial theory (French, German, and American).12 There are omissions here, of course, since the boundaries of cultural criticism can also be drawn to include feminism and gender studies, race and ethnicity studies, postcolonial studies, popular culture studies, media studies, and so on. And there are new fields I would have liked to include too, such as “media archaeology,” which resees the past as a history of disruptive new media technologies.13 However, I have not tried to widen my horizon in all directions. Doing so would have not only taxed my own expertise beyond credibility but also blurred my main purpose, which is not to offer an equal, wide survey of recent cultural criticisms but to think specifically about the historicist program in such criticisms. In this regard, the movements I focus on form a kind of densely interconnected cluster on the side of the graph where there is plentiful work with historical materials combined with critical awareness of the problem of historicism itself.\n\n/\n\n6\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn any case, the most important thing to say at the outset is that the cultural criticisms I address (in common with those I do not) are intellectual movements hosted by the contemporary academy and, thus, represent the general ethos of historicism only in a specific social sector. Such specificity has its cost, of course. I doubt that I will be invited onto radio talk shows to discuss cultural criticism, as I was to discuss cool. But it has its gains too. Part of what is at stake in the present volume, as I have suggested, is the hypothesis that, while expert formulations of historicism in the academy participate in broader contemporary movements, they also offer a distinctive critical vantage on those movements that my own standpoint of internal critique within academic cultural criticism models recursively. Contemporary\n\nContemporary as the adjective of cultural criticism (together with post- as the prefix of modernism or industrialism) also requires explanation since in a book about historicism this term cannot be just indexical, like the minute hand on the clock. It is an argument. As might be expected, the sweet spot of contemporary cultural criticism in this book is from ca. 1980 to the present.14 This is the moment of the post-1970s (post–May 1968, post–Vietnam War, post-counterculture) intellectual generation when cultural criticism came into dominance in tandem with the rise of the Internet, the relational database, and other key information technologies—the whole underscoring, but also criticizing or hacking, the mighty simultaneity of the postmodern now. (Cultural criticism and what Geert Lovink calls “net criticism” or “critical Internet culture” are isomorphic. One of the framing hypotheses of the essays in this book, especially the last three, is that there is a structural convergence between historicism and informationalism, with the consequence that critical approaches arose in both domains in parallel—the New Historicism inventing its microhistorical anecdote, for example, exactly when so-called computer lib in the 1970s and 1980s seized on the personal computer to challenge the mainframe and hypertext theorists emancipated the “lexia” or “link” from linear text.)15 But, in my usage, contemporary also flexes back from today’s now to embrace a longer sense of modernity and its evolving critical sense of history. I argue that postmodern cultural criticism harbors within itself a succession of predecessor criticisms of culture traversing from early modern subversion (as formulated by the New Historicism), through romanticism, nineteenth-century historicism, and twentieth-century modernism\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n7\n\n/\n\n(as witnessed in the New Criticism or Russian Formalism), ultimately to postmodernism (which in some fields is itself now historical). Specifically, I concentrate in this book on the span of cultural criticism from romanticism through postmodernism—the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem, respectively, of the post-Enlightenment critique of modernity. In Jay Clayton’s words, “postmodernism has a hidden or repressed connection with nineteenth-century culture,” and “romanticism and postmodernism share the distinction of being the two most significant counter-Enlightenment discourses produced in the West.”16 This book is thus in part a record of the trajectory I myself took from the topic of romantic historicism in Wordsworth: The Sense of History (1989) to that of postindustrial historicism (expressed as informationalism) in The Laws of Cool (2004). Both romanticism and postindustrialism appear in their own eyes to transcend history—the former in the name of the original self, the latter in that of just in time. (And the early modern period studied by New Historicists does much the same in the name of self-fashioning.)17 But, however revolutionary or creatively destructive, romanticism and postindustrialism are also needy for history as their most profound condition of being and knowing, even if part of that condition is the willed unknowing and unbeing of history that I called denial of history in my book on Wordsworth and the ethos of the unknown in my book on cool.18 This means that the swelling sense of contemporaneity in both periods was necessarily accompanied by an antithetical historicism criticizing the modern zeitgeist— a reaction epitomized, for example, in the young Wordsworth’s neartreasonous identification with the ancient Celts against the English state during the French Revolution (the case study in chapter 2 below). While the early modern period may have had subversion, in other words, critique as we know it belongs to the epoch of modernization proper—from the era of Hegel on—as the specifically historicist engagement (dialectic) with modernization. Critique in the modern sense began in the transition between the Enlightenment and the counter-Enlightenment as historicism.19 I posit in this book, then, that a critical sense of history evolved in the period from ca. 1800 to 2000, with anticipations in the early modern period and the Enlightenment, and that it is the task of the new historicisms and cultural criticisms to inform today’s contemporaneity of the history of that critique—history, indeed, being the inner form of such critique. The function of criticism at the present time is to show that, while innovation and just in time may be antihistorical, they are also inheritors of a modernity that comes along with an internal critique expressed as a particularly edgy kind of history: the history of modernization.\n\n/\n\n8\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Historicist Way\n\nThis leaves the term way, which will bring the critical logic I outlined in the preceding conceptual series—historicism, cultural criticism, contemporary—at last to bear on the expression of that logic I have termed internal critique. When I speak of “the historicist way” in contemporary cultural criticism, I mean method (from meta + hodos, or meta-way). The essays in this book may take up specific historical or literary cases, but, in my recurrent effort to map the interrelations and antecedents of the various cultural criticisms, in my insistence that their habits of localism and detailism follow general principles, and in my sustained concern with their form, hermeneutics, discipline, technique, management, action, and practice as these interact with modern social processes, my intent is primarily methodological. Indeed, this book is ultimately about contemporary cultural criticism as the evolution of a method. On the face of it, of course, this latter assertion may be surprising since many of the cultural criticisms I address are known to be antimethodological. We know this because they say so. A famous case, for instance, is the New Historicism, some of whose leading practitioners have avowed an aversion, or at best an agnosticism, toward theoretical systems. Catherine Gallagher and Stephen Greenblatt thus write retrospectively on the first page of Practicing New Historicism: “Surely, we of all people should know something of the history and the principles of new historicism, but what we knew above all was that it (or perhaps we) resisted systematization. We had never formulated a set of theoretical propositions or articulated a program.”20 Secondary or external reports of the New Historicism have taken such avowed aversion to be canonical. In her New Literary Histories, for instance (one of the best works published after the fact to explain the postmodern historicisms), Claire Colebrook comments: “New historicism has been reluctant to identify itself with any particular theorist or theory. Indeed, new historicism had, until recently, remained an ostensibly untheorised practice with its main exponent, Stephen Greenblatt, declaring that new historicism was actually ‘no doctrine’ at all.”21 Borrowing the distinctive voice of one branch of the New Pragmatism, Colebrook generalizes: “Perhaps the traditional problem of literary theory—the validity of interpretive method—is no longer possible. We just interpret, with a full recognition of the contingency and arbitrariness of our interpretive position. We no longer legitimate our practices through literary theory.”22 But that’s just one page in the book of the New Historicism. On the very next page, we note, Gallagher and Greenblatt argue the counterposi-\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n9\n\n/\n\ntion: “To be sure, we talked constantly about our methodological principles. We eagerly read works of ‘theory’ emanating principally from Paris, Konstanz, Berlin, Frankfurt, Budapest, Tartu, and Moscow. . . . One of the recurrent criticisms of new historicism is that it is insufficiently theorized. The criticism is certainly just, and yet it seems curiously out of touch with the simultaneous fascination with theory and resistance to it that has shaped from the start our whole attempt to rethink the practice of literary and cultural studies.”23 Aversion to method in the New Historicism, it turns out, is steeped in ambient method. It’s like walking a minefield. Spend enough time surveying the theory bombs, if only to avoid them (in mixed fascination and resistance), and one ends up following a path as tight, convoluted, and forced in its posture as any declared method—but with the difference that the path follows no line of doctrine but instead seems to strike off at crazy, unpredictable tangents. In the New Historicism, in the New Cultural History’s microrather than macrohistory, in the locution of the “against-theory” New Pragmatists that things “just” are, in the matching preference of French neopragmatists for the “practice of everyday life” over “metanarratives,” and so on, antimethod has the broken rhythm (in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s terms) of the rhizomatic. But a thousand plateaus of cultural criticism also generate what Deleuze and Guattari would call a “plane of consistency,” a generic critical method. Nor, it should be pointed out, are the zigzags of such method merely defensive. (In this regard, the minefield comparison is too limited.) More fully, my argument is that recent cultural criticism internalizes the entire critical scene of method and antimethod that was symptomatic of modernity, which, by definition, is a self-correcting, rather than God- or kingcorrecting, system. Such vows of “no doctrine” as those cited above— hauntingly reminiscent of previous “we have no method” doctrines (e.g., in late works of Russian Formalism such as Boris Eichenbaum’s “The Theory of the ‘Formal Method’ ”)—are positions taken in the aftermath of a specifically modern system of dialectical argument, or self-quarrel. Modern method would not be method, in other words, if it did not correct itself antithetically from within in ways that, when they first appear, always seem to be antimethodologies from outside the system (intuitive, empirical, pragmatic, and so on)—such appearance from a putatively external frame of reference, inevitably appropriated to the label new, being part of the modern system that allows critique to emerge at all. We thus need to desynonymize method from system in the singular if we are to recognize that cultural criticism is nothing if not methodological. Nineteenth-century dialectic started out destabilizing the idea of\n\n/\n\n10\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\na single world system but at last reconstituted it in such neoimperial syntheses as Hegel’s “absolute knowledge,” Marx’s “classless” state, American “scientific management” and corporatism, central European bureaucratism and gesellschaft, and so on—with Stalin, the great military-industrial war states, and other twentieth-century systems waiting in the wings. It has thus taken nearly another century of cultural criticism since then (roughly from the epoch of the early Frankfurt school, American Southern agrarianism and the New Criticism, and early structuralism) to discern that the inherently differential methods, approaches, and theories of modernization are not the same as totalitarian or even hegemonic system. Form, structure, deconstruction, and so on were some of the methods of difference making that made that recognition possible. There is no form without its irony or defamiliarization, the formalists said. There is no structure without its scandal, Claude Lévi-Strauss said (nor S without its Z, Roland Barthes elaborated). And there is no meaning without its différance or “resistance to theory,” deconstruction added. Recent cultural criticism continues the trend, breaking system down, not into antithetical images, phrase regimes, words, and phonemes (the particles and antiparticles, as it were, that its predecessors had substituted for Newtonian, absolute meaning), but into their cultural equivalents: contestatory subcultures, microhistories, anecdotes, relative autonomies, practices of everyday life, and so on. All this is to say that, while the methods of cultural criticism may be approaches (“ways”) to a system, they are by design not a closed system; and their very status as not-system—indeed, as systems that create their own not-system—is deployed critically within the modern world system as its internal critique. The real question, therefore, is not whether contemporary cultural criticism is a modern method but how it is also specifically a postmodern method. Dialectical, formal, structuralist, and deconstructive methods— the selective genealogy of thought I rapidly reviewed above—are demonstrably part of the heritage of a phrase like Gallagher and Greenblatt’s “fascination with theory and resistance to it.” But I think there is a remainder in excess of that heritage that is the specifically new contribution of the New Historicism and related cultural criticisms—a surplus style of dialectic, form, or (post)structure without which we would not be able to account for the sheer busyness, the kinetic restlessness, of their zigzags. Or, if “new” is too suspect in our present context, we might speak instead of a difference-making “overlay” of method—a critical intervention that, like a Photoshop layer, comes merely by way of supervention over the persistence of the old. A passage I quoted earlier from Colebrook provides a convenient\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n11\n\n/\n\nprompt. Recall her description of contemporary cultural criticism as a confession of the “contingency and arbitrariness of our interpretive position.” This phrase, which redacts vocabulary common to many recent cultural criticisms, cues us to the distinctively postdialectical, posthermeneutical, postformalist, and poststructuralist quotient in the method of contemporary cultural criticism: contingency. Ours is an age “adrift in Late Contingency,” Joshua Clover writes in his poem Their Ambiguity (which, in part, is a critique of the culture of the new).24 From my early discussions in this book of ad hoc anecdotes, microhistories, and details to my final comparison of anecdotes to information in databases (which, in theory, free any datum from being locked into a context), I move toward understanding contingency as the distinctive method of late historicism. Contingent method, as I propose to call it, is the tangential method, or methodical tangency, of postmodern historicism. It is its zigzag mode (as I put it above) of striking off on crazy, unpredictable tangents. Or, again, as Marlon B. Ross has said about the New Historicism, a complex inner structure of contingency drives the “anti-methodical method (or methodical anti-method)” of the movement down accidental “cowpaths” (an image borrowed from Kenneth Burke).25 But how does contingency actually work as a critical method, rather than just as a symptom, of postmodern historicism? How does its detachable style of internal critique differ from—or, better, make a virtue of— loose beginnings and ends? By the Way\n\nI will begin by telling a fable, with the application—and, equally important, the method of that application—to be limned below. The fable consists of a postmodern reading of a section in the 1805 Prelude where William Wordsworth recounts a way he once walked through Salisbury Plain. In earlier poetry, Wordsworth had already narrated this walk (see chapter 2 below). But, late in The Prelude, he renarrates the walk in the form of a historical “reverie” that forecasts the whole romantic-to-postmodern lineage I have called the historicist way. The full verse paragraph is as follows (for convenience of analysis, I parse its structure as a preface followed by three discrete scenes): To such a mood, Once above all—a traveller at that time Upon the plain of Sarum—was I raised: There on the pastoral downs without a track\n\n315\n\n/\n\n12\n\n/\n\n[Scene 1]\n\n[Scene 2]\n\n[Scene 3]\n\nIntroduction\n\nTo guide me, or along the bare white roads Lengthening in solitude their dreary line, While through those vestiges of ancient times I ranged, and by the solitude o’ercome, I had reverie and saw the past, Saw multitudes of men, and here and there A single Briton in his wolf-skin vest, With shield and stone-ax, stride across the wold; The voice of spears was heard, the rattling spear Shaken by arms of mighty bone, in strength Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty. I called upon the darkness, and it took— A midnight darkness seemed to come and take— All objects from my sight; and lo, again The desart visible by dismal flames! It is the sacrificial altar, fed With living men—how deep the groans!—the voice Of those in the gigantic wicker thrills Throughout the region far and near, pervades The monumental hillocks, and the pomp Is for both worlds, the living and the dead. At other moments, for through that wide waste Three summer days I roamed, when ’twas my chance To have before me on the downy plain Lines, circles, mounts, a mystery of shapes Such as in many quarters yet survive, With intricate profusion figuring ’oer The untilled ground (the work, as some divine, Of infant science, imitative forms By which the Druids covertly expressed Their knowledge of the heavens, and imaged forth The constellations), I was gently charmed, Albeit with an antiquarian’s dream, And saw the bearded teachers, with white wands Uplifted, pointing to the starry sky, Alternately, and plain below, while breath Of music seemed to guide them, and the waste Was cheared with stillness and a pleasant sound.26\n\n320\n\n325\n\n330\n\n335\n\n340\n\n345\n\n350\n\nIf in a first interpretive pass we set our optical resolution low to take in the reverie as a whole, we might conclude that Wordsworth’s goal is\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n13\n\n/\n\ntotal immersion in history, confirming that he stands near the beginning of nineteenth-century historicism in the manner of “as it really was.” The poet “calls” on the past and, lo, “sees” the past (“I had reverie and saw the past”). Calling and seeing, encoding and rendering, are equated in a single, magical fiat of performative language. So powerful is the immersion effect—which, as Jennifer Jones has argued, is at least as important to the Wordsworthian sublime as transcendence 27—that Wordsworth even drifts from past into present tense: again The desart visible by dismal flames! It is the sacrificial altar.\n\nHistory is now, and, in the full-bandwidth immersion of that now, we are powerless to do more than watch the awful drama unfold with all the fatefulness that, at any moment, history always seems to endow the now of that moment. The tragic paradox of history, after all, is that our lived now appears perpetually alienated from the historical now. We seem powerless to act in the very moment in which we live, watching great events unfold instead. Most relevant to my argument, we seem powerless even to criticize effectively. We are paralyzed by synchrony with the zeitgeist. But, if we set our resolution high, then a second interpretive pass will reveal that the immersion effect ends, and critique begins, in the decomposition of Wordsworth’s reverie into a montage of discontinuous scenes. Indeed, a filmic vocabulary—or, more generally, a media analysis—is apt since our ultimate goal is to look ahead anachronistically to postromantic developments. From the later nineteenth century on, new linguistic, graphic, photographic, filmic, and other media not only updated “as it really was” into a distinctly modern form of reverie but also provided a new platform for critique. We might instance imagism, cubism, the New Typography, film montage in the style of Sergei Eisenstein, Russian Formalism, the New Criticism, and structural linguistics. All these movements set out in one way or another to make dialectical critique immanent in thick media effects— for example, by making defamiliarization, irony, paradox, and arbitrariness palpable in imagery, picture surface, collage, montage, or signifiers. To see Wordsworth’s reverie as a protomodernism, not just immersed in, but critical of history, in short, we need only inquire how we might shoot it as a film. In this light, it becomes immediately clear that the poet directs, not one, but a rapid sequence of scenes in a style akin to what Eisenstein later calls “montage” and—under the pressure of his own revolutionary moment—equates with dialectical critique.\n\n/\n\n14\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nScene 1 (lines 320–26) celebrates the ancient Britons or Celts by condensing their multitudes in the image of a heroic “single Briton.” The synecdoche, we note, is traditional to the trope by which the disconcertingly multiple British peoples fortify themselves as an individualist or stand-alone island unity in times of external threat. We think, for example, of Shakespeare’s drama of this scept’red isle, This earth of majesty . . . This fortress built by Nature for herself\n\nand Churchill’s narrative of the Battle of Britain: “Never in the field of human confl ict was so much owed by so many to so few.”28 According to the trope, the British multitudes (including the Celtic subalterns) rise as one in the person of the “single Briton.” But then there is a heavy-handed directorial intervention (“I called upon the darkness”), and we cut to scene 2 (lines 327–36), which exposes the side of the ancient Britons devoted to superstition, Druidic sacrificial altars, and the Wicker Man, all swarming, at this juncture in the poem soon after the books about the French Revolution, with allusion to the very opposite of the “single Briton” just across the Channel: the French mobs.29 Demonizing rather than heroicizing, this scene marks what must be taken to be the onset of critique in the episode. Yet it is a strangely detached, even amoral kind of critique. It is as if Wordsworth has absorbed only the scientific, observational personality of Enlightenment critique without the heavy-handed moralizing that typified philosophes of the period on both sides of the Channel. (One thinks, e.g., of Samuel Johnson’s Juvenalian “observation” of mankind in “The Vanity of Human Wishes”; Edward Gibbon’s reflection on the ages of superstition in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire; Edmund Burke’s excoriation of the French in Reflections on the Revolution in France; and, of course, the pronouncements of the French philosophes and revolutionaries themselves against religion, aristocracy, and tyranny.) By contrast, the tone of Wordsworth’s critique seems Hegelian in its soaring, metahistorical equanimity, its ability simply to pass from thesis to antithesis about the ancient Britons as if filling in the points on a graph of teleological civilizational development: “barbaric majesty” → “darkness” → synthesis (“the pomp / Is for both worlds, the living and the dead”). In hindsight, of course, critique in the Hegelian genealogy could itself appear heavy-handed as it evolved into modern apparatchik, avant-garde, and other forms of correctness. To see how Wordsworth’s critique also\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n15\n\n/\n\nanticipates postmodernity, therefore, we need to witness scene 3 (lines 337–53), which begins with a curiously off hand salute to “chance” (“At other moments, . . . when ’twas my chance”). This last scene opens on a labyrinth of literal ways figured on Salisbury Plain—“Lines, circles, mounts, a mystery of shapes”—commanded again by the Druids. But now the Druids, who preside over the moment of enlightened synthesis in the passage, appear in a bright aspect that no historical method prior to romantic dialectic knew how to reconcile with their dark, barbarous, sacrificial alter ego—the total effect being an antithesis of bright and dark that only Hegelian logic and its aftermath (e.g., cold war logic) will “solve” (eventually allowing popular artists such as George Lucas, e.g., effortlessly to think the antithesis as a détente between Druid-like Jedi and the dark side of the Force).30 Now the Druids are astronomers, natural philosophers, and teachers—in a word, interpreters of the mysterious ways of the world figured in all those henges and monoliths. And what they teach is a theory of worldly ways that is literally a meta-way or higher way: astronomy. Potentially, of course, that way also lies heavy-handed, didactic correctness (or Hegelian absolute knowledge): “with white wands / Uplifted,” the Druids point “to the starry sky, / Alternately, and plain below.” Yet, when prefaced by the poet’s own off handedness (“At other moments, . . . ’twas my chance”), and when excused as conducting a merely “gentle,” “antiquarian,” and so unmethodical charm, the felt effect is the opposite of heavy-handed. Though the Druids are the very theoreticians of the meta-way, or method, their whole magic in Wordsworth’s passage seems to lie in conducting an off hand, ad hoc lightness of being. Fate may lie in the stars, in other words, but the proper conduct of fate on earth is as light and free as the fairy magic that always ensues when, after the day’s labors or wars, we lift our eyes to the sky and imagine. Fate sublimes into what fairies make of chance: luck (or, as the angels would have it, grace).31 There is at the last no overdetermined critique but, instead, an antithesis to the entire, previous antithesis of barbaric majesty and dark savagery imparted with immeasurable obliqueness through an arbitrariness—a zen—of chance. Not, “You must follow the method,” in other words, but, “Oh, by the way, there’s a method.” The progress of civilization is as much a detour as a telos. Such underdetermination of method in romanticism, I suggest, initiates a subplot of dialectical method that winds its way from the nineteenth century through modernism and postmodernism until at last it emerges as the main plot I name contingency. From dialectic to contingency: it’s as if critical method becomes just an anecdote, a koan that rises free of immersion in history on a bubble of off handedness. It’s as if enlighten-\n\n/\n\n16\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nment becomes a peel-away super- rather than intervention. Critical insight adheres to, as much as inheres in, history. Contingent Method\n\nWe might have told other fables to reach the same goal, of course, but this strangely off hand episode in Wordsworth is as good a prelude as any to the contingent postmodern historicism I advocate for cultural criticism and that, in their various ways, these essays theorize or exemplify. Though no summary statement can be entirely true to the modus operandi of essays that have evolved over twenty years in response to particular needs rooted in their time, perhaps there may, nevertheless, be some value in distilling the principles of contingent postmodern historicism as I currently understand them. I do so through the following five recommendations, each untrue when taken alone, each adequate only when corrected by the others so as to ensure that the fallacies of general postmodern historicism— looseness of beginnings and ends, factitiousness of the new, screen-like detachment from history—criticize each other to sustain a compensatory, fragile bubble of historical understanding amid future worlds. 1. Complicate history. For my muse—but also for my countermuse—I summon up Walter Benjamin’s familiar angel of history from “Theses on the Philosophy of History” (1940). The angel, we may say, acts out a modern version of the backward-looking Prelude. As such, he is an updated Druid with a specifically modern stance toward history: A Klee painting named “Angelus Novus” [figure 0.1] shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such a violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress. (Thesis 9)32\n\nWhile Benjamin’s stance toward history must be honored in its own time, for us, now, it must also be reoriented to unlock the legacy of off hand\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n17\n\n/\n\nFigure 0.1. Paul Klee, Angelus Novus (1920).\n\nromanticism (as I earlier termed it) that it carries fragilely and secretly through straitened modernity to our postmodern times. To begin with, the angel “sees one single catastrophe,” a “pile of debris.” But, for contemporary cultural criticism, history since even 1940 is at least several catastrophes, each with its own—and, recently, twin—piles\n\n/\n\n18\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nof debris. My first recommendation is that cultural criticism today must differentiate between catastrophes in order to resist any too-easy piling up of today’s enemies with yesterday’s fascists, communists, imperialists, “axes of evil,” and all other modern-style thousand-year-reich total histories (the catastrophic take-it-or-leave-it history symptomatic of modern “progress”). Or, to go micro, cultural criticism should look closely into individual catastrophes to detotalize them into internally differentiated fields of disaster. Sifted with the historiographic tools of Annales history, cultural materialism, Althusserian Marxism, Foucault’s “epistemic” analysis, Geertz’s “thick description,” and so forth, the debris of history takes on an unaccountably rich interior structure. Indeed, in recent “catastrophe theory” or Ilya Prigogine’s systems theory with its chaotic “bifurcation points,” catastrophe itself has structure.33 The historical “pile of debris,” in other words, is complexly plied with essential, rather than accidental, plurality. Rather than gathering into either a single presence or the big bang explosion of such presence (Benjamin’s “pile of debris,” we recognize, precisely disintegrates the “aura” he theorized in “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”), history proliferates as a multilayered, sedimented, turbulent, and self-organizing ecology of local determination. Lots of particulars in many kinds of structures, in other words, and even glimpses of metarelations between structures, but no one, grand structure vulnerable to equally totalizing collapses of structure. Such, for example, is the vision of history that Manuel De Landa— blending Fernand Braudel’s geologically inspired Annales historiography, Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizomatics, and Prigogine’s nonequilibrium systems theory—calls “a thousand years of nonlinear history.”34 Instead of conceptualizing the relation between past and present as linear, we might best think of it in De Landa’s manner as a Braudelian multilayered sea, a Deleuze/Guattarian thousand plateaus, or a Prigogine dissipative system fractured with bifurcation points—that is, as a network or assemblage characterized by multiple rates of flow, redundant or interfering communication channels, and competing self-organizing and self-destructive behaviors. History is a complicated texture, which is what contemporary cultural criticism means by context. 2. Immerse ourselves in history. In the Second World War context of the full “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” of course, Benjamin’s angel is not just a horrified spectator but also an engaged cultural critic. He is one face of the “historical materialism” that Benjamin posed against the contemporary storm wind of “universal historicism,” technocratic “progress,” and—the storm trooper of all that—fascism. But the cost of the angel’s dissent from the hyperprogressivism of his era is that—as captured in The-\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n19\n\n/\n\nsis 9 (quoted above)—his mode of engagement appears the very opposite of engagement: a kind of retreat from or, at best, reluctant immersion in history (“looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating”). In the context of 1940, we may say, the snapshot in which Thesis 9 captures him is like a passport photo. (Benjamin owned the Klee watercolor on which Thesis 9 is based, and, given his special admiration of Klee, it would not be far-fetched to see the watercolor as a kind of artistic personal identity document.)35 Flash! It is as if the angel were presenting his papers to the SA or SS: “I have no meaningful history. I am just a bystander.” A paradoxical blend of provocation and retreat to fight another day, Benjamin’s essay is cultural criticism in survivor’s mode. My second recommendation for postmodern cultural criticism is to turn this Benjaminian mise-en-scène around to make it indeed about immersion in, rather than refuge from, history. In contemporary cultural criticism, the angel should appear as though he were about to move into something he is fixedly contemplating—specifically, a historical context complicated enough that, like a fractal sponge (Menger sponge), it exerts an absorptive rather than a repulsive power, sucking him in, rather than blowing him back.36 Or, more fully, since the historical actors that cultural criticism contemplates are equally historical whether they pose as activists in or refugees from historical life, the task of cultural criticism today is to take some of the burden off the individual Benjaminian angel by revolving our observer’s camera angle hemispherically around so that we view his stance from the back, framed against—in the act of confronting—history. Repositioning our viewpoint in this fashion will shift our regard from the individual participant-observer to the larger, contested historical patterns that emerge through, and around, individuals. If postmodern society today is committed exorbitantly to the new, in short, then cultural criticism must compensate by dedicating itself with equal excess to confronting the old, where old is a relative term untethered to any particular lapse of years. (In some cases, even a short interval provides critical leverage.) Such immersion in history can be as ambient as what David Simpson calls “a good dose of antiquarian history: an excess of unassimilated information.” Or it can be as ideologically shaped as Fredric Jameson’s famous mission statement: “Always historicize.” (Compare Benjamin: “Nothing that has ever happened should be regarded as lost for history” [Thesis 3]).37 In either case, making it old (not new) is the prerequisite for any critical purpose whatsoever in the age of corporatized, total innovation. 3. Free ourselves from history. As Benjamin’s angel is blown backward toward the future, he appears wholly passive in his wide-eyed witnessing\n\n/\n\n20\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nof catastrophe. It is almost as if he were shot along a wire strung from past to future, never needing to worry that there might be a fork in the path to tomorrow, never considering that there might be alternative angles from which to view yesterday, and, therefore, never needing to look back and forth between past and future to ride the storm. In recent military parlance (the comparison is at first glance jarring, but no more so than keeping an ear cocked for V1 buzz bombs in Benjamin’s own era), the angel is not just a wire-guided missile but a “fire-and-forget” smart missile. Only, in this case, the missile’s nose camera is inexplicably reversed so that it looks away from its future target toward the history that launched it. A strange smart bomb, this, whose explosion is not its target but its origin and whose security is that not of homeland but of exile. Complicating history and immersing ourselves in it, as I have recommended, are necessary first steps, but they are not by themselves adequate for critical engagement today. Also necessary is a step that will only at first seem contradictory: the strenuous (rather than facile) act of freeing ourselves from the complicated history we are immersed in or, phrased another way, of choosing ethically to be emancipated from historical context through the very act of allowing ourselves to be so fully and deeply absorbed in that context that we discern the alternative pathways between past and future emergent from its complexity. The danger, of course, is enthrallment to the past in a manner that is conservative by default (in a way that avoids the hard ethical choices made by either political conservatives or progressives). I mean by this a version of what Nietzsche termed the “abuse of history,” according to which immersion in history seems to lead to no more than a minimalist ethics of submission to the given, to that which simply, empirically, and inarguably (the greatest of all totalitarian arguments) “is.”38 One’s ethical stance reduces to obeisance to reality. More strongly, one’s stance reduces to what I term in chapter 9 enslavement to history (a reference to a specific context). Either we in the present become a facsimile of the historical them (as in modern political movements that have proceeded on the assumption of an unending American, French, Russian, or Chinese Revolution), or they in history become ghost projections of the modern us (as in business books that take historical leaders as types of the CEO).39 Put in terms of causality rather than resemblance: either the present is determined by a history set in motion by the entirety of past context, or, inversely, the past is committed to a teleology of history whose outcome is the present. Of course, the tightest chains of such historical determinism conform to strictly linear relations between past and present. But complex, rhizomatic historical contexts of the sort I sketched above can create even more op-\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n21\n\n/\n\npressive, hegemonic determinisms—like being tied down by a thousand fine chains. Context is enormously sticky. Therefore, any contemporary use of history to critique culture needs not just to be immersive but also to imagine how culture can escape history by activating the potential for emancipation seeded within, but not without ethical choice able to emerge from, the complexity of the past. Among all the rich bifurcation points of history, where are the avenues that suggest alternative ways of thinking about the past and the future? Which is the way, or ways, to a future that can come into its own unchained from the forceful illusion, called reality, that there must always have been one past whose multifarious parts are locked together in a symphony of catastrophe? In one way or another, in short, contemporary historicism must imagine nonlinear history in a manner that exceeds the escapist fantasies of both popular historical entertainments and jingoistic freedom movements on all sides of the political spectrum.40 4. Make a method. The Angelus Novus watercolor that inspired Benjamin’s Thesis 9 shows its angel frontally so that we do not see what he fl inches away from, only that his eyes are turned askance, to his left, as if he were not just shying, but looking, away—a Laocöon of the shifty glance rather than uprolled eyes (see figure 0.1 above). But there is also another kind of looking away in the painting: the distinctively postimpressionist, postcubist, and postexpressionist style through which Klee, in the now-classic method of modern painting, shifts our gaze away from the representational subject to the play of the medium itself on the plane of the picture surface. Such is one of the methods by which modernity—as also attested, for example, by Picasso’s Guernica (1937) or the anti-“Northern” irony of the New Critical formalists—at once immersed itself in history and freed itself from history.41 The moderns, I think, pointed the way. How can contemporary historicism at once acknowledge the condition of being bound to history and claim another sense of “conditionality” (as when we say that something is conditional) able to open a space of freedom from/in history— the necessary paradox of any critical historicism? After the original, nineteenth-century moment of historicism, the answer was to play up the antithetical, ironic, or otherwise difference-making component of Hegelian method. As Joel Fineman remarks: “We can say . . . that it has been the project of post-Hegelian philosophy, insofar as it remains Hegelian, and concerned therefore with history, to find some way to introduce into the ahistorical historicality of Hegelian philosophy of history some break or interruption of the fullness and repletion of the Spirit’s self-reflection, so as thereby to introduce to history the temporality of time.”42 This post-\n\n/\n\n22\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nHegelian project later descended into twentieth-century method specifically as a breakaway concept of method itself. The central modern critical concept, we may say, was a method (any method) able to insist both that the modern us rigorously acknowledge its relation to the historical them and that it break away on its own. Like some cubist, expressionist, or abstract expressionist style, method itself served as the emancipatory cutout between us and them. In the first chapter of this book (chronologically the first essay I wrote on cultural criticism), I sketch the underlying rationale of such breakaway method as follows: Code the identification between us and them into our interviewing procedure (by making method harbor an interior otherness, a will to estrange its own most comfortable assumptions), and the identification between them and us will no longer be quite so naked. When they are in our method, then—as in the moment of tragic recognition—the realization that man is finally man and we only who we are (the tautological statement of historicism) will be redeemed by a detachment akin to that once signed by the deus ex machina. This is why my choice of exempla (“I am that I am”) and, perhaps, very tone intimate that historical understanding is bound to forms of interpretation seeming as inevitable as the gods or fate. There is a Hermes in hermeneutics: it is precisely the sense that we are being led by a method of understanding as puzzling, inconsistent, and alien as any historical other (from the viewpoint of single explanatory models) that saves our knowledge of the past from too immediate an act of identification. (49)\n\nI can now expand on this summary statement in the following way. On the one hand, clearly, method is good for creating a sense that we are not free to interpret history just any old way. Method implies subjection to the real of the past according to some system of discovery, validation, and interpretation that answers to the real both empirically and normatively (constructively) by incorporating within itself some of the a priori givenness of the real. Yet, on the other hand, such latter construction, when fully developed, acquires an autonomy, not only registering, but also offsetting or displacing the found truth of history. From a fundamentalist perspective, that displacement is toward some apparently more transcendental reality. Method has thus been used to elevate the real of history to the fuller reality of theology, idealism, materialism, or any other big picture that shows us we need to conform to a metahistory beyond the known scope and mandate of history. But, from a more latitudinarian perspective, method\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n23\n\n/\n\ndisplaces us not so much toward some other reality as—the logical kernel here—toward the sense of otherness itself. At this core level, prior to any proposition about ultimate origins or goals, the only thing that registers is a break in the tight, clenched little history of our selves; and the most accurate statement of that break is a method (like a grammar or a syntax we would ourselves not naturally speak) that enacts a certain alienation or remove from ourselves. After all, from Descartes’s Discourse on Method (1637) at the onset of the Enlightenment on, method (and, even more so, theory) has had the reputation of being disembodied, inorganic, abstract, technical, or alien—the opposite of organically rooted, organic, or intuitive. But good method, we may say, applies conceptual alienation for a critical, rather than merely technical, purpose. It dedicates modernity to seeking a history that can be other than it is. 5. Mediate our method. But it is not on modern method itself that I would conclude. The postmodern supplement to the modern critical concept is a method that might free the contemporary us from the historical them in a manner buffered from the severity of modern method itself. Again I take my cue from formal innovation in the Benjamin passage quoted above. The experimentalism of the Klee painting on which Benjamin meditates, of course, is matched by the formal innovation of Benjamin’s writing itself in the overall “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” which mixes and matches the aphoristic style of the German romantic philosophers, the manifesto style of the early modernists (e.g., Victor Shklovsky’s “Art as Technique”), and the hypothesis style of the scientists that modernist poets ironized (as in the paradoxical formula in Archibald MacLeish’s “Ars Poetica”: “A poem should be equal to: / Not true”).43 Or, to recur to my earlier mention of modernist media innovations, perhaps formal innovation in my present vocabulary is too stilted a concept. Media innovation instead may be the key to seeing how modernism has passed on its experimental method to postmodernism in a manner allowing us now both to bind ourselves to historical context and—in a manner more complete than modernism itself—to free ourselves from it. I can best articulate this position by offering a fresh defense of the New Historicist anecdote as it has emerged into prominence in controversies about postmodern historicism (especially, but not exclusively, in regard to the New Historicism). Or, better, since both the reductive charge of being “just anecdotal” and rebuttals against such charges have now been well rehearsed, I will defend the broader paradigm that links the postmodern-historicist anecdote to such past innovations in the romantic-modern-postmodern genealogy I sketch as the Wordsworthian spot of time or the formalist close reading. For convenience, we can call\n\n/\n\n24\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nthis broader paradigm the method of bubble universes. We can start by taking a page from Fineman’s well-known essay reflecting on the anecdote: “In formal terms, my thesis is the following: that the anecdote is the literary form that uniquely lets history happen by virtue of the way it introduces an opening into the teleological, and therefore timeless, narration of beginning, middle, and end. The anecdote produces the effect of the real, the occurrence of contingency, by establishing an event as an event within and yet without the framing context of historical successivity, i.e., it does so only in so far as its narrative both comprises and refracts the narration it reports.”44 Continuing in psychoanalytic terms, Fineman speaks of the anecdote as a paradoxical “orifice” set inside, but also issuing outside, history (an “opening of history . . . the hole and rim—using psychoanalytic language, the orifice—traced out . . . within the totalizing whole of history”).45 In short, the anecdotes or other microhistories that populate the work of the New Historicists, the New Cultural Historians, and so on are bubble universes at once contained in historical reality and admitting of freedom from that reality.46 My own approach to the problem is to complement Fineman’s psychoanalytic framework with that of media analysis, which would start by noticing the unacknowledged elephant in the little room of the anecdote: before it is a method, the anecdote (derived from oral culture, the postMontaigne essay, the vignette, journalistic print culture, the electronic sound bite, and, more recently, the Internet blog post, etc.) is a media form. Or, more strongly, the anecdote can be a method precisely because it is now an advanced, historically layered media form. Consider that the various postmodern historicisms have been acutely attuned to history as a medium of representations, symbols, interpretations, and so on. My hypothesis is that there is a link between such an understanding of history as a set of semiautonomous, “subversive,” or never fully governable representational forms hosted in artifacts, arts, language, and other cultural substrates—media in my usage here—and the media form of the anecdote itself as it has become one of postmodern historicism’s own signature acts of representation. Such recursion of past media in present media is a method for at once receiving the force of historical determination as causality and mediating such causality as a communication between past and present that is undecidably both performative and symbolic, both determined by history and free enough from strict conditioning (via unpredictable, two-way feedback modulations between past and present media) to allow us to imagine other avenues of possibility leading from the complexity of the past to that of the future. In short, postmodern historicism introduces the thought of mediation\n\nContingent Methods\n\n/\n\n25\n\n/\n\nin the relation of past to future. My culminating recommendation, therefore, is that postmodern historicism can best do so by visibly signaling the act of such mediation through actual media innovation or allusions to such innovation in its own form, thereby methodically bringing to view a sense of simultaneous sameness and otherness in our relation to history. Or, more carefully, lest we fall into the trap of innovation über alles on which I commented at the start of this introduction, let us say instead that media innovation of the sort I indicate is really any mediation that produces a sense of anachronism (residual or emergent, in Raymond Williams’s vocabulary) able to make us see history as a compound relation of proximity and distance between past and present. Readable either as regression to oral storytelling or progression to electronic age sound bites or blog posts, the anecdote is barely the beginning of such possible selfaware media innovation. It’s like holding a microphone up to the far past: a way of committing ourselves to hearing the past but, through the conscious election of a media paradigm from a different era, also of holding open the possibility of freedom from the past. Bubble universes of history, that is, are necessarily shaped through the “orifices” of lenses, microphones, screens, and sundry other instruments of mediation that, via the act of mediation itself, register the paradox of immersive freedom from history constitutive of contingency. Only through such mediation, it may be posited, can cultural criticism today engage critically with, rather than merely mirror, the general phenomenon of contemporary postmodern historicism. Moreover, it may be suggested that, in the near future, cultural criticism will indeed need to experiment with its actual media to address meaningfully a postmodern historicism that, as in the case of so-called Web 2.0, is both highly socially aware and—as attested by blog archives that vainly try to give an afterlife to dynamic, contingent postings ceaselessly rolling out of sight— in need of historical awareness. For the present, however, this book of essays still hews to the media forms of book and essay, but with a strong tendency to thematize and/ or allude to media anachronisms of the sort theorized above. Thus, in chapter 1 (“The Power of Formalism: The New Historicism”), I adopt a variety of media metaphors—Fellini’s cinema, Wölffl in’s slide projectors, photography—to sketch the dialectic I term the governing line and the disturbed array. Chapter 2 (“Trying Cultural Criticism: Wordsworth and Subversion”) adopts the framing paradigm of the legal trial with its exhibits of evidence. Chapter 3 (“Local Transcendence: Cultural Criticism, Postmodernism, and the Romanticism of Detail”) begins by imagining Wordsworth at a personal computer, goes on to present a matrix\n\n/\n\n26\n\n/\n\nIntroduction\n\nwith multiple “channels” from postmodern cultural criticism, and at last meditates on the “cybernetic, televisionary, rhapsodic” way in which such criticism projects its “version of romantic nature: a screen” (137). Chapter 4 (“Remembering the Spruce Goose: Historicism, Postmodernism, Romanticism”) extends the media paradigm, enacting in its own form the media exhibits, simulations, and screens that constitute its object of study (the Spruce Goose exhibit then in Long Beach, California). And so the tactic of self-aware media paradigms continues through most of the succeeding chapters—for example, chapter 5 (“The New Historicism and the Work of Mourning”), with its introductory, explicitly postmodern depiction of Wordsworth’s dead brother as a kind of found-object collage or “body/plank/sand assemblage,” or chapter 6 (“The Interdisciplinary War Machine”), which concludes with a conjecture on the incommensurable, unpresentable relation between the “interdisciplinary” and the “intermediated” (not to mention new media). The culmination of this method then comes in the final three chapters, where I reflect specifically on the link—at once bound and free, determinative and contingent—that runs between older methods of understanding history and contemporary information media. Chapter 7 (“Sidney’s Technology: A Critique by Technology of Literary History”) adopts the paradigms of modern and postmodern communication systems (from the telephone to the Internet) to critique historical method in a manner whose anachronism I explicitly justify. Chapter 8 (“Transcendental Data: Toward a Cultural History and Aesthetics of the New Encoded Discourse”) borrows the form of XML encoding to title the sections of its argument about the relation between recent text-encoding and database practices and early-twentieth-century work regimes and office media. And chapter 9 (“Escaping History: The New Historicism, Databases, and Contingency”) explores the strange, cross-historical link between abolition as Charles Babbage thought about it at the time of his Analytical Engine and our own “information wants to be free” era of random access and relational databases.

CLAUDE LÉVI- STRAUSS, STRUCTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY\n\n1/ The Power of Formalism The New Historicism\n\nWhy Not?\n\nTo understand the New Historicism, it will be useful to start by considering the version of rhetorical exordium the method uses to place its argument in play. Just as Sidney solicits his audience in the Apology for Poetry by beginning on the anecdote of Pugliano’s horsemanship, so Stephen Greenblatt and others—to quote Jean E. Howard’s early criticism of the technique—broach their argument through “painstaking description of a particular historical event, place, or experience” whose “supposedly paradigmatic moment” sketches “a cultural law.”1 So thoroughgoing is such paradigmatism that exordium is convertible with digressio: even when a New Historicist study internalizes a paradigm as its centerpiece rather than its opening, the paradigm retains a throwaway quality. Serendipitous and adventitious—always\n\n/\n\n30\n\n/\n\nChapter One\n\nmerely found, always merely picked up—these models compose a bricolage substituting for what was once the more methodical narratio or presentation of facts in the history of ideas: the recording of such master paradigms, for example, as the chain of being, the mirror, and the lamp. Where the history of ideas straightened world pictures, Elizabethan or otherwise, New Historicism hangs them anew—seemingly by accident, off any hook, at any angle.2 It not only cherishes paradigms thematizing obliqueness, as in Greenblatt’s anamorphic reading of Holbein’s Ambassadors in Renaissance Self-Fashioning,3 but also speaks those paradigms in a vocabulary of anecdotal virtuosity so oblique—itself tending at times to anamorphosis, paradox, oxymoron, and chiasmus—that the result is a kind of intellectual sprezzatura.4 To allude to the structuralist strain in the ancestry of the method, the paradigms of the New Historicism bare a shy rashness, a supremely cavalier why not? assertive of their marginality. It is my thesis that the why not? of the New Historicism serves primarily to repress the urgency of its real questions about literature and history and that the reason the repression is necessary is that the urgency of these questions is motivated not by curiosity about literature and history in the past so much as by deep embarrassment about the marginality of literary history now. For what most distinguishes the New Historicism may be read in the brash nervousness with which it wears its title in an intellectual climate commonly prefixed post-. As I will suggest, the spurious, avant-garde novelty of the method (in which my own early work has been as implicated as any) is really a rearguard action spurred by the postmodern fear that, in the face of history, literary history or any such mere show of intellect is passé. I want to trace a trajectory, then, from the why not? of the New Historicism to a why that will allow us to set an agenda for understanding the method’s anxiety of marginality. And to begin with (assuming here a barker’s voice in advance of future argument): view the carnival of New Historicist paradigms; see the sideshows of the overparadigm I will call— why not?—the contest of the governing line and the disturbed array.5 Imagine Charles I seated at a court play—at the masque-like Florimène in 1635, for example, as Stephen Orgel has reconstructed the scene. Centered in conspicuous visibility amid the audience, who occupy seats along three walls facing him, he sees along the exact medial axis of the hall directly into Inigo Jones’s stage with its strongly illusionistic perspective effects— into the recessional avenue between trees and cottages, for instance, hung in the opening scene (figures 1.1–1.3). King and vanishing point: the apexes of royal presence and representation rule the universe between them.6\n\nFigure 1.1. Florimène: plan of the stage and hall, ca. 1635.

Unknown artist, Cardinal Richelieu Entertains the King and Queen in the Theatre of the Palais Cardinal. Used comparatively by Orgel to illustrate the centrality of the monarch’s viewing position at the time of Florimène (“The Royal Theatre and the Role of the King,” 265–66).\n\nThis scene visualizes one of the two leading paradigms of New Historicist poetics: a “cultural poetics,” as Greenblatt names it, whose donnée of interpretation is neither the historical nor the literary fact but the feigned, illusional, or otherwise made structure of the cultural artifact encompassing both realms.7 The paradigm is that of theatricality, which in Renaissance studies and its romantics counterpart (the latter increasingly infl uenced by French Revolution studies) starts in the actual theater but then aggressively spills out of doors to make mise-en-scène, social drama, playfulness, improvisation, rehearsal, tragedy, and illusion the master tropes of culture.8 With the possible exception of Greenblatt’s study of self-made Renaissance men, theatricality has been used primarily to model the mentalité of monarch-centered aristocracy or its overthrow—the experience of the Elizabethan and Stuart court theater as recounted by Orgel, for example, or that of the court spectacle (in another sense) registered by Marie-Hélène Huet at the trial of Louis XVI.9 As in the case of New Historicist paradigms generally, theatricality models power.10 Power, especially in Renaissance studies, designates the\n\nThe Power of Formalism\n\n/\n\n33\n\n/\n\nFigure 1.3.

But the regulated state, we should immediately note, is so far from being monolithic that at every level its distinguishing feature is inner dynamism—a self-tensed, internecine action of power. The New Historicism imagines an existentially precarious power secured on the incipient civil war between, on the one hand, cultural plurality and, on the other (to borrow an apt term from Russian Formalism), the cultural dominant able to bind plurality within structure.11 Theatricality in particular is the paradigm that stresses the slender control of dominance over plurality. Thus it is that Orgel observes the plural jostle for court rank and ambassadorial privilege in the seating arrangements at Florimène and that Huet reconstructs the multitudinous vivacity, inebriation, and sometimes plain boredom that sounded from the spectators at Louis’s trial in 1793.12 But thus it is also that both authors stress the ability of the dominant, in the person of Charles or Louis, to structure plurality into the show of a single state. Throned at the only point in the room perfect for viewing the per-\n\n/\n\n34\n\n/\n\nChapter One\n\nspective effects, Charles literally ruled: his being-seen-to-watch-the-show, as Orgel conceives it,13 organized aristocracy around a single line of perfect vision, a single symbolic rule allowing each participant in the masque universe to calibrate his place near or far, to the right or the left of the royal lineage.14 Just so Louis XVI, even as he was dethroned, commanded all eyes in his spectacle-court as powerfully as some Richard II asking for a mirror. The theatricality that once maintained the illusion of a king was now the perfect mirror of magistrates to disillusion another king—but in such a way as still to maintain around the king’s lineage the symmetry of right and left (those who voted no and yes to Louis’s death) that was constitutive of ruled state. Only when the king had played his last performance, as Huet shows, did the Revolution then propagate plays about Marat and other heroes showing anew the people’s rule. Charles and Louis, illusion and disillusion: these two states and their actors, we realize, are finally as indistinguishable in the analytic of theatricality as the two halves of the anamorphic answer Richard II returns to Bolingbroke in Shakespeare’s deposition scene: “Ay, no; no, ay.”15 Once we premise the theatricality of all culture and enter the bottomless spectatorship of New Historicist consciousness, we know that any cultural backdrop, at any time, can turn into its inversion as easily as some Inigo Jones machina versatilis (turning machine) opening up a new scene. Every facade is merely the reversal or repetition of a previous facade. A double paradigm conflating the Stuart and Bourbon, English and French revolutionary scenes comes to mind. As reported with special emphasis in the London press, Louis in his last days took care to read the “account of the death of Charles the First.”16 What Louis-as-actor read, we can imagine, was the script for a prior drama foreshadowing his own—a script, as Patricia Fumerton’s researches suggest, that Charles himself performed in an uncanny reenactment of an even earlier theater of act. With high sense of drama, Charles went to his death almost exactly as he would have gone to a masque—through the same sequence of rooms in the Banqueting House at Whitehall, through a window in the hall where masques were performed, and at last out onto the stage of the blade where he enacted a scene of death so self-controlled and riveting that it can truly be said to have been a command performance.17 Just so, as I have recounted in Wordsworth: The Sense of History, Louis rose to the occasion on his own platform of the guillotine, giving a command performance so self-possessed, devout, and potentially subversive of the new state that the managers of the carefully staged event ordered a drumroll silencing his soliloquy.18 Playwithin-a-play: in the endlessly receding playhouse that is New Historicist\n\nThe Power of Formalism\n\n/\n\n35\n\n/\n\nFigure 1.4. “Plan of Penshurst Place showing various stages of construction and the present disposition of rooms open to visitors.

Finality is only the possibility of theatrical revival, cultural determination a casting call for future improvisation. Again, imagine visiting Penshurst Place. As explored in Don E. Wayne’s Penshurst, the core of the building consists of a fourteenth-century manor house with its Baron’s or Great Hall, while the later additions of the Sidney family sprawl outward—but in such a way as to feign seamlessness (figure 1.4). Looking through the newer main entrance at the north, we sight down the perspective recession created by a vista of arches: first the entrance span, then the arch of the service passage through the manor house, and, finally, the arched aperture of the newer Garden Tower toward\n\n/\n\n36\n\n/\n\nChapter One\n\nFigure 1.5. “Penshurst Place. Perspective of arches (King’s Tower—Great Hall—Garden Tower) viewed through the open doors of the main entrance at the North Front.” Discussed (with above caption) in Wayne, Penshurst, 85, 91.\n\nthe south (figure 1.5).19 Fore-, middle, and background planes frame visual space within a box of time measured with the typological certainty of a Fra Angelico Annunciation (in which recessed planes showing the Garden situate Mary’s humiliatio within the longest vista of human history).20 The eye’s walk into Penshurst’s manorial past has all the stateliness of procession: we are humbled before a history seen in ceremonial review. Such is a visualization of the architectural and what might be called inventorial paradigm characterizing not just Wayne’s intriguing book but also such other inquiries as Jonathan Goldberg’s study of the triumphal arches ushering James I into London, Catherine Belsey’s sketch of split representation in Felbrigg Hall, Fumerton’s work on Whitehall Palace and Renaissance miniature cabinets, and Steven Mullaney’s look into Renais-\n\nThe Power of Formalism\n\n/\n\n37\n\n/\n\nsance wonder cabinets.21 Again, the project is to reconstruct the mentality of monarch-centered power—here concretized in the organization of a house or monument, the successive experience of rooms within a house, or, within rooms themselves, such interior galleries as the wonder or miniature cabinet. And, once more, such space projects a ruling line able to dominate plurality. Even as other courtiers talked business in Elizabeth I’s innermost bedchamber, Fumerton shows, Elizabeth was able to maintain the illusion that she was taking the ambassador from Mary Queen of Scots ever inward into her confidence: down the labyrinthine line of her apartments at Whitehall, into her bedchamber, into her miniature cabinet, through the wrappings of her miniature portraits (in this case of the Earl of Leicester and of Mary), through the layered aesthetics of these images of putative dear ones, and at last into the aura of feminine intimacy that was one with her politics of virginal rule.22 Division of state became a communion of confidantes over the heart’s secrets. Just so, Wayne argues, cultural plurality at Penshurst was aligned through a strategem analogous to the ruling line of vision at a masque or the subtler Ariadnean threading of Elizabeth’s architecture. How to imagine continuity where there was discontinuity (between the baronial legitimacy of the manor house and the additions of the Sidney clan representing the new court-oriented aristocracy)? One lineage where there were two? The answer, as Wayne compellingly demonstrates, lay in creating the special perspective on history that we have reviewed: the recession that laminated the baronial Great Hall between fore- and far planes of aristocratic veneer. Thus was an image created that, reinforced by the effect of other architectural and heraldic devices, authored the vision of a single descent of greatness. Like the ambassador entering Elizabeth’s bedchamber, a visitor proceeding to the central hall stepped into an aura of familiarity, into the very hearth warmth of a mythic family of long possession. Once more, imagine viewing the cells in the rotunda of Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon prison from the central inspection tower—perhaps from the visitor’s gallery that Bentham left room for in his plans. Specifically, envisage this panorama of reform in the manner of John Bender’s Imagining the Penitentiary: as the demonstration of the eye’s omniscience while it inspects with narratological power the scene of character development (figure 1.6).23 Or, again, to create a strange sympathy of sights, imagine touring the then-celebrated Lower Rydal Falls in the English Lake District—as described, for example, by Wordsworth in his An Evening Walk, where the falls provide the leading exemplum of landscape. As I have argued in discussing\n\n/\n\n38\n\n/\n\nChapter One\n\nFigure 1.6. Jeremy Bentham, Samuel Bentham, and Willey Reveley, Penitentiary Panopticon (1791). Discussed by John Bender in Imagining the Penitentiary, 23–24.\n\nthe picturesque in my Wordsworth: The Sense of History, Lower Rydal Falls naturalizes in its central perspective recession and perfectly reposed bridge in the middle distance a certain kind of supervision, regulation, and rule of landscape (figure 1.7). Not a glimpse of proportion or poise but declares the surveillance of picturesque irregularity by an enclosing, correcting, and governing eye.24 There are two paradigms represented here, of course, but we can hang them together to highlight what might be called, very broadly, the middleclassing of the New Historicism—the imperative, especially in studies of the eighteenth century and its aftermath, to mold the shaping models of the method to the bourgeois and its ascendant forms: the novel, preeminently, but also the poetry (and prose) of description that foreshadowed romantic lyric. The two paradigms are the prison and the recreational tour (the latter modernizes a supplementary paradigm of Renaissance stud-\n\nThe Power of Formalism\n\n/\n\n39\n\n/\n\nies, the monarch’s progress and entry pageant).25 Seen in overview, the common project of these paradigms is to conceive a shift in power from aristocracy and monarchical rule to the middle classes and the rule of the individualistic self. Once more, the picture of power forms around a line dominating plurality. Meditating such penitentiary projects as Bentham’s Panopticon, Bender arrives at the thesis that it was, in part, the novel (often explicitly concerned with penal themes) that shaped the assumptions about human character necessary to imagine the new prison. Novelistic narrative and the mentality it expressed, that is, helped inculcate the notions of individual consciousness, character development, and the reformatory power of the spectator that gave later-eighteenth-century prisons their object of reform. We—you and I—novel reader, are the inspector at the center of Bentham’s prison able to see along the pitiless, radial axis of the Panopticon into each cell of murderous, larcenous, or otherwise plural human character. Misrule is submitted to the rule of omniscience. Or, again, to escape from prison to my own paradigm, we—the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century tourist—rule a British landscape of plural “variety.” But perhaps we have not truly escaped prison after all. As signaled by Bentham’s own description of his scene of reform as “pictur-\n\nFigure 1.7.

Sighting down the “visto of the brook” at Lower Rydal Falls, for example (which we may also see displayed graphically in innumerable contemporary pictures), our eye rules irregularity according to a perspective that was also political. The picturesque was liberalism. It was the nation of freedom that Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price propagated with such Foxite Whiggishness that the public linked their theories outright to the Jacobinism of the French Revolution. Like the French Revolution in the early liberal view, that is, nature was “free” and “bold,” but hopefully never too free or bold. It was captured in especially arresting views that framed any too-licentious or -“violent” irregularities in a sort of checks and balances or constitution of nature: repose (one of the most common of picturesque epithets). So too the picturesque was social structure. As attested by Knight’s and Price’s persistent concern with ownership, nature in repose wedded liberality to security by imagining a nation of exchange-\n\nThe Power of Formalism\n\n/\n\n41\n\n/\n\nable property. Or, where the tourist was not himself a large property owner like Knight and Price, he had to be able (in William Gilpin’s phrase) to “appropriate” the imaginary property of such splendidly waste—that is, largely unowned—scenes as the Lake District. The picturesque was the enclosure act of the eye. Perhaps now we can see why Wordsworth would soon become so unhappy with the picturesque eye that, in The Prelude (11.170–79), he likens it to “despotic” “tyranny.” Consider that Lower Rydal Falls was situated on the estate of Sir Michael Le Fleming—a property owner who, as Wordsworth and Coleridge found out the hard way, took strict measures with trespassers. The picture-perfect scene could be seen only by permission— from a viewing enclosure (a small summerhouse at Rydal Hall) specifically designed to frame it through a window, along the perspective recession, as if in a picture (figure 1.8).27 The famously sharawaggian plurality and liberty of picturesque experience thus came under the rule of a central eye not unlike Bentham’s inspector. Finally, imagine the interior of the Rotunda at Ranelagh as glimpsed (through Canaletto’s picture of 1754) in Terry Castle’s Masquerade and Civilization (figure 1.9).
