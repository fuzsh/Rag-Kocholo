THE REVIVAL OF NARRATIVE: SOME COMMENTS LAWRENCE STONE BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A REVIVALOF \"NARRATIVE history\" because there has been a decline in the history devoted to asking \"the big why questions\", the generalizing \"scientific history\". This in turn he thinks is due to disillusionment with the essentially economic determinist models of historical explanation, Marxist or otherwise, which have tended to dominate in the post-war years; to the declining ideological commitment of western intellectuals; con- temporary experience which has reminded us that political action and decision can shape history; and the failure of \"quantitative history\" (another claimant to \"scientific\" status) to deliver the goods.' Two questions are involved in this argument, which I have brutally over- simplified: what has been happening in historiography, and how are these developments to be explained?Since it is common ground that in history \"the facts\" are always selected, shaped and perhaps distorted by the historian who observes them, there is an element ofpartipris, not to say intellectual autobiography, in Stone's treatment of both questions, as in my comments on it. I think we may accept that the twenty years following the Second World War saw a sharp decline in political and religious history, in the use of \"ideas\" as an explanation of history, and a remarkable turn to socio-economic history and to historical explanation in terms of \"social forces\", as Momigliano noted as early as i954.2 Whether or not we call them \"economic-determinist\", these currents of hist- oriography became influential, in some cases dominant, in the main western centres of historiography, not to mention, for other reasons, the eastern ones. We may also accept that in recent years there has been considerable diversification, and a marked revival of interest in themes which were rather more marginal to the main concerns of the historical outsiders who in those years became historical insiders, though such themes were never neglected. After all, Braudel wrote about Philip II as well as the Mediterranean, and Le Roy Ladurie's monograph on Le carnaval de Romans of 1580 is anticipated by a much briefer, but most perceptive, account of the same episode in his Les paysans du Languedoc.3 If Marxist historians of the 1970S write 1 Lawrence Stone, \"The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History\", Past and Present, no. 85 (Nov. 1979), pp. 3-24. 2 Arnaldo Momigliano, \"A Hundred Years after Ranke\", in his Studies in Historiography (London, 1966), pp. 108-9. 3 Fernand Braudel, La Mediterranee et le monde mediterraneen d l'epoque de Philippe II (Paris, 1960); Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Le carnaval de Romans (Paris, 1979); Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Les paysans du Languedoc, 2 vols.

Whether this amounts to a revival of\"narrative history\" as defined by Stone (basically chronological ordering of the material in \"a single coherent story, albeit with sub-plots\" and a concentration \"on man not circumstances\") is difficult to determine, since Stone deliberately eschews a quantitative survey and concentrates on \"a very tiny, but disproportionatelyprominent, section of the historical profession as a whole\".5 Nevertheless there is evidence that the old historical avant- garde no longer rejects, despises and combats the old-fashioned \"history of events\" or even biographical history, as some of it used to. Fernand Braudel himself has given unstinted praise to a notably traditional exercise in popular narrative history, Claude Manceron's attempt to present the origins of the French Revolution through a series of overlapping biographies of contemporaries,great and small.6 On the other hand the historical minority whose supposedly changed interests Stone surveys, has not in fact changed over to practising narrative history. If we leave aside deliberate historiographical con- servatives or neo-conservatives such as the British \"antiquarian empiricists\", there is very little simple narrative history among the works Stone cites or refers to. For almost all of them the event, the in- dividual, even the recapture of some mood or way of thinking of the past, are not ends in themselves, but the means of illuminating some wider question, which goes far beyond the particular story and its characters. In short those historians who continue to believe in the possibility of generalizing about human societies and their development, continue to be interested in \"the big why questions\", though they may some- times focus on different ones from those on which they concentrated twenty or thirty years ago. There is really no evidence that such historians - the ones Stone is mainly concerned with - have abandoned \"the attempt to produce a coherent... explanation of change in the past\".7 Whether they (or we) also regard their attempt as \"scientific\"will no doubt depend on our definition of \"science\", but we need not enter this dispute about labels. Moreover I very much doubt whether such historians feel that they are \"forcedback upon the 4 Christopher Hill, \"The Norman Yoke\", in John Saville (ed.), Democracy and the Labour Movement: Essays in Honour of Dona Torr (London, 1954), repr. in Chris- topher Hill, Puritanism and Revolution: Studies in Interpretation of the English Revolution of the i7th Century (London, 1958), pp. 50- 22. 5 Stone, op. cit., pp. 3, 4. 6 Fernand Braudel, \"Une parfaite reussite\" [review of Claude Manceron, La Revolution qui leve, I785-I787 (Paris, 1979)], L'histoire, no. 21 (1980), pp. o18-9. 7 Stone, op. cit., p. 19.\n\n4. THE REVIVAL OF NARRATIVE 5 principle of indeterminacy\",8 any more than Marx felt his writings about Louis Napoleon to be incompatible with the materialist concep- tion of history. No doubt there are historians who have abandoned such attempts, and certainly there are some who combat them, perhaps with a zeal increased by ideological commitment. (Whether or not Marxism has declined intellectually, it is hard to detect much muting of ideological controversy among western historians, though the participants and the specific issues may not be the same as twenty years ago.) Probably neo-conservative history has gained ground, at any rate in Britain, both in the form of the \"young antiquarian empiricists\" who \"write detailed political narratives which implicitly deny that there is any deep-seatedmeaning to history except the accidental whims of fortune and personality\",9 and in the form of works like Theodore Zeldin's (and Richard Cobb's) remarkableplunges into those strata of the past, to which \"almost every aspect of traditionalist history\" is irrelevant, including the answering of questions.10So, probably, has what might be called anti-intellectual leftist history. But this, except very tan- gentially, is not what Stone is concerned with. How then are we to account for the shifts in historical subject- matter and interests, in so far as they have occurred or are occurring? One element in them, it may be suggested, reflects the remarkable widening of the field of history in the past twenty years, typified by the rise of \"social history\", that shapeless container for everything from changes in human physique to symbol and ritual, and above all for the lives of all people from beggars to emperors.As Braudel has observed, this \"histoire obscure de tout le monde\" is \"the history towards which, in different ways, all historiography tends at present\".\" This is not the place to speculate on the reasons for this vast extension of the field, which certainly does not necessarily conflict with the attempt to produce a coherent explanation of the past. It does, however, increase the technical difficulty of writing history. How are these complexities to be presented? It is not surprising that historians experiment with different forms of such presentation, including notably those that borrow from the ancient techniques of literature (which has made its own stabs at displaying la comedie humaine), and also from the modern audio-visual media, in which all but the oldest of us are saturated. What Stone calls the pointilliste techniques are, at least in part, attempts to solve such technical problems of presentation. Such experiments are particularly necessary for that part of history 8 Ibid., p. 13. 9 Ibid., p. 20. 10 Theodore Zeldin, France, 1848-I945, 2 vols. (Oxford History of Modern Europe ser., Oxford, 1973-7), trans. as Histoire des passionsfrancaises (Paris, 1978); Richard Cobb, Death in Paris (Oxford, 1978). 11Braudel, \"Une parfaite reussite\", p. 109.\n\n5. 6 PAST AND PRESENT NUMBER 86 which cannot be subsumed under \"analysis\" (or the rejection of analysis) and which Stone rather neglects, namely synthesis. The problem of fitting together the various manifestations of human thought and action at a specific period is neither new nor unrecog- nized. No history of Jacobean England is satisfactory which omits Bacon or treats him exclusively as a lawyer, a politician, or a figure in the history of science or of literature. Moreover even the most con- ventional historians recognize it, even when their solutions (a chapter or two on science, literature, education or whatnot appended to the main body of politico-institutional text) is unsatisfactory. Yet the wider the range of human activities which is accepted as the legitimate concern of the historian, the more clearly understood the necessity of establishing systematic connections between them, the greater the difficulty of achieving a synthesis. This is, naturally, far more than a technical problem of presentation, yet it is that also. Even those who continue to be guided in their analysis by something like the \"three- tiered hierarchical\" model of base and superstructures which Stone rejects,'2 may find it an inadequate guide to presentation, though probably a less inadequate guide than straight chronological narra- tive. Leaving aside the problemsof presentation and synthesis, two more substantial reasons for a change may also be suggested. The first is the very success of the \"new historians\" in the post-wardecades. This was achieved by a deliberate methodological simplification, the concentra- tion on what were seen as the socio-economic base and determinants of history, at the expense of - sometimes, as in the French battle against the \"history of events\", in direct confrontation with - tradi- tional narrative history. While there were some extreme econo- mic reductionists, and others who dismissed people and events as negligible ripples on the longue duree of structure and conjoncture, such extremism was not universally shared either in Annales, or among the Marxists who - especially in Britain - never lost interest in events or culture, nor regarded \"superstructure\" as always and entirely dependenton \"base\". Yet the very triumph of works like those of Braudel, Goubert and Le Roy Ladurie, which Stone underlines, not only left \"new\" historians free to concentrate on those aspects of history hitherto deliberately set aside, but advanced their place on the \"new historians\" agenda. As an eminent Annalist, Le Goff, pointed out several years ago, \"political history was gradually to return in force by borrowing the methods, spirit and theoretical approachof the very social sciences which had pushed it into the background\".'3 The new history of men and minds, ideas and events may be seen as com- 12 Stone, op. cit., pp. 7-8. 13 J. Le Goff, \"Is Politics Still the Backbone of History?\", in Felix Gilbert and Stephen R. Graubard (eds.), Historical Studies Today (New York, 1972), p. 340.\n\n6. THE REVIVAL OF NARRATIVE 7 plementing rather than as supplanting the analysis of socio-economic structures and trends. But once historians turn to such items on their agenda, they may prefer to approach their \"coherent explanation of change in the past\" as it were ecologically rather than as geologists. They may prefer to start with the study of a \"situation\" which embodies and exemplifies the stratified structure of a society but concentrates the mind on the complexities and interconnections of real history, rather than with the study of the structureitself, especially if for this they can rely partly on earlier work. This, as Stone recognizes, lies at the root of some historians' admirationfor works like Clifford Geertz's \"close reading\" of a Balinese cock-fight.'4 It implies no necessary choice between monocausality and multicausality, and certainly no conflict between a model in which some historical determinants are seen as more power- ful than others, and the recognition of interconnections, both vertical and horizontal. A \"situation\" may be a convenient point of departure, as in Ginzburg's study of popular ideology through the case of a single village atheist in the sixteenth century or a single group of Friu- lian peasants accused of witchcraft.15 These topics could also be approachedin other ways. It may be a necessarypoint of departurein other cases, as in Agulhon's beautiful study of how, at a particular time and place, French villagers converted from Catholic tradi- tionalism to militant republicanism.16 At all events, for certain purposes historians are likely to choose it as a starting-point. There is thus no necessary contradiction between Le Roy Ladurie's Les paysans du Languedoc and his Montaillou, any more than between Duby's general works on feudal society and his monograph on the battle of Bouvines, or between E. P. Thompson's The Making of the English WorkingClass and his Whigs and Hunters.'7 There is nothing new in choosing to see the world via a microscoperather than a telescope. So long as we accept that we are studying the same cosmos, the choice between microcosm and macrocosm is a matter of selecting the appropriate technique. It is significant that more historians find the microscope useful at present, but this does not necessarily mean that they reject telescopes as out of date. Even the historians of 14Clifford Geertz, \"Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cock-Fight\", in his The Interpretation of Cultures (New York, 1973). 15 Carlo Ginzburg, II formaggio e i vermi (Turin, 1976); Carlo Ginzburg, I benandanti: ricerche sulla stregoneria e sui culti agrari tra Cinquecento e Seicento (Turin, 1966). 16Maurice Agulhon, La Republique au village (Paris, 1970). 17 Le Roy Ladurie, Les paysans du Languedoc; Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Montaillou, village occitan de I294 d I324 (Paris, I976), trans.
