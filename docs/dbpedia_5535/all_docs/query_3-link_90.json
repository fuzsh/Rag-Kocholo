differences between group means and their associated procedures (such as \"variation\" among and between groups), developed by r.a. fisher. in the anova setting, the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. in its simplest form, anova provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test to more than two groups. as doing multiple two-sample t-tests would result in an increased chance of committing a statistical type i error, anovas are useful in comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for statistical significance. ==motivating example== thumb|no fit.thumb|fair fitthumb|very good fitthe analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations. a dog show provides an example. a dog show is not a random sampling of the breed: it is typically limited to dogs that are male, adult, pure-bred, and exemplary. a histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex, like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations. suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog. before we could do that, we would need to explain the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics. a successful grouping will split dogs such that a) each group has a low variance of dog weights (meaning the group is relatively homogeneous) and b) the mean of each group is distinct (if two groups have the same mean, then it isn't reasonable to conclude that the groups are, in fact, separate in any meaningful way). in the illustrations to the right, each group is identified as x1, x2, etc. in the first illustration, we divide the dogs according to the product (interaction) of two binary groupings: young vs old, and short-haired vs long-haired (thus, group 1 is young, short-haired dogs, group 2 is young, long-haired dogs, etc.). since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups (shown in blue) has a large variance, and since the means are very close across groups, grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights: knowing which group a dog is in does not allow us to make any reasonable statements as to what that dog's weight is likely to be. thus, this grouping fails to fit the distribution we are trying to explain (yellow-orange). an attempt to explain the weight

includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them. assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the technology needed to accomplish such tasks. == assistive technology and adaptive technology == the term adaptive technology is often used as the synonym for assistive technology, however, they are different terms. assistive technology refers to \"any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities\", while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non-disabled persons. in other words, \"assistive technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities,\" while adaptive technology is \"any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities.\" consequently, adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology. adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access. ==mobility impairment and wheelchairs== thumb|a typical modern battery powered chair.

its facets, anatomy is related to embryology and comparative anatomy, which itself is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny. human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine. the discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animalâs body parts using unaided eyesight. gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures, known as histology and also in the study of cells. the history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body. methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including x-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance

Ø§ÙØ·ÙØ¨) is the spanish word for mud brick, a natural building material made from sand, clay, water, and some kind of fibrous or organic material (sticks, straw, and/or manure), usually shaped into bricks using molds and dried in the sun. adobe buildings are similar to cob and rammed earth buildings, but cob and rammed earth are directly made into walls rather than bricks. these bricks were used to make pueblos in new mexico. the anasazi, hopi, and zuni peoples used this. the romanian name for this material is chirpici. for a deeper understanding of adobe, one might examine a cob building. cob, a close cousin to adobe, contains proportioned amounts of soil, clay, water, manure, and straw. this is blended, but not formed like adobe. cob is spread and piled over the home's frame and allowed to air dry for several months before habitation. adobe, then, can be described as dried bricks of cob, stacked and mortared together with more adobe mixture to create a thick wall and/or roof. adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world. compared to wooden buildings, adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their

(in less formal contexts, all three types of script may be termed alphabets.) abugidas include the extensive brahmic family of scripts of south and southeast asia. abugida as a term in linguistics was proposed by peter t. daniels in his 1990 typology of writing systems. âabugida is an ethiopian name for the geâez script, taken from four letters of that script, âÃ¤ bu gi da, in much the same way that abecedary is derived from latin a be ce de, and alphabet is derived from the names of the two first letters in the greek alphabet, alpha and beta. as daniels used the word, an abugida is in contrast with a syllabary, where letters with shared consonants or vowels show no particular resemblance to one another, and also with an alphabet proper, where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels. the term alphasyllabary was suggested for the indic scripts in 1997 by william bright, following south asian linguistic usage, to convey the idea that \"they share features of both alphabet and syllabary\".he describes this term as \"formal\", i.e., more concerned with graphic arrangement of symbols, whereas abugida was \"functional\", putting the focus on soundâsymbol correspondence. however, this is not a distinction made in the literature.william bright (2000:65â66): a matter of typology: alphasyllabaries and abugidas. in: studies in the linguistic sciences. volume 30, number 1, pages 63â71 abugidas were long considered to be syllabaries, or intermediate between syllabaries and alphabets, and the term syllabics is retained in the name of canadian aboriginal syllabics. other terms that have been used include neosyllabary ([[james-germain fÃ©\n\n[ 65426 ]\n\nAlfons_Maria_Jakob\n\nalfons maria jakob (2 july 1884, aschaffenburg/bavaria&ndash;17 october 1931, hamburg) was a german neurologist who worked in the field of neuropathology. he was born in aschaffenburg, bavaria and educated in medicine at the universities of munich, berlin, and strasbourg, where obtained his doctorate in 1908. in 1909 he commenced clinical work under the psychiatrist emil kraepelin and did laboratory work with franz nissl and alois alzheimer in munich. in 1911 he went to hamburg to work with theodor kaes and became head of the laboratory of anatomical pathology at the psychiatric state hospital hamburg-friedrichsberg. following the death of kaes in 1913, jakob succeeded him as prosector. after serving in the german army in world war i, he returned to hamburg and climbed the academic ladder. he was habilitated in neurology in 1919 and in 1924 became professor of neurology. under jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. he made notable contributions to knowledge on concussion and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of neuropathology. jakob published five monographs and more than 75 papers. his neuropathological studies contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including multiple sclerosis and friedreich's ataxia. he first recognised and described alper's disease and creutzfeldt-jakob disease (the latter with hans gerhard creutzfeldt). he accumulated experience in neurosyphilis, having a 200-bedded ward devoted exclusively to that disorder. jakob made a lecture tour of the united states and south america where he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of yellow fever. he suffered from chronic osteomyelitis for the last 7 years of his life. this eventually caused a retroperitoneal abscess and paralytic ileus from which he died following operation. ==associated eponym== * creutzfeldt-jakob disease: a very rare and incurable degenerative neurological disease. it is the most common form of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies caused by prions. ==bibliography== * die extrapyramidalen erkrankungen. in: monograph\n\n[ 12666, 19442, 217956, 218847, 218848, 343948 ]\n\nAstatine\n\nastatine is a radioactive chemical element with the chemical symbol at and atomic number 85. it occurs on earth only as the result of the radioactive decay of certain heavier elements. all of its isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. accordingly, much less is known about astatine than most other elements. the observed properties are consistent with it behaving as a heavier analog of iodine; many other properties have been estimated based on this resemblance. elemental astatine has never been viewed, because a mass large enough to be seen (by the naked human eye) would be immediately vaporized by the heat generated by its own radioactivity. astatine may be dark, or it may have a metallic appearance and be a semiconductor, or it may even be a metal. it is likely to have a much higher melting point than iodine, on par with those of bismuth and polonium. chemically, astatine behaves more or less as a halogen (the group including chlorine and fluorine), and would be expected to form ionic astatides with alkali or alkaline earth metals; it is known to form covalent compounds with nonmetals, including other halogens. it does, however, also have a notable cationic chemistry that distinguishes it from the lighter halogens. the second longest-lived isotope of astatine, astatine-211, is the only one currently having any commercial application, being employed in medicine to diagnose and treat some diseases via its emission of alpha particles (helium-4 nuclei). only extremely small quantities are used, however, due to its intense radioactivity. the element was first produced by dale r. corson, kenneth ross mackenzie, and emilio segrÃ¨ at the university of california, berkeley in 1940. they named the element \"astatine\", a name coming from the great instability of the synthesized matter (the source greek word Î±ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï (astatos) means \"unstable\"). three years later it was found in nature, although it is the least abundant element in the earth's crust among the non-transuranic elements, with a total existing amount of much less than one gram at any given time. six astatine isotopes, with mass numbers of 214 to 219, are present in nature as the products of various decay routes of heavier elements, but neither the most stable isotope of astatine (with mass number 210) nor astatine-211 (which is used in medicine) is produced naturally. ==characteristics== astatine is an extremely radioactive element;

has no solution in real numbers, even though all its coefficients (1 and 0) are real. the same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed; in particular, the field of rational numbers is not algebraically closed. also, no finite field f is algebraically closed, because if a1, a2, â¦, an are the elements of f, then the polynomial (x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;a1)(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;a2)&nbsp;Â·Â·Â·&nbsp;(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;a'n)&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 has no zero in f. by contrast, the fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed. another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of (complex) algebraic numbers. ==equivalent properties== given a field f, the assertion \"f is algebraically closed\" is equivalent to other assertions: ===the only irreducible polynomials are those of degree one=== the field f is algebraically closed if and only if the only irreducible polynomials in the polynomial ring f[x] are those of degree one. the assertion \"the polynomials of degree one are irreducible\" is trivially true for any field. if f is algebraically closed and p(x) is an irreducible polynomial of f[x], then it has some root a and therefore p(x) is a multiple of x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;a. since p(x) is irreducible, this means that p(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;k(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;a), for some k&nbsp;â&nbsp;f&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{0}. on the other hand, if f is not algebraically closed, then there is some non-constant polynomial p(x) in f[x] without roots in f. let q(x) be some irreducible factor of p(x). since p(x) has no roots in f, q(x) also has no roots in f. therefore, q(x) has degree greater than one, since every first degree polynomial has one root in f. ===every polynomial is a product of first degree polynomials=== the field f is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial p(x) of degree n&nbsp;â¥&nbsp;1, with coefficients in f, splits into linear factors. in other words, there are elements k,&nbsp;x1,&nbsp;x2,&nbsp;â¦,&nbsp;xn of the field f such\n\n[ 196628 ]\n\nAristophanes\n\naristophanes ( or ;jones, daniel;

and until the 1970s the olympic rules required that competitors be amateurs. receiving payment to participate in an event disqualified an athlete from that event, as in the case of jim thorpe. the only olympic events that still require participants to be amateurs are boxing and wrestling, but amateurism in these cases are defined in terms of fight rules rather than whether the athlete receives any money for his sport. many amateurs make valuable contributions in the field of computer programming through the open source movement. amateur dramatics is the performance of plays or musical theater, often to high standards, but lacking the budgets of professional west end or broadway performances. astronomy, history, linguistics, and the natural sciences are among the myriad fields that have benefited from the activities of amateurs. charles darwin and gregor mendel were amateur scientists who never held a position in their field of study. william shakespeare and leonardo da vinci were considered amateur artists and autodidacts in their fields of study. radio astronomy was founded by grote reber, an amateur radio operator;

for example it is used in portable two way radios, vhf aircraft radio and in computer modems. \"am\" is often used to refer to mediumwave am radio broadcasting. ==forms of amplitude modulation== in electronics and telecommunications, modulation means varying some aspect of a higher frequency continuous wave carrier signal with an information-bearing modulation waveform, such as an audio signal which represents sound, or a video signal which represents images, so the carrier will \"carry\" the information. when it reaches its destination, the information signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by demodulation. in amplitude modulation, the amplitude or \"strength\" of the carrier oscillations is what is varied. for example, in am radio communication, a continuous wave radio-frequency signal (a sinusoidal carrier wave) has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before transmission. the audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the envelope of the waveform. in the frequency domain, amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the carrier frequency and two adjacent sidebands. each sideband is equal in bandwidth to that of the modulating signal, and is a mirror image of the other. standard am is thus sometimes called \"double-sideband amplitude modulation\" (dsb-am) to distinguish it from more sophisticated modulation methods also based on am. one disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques (not only standard am) is that the receiver amplifies and detects noise and electromagnetic interference in equal propor\n\n[ 386667 ]\n\nAugust_2\n\n==events== *338 bc &ndash;

equivalently, if n and m are distinct and n is a factor of m, then m cannot be a factor of n. in mathematical notation, this is: :\\forall a, b \\in x,\\ r(a,b) \\and r(b,a) \\; \\rightarrow \\; a = b or, equivalently, :\\forall a, b \\in x,\\ r(a,b) \\and a \\ne b \\rightarrow \\lnot r(b,a) . the usual order relation â¤ on the real numbers is antisymmetric: if for two real numbers x and y both inequalities x&nbsp;â¤&nbsp;y and y&nbsp;â¤&nbsp;x hold then x and y must be equal. similarly, the subset order â on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric: given two sets a and b, if every element in a also is in b and every element in b is also in a, then a and b must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal: :a \\subseteq b \\and b \\subseteq a \\rightarrow a = b partial and total orders are antisymmetric by definition. a relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric (e.g., the equality relation), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., the \"preys on\" relation on biological species). antisymmetry is different from asymmetry, which requires both antisymmetry and irreflexivity. ==examples== the relation \"x is even, y is odd\" between a pair (x, y) of integers is antisymmetric: ::even and odd antisymmetric relation every asymmetric relation is also an antisymmetric relation. ==see also== * symmetry in mathematics ==references== * *\n\n[ 290700 ]\n\nAlloy\n\nan alloy is a material composed of two or more metals or a metal and a nonmetal.metals and alloys. bbc an alloy may be a solid solution of the elements (a single phase), a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions) or an intermetallic compound with no distinct boundary between the phases. solid solution alloys give a single solid phase microstructure, while partial solutions exhibit two or more phases that may or may not be homogeneous in distribution, depending on the thermal (heat treatment) history of the material. an inter-metallic compound has one other alloy or pure metal embedded within another pure metal. alloys are used in some applications, where their properties are superior to those of the pure component elements for a given application. examples of alloys are steel, solder, brass, pewter, phosphor bronze and an amalgam. the alloy constituents are usually measured by mass. alloys are usually classified as substitutional or interstitial alloys, depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. they can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or intermetallic (where there is no distinct boundary between phases). ==introduction== thumb|liquid bronze, being poured into molds during casting. thumb|a brass lamp. an alloy is a mixture of either pure or fairly pure chemical elements, which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a metal. an alloy is distinct from an impure metal, such as wrought iron, in that, with an alloy, the added impurities are usually desirable and will typically have some useful benefit. alloys are made by mixing two or more elements;

he served as president of the ecole from 1995 to 2004. and philippe ariÃ¨s (1914â1984), who joined the group in 1978. the third generation stressed history from the point of view of mentalities, or mentalitÃ©s. the fourth generation of annales historians, led by roger chartier (1945â ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the cultural and linguistic turn, which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices. the main scholarly outlet has been the journal annales d'histoire economique et sociale (\"annals of economic and social history\"), founded in 1929 by lucien febvre and marc bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental framewor\n\n[ 234493, 456981 ]\n\nAntiparticle\n\ncorresponding to most kinds of particles, there is an associated antiparticle with the same mass and opposite charge (including electric charge). for example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positively charged electron, or positron, which is produced naturally in certain types of radioactive decay. the laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. for example, an antiproton and a positron can form an antihydrogen atom, which is believed to have the same properties as a hydrogen atom. this leads to the question of why the formation of matter after the big bang resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and antimatter. the discovery of charge parity violation helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate. particle-antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other, producing photons; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. for example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays, a process exploited in positron emission tomography. antiparticles are produced naturally in beta decay, and in the interaction of cosmic rays in the earth's atmosphere. because charge is conserved, it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying a particle of the same charge (as in beta decay) or creating a particle of the opposite charge. the latter is seen in many processes in which both a particle and its antiparticle are created simultaneously, as in particle accelerators. this is the inverse of the particle-antiparticle annihilation process. although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles. the neutron, for e\n\n[ 84042 ]\n\nAssociative_property\n\nin mathematics, the associative property is a property of some binary operations. in propositional logic, associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs. within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed. that is, rearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value. consider the following equations: :(2+3)+4=2+(3+4)=9 \\, :2\\times(3\\times4)=(2\\times3)\\times4=24 \\, even though the parentheses were rearranged, the values of the expressions were not altered. since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any real numbers, it can be said that \"addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations.\" associativity is not to be confused with commutativity, which addresses whether a Ã b = b Ã a. associative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many algebraic structures (such as semigroups and categories) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative. however, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; some examples include subtraction, exponentiation and the vector cross product. in contrast to the theoretical counterpart, the addition of floating point numbers in computer science is not associative, and is an important source of rounding error. == definition == thumbnail|associative binary operation * on the set s. formally, a binary operation * on a set s is called associative if it satisfies the associative law: (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) for any x, y, z in s. here, * is used to replace the symbol of the operation, which may be any symbol, and even the absence of symbol like for the multiplication. (xy)z=x(yz) = xyz for any x, y, z in s. the associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus: f(f(x, y), z) = f(x, f(y, z)). ==generalized associative law== if a binary operation is associative, repeated application of the operation produces the same result\n\n[ 65407, 105637, 182577, 212215, 405682 ]\n\nAtanasoffâBerry_computer\n\nthumb|250px|atanasoffâberry computer replica at first floor of durham center, iowa state university the atanasoffâberry computer (abc) was the first automatic electronic digital computer, an early electronic digital computing device that has remained somewhat obscure. to say that it was the first is a debate among historians of computer technology as it was not programmable. many credit john mauchly and j. presper eckert, creators of the eniac,john presper eckert jr. and john w. mauchly, electronic numerical integrator and computer, united states patent office, us patent 3,120,606, filed 26 june 1947, issued 4 february 1964, and invalidated 19 october 1973 after court ruling on honeywell v. sperry rand. which came into use in july 1946, with the title. others cite the british contender colossus, a development team headed by tommy flowers demonstrated colossus to be working on december 8, 1943. the world's first electronic digital computer that was programmable, it ran at a remarkable (for the time) 5.8&nbsp;mhz. designed and used exclusively for code breaking during world war ii, after the war alternative uses were considered, but they remained in use for their original purpose until the late 1950s. some historians argue that the credit undisputedly belongs to iowa state mathematics and physics professor john vincent atanasoff for his work with the 'abc,' with the help of graduate student clifford berry. conceived in 1937, the machine was not programmable, being designed only to solve systems of linear equations. it was successfully tested in 1942. however, its intermediate result storage mechanism, a paper card writer/reader, was unreliable, and when john vincent atanasoff left iowa state college for world war ii assignments, work on the machine was discontinued. the abc pioneered important elements of modern computing, including binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements, but its special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable, stored program distinguish it from modern computers. the computer was designated an ieee milestone in 1990.{{cite web |url=http://www\n\n[ 21195, 236672, 236699, 251965, 331493, 480077 ]\n\nAmmonia\n\n{{chembox | watchedfields = changed | verifiedrevid = 464364488 | imagefile1 = ammonia-dimensions-from-greenwood&earnshaw-2d.png | imagename1 = stereo structural formula of the ammonia molecule | imagefilel1 = ammonia-3d-balls-a.png | imagenamel1 = ball-and-stick model of the ammonia molecule | imagefiler1 = ammonia-3d-vdw.png | imagenamer1 = space-filling model of the ammonia molecule | iupacname = azane | othernames = hydrogen nitride trihydrogen nitride nitro-sil | section1 = | section2 = {{chembox properties | formula = nh3 | molarmass = 17.031 g/mol | appearance = colourless gas | odor = strong pungent odor | density = 0.86&nbsp;kg/m3 (1.013 bar at boiling point) 0.769 &nbsp;kg/m3 (stp)http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/gas-density-d_158.html 0.73&nbsp;kg/m3 (1.013 bar at 15&nbsp;Â°c) 681.9&nbsp;kg/m3 at â33.3&nbsp;Â°c (liquid) 817&nbsp;kg/m3 at â80&nbsp;Â°c (transparent solid) | meltingptc = â77.73 | boilingptc = â33.34 | solubility = 47% w/w (0&nbsp;Â°c)31% w/w (25&nbsp;Â°c)18% w/w (50&nbsp;Â°c) | solubleother = soluble in chloroform, ether, ethanol, methanol | solvent = | pka = 32.5 (â33&nbsp;Â°c),perrin, d. d., ionisation constants of inorganic acids and bases in aqueous solution;

it may have simply been chanted by the congregation. it debuted in print in 1779 in newton and cowper's olney hymns but settled into relative obscurity in england. in the united states however, \"amazing grace\" was used extensively during the second great awakening in the early 19th century. it has been associated with more than 20 melodies, but in 1835 it was joined to a tune named \"new britain\" to which it is most frequently sung today. author gilbert chase writes that \"amazing grace\" is \"without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns,\"chase, p. 181. and jonathan aitken, a newton biographer, estimates that it is performed about 10&nbsp;million times annually. it has had particular influence in folk music, and has become an emblematic african american spiritual. its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. \"amazing grace\" saw a resurgence in popularity in the u.s. during the 1960s and has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century, occasionally appearing on popular music charts. == john newton's conversion == {{quote box | width = 22em | quote = how industrious is satan served. i was formerly one of his active undertemptors and had my\n\n[ 7086, 29380, 29854, 30207, 82223, 114971, 182869, 184285, 221667, 252868, 260280, 261563, 264313, 304787, 327658, 421391, 445476, 470810 ]\n\nApril_29\n\n==events== * 711 &ndash;
