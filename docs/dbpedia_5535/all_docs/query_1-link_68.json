Harington, ed., The Year Without a Summer? World Climate in 1816 (Ottawa, 1992), p. 16. This collection includes articles about the impact of 1816 across the globe although research on North America and Europe is predominant. I would like to sincerely thank H.V. Nelles, Bill Parenteau and the anonymous reviewers for Acadiensis for their comments and assistance with this paper.\n\n2 This description draws on first-hand accounts of the Tambora eruption found in Michael R. Rampino, \"Eyewitness Account of the Distant Effects of the Tambora Eruption of April 1815\", in Harington, Year Without a Summer, pp. 12-5.\n\n3 Two recent good examples in these literatures are Alan Taylor, \"‘The Hungry Year’: 1789 on the Northern Border of Revolutionary America\", in Alessa Johns, ed., Dreadful Visitations: Confronting Natural Catastrophe in the Age of Enlightenment (New York, 1999), pp. 145-82 and K.R.

According to Lamb’s dust veil index, the Tambora eruption produced a 3,000 dust veil while at the Krakatau eruption the base line for the index was 1,000.\n\n8 \"It should be noted that northern hemisphere eruptions deposit acidic aerosols on the snow within months of the event, while southern hemisphere acid signatures [in ice cores] appear as much as one year after the southern eruptions\". See Bea Taylor Alt, David A. Fisher and Roy M. Koerner, \"Climatic Conditions for the Period Surrounding the Tambora Signal in Ice Cores from the Canadian High Arctic Islands\", in Harington, Year Without a Summer, p. 310.\n\n9 Climate has no impact on whether or not a volcano will occur and yet a volcano can have an immense impact on the climate.

Jones and R.S. Bradley on climatic variations over the last 500 years. See R.S. Bradley and P.D. Jones, eds., Climate Since A.D. 1500 (London, 1992), pp. 649-65.\n\n14 Brádzil, \"Patterns of Climate\", p. 365; Fagan, Little Ice Age, p. 172; Stommel and Stommel, Volcano Weather, Chapters 4-7.\n\n15 On the development of the forest economy in this period, see Graeme Wynn, Timber Colony: A Historical Geography of Early Nineteenth Century New Brunswick (Toronto, 1981) and A.R.M. Lower, Great Britain’s Woodyard: British America and the Timber Trade (Montreal and Kingston, 1973). On the relationship between agriculture and the timber trade in early-19th century New Brunswick, see Wynn, \"Deplorably Dark and Demoralized Lumberers?: Rhetoric and Reality in Early Nineteenth Century New Brunswick\", Journal of Forest History (October 1980) and Beatrice Craig, \"Agriculture and the Lumberman’s Frontier in the Upper Saint John Valley, 1800-1870\", Journal of Forest History (July 1988).\n\n16 Benjamin Crawford’s diary was found in the Provincial Archives of Ontario (PAO) even though much of the record pertains to New Brunswick. Born in Westchester County, New York in 1777, Benjamin came with his family to New Brunswick (then Nova Scotia) in 1783. Benjamin Crawford married in Long Reach, New Brunswick and worked a farm and served as a Justice of the Peace in that community until 1836 when he and his family moved to North Oxford township in Upper Canada. He kept a diary beginning in 1799 while on a trip to Upper Canada and ending only with his death in 1859. His weather observations do not begin, however, until 1810.\n\n17 Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place while climate is an average of the weather of a particular time and/or place.\n\n18 Stommel and Stommel, Volcano Weather, p. 19.\n\n19 Benjamin Benedict Crawford Diary (BBC), 7 June 1816, Crawford Family Papers, PAO, F 709, MS 796. The original spelling and grammar in this diary has been retained except for the insertion of periods and capitals to indicate separate notes within a diary entry.\n\n20 Alan Ruffman and Erik Nielsen directed the Nova Scotia Tree-Ring Project in 2000-2001 that sought to produce a climate model for the Atlantic Region for the past 500 years based on tree-ring evidence from each province. See Alan Ruffman, letter to author, February 2001.\n\n21 Brádzil, \"Patterns of Climate\", pp. 355-6.\n\n22 Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Times of feast, times of famine: a history of climate since the year 1000, trans.

Canadian historians using farm account books for economic history in this period include Douglas McCalla, Planting the Province: the economic history of Upper Canada, 1784-1870 (Toronto, 1993); Craig, \"Agriculture and the Lumberman’s Frontier\" and Wynn, Timber Colony. A recent European example is P.Ø. Nordli, \"Reconstruction of nineteenth century summer temperatures in Norway by proxy data from farmers’ diaries\", Climatic Change, 48 (January 2001), pp. 201-18. For an analysis of methods using diaries and other documentary sources, see Christian Pfister, Rudolf Brádzil, Rüdiger Glaser, Mariano Barriendos, Dario Camuffo, Mathias Deutsch, Petr Dobrovolny, Silvia Enzi, Emanuela Guidoboni, Oldrich Kotyza, Stefan Militzer, Lajos Rácz and Fernando S. Rodrigo, \"Documentary evidence on climate in sixteenth-century Europe\", Climatic Change, 43, 1 (September 1999), pp. 55-110.\n\n27 The reliability of Crawford’s diary is reflected in the consistency of his weather and weather-related entries. In 1812 there are 144 days with no record (39.3 per cent); in 1813 this drops to 59 days (16 per cent) and continues to fall such that, in the period from 1815 to 1821, Crawford has no record for an average of only five days out of a year (1.4 per cent) with his most regular entries made in 1816, 1817 and 1818. Accordingly, quantitative conclusions drawn in this paper are less rigorous for the first two years than those drawn for the later period.\n\n28 Brian J. Skinner and Stephen C. Porter, The Blue Planet: An Introduction to Earth System Science (New York, 1995), p. 314.\n\n29 Environment Canada.

A list was made of the principal terms used by Benjamin Crawford to describe the weather and the list was then ordered from coldest to warmest: dreadful cold, very cold, cold, moderate, cool, dull, fine/pleasant/good, warm, very warm, hot/dreadful warm and very hot. Each of these terms was then set equal to a number from -5 through +5 with 0 equal to \"dull\". This allowed the charting and analysis of Crawford’s temperature descriptions on a monthly, seasonal and annual basis. The soundness of this method was tested by comparing the shape of a graph of the average relative temperatures of the period to a graph of temperature normals from the 20th century. Although the amplitude of the 1812-21 graph was smaller, the shape otherwise revealed a close correspondence (Figure Three b).\n\n31 C. Pfister, G. Schwarz-Zanetti and M. Wegmann, \"Winter Severity in Europe: the Fourteenth Century\", Climatic Change, 34 (1996), pp. 91-108.\n\n32 Records of river- and sea-ice conditions from the Hudson Bay region provided the foundation for A.J.W. Catchpole’s important work on climatic variability around Hudson Bay, and specifically his paper \"River Ice and Sea Ice in the Hudson Bay Region during the Second Decade of the Nineteenth Century\".

Thomas, The Climate of Canada (Toronto, 1967), p. 20-1.\n\n35 On 29 August 1815 Crawford noted that it was \"foggy in the morning cleared off in the afternoon\", which is characteristic of sea fog which afternoon sea breezes blow away.\n\n36 Craig, \"Agriculture and the Lumberman’s Frontier\", p. 129.\n\n37 BBC, 21 July 1821and 24 July 1821.\n\n38 This paragraph draws principally upon descriptions of New Brunswick climate and local Long Reach weather found in Peter J. Bowyer, Where the Wind Blows: A Guide to Marine Weather in Atlantic Canada (St. John’s, 1995) and \"The Climate of New Brunswick\", http://www.ns.ec.gc.ca/climate/info.html.\n\n39 Ian Campbell notes, however, \"the LIA’s exact timing is largely a matter of how it is defined and the evidence used for climatic cooling\".

No greater detail was available in either primary or secondary sources, and that Crawford did not provide more information suggests that his interest in this occurrence was as neighbourhood gossip rather than in his role as Justice of the Peace. Moreover, this then might suggest that the persecution of witches into the 19th century was an extra-legal phenomenon.\n\n80 Wolfgang Behringer, \"Weather, Hunger and Fear: Origins of the European Witch-Hunts in Climate, Society and Mentality\", German History, 13 (1995), p. 7.\n\n81 Behringer, \"Weather, Hunger and Fear\", p. 12.\n\n82 Carol F.
