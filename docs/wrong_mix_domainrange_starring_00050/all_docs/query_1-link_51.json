        "text": "Atticus Finch sits on his porch alone, stunned by the inexplicable decision by a jury to doom his client, Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of rape, to the death penalty. There’s some hope of an appeal, but this should have been a clear exoneration. As I sat in the Paramount Theatre audience, watching this quiet moment from the national tour of “To Kill a Mockingbird” play out on stage (through Oct. 16), I found myself asking a question that nagged at me the rest of the show: Who, exactly, are we supposed to be feeling sorry for?\n\nThe plot of “To Kill a Mockingbird” is likely one you’re familiar with, whether that’s because you’ve read the 1960 novel by Harper Lee or watched the 1962 film starring Gregory Peck. This adaptation from Aaron Sorkin — known for television shows like “The West Wing” and movies like “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” alongside his stage work — shifts the narrative, centering lawyer Atticus Finch rather than his daughter Scout. Scout, her brother Jem and their friend Dill retell the story of Robinson’s trial and the events that led up to Bob Ewell, the father of Robinson’s accuser, mysteriously falling on his own knife and dying.\n\nThe story alternates between trial scenes inside the courtroom and the events leading up to and surrounding that trial as it permeates the town of Maycomb, Alabama. At the play’s center is Finch (Richard Thomas), who does everything he can to win this case for Robinson. He also, however, refuses to acknowledge just how ingrained the racism is in his friends and neighbors, repeatedly telling his children to be respectful and understanding of why they are the way they are.\n\nSorkin’s writing is as witty and compelling as you might expect. The courtroom scenes are particularly captivating. Arianna Gayle Stucki as accuser Mayella Ewell flies around the courtroom, shouting racist comparisons between Black people and jungle animals to anyone she can lock eyes with. Her striking speech echoes an equally disturbing tirade from her father, who calls Finch a “race traitor,” using talking points that feel eerily similar to rhetoric floating around the internet these days. Sometimes you have to take a deep breath to release the tension and prepare for the following scene.\n\nBut in this overt racism comes a perplexing audience reaction, as if realizing the appalling nature of racism for the first time. For instance, there was audible disbelief and disgust when one character reveals that his sick, mixed-race son was turned away from the hospital and later died. A disturbing story, but not particularly surprising, with the play taking place in 1934. Every step of the way, we’re shown racists and yet every step is also met with shock, both on stage and off, that the racists continue to be racist.\n\nWhich leads me back to that quiet moment on the porch, where the play seems to want us to focus on Finch’s pain. Sorkin has spoken repeatedly about his efforts to make Finch the story’s protagonist, giving him a flaw (such as believing goodness can be found in everyone) and then allowing him to learn. And while I acknowledge the uphill climb of adapting this story, I found myself struggling to care about Finch belatedly learning that racists are bad when even his children pointed that out to him.\n\nSorkin has also talked about beefing up the roles of Black characters in his version. But somehow, in this story around the unjust trial of a Black man, the Black characters still feel sidelined in favor of focusing on how their pain affects the poor white folks who are just trying to do the right thing. One scene sees the white character of Mrs. Henry Dubose (played by Mary Badham, Scout in the 1962 film) drop racist remarks only for the two Black characters onstage to silently react in the background without much consequence beyond that.\n\nI truly hate yucking peoples’ yum, and I honestly believe that many will love this play. It’s an excellent introduction to the story for the unfamiliar or those who have forgotten over the years. Still, I can’t help feeling like we should be past many of the lessons being taught by this show. We hear all the time about the atrocities of the justice system, from addressing the inequity of our current system to revisiting how it failed in the past. I couldn’t help but think of Emmett Till, whose family is still seeking justice after their discovery of an unserved arrest warrant for Carolyn Bryant Donham — the woman whose accusations led to Till’s death — resulted in neither an indictment nor a confession.\n\nThat clouds how I experienced this play. I fault no one for enjoying it. Thomas’ performance as Finch is worth the price of admission alone. Director Bartlett Sher has Thomas deliver Finch’s impassioned closing arguments in the trial directly to the audience, effectively making us the faceless jury in this awful trial, and implicating us in its inevitable verdict. And yet, somehow, despite a beautiful performance by Yaegel T. Welch as Robinson, we’re still led to feel more sorry for the lawyer who lost the case than the man whose life is being ripped away or the community from which he came. That just doesn’t feel right.\n\nPlaywright Aaron Sorkin’s take on the classic novel “To Kill A Mockingbird” by Harper Lee takes flight during its run at the Citizens Bank Opera House.\n\nBoston’s best theater, previously known as the Boston Opera House, played host to the touring cast and crew for “To Kill A Mockingbird,” which held shows from April 5-17.\n\nThe show closely mirrors the original plot of Lee’s novel, following children, Scout and Jeremy “Jem” Finch, as well as their friend Charles Baker “Dill” Harris as they experience the Finch children’s father, attorney Atticus Finch, take on the challenge of defending Tom Ronbinson, a Black man accused of beating and raping a white girl in their small farm town of Maycomb, Alabama.\n\nThe show and novel take place in 1934, and highlight the racial tension within the Deep South, as well as the aftermath these communities faced after being pulled apart by the Civil War. The war, which ended slavery in the United States, left many white Americans unhappy with the newly-freed Black Americans, particularly those who lived in places like Alabama.\n\nAs Scout, Jem and Dill recount the events of the previous summer, viewers are thrown into their world, and are left trying to solve the mystery of their father’s case, as well as one surrounding a mysterious neighbor – all before school resumes in the fall.\n\nDirected by Bartlett Sher, the show is a wondrous take on the classic novel many were forced to read in high school. The staging was intriguing, the set transformative and the casting was done with expertise and insight.\n\nDespite being sat in the far left orchestra with a ‘limited view,’ nearly every moment of the show was blocked downstage, allowing even those who were hindered by light fixtures and curtains to enjoy just about all of the play. The only hidden pieces included the jury during the courthouse and trial scenes, as well as some minor set pieces in the transitional moments.\n\nWhile it would have been lovely to see the cast that portrayed the jury in Robinson’s trial, as well as their reactions to the shocking revelations made during witness cross-examinations, being close enough to see the expressions for the rest of the play made this sacrifice worth it.\n\nIn terms of the story, the narrator Scout is meant to be no older than nine, and Jem and Dill no older than 14. However, the three ‘children’ are played by adults. While it is understandable that the show contains adult language and mature subject matter, the fact that these children weren’t truly children took away from the intensity of the storytelling and message Lee had intended.\n\nDespite the inaccuracy in age, the portrayal of the three main characters was incredibly well done. Played by Melanie Moore, Scout was intelligent, sassy and a firecracker on stage. Scout handles most of the narration, and Moore’s take on an Alabama accent was both adorable and accurate, holding the attention of the audience as she sets up the story.\n\nHer brother Jem (Justin Mark) held such a heavy presence on stage. Jem is a protective brother and son, and Mark demanded all eyes be on him, even when it wasn’t necessarily his moment to shine. Mark was able to unfold the character of Jem as the show went on, and had the audience learning with him as he faced the challenges of growing up as the only son of the most hated man in Maycomb.\n\nDill, the Finch children’s neighbor and silly sidekick, added just the right amount of comic relief to such a darkened plotline. Played by Steven Lee Johnson, the comedic timing was perfection, and the tone of voice used was just high-pitched enough to give Dill the boy-next-door innocence he needed to charm viewers.\n\nDill has a handful of serious moments in the show, and Johnson executed them beautifully. Towards the end of the play, during a heart-to-heart with Atticus, Johnson brought tears to my eyes as he shared Dill’s struggles of being a boy with absent parents left to his own devices. It’s safe to say Johnson is the hidden gem within this cast.\n\nHowever, the true star of the show was Mr. Atticus Finch himself, played by Richard Thomas. A Tony-nominated and Emmy award-winning actor, Thomas raises “To Kill A Mockingbird” to new heights. He brings just enough seriousness to the rigid Atticus, and enough experience to the show to help improve the entire cast. Thomas is a force to be reckoned with, as is Atticus Finch, and the two made the most enticing, beautiful pair.\n\nHonorable mentions within the show included Jaqueline Williams, who played the Finch family cook and maid Calpurnia, and Anthony Natale who played Link Deas, a witness in the Robinson case. With Link Deas, “To Kill A Mockingbird” diverts from the original story and has Natale play him as deaf, something originally done with the sophomore cast of the Broadway version of the show. Natale speaks the majority of his lines through American Sign Language, and the three children take turns as his narrator in an incredibly moving performance.\n\nThe costuming, lighting and makeup were all standard, nothing in particular jumped out as outstanding or revolutionary. The set design, however, was incredibly well done. The stage transformed from a courtroom, an interrogation room, the Finch’s front porch and back again countless times through the production, and it was done seamlessly thanks to the cast’s quick work.\n\nThe Finch’s front porch was particularly beautiful, with a screen door, window, wooden bench and three mismatched wooden chairs scattered across to add dimension and life to the setting. A good majority of the plot unfolded here, and it was lovely to see Scout and Jem learn countless life lessons in their own front yard.\n\nThough “To Kill A Mockingbird” has packed up and moved to its next stop on tour, the show is a striking portrayal of a classic story, and is most definitely worth catching on Broadway or in the next city this cast and crew stop in.\n\nEvidence shows that it does not deface the Harper Lee novel on which it is based, as the Lee estate at one point contended. And far from devaluing the property as a moneymaking machine, it has created an honorable stream of income that should pour into the estate’s coffers for years to come.\n\nBut as any reader of the novel knows, to say something is not guilty is not the same as saying it’s innocent. And this adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird — written by Aaron Sorkin, directed by Bartlett Sher and starring Jeff Daniels — is hardly innocent.\n\nHow could it be? Every ounce of glossy know–how available at the highest echelons of the commercial theater has been applied to ensure its success, both on Lee’s terms and on what it supposes are ours.\n\nIt is, for one thing, gorgeously atmospheric, from the weathered barn–red siding that serves as the show curtain (the set design is by Miriam Buether) to Adam Guettel’s mournful guitar and pump organ music, which sounds like hymns decomposing before your ear. Mr. Sher has made sure that every movement, every perfectly cast face, every stage picture and costume tells the story so precisely that it would do so even without words.\n\nAh, but the words. As Mr. Sorkin has explained pre–emptively, he faced a dilemma in approaching the material. He could not alter the plot significantly lest he alienate audiences who grew up treasuring the 1960 novel or the 1962 film starring Gregory Peck. To Kill a Mockingbird still had to be the story of the widower lawyer Atticus Finch (Mr. Daniels) bravely standing up to racism in small–town Alabama in the mid–1930s. Defending Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, he could not suddenly introduce DNA evidence to win the case.\n\nOn the other hand, if Mr. Sorkin did not make major changes, the play would be both structurally and politically insupportable in 2018. The leisurely pace of Lee’s narrative wouldn’t work onstage, as the previously authorized adaptation proved in its dull fidelity. That’s because Lee took her time getting to the trial, which doesn’t even begin until halfway through the book. For 150 pages she immerses readers in the charming, perplexing, ominous daily life of Maycomb as seen and narrated by Atticus’s daughter, Scout.\n\nMr. Sorkin does away with that structure, introducing the trial almost immediately and returning to it at regular intervals. In between, he backfills the information and characters the novel frontloaded, but just on a need–to–know basis. The narration — now split among Scout (Celia Keenan–Bolger); her brother, Jem (Will Pullen); and their friend Dill (Gideon Glick) — no longer suggests long hazy childhood summers spent squashing redbugs and pondering why the world is evil so much as a Junior League police procedural.\n\nThis is very effective; Mr. Sorkin apparently trusted that the actors, working with Mr. Sher, would fill in the blanks, and they do. (Having adults play the kids is especially helpful, and Ms. Keenan–Bolger is terrific.) Also effective, exhilarating even, are the interventions by which Mr. Sorkin set out to correct — or, let’s say, extrapolate — the novel’s politics for our time.\n\nHe had to do something. In a novel, we accept the worldview of the narrator, however limited or objectionable. Scout, who is barely 6 at the start of the story, can use words in print that would make her instantly unsympathetic onstage. We also accept that a first–person portrait of a white child’s moral awakening to racism will primarily focus on how it affects the white people around her.\n\nBut onstage, a work about racial injustice in which its principal black characters have no agency would be intolerable, so Mr. Sorkin makes a series of adjustments. With Scout’s point of view subordinated, we see Atticus through our own eyes instead of hers, making him the firm center of the story.\n\nThis gives Mr. Sorkin room to expand the roles of the two main black characters Atticus deals with: his client Tom (Gbenga Akinnagbe) and his housekeeper, Calpurnia. In Tom’s case, the expansion is subtle, largely a matter of giving him the dignity of voicing his own predicament. “I was guilty as soon as I was accused,” he says — adapting a line that was Scout’s in the book.\n\nCalpurnia (LaTanya Richardson Jackson) gets a bigger remake. Bossy toward the children but deferential toward white adults in Lee’s account, she serves in the play as Atticus’s foil and needling conscience. Mocking his argument that Maycomb needs more time to overcome racism, she says, “How much time would Maycomb like?” Their tart but loving squabbles remind Scout of hers with Jem: They behave, she realizes, like brother and sister.\n\nThat’s a startling and somewhat sentimentalized notion, but Ms. Jackson and Mr. Daniels, inerrant in their dryness, pull it off, and Mr. Daniels’s unfussy mastery is useful throughout. But Mr. Sorkin wants a total hero and gets one. When Bob Ewell, the father of the woman supposedly raped, shows up on the Finches’ porch to make threats, Atticus does some kind of flip–and–fold maneuver on him, leaving him groaning in pain. We accept this not only because it’s satisfying but because Mr. Sorkin’s Ewell (Frederick Weller at his most feral) is not merely a violent drunk and a racist but a foaming–at–the–mouth monstrosity.\n\nThese adjustments succeed in themselves. And the material taken largely unchanged from Lee is, naturally, successful as well. The trial, presided over by the hilarious Dakin Matthews as Judge Taylor, is riveting, especially when Tom’s accuser, Mayella Ewell, takes the stand. As played by Erin Wilhelmi, holding herself like a bent pipe cleaner in a print dress, she is a living illustration of pathos transmuted into rage.\n\nIt’s what happens in the gap between the old and new storytelling styles, as Mr. Sorkin tries to kill two mockingbirds with one stone, that gives me pause. His play, with its emphasis on the trial, is about justice, and is thus a bright–line tragedy.\n\nThe novel is about something much murkier: accommodation. Atticus — who was based to some extent on Lee’s father — despises racism as a form of incivility but insists that any man, even Bob Ewell, can be understood if you walk in his shoes or crawl around in his skin. It’s hardly a comedy but is nevertheless hopeful to the extent that it clears some space for a future.\n\nThese are two worthy ideas, if contradictory. In light of racial injustice, accommodation seems to be a white luxury; in light of accommodation, justice seems hopelessly naïve. Perhaps what this beautiful, elegiac version of To Kill a Mockingbird most movingly asks is: Can we ever have both?\n\nThe production is “not an homage or an exercise in nostalgia,” wrote Sorkin for this magazine, “I [didn’t] swaddle the book in bubble wrap and transfer it gently to the stage. Theaters aren’t museums.” Reverent readers–turned–audience members might clutch their pearls (as the Lee estate did), but it’s exciting to hear a writer speak clearly about intent — and about that intangible but incontrovertible sense of present consciousness that a piece of theater owes to its moment. Sorkin has written a new play, and it’s characteristically taut and nimble, fluid and funny, with plenty to meditate on and argue about. Its goal is to speak audibly about 2018 and — sometimes poignantly — it succeeds. As a piece of writing, it’s both rollicking and ruminative, and my own personal jury is still out on its major thematic turn of the dial: a condemnation of modern respectability politics through the developing character of Atticus. But as a piece of theater, it’s magnificent. Bartlett Sher and his designers have created a shifting, breathing, gorgeously orchestrated world, and while the top–billed Jeff Daniels is indeed lighting up the stage as the story’s iconic lawyer, every member of the ensemble shines alongside him. As a company, under Sher’s careful and majestic direction, they are incandescent.\n\nWhether or not the influence is conscious, this To Kill a Mockingbird owes something to the Royal Shakespeare Company’s great 1980s adaptation of Nicholas Nickleby. It revels in the dramatic possibilities of narration, and it has to stretch itself less to find those flexible storyteller–cum–character voices, since its source material already unfolds in the first person. And what a person. Celia Keenan–Bolger is so wonderful as Scout Finch that the air seems to buzz around her. Shoulders hiked up with youthful energy, thin and furrow–browed in a blonde pageboy cut and denim overalls, she’s light and solemn at once, luminous and grounded and sharp as a penknife. When she canters loose–limbed across the stage, or nestles in nooks and crannies to eavesdrop on her elders, it’s impossible to watch anything else. Keenan–Bolger is 40, and she seems born to the part of this smart, headstrong 6–year–old in a way that gives you the rare, enchanting sense that you really are watching an actor’s soul shimmer in public. She and her fellow adult–kids — the equally marvelous Will Pullen as Scout’s brother Jem and Gideon Glick as their oddball friend Dill — are like a trio of virtuoso violinists: You can see the children, the beautiful instruments that are being brought to life, and you can see the incredible grace and skill of the performers, and above all you can hear the music.\n\n“I’ll be narrating this story,” Keenan–Bolger’s Scout informs us, her chin upturned with the unruffled brio of the very young. “And I’m also part of the narrative.” She’s got some big questions, and she’s ready to dig for the truth. Or she thinks she is. Sorkin leaps to the end of Lee’s novel to begin his play, galloping back and forth from the climax and wrapping the story of hate and hope and the sickening, familiar miscarriage of justice inside a children’s detective romp. Bob Ewell fell on his own knife — or did he?Scout’s not so sure, and she’s crafting a memory play in order to piece together the events of the summer of 1935 in her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama. The summer Dill came to town. The summer of Boo Radley. The summer of the trial of Tom Robinson. The summer she and her brother really started to grow up.\n\nSo far, so Harper Lee. But Sorkin’s major twist is that here — in this play and, the play is arguing, in this age — Atticus has as much growing to do as his children. In fact, he has more. The kids have their heads on pretty straight in Sorkin’s world: They see ugliness, dishonesty, cowardice, or blind hate, and they call it out for what it is. Sometimes in their righteous indignation they lose their cool, as when Jem decimates the prize camelia bush of their bigoted neighbor Mrs. Henry Lafayette DuBose (Phyllis Somerville) with his sister’s twirling baton. Their father is more temperate. He believes in right action, and he also believes in courtesy — to Mrs. DuBose and even to the likes of Bob Ewell (Frederick Weller), a sadistic, craven, virulently racist lowlife who proudly claims ties to the KKK, threatens to lynch people who cross him, and beats and molests his own daughter, the broken, brainwashed Mayella (Erin Wilhelmi). “I believe in being respectful,” Atticus says to Calpurnia (LaTanya Richardson Jackson), the black woman who has worked for his family since before Scout was born, and whom Scout perceives as having a frank, sibling–like relationship with her father. “No matter who you’re disrespecting by doin’ it,” Calpurnia shoots back at her well–meaning white boss.\n\nIs Atticus’s insistence on decency a reflection of the relative ease and comfort in which he lives? Is it a code that’s purchased at the expense of real justice, real progress? Can we just not afford it anymore? “They don’t deserve an explanation!” shouts Jem of the people in Maycomb, Bob Ewell included, who lead with their fear and their hatred, while his patient patrician father is constantly attempting to explain, if not excuse, people. Atticus’s famous exhortation to his children, that they can’t truly understand a person until they “climb into his skin and walk around in it” is still here, but it no longer resonates as flawlessly sage counsel. Instead, it seems to suggest this Atticus’s blind spots, the limits of the all–encompassing empathy he attempts to cultivate. The color of that skin is much more important than Atticus supposes: He can imagine the suffering that drove Bob Ewell, a white man, to becoming a monster, but can he actually imagine the suffering that the wrongfully accused Tom Robinson (Gbenga Akinnagbe), a black man, lives with every day, and under the pressures of which he has remained kind, hardworking, and human? The first time this Atticus meets Tom to offer to defend him in court (against Bob Ewell’s baselessly despicable accusation that Tom has raped Mayella), he talks over him until Tom finally demands to be heard. Sorkin’s Atticus is still a man of integrity, but the new trajectory set before him is clear: He’ll have to check his privilege.\n\nAs a reframing of character that launches To Kill a Mockingbird squarely into the center of many a hot contemporary debate, it works. Daniels is almost too good. He’s so immensely solid, so appealing and articulate and affecting in the role — and the audience is breathlessly overjoyed to watch him — that the sense that, when the story begins, this is a man with well–intentioned blinders on gets a little obscured. This Atticus doesn’t tell Jem that courage is knowing you’re licked before you begin, because he doesn’t seem to know he is licked (and because, in the novel, that definition specifically arises from Atticus’s respect for Mrs. DuBose, who manages to kick her morphine addiction before dying; here, the nasty Mrs. DuBose gets no exculpatory humanizing. Sorkin has written an Atticus in the person of Daniels, who seems so rooted, intelligent, and open–eyed. Can we really buy his insistence on the fundamental goodness of the people of Maycomb, his certainty that when they’re called upon in court to rise — not simply to stand, Scout notes, but to “raise [themselves] to the level of a just God” — they won’t let their fears or prejudices “extend to sending an innocent man to his death?” “Time’s are changing,” he assures Calpurnia, but we’re more than prepared for her flat reply: “You sure about that?” (Sher fills the court’s audience box with ensemble members, but he tellingly keeps the twelve chairs in the jury box empty: Atticus can’t see these men — these embittered white farmers who will vote their fears and their self–interest every time — until it’s too late.)\n\nLink Deas (Neal Huff) is the good–hearted cotton farmer who masquerades as the town drunk, keeping the ugly and ignorant at arm’s length with his affected dishevelment and his bottle of Coca Cola disguised in a brown paper bag. Outwardly, Deas couldn’t be more different from the aristocratic lawyer, in his trademark linen suits and tortoise shell glasses — but both men are smart enough to see the perpetual disappointment of the world, its track record of cowardice and cruelty. One is more personally broken by it, but both are attempting to find their way through cynicism towards something else. Call it courage.\n\nBut a different argument is being made with this Atticus, and all’s fair in love and adaptation. Seen another way, it’s Daniels’s full, nuanced performance that keeps Sorkin’s pointedness from feeling pedantic. And it’s Sher, too. Sher’s masterful elevation of the text — the force and delicacy with which he simultaneously sweeps the play along and lights a fire underneath each of its actors — turns two hours and thirty five minutes into “Once upon a time…” He’s the kind of theatrical storyteller whose tales you long to sit through again immediately, even as the curtain comes down. Along with plays and musicals, Sher has an impressive opera resume, and that kind of elegant, fluid but formidable maestro’s hand is evident here. Miriam Buether’s splendid set conjures, as its shell, something like an old abandoned factory or warehouse — the kind of place that kids love to play in and that grown–ups call dangerous, or the kind of place that’s left in dying towns full of discontented people where old industries are disappearing and old beliefs are digging in their heels.\n\nInside this evocative frame, pieces of the courtroom and the town glide in and out, walls and porches and roofs and the dense, leafy limbs of southern trees appear and vanish with a mesmerizing, almost dreamlike rhythm. Sher works like a conductor, expertly orchestrating the space so that the story can spring from it fleet–footed and without hindrance. With his designers, he goes big but he doesn’t go overboard. Ann Roth’s costumes are spot–on and free of frills, Jennifer Tipton’s lighting is deliberate and painterly — single shafts across the space are enough to make the breath catch — and Adam Guettel has composed beautifully understated original music that soars when it finally needs to. Sher and his team have assembled a serious, exhilarating playground, as rich with imaginative potential as it is with detail. After all, the modular nature of the production’s landscape — the way Buether’s set comes together and breaks apart again, its walls porous, its edges unfinished — speaks to its real setting: Scout’s memory. A place of inquisitive reconstruction, of images collected and fit back together across time — because of course the Scout who tells us about the summer of 1935 is a palimpsest. The narrator and the author, the kid detective and the grown, still searching woman.\n\nLike all children, Scout and Jem learn the world through both adventure and osmosis. One of the play’s most chilling moments comes when the battered, poisoned Mayella takes the stand and, pushed hard by Atticus to point at the real culprit in the room — her father — she explodes like a homemade bomb, scattering atrocious racist shrapnel everywhere. Her rant against Tom is taken word for word from a screed we’ve heard Bob Ewell make to Atticus, and her mad eyes glisten with the toxic satisfaction of having a creed to cling to, something that someone in this world has cared enough to repeat in her presence. Mayella has been taught — not carefully, perhaps, but taught all the same — and her schooling has been at the hands of a monster.\n\nMeanwhile, Scout’s been learning to look for humanity even in the most irredeemable places. She defuses a bomb of her own when she and Jem follow Atticus one night to the jail where Tom is being held — and where, Atticus hears, Bob Ewell his headed with a lynch mob. Sitting outside the cell door armed only with a reading lamp (that’s Atticus all over: enlightenment will prevail), the lawyer tries to fend off the gang of hooded thugs with reason, but it’s Scout’s surprise emotional appeal that wins, if only for that night. She recognizes one of the men, despite his hood, as Mr. Cunningham (Wolohan), a poor farmer whom Atticus has been helping practically gratis to fight the entailment on his land. Keenan–Bolger is gentle and riveting as she addresses the bulky, shamefaced man — Wolohan also plays Boo Radley, and there’s something fascinating in Scout’s eventual clear–eyed seeing of both men, the coward and the hidden hero. As she faced him down, speaking from real kindness and concern, incapable of the kind of condescension that these men see in Atticus, I shed my first tears of the evening. They were far from the last.\n\nPerhaps it is, in part, Keenan–Bolger’s performance — and those of Daniels and Pullen, Akinnagbe and Jackson — that leave me unable to rest entirely easy in the notion that decency has no more place in the world, that, like Atticus’s linen suit, it’s a white luxury, a prim roadblock on the way to true liberation. There’s bravery and dignity in every one of these actors, and there’s also generosity: Their characters, like Jem or Calpurnia, might believe that Atticus’s brand of civility goes too far and does too much collateral damage, but their very essences as performers speak to a kind of moral rightness that’s not disassociated from compassion and from kindness. In writing about the development of his Atticus, Sorkin connected the character’s mindset to Trump’s infamous characterization of the deadly events of August 2017 in my hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia. (You know — “very fine people on both sides.”) I get Sorkin’s allusion: It was a hot–take–y way to make his point. But I believe it’s dangerous to connect a piece of bad–faith political drivel out of the mouth of someone with a track record of heinous corruption and criminal self–interest with the honest efforts of a person of integrity who’s trying to remember that the world is made up of human beings. Some of those human beings are Bob Ewells or Donald Trumps. Some are Mr. Cunninghams. Some are Tom Robinsons or Scouts. And plenty are somewhere in between. “There’s just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to ’em,” says Maycomb’s sheriff, the dry Heck Tate (Danny McCarthy), to Atticus, when Bob Ewell finally meets his bloody end. “Even then, they ain’t worth the bullet it took to shoot ’em.” “Oh no,” Calpurnia replies, her eyebrow perpetually raised, “they’re worth the bullet.”\n\nIt’s a laugh line, and we feel good laughing — because Bob Ewell is about as irredeemable as they come. But I can’t help hearing the sheriff’s same words coming out of the racist abuser’s mouth. Whom would he be referring to? Tom? Atticus? What would we make then of the easy pronouncement that some people deserve to be put out of our misery?\n\n“All rise,” Scout repeats throughout the play, and on the wings of Sher’s direction and his outstanding ensemble of actors, the production does rise. Ultimately, it rises above Sorkin’s fashionably contemporary polemic on privileged, blinkered white civility — which is both a real phenomenon and, at least from where I stand, not cause enough to abandon empathy in the pursuit of right action. Sher and his company have crafted something of breathtaking grace and poignancy, and have laid open Sorkin’s telling of the story. They fill out what could veer towards cleverness or dogmatism with breath and nuance and soul, enabling to walk away exhilarated and uncertain, questioning both ourselves and a story we’ve long thought we knew.\n\n“We can’t go on like this,” urges Jeff Daniels as Atticus Finch toward the end of Aaron Sorkin’s fine–grained stage retelling of To Kill a Mockingbird. “We have to heal this wound or we will never stop bleeding.” Those plaintive words, spoken about the cancerous racial inequality in 1930s Alabama, land with a visceral gut punch in 2018, all too clearly reflecting the ugly rise of the alt–right across a nation bitterly torn by the political dissemination of fear and hatred. It’s to Sorkin’s credit that he lets the contemporary parallels emerge naturally, without hitting us over the head, in a transfixing act of theatrical storytelling graced by exceptional ensemble acting.\n\nPerhaps the most notable achievement of this thoughtful adaptation, and Bartlett Sher’s meticulously calibrated Broadway production, is that it takes Harper Lee’s 1960 novel — a modern American classic that pretty much all of us know either from studying it in high school or watching the outstanding 1962 film version — and makes us hang on every word as if experiencing the story for the first time.\n\nSorkin, Sher and their estimable cast work together to give every significant figure on the stage a distinct identity without a whiff of cliché. That nuanced revivification of familiar characters is matched by a haunting sense of time, place and community, and yet the bridge to our own era is implicit. This is not starchy masterpiece theater, it’s very much alive and emotionally impactful.\n\nEven the riskiest choices pay off, such as having Atticus’ children, the book’s six–year–old narrator Jean Louise “Scout” Finch (Celia Keenan–Bolger) and her older brother Jem (Will Pullen), as well as their visiting friend Dill Harris (Gideon Glick), played by adults. That potential disconnect dissolves within the first scene, instead yielding a beautiful duality that allows the play to unfold both as a story of children having their eyes opened to the cruelty of the world, and of those same figures as adults, reflecting back with sadness on the loss of innocence. The thematic emphasis on kindness and decency in the face of stark injustice is deeply moving.\n\nOne of the works that put Sorkin on the map as a writer was A Few Good Men, so it should be no surprise that he’s adept at constructing a taut courtroom thriller with fiery speeches. He weaves the climactic trial throughout the story, calling the first witness just 10 minutes into the play. The majority of the audience knows how it will end for the defendant Tom Robinson (Gbenga Akinnagbe), a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Nonetheless, you find yourself holding your breath as his fate is decided, your eyes stinging with tears.\n\nThe other structural shift is the disclosure, early in the play, of the death of racist redneck Bob Ewell (Frederick Weller), father of alleged rape victim Mayella (Erin Wilhelmi). While Scout voices her skepticism about the official explanation that Ewell fell on his own knife, the doubts surrounding his fate provide a secondary thread of suspense resolved only in the tense final scenes.\n\nScout, sporting tomboyish dungarees and a hacked–off basin bob, remains at the heart of the story, grappling with the complexities of adult behavior and small–town mentalities. But she shares narrating duties here with Jem and Dill. With their funny, folksy Southern vernacular, they break the fourth wall in ways that draw us in while heightening the theatricality of the presentation.\n\nDesigner Miriam Buether has transformed the stage into a vast derelict industrial space in which the principal settings — the courthouse of fictional Maycomb County and the porch of the Finch family home — are assembled before us. A guitarist (Allen Tedder) sits on one side of the stage and an organist (music director Kimberly Grigsby) on the other, playing original accompaniment written by Adam Guettel that helps to sketch the milieu, oil the fluid scene transitions and provide occasional underscoring. The evocative stagecraft extends to Ann Roth’s character–defining costumes and Jennifer Tipton’s exquisitely descriptive lighting.\n\nWhat remains unseen, along with the jury of 12 white farmers, is the home of Boo Radley (Danny Wolohan), the recluse whom the town gossips have branded as a living ghost likely to murder them in their sleep. To the impressionable kids, that morbid threat has become an obsession; they conjure the windows of Boo’s home with its drawn curtains, and the knotted oak tree outside where mysterious gifts start appearing, making them as real as any physical element of the staging.\n\nOf course the big challenge in tackling To Kill a Mockingbird is to make audiences forget Gregory Peck as widowed lawyer Atticus, an indelible persona carved in stone in Robert Mulligan’s film. Daniels approaches the character not as a monument of unimpeachable morality, but as a prickly man trying hard to teach his children the values of honesty and compassion, of not rushing to judgment even of those fueled by hate. But his tolerance is constantly called into question.\n\nTo the adoring Scout, Atticus is virtue and intelligence personified. But to Jem, who already sees himself as a feisty young man ready to take on anyone, his father seems exceedingly meek. It should be noted, however, that Sorkin has made the smart decision to disregard the more flawed Atticus of Go Set a Watchman, Lee’s earlier draft of Mockingbird, whose 2015 publication was surrounded by controversy.\n\n“You gotta crawl around in another man’s skin ’fore you can really know him,” Atticus tells the children, reminding them that there is fundamental goodness in everyone. Daniels is highly skilled at showing the flickers of self–examination behind the gravitas — while Atticus insists that every last person in Maycomb is to be regarded as their “friends and neighbors,” we see the piercing shadows of doubt in his thinking.\n\nThis is especially true in his spiky exchanges with Calpurnia (LaTanya Richardson Jackson), the long–serving family maid and the children’s surrogate mother. Her tenderness toward Scout, in particular, is conveyed with touching understatement. As a black woman in the pre–civil rights South, Cal remains true to the period by keeping her views largely to herself. But in her body language and attitudes, the marvelous Jackson shows that she is a friend to Atticus and therefore free to let her exasperation be known, along with her disappointment in his naivety. This gives Cal, like Tom, more substance as a character than in the movie.\n\nAtticus’ position becomes harder to defend after Bob Ewell drops by on what he calls a “fellowship” call. The boozing weasel helps himself to a glass of bourbon before expounding on what he sees as the tragedy of white defeat in the “so–called” Civil War. He then informs Atticus that his fellow Klansmen will not abide race traitors, leaving him with the chilling warning, “One tree, two ropes.” The horrific spectacle of Ewell and his cronies filing down the theater’s aisles, wearing grubby hessian sacks over their heads and brandishing shotguns or chains, as Atticus sits outside the county jail where Tom Robinson is being held overnight, is a shock that ties your stomach in knots. That scene closes the first act on a note of tremendous power.\n\nIn subtle shading work that also helps Daniels make the character his own, Atticus has a lot more humor than many will remember, especially in his banter with the kids, to whom he gives back as good as he gets. Sorkin has always excelled at articulating righteous indignation, and there’s certainly no shortage of that in this searing depiction of racial inequality, of bone–deep prejudice and inhumane injustice that resonate loud and clear in a country whose current stewardship tries to make a virtue of incivility. But the tone is defined as much by lightness and warmth, by the gentle teasing of family life in which even anger and incomprehension are tempered by love.\n\nDaniels gives the production a commanding center alongside the heartbreakingly good Keenan–Bolger, so sparky and amusing as Scout strains to understand what’s happening. But this is very much an ensemble piece in which every element is indispensable.\n\nPullen is constantly puffing himself up to seem bigger and brawnier even though hot–tempered Jem is just 10 when the story begins, while Glick gets many of the laughs as Dill, an endearing, gangly nerd trying to sell a worldlier version of himself to hide his own yearning for familial affection. In one of the play’s gently shattering moments, Atticus considers Dill, seemingly for the first time, telling him, “You have no business being kind, but there you are.” Lee based Dill on her friend Truman Capote, and there are what feel like subdued hints here that the character is gay.\n\nAs Tom Robinson, a 25–year–old father of three, Akinnagbe makes a superb Broadway debut, conveying the strength and dignity that have endured despite this hard–working man’s misfortunes, through his clear–eyed gaze or even simply his posture in the courtroom scenes when his back is to the audience.\n\nPlaying Judge Taylor, an upright man of the law with a rich vein of off–the–cuff Southern humor, Dakin Matthews is hilarious, while Danny McCarthy makes Sheriff Heck Tate entirely credible in the unexpected role of a fair–minded white lawman in 1930s Mississippi. It’s in these character sketches, as much as in Atticus, that novelist Lee’s ennobling faith in human nature shines through. And the forces working against that faith are illustrated with corrosive feeling in a gorgeous scene with Neal Huff as Link Deas, a witness for the defense widely known as the town drunk, who reveals the bitter lessons of adult life in a quiet moment with Dill.\n\nThe mistake that causes Atticus’ carefully laid out case to collapse despite the exculpatory evidence in Tom’s favor is the defendant’s admission of feeling sorry for Mayella, implying a sense of superiority that no white Southern jury of that time will stand for. But the production does show sympathy for poor, dim Mayella, even when she’s angrily parroting Bob Ewell’s racist diatribes. The way the frail–looking Wilhelmi shrinks in fear whenever her volatile father is close by tells us plenty, well before Atticus puts those suspicions into damning words.\n\nWeller is disturbingly effective as an irredeemable snake of a man, while distinguished veteran Phyllis Somerville is a wicked hoot as a different kind of dyed–in–the–wool racist, the scornfully opinionated Mrs. Henry Dubose.\n\nDirector Sher has a magic touch with this kind of quintessentially American story and characters, as he’s shown in musicals like South Pacific or plays like August Wilson’s Joe Turner’s Come and Gone or Clifford Odets’ Awake and Sing! and Golden Boy. He locates the integrity, the fallible human dimensions even in familiar archetypes, and he’s at his best when giving them space to breathe on the extended canvas of populous ensemble pieces like this one.\n\nThis is theatrical storytelling so assured and involving it’s hard to imagine anyone not being mesmerized. Sorkin has pulled off something quite remarkable by honoring Lee’s novel while remaking its events of more than 80 years ago in terms that speak directly to where we are now.\n\nWhat really happened that night Bob Ewell died, wonders Scout (Celia Keenan–Bolger), the most inquisitive and persistent of the three? Could a man really fall on his own knife? Something about the grim story of that harvest night doesn’t add up, no matter what Atticus or the local newspaper said, and young Miss Finch (is she still young?) wants her brother, her best friend and the audience at Broadway’s Shubert Theatre to reconsider. Everything.\n\nThe set–up is a Sorkin masterstroke, perfectly executed by director Bartlett Sher, a dreamy gambit that justifies every liberty this simultaneously revisionist and faithful Mockingbird will take over the next two hours–plus. When, exactly, are the young Finches and their beloved childhood friend reuniting for this exorcism? How long has Scout been pondering that grim evening, when she and her brother were viciously attacked, when their attacker died, when one neighborhood mystery emerged from the shadows and another took its place among the secrets? Weeks? Months?\n\nI’d suggest years. Fifty–eight, to be exact, and what we’re being asked to recall and re–evaluate is not merely an event dreamed up by Harper Lee to cap her landmark 1960 fiction of race, justice, bigotry and faith. Scout and Sorkin and Sher are demanding we reconsider that fiction itself. Our “national novel,” as The New York Times has called it, is the very subject of the new play that bears its name.\n\nWith a fine, natural performance from Jeff Daniels as Atticus Finch — the most honest man in Maycomb, Alabama, as his daughter Scout remembers him — Broadway’s To Kill A Mockingbird, opening tonight, sets a route for itself that is bound to lose some of those who can’t set aside their loyalties to a cherished book or a movie that can still send shivers with the first few notes of its Elmer Bernstein score.\n\nResisters do so at their own expense. Sorkin’s shrewd Mockingbird doesn’t demand our exclusive loyalty – my love for the movie, and for Gregory Peck and Mary Badham and Horton Foote and Kim Stanley’s uncredited narration is undiminished, my lesser affinity for the novel neither strengthened nor weakened. What Sorkin does require, though, is an open mind, a willingness to question the things we so admired about Lee’s tale and its characters, to hold their lessons up for scrutiny in an age when so little of what we once took for granted can withstand the heat. He demands no less of his characters, keeping us in good company from start to finish.\n\nFollowing the brief memory–play preamble on that barren warehouse–looking set, young Jean Louise, Jeremy (Will Pullen) and Charles Baker Harris (Gideon Glick) — Scout, Jem and Dill — are quickly surrounded by the makings of a courtroom (Miriam Buether’s set design is a marvel of efficiency, as a jury box, witness stand, judge’s bench, attorney stations and spectator seats sweep quickly into place. All but the jury box will be filled with people — we never see the men who will decide the fate of Tom Robinson (Gbenga Akinnagbe).\n\nRobinson, of course, is the man who stands falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell (Erin Wilhelmi). He’s black, she’s white, it’s 1934 Alabama and the lynching is all but accomplished, legal or otherwise.\n\nYou know the plot. Scout, Jem and Dill while away a summer that would have been sleepy without the drama and ugliness stirred up by the trial, a local event of outsize proportion that has unleashed a torrent of hate, bile and bigotry that a good man like Atticus didn’t see coming. He doesn’t recognize his own neighbors.\n\nAnd here we have the first inkling of what Sorkin is up to. The creator of “The West Wing” and “The Newsroom” didn’t invent the dark hearts of Maycomb’s townfolk — Lee did. Even in the book (though not the film), cranky old Mrs. Dubose (Phyllis Somerville) does more than call Scout an ugly little girl: She uses vile racial epithets to disparage Atticus for defending Tom, words that so sting and infuriate Jem that he destroys the sickly woman’s prized flower garden.\n\nNo, Sorkin didn’t invent that scene, but its prominence here is no more subtle than it should be in drawing an arrow from Maycomb to Charlottesville, from then to now, from the Finch’s unrecognizable neighbors to our very own.\n\nSorkin hasn’t been quiet about the resemblance of, say, Donald Trump’s “blame on both sides” to Atticus Finch’s “Jem, see if you can stand in Bob Ewell’s shoes a minute.” Though Harper Lee romanticizes Atticus less than memory might have – I suspect Gregory Peck did most of the shaping there – there’s no question that Sorkin pits the other Mockingbird characters against him with a newfound ferocity. Jem considers his father nothing less than a weakling for attempting to understand – or make excuses for – the foul, threatening displays of Bob Ewell, the man who beat and raped his daughter and steered the blame to Tom Robinson. “I could split Bob Ewell in half and God himself would call it a public service,” Jem says heatedly.\n\nCalpurnia, the Finch’s African American housekeeper (LaTanya Richardson Jackson), cuts Atticus no slack either. In perhaps the sharpest divergence from the novel and movie, Cal is given a voice here as she verbally dresses down Atticus for his naive faith in the goodness of his neighbors, his conviction that they’ll do the right thing when push comes to shove. They’re racist, sure, but not to the extent of sending an innocent man to jail or worse.\n\nCal, of course, knows better, and she knows the white community in ways Atticus couldn’t imagine. Mrs. Dubose, Cal says, was a “Negro–hater” even before taking ill, before the morphine stopped easing the pain, before whatever other excuse Atticus has for the old woman’s hatefulness. Cal is barely surprised at the cops’ latest killing of an unarmed black man, and she lets Atticus know, in no uncertain terms, just how blind he is.\n\nAs if heading off charges of anachronism or even white–washing the restrictive limits of what a black servant of the era could get away with, Sorkin has Scout remark on Calpurnia’s long history with Atticus — she raised his wife from childhood, and raised her children — and, in a way, raised Atticus — when Mrs. Finch died. Cal and Atticus, says Scout, are like sister and brother.\n\nLetting Cal say what she wants, is the Mockingbird of our collective daydream, the Mockingbird we’re revisiting with our 21st Century notions, and her boldness is as satisfying as the laugh that erupts from Akinnagbe’s Tom Robinson at Atticus’ quaint notion of courtroom justice.\n\nCal and Tom — both winningly portrayed, both full of surprises — aren’t the only characters given bigger life. Dill, played by Glick with immense and lovable charm, becomes the Truman Capote–in–waiting that we know him to be, witty with a feel for the underdog, his zest for life not yet drained. Sorkin slips in a bit of Capote’s own biography — Capote, too, was locked in rooms as his mother went husband–hunting — and Dill’s obvious preference for the company of Jem over Scout hints at the hard times ahead for this boy so out of place and time.\n\nGlick’s buoyant performance is matched by Keenan–Bolger’s purposeful Scout and Pullen’s confused, searching Jem. Scout can be a petulant child; Keenan–Bolger simply plays petulance. The approach works so well that the alternative — child actors — seems a very bad one indeed.\n\nPicking others from the fine secondary cast seems contrary to the ensemble spirit, but, almost at random, there’s Dakin Matthews’ sharply funny Judge Taylor; Wilhelmi’s wispy, pathetic Mayella; Somerville’s hateful Mrs. Dubose; Danny Wolohan’s tender Boo Radley (and conflicted Mr. Cunningham); and Neal Huff’s Link Deas, a book character absent from the movie but offering a surprising viewpoint found no where else in this tale.\n\nBy the time Atticus comes to question his own moral code, and Sorkin has us contemplating the limits of tolerance and the boundaries of forgiveness, this Mockingbird has already landed its punches.\n\nWords are necessarily changed, actions altered, and scenes refashioned for dramatic purpose, yes; but playwright Sorkin — with expert aid from director Bartlett Sher — serves Lee exceptionally well. The soul and conscience of the 1960 novel virtually leap across the footlights, in a manner every bit as strong as they did on the page and in the 1962 motion picture version. The Broadway Mockingbird will likely leave a throb in your heart and a well of tears in your eyes.\n\nSorkin and Sher begin their play on what turns out to be the precisely right note. A decrepit warehouse–like space is revealed, which is then almost magically (read: theatrically) transformed to each and all of the necessary locales in the fictional “tired old town” of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression–era summer of 1934. From the first, three children—young Scout, her brother, Jem, and their Penrod–like friend, Dill — take focus, serving as narrators offering a vibrant flashback to the serious events of the preceding months. The fragmented and impressionistic storytelling, built around “big scenes” that stand out in the three childrens’ collective memories, carefully capture the startling impact of Lee’s novel. This is enhanced by the manner in which Sorkin and Sher weave the children into some of the flashbacks as almost ghostly observers.\n\nA major part of this Mockingbird’s spell, right from the beginning, is a second conceit: These children are played, openly and unapologetically, by adult actors. As it turns out, their acting skills allow them to convincingly serve and sustain the play in a manner that three juvenile actors most likely could not. Keenan–Bolger, with a ferociously jutting jaw leading her body across the stage, has determination enough for any six–year–old; and Glick, his body gangly and concave, is a perfect embodiment of the irrepressibly awkward Dill (patterned after Lee’s childhood pal, who grew up to become Truman Capote).\n\nThe centerpiece of any representation of Lee’s novel, of course, must be the actor playing Atticus Finch, the small–town lawyer who insists on seeing the best in everyone. Jeff Daniels — whose long career recently brought him back to Broadway with Blackbird — undertakes the role here, and he is remarkable. It’s not that he wipes out the memory of Gregory What’s–His–Name in the motion picture version; it’s simply that Daniels perfectly embodies Atticus Finch, and that’s that.\n\nLaTanya Richardson Jackson (A Raisin in the Sun) adds moral gravity as the housekeeper, somewhat moreso than Calpurnia does in the novel. In 1960 America, there were limits to how noble and well–spoken the novelist could have drawn the character. Standing out among the large cast are Gbenga Akinnagbe (in his Broadway debut) as Tom Robinson, the man on trial; Frederick Weller, vibrantly evil as the repellent Bob Ewell; and Erin Wilhelmi as the victimized Mayella. (Did the author borrow this oversexed, incestuous father–daughter duo from Erskine Caldwell’s Tobacco Road, a bestseller published when Lee was 6 and successfully adapted for both stage and screen by the time she was 15?) There are two excellent performances from members of the recent Iceman Cometh cast: Dakin Matthews as the judge who bends over backward to assure a fair trial; and Neal Huff as Link Deas, the town misfit who speaks the truth.\n\nSher and associates have devised a physical production that augments the play’s aura of fragmented memory. Set designer Miriam Buether does this with high theatrical flair; all the relevant locales are clearly presented, but there seem to be few actual walls other than the jailhouse exterior. Buether, who provided the psychologically compelling scenery for last year’s Three Tall Women, is also currently on the boards with the astounding The Jungle at St. Ann’s Warehouse.\n\nAnn Roth, who has been providing exquisitely realized costumes for stage and screen since the days when giants like Neil Simon and Mike Nichols roamed the Rialto — The Odd Couple, in 1966, was Roth’s eighteenth Broadway show — works her usual magic here. Note the way Scout is dressed in drably colored tomboy garb but with a noticeably newer add–on collar emblazoned with bright red roses. Also consider what is presumably the only courtroom–worthy suit Atticus owns, with trousers that look that they haven’t been pressed since Herbert Hoover was voted out of office. Jennifer Tipton expertly sculpts the many playing areas with light, as she has been doing since the late 1960s. Scott Lehrer does his customarily effective job with the sound design.\n\nIt should be noted that Sher has worked almost exclusively, and always successfully, with one set designer, one costume designer, and mostly two lighting designers; the team has done all 11 of Sher’s prior Broadway shows. Mockingbird has jolted him into new collaborations, with rewarding results all around.\n\nSher has also commissioned an atmospheric incidental score from the estimable Adam Guettel of The Light in the Piazza, played by an onstage organist (at the base of the stage left proscenium) and a guitarist (on stage right). Beneath the dress and wig of that schoolmarmish organist, incidentally, is Kimberly Grigsby, who has electrified musicals like The Full Monty and Spring Awakening from the conductor’s podium.\n\nThe magic of Mockingbird, though, rests on the theatrical imagination of Sorkin, who burst into prominence in 1989 with A Few Good Men and has since ensconced himself in screen–and–TV–land with “The West Wing” and The Social Network, among many highlights. He demonstrates here what novelist Lee — who was famously protective of her work — presumably recognized when granting permission for his play. Stage adaptation is just that; not simply transplanting dialogue from page to stage, but refashioning the source material for the very different medium. (In this case, Sorkin uses humor as one of his effective tools.) A relevant comparison can be made with the current Network: The heart of the piece is well conveyed, thanks in part to a bravura performance by the leading man. But the rest of the venture is dramatically uncompelling, leaving us thinking we might as well just watch the movie.\n\nLee publicly praised Horton Foote when he won an Oscar for his screen adaptation of Mockingbird. Contrary to the recent complaints and courtroom wrangling from the late novelist’s literary executor — a small–town lawyer with an apparently limited artistic imagination — one suspects that Harper Lee would be similarly thrilled by the magnificent manner in which Sorkin, Sher & Co. have brought Atticus, Scout, Jem, Dill, Boo Radley, and the rest to the stage.\n\nSorkin is most widely known as a screenwriter; in films such as Steve Jobs, Moneyball and The Social Network and TV’s “The West Wing” and “The Newsroom,” he has crafted verbal scores capturing with rat–a–tat panache the witty conviviality and brutality of the ambitious and privileged. Lee’s novel, one of the most cherished in American literature, presents him with an entirely different milieu: a small Alabama town in 1934, ravaged by the Great Depression, in which community takes precedence over individual aspiration.\n\nAs anyone familiar with Lee’s story or the history of the Jim Crow South knows well, the sense of community here is not all–embracing. Not unlike our country today, Maycomb has seen many of its citizens — the men, especially — broken economically and spiritually, their pockets depleted and their pride wounded by not only the market crash but also the lingering fallout of the Civil War. It’s under these fraught circumstances that Tom Robinson, a black laborer, finds himself falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell, the poor, white daughter of Bob Ewell, as virulent a racist as ever stalked the pages of a middle–school text. The impossible task of summoning angels to rescue Tom falls to middle–aged lawyer and widower Atticus Finch, a name that has become synonymous with nobility as Americans define it, by character rather than class.\n\nIn Lee’s book, and the beloved 1962 film adaptation, featuring a screenplay by Horton Foote, the story is relayed to us years later by Scout, Atticus’s daughter, who is turning six when events start unfolding. Sorkin retains the sense of devastated innocence augmented by an older, more worldwise perspective, but adds theatrical punch by having Scout’s older brother, Jem, and Dill, the child they befriend while he’s visiting the neighborhood — all played, under Bartlett Sher’s direction, by adult actors — accompany and embellish her narration, sometimes addressing the audience themselves.\n\nThe device is typical of Sorkin’s work here: utterly respectful and faithful in spirit — lest anyone feared otherwise, after an attorney representing Lee’s estate sued the production over an early draft (leading to a counter–suit, then an out–of–court settlement) — while asking us to look forward, and inward, and around us, positing that multi–pronged challenge in the guise of vital, thrilling entertainment. Sher has proven a master of this approach in numerous revivals of American classics, as well as new works; together, the director and playwright allow us to climb inside the skin, as Atticus would put it, of characters representing another time and place, and pace, but seem instantly, sometimes disturbingly accessible.\n\nThe casting is better than perfect; it’s revelatory, with each actor serving both the novel’s humane vision and the nuances and, in some cases, adjustments Sorkin has contributed. Jeff Daniels’ magnificent Atticus — a new high–water mark for an actor whose presence makes any play (or film) worth seeing — may strike you as a more natural small–town Southern lawyer than the more patrician (if unforgettable) Gregory Peck. Hardy and a bit gruff, with a perceptible paunch, Daniels’ Atticus isn’t above physically confronting a threatening bigot. But when he speaks to his children about the importance of having empathy for all people, his compassion is as true and as tender as his presence before the court is mighty — and in the latter arena, Sorkin furnishes opportunities for Atticus to express his frustration with the case, the system and even his client in terms that can be more blunt and biting than Lee’s or Foote’s.\n\nTom and Calpurnia, the Finches’ black housekeeper, are more intimately acquainted with the injustices of that system than any legal scholar could be, and Sorkin gives them more frank and expansive voices as well. LaTanya Richardson Jackson’s warm, witty and wise Calpurnia is both a constant source of love and loyalty to Atticus’s family and his sparring partner, contesting in particular his stubborn insistence on looking for the good in everyone.\n\nAs Tom, Gbenga Akinnagbe emerges as more than the “quiet, respectable, humble Negro” Lee’s Atticus describes to the jury in his closing argument; Akinnagbe’s gently robust performance captures those qualities, but also Tom’s despair over the intolerance that has doomed him. His candor with Atticus, like Calpurnia’s, is made credible by the trust and fellowship this play’s earthy hero inspires. Tom’s integrity and dignity are thrown into even sharper relief by the bone–chilling malevolence of Frederick Weller’s Bob, and the repression–fueled hysteria of Erin Wilhelmi’s fragile, feral Mayella.\n\nNo characters are more central to Mockingbird than the children, of course, and by having Scout share the telling of her tale with Dill and Jem, Sorkin has provided showcases for a trio of superb, youngish actors. It would be hard to imagine a more ideal Scout than the ageless Celia Keenan–Bolger, who imbues the precocious tomboy with all the intensity and wonder you’d expect. Gideon Glick is quirkily charming and moving as the eccentric, brilliant and haunted Dill, a character inspired by Lee’s childhood friend Truman Capote, while Will Pullen’s impish Jem wins our hearts as a mischief–maker who is nonetheless undeniably Atticus’s son.\n\nThe three remain in almost constant motion, whether at play or in the courtroom, where they are fascinated, appalled observers. Characteristically, Sher enhances the urgency and suspense of the piece in part through physical movement; actors carry parts of Miriam Buether’s handsome, bucolic set, which exudes a sense of resilience and tradition — the Finches’ modest but sturdy home, the large tree that sits resolvedly beside it — that also inform darker features of the story, like the hooded, armed men who find Atticus outside Tom’s jail cell at another key juncture in the children’s disillusionment.\n\nAn angel does finally arrive in this Mockingbird, briefly — and too late for Tom — but memorably, as he did in the book and movie. Danny Wolohan plays Boo Radley, the notorious, elusive neighbor the kids have stalked and feared, who emerges as their selfless protector. With his delicate, ghostlike presence, Boo drives home the point that goodness can indeed lurk in unexpected places, and that appearances, be they due to rumor or race, should never figure into judging a man or woman.\n\nMockingbird’s lessons may seem obvious, but like so many on offer at this moment, they also come across as depressingly timely and necessary. By acknowledging that need in a straightforward, utterly unpretentious manner, accompanied by blazing artistry, Sorkin, Sher and their cast and collaborators have given us a production that feels as urgent and eternal as its source.\n\nThe program spells out that this top–flight production, which had its official opening Thursday under the rustically elegant direction of Bartlett Sher, is indeed a “new play by Aaron Sorkin.” It’s a masculine take on one of the greatest novels of girlhood ever written.\n\nThe Boo Radley games played by Scout, her older brother Jem and their regular summer buddy Dill, all of whom are dying to get a peek at their reclusive bogeyman neighbor, are held off for more important concerns. Sorkin leaps into what he believes is the heart of the story: the trial of Tom Robinson, the black man accused of raping a poor white woman.\n\nLegal and ethical questions predominate in Sorkin’s retelling. Scout (a vivid Celia Keenan-Bolger) retains her narrator role to a degree, though the story’s emphasis shifts to her widower father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer who has agreed to defend Tom in a tinderbox case he knows will have dangerous repercussions for all involved.\n\nThe role that Gregory Peck turned into a moral beacon in the classic 1962 film is played by Jeff Daniels with a shambling, heavy–hearted ambivalence. It’s a stirring, thoroughly original portrayal of a character too shadowed with doubt to be heroic yet too determined to do the right thing not to maintain our admiration, even if at times he seems hopelessly naïve.\n\nBut what was once a bildungsroman about a rowdy, independent–minded tomboy whose moral education involves coming to terms with the hypocrisies and willful blindness of the adults around her in Depression–era Alabama is now the story of an idealistic attorney forced to confront the limitations of the law as an instrument of justice in a racist society.\n\nLet the accusations of appropriation fly. Sorkin, who won an Oscar for his screenplay for The Social Network and multiple Emmys for “The West Wing,” can take the heat. His reworking moves as confidently as it speaks. To adapt a high school classic to the stage one must take ownership, submissiveness is a recipe for staleness. Quarrel all you want with the liberties that are taken, Sorkin, Sher and an impeccable cast have created something provocatively fresh.\n\nControversy, in any event, is unavoidable with this landmark American novel. To Kill a Mockingbird tells a fundamental story about the way race and justice are inextricably bound in America. Readers have no choice but to approach the material through the prisms of their own histories. Lee herself was divided about her own book, as revealed by the controversial 2015 publication of Go Set a Watchman, an abandoned earlier work that shows the characters of Mockingbird in a harsher light.\n\nRereading Lee’s Pulitzer Prize winner in 2018 is a vastly different experience from when I first encountered the book in the early 1980s. The times have changed and so have I. But one thing remains constant: our shortsightedness. No one ever commands a total view.\n\nPerhaps that insight is behind the decision to wrestle away some of Scout’s storytelling authority. Even minor assertions are contested by Jem (Will Pullen) and Dill (Gideon Glick), as Scout retrospectively ponders the momentous events that almost cost Jem and her their lives.\n\nOne matter she keeps coming back to is how Bob Ewell (an appropriately slithering Frederick Weller) could have fallen on his knife during his attack on Jem and her. She understands he was seeking revenge for the courtroom humiliation Atticus inflicted on him and his daughter Mayella (a credibly intense Erin Wilhelmi), the young woman who falsely accuses Tom of raping her. But there’s something about his death that just doesn’t make sense.\n\nAs the play jumps back in time, it becomes clear that it’s not the incident itself but the coverup that Scout finds so haunting. She’s desperate to understand Atticus’ journey from idealist to realist, as though the answer to all the societal questions bedeviling her lie in figuring out this one mystery.\n\nAtticus’ belief in the inherent goodness in people is challenged by characters who are given new agency by Sorkin. Calpurnia (played by the formidable LaTanya Richardson Jackson) stays mostly within the bounds of a black housekeeper of the period, but she lets Atticus know that his faith in the town is misplaced.\n\nEvil exists in polite, sleepy Maycomb. (The Ku Klux Klan is made up of the same folks who shop at the hardware store on Saturday and fill the pews on Sunday.) Atticus’ insistence that you can’t judge a person till you crawl inside his skin and walk around in it is simplistic. Empathy is a weak defense against murderous, irrational hatred.\n\nThe actors communicate truths that transcend time: Jackson’s Calpurnia knows her resentments are legitimate but being right isn’t the same thing as being smart. Daniels’ Atticus needs no one to tell him he’s no white shining knight, but he wants to set an example for his children without giving up on his community.\n\nThe portrayal of Tom Robinson is more straightforward. Poised and contained, Gbenga Akinnagbe imbues the character with a dignified gravity that is more Sidney Poitier than Brock Peters (the actor who brought such astonishing physical anguish to his film portrayal of Tom).\n\nSher keeps a tight hold on the emotion of the story, preferring the pressure to build slowly and steadily, like the organ music Adam Guettel has composed for the production. One notable eruption, when Mayella appeals to the jury to convict Tom for the safety of white women everywhere, the histrionics are so troubling that one can only savor the tart irony of Dakin Matthews’ Judge Taylor, whose reactions provide a running commentary on Southern duplicity.\n\nThe jury box is empty, leaving audience members to imagine the identities of these ordinary citizens, who hold in their hands the fate of an innocent man. The weight of their judgment is made all the more staggering by their invisibility. (Theater may lack the velocity of film, but it can do wonders with shorthand.)\n\nThe character of Dill is enlarged, but this might simply be because Glick is such an eccentrically mesmerizing performer. That the roles of the children are played by adult actors isn’t at all an issue. Keenan-Bolger has everything you could want in a Scout — the honeyed drawl, the scrappy temperament, the ice–pick gaze. She could play this role for another 20 years and no one would notice her age.\n\nScout is the medium through which we receive the novel. The story goes beyond her character, but it’s through her precocious deciphering of contradictory signals that we gain a picture of the Maycomb world she’s having so much trouble understanding.\n\nDaniels is the centerpiece of this production, and it’s Atticus’ conscience that drives the drama. But even when the focus moves away from him, my attention remained gripped by the high level of the stagecraft.\n\nThe clean fluidity of Sher’s staging, which makes the most of Miriam Buether’s impressionistic scenic design, Ann Roth’s milieu–nailing costumes and the elegiac glows of Jennifer Tipton’s lighting, is an unmitigated pleasure. And as the organist (who’s positioned across the stage from a guitarist) turns the play into an American mass, I found myself tuning in somberly to Atticus’ dilemma — the dilemma of a man who is better than his society but still a product of it.\n\nHarper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird will gratefully always be with us. This is Sorkin’s version and it finds ways through Atticus’ character to speak directly to our troubled times about the inseparability of race and justice in America. I look forward to future productions from female and African American perspectives that can match this level of theatrical excellence.\n\nNo one owns To Kill a Mockingbird, not even Lee, who died in 2016, or her estate, which fought to protect the book from Sorkin’s bolder encroachments before agreeing to a settlement. The book is ours to wrestle over as we struggle to realize the democratic ideals our imperfect natures and unresolved history have so far kept beyond reach."
