        "text": "Camp Rock 1 & 2\n\nout of\n\nCamp Rock 2: The Final Jam (November 19/10)\n\nAn obvious improvement over its unwatchable predecessor, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam follows Demi Lovato's Mitchie Torres as she once again arrives at the title locale for a summer of music and fun-loving shenanigans - with problems ensuing as a bigger, flashier camp across the lake lures away a large number of Camp Rock's staff and kids. Mitchie and her friends subsequently decide to challenge their newfound rivals to a musical battle, with the winner set to be crowned the ultimate music-oriented summer camp. Much like the original film, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam places a heavy emphasis on hackneyed plot developments and characters that are almost laughably one-dimensional - with Mitchie's absurd transformation from easy-going teen to hard-nosed control freak certainly ranking high on the film's list of unfortunate transgressions. It's just as clear, however, that the movie boasts a number of catchy, thoroughly engaging musical numbers that provide a temporary respite for the otherwise stale atmosphere, with Paul Hoen's energetic direction mirrored in the charismatic (and extremely upbeat) performances from such cast members as Lovato, Alyson Stoner, and, of course, Joe, Kevin, and Nick Jonas. Despite the sporadically better-than-expected vibe, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam is ultimately unable to wholeheartedly overcome its pervasive aimed-directly-at-tweens sensibility - which ensures that the film is destined to fare best among fans of either Lovato (who is actually quite good here, admittedly) or the Jonas brothers."
