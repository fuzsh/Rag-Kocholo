        "text": "It’s astoundingly difficult to watch 2002’s Crossroads, a coming-of-age movie that centers on three best friends (Britney Spears, Zoe Saldana, and Taryn Manning) taking a road trip. The film isn’t streaming either for free or purchase. If you really want, you can buy a DVD of it on Amazon—or pursue more, shall we say, questionably legal means.\n\nThat changes October 23 and 25, when Crossroads will return to theaters for a two-day global fan event that coincides with the release of The Woman in Me, Spears’s highly anticipated memoir. The rerelease—which Spears herself has signed off on—is a truly rare chance to see the pop star’s first and only big-screen outing in all its crimped-hair, crop-topped glory. And for director Tamra Davis, it’s also a chance to reclaim the film’s legacy.\n\nThe story of three estranged childhood friends who reconnect after digging up a wish box they buried as kids and deciding to enter a music competition in Los Angeles, was decimated by critics upon release. “It made me so mad when I rewatched it, because who are you to criticize girl culture?” Davis tells Vanity Fair over Zoom. “This movie wasn’t for you, so don’t talk about it. I’m not going to give you a whole thing about Fast and Furious or something. This really was a film made for girls, by girls.”\n\nAn era when Barbie and the Taylor Swift concert film have reinvigorated the box office is an especially apt time to reevaluate Crossroads, which was directed, produced, and written by women—the script’s by a pre–Grey’s Anatomy Shonda Rhimes—and centered on female friendship. It was also the last of several star-making films from Davis, now 61. Her résumé also includes the first major movies for Chris Rock (1993’s CB4), Adam Sandler (1995’s Billy Madison), and Dave Chappelle (1998’s Half Baked).\n\n“These are films that I made with them for their fans, and we loved them. If I made a film that Adam loved and his fans loved it, that’s all we wanted,” says Davis. “It was like punk-rock music. If the parents didn’t like it, we won…. Having Crossroads come back, it’s the validation that you can’t listen to those critics. You just have to believe that the thing that you made…stands the test of time…. We were right—you were wrong.”\n\nIn honor of the film’s rerelease, Davis dishes on all things Crossroads, including her unorthodox first meeting with her leading lady, Kim Cattrall’s “super harsh” performance as the mother of Spears’s character, and her reaction to Spears saying now that the production “wasn’t easy for me.”\n\nVanity Fair: As I was trying to rewatch the film for our conversation, I learned just how impossible it is to find—on streaming or otherwise. Is that part of why the rerelease is happening?\n\nTamra Davis: Yes. Because people would be like, “Hey, how do I watch?” I’m like, “I know it’s not available. You can’t stream it. It’s nowhere to be found.” I tried to have my lawyers call. And then out of nowhere, I get a call from Sony that after all these years of me trying, and my lawyer, it was Britney that called to get it rereleased because she wanted it to accompany her launch of the book. So, Sony came in and picked up the film from its original distributor, Paramount, and bought the rights. It’s going to be available for this event, but then they’re going to do a streaming deal.\n\nDo you feel like the movie will be received differently now?\n\nFor sure. I just rewatched it myself, and I hadn’t seen it in, God, I don’t know, 10, 15, years. It was all us women making it—myself and Shonda and [producer] Ann Carli behind the camera, and Britney. But yes, I feel like it’s going to be received differently because at that point, she was such a gigantic pop star that people wanted to comment on that [instead of the movie]. Now, I feel like you can see it as this incredible friendship film. I just was really blown away by the feeling that I got watching it—how important female friendships are.\n\nI read that you initially turned down the film and were reticent about making a Britney Spears vehicle. What changed your mind about her and the project itself?\n\nMy agents were like, “Oh, we don’t think you should do it.” I was friends with Ann Carli, I knew her from Jive Records, and she said, “Why don’t you just go and meet her?” So I was like, “Okay, that sounds fun. A free ticket to Las Vegas and get to meet Britney Spears? Yeah, that’s cool.” So she opened the door at 10 in the morning wearing underwear and a T-shirt, and was just like, “Man, I was hammered last night.” And I was like, “What? Who’s this? You’re Britney Spears?”\n\nI spent the whole day with her and watched her go from this girl that’s from the South, and I knew who that girl was, to Britney Spears. She had to get dressed for some big event that night, the VMA Awards or something. And I fell in love with her. She told me that she really wanted to control her image, she wanted to do the rehearsals. She said, “I’ll do anything you say.” She really made a gigantic commitment [that] she would let all of this go and just focus on the movie.\n\nThe film reflects a lot of Britney’s personal life at the time, from singing an ’NSync song in the convertible to having her sister, Jamie Lynn, play the younger version of her character. Were those elements woven in to make Britney feel more comfortable in her first film?\n\nI think so. She was really close with her sister and her mom during the film. I respected and loved that, of course, and her sister looked exactly like her. And the thing with Justin [Timberlake], that was super fun. They were dating at the time, and I loved their relationship. But also, it’s so interesting that at that time with music, it really was this huge debate between end of the ’90s rock music, which then goes into all the girls were like, “We want to hear ’NSync and have fun.” So, it really was a battle of the airwaves. It was like Blink 182 versus Backstreet Boys.\n\nYou once said that nothing happened on the film “without making sure Brit was happy with it.” What element of production did you differ the most on?\n\nIt had to do with her record [“I’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman”]. This was a record specifically about going from this teen to a woman. And so that’s what the film was about. That was what she had told Shonda. So most of those discussions happened before me. The things that I struggled with the most was—Shonda, this was her first film. She was on path to be a director. Ann was going to work with her and she was going to direct a movie starring Jada [Pinkett Smith]. So she really had a lot of strong ideas, and she and I come from very different places. I’m very visual and street, and I’ve worked my way up to get to where I was. And she was this incredibly educated, smart woman that was really strong and had a very specific viewpoint even at that time and age. So it was just more trying to make sure that Shonda and I were on the same page and everything that happened, she and I had to agree with.\n\nBritney really wanted to be part of the ensemble. I think that she wanted to let go of all the power and just be part of this group and really work on that craft. So she didn’t really come on as like, “Well, I see it this way.” This was all new to her, so she was incredibly wonderful and open to direction.\n\nI’m not sure if you’ve seen it yet, but in a newly released excerpt from her book, Britney writes about going Method for the movie and says that she felt so immersed in the process that it made her wary about putting herself through that again for another role. Did you get a sense of this feeling while working with her?\n\nYes, and I can’t wait to hear what she says because for me, I didn’t want her to act. Acting was what she learned on The Mickey Mouse Club. So when I hung out with her and Taryn and Zoe, it was [like] playing with better tennis players. Let’s put you around people that are really good actors like Taryn and Zoe and Anson [Mount]. It would’ve been weird to have somebody fake acting with Taryn Manning, who I almost said no to because I was like, “She’s amazing, but I need an actor. I don’t need a girl that’s really the girl.” And my sister’s like, “She’s acting right now.” I was like, “Oh, my God.”\n\nSo I felt like the more I got to know Britney, the more I got to put her on the camera. I wanted to get the authentic version of her. And so when I rewatched it in the last couple weeks, I was so moved because I knew that’s what I was doing. But it was really intense when she’s sitting on the bed talking to her father about how she missed out on being a teenager. That’s her crying, telling us that longing that she missed out on everything. That’s really her. When she’s crying on the bathroom floor of that rejection [by her mother], we had to get to her, really her. She’s not acting in the movie. So it’s so curious to hear that she saw that too, that I was really making her feel and be that character. Because she couldn’t be Britney.\n\nShe was at such a professional peak. Did you find it difficult to pierce the wall of people that helped control her image, to build trust with her?\n\nI’m so grateful for somebody like Ann, because right in the very beginning she put her foot down and was like, “The moment I have you on this set, you’re no longer Britney Spears.” I had the support of the producers, and the film had Britney and [record executive] Clive Davis behind it. They supported those decisions so that we really could shut out the world of Britney. It really made it a big difference.\n\nI remember watching the Madonna documentary, and you see that when you are the top banana, everybody does everything you want to do. And that’s not what it’s like on a movie. So we needed to get her to the place where when she came on set, she was just like all of us. I love set life, because you feel like you’re at a giant summer camp most of the time. There shouldn’t be one top person that runs it, because it just wrecks it. And I just love after the film, when they’re doing the B-roll of “Overprotected” and you cut away and see who she was at that time—how relaxed and fun. I just love seeing that part of her.\n\nKim Cattrall is so delicious as Britney’s mother in the film. But is it true that Madonna was floated for that role?\n\nIt’s probably internet lore. We talked about who we love. We love Britney, and I love Madonna. So to open the film with her dancing in her bedroom [to Madonna’s “Open Your Heart”], and just the celebration of girl culture, that’s what we do—we close our bedroom door, we play around. I love that. To me, it’s my female gaze saying, this is what girls are like. I love that. And of course, Britney was super into that.\n\nWith Kim Cattrall, we all loved Sex and the City. That’s legendary. So we asked Kim if she could be in the film, but it was also a real risk for her. And I think that’s also what Kim liked, is she’s not playing a good character. It’s super harsh. You’re playing a mom who rejects somebody, and it’s really intense. So I really liked the bravery that she had to do a role like that. Not all mothers are…Sometimes you don’t want your past to come back to you, and it’s threatening.\n\nAnother thing I was struck by is that the film’s main twist is identical to the one at the center of Big Little Lies season one. Has anyone ever brought that up to you?\n\nNo! Maybe [Big Little Lies] author Liane Moriarty is a Crossroads fan [laughs]. But that’s freaking Shonda Rhimes, she’s brilliant. Look at her career afterwards. She is incredible. I was so struck when I watched it, about how you start to unfold these secrets that these girls hold. But that takes time. It doesn’t just happen immediately. So by the end of the film, how the friendship really builds and comes back together, I just was really impressed with that. That’s Shonda showing us her complexity of female characters and that it takes time to unfold.\n\nAnd you had to fight for the scene where Lucy loses her virginity to Ben, right?\n\nMe and Sherry Lansing [then Paramount chairman], we did a screening, she said, “I have a suggestion. Let’s look at the movie if we take out that scene.” And I was like,\n\n“What? The whole reason Britney made this movie is because of that scene.” And it’s done so tastefully that if you’re a child, you almost have no idea what’s going on. I did it super choreographed. I knew that I would have backup from Britney, everybody would back me up. I fought for that scene. It would’ve been so silly to take it out. We screened the film with the female audience after [our conversation] with that scene. And my scores were so high that Sherry let me keep it in.\n\nAs fun as the film is, there’s also a sadness in knowing what Britney would experience in the years after. In the past, you believed that Britney’s conservatorship prevented the two of you from reconnecting in a real way. Now that it’s over, have you been in contact?\n\nNo. We’ve been in contact with her new manager, and I think she knows that I’m there for her. I totally respect however she wants to communicate. I knew that she couldn’t speak because of the SAG contract, but I just wanted to let her know that no matter what happened, I would be next to her so she wouldn’t have to do anything alone. And even knowing that she trusts me to go out and speak…I’d love to talk to her whenever she’s ready. But I totally respect wherever she is right now, and love her dearly.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed."
