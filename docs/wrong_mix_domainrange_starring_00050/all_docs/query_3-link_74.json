When Mitchieâs mother gets a job as the Camp Rock cook, Mitchie gets to go with her. Upon arriving at camp, Mitchie discovers the competition among the campers is tough, both in the classroom, and for the attention of Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), a teen pop star and this summerâs celebrity teacher. Shane, who is seeking inspiration for his own music, overhears Mitchie singing, but never sees her face. Haunted by her unique sound, he sets off to find the girl with the glass slipper voice as she confronts her fears and learns to step into the spotlight."
