        "text": "Attention to detail or overanalyzing…\n\nHoles, directed by Andrew Davis, is about Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf) who is sent to a detention camp and made to dig holes to build character. One particular hole is crucial to the plot because it possibly contains secrets and treasures. Visually, this hole needs to be differentiated from the many others in its surrounding. How? Oh look there’s a rock!\n\nThis rock is pulled out by Stanley and serves as a marker for this hole to both him and the audience. It’s a simple solution that works. The importance of this rock is established with two shots. One involves a stare down between Stanley and the rock. Each in their own frame. The other shot is a timelapse showing the rock and the hole remain undisturbed. Another layer of significance this rock has with the larger story is it’s connection to another character – Madame Zeroni.\n\nMadame Zeroni (Eartha Kitt) placed a curse on the Yelnats family because Stanley’s no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather didn’t hold his end of the deal with her. Madame Zeroni has a distinctive look from her wardrobe and especially her headband around her forehead. Her face with the headband seems to resemble the special rock. It would be a heck of a coincidence if this important prop serving as a marker for the important hole wasn’t thought about for awhile with the production team.\n\nThis is purely my opinion. If the propmaster, director, or production design team did this intentionally then bravo. This resemblance might be a stretch, but I cannot not see it. Refer to the image below and see for yourself."
