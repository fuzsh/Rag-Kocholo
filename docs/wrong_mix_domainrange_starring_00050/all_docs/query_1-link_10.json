She has liked and known Ron Stoppable, her sidekick, since preschool, but has completed missions with Wade, Monique, her brothers, and her mother. In So The Drama and season four, Kim and Ron develop romantic feelings for each other and begin dating during their senior year. She has a fiery and headstrong personality, yet uses her intelligence and sensibility to 'save the day'. Though she struggles with her rivalry with Bonnie and shyness around her crushes, she often acts maturely and as Ron's conscience. She has a good relationship with her family members, despite often being annoyed by her brothers and embarrassed by her parents' antics. Her name is a play on the word \"impossible.\"\n\nVoiced by: Will Friedle, Harrison Fahn (young)\n\nPortrayed by: Sean Giambrone\n\nA cowardly, clumsy, and accident-prone teenage boy who has been best friends with Kim since preschool. He serves as her sidekick during missions, but has saved the world on his own. He owns a pet naked mole-rat named Rufus who is best friends with him and Kim and often helps them on missions.[1][2][3][4] In interviews, co-creators Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle summed up Ron's role as comic relief until the finale as \"He can't do anything.\"[5] For instance, he is the subject of a running gag in which he tends to lose his pants. He is not as popular as Kim at school and is often ridiculed and ignored by his peers. However, he joins the football team during his senior year,[6] having previously served as team mascot, and is given the nickname of \"Unstoppable Stoppable\".[7] He has an adopted younger sister from Japan named Hana, who has mystical abilities of her own.\n\nHis favorite restaurant is Bueno Nacho and he is the creator of the \"Naco\", a combination of a nacho and taco. He has many fears, including monkeys and insects, though this lessens as he matures. He also demonstrates several talents, such as his culinary skills, Mystical Monkey Powers, and stealth, being able to sneak into villains' lairs. In So The Drama, he realizes he has romantic feelings toward Kim and later confesses to her. They go to prom together and have their first kiss as an official couple.\n\nAfter being turned evil in the episode \"Bad Boy\", he becomes the psychotic Zorpox the Conqueror, a name he came up with himself. As Zorpox, his personality is flipped and he is a big threat to anyone who crosses his path. When the Attitudinator turns him evil, over time his skin turned blue like Dr, Drakken. As a villain, he is shown to be skilled at using tools, building devices, multitasking and planning ahead. He is also shown to be capable of predicting Kim's actions, though this may be because he knows her well.\n\nEarly on in the series, Ron gains the Mystical Monkey Powers from a series of ancient totems while battling Monkey Fist, which grant him the ability to wield the mystical Lotus Blade; he is additionally prophesized to be the Ultimate Monkey Master. However, his control over these powers is intermittent, usually emerging in short bursts.\n\nIn season four, when they are officially dating, Ron struggles with insecurity regarding Kim. He even steals her super-suit to become school quarterback because of Bonnie's declaration that cheerleaders must date jocks. Though this backfires, he ends up as the football team's running back because of his \"mad running skills\", which he developed while on missions. Also in season four, Ron's family adopts a baby from Japan named Hana, who is his sister and has a mystical destiny, for which he must train her. During graduation, Ron is able to fully access his Mystical Monkey Powers and defeat Warhok and Warmonga when Kim and Shego together could not.\n\nMain article: Rufus (Kim Possible)\n\nVoiced by: Nancy Cartwright\n\nRon's pet, a naked mole-rat who often accompanies him on missions and whose small size and agility often prove useful. Rufus' origin began long before Ron purchased him, as when he was four years old, he had an imaginary friend named Rufus. Because of allergies, Ron's father would not allow him to have a pet with hair, so around sixth grade, he bought Rufus from a Smarty Mart.\n\nHe shares several things in common with his owner: his love of Bueno Nacho food, his ability to eat with disregard for what kind of food it is, a dislike for monkeys, and a laid-back, casual attitude. Unlike Ron, he has been known to abandon this attitude at crucial times and often uses quicker thinking than him. Rufus is often frustrated with Ron, but has stuck with him despite this. Rufus communicates with Ron through a series of squeaks and hisses, which Ron seems to understand. He also possesses Mystical Monkey Powers, as he was in Ron's pocket when he received his powers. He has never used them, but has displayed a greater degree of mastery of Yamanouchi ninja training and the ability to control the Lotus Blade.\n\nIn A Sitch In Time, a version of Rufus from the future named Rufus 3000 visits Kim and asks for her help in saving the future from Shego. He is able to talk with human speech (voiced by Michael Dorn) and refers to himself as Rufus 3000 because he is the 3000th version of the original \"Rufus Prime\". He is the leader of a team of genetically altered naked-mole rats, who, like himself, are muscular in appearance. He appears in the first two parts of A Sitch In Time as an ally and information provider to Kim, but assumes a main role in the final part, where he and the original Rufus lead his team of mole rats against Shego and her allies.\n\nVoiced by: Tahj Mowry,[8] Michael Clarke Duncan (future in Kim Possible: A Sitch In Time)\n\nPortrayed by: Issac Ryan Brown\n\nA 10-year-old genius who is skilled at programming and runs Kim Possible's website. He relays information and missions to her through her \"Kimmunicator,\" supplies her with various gadgets, such as her battle suit, and arranges her transportation. On rare occasions, he has gone on missions with Kim.[9][10] It is never explained how he met Kim and Ron and became their partner.\n\nAccording to Kim, Wade completed his high school and college education in eight months.[11] In the episode \"The Cupid Effect\", he develops a crush on Monique and creates a love ray to force her to be his girlfriend.[12] In the end, he learns his lesson and develops a crush on a girl named Olivia, but this does not work out as she also created a love ray, much to his chagrin.\n\nFor the first two seasons and most of the third season, Wade is never seen outside his room, until the episode \"Team Impossible\". When Team Impossible overloads his computer system with a power spike, he arrives to vent on the team's members. In the fourth season, Wade ventures out of his room to give Kim new inventions. He is the subject of a running gag in which he secretly placed a tracking microchip on Ron, but avoids answering when questioned about it.\n\nIn A Sitch in Time, future Wade, now a large muscular man, is the leader of the anti-Shego resistance.\n\nPortrayed by: Ciara Riley Wilson\n\nA female-form android who appears in the 2019 live-action film Kim Possible. She is an expert in bōjutsuka who Dr. Drakken built to befriend Kim and Ron before stealing the former's motivational essence and transferring it into him using his brain-modulating device. After Kim short-circuits the transfer machine, Dr. Drakken is de-aged into a pre-adolescent version of himself, and despite Kim's insistence that she save herself, Athena stays behind to turn off the now-unstable machine. The lair explodes and Athena is seemingly killed, but it is revealed that she survived the explosion. Kim and Ron take her home to be repaired and programmed to be a hero alongside them. She is based on Eric from So the Drama. While working with Kim and Ron, she uses an outfit based on the one Kim uses near the end of the series.\n\nAlong with Kim, Bonnie, and Tara, the other main cheerleaders at Middleton High include Crystal, Jessica, Liz, Hope, and Marcella. However, other cheerleaders are seen throughout the series, with some having taken part in First Squad practices and routines. With the exception of Bonnie, they subvert the common stereotype of school cheerleaders being mean, rude and snobby.\n\nVoiced by: Kirsten Storms, Kelly Ripa (future version in Kim Possible: A Sitch In Time)\n\nPortrayed by: Erika Tham\n\nKim's classmate at Middleton High School and her rival, who has a superior attitude toward her, Ron, and people in general, who she sees as beneath her. She is concerned with the high school's \"food chain\", and sees Kim's popularity and position as cheerleading captain as a threat to her position. In addition to hanging out with the popular seniors, she has an on-again, off-again relationship with the football team's star quarterback, Brick Flagg, who she dates for his status. She later dates Hirotaka and then Señor Senior Junior, who is her boyfriend for the remainder of the series.\n\nThroughout the series, Bonnie constantly challenges Kim's position, both in routines and as captain. In \"Number One,\" she works hard to gain enough popularity to become the new captain. However, after Kim casts her vote in support of Bonnie's bid and explains how hard work as a captain is, Bonnie has second thoughts. It is unknown how long she remains captain before handing the position back to Kim, but since then she does not seek the position as often, but still angles for prominence in routines.\n\nBonnie has two older sisters, Lonnie and Connie, who frequently pick on her. They only appear in the episode, \"Bonding\", where it is implied that Bonnie's attitude stems from their cruelty. The mother of the Rockwaller sisters only appears in the episode, \"Downhill\", where she is shown to be a source of embarrassment for Bonnie, as she is humiliated when her mother calls her \"Pumpkin\" and \"Bon-Bon\". However, Ron is highly amused by this, and teasingly calls Bonnie \"Bon-Bon\".\n\nDespite being mean to Ron and often calling him \"loser\", she calls him \"hottie\" when he briefly becomes a multimillionaire in \"Ron Millionaire\". But at the start of the fourth season, she advises Kim to dump Ron, claiming it is practically a rule for cheerleaders to date jocks. In \"Homecoming Upset\", she cheats in the election to become Homecoming queen when Ron is elected king, but Ron rejects her advances due to dating Kim, causing Bonnie to forcefully kiss him. When Kim confronts her, Bonnie breaks down and reveals that Brick broke up with her, but Kim promises to help her find a new boyfriend. As a result, she begins dating Señor Senior Junior.\n\nAt the end of the series, Bonnie is revealed to be the only senior in Kim and Ron's class who is unable to graduate, due to missing an important pop quiz a week before graduation and leaving her one credit short. She had also blown off all her classes during the last week of school because she believed that nothing important happens during that time. As a result, she has to go to summer school to graduate, which she is initially upset about, but cheers up after Junior tells her he would be there in spirit.\n\nThough neither likes to admit it, she and Kim make a good team, utilizing their knowledge and skills as cheerleaders to best stronger enemies. This can be seen in Gill's defeat in \"Sink or Swim\" and in \"Bonding\", where they get stuck together and Kim is forced to take Bonnie with her on a mission, and they best Dementor with their acrobatics.\n\nVoiced by: Patrick Warburton\n\nPortrayed by: Michael P. Northey\n\nReferred to as \"Mr Barkin\" in credits\n\nA teacher at Middleton High who previously worked at Smarty Mart and as a football coach, and also served in an unspecified war where he achieved the rank of lieutenant. He frequently chaperones for field trips and school events and refers to students by their last names. Additionally, he is the subject of a running gag where he is the substitute teacher for many subjects, even those he is unfamiliar with. He is the son of Franklin Barkin, who resembles Benjamin Franklin. In \"Graduation,\" he indicates that he was like Ron at one point, saving the world while staying on top of things, but it did not work out for him. Like Ron, Mr. Barkin has many fears, and the two seem to share a frenemy type of relationship. He is skeptical of Ron's investment in shared activities like football, the Pixie Scouts, and the Middleton Days Festival. However, he treats him with respect when the two have a common interest or goal.\n\nVoiced by: Raven-Symoné, Vivica A. Fox (future in A Sitch in Time)\n\nA girl whose surname is never revealed, which is possibly a reference to her voice actress, Raven-Symoné, who is generally known by her first name. Her design evolves over the seasons, with the most notable change being to her eyes, which go from small to wider and fuller.\n\nMonique is smart and hip, and usually speaks in a style which Kim describes as \"Monique-speak\". She also likes to talk in acronyms, such as \"NBF\" (new best friend) and \"GF\" (girlfriend). Little is known about her family or personal life, but she complains of having bad luck with boyfriends. Additionally, it is mentioned in A Sitch in Time that she has a brother who gets her hooked on wrestling and a father who plays golf. She is considered Kim's best female friend, giving her level-headed advice about school and life and serving as a counterbalance to Ron's eccentricities. Despite lacking fighting skills, she sometimes assists Kim on her missions, and her passion and expertise in fashion are important in designing Kim's new uniform.\n\nVoiced by: Rider Strong\n\nA boy who is the star quarterback of the Middleton High School football team. Despite being the stereotypical \"dumb jock\", he is a nice guy who does not pick fights with others, except in the episode \"Exchange\", when he confronts Japanese exchange student Hirotaka. In the episode \"Homecoming Upset\", Mr. Barkin mentioned that it took Brick seven years to graduate high school.\n\nBonnie Rockwaller is his on-again, off-again girlfriend for most of the second and third seasons. His love interests during their off- periods include Kim, Amelia, and Monique, the latter briefly reciprocating his love in So the Drama. However, in \"Homecoming Upset\", it is revealed he dumped Bonnie before graduating and tells Ron he has no intention of resuming a relationship with her, causing Ron to remark that \"college has actually made him smarter.\"\n\nHe makes a brief cameo in A Sitch in Time as one of Shego's slaves, with this version of him being overweight and unhygienic.\n\nVoiced by: A.J. Trauth\n\nKim's former love interest and crush, who Ron dislikes since his last name is similar to the word monkey and is jealous of because of Kim's crush. He has an easygoing and laid-back personality and is an artist and musician, and therefore is popular among the students. In season three, it is revealed that Josh and Kim went their separate ways, and he is seen with Tara for some time.\n\nVoiced by: Jason Marsden\n\nRon's friend, an easygoing boy who enjoys video games and basketball despite being paralyzed from the waist down. His mother, a cyber-robotics employee at the Middleton space center, built his wheelchair and engineered it to handle his basic needs. This gives Felix the ability to do things most people are incapable of, such as flying around. In the beginning, Kim's efforts were repeatedly met with failure, as while playing basketball with Felix, she insistently tells Ron that he \"can't win\". However, Ron misses the point she is making that he should not win against someone with a handicap, and replies that he needs more focus. Eventually, after being inspired by Ron's mellow attitude and discovering that Felix is capable of handling life from a wheelchair, she relaxes.\n\nFelix is a good friend who supports Ron in the two episodes he plays a major role in, \"Motor Ed\" and \"Steal Wheels\", which both involve Motor Ed. He claims he could have handled Kim the first time had Felix not interfered, and Felix's wheelchair's capabilities prove essential to success.\n\nIn the series finale, \"Graduation\", Felix is shown as class valedictorian and dating Zita Flores.\n\nVoiced by: Gary Cole\n\nPortrayed by: Matthew Clarke\n\nReferred to as \"Father\" in credits\n\nKim, Jim, and Tim's father, who is an astrophysicist and rocket scientist. His full name is revealed by Big Daddy Brotherson in So the Drama. It is revealed in season four he was a graduate of MIST, or the Middleton Institute of Science and Technology. In the Lilo & Stitch crossover episode Rufus, Kim mentions that James \"knows the senator of Hawaii\". He does not like when Kim is with boys, but approves of her relationship with Ron.\n\nVoiced by: Jean Smart\n\nPortrayed by: Alyson Hannigan\n\nReferred to as \"Mother\" in credits\n\nKim, Jim, and Tim's mother, who is a caring and understanding mother to Kim. She is a neurosurgeon and is usually referred to as a brain surgeon in the series. Her name is revealed to be Ann in \"Graduation\". It is revealed in season four that she was a graduate of the University of Upperton. In the episode \"Mother's Day\", she goes on a mission with Kim and saves her from being swallowed by a glob of green goo, using her Kimmunicator to attack it with high-frequency pulses. She is the subject of a running gag in which when Kim calls her for advice, she is currently in surgery. However, she manages to talk with her, though Kim feels disgusted about it.\n\nVoiced by: Shaun Fleming (first voice), Spencer Fox (second voice), Freddie Prinze Jr. (future in A Sitch in Time)\n\nPortrayed by: Owen and Connor Fielding\n\nKim's younger twin brothers, who often annoy her; she often refers to them as the tweebs (twin dweebs). They are named after their father. Because of their youth at the beginning of the series, they often do not consider the consequences of their actions, such as being injured after trying to imitate one of Adrena Lynn's extreme stunts. Their catchphrase is in the twinspeak language they invented, with one saying \"Hicka-bicka-boo\", followed by the response \"Hooo-Sha\". When Kim is a senior, the two go to Middleton High School because they skipped grades. They later become the Middleton Pep Puppies after Ron joins the football team and can no longer be their mascot, which he is initially unhappy but ultimately accepts.\n\nThroughout the series, they display a talent for inventing and often use Kim's stuff to create their own inventions, and also help her fix and upgrade the beat-up car her dad gave her. Despite their obvious intellect, Kim has trouble seeing them as anything more than annoying goof-offs and believes them incapable of some accomplishments. This includes building a hand-held Silicon Phase Disruptor, which Dr. Drakken and other scientists believed to be impossible, or skipping grades to enter Middleton High as freshmen at the age of thirteen. However, Kim has shown both affection and appreciation for them and their skills.\n\nVoiced by: Debbie Reynolds\n\nPortrayed by: Connie Ray\n\nKim, Jim, Tim, and Joss's paternal grandmother and Larry's maternal grandmother. She is first mentioned in the episode \"Downhill\" and first appears in \"The Golden Years\", where she initially seems to be the typical grandmother, but it turns out she is as skilled at fighting as Kim, if not more so. She trained in \"Pang Lang Quan Kung Fu\" in a Shaolin Monastery and was a top aviator and the first woman to finish the Navy's Basic Underwater Demolition Course. She also mentions fighting in the Vietnam War when she was a teenager, meaning she was born in 1939, 1940, 1941, or 1942. Her husband is unknown.\n\nVoiced by: Brian Posehn\n\nKim, Jim, and Tim's cousin and Ron's friend. He is an avid computer geek and loves video games, and has a slight crush on Bonnie, who he compares to the Queen in one of his games. His last name is never given, so it is unknown which side of the family he comes from. However, as shown in \"Attack of the Killer Bebes\" there is only one \"Possible\" in the Middleton phone book, which suggests that either his surname is not Possible or that his family does not live in Middleton.\n\nVoiced by Mary Jo Catlett\n\nKim, Jim, and Tim's aunt and Larry's mother. She loves her son, but seemingly does not understand his interests. When she witnesses villains fighting, she fails to comprehend what is happening.\n\nVoiced by: Tara Strong\n\nKim, Jim, and Tim's cousin on their father's side and the daughter of \"Slim\" Possible. She makes only a single in-person appearance in the show.[13] Initially, she goes overboard with hero-worshipping Kim, causing her to feel uncomfortable around her. However, by the end of Kim's visit to the Lazy C Ranch, Joss has shifted her focus onto Ron, having recognized the true value of courage, as he heads into dangerous situations despite his fear.\n\nVoiced by: Kevin Michael Richardson\n\nJames Possible's older brother, Joss's father, and Kim, Jim, and Tim's uncle. Much to James' distaste, he refers to his younger brother by a childhood nickname of \"squirt\". He is also very fond of Ann Possible. The whereabouts of his wife, Joss's mother, are never addressed. He appears in \"Showdown at the Crooked D\" and \"Graduation\". A cowboy by choice and lifestyle, he owns the Lazy C Ranch in Montana, but instead of having organic livestock, he has \"cybertronic\" robotic horses. There is also a high-tech control center connected to a system of launched satellites. One summer, Dr. Drakken had set an evil scheme in motion at a neighboring property called the Crooked D Ranch, which the Possible Clan was able to thwart.\n\nRon's family, composed of his father, his mother, and later on his adopted little sister Hana.\n\nVoiced by: Elliott Gould\n\nRon and Hana's father, who works as an actuary. Because of his allergy to pet fur, Ron was never allowed to have a pet until he bought Rufus. Ron once wanted to be an actuary, but Mr. Stoppable showed him how risk could lead to rewards.[14] He also shows his skills in \"Mathter and Fervent\", when he uses his actuarial skills to defeat the math villain terrorizing Ron, and tells him \"I did the math.\" As a result, he becomes the subject of Ron's hero paper, which gets an \"A+\" from Mr. Barkin, who states that \"Your dad rocks!\"[15]\n\nVoiced by: Andrea Martin\n\nRon and Hana's mother, who seems to have a distant relationship with Ron. Her job is unknown, but it is shown in A Sitch in Time that she had to relocate to Norway to be closer to the home office. Like Mr. Stoppable, she breaks news to her son by telling him later. Their catchphrase is: \"This is our way of telling you.\"[16]\n\nVoiced by: Grey DeLisle\n\nRon's adopted baby sister, who is Japanese and whose name is Japanese for \"flower\". She is seemingly from the Yamanouchi Clan, as Sensei brokered the adoption, and Yori later claimed that Hana was \"like a sister\".[17] At first, Ron is resentful of her and how his parents sprung her on him as a surprise, before discovering she is a prophesized weapon called The Han. He eventually warms up to her and fully accepts his role as her big brother. Her mystical and martial arts skills develop over time, until she finally defeats Yono the Destroyer in \"Oh No, Yono\". As an adopted member of the family, she is most likely raised Jewish.\n\nVoiced by: Tara Strong.\n\nRon and Hana's seven-year-old cousin, who often causes trouble for Ron at family events. He owns a pet iguana who has tried to eat Rufus several times. Ron's complaints about him have mostly been ignored, likely because Shaun is younger. Ron is unable to ditch him until Kim agrees to be his date at his cousin Reuben's wedding, thus sparing him from having to sit at \"the kid's table\". Ron also resorts to using the Attitudinator device to make Shaun less annoying and more polite.\n\nThe bridegroom at the wedding in \"Bad Boy\", who appears while pulling his bride, Miss Starter (voiced by Grey DeLisle) to safety. He is a cousin of Ron and Hana, but it is unknown which side of the family he comes from. However, since the wedding is specified as \"the Stoppable-Starter wedding\", he is presumably from the father's side.\n\nKim and Ron's possible ancestors, seen during a shared dream sequence.\n\nAccording to the episode, Miriam, or \"Mim\" for short, is a highly respected reporter for the turn-of-the-century Middleton's local newspaper. However, while she was reporting on the science exhibition at the world's fair, the \"Electro-Static Illuminator\" was stolen, and she was blamed for the theft. It was not until Kim heard about her \"black sheep\" ancestor that it is revealed she was framed for the theft by the ancestors of Shego and Dr. Drakken, Miss Go and Bartholomew Lipsky. Mim's closest friend, Jonathan \"Jon\" Stoppable was a detective, who like Ron was clumsy and scatterbrained. He was the only person who believed that Mim was innocent, and he tried desperately but unsuccessfully, to prove her innocence. Jon was also the biggest and only fan of the taco when it was first unveiled at the fair, which parallels Ron's love for Bueno Nacho fast food.\n\nJon Stoppable makes two appearances other than \"Rewriting History\". He is seen holding a test tube as part of a Middleton Days float in \"Emotion Sickness\", and Ron, dressed as Jon, is seen during a faux-flashback by Ron during \"Ron Millionaire\", which also shows Kim dressed as Miriam.\n\nWhile the ending of the episode showed Kim and Ron waking from the shared dream in the Tri-City Museum, Kim's clothing was not the same as at the beginning of the episode. This means the episode opened with the dream already in progress and, though a float with Jon's likeness was seen outside of the episode, the existence of the other \"ancestral\" characters, including Mim, is debatable.\n\nVoiced by: Roz Ryan\n\nWade's mother, who appears sporadically throughout the series. Her most notable appearance is in the episode \"Mother's Day\", when Wade treats her to a celebration in his room with takeout French cuisine and a holographic beach.\n\nWade's father, who is occasionally mentioned in the series, but never physically appears. His name, Lontaine, was mentioned by Wade's mother in \"The Cupid Effect\". In \"Crush\", his socks are stated as being integral to Wade's super-stink formula.\n\nVoiced by: Jennifer Hale (Connie), Grey DeLisle (Lonnie)\n\nBonnie Rockwaller's older sisters, who are first mentioned in \"Hidden Talent\" when Bonnie mentions her \"older sibs\" having won the Middleton High talent show the previous four years in a row. They make their first physical appearance in \"Bonding\", where it is implied that Bonnie's attitude may stem from their treatment of her; they claim that Connie \"got all the brains\", Lonnie \"got all the looks\", while Bonnie \"got the rest\". Their interactions with each other, moving and speaking in sync and finishing each other's sentences, hint they might be fraternal twins.\n\nVoiced by: Felicity Huffman\n\nThe head of the worldwide espionage organization known as the Global Justice Network (GJ). She is in charge of addressing threats to the world that fall outside the scope of normal law enforcement groups. However, she calls upon Kim for help since even a high-tech organization requires help from time to time. However, since the GJ is a top-secret organization, this has to be handled discreetly, such as sucking Kim into a trap door through a series of transport tubes or arranging a phony crime to lure her to a meeting site. She first introduces Kim to the Global Justice Network in a case that leads to Kim's first encounter with Duff Killigan. She later calls in Kim and Ron to assess a phenomenon GJ scientists dub \"the Ron Factor\", in which Ron's chaotic nature is the real reason for Kim's success in saving the world. Dr. Director wants to see if GJ could harness that chaos, but it is eventually deemed as a \"non-factor\". She mostly stays behind the scenes, but Kim has other dealings with Global Justice, usually in the form of rides to her destinations and backup on missions.\n\nAs the head of a global organization, she has very little hands-on involvement in GJ's cases, but has shown she can hold her own in a fight. She is determined to bring down Gemini and his organization, WEE (the Worldwide Evil Empire), but their conflict is more like sibling rivalry run amok. She is instantly recognizable by her eyepatch, reminiscent of the Marvel Comics character, Nick Fury. Gemini also wears one, and his name is also a reference to Nick Fury, whose brother became the villain Scorpio.\n\nVoiced by: (in order) Gary Dourdan, Eric Close, and Adam Rodriguez\n\nThe three members of Team Impossible, who are first mentioned in \"A Sitch in Time\" by Mr. McHenry, who, in need of aid, tries to summon them on their website, but due to a typo receives Kim's help instead. They charge anyone they save a lot of money. Eventually, the team tries to stop Kim from saving the world by removing all of her transportation and unknowingly spike Wade's computer when he tries to trace them. When Kim and Ron arrive, Team Impossible decide to deal with them personally. After threatening them, Wade manages to convince them to join Global Justice and become non-profit.\n\nDash appears to be the team leader, and is a survival specialist and multilingual.\n\nCrash is the team's driver, and is also skilled in emergency medicine.\n\nBurn is the team's accountant, who claims that he crunches a lot more than numbers. After the team became non-profit, Burn aided James Possible in doing taxes.\n\nVoiced by: B. D. Wong\n\nThe top agent of Global Justice, who takes his job as an agent of Global Justice seriously, but seemingly does not realize he is not particularly good at it. He is well educated and speaks fourteen languages. Dr. Director brought him on to work alongside Kim when she is recruited to rescue a former weapons researcher from Duff Killigan. Will particularly resents this assignment, since he sees world saving as a \"professional's\" job and does not appreciate an \"amateur\" like Kim interfering with it. This caused Kim no end of grief, since she spends more time fighting with Will than with Killigan himself. However, they eventually manage to work together and stop Killigan from turning the entire world into his own private golf course.\n\nYamanouchi is a secret ninja school, located atop a mountain in Japan. It was founded by Toshimiru, a master of Tai Sheng Pek Kwar, better known as Monkey Kung Fu. He carved the school out of the mountain using only a single weapon: a shapeshifting sword called the Lotus Blade. Since its creation in 338 AD, the school has guarded the blade, which can only fully be used in the hands of one who has been touched by Mystical Monkey Power.[18]\n\nVoiced by: George Takei\n\nThe Headmaster of Yamanouchi, who is the traditional \"wise old master\" archetype and is quite powerful as a martial artist despite his small stature. He possesses a wide range of abilities as a result of his many years of training and experience. Additionally, he seemingly possesses spiritual abilities, such as astral projection and the ability to levitate. Despite these skills, he prefers not involving himself directly in conflicts unless necessary.\n\nHe initially arranged for Ron to be part of the transfer program to Japan to bring him to Yamanouchi and protect the Lotus Blade from Monkey Fist. He was also arranged the adoption of Ron's new baby sister Hana to prepare for her eventual showdown with Yono the Destroyer. During the Lorwardian invasion, Sensei apparently senses what is coming and tries to warn Ron about it, but Ron misunderstands his message. Later, he appears to Ron when Kim and Shego are knocked out and helps him get the courage to master his dormant Mystical Monkey Powers. He also informs him of his role as the Ultimate Monkey Master and assures him it is his destiny, which he is now ready for.\n\nVoiced by: Keiko Agena\n\nA student from Yamanouchi and a highly skilled ninja. She is calm, even in dangerous situations, and kind, to the point of showing more concern for others than for herself. She first appears in the episode \"Exchange\" when she is sent to receive Ron and guide him to the Yamanouchi School, and while helping him develops a strong bond with him.\n\nShe is a reliable fighter, but has demonstrated a preference to act as a subordinate rather than a leader; she has also shown the typical Japanese value of teamwork over individuality. She is a better fighter than Kim, as in \"Oh No! Yono!\", when Yono the Destroyer turns Kim to stone, he is unable to petrify Yori. Since her introduction, she has appeared as a potential love interest for Ron, piquing his romantic interest at first sight and gradually developing romantic feelings for him. This is confirmed in her second appearance in the episode \"Gorilla Fist\", where Ron is oblivious to her feelings for him. In the fourth season, Ron begins dating Kim, but Yori approves of their relationship, stating that Kim and Ron have a destiny together. A running gag is that Yori often talks about honor, to Ron's chagrin. For instance, when he faces a long walk and asks for a ride, Yori says that it was \"his honor to walk\".\n\nA family and team of superheroes who protect Go City, who are also Shego's brothers. They got their powers after a multi-hued \"comet\"-like object crashed into their tree house when they were young. The team originally had five members, as Shego was once a member until she quit and turned to villainy; go is the number five in Japanese. Their names are based on personal pronouns, with \"go\" added at the end. They first appear in the episode \"Go Team Go\" during season two, and later return in season four in \"Stop Team Go\" and \"Mathter and Fervent\", the latter features only Hego. They reside in Go Tower, a building designed around the letters \"G\" and \"O\", which may be an allusion to the Teen Titans's Titan Tower. Like Kim, they have a set of supervillains they regularly fight, such as Aviarius, The Mathter, and Electronique.\n\nVoiced by: Christopher McDonald\n\nThe oldest of the siblings, who is practically the leader of the group and has the power of super strength. His personality is similar to Superman's, as he is the most overtly \"super-heroic\" of the group, but he can also be bossy. Like Superman, he has an alter ego as a Bueno Nacho manager with black hair and glasses that resemble his glasses as Clark Kent. He tends to make jokes and puns—such as calling Team Go's teamwork \"Go-operation\" and saying \"Looks like this bird is ready for his cage\" every time he captures Aviarius—and appears to be unable to tell when they fall flat. He sincerely believes that despite her actions, Shego is still a good person, only to be proven wrong when she betrays and attacks him. As a result of his behavior, Hego is seemingly the brother Shego is most annoyed by. In fact, after only five minutes in Hego's presence, Ron says: \"I'm starting to see why Shego split.\"\n\nVoiced by: Jere Burns\n\nThe second oldest brother after Hego, who has the power to shrink at will. His power combined with his coloration is similar to Shrinking Violet of the Legion of Super-Heroes. His name may also be a reference to the Mego Corporation's line of 8-inch action figures. He possesses a large ego and is rather defensive of his seemingly useless power. After the team reunites, he expresses a desire to be the leader. His attitude is like that Shego because of his self-absorbed nature, but she still gets annoyed at his ego.\n\nVoiced by: Fred Savage\n\nTwins who are the youngest of the group and tend to finish each other's sentences; they are also happy-go-lucky, taking things in stride. They have red skin, but it is closer to ruddy skin tones compared to Mego and Shego's extreme and distinctive skin colors. They have the power to duplicate themselves. It is unclear if they were born twins or if they were originally only one person who became two people in the impact event which gave them their superpowers. Shego has displayed less annoyance with the twins than the rest of her family, even working alongside Hego and Mego to save them.\n\nVoiced by: Sherri Shepherd\n\nA rapper loosely based on female rappers like Queen Latifah and MC Lyte. She gives Kim a ride in her yacht as thanks for retrieving her demo tape when it was stolen in \"Hidden Talent\"'. She reappears in \"Rappin' Drakken\" and \"Trading Faces\"; in the latter, Camille Leon frames her for theft.\n\nVoiced by: Tara Strong\n\nA teen pop-music sensation who has her own line of merchandise, including a magazine and dolls. Like most pop singers, she is fodder for tabloids and is notable for her relationships; she has dated Oh Boyz! singer Nicky Nick, but they have since broken up. As her name indicates, Britina is an allusion to real-life pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, and her relationship with Nicky Nick is reminiscent of that of Spears and Justin Timberlake.\n\nKim once helped Britina when her show in Chicago caught fire, so she, like others Kim has helped, gives her rides to missions. She reappears in \"Trading Faces\", where Kim helps to clear her name after Camille Leon frames her for theft and she is arrested, and in \"Queen Bebe\", when a shortage of Britina dolls nearly causes a worldwide panic among pre-teen girls.\n\nVoiced by: Clyde Kusatsu (Nakusumi), Lauren Tom (Miss Kyoko)\n\nNakasumi is the top toy developer in the world, and Miss Kyoko is his secretary and personal assistant. He is the victim of theft by Dr. Drakken and Shego in \"Crush\", but Kim recovers what was stolen, and in return, Nakasumi gives her a ride in \"A Very Possible Christmas\" and So the Drama. At first, it appears Nakasumi can understand yet is unable to speak English, but it is later revealed he can speak English, but prefers whispering in Miss Kyoko's ear. One of Nakasumi's characters, Z-Boy, makes several cameos as toys and posters.\n\nVoiced by: Carly Pope and Tara Strong\n\nA minor character seen in seasons one and two. She is a senior who is implied to be the school's beauty queen, and presumably graduates after season two. She constantly brushes off Ron's attempts at flirting, but welcomes him into her popular circle during the episodes \"All the News\" and \"The New Ron\", and accepts money from him in \"Ron Millionaire\". In the episode \"Animal Attraction\", she turns out to be a red otter and her soul mate is the pink sloth, Ron's animal. In \"All the News\" it is mentioned she briefly dated – and dumped – Brick Flagg.\n\nCamp Wannaweep's mascot.[1][3] He is only seen in flashbacks describing Ron's unpleasant experiences at the camp.\n\nVoiced by: Enrico Colantoni\n\nA selfish inventor who developed the Moodulators and Mind Control Chips, both of which affect Kim and Shego in \"The Twin Factor\" and \"Emotion Sickness\". Though he seems to have no evil intentions, his inventions have wreaked havoc in Kim and Ron's lives, something that does not stop Kim from using them on her brothers. Considering there is no stated purpose for making the Mind Control Chips and that the Moodulators have been sold in online auctions to the highest-bidding \"government agency\", he appears to be mainly motivated by money. The fact that others have used his inventions, usually Dr. Drakken, to commit crime is never addressed, and he is not shown facing any consequences for this. He is somewhat disorganized, as seen in \"Emotion Sickness\" when he fails to notice the presence of the Kimmunicator in his lab until it took off.\n\nVoiced by: Shawnee Smith\n\nAn intelligent and beautiful woman who is a notable robotics authority and has a doctorate. She is suspected of stealing a project from the Middleton Space Center, but turns out to be innocent when it is revealed her research was stolen by her co-worker Dr. Fen. She hid her true identity behind her initials as \"Doctor V. F. Porter\" because in the past, she was not taken seriously as a female scientist. Chief among her inventions is Oliver, a bearding robotic \"boyfriend\", which, like the rest of her projects, is equipped with advanced technology such as artificial intelligence. In the end, she is offered a job at the Middleton Space Center's robotics lab by James Possible.\n\nVoiced by: Rob Paulsen\n\nA French hairstylist who cuts and styles Ron's hair in \"The New Ron\". He later appears in \"Rufus in Show\", when he lends Kim and Ron his prize-winning pedigree poodle when they need to infiltrate an exclusive dog show, and in \"Two to Tutor\" as one of the targets of a string of heists committed by Shego and Señor Senior Junior.\n\nVoiced by: Brian Tochi\n\nA tall and handsome Japanese exchange student who appears in \"Exchange\" as Ron goes to Japan in his place. He owns a sport motorcycle and quickly gains popularity amongst girls, leading to a confrontation with Brick Flagg, who wins using secret Yamanouchi ninja skills. Intrigued that Kim knows Mantis style Kung Fu, he engages in a brief sparring of styles with her, leaving Kim winded. Both Kim and Monique develop crushes on him and fight over him, but later reconcile after learning he considers Bonnie his \"number one girlfriend\".\n\nVoiced by: Eddie Deezen\n\nA man who works at Middleton Bueno Nacho store #582 as assistant manager, although he was once demoted and Ron promoted in his place. He is interested in Robot Rumble, comic books, and role-playing games. He also has a sharp sense of fashion and seems to be friends with Ron.\n\nVoiced by: Wendie Malick\n\nA famous fashion critic with her own television fashion report program, which Monique is a fan of. She knows \"what's hot and what is not... what's here today, and gone tomorrow\" and is an influential authority on fashion, even influencing Club Banana. She was inspired by the aesthetics of Kim's mission clothes to create the \"KimStyle\" , which became a nationwide clothing sensation, including spin-off clothing lines \"KimForHim\" and one for pets. After being made fun of for being unable to pull off her own look, Kim wanted the fad to end, which it soon did. This eventually backfires against her in the season four episode \"Clothes Minded\", as she could no longer purchase her original mission clothes and had to have a new outfit designed for her.\n\nVoiced by: (in order) Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, Jason Marsden, and Justin Shenkarow\n\nA boy band consisting of Robby, Nicky Nick, Ryan, and Dexter, whose fame suddenly vanished, leaving Ron as their only fan. They were on the verge of breaking up when the Señor Seniors kidnapped them, intending to put Junior in the group to fulfill his dream of becoming an international pop sensation. Ron is also captured, and while breaking out, they put aside their arguments and learn to work together as a group to help Kim and Ron capture the villains. After learning that their manager did not care about getting them back, they fire him and hire Rufus in his place. When they were missing, the group's popularity enjoyed a revival due to a resurgence of their music on radio, retrospective television specials, and investigative reports about their disappearance.\n\nNicky Nick was known to have had a relationship with fellow pop singer Britina, but has since broken up with her.\n\nVoiced by: (in order) Bill Goldberg and Test\n\nThe top-billing star wrestlers of the GWA (Global Wrestling Association), who are bitter rivals in the ring but are good friends outside of the public's sight. They are distinguished by their costumes, which allude to their stage names – Pain King wears a gold coronet and a cowled mask, while Steel Toe's right shoe is supposedly made of titanium. Their enthusiastic fans are prone to fighting and riots. During the Wrestling Wriot: The Smack-down in Middleton event, they put aside their differences on live pay-per-view and work together to help Kim and Ron defeat their magically transformed manager, The Jackal.\n\nVoiced by: Rob Paulsen\n\nThe snobbish, spoiled and arrogant prince of the Kingdom of Rodeghan. Kim was charged with protecting him from the Knights of Rodeghan in \"Royal Pain\" because of his ancestor's tyrannical behavior toward them. He is charismatic and popular, and ends up running for class president against Kim and Brick Flagg with help from Ron, who temporarily stops being Kim's manager. The prophecy that the monarchy would end with him is fulfilled when he decides to convert his nation into a democracy because of the fun he had with the school election. Although not seen or mentioned again, as he stated his intention to \"fulfill my term\", he would have remained in Middleton for the rest of the school year.\n\nIn the series finale \"Graduation Part II\", he is seen sitting behind Camille Leone as Dr. Drakken receives a medal.\n\nVoiced by: Dan Castellaneta\n\nA Private in the Army charged with guarding a Neutronalizer Ray in \"Mind Games\". Dr. Drakken kidnaps and switches minds with him to use his security clearances to access a top secret military installation and steal the Neutronalizer. While in his body, he manages to contact Kim for help.\n\nVoiced by: Maurice LaMarche\n\nAn insectologist, whose name is derived from Acariformes, one of the orders of mites. Kim recovers the plans for a robot tick which Dr. Drakken stole from him in \"Tick-Tick-Tick\". In return, he gives her a ride in China in \"The Full Monkey\". He also appears in \"Roachie\",where his former lab assistant, Chester Yapsby, steals his \"roflex\" invention, a device that increases the size of insects, and uses it for evil.\n\nVoiced by: Brian George\n\nAn astronomer and one of James Possible's college friends. Dr. Drakken's creations kidnap him in \"Attack of the Killer Bebes\" as revenge for making fun of him in college. He also falls victim to one of Drakken's \"silly hats\" in \"Showdown at the Crooked D\". In the series finale, he, Dr. Possible, and Slim find evidence of vandalism while playing golf at the local country club.\n\nVoiced by: Gedde Watanabe\n\nAn astronomer and one of James Possible and Dr. Drakken's old college friends. He is Ramesh's partner, and was the first target for the Bebe robots, but Kim and her dad save him. Prior to the Lorwardian invasion, he is in the middle of a cell phone conversation with James when his end abruptly goes dead, and his fate is never addressed.\n\nVoiced by: Peter Bonerz\n\nRon's rabbi, who performs his Bar Mitzvah in \"Ron the Man\"' but forgets his Bar Mitzvah certificate, forcing Ron to question if he is really a man. Fortunately, he helps Kim bring Ron to his senses.\n\nVoiced by: Frank Welker\n\nA cockroach who Chester Yapsby enlarged to the size of a small dog using the roflex, an invention he stole from Professor Acari. Despite Ron's fear of small insects, he develops a friendship with Roachie, who saves him from the giant cockroaches and helps turn them against Chester Yapsby. Kim is disgusted by Roachie, but eventually comes to tolerate him.\n\nVoiced by: Tara Strong\n\nA cheerleader who is one of Bonnie's sycophants. She has a crush on Ron early in season one, kissing him on the cheek after he saves the cheerleaders from Gil \"Gill\" Moss at Camp Wannaweep in \"Sink or Swim\". However, he is unaware of her feelings for him until \"Emotion Sickness\", where she starts going out with Josh Mankey. By \"Steal Wheels\", she is dating an unnamed boy, and in So the Drama she attends the prom with Jason Morgan, the basketball team's star forward. When not with Bonnie, she occasionally spends time with Kim but is most often seen with fellow cheerleader Hope.\n\nVoiced by: Adam West\n\nA former television actor who played the role of the titular character on the TV show The Fearless Ferret, a reference to Batman, which starred Adam West. However, his show was canceled after two seasons, so he uses his money to duplicate the set. Over the years, he becomes delusional and begins to believe he is the Fearless Ferret. At a Retro-TV convention, he reunites with retired TV actor, Rudolph Farnsworth, who played the villain \"White Stripe\" and had also become lost in delusions. This brings them back to reality and reunites them as friends.\n\nVoiced by Nika Futterman\n\nA Hispanic student at Middleton High, who works at a multiplex theater in Middleton and is usually seen in the ticket booth wearing the name tag \"Annie\" until hers can be made. Ron has a crush on her, and so attends every film showing to chat with her, which evidently piques her interest as she sees the last film with him and shares his popcorn. She appears to have been Ron's first serious girlfriend.\n\nShe is also interested in an online MMORPG computer game called \"Everlot\", an allusion to EverQuest and similar games, playing as a \"she-warrior\" (Virtu-Ron). Although their dating scene was considered to be \"in the game\", she is surprised to find out Ron also plays Everlot. Despite eventually finding out he is really a newb trying to impress her to take their relationship to the next level, she remains willing to hang out with him after they are hijacked and trapped in the game's virtual world.\n\nZita also appears in the series finale, \"Graduation\", where she is seen dating Felix Renton. However, the Aspen Wand of New Forest, an artifact Ron gave her player character inside Everlot, is seen being wielded by a she-warrior in a computer fighting game Ron plays in \"Roachie\".\n\nMinor characters in Kim's network whom she has helped during past missions and provide transportation to her missions. As of season four, Kim uses rides less because she has her own vehicle, but calls upon them when it is out of service.\n\nBaxter – In \"Mind Games\", he lets Kim and Ron ride two of his donkeys into the Grand Canyon in return for Kim performing an emergency delivery for his donkey Buttercup. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta.\n\nBernice – In \"Naked Genius\", she gives Kim a ride as thanks for saving her town from a leaking dam. She also appears in \"Team Impossible\", having apparently started working with jets. She is voiced by April Winchell.\n\nCaptain Louis – In \"A Very Possible Christmas\", he gives Ron a ride to Dr. Drakken's base. The episode reveals that Kim saved his boat from sinking, but that Ron exacerbated the trouble, which he does not remember. He is voiced by John DiMaggio.\n\nDallas – In \"Attack of the Killer Bebes\", he gives Kim a lift to Mount Middleton after she aids him during a car chase. He is voiced by Rob Paulsen.\n\nMr. Geminini – He works for Doctor Bortle, and in \"The Twin Factor\" gives Kim, Ron, and her brothers a ride to Bortle's lab. He has a twin, but his brother is in prison. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta.\n\nGustavo – In \"Tick-Tick-Tick\", he gives Kim and Ron a ride in his plane as thanks for them saving his village from a flood, which it is hinted Ron caused.\n\nHeinrich – In \"Crush\", he gives Kim a ride after she saves his village from an avalanche that Ron accidentally caused. He reappears in \"Team Impossible\". He is voiced by John DiMaggio.\n\nJoe – A helicopter pilot who in \"Queen Bebe\" gives Kim and Ron a ride to the Bebe's hive island off the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nJudd – A camera man who in \"Oh Boyz\" gives Kim a ride to the Seniors' island. Kim had rescued Judd from a rhino stampede while he was filming a program entitled \"Teasing Wild Animals\".\n\nMr. Magnifico – In \"Bonding\", he and his circus company give Kim a ride to a top-secret research facility on their train. They did this in return for Kim acting as a substitute high-wire acrobat after the original performer twisted her ankle.\n\nMr. Morrow - He is voiced by Clancy Brown.\n\nMrs. Mahoney – A woman who gave Kim her first ever ride as payment for saving her cat, as seen in A Sitch in Time.\n\nMr. Parker – In \"Bueno Nacho\", he flies Kim to Wisconsin in his crop duster after she saves his business by going organic, allowing her to para-drop onto the world's largest Swiss cheese wheel.\n\nRicardo – In \"Gorilla Fist\", he gives Kim a ride to South America in his plane as thanks for saving his chicken farm from a mudslide.\n\nUnnamed Marine Colonel – In \"Monkey Fist Strikes\", he gives Kim a ride to Cambodia in a military transport plane after she tips him off to an incoming assault.\n\nVoiced by: John DiMaggio\n\nPortrayed by: Todd Stashwick, Maxwell Simkins (young)\n\nKim Possible's archenemy and the main antagonist. His catchphrase is \"You think you're all that but you're not!\" He is a mad scientist and supervillain obsessed with world domination who often utilizes robots and cloning. His real name is Drew Theodore P. Lipsky, and he is dearly loved by his mother, Mama Lipsky, though he cannot bring himself to tell her he is a supervillain. When he was in college, he was humiliated by his friends, one of whom was Kim's father James, over his decision to create robots for their dates rather than trying to find real girls. He ended up dropping out and becoming a villain to boost his ego. At some point, his skin turned blue, but all that is known about the incident is that \"it was a Tuesday\" when it happened.\n\nDespite being a capable scientist who is skilled at technology, Drakken is clueless at making them work correctly and his plans are often undone by his own oversights. For example, he makes his \"perfect\" Bebe Robots too perfect, and they realize he is not perfect and is not worthy of being their commander. As well, he positions super-laser reflectors on the moon, but they reflect the beam back to their source, destroying the lair he spent stolen millions on.\n\nEven though Drakken claims to be evil, at times he has shown a good side and helped Kim save the world. He frequently encounters Kim and Ron, and is always surprised to see Kim even though he is unsure why; as well, he never remembers Ron's name. However, in \"The Twin Factor,\" he does remember his name, and Ron forces him to remember it at the end of So the Drama. In \"Graduation\", he plays a major role in defeating the Lorwardians and receives a UN medal for it. It is implied that he reformed, finally obtained the recognition and respect he sought after, but this is not confirmed.\n\nVoiced by: Nicole Sullivan\n\nPortrayed by: Taylor Ortega\n\nDr. Drakken's sidekick and Kim's most dangerous enemy, who is wanted in eleven countries, as Wade notes in \"Tick-Tick-Tick\" (Ron reacts to this by saying \"make that twelve\" showing his attraction towards her). She enjoys mocking Drakken's stupidity with sarcastic remarks, or in Drakken's words \"giving him lip\". She is highly skilled in martial arts and stealth. Ron initially has a crush on her, but quickly gets over it after seeing how dangerous she is. She also serves as a foil to Kim, with Drakken noting their similarities.\n\nShego used to be a superheroine alongside her brothers as part of Team Go, as they were hit by a mysterious rainbow \"comet\" when they were younger and each gained a color-coded glowing superpower; Shego's is green. According to her brother Hego, Shego left the group because as they fought evil, she came to like it and turned to evil herself. According to Shego, she quit because her brothers were annoying, a claim which Hego later implies to be true since Shego was responsible for keeping the team focused back then. The properties of her power are never fully defined, but are shown to be capable of destroying metal and delivering concussive force. Normally, Shego's power manifests in a glow enshrouding her hands and fingers, but she can also fire it as a beam and toss it as a concentrated attack. Despite the properties of her ability, Shego tends to hold back during key moments of combat with Kim which would otherwise injure her.\n\nShego has a degree in child development, as revealed in \"Stop Team Go\" when she serves as a substitute teacher for Kim and Ron's class after temporarily being turned good. During that time, she and Kim end up becoming friends. Even though they are sworn enemies, Shego seems to care about Kim. When Drakken teams up with the alien Warmonga, Shego saves Kim's life and contacts her brothers through the Kimmunicator for help. In the series finale, she teams up with Kim, Ron, and Drakken to save the world, and during the medal award ceremony it is implied that she reforms and becomes romantically involved with Drakken, but this is not confirmed.\n\nInitially, Shego was meant to be Dr. Drakken's sidekick and was designed with green and black, which are colors the creators considered to be known as \"bad colors\".[19] However, after hearing Nicole Sullivan's performance as Shego, they started to develop her unique relationship with Drakken. Nicole portrayed Shego as sarcastic and more intelligent than Drakken, which became a major aspect of her character. The characters' voice actors had already worked together in Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.[20] Originally, Shego was not included in the initial version of the pilot episode \"Crush\", but was added in later versions of it.[21]\n\nVoiced by: Tom Kane\n\nLord Monty Fiske, who as a criminal goes by Monkey Fist, a spoonerism of \"Monty Fiske\",[3] he was a British nobleman, world-famous explorer, and archaeologist who became obsessed with monkeys and becoming the Monkey King. After training to become a master of Tai Shing Pek Kwar, he spent his family fortune on radical genetic procedures and experimental surgeries to replace his hands and feet with those of a monkey. In the season two episode \"Partners\", it is revealed that the procedures were performed by DNAmy, who developed a crush on Fist at some point.\n\nHe is obsessed with increasing his power through various mystical artifacts and prophecies , and Kim first meets him when he calls her to Cambodia to retrieve a jade monkey idol from a tomb full of traps. In the process, she unknowingly completes a set of four mystical idols in his possession, and he uses them to expose himself to Mystical Monkey Powers. He is aware of the existence of the Yamanouchi Ninja Clan, and it is implied he had a history with them.\n\nUnlike the other villains, he considers Ron a worthy opponent and he and Rufus as the only others, besides himself, to be exposed to Mystical Monkey Powers. Although Ron considers Monkey Fist his arch-nemesis, in \"Gorilla Fist\" Fiske refutes him as at best an arch-bungler. He is one of their regular foes who remembers his name, which he appreciates. He is also most confrontational of the villains, being willing to battle the heroes directly as opposed to villains like Drakken, who use technology to fight for them.\n\nAside from his martial arts skills, which are greatly enhanced by the increased agility granted by his simian hands and feet, he commands an army of trained monkey ninjas. He directly fights Ron only once, and he loses after his hands and mouth were filled with jade idols, leaving him vulnerable to a dropkick. Every other encounter between them sees Ron either dealing with the monkey ninjas or running away. Kim, however, manages to fight him to a stand-still.\n\nIn \"Oh No, Yono\", he is defeated after attempting to kidnap Hana and turns to stone in fulfillment of a mystical contract to \"walk the Path of the Yono\".\n\nVoiced by: Brian George\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"World's Deadliest Golfer\", who was banned from every golf course in the world because of his temper. He wields golf clubs and exploding golf balls. He is Scottish and wears traditional Scottish attire such as a kilt and tam o' shanter. Although he debuted as an independent villain, subsequent appearances show him as more of a mercenary, committing robberies to sell stolen objects to others. Killigan resides on a private island dubbed \"Killigan's Island\" by Ron, a reference to Gilligan's Island.\n\nHe teams up with Drakken on several occasions when they have a common goal, as well as Monkey Fist in A Sitch in Time. He first encounters Kim when she and Will Du of Global Justice join forces to stop him from turning the planet into his own personal golf course. During A Sitch in Time, he joins the other allied villains in traveling to the past to prevent their future defeats at Kim's hands, but this fails. In the dystopic future ruled over by Shego, Killigan becomes Robo-Duff: the World's Deadliest Golfing Cyborg, with no visible parts of his body remaining except for his head, which is in a wheeled exo-suit that enables him to produce exploding golf balls.\n\nIn \"Grande Size Me\", he is among the villains who appear at the HenchCo auction and expresses concern for Ron upon noticing his dramatic weight gain. Later, in \"Graduation,\" Duff is initially suspected of vandalizing various country clubs and golf courses around the world, but Kim and Ron discover that his island has been marred by a large symbol. This is later revealed to be a Lorwardian emblem, which foreshadows their invasion. While Kim investigates, Duff questions Ron about their relationship, exacerbating his growing insecurity over his imminent graduation from high school.\n\nVoiced by: Ricardo Montalbán, Earl Boen\n\nA retired Spanish multi-billionaire who takes up villainy as a hobby at Ron's suggestion.[22] Many of his schemes revolve around acquiring power or influence for his son, Junior, and his tactics usually involve clichés of villainy such as evil laughter and elaborate traps. He is often seen reading and referencing The Book of Evil guidebook, and aims to gain control of Europe. Due to his cunning nature, he is Kim's nemesis more than he is considered Ron's. Of all the villains, Ron likes Senior the most because he is one of the few who remembers his name on a regular basis. He was an action sports icon in his youth, and has shown that he is quite skilled, and very spry for his advanced age. He can pilot helicopters, speedboats, and jet skis with ease, and although frequently seen with a walking stick, can perform complex acrobatics and maneuvers.\n\nVoiced by: Néstor Carbonell\n\nSenior Sr.'s son and sometimes reluctant accomplice, a spoiled man-child who is more interested in parties and beauty than his father's criminal plans and has demonstrated a soft side on various occasions. He once had a crush on Kim because of the zodiac-like principles of Animology.[23] He usually does not fight, but when he does, he typically fights Ron, likely because he is a weaker fighter than Kim. He expresses a desire to be a boy-band singer[24] and is tutored in villainy by Shego in the episode \"Two to Tutor\". Under her tutelage, he proves himself to be a fairly capable fighter, as he defeats her in a sparring match and later Ron. There are also times when he is cunning like his father, such as when he pretends to turn him in to the police to regain their lost fortune through reward money. Because of his buffoonery and the fact that he mainly fights Ron, he is considered Ron's nemesis more than he is considered Kim's. However, like his father, he remembers Ron's name fairly consistently, and because of this Ron likes him more than most of the villains. He begins dating Kim's classmate, Bonnie Rockwaller, early in the final season and is still dating her by the end of the series. However, in the finale, his date \"Bonnie\" is revealed to be Camille Leon.\n\nVoiced and portrayed by: Patton Oswalt\n\nA German mad scientist who is determined to surpass his rival, Dr. Drakken. He is depicted as being more competent than him and having more effective henchmen. However, he still succumbs to certain villainous clichés, a weakness which Bonnie points out in the episode \"Bonding.\" Ever since he experienced defeat at the hands of Kim's battlesuit, he has turned his focus to stealing it for himself, attempting to acquire it in the episodes \"Ill-Suited\" and \"Larry's Birthday\". In \"Larry's Birthday\", it is shown that he has a sister named Hildegard, who is married to Myron, one of his henchmen. In a shared dream, Dementor's family name was \"Demenz\", but it is unclear whether this is true outside the dream.\n\nVoiced by: Melissa McCarthy\n\nA bio-geneticist who was originally named Amy Hall and has a bubbly and clingy personality. She is an avid collector of Cuddle Buddies, which are small stuffed toys similar to Beanie Babies that are hybrids between two animals, with her favorite being the butterfly-otter hybrid Otterfly. In her obsession, she creates mutant animal hybrids. At one point, she had crushes on Mr. Barkin and Drakken, but now has a crush on Monkey Fist, on whom she performed genetic procedures.\n\nIn season three, she replaces her human body with that of a gorilla in an attempt to get Monkey Fist to reciprocate her romantic feelings, but he instead goes into hiding. However, in season four, she is shown to have returned to her own body, as seen in \"Grande Size Me\", in \"Homecoming Upset\", where she is seen in the bleachers at an MHS football game, and in the end credits of \"Graduation\".\n\nVoiced by: John DiMaggio\n\nDr. Drakken's cousin, who Mrs. Lipsky considers to be the family's \"black sheep\", and is known for his repetitive use of the words \"Dude\" and \"Seriously!\". He is a genius in mechanical engineering and has a natural understanding of engines of all kinds. He is widely regarded as the \"most brilliant mechanical engineer in the country\" but left a prestigious job because \"the top secret government lab he worked at had a dress code\" which did not approve of his mullet and he refused to cut it. He then based himself and his gang at a junkyard in New Jersey.\n\nHe has a biker gang motif and is a male chauvinist with an eye for beautiful women. He spends his time playing air guitar and stealing anything which is car related, especially that will fill his need for speed. Although he is technically a villain and has been imprisoned several times, he seems to have little interest in anything grander than road trips and \"tricking out\" his various rides.\n\nVoiced by: Ashley Tisdale\n\nAn heiress and socialite who became a villain after being cut off from her family fortune and gained the ability to shapeshift after having experimental plastic surgery. Her name is a play on the word chameleon. Unlike other villains, who aim for world domination, Camille commits crimes to fund her lavish lifestyle or out of spite and revenge. She has a pet Sphynx cat named Debutante, who has an obsessive crush on Rufus. She is a parody of Paris Hilton, while also possessing elements of Marvel Comics villain Mystique and High School Musical character Sharpay Evans. She is friends with fellow celebs, Britina, M.C. Honey, Starlette, and the Holsen twins, who are a parody of the Olsen twins.\n\nVoiced by: Richard Kind\n\nAn employee of the Philadelphia Smarty Mart who was originally named Francis Lurman. In the episode \"Low Budget\", he threatens to destroy the Internet with a destructive virus placed on the barcode of a can of expired Vienna sausages unless everyone in the world agrees to pay him a dollar each. He is a cost-conscious and budget-minded villain, and so does not use henchmen or a lair. He conducts his evil plans from his mother's basement and threatens his foes with a wading pool full of snapping turtles. After So the Drama, he is Drakken's cellmate in jail and constantly bothers him with his ideas, even sleep-talking about claiming to kidnap the five richest people in the world without doing so, which Junior and Shego did. Despite this, he and Drakken bond over the idea of taking control of all the Smarty-Mart drones He is later released from jail after serving his time.\n\nVoiced by: Ricky Ullman (as Eric)\n\nAlso known as Synthodrone #901, \"one made to order Syntho-hottie\". He is a synthetic villain who Dr. Drakken creates during So the Drama to keep Kim preoccupied socially and ensure that Drakken's plans of world domination are not interrupted. He is destroyed by Rufus in revenge for calling naked mole rats \"gross\".\n\nVoiced by: Rachel Dratch\n\nA villain who only appears in the episode \"All The News\". She is a TV teen action star who specializes in \"extreme\" death-defying stunts, but in reality fakes all her stunts. Kim and Ron expose her when Kim tries to save Lynn from a failed bungee jump stunt and discovers she was using a stuffed dummy as a stunt-double. Her catchphrase is \"freaky\", placing extra emphasis on the eaky rather than fr. Her name is an allusion to adrenaline.\n\nVoiced by Richard Steven Horvitz\n\nA villain with a bird fixation who is an arch-nemesis of Team Go and speaks in an over-the-top, villainous manner. He wears a caped costume with boots that resemble a bird's feet and commands several bird-themed weapons, such as flocks of hummingbird-shaped homing missiles and a gigantic robotic flamingo. He also owned a staff which was capable of stealing the powers of Team Go's members and allowing him to use them, though it was subsequently destroyed, returning the stolen powers to their original owners. Despite the fact that Dr. Drakken cannot remember Ron's name, he still knows who he is when Aviarius tries to portray Ron as himself, as seen in \"Go Team Go.\"\n\nVoiced by: Jeff Bennett\n\nMonkey Fist's butler, who is loyal to him and works hard to please him. After gaining Mystical Monkey Powers, Monkey Fist begins training an army of monkey ninja warriors. Bates has not returned since then, and it is unknown if he is still works for Monkey Fist.\n\nVoiced by Kerri Kenney\n\nA trio of hive-minded female killer robots who Dr. Drakken built, but have since gone rogue. They make Bonnie their \"Queen Bebe\", even though Bonnie is initially unaware of this. With help from Rufus, they sabotage their production line so that their heads will be mounted upside down. They then self-destruct after realizing they are no longer perfect, allowing Kim to defeat them and save Bonnie.\n\nVoiced by: Maurice LaMarche\n\nA morbidly obese man and one of the criminal underworld's number one information brokers, who will always participate in any evil deals taking place. He often plays mind games with his clients, which he expects them to play along with if they want his help.\n\nVoiced by: Stephen Root\n\nA villain who only appears in the episode \"Roachie\", where he tries to take over Middleton with giant cockroaches via the \"roflex\", an invention he stole from Professor Akari. He is thwarted with help from Roachie, one of the giant cockroaches he created and Ron befriended.\n\nVoiced by: Tom Kenny\n\nA co-worker of Dr. Possible who works in the robotics department as a roboticist. It is unclear how he obtained this position, but it is implied that he got it by stealing his partner's research.\n\nVoiced by: Kari Wahlgren\n\nA villainess who appears in the episode \"Stop Team Go\". Her evil genius lies in electrical weapons, as Shego explains, \"If it has wires, she can turn it into a weapon. If it's already a weapon, she can make it a better weapon.\" She has metallic, wire-like hair that crackles with static electricity and wears an outfit with wires and conduits to channel her electrical powers. She has the ability to shoot lightning from her hands.\n\nShe draws Team Go and Shego into a trap to avenge herself and turn the heroes into her \"evil minions\" using the Attitudinator. Because Shego had become evil of her own volition, she is instead temporarily turned good and teams up with Kim to defeat the villainess. After her defeat, Ron uses the Attitudinator to turn her good.\n\nTwo silent ninjas who Drakken employs in \"Blush\" to help him embarrass Kim while she is on a date with Josh Mankey. They come close to succeeding, but are stopped when Ron saves Kim.\n\nA trio of image consultants who advise villains on the look of their lairs and the style of their costumes. Their cable television show Evil Eye for the Bad Guy is a spoof of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.\n\nVoiced by Phil Morris\n\nA wealthy man who is known for being the only breeder of Lithuanian Wolfhounds, one of the world's rarest dog breeds. As described by Wade, Jones is \"rich, refined and possibly the world's greatest thief.\" Wade explains to Kim and Ron that Jones is the prime suspect in many high-profile robberies, but no one has been able to find evidence to prove this. He appears in the half-length episode, \"Rufus in Show,\" where Team Possible encounters him sometime after he stole a large diamond from a museum exhibit. Kim and Ron enter Rufus into his annual open dog show as cover to recover the diamond. Compared to Kim's recurring enemies, he is more competent as a villain, as instead of leaving Kim and Ron to perish in a trap, he chooses to stay and make sure they die. After Ron questions why he is called \"Falsetto,\" Kim explains that it comes from his unusually high voice, which was caused by a \"freak helium accident.\" While he was not shown being arrested by the police, the second Game Boy Advance video game confirms that he was arrested and sent to prison.\n\nVoiced by: Dante Basco\n\nWhen Ron is temporarily transferred into Yamanouchi as part of an exchange program, Fukushima is opposed to him and the idea of an outsider being allowed to enter the school. Afterwards, he is shown hazing Ron and laughing whenever he makes a mistake. He later helps Monkey Fist to obtain the Lotus Blade and is defeated by Ron in the climax of the episode.\n\nVoiced by: Justin Berfield\n\nHis real name is Gil Moss. In the past, he attended Camp Wannaweep alongside Ron, who swapped his afternoon swim for arts and crafts. In the episode \"Sink or Swim\", he reveals that the polluted lake he swam in caused him to mutate into a fish-man. At the end of the episode, he is taken away in a fish tank to be cured. He reappears in \"Return to Camp Wannaweep\", where he shows up at Kim's cheerleading camp, now cured of his mutation and posing as a mascot for another cheerleading team. He appears to want to befriend Ron, who does not believe he has truly reformed. His suspicions prove to be true, as Gil is actually seeking a source of mutagenic water to return to being \"2-L\" Gill again. It turns out that while he hates being a fish-man, he hates being returned to normal even more. After assuming a more bulky and monstrous form and going on a rampage terrorizing the cheerleaders, he is defeated by Ron with help from Kim, Bonnie, and Mr. Barkin, and taken away in a giant fishbowl.\n\nVoiced by: Rob Paulsen\n\nHe first appears in the half-length episode \"Sick Day\" as a temp worker, who Duff hires after Dr. Drakken and Shego are incapacitated by the flu. He returns in \"Odds Man In\" as a \"villainy consultant\" to improve Dr. Drakken's latest global domination scheme.\n\nVoiced by: Fred Willard\n\nThe head of Hench Co. Industries, who prefers to think of himself as a businessman who caters to an exclusive clientele rather than a villain. However, he is linked to villainy since the clientele consists of people who do have evil schemes. He has stayed under everyone's radar and in business since he does not use his own inventions or weapons. Considering the nature of his business, Kim wants nothing to do with him and aids him because it is for the greater good.\n\nVoiced by: Bill Barretta\n\nThe founder, chairman and executive promoter of the GWA (Global Wrestling Association), who made a fortune bringing his brand of sports entertainment into living rooms all over the world. However, promoting the show was not good enough for Jackie, as he wanted to be an actual wrestler. Unfortunately, because of his small size, other athletes, including performers Steel Toe and Pain King, mocked his dream. This caused him to resent others, but one day he learns of the legend of an Egyptian amulet, said to have been a gift to Cleopatra from a priest of Anubis that granted superhuman strength and power to its wearer. He is defeated when Rufus manages to remove the amulet, allowing Pain King and Steel Toe to throw him from the ring.\n\nVoiced by: Martin Spanjers\n\nA man known as \"The Wraith Master\", who only appears in the episode \"Vir-Tu-Ron\". He is a 'power player' in the popular online game Everlot, a parody of EverQuest. However, his obsession goes too far and he seeks to dominate the game world as his online avatar – the Wraith Master. He also tries, unsuccessfully, to win the affections of Zita Flores. He is defeated in the game when everyone gives their power to Zita. Afterwards, Ron comforts him and convinces him to join a club instead.\n\nVoiced by: Jane Carr\n\nA former head of an English academy for nannies, which went out of business as the practice of using nannies to raise children became less fashionable. She develops a machine that turns people into super-strong babies and begin to steal pacifiers and hold them for ransom. Kim defeats her by using her babysitting skills to pacify her minions then revert them to their original age with her machine.\n\nVoiced by: Maurice LaMarche\n\nThe fraternal twin brother of Betty Director and the evil head of WEE (the Worldwide Evil Empire), who has dedicated himself to taking down her group Global Justice (GJ). While he claims to be Dr. Director's \"evil twin\", his true motivation is that is that because he was born first, he wanted her to treat him like an older brother, but she did not. He has a prosthetic right hand that fires finger-tipped missiles. He tends to punish his underlings for a single failure by having them sit on a chair and dropped down a hole. He first encounters Kim and Ron when he learns that GJ is investigating a phenomenon called \"The Ron Factor\" and kidnaps Ron, intending to make him a member of WEE. However, Kim is able to rescue Ron and defeat Gemini with help from Dr. Director. He also appears in \"Grande Size Me\".\n\nVoiced by: Phil Morris\n\nA snowman who came to life through a freak blizzard, gaining toxic powers and the nickname \"Toxic Snowman\". It is later revealed that a news anchor named Summer Gale caused the snowstorm using a weather machine to get more airtime. Since the snow was created using water from Lake Wannaweep, which is known for creating mutants, it also affected Snowy. Snowy emerges after the Possibles destroy the Toxic Snowmen army, but is destroyed when Kim and Ron cause the sun to come out, melting him.\n\nVoiced by Hallie Todd\n\nA news anchor who was getting less time on television because of her age, and so uses a weather machine to create a blizzard that she can cover. This blizzard hits Middleton, which is then attacked by Snowy, who gained sentience and powers as a result of the snow coming from the toxic water of Lake Wannaweep. Kim and Ron are able to rescue Summer, defeat Snowy and his army of snowmen, and disable the weather machine.\n\nVoiced by: Kevin Michael Richardson\n\nA hulking ninja who has the size and weight of a sumo wrestler and the speed and agility of a ninja. He usually speaks in a deep, threatening voice. While working for Dr. Drakken, he attempts to kidnap Mr. Nakasumi, but as a result of his battle with Kim and Ron, he comes to speak with a high, squeaky voice for some time.\n\nVoiced by: Charlie Schlatter (Chino), Tara Strong (Espadrille), and Gwendoline Yeo (Hoodie)\n\nA group collectively known as The Fashionistas, a group of fashion-obsessed criminals who are surprisingly capable at combat, with Hoodie perhaps being the strongest of the three. They appear in \"Fashion Victim,\" when Kim and Monique battle them to retrieve secret Club Banana designs that Camille Léon stole. They reappear in \"Clothes Minded\" when Kim is looking for a new design for her mission outfit. Though she rejects their offer to make the outfit because they were asking for too much in return, she does wind up using their design later on.\n\nVoiced by: Corey Burton and Brian George\n\nLong ago, the kingdom of Rodeghan was run by a ruthless monarch who was so tyrannical that even his knights hated him. Since then, the knights have followed an ancient prophecy predicting that the King's lineage will end with Prince Wally, the future King Wallace III. However, like most prophecies, there is more than one interpretation; Wally would be the last royal, but the lineage would end with his kingdom becoming a democracy rather than his death.\n\nVoiced by: Brian Stepanek\n\nA villain who first appeared in the season four episode \"Mathter and Fervent\", a villain reminiscent of those from cartoons of the 1970s. His name is a combination of the words \"math\" and \"master\". He is one of the three known foes of Team Go, and became a villain after he was denied funding for his \"unethical mathematical experiments\". His primary weapon is a \"calcu-laser\" and he uses math puns in almost every sentence, much to Kim's annoyance. He is defeated by Ron's father in battle in his Infinity Dome, as he is an actuary and able to match him in math calculations.\n\nVoiced by: Max Casella\n\nA man who Señor Senior, Senior hires as a financial consultant to instill in his son a measure of financial responsibility. He is actually a con man and convinces Señor Senior Junior to grant him power of attorney, then steals their fortune, leaving The Seniors destitute for a short period of time.\n\nVoiced by: Kerri Kenney\n\nA nine-foot-tall alien with green skin who comes from the planet Lorwardia, a planet of warriors. After intercepting the broadcast of a months-old television commercial, Rappin' Drakken, she arrives on Earth believing that Dr. Drakken is \"The Great Blue\", a legendary leader who will lead Lorwardia's people to glory and seeks to pledge her allegiance to. She is a strong and fierce fighter who is very eager-to-please, but can be literal-minded when following orders. Her name is an allusion to the word \"warmonger\", while the name of her home planet, Lorwardia, is a spoonerism of warlord.\n\nShe first appears in \"Mad Dogs and Aliens\", where she nearly defeats Kim and Shego after they team up to fight her. However, she leaves after being tricked by Jim or Tim Possible in a video message posing as the \"real Great Blue\", which is actually a Pep Puppy costume colored blue, and who is waiting for her at \"Bluto\" (Pluto). She later returns in \"Graduation\" along with Warhok, seeking revenge at being tricked. She is temporarily defeated by Drakken, but breaks free and plans to take Kim home as a trophy. This angers Ron into summoning the Mystical Monkey Powers to battle Warhok, and he defeats them by throwing them into their spaceship, which explodes and seemingly kills them.\n\nVoiced by Ron Perlman\n\nA leader in the Lorwardian Army and Warmonga's hot-tempered teammate. He, along with Warmonga, serve as the main antagonists of the series finale. He is initially defeated by Kim, but breaks free and, along with Warmonga, prepares to take Kim home as a trophy. He then battles an angry Ron and is seemingly killed when Ron throws him into their ship, which then explodes.\n\nVoiced by: John C. McGinley\n\nRudolph Farnsworth, also known as \"White Stripe\", is a villain who appears in season two. He, like his fellow actor Timothy North, has come to believe the Fearless Ferret television show is reality and that he is the villain he played on the show: the White Stripe. When Ron dons the Fearless Ferret costume, he comes out of hiding to battle him. He realizes at the end of the episode that the White Stripe is not real and reconciles with Timothy North.\n\nVoiced by: Clancy Brown\n\nA villain introduced in the season four episode \"Oh No! Yono!\", who Monkey Fist unseals to help him find the \"weapon\". This turns out to be Hana, who he is destined to fight. After making a pact, Yono goes to Yamanouchi and easily defeats Kim, Rufus, and Master Sensei, turning them to stone. After Hana beats his summoner, Monkey Fist, everyone is returned to normal and Monkey Fist is turned to stone for following the \"Path of the Yono\".\n\nThe villainous alter ego of Ron, whose name came from Zorpox the Conqueror of Issue 97 of the Villains' League of Evil Villains, a comic book which Wade owned. Ron was wearing a Zorpox costume to infiltrate HenchCo's Evil Trade Fair when he was turned evil by a device called the \"Attitudinator\", which swapped his inner evil with Dr. Drakken, who was the previous wearer. Later on, Electronique enhances the Attitudinator into a morality \"Reverse Polarizer\" that Ron falls victim to, again turning him evil. When evil, Ron is arguably the most dangerous villain of the series, even impressing Shego with his villainous prowess, enhanced fighting skills, and willingness to dump her in a shark tank - a threat which scared her into subservience. However, despite keeping the comic book character's costume, he was never referred to as \"Zorpox\" by either himself or others, perhaps because he didn't think of himself as Zorpox. While evil, \"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\" by Johann Sebastian Bach is used as his leitmotif."
