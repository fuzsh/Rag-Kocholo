        "text": "School of Rock\n\nVolume Up. Curtain Up. Class is in Session.\n\nKicked out of his band and facing eviction, life isn’t awesome for wannabe rock star Dewey Finn. But his fortunes change when he intercepts a phone call meant for his roommate – and seizes the opportunity to make some quick cash posing as a substitute teacher.\n\nFinding himself in front of a classroom of straight-laced, uptight private school kids, he realizes he has one lesson he can teach them: How to rock! In order to do so, he’s going to have to avoid the prying eyes of the school’s principal and parents.\n\nBased on the hit 2003 film, School of Rock is a high-voltage, feel-good tribute to big dreams, coming together, and the irrepressible power of rock ‘n roll!\n\n“For those about to love School of Rock: We salute you.” – Time Out New York\n\nFeaturing pre-show performances from School of Rock Vancouver:\n\nSaturday July 13th\n\nSaturday July 27th (Fireworks Night)\n\nSunday August 4th\n\nSaturday August 24th (Closing)\n\nCATS\n\nCome One. Come All. It’s Time for the Jellicle Ball.\n\nWhile the moon shines bright up above, all manner of curious cats and feisty felines creep forth for their annual gathering. Each of the Jellicle Tribe are exceptional and astonishing in their own right – but come the dawn, only one can be selected to ascend to the Heaviside Layer.\n\nOne of the longest-running and most beloved musicals in Broadway and West End history, CATS is overflowing with unforgettable songs, including ‘Mr Mistoffelees,’ ‘Macavity: The Mystery Cat,’ and, the all-time favourite, ‘Memory.’\n\nIn the natural forest setting of Stanley Park, this open air production breathes fresh new life into the record-breaking musical spectacular and lets the memory live again.\n\n“…unabashed Broadway glitz.” – New York Post"
