        "text": "The Disney Channel launched in 1983 as a premium cable channel. As such, movies were a key part of their programming. Over the years, Disney Channel has aired numerous movies from their own parent studio’s library, as well as acquired movies from nearly every other major Hollywood studio.\n\nIncluded in the table below are all Walt Disney animated features that have aired, as well as other major Disney and Pixar movie releases. A few notable Disney animated features that Disney Channel has never aired: Fantasia (1940), The Black Cauldron (1985), Doug’s 1st Movie (1999), Fantasia 2000 (1999), Home on the Range (2004), Teacher’s Pet (2004), Winnie the Pooh (2011), Planes: Fire & Rescue (2014), and Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast (2014). This doesn’t include more recent movies.\n\nThis list includes theatrical movies, TV movies, direct-to-video movies, and anything else that is reasonably considered a “movie”. A separate list of “specials” aired on Disney Channel may be added in the future. Given the breadth of movies they’ve aired, it’s nearly impossible to have a list of them all at this time. Sources for the majority of the dates come from various newspapers and on-air promotions. I’ve used my own record keeping to include most (if not all) movies aired since 2007.\n\nPublished: February 9, 2020\n\nUpdated: July 4, 2024 (679 titles listed)"
