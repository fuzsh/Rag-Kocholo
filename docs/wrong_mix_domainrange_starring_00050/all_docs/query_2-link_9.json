        "text": "Kim Possible is a Disney Channel Original Movie, based on the animated series of the same name. The film follows the titular hero, Kim Possible, a typical high school girl who saves the world from evil villains with the help of her sidekick Ron Stoppable, his naked mole-rat Rufus, and computer genius Wade. A short teaser played during the premiere of Freaky Friday. It was released on February 15, 2019.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nKim Possible begins as Kim and her best friend and sidekick, Ron Stoppable, start Middleton High School where Kim must navigate an intimidating new social hierarchy. She is ready to tackle the challenge head-on, just as she has with everything else in life, but her confidence is shaken when she faces roadblocks at every turn—getting lost in the confusing hallways, being late to class and facing rejection during soccer tryouts from her frenemy, Bonnie. Kim's day starts to turn around when she and Ron meet and befriend Athena, a new classmate and Kim Possible superfan who is having an even worse day than Kim. With Kim's guidance and friendship, Athena transforms into the newest member of Team Possible. Soon, Athena starts to eclipse Kim just as the nefarious Drakken and Shego resurface in Middleton with a master plan to finally stop Kim. Now it is up to Team Possible—Kim, Ron, tech-genius Wade, new friend Athena and Rufus, a naked mole-rat that Ron meets along the way—to stop these super villains.\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn Europe, American high school students and crimefighters Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable have thwarted a world dominating scheme of Professor Dementor and rescued his captive Dr. Glopman.\n\nAs Kim and Ron start their first day of school, Kim meets her old childhood friend Bonnie, who states that the school doesn't do cheerleading but soccer. Kim tries out for the soccer team but Bonnie demotes her to being the team's equipment manager as freshmen can't be on the team. They later meet a new student named Athena and take her on a mission to stop the plot of the evil Dr. Drakken. Athena defeats Dr. Drakken's abettor Shego, making her the topic of conversation at Middleton High School despite Kim's jealousy. When the school honors Athena and her good deed, Shego and Dr. Drakken force their way into the ceremony. Kim tries to defeat Shego and her army of henchwomen but falls to the ground, leaving Athena vulnerable to capture. Athena is taken away and Kim is laughed at. After Kim talks with her family and Ron, they decide to rescue Athena from Drakken's and Shego's lair.\n\nAt the lair, however, Kim discovers Athena is part of Drakken's and Shego's plan to copy/steal Kim's motivational essence and transfer it into Drakken using his brain-modulating device. Athena is revealed to be a gynoid built by Drakken, specifically for this. As Kim short-circuits the transfer machine, Dr. Drakken is turned into a pre-adolescent version of himself. Despite Kim's insistence that she leaves with them and save herself, Athena stays behind to turn off the now-unstable machine. The lair explodes and Athena is presumed killed but it is revealed that she has survived the explosion but her robotic parts are scattered. Kim and Ron take her home to be repaired and programmed to be a hero alongside themselves as they try to go back to their normal lives. As they go back to high school, Kim, Ron, and Athena form a martial arts club with the rest of the class joining, except Bonnie who is infuriated as she walks away humiliated.\n\nHowever, during the credits, Dr. Drakken, posing as a gifted student with Shego posing as his mother, enrolls at Kim's high school and begins his plan to defeat her, thus setting up the events of the Kim Hushable shorts.\n\nCast[]\n\nSadie Stanley as Kim Possible\n\nSean Giambrone as Ron Stoppable\n\nNancy Cartwright as Rufus\n\nAlyson Hannigan as Dr. Ann Possible\n\nConnie Ray as Nana Possible\n\nTodd Stashwick as Dr. Drakken\n\nMaxwell Simkins as Young Drakken\n\nTaylor Ortega as Shego\n\nCiara Wilson as Athena\n\nErika Tham as Bonnie Rockwaller\n\nIssac Ryan Brown as Wade\n\nChristy Carlson Romano as Poppy Blu\n\nPatton Oswalt as Professor Dementor\n\nMichael P. Northey as Steve Barkin\n\nMatthew Clarke as Dr. James Possible\n\nOwen Fielding as Tim Possible\n\nConnor Fielding as Jim Possible\n\nPatrick Sabongui as Dr. Glopman\n\nCedric Ducharme as Cool Todd\n\nProduction[]\n\nIt was reported on February 7, 2018 that casting had begun on the project with Blyth Nailling[1] on the job to assemble actors. The live-action movie script was written by the series' creators Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley,[2] and production on the movie took place in Summer 2018.[3] It was announced on April 25 that Sadie Stanley and Sean Giambrone, from The Goldbergs, were cast as the leading roles, Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable.[3] It was announced on June 22 that Issac Ryan Brown from Raven's Home was cast as Wade.\n\nFrom July 2 to 10 the film crew took over McMath Secondary School in Richmond, British Columbia where they began filming.[4]\n\nRelease[]\n\nInternational premieres[]\n\nApril 27, 2019 (France)\n\nVideos[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe film is Sadie Stanley's acting debut.\n\nThis is the second Disney Channel Original Movie based on the Kim Possible series, following Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama.\n\nThis is also the first live-action adaptation based on a Disney animated series.\n\nChristy Carlson Romano (who voiced Kim in the animated series) makes a cameo appearance as Poppy Blu.\n\nNancy Cartwright and Patton Oswalt reprise their roles as Rufus and Professor Dementor from the animated series, respectively. They are the third and fourth actors to reprise their roles for a Disney live-action adaptation of a previous Disney animated production after both Jim Cummings and Brad Garrett, both of who reprised Winnie the Pooh, Tigger (also voiced by Cummings since the late 1980s), and Eeyore (whom Garrett voiced previously in Animated StoryBook: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree and recently in Ralph Breaks the Internet) in 2018's Christopher Robin.\n\nPatton Oswalt is also the second actor to reprise the role of an animated character as a human (as opposed to a computer-animated character), following Jonathan Freeman playing Jafar in the Aladdin musical.\n\nKim's original mission outfit from the series can be seen among Kim's gadgets.[5] It was revealed that the live-action iteration of the character stopped using the outfit because it felt \"cartoonish\".\n\nThe origin of how Ron and Rufus meet is out of canon. In the film, Ron finds Rufus in a science lab where he lives in a terrarium for naked mole-rats, while in \"A Sitch in Time\", Ron buys Rufus at the Smarty Mart during his preteen years.\n\nKim's Rocket Booster Day sweatshirt from \"Monkey Ninjas in Space\" can be seen hanging on Kim's wall in her room.[6]\n\nThe film is seen as a reboot rather than a continuation.\n\nAccording to Adam Stein, the scene of Shego stalking Athena was inspired by the Raptor scene from Jurassic Park.\n\nThis is one of few DCOMs to end on a cliffhanger, with others being Upside-Down Magic, Girl vs. Monster, Teen Beach Movie, and Zapped.\n\nThis is the second Disney Channel Original Movie that Zach Lipovsky one of the directors of Kim Possible (2019) has been apart of. Zach Lipovsky played Matt in Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century 20 years before.\n\nThis is the third Disney Channel Original Movie that Todd Stashwick was in. His first two DCOMs were Stuck in the Suburbs and Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nKim Possible (2019 film) on Wikipedia\n\nMedia Shows/Movies: Kim Possible • \"Rufus\" (Lilo & Stitch: The Series crossover episode) • \"Codename: Electric Haircut\" (Fillmore! crossover episode) • Live-action film • Kim Hushable\n\nVideo Games: Kim Possible: What's the Switch? • Kim Possible • Kim Possible: Kimmunicator • Kim Possible: Revenge of Monkey Fist • Kim Possible 2: Drakken's Demise • Kim Possible 3: Team Possible • Kim Possible: Global Gemini • Disney Heroes: Battle Mode\n\nBooks: Bueno Nacho • Showdown at Camp Wannaweep • The New Ron • Downhill • Attack of the Killer Bebes • Royal Pain • Tweeb Trouble • Extreme • Cloned\n\nDisney Parks Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure\n\nCharacters Heroes: Kim Possible • Ron Stoppable • Rufus • Wade • Dr. Ann Possible • Dr. James Possible • Jim and Tim Possible • Mr. Stoppable • Mrs. Stoppable • Hana Stoppable • Monique • Steve Barkin • Bonnie Rockwaller • Brick Flagg • Ned • Nana Possible • Team Go • Martin Smarty • Artie Smarty • Team Impossible • Betty Director • Cousin Larry • Vivian Francis Porter • Felix Renton • Zita Flores • Master Sensei • Yori • Slim Possible • Joss Possible • Yono • Mego • Hego • Wego Twins • Steel Toe • Pain King • Professor Acari • Connie and Lonnie Rockwaller • Mrs. Rockwaller • Tara • Jessica • Hope • Marcella • Liz • Crystal • Franklin Barkin • Wayne • Shaun • Reuben Stoppable • Vinnie • Big Mike • Mr. McHenry • Junior • Prince Wally • Wanda Wong • Toshimiru • Alan Platt • Akute • Officer Hobble • Amelia • Pop Pop Porter • Kyoko Yoshiko • Nakasumi • Timothy North • SADI • Middleton High School Cheerleaders • Will Du • Cyrus Bortel • Oh Boyz • Roachie • Snake-Cat • Rabbit-Rhino • Athena\n\nVillains: Dr. Drakken • Shego • Monkey Fist • Duff Killigan • Señor Senior, Senior • Señor Senior, Junior • DNAmy • Gil Moss • Camille Léon • Frugal Lucre • Bebe • Adrena Lynn • Gemini • Professor Dementor • Fashionistas • Warmonga • Warhok • Motor Ed • Falsetto Jones • Nanny Maim • Hank Perkins • Jackie the Jackal • Aviarius • Fukushima • Knights of Rodeghan • Malcolm Nevious • Electronique • Dr. Fen • Summer Gale • Commodore Puddles • Monkey Ninjas • Eric • Bartholomew Lipsky • Miss Go • Professor Demens • Jack Hench • The Mathter • Yono\n\nEpisodes Season One: Crush • Sink or Swim • The New Ron • Tick-Tick-Tick • Downhill • Bueno Nacho • Number One • Mind Games • Attack of the Killer Bebes • Royal Pain • Coach Possible • Pain King vs. Cleopatra • Monkey Fist Strikes • October 31st • All the News • Kimitation Nation • The Twin Factor • Animal Attraction • Monkey Ninjas in Space • Ron the Man • Low Budget\n\nSeason Two: Naked Genius • Grudge Match • Two to Tutor • The Ron Factor • Car Trouble • Rufus in Show • Adventures in Rufus-Sitting • Job Unfair • The Golden Years • Virtu-Ron • The Fearless Ferret • Exchange • Rufus vs. Commodore Puddles • Day of the Snowmen • A Sitch in Time • A Very Possible Christmas • Queen Bebe • Hidden Talent • Return to Camp Wannaweep • Go Team Go • The Full Monkey • Blush • Partners • Oh Boyz • Sick Day • The Truth Hurts • Mother's Day • Motor Ed • Ron Millionaire • Triple S • Rewriting History\n\nSeason Three: Steal Wheels • Emotion Sickness • Bonding • Bad Boy • Showdown at the Crooked D • Dimension Twist • So the Drama • Overdue • Roachie • Rappin' Drakken • Team Impossible • Gorilla Fist • And the Mole Rat Will Be CGI\n\nSeason Four: Ill Suited • The Big Job • Trading Faces • The Cupid Effect • Car Alarm • Mad Dogs and Aliens • Grande Size Me • Clothes Minded • Big Bother • Fashion Victim • Odds Man In • Stop Team Go • Cap'n Drakken • Mathter and Fervent • The Mentor of Our Discontent • Oh No!
