        "text": "René Bazin (born Dec. 26, 1853, Angers, France—died July 20, 1932, Paris) was a French novelist of provincial life, strongly traditionalist in outlook. His works express in simple but elegant style his love of nature, of simple virtues, and of work, especially on the land.\n\nEducated in Paris and Angers, Bazin became a professor of law at the Catholic University at Angers. Throughout his life he remained close to the people and scenes of his native countryside. His early works presented an extremely idealistic view of peasant life, but after travels in Spain and Italy, begun in 1893, he acquired an insight into the universality of peasant themes that is reflected in his later, more forceful novels. La Terre qui meurt (1899; “The Dying Earth”) deals poignantly with the theme of emigration, as one by one the younger generation of a Vendée family leave their impoverished family farm to seek their fortunes in the city or in America. Les Oberlé (1901) concerns the Germanization of Alsace-Lorraine, in depicting the conflicts of divided loyalty within the Oberlé family. Donatienne (1903) is an account of the fortunes of a young Breton couple. Forced by poverty, the young mother, Donatienne, goes into service in the city, where she succumbs to the corruption of city life. The young husband, after losing his farm, leads the wretched life of a migrant worker, traveling from place to place with the children. Years after, spoiled Donatienne is reunited with her family and matter-of-factly takes up her duties as a peasant wife. Le Blé qui lève (1907; “The Rising Wheat”) portrays the corrupting influence of trade unionism on woodcutters."
