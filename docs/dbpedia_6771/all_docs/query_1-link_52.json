It concerns White Russians living in France, and uncertain which way they should jump if there was another war.\n\nDo they team up with Germany, their enemy from the Great War, and now much further from their own ideas, run by vulgar Nazis rather than a right-wing elite close to their own view? Or do they keep their heads down and hope to avoid upsetting France’s Popular Front government, which does not like them? How do they react to the Spanish Civil War?\n\nThere are also surviving links with Red Russia, especially with Tukhachevsky, from a similar social background but the Red Army’s top commander.\n\nThe real-life basis concerns General Evgenii Miller (Dobrinsky) and General Nikolai Skoblin (Fiodor). I’ll not say more, to avoid spoilers. Just that the film does not give a definite solution to the mystery, though it points to one. You can find one account on the Wikipedia. On the DVD you find Skoblin’s niece giving a very different interpretation.\n\nDespite unresolved mysteries, and some liberties taken with solid fact, I found this a very watchable film. Triple Agent\n\nÉric Rohmer2004 / 115 min.\n\nwith Katarina Didaskalu(Arsinoe), Serge Renko (Fiodor), Cirielle Claire\n\nPlot (includes spoilers):\n\nFrance, 1936. The Popular Front wins the general elections, while in Spain the Civil War begins. Meanwhile, in a Paris apartment, Fiodor Voronin, a retired general of the tsarist army lives an apparently quiet life with his Greek wife Arsinoé. He is a deputy at the White Russian Military Union, and he is slated to replace the aging general Dobrinsky soon. Unbeknownst to his wife and colleagues, he is also a Soviet agent. When Dobrinsky disappears, he is considered a suspect, and he vanishes without a trace.\n\nThe film is based on the true story of White Russian general (and secret soviet agent) Nikolai Skoblin.Comparative: see Belmondo movie, “Stavisky.”\n\nCharles Maurras\n\nAction Française\n\nCharles Maurras (April 20, 1868 – November 16, 1952) was a Frenchmonarchist poet, critic and leader and principal thinker of the reactionaryAction Françaiseanti-parliamentarist and counter-revolutionary movement.\n\nLife\n\nHe was born in Martigues in the Bouches-du-Rhônedépartement in the south of France and brought up in a Catholic, monarchist environment. In his early teens he became profoundly deaf, and subsequently lost his faith. At the age of seventeen he came to Paris and worked on a number of periodicals including La Cocarde (The Cockade), a republican review which supported Georges Boulanger, and the Catholic Observateur français. He reported on the first Olympic Games in Athens in 1896.He became involved in politics at the time of the Dreyfus affair — he was, as one can expect, extremely anti-Dreyfusard. In 1899 he joined the Action Française founded by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois the preceding year. Maurras quickly became influential in the movement, and converted Pujo and Vaugeois to monarchism, which became the movement’s principal cause. With Léon Daudet he edited the movement’s review La Revue de l’Action française, which in 1908 became a daily newspaper with the simpler title L’Action française.He supported France’s entry into the\n\nFirst World War (even to the extent of supporting the thoroughly republican Georges Clemenceau), but was ambivalent about the Second World War. He believed that the Jews, Freemasons, and Protestants sought to control the entire political life of France. Although passionate about his country, he hailed its invasion by Germany and Pétain’s accession to power as a “divine surprise.” Under the occupation, he opposed both the collaborators in Paris and the “dissidents” in London. He later claimed he believed that Pétain was playing a “double game”, working for an Allied victory in secret. Both Pétain and De Gaulle were influenced by his philosophy of integralism. He was arrested in September 1944, and sentenced to death for collaboration. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, deprivation of civil liberties and expulsion from the Académie française. He responded by exclaiming, “C’est la revanche de Dreyfus!” (It’s Dreyfus’s revenge!) Imprisoned in Riom and then Clairvaux, he was reprieved in 1952 and placed under surveillance in a clinic, where he died on November 16, 1952 — returning to Catholicism shortly before his death.\n\nMaurras’ political thought\n\nCentral to Maurras’ political ideas were an intense nationalism (what he described as “integral nationalism”) and a belief in an ordered, elitist society. These were the bases of his support for both the monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church — he had no personal loyalty to the house of Bourbon-Orléans and was an agnostic for most of his life.Like many people in Europe at the time, he was haunted by the idea of “decadence“, partly inspired by reading Taine and Renan. He felt that France had lost its grandeur during the Revolution of 1789, a grandeur inherited from its classical Roman roots and developed by, as he put it, “forty kings who in a thousand years made France.” The Revolution, he wrote in the Observateur français, was a revolt, a negative and destructive work. He traced this decline further back, to the Enlightenment and the Reformation; he described the source of the evil as “Swiss ideas”, a reference to Calvin and Rousseau. He blamed it on what he called “Anti-France”, defined as the “four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners” (his actual word for the latter being the far less polite métèques). Indeed, to him the first three were all types of internal foreigner. Anti-Semitism and anti-Protestantism were common themes in his writings. He felt that the Reformation, the Enlightenment and the Revolution had all contributed to individuals putting themselves before the nation, with consequent negative effects on the latter, and that democracy and liberalism were continuing to make matters worse.During\n\nWorld War I, Jewish businessman Emile Ullman was forced to resign from the board of directors of the “Comptoir d’Escompte” after Maurras called him an agent of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany.Although the political solutions he advocated were familiar ones for French monarchists, in many ways Maurras did not fit in with the monarchist tradition in France. His views were — at least according to him — based on reason rather than sentiment, loyalty and faith. Indeed, he was an admirer of the positivist philosopher Auguste Comte, like many of the Third Republic leaders he detested. Whereas most monarchists refused to engage in political action — by this time many had retreated into an intransigently conservative Catholicism and indifference to the affairs of a world they now saw as irredeemably wicked — Maurras was prepared to engage in political action, both orthodox and unorthodox (the Action Française’s paramilitary Camelots du Roi frequently engaged in street violence). He adopted the phrase “La politique d’abord” (politics first) as his slogan.His views on religion were also very different. He supported the Catholic Church both because it was so intimately bound up with French history and because with its hierarchical structure and distinct clerical elite it mirrored his image of an ideal society. It was, he considered, the mortar which held the nation together. However, he mistrusted the Gospels, written, as he put it, “by four obscure Jews” (Le Chemin du Paradis, 1894), and admired the Church for having managed, in his opinion, to conceal much of the Bible’s dangerous teachings. In fact, he was an advocate of a Catholicism without Christianity, insofar as it was possible.\n\nIn spite of this, he gained a large following among monarchists and Catholics, including the Assumptionists, and received the backing of the pretender himself.Nonetheless, his agnosticism worried parts of the Catholic hierarchy, and in 1926 some of his writings were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum by Pope Pius XI (the Action Française movement as a whole was condemned at the same time) — a great shock to many of his followers, who included a not inconsiderable number of the French clergy. The condemnation was lifted in 1938, the same year that Maurras was elected to the Académie française.\n\nWorks\n\n1889: Théodore Aubanel\n\n1891: Jean Moréas\n\n1894: Le Chemin du Paradis, mythes et fabliaux\n\n1896–9: Le voyage d’Athènes\n\n1898: L’idée de décentralisation\n\n1899: Trois idées politiques : Chateaubriand, Michelet, Sainte-Beuve\n\n1900: Enquête sur la monarchie\n\n1901: Anthinéa : d’Athènes à Florence\n\n1902: Les Amants de Venise, George Sand et Musset\n\n1905: L’Avenir de l’intelligence\n\n1906: Le Dilemme de Marc Sangnier\n\n1910: Kiel et Tanger\n\n1912: La Politique religieuse\n\n1914: L’Action française et la religion catholique\n\n1915: L’Étang de Berre\n\n1916: Quand les Français ne s’aimaient pas\n\n1916–8 : Les Conditions de la victoire, 4 volumes\n\n1921: Tombeaux\n\n1922: Inscriptions\n\n1923: Poètes\n\n1924: L’Allée des philosophes\n\n1925: La Musique intérieure\n\n1925: Barbarie et poésie\n\n1927: Lorsque Hugo eut les cent ans\n\n1928: Le prince des nuées.\n\n1928: Un débat sur le romantisme\n\n1928: Vers un art intellectuel\n\n1929: Corps glorieux ou Vertu de la perfection.\n\n1929: Promenade italienne\n\n1929: Napoléon pour ou contre la France\n\n1930: De Démos à César\n\n1930: Corse et Provence\n\n1930: Quatre nuits de Provence\n\n1931: Triptyque de Paul Bourget\n\n1931: Le Quadrilatère\n\n1931: Au signe de Flore\n\n1932: Heures immortelles\n\n1932–3: Dictionnaire politique et critique, 5 volumes\n\n1935: Prologue d’un essai sur la critique\n\n1937: Quatre poèmes d’Eurydice\n\n1937: L’amitié de Platon\n\n1937: Jacques Bainville et Paul Bourget\n\n1937: Les vergers sur la mer.\n\n1937: Jeanne d’Arc, Louis XIV, Napoléon\n\n1937: Devant l’Allemagne éternelle\n\n1937: Mes idées politiques\n\n1940: Pages africaines\n\n1941: Sous la muraille des cyprès\n\n1941: Mistral\n\n1941: La seule France\n\n1942: De la colère à la justice\n\n1943: Pour un réveil français\n\n1944: Poésie et vérité\n\n1944: Paysages mistraliens\n\n1944: Le Pain et le Vin\n\n1945: Au-devant de la nuit\n\n1945: L’Allemagne et nous\n\n1947: Les Deux Justices ou Notre J’accuse\n\n1948: L’Ordre et le Désordre\n\n1948: Maurice Barrès\n\n1948: Une promotion de Judas\n\n1948: Réponse à André Gide\n\n1949: Au Grand Juge de France\n\n1949: Le Cintre de Riom\n\n1950: Mon jardin qui s’est souvenu 1950\n\n1951: Tragi-comédie de ma surdité\n\n1951: Vérité, justice, patrie (with Maurice Pujo)\n\n1952: À mes vieux oliviers\n\n1952: La Balance intérieure\n\n1952: Le Beau Jeu des reviviscences\n\n1952: Le Bienheureux Pie X, sauveur de la France\n\n1953: Pascal puni (published posthumously)\n\n1958: Lettres de prison (1944–1952) (published posthumously)\n\n1966: Lettres passe-murailles, correspondance échangée avec Xavier Vallat (1950–1952) (published posthumously)\n\nPreceded by:\n\nHenri Robert Seat 16Académie française\n\n1938–1945 Succeeded by:\n\nAntoine de Lévis Mirepoix\n\nRetrieved from “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Maurras“\n\nThe Action Française is a FrenchMonarchist (Orléanist) counter-revolutionary movement and periodical founded by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois and whose principal ideologist was Charles Maurras. Although it supported the Orleanist branch, according to historian René Rémond‘s categorization of French right-wing families, it would be closer to the legitimist branch, characterized by rejection of the 1789 French Revolution‘s ideals (while the Orleanist branch is, according to Rémond, a movement which supports economic liberalism). It was founded in 1898 during the Dreyfus affair, partly in reaction to the left wing revitalisation that was happening around the defense of the army captain, launched by Emile Zola‘s famous J’accuse. Originally a nationalist organization, which attracted figures such as Maurice Barrès, it became monarchist under the influence of Maurras, following the earlier ideas of counterrevolutionary theorist Joseph de Maistre. Until its dissolution at the end of the Second World War, the Action Française was a prominent proponent of far rightintegral nationalism, which regarded the nation as an organic entity of blood and soil.\n\nIdeology\n\nThe ideology of the Action Française was dominated by the thought of Charles Maurras, following his adherence and his conversion of the movement’s founders to monarchism. The Action Française supported a restoration of the monarchy and, after the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State, the restoration of Roman Catholicism as the state religion, even though Maurras was an agnostic. It should not be considered that the movement intended to restore real power to the king, merely to set him up as a rallying point in distinction to the Third Republic of France which was considered corrupt and unworkable by many of its opponents, whom they hoped to come to their banner. The movement advocated decentralisation (a “federal monarchy”), with the restoration of pre-Revolutionary “liberties” to the ancient provinces of France (replaced during the Revolution by the departmental system). It aimed to achieve a restoration by means of a coup d’état, probably involving a transitional authoritarian government.The Action Française was not focused on denouncing one social or political group as the conspiratorial source of ills befalling France. Different groups of the French far right had especial animus against either the Jews, Protestants, or Freemasons. To these Maurras added unspecific foreigners residing in France, who had been outside of French law under the ancien regime, and to whom he invented a slur name derived from ancient Greek history: métèques. These four groups of “internal foreigners” Maurras called les quatre états confédérés and were all considered to be part of “Anti-France.” Of course he was also opposed to socialism, and, after the 1917 October Revolution, to communists, but antagonism against them did not have to be constructed or marshalled (although the Protestants and the Freemasons were traditional supporters of the Republic, pejoratively called la gueuze by the AF, and were thus in general left-wing).\n\n1898 – 1926\n\nThe AF movement published a review, the Bulletin de l’Action française, which subsequently became the Revue de l’Action Française and then, in 1908, a daily paper Action Française (first edition on 21 March1908). It gained large number of readers outside the movement, with a diffusion of 30 000, and made Maurras a significant figure in French politics, his influence extending far beyond the extreme right. The daily was edited by Léon Daudet, son of the writer Alphonse Daudet, and other contributors included the historian Jacques Bainville, the critic Jules Lemaître and the economist Georges Valois, who later left the movement to found the fascistFaisceau.The Camelots du Roy were recruited in 1908 to sell the paper, but they also served as the movement’s youth paramilitary wing, regularly engaging in street violence with political opponents. In this period the Action Française became a significant actor in French politics, in particular among the students’ of the Quartier latin. However, its rise caused some concern among the Roman Catholic hierarchy.\n\nPapal condemnation and decline\n\nIn spite of the Action Française’s support for Roman Catholicism as state religion and the fact that the vast majority of its members were practising Catholics (indeed, they included significant numbers of clergy), some Catholics regarded it with distrust.\n\nMuch of this was due to Maurras’ influence, an agnostic whose advocacy of Catholicism was due to his belief that it was a factor of social cohesion and stability and to its importance in French history. This rather utilitarian view of religion disturbed people who were often in agreement with many of Maurras’ ideas. Its influence on young Catholics was also considered problematic. Thus, on 29 December1926, Pope Pius XI condemned the Action Française. Several of Maurras’ writings were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum at the same time, as well as the newspaper. This was a devastating blow for the movement. On 8 March1927 the AF members were prohibited from receiving the sacraments. Many of its members left (two Catholics who were forced to look for a different path in politics and life were writers François Mauriac and Georges Bernanos); and it entered a period of decline.In 1939, following the Spanish Civil War and a revival of anti-communism in the Catholic Church, Pope Pius XII decided to end the condemnation. Thereafter, the Action Française claimed that the condemnation was decided for political purposes.\n\nThe inter-war revival\n\nDespite the 1926 Papal condemnation, the Action Française remained popular during the inter-war period, being one of the most important far right leagues, along with the Croix-de-Feu and others. As increasing numbers of people in France (as in Europe as a whole) turned to authoritarian political movements, many turned to the Action Française. It thus continued to recruit members from the new generations, such as Robert Brasillach (who would become an unfamous collaborationist), Thierry Maulnier, Lucien Rebatet, etc. It was marginally represented for a time in the Chamber of Deputies, notably by Léon Daudet, elected in the right-wing Chambre bleue horizon (1919-1924).However, with the rise of fascism and the creation of seemingly fascist leagues, added to the 1926 Papal condemnation, the royalist movement was also struck by various dissidence: Georges Valois would create the fascist Faisceau, Louis Dimier would split apart, while other members created the terroristLa Cagoule group.The Action Française spearheaded the\n\n6 February 1934 crisis, which led to the fall of the second Cartel des gauches and ot the replacement of RadicalEdouard Daladier by conservative Gaston Doumergue. In foreign policy, Maurras and Bainville supported the alliance with Mussolini‘s Italy against Nazi Germany. Like most French nationalists, the movement regarded Germany as the major threat to France. Apart of Mussolini’s fascist government, the Action Française greeted Franco‘s appearance with delight, and supported the self-proclaimed Caudillo during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39).Marshal Philippe Pétain‘s proclamation of the Vichy regime after the failure of the Battle of France was acclaimed by Maurras as a “divine surprise”, and he rallied the collaborationist regime. Royalist members hoped that Pétain would restore the monarchy, and the Action Française’s headquarters were moved from Paris to Vichy. However, the AF members were split between supporting the counterrevolutionary regime and their nationalism: after 1942, and in particular in 1943, some members, such as Henri d’Astier de la Vigerie, Pierre Guillain de Bénouville or Honoré d’Estienne d’Orves joined the Resistance or escaped to join the Free French Forces. Others actively collaborated, while Maurras supported the Vichy government, but theoretically opposed Pétain’s collaboration with the Germans. After the Liberation, he was condemned to death in 1944, though he was reprieved in 1952. The Action Française was dissolved in 1944.\n\nSince World War II\n\nThe Action Française reformed itself in 1947, under the influence of Maurice Pujo who created the newspaper Aspects de la France (AF) and the counterrevolutionary movement, “la Restauration Nationale” (“National Restauration”). After Maurras’s death in 1952, two rival newspapers, Aspects de la France and Pierre Boutang‘s La Nation Française revived the Maurassian legacy, until the demise of La Nation Française in 1967. In 1971, a breakaway movement, the “Nouvelle Action Française” was formed by Bertrand Renouvin. It subsequently became the “Nouvelle Action Royaliste”, which supported the Orleanist heir (although in his 1968 reprinting of his study on the three French right-wing families, René Rémond still classified in the legitimist movement because of its counterrevolutionary ideology). The movement called to support François Mitterrand in the 1981 presidential election, instead of supporting Jacques Chirac‘s “neo-Gaullism” movement (the Gaullists are classed by René Rémond as Bonapartists) or Valéry Giscard d’Estaing‘s “Orleanist” movement (because of his support of economic liberalism).In the beginning of the 1980s, various AF figures, such as Georges-Paul Wagner or Philippe Colombani joined the ranks of Jean-Marie Le Pen‘s National Front (FN). Until the 1999 breakaway of the National Republican Movement (MNR) led by Bruno Mégret, Jean-Marie Le Pen’s success was partly explained by his unification of the various far right families (Traditionalist Catholics, royalists, neofascists and neonazis, etc., which have few ideals to share together, apart of a despise for the liberal democracy and their anti-communism). However, the movement still exists as the monarchist and anti-European Union “Centre royaliste d’Action Française”, and publishes a magazine Action Française 2000.\n\nJudgement of political scientists\n\nIn the 1960s, political scientist Ernst Nolte considered the Action Française to be the first fascist party, and the most manipulative and duplicitous of fascist parties. But his viewpoint is generally considered extreme, and the movement is not considered as historically important as the fascisms which gained power on their own.More recently, Israeli historian Zeev Sternhell has cited the group, along with its predecessor Boulangism and Georges Valois‘ syndicalistCercle Proudhon, as a major, direct intellectual influence on fascism.According to historian\n\nRené Rémond‘s famous classification of French right-wing families, the Action Française belongs to the legitimistcounterrevolutionary movement, which rejects all progress since the 1789 French Revolution.\n\nFictional accounts\n\nIn Harry Turtledove‘s American Empire alternate history books, the Action Française becomes a popular movement in France following the nation’s defeat in the Great War. By the early 1930s, it has placed France under the rule of King Charles XI, and spends the decade rearming for a rematch with Germany. After Kaiser Wilhelm‘s death in 1941, Action Francaise declares war on Germany, but its offensive by early 1942 has stalled at the Rhine and outside Hamburg.\n\nSee also\n\n6 February 1934 crisis\n\nAnti-parliamentarism\n\nMonarchism\n\nFrench Third Republic (1870-1940) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_agent_(film)\n\nEugen Weber: The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s.\n\nNew York & London: W.W. Norton & Company, 1994. xii + 352 pp. Illustrations, bibliographical references, index. $25.00 US, ISBN 0-393-03671-5.\n\nReviewed by: Odile Sarti, adjunct faculty at the University of Cincinnati and Sinclair Community College.\n\nPublished by:H-France (April, 1996) Eugen Weber has given us a well-documented but pessimistic portrait of France in the 1930s. He relies on a large variety of primary sources to recapture the mood of the era. His choice of photographs is excellent. The Hollow Years is well written and easy to follow, even for those not well versed in French history.\n\nMany authors have tried to understand the defeat of 1940 by scrutinizing the 1930s. Older works, especially in France, have been polemical. They blamed the Left or the Communists, or they denounced a decadent and venal Republic for plunging France, ill-prepared, into an unnecessary war. Others, like Marc Bloch in his wrenching account L’Etrange Defaite, and in William Shirer’s The Collapse of the Third Republic, have outlined various factors leading up to the defeat of 1940.\n\nThe debate continues. Most recently, Anthony Adamthwaite in Grandeur & Misery: France’s Bid for Power in Europe 1914-1940 has argued that 1940 was above all a military defeat. He notes that the tragedy of these years actually went back to the early 1920s, when France lacked the will to exploit the victory of 1918. While Adamthwaite concentrates on foreign policy, some of his arguments are similar to Weber’s, though they would disagree on at least one point. Adamthwaite comments that “Crisis, not decline or decadence, best defines France’s predicament…. A crisis of confidence” (p. 231). Weber would say “decadence” was the main cause of French defeat.\n\nIn his article “Le Desastre de 1940” in Etudes sur la France de 1939 a nos Jours, Stanley Hoffmann opined that historians should examine the mentality of the French people in the 1930s to comprehend better the causes of defeat in 1940. Weber’s The Hollow Years may be the answer to Hoffmann’s entreaty. Weber’s book tries to recapture the French mood by looking at the fears, beliefs, prejudices, and behavior of French people in the 1930s. Weber tells us that his book is about “among other things, above other things…the inexorable march to war of a society that was, and yet was not, helpless to affect its fate” (p. 6).J.-B. Duroselle, among others, emphasized the lingering and negative impact of the Great War in his La Decadence and L’Abime. Weber picks up the same thread. According to the author, the 1930s actually started in August 1914: the memory of the Great War was very much alive in the 1930s. But people remembered not the victory, not the heroism of the French poilu, but the butchery, the trauma of losing a husband or a son or sons. Physical and psychological wounds were deeply embedded in the consciousness of the French people. War was a horror to be avoided at all cost. Patriotism was dead. It had died in the trenches (p. 17).\n\nFear of war, Weber notes, made the French forget that force or the threat of force could stop German aggression. “One thing no one bothered to pretend was that force existed to be used” (p. 244). The army embraced a defensive strategy and “soldiers forgot that attack at times could be the best defense” (p. 244). Army leaders did not trust the morale of their troops and the troops did not trust the competence of their generals. When war was declared, the French sat and waited for the Germans to take the initiative.\n\nThe Hollow Years is about more than pacifism or defeatism. Throughout the book, Weber presents numerous testimonies to illustrate how the 1930s were “increasingly morose, ill at ease” (p. 6). Every event, every crisis, every development of the decade deepened that mood and eventually paralyzed the nation.\n\nPessimism was fed by the Great Depression, which came to France later than elsewhere, but lasted longer. Weber mentions that unemployment, based on official figures, was lower than elsewhere due to the demographic crisis and that “few men who were less than fifty experienced the demeaning sense of long-term uselessness that so many felt in the British Isles” (p. 35). Yet the author reminds us that the French were affected by loss of jobs, declining income, bankruptcy, and other by-products of the depression. Governments concentrated on defending the franc and balancing the budget, which increased hardship and delayed recovery. People imitated the government by tightening their belts, further depressing demand for manufactured goods. “The spirit of Thomas Malthus ruled over the land” (p. 54). Economists blamed the depression on too many machines and overproduction!\n\nPoliticians further contributed to the unsettled atmosphere of the decade. Weber considers them to have been ineffective: “What seems more striking is how extraordinarily difficult the governors made government, and how tenuous. Their time and energy drained in endless jockeying and parliamentary maneuvers, political figures found less opportunity to address issues that clamored for attention…” (p. 113). Governments of the Left were no more successful than governments of the Right in solving the country’s problems. Scandals were never-ending. People lost faith in government and the state. Instead, they went on strikes and demonstrated or brawled in the streets to proclaim their discontents. In the end, troubled citizens blamed and scorned their political representatives, while “[t]he representatives in public blamed each other, [but] in private disparaged the electorate they wooed” (p. 112).\n\nWeber continues: “The problems of the nation might have looked clearer if the nation had been more clearly one” (p. 113). The Hollow Years recounts the deep divisions in French society. Modernizers opposed traditionalists, technocrats offended individualists, Catholics battled anti-clericals and each other, and Leftists fought the Right and among themselves. These divisions played out in politics, in economics, in religion. Internal affairs dictated responses to foreign crises. The Popular Front government’s reaction to the Spanish civil war (July 1936) provides an illustration: “Would the Left coalition in Paris lend aid to the Left coalition threatened by Franco’s rebels? Of course. And then, no” (p. 166).\n\nAccording to the author, newspapers became carriers of disorder and anxiety (p. 131). The Parisian press was corrupt and “readers had no way of knowing whether facts had been distorted, suppressed, even invented…” (p. 130). Books, films, and articles played upon the xenophobia and anti-Semitism always latent in France. It was easier to blame foreigners and Jews for all the nation’s woes than to face up to hard and complex verities. Stories about scandals and bankruptcies sold more newspapers. Anti-Americanism was also popular. People took refuge in detective stories and exoticism.\n\nWomen had little to cheer about. Weber points out the difficulties professional women experienced: “Welcomed during and after the war, tolerated as times got harder, by 1934 and 1935 women found themselves brutally sidelined or expelled with a minimum of formalities or excuses” (p. 83). For most women, housework was hindered by the lack of such modern conveniences as refrigerators, washing machines, or good stoves, compliments of the inefficiency and backward mentality of French industry. While acknowledging some progress in the legal status of women, Weber affirms that women were still considered “second-class workers, second-class citizens” (p. 84). The vote was beyond their reach.\n\nOther aspects of French life depicted in The Hollow Years reinforce the sense of confusion and disorder that seemed to reign in the country. As Weber recounts his sorrowful tale of the thirties, the reader looks to the author’s view of the 1940 defeat. Was it all inevitable, preordained, because of the fear and divisions so aptly described in the book? Weber tells us that 1940 was a military defeat, but “political decadence–failure of thought and policy–must also bear some responsibility for military defeat” (p. 246). Weber also blames the Phony War: “The conclusion is hard to avoid that the long months of inaction…sapped what resolution there had been and prepared the rout to come” (p. 272). However, the scenario of defeat was not preordained. Weber strongly believes that men and women “are not objects of history–playthings of tides, currents, laws that they can’t inflect. They are responsible subjects: actors who write and rewrite their script while moving from one decision to the next or, failing to decide, resign the script to others” (p. 6). The French were, theoretically, masters of their destiny. Weber concludes that “The French of the 1930s would not, could not decide. They allowed others to forge their destiny and had to pay for this abdication” (p. 6). Weber does not tell us clearly what it is the French could not decide. Is the reader to infer that the French could not decide whether to stand up to Hitler or not? Certainly the Phony War would provide a case in point for Weber’s argument: France declared war, but refrained from fighting until attacked. But in other instances, France did choose. Contrary to Weber’s inference, France chose peace at all costs to avoid a repetition of 1914. Ultimately, that choice was wrong, but it was a choice nevertheless. Adamthwaite in Grandeur and Misery has argued that France chose to deal with Hitler through “diplomacy–in other words, appeasement. The objective was a European settlement negotiated from strength….But, the hope was that, with perseverance and German goodwill, a satisfactory compromise could be negotiated quickly–avoiding war and a ruinous arms race” (p. 209). Weber does not specify what alternative course of action the French could have pursued to stop German aggression. Should they have marched in 1936 to stop the remilitarization of the Rhineland? Should they have gone to the defense of Czechoslovakia in 1938? Weber says that the anti-Munichois, those who opposed the “lickspittle policy” of capitulation, “thought less of fighting Germans than of calling Hitler’s bluff. Rightly persuaded that the dictator could have been faced in 1936, they thought that a challenge in 1938 would have the same effect. They did not stop to consider that France in 1938 was relatively much weaker not only in armaments but in manpower…” (p. 177). Is the reader to conclude that France missed its chance in 1936 and that by 1938, it was too late?\n\nThe tone of The Hollow Years is not one of sympathy. Maybe none is due. “Personal commitment, responsibility, creativity, honor alone offered a little hope amidst growing despair. Not placing blame on foreigners, politicians, capitalists, or collectivists. But that only became clearer after 1940, and even then to far from all” (p. 236). France ignored the admonitions of those who advocated resistance to fascism. While agreeing with the author that one has to accept the consequences of one’s action or inaction and that people, not institutions, make history, a reader might wonder whether there was really anyone of integrity and courage left in France in the 1930s. The Hollow Years does mention that some people were patriots and saw fascism for the evil that it was. Yet, those individuals are almost absent from Weber’s story. Is it because they had little impact on their compatriots?\n\nWeber has harsh words for the France of the 1930s: “a developed country in an advanced stage of decay” (p. 7). French democracy fares no better. France “was ruled, as Athens was, by the will of little people and of middling people, and by the demagogues they elected; it was taught by the Sophists, whom Plato had denounced; it was hobbled less by the unimaginative self-confidence of the Spartans than by moral laziness and fear” (p. 5). Given this perspective, a reader might almost applaud the fact that the Third Republic did not survive 1940. Yet, that same reader may want to consider, as Adamthwaite did, that for all of its weaknesses, France was still an island of democracy in a sea of dictatorship and totalitarian regimes.\n\nWeber’s book is well worth reading. It provides vivid descriptions of everyday life sometimes forgotten in the midst of foreign crises and high politics, and leaves one wanting to know more about many of the individuals and groups that lived during this fateful decade. One also wishes for Weber to pick up the story in a new book and show how some of the creative trends described in The Hollow Years blossomed in the forties and thereafter, and assisted with the postwar recovery. The subject has been covered before, but Weber would surely bring us interesting and challenging insights.\n\nLibrary of Congress Call Number: DC389 .W35 1994\n\nSubjects:\n\nFrance–History–1914-1940\n\nReconstruction (1914-1939)–France\n\nDepressions–1929–France, Germany–Relations–France\n\nEugen Weber\n\nThe Hollow Years France in the 1930s\n\n“[Told with] learning and verve. . . .
