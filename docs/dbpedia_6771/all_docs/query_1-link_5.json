        "text": "[1]\n\nMany studies of Camus position him within debates about the Cold War or decolonization: Connor Cruise O’Brien, Camus (London: Fontana/Collins, 1970); Herbert Lottman, Albert Camus, a Biography (City Garden, NY: Doubleday & Company, 1979); Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism (New York: Vintage, 1994); Philip Dine, Images of the Algerian War: French Fiction and Film, 1954–1992 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994); Abdelkader Djemaï, Camus à Oran (Paris: Éditions Michalon, 1995); Olivier Todd, Camus, une vie (Paris: Éditions Gallimard, 1996); Emily Apter, “Out of Character: Camus’s French Algerian Subjects,” MLN 112, no. 4, French Issue (September 1997): 499–516; Christiane Chaulet-Achour Albert Camus, Alger: “L’Étranger” et autres récits (Paris: Éditions Séguier, 1998); Dominick LaCapra, History and Memory after Auschwitz (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1998); Tony Judt, The Burden of Responsibility: Blum, Camus, Aron and the French Twentieth Century (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998); James LeSueur, Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics during the Decolonization of Algeria (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press); Azzedine Haddour, Colonial Myths: History and Narrative (Manchester, UK: Manchester University Press, 2000); Patricia Lorcin, “Recovering Colonial Algeria’s Latin Past,” French Historical Studies 25, no. 2 (Spring 2002); David Carroll, Albert Camus the Algerian: Colonialism, Terrorism, Justice (New York: Columbia University Press, 2008); Robert Zaretsky, Albert Camus: Elements of a Life (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2010); Christopher Churchill, “Camus and the Theatre of Terror: Artaudian Dramaturgy and Settler Society in the Works of Albert Camus,” Modern Intellectual History 7, no1. (2010).\n\n[2]\n\n“If there is one conviction that scholars and non-scholars share, it is that Camus is still an indispensable companion in our intellectual and ethical lives. He appears to us, in a way that few other writers do, as someone who wrote for his life and for our lives as well.” (Zaretsky, 2). Carroll goes so far as to cheekily argue that Camus’ writing might have better informed the Pentagon in its development of a strategy in the “Global War on Terror” and the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq. (Carroll, 180).\n\n[3]\n\nCarroll presents scholars like Conor Cruise O’Brien and Edward Said as being “on the ‘Camus-as-colonialist’ side,” of debates about the political nature of Camus’ writing (Carroll, 13). He argues to foreground colonialist readings of Camus’ work is “to judge and indict Camus,” which for Carroll “is not to read him; it is not to treat his literary texts in terms of the specific questions they actually raise, the contradictions they confront, and the uncertainties and dilemmas they express. It is not to read them in terms of their narrative strategies and complexity.” (Carroll, 15). Zaretsky defends Camus from criticism, notably but not exclusively by Simone de Beauvoir, that he remained relatively silent on the Algerian War of Independence. Zaretsky defends Camus’ position by arguing it embodies an ethic of silence he conflates with Ludwig Wittgenstein. (Zaretsky, 145–50).\n\n[4]\n\nZaretsky, 6.\n\n[5]\n\nCarroll, 36. Carroll’s introduction even suggests that a French Algerian identity was incommensurable with Barrèsian ideas of rootedness. See Carroll, 3 and 189n. For Carroll’s excellent study of Barrès and other proto-fascist and fascist intellectuals, see David Carroll, French Literary Fascism: Nationalism, Anti-Semitism, and the Ideology of Culture (Princeton, NY: Princeton University Press, 1995). Carroll is too insightful a scholar of Camus not to note some of his affinities with intellectuals often assigned to the far right. For instance, Carroll observes resemblances between Camus and Charles Péguy, however, the comparison is relegated to a footnote. Carroll, Albert Camus the Algerian, 227n. In fairness to Carroll, as with other scholars, locating Camus’ far-right affinities is not a priority of their studies.\n\n[6]\n\nDavid Meakin, “‘Un classicisme créateur’: Charles Péguy and Albert Camus,” Forum for Modern Language Studies VIII, no 2 (1972): 184–93; Emily Apter, Continental Drift: From National Characters to Virtual Subjects (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999); Patricia Lorcin, “Rome and France in Africa: Recovering Colonial Algeria’s Latin Past,” French Historical Studies 25, no. 2 (Spring 2002). For all the works that present Camus as a paradigmatic figure of the left, and given his profound and avowed debts to Malraux and Gide, if one sifts through the voluminous scholarship on Camus, a very few critics have nonetheless pointed out morphological similarities or historical connections between Camus and figures associated with the far right. David Carroll, who has written on both Camus and Péguy, notes several points of commonality between the two, particularly what he calls their shared celebration of “the civic virtues of poverty and anonymity.” (Carroll, Albert Camus the Algerian, 227n). Jacques Hardré devoted an entire essay to Camus’ and Péguy’s shared ideas and commitments. Jacques Hardré, “Charles Péguy et Albert Camus: esquisse d’un parallèle,” The French Review 40, no. 4 (February 1967): 471–84. Camus’ long-time friend and fellow settler Pascal Pia saw similarities between Camus’ La Chute and the works of Pierre Drieu la Rochelle. (Todd, 648). John Stanley, in an essay seeking to inoculate Georges Sorel from charges of fascism, links him instead to Camus: “If we can make any comparisons of ‘Sorelianism’ with existing theories, it is not with Fascism but with Albert Camus’ ideas on rebellion, an act of refusal to existing repression, from revolution, which attacks the existing order with a plan for future organization and a theory of historical destiny.” John Stanley, From Georges Sorel: Essays in Socialism and Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1976), 44. Of course by 1910, Sorel had renounced syndicalism for a Maurrassian politics of monarchism and ultra-nationalism, and was publishing alongside Maurice Barrès. But Stanley is at least correct that Camus did indeed draw extensively on Sorel in his L’Homme révolté, and like many French readers, Camus appreciated Péguy.\n\n[7]\n\nStanley.\n\n[8]\n\nMichel Mohrt, “Ethic and Poetry in the Work of Camus,” trans.

For overviews of the avant-garde and other French intellectuals, the works of Pascal Ory and Jean-François Sirinelli are indispensible.

See also Eugen Weber, France, Fin-de-siècle (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1986).\n\n[13]\n\nRobert Soucy, Fascism in France: The Case of Maurice Barrès (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1972); David Carroll, French Literary Fascism: Nationalism, Anti-Semitism, and the Ideology of Culture (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995). The term aesthetic-political is here used as Carroll employs it in his study French Literary Fascism. Carroll’s work identifies the crucial way in which aesthetic concepts structured the cultural and political writings of proto-fascist and fascist French intellectuals (Carroll, French Literary Fascism, 20, passim). Many if not most cultural studies of fascism, and there are increasingly many, assume as a starting point Walter Benjamin‘s observation that fascism introduces aesthetics into political life. Walter Benjamin, “The World of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” in The Continental Aesthetics Reader, ed. Clive Cazeaux (New York: Routledge, 2000), 322–43.\n\n[14]\n\nThis opinion is corroborated by George Putnam: “The glorification of the nation and the belief in dialectical process, the conviction that all is ‘becoming’ and hence relative, are notions which Hegelians never relinquish. These two ideas, along with the particular notion of the nature of freedom ... are the Hegelian concepts employed most often and most thoroughly by Barrès.” George Putnam, “The Meaning of Barrèsisme,” Political Research Quarterly 7 (1954), 172.\n\n[15]\n\nSoucy, 72.\n\n[16]\n\nMaurice Barrès, Le Culte du moi II: Un homme libre (BiblioBazaare, 2008), 15.\n\n[17]\n\nPaul Bourget, Quelques témoignages, vol. 2 (Paris: Librairie Plon, 1928), 178.\n\n[18]\n\n“The reason for Barrès’ success, according to Aragon, is the very fact for which he is usually criticized: he has been openly a ‘partisan’ …. The content of this political chronicle may be reactionary; its technique is avant-garde.” (Grover, 543).\n\n[19]\n\nAs we will see, Camus’ use of Barrès is selective and utilized for ends distinct than those of Barrès. For good examples of works in which the social analyses of theorists are utilized productively by scholars/intellectuals with other political commitments, see Arthur L. Greil, Georges Sorel and the Sociology of Virtue (Washington D.C.: University Press of America, 1981); Frank Pearce, The Radical Durkheim, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press, 2001).\n\n[20]\n\nIf the Vichy Regime that met the fall of France to Nazi Germany consistently applied anti-Semitic measures beyond the desires of Nazi officials, settler representatives from Algeria consistently demanded even further persecution. As Michael Marrus and Robert Owen Paxton sum up the pressures on the Vichy administration regarding anti-Jewish legislation: “It was Vichy that felt pressured by Algiers in Jewish matters, rather than vice versa.” Michael Marrus and Robert Owen Paxton, Vichy France and the Jews (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1995), 194. They note that Émile Morinaud wrote in Le Républicain de Constantine in 1940 of “the joy that gripped the French when they learned that the Pétain government was at last repealing the odious (Crémieux) Decree.” (Marrus and Paxton, 193–4). Ferhat Abbas by contrast condemned removing Jews’ civil status, as he argued that Algerian Muslims would find it difficult to celebrate a people now being treated in the same ways as Muslims had all along in the colony. In fact, the virulence of racial supremacy in settler society was so intense, consistent, and pervasive, that it preceded the violence of the Dreyfus Affair and lasted beyond the terrorism of the Organisation de l’Armée Secrète. Ferhat Abbas, Le Jeune Algérien (1930): de la colonie vers la province; suivi de, Rapport au Maréchal Pétain (avril 1941) (Paris: Garnier, 1981), passim.\n\n[21]\n\nMolle’s and Lambert’s organizations, especially popular in Oran, adopted many of the far right fantasies of Barrès, Maurras, and, particularly, settler intellectual Louis Bertrand in their programs, including that the settler community was united as a Latin race on African shores, and constituted in their opposition to Jews, and their supremacy over Arabs.

On the Algerian press generally, see Gosnell; Zahir Ihaddadden, Histoire de la presse indigène en Algérie: les origines jusqu’en 1930 (Alger: ENAL, 1983).\n\n[24]\n\nMax Nordau, Écrits sionistes (Paris: Librairie Lipschutz,1936), 68.\n\n[25]\n\nA good discussion of literary prizes and the Algérianistes can be found in the unpublished manuscript by Jean Pomier in CAOM, fonds Arnaud, 75 APOM 49. It should be worth noting that although they explicitly saw themselves as propagandists for a new settler race, these writers primarily marketed their works to a metropolitan audience.\n\n[26]\n\nPeter Dunwoodie, Writing French Algeria (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998).\n\n[27]\n\nFor more on the nexus between far right organizations in France and Algeria and French intellectuals, see Christopher Churchill, “Neo-Traditionalist Fantasies: Colonialism, Modernism and Fascism in Greater France, 1890–1962” (Ph.D. diss., Queen’s University, 2010).\n\n[28]\n\nIn Guy Pervillé’s classic study of French-educated Algerian élites, he notes that “with Ahmed Taleb[-Ibrahimi] as well as with Ferhat Abbas, one finds a curious syncretism between the heritage of the republican school system and that of Charles Maurras, proof of the ideological eclecticism of many Algerian intellectuals.” Guy Pervillé, Les étudiants algériens de l’université française 1880–1962 (Paris: CNRS, 1984), 272n. Pervillé’s assessment is more than a little condescending, as presumably this distinguishes Algerian intellectuals from French or settler intellectuals who do not betray any curious syncretisms of French ideas — where Algerian intellectuals were syncretic, they were engaged with French, Arabic, and Tamazight, and more global sources. Even the most francophile assimilationist Rabah Zenati regularly cited Arabic sources from beyond Algeria and the Maghrib. Nonetheless, Pervillé is correct in the appearance of far-right ideas among intellectuals attempting to assimilate to an image of republican France, who were at the same time repudiating the virulent racism of a fascizing settler society. Zenati, the non plus ultra of Algerian assimilationists, repudiated what he saw as the hybridized settlers by employing Maurras’s racializing term “métêque,” or the citizen-foreigner, itself drawn from the ancient Greek μετοίκος (originally meaning for those who were with, but not of, the household). “All the harm comes from the detestable mentality acquired by Europeans in this country. We have mentioned this mentality many times; we have shown how it differs from the qualities by which the French distinguish themselves. Under the burning sun of Algeria in which all the peoples seem to meld, we have lately written that the French spirit suffers here from a distressing transformation and that it tends to distinguish itself in a hybrid manner which we have called the Métèque spirit.” Zenati, “Le Chaos Algérien,” La Voix Indigène no. 168 (Thursday, 16 February 1933).\n\n[29]\n\nPatricia Lorcin, Imperial Identities: Stereotyping, Prejudice and Race in Colonial Algeria (London: I.B.

Reading them against his essays and how his ideas developed over time clarifies many preoccupations of these texts, which can otherwise be easily passed over. But one still needs to be cautious in using them uncritically. One of the problems dogging studies of Camus is that he was notorious for scattering his correspondence, even burning it. Camus’ notebooks, with pages missing and perhaps reordered, should also be read cautiously, for they are in part notes to himself, and in part a performance of becoming an intellectual that were later realized by having them published for readers; the publishing of personal journals and notebooks has its own intellectual genealogy, including those of Valéry, Gide, and Barrès. And Camus’ own recollections are often paradoxical, for instance the conflicting accounts of his experiences in the Communist Party, as well as his relationship to other Franco-Algerian writers. In 1955, he wrote to Roger Quilliot, whom he had chosen as the editor of his works, that he had left the Communist Party in 1935 after Pierre Laval’s visit to Moscow. This contradicts other recollections from friends and colleagues, including Amar Ouzegane, letters to Jean Grenier, and to some degree his position as organizer of the communist-led Maison de la Culture in 1937.

Justin O’Brien (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1965), 78, 5–6.\n\n[44]\n\nFor instance, writer Isabelle Eberhardt’s trans-European, trans-Mediterranean and trans-Saharan nomadic journeys were celebrated by Barrès and Jean Moréas as models of exoticism and classicism — not far from how she remains in contemporary English-language scholarship. See Maurice Barrès, “La Séduction de l’Islam,” Journal de ma vie extérieure (Paris: Éditions Julliard, 1994), 93. Jean Moréas writes of how her romantic literary style (in her descriptions of the Sahara) made him feel as if he were communing among Roman ruins. Isabelle Eberhardt, Variations sur la vie et les livres (Paris: Mercure de France, 1910), 255–61. For a perceptive correction to the hagiography surrounding Eberhardt, see Julia Clancy-Smith, “The ‘Passionate Nomad’ Reconsidered: A European Woman in l’Algérie Française,” in Western Women and Imperialism: Complicity and Resistance, eds. Nupur Chaudhuri and Margaret Strobel (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1992), 61–78.\n\n[45]\n\nApter, “Out of Character,” 510. Camus’ notes, in which he claims to have overcome the dialectic between Barrès and Gide, strongly supports Apter’s analysis of Camus as a “nationless regionalist.” She places him uneasily between the poles of a nationless cosmopolitan and rooted settler, precisely the distinction he himself makes in his own notebook musings on Barrès and Gide. In Apter’s thought-provoking Continental Drift, she examines Barrès’ arboric discourse of cultural deracination and rootedness, and draws attention to the recurrence of this discourse in the writings of André Gide, Simone Weil, Pierre Bourdieu, and Abdelmalek Sayad. She also observes, “Barrèsianism was, of course, a historic ingredient in the ideological confection of ‘L’Algérie française,’ despite the fact that the very expression French Algeria is a contradiction in terms according to Barrèsian principles of ecocentric nationalism.” (Apter, Continental Drift, 35).\n\n[46]\n\nAndré Gide, Prétextes, réflexions sur quelques points de littérature et de morale (Paris: Mercure de France, 1929), 45. In the original French, Gide writes, “J’ai donc pris le parti de voyager,” in which he is also announcing his parti pris opposite Barrès.\n\n[47]\n\nApter, “Out of Character,” 510. Gide found fault with Barrès’ writerly need to dominate the reader’s own freedom by forcing them into this aesthetic reconstitution within the nation, by subsuming every detail in his works to his general thesis: “Was it that these events were not eloquent enough by themselves? Was it that you feared that one was not thinking what you think? It is thus, perhaps, that if you had let free the reader’s spirit, they would have concluded differently?” (Gide, 47). Gide, himself an early devotée of Barrès, here distorts his repudiated maître’s work, by bifurcating Barrès’ narrative evolution from deracinated aesthete to rooted nationalist. Gide identifies with the early Barrès, but quarantines the later rooted nationalist identity to Barrès. He thus appropriates the nomadic journey of continuous becoming evidenced in Barrès’ early writings for himself as the antithesis of Barrès.\n\n[48]\n\nThese competing claims were further complicated by the fact that although Barrès had died in 1923, a debate had ensued in the inter-war period, as to what he would have thought of his epigones. These debates anticipated André Gide’s eventual pairing of Barrès with Hitler during World War II.\n\n[49]\n\nCamus,” Essais, 1403.\n\n[50]\n\nSee in particular Malraux’s Nietzschean-inspired epistolary work, La Tentation de l’Occident.

Zaretsky, who strives to show Camus as a complex figure, reiterates this same problematic passage of Lottman’s but never reconciles these reviews with his claim in his introduction that those on the right who read Camus today misunderstand him. (Zaretsky, 79).\n\n[77]\n\nSee Jean-Paul Sartre, “An Explication of The Stranger” in Camus: A Collection of Critical Essays, Third Edition, ed. Germaine Brée (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1972). Lottman notes that in Maurice Nadeau’s review of L’Homme révolté for Combat, he critiqued Camus’ Mediterranean racialism. Francis Jeanson’s blistering review, “Albert Camus ou l’âme révoltée,” and the ensuing debate in the pages of Les Temps Modernes, would be the last straw between Camus and Sartre. Jeanson saw the work as moving Camus from the left to the right: “In my eyes, it all seems as if Camus is in search of a refuge for himself, straining in advance to justify an eventual ‘disconnection’.” Francis Jeanson, “Albert Camus ou l’âme révoltée,” Les Temps Modernes (May 1952): 2086. This work would only deepen the divide that had already grown between himself and Sartre over issues concerning post-war French society, communism, and the so-called “Algerian question,” that is, Algerians’ struggles for independence.\n\n[78]\n\nJean Grenier, Essai sur l’esprit d’orthodoxie (Paris: Gallimard, 1938). He confessed to Grenier his estrangement from, and even ignorance of, the “situation” in Algeria, and he hoped that Grenier of all people would appreciate L’Homme révolté’s message. Grenier did not.\n\n[79]\n\nJean Grenier, Carnets: 1944–1971 (Paris: Seghers, 1991), 110. Grenier detailed this exchange in his notebooks, but this is a testament to Camus appreciably distinct from the one he more tactfully provided in his memorialization of Camus upon the latter’s death in Jean Grenier, Albert Camus: souvenirs (Paris: Gallimard, 1968).\n\n[80]\n\nGrenier, Carnets, 112. It seems only Olivier Todd has cited components of this conversation in his biography of Camus, but excises most of Camus’ response cited above. The shift in emphasis means that the conversation appears instead to be about Camus willing to risk losing friends over publishing L’Homme révolté, and avoids any of the passages in which he identifies himself with right-wing figures. For a comparison, Grenier, Carnets, 110–12, and Todd, Camus, une vie, 543–4."
