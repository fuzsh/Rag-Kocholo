        "meta_description": "Maurice Barrès is a geographical thinker: His texts are built around places and spaces, and they are structured by movements in space and by the changing of places. The names of cities, rivers and regions carry a semantic weight and are bestowed with an evocative power equalled only by certain toponyms in Proust. This geographical thinking is a constant in Barrès’s work, and it takes on many functions. In the present article, I examine the role of the East within his system of thought. The semantics and the valuations of this cardinal direction are fluctuating in Barrès’s texts: Barrès’s East often wears a menacing Pickelhaube or an alluring veil, defines and divides Europe, is, at the same time, a promise of joy and a menace of horror. First, I define Barrès’s particular concept of geography, blending locational and mental properties. I then analyse various manifestations of the East in his works: how the formative voyage is generally a voyage to the East; how the East can paradoxically be found in the West; how, because of its ‘Easternness’, Germany is excluded from Europe. In a last section, I examine Barrès’s last major work, Un Jardin sur l’Oronte (1922), set in the Middle East at he time of the crusades, and show how the view from the East seems to be subverting Barrès’s – and not only his – categories.",

        "text": "6These ambivalences come to light in a particularly telling way if one examines the role of the East in his geographical thinking. For the semantics and the valuations of this cardinal direction are fluctuating in Barrès’s writings: sometimes, the East is emphatically invoked and claimed, sometimes denigrated and rejected, sometimes concealed and suppressed. Barrès’s East often wears a menacing Pickelhaube or an alluring veil, defines and divides Europe, is, at the same time, a promise of joy and a menace of horror.\n\n7In the following, I will define Barrès’s particular concept of geography, blending locational and mental properties, before I analyse various manifestations of the East in his works: how the formative voyage is generally a voyage to the East; how the East is paradoxically to be found in the West, as a sort of counterweight to the devitalizing effects of civilization; how, because of its “Easternness”, Germany is excluded from Europe. In a last section, I will examine Barrès’s last major work, Un Jardin sur l’Oronte (1922), a story of passionate, culture-crossing love at the time of the Crusades, and show how the view from the East seems to be subverting Barrès’s – and not only his – categories.\n\n1 ‘Ideological’ Geography\n\n10 Ibid., p. 100-101.\n\nDans le pays où les miens ont duré, la vallée de la Moselle me paraît trop populeuse encore, trop recouverte de passants pour que j’entende bien ses leçons. J’aime à gravir les faibles pentes qui la dessinent, à parcourir indéfiniment, loin des centres d’habitation, le vieux plateau lorrain et, par exemple, le Xaintois, ancien pays historique où se dresse la montagne de Sion-Vaudémont. Venant de Charmes-sur-Moselle, quand j’atteins le haut de la côte sur Gripport, au carrefour où passe la voie romaine, soudain dans un coup de vent je reçois sur ma face tout le secret de la Lorraine. Au loin s’étendent devant moi les solitudes agricoles, et, dans un ciel froid, brusquement, émerge, isolée de toute part, la falaise que spiritualise le mince clocher de Sion. Quel enchantement sous mes yeux, quel air vivifiant me baigne, quelle vénération dans mon cœur ! Sainte colline nationale ! Elle est l’autel du bon conseil .\n\n13It is interesting to note that even fictional characters (like Hamlet) can cause such “ideological” wellsprings to emerge in a place :\n\n19 Barrès, L’Œuvre, vol. 2, p. 356. Italics are by Barrès himself.\n\nCertains lieux fameux dans l’histoire de la sensibilité humaine portent nos âmes au-delà de nos propres émotions et nous communiquent les fièvres qui les remplirent un jour. Telle la plage d’Elseneur, où l’obscur Hamlet lamentait la mort de son père et ses chagrins personnels ; telles les chambres trop étroites d’Auxonne, de Dole et de Seurres, où le jeune Bonaparte essayait en écritures déclamatoires son génie qui, si les trônes n’avaient pas été vacants, nous eût donné un Byron. Ce sont là des stations idéologiques aussi puissantes sur l’imagination que telles stations thermales sur des tempéraments déterminés .\n\n22 Ibid., p. 358-359. Vital Rambaud also points out that Spain functions as such a “station” for Delri (...)\n\nAu nord, les Espagnes sont sécheresses : fécondes, abondantes quand même, leur aridité étant faite de sensibilité contractée. Au midi, c’est un fleuve irrésistible de sensualités... Dans ce pays double, toute mollesse et puis rien que ressort, la lutte est éternelle des Castillans contre les Maures et contre l’enchantement d’Andalousie. Long effort, puissant contraste d’ou sortit le génie ascétique... Delrio en espérait beaucoup pour la Pia, jugeant cette opposition violente aussi efficace, comme excitant moral, qu’en thérapeutique les douches à jets alternés, brûlants et glacés. Je ferai son âme plus souple et plus forte, se disait-il .\n\n2 The Formative Voyage to the East\n\n26 Barrès, Romans et voyages, vol. 1, p. 155-156.\n\nJe suis venu à Venise pour m’accroître et pour me créer heureux. Voici cet instant arrivé. … Désormais convaincu que Venise a tiré de soi une vision de l’univers analogue et supérieure à celle que j’édifiais si péniblement, je prétends me guider sur le développement de Venise. Au lieu de replier ma sensibilité et de lamenter ce qui me déplaît en moi, j’ordonnerai avec les meilleurs beautés de Venise un rêve de vie heureuse pour le contempler et m’y conformer .\n\n21Beyond the realm of fiction, too, Barrès practices the formative voyage to the East, even if he conceals the direction, as in Du sang, de la volupté et de la mort. The book consists of four parts, uniting about 25 texts – novellas, travel impressions and essays –, retracing Barrès’s wanderings through Europe, chasing exquisite emotions, sensations and conceptions – the “idéologies passionnées” of the first part’s title. The second part stands for the West, being entitled “ En Espagne ”, the third for the South – “ En Italie ” –, while the final part is dedicated to things found “ Dans le Nord ”. The East is ominously absent from this picture.\n\n22Yet, at a second glance, it becomes evident that Barrès moves eastward almost with every one of the five texts of the northern section; they are all characterised by a strong sense of locality. Starting out west of Paris, in the Bois de Boulogne and Versailles, he moves to the French capital itself: Amitié pour les arbres sees Barrès at his Parisian writing desk, looking through the window at the tree in his neighbour’s garden, provoking a reflection on the value of these plants, that so often figure, concretely and metaphorically, in his works. Perhaps surprisingly, his thoughts are drawn to far-off countries: Armenia, Spain, Greece, Germany. While these flights of thought remain hypothetical voyages, they seem to set him going: With the next text, he moves to the Franco-German border region.\n\n3 The East in the West\n\n4 Asia Lies Beyond the Rhine\n\n5 The West in the East : Un Jardin sur l’Oronte\n\n35Yet, I will argue that, against this prima facie appearance, Barrès not only blurs the East-West opposition, so carefully delineated by Said, but actually subverts it. Moreover, Un Jardin sur l’Oronte is a reflection on the very process for which Said blames the West: that of projecting one’s conceptions and preconceptions on other cultures. But let me first summarize the storyline of the novel. Sire Guillaume, a young French knight fluent in Arabic, comes to Qalaat, in order to help negotiate a peace deal between a local emirate and a crusader principality. The young man becomes the confidante of the emir who grows fond of the strange young man, so fond, that he lets him see the women of his harem. Guillaume falls in love with Oriante, the emir’s favourite, when he hears her singing in the gardens. He fears that love and longs for it at the same time. She seems to reciprocate the attraction. Out of the blue, the emirate is attacked by other French crusaders. Oriante decides Guillaume to stay, and he helps defend the citadel. When the emir eventually dies, Oriante makes Guillaume the new leader, and for a while, they enjoy their love. But the fortress is doomed. Guillaume wants to flee together with his lover. He manages to escape, yet unbeknownst to him, she decides not to follow him. Guillaume passes months of fear and uncertainty about Oriante in Damascus; then he learns that she has become the wife of the new Christian master of Qalaat. Furious, he returns to the city. He manages to meet her, and they resume their love affair in secret, but after a while, that is not enough for him. Oriante helps him to return among the Christian knights. When during a soirée, Oriante sings again, Guillaume, consumed by passion, accuses her of treason and insults the knights. They beat him so brutally that he dies shortly afterwards.\n\n39So Guillaume falls for his own projections. Yet, Barrès makes things even more complicated, as I already indicated: Guillaume gets those projections of the East generally from Tristan that is ‘eastern’ in itself, setting off a jeux of mirrors without end: The East is mirrored in the West that itself is mirrored in the East that in turn...\n\n6 Conclusion : Changing Directions\n\n42Barrès’s East has many faces, many colours. It is linked to purity and hybridity: Spain is fascinating because it has incorporated the Eastern promises of emotionality. And the bastions of the East are great because they keep the East out. The East is dangerous disease and source of knowledge, as the feverish lagoon of Venice, Germany and Wagner exemplify, all three having ambivalent values. The East is far and near: it is never to be reached but in imagination, and the voyage en orient brings enlightenment within Europe. East is shorthand for emotion, and it is full of reason, even of calculation, as Spain and Oriante attest. Barrès’s East is less a fixed category than a moving concept strategically evoked, a semantic cloud that radiates different connotations at different times. The ironic intricacies of Un Jardin sur l’Oronte suggest that Barrès could be fully aware of his juggling with meanings."
