        "text": "The Rassemblement Démocratique Révolutionnaire [Revolutionary Democratic Rally] (RDR) was a political venture created in France in 1948 with the aim of defending a neutralist position, refusing the either-or alternatives between the Atlantic and Soviet blocs. This article begins with a sociographic presentation of the militant intellectuals who founded this original political initiative; then, we address the political activism and positionings of this distinctive partisan milieu, where intellectuals were characteristically overrepresented. We analyse the RDR’s methods of establishing a new position within the political and intellectual fields, as well as the way in which their forms of intervention and positionings were influenced by their members’ social profiles and trajectories as activists. Lastly, we question how the RDR’s members intervened within the domain of ideological production - both as a partisan venture and a collective intellectual - and to what extent the search for such a fragile equilibrium impacted its success or failure.\n\nThis article is one of the first sociological explorations of power struggles between intellectuals where matters of life and death are literally at stake. It counters the prevailing tendency within sociology to study intellectuals within confined academic institutions where power struggles are limited to matters of symbolic and institutional recognition. This study explores the conflict between collaborationist and Resistance intellectuals at the end of the Second World War in France, and it focuses in particular on the purge of collaborationist intellectuals which culminated in several high profile trials. This article shows that the arguments and meta-arguments put forward in these trials led to broader intellectual debates outside the courtroom. These debates not only centred on the notion of the writer’s responsibility, but also dealt with anxieties about the disintegrative forces of modern society. Whereas collaborationist intellectuals portrayed their writing as either separate from politics or rescuing a defunct or degenerate nation, Resistance intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre were keen to portray collaborators as outsiders, both socially and sexually, lacking in social integration and subservient to a strong external force. The Resistance intellectuals saw the notion of individual responsibility not as antithetical but as integral to the remaking of the French nation, and this concept would become the cornerstone of the reshaping of the intellectual landscape in the post-war era in France. Keywords: de Beauvoir, intellectuals, meta-arguments, power struggles, purge, Sartre, trials\n\nSarah Shurts is a historian of modern France and professor of history at Bergen College. She is interested in the construction of intellectual identity on the French extreme right during the periods of active intellectual involvement in public affairs known as “engagement.” She is the author of Resentment and the Right: French Intellectual Identity Reimagined, 1898–2000 (UDelaware Press, 2017). She spoke with Alexander Collin about her recent article “Identity, Immigration, and Islam: Neo-reactionary and New-Right Perceptions and Prescriptions” in The Journal of the History of Ideas (83.3).\n\nThis essay, published in New Matilda on December 2, 2015, discusses the ideological climate in France in the weeks following the terrorist attacks of November 13, focusing on intellectual and artistic elites' support for the French government's declaration of a new 'war on terror'. In the ideological rallying of the middle class behind the ‘national’ – or sometimes even ‘sacred’ – Republican union decreed by the Assemblée nationale, French social democracy has demonstrated its incapacity to offer any effective counterweight to a politics of bombs abroad and authoritarian crackdowns at home. Western imperialist violence in the Middle East, or the deepening of social fractures domestically, are both to be tolerated, since they can be presented as the consequence of ‘Republican’ ideals of human rights, equality, liberty, or culture."
