        "text": "On this Page 5\n\nFrancois Mauriac:\n\nYoungest Member of V*\n\nAcademie Francaise\n\nThe\n\nLiterary\n\nand\n\nCritical\n\nPage\n\nUT of the scorching soil of his\n\nB native Gironde, a land tortured\n\nwith thirst and whipped by angry,\n\nimplacable hail, have grown the\n\nnovels of Francois Mauriac—novels\n\nwhich have already enormously influenced\n\ncontemporary French literature\n\nand which are destined, I feel\n\nsure, to have a powerful effect upon\n\nEnglish writers of fiction. Already\n\ntwo of them (\"Therese,\" and \"Viper's\n\nTangle,\" which is selling extremely\n\nwell in Melbourne at the present\n\nmoment) have been translated into\n\nEnglish, and it seems reasonably\n\ncertain, especially after his recent\n\nelection to the Academie Francaise,\n\nthat Mauriac's other work will\n\nshortly be made accessible to English\n\nreaders. For that reason I intend\n\nto make an effort in this article, not\n\nso much to estimate and criticise his\n\nvarious novels as to give a general\n\nimpression of the sort of novels they\n\nare; to try to elucidate the continual\n\neffort at self-explication that is apparent\n\nin every single thing he writes;\n\nand to try, also, to make you see and\n\nunderstand the war that is being\n\nwaged within him between his religion\n\nand his art.\n\nA Racial Difference.\n\nThose who have not made a special\n\nstudy of French literature may find\n\nMauriac, at first, a difficult man\n\nto read. The French novel has\n\nnever in any way resembled the\n\nEnglish novel, and Mauriac is the\n\nmost indigenous, the least cosmopolitan\n\nof all French writers. To\n\nunderstand him it is necessary to\n\nrealise that in his country the novel\n\nconcerns itself with the drama of\n\nminds rather than with the clash\n\nand fusion of human personalities,\n\nand that, as a rule, its appeal is made\n\nsheerly to the Intellect. ... I am\n\nnot sure if I make myself clear.\n\nYou will say that the best English\n\nnovels do the same thing. '. . •\n\nNot exactly. Their appeal is not\n\nsolely to the intellect. I know of a\n\ngirl who must have gone to school at\n\nsome time, I suppose, though you\n\nwould never think it to hear her\n\nspeak, who works in the most menial\n\nposition in a woollen factory, and who\n\nreads with profound appreciation\n\nbooks as different as those of John\n\nGalsworthy, Mary Webb, Henry Handel\n\nRichardson, L. A. G. Strong,\n\nClemence Dane and Victoria Sackville\n\nWest. ... I don't think she would\n\nunderstand Francois Mauriac. And\n\nyet, a French girl, in similar circum-\n\nstances, just might. That is the\n\ndifference—it is racial and traditional.\n\nDeep down into the soil of La\n\nGironde Mauriac has plunged his\n\npeasant roots. He knows himself\n\nonly at Malagar, the family vineyard,\n\nthe very spot where, over a century\n\nago, his mother's shepherd ancestors\n\nhalted with their flocks. The same\n\nsun which ripens his grapes has\n\nbrought his books to maturity; his\n\nwine and his novels are equally children\n\nof that sultry earth. In his\n\nown case, at all events, there is wisdom\n\nin Mauriac's saying that a writer\n\nwho is cut off from the provinces\n\nis cut off from humanity. For, in\n\nhis own province he has a complete\n\nlittle universe, a universe that he\n\nknows and understands—and loves.\n\n\"Despite its nakedness,\" he says,\n\n\"I love the place, which is tantamount\n\nto saying that I love myself.\"\n\nJust so much does he think of himself\n\nas part of the land that bore\n\nhim!\n\nThe \"Family\" in France.\n\nIt is a primitive, almost savage\n\ncountry, dumb, harassed; by turn\n\nsuffocated, and drenched by brief\n\nstorms; a pitiless land where sun and\n\nfire devour the wounded pines, and\n\nwhere houses murmur with the humming\n\nof awakened flies. It is a land\n\npeopled with narrow, violent, gloriously\n\nvirile peasant stock: a province\n\nwhere everybody knows everybody\n\nelse, where the memory of a scandal\n\nendures until the fifth generation, and\n\nthe memory of an insult lives longer.\n\nIt is the stronghold of that sacred\n\nFrench institution: the Family! And\n\nthe slogan of the family is: to save\n\nappearances; not to betray oneself\n\nor one's clan; to guard a family\n\nsecret with one's life. There is no\n\nhappiness in Mauriac's world; but\n\nsince, in a way, it is a world of his\n\nown making, the reason might be\n\nsought within himself, and might be\n\nfound in that he lacks a sense of\n\nhumour.\n\nSuch was the land and such the\n\npeople to mould the little Mauriac.\n\nFrom childhood he accumulated material\n\nfor his books, learning to read\n\nthe signs of the sky and of the earth;\n\nknowing the thrill and peril of the\n\ngrape harvest; seeking to comprehend\n\nhis taciturn, inscrutable neighbours.\n\nAt the same time, Mauriac must\n\nnot be taken simply for a regional\n\nnovelist. We know that type well\n\nin English: gifted men and women\n\nwho paint faithfully and minutely\n\ntheir own particular little corners of\n\nthe earth. Francois Mauriac is not\n\nconcerned with showing you his< province,\n\npointing out its curiosities, its\n\nbeauties. Bather, in his books does\n\nthe land become a part of the consciousness\n\nof the people he creates.\n\nIt is never described. As his stories\n\nunfold the forces of nature take shape\n\nas frightening presences, menaces,\n\npresages of evil. The storm over\n\nArgeloux is no less essential to the\n\ndrama of Therese Desqueyroux than,\n\nin order that we may know that\n\nwoman of fire, is her eternal cigarette.\n\nOne may say of all Mauriac's\n\nbooks that a story of the Gironde is\n\nwoven into every human drama. . . .\n\nBut, for all that, his chief end is\n\nless to portray the land and people\n\nof Guyenne than to explore his soul\n\nand to paint the tragic \"landes\" of\n\nhis own heart.\n\nDisciple of Proust?\n\nNever before in the history of\n\nliterature, probably, has there been\n\nso much chatter about schools and\n\ntendencies as there is to-day. It is\n\nall part, no doubt, of our modern\n\npassion for analysis and the cardindexing\n\nof writers' minds and style.\n\nThat being so, it has been natural,\n\nI suppose, for critics to vivisect\n\nMauriac and put him down as a follower\n\nof Proust. It is a conclusion\n\nto which I am unable to subscribe.\n\nI believe that Mauriac's novels—or\n\nthe seeds of his novels—were in the\n\nlittle boy who went to school to the\n\nMarist Fathers at Bordeaux, and spent\n\nhis holidays at Malagar. I think\n\nthey grew to power and strength as\n\nhe grew, and, when the time was\n\nripe, burst out of him like a river\n\nin torrent—a force that ho man\n\ncould stay. . . . The very first thing\n\none notices about him is his independence,\n\nhis determination to be\n\nfree.\n\nThat Proust Influenced him, as he\n\nhas influenced most living miters,\n\nthere can be little doubt. But\n\nMauriac a conscious disciple of anybody's!\n\nThat I shall never believe.\n\nVerse is the natural outlet for\n\nyoung men who feel the seed of literary\n\ntalent stir to life within them,\n\nand Francois Mauriac has given us\n\nin Yves (\"Le Mystere Frontenac\") a\n\npicture of a young poet which might\n\nwell be autobiographical. His own\n\nfirst poems, like those of the youthful\n\nYves, brought him swift recognition,\n\nand won him the esteem and\n\nfriendship of Paul Bourget and\n\nMaurice.Barres. Already in these early\n\npoems we are aware of the struggle\n\nbetween his religious responsibilities\n\nand the consciousness of his duty as\n\nan artist—which are perpetually at\n\nwar within himself, as they are in\n\neverything he writes. Only in his\n\ntwo latest books does he begin to see\n\nthat the two are not only reconcilable,\n\nbut actually complementary.\n\nHe has said recently that in his boyhood\n\nhe was surrounded by religious\n\ninfluences and precepts, and given\n\nno solid dogmatic instruction, so that\n\nhis Catholic sensibilities were developed\n\nat the expense of his Catholic\n\nintellect. It has taken a great many\n\nyears, and it has taken grievous\n\nsuffering, to establish the equilibrium\n\nwhich, as his latest books bear witness,\n\nhe has at last achieved.\n\nBefore War—and After.\n\nIn 1913 Mauriac published his first\n\nnovel, \"L'Enfant en chaines.\" In it\n\nhe douses with irony the artistic impulses\n\nto which youngsters love to\n\nsuccumb, and the phases of moral\n\nreform which the ardent supporters\n\nof Marc Saignier (Catholic democrat\n\nand pacifist) considered the absolute\n\npinnacle of their age. It is a\n\nstimulating \"religious\" notfel. Not,\n\nof course, an edifying treatise or\n\nplea for some moral principle, but\n\nrather a measure of truth regarding\n\nan average spiritual life in a given\n\nera. ... It was followed in 1914 by\n\n\"La robe pretexte.\"\n\nThough he never refers to it, the\n\nmost casual observer can see that the\n\nwar was the turning point in Mauriac's\n\ncareer. Those two early novels,\n\nsensitive studies, exquisitely written,\n\nhold no promise of the terrific things\n\nthat were to come. . . . Convalescent\n\nafter the war, he wrote \"La chair et\n\nle sang,\" a book which no other age\n\nsave ours could have produced, and\n\none which posterity will find it hard\n\nto understand. With the other\n\nyoung writers of France he faced a\n\nstate of things which, possibly, no\n\n(Continued on page 27.)\n\nMauriac's home, Malagar, which readers of his books will quickly recognise. o the left of the vineyards is the famous pine forest, which extends for many miles. Help\n\nMauriac's home, Malagar, which readers of his books will quickly recognise.\n\no the left of the vineyards is the famous pine forest, which extends for\n\nmany miles.\n\nnone Help\n\nFrancois\n\nMauriac\n\n(Continued from page 3.)\n\ngeneration had faced before: the\n\nspectacle of a nation's youth; vicarious\n\nand disillusioned; crazy with\n\ndespair in the midst of their triumph.\n\nThe banners of France came glorious\n\nout of the war, but the boys who\n\ncarried them were vicious and cruel,\n\n«nd rick with bitterness and grief.\n\nMauriac, a little older than the\n\nothers, more intelligent, more mature,\n\nsaw more deeply than they saw and\n\nfelt more keenly. ... \"La chair et\n\nle sang\" was followed in swift succession\n\nbv \"Preseances,\" \"Le Baiser au\n\nLepreux.\" and \"Genitrix.\" With the\n\ntwo lost Mauriac stepped for good\n\nand all out of his youthful chrysalis.\n\nWith them his genius was declared;\n\nand each subsequent novel marked a\n\nnew stage along a ghastly Journey\n\nof frightenlngly unhappy books. Towards\n\nthe end of \"Vipers Tangle,\" an\n\natrocious and magnificent book, a\n\nglimmering of light is visible, and\n\nwith \"Le Mystere Frontenac\" he\n\nemerges into daylight at last.\n\nSparing nothing, inventing nothing,\n\nexaggerating nothing, he set\n\nabout infusing life into that gallery\n\nof villains which, beginning with \"Le\n\nbaiser au lepreux,\" he has drawn\n\nwith such astringent realism. Whether\n\nhe likes it or not, it is by his j\n\nvillains Mauriac will be remembered, i\n\nand It is by his villains that he mustj\n\nbe judged. They are not a pretty;\n\ncrew: Therese Desqueyroux, who poi- :\n\nsoned her husband; the woman in;\n\n\"Genitrix\"—a book with the same\n\ntheme as D. H. Lawrence's \"Sons and ;\n\nLovers—who let her daughter-inlaw\n\ndie; that young animal, Daniel, j\n\nin \"La fleuve du feu\"; Pierre, thej\n\nPharisaic and scrupulous Catholic\n\nof \"Destins,\" and the old miser in j\n\n\"Viper's Tangle.\" \\\n\nA Rapier Mind.\n\nj\n\nFrancois Mauriac is blessed—or;\n\ncursed—with a penetration, a critical!\n\nswiftness which gives to his delinea-;\n\ntion of characters sort of ferocity;!\n\nand that, together with his alarming j\n\nlucidity, has made him the enfant;\n\nterrible of French letters, and one;\n\nof the most widely admired writers;\n\nIn the world to-day. ... His pessi-;\n\nmism and his preoccupation with the i\n\ndark side of things make one wonder;\n\nIf he believes in the celebrated;\n\naphorism that out of beautiful senti- ;\n\nments bad literature jfc made. He ;\n\nconfessed recently that he used toj\n\nthink that by \"purifying the source,\" ;\n\nor by striving to make himself as!\n\nperfect as possible, he could cure his;\n\nbooks of the evil that was in them; a;\n\ngood tree, he said, cannot bring!\n\nforth evil fruit. But, by degrees, hej\n\ncame to realise that even in the state:\n\nof grace his characters still had their;\n\nroots in, and drew their life from,|\n\nall that was least pure in his inner;\n\nconsciousness. And, he ruefully;\n\nadmits, he is never very successful!\n\nwith his virtuous characters. Con-;\n\nsciously or unconsciously, Mauriac, In'\n\nhis efforts to \"purify the source,\"!\n\nappears to have adopted the Freudian ;\n\ntheory that to cure oneself of the\n\nobsessions that torment one It is\n\nnecessary only to bring them to the\n\nlight, necessary only to talk about\n\nthem that they may disappear.\n\nWithout ranging myself alongside\n\nthe Freudians, I would like to suggest\n\nthat art may be one such means of\n\nliberation. Every artist dreams; lives\n\nvarious lives. It is his way of eliminating\n\nthe poison that is fn him, and\n\nof ridding himself of his monsters.\n\nThus Mauriac, in his books, exorcises\n\nhis devils, and thus—if the\n\ntheory is correct—his true confession\n\nwill be found not in any memoirs\n\nhe may chance to write, but in the\n\ncharacters he has created.\n\nFrancois Mauriac: Catholic.\n\nThere are critics who have always\n\nhailed Mauriac as a Catholic novelist.\n\nThere are others who put the\n\ndate of what they are pleased to\n\ncall his conversion after the publication\n\nof \"Destins,\" \"the only story in\n\nwhich there is a definitely anti-\n\nCatholic bias.\" I am Inclined to\n\nthrow in my lot somewhere between\n\nthe two. I can see no trace of a\n\nconversion, but neither would I call\n\nthe early Mauriac a Catholic novelist,\n\nthough all his books beiar witness\n\nthat he was a novelist who also happened\n\nto be a Catholic. As for \"Destins,\"\n\nI don't know that I should\n\nbrand it anti-Catholic. It is a book in\n\nwhich the normalities of a certain\n\nkind of Catholic life are laid bare to\n\nthe scalpel, etched with a red-hot\n\nneedle. His ruthless picture of Pierre,\n\nthe devout Catholic, at once Pharisaical\n\nand scrupulous, is one of the most\n\nrelentless and virulent things he has\n\ndone. But we all know that such\n\nCatholics exist, and holding them up\n\nto public ignominy can hardly be\n\ncalled anti-Catholic. He is filled\n\nwith horror and bitterness at the\n\natrocious ill-will of so-called Christians.\n\nAnd surely Catholics, above\n\nall others, should loathe and\n\nshun such vipers. No: Mauriac\n\nmay be accused of concerning himself\n\ntoo much with vice—never with\n\nmaking it palatable. He may be reproached\n\nwith his taste for evil characters,\n\nbut there is nothing in him\n\nmore Christian than his love for the !\n\nstraying sheep and the daughters of ;\n\nperdition. In his eyes the foulest!\n\nhuman creature is not the sinner,:\n\nbut the hypocrite—the Pharisees like 1\n\nPierre.\n\ni\n\nMaturity, Not Conversion.\n\nWhat I see in Mauriap, after\n\n\"Destins,\" is not conversion but maturity.\n\nThe books that come afterwards\n\nare full of the certainty that\n\nlife is a spiritual thing, almost supernatural,\n\na mystery. The things we\n\nthink we love are only shadows; the\n\nphantoms we cannot hold hide the\n\ntrue light, which, until death makes\n\nlife whole, always escapes us. This\n\ndevelopment, this fieche of idealism\n\nwhich reaches its pinnacle in\n\n\"Viper's Tangle\" has its germ in the\n\nlittle poems of his boyhood. . . .\n\nThis is no conversion. It lis a new\n\nfidelity to, a richer understanding of,\n\n'the doctrine that troubled his youth\n\nand turned his young manhood into\n\nan arena where Francois Mauriac\n\ncame to grips in bloody combat with\n\n—Francois Mauriac.\n\nThis new security, this mature and\n\njoyous. acceptance of his faith, has\n\ninduced in him a new frame of mind.\n\n. . . Having come to the end of his\n\ntunnel, as it were, with \"Le Nceud\n\nde Viperes,\" it was his intention to\n\ncall his latest book \"Le nld de\n\nColombes,\" but he changed the title\n\n(fortunately, I think) to \"Le Mystere\n\nFrontenac.\" Having rebelled so\n\nroundly and so soundly against his\n\nprovincial famines, their esprit de\n\ncorps, their narrowness, their absurdities,\n\ntheir prejudices, their .tyranny,\n\nhe has repented now of having a\n\nlittle calumniated them, and in this\n\nlatest book he goes to the other extreme,\n\nin unity, devotion, and unselfishness.\n\nModern and Original.\n\nI have dealt here only with\n\nMauriac the novelist. I must leave\n\nto somebody else the interpretation\n\nof the other Mauriacs: poet, philosopher,\n\nbiographer, polemicist, historian.\n\nHis peculiar gifts have made\n\nhim a master in all those spheres, but\n\nit is, I think, as a writer of fiction\n\nhe will live. Those fiery novels of\n\nhis, with their strange construction,\n\ntheir particular involuntary rhythm,\n\ntheir mettlesome unpreparedness and\n\ntheir lack of detail, are utterly unlike\n\nany other novels in the world.\n\nWritten always at full speed, full of\n\nself-abandon, of blunt apostrophe, of\n\nimpatience, and of muffled lyricisme,\n\nthey are as native to this twentieth\n\ncentury as they are to the province\n\nwhence they draw their being. They\n\nare novels which our literature should\n\nwelcome in translation. One of\n\nthem at least, \"Viper's Tangle,\" is a\n\ngreat novel, and, what is more, a\n\ngreat Catholic novel. The thing to\n\nadmire in Mauriac now is that he\n\nhas had the courage in that book,\n\nand in \"SoufErance du Chretien,\" to\n\nexact from his heroes not the facile\n\ndevotion which, alack and alas, has\n\ncome to characterise Catholic novels,\n\nbut- sound, manly conviction, and\n\nabsolute sincerity towards themselves.\n\n\"Non pas la vertu, Isa,\" he\n\nwrites in \"Le Noeud de Viperes,\"\n\n\"mais la saintete,\" and in \"Ce qui\n\netait perdu\" we find: \"Tu as recu la\n\nplus grande de toutes les graces; tu\n\nte vols, tu te connais.\"\n\nMauriac's Sincerity.\n\n\"I am tormented by the thought,\"\n\nMauriac writes, \"of my responsibility\n\nas a Catholic writer. That label,\n\nwhich I accept, means that numerous\n\nyoung people confidently read my\n\nbooks and are ready to follow me.\n\n•And if the least misunderstanding\n\nshould arise, I run the risk of leading\n\nthem!astray, who knows! even of corrupting\n\nthem. ... I think of it insistently,\n\nand this anxiety is for me\n\na daily obsession. The conflict between\n\nGod and the flesh, the question\n\nof sin—no. for me these things\n\nare not humbug. They are, on the\n\ncontrary, a profound reality from\n\nthe which I know not how to make\n\nmy escape.\" •\n\nThere is no doubting Mauriac's\n\nsincerity, but now and again in his\n\nbooks it , seems (to the lay mind at\n\nall events) that the theology of\n\nnovelists is not above suspicion."
