He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Glovers in 1794.[2] He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for London from 1793 to 1806. Between 1797 and 1798, Anderson was Lord Mayor of London. On 14 May 1798, he was made a baronet, of Mill Hill, Hendon, in the County of Middlesex.[3]\n\nIn 1762, he married Dorothy Simkins, daughter of Charles Simkins. Their marriage was childless. Anderson died in May 1813 and the baronetcy became extinct."
