        "text": "John Anderson, best known for his role as referee on the TV series Gladiators, has died aged 92.\n\nThe Scottish sports coach appeared in the game show's original ITV run, which aired from 1992 to 2000, and its short-lived 2008 revamp on Sky.\n\nHe lent his voice to the famous catch-phrase: \"Contender, ready! Gladiator, ready!\"\n\nHe also coached more than 100 Olympic athletes, including former 5,000m world-record holder David Moorcroft.\n\n\"I can't speak highly enough of John,\" said Mr Moorcroft. Speaking to Athletics Weekly, he added that the Glaswegian coach had \"just got the best out of people\".\n\n\"I’m certain that I would never have been a decent athlete if it wasn’t for John,\" he said.\n\nA statement from the show, quoted by the Press Association, said: \"We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of our beloved referee, John Anderson, at the age of 92.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to his friends and family. John will forever be remembered as the iconic voice that brought us 'Gladiators Ready! Contenders Ready!'.\"\n\nFormer professional football referee Mark Clattenburg, who took over as referee for the current BBC incarnation of Gladiators earlier this year, said Mr Anderson had had \"one of the most iconic voices\".\n\nIn a social media post, he said: \"I had the most difficult task to follow him in the new series of Gladiators and watching him keep the Gladiators within the rules will always be with me.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC when he first took on his Gladiators role, Mr Clattenburg said: \"When I watched the show back in the '90s everyone knew who the referee was - John Anderson.\n\n\"To get the call to say I was going to be the new referee on Gladiators was such an amazing thing and probably one of the best things I've ever done in my life.\"\n\nMr Anderson also served as the head coach for the Amateur Athletics Association of England and Scottish national coach.\n\nHe trained dozens of Olympians, including Sheila Carey, Liz McColgan and Judy Simpson, who appeared on Gladiators as Nightshade in the 1990s.\n\nHe was inducted into the Coaching Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nOlympic sprinter Jennifer Stoute, known as Rebel on Gladiators, wrote on social media: \"He was the best. He knew how to make us laugh and get mad too. Best memories.\""
