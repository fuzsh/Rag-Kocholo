Passporters: tours are eligible for a Just-for-Fun garden stamp.\n\nPlay hooky in this 1930s school-turned-playground\n\nWe revitalized Bothell’s first junior high with pure fun in mind – dining, movies, live music, swimming, games, shopping, tastings and all-around enjoyment for visitors of all ages.\n\nNo hall pass is needed to explore the five acres of gardens, bars and nooks: Sip a handcrafted beverage in the hallway, order drinks in the Principal’s Office, play pinball in the Woodshop, skip PE and float in the pool instead, and forgo the lunch line for casual, sophisticated dining at Tavern on the Square. Your only homework here? Explore, imbibe and enjoy!\n\nBuilt in 1931 in the art deco style and later named for the school's first Principal, Wilbert A. \"Andy\" Anderson, the property is 20 miles north of Seattle, minutes from the Sammamish River Trail and adjacent to Pop Keeney Stadium.\n\nA courtyard billowing with plants and trees is the heart of it all, the place to sit fireside with a beer brewed just steps away. Thoughout the property, unique artwork prevails, showcasing the history of the area and the fascinating people who were an integral part of it. Local artists crafted their interpretations based on historical photos and interviews from alumni, families and colorful residents.\n\nWelcome to Anderson School; let the exploration begin!\n\nAnderson School allows pets on the side patios and in hotel rooms for a fee.\n\nCheck-in is at 3 pm; checkout is at 11 am\n\nThe room names and original artwork are inspired by people and events that were significant to the Bothell community.

Here, remarkable teachers have inspired students to become, among other things, the first female U.S. Senator from the State of Washington, a NFL football player, a pioneering physicist to do groundbreaking studies of late stellar evolution and cosmology and the first American woman to sail solo around the world! These folks were adventuerous explorers in their respective fields. Now, we encourage you to do your own explorations on property. There’s a mix of wondrous spaces, beautiful gardens and creative structures. Go forth light of heart and beer in hand because the joy of discovery is afoot.
