        "text": "The first time I heard the BAND GEEKS I truly freaked out – they sound just like the classic YES of the seventies, the YES that I know and love… AND THAT’S WHAT I’M WANTING TO BRING TO YOU ON THIS TOUR….YES MUSIC IS FOREVER!!!!!!” – Jon Anderson\n\nJon Anderson is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable voices in music as the lead vocalist and creative force behind YES. Anderson was the author and a major creative influence behind the ground-breaking album “Fragile” as well as the series of epic, complex pieces such as “Awaken,” “Gates of Delirium” and especially “Close to the Edge” which were central to the band’s success. Additionally, Anderson co-authored the group’s biggest hits, including “I’ve Seen All Good People,” “Roundabout” and “Owner Of A Lonely Heart.” After 50 years of success in the music business, Jon has worked with many variations of YES, as well as collaborations with Vangelis, Kitaro, Roine Stolt and Jean-Luc Ponty. He has released several critically acclaimed solo albums including “Olias of Sunhillow,” “Song of Seven,” “Animation,” “Three Ships,” “Toltec” and “Survival and Other Stories” and most recently “1000 Hands” to name just a few.\n\nThe Band Geeks began as the house band for the Band Geek podcast, an internet show created by Richie Castellano (Blue Öyster Cult). The band gained popularity on YouTube with their incredibly detailed recreations of music by artists like Queen, Toto, Black Sabbath and Yes, which have earned the Band Geeks over 30 million views.\n\nThe Band Geeks:\n\nRichie Castellano – Bass, Guitar\n\nChris Clark – Keyboards\n\nAndy Ascolese – Drums\n\nRobert Kipp – Keyboards, Guitar\n\nAndy Graziano – Guitar, Bass\n\nLegendary YES vocalist/songwriter JON ANDERSON touring with The Band Geeks performing classic YES tracks including “And You and I,” “Starship Trooper,” “Heart of the Sunrise” and epic works like “Close To The Edge,”\n\n“The Gates of Delirium,” “Awaken” and others!\n\nJon Anderson has recorded a brand-new album, TRUE, which will be released through his new record label, Frontiers Records, on August 23. The former Yes singer has recorded the new album with The Band Geeks, with whom he has been touring America for the past two years.\n\nThe album was co-produced, engineered, and mixed by Band Geek bassist and musical director Richie Castellano"
