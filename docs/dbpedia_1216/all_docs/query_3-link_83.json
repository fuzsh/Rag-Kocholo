        "text": "“I want to thank the State Supreme Court for recognizing that drop boxes are a safe and secure method of voting in Wisconsin,” said Mayor Rhodes-Conway at an Aug. 6 press conference. “We want to make sure that every eligible voter who wants to vote in the August primary and the November general election is able to do so.”\n\nJoining the Mayor at the press conference were Deputy Clerk Jim Verbick, Lisa Hassenstab and Anna Anderson from Disability Rights Wisconsin, and Sam Liebert from All Voting is Local.\n\n\"Today, marks an important milestone, not just for Wisconsin, but for the City of Madison. The return of drop boxes is a significant step forward in our ongoing efforts to ensure that every citizen has a secure and accessible way to participate in our democracy,\" said Liebert. \"Wisconsin's 1,800 election clerks serve communities both large and small. They understand the unique needs of voters and they know that drop boxes are an invaluable tool in making voting more accessible, especially in our rural areas, where distances and limited hours can pose significant challenges.\"\n\nAnderson said the return of drop boxes is especially important for people with disabilities.\n\n\"For some voters with disabilities, voting absentee is their only option to cast a ballot,\" said Anderson. \"Drop boxes help voters with disabilities have an equal opportunity to return their ballot in a safe and secure way.\"\n\nAbsentee ballot drop boxes were critical for many residents to safely vote during the pandemic. Today, Madison reinstated this commonsense option to provide more accessibility to the ballot."
