        "text": "Merchant in Glasgow: Tacksmen of H.M. Customs and Foreign Excise, Sometime Dean of Guild of Glasgow, Sometime Provost of Glasgow\n\nHis Ancestry\n\nJohn Andrerson of Dowhill, younger, is the son of John Anderson of Dowhill, elder, and his wife Barbara Gilhagie. He was born before 2 October 1636, the date upon which his baptism was registered at High Church parish in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland. [National Records of Scotland, Glasgow Baptisms, 1631-43, reference OPR.644/1/3]\n\nA monument formerly located in the Cathedral churchyard identifies John Anderson as: \"John Anderson of Douhill, present provost of Glasgow, the son of John Anderson, who was also provost of Glasgow, and the grandson of Ninian Anderson.\" The Regality Club. Second Series. Part First (James MacLehose & Sons, Glasgow, 1889), p.110\n\nConcerning Ownership of the Stobcross Estate\n\nRobert Reid (alias Senex), the Glasgow historian, was under the impression that Stobcross was: \"formerly the property of the Andersons of Dowhill\" but he was mistaken. However, his error, if it was not entirely responsible for creating the modern misconception that ownership of the Stobcross and Dowhill estates was vested in the same family, probably contributed greatly to it. The Andersons of Stobcross may have been related to the Andersons of Dowhill but evidence which might prove this is presently wanting. Old Glasgow and its Environs\n\nConcerning Ownership of the Dowhill Estate\n\nWhen John Anderson of Dowhill, younger, died on 30 September 1710 the Dowhill estate passed to his daughters Marion and Barbara. Most of his property was acquired by his daughter Marion and it eventually passed to Marion's son, Doctor John Moore, who subsequently sold it. A Life in Medicine Thereafter the Dowhill estate was held for a time by John Robertson, manufacturer in Glasgow, who was forced to sell it by his creditors. Robert Reid reproduced a notice of the sale, published in the Glasgow Mercury on 19 October 1780, which serves to confirm the location of this small estate. Senex gives a full list of the individual properties which made up this estate in his history. The notice of sale follows:\n\n\"To be sold, by auction, on Friday the 27th of October next, etc., the following subjects, lying on the east side of the Dowhill Street, near to the Saracen's Head Inn, which belonged sometime to the deceased John Robertson, manufacturer in Glasgow, and now to his creditors.\" Old Glasgow and its Environs, Historical and Topographical by Sexex (David Robertson, Glasgow, MDCCCLXIV), p. 218\n\nBurgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow\n\nJohn Anderson of Dowhill, younger, was enrolled as a burgess and guild brother of Glasgow on 7 October 1658. In his burgess record he is identified as \"John Anderson, youngest, merchant\" in order to distinguish him from his father \"John Anderson, younger, merchant, late provost of the burgh.\" Glasgow Burgesses, 1573-1750, page 157 It is supposed that there was another much older man named John Anderson who was active in the town at this period. It cannot be regarded as being certain but it is possible that the older man alluded to is \"Johne Andersoune lait proveist of Glasgow\" who died in October 1664. [National Records of Scotland, Commissary Records of Glasgow, Testament Dative of Johne Andersoune, lair proveist of Glasgow, reference CC9/7/36 pp. 442-43]\n\nElection of Councillors for 1669-70\n\nJohn Anderson of Dowhill, younger, was sent for on 8 October 1669, in order to make up the required quorum Glasgow Records, 1663-1690, pp. 123-24\n\nThe Andersons of Dowhill refuse to serve on the Town Council of Glasgow\n\nJohn Anderson of Dowhill, elder, and his son John Anderson of Dowhill, younger, were nominated to serve on the town council of Glasgow for the year 1674-75 but refused. The council convened on 6 October 1674 in order to elect magistrates and ordered: \"twa persones to be sent for in place of John Andersone, elder and younger of Dowhill, who had bein choysen to be ordinarie counsellouris but had never acceptit the place.\" Glasgow Records. 1663-1690, p. 186\n\nJohn Anderson of Dowhill, younger, Complains to the Council\n\nOn 14 October 1674 the town council of Glasgow considered a complaint made by John Anderson, younger of Dowhill, late dean of guild.

His place of death is not certainly known but he probably died in Glasgow. A View of the Merchants House of Glasgow, p. 576 When John Anderson of Dowhill, younger, died his estate passed to his daughters Marion and Barbara. In 1737 Marion Anderson, the widow of Reverend Charles Moore, lived at \"Dowhill's Land\" a property which was located on the west side of the Saltmarket and it is possible that her father died there.
