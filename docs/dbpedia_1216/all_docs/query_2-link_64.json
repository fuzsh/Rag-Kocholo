        "text": "Gladiators referee John Anderson has died aged 92, the TV show said. The Scottish sports coach was best known for his role as the umpire in the original ITV show, between 1992 and 2000, and the revamped short-lived Sky series.\n\nFamed for the catchphrase: \"Contender, ready! Gladiator, ready!\" While John was a well-loved part of the popular series, he also trained more than 100 Olympians.\n\nThe coach worked with athletes such as heptathlete Judy Simpson, Olympic middle-distance finalist Sheila Carey and he helped Liz McColgan win an Olympic 10,000m silver medal in 1988. The coach also worked with endurance runners John Graham and Lynne MacDougall.\n\nHe was inducted into the Coaching Hall of Fame in 2002. On Instagram, the official account for Gladiators shared a statement.\n\nIt read: \"We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of our beloved referee, John Anderson, at the age of 92. Our hearts go out to his friends and family.\n\n\"John will forever be remembered as the iconic voice that brought us 'Gladiators Ready! Contenders Ready!'.\" He would follow the introduction with a countdown, saying: \"Three, two, one.\"\n\nThe show followed four contestants, split into pairs by gender, compete in a series of physically challenging events against the \"resident\" Gladiators, before competing against their respective contestant in one final event.\n\nThe show was so popular that it expanded into both a kids version of the series, as well as live events.\n\nRebooted this year on BBC, current referee Mark Clattenburg, said: \"One of the most iconic voices and will always be remembered.\n\n\"I had the most difficult task to follow him in the new series of Gladiators and watching him keep the Gladiators within the rules will always be with me!! Rest in peace legend!!\"\n\nAnderson was also the head coach for the Amateur Athletics Association of England and Scottish national coach. He worked with Staffordshire-born racewalker Lisa Kehler, Scottish Olympic runner Liz McColgan and hurdler William Sharman.\n\nOlympic sprinter Jennifer Stoute, who was known as Rebel on Gladiators, wrote: \"He was the best. He knew how to make us laugh and get mad toooo. Best memories.\"\n\nOlympian Shirley Webb, who was known as Battleaxe penned: \"Gladiators, you will go on my second whistle, 3… 2… 1… Still gives me butterflies. This man was a huge influence on me, the nation's most loved referee. Celebrating John Anderson. Legend.\"\n\nMany fans took to social media to share their thoughts on the tragic news. @BarrowRob wrote: \"RIP John Anderson, one of my all time heroes from my childhood days and an absolute legend of a referee.\" @sloan_phil added: \"Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my former sprint coach, John Anderson. Aside from his Gladiators role he was also a fantastically knowledgeable athletics coach, a larger than life, inspirational character and a wonderful human being. RIP John.\"\n\n@dunartist wrote: \"some things, seeming slight are often not. there is a sound from my little days that I remember so clearly, so happily. John Anderson yelling \"Gladiators Ready!!\" on my television. I was sad to learn this morning that he has passed away. memories are such precious things.\""
