Research Notes

NOTE: There were at least two different Anderson families, but the most prominent in Monmouth County was Captain John Anderson, who was the captain of the "Unicorn" and married Anna Reid.[12] Sources must be considered carefully before adding them to the profile.

Please see: Donald C Lockhart, "The Scottish Origin of Colonel John Anderson", The American Genealogist, 83:1 (2008). He shows that Col. John Anderson was the son of James Anderson of Fortrose, Scotland. (It previously said that John Anderson & Susannah Hamilton were the parents).

CAUTION: PLEASE DO NOT MERGE WITH OTHER PERSONS NAMED JOHN ANDERSON. Multiple families were recently wiped out and people deleted with no thought about whether they were the same people from the same locality or had the same wife and children. THIS MAN WAS A GOVERNOR IN NEW JERSEY. The history that follows does not match what is in Wikipedia, although that is not well sourced. These parents attached may not be correct. Another contributor wrote: Found on Find a Grave site: COLONEL JOHN ANDERSON was born in Scotland. He was the son of John Anderson of Dowhill, Glasgow, Scotland. John Anderson was the Lord Provost of Glasgow. He Belonged to the Episcopal Church of Scotland. His place of residence was Dowhill, Stobcross Manor, Glasgow, Scotland. Colonel John Anderson, Jr. captained one of the ships that rescued the survivors of the "Darian Debale." The Darian Debacle was Scotland's attempt to colonize Central America in 1698. Several hunderd Scottish investors pooled several hundred thousand British Pounds together in order to colonize New Calendonia (Darian) including one John Anderson, a possible relative, who invested 1000 pounds. The "Darian Colonists" built Fort Saint Andrew on an isthmus located in a bay in what is today Panama. The fort was located on an isthmus across from Golden Island. The isthmus was made into an island by digging a short waterway through a narrow section of land which connected the peninsula to the mainland. A stone marker was dicovered a few years ago on the spot where the settlement was established. It has been argued by historians that the failure of the Darian Expedition led to a major disruption in the Scottish economy due to the widespread speculation and enormous amount invested by so many Scottish citizens. This factor, they argue, led to The Bitish Act of Union in 1707 whereby Scotland relinquished its independence and joined in union with Great Britain. The Darian settlement was a complete failure. Hundereds died within a few months from yellow fever. The leaders of the expedition determined that the remining survivors would be transported back to Scotland. Col. Anderson captained one of the rescue ships called the Unicorn. On the trip back the ship made its way to the island of Jamaica for repairs and supplies. From there it encounterd a storm and it limped its way into the harbor at Perth Amboy, NJ. After the ship landed and the surviors were put ashore, the ship was stripped down and eventually sank in the Perth Amboy, New Jersey harbor, at the foot of Fayette Street. Colonel Anderson remained in New Jersey eventually settling in the Matawan area of Monmouth County. Colonel Anderson married Anna (Miller) Reid on December 7, 1701 at Tintern Manor in Shrewsbury, Monmouth County, NJ. The day after his wedding John Reid granted Col. Anderson, his son-in-law, land in Manalapan, Monmouth County, NJ. Tintern was the plantation of Gov. Lewis Morris; Find-A-Grave mm.#60755645. Anna Reid was born on January 24, 1679 in Lawers, Perthshire, Scotland. Anna (Reid) Anderson was the dauhter of John Reid; Find-A-Grave mem.#9178791 and Margaret (Miller) Reid; Find-A_Grave mem.#9338914. John Reid, her father, was the first Surveyor General of East Jersey. He was a third generation gardener and wrote the first book on gardening in Scotland, "The Scot's Gard'ner," before he emigrated to America with his wife Margaret Miller and thier young childern aboard the ship "Exchange" captained by James Peacock on December 19, 1683. They were married on November 29, 1678 in Tillock, Scotland. John Reid resided at Perth Amboy, NJ and encouraged the early Quaker migration to Monmouth County, NJ near the Indian settlement of Topanemus. He moved to that area in his later years. Anna (Reid) Anderson died in Manalapan, NJ on July 6, 1723. She is buried with her husband, parents and several of their children and their descendants in the Topanemus Cemetery. The flat ground level rectangular burial slabs of Col. John and Anna (Reid) Anderson were removed in the 1940's by Claude Anderson, a descendant. Claude Anderson carried the stone burial monuments to his home in Riverton, NJ. Claude Anderson nicknamed his residence "Rive Gauche." Colonel John Anderson's monument reads as follows: Under here lyes the body of Col. John Anderson Once President of His Majesty's Council for the Province of New Jersey (he held that position for 18 days) Who departed this life March the 28th Anno Domini 1736 aged 71 years. His country's true friend, obliging to neighbors, gave no man offense, paid each for their labor, was easie at home or abroad where appeared gave each man his due and no man did fear the same in all stations from flattery free.

Although Col. Anderson served only eighteen days as New Jersey's chief executive, he served on the Council of New Jersey from 1713-1736 missing just four years of service. In 1713, when he was first place on the council, an effort was made to discredit him in order to block his admission. He was charged with being a Presbyterian which would have automatically invalidated his appointment. It was also stated that he plundered the Unicorn at the time of its disablement. Both claims were proven false. He was in fact an Episcopalian. Colonel John Anderson became President of the Council of New Jersey on March 10, 1736.
