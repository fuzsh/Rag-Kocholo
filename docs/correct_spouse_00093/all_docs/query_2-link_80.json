        "text": "For someone who has written one of the most edgy political plays of recent years, Laura Wade comes across as an unlikely revolutionary. She has said that her aim in life is to “be remembered as somebody who didn’t do much harm”, and here she is telling me in a café in north London that she’s not in the least interested in engaging in debate on social media: “I’m not on Twitter or Facebook or anything like that just because the idea of clicking the publish button and it being indelible is quite scary,” she says in her crisp, self-possessed voice. “There’s probably a reason why I gravitated towards being a playwright – the idea that you can hone the work over a long time.”\n\nThis is the second time I’ve met Wade, 36, the award-winning author of 14 plays. At our first meeting, two years ago, she wore a black trouser suit, had her hair pulled back in a severe ponytail, and avoided eye contact if at all possible. This time she’s more casual in baggy linen trousers and a light, summery blouse.\n\nIt’s just three months since she and her partner, the actor Sam West, had a daughter, and, she says with a laugh, “There’s a lot of throwing up on things at the moment.” She points at her blouse, “This is new – I put this on just before I came out.”\n\nThe play in question is Posh, a fictionalised, fly-on-the-wall account of a disgraceful and violent meeting of an all-male Oxford University dining club. First staged at the Royal Court in London in 2010 – and now being released as a film called The Riot Club – it fiercely divided opinion. I’ve heard of former public schoolboys who walked out, unable to deal with the satire; Wade herself recalls a woman who accosted her, asking her what she had against Old Etonians.\n\nWade has always insisted that the Riot Club is not a facsimile of the notorious Bullingdon Club at Oxford, but in truth you can hardly slip a cigarette paper between the two. The Bullingdon’s calling card, like the Riot’s, has been to get, as one of Wade’s characters has it, “château-ed beyond belief”, before trashing a restaurant and walking away, leaving the proprietor with a fat cheque to cover the damage.\n\nWhat gave the story political teeth at the time it was first seen, less than a month before the 2010 General Election, was the connections it made between the nepotistic, self-serving snobbery of clubs such as the Bullingdon (one character speaks the immortal words, “I am sick to f—ing death of poor people”) and the Conservative Party hierarchy. David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson were members of the Bullingdon (though they have all subsequently distanced themselves from it, most flamboyantly Johnson, describing a “team” photograph of him and fellow members, including Cameron, as “a truly shameful vignette of almost superhuman undergraduate arrogance, toffishness and twittishness”).\n\nThe Telegraph reviewer Charles Spencer described the play as “a good, old-fashioned piece of class war”. And so it felt. But it was also fresh, punchy, scurrilous and brilliantly inventive. Most extraordinary was Wade’s ability to ventriloquise the voices of public schoolboys when gathered as a pack (and here I have to declare some insider knowledge, having myself attended both Eton and Oxford).\n\nWade went to a comprehensive school in Derbyshire, and is clear that she disapproves of private schooling. Back at our first meeting in 2012 I asked her if Posh was a call to arms for the Left. Her answer was characteristically measured: “I think the play asks the question: do we need to be more concerned about this because these boys are potential leaders of the future? A call to arms sounds like very strong wording; I think it’s more an inquiry.”\n\nNow, after nearly four years of Cameron, does she see her script as prophetic? “In 2010 when the election was happening people thought it was a bit over the top. Two years later when we brought it back to the West End I felt quite vindicated. And now we’re bringing it out when we’re working towards the next election. I think the biggest thing is the empathy question and I think the Government has consistently shown a lack of that just as the boys in the play demonstrate their inability to understand the lives of others who are less wealthy and who have had fewer opportunities than them.”\n\nThe story has had to be adapted to work on screen: “The producers and I all felt that it should feel like a film, and not the film of a play. So that was about looking for a different way of telling a story. With the play being set in the one room around that table and the 10 characters being fairly evenly balanced in terms of how much we know about them, that doesn’t quite work in a film. So the film is about two of the boys who are brand-new members of the club, and it’s all about them getting into that world and being invited to be members and going to their first dinner.”\n\nIt seems, with time, Wade has rather softened towards her braying menagerie (played in the film by a bevy of chisel-cheeked, floppy haired hunks, including Freddie Fox, of the Fox acting dynasty, and Max Irons, son of Jeremy Irons and Sinéad Cusack): “I think we have to understand why these boys are attractive to be around. They’re extremely clever people. That’s something I find attractive, its intelligence and a facility with language and wit and all of those kinds of things. As well as that, the boys in the film have quite an adorable silliness.”\n\nShe was involved throughout production – “They had me on set every day, which as I far as I know is an extremely rare thing for a writer” – and clearly had a good relationship with her producer, Peter Czernin (In Bruges, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel), who, when I contacted him, gave her a glowing write-up: “Laura is quietly observant and immensely clever. She’s extremely diligent as well as sharp and funny. We had a great time working on the script, and you’ll see that she’s opened up the play in an amazing way.”\n\nCzernin might seem an odd character to be involved with a project like The Riot Club – but that old boy network moves in mysterious ways. An heir to the £2.6 billion Howard de Walden Estate in Marylebone, Czernin was at Eton with David Cameron, shared a flat with him later and donated £5,000 to his campaign to become Conservative Party leader in 2005. I asked Czernin whether his involvement with the project suggests his attitude to Cameron’s fitness to govern has changed since 2005. I also inquired whether, if he does still support Cameron, he has any reservations about the effect the film might have on the Prime Minister’s political future considering a General Election is months away.\n\nCzernin replied: no, his attitude to Cameron has not changed (“I think Cameron and his government are doing a difficult job and doing it well”). As to his reservations about timing: “I’m a firm believer in the Samuel Goldwyn maxim that 'if you want to send a message, call Western Union’. Getting a film made is not easy. The process from script to release is so long and random that, while the press might want to make parallels about timing, there are more important things going on. This [story] is fiction – people can take out of it what they will. In the end, it’s just a movie, an entertainment.”\n\nAs to Wade, does she feel the political integrity of The Riot Club is compromised by Czernin’s involvement? “I was aware of Pete’s support for Cameron’s campaign back in 2005. Pete and I might not agree on politics, but his passion and enthusiasm for the piece and his feeling that this was a story that needed to be told made him absolutely the right producer. I don’t feel that the work is compromised, because Pete’s political leanings didn’t play any part in the process and, to me, the important thing was for the film to be made by people who I knew would take good care of it and would make sure it found an audience.”\n\nFor all Wade’s support for Czernin, I’m not sure she’d describe The Riot Club as a mere “entertainment”. She talks about it with too much passion for that. Indeed, one of the most telling additions she has made to the film is a female character, Lauren (played by Holliday Grainger), a state-school girl from Huddersfield, who dates one of the Riot Club boys.\n\n“Lauren became a kind of foil: she was able to question what these guys were doing and, in a way, become the audience’s eyes,” Wade says. “And she is a bit like me in that she sees what the boys do in terms of the damage and violence and the darker end of what they get up to, and she just can’t understand it because it’s nowhere in her background or understanding of the world or morality or just good behaviour. She finds them quite appalling. I suppose it was a little bit like writing a person who I wish I had been at university rather than the person I actually was. Because she’s quite forthright.”\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Wade ever not being forthright. When she describes her childhood she portrays an earnest, focused girl. Born in Bedford, she grew up in Sheffield and later rural Derbyshire. She says she can’t remember a time when she wasn’t fascinated by theatre: “I was the kid on teenage school trips who would get very upset if anyone else was messing about in Shakespeare.”\n\nShe has led “a fairly uneventful life: it didn’t yield a great deal of material. I feel it has been so dull I can’t find a way to write about it”. As a teenager she chose subjects for plays that required research, such as deserters in the First World War. At 18 she had her first professional production at the Sheffield Crucible Studio Theatre, before going to Bristol to study drama (one character in The Riot Club jokes: “How do you make an Eton mess? Tell him he only got into Bristol”).\n\nAfter university she went on to win awards for two quirky, moving plays about death, Colder than Here (about a woman with terminal cancer) and Breathing Corpses (about people who stumble across dead bodies). In her mid-twenties she became involved with the Royal Court Young Writers programme. It was this that led to the creation of Posh.\n\n“Dominic Cooke [then director of the Royal Court] talked to me when he first came into the job, and I’d been commissioned to write a play for the theatre downstairs. I talked to him about some fairly woolly ideas I had about trying to write something about wealth and money and privilege.” That was back in 2007, and the boys of the Riot Club have dominated her life since. Does she feel she’s mined everything from that seam? She laughs. “The film of The Riot Club is, I think, the end of the chapter for me. I’ve had the boys in my head for seven years, so I’ve got to let them toddle off into the sunset with their champagne.”\n\nMeanwhile she’s on self-imposed maternity leave. She shares with Sam West (whose CV encompasses private school and membership of the Socialist Workers Party) a love of bird-watching, and the most animated I see her in our interview is when we discuss taking her daughter to the Wetland Centre in west London: “That is duck heaven,” she says. “If you like ducks, which I really do, it’s wonderful. It’s really fun. You learn how insufficient the word duck is because there are so many different sorts.”\n\nAs to politics, with the General Election around the corner, how would she like things to change? Cinematic “entertainer” with the blessing of one of David Cameron’s oldest friends Wade may now be, but the Left-wing fire’s still burning in her belly: “Someone needs to come up with some quite bold ideas about what we really believe in. And are we prepared to watch a group of people dismantle the NHS or is someone going to step forward and say, 'I’m not going to let that happen’? Is someone going to say we need a welfare state because we didn’t have one before the 1950s and this was what life was like and it’s better now? And, actually, it’s considerably cheaper than a lot of the tax dodging that goes through companies or private education or whatever? But nobody’s saying that, and I think that’s a shame because there’s a lot of people who don’t know who to get behind.”"
