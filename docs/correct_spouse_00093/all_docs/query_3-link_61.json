        "text": "👏👏👏 Alcon colleagues: if you’ve considered stepping out as a speaker before, this is your sign! Let’s get you on the red dot 🔴 this year! Shoutout to Nina Novichkova for this post and photo of amazing things happening in our organization and to Heather Arista for masterminding this event!\n\nWhat an experience volunteering with my team to support the Alcon Children’s Vision Center exams in Fort Worth!💙💙💙 🤓I specifically helped the children prepare to pick out their frames once their Rx was confirmed - what a fun room! To see their eyes light up when they learn they get to pick out new glasses was the best feeling 🤓 Thank you Alcon for your continued support of the Fort Worth Community and allowing us to be a part of it!\n\nSo thrilled with how this year’s Alcon Research Institute Podos Colloquium turned out! Great venue, great speakers, and impressive turnout and engagement. ⭐️Shout out to Brenda Laurel for seamlessly executing the event based on the vision set by the ARI Exec Committee. Well done, as always! ⭐️And to Sherry Thompson for engaging and supporting throughout the weekend! ⭐️⭐️Two amazing team members that know how to “make it happen”!\n\n🇮🇳 Find yourself a team that walks you to the door at the end of each workday and makes sure you’re settled safe in the cab before they wave goodbye and send you off to the airport 👋 ✈️ Thank you AGS Bangalore team for another productive visit to India! So proud and happy to serve you guys and to have you as part of the R&D team. Until next time… Tushar Mani Ratheesh R Love that we could “connect” in person while I was visiting! Liya Kuruvilla (She/Her) Pragya Majumdar Anitha Ganganna Thank you each for meeting me while I was visiting. Face to face collaboration is always the best kind! Milan Tagra Ashwini M Sashikala CR Vikash Verma SANDEEP Idupnoor\n\nAnother TEDx AlconR&D in the books. I say this every year, but I will NEVER tire of this event and what it means to our organization and my own team. So very proud of Heather Arista for curating a powerful set of speakers AND a volunteer team that was loyal, enthusiastic, and ALL IN! Happy 5 years of all things TEDx! Special thanks to: ❤️our leadership team for continuing to say “yes” to this line item in my budget 🖤the volunteers that said “yes” to an opportunity to work hard with big payoff ❤️each of the speakers for being vulnerable and saying “yes” to an opportunity to impact their career and their own personal development"
