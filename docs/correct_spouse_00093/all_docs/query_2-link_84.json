        "text": "Wade, 36, is best known as the writer of the hit 2010 play Posh, and its film version The Riot Club, which nailed the antics of a privileged Oxbridge club not unlike the Bullingdon, to which David Cameron belonged, or The Piers Gaveston Society for which his unsubstantiated pig-poking was supposedly an initiation rite. If anyone knows the truth it’s surely Wade, who meticulously researched such perverse ceremonies. “I never heard of it but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen,” she says. “It’s not outside the bounds of imagination. All sorts of daft things go on at university, and initiation rites are often hilarious in the different clubs.”\n\nFor the record, she says, the Bullingdon rite she was told about was “burning a £50 note in front of a tramp, which was just too horrible to put in the play because it would turn the audience off the characters immediately. But what do such stories say, in the news as in the play, about the attitude of the people involved? Their easy understanding that after their university antics they were going on into positions of power.”\n\nThis sense of privilege, of being above common moral codes, is her core concern. “It’s more important to talk about the decimation of the welfare state than whether Cameron got busy with a packet of sausages. I mean, I love a pun festival as much as anybody, and it was enormous fun for a couple of days until we ran out of the words for pork, but it’s not the most important thing.”\n\nAlthough she doesn’t nail her own political colours to the mast, it’s pretty clear Wade is no fan of the Tories. Her latest play is a wonderfully larky music hall adaptation of Sarah Waters’s Victorian lesbian tale Tipping the Velvet. Directed at the Lyric Hammersmith by her long-time collaborator Lindsay Turner, who also helmed Posh (and the current Cumberbatch Hamlet), the show ends, as does the book, with the heroine Nancy forsaking prostitution and the vanity of the stage and looking toward a brand new socialist dawn of honesty and equality with her new girlfriend. “It does seem weirdly timely,” Wade concedes. “There seems to be a hopeful message at the end that chimes with what’s going on with the Left at the moment.”\n\nI point out that as many people see Corbynite socialism as a cause for despair — a return to the factional, unelectable Eighties wilderness for Labour. She nods. “I am more on the hopeful side. I found the last election depressing in that nobody seemed to have an opinion on anything for fear of turning off potential voters. But by dint of that you don’t turn potential voters on either. Now it feels there’s a new confidence coming through. People are frustrated with politicians who just won’t say anything or just pick holes in each other’s maths. It gets to feel very picky and personal and very remote from people’s lives. I think Corbyn is a good thing.”\n\nI suspect Wade fears being defined as part of a theatrical power couple (“that’s so ridiculous”) or as “the woman who wrote Posh”. She is similarly resistant to the way she is lumped in with a gang of smart female writers who have supposedly taken over the stage and screen, alongside Polly Stenham, Abi Morgan and the Lucys, Kirkwood and Prebble. “Nobody calls David Hare a ‘male playwright’,” she observes, good-humouredly. “Men don’t need an adjectival qualification.” Before the opening of Tipping the Velvet she and Waters told the Standard that it was a myth that theatre was a place of equality, and Wade adds now that it will remain unequal as long as “women playwrights” are seen as novel or different.\n\n“Of course I’ve seen it,” says Wade. “My boyfriend’s in it! Playing an Awful Man. [West plays MP Benedict Haughton, who refuses to let his wife use her own money to bail her fellow suffragettes.] I thought it was really gripping, such an amazing story, and such a complex and important part of our history. It’s crazy that it was so recent. We think of it as a Victorian movement but it was early 20th century. There are more films to be made about the subject: we can’t go, ‘OK, we’ve had a suffragette film, we don’t need any more’.” The film’s end credits list how shockingly recently women got the vote in many countries, including Switzerland. “There were audible gasps in the cinema when I saw it,” she says.\n\nAs we come to the end of our interview, I ask Wade if she ever feels competitive with the likes of Morgan or Prebble. “Oh no,” she says. “They’re far better than me. The lovely thing about all of my dealings with writers is that we tend to be very supportive of each other because we know how difficult a job it is. I mean, not difficult like being a fireman, but in terms of the amount of work you have to do by yourself and the way you put together your own structures. I strongly believe that good work makes the world better for all of us. So if someone else has written something brilliant, there might be a moment of wishing you had written it, but that’s a good feeling, that spurs you on. There is brilliant writing and storytelling going on in the world at the moment, and it’s an exciting world to be a part of.” A speech that, dare I say it, you’d be less likely to hear from a “male writer”, I reckon."
