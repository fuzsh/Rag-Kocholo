        "text": "Hi LinkedIn, I‚Äôm looking for my next project/role, and would love your help :-) I have 20 years of experience in integrated comms strategy for B2C and B2C brands, and have also been leading the ad industry in driving success through the sustainable transition since 2018. You can dig into my linkedin profile for more detail, but in summary there are 5 key areas I work with brand, agency-side and media owner teams on: Integrated Comms Strategy: give me a shout if you need an overarching comms strategy and plan to show how brand behaviour, channels, creative & content should be used together to deliver on marketing goals. Sustainable Comms Strategy: future brand leaders will be those ahead of the game in sustainable innovation, culture, and community investment, so being able to tell your story clearly and effectively is vital - I can deliver this for you. Collaboration Architecture: I build frameworks & practices to create structure, connections & touchpoints that bring siloed teams together - so you can make the most of the multiple teams or agencies you‚Äôre working with. Trend and Audience Navigation: I offer provocative and speedy dives into the trends and audiences most relevant to your brand, along with definition of the most exciting and valuable implications for your brand. Sustainable Communications Development: I have a long history of helping marketing teams understand business sustainability commitments, their relevance to marketing, and greenwashing guidelines, and can upskill your team in this space. Drop me a line if you‚Äôd like to grab a coffee and chat :-)\n\nWHAT IF we treated every animal we met like it would be the last of its kind? Because in this future, that could start now, I doubt we would then: üêã hunt this whale ü¶Ö poison this vulture üê∑ eat this pig üê∫ shoot this wolf Instead, we would protect them with our lives, make sure they have a home, & find them a partner. For the species in this heartbreaking clip by On the Edge, the Kaua ªi  ª≈ç ª≈ç, it is too late. Their last song was heard in 1987 in Hawaii. Extinction is forever. The least we can do in their honor is to learn from our foolish mistakes & prevent them from happening again. Yet, as we speak, 1 in 8 birds are threatened with extinction globally. So we have no time to lose. üí™ What you can do # 1 Treat every animal you come across like it's the last of it kind & see your behavior changing # 2 Raise awareness by sharing clips like this to inform others about extinction # 3 Rally inside your company to start their nature-positive journey, we need companies to take responsibility # 4 Donate to On the Edge because they are just incredible Extinction is not a fun topic. I get it. But it matters. So, in honor of the Kaua ªi  ª≈ç ª≈ç, let's ensure no species ever has to go extinct again. Let's start by treating the animals differently we come across in our lives. P.S. This clip is an emotional rollercoaster. How do you feel? ‚ôªÔ∏è Repost to help spreading awareness #extinction #biodiversity #nature Credit: On The Edge (find below more links)"
