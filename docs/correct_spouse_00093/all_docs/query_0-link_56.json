        "text": "Week 61 - Bat out of Hell by Meatloaf\n\nGuest Listener - Lavinia Greenlaw\n\nWho’s Lavinia when she’s at home?\n\nI write books, mostly poetry but also including The Importance of Music to Girls and a novel about Seventies Essex and the coming of punk called Mary George of Allnorthover.\n\nLavinia’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nMary Margaret O’Hara – Miss America\n\nThe Pop Group - Y\n\nCan – Monster Movie\n\nWhat great album has she never heard before?\n\nBat out of Hell by Meat Loaf\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 60 - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust by David Bowie\n\nGuest Listener - Stewart Lee\n\nWho’s Stewart Lee when he’s at home?\n\nI am 48 in April.\n\nI was adopted into a nice family as a small child, and benefitted from a charity bung and part scholarship to a private school, which was followed by reading English at Oxford University. All these factors contributed, I think, to a confused sense of self, an uneasy notion of being out of place, an outsider even, and yet despite these feelings, I never felt it necessary to seek comfort in the music of David Bowie.\n\nToday, I am a stand-up comedian by trade, but I reviewed records for a national newspaper from 1995-2015, and have written for Q, Mojo, Uncut, Bucketful of Brains and The Wire, and yet I have never knowingly listened to a David Bowie album.\n\nStewart’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nToday it’s The Fall – Hex Enduction Hour (which is always number 1) and Miles Davis’ Kind Of Blue, and Guided By Voices’ Bee Thousand.\n\nWhat great album has he never heard before?\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars by David Bowie\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 59 - Enter the Wu Tang (36 Chambers) by The Wu Tang Clan\n\nGuest listener - David Aaronovitch\n\nWho’s David Aaronovitch when he’s at home?\n\nDavid is a columnist at The Times newspaper, a broadcaster and the author of three books, the most recent of which – Party Animals: my Family and Other Communists - was published last month. He is married to Sarah Powell, has three daughters and a dog called Dora. He lives in North London.\n\nDavid’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nSantana: Abraxas.\n\nBeatles: White Album.\n\nBob Dylan: Bringing It All Back Home.\n\nWhat great album has he never heard before?\n\nEnter the Wu Tang by The Wu Tang Clan\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 58 - Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys\n\nGuest listener - Bonnie Greer\n\nWho’s Bonnie Greer when she’s at home?\n\nBonnie Greer was born on the South Side of Chicago, the eldest of seven children .My late dad was a young GI here in Britain for the D Day Offensive, a life-changing experience for a guy born in segregated Mississippi. I was raised a Roman Catholic kid and attended Catholic school-with a brief two year hiatus in high-school until I got my undergrad degree from university.\n\nI was active politically in high-school and university - the first #blacklivesmatter generation. I was a Motown-teen largely, and when “Pet Sounds” came out in 1966, I wouldn’t have been there to greet it.\n\nBonnie’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nI have a lot of favourite albums, but if these three were played on my deathbed (they say hearing is the last sense to go) I’d be absolutely happy. They are :\n\nNina Simone – Here Comes the Sun\n\nNirvana - Nevermind\n\nMiles Davis - Sketches of Spain\n\nWhat great album has she never heard before?\n\nPet Sounds by The Beach boys\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 57 - Harvest by Neil Young\n\nGuest Listener - Brian Bilston\n\nWho’s Brian Bilston when he’s at home?\n\nI write poetry but I (and others) would hesitate to call myself a poet. I have been sharing my verse on Twitter and Facebook for the last few years with varying degrees of success. I write about the stuff of everyday life, with a particular emphasis on buses and bin days. My first collection of poetry, You Caught the Last Bus Home, will be published with Unbound later this year - https://unbound.co.uk/books/brian-bilston\n\nBrian’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nHatful of Hollow by The Smiths\n\nDifferent Class by Pulp\n\nDoolittle by Pixies\n\nWhat great album has he never heard before?\n\nHarvest by Neil Young\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 56 - Led Zeppelin II by Led Zeppelin\n\nGuest listener - Robin Ince\n\nWho’s Robin Ince when he’s at home?\n\nI present a Radio 4 science show w/ Brian Cox (“sexy face of particle physics” tm) called the Infinite Monkey Cage, write and present documentaries on things like Bertrand Russell, Schrodinger’s Cat, Melancholy and Jeff Wayne’s War of the Worlds, and until recently, I was touring my stand up shows endlessly, but have now ended that after all.\n\nRobin’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nNo More Shall We Part by Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds\n\nMeat is Murder by The Smiths\n\nLift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven by Godspeed You!

I also wrote this and if you disagree with it you can fuck off straight away.\n\nLinda’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nJoni Mitchell: Hejira\n\nRolling Stones: Goats Head Soup\n\nPatti Smith: Horses\n\nWhat great album has she never heard before?\n\nRum, Sodomy and the Lash by The Pogues\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 53 - Forever Changes by Love\n\nGuest Listener - Desi Jedeikin\n\nWho’s Desi when she’s at home?\n\nI’m a writer, living in L.A. and working on several projects that’ll probably never be made. I have lots more ideas for things that’ll probably never be made, because writing things that appeal to a minority of people who have no power in Hollywood is truly my passion. In addition to that, I love wasting valuable time I’ll never get back tweeting disgusting NSFW things on Twitter @desijed.\n\nDesi’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nThese are all ones I love:\n\n1. David Bowie, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\n\n2. The Clash, London Calling\n\n3. Dusty Springfield, Dusty in Memphis\n\nWhat great album has she never heard before?\n\nForever Changes by Love\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 52 - Astral Weeks by Van Morrison\n\nGuest listener - Daniel Maier\n\nWho’s Daniel when he’s at home?\n\nI’m a comedy writer who spent ten years watching the telly for Harry Hill’s TV Burp. More recently I’ve written things with Charlie Brooker, like A Touch Of Cloth, the DVD boxset of which is just a tenner on Amazon.\n\nDaniel’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nUsual caveats: if you asked me tomorrow, if the rest of Funhouse was as good as the first eleven minutes, etc etc.\n\n1. Julian Cope, Fried\n\n2. Tim Buckley, Happysad\n\n3.

Writes songs but has still to write a really good one, tick tock tick tock.\n\nMartin’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nGza - Liquid Swords\n\nThe Aggrovators - Johnny In The Echo Chamber\n\nThe Violent Femmes - The Violent Femmes\n\nWhat great album has he never heard before?\n\nRam by Paul McCartney\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 50 - Bringing It All Back Home by Bob Dylan\n\nGuest Listener - Samuel West\n\nWho’s Samuel West when he’s at home?\n\nHe’s an actor and sometimes a director. He’s played Hamlet and Richard II for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Jeffrey Skilling in Enron in the West End and the voice of Pongo in Disney’s 101 Dalmations II. This autumn he played Ivanov and Trigorin in Chichester Festival Theatre’s Young Chekhov season.

In his spare time he grows chillies and goes birdwatching.\n\nSamuel’s Top 3 albums ever?\n\nImpossible, but three I’d hate to be without are\n\nSuper Fly - Curtis Mayfield\n\nAnother Green World - Brian Eno\n\nEnglish Settlement - XTC\n\nWhat great album has he never heard before?\n\nBringing It All Back Home by Bob Dylan\n\nKeep reading\n\nWeek 47 - In The Aeroplane Over The Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel\n\nGuest Listener - Hrtbps\n\nWho’s Hrtbps when he’s at home?\n\nInternet nobody.\n\nHrtbps’ Top 3 albums ever?\n\nNot necessarily my favourite albums, but these are three albums which (a) in some way shaped subsequent musical tastes, (b) evoke vivid memories of the people and places I associate with first hearing them, and © I immediately think of whenever asked this question, even if I haven’t actually listened to them in the longest time.\n\nThe Unicorns – Who Will Cut Our Hair When We’re Gone?\n\nWhy? – Alopecia\n\nMo-ho-bish-o-pi – Vague Us\n\nWhat great album has he never heard before?\n\nIn the Aeroplane over the sea by Neutral Milk Hotel\n\nKeep reading\n\nPrevious page Next page"
