        "text": "British actor, theatre director and narrator\n\nFor other uses, see Samuel West (disambiguation).\n\nSamuel Alexander Joseph West (born 19 June 1966) is an English actor, theatre director and narrator. He has directed on stage and radio, and worked as an actor in theatre, film, television, and radio.[2] He was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Leonard Bast in the Merchant Ivory film adaptation of E. M. Forster's novel Howards End (1992), and was later nominated for the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his portrayal of the title role in Rupert's Land (1998). In 2010, he was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Jeffrey Skilling in Lucy Prebble's Enron. He has appeared as reciter with orchestras and performed at the Last Night of the Proms in 2002.[3] He has narrated several documentary series, including five for the BBC about the Second World War.\n\nHe currently stars as Siegfried Farnon in the Channel 5 remake of the veterinary drama series All Creatures Great and Small.\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\n\nSamuel Alexander Joseph West[4] was born on 19 June 1966[5] in Hammersmith, London, the elder son of the actress Prunella Scales and the actor Timothy West, and the grandson of the actor Lockwood West.[6][7] He has one brother, Joe.\n\nHe was educated at Alleyn's School[8] and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where he studied English literature[9][7] and was president of the Experimental Theatre Club.[10] West originally intended to attend Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, but chose instead to focus on his career after he was cast as King Caspian in the BBC's 1989 series The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.[11]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nStage[edit]\n\nWest made his London stage debut in February 1989 at the Orange Tree Theatre, playing Michael in Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles,[12] of which critic John Thaxter wrote: \"He invests the role with a warmth and validity that silences sniggers that could so easily greet a lesser performance of this difficult role, and he lets us share the tumbling emotions of a juvenile torn between romantic first love and filial duty.\"[13] Since then, West has appeared frequently on stage; he played Valentine in the first production of Tom Stoppard's Arcadia at the National Theatre in 1993,[14] and later spent two seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company playing the title roles in Richard II and Hamlet, both directed by Steven Pimlott.[15][16]\n\nIn 2002, West made his stage directorial debut with The Lady's Not for Burning at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester.[17] He succeeded Michael Grandage as artistic director of Sheffield Theatres from 2005 to 2007.[17][18] During his time as artistic director, West revived the controversial The Romans in Britain,[19] and also directed As You Like It as part of the RSC's Complete Works Festival.[20][21] West left Sheffield when the theatre closed for refurbishment in 2007, and made his West End directorial debut with the first major revival of Dealer's Choice following its transferral to the Trafalgar Studios.[22] He also continued his acting career: in 2007 he appeared alongside Toby Stephens and Dervla Kirwan in Betrayal at the Donmar Warehouse.[23]\n\nIn 2008, he played Harry in the Donmar revival of T.
