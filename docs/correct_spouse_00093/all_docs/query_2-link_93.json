        "text": "When it comes to breaking up a party, a barely stifled yawn and repeated glances at the clock are usually enough to get the hint across to the guests.\n\nNot so for the man who inspired All Creatures Great and Small’s Siegfried Farnon, he preferred a rather less subtle method – a double-barrelled shotgun.\n\nThe iconic character was originally based on real-life vet Donald Sinclair, the boss of Alf Wright who wrote the famous books under the James Herriot pen name.\n\n“He once dismissed people at a dinner party he was getting slightly bored of by picking up a double-barrelled shotgun and firing it into the wall of his house,” says actor Sam West, who plays Siegfried in the new remake of the show, set to hit screens next month.\n\nIt also stars Rachel Shenton as Helen Alderson and Nicholas Ralph as Herriot.\n\nThe original show was one of TV’s biggest hits, the Sunday-evening, cup-of-cocoa drama about the adventures of a Yorkshire vet, which became loved around the world.\n\nSam admits he has fond memories of the series and was thrilled to get to be part of the remake. But his excitement turned to trepidation as he duly researched the real Donald – and discovered a much more complex character.\n\nA moody, short-tempered and lonely man who struggled to show emotion even to those closest to him, Donald tragically took his own life soon after losing his wife, brother and the fellow vet he considered his son – James Herriot in the show.\n\nThe iconic BBC series, which ran from 1978 to 1990 starred acting legend Christopher Timothy as Herriot.\n\nRobert Hardy, who played the original Siegfried and had become friends with Donald, died aged 91, in 2017.\n\nSo Sam decided to get inspiration by finding out about the real-life Donald by speaking to Alf’s son Jim and another vet who worked with him.\n\nIn the series, Siegfried comes across as bossy and irritable, but nonetheless good and kind-hearted. But Sam says one of the first stories Jim told him was about the shotgun.\n\nThe 53-year-old adds: “I thought, ‘yeah I would do that, if I had a house and a shotgun and I knew I wasn’t going to destroy the house’.\n\n“Our on-set vet Andy also painted the same picture. He worked for Donald at the end of his life. I asked him to tell me about Donald’s eccentricities and he said, ‘he wasn’t eccentric, he was mad!’”\n\nSam also discovered Donald had committed suicide with an overdose of barbiturate in June, 1995, just two weeks after the death of his wife of 53 years Audrey, and four months after Alf’s death. His brother Brian had also died several years before. Describing Donald’s complicated relationship with Alf, he said: “There was obviously great closeness there – and great antagonism.\n\n“He never had children, he and his wife could never have children. There is a big gap between him and his younger brother, and then James comes along and, to some extent, they became the sons he never had.”\n\nSam is a fourth-generation actor in his family. His parents Timothy West and Prunella Scales have been stalwarts of British TV for decades and have won even more fans with their Great Canal Journeys show.\n\nThe couple travel the country’s waterways as Timothy and Fawlty Towers star Prunella cope with her Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Sam hopes his parents will tune in to All Creatures to see him. “They watch most things I do”, he says. “I mean, my mum won’t remember it, of course. Physically she is quite well, she is in very good spirits. You can tell that from the series.\n\n“They might smooth over some of the corners when they make it. But her mood, which is generally quite sunny, would be hard to fake. And they don’t have to.\n\n“My father is very busy, a bit lonely some of the time. We try to see him as often as we can and he is very busy, which is great. He has just finished the new series of Last Tango in Halifax. Infuriatingly, I couldn’t see him as he was only down the road when we were in Skipton.”\n\nSam got further into acting after going to Oxford to study English literature, then got a place at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. At the last minute, he landed the role of a 17-year-old German aristocrat in the 1989 feature film Reunion, which was entered for that year’s Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThat was quickly followed by the role of King Caspian in the BBC’s 1990 adaptation of The Chronicles of Narnia. In 1993, he was nominated for a best supporting actor BAFTA for his part in the film adaptation of Howards End, alongside Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins.\n\nHe is now a familiar face on TV appearing in many long-running series, including Midsomer Murders, Waking the Dead and Poirot.\n\nThe original series of All Creatures Great and Small shot the actors to stardom and made Timothy the most famous vet on the planet.\n\nAnd the collected works of All Creatures Great and Small has sold 60 million copies internationally and has never been out of print.\n\nNow, 30 years since the series ended, there are still fan clubs of the show around the world.\n\nSam, who has two daughters with wife, playwright Laura, believes the new version – which will be shown on Sunday nights like the original - could well stand the test of time.\n\nHe says: “There is an important thing about Sunday evening television that it should be an anchor in a turning world.\n\n“One thing I love about this show is it is not about titled people, it is about people doing jobs in a real situation which are extremely hard work.”\n\nChannel 5’s six-part series also stars Nicholas Ralph, 30, making his TV debut as James Herriot.\n\nSiegfried Farnon’s errant younger brother, Tristan, is played by Callum Woodhouse, 26. Callum is best known for playing Leslie Durrell in all four series of ITV comedy-drama series The Durrells. Anna Madeley, 43, takes the role of housekeeper Edna Hall.\n\nHelen Alderson is played by former Hollyoaks star Rachel Shenton, 33. Helen was previously played by Carol Drinkwater and also by the late Loose Women panelist Lynda Bellingham.\n\nShenton, who portrayed Mitzeee Minniver in Hollyoaks, won an Academy Award for her live action short film The Silent Child in 2018."
