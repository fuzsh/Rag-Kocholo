        "text": "About the Play:\n\nOther Hands is a full-length drama by Laura Wade. In a world of systematic, high-speed technology, some people expect to live life as efficiently as the machines they depend on. But in an age where things that don't work and can't be mended are thrown away, what do we do with something as human and messy as love? Other Hands is a contemporary four-hander about about love in today's technological age.\n\nOther Hands tells the story of a high-flying management consultant struggling to bring business efficiency to her personal life. Hayley is a jargon-spouting management consultant, who, behind the brisk front, is chronically unhappy with her boyfriend Steve. He has become casually hooked on computer games at home and is barely scraping a living as a freelance IT expert. Both suffer from a disabling form of repetitive strain injury that symbolizes the repeated monotony of their relationship. As their relationship malfunctions, they both also actively seek semi-platonic relationships with \"other hands\" to heal them. Hayley enjoys verbal, dinner-table seduction with a married, middle-aged client while shying away from total commitment. Steve, meanwhile, relishes a platonic friendship with lonely Lydia: an out-of-work office manager who makes up for her technological idiocy with an instinctive kindness. Other Hands is a brilliantly written play about love and technology.\n\nOther Hands premiered in 2006 at the Soho Theatre to enormous acclaim. The American premiere was in 2010 at Walnut Street Theatre on Philadelphia.\n\nCast: 2 female, 2 male\n\nWhat people say:\n\n\"What an outstanding talent…Her feel for character is exceptionally keen and she also writes excellent gags. This is an extraordinary feat- a vicious satire with a heart of gold- wrought with peculiar subtlety and intelligence.\" — The Spectator\n\n\"I take it back. Last week I was bewailing the current lack of outstanding new plays, and now here is one.\" — The Independent\n\n\"It is an original and moving play with moments of blistering wit and poignancy … Laura Wade's skill is in making the dialogue totally credible and natural…her play is full of wonderful humour.\" — CurtainUp\n\n\"Written in [Laura Wade's] precise style, and with her trademark attention to the problems of communication, this is an emotionally true account of love in an age of hi-tech. Beautifully observed, touching and funny. And a couple of the scenes are as memorable as anything in Patrick Marber's 1997 classic Closer.\" — TheStage.co.uk\n\n\"Make a beeline for Laura Wade's supersmart new play… this is where it's @.\" — The Telegraph (UK)\n\nAbout the Playwright:"
