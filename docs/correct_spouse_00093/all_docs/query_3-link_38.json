        "text": "Hello & Welcome\n\nI am an emotive storyteller and chaser of light and I want to make a real contribution to your wedding day, leaving you with imagery that is organic, considered and captivating.\n\nWhilst it is an enormous responsibility to photograph a coupleâ€™s wedding day it is one that I am immensely proud of, and I hope that my imagery is reflective of the dedication I have for my work.\n\nI aspire to leave you with transportive editorial and timeless reminders, drawing inspiration from romantic novels, photojournalism and some of the most inspiring editorial masters of our industry.\n\nAnd then there is you, two people meant for no other, a love that can only be yours. When you hold my images in your hand that is exactly what I want you to see.\n\nLAURA X\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\nWhere do I even begin? You have captured all of the most precious, monumental moments in our life to date which is a debt I could never repay...\n\nBut I'll take a quick recap back to our spontaneous waterfall photoshoot where you portrayed Maks & I's relationship in the purest of light... It was that exact experience that I knew, whenever the day may come that the love of my life asked me to be his wife, I needed you there.\n\nShortly after, then came the day I assumed was a second day of pure magic and creativity. But it turned out to be so much more. I got to experience what was once just a little girl's dream - my soulmate down on one knee and right in front of your lense, allowing me to return to that very moment at a flick through my phone. Photographs that I will cherish forever.\n\nIt was never even discussed between Maks & I that you would be the one to photograph the most important day of our lives. We trusted you with everything we had... And through so much uncertainty of the global pandemic and the unknown of when our day would finally come - that trust effortlessly grew and grew as you supported us, guided us and reassured us that no matter what; you would tell our story for exactly what it was - simply, ours.\n\nRegardless of circumstances, materialism and uncontrollable situations, it was thanks to you that we had no doubt we would get our happily ever after. You have become so much more than just an extremely talented lady to us - We adore you firstly as a forever friend, our storyteller and lastly, our photographer. If anyone was ever to need any reassurance in their selection of Laura Wade, I hope that it can be this very testimonial.\n\nFuture Brides & Grooms, Laura is your one\n\nMR & MRS KOBURN\n\nWith her creative background and artistic presentation Laura Wade was the obvious choice as our wedding photographer.\n\nLaura does far more than just take photographs, she tells the story! Her ability to capture and combine an easily overlooked detail or moment of sincerity in a way that can dramatically enhance the memories of your special day are to be admired.\n\nAdded to that she is a joy and pleasure to have in your company, her rare and subtle skill of being ever available but never intrusive or overpowering are assets that help her to stand out as a first class wedding photographer. Her genuine warmth, effortless smile and personable demeanour makes Laura the perfect choice for couples looking to capture what her style embodies, Romance!\n\nMR & MRS HELSBY"
