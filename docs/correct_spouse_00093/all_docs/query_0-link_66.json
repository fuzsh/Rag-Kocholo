        "meta_description": "Gregory Donald Hutchins, 62, passed peacefully surrounded by his family on Saturday, July 6, 2024, a year and a half after his ALS diagnosis.\nBorn April 28, 1962, in Asheville, Greg Hutchins was the middle child of the late Phyllis and Cecil Hutchins. Greg graduated from Clyde A. Erwin High School in 1980, and attended Wake Forest University where he earned his undergraduate degree in business. He then went on to earn his Juris Doctor from Campbell University School of Law in 1987. Greg obtained his first job as an attorney at Roberts and Stevens Law Firm in 1987. The firm family was immensely important to him. He remained at the firm the duration of his career where he became partner, and then President 2013-2023. Greg knew from a young age that he wanted to study law and become an attorney to help others through his work. Little did he know the lives he would impact in the future. He enjoyed mentoring young lawyers and was known for his strong work ethic, attention to detail, and profound dedication to his clients.\nScouting was another strong passion of Greg’s. His trail in the program began as a young child in Cub Scouts and he advanced to earn the Eagle Scout Award. In the early 1980’s he joined the Summer Staff at Camp Daniel Boone. For five years he led the Scoutcraft and High Adventure program areas. His contributions during those years, and subsequent years, positioned the Camp for significant growth. He could be counted on for always showing up and putting in the work, solving problems, and leading by example. The Executive Board of the Daniel Boone Council asked for his service in the early 1990’s, continuing until 2024. For many years he served on the Council Camping Committee. In addition, he was the long-tenured Legal Counsel, followed by two years as Board Chair. After starting a family, he filled the role of Scoutmaster for Troop 3, at his home church of Trinity United Methodist in West Asheville. As Scoutmaster, he guided many Scouts to earn the Eagle Rank, including all three of his sons. He also led countless others through obtaining merit badges, weekend camping trips, and embracing the scouting way by learning perseverance and responsibility. Recognizing his leadership and impact on the Scouting community, the Daniel Boone Council awarded its highest honor, the Silver Beaver, to Greg in 1999. In 2024, the Greg Hutchins Eagle Spirit Award was created and will be awarded annually to an Eagle Scout, acknowledging their impact on scouting and the way they portray the Eagle spirit in all they do.\nAs a lifelong resident of Buncombe County Greg enhanced his community through serving on the board of the following organizations: Trinity United Methodist Church, Givens Estates Methodist Retirement Community, Buncombe County Land Conservation Advisory Board, Deltec Homes, and Daniel Boone Council Executive Board.\nHis most important role was that of a father and husband. As a proud father of five and loving husband of 36 years, Greg dedicated his life to serving and providing for his family with steadfast encouragement and support. When he wasn’t practicing law or watching an event for one of his children, he could be found on the family farm in Leicester, mending fence, baling hay, driving tractors, or caring for black angus cattle. As an avid outdoorsman he also spent many weekends hiking, camping, backpacking, and rock climbing with friends and family in the mountains of western North Carolina, and in the Wind River and Glacier National Parks. While he was often known for being straight laced and serious he also spent a lot of time joking around with his kids and sisters and enjoyed letting loose on our annual beach vacation lovingly called the “Fripp trip.”\nHe is survived by the loves of his life including his caring wife, Nancy; his devoted children (and spouses): Nathan (Drew), Laura Elizabeth (Taylor), Jeff (Sam), Neal, and Emma Grace, as well as his grandchildren; Cole Warren, Callahan Gregory, and another on the way. He is also survived by his sisters, Leslee Sprague (Peter), Andrea Hunnicutt, and several beloved nieces and nephews.\nThe family will receive friends at a reception beginning at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, July 11, in the fellowship hall of Trinity United Methodist Church at 587 Haywood Rd. The funeral service will follow at 2:00 p.m. in the sanctuary.\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider supporting the Hutchins Memorial which is constructing a new building or program infrastructure at Camp Daniel Boone in memory of Greg.
