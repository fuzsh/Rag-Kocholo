        "text": "Meet Laura Wade, Passion Test Facilitator and Owner of Thrive by Heart\n\n\"Using the same process I teach, I went from being a stay-at-home mom who felt unworthy and unhappy to a woman who knew what she wanted, how to manage my mindset and to believe I deserved happiness.\"\n\nWho or what inspired you to start your business?\n\nI got excited about being a transformational trainer almost 30 years ago when I begin attending trainings and workshops and decided I wanted to be the woman in front of the room. My mom was a teacher and my dad was an entrepreneur so they both influenced me. I have been doing some form of transformational teaching since 1994 and started Thrive by Heart in 2007 when I became a certified facilitator. My influences in the field have been Janet Attwood, Jack Canfield, and other leaders whose trainings I have attended or books I have read.\n\nWhat has having your own business meant to your family? The Good, the bad, the ugly?\n\nBy being a model of living my passion to empower women to listen to their hearts and use their gifts and passions, my children know that I support them in living theirs as well.\n\nI am a happier mom because I do something I love and get to do that while being available to my children (now teenagers) when they need me. The challenge has been similar to what everyone faces – finding harmony in all my roles and how I allocate time and attention to my family, home and business.\n\nIf you had to choose one strength that you possess that has helped you be the most successful- what would it be and why?\n\nPassion! I truly believe that we are passionate about the things that allow us to live our best lives and share our gifts with others. Our purpose is found when we stick to the path where our passions lead. I think my passion to inspire others attracts clients and also keeps me moving forward even in tough times.\n\nWhat are you passionate about?\n\nBeing a loving and supportive mom and wife! Empowering women to love themselves and their lives! To provide education and tools that support them in having the relationships, careers and lifestyles they truly desire!\n\nWhat piece of advice would you give yourself if you were just starting your business again today?\n\nBelieve you offer value, and don’t stress about the money.\n\nIn what ways can your business help another mom?\n\nWomen can attend workshops or receive individual guidance on discovering their passions, gain clarity about what matters most to them and learn tools to help them on their journey. Using the same process I teach, I went from being a stay-at-home mom who felt unworthy and unhappy to a woman who knew what she wanted, how to manage my mindset and to believe I deserved happiness. And I get paid for doing what I love!\n\nWhat has been your favorite local resource to support you in your business?\n\nFemCity! I love the wonderful networking opportunities as well as the support and encouragement I have received as a member. It is incredible to be part of a community that collaborates, educates and inspires its members.\n\nHow do I get in touch or attend a class?\n\nConnect with Laura on facebook to inquire about individual coaching or to attend a group workshop."
