        "text": "Laura Wade-Gery has sparked debate after having a baby at the age of 50. [Photo: Rex]\n\nAs women, we’re often told that we can’t “have it all”. Our biological clock starts ticking basically as soon as we hit 25 and we then have to choose whether to pursue a successful career or have a family, because we can’t possibly do both. Well, that’s what health professionals (and the likes of Kirstie Alsopp) lecture us.\n\nBut one woman should be applauded for proving that we can. We can have it all.\n\nLaura Wade-Gery has been thrust into the spotlight in the last few days after it was revealed that she’s about to go on maternity leave at the grand old age of 50. The businesswoman is one of Marks and Spencer’s top female employees. She’s one of the brand’s senior directors and is tipped to become the next boss after Marc Bolland steps down – hence why news of her maternity leave has made her a figure of such interest.\n\nWade-Gery is expecting her first child with her second husband, Simon Roberts, and is expected to take four months of maternity leave before returning to work in January 2016. Her position is somewhat rare in the business world, partly because of her age and partly because women in such senior positions rarely take maternity leave – which is why she should be celebrated.\n\nBut not everyone thinks Wade-Gery is such an inspiration. Since her leave was announced on the stock exchange in London (investors have to be told if senior directors will be away from their desks for over three weeks), the mum-to-be has received her fair share of criticism for becoming a mother later in life.\n\nHer news is being used to warn women about the risks of delaying motherhood and no doubt there are those who think that she’s simply too old to be a fit mother. After all, by the time her child is at senior school she’ll be classed as an Old Aged Pensioner. But while she may not be as active as some young parents, that isn’t to say she won’t be the world’s best mum and lavish her little one with love and affection.\n\nSandra Bullock became a mum at the age of 45, after adopting her son Louis. [Photo: Rex]\n\nJohn Travolta’s wife Kelly Preston got pregnant with a “miracle baby” at the age of 47. [Photo: Rex]\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to being an older mum. For one, you won’t resent your tot for ‘stealing’ your career opportunities – nor your partner for leaving you at home to raise a child while he swans off to work each day. More mature mothers also have years of worldly experience that they can no doubt use to benefit their parenting skills. Plus, they’re less likely to worry about money or security.\n\nBut we can’t leave out the risks associated with putting off having child - should you want to conceive naturally and carry your own baby. Pregnancy later in life is much tougher on the body and comes with a higher chance of complications. And getting pregnant in the first place can be a struggle.\n\nNew advice suggests that women who’re hoping to have a big family should start trying for their first child at the age of 23. Yes, just two years after leaving university and before most of us even have got our careers on track or found someone serious to get pregnant with.\n\nScientists looked at fertility data from almost 60,000 women to create an at-a-glance calculator that advises ladies on when you should pregnant. In an ideal world, obviously. Basically, if you’re over the age of 23 and hoping to have more than two kids then you may have a tough time conceiving all three naturally.\n\nBut thanks to the wonders of modern day science, women have more choice. Methods including IVF, adoption and surrogacy allow women to become mothers later in life, if natural conception isn’t possible. However, some women are adament that they want to carry their own child and experience pregnancy.\n\nIt’s a tough choice. It’s not known the reason why Wade-Gery is having her first baby at the age of 50 – nor does it matter – but she’s an inspiration to all young women who want both a successful career and a family.\n\nDo you feel under pressure to start a family?
