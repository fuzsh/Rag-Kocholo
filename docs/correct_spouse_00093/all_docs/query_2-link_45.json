        "meta_description": "This article proposes to consider the notion of transmission in relation to the process of adaptation since adaptations, whatever form they take, bring a text—transmit a text—to a new audience while submitting the text to a process of transformation and appropriation. Jane Austen’s relatively small body of work has given rise to countless television or film adaptations, stage adaptations but also narrative expansions and continuations that all revisit Austen’s characters and plots. The intermedial adaptation under consideration here is that of a fragment written by Austen in 1805, The Watsons, by English playwright and screenwriter Laura Wade in 2018. The aim of this article is to examine how Wade’s play establishes and reflects on its own status as an adaptation in the twenty-first century while tackling the issue of authenticity inevitably raised by adaptation and continuation. Following a few remarks on the adaptation of unfinished texts, I will examine the metafiction and metatheatricality at work before focusing on the issue of the ending.",

        "text": "On Adaptation and Unfinished Texts\n\n3Wade’s work on The Watsons emerges in the context of the twenty-first century enthusiasm for stage adaptations. In 2003 a theatre critic pointed out ‘If there is one inescapable reality in British theatre today, it is our obsession with adaptations’ (Charlotte Higgins Guardian 23 October 2003, quoted by Rees 138). The trend does not seem to have abated. Laera notes that ‘theatre venues continue to bank on the attractive familiarity of adaptations’ (Laera 2). Significantly, the verb chosen by Laera here also indirectly evokes the financial attraction of adaptations for theatre producers. For instance, 2020 saw three stage adaptations of complex novels by Angela Carter, Emily Brontë and Virginia Woolf (see Akbar). Mark Lawson calls this trend in the theatre ‘the acted book’ (2014), stressing the significance of the adapter’s work as, he says, ‘it remains a problem that satisfying novels rarely prove an easy fit for theatre’ (Lawson).\n\n5Firstly, as Hutcheon points out, for an adaptation to be experienced as such, ‘we need to recognise it as such and to know its adapted text’ (Hutcheon 120121). Because Wade cannot assume that her audience knows the fragment and is trying to appeal not only to Austen’s aficionados but also to an audience who has not read the text or does not even know about it nor necessarily knows much about Austen, Wade builds in the necessary information in her play that is then marked by self-reflexivity and enables her to address ‘both knowing and unknowing audiences’ (Hutcheon 121).\n\nA Metafictional and Metatheatrical Adaptation\n\n9As an incomplete piece, The Watsons has been the object of several continuations at various periods. The problem is, as director Samuel West points out, that they bear the signs of their time while pretending to be contemporary with Austen. Wade skirts around the difficulty because she does not even attempt to pass off her continuation as authentic: Wade makes the fact that Austen’s text is unfinished the very topic of the play and points to the adaptive process through authorial metalepsis (see Genette 2004, 1213), by writing herself in the text under the name of Laura.\n\n10The play thus bears the main trait of postmodernism following Linda Hutcheon, i.e. a ‘“nudging” commitment to doubleness’, an overt self-consciousness that serves to ‘de-naturalize’ what we tend to take for granted (Hutcheon 2002, 1, 2). The play’s postmodern self-reflexivity thus foregrounds the issues associated with continuation as well as the challenge to its own attempt at continuing the story. The usual criticism levelled at continuation is expressed when Laura deems her inclusion of the characters’ rebellion in the play ‘a bit more interesting than watching a writer slavishly trying to recreate’ (Wade 81) and Emma exclaims ‘You can’t even do your own story, you have to borrow someone else’s. Making your bid for posterity by riding on someone else’s coat-tails. Haven’t you got stories of your own?’ (87). We recognise here the usual accusation of lack of originality coupled with the attempt to sound like, to imitate or pastiche the source text, in other words to aim for a form of authenticity. In typical postmodern fashion, this latter point is both underlined and undermined through self-conscious remarks about language: ‘Hey? Is that right?’ (30) and ‘you can’t say that’ (86) Laura says when Emma uses words that do not fit her time.\n\n11Indeed, Laura describes her work as ‘picking up the baton’ (33), a metaphor that evokes a relay race in which runners take turns in aiming for the same direction. No writing back or rewriting is intended here as Laura explains her attempt at continuing the story is a labour of love:\n\nShe only wrote six books and it’s not enough. So here’s this little bit of a book a glorious gift from this person who knew human folly better than anyone else, who is a friend, a comfort, a gossip, who’s cynical and romantic, a better storyteller than I’ll ever be and I’m here to fucking honour her. (61)\n\n12Laura’s high praise for Jane Austen’s work humorously ends on the contrast in the combination of a very offensive adverb with the verb ‘honour’ which suggests respect and decorum, this contradiction reading as a postmodern way to express homage. The representation of Laura’s endeavours to adapt The Watsons to the stage allows for a commentary on Austen’s fiction and characters and its criticism as it includes remarks about her writing, her life and beliefs (for instance, see 4245, 9697).\n\n13Wade makes no pretence of being able to continue seamlessly. Including the persona of the writer within the play enables metanarrative remarks, i.e. ‘refer[ring] to the narrator’s reflections on the act or process of narration’ (Neumann and Nünning), about the creation or fleshing out of characters (see, for instance, Wade 3738, 42 and 46). It also allows a quick dive into the author’s psyche and ego when the play’s status as adaptation is addressed. Thus, when Emma asks ‘why not a novel?’, Laura ‘mutters’ her answer: ‘I like it when they clap’ (84). However, it is worth noting that signs of metadrama are also present in the early part of the play, when Wade dramatises Austen’s text.\n\n14The play opens in Mr Watson’s bedroom where Elizabeth tells her younger sister Emma what will happen at the ball she is going to attend. Most interestingly, as this unfolds, a stage direction indicates that ‘the assembly room gradually appears’ (Wade 3): what Elisabeth describes is being performed in another part of the stage with Emma present in both scenes. For instance, Elisabeth’s declaration: ‘You will certainly be noticed by Tom Musgrove’ is immediately followed by the appearance of the character on the stage.\n\nElizabeth: You will certainly be noticed by Tom Musgrave.\n\nTOM MUSGRAVE appears, bows.\n\nTOM MUSGRAVE: Miss Emma Watson, the reports of your beauty, which I feared excessive, were if anything too restrained. (4)\n\n15In this first part, Emma is both spectator and actor until the stage is entirely devoted to the ball as indicated by the stage direction ‘Elizabeth pushes Mr Watson’s bed off. The dancers move into the space left by the bed, and form two lines’ (8). In other words, Elizabeth’s narrative is being performed, i.e. adapted to the stage. There is a sort of mise en abyme as the audience is looking at an adaptation that foregrounds the process of adaptation. This opening, with a modern conception of the stage as it is gradually split in two, serves to introduce both the characters and the adaptation as adaptation.\n\n17As part of Laura’s quest for an authentic rendering of Austen’s work, the facts are clearly laid out. For instance, Laura specifies when Austen’s text actually stopped; she quotes Austen’s letter to her niece about ‘marrying without affection’ (Wade 45) and reports what is known about the context of The Watsons and Austen’s plans. All is explained to the audience through dialogues between the writer and the characters in an inclusive viewer-friendly manner, thus verifying John Pier’s claim that ‘intrametaleptic movements’, when an author intervenes in her fiction (as opposed to character transgressing the extradiegetic boundary), ‘mark an affinity between narrator and narratee’ (Pier). Indeed, Laura is the reader/viewer’s representative in the play, as indicated when the character explains that her project of continuation stems from her narrative curiosity and wish for closure: ‘you were in a kind of limbo, unfinished. . . . I wanted to know what was going to happen to you’ (Wade 38).\n\n18However, when Laura actually quotes what is known about the purported end of The Watsons, the characters challenge the authenticity of Austen’s intentions by pointing to the intermediaries (her sister Cassandra Austen and her nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh) through whom the indications filtered (Wade 57). The authority of the written word is challenged in postmodern fashion as this pointing out of the textuality of history reminds us of Hutcheon’s historiographic metafiction.\n\n19Later, Laura makes a direct metafictional reference to Pirandello’s play in which characters are aware of their status: on the phone to her artistic director (using the name of a real-life person), Laura refers to the play she is writing and which is being performed as ‘a play about the difficulty. It’s about what the characters do when their first author abandons them and they don’t want to do what the new writer says so it’s about self-determination . . . Yes, a bit like the Pirandello’ (Wade 81). But here again, Wade adapts the source text as the characters in Wade’s play are not in search of an author but trying to shake her off.\n\nHow to End?\n\n20Adaptation walks the line between recognition and novelty (see Rees and Hutcheon) and the question arises as to how Wade negotiates what is expected of an Austenian ending. Austen scholars assess The Watsons as particularly dark: conversations are ‘strikingly grimmer than anything else in her work’ (Tomalin 186). At the point where Austen breaks off her narrative, Emma’s situation in The Watsons ‘is almost unrelievedly bleak’ (Castle xxix) yet the plot was apparently supposed to finish with a love match and have a happy ending nonetheless (Castle xvii).\n\n21In order to achieve this, Wade adds comedy to her continuation of the fragment. The comic arises out of the discrepancy between what we know or recognise of Austen’s works and characters and the situation in which they are put. For instance, Laura misquotes the famous incipit of Pride and Prejudice when trying to get herself out of a corner: ‘I believe, my lord, it’s a well a truth generally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife who um who has absolutely definitely has taken the time to consider his proposal at the very least overnight’ (Wade 29).\n\n22Once Laura’s identity has been revealed and the illusion broken, the rift is visually represented in Act 2 with Laura ‘now wearing modern clothes’ (Wade 51) and the door is open for anachronisms the incongruity of which is a source of comedy: for instance, when one of the characters (Margaret) unwittingly describes an orgasm or when Robert proudly invents a ‘communications device’ that he says is an improvement on Laura’s mobile phone: ‘one isn’t forced to carry it in one’s pocket’ (92).\n\n24The problem in the play is that the characters are not happy with the rewarding ending supposedly devised for them by Austen and relayed by Laura. Emma, for instance, has mixed feelings about the prospect of marrying pious and virtuous Mr Howard: ‘Perhaps I want someone with more spirit, more fight’ (Wade 62). Wade thus acknowledges and states in an indirect way that the traditional happy ending cannot work for our time: a twenty-first century play cannot end in a way that today seems limiting. In other words, Wade states the case for adaptation even as Laura strives for a form of authenticity and fidelity.\n\n26Laura tries to exert control, protesting that the characters need structure and taking up Aristotle’s precept: ‘it’s not a soap opera, you need a beginning, a middle and an end or it’s not satisfying’ (Wade 63). Not only is the importance of the end of a story stated but it somehow becomes a topic in itself in the second act when Laura wants to implement the plan she thinks is ‘authentic Jane Austen’ (61). Emma makes suggestions that Laura rejects as ‘not very Jane Austen, sadly’ (42) and the situation seems to get out of hand when the characters rebel. As the characters vote on their outcome, Wade’s play seems to implement literally Mark Lawson’s claim that ‘A novel is a dictatorship, but a dramatisation is a democracy’ (Lawson)—even though Lawson here actually refers to the loss of control for the novelist when his or her work is adapted notably because the spectator is free to focus on whoever he wishes on the stage and because of the actor’s input in a character. In the end, Wade’s adaptation-continuation takes the shape of an actualisation of the Austenian ‘love-match’.\n\n28The play is also about a writer’s growth and development from a self-serving wish to satisfy her narrative curiosity and her ego—‘I like it when they clap’ (Wade 84)—to the sudden realisation that ‘you’re better off unfinished’ (Wade 99). Despite her earlier declarations, Laura eventually renounces her wish to impose closure and limits on Emma, acknowledging Austen’s authority and the power of the open ending that leaves endless possibilities:\n\nFinishing means you only get one story. All possibilities collapse down into one. . . .\n\nOne life isn’t enough for you. It isn’t enough for any of us, she knew that.\n\nWhen she abandoned you, Jane gave you freedom. If I leave you unfinished, you can do anything. (99)\n\n29In a final metafictional and metaleptic gesture that also signifies the character’s empowerment, Laura leaves Emma a copy book to write her own stories, like the baton mentioned earlier but now to go wherever she likes.\n\n30If transmission may be a way to preserve texts and their memory, this is not a direct process but one that goes through adaptation or appropriation. When comparing Wade’s The Watsons with ITV’s Sanditon, Billingdon concludes ‘Theatre’s room for experiment delivers the most satisfying imaginative leap’ (Billingdon). Indeed, in Laera’s words, ‘As a memory machine, theatre is the site for the recollection, the re-elaboration, and contestation of readily available cultural material, and for the production of new, and newly adaptable, ideas out of established ones’ (Laera 3). The Watsons is not just a stage adaptation but also a self-conscious reflexion on what adaptation and continuation transmit coupled with an accelerated course on Austen’s life and work. Paradoxically, at the same time as the device of adaptation is exposed and postmodernism seems to rule, the quest for authenticity is not fully dismissed: the recourse to metafiction and metatheatre that ‘lay bare the device’ acknowledges the irrelevance of authentic continuation but enables a thorough discussion and transmission of Austen and her world. When ‘picking up the baton’ (Wade 33) from Austen, Wade delivers a post-postmodern play, to use Jeffrey Nealon’s term: self-reflexive and playful yet a true homage to Austen’s work and legacy."
