        "text": "Earlier this year the actor Samuel West wrote a letter to his younger self in which he reflected that if he could choose to have one last good conversation with anyone, it would be with his mother. She is the actress Prunella Scales, best known as Basil’s long-suffering wife, Sybil, in Fawlty Towers. At 89, she has been suffering from Alzheimer’s disease for 20 years.\n\n“There was a Christmas about ten years ago when I was asking questions about our living arrangements after I was born. My father [the actor Timothy West] couldn’t remember; my mother almost could remember — and then it was gone. And I realised then that there were certain things I would never now be able to know from her,”"
