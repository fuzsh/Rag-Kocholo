Until then, the health and wellbeing of our company and audiences remain our priority, and we thank you for your continued understanding during this difficult time.\n\nIf you are a ticket holder you do not need to do anything for the moment as your ticket provider will be in contact to assist you. We wish safety and good health to you all.\n\nâ â â â â\n\nâA beautiful bold production. A stunning play.â\n\nThe Guardian\n\nThe Watsons tickets at the\n\nHarold Pinter Theatre\n\nBook your tickets to see The Watsons transfer to Londonâs Harold Pinter Theatre in 2020"
