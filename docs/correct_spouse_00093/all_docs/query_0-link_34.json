        "text": "Then the fun started. Home, I’m Darling, a witty examination of the myth of the perfect Fifties housewife, opened to acclaim at the National Theatre in August and has been shortlisted for Best Play, in partnership with Chanel, at this month’s Evening Standard Theatre Awards. It transfers to the West End in January. As if that weren’t enough, another new drama, a playful adaptation of an unfinished novel by Jane Austen, is about to premiere in Chichester.\n\nAusten wrote some 18,000 words of The Watsons and then stopped. Luckily Wade, a long-time Austen devotee, has decided to help her out — and have a fair bit of fun, with echoes of Luigi Pirandello, en route. In all sorts of ways, Wade offers a mischievous blast of female agency, as heroine Emma Watson attempts to juggle, in a manner redolent of Pride and Prejudice, the conflicting demands of a poor family and a pure heart.\n\nWade, a measured and elegant 41, says this project has been many years in the making, but “it took me a long time to get it right”. She knew she wanted to do an adaptation of a classic and “this felt like a great one to go at, because it had all of that wonderful Jane Austen deliciousness, but it was unfamiliar to people because of being unfinished. I wanted to do something around the idea of what happens to the characters once the author goes away.”\n\nWade’s partner, and the father of her two young daughters, is actor/director Samuel West, and he was always a strong believer in the project, encouraging her to go back to it when she had put it away. West is now directing The Watsons, the first time the pair have worked together in this way.\n\n“He’s really good at wrangling a large cast,” says Wade, which is lucky — there are a budget-busting 15 actors in the production. Do the couple find themselves talking about The Watsons over breakfast? “A little bit,” says Wade. “It’s that, but at the same time trying to feed a baby and stop a four-year-old dropping bran flakes on the floor. This morning, Sam was doing something with one child and I was doing something with the baby and I said, ‘That line should be this rather than this’, and he said, ‘Yes’, and we just carried on.”\n\nTwo new plays opening in a little over three months is quite a statement to be making. Wade smiles. “I’m saying, here’s what I’ve been doing. I do have a feeling of being back in the game a bit, although apart from maternity leave I’ve always been working all this time.”\n\nShe has certainly not been slacking. Firstly, there was The Riot Club (2014), the film adaptation of Posh, for which Wade wrote the screenplay. She’s currently working on a biographical film about a Victorian female legal campaigner and creating a TV drama set in Georgian times.\n\n“It looks as though you’ve been away and you haven’t, you’ve been in the shed at the bottom of your garden, which is where I write. The good thing about my shed is that it isn’t big enough for anyone else to go in, so if anybody comes down the garden, they can’t stay and chat!\n\n“Before we had it built and I was working in the house — when the children were at home, even when they were being looked after by someone else — there was a part of my brain that was always listening in. This is a focus— when I’m in my shed, what I’m doing is working. It’s very Virginia Woolf, a shed of one’s own.”\n\nIn the time that Wade has been in her shed and out of the public eye, her male contemporaries, the likes of James Graham, Mike Bartlett and Nick Payne, have created an abundance of work , both for the theatre and, latterly, television. Wade grins. “I don’t know how the men write so fast. They do a lot of plays, the men, don’t they?”\n\nIs she given the same sort of opportunities? “I’ve never felt treated differently,” she says. “But I think as a person I’m quite accepting and in previous years I haven’t questioned and have gone along with what I’ve been offered. I’ve assumed that if I wasn’t writing for particular theatres, that was because I hadn’t gone to them with an idea.” She pauses. “My writing has been slowed down by having a family in recent years. I haven’t talked to the male writers about it. I don’t know whether they feel the split focus as much after having children.”\n\nShe continues: “It’s difficult, all of this [gender equality] stuff comes up and you think about it: ‘Have I in any way been undermined and not realised it?’ I suppose it’ll come clear over the next few years. I would love to write something for the [National’s] Lyttelton or the Olivier. Thus far I don’t think I’ve had an idea that would suit either of those spaces. The moment I do, I’ll be knocking on Rufus’s [Norris] door and if he says, ‘No, you’re a girl’, then there’s your answer!’\"\n\nI do wonder if the likes of David Hare would ever have such cavils, pondering whether what he had to say was enough to fill such large spaces. Therein resides the current gender conundrum.\n\n“I sometimes wonder if there is an amount of stepping-up that I need to do in my thinking, in terms of what I want to say. Head-above-parapet time sort of thing. I’m not sure I’ve worked out technically how to do that, in the same way that I haven’t worked out how to do a musical. So I’m probably sticking at what I know. I’ve gone all honest. Shut up!”\n\nWade grew up in Sheffield, with “the amazing Crucible on the doorstep” and was taken to the theatre from an early age by her parents. It’s a little-publicised fact that she was an Anya Reiss-style child prodigy, having a play produced at the Crucible Studio when she was still at school. “It was seismic,” says Wade. “It was my first experience of having an audience of strangers walking into a room to hear a story I’d written. It was quite intoxicating.”\n\nWade says that she now tends to “identify as a sociable introvert. It feels part of learning to be comfortable with the writer I am. Both of them are a work in progress.”\n\nWhat matters, she says, are “stories. Listening to other people’s stories, learning about truth through fiction. I think that’s why theatre is important, because it invites us to give our full attention to a story without doing something else at the same time. So, yeah, stories, basically. Love and stories.”"
