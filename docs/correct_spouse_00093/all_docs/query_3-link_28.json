Judy and Johnny have re-created their lives into the ultimate, nostalgic fantasy of the 1950s—picture perfect domesticity. But when cracks begin to appear in the fantasy, Judy must face the more realistic underpinnings of love and marriage.\n\nThis British social satire was winner of the 2018 Olivier Award for Best New Comedy and played to sold out houses in London and Sydney. Now, it will have its American Premiere on the Mendocino Theatre Company stage."
