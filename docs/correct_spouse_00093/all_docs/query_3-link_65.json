        "text": "Laura Wade, MD – Family Physician / Owner\n\nDr. Laura is a co-founder of Remedy Direct Primary Care and is excited to provide personal care for her patients.\n\nDr. Laura was born and raised in Phoenix, AZ and still has a special love for the desert. She attended undergrad and medical school at the University of Arizona (Go Wildcats!) before moving to Denver for residency. She trained at St. Joseph Family Medicine Residency taking care of patients of all ages from prenatal care to geriatrics. She and her husband Ryan then moved back to Arizona to be closer to family. Dr. Laura worked for North Country HealthCare in Williams before co-founding Remedy Direct Primary Care with Dr. Mike.\n\nShe is looking forward to building strong relationships with her patients at Remedy DPC. Dr. Laura has a special interest in women’s health and pediatrics but loves being able to take care of all ages and genders. Outside of work she enjoys spending time with husband Ryan and dog Ruby, reading fiction, hiking, and skiing.\n\nMichael Druschel, MD – Family Physician / Owner\n\nDr. Mike is a co-founder of Remedy Direct Primary Care. He is thrilled to be able to provide care for members and provide fee-for-service affordable procedures to non-members come January 2, 2022.\n\nDr. Mike grew up in western Pennsylvania, attended medical school at Georgetown University School of Medicine, and then went on to residency at the Family Medicine Residency of Western Montana. He was trained in broad-spectrum rural family medicine in Kalispell, Montana.\n\nAfter residency he worked at Family Health Care of Ellensburg in central Washington state. This was a private practice with critical access hospital affiliation and Dr. Mike practiced prenatal, newborn, adult, geriatric, inpatient, and outpatient medicine. He moved to Flagstaff, AZ to be closer to his parents. Through the end of 2021, Dr. Mike is helping care for the people of Williams and Seligman with North Country HealthCare. Then in January 2022, he will be focusing fully on Remedy Direct Primary Care.\n\nHe loves practicing the fullest breadth of family medicine and enjoys point-of-care ultrasound, injections, procedures, and patient-centered care for all ages/genders/walks of life. When not practicing medicine, he can be found hiking, skiing, or biking with his two daughters and wife.\n\nSteven Ochi, DO – Family Physician / Owner\n\nDr. Steven “Steve” Ochi is board certified in Family Medicine and OMT (Osteopathic Manipulation Therapy). He graduated from Western University in Pomona, CA and later completed his internship and residency at Pacific Hospital in Long Beach.\n\nHe served for 6 years at a community clinic in southern California before moving his family to Flagstaff in 2018.\n\nDr. Ochi’s philosophy is to partner with the patient and work together to achieve desired health outcomes, which include the use of OMT. OMT is a modality used to treat musculoskeletal conditions such as neck and back pain, headaches and other medical conditions.\n\nHe enjoys spending time with his wife and 3 children in the beautiful surroundings of Flagstaff, and loves to play guitar and piano to relax.\n\nMya Trent – Administrative Assistant\n\nMya has been with Remedy since it opened in 2022, first joining us as a shadow, then a student intern, and now as an employee. She was raised in Flagstaff and recently graduated from NAU in December of 2023 with dual degrees in biomedical science and English literature. While she is currently working on getting into medical school to further her passion for medicine, she continues to serve Remedy in any way she can! On Thursdays, she spends her time as a student with our providers, and you may find her in your appointment if you so allow.\n\nWhen not at Remedy, you can find Mya studying, or you may see her taking care of children and animals in her work as a nanny and pet sitter around town. Don’t be afraid to say hello if you do!\n\nMonique Beach – Medical Assistant\n\nMonique has over 16 years of experience in the medical field. She has served her patients as an emergency medical technician prior to becoming a certified medical assistant. Monique cares greatly about her patient care and will assist our doctors with blood draws, patient calls, text messaging, emails, faxes, and procedures. She is glad to be working at Remedy and have an active role in helping patients achieve the care coordination they need.\n\nWhen not caring for patients, Monique can be heard listening to country music, helping out friends and family, or hanging with her lovable dogs."
