Laura Wade’s new play The Watsons, adapted from an unfinished novel by Jane Austen, opens next month.

Emma Watson is nineteen and new in town. She’s been cut off by her rich aunt and dumped back in the family home. Emma and her sisters must marry, fast. If not, they face poverty, spinsterhood, or worse: an eternity with their boorish brother and his awful wife.

Luckily there are plenty of potential suitors to dance with, from flirtatious Tom Musgrave to castle-owning Lord Osborne, who’s as awkward as he is rich.

So far so familiar. But there’s a problem: Jane Austen didn’t finish the story. Who will write Emma’s happy ending now?

Based on her incomplete novel, this sparklingly witty play looks under the bonnet of Jane Austen and asks: what can characters do when their author abandons them?

Directed by Samuel West, this new play runs from 3 November – 1 December in the Minerva Theatre. Aged 16 -25? Get tickets for just £5.

Emma Watson

Played by Grace Moloney

The youngest of the three Watson sisters, and our heroine. She was living with her Aunt until she remarried, then Emma was sent back to the family home to live with her sisters and ill father. She has to find a husband soon as her father cannot provide for her nor her sisters.

‘I would rather be teacher at a school than marry a man I did not like.’

Elizabeth Watson

Played by Paksie Vernon

The eldest Watson sister. She is a full time carer to their father and offers Emma advice on potential suitors.

‘I would rather do anything than be teacher at a school. I think I could like any good humoured man with a comfortable income.’

Margaret Watson

Played by Katherine Rose Morley

The middle Watson sister, who can be a little self-absorbed. She is interested in Tom Musgrave and believes that he is in love with her.

‘There is nothing she would not do to get married.’
