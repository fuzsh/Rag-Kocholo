        "text": "Readers of a nervous disposition should look away now; there’s about to be more 1980s postmodernism.\n\nAs promised, a post with some images of housing at Tegel, with a selection of buildings forming part of the IBA 1984/1987. These are a long way from the regeneration-needy areas of Kreuzberg in southern Berlin where most of the IBA projects lie; Tegel is a much wealthier spot, and these blocks are set on the harbour opening out into the lake. In this part of the IBA the accent was perhaps more show home than urban regeneration.\n\nThe final stage of the original masterplan – buildings on the harbour island – remained on paper. My IBA source book indicates this was to be an Arts, Education and Leisure complex, although there is now new housing going up instead. The Humboldt library building immediately to the east was built though, as well as Gustav Peichl’s phosphate elimination plant across the road. I didn’t get that far mind you, as I was freezing my knackers off, frankly.\n\nDated po-mo? You bet. But strangely… well, you decide.\n\nI was just struck, by the way, by how ‘American Gothic’ the pair of John Hejduk houses look (see the couple of images at the end).\n\nBy the way, it’s generally thought that the best architecture photos are those taken in bright summer sunshine. These were taken at freezing dusk in the middle of winter. It gives them a melancholy air though, don’t you think? And as an added bonus, the landscaping of much of the site reminded me of the snow-bound topiary in Kubrick’s The Shining. Oh dear.\n\nComplete photos set (including some added a few years after this post, and Gustav Peichl’s water treatment plant).\n\nFirstly, the mid-rise ‘courtyard’ blocks by Moore, Ruble, Yudell:\n\nThe Humboldt Library at Tegel, also by Moore, Ruble, Yudell (same architects who just finished the new American Embassy in Berlin, to much thunderous indifference). Closed that day, but interiors are interesting, from the images in the IBA guide:\n\nComing to a waterside area near you, soon:\n\nBelow – Moore, Ruble, Yudell (left) Poly, Steinebach, Weber (centre) plus Robert Stern (right). Quite cold now.\n\nPoly, Steinebach, Weber (detail):\n\nStanley Tigerman. Really very cold by this point:\n\nPaolo Portoghesi:\n\nResidential terrace by Bangert, Jansen, Scholz, Schultes:\n\nAntoine Grumbach (Freezing):\n\nFinally, John Hejduk. See one of his other two IBA projects here. Too cold after this to work the camera, so back to the U-Bahn:\n\nIn London at the moment, with a bit of time to spare. So cunningly, before leaving Berlin, I put a pile of recent images I’d taken onto a disk, in order to edit and upload from here.\n\nA shame then that I left the disk on the table in the flat in Berlin. Arse.\n\nSo instead of a blog about a trip to the IBA buildings at Tegel on a freezing winter evening, or another one about the demolition of a building near me on the Ufer which is being replaced with something ghastly, or an update on ‘Carloft’, just a bit of random wittering.\n\nMy girlfriend uploaded the Tegel pictures she took; here are a couple, to keep you distracted from this post’s lack of real content:\n\nTegel is the north westerly part of Berlin, a quite posh part in fact, and rather beautiful on the day we visited. Tegel (or to be more accurate, the borough of Reinickendorf) seems to be twinned with Greenwich (in southeast London, not New York) which sort of makes sense. The main promenade features London street signs and a red phone box. Curiously, both areas have large scale construction from the eighties – the former being the money-fuelled blandless of Canary Wharf, the latter being the IBA-fuelled madness of postmodernism. More on this when I get home and upload all the images.\n\nWe had no idea that the lake and harbour would be completely frozen, with skaters and assorted winter sports.\n\nWhat else?\n\nOh yes – following my recent rants about the reconstruction of the Schloss (see ‘All Just A Facade’), I came across a good site here, summarising items in the press about it (some in english), and also ‘Kein Schloss in meinem Namen‘ (No Castle in my name) – a petition against it. You put your protest photo in, it’s cool. Not sure if I can add mine, as I’m not german, so it’s not strictly speaking ‘in my name’ at all. I pay taxes to Berlin though (any thoughts, readers?).\n\nI note from the Schloss’s fundraising newspaper that, bizarrely, the apparently-not-dead Henry Kissinger is backing the Schloss scheme and attending fundraising dinners. Judge your enemies by the friends they keep, to misquote a phrase. In fact, it’s like hearing that Albert Speer is still knocking around, and has thrown his weight behind the construction of a new triumphal arch. (Weirdly, Albert Speer’s son, also named Albert Speer, is still around, and is an architect. You’d change your name, wouldn’t you?)\n\nRight, off to look at London things now.\n\nI’ve so far taken a slightly haphazard approach to logging IBA projects (see original IBA post here), but have now begun the legwork of getting as many books as I could carry from the Berlin TU library and collating a database. I’ve made two separate lists, Neubau and Altbau, and will gradually migrate the links and other info from my old post. The separate pages for individual projects will remain and be expanded.\n\n‘Why bother at all?’ you might ask. Simply because\n\na) when I was looking for this information on the web, it wasn’t there, and\n\nb) I’m a nerd, and us nerds are only ever happy when we have a vast list-based project to be getting on with.\n\nThe list will have little on it to begin with, but do get in touch if you’re looking for specific material – I’m probably planning to go there with a camera if I haven’t already…\n\nI started a Flickr group here, should anyone want to add pages. I also came across some images I tool in 2012 of the IBA retrospective exhibition at the TU, here.\n\nBy way of overview, the International Bauaustelling (IBA) 1987 was divided into Neubau (new building) under Josef Paul Kleihues and Altbau (yes, old building) under Hardt-Waltherr Hämer. The nomenclature is not strict however; ‘Altbau’ projects, mainly in the eastern Kreuzberg district known as SO36, have many elements of newbuild, but usually integrated into existing street blocks. ‘Neubau’ generally applies to the larger scale freestanding construction. The Neubau projects were in four geographical areas; Southern Tiergarten/South Friedrichstadt (the vast majority), Prager Platz, and Tegel Harbour. I’ve listed the projects firstly by their ‘Block number’, which I assume was an allocation system of the IBA’s.\n\nBlock 1, between Kothener strasse, Bernberger Strasse and Dessauer Strasse. Perhaps its most notable building is O M Ungers contribution, which I’ve written a bit about here.\n\nThe block also includes designs by Hans C Müller and Moritz Müller, also on Dessauer Strasse.\n\nBlock 2, on Dessauer Srasse 34-40, Stresemannstrasse 105-109, Bernberger Strasse 6-9. Most notable for Zaha Hadid’s residential building on Dessauer Strasse, page here.\n\nBlock 3, on Wilhelmstrasse. This is actually the Topography of Terror site, and must have become part of the IBA simply because its design competition was concurrent. The competition scheme in question was not the current one, or even its aborted-during-construction Peter Zumthor predecessor, but a ‘grid of trees’ design by Wenzel, Lang.\n\nBlock 4, bounded by Kochstrasse, Wilhelmstrasse, Zimmerstrasse and Friedrichstrasse. It includes Rem Koolhaas/OMA’s block on Friedrichstrasse (see pages here and here) and, in my opinion, the most impressive enclosed courtyard of the whole Neubau programme (see page here), and which includes some good work by Catalan architects MBM (see 2nd image below).\n\nThe OMA block was greatly altered since writing the originally post, alterations covered here.\n\nBlock 5 – a corner block on Kochstrasse 59 / Charlottenstrasse 83, by Hans Kammerer and Walter Kucher, blogged here. The block also includes Peter Eisenmann’s Haus am Checkpoint Charlie, covered here.\n\nBlock 6, bounded by Dessauer Strasse and Bernberger Strasse. Notable because of its unusual biological water waste disposal system – some images and comments here.\n\nBlock 9, on Wilhelmstrasse, notable for two quite prominent residential towers. Don’t get too excited. Some images here.\n\nBlock 10 – Kochstrasse 1-5, Wilhemstrasse 39. Includes the prominent corner block by Aldo Rossi, with Jay Johnson, Gianni Braghieri, Christpher Stead. I don’t seem to have posted on this, just an image on my general IBA 87 post, so here it is again:\n\nBlock 11 – Charlottenstrasse 96-98, by John Hedjuk. A tower and two separate wings, oft photographed as one of Berlin’s architectural oddities. My original, rather lukewarm post here. Subsequently, my interest in the building triggered a campaign to save it from some major alterations, the campaign ran on this and other blogs, eventually reaching the press – first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and finally, success!\n\nBlock 24. A lesser known incorporation of some earlier buildings as the “Alte Feuerwache” (old fire station).\n\nBlocks 28 & 31, known as ‘Ritterstrasse North’. Planned by, and including buildings by, Rob Krier. Post here, in which I may have confused things by indicating that ‘Ritterstrasse South’ is something separate from Block 33 (see below). Am now not sure, but it doesn’t really matter – have a wander round the whole area, as it’s interesting, and also you could make a field trip of the whole area, taking in the Jewish Museum itself, as well as Hermann Hertzberger’s Block 30 on the other side of Lindenstrasse, and Erich Mendelsohn’s I G Metall (Metalworkers union building) to the south.\n\nBlock 33 – Residential Park ‘Am Berlin Museum’. This is the southern end of a complex next to the Jewish Museum, between Lindenstrasse (15-19) and Alte Jakobstrasse (129-136). See post here.\n\nBlock 189 – Known as ‘Rauchstrasse’, bounded by Thomas-Dehler-Strasse, Drakestrasse, Stulerstrsse and Rauchstrasse. Masterplan of whole block by Rob Krier. Separate page here for this.\n\nThomas Dehler Str. 47, Aldo Rossi\n\nThomas Dehler Str. 46, Henry Nielebock & Partner\n\nThomas Dehler Str. 44, Giorgio Grassi\n\nThomas Dehler Str. 39 / Rauchstrasse 14, Rob Krier (this is the ‘master block’, facing onto Stulerstr)\n\nRauchstrasse 6, Hubert Herrmann\n\nRauchstrasse 8, Hans Hollein\n\nRauchstrasse 10, Rob Krier\n\nRauchstraase 11 – Refurbishmnent of the old Norweigen Embassy, architects: Freie Planungsgruppe Berlin GmbH / R.Weichmayr\n\nLandscape architecture, Cornelia Muller, Jan Wehberg, Elmar Knippschild\n\nBlock 192 – Rauchstrasse 21 and Corneliusstrasse 11/12 A less written-about IBA project comprising three ‘eco-houses’, by teams led by Frei Otto. Essentially open concrete frames where elements could be added, including gardens, at different floor levels. At least this was the design idea in the catalogue at the time – the realised buildings appear more substantial. Some related material here.\n\nBlocks 197 & 198 – The Japanese & Italian Embassies During the Cold War years, the Embassy district lay largely abandoned, falling as it did in West Berlin, which was no longer the capital city. The Italian Embassy was reworked as a cultural centre by Paolo Portoghesi. Nowadays of course, it’s the Italian Embassy again.\n\nBlock 204 – the ‘Wissenschaftszentrum’ (Science centre) by James Stirling and Michael Wilford The project greatly extended an existing building on Reichpietschufer.\n\nBlock 220 – on the western side of Lützowplatz, by O M Ungers My post about this building here. Post blog note: as at July 2009, the front block (pictured) remains, only the rear blocks demolished. 2nd note, March 2013, completely demolished.\n\nBlocks 227 & 228 – Housing “Am Karlsbad”, Potsdamer Strasse 41-49, Bissingzeile 1-3, Am Karlsbad 1. By Jürgen Sawade, Hilmer & Sattler, and others. These buildings don’t do much for me, to be honest, and I’ve whinged about them in a post here. It’s the bit at the end.\n\nBlock 234 – a huge area with one side facing onto Lützowplatz. This includes a corner building on Lützowplatz by Mario Botta, with some flats by Peter Cook & Christine Hawley (he of Archigram fame) next door. A whole page, of stuff here, including Max & Karl Dudler’s rather fabulous electricity transformer station at Lützowstrasse 18.\n\n(thanks to IsarSteve from whom I’ve linked a Flickr image here).\n\nNext… Sites along the south side of the canal, including a footbridge by Brenner & Tonon, and on the south side of the river, and a row of four fascinating townhouses, by Schiedhelm, Klipper & Partner; Pysall, Jensen & Stahrenberg; von Gerkan, Marg & Partner, and the fourth which I seem to have forgotten to name.\n\nBlock 608 – Family Court Building by O.M. Ungers, Hallesches Ufer 66-62. My post here.\n\nBlock 622 – The Jewish Museum. Not sure to what extent the IBA claimed this as under its jurisdiction, as not relly a part of the programme as such, and is an extension of what was originally the Berlin Museum.\n\nBlock 647 – on the north side of Lützowstrasse from Block 234. Includes an interesting child daycare centre and apartments and individual houses arranged in a rare (for Berlin) mews plan. Pages here and a less interesting bit at the end of this post.\n\nPrager Platz – The recreation of a square and surrounding buildings, mainly by Rob Krier, written about here.\n\nTegeler Hafen – There was also a fairly major development out at Tegel, built around the harbour, which I’ve blogged about here, with work including all sorts of Charles Moore scary stuff, as well as another of the three John Hejduk projects that are a part of the IBA, the “House for two brothers” (below).\n\nA more recent post also, visiting Gustav Peichl’s phosphate treatment plant at the same location. Much more exciting than that sounds."
