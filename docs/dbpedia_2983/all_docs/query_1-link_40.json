        "text": "Tegels Park\n\nLocated on Cottonwood Lake. Six acres. No admission charge.\n\nLocated on the east edge of Windom and the west shore of Cottonwood Lake, Tegels Park includes two picnic shelter, three sand volleyball courts, one boat ramp and two docks for fishing and boating. Open in the spring of 2008 is our new $40,000 Burke playground structure designed for younger kids. Donations were received by the local Eagles Club Auxiliary and the Windom Lion’s Club.\n\nIn 1997, a cooperative effort of the Game and Fish League, DNR and the city resulted in new boat ramps and blacktop near the landing. Handicapped restrooms are near the shelter house."
