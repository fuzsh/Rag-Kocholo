        "text": "Berlin is known as one of the great capitals of Europe and is visited by millions of people every year. The city is bursting with energy and there is a mix of well-known sights and green oases to admire. In our opinion, however, the insider tip for those seeking relaxation is Berlin's many lakes. Did you know that around 6.5 percent of Berlin's urban area is water?\n\nSo why not get to know this beautiful city from a different angle and walk around Berlin's ten largest lakes? Take part in the Iron Lake Challenge Berlin and get the coveted collector's medal of the Iron Lake Challenge in the \"Berlin\" edition.\n\nRULES\n\nThe rules for the Iron Lake Challenge \"Berlin\" are very simple. Nevertheless, we would like to clarify them once again at this point:\n\nSign up for the Iron Lake Challenge Berlin!\n\nTo conquer the Iron Lake Challenge Berlin and earn the beautiful collector's medal, you have to walk around the ten largest lakes in Berlin (see below) after registering.\n\nBicycles, skates, etc. are not allowed, but you are welcome to hike or run.\n\nEach lake must be circumnavigated \"in one piece\". This means that you are welcome to take breaks, but you should complete the lake within one day. Of course, you can divide the 10 lakes into different days. Do only one lake per day, because you want to enjoy this time!\n\nWe trust you that you have really circumnavigated the lakes. However, if you want to be included in the honor roll, we need a copy of your tracking. We don't care what you use (watch, smartphone or app).\n\nGeneral PLEASE NOTE!\n\nPlease note that the road traffic regulations apply in public traffic areas and along roads and cycle paths. So move with consideration.\n\nYou circumnavigate the lakes at your own risk and at your own risk. The operator of this website assumes no liability.\n\nPlease heed medical advice if necessary or have a medical examination before the start of the Challenge. You are responsible for your own health, equipment and condition. Breaking off a tour is not a disgrace, health always comes first!\n\nA few rules for dealing with nature during your lake tour:\n\nPlease take into account the local instructions for the protection of nature.\n\nPlease do not go off the trails.\n\nPlease do not make noise.\n\nPlease do not collect rocks or minerals.\n\nPlease do not collect mushrooms.\n\nPlease do not leave trash lying around.\n\nPlease do not feed animals.\n\nPlease do not make an open fire.\n\nPlease do not pick plants.\n\nThis should be obvious to all of us, but it doesn't hurt to remember it from time to time.\n\nREGISTRATION AND SCOPE OF SERVICES\n\nRegistration for the Iron Lake Challenge Berlin costs you 24,- EUR.\n\nIn this entry fee is our Iron Lake Challenge \"Berlin\" collector's medal and the Iron Lake Challenge coin (30mm) of the Timeless Challenge .\n\nHowever, you first have to circumnavigate the ten largest lakes in this beautiful federal state! Only then we will send you the well-deserved medal and coin! After all, you want to earn them, not receive them as a gift.\n\nWith your registration fee you support my heart project of the Reforestation of one million trees worldwide!\n\nHow to register:\n\nPlease click on the logo and you will be redirected to the registration page of our partner Digistore24\n\nYou will now receive a registration confirmation\n\nNow you have to walk around the ten largest lakes in the federal state of Berlin. As soon as you have completed the ten lakes, please upload an excerpt of your tracking to our tool as proof.\n\nAfter we have checked the evidence, you will receive your well-deserved medal and marble. Easy, isn't it?\n\nYOUR MEDAL AND YOUR COIN\n\nIf you have circumnavigated the ten largest lakes in Berlin on foot, then you have earned the beautiful Iron Lake Challenge \"Berlin Edition\" medal. This can be the first in your upcoming collection from the Iron Lake Challenge, or add to your existing collection.\n\nLIFE SCORE POINTS AND THE TIMELESS COIN\n\nThe Iron Lake Challenge is part of our Timeless Challenge. That's why you also deserve (in addition to the collector's medal) the Timeless Coin in the \"Iron Lake Challenge\" edition. This will also be sent to you. It has a diameter of 30mm.\n\nYou earn with your performance ca. 12 Life Score Points. These will be credited to both the Berlin Roll of Honor and the Life Lake Museum.\n\nThe ten largest lakes in Berlin\n\nWe were surprised at how many large lakes Berlin has. Of course, the large lakes are often widened areas where rivers flow very slowly, but the capital of Germany is blessed with many lakes. Unfortunately, some cannot be circumnavigated, or only with very long detours, and half of Nieder Neuendorfer See belongs to Brandenburg, as do Griebnitzsee, Dämeritzsee and various others. Nevertheless, the remaining list of Berlin lakes is quite impressive and you can look forward to many great and varied kilometers along the shores.\n\nLarge Müggelsee\n\nLocated in the east of Berlin, the \"Großer Müggelsee\" is the largest lake in Berlin and is very well known. What the Wannsee is to West Berlin, the Großer Müggelsee is to East Berlin. The lake is a popular destination for families with children, especially in summer, thanks to its three bathing spots. But the Großer Müggelsee also offers hikers, runners and cyclists great lakeside paths and a wonderful view. The circuit around the large Müggelsee is around 20 kilometers long (depending on the chosen tour) and there is a lot to discover.\n\nTour recommendations for circumnavigating the Großer Müggelsee\n\nKomoot – Einmal um den großen Müggelsee\n\nRübezahl am Müggelsee – Umrundung\n\nTegeler See\n\nLocated in Reinickendorf, Tegeler See is the second largest lake in Berlin and is home to nine islands. A walk around the lake offers you a variety of impressions and culinary delights. Small cafés and restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the recreational area invite you to enjoy a refreshment or a cozy coffee. For families, there are playgrounds, park benches with a view of the water and a mini golf course to the north of the lake. The circumnavigation of Lake Tegel on foot is around 20 kilometers long.\n\nTour recommendations for circumnavigating Lake Tegel:\n\nKomoot – Umrundung des Tegeler See\n\nKomoot – Hafenrunde Tegeler See\n\nGroßer Wannsee\n\nThe famous \"Wannsee\" is actually a bay of the Havel. It is located in West Berlin and is a source of relaxation and beautiful moments for water sports enthusiasts as well as runners and hikers. Circumnavigating the large Wannsee on foot is a challenge, as up to 60 kilometers (depending on the tour you choose) await you. However, you have two days to complete it.\n\nTour recommendations for circumnavigating the large Wannsee:\n\nBikemap – Umrundung des großen Wannsees\n\nOutdoor Active – Umrundung des großen Wannsees\n\nTour von BrickBrian – Vielen Dank\n\nSeddinsee\n\nLake Seddin is surrounded by extensive woodland and is a dream for walkers and runners. However, it is most popular with water sports enthusiasts, as its entire surface is open to sailing, rowing and swimming. Parts of its shore are a nature reserve. It is only possible to circumnavigate Lake Seddin if you take the ferry at one point. But that shouldn't be a problem given the frequent intervals between trips. The ferry takes you around the lake in about 17 kilometers.\n\nTour recommendation for circumnavigating the Seddinsee (own research)\n\nKomoot – Tour von BrickBrian – Vielen Dank!\n\nLanger See\n\nThe Langer See is actually a widening of the Dahme, which begins north of Schmöckwitz and stretches as far as the old town of Köpenick. It flows very slowly in the Langer See area, giving the impression that it is a stagnant inland lake. It is also only possible to circumnavigate the Langer See by ferry, but this gives it a special charm. This means that the circumnavigation on foot is just under 17 kilometers.\n\nTour recommendation for circumnavigating the Langer See (Dahme)\n\nKomoot – Umrundung Langer See – Fähre 12\n\nKrumme Lanke\n\nEven if the Krumme Lanke is not particularly large, you will have a good time on the shores of this lake, because on the one hand there is an approx. 2.8 km long circular path around the lake, and on the other hand the landscape is simply beautiful and peaceful.\n\nTour recommendation for the circumnavigation of the Krumme Lanke:\n\nWanderwegtester – Umrundung der Krummen Lanke\n\nTour Von BrickBrian – Vielen Dank dafür\n\nKaulsdorfer Seen\n\nThe Kaulsdorf lakes actually consist of three lakes (Habermannsee, Butzer See and Elsersee). They are located in a wonderful recreational area and it makes sense to walk around them together. You will cover around 6 kilometers on foot.\n\nTour recommendations for the tour around the Kaulsdorf lakes:\n\nAlltrails – Umrundung der Kaulsdorfer Seen\n\nKomoot – Tour von BrickBrian – Vielen Dank dafür!\n\nHeiligensee\n\nHeiligensee is located in the Reinickendorf district of the same name and forms the center of the nature reserve of the same name. Motorboats are prohibited here, which is very conducive to tranquillity. Hikers will find a lakeside bathing area, a restaurant, fishing spots and a campsite here. The circular route around Heiligensee is approx. 6 kilometers long (depending on the tour chosen).\n\nTour recommendations for circumnavigating the Heiligensee:\n\nKomoot – Umrundung Heiligensee\n\nGPS Wanderatlas – Rundwanderung Heiligensee\n\nSchlachtensee\n\nSchlachtensee is located between Krumme Lanke and Wannsee, in the south-west of Berlin. The lake is very popular with anglers, swimmers and hikers and on the eastern shore you can refresh yourself in the historic \"Fischerhütte\" inn. The circular route around the Schlachtensee is almost 6 kilometers long.\n\nTour recommendations for circumnavigating the Schlachtensee:\n\nWanderwegtester: Umrundung des Schlachtensees\n\nKomoot – Umrundung Schlachtensee\n\nGrunewaldsee\n\nThe Grunewaldsee is the smallest lake in our list, as one circuit is only just under 3 kilometers long. It is located in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf and is part of the Grunewald chain of lakes. As you walk around the lake, you will pass the famous and oldest palace in Berlin, the Grunewald hunting lodge. It is well worth a visit! As you can see, despite its small size, a walk around the area is well worthwhile.\n\nTour recommendations for walking around the Grunewaldsee:\n\nAlltrails – Umrundung des Grunewaldsees\n\nKomoot – Große Wanderung um den Grunewaldsee\n\nTHE IRON LAKE CHALLENGE IN SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nWe would be happy if you share pictures, videos and your experiences around the Iron Lake Challenge with others. For this purpose we provide you with the following hashtags:\n\n#ironlakechallenge\n\n#ironlakechallengeberlin\n\n#timelesschallenge\n\nOf course we also invite you to join our Facebook group \"Iron Lake Challenge Discussion Board\".\n\nIRON LAKE CHALLENGE BERLIN HONOR ROLL\n\nHere you can quickly and easily enter your results and upload the evidence (e.g. screen copy of your tracking). We check them and then release them. Then your result is saved and appears in the honor roll. Be proud of what you have already achieved!\n\nInstructions for the Challenge Tool\n\nThis is how our honor board works\n\nRegister on our site\n\nSelect the lake you are circling under \"Lake\"\n\nEnter the distance you have covered (in meters) under \"Length (in m)\"\n\nEnter the required time (in minutes) under \"Time needed (in min).\n\nEnter the date of your circumnavigation under \"date\"\n\nNow you can upload the evidence (e.g. a screenshot of your tracking) under \"Upload proof (optional)\"\n\nNow all you have to do is SAVE!\n\nWe check your round and release it. Then you will see your result in the ranking.\n\nChallenge:\n\nDID YOU ENJOY THIS IRON LAKE CHALLENGE? THEN WE RECOMMEND YOU\n\nThe Iron Lake Challenge is more than just a one-off adventure. For many people, it is a part of their lives and an opportunity to get to know the world and experience unforgettable moments. However, it is only one part of our diverse Timeless Challenge. That's why we recommend the other Iron Lake Challenges and a consistent challenge for runners and cyclists 🙂\n\nIMPRINT"
