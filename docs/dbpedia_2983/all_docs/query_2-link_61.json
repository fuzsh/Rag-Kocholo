        "text": "There are many cycling tours in Berlin and if you get on a bike, you will experience a green miracle! Around the federal capital there are the most beautiful cycling tours through nature and history at the same time. We have selected ten special routes and destinations - from the Berlin Wall to Lake Tegel and the Havel.\n\nWall Cycle Route: Henningsdorf to Hermsdorf stage\n\nAt around 16 kilometres in length, this section of the Berlin Wall Trail, which is around 160 kilometres long in total, is aleisurely tour through the beautiful landscape of the Havel and the former border region. A historical feature is the last border crossing in Stolpe, which was opened shortly before the fall of the Wall.\n\nThe route continues along the Tegeler Forst forest to Hohen Neuendorf. Here it is definitely worth making a detour to the Länderinstitut für Bienenkunde - informative and definitely delicious. In the course of the remaining six kilometres to Hermsdorf, you pass a still preserved former border tower, which is now used by the German Forest Youth for nature conservation work. The route around Lake Hubertus and through the densely wooded landscape makes this tour an eventful and relaxing short detour .\n\nWall Cycle Route: Sonnenallee to Lichtenrade stage\n\nThis historic bicycle tour on the traces of the former Berlin Wall and the inner-German border leads along the route from the former Sonnenallee border crossing to Lichtenrade. A stop at the double row of cobblestones on Sonnenallee and a look at the information board shows how large the crowds were here in 1972 when the crossing point was opened.\n\nThe tour continues along the green edge of the city via Schönefeld to Lichtenrade through the unspoilt south of the city with views over the meadows. On the way, it is worth stopping at the famous Hufeisensiedlung, which has been a Unesco World Heritage Site since 2008. The streets with one- to three-storey terraced houses run radially towards the horseshoe-shaped housing complex in the centre.\n\nThe tour continues by bike along the former \"column roads\" of the GDR's National People's Army. The old whip street lamps next to the asphalt paths speak volumes and silently tell history. The village of Lichtenrade with its floodplain is a beautiful end to the tour.\n\nCycle tour: From Berlin to Wannsee\n\nOut of the city and through the city centre at the same time - that best describes the 28-kilometre route by bike to Wannsee. Starting at Schlossplatz, the tour connects East Berlin and West Berlin in a charming way all the way to the beautiful park and lake landscape in Brandenburg at the gates of Potsdam. The famous Checkpoint Charlie, a historic site in German history, is just as much an eye-catcher as the more leisurely part of the route through Volkspark Schöneberg to Domäne Dahlem.\n\nCattle, meadows, sheep, an old manor with a farm shop - the cycle path to Wannsee is picturesque. The subsequent view from the Wannsee Bridge over the Kleine and Großer Wannsee lakes and the many sailboats already indicates that the bicycle tour is coming to an end. The Glienicke Bridge is not only a symbol of German division, but also a great vantage point for viewing five different castles.\n\nBicycle tour through Reinickendorf\n\nThe start of this bike tour is steeped in history and begins at the Borsigwerke underground station. Here you can see the imposing brick gate of the former Borsigwerke - once the second largest locomotive manufacturer in the world. Immediately afterwards is Lake Tegel with its beautiful Greenwich promenade. If you like, you can interrupt the tour here for a trip on the excursion boat across the Havel and Wannsee to the government district.\n\nBut after returning to the pier and your bike, you should definitely not miss the \"Dicke Marie\". At an estimated 800 years old, the English oak at Tegel Palace is the oldest tree in Berlin. The tour continues along the lakeshore through Tegeler Forst and finally to Tegelort Ufer. Here you can cross by ferry and return along the shore to the Borsigwerke underground station.\n\nGrunewald Tour: Cycling through the greenery\n\nThe approximately 30-kilometre-long bicycle tour is something for nature lovers and pedalers. The route is not always developed and sometimes leads over loose ground. Nevertheless, the bike tour through the forest and along the water is worthwhile. Right after the start at the Konstanzer Straße underground station, the view of the picturesque Koenigsee rewards the journey.\n\nIt continues monarchically along the beautifully wooded Kronprinzessinnenweg to the first stop and note: don't forget your swimming trunks. The Großes Fenster/Havelhöhenweg bathing area is definitely worth a belly flop.\n\nPast Wannsee and Havelstrand, the Havel Heights Trail leads to a visual history highlight: the Grunewald Tower. The brick tower, built in 1897, offers a great view over the landscape from the viewing platform at a height of 36 metres - for the price of five euros. Leisurely through the forest and along the water, the route takes you along the Gravelweg back to the Konstanzer Straße underground station.\n\nSpreeradweg: Cycling through Berlin\n\nThe Spree Cycle Path leads once through the city. Starting in Treptow Harbour, the route offers around 27 kilometres along the river and many beautiful insights into the city of Berlin, its highlights and its history. Just past the motor ship Hoppetosse - which as a restaurant ship is guaranteed to be worth a stop - you are already in Kreuzberg.\n\nHere, on Mühlenstraße, is the largest remaining piece of the Berlin Wall, also known as the Eastside Gallery. 118 artists from 21 countries have left political artworks here. Partly with a lot of road traffic and not directly along the Spree, the route continues to the Reichstag embankment with a view of the Reichstag building. Here, on Ludwig-Erhard-Ufer with a view of Berlin's main railway station, it is worth taking a break with a drink in one of the cafés.\n\nA lot of nature then awaits you at the Großer Tiergarten, the city park with the famous Victory Column in the middle. Finally, the route leads through the Moabit district to the picturesque Belvedere Palace Gardens. Through the colourful little city gardens on the way to Spandau S-Bahn station, the route ends with a beautiful picture and also the Spree: it flows into the Havel here.\n\nHavelradweg: Tour from Spandau to Kladow\n\nWith a length of 371 kilometres, the Havel Cycle Path is an impressive and exciting long-distance cycle path. The route along the entire river from its source in Ankershagen in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to its confluence with the Elbe at Havelsberg is worth a tour, and the section in Berlin even more so. The cycle path here leads from the old town in Spandau and along the banks of the river Linden via Wilhelmstadt and on to Kladow to the ferry terminal.\n\nThe 20-kilometre-long cycle tour is characterised by relaxed cycling along the water and comfortable paths. A stroll through the old town of Spandau - which, according to the town charter, is five years older than Berlin - is just as recommended as a dip in the water at the Bürgerablage bathing area on the Havel.\n\nIf you get hungry, you can look forward to a delicious rest at the Neukladow manor house or the Spandau hunting lodge. The Kladow ferry terminal closes the route with a nice short boat trip if you wish. Return and take the same leisurely route back home.\n\nTegel Lake Circuit: Always along the water\n\nWith a length of about 20 kilometres and many nice stops along the way, the cycle path around Lake Tegel is a perfect tour for the whole family. Even the start at the Greenwichpromenade in Berlin-Tegel with a view of the many small boats stands as a prelude to the leisurely round.\n\nWhen you stop at Tegel Palace, it's worth meeting \"Dicke Marie\" (Fat Marie) - which is not an obese artist, but an oak tree that is a good 800 years old and thus estimated to be the oldest tree in Berlin . The Humboldt brothers are said to have named the tree after their cook - who probably often had a bite to eat. Next to the Tegel lido, you can cool off at the \"Arbeiterstrand\" bathing area.\n\nAfter the short ferry ride to Hakenfelde in Spandau, it is worth taking a detour to Eiswerder Island with the Spandau Citadel. From there, it's a leisurely ride back to Greenwichpromenade. If you feel too warm after pedalling, you can jump into the water again at the Saatwinkel bathing area .\n\nTiergarten Cycle Tour: Through the City and to the Victory Column\n\nSmall, but a - that's the Tiergarten cycle circuit. The 12-kilometre route offers city history and nature at the same time. It begins with the start in Budapester Straße right next to Berlin Zoo.\n\nVia Hofjägeralle you will arrive at the Großer Tiergarten. The famous Berlin city park enchants with its size and natural layout. In the middle stands the 67-metre-high Victory Column as Berlin's landmark - always worth a photo. If you walk around the star-shaped square of the Victory Column, you will reach the Platz der Republik and the Reichstag building via John-Foster-Doules-Allee. Here it's worth climbing up to Käfer's roof garden restaurant for a great view over Berlin.\n\nFriedrichstraße, Unter den Linden, Brandenburg Gate - on the rest of the route you have all the highlights of Berlin in one go, until you return to Tiergartenstraße and here ride along Thomas-Dehler-Straße to Café am Neuen See - as a cosy restaurant with a beer garden, the perfect way to end the Tiergarten cycle tour.\n\nCycling tour through Treptow-Köpenick\n\nSporty, exciting and suitable for families - that's the bike tour through Treptow-Köpenick.48 kilometres long, the route is not a huge feat , but it is still recommended because of the variety. Already after the start at Treptower Park, the rose garden with more than a hundred types of roses is the first eye-catcher - and smeller, of course.\n\nPast the Russian memorial comes the Archenhold Observatory. It is the oldest observatory in Germany and, with a focal length of 21 metres, has the longest movable refracting telescope in the world. A visit to the planetarium is a must. The Karlshorst harness racing track is something for horse fans, and right after that in Wuhlheide the leisure and recreation centre beckons with a museum, swimming and sports hall, museum and playgrounds. From here the tour leads to the old town of Köpenick and thus to two famous buildings: the Köpenick town hall and the Köpenick moated castle.\n\nCycling is fun. And the best thing about it is that the most attractive routes are often right on your doorstep. There are many wonderful routes to discover around Hamburg. We present the best cycling tours in and around the Hanseatic city on the Elbe.\n\nOn the Müggelschlößchenweg you come to Müggelsee and here to a nice stopover: the Spreearche, a floating restaurant that you reach by mini ferry. Passing the Friedrichshagen lido, you reach the Friedrichshagen S-Bahn station and can end the tour here."
