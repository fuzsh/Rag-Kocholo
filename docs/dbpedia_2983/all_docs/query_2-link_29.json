        "text": "Last week I decided to visit another former village, Tegel. Before going to bed, I checked the sunrize time. 04:48. Well, I set the alarm for four in the morning, hoping to defeat the laziness of waking up so early. As you might‚Äôve guessed, it somehow worked out.\n\nI jumped out of the metro station and headed to Tegel Lake; the bank was completely empty. Greenwich Promenade is always crowded, especially on weekends. Adults drink beer and children feed ducks and swans, although it‚Äôs prohibited, and there are warning tables every 10 meters.\n\nIt was a perfect time to check a signature pedestrian bridge. It was built in 1908 and is over 90 meters long. Owing to the red paint, it looks fiery in the sunlight ‚Äî like a heated oven. Look how the bridge contrasts with a cold early-morning scenery.\n\nI had heard about the bridge before I went to explore Tegel, but unexpected details always amaze me more. Just look at this sad water dragon in the old part of the district. He must have just read something by Kurt Vonnegut. I don‚Äôt know about you, folks, but this is the cutest facial expression of a dragon figure I‚Äôve ever seen.\n\nWe‚Äôll turn back to old houses soon, but for now, let‚Äôs talk about something not so ancient. I‚Äôm just a humble architecture enthusiast, but the following complex of buildings immediately drew my attention ‚Äî I literally felt it had some design value. Look at these squarish shapes and pale-turquoise frames imitating oxidized copper. Art deco? Hmm‚Ä¶\n\nWhen I was back home, I figured out my admiration had a reason. These houses ‚Äî blocks of flats and villas ‚Äî were part of the architectural exhibition IBA Neubau 1987. They were constructed together with a dozen other postmodern buildings in different districts of Berlin. (Sounds like a great idea for my next article, doesn‚Äôt it?)\n\nAmong the four IBA ‚Äô87 villas, I find this one the weirdest and most noteworthy. It‚Äôs white with green accents ‚Äî window frames, doors, and an original ‚Äúwatchtower‚Äù between the house parts.\n\nAnd I have no idea about the purpose of those rectangular metal ‚Äúchimneys,‚Äù but they look wonderful and add to the overall impression.\n\nAs I was passing by the postmodernist exhibition settlement, at some point, I ran into the lovely embankment featuring a North Pacific whale ‚Äî I quickly recognized its silhouette because had read a lot of encyclopedias on biology in childhood. Ah, I wish my balcony was as close to a lake or river as the ones in the background of the photo.\n\nOh, and there is one more remarkable structure from the IBA ‚Äô87 exhibition, the Humboldt library. To me, it‚Äôs an eclectic mix of industrial aesthetics with almost invisible classicist elements. Doesn‚Äôt it resemble a steam train or a vintage railway station?\n\nOkay, enough postmodernism for today. What about something older? It was a pleasant surprise to discover an old mill ‚Äî currently one of the facilities of the medical park Humboltm√ºlle.\n\nThe first mention of a mill on this site, at the mouth of the river Flie√ü, dates back to the 14th century. Until the 1810s, it was one of the largest water mills in the region and a bit later converted into a steam mill. The current building, more than a century old, was reconstructed in the 1990s and adorned a contemporary architectural ensemble.\n\nBut you can find not just old buildings in Tegel ‚Äî it also houses the oldest tree in Berlin, the so-called Chubby Mary (Dicke Marie). This is a natural monument, although the tree didn‚Äôt look quite healthy at first glance.\n\nIt‚Äôs believed this English oak was born from a seed in 1107, which means it‚Äôs over 900 years old ‚Äî older than the city of Berlin! Sadly, there are some clues to its roughly twice exaggerated age. There are not many 9‚Äì8-century old trees in Germany, and all of them are way thicker and have darker bark. But even if it started growing in the middle of the 17th century, it‚Äôs a respectable old oak anyway.\n\nThe tree received its name, Chubby Marie, after the cook of brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt. They spent their youth not far from this site, in a grand white manor, Tegel Castle. Another famous guy, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, visited the tree during his travels in 1778 and was relaxing in its shade. I‚Äôm a bit skeptical about such facts. Not a single huge tree can exist without someone famous to have visited it.\n\nAlready tired of history? I‚Äôve got a dose of relaxation. On the square with cannons, Kanonenplatz, you can enjoy lying on a wooden sunbed and gaze at numerous water birds: ducks, geese, and swans.\n\nI could recline on the sunbed for hours sipping refreshingly sour white wine. It was windy and sunny at the same time that day. How clever of me it was to toss a sweatshirt into the backpack! But curiosity forced me to stand up after half an hour of relaxation and explore further.\n\nA wooden church used to stand in the village center from the 13th century; in the 18th century, it was replaced with a baroque one. And the current neo-romanesque church was built in 1911, just a century ago.\n\nWhat I like even more than well-groomed historical sites is how people decorate and look after ordinary houses. The photo below is a confluence of such naive details: red ‚ÄúBierst√ºb‚Äôl‚Äù sign, graffiti with the district scenery, and colorful ground floor with paint patches, and plates of different designs with the same house number‚Ä¶\n\nAnd the icing on a cake ‚Äî this peach house with a stepped roof, which seemed to be a cafe. I just couldn‚Äôt pass it by without a single photo.\n\nTegel is not very large; however, you can walk several kilometers back and forth and around to examine all its beauty.\n\nI only didn‚Äôt like staying here in the evening on the weekend: everyone was out, chatting and drinking. Not surprisingly, because Greenwich Promenade is a great place to watch the sunset. The lake surface mirrors the clouds, and the sun hides behind the trees on the other side.\n\nBut an even better place for watching the sunset is Borsigdamm, near a residential area. I was lucky enough to catch the moment when the warm rays of the setting sun illuminated a gorgeous bird mural.\n\nFinally, I managed to take a couple of lake surface shots risking getting my shoes wet and sinking my camera ‚Äî but I dodged a bullet."
