        "text": "It’s no secret that we love to travel and are often exploring the world. Just now we’ve planned another two trips for the rest of the year – and I can’t wait for it! Yet, there is this one place where we are happy to come back to again and again. Berlin and especially Alt-Tegel.\n\nEspecially after a long journey, things are often quite similar: First one evening on the couch, relaxing and arriving back home. But the very next day we often go out and have a look at “our” Lake Tegel. A wonderful constant which will be here forever, whenever we come back to Berlin.\n\nLake Tegel, located in the northern part of Berlin, is the second-largest lake in the city. It covers an area of about 4.6 square kilometres and has a maximum depth of 24 meters. It’s a popular destination for swimming, boating, and fishing in the summer. For us, it’s a perfect place for a long walk and maybe to grab some dinner. The lake has several restaurants and cafes located around its shoreline, offering a variety of dining options."
