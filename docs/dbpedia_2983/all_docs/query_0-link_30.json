These exposed outliers are physically separated from West Berlin by East German territory. They are significant mainly because they provide the USSR with a ready means of testing Western resolve. Their status is uncertain be- cause of the failure of the Allies to establish definite city boundaries at the conclusion of World War II. From time to time the Soviets and the East Germans have chal- lenged the legality of Western claims to certain of these areas and the right of exclave property owners and resi- dents to transit intervening East German territory. Al- though the controversy has been dormant in recent years, it could be revived should the USSR deem such a course advantageous. I. Origins The origins of individual exclaves are obscure. They may be traced to the subdivision of villages and rural estates before World War I, as the fragmentation of land and administrative areas is an ancient feature of German rural settlement. Their continuation to the present is a consequence of the agreements that established Allied ocu- pation areas and responsibilities at the end of World War II -- the Protocol signed in London on 12 September 1944 and the subsequent amendment to that agreement of 26 July 1945. According to these agreements \"Greater Berlin\" was designated a special area to be occupied jointly by the signatory nations -- the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the USSR. The city was specified to be the territory identified as \"Greater Berlin\" in the Prussian Law on the Formation of the New Municipal Community of 27 April 1920. It was further stipulated that Bezirke boundaries within \"Greater Berlin\" were to be those es- tablished by the 27 March 1938 decree published in the Amtsblatt der Reichshauptstadt Berlin. * This report was produced solely by CIA. It was pre- pared by the Office of Basic Intelligence and coordinated with the Offices of Current Intelligence and National Estimates. Approved for Release: 2017/11/01 CO2989061 Approved for Release: 2017/11/01 CO2989061 Problems regarding the legal status of exclaves arise from the failure of either the 1920 law or the 1938 decree to describe adequately the boundaries of \"Greater Berlin\" and its constituent communities. \"Greater Berlin\" was cre- ated by the union of 94 formerly independent administrative areas, ranging from large urban settlements to small vil- lages and rural estates. Some of the areas incorporated apparently were fragmented into sections before 1920, and the law of that year did not stipulate their precise exter- nal boundaries. While the 1938 decree described the inter- nal boundaries of the Berlin Bezirke, it also failed to establish the exterior limits of the city. The continuing uncertainty about exclave status reflects the ambiguity of these documents. II. General Characteristics (See Table following page 5) Even the number of exclaves is a matter on which there is no general agreement. West Berlin claims there are 11, but some of these are not shown on most West German city plans because of their minuteness or distance from the city (see Map 55704); most East German and Soviet maps acknowledge the existence of only 6 or 7. West Berlin maintains that a 12th area, known as the Eiskeller (Teu- felsbruch), is not an exclave. Five of the exclaves claim- ed by West Berlin are grouped administratively with Bezirk Zehlendorf and six with Bezirk Spandau; only four are cur- rently under the effective control of West Berlin. All of the exclaves claimed by West Berlin are located southwest or northwest of the city. The nearest are but a few yards away and the most distant are only about 4.5 miles beyond the city limits. In terms of area, economic worth, and population, none of them are of importance. Al- together they comprise only 282 acres; they range in area from less than 1 to about 117 acres; more than half are smaller than 10 acres. Except for the village of Stein- stUcken, which is chiefly residential, the bulk of the land in exclaves is used for agriculture -- mostly meadow and garden -- or for other nonurban purposes. Only two exclaves SteinstUcken and WUste-Mark -- are definitely known to be inhabited; in addition, a few persons may reside in Finken- krug, which is under East German control. The Eiskeller area also has a small number of residents. Approved for Release: 2017/11/01 CO2989061 Approved for Release: 2017/11/01 CO2989061 III. Exclaves Attached to Bezirk Zehlendorf Of the five exclaves claimed by West Berlin and joined administratively to Bezirk Zehlendorf in the American sec- tor, only two -- SteinstUcken and WUste-Mark -- are under effective West Berlin control; together they account for 89 percent of the total area (95 acres) of the exclaves subordinate to that Bezirk. SteinstUcken, located nearly half a mile south of Zeh- lendorf, is by far the most important of the West Berlin exclaves, and it has been the focus of most of the past con- troversy over exclave status. Its permanent population has fluctuated between 150 and 200 persons during the entire postwar period. A varying number of so-called \"second\" res- idents, persons who live in West Berlin proper or in West Germany, are permitted to visit relatives or friends in SteinstUcken, and designated individuals are allowed to enter the exclave for professional, service, or supply pur- poses. The Soviets and the East Germans have not formally ques- tioned the status of Steinstficken as part of the American sector of Berlin since 1952, but they have periodically ob- structed access to it across East German territory. Most of this harassment has been directed against nonresidents using the single road available for travel between Stein- stUcken and West Berlin. Residents of the exclave, on the other hand, generally have been allowed relatively free movement between these points. Wiste-Mark, the largest of the Zehlendorf exclaves, is situated southeast of SteinstUcken and about 0.7 mile south of the West Berlin border. It consists almost entirely of farmland. Other than the one permanent resident of the area, only two persons -- a tenant and a farmhand -- are permitted entrance from West Berlin. Soviet and East Ger- man authorities have not interfered with the free movement of these individuals since June 1958. Lying nearly 1.75 miles south of Zehlendorf, the Nuthe Wiese exclave has been incorporated for all practical pur- poses into East Germany. This exclave consists of farm- land and at the time it came under East German control it did not have permanent residents. The land in this exclave is believed to have been incorporated into the field system of adjoining properties. Access by residents of West Berlin has not been permitted since about 1952. - 3 - Approved for Release: 2017/11/01 CO2989061 Approved for Release: 2017/11/01 CO2989061 � Parcels A and B are two microscopic exclaves that lie only a few yards from the West Berlin border within the small East German salient extending north of Glienicker Lake. Other than the fact that they are claimed by West Berlin, nothing is known about them. They have been under East German control during the entire postwar period and have never been mentioned in discussions or documents per- taining to exclaves. Because of their extremely small size they are overlooked on all but large-scale maps. IV. Exclaves Attached to Bezirk Spandau The six exclaves of West Berlin that are administra- tively subordinate to Bezirk Spandau have generally been much less controversial than those of Bezirk Zehlendorf. So far as can be determined only two of the exclaves of this group -- Fichtewiese and Erlengrund -- are under ef- fective West Berlin Administration; together they account for about 5 percent of the total area (187.8 acres) of the Spandau exclaves. Fichtewiese and Erlengrund are used as weekend gardens by the members of two private societies and their friends, the only persons allowed to transit the narrow intervening strip of East German territory. About 325 persons are given this privilege. Neither Fichtewiese nor Erlengrund has permanent inhabitants, although a num- ber of cottages have been built on individual garden plots The other exclaves of this group apparently are under the de facto administration of East Germany. With the possible exception of Finkenkrug, these exclaves probably have no permanent inhabitants and are of little intrinsic worth. V. Eiskeller West Berlin maintains that Eiskeller is not an exclave because it is joined to the main part of the city by a nar- row roadway lying within the legal city boundary. This relationship is generally indicated on large-scale West Berlin maps of the city. Most East German maps, on the other hand, deny the existence of the connecting corridor and show Eiskeller as a true exclave. Border fences par- allel each side of the road, and at the present time there are no barriers to obstruct traffic between Eiskeller and West Berlin. Eiskeller has been the subject of several past confrontations between the British and the authorities of East Germany and the USSR, but the area and its access road have been under the control of West Berlin and Western authorities throughout the postwar period. The area has a small civilian population and is occupied by a detachment of West Berlin police. Approved for Release: 2017/11/01 CO2989061 Approved for Release: 2017/11/01 CO2989061 GT VI. Prospects West Berlin authorities will probably continue to main- tain a claim to all exclaves. In the event of negotiations to settle the question, however, discussion might well be limited to areas actually under effective West Berlin con- trol -- the exclaves of SteinstUcken, WUste-Mark, Erlengrund, and Fichtewiese and the outlying Eiskeller. The USSR and East Germany have challenged Western rights to these areas in the past, and it is possible that in the future they may attempt to abrogate or modify the agreements now regulating travel and assert their own claims. Although Western author- ities have not renounced their rights to the remaining ex- claves, they may find it difficult to challenge the reality of East German control.

Persons having a second residence in Steins-Woken do not live there; they are relatives and friends of permanent inhabitants of SteinstUcken.
