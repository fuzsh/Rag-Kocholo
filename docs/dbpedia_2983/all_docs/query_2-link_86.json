        "text": "This week I’ve headed to the Tegeler See, a lake in the north-west of Berlin. The boulevard with restaurants direct me to a boardwalk with ferries. Inlands of the Große Malche, a bay in this one lake, a peculiar oak looses its leaves because of the autumn season. That means, the leaves it still has. After a couple of centuries, the Dicke Marie (Fat Mary) has remarkably less bush to show off than the younger vegetation that surrounds her.\n\nIf you’d like to believe so, the oak’s history starts in the spring of 1107. That’s when an acorn came ashore in the bay of the Große Malche. It listened to growling bears and the songs of minstrels during the middle ages. In the middle of the 16th century, it was the first tree outside the domain of the Schloss Tegel (Tegel Palace). As a result, his fellow trees were cut and turned into a garden. By the end of the 18th century, the nearby town of Tegel already talked about the old oak. In 1778, Johann von Goethe -world’s most famous German that lived at the time- honoured the oak with his visit. A few years later, Alexander and Wilhelm (the boys from the Von Humboldt’s who lived in Schloss Tegel at the time) honoured the oak after their cook. The tree was given the nickname: Dicke Marie. In the meanwhile, sand slipped slowly on the banks. So, the oak stands about 30 meters inland now. The tree is listed as a natural monument.\n\nThis is a version of the story. But what is true of it? Let’s first try and find out how old Marie actually is. The answers though, have been more confusing as clarifying.\n\nThe age of Dicke Marie has been guessed more than once by editors of various newspapers. A journalist in 1956 overestimated Marie’s age – and wanted to celebrate her 1000th birthday. This gives me a bit of the creeps. I can’t ignore my impression that such an estimation came from nostalgia, projecting the idea of a Tausendjähriges Reich on this single oak. Oaks were popular among Germans in the first half of the 20th century. Especially the nazi-regime turned it a little too much a national symbol out of it. Their admiration for the oak and its long-life also already led to a monumental status for Dicke Marie in 1939.\n\nIn 1986 however, an article in the Berliner Morgenpost estimated Marie’s age to be 700 – while their competing editors from the Berliner Zeitung thought she was another age older. My gut feeling says: Berliner Zeitung tends to exegerrate a whole lot more than the Morgenpost. A more recent article in the B.Z. about the Dicke Marie, states that the tree can celebrate its 900th birthday – an estimation that seems to be generally accepted by now. But the truth is: no one really knows.\n\nIt’s even debated whether the nickname for this oak truely is given by the Von Humboldt’s. An article about the tree (dating to 1996) says: there is no written proof of this “in despite of extensive research.” It’s just that in the late 1980s the local authorities for environmental protection looked for a fitting name. There surely were nicknames such as ‘Mutter Dossen‘ and ‘Dicke Marie‘. But with only oral (and no written) suggestions that this nickname is given by 2 whizzkids more than 200 years prior? It makes that the nickname ‘Dicke Marie’ is mostly a publicity stunt.\n\nConclusion? Little is really known about the oak. I’ve noticed that people like to celebrate whatever birthday they project on it. I guess that the only way to find out the oak’s real age will be by cutting it and counting the annual rings – a rather fatal solution to solve this issue. And still, journalists rewrite the falsified history of this tree. Though, there is one relief for Marie. In her life-time, no one will be able to see her age by her appearance!\n\nHitler intended to win the war (you heard it here first….) and he doodled a triumphal arch in ±1926 already. Somewhat ten years later, the future for world-domination came uncomfortably closer. Albert Speer, Hitler’s favorite architect at that time, was given the assignment to turn Berlin into a world capital. Speer planned for two tacky boulevards (Achsen, or: axes). One from the East to the West of Berlin, another one from the South to the North. The North-South axe was planned from S-Bahnhof Papestraße (nowadays S-Bahnhof Südkreuz) towards the Lehrter Bahnhof (nowadays: Hauptbahnhof) and further up north. The idea was, that a 120 meters wide boulevard with the biggest monuments, important cultural organisations and offices of the biggest companies would convince rural civilians from the aesthetics of national-socialism. To remember and honour the German soldiers of the First World War, thet triumphal arch would be the first attraction to bump into. There was work to be done: the urban project had to be finished in 1950.\n\nOfficially, Albert Speer was given artistic freedom to construct the triumphal arch. Inofficially, Speer remembered that Hitler gave him a drawing of an arch. The lickspittle understood that his career would be guaranteed if he realised Hitler’s design. The arch had a height of 117 meter. More than 2 million names of WWI soldiers that died would be immortalised in the structure.\n\nAlbert Speer though, realised that the megalomanic construction could be quite demanding for the soil. In March 1938, before any construction took place, the ground in the area was tested. The assignment was given to build a solid cylinder of reinforced concrete, filled up with the newest measuring equipment. It had a weight 12,65 million kilogram. 21 meter was aboveground and another 10 meters was below the surface. It was given the name Schwerbelastungskörper (which translates as: the heavy-weight bearing body) or in short: Bauwerk T. Nothing much happened, even after the resources were organised in March 1940. Still, it wasn’t before April 1941 that the Schwerbelastungskörper really was constructed with the forced help of French Prisoners of War (PoW’s). Half a year later, the construction of the Schwerbelastungskörper was finished.\n\nIn June 1944, the test results from the Bauwerk T came out. Where a sinking of 2 to 6 centimeters was allowed, the cylinder had sunk about 19 centimeters already. To be honest with you, it remains unclear to me if these results were analysed in 1944 already, or only after the war in 1948. A rumor (not a fact to be sure of) says that Hitler knew about these results, but ignored them and demanded the immediate construction of the arch. The post-war conclusion from 1948 postulated that the triumphal arch would be too heavy for the surface, unless the soil would be solidified. This technique was already known in the 1940s till a certain extent. However, the change in the course of history made that there was no need anymore.\n\nSince it is located in the middle of a neighbourhood, the Schwerbelstungskörper could not be blown up with explosives. From 1951 up to 1983, it was still used for soil testing. Eventually, the Bauwerk T is now listed and protected as a monument. Since September 2009, the Schwerbelastungskörper is renovated and made accessible. Inside the concrete cylinder, its ground floor can be seen. An expo informs you about Hitler’s unrealistic urban planning. Next to the Schwerbelastungskörper, stairs can bring you to up to a platform with a view on the top of it.\n\nIt leads me to conclude that the soil initially would not have been strong enough to hold the arch. It remains unclear whether techonology existed that could have been made it work. It’s tempting to believe it wouldn’t, because how symbolic would that be? Imagine it: Hitler’s triumphal arch – going down in a self-created sink-hole…\n\nFor details to visit the Schwerbelastungskörper, click here."
