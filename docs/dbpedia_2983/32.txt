With an area of 4.5 km², Lake Tegel is the second largest lake in Berlin after Lake Müggel. Only Müggelsee in the east is larger. Lake Tegel is therefore larger than the well-known Lake Wannsee. It is located in the northwest of Berlin in the district of Reinickendorf. The river Havel flows through the lake.

You can get to the shore of Lake Tegel from many places. For example, you can simply take the U6 underground line to the “Alt-Tegel” terminus. From here it is about 500 metres to the shore. This is the harbour for the large passenger ships (see picture below) that sail on Lake Tegel and the Havel River to Wannsee, Potsdam, etc. There are also a number of restaurants in the Tegel district.

By far the most popular tour starts in the center of Berlin and passes many sights such as government district with Reichstag and Chancellery, Museum Island and Berlin Cathedral. The excursion by ship lasts about 1 hour and costs 18 euros. You should definitely book online, with a guarantee of a seat:

Here in the district of Tegel on Lake Tegel there is also a worthwhile promenade on the lakeside (Greenwichpromenade), a great old footbridge, some restaurants, a park, minigolf and much more.

Afterwards we took the bus line 222 from the underground station Alt-Tegel to the large peninsula in Lake Tegel in the small village of Alttegel. Here you are surrounded by water on 3 sides. To the north of the village is a forest with a game reserve and more. There is a footpath along the water in many places.

Finally, we took a ferry across the Havel from Tegelort to Hakenfelde. There we took a bus to the S-Bahn to Berlin-Spandau (from the Aalemannufer stop, bus 136).

We liked the Tegeler See, especially the forest Tegeler Forst west of Alt-Tegel and north of Tegelort is great.
