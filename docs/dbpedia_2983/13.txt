Lake Tegel (Deutsch. Tegeler See), is the second largest lake in Berlin, Germany. It is situated in the northwest of the city in the Reinickendorf borough.

Most of the waterfront is privately held. The historic name Tegel (first recorded in 1322 as Tygel) is common for a larger territory and also used for the settlements of the Tegel locality, the Tegelort ("Tegel Village") neighbourhood within the Konradsh√∂he locality and the Berlin-Tegel International Airport.
