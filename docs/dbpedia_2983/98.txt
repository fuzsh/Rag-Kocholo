In the north of Berlin, not far from the Tegel Airport, one can admire probably the most appealing development of the International Building Exhibition 87. Here, a former industrial site on the Tegel lake was transformed into a postmodernist quarter with social housing, city villas, and a library with a magnificent structure hardly noticeable from the outside.

You can arrive by U-Bahn to the station Alt-Tegel and head into the direction of the Humboldt Library. After crossing the road and descending to the water level, you are greeted by a steel fish and the first city villas of the IBA87 located on your left. Both the fish and the nearest villa are by Charles Moore, an American architect who founded the post-modernist architecture movement.

Unfortunately, his masterplan for the residential and cultural quarter was not finished and is now interrupted by quite boring housing blocks. You can pass in between them and reach the Humboldt Library, another building by Charles Moore. A striking inner structure is hidden behind a classical exterior, so make sure to go inside.

Continue along the waterfront in the direction of the Tegel lake. Do not miss the entrance into the courtyard on your left. This is the social housing part. In the second courtyard there is a memorial to Charles Moore.
