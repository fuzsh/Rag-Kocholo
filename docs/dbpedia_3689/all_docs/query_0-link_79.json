She was the youngest of three daughters; Francis Steele was the oldest, followed by Meribah Oliver. The three maintained a very close relationship throughout their lives.\n\nDoris was educated in Columbia Public Schools and graduated from Hickman High School in 1937. She attended a business school to help sharpen her secretarial skills, and in 1941 she was hired by the Agricultural Extension Service of the University of Missouri. She served faithfully in various secretarial positions throughout her career with the university, including secretary to the associate dean of the College of Agriculture. Doris was honored upon her retirement from the university in 1985, with a large celebration thanking her for 44 years of distinguished service to the university.\n\nIn 1941 Doris married the love of her life, J.B. Thomas. J.B. and Doris always held hands, and she would profess that he treated her like a queen. They remained inseparable and happily married until his death on Dec. 15, 1976. After J.B.'s death, her sister, Francis, urged Doris to get out and socialize. She eventually met J.B. Mahan (widowed), and they were married on Jan. 24, 1988, at the home of the Rev. Homer Lay in a private ceremony. She enjoyed living out in the country and getting to know and become friends with J.B.'s son and family, Joe and Wanda Mahan and their children.\n\nWhen Mr. Mahan died on Feb. 10, 1996, Doris moved back from the country into Columbia, where she continued to attend the Extension dinners for retirees. It was at one of these dinners that she became re-acquainted with Ed Wiggins (widowed), a retired professor of agricultural economics who had served as an agent of the Extension Service. Ed and Doris were married in a private ceremony at Broadway Christian Church on June 24, 2000, where Ed was a charter member and Doris also became a member. They enjoyed family and friends, dining out and gatherings at special events, including Christmas. They remained active until their health began to decline a few years ago. At that time, Ed moved to Lenoir Health Care and Doris followed about six months later. Doris was pleased to have had the opportunity to get to know Ed's two sons, Kip and his wife, Mary Beth, and their children, and Rex and his wife, Diane, and their family. Ed's family continued to phone and visit Doris after Ed's death on May 24, 2012.\n\nThroughout her life, Doris loved to dance, and during the 1950s and '60s you could find her and her husband in the ballroom of the Tiger Hotel dancing with a large crowd belonging to the Saturday Nighters and swinging to big band music!\n\nCooking was something else that Doris loved to do, and many relatives and friends got to enjoy her large spread of food on Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Often she and her sisters and their aunt, Jamilee, who was like a sister, joined together to cook in the same kitchen. It was a delight to watch as they moved about without ever bumping into one another or spilling anything on their beautiful attire (those small aprons were for decoration only) — like well-choreographed dancers. The men in the family were not allowed in the kitchen when the ladies were at work. The sisters also were artists in making candy for Christmas: divinity and peanut brittle! Each one had a specific duty, and when the boiling peanut brittle was poured by one onto a large pan, the other three began pulling it — ouch! — laying the thin pieces out on wax paper. Doris loved it, and they all had fun. She loved flowers, especially those received from her church and from her husband, family and friends. Doris loved to keep up on current events and read the paper daily, as well as magazines. She loved the 4-H Clubs and delighted in supporting them with her donations; after all, 4-H was part of the Extension Service.\n\nFor Doris, one of the most difficult things to give up was driving her car, which she had to do about two-and-a-half years ago. For her, it signaled a loss of independence.\n\nDoris and Ed truly appreciated the caring atmosphere and the excellent care they received from the staff at Lenoir Health Care during the last years of their lives. We shall miss her warm smile, sparkling eyes and kind heart.\n\nDoris is survived by two cousins, Howard R. Jones of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, and his family, and David Jones of Columbia; one nephew, Gayle Lampson of Houston, Texas; and her best friend and former colleague, Pam Seibert, and her family.\n\nDoris was preceded in death by her parents, both sisters and an aunt.\n\nOnline condolences for the family may be left at www.parkerfuneralservice.com.\n\nPublished Saturday, February 2, 2013\n\nLisa Smith, 48, of Columbia passed into eternity on Sunday, Jan. 27, 2013, at Boone Hospital Center.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 11 a.m. Monday, Feb. 4, at H.T.
