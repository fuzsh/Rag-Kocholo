Composer Laura Karpman will perform a piece from the Oscar® nominated score from American Fiction.\n\nWHAT: ACLU SoCal Centennial Bill of Rights Awards\n\nWHEN: Sunday, February 18, 2024\n\n4:30pm Press check-in\n\n5:00pm Red carpet opens\n\n6:00pm Dinner and program starts\n\nWHO:\n\nHonorees: Filmmakers Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, Actor Sheryl Lee Ralph, Poet and Author Alok Vaid-Menon.\n\nPresenters/Guests: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Martin Sheen, Lena Waithe, Shari Belafonte, Stephanie Hsu, Dulé Hill, Justin Tranter, Tig Notaro and poet Rupi Kaur.\n\nPerformers: Oscar® nominated composer Laura Karpman will perform a piece from the Oscar® nominated score from American Fiction.\n\nEmcee: Jason George\n\nWHERE: The Westin Bonaventure Hotel\n\n404 S. Figueroa Street\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90071\n\nParking info will be sent upon confirmation\n\nPlease find below additional information on this year's honorees.\n\nFilmmakers Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, are the Oscar®-winning directing/writing duo behind Everything Everywhere All at Once, as well as a decade's worth of attention-grabbing music videos, short films and independent films (95% of which have at least one butt joke). Their work has focused on diverse stories from underheard perspectives featuring immigrant, queer and Asian-American characters while exposing and exploding various taboos for dramatic and comedic effect. They have advocated for workers’ rights and ethical filmmaking practices in their own industry. And while promoting their movies, they have used their platform to highlight activists and their causes through fundraising, partnerships or that one time Daniel mentioned how hurtful anti-drag bills are during his Oscar® speech.\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph/Actress, Producer, Activist, is a stunning performer with an extraordinary career, whose lifelong work as an advocate is equally impressive. For decades, she has used her platform to educate audiences and fight stigma around HIV/AIDS. Her recent documentary film Unexpected spotlights communities who are most affected, underserved and underrepresented, namely Black women. Her transformational one-woman show Sometimes I Cry personalizes women’s stories about health and wellbeing and her show My Soul Cries Out presents real women’s stories about domestic abuse. Ralph’s DIVA Foundation centers on five pillars: health awareness, women and girls, LGBTQ people, social justice and racial equity, and food and housing security.\n\nAlok Vaid-Menon is an author, poet, comedian and activist, whose work elevates “trans ordinariness.” From their advocacy to \"degender\" the fashion and the beauty industries to their poetry yearning for beauty in a time of grief and loss, Alok has done so much to foster an accurate reflection and celebration of the trans community. Their writing includes Beyond the Gender Binary, Femme in Public and Your Wound/My Garden. In a world plagued with vitriol and division especially towards LGBTQ people, they have led with joy, kindness and compassion."
