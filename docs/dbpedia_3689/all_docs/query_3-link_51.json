        "text": "Mosaic Theater Company presents Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill, an immersive nightclub experience about the legendary Billie Holiday. Helen Hayes Award-winning actress Roz White stars as the legendary singer after completing the national tour of TINA: The Tina Turner Musical. Written by Lanie Robertson and directed by Mosaic Theater Artistic Director Reginald L. Douglas, performances run September 5-October 6, 2024 at the Atlas Performing Arts Center. Lady Day is produced in partnership with Washington Performing Arts.\n\n“Lady Day will be a one-of-a-kind experience, especially as we transform the Atlas into a\n\ncabaret-style nightclub,” Douglas said. “It’s a story of resilience that honors Billie Holiday’s\n\nstruggles while celebrating the breadth of her artistry and impact. I’m thrilled to welcome Roz White back to Mosaic to play this American icon. Roz has previously brought her powerhouse vocals and dynamic acting to Mosaic’s productions of Fabulation and Marie & Rosetta, where she portrayed Sister Rosetta Tharpe to great acclaim. I know she will again wow audiences in this production, which we are calling our love letter to Black women and Black artists.”\n\nAbout Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill\n\nJourney back to 1959 for an unforgettable rendezvous with Lady Day herself—the incomparable Billie Holiday performed by DC legend Roz White, in the role she was born to play.

Featuring classics such as “God Bless the Child” and “Strange Fruit,” this acclaimed play with music transports you to a small bar in Philadelphia for one of the icon’s final concerts, transforming the theater into an immersive nightclub complete with a live band and cocktails. Building on the success of Mosaic’s past productions Twisted Melodies and The Devil’s Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith, this fresh production of Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill explores the triumphs and traumas of Holiday’s life and career while celebrating the resilience of Black women throughout history.
