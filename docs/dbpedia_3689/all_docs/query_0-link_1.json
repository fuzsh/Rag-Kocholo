I’m just realizing that Moolah Beach is 19 YEARS OLD and I’m finally seeing what the cast looks like now for the very first time and man these kids have definitely grown.😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵\n\nHonestly I think Moolah Beach should get its on board here since without it we wouldn't have Endurance and Karma. Also so I can conduct interviews if I am able to with the contestants.\n\nI second this!! We owe everything to Moolah Beach. It deserves more love!\n\nPost by baronvonluna on\n\nI know I’m a little late to the game here but I came across this post after wanting to see if my website was showing on Google. Drew’s Instagram is indeed @dlunagram, and his business page is @drewlunarealtor, he also runs his own site Destination-Charlotte.com. He and his family moved to Charlotte last fall and he’s now a full real estate broker (no longer the po po)! Full disclosure, this post was made partly for fun, because I am he! I absolutely love that you guys still have a love for MB, if anyone wishes to reach out to me on social media, I’m absolutely open to say hello! Look forward to hearing from you guys.\n\nGo Red Team!\n\nLove,\n\nDrew\n\nPost by multiyapples on\n\nI know I’m a little late to the game here but I came across this post after wanting to see if my website was showing on Google.

Do you still keep in contact with other contestants on the show?\n\nPost by carsonvega on\n\nI know I’m a little late to the game here but I came across this post after wanting to see if my website was showing on Google.

I didn't watch MB until many years after it aired (after I had watched all six seasons of Endurance), but I still enjoyed it. I thought you played the game really well - better than I would have at the same age, that's for sure.\n\nPost by multiyapples on\n\nI know I’m a little late to the game here but I came across this post after wanting to see if my website was showing on Google.
