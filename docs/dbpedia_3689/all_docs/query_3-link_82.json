The open letter calls on the entertainment community to speak out forcefully against Hamas, to support Israel, to refrain from sharing misinformation about the war, and do whatever is in their power to urge the terrorist organization to return the innocent hostages to their families.\n\nThe letter comes in response to Hamas’ heinous terrorist attack on Israel. In addition to the 1,200+ Israelis murdered, citizens of the US, UK, Canada, France, Thailand, Nepal, Russia, Ukraine, Cambodia, Germany, Philippines, Chile, Brazil, Italy, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and Ireland have been identified as either missing or killed.\n\nGal Gadot shared, “My heart is aching for the lives lost and families shattered. I’m praying for everyone who has been affected by Hamas’ terrorism and brutality. And I hope that the world remains steadfast in their support of the Israeli people.”\n\nThe statement is the first of its kind – a call from the entertainment industry unequivocally voicing support for Israel and condemning Hamas’ terrorism.\n\nHaim Saban added, “In the aftermath of the barbaric killing of more than 1,200 Israelis, we in the Hollywood community and around the world must stand with Israel as it defends itself against a terrorist regime in Gaza that seeks Israel’s destruction.”\n\nOver 2000+ Signatories Including: Haim Saban, Chairman and CEO, Saban Capital Group; Gal Gadot, Actress, Producer; Irving Azoff, CEO/ Chairman, Full Stop Management; Bryan Lourd, CEO, CAA; Richard Lovett, Co-Chairman, CAA; Michael Douglas, Actor; Aaron Bay-Schuck, CEO/Co-Chairman Warner Records; Liev Schreiber, Actor; Chris Pine, Actor; Amy Schumer, Actress; Jamie Lee Curtis, Actress; Mayim Bialik, Actor; Debra Messing, Actress; Jerry Seinfeld, Actor/Comedian; Jody Gerson Chairman and CEO, Universal Music Publishing; Ziggy Marley, Artist; Mark Hamill, Actor; Jenji Kohan, Writer and Producer; Ryan Murphy, Showrunner; Zachary Levi, Actor; Sharon Osbourne, Manager, On-Air Talent; Julian Edelman, Co-Founder, Coast Productions; Jim Berkus, Chairman of the Board of Directors, UTA; Greg Berlanti, Writer/Director/Producer; Andy Garcia, Actor; Tracey-Ann Oberman, Actress; Bella Thorne, Actress; Emmanuelle Chriqui, Actress; Howie Mandel, Entertainer; Eli Roth, Director; Antoine Fuqua, Producer/Director; Ryan Kavanaugh, Founder, Proxima; Phil Rosenthal, Actor/Producer; George Lopez, Entertainer; Mekhi Phifer, Actor; Jason Alexander, Actor/Director; Fred Savage, Actor/Director; Ynon Kreiz, Chairman and CEO, Mattel, Inc.; Dana Goldberg, Skydance, Chief Creative Officer; Gail Berman, Producer; Steve Schnur, Worldwide Executive & Music President, Electronic Arts; Sherry Lansing, Former CEO of Paramount Pictures; Rick Rosen, Co-Founder, Endeavor; Josh Greenstein, President Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group; Rick Yorn, Co-Founder, LBI Entertainment; Kevin Yorn, Founder & Managing Partner, Yorn Levine Entertainment Law Firm; Ben Silverman; Chairman & Co-CEO, Propagate Content; Nina Tassler, CEO, Tassler, Inc.; Jeremy Piven, Actor; Josh Peck, Actor; Daniel Glass, Founder/CEO, Glassnote Records; Noa Tishby, Actress/Producer; Orly Marley, President, Tuff Gong Worldwide; Basil Iwanyk, Filmmaker and Producer; Jacqueline Saturn, President, Virgin Music; David Renzer, Former CEO/Chairman Universal Music Publishing; Modi Wiczyk, Co-Founder and Co-CEO, MRC; Zach Katz, President and COO, FaZe Clan; David Levy, Partner, WME; Mike Levine, Co-Head of CAA Sports; Risa Gertner, Co-Head of CAA Motion Picture Group; Michael Rotenberg, Partner, 3 Arts Entertainment; David Zedeck , Global Head of Music at UTA; Neil Blair, Partner, The Blair Partnership; Marty Singer, Attorney, Lavely and Singer; Patti Felker, Felker Toczek Suddleson Abramson McGinnis Ryan; Fred Toczek, Partner, Felker Toczek Suddleson Abramson McGinnis Ryan; Jacob Fenton, Partner, United Talent Agency; Chuck Liddell, MMA Fighter; Diane Warren, Songwriter; Tom Rothman, Chairman & CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment; Gary Barber, Former Chairman of MGM and Founder of Spyglass Entertainment; Scott Greenberg, Partner LBI; Guy Nattiv, Filmmake; Helen Mirren, Actress; Bruce Resnikoff, President and CEO, Universal Music Enterprises; John Fogerty, Musician; Billy Porter, Actor; Kevin Huvane, Co-Chairman, CAA; Jon Bernthal, Actor; Shannen Doherty, Actor; Sam Levinson, Writer/Director,Gary Sinise, Actor; Noah Wyle, Actor/writer; Simu Liu, Actor; Nicholas Sparks, Author; Danielle Panabaker, Actress, Kathy Ireland, Entrepreneur/Philanthropist/Chair & CEO, Kathy Ireland Worldwide; Frances Fisher, Actress/Activist; Peter Frampton, Artist; Samantha Ronson, Artist; Richard Lewis, Actor/Comedian; Matthew Weiner, Writer/Director, amongst others.\n\nSee full list of signees below, and to add your name click here: [LINK]\n\nTracy-Ann Oberman stated, “I am filled with sadness and anger at the growing antisemitism that is being fueled on the back of this horror. But even though we may feel broken as a people we are also resilient. We will survive as we always have.”\n\n“The nightmare that Israelis have feared for decades became a reality as Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israeli cities and towns,” the statement reads. “Under the cover of thousands of rockets fired indiscriminately into civilian populations, Hamas murdered and kidnapped innocent men, women, and children,” it continues.”\n\nAs the war will inevitably continue, the letter warns, “Social media will be overrun by an orchestrated misinformation campaign spearheaded by Iran”. The letter urges “everyone to remember the horrific images that came out of Israel and to not amplify or fall for their propaganda.”\n\nCCFP’s Chairman, David Renzer, and Executive Director, Ari Ingel shared, “we join entertainment industry leaders horrified at the loss of life in cities, towns, and at a celebratory music festival in southern Israel. Sadly, only now, after hundreds of innocent lives have been lost, does the world comprehend Hamas’ barbarity. As nations around the globe joined together against the savagery of ISIS, the world must continue to support Israel as they respond to the savagery of Hamas.”\n\nFULL OPEN LETTER\n\nThe nightmare that Israelis have feared for decades became a reality as Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israeli cities and towns.\n\nUnder the cover of thousands of rockets fired indiscriminately into civilian populations, Hamas murdered and kidnapped innocent men, women, and children. They kidnapped and murdered infants and the elderly. They raped women and mutilated their bodies. They paraded their bodies through the streets and on social media, and cowardly attacked the Supernova Music Festival – bringing death and destruction to an event celebrating friendship and love.\n\nThis is terrorism. This is evil. There is no justification or rationalization for Hamas’ actions. These are barbaric acts of terrorism that must be called out by everyone. They are a terrorist organization whose leaders call for the murder of Jews everywhere.\n\nCCFP calls on our friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry to speak out forcefully against Hamas and do whatever is in their power to urge the terrorist organization to return the innocent hostages to their families.\n\nAs Israel takes the necessary steps to defend its citizens in the coming days and weeks, social media will be overrun by an orchestrated misinformation campaign spearheaded by Iran. We urge everyone to remember the horrific images that came out of Israel and to not amplify or fall for their propaganda.\n\nOur thoughts are with all those experiencing unfathomable levels of fear and violence, and we hope for the day when Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace.\n\nSIGNED\n\nAri Ingel, Executive Director, Creative Community For Peace\n\nAaron Bay-Schuck, CEO/Co-Chairman, Warner Records\n\nBrad Ableson, Animation Director, Illumination\n\nNatalie Abrams, Co-EP\n\nDeeba Abrishamchi, Senior Manager, A&R, Universal Music Publishing Group\n\nJason Adelman, VP, Brand Innovators Labs\n\nOrly Adelson, Former President of ITV Studios, America\n\nMarty Adelstein, CEO, Tomorrow Studios\n\nAli Adler, Producer\n\nBen Adler, Musician\n\nRachel Adler, Agent, CAA\n\nDan Ahdoot, Comedian\n\nJason Alexander, Actor/Director\n\nSasha Alexander-Ponti, Actress/ Director, The Ponti Company\n\nKaren Allen, Actor/Director, Blue Willow Productions Inc.\n\nDan Aloni, Partner, WME\n\nKayla Alpert, Writer\n\nCindy Ambers, Co-Owner, Art/Work Entertainment\n\nLeon Angel, Joint Head of Football, CAA Base Limited\n\nDennis Arfa, Chairman, IAG Music, Independent Artist Group\n\nJarred Arfa, EVP and Head of Music, Independent Artist Group\n\nTaryn Ariel, Agent\n\nAntonina Armato, Founder, Heroine Music Group\n\nJeff Astrof, Showrunner, Warner Brothers\n\nLiz Astrof, Writer/Producer, 20th Century/Disney\n\nEve Attermann, Literary Agent, WME\n\nMichael Auerbach, Partner, Jackoway Austen\n\nNate Auerbach, Partner, Versus Creative\n\nKarl Austen, Attorney, Jackoway Austen\n\nMeredith Averill, TV Writer/Showrunner,\n\nShahar Avnet, Creative Director & Founder, SHAHAR AVNET\n\nAsi Azar, TV Host, Keshet\n\nIrving Azoff, Chairman, Full Stop Management\n\nIvor Baddiel, Scriptwriter and Author\n\nGary Barber, CEO, Spyglass Media\n\nMoshe Barkat, CEO, ColorTime, LLC.\n\nEve Barlow, Music Journalist\n\nJonathan Barnett, Chairman, CAA Stellar\n\nRomi Barta, Writer\n\nJonathan Baruch, Partner, Rain\n\nRichard Baskind, Partner & Head of Music, Simons Muirhead & Burton\n\nLance Bass, Music Artist\n\nNeal Batra, President, Tradition Pictures\n\nBrian Baumgartner, Actor\n\nJaime Becker, Writer/producer\n\nM.
