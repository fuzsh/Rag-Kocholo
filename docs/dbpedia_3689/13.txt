Moolah Beach was a true story with teenagers competing in competitions in order to not be exiled from the beach and ultimately win $25,000. It aired on Fox (as part of its Fox Kids lineup) as a 30-minute show and Fox Family (later shown on ABC Family) as an extended 60-minute show in the summer/fall of 2001 for 13 episodes. During each episode there would be a Kahuna, and a Makahiki mission. The winner of the Makahiki mission would earn two idols of their choosing, hoping to find the one with the 25,000 dollar grand prize. The Kahuna mission determined how many offerings you would give to the great Kahuna. First place got ten, second got five, third got four, and so on. A second season of Moolah Beach was announced at the reunion special but it never materialized.

Location[]

The show was filmed on Pilaa beach near Hanalei on the island of Kauai's North Shore.
