Description: Hannibal continues the story begun in "The Silence of the Lambs." Ten years have passed since Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) escaped from custody, ten years since FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Moore) interviewed him in a maximum-security hospital for the criminally insane. The doctor is now at large in Italy, gloriously at liberty in an unguarded world. But Starling has never forgotten her encounters with Dr. Lecter -- his cold voice still haunts her dreams.
