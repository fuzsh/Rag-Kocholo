The films and TV show containing this famous character have different directors and so, arguably, the cinematic portrayal of Hannibal will be slightly different in each one. Theodore Caserta argues this in his 1986 thesis, writing “Just as each writer has his own individual style, so each film director has his own individual method of representation” (Reality into Film, 37). Despite this, Hannibal is a consistently distinctive cinematic creation. Firstly, it’s easy to argue one of the most prominent and unsettling aspects of him is the contrast between his finely ‘cultured’ composure and outbursts of horror and violence. These are created through prop motifs such as his memory-drawn charcoal depictions of city landscapes, and the costume design of well-tailored, smart-looking suits.

Associated with Hannibal are all things fine. The story asserts he was widely respected in the field of psychiatry before being caught for murder and cannibalism. His non-diegetic music cues are generally classical pieces of great poise and subtle beauty. This occurs after the title-card of Hannibal (Ridley Scott, 2001) when what could be argued as the staple Hannibal Lecture piece is played atop the opening sequence. It’s formal, calm, traditional and beautiful. This is heard as one is seeing black and white footage of people on the streets, edited jerkily to be jumping, discontinuous and barely settling into place before the image is replaced with another. Interspersed are disturbing flashes of meat, which are vividly in colour, unlike the people which it is overlapping. Although merely the opening of the film, the editing and music work powerfully to create shocking contrast. Hannibal prides himself on seducing people into thinking of intellect and refinement regarding him, all while horrors are brewing in his mind and people are dying at his hands.

This music particularly enhances the relationship between Hannibal’s composure and his carefully placed violence or suggestions of violence. Corrigan and White write that “sound is a sensual experience that in some cases makes an even deeper impression than the film’s visuals” (The Film Experience, 176). The sensual experience gained from the classical piano is the association of high-brow intelligence and culture, which appears to contradict entirely against the brutal, animalistic nature of Hannibal’s crimes. The connection is evident enough throughout the Hannibal franchise that when classical music begins playing, it is certain something horrifying is about to or has happened.

The same classical piano piece can be found in The Silence of the Lambs (Jonathan Demme, 1991) as the camera initially tracks over his Renaissance-style sketches before cutting to the silhouette of Hannibal behind a curtain, distinctive but also mostly hidden due to the dim lighting and mise-en-scène placement of Hannibal and the curtain. An atmosphere of tension is created from this and indeed, seventy minutes into the film the first bloody and awful on-screen murders occur, directly preceded by all that makes Hannibal seem respectable. Hannibal (Bryan Fuller, 2013-5) also makes the connection after arguably the first major violence scene of the series in the episode Fromage. Hannibal kills a man in his office, limps over to his harpsichord and begins to play the piece. It starts as diegetic sound with a medium close-up of Hannibal’s hand on the keys, the one which delivered the death blow, and serves as a non-diegetic segue to cut into the next scene where he brilliantly convinces his colleagues of his innocence.

The effect is that quite plainly, something is wrong with Hannibal. The calculated waiting and deliberately placed exposure of his evil is most heavily associated with his refined behaviour, crafting a dichotomy designed to deeply shake and upset.

What’s astonishing about the cinematic creation of Hannibal is how present his character feels even when he’s gone thirty minutes without screen-time. When speaking on the development of characters and their effective presence in the plot, Corrigan and White write that “characters […] began to be drawn according to […] psychological complexities” among other things (222). The filmic treatment of Hannibal’s influence therefore deepens the character. Hannibal’s omnipotence ranges over every character and, subsequently, extends to the audience. Although each of the films often go a substantial amount of time without showing Hannibal, he is somehow ever-present, in audio tapes, or a character’s and the audience’s acknowledgement that Hannibal might have insight on a situation. He is an omnipotent presence, inescapable even in the fact that the 2001 film and television adaptation are titled, quite simply, Hannibal.

One instance where his absence is especially noticeable for its controlling of the scene is in Red Dragon (Brett Ratner, 2002). An anxious and fast-moving atmosphere is created through cross-cutting between Hannibal locked up and motionless, while all the actions of the other characters are entirely concerned with him. The repeated back and forth cuts emphasise Will Graham and others examining the letter from Hannibal’s possessions, while being excruciatingly careful to ensure Hannibal doesn’t know they know. All is frantic on their side – conversely, a static close-up only gives access to Hannibal’s eyes and then a reverse shot of what he observes, which is a maintenance man stalling. His presence beyond where he physically is, and their tension to not let him know their actions, is practically palpable. Hannibal is the instigator of this panic by literally doing nothing.

This can also be observed through the development of Hannibal’s seeming omnipotence in Hannibal (2001). Agent Starling is listening to tapes of Hannibal in a distinctly dark setting, and her colleague is frightened when she unplugs her headphones, suddenly bursting Hannibal’s eerily calm voice into the room. The presence of his mere voice induces fear, even without physical accompaniment. The mise-en-scène design and camera framing for this encounter is very full and crowded, with the dark lighting, tight shots cluttered by props, and close framing of the characters emphasising the lack of space and trapped feeling that comes with the sudden emergence of Hannibal’s voice.

Along with other instances, Hannibal’s omnipotence develops to the point of entering Starling’s house while she’s sleeping and literally hovering over her as she is unaware. The moment is heavily focussed upon, with a low upward looking camera angle at Hannibal; heavily shadowed and intensely quiet, with no music and hardly any diegetic sound other than their breathing. The cinematography is designed to create tension and fear at the notion that Starling has gotten so used to Hannibal ‘being around’ when he isn’t, that when he is it doesn’t register.

Similarly, the television show makes use of a sentiment almost line for line from the original book to enhance this point. Will Graham, under sickly yellow lighting and a medium-close camera shot which sees his face coldly from the side, uncomfortably observes that although Hannibal is imprisoned, it felt like they’d “walked out of the room” together (Thomas Harris, 80). The moment and idea is charged with absurdity and yet is very ominous regarding precisely what Hannibal may be capable of.

The cinematography and framing of Hannibal establishes his seemingly unassailable dominance in situations, despite his physical placement suggesting that he would not be in control, e.g. a glass prison; a straight-jacket and muzzled.

This is done through close-ups on Hannibal’s face, and emphasis on his movement and positioning within the frame. When he speaks it is often directly to the camera or with an eyeline just shy of direct, the effect of which simultaneously invites one to get closer and uncomfortably reverses the voyeuristic aspect of film watching. There are suspended static shots of simply Hannibal’s face as he speaks, with his mouth barely moving to create an eerie calm disturbed by his lilting voice, and with focus heavily placed on his eyes, which almost never blink in frame. It’s unsettling and could perhaps create the air of being judged by the character whom for all reasons one should have the right to judge most. Such cinematography manages to reverse the normal powerplay. It allows observation of the characters’ helplessness to Hannibal’s psychological tricks of power, alongside the seductive quality of his malevolence. The presentation of ‘evil’ through Hannibal is very delicately crafted using cinematography and mise-en-scène. More so than subtlety, film techniques show how Hannibal asserts dominance, regardless of the situation. One of Vesper Arnett’s main points in their 2016 dissertation is that “Hannibal […] revel[s] in his power over them” (Cruel as a Cucumber, 6).

One striking example of his influence occurs in Hannibal (2001) when Hannibal breaks into a house and intimidates the waiting dog; it backs away and cowers down, although continues to bark at his intrusion. This suggests an animalistic power to Hannibal, to which even dogs submit. The use of a low upward-angle shot of Hannibal, with very dark lighting surrounding his already dark clothing, emphasises the terrifying quality of the moment. The only diegetic sound is barking and Hannibal’s sing-song shushing, not even his footsteps. This is resonant of a break-in alarm but highlights the lack of appropriate reaction. However, the ominous music gives the impression that Hannibal is dangerous, not the animal.

This moment is somewhat paralleled in Red Dragon (2002) when Hannibal is literally leashed with bound hands and yet uses his valuable insight on another killer and the fear he inspires to control the conversation and scare Graham. He is in the position of the dog, but still the powerful party. The lighting is harshly bright and Lecter hisses snake-like as he lunges forward at Graham just to see him jump, which he does. There is a lighting and power shift present as Lecter literally pushes Graham into darkness.

Meetings between Hannibal and Starling throughout The Silence of the Lambs (1991) use social blocking to show Hannibal’s control and dominance. Corrigan and White define this as “the arrangement of characters to accentuate relations among them”, an aspect which is distinct when Starling needs information from Hannibal but he is entirely conducting the conversation (76). This is shown through Hannibal’s facing the wall rather than Starling and yet, he knows when she looks down and demands her attention and answer. Continuing, the constant back and forth cuts and close-ups between their faces show him staring directly away from her as she reveals dark, personal things about herself. This emphasises his control but also his casual, petty disinterest, as though he likes making her perform like a dancing toy. This pattern of Hannibal withholding information to wield as power over others is heightened most potently in what is known as the cage scene. As the conversation moves forward the cinematography makes Starling look especially small placed in between the bars, with a sharp foreground focus on the bars to look almost as though she is the one imprisoned. This is directly contrasted against the shots of Hannibal where he is large with a slight upward-angle camera shot. The metal bars are much less focussed and certainly not inhibiting any view of him. Though he is in the cage, Starling is the one seen as restless, helpless and emphasised within bars – she is more stuck than Hannibal ever has been. The cinematography develops and demonstrates the effects of Hannibal’s devastating intellectual control.

A phenomenon sometimes expressed as ‘car crash fascination’ is where one is fully aware the situation occurring is tragic and awful, but is too sickly fascinated to look away. In their 2007 article on the Aesthetics of Horror in Photography, Meir Wigoder wrote on this idea saying there were “photograph[s] that photojournalists take as a way of satisfying their own dark fascination with horror” (paragraph 19). A similar sentiment regularly occurs with Hannibal Lecture. The franchise is the presentation of a man just absurd enough that one may watch it to sate a dark interest without fear of judgement, particularly given there are the ‘good guys’ against Hannibal, for whom the audience hopes. But these characters, to continue their good, must consult with Hannibal and compromise themselves physically and mentally.

This can be shown in many instances, one of which stands out for its ability to scare and interest simultaneously. The famous nurse attack scene in Hannibal (2001) is a moment crafted to stimulate great fear at the same time as an urge to know more of Hannibal and his motives. The moment is given in a dark room as black and white security footage. Music begins, a disgusting pulsing – it’s fiercely uncomfortable but still the footage plays uninterrupted, indicative of the need to push on. The completely static camera trained on the TV works to effectively jump-scare when Hannibal jerks forward and tears the nurse’s cheek out with his teeth, coinciding with a leap in music as well as the diegetic sounds of Hannibal’s snarls and the nurse’s screams.

The reason the audience sees this at all is because Hannibal is being investigated for capture and for his value. He is the hyper-intellectual villain which has become an archetype for storylines across genres: too dangerous to be free and too valuable to be removed. Hannibal himself acknowledges this in Red Dragon (2002) and in doing so gets to the crux of the issue: “Any rational society would either kill me or give me my books”. He is having fun and taunting the characters, but also posing the challenge that there are moral complications to their actions that even he, the one without morality, can see. When speaking of the character Jason Bourne, Corrigan and White say his intrigue comes from being “the advanced individual […] who is emotionally and intellectually complex and one-of-a-kind” (225). This is undoubtedly applicable here. The moral wrestling between the dark and fascination, and audience implication in darkness, is crafted by the music and mise-en-scène which suggest and develop such chilling aspects of Hannibal Lecter.

Except for briefly in the beginning of Red Dragon (2002), all the films miss the chance to explore the delicately terrifying nature of having the audience know who Hannibal is, but none of the characters. This technique is known as dramatic irony. Fuller’s television adaptation Hannibal (2013-5) explores the cinematic treatment of this in the first season. As the story goes on there is implacable, insurmountable tension and fear in every episode because the viewers know, but the characters don’t. Mark Osteen wrote on this effect in his submission to a literary journal, saying “the viewer knows something that the characters don’t, and the director uses that privileged but limited information to manipulate the audience. […] [It] forces us to take part in the scene” (Sabotage and Hitchcock’s Audience, 259).

There is a subversion present in the Hannibal Lecture franchise of the ordinary horror genre tropes. Generally, the audience does not know who the killer is or what they want or often where they are: this is reversed on its head when regarding Hannibal. Through plot viewers often know precisely where Hannibal is, precisely who and “what” he is, and precisely what he wants on a surface level and as well as a more disturbing level. As discussed earlier, scenes are crafted so there is an association between audio cues and the knowledge that one is about to be faced with Hannibal; this is a somewhat involuntary involvement on the audience’s behalf. Some scenes are even designed to give disturbingly intimate knowledge of his thoughts, through careful close-ups of his face and suspension on his body. In particular, a mid-shot focusses on Hannibal and blurs the woman eating in the foreground as he watches her; there isn’t a reverse shot of this or any other instance like it, indicating the foreground is not the important aspect. This most prominently occurs in the beginning of Red Dragon (2002) when his guests are somewhat fretfully discussing the missing musician that Hannibal has served them for dinner. It is constructed so the audience and Hannibal alone know this fact, given through the cinematography insight, and making viewers implicit in his darkly stimulating and frightening deeds.

Similarly, looking directly at the camera and breaking the forth wall indicates an implied audience. This is precisely how nearly all of Hannibal’s conversational camera shots are framed during The Silence of the Lambs.

During one conversation with Starling, this relentless staring attack on the viewers is then paired with the knowledge that Hannibal can coerce an inmate into swallowing his own tongue and killing himself, merely from Hannibal’s words. It takes on a sinister, disturbing edge which works subconsciously on the audience; an attempt at crafting an atmosphere which feels legitimately unsafe.
