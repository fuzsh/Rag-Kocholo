        "text": "- Anthony Hopkins returning as Dr. Hannibal Lecter is like having an old friend for dinner.\n\nAlas, in \"Hannibal\" he's an unwelcome old friend.\n\nOr, to use another cannibalism double entendre of the kind that peppers this film's dialogue, a friend with bad taste.\n\nAnd here's a heads-up about the climactic, soon-to-be-infamous dinner which Lecter serves FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) and her treacherous, unfortunate boss (Ray Liotta).\n\nYou may find it unbelievably disgusting or you may find it unintentionally funny, but it's as kitschy a thing as you'll see in movies this side of a low-budget Troma film. One could say it's a brainy scene, which isn't the same thing as calling it smart. It is, I guess, a metaphor for a mindless action film. Didn't Emerson, Lake & Palmer make an album about this - \"Brain Salad Surgery?\"\n\n\"Hannibal\" is the sequel, 10 years on, to the Oscar-sweeping \"The Silence of the Lambs\" - it won best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best actress (Jodie Foster as then-FBI-agent-in-train ing Clarice) and best actor (Hopkins, natch).\n\nAt its best, during its tensely articulate, beautifully staged and delicately acted jail-cell confrontations between Lecter and Clarice, \"Silence\" was an intimately revelatory two-person play about the dark secrets of life.\n\nBut author Thomas Harris couldn't maintain that kind of intelligent, transfixing tension when he wrote the 1999 followup to his \"Silence.\"\n\n\"Hannibal\" was a book both stomach-churningly ghastly and ridiculously plotted, with an ending - Clarice and Lecter living together in South America - that seemed made with a Mel Brooks' comedy in mind.\n\nThat's probably why Foster and \"Lambs' \" director Jonathan Demme bowed out of the \"Hannibal\" film - they sensed something rotten in the cinematic kitchen. Hopkins, however, signed up - as did actress Moore ( \"Short Cuts,\" \"Magnolia'').\n\n\"Gladiator\" director Ridley Scott, known for his sometimesbrutal, sometimes-beautiful visual sensibilities, also joined up. And screenwriters Steven Zaillian and David Mamet pared \"Hannibal\" of some of its secondary characters (and that dumb ending), but otherwise attempted to stay true - too true - to Harris' story.\n\nIn \"Hannibal,\" Lecter no longer is a mere cannibal. Having brutally murdered his way out of a Memphis holding cell in \"Silence,\" he now is the ultimate Renaissance man. He lives under an assumed identity in Florence, dressed like a Tom Wolfe/Truman Capote dandy in wide-brimmed hat and fancy suits, attending operas and pontificating within range of the Ponte Vecchio to scholars on the history of violent imagery in the visual arts. Indeed, he has become the acting curator of a palatial art library - his superior has mysteriously disappeared.\n\nAs long as \"Hannibal\" is served au Florentine, which is roughly for about half the movie, it's involving and exciting. Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson are in love with the historic, still-vital city, using both vivid and dark colors, magnificent shadows, and breathtaking camera pans to bring life (and death) to the busy sidewalks, expansive plazas and glorious opera productions. Hans Zimmer's score, along with poignantly used classical and operatic music, also sets a strong mood.\n\nBest of all, the Florence story is believably suspenseful. Police detective Pazzi (played with a tough wariness by Giancarlo Giannini) has discovered Lecter's existence. But rather than arrest him, he tries to sell him - like a pound of flesh - to Lecter's nemesis, the wealthy, hideously deformed Mason Verger (Gary Oldman).\n\nAs Pazzi attempts to corner and capture Lecter, the cat-and-mouse positioning is nail-biting. Hopkins brings a dangerous malevolence to these scenes, punctuated with an occasional subtle comic touch, like saying \"okie dokie\" with an easy friendliness. (Later in the film, he overdoes the purringly seductive voice.)\n\nVirtually all the scenes set in the good old USA are problematic. For a start, there is the character of Mason. His hideous deformity - a twisted and distorted face lacking lips or, apparently, large swatches of original flesh - is due to a runin with Lecter back when the latter was a Baltimore psychiatrist.\n\nNot one to let bygones be bygones, Mason wants to capture Lecter alive and then feed him to savagely hungry wild pigs.\n\nIf I was making \"Hannibal,\" I would have thrown out this gory story and started over with something, anything, else. As a villain, Oldman's hammy Mason is straight out of a James Bond movie - one waits for him to reveal a secret nuclear device that will destroy the world.\n\n\"Hannibal\" is set 10 years on, but I defy anyone to see a connection between Foster's shy, tentative Clarice and Moore's older version, beyond the \"corn-pone\" West Virginia accent.\n\nMoore is a fine actress, but she doesn't do shyness or nervousness well - remember her confrontational nude scene in \"Short Cuts''? As a result, the charm is gone from the character. Clarice has no fears. One wonders what Lecter still sees in her, especially once he returns to the U.S. and makes contact.\n\nThe film does Clarice no favor by beginning with a noisy \"Lethal Weapon''-like botched shootout with some criminals at a D.C. market. She kills five, including a mom with her infant in a carrier, and then is framed by an evil superior (Liotta) to take the fall.\n\nIt is because of this incident that she comes to Lecter's attention while he is still in Florence. So I suppose it serves a purpose plot wise. But it gets \"Hannibal\" off to a wrong start.\n\nAs a character, Lecter always has been larger-than-life. But \"Hannibal\" tries to turn him into an offbeat superhero - besides his food fetish, he's also Clarice's father-like, strong-male avenging angel. One might even call him saintly - Our Hannibal of the Scrambled Brains. His cannibalism is even seen as a sort of good thing. As one character observes, he prefers to \"eat the rude\" whenever possible.\n\nThis is all rather silly, really - in its equation of serial-killing with food fetishism, it's conceptually inferior to both the more satirical \"American Psycho\" and the more serious \"Felicia's Journey.\"\n\nIndeed, it's too half-baked for even a guy like Lecter to swallow.\n\nSteven Rosen's e-mail is srosenone@aol.com."
