        "text": "Directed by David Lynch\n\nStarring Kyle MacLachlan, Jürgen Prochnow, Sean Young, Virginia Madsen, Kenneth McMillan, Sting, Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, Max von Sydow, Francesca Annis, Brad Dourif, José Ferrer, Linda Hunt, Freddie Jones, Richard Jordan, Everett McGill, Jack Nance, Paul Smith\n\nI had this set up to post automatically a few days ago, but I did something wrong, so I apologize for the short notice.\n\nA David Lynch movie might seem like a bit of a stretch for this blog — too recent (even though its 40 years old), too expensive, too almost mainstream. But when you think about who shot it, well, it fits in pretty well. I went to see Lynch’s previous picture, The Elephant Man (1980), for two reasons: (1) Freddie Francis shot it in (2) black-and-white Panavision. I hadn’t even heard of Lynch or Eraserhead at that point, but I sure as hell knew who Freddie Francis was!\n\nLynch brought Francis back for Dune (1984), so of course I was going to go — especially when there were 70mm engagements less than an hour away. Freddie Francis in 70! The film was a mess, of course — beware of any movie that provides you with a glossary as you walk in! But I was blown away by Francis’ cinematography, the production design (from the wooden sets to the almost antique-looking spaceships), Albert Whitlock’s matte work and the presence of Freddie Jones (of Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed).\n\nWell, it’s back in theaters February 18 and 19 to mark its 40th anniversary. And while it won’t be in 70mm, I’m looking forward to seeing it on the big screen again — and to seeing how baffled my daughter will be by the whole thing!\n\nFrancis’ last film as DP, Lynch’s The Straight Story (1999) is wonderful, and I’ve heard it’s finally getting a much-needed Blu-Ray release. Easily one of my favorite films of the last 30 years. I’m in the middle of a post on another Freddie Francis picture (directing this time), which will be on its way before long. Stay tuned.\n\nDirected by Abner Biberman\n\nStarring Rory Calhoun, Julie Adams, Ray Danton, Thomas Gomez, Frank Faylen\n\nCharacter actor Abner Biberman directs Rory Calhoun, Julie Adams and Ray Danton in The Looters (1955), a cool adventure-noir kinda thing that, as far as I can tell, has never been on home video in any format. Kino Lorber’s Blu-Ray will remedy that in April.\n\nRory Calhoun in a mountain guide living alone in Colorado, mainly to get away from people. Just as his old Army buddy (Danton) comes to visit, a plane crashes a few peaks over, and the pair go looking for them. They would’ve been better off letting them fend for themselves, because a quarter of a million bucks in cash turns up in the wreckage — bringing out the worst in just about everybody.\n\nCalhoun is always cool, Julie Adams has a good part here, and Ray Danton is as slick and slimy as ever. And a couple of terrific character actors, Thomas Gomez and Frank Faylen, get nice roles to mess around with.\n\nRestored from 35mm finegrain material, this should look great. I’ve provided a commentary, and it was a lot of fun to research a movie that’s been pretty much out of circulation for decades. Recommended.\n\nDirected by Fritz Lang\n\nStarring Joan Bennett, Michael Redgrave, Anne Revere, Barbara O’Neil, Natalie Schafer\n\nI’ve said it many times: I love Fritz Lang’s Hollywood movies. Secret Beyond The Door (1947) is the kind of creepy, noir-ish weirdness we can always count on Lang for. Kino Lorber is bringing it to Blu-Ray later in the year.\n\nJoan Bennett marries Michael Redgrave in Mexico, and when she arrives at his mansion, she finds he has six rooms dedicated to six famous murder scenes, with a seventh he won’t let anyone see. And from there, it gets weird.\n\nThis was one of four pictures Joan Bennett did with Fritz Lang. Man Hunt (1941) is terrific. Beautifully shot by Stanley Cortez, this should be a gorgeous disc, probably an improvement over the one released by Olive Films years ago. Highly recommended.\n\nTwo Imprint posts in a row. This time, they’re pulling together a Blu-Ray set (limited to just 1,500 copies) of four cool pictures starring George Peppard.\n\nP.J. (1968, AKA New Face In Hell)\n\nDirected by John Guillermin\n\nStarring George Peppard, Gayle Hunnicutt, Raymond Burr, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Brock Peters, Susan Saint James\n\nPeppard’s a PI in this “neo-noir” (whatever that is), no doubt inspired by the success of Harper (1966). There was a string of mid-60s detective movies like this, and I’m a big fan of ’em. Peppard gets set up in a murder plot by a big businessman (Raymond Burr) and his mistress (Gayle Hunnicutt).\n\nFrom the outstanding cast (character parts makes movies like this) to Loyal Griggs’ Technicolor and Techniscope cinematography to the 60s modern sets to Neil Hefti’s terrific score, cool ness just drips off this film. John Guillermin also directed Peppard in The Blue Max (1966) and House Of Cards (1968).\n\nI’m super-stoked to be doing a commentary for it.\n\nPendulum (1969)\n\nDirected by George Schaefer\n\nStarring George Peppard, Jean Seberg, Richard Kiley, Charles McGraw\n\nGeorge Peppard’s a Washington, DC, police captain in this one, accused of murdering his wife and her lover.\n\nThe Executioner (1970)\n\nDirected by Sam Wanamaker\n\nStarring George Peppard, Joan Collins, Judy Geeson, Oskar Homolka, Charles Gray\n\nAfter he’s almost killed while on assignment, an MI5 agent (Peppard) sets out to prove one of his contacts is a double agent.\n\nNewman’s Law (1974)\n\nDirected by Richard Heffron\n\nStarring George Peppard, Roger Robinson, Eugene Roche, Abe Vigoda\n\nNewman (Peppard) is an honest LA copy accused being on the take. He sets out to prove his innocence and uncovers a nasty conspiracy. This came out shortly after Peppard’s Banacek series wrapped up.\n\nGeorge Peppard’s movie-star looks kept him from being the actor he wanted to be, and he’s mostly known today for The A-Team, but he was a very good actor when he had a good part. This set, absolutely packed with extras, is gonna be a good one. Recommended.\n\nDirected by Jeannot Szwarc\n\nStarring Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton\n\nHere’s something that’ll make you feel old: when a movie you saw first-run as a teenager comes out on 4K disc in a special 45th anniversary edition. Yikes!\n\nI was so excited to see Jaws 2 (1978), there was no way it couldn’t have been a disappointment (though the POV shots with the cameraman obviously sitting on the back of the fake shark were very, very cool). But Jaws 3-D (1983) and Jaws: The Revenge (1987) came along and made it seem like a masterpiece.\n\nTo mark the 45th anniversary of Jaws 2 hitting the multiplex near you (and the anniversary of the bubble gum cards turning up in your local 7-11), Universal is bringing it to 4K disc. I’m sure it’ll look terrific.\n\nDirected by Erle C. Kenton\n\nStarring Lois Collier, Fred Brady, Paul Kelly, Noah Beery Jr., Douglass Dumbrille, Rose Hobart\n\nVinegar Syndrome Labs has announced their Blu-Ray release of The Cat Creeps (1946), a goofy horror/crime/mystery thing from Universal, “newly scanned and restored in 2K from its 35mm dupe negative.”\n\nErle C. Kenton directed Island Of Lost Souls (1932) and some stuff from Universal’s “monster rally” period — Ghost Of Frankenstein (1942), House Of Frankenstein (1944) and House Of Dracula (1945). A veteran of Mack Sennett comedies, he also did Who Done It? (1942), one of the best Abbott & Costello movies, and You’re Telling Me! (1934) with WC Fields.\n\nWriting to Famous Monsters as a kid, director Joe Dante called the picture a “shamefully un-mysterious mystery with supernatural overtones. Just another grade B murder-in-the-mansion potboiler.” He’s right, of course, but there’s a charm to these movies that I absolutely adore, and the more I see ’em, the more I love ’em.\n\nI’m so glad the folks at Vinegar Syndrome Labs are giving pictures like this the white glove treatment, complete with commentaries, documentaries and other extras. Hopefully, there will be many more. Highly recommended for fans of the whole Universal horror thing.\n\nOur friends at Eureka in the UK are serving up some more 1930s and ’40s hi-def horror from Universal. There will be commentaries and other extras. Reaching for the pre-order button yet?\n\nMurders In The Zoo (1933)\n\nDirected by A. Edward Sutherland\n\nStarring Charlie Ruggles, Lionel Atwill, Gail Patrick, Randolph Scott\n\nThis Pre-Code gem is considered pretty ghastly, a reputation it gleefully deserves. Lionel Atwill is insanely jealous, and if you mess with his wife, there’s a good chance you’ll be eaten by tigers, bitten by a deadly snack or God knows what else. Bonus: Randolph Scott is in it!\n\nHorror Island (1941)\n\nDirected by George Waggner\n\nStarring Dick Foran, Peggy Moran, Leo Carrillo, Eddie Parker, Dale Van Sickle, John Eldredge, Fuzzy Knight\n\nDick Foran owns a tiny island off the Florida coast, complete with a castle and the legend of buried treasure. He sets up a fake tourist-y treasure-hunt cruise to his island, but when strange things happen and people end up dead…\n\nThis was originally paired with Man Made Monster (1941), for a perfect night at the movies.\n\nNight Monster (1942)\n\nDirected by Ford Beebe\n\nStarring Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, Ralph Morgan, Irene Hervey, Don Porter, Leif Erikson\n\nThough they’re given top billing, Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill really have featured roles in this more-or-less remake of Doctor X (1932). Shot by the underrated Charles Van Enger.\n\nHouse Of Horrors (1946)\n\nDirected by Jean Yarbrough\n\nStarring Rondo Hatton, Martin Kosleck, Robert Lowery, Virginia Grey\n\nAfter playing “The Creeper” in the Sherlock Holmes picture The Pearl Of Death (1944), Universal decided to make the disfigured (due to acromegaly) Rondo Hatton their next horror star. He made two movies in 1945, House Of Horrors and The Brute Man. They would be released after his death in 1946. If you can get past how exploitive the whole thing is, the movies are as ghoulish and entertaining as other Universal horror pictures of the 40s.\n\nUniversal has always kept these films in tip-top condition, making Blu-Rays of these things a must. Each is a creepy delight — responsible for the rotted brains of lots and lots of monster kids (myself included). Highly, highly recommended."
