        "text": "Vin Diesel has been trying for years to make another Riddick movie, and just this week it was announced that Universal Pictures is planning to release the film next fall. But now another one of Diesel's long-awaited passion projects is finally getting somewhere. The actor has been working for years to try and make a trilogy about Hannibal Barca, aka Hannibal the Conqueror, and today it seems he got his first yes.\n\nDiesel has written a new post on his Facebook wall - where he tends to share a lot of information about the details of his career - and in doing so has informed his fans that he is starting to get attention for his Hannibal project. The update says,\n\nThe post came along with an image of Diesel standing next to an elephant, presumably representing the creatures that Hannibal used during his military campaigns.\n\nObviously what's missing here are the key details. We have no idea which studio told him, \"yes,\" we don't know if there's a script ready for the project or if one needs to be written, and it's not clear if Diesel has a director in mind. The actor is planning to star in the movie as Carthaginian leader, but that's pretty much where the information stops.\n\nAre you looking forward to seeing Vin Diesel hop up on the back of a war elephant and try to conquer the Mediterranean? Let us know in the comments below."
