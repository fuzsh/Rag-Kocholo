        "text": "By: Nic Kodkany\n\nDespite the fact that I was an enormous wuss-puss as a child who could literally not handle the Harry Potter films for its ghosts and giant spiders, the children’s horror film Coraline was and remains one of my favorite films ever. Imaginative animation, dark, whimsical scenes, a relatable yet sardonic protagonist, and a talking cat all in one emotion-packed whirlwind makes it an incredibly memorable watching experience for not just children, but adults alike. The main conflict of the film – Coraline having to choose her place in two polarizing worlds, the dull reality with her busy, uninterested parents and the vivid wonderland version of her home with equally fantastical parents – follows a theme that many children’s films aim to encapsulate: the “be careful what you wish for” lesson that is old as time itself. As a child, I never cared much for this advisory theme, but Coraline did an excellent job at drilling that lesson in because it tugs on the heartstrings that kids deny having as they grow older – the heartstrings of love for one’s parents. The greatest part of the film is the polarity of Coraline’s real parents and her Other parents, primarily her mother and her Other Mother because it encapsulates the imagination that children stray into versus the home they cling to in comfort.\n\nI loved the Other world so much that I would have likely thrown Coraline out of the way and sewn buttons on my eyes at the chance of perusing a fantasy version of my home. I will give an important disclaimer: I love my parents very much, and they love me too! Yet I identified strongly with Coraline’s personality as a child; bored with myself and irritated at the world around me for being so boring, I loved annoying my parents for something to do as they worked and dreaded my whining. Watching Coraline, I wanted to crawl through the mesmerizing violet and blue portal into a new, colorful, exciting world that was familiar yet so full of fantasy. I watched the dinner scene and craved a mango milkshake that descended from the dining room chandelier. The Other mother lured me just as she did to Coraline with her soothing voice and enthusiasm to entertain her child; I wanted to walk through the gardens with dragonflies and glowing flora next to my Other father. As children, we do not care about why our real parents cannot always give us fantasy; with an undeveloped theory of mind, we are egocentric and want our parents to devote themselves to our every creative want. This is why the Other Mother’s character is so genius; her hunting method is to find lonely, bored children and lure them into a world of magic and wonder combined with unconditionally warm and fun parents who would give them anything they ask. Children could look past so many warning signs – friends’ mouths sewn shut, creepy identical dolls that watch you, to name a couple – to have what the Other Mother gives, which is why she has been able to survive for so long, and why Coraline is a unique protagonist for her sharpness and bravery.\n\nYet towards the second half of the film, after the Other Mother’s evil is revealed, I felt so much emotion for my parents because Coraline delivers a message of life’s balance: when things go up, they must come down too. Furthermore, the balance of the natural world reinforces that things can always be too good to be true. In the video attached, we watch Coraline sleep next to pillows she constructs to look like her parents after the Other Mother abdubts them. I still feel overwhelmingly sad watching that scene because I feel that childlike yearning for my parents; Missing your parents when they are not there is a helpless, scary, and isolated feeling for a child. The deep pit of regret that Coraline feels for taking her parents for granted here drew a feeling of emptiness in me as a child as I pictured sleeping in my parents’ bed without them. Coraline’s regret teaches the watching children that their parents may not be everything they want, but that they are the unconditional providers of protection and warmth, especially in such vulnerable points as Coraline’s throughout the film. While Coraline’s mother is curt and apathetic in the beginning, which is the source of Coraline’s contempt, it becomes evident that Coraline traded these mild flaws for a much greater consequence: losing her mother to a disguised monster. Even picturing losing my mother made me cry dramatically as a child, so this turning point of the film was horrifying to me, and the film drove me to accommodate my selfish dreams in the promise that I could keep my mother. Over a decade later, I am in a new world of freedom and excitement in college, but I call my mother every day because Coraline taught me never to take her for granted in the light of something new and exciting.\n\nBy: Madeline Weekley\n\nWhen asked what my favorite horror movie is, I hesitate to say The Purge. I feel like it’s a lowbrow response, especially with the existence of such well-thought-out horror movies like Get Out and Midsommar. The characters in The Purge are objectively flat, the acting is nothing special, and the dialogue is cheesy. Yet, I am fascinated by the films, and I continue to watch and enjoy each one in the series. I couldn’t understand what pulled me into these films and left me thinking about them for weeks after a first watch. That was until I realized what makes The Purge franchise entirely unique — its genre.\n\nFor those who haven’t seen any of The Purge movies, they revolve around a government-sponsored night where all crime is legal for 12 hours. They use different sets of characters in each movie, and there are typically three separate groups of characters that the movie switches focus between as the deadly night plays out. It always ends with a lot of people dead and a few main character survivors.\n\nThe Purge falls into a rare and special category which I refer to as realistic dystopian horror. It is a genre that does not technically exist. I define it as a movie that depicts a society different from our own, one that has the capability to exist, with the same slasher and horror aesthetics as classic horror films.\n\nTo further explain, The Purge falls between two different common genres. The first is realistic dystopian that doesn’t classify as horror and the second is dystopian horror that contains fantasy and is therefore unrealistic. Some films that fall into the first genre include The Hunger Games and The Handmaids Tale which are, unsurprisingly, my favorite motion pictures. Films in the second genre would be any movie where the world is overcome by zombies or some type of alien group.\n\nThis realistic dystopian premise is what makes The Purge movies so unique. I don’t care about the characters. I don’t even remember their names. The concept that the government makes crimes legal is obviously far-fetched, but it is possible. When I watched the movies, it made me genuinely wonder what would happen if our government sanctioned such a horrific event. Where would I hide? Who would I trust? Which people in my life might go out and purge? These thoughts kept me engaged during the movie and long after.\n\nAdditionally, The Purge franchise explores socioeconomic issues and politics in a way that makes subtle commentary on our modern world. In The First Purge, the plot revolves around a political organization offering $5000 for anyone willing to participate in the first purge experiment. It is mainly underprivileged people who risk their lives by accepting this offer. In other Purge movies, rich people pay money to kill poor people. The films also highlight the differences between the security systems of a wealthy family versus a poor family. The gaps in privilege are made clear, and I think this focus on politics and relationships between socioeconomic classes makes this movie deeper than many people realize.\n\nA lot of people disagree, however, and cannot move past the seemingly repetitive plot line throughout the movies and the shallow dialogue. A review on IMBD by “Wubsthefadger” rated the movie a 4/10 and said, “the story is full of clichés such as stupid teenage kids, bad decisions, and clueless villains.” To that I say, exactly. The world is full of those things too. The Purge movies are about how American citizens would respond if given the opportunity to commit crimes without legal repercussions. There are plenty of clueless villains and stupid teenagers in America, so of course that is who is shown in the movie. I appreciate the realness of the characters and the bad choices they make.\n\nIn fact, I love the authenticity of the concept itself. The American government makes lots of questionable decisions, so maybe the movie is not as far-fetched as it appears. I’m not saying that they would hold an actual purge, but the fact that it’s not impossible makes The Purge movies that much more horrifying and intriguing. The rarity of the genre itself allows me to look past any cliches or acting flaws and enjoy the continuous question of “what if” that the realism of the movie franchise proposes.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nWubsTheFadger.

Universal Pictures, 2013.\n\nBy: Riley Hodder\n\nIf you just gagged upon reading the title, then you are like most people I’ve encountered, and like most people, by the time I finish my argument, you’ll be at least somewhat convinced.\n\nThe Human Centipede is a Dutch horror film released in 2009, written and directed by Tom Six, and centering a sadistic Doctor who kidnaps three people and yes: he sews them together, mouth to anus.\n\nTo no surprise, this is where most people stop engaging with the film. And yet, I’ve found in my personal experience that most people have heard of the film. The film was even so popular that it garnered two sequels, significantly worse than the first, in my opinion: an honor usually relegated to iconic and critically acclaimed horror films such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Nightmare on Elm Street. The film wasn’t even just a cultural icon, but an economic one as one, selling 55,000 DVD and Blue-Ray copies in the first week they were on sale. The movie has even earned its place on the streaming services: and is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video and and Apple TV.\n\nBut why? In my encounters with people, absolutely no one wants to talk about the movie, let alone sit down and watch one hour and 30 minutes of the movie’s gruesome plot. So here I am, standing on my soapbox, attempting to give you an explanation that you can be happy with.\n\nTo me, there are a few reasons why this film is so popular:\n\nThe gross-out\n\nMany popular horror theorists regard revulsion, disgust, or as I like to call it, the gross-out, as an element of horror. That’s right, folks – not just a trope in horror movies, but a crucial element to the craft of horror. In fact, Stephen King said, while explicitly trying to avoid defining horror, includes revulsion in his definition:\n\n“Terror on top, horror below it, and lowest of all, the gag reflex of revulsion.”\n\nAnd yet we disregard the idea of the human centipede as a cheap-shot, we toss out the movie at the first sound of what it’s about. Didn’t Six just focus on the lower element of horror? Are we going to toss out the latter Saw films along with the human centipede?\n\nAnd are we not even going to talk about the hold that Six’s idea has on us? The idea is so repulsive that we shudder, we physically react at even the mention of the movie, let alone the details of the plot. Isn’t that to be praised? Isn’t that to be respected? Isn’t that what horror writers all across the world are trying to do: to find that idea that is so terrifying, or so repulsive, that it just sticks with you?\n\nDidn’t Six do that?\n\nThe thematic elements\n\nPart of what got me on my defending-The-Human-Centipede-kick is the lovely podcast done on the subject by U-M alums and couple James Janisse and Chelsea Rebecca. In their podcast episode on the movie, the pair offer the movie what I feel it deserves: two people honestly viewing, and honestly reviewing it. And what they found is that the movie holds up under the microscope.\n\nWhat is perhaps the most interesting thing about the movie, that Janisse and Rebecca notice, is a unique interaction between the main characters, which sets up a pretty interesting connection to the real world.\n\nThere are four central characters to the film: Dr. Heiter, our sadistic doctor, Jenny, our end, Lindsay, our middle, and Katsuro, the front. However, what one might notice is that Dr. Heiter is a German doctor, and he has chosen Katsuro, a Japanese man who only speaks Japanese, as the front. It doesn’t help, either, that the two women in the back of the centipede are American. And the film proves that this isn’t just a coincidence.\n\nWhen Keiter lets his creation outside for the first time, he is holding a paper which he refers to as “The World,” which he tosses for the centipede to fetch. He commands the centipede, primarily Katsuro, to “get me the world.”\n\nThis is what people who skip the movie just upon hearing the concept are missing: clear commentary on the way that the World War II alliance played out between Germany and Japan, that the Germans viewed the Japanese as just as good as the Americans, their enemy at war. And in fact, viewed them as no more than an animal, as Keiter treats his centipede.\n\nThe fear\n\nIn all my experience as a horror fan, and a horror writer myself, I have never found such an idea, and such a film, that has chilled me to my very core. Even researching this film to talk about it here has scared me and chilled me and yes, grossed me out. And it is for this final reason that I implore you to watch this movie.\n\nBecause at their core, aren’t movies meant to make us feel something? And you cannot deny that The Human Centipede does that.\n\nSources (Linked here and in post):\n\nThe Human Centipede, 2009, Tom Six\n\nThe Human Centipede IMDb\n\n59: The Human Centipede, James A Janisse and Chelsea Rebecca, the Dead Meat Podcast, 2019\n\nThe Oral History of The Human Centipede, Vulture, Kenny Herzog, 2015\n\nBy: Tavi Kipnis\n\nOn the bright morning of Monday, March 20th, 1995, five men stepped onto different lines of the Tokyo subway carrying umbrellas and bundles wrapped in newspaper. Between stations, those men would drop the packages on the ground and puncture them multiple times with the sharpened tip of their umbrellas before getting off the train at the next station. The rest of the passengers in the subway car would notice their eyes stinging and their lungs struggling to draw breath. People began to collapse, some vomiting and some paralyzed by the sarin gas nerve agent they had inhaled. The group that would take credit for the attack later that day was a cult known as Aum Shinrikyo, which haphazardly combined Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian beliefs into an apocalypse-worshiping belief system. By the time the packages were safely disposed of, the attack would kill 14 people and injure over a thousand more, making the 1995 Tokyo subway attack the deadliest act of terrorism in modern Japanese history.\n\nTwo years later, on December 27, 1997, Cure (original name: The Missionary) was released in Japanese theaters.\n\nFigure 1 — Photograph Courtesy Kyodo/Landov\n\nAs director Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s fifth film, Cure stars Koji Yakusho as world-weary Detective Takabe as he hunts down and psychologically faces off against serial killer Mamiya, played by Masato Hagiwara. While at first glance this may sound like a boilerplate noir crime thriller, Kurosawa’s direction immediately set it apart from the crowd. Additionally, Cure’s monster lacks the direct element of physical danger prevalent in other serial killer films because Mamiya never kills directly, he only hypnotizes others into killing for him, in mesmerizing scenes sold almost completely by Hagiwara’s performance. Mamiya’s only calling card is a large, sloppy X carved into the murder victim by the hypnotized subject, like a perverted mockery of the cross. Incidentally, the leader of Aum Shinrikyo claimed himself to be the reincarnation of Christ.\n\nFigure 2 – Kurosawa, Cure 0:44:18\n\nDespite the depiction of cult members in popular culture as insane, stupid, or sadistic, sociologists have found that cults mostly recruit people who are educated, non-religious, and searching for community or spirituality. Aum Shinrikyo was no exception, with group leaders mainly recruiting young, highly educated university students and scions of elite intellectual families. In Cure, Mamiya himself is a genius psychology student, and the people he hypnotizes into killing include multiple cops, a teacher, a doctor, and a salaryman. As author Haruki Murakami wrote in his essay on the subway attack, the overwhelming sentiment in culture and media at the time was that “placed alongside the likes of Shoko Asahara and the Aum cult, compared to the deeds they had done, the overwhelming majority of Japanese were indeed ‘right,’ ‘sane,’ and ‘healthy.’” Cure bucks this trend by arguing that it is futile to create a binary between sane and insane, healthy and deranged, right and wrong. As Detective Takabe’s psychologist friend says to him near the beginning of the film, “[Hypnosis] can’t change that basic moral sense. A person who thinks murder is evil won’t kill anyone under hypnotic suggestion.” The line between cop and killer gets smudged. The walls in Detective Takabe’s mind, already cracked at the beginning of the movie, only ended up needing a small push from Mamiya to come down completely.\n\nWhat makes Cure a horror movie doesn’t come from a repulsive monster or an unstoppable masked slasher. Instead, Kurosawa relies almost entirely on terror as Stephen King defines it – “When the lights go out and you feel something behind you, you hear it, you feel its breath against your ear, but when you turn around, there’s nothing there.” Cure stands apart because its terror doesn’t come from darkened doorways or murky water but from commonplace interactions. Was that odd pause a sign that a character has been hypnotized or was it simply a stare that was half a second too long? Is the briefcase held by the salaryman next to you containing ordinary work documents or plastic bags filled with liquid sarin? The terror of having no idea whether a scene will descend into violence rings true both in Cure and in real life. Cure argues that fundamentally, the estrangement of passengers on a train is the same as the estrangement between a married couple. The brokenness of society that leads to resentment between a cop and his partner also leads to mass violence committed by educated intellectuals in the name of a twisted religion. As Murakami wrote, “[Aum Shinrikyo] shows us a distorted image of ourselves in a manner none of us could have foreseen.” Kurosawa forces the viewer to see that image – and wonder what else we are capable of.\n\nWORKS CITED\n\n“Aum Shinrikyo.” Council on Foreign Relations, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/aum-shinrikyo.

However, there are also some tropes found within the genre and media that are harmful to queer communities. There is of course the trope of “bury your gays” but another very common trope is that of the trans serial killer or the cross-dressing serial killer. There are many examples of these characters and while they often are not transgender the relation to the trans community and the implications that those representations can have cannot be ignored. Buffalo Bill in Silence of The Lambs according to the characters within the film and its creator is not transgender. Hannibal even says as much “Billy hates his own identity, you see, and he thinks that makes him a transsexual, but his pathology is a thousand times more savage and more terrifying.” So according to this he is not trans, but he does want to be, and that is what makes him dangerous. Buffalo Bill is also a violent murderer who attacks and skins women to turn them into a suit. The issue here is that just saying, “Well the character isn’t trans,” does not remove the implications that that portrayal has and what it could mean to a viewer. I love Silence of The Lambs, I think it is an incredible horror movie and is very effective in the way that it scares you and causes discomfort, I also think that it is the poster child for problematic portrayals of trans people. Silence of The Lambs is one of a very small subsection of horror movies that was able to secure an academy award and in fact won several, but it also portrays a very harmful stereotype of the sneaky violent trans person, despite what the movie wants you to think.\n\nThere are also movies that fall into more of a grey area with a far murkier portrayal and far less clear characters. A primary example of this is the movie Sleepaway Camp, in this film the killer Angela is, at least in the first movie, also ostensibly not transgender. Angela has been forced to live as her “dead” brother Peter, even though Angela is in fact Peter, in the context of the story. Again, in the first movie Angela is not trans, and it makes no mention of her being trans, however, the movie ends with the reveal of Angela completely naked holding a severed head and has a character shout “My god, she’s a man!” This is a far murkier portrayal than that in Silence of The Lambs however, it is still not exactly good. Angela has been forced to live as a gender that is incongruent with her true self and that in conjunction with relentless bullying and abuse has caused her to lash out in violent ways. In some ways this could be seen as an allegory for the trans experience. Feeling trapped presenting in a way that is incongruent with yourself and that only causes you further damage. While this argument does work, it carries with it implications all its own. The idea that the damage caused by being forced to live as the wrong gender by your family and society making someone violent and dangerous is still a somewhat damaging idea to present. Many queer people love Sleepaway Camp, and it is not problematic to like it, however, I do feel it is important to examine it with a critical eye, and to think about the shadows that even the positive aspects hold.\n\nThese 2 movies are also not the only examples of this trope, they are simply some of the most infamous. This is also an ongoing trope that continues to be used in movies and murder mysteries, if with less frequency. It is important to look at these movies and what they had to say, because in some ways they are both good movies, but they both have problematic forms of social commentary. As a final note on this topic, it is important to realize the reality of violence in relation to trans people. Trans people are far more often the victims of violence than the perpetrators of it. In fact, trans people are 4 times more likely to be victims of sexual violence or other forms of violence than cis people. Additionally, the life expectancy for transwomen of color is 35 years old. It is important to consider these facts and this context when thinking about the portrayal of trans people in media and the damage that these horror movies can cause. For a more in-depth discussion of trans issues in horror movies I recommend the Deadmeat podcast linked here: https://youtu.be/YgpvW9TxWds.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDemme, Jonathan.

At least when I was a kid, I would have to skip over this scene or hide behind a pillow until it was over. Which is pretty odd for something considered a children’s movie.\n\nBut besides this traumatizing boat scene, this movie fits right in with the body horror and slasher subgenres of horror if you think about it as a whole. The kids get picked off one by one by Wonka, they get eliminated in ways indicative of body mutilation, it’s never shown explicitly whether or not the kids leave the factory alive at the end of the movie, and Charlie was the last man standing. These are all features that are comparable to notable tropes of horror films like the one-by-one trope in Scream (1996), or the body gore in the Saw franchise. So- is Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory really a horror movie then?\n\nThe filmmakers and marketers of the movie would probably answer no, but to me and many other horror fans: the answer is most definitely yes. And here’s why.\n\nThere just might be more horror tropes than chocolate bars and candy in Wonka’s factory. I mean- this whole movie structurally almost matches a slasher film’s blueprint: a group gets trapped in a building with a “killer”, they get picked off one by one, etc. But most importantly, slashers all end with the Final Girl trope- and the Final Girl in this case is Charlie. As a refresher, a Final Girl is usually the female protagonist who is the last survivor of the film, usually to confront the killer herself and end it all. Charlie functions as the final girl- besides of course, not being the typical “girl”. But it makes sense- he’s the special one who outlives the rest of the group, and confronts Wonka at the end of the film once everyone else was left behind (or died)?\n\nThis next trope has been completely overlooked by a majority of the viewers, and it might just be the most out of place part of the film. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory includes the “Harbinger of Impending Doom” trope, which essentially is the personification of a warning- this figure usually warns the protagonist about danger before they pursue their big mission. Many may not remember, but at the beginning of the film, Charlie goes to the factory before he wins his golden ticket, and there is indeed an old man who walks up to Charlie to warn him about Wonka’s factory. Here’s what he says to Charlie:\n\n“Up the airy mountain, down the rushing glen, we dare not go a-hunting, for fear of little men. You see… nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out.” (6:30-7:03)\n\nI know, pretty cryptic right? He predicts the “little men” (Oompa Loompas) and essentially warns Charlie he’ll die there if he goes in. If you didn’t think his spooky psychic message was enough, Willy Wonka’s Harbinger is seen pushing a cart of axes and knives when he confronts Charlie. The horror isn’t exactly subtle.\n\nBesides the slasher horror tropes present- there’s TON of body horror throughout this movie. Mike TV was shrunken, Augustus Gloop was sucked up a tube, Violet Beauregarde swelled into a blueberry, and Veruca Salt was even sent down to an incinerator where waste was burned. I would undeniably count anytime the children’s bodies were altered as body horror.\n\nI also noticed this film had a great resemblance to the Saw franchise, notorious for its over-the-top body gore. Specifically, Charlie and Grandpa Joe’s fizzy lifting drink scene fit the vibe of Saw: Wonka’s drinks made them float up towards a lethal fan, and they were under a time limit to burp themselves down to avoid getting chopped to pieces- comparable to Jigsaw’s reverse bear trap where the victim Amanda also had a time limit to unlock the trap and save herself from a gory death.\n\nAfter coming to these conclusions regarding the film’s similarities to the slasher film structure, horror tropes, and body gore, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to remove the lens of horror when thinking about this movie. And besides- when we were kids, Wonka’s boat ride scene was our first sign this film’s home was the horror genre.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nLoggie, Matt. “6 Common Horror Film Tropes.” Raindance, 13 July 2021, https://raindance.org/6-common-horror-film-tropes/.\n\nStuart, Mel, director.

My friend Zack went on and on about this new film that dropped on Netflix and said it changed his perspective on what horror movies could be. At this point in my life, I had seen many classics such as The Shining, Halloween, Psycho, and Get Out, so I was super excited to spice things up and maybe get a new classic film to add to my arsenal. Then we watched the new addition to Netflix’s horror section: Zombeavers.\n\nComing into the world of cinema with a runtime of 77 minutes, Zombeavers doesn’t waste a second of its runtime and somehow still manages to waste over an hour of your time. The script, awful. The acting, awful. The setting: swampy but not too bad. But the BEAVERS. I have no idea if they used puppets or animatronics but lord almighty if this isn’t some of the worst monster designs I have ever seen in a movie. I left the movie unsatisfied and angry with Zack who was hysterically laughing throughout the whole movie.\n\nFast forward to a month or so later. I’m flipping through the various streaming services with Zack and our friend Kyle, unable to find a movie. We switch over to Netflix and browse the horror movies tab. As we flip through what seems to be every horror movie, dreading the moment that the movies recycle and we realize we’ve exhausted Netflix’s supply, we reach the final film on the app. I peered over at Zack and a wide smirk grew on our faces. Kyle was in the hot seat for the worst hour and seventeen minutes of his life. He didn’t have a choice because we were watching:\n\nThis was the start of a new obsession between the three of us. The craving for a movie that was too bad to look away from created a hunger in our stomachs to scour the internet for weeks, and boy did we find some horrible, abysmal, atrocious, beautiful works of art. We found popular ones such as Sharknado, Sharknado 2, Sharknado 3, (not Sharknado 4 that one actually had some pretty good cinematography) Piranha 3D, Poultrygeist, Blood Diner, Thankskilling, but nothing lived up to Zombeavers. That was, until we came across Velocipastor.\n\nVelocipastor is a spectacle. As the Rotten Tomatoes certified critic Josh Goller says, “The Velocipastor really must be seen to be believed.” (Goller). Just by reading the summary, I knew I was in for the ride of my life.\n\nIt was movies like this that really got our gears turning, and while we still love and appreciate the genuinely good horror films that are coming out nowadays, it’s hard to forget some of the classics in horror’s new-to-us subgenre of “It’s so bad that it’s kind of good”. Although I may not have the most concrete criteria for putting a movie in a genre among Zombeavers and Velocipastor, it’s important to distinguish between Bad horror and Godawful horror. Bad horror films attempt to scare you and attempt to create a good plot but end up short. Godawful horror films know they are failing to scare you and know they have a bad plot, but they still shove it in your face anyways. I like to think of it as two negatives making a positive type of situation except everything in the movie is negative and the only positive is laughing at how bad it is.\n\nIn short, I’d recommend a Godawful horror movie for any type of occassion, but to be quite frank I think they’re best to watch at any time other than Halloween season. Specifically if you just finished a long paper or project, I’d like you to leave this post knowing there’s entertainment out there that can turn your brain from mush to liquid in a rather short runtime. Enjoy the unenjoyable!\n\nBy: Michael Ahrens\n\nA group of young people are packed into a car, traveling through a remote, rural part of Texas. You don’t know how old they are, but this cramped road trip—perhaps a naïve expression of newfound freedom—suggests they might be college students. You don’t know exactly where they’re from either, but in their amused disdain for the people and places around them, you can tell that they aren’t where they’re supposed to be. Eventually, they pull over and pick up a hitchhiker. Some might recognize this from Tobe Hooper’s slasher, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Others might say, “No shot! That’s from Rob Zombie’s debut, House of 1000 Corpses.” Well, there’s no need to argue. In this case, you’re both right.\n\nThe films begin by marking their protagonists as out of place city folk traveling through the country for their respective, banal reasons. These characters, knowing they don’t belong where they are, are warned early on of the consequences if they overstep. In The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the road tripping kids pull over for gas and directions. They meet Drayton Sawyer, the eldest Sawyer brother, and he tells them, “You don’t want to go foolin’ around other folk’s property. Some folks don’t like it, and they don’t mind showing you.” It would be useful advice, but it goes unfollowed. When Kirk and Pam come across the Sawyer residence later on, they walk in uninvited. Drayton’s youngest brother, the notorious Leatherface, claims his first victim without leaving his home.\n\nIn House of 1000 Corpses, the road trippers pull over at Captain Spaulding’s Museum of Monsters and Madmen, where they meet the murderous clown himself. They explain that they’re writing a book on off-beat roadside attractions, which sends Spaulding into an angry, creepy, miniature monologue: “I know what your problem is. Y’all think us folks from the country’s real funny-like, don’t you? Well, saddle up the mule, boy! Slide me some grits! I’s got to get me some education!” Just like Hooper’s curious kids, they are undeterred. In fact, the House of 1000 Corpses group seems even more anxious to make a grave error. They receive directions to a tree where local legend Dr. Satan was supposedly hanged, and along the way, they pick up Baby Firefly, Spaulding’s daughter. When they don’t survive, it seems a foregone conclusion.\n\nThese encounters, squared with the brutal murders to follow, introduce a central question of the films: If you’re so much better than us, why did you come here? An apparent sense of middle-class superiority is to blame in both cases. The characters act as if they are protected from harm simply because they come from a more populated area code. They seem to put themselves in dangerous situations because they feel entitled to survive. It’s more obvious in House of 1000 Corpses (almost to the point of being ham-fisted), but in both films, a drive through the country is akin to a museum field trip (or perhaps a trip to the zoo). They ignore all warnings, grossly overstep their bounds, and meet their demise as a direct consequence.\n\nSo, they went into the country, and they weren’t careful enough. Do these films suggest that any suburban family driving through Texas is at risk of being killed, barbecued, and served in a chili? I would argue otherwise, even if the Sawyers and the Fireflys would disagree. I would because of Leatherface and Tiny Firefly. Leatherface is giant, masked, and violent. He is also nonverbal, scared to death of his brother, and lacking a complete understanding of the world around him. Tiny Firefly is essentially the same, down to the mask. He’s over seven feet tall, mentally disabled, and physically disfigured, having been burned alive by his own father.\n\nThere is almost a gentleness to these characters, their violent actions aside. They’re scary, but they’re explicitly damaged through no fault of their own. It seems that Hooper and Zombie recognized and tried to represent similar inherent struggles that come with poverty in these characters. Tiny and Leatherface are not redeemable by any stretch, but one can imagine how their lives would have been different if they were born into a wealthier, more loving family—perhaps in the privileged household of one of the road trippers.\n\nWhat is interesting is that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released in 1974, and House of 1000 Corpses was released in 2003. What Zombie and Hooper meant to say in these films is complex, but one thing is very clear: the cultural divide portrayed in them is one that is timelessly present in the American experience. They show how ugly the world can be, both for the unlucky, raised with nothing but evil around them, and those who are comfortable enough to venture out and make a spectacle of the former.\n\n(Warning: major spoilers ahead for the film Soylent Green)\n\nBy Gracie Andreasen\n\nMy sophomore year of college I took a playwriting class. The class itself? Great. The class meeting at 8am? Not so great. Every Tuesday and Thursday I would force myself out of bed and slouch out the door to grab my life sustaining force: coffee. I would show up to every class with sleep still in my eyes and a latte gripped tightly in my hand. Almost all of my classmates showed up in a similar fashion. Some would come in holding paper Starbucks cups, others brought their own thermoses, a few even had cans of energy drinks, but one student’s drink was different from the rest. I noticed that she brought in the same plastic bottled drink everyday, and on the first day when I read the label I was shocked. She was drinking Soylent.\n\nNow, some reading this may be familiar with this trendy, meal-replacement beverage. I was not at the time. My only knowledge of the word “soylent” came from the 1973 B-horror, sci-fi film Soylent Green. This film, directed by Richard Fleischer, was based on the novel Make Room! Make Room! By Harry Harrison. The story follows a detective, played by Charlton Heston in the film, living in a dystopian world where food supply has almost completely run out due to overpopulation, leading the government to feed civilians meal-replacement concoctions, one of which being the substance named “soylent green”. This detective becomes suspicious of the government and secretly investigates their practices. During the climax of the film, he discovers what soylent green is really made of. In an iconic scene, a distraught Charlton Heston being forcibly carried off screen yells, “Soylent green is people!”\n\nThe government had been using dead bodies and churning them into a food source for the population. Totally horrifying and gross. I watched this movie with a group of friends for the first time in high school, and after finishing it we would scream Heston’s famous line to each other. If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend getting a group of friends together and watching it. The film explores some interesting questions about climate change, overpopulation, resource depletion, and ecological decay, and if that’s not enough to interest you, you should watch it for the 1970s B-movie cheesiness alone.\n\nAfter seeing my classmate bring in the drink a few times, I asked her if she had ever seen the movie. She hadn’t, and when I explained it to her and reenacted the climactic scene, she was not impressed. It probably was a bit much for a Tuesday morning. Embarrassment aside, I looked into the drink and found that it was a meal replacement beverage company formulated in Silicon Valley and founded in 2014. When you type in “soylent drink” on google, a list of frequently asked questions comes up, one of those is “Is soylent made from humans?” If you click on this question it takes you to a page on Soylent’s website. Their official quote on the matter is, “We assure you — no bodies were harmed in the making of our products. 🙂 Our formulas are powered by plants, not people.” However, if you just go onto their main website, there is nothing about the movie or book from which they took their company’s name. There are sleek images of various flavours of Soylent accompanied by paragraphs about the company’s founding and how the beverage provides all the nutrients a human being needs. It is interesting that in the novel and film, soylent green was forced upon people to survive because they had no other food to eat, while Soylent markets their drink as a choice for busy bees who don’t have time to make a meal. Though there are interesting science tidbits on the website, it takes quite a bit of digging to find that page with the quote pertaining to the movie and the question of drinking people.\n\nI find it interesting that this company would use the name from the film, but not lean into it in the rest of their marketing. Maybe this is for the best, people don’t want to think about drinking other people. There could be another reason for this hidden connection. A vast majority of people I see drinking Soylent are young, millennials, most of whom probably haven’t seen a not very famous movie from the 70s. So when they walk around with their healthy shakes, they have no idea about the origin of the name. This is perhaps a fun inside joke for the people who founded the company and those who know the movie. It’s definitely not because of something more sinister, right? That being said, drink at your own risk (;.\n\nBibliography\n\nEbert, Roger. “Soylent Green Movie Review & Film Summary (1973): Roger Ebert.” Movie Review & Film Summary (1973) | Roger Ebert, Russell Thatcher, https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/soylent-green-1973.\n\n“Let Us Take a Few Things off Your Plate.” Soylent, https://soylent.com/.\n\nBy: Tye Kalinovic\n\nUp until my junior year of high school I refused to watch horror movies, but since my introduction to the genre I have really come to love horror movies, and The Conjuring was one of the first films that sparked this love. The Conjuring was released in 2013, and I remembered hearing my babysitter mention that it terrified her. I had initially refused, but my friends had convinced me that I needed to at least try a horror movie. After all, how could I have such a strong opinion about them if I had never seen one? Perhaps the most convincing factor was that the girl I liked at the time was with us. If there was ever a way to get a 16 year old kid to do something no matter what, that may be the most effective way to do it.\n\nThere are plenty of aspects of The Conjuring that I would describe as scary. There is a scene in particular where the mom in the story is playing a version of hide and seek with the kids, where the mom has her eyes closed and tries to find the kids based on the sound when they clap their hands. Two hands emerge from the wardrobe and clap and we know as audience members that the hands don’t belong to her kids, but she doesn’t realize it. Scenes like this one really struck me because of how inherently creepy it was to see things that the characters don’t.\n\nThere are many other scenes throughout the film that show sharp jumpscares and creepy imagery, all of which was making me sweat. To my surprise I wasn’t hating my experience. I was definitely watching with a blanket pulled up to my nose, and shouted with every jump scare, but I was handling it pretty well.\n\nAlthough I was handling the imagery, and jumpscares, there is one aspect of this movie that especially stood out to me at the time. The words “based on a true story” across the screen. In fact to this day, people that the movie was based on still insist that much of the movie really happened (Alexander, 2013). (More info about the real life events can be found here. I know that anything could technically be “based on true events” and that this doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but for that night it took away my security blanket that it was just a movie. That night after watching the movie, the events of the movie played in my head. I sprinted up my driveway that night and fell asleep with my light on.\n\nI probably would have thought about The Conjuring afterward even if it wasn’t based on a true story, but I think that detail is what allowed me to treat the story as if it were real, which is now something I try to do with most horror movies.\n\nMy favorite movies of all time always have been and always will be movies that make me think afterward. I think the best movies are movies that capture my attention for the entire screen time and then demand even more of my attention after the movie is over. The Conjuring introduced me to applying that idea to horror movies. I think that is the reason that I now like the horror genre so much. Even if a movie isn’t made that well, approaching with the idea of it being real or imagining it happening to me forces me to think about the movie long after initially seeing it. Then again it’s possible that I like The Conjuring because I ended up holding hands with the girl and that’s what started my horror journey. I guess I’ll never know for certain.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nAlexander, Bryan. “The ‘True’ Story behind ‘The Conjuring’.” USA Today, Gannett Satellite Information Network, 23 July 2013.\n\n‘The Conjuring’, James Wan, Michael Chaves, 2013"
