        "text": "What destined this young boy from Wales to become the incarnation of absolute evil when he took on the role of cinema’s most notorious serial killer? How do you get from the bricks of Port Talbot, a poor, grim industrial town, to the lush palm trees of Hollywood, California? This is what we will try to understand in this documentary telling the lesser-known story of a well-known actor: Anthony Hopkins, after a career spanning over 60 years and his involvement in more than 300 movies.\n\nIf his performance as Hannibal Lecter changed his life forever, it is his extraordinary life and fate that would make him the most “British” actor in Hollywood. All the film extracts featured will aim at getting a better understanding of Anthony Hopkins since he shared many similarities with the characters he played. Nixon, Hannibal Lecter, the butler from The Remains of the Day, Hitchcock... all the roles played by Anthony Hopkins reflect a facet of his personality. He was far from following the “trends”. He never belonged to any film movement; he is a chameleon that has always preferred natural acting, “non-acting” when method acting was the fashion."
