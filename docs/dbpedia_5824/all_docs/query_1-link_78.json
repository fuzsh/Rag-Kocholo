        "text": "Universal Pictures International Entertainment (UPIE) has picked up Kristian Levring‘s Western, The Salvation, featuring Hannibal star Mads Mikkelsen, for multiple international territories.\n\nIn a deal announced in Toronto, UPIE acquired The Salvation for all of Latin America, Eastern Europe and South Africa.\n\nTrustNordisk is handling international sales on the feature, which co-stars Eva Green. Trust’s head of sales, Susan Wendt, negotiated the deal.\n\n“[This deal] strongly indicates that the international market place is more than ready for a Western of Scandinavian origin,” Wendt said.\n\nThe Salvation, co-written by Levring and Denmark’s Anders Thomas Jensen (In a Better World) features an ensemble cast that includes Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Mikael Persbrandt, Jonathan Pryce and French soccer star turned actor Eric Cantona.\n\nMikkelsen stars as a Danish settler in 19th-century America who sets out to avenge his family.\n\nBuyers jumped on the film after its premiere as a midnight screening in Cannes, with IFC Films picking up North American rights, Concorde taking Germany and Austria and Tohokushinsha acquiring Japanese rights, among several other deals."
