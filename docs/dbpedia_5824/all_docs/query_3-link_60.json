        "text": "I'm a big fan of the books of Thomas Harris. I think 'Red Dragon' is still his best, but 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Black Sunday' are strong as well. 'Hannibal' the book, well....\n\nI pretty much hated it.\n\nStill, when Ridley Scott was named as the successor to Jonathan Demme I was thrilled. While Demme has all sorts of respect, his body of work doesn't compete with Scott's and visually it's no contest. I liked 'Silence of the Lambs' but felt it was undeserving of all the accolades it ended up winning. A very good film, but Oscar material? Come on... over 'JFK'?\n\nAnyway, it's home on DVD with a super nice special edition...\n\nThe Movie\n\nYou know the story of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, so I'm not going to waste the time.\n\nFor the third time, Hannibal Lecter is onscreen to chill you, thrill you, and spar with his adversary in the FBI. For the second time it's Hopkins as the brilliant murderer and for the second time he's squaring off against Clarice Starling (this time played by Julianne Moore after Jodie Foster turned down 20 million dollars to reprise her role).\n\nA lot has been made over the book's controversial ending as well as the loss of the screenwriter, director, and female lead from the Oscar sweeping SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. When the smoke clears, there's not a lot they could have done to affect the outcome of HANNIBAL. In fact, I'd take the creative team of Scott, Zaillian, and Moore over Demme, Tally, and Foster any day. I felt the book was rich in description and scope, but was betrayed by an ending that was an injustice to Starling. The ending, which features her heroic agent going against everything she stands for thanks to a little \"coercion\" from Lecter. That's all I'll say.\n\nThe script for the movie gave the creative team (and author Thomas Harris) another chance to do it, and they seized it. The results will divide audiences no less than the book did. Personally, I like this one more. It's more cinematic, more open. It allows for future films and gives the audience what they asked for (the mainstream audience at least, and for a change I'm on their side).\n\nBeginning with Hannibal Lecter roaming the free world in parts unknown, we see agent Clarice amidst her team preparing for a confrontation with a deadly, AIDS carrying villainess. It's an intense scene where director Scott immediately reminds us that Jonathan Demme is old news by using a mixture of the techniques he used to good effect in GLADIATOR and BLACK RAIN, with a gorgeously photographed action scene showing no lack of gunfire or pizzazz. Things go a bit awry (which is conveyed less effectively in the film than the book, I must admit), and Starling is shamed. Most responsible for her punishment is the competitive Agent Krendler (Liotta).\n\nOn thin ice, Starling is shifted by the bureau (the character of Jack Crawford is nowhere to found, a shame since his role in the book was an important and bittersweet one) into the Lecter hunt. Once a glorious and career making case for her, it's now a punishment.\n\nUntil clues start showing up, culminating in a letter from the man himself.\n\nHannibal has been enjoying a vacation in Italy under an assumed name, becoming part of the work force and doing some \"dirty work\" (also given much more explanation in the novel) on the side. His activities raise the suspicion of an Italian cop (Giancarlo Gianinni), who in turn passes the info to the person offering a huge reward.\n\nMason Verger (Gary Oldman). A disfigured man who retains the privilege of being the only surviving victim of Lecter after the evil doctor \"recommended\" he peel his face apart and feed it to his dog. Worth billions, his pitiful existence is spent preparing for the capture and torture of Hannibal.\n\nThere's your principals. There's the stage set before you. All of the info I just shared takes place in the first third of the film. The rest is execution.\n\nWhat works:\n\nHopkins has been known to grandstand, and I thought his performance as Lecter the first time was terrific but hardly best actor material (yes, I'm a fan of Brian Cox in MANHUNTER). However, as he turned in great work in films like THE EDGE and TITUS I became more of a fan of his work. Here, he is utterly at home in the body of Lecter and since he's not confined to a cell the results are more rewarding. He's classy, icy, and impossible not to enjoy.\n\nMoore replaces Foster admirably, and if you close your eyes sometimes it's hard to tell the difference. She's more sultry, and it's easier to understand the sex appeal of the character when portrayed by Moore. She may not be as internal an actress, but the role doesn't demand it of her.\n\nRidley Scott makes damn good looking movies. Sometimes they're vacant (GI JANE) but they're always well made and after raising his own bar with GLADIATOR he has put together one of the best looking films around. You'll see shots and sequences that'll remind you of his earlier work, but the end result is the same: Top Notch Filmmaking.\n\nAlthough reports of people leaving the theater sick to their stomachs, the amount of gore they got away with here is admirable and hypocritical at the same time. The FX are great, and there are a couple of showstoppers, but how can they get an R and most horror films have to cut themselves to pieces to get the rating? Either way, it's neat and one scene at the end would be absolutely grim if it weren't for the humorous way it's handled.\n\nITALY. The story isn't in as much of a hurry when the scenes in Italy. Maybe it's the presence of Giannini (great, GREAT subdued work here), but once the film leaves the \"Boot\", it gets the boot.\n\nWhat Doesn't Work:\n\nAll right, the new ending ain't grand. It isn't sharp, inventive, or nearly as brave as the book. Of course, I HATED the book ending. It's a SEQUEL ending, for sure. The filmmakers knew who the star was and wanted to leave the audience hungry for more. On that note they succeeded. However, the ending could have been a LOT BETTER and still been nothing like the book.\n\nThe second half loses some steam, things are rushed in a big way. Some of the book's most intense scenes revolved around Verger and Lecter's confrontation and the buildup to it. Not here. Also, the scenes that should be climactic are a blur (the scene with the pigs especially).\n\nAlso, the whole issue with Hannibal's X-RAYS (shown in the film as a key point of evidence but never addressed) is glossed over. The whole issue of him having his 6th finger removed is banished. Also, Crawford, the character played by Dennis Farina and Scott Glenn in the previous films is abandoned here. It's a shame, because the character serves as a tragic hero for Starling. There's always sacrifices made in the transition from page to screen, but that was a big one.\n\nVerger. While I LOVED Oldman in the role, I think the character wasn't as eerie as I'd hoped. Early makeup designs were absolutely grotesque and would have made him unbearable to look at (the intention). Granted, he was far from pretty (readers of the comic PREACHER will immediately know the similarity between him and ARSEFACE). He seemed pretty dangerous in the book. Here, he's a crybaby with resources (though Zeljko Ivanek is a great sidekick).\n\nOverall, I think it's a success. It'll probably be one of those films people fight over like cats and dogs, but it'll get a reaction and that's what this medium is all about.\n\nIf IGN used a more detailed point system, this'd be a 7.5 but since it doesn't I'm going to round up...\n\n8 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nIn a word... FLAWLESS.\n\nLike Scott's 'Gladiator' DVD, this is one sexy looking film. Presented in the Anamorphic splendor you'd expect, it's as rich and crisp a transfer as I've seen. When it's dark, it's crisp and defined and without the hint of imperfection and when the transfer is delivering the opulence and beauty of Florence, Italy... it's even better.\n\nThere's nothing to gripe about here for me. Not one thing. This is my favorite transfer thus far on this format. I've watched the DVD three times on three different players and monitors and they all came through just fine.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nAs Darth Vader would say...\n\n\"Impressive\".\n\nThere's the expected 5.1 track and DTS thrown in for good measure, and I will tell you flat out that it's a truly gorgeous presentation. The music, sound FX, and atmosphere is so rich and evocative that even the staunchest non-fans have to appreciate the effort.\n\nThis is a richer and more powerful film on several levels than both its predacessors, ESPECIALLY music.\n\nIt booms, crawls up your spine, and eats you for lunch with a nice chianti.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\n¿ Commentary by director Ridley Scott\n\nWonderful stuff. Ridley's proven time and time again why's he's among the very best filmmakers when it comes to balancing art and commerce. His commentary is loose, easy to follow, and loaded with info. It's also good to hear him openly discuss the controversial response to the novel and the casting decisions. He'd a joy to listen to and it's great to see him making a movie a year now. Lucky us! One thing which may throw you off: On the menu it has the commentary broken down into chapters if you want to hear him discuss specific details, but have no fear... the commentary runs the entire length of the film.\n\n¿ Over 35 minutes of deleted scenes\n\nNo joke, there's tons of stuff here, including some extensions of existing scenes. Really solid stuff, but you can certainly understand why some were cut as the film already ran 2 hours and 11 minutes. Ridley Scott's optional commentary only makes it better.\n\n¿ Breaking the Silence - 5 unique making-of featurettes\n\nWorth the admission price alone. This is more like one documentary containing 5 chapters, but it's phenomenal. It breaks down the \"Development,\" (16 minutes) \"Production,\" (20 minutes) \"Special Make-Up effects,\" (14 minutes) \"Music\" (15 minutes) and \"Reaction\" (13 minutes), and it's so informative and cool and loaded with insight from all parties that it's right up there with the best special features I've seen on DVD. Really, this DVD is a template for how to do it right.\n\n¿ Photo gallery\n\nNormally these don't do it for me, but looking at all the poster concepts for this film was an eye opener. They ended up using one of the least effective designs in my opinion. Check these out, you won't be let down.\n\n¿ 3 interactive multi-angle featurette\n\nPretty darned cool stuff, and while it's more of a gimmicky feature, it's neat to break down the cool opening credits sequence.\n\n9 out of 10\n\nThis is amongst my very favorite DVD titles. Not one of my favorite films, but this is a perfect example on how the format enhances its source material."
