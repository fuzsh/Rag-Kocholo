        "text": "Victor Mature stars in this decent sword and sandals historical adventure as the titular Carthaginian general who challenged the Roman Empire in its dying days. It was shot in Italy, and while solid the film doesn‚Äôt have the scale of its Hollywood-funded competitors, with a much smaller scale in comparison that often leaves key events like battles offscreen.\n\nInstead, a lot of time is taken up by talking instead of action, especially in the rather leaden romance which doesn‚Äôt exactly light up the screen. Apparently the filmmakers wanted the film to be more of a character study but were pressured by the studio into making more of a conventional historical film, and there‚Äôs definitely a push and pull between these‚Ä¶\n\nEdgar Ulmer, a little later in the career. Even after blacklisted, he still manages to get another big budget picture out with Warner Bros. Just another reason I'm always impressed by not only his output/consistency of work. But in correlation to budgets, He really stretched em and had talent, and I'll appreciate that trait of resourcefulness in filmmaking. Always.\n\nThe film itself is a pretty well paced drama, with some war/battles here and there. I was never really bored or uninterested. It's shot well. Massive fields and mountains as your sets and backdrops with thousands of actors for soldiers on foot/on horse, and then the ELEPHANTS üêò\n\nI COULDNT tell you how accurate this flick is. It's a tad dull‚Ä¶\n\nHollywood star Victor Mature is the only American actor in this Italian-made epic of ancient Rome, but he is also the worst thing about the film. The Italian actors, led by Gabriele Ferzetti, all give very fine performances, but Mature's clunky delivery renders every scene he's in rather silly. Instead of projecting the gravitas of a Carthaginian military genius, Mature comes across as an aging lounge singer. Otherwise the production is quite impressive. The film opens with some great footage of an army of hundreds marching through beautiful snow-covered alpine scenery. Mature was not present at that shoot, however, so it is intercut with brief shots of Mature on a soundstage surrounded by fake snow. The movie sports some huge‚Ä¶\n\nA fool‚Äôs errand in attempting to tell only half the story of Hannibal‚Äôs invasion of Italy in the Second Punic War, leaving the narrative only half complete by the time the credits roll, but in spite of all its histrionics and cheesy melodrama Hannibal manages to deliver a decent Sword & Sandal adventure without sacrificing spectacle for the sake of a reasonable runtime. The most famous aspect of the Carthaginian‚Äôs campaign across the Alps ‚Äî the caravan of war elephants he implemented to trample his Roman foes ‚Äî are a surprisingly prominent feature of the film, far more than one would expect for such a temperamental creature. Throughout the first half of the film there are multiple lengthy battle sequences which‚Ä¶"
