        "text": "Woot! Woot! Even without any details and based on Radio Silence directing and cast alone, most of the Grue-Crew placed the [at the time] Untitled Universal Horror Movie on their Most Anticipated Horror Movies of 2024 list. Today, finally, Universal has released the first trailer and the first details about the film online: ABIGAIL! Looks like the “Dracula’s Daughter” rumors were not too far off the mark. The trailer looks fantastic, the cast is stellar, the direction looks to be Radio Silence’s best yet. Let’s move ABIGAIL up the list of most anticipated to number one! Check out the trailer below.\n\nChildren can be such monsters.\n\nAfter a group of would-be criminals kidnap the 12-year-old ballerina daughter of a powerful underworld figure, all they have to do to collect a $50 million ransom is watch the girl overnight. In an isolated mansion, the captors start to dwindle, one by one, and they discover, to their mounting horror, that they’re locked inside with no normal little girl.\n\nFrom Radio Silence—the directing team of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett behind the terrifying modern horror hits Ready or Not, 2022’s Scream and last year’s Scream VI—comes a brash, blood-thirsty new vision of the vampire flick, written by Stephen Shields (The Hole in the Ground, Zombie Bashers) and Guy Busick (Scream franchise, Ready or Not).\n\nAbigail stars Melissa Barrera (Scream franchise, In the Heights), Dan Stevens (Gaslit, Legion), Kathryn Newton (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Freaky), William Catlett (Black Lightning, True Story), Kevin Durand (Resident Evil: Retribution, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and Angus Cloud (Euphoria, North Hollywood) as the kidnappers and Alisha Weir (Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical, Darklands) as Abigail.\n\nThe film is produced by William Sherak (Scream franchise, Ready or Not), Paul Neinstein (Scream franchise; executive producer, The Night Agent) and James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, Scream franchise) for Project X Entertainment, by Tripp Vinson (Ready or Not, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) and by Radio Silence’s Chad Vilella (executive producer Ready or Not and Scream franchise). The executive producers are Ron Lynch and Macdara Kelleher.\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nCast: Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, Alisha Weir, Kathryn Newton, William Catlett, Kevin Durand, Angus Cloud and Giancarlo Esposito\n\nDirectors: Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett\n\nWritten by: Stephen Shields, Guy Busick\n\nProducers: William Sherak, Paul Neinstein, James Vanderbilt, Tripp Vinson, Chad Villella"
