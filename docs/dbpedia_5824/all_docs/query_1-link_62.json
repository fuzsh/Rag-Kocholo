        "text": "“Red Dragon” really warms the heart. A prequel to “The Silence of the Lambs,” the film explores what landed Hannibal Lecter behind bars in the first place. Spoiler Alert: he was eating people. Like the first film in the series, our Lecter fix is a little light but quality not quantity folks! Edward Norton stars as FBI Agent Will Graham. Norton really dominated the movie industry for like an eight year period. “Red Dragon” is no exception.\n\nI’ve always associated Ralph Fiennes with “Schindler’s List.” Here as the truly tormented, disturbed and super unhinged Francis Dolarhyde, it did nothing to make me think of his as a nice guy. In fact, watching him superglue Phillip Seymour Hoffman to an office chair and set him on fire did nothing to help me see him in a better light. I mean, this guy’s a real jerk!\n\nFor the uninitiated, “Red Dragon” is actually a remake of “Manhunter.” Directed by Michael Mann, the 1986 “Manhunter” plays just like a two and a half hour episode of “Miami Vice” with the dude from “CSI” doing a lot of driving all while wearing flashy suits. I’d rather be hunted by man then sit through that trash-fest again. But anyway…\n\n“Red Dragon” really succeeds—especially compared to its predecessor, “Hannibal”—because it goes back to the core of what made “The Silence of the Lambs” so great. More a drama and thriller than a horror film, it sits perfectly in the pocket and again; and unlike its predecessor, it makes excellent use of its impressive cast. Harvey Keitel kicks ass in everything he has ever been in. Even “Bad Lieutenant.” He shines in his supporting role as Jack Crawford, Will Graham’s superior. Same goes for Emily Watson and the aforementioned Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Mary-Louise Parker.\n\nBut. And this is a big but (insert your dated Sir-Mix-A-Lot joke here). While it is far superior to “Hannibal,” it still pales in comparison to “The Silence of the Lambs.” It’s kind of unfair. Or maybe a testament to the power of that film. Because even when “Red Dragon” is good, I’d still kind of rather see Buffalo Bill. And not that dancing scene that confused me on so many levels the first time I saw it as a wide-eyed nine-year-old, but you know what I mean.\n\nSo yes. I would recommend “Red Dragon.” But only if you’re plowing through the series. Don’t have a one night stand with Hannibal Lector and let this be your only impression. You may end up a little underwhelmed."
