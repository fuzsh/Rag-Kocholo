Once flat and facing the screen, two hands from opposite sides within the oval begin rotating before stopping to give the gesture that two people are grabbing each other. During this sequence, a gold filmstrip is seen moving in front of the disk, containing \"HANNIBAL PICTURES\" in black.\n\nTrivia: The two hands in this logo happens to be a detail from The Creation of Adam.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Give 'em Hell Malone and Casino Jack.\n\n2nd Logo (January 4, 2011-Late 2010's)\n\nVisuals: On a sand-color background, there is a box in the center with a lighter shade of the background color. Inside it, there is the cropped Creation of Adam painting above \"HANNIBAL\" and \"PICTURES\" in black and white respectively.\n\nVariants: On Rumble, the background is black, and the box is smaller as well as having a thin outline.\n\nTechnique: A still digital graphic.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: It debuted on Gun and can be seen on The Big Bang and Rumble."
