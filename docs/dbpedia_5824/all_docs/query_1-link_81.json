        "text": "Hannibal actor Hugh Dancy has admitted he found filming Downton Abbey: A New Era a \"terrifying\" experience.\n\nThe star, who no doubt is used to scary experiences given his work on the serial killer series, revealed that working on the historical drama movie sequel was nerve-wracking for an altogether different reason.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive chat with Digital Spy, the Jack Barber actor explained that the unique filming location meant he had to be very, very careful.\n\nRelated: Downton Abbey 2 star teases Barrow's new relationship in the sequel\n\n\"You're surrounded by literally priceless paintings all day long which are of such value and historical worth that they're uninsurable,\" the actor recalled. \"So it's basically terrifying. It's a very strange place to work.\"\n\nThe movie's cast also opened up about the meta nature of the sequel, with a group of actors arriving to film at Downton Abbey, star Hugh Bonneville (Earl of Grantham) joking that they \"now know how [real-life location owners] Lord and Lady Carnarvon feel every time the Downton Abbey trucks turn up\".\n\n\"By the same token it's saved their roof from dripping too much. It was great fun,\" he added.\n\nPenelope Wilton (Lady Merton) noted: \"I have a line where I say, 'And now do you do it all again?', and they say, 'Yes', and I thought, 'Yes yes, that's what we do all the time!'.\"\n\n\"One of my favourite lines is Laura Carmichael saying as Edith, 'How do you remember all those lines?',\" Elizabeth McGovern (Countess of Grantham) said, \"because that is something that everybody asks of us.\"\n\nJoanne Froggatt (Anna Bates) went on to explain: \"Anna and Daisy are very excited by the newbies, so there's those two sides of the coin.\n\n\"Maggie's lines especially are incredibly well-pitched because it's sort of doing down on actors and filmmakers from this iconic actress and double Oscar winner. Yeah, it definitely adds to the fun of it.\"\n\nRelated: Marvel star reveals inspiration for Downton Abbey 2 character\n\nHowever, Bonneville confirmed that Highclere Castle owners the Carnarvons don't watch filming, joking that \"after 12 years of us being in their house they know when to quietly withdraw and just get on with it\".\n\n\"Yeah, I mean it's a big invasion of their peaceful home, so yeah there were moments where I suddenly felt like the lady of the house, being the captain of the ship, thinking, 'Oh this is what Lady Carnarvon must feel like sometimes',\" Michelle Dockery (Lady Mary) said. \"We sometimes see them, but most of the time they keep out of the way.\"\n\nRaquel Cassidy (Phyllis Baxter) added: \"I think it's easier because you don't want to see it all happening so close to your precious things or on your precious floors.\""
