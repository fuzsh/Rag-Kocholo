Hey Girl was a Taiwanese girl group. Channel [V] held an audition for the show Blackie's Teenage Club (我愛黑澀會), a variety show that aims to create new female entertainers in Taiwan. At the end of 2005, Channel [V] picked nine members to represent the other girls. These nine members were Gui Gui, Ning Er, MeiMei, Apple, Hsiao Hsun, Ya Tou, Hsiao Man, Bae Tung Tung, and Ta Ya. Together, they are affectionately known as the Nine Beauties (Chinese: 九妞妞; pinyin: Jiǔ Niū Niū) for short.

The nine members were separated into two groups for their third EP release: Ta Ya, Hsiao Man, Ya Tou, Gui Gui, and Apple comprised Pink (traditional Chinese: 粉紅高壓電; ; pinyin: Fěn Hóng Gāo Yā Diàn; "high-voltage pink"), and Mei Mei, Hsiao Hsun, Ning Er, and Bae Tung Tung comprised Honey (traditional Chinese: 甜心轟炸機; ; pinyin: Tián Xīn Hōng Zhà Jī; "sweet-hearted flying bombers").
