        "text": "This article is over 5 years old and may contain outdated information\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nStephen King and his wife, Tabitha King, have made headlines for donating $1.25 million to the New England Historic Genealogical Society. This is great, of course, as the King family has a generous history of philanthropy. But in a frustrating turn of events, news headlines everywhere have been referring to Tabitha as solely King’s “wife.”\n\nThis is a dated and insulting custom that often befalls the spouses of famous people. Never mind that Tabitha King is a published author and an award-winning philanthropist. She is her own self, a woman with a name apart from her husband of 38 years. She deserves better than just “wife.”\n\nStephen King and Tabitha took to Twitter to discuss:\n\nTabitha’s response is bitingly funny, and calls out the absurdity of the headline. Many people took to Twitter in support of Tabitha:\n\n(via Twitter, image: screencap)\n\nWant more stories like this? Become a subscriber and support the site!"
