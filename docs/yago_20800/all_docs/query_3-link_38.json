        "text": "This work examines Stephen King’s position in popular literary circles and then considers the contributions of his family to the landscape of contemporary fiction. Though they have to a degree been eclipsed by Stephen King’s popularity, his wife, Tabitha King, and sons, Owen King and Joe Hill, have found varying levels of success in their own right. The three have traveled their own writing paths, from supernatural fiction to contemporary literary fiction. This is the first extended exploration of the works of three authors who have too long been overshadowed by their proximity to “the King of Horror.”\n\nAcknowledgments vii\n\nForeword (by Matthew Holman) 1\n\nPreface 5\n\n1.
