        "text": "Stephen King and his wife of thirty-eight years, Tabitha King, have made a huge donation to Boston’s New England Historic Genealogical Society, the oldest and largest genealogical society in the United States.\n\nBut many headlines referred to “Stephen King and his wife” when citing their generous contribution—to which Steve responded via irritated tweet that the gift was in fact Tabitha’s idea, thus she deserves equal credit.\n\nIn case you did not know, Tabitha is an award-winning philanthropist and a published author in her own right. A few Twitter jokesters suggested alternate headlines, including “Tabitha King donates 1.25M to New England Historic Genealogical Society. Mrs. King lives with a small dog and a husband” and the even shorter, sweeter introduction “Tabitha King and also some horror writer…”\n\nIn a memorable section of Stephen’s memoir On Writing (2000), he includes a beautiful poem about a hibernating bear written by his wife in college. Describing himself watching Tabitha read it aloud in class (they met while attending University of Maine), it seems like one of the first things that made him fall in love with her. Find Tabitha’s poem below.\n\n“A Gradual Canticle for Augustine” (1969)\n\nThe thinnest bear is awakened in the winter\n\nby the sleep-laughter of locusts,\n\nby the dream-blustering of bees,\n\nby the honeyed scent of desert sands\n\nthat the wind carries in her womb\n\ninto the distant hills, into the houses of Cedar."
