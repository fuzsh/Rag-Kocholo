He had started rolling the dough in and had bought himself a fancy car, but not wanting to come across as flaunting his newfound wealth, he left his new car at home and drove his old jalopy to the get-together.\n\nNow that's my kind of people.\n\nI wonder what it’s like being married to him. He comes up with such bizarre, scarey, stories that I just wonder what he is like on a day to day basis. Apparently he’s pretty darn nice if they have been married 50 years!\n\nHis wife Tabitha is also an author of the bizarre. She has a number of books out there."
