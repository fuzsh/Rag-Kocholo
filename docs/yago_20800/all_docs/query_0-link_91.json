        "text": "I’m currently reading Stephen King’s On Writing, and while I generally don’t post reviews/quotes from a book until after I’ve finished reading, this poem within the book was too good not to share.\n\nOn pages 63-64 of the book, Stephen King describes how he met his wife, Tabitha Spruce. Stephen and Tabitha both attended a poetry workshop in the living room of instructor Jim Bishop’s house. Stephen King transcribes one of Tabitha’s poems, titled “A Gradual Canticle for Augustine”:\n\nThe thinnest bear is awakened in the winter\n\nby the sleep-laughter of locusts,\n\nby the dream-blustering of bees,\n\nby the honeyed scent of desert sands\n\nthat the wind carries in her womb\n\ninto the distant hills, into the houses of Cedar.\n\nThe bear has heard a sure promise\n\nCertain words are edible; they nourish\n\nmore than snow heaped upon silver plates\n\nor ice overflowing golden bowls. Chips of ice\n\nfrom the mouth of a lover are not always better,\n\nNor a desert dreaming always a mirage.\n\nThe rising bear sings a gradual canticle\n\nwoven of sand that conquers cities\n\nby a slow cycle. His praise seduces\n\na passing wind, traveling to the sea\n\nwherein a fish, caught in a careful net,\n\nhears a bear’s song in the cool-scented snow.\n\nElegant and graceful. According to Stephen King: there was silence when Tabby finished reading. King describes the poem as exhibiting a “combination of crafty diction and delirious imagery.” I wanted to highlight this poem because it is the most vivid thing I’ve read all day."
