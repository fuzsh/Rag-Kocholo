        "text": "Stephen King has published 69 books and hundreds of short stories. His works have been adapted into films, television series, miniseries, musicals, and comic books. He's sold over 350 million copies of his novels and non-fiction works. In short: he's the King of the literary world.\n\nBut the reason he built up such a legacy is Tabitha King, his wife and fellow author. Without her, his first novel Carrie would have been relegated to the rubbish bin. And without her staging an intervention for his drug addiction, Stephen may not even be alive today.\n\nREAD MORE: John Farnham was 'history' the moment he saw future wife Jill\n\nThe American 73-year-old, known for penning some of the most famous – and most spooky – books of the last century, credits Tabitha for being by his side through it all. They've been married for 51 years, and certainly have a love story worthy of being novelised.\n\nLet's go back to the 1960s, where this love story began. The pair met when they both studied at the University of Maine, Stephen wrote in his memoir On Writing: \"I fell in love with her during a poetry workshop in the fall of 1969\". He says one of the things that really bonded them was their work, and how much they understand each other.\n\nThe pair married in 1971. \"I married her because I loved her and because we got on as well out of bed as in it,\" he said in 2003. \"The typewriter was a factor, though,\" he joked, because he needed one to write his stories.\n\nBy 1973 they had a toddler and a newborn, and barely enough money to put food on the table. The couple lived in a trailer: she worked at Dunkin' Donuts by night while writing during the day; he was working as a teacher and writing short stories on the side for gentlemen's magazines like Cavalier and Playboy. During the summer holidays he picked up side hustles as a janitor and petrol station attendant to make ends meet.\n\nThings weren't looking great. Stephen had spent about four years working on two novels that never came to fruition.\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: How Pierce Brosnan got a second chance at love with his 'brown-eyed girl' Keely Shaye Smith\n\nIn 1973, he was working on a short story called Carrie, but threw it in the bin after just a few pages. \"My considered opinion was that I had written the world's all-time loser,\" he said later. Tabitha saw something in the story, though. She pulled the pages out of the bin and forced him to keep working on it. She helped him figure out the female voice of the novel's protagonist and he finished the book.\n\nThough 30 publishers rejected the Carrie manuscript, finally it was picked up. Stephen recalled in his memoir about the day he heard the news. He was teaching at the high school, when a voice over the intercom told him to go to the office – he had a phone call from his wife.\n\nAt this time, the Kings didn't have a phone in their trailer, so for Tabitha to call him up, she'd have had to get the kids up and dressed and head over to their neighbours' place. Stephen recalled thinking it was either going to be terrible or amazing news.\n\nCarrie was King's first published novel, and it initially flopped. King kept at his teaching job, while writing on the side. A year later, the paperback rights for Carrie were sold to Signet publishing and the book sold a million copies in 12 months. Over the years it has certainly become one of his most iconic stories – adapted into a 1978 feature film starring Sissy Spacek, a Broadway production in the 1980s, and another film in 2013.\n\nThe book's dedication reads: \"This is for Tabby, who got me into it—and then bailed me out of it.\"\n\nWith the money he made from the paperback sale, Stephen was able to finally buy her a diamond engagement ring... six years after they'd married.\n\nAfter Carrie's release, Stephen shot to fame and began his storied career as a horror writer. But as his notoriety skyrocketed, he developed a dependence on drugs and alcohol.\n\nIn fact, in his memoir, the writer admits he spent most of the 1970s high on drugs.\n\nHe wrote, \"There's one novel, Cujo, that I barely remember writing at all. I don't say that with pride or shame, only with a vague sense of sorrow and loss. I like that book. And I wish I could remember enjoying the good parts as I put them down on the page.\"\n\nJust after Cujo was released in 1981, Tabitha and his two kids staged an intervention. \"I was dying right in front of them,\" King wrote.\n\n\"Tabby said I had a choice: I could get help at a rehab, or I could get the hell out of the house. She said that she and the kids loved me, and for that very reason, none of them wanted to witness my suicide.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: Sting was married to another woman when he met the love of his life, Trudie Styler\n\nThat was a turning point for King. Since then, he's been sober, as he told The Guardian\n\nKing jokes that one of the reasons he married Tabitha in the first place is because of one particular recipe she cooked him.\n\n\"There's a long-running joke that I married Tabitha because we were poor, and she came with a typewriter,\" Stephen told Bon Appetit in 2013. \"But it's really because of the fish that she cooked for me.\" He went on to say the couple love cooking together, and seafood is a main staple in their home kitchen.\n\nNow, 53 years after they first met, they're still as strong as ever.\n\nIn a 2013 acceptance speech for his life's work, King dedicated it all to his wife.\n\n\"There is a time in the lives of most writers when they are vulnerable, when the vivid dreams and ambitions of childhood seem to pale in the harsh sunlight of what we call the real world,\" King said at the ceremony.\n\n\"In short, there's a time when things can go either way. That vulnerable time for me came during 1971 to 1973. If my wife had suggested to me even with love and kindness and gentleness ... that the time had come to put my dreams away and support my family, I would have done that with no complaint.\"\n\nThe couple have three kids – two of whom are also writers – and four grandkids. They have two giant mansions in Maine, on the east coast of the US, where they've lived ever since they first met back in that university library.\n\nAnd as Stephen said in his Twitter post celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary: \"It's been a hell of a good run. ..and still going. Sorta like the Energizer Bunny.\""
