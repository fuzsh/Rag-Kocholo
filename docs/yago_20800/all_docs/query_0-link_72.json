It would also house an archive of King's work that could be seen by appointment.\n\nCity Councilor Laura Supica said at a meeting earlier this week that she supports the change and thinks it would add to the city's arts scene. \"Bring people, bring money, bring culture, keep culture here in Bangor,\" Supica said. \"I just wanted to remind that the arts add value.\"\n\nCouncilor Gibran Graham said he also supports the plan and thinks it demonstrates the family's connection to the city.\n\n\"To see them find a solution for - continue to have a tie here with the properties that are on West Broadway -- and not sell them, basically divest themselves, of those ties to Bangor, I think, is very admirable,\" Graham said.\n\nSeveral neighbors of the property also signed a letter of support for the new zoning plan.\n\nThe Kings lived at the house in Bangor for decades, but now spend much of their time at other properties in Florida and western Maine."
