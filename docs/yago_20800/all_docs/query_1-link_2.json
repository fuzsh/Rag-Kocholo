        "text": "American author (born 1949)\n\nTabitha Jane King (née Spruce, born March 24, 1949) is an American author.[1][2][3]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nTabitha King is the third eldest daughter of Sarah Jane Spruce (née White; December 7, 1923 – April 14, 2007)[4] and Raymond George Spruce (December 29, 1923 – May 29, 2014).[5] King attended John Bapst Memorial High School in Bangor, Maine[6] before enrolling at the University of Maine, where she met her husband Stephen King through her work-study job in the Raymond H. Fogler Library.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2006, King had published eight novels and two works of non-fiction.[7][8] She published her first novel, Small World, through Signet Books in 1981,[9] and in 2006, Candles Burning was published through Berkley Books.[10][11] The paperback rights for Small World were bought by New American Library for $165,000.[12] Candles Burning was written predominantly by Michael McDowell, who died in 1999, and the McDowell family requested that King finish the work.[13]\n\nIn 2023, she was the executive producer of the independent horror film The Sudbury Devil.[14]\n\nSocial activism\n\n[edit]\n\nKing has served on several boards and committees in the state of Maine, such as the Bangor Public Library board.[15] She also served on the board of the Maine Public Broadcasting System until 1994.[16] In 1998 she received the inaugural Constance H. Carlson Public Humanities Prize, the Maine Humanities Council's highest award, for her work with literacy for the state of Maine.[17]\n\nShe currently serves as vice president of WZON/WZLO/WKIT radio stations, as well as in the administration of two family philanthropic foundations.[15] The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by her and her husband, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving, with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.[18]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nReception to King's work has ranged from negative to positive.[19][20][21] Pearl received positive mentions from the Los Angeles Times and the Bangor Daily News,[22][23] while the Chicago Tribune panned Survivor.[24] The Arizona Daily Star criticized One on One, calling King \"a hack\",[25] whereas Entertainment Weekly, Time, and the Rocky Mountain News gave the novel positive reviews.[26][27][28] Caretakers received positive praise by The New York Times,[29] while Bookreporter.com wrote that some readers might be disappointed by the changes made to McDowell's Candles Burning.[30]\n\nAwards and recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nHonorary Doctorates of Humane Letters, University of Maine in Orono (May 1987)[31]\n\nDowd Achievement Award (1992)[32]\n\nConstance H. Carlson Public Humanities Prize (1998)[17][33]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nTabitha and Stephen King married on January 2, 1971.[34][35][36][37] They have three children: a daughter Naomi and two sons, Joe Hill and Owen King, who are both writers.[38]\n\nInfluence on Stephen King's Carrie\n\n[edit]\n\nAs Stephen King recalled the origin of his debut novel, Carrie: \"Two unrelated ideas, adolescent cruelty and telekinesis, came together.\" It began as a short story intended for Cavalier; Stephen tossed the first three pages in the trash but Tabitha recovered them, saying she wanted to know what happened next. He followed her advice and expanded it into a novel.[39] She told him: \"You've got something here. I really think you do.\"[40]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Publisher ISBN Pages Note 1981 Small World Signet Books 9780451114082 312 1983 Caretakers Scribner's 9780025631502 274 First novel set in King's fictional community of Nodd's Ridge 1986 The Trap 9780451160300 352 Also published as Wolves at the Door; second novel set in King's fictional community of Nodd's Ridge 1988 Pearl Signet Books 9780451162625 368 Third novel set in King's fictional community of Nodd's Ridge 1993 One on One 9780451179814 528 Fourth novel set in King's fictional community of Nodd's Ridge 1994 The Book of Reuben 9780451179999 432 Fifth and last novel set in King's fictional community of Nodd's Ridge 1997 Survivor 9780451190901 496 2006 Candles Burning Berkley Publishing Group 9780425210284 423 with Michael McDowell.
