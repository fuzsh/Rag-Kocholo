It says it will use the gift announced Tuesday to develop educational programming and fund a curriculum in family history for public school students.\n\nIt will also help the organization expand its headquarters.\n\nBrenton Simons is president and CEO of the society. He says the money will have \"far-reaching benefits.\"\n\nThe society says the Kings have deep personal interest in family and local history and their importance in education."
