        "text": "KITTERY, Maine — Offered by a world-famous author and his wife, the Town Council was poised Monday night to accept a $50,000 grant for the Rice Public Library Building from the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation.\n\nDiane Fallon, a volunteer who sits on the library corporation’s board of directors, has overseen the fundraising efforts and said they first found out about the donation from Stephen and Tabitha King in October.\n\n“I was thrilled, I was so thrilled,” she said.\n\nFounded in 1986, the foundation began as a way to give back to a number of communities and groups in Maine, and Fallon said that the arts and humanities have remained a constant recipient of the author and his family’s monetary generosity. She noted that the library is particularly happy that they were able to receive the grant in the time of the pandemic, particularly as priorities are shifting for the foundation in terms of where to allocate fiscal support.\n\n“So we were very thrilled to get the kind grant and it was a big boost in morale for our campaign,” she said.\n\nTown Manager Kendra Amaral said town leaders are “extremely grateful” to receive the grant for a project that’s been over a decade in the making.\n\n“To see the support from organizations and foundations whose mission is to support libraries, to see that comes toward this project I think reinforces just how good of a project we have,” she said.\n\nThe 132 year-old library is scheduled to undergo renovations beginning next month and is currently closed until Feb. 16 to prepare for them. At that time, only the Taylor Building will reopen; the main Rice Building won’t reopen until construction commences in April 2022.\n\nGiving back: Stephen King helps Maine kids publish pandemic-inspired book\n\nThe 13-month project, overseen the Library Building Committee, intends not only to renovate the library but also to update technology, the parking lot and to add furniture and “fixtures,” as well as a children’s garden in the name of the recently deceased Ann Grinnell, a Kittery swim instructor and municipal fixture for years.\n\nAmaral said last month the project is expected to cost an estimated $6,135,927, with the “base” portion of the project running up around $4.6 million.\n\nFunding for the base project comes from the town’s Capital Improvement Plan from 2018 and 2019, as well as from the $5 million bond town residents approved in November 2019, plus individual grants and donations.\n\nAmaral said that the National Endowment for the Humanities gave a $500,000 grant for the project and that Fallon and her team are looking to raise an additional $700,000 in their capital campaign efforts.\n\nDoors close: Kittery's Rice Public Library to temporarily close before construction\n\no far, Fallon said, $285,000 in grants and pledges has been raised to accommodate the NEH’s grant.\n\nThe Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation’s grant will not require any element of the library’s renovations to be bestowed in their name. Rather, like other donors, their names will appear on the library’s wall of sponsors.\n\n“It’s my understanding that they’re not people who are interested in getting a lot of attention,” Fallon said of the King family.\n\nProject scope: Kittery library construction to begin in March with maximum cost set\n\nOther grants toward the library’s renovations and construction project are in the midst of being finalized, she noted.\n\nUntil the Taylor Building reopens to resume normal library operations, library patrons are being asked to hold onto books and other items previously checked out, including ones that are due. No items will be marked as overdue and no fees will be issued.\n\nThe Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
