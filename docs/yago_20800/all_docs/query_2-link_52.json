        "text": "The National Day of Service and Remembrance is a day dedicated to remembering the tragic events that occurred on September 11th, 2001 and honoring the individuals who lost their lives that day. This day is also an opportunity for individuals to volunteer and participate in service projects that benefit their community. The National Day of Service and Remembrance was established in 2009 by the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. It is observed on September 11th each year, which is now recognized as a National Day of Service and Remembrance under federal law. On this day, people come together to participate in a variety of service projects, such as cleaning up local parks, organizing food drives, and assisting with community events. These projects not only benefit the community, but also serve as a way to honor those who lost their lives on September 11th by continuing their legacy of service. In addition to service projects, many communities hold remembrance ceremonies to pay tribute to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. These ceremonies often include moments of silence, prayer services, and the reading of the names of those who lost their lives. Overall, the National Day of Service and Remembrance is a day to come together as a community, remember those who were lost, and honor their memory through acts of service and kindness.

Most holidays are performative. Intentional action can make them more meaningful and impactful. If you're donating today, consider seeking out a smaller Black-led organization that might not be receiving as much funding or support as the larger orgs. Better yet, do some research to find out if there are any racial justice organizations in your local area, and direct your support there. Here are some of my favorite NW-based orgs that accept donations: - Jefferson County Anti-Racist Fund - Creative Justice NW - Lavender Rights Project - King County Equity Now - Africatown Community Land Trust For the sake of getting as many eyes on this post as possible, I'm not including any external links here. ⬇ SCROLL TO THE COMMENTS ⬇ to find a link to a Google Doc featuring details and donation links for the organizations listed above. P.S. While Juneteenth and the abolition of slavery are certainly things to celebrate, it's important to recognize that we don't live in a \"post-racial\" world. To learn about what happened *after* the formal abolition of slavery (i.e., how slavery as an institution was transmuted into the US prison system), check out Ava DuVernay's award-winning documentary 13th on Netflix. #juneteenth #racialjustice #DEI #racialequity #donate\n\nThe National Day of Service and Remembrance is a day dedicated to remembering the tragic events that occurred on September 11th, 2001 and honoring the individuals who lost their lives that day.

In a society that often overlooks the humanity of those behind bars, at Freedom From Within, we seek to offer guidance to individuals like Jason. Life has a way of throwing unexpected challenges our way, but it's important to remember that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for a brighter future. Jason found hope. Through our program, not only did we provide him with practical guidance but also tools and resources that equipped him in his path toward personal transformation. We are in the business of helping those who are incarcerated break free from the constraints of their past so that they could build a brighter future. This is not easy but with your support, we will make a difference in the lives of individuals striving to rebuild their lives after incarceration. Curious about making a meaningful impact? Explore ways to get involved by visiting our website: https://lnkd.in/eBhM4DCU Whether you choose to volunteer, offer your support, or make a donation, you partnering with us plays a vital role in helping individuals in custody rebuild their lives and find their freedom. Together, let's make a difference.\n\nHappy 35th Birthday... To me! I can hardly believe it and still honestly processing how I made it here, as I do every single birthday. I truly treat life as a gift, especially every single year that I get the privilege to see a new age because it's always worth marinating. As someone who has survived a multitude of things in this life, I am incredibly thankful to God for creating me to be me. For leading me along the way even when I completely gave up, and for sending me the right people to be in my corner. And most importantly for giving me the fire-filled purpose to help others thrive and stay alive. Here's my birthday wish for today, for my connections to help me achieve my goal so we can make a film that raises awareness and funding for the Chicago Children's Advocacy Center for project CAN HOPE. Chicago Advocacy Network for Hope, or CAN Hope, will be a multi-agency, multi-disciplinary, co-located center that provides services to adult survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault as well as human trafficking. CAN Hope is inspired by the Family Justice Center model, which provides the same kind of coordinated care as the CAC model for survivors of abuse, regardless of age, gender, or type of abuse. Of the 25 largest cities in the United States, 19 have opened a center where survivors and families can receive an array of services and support to promote their safety and well-being. Three ways you can support this huge initiative are by: 1. Commenting to boost this post with your audience. 2. Donating to help us make this special project come to life at https://lnkd.in/efS8Smpi 3. Become a fiscal sponsor for the film who will get a guaranteed tax-deductible credit investment back, IMDB and film producer credit, promotion for your business from our stars, and much more. If you are interested, please shoot me a message. Any one of these things will help to support the sexually and domestically exploited children and adults of our nation, and with your help, we can lead the way for great change. Thank you for your support. 💖 hashtag #advocacy #nonprofit #survivors #mentalhealthawareness #birthdaypost #happybirthday #womeninfilm #filmmaking #crowdfunding\n\nI want to talk about the \"white savior complex.\" Juneteenth is a monumental day in United States history. While slavery has been formally abolished, its remnants still deeply influence our systems (modern slavery practices are a different conversation). Philanthropy relies on incredibly generous donors and passionate advocates. However, the \"white savior complex\" is a systemic issue in the nonprofit world. White Saviorism occurs when a person from a position of privilege, often white, steps in to rescue someone from their situation. Though it may stem from genuine compassion, this practice becomes harmful when it strips those in need of their agency, diminishes their ability to help themselves, and stunts their community’s growth. This issue isn't confined to white individuals; it can apply to anyone in a position of privilege or power. Many of us feel an impulsive desire to fix issues we’re passionate about — to be the hero, to swoop in and 'do our part' for society. However, this often stems from a sense of superiority and a desire to be absolved of our own behaviors, whatever those may be. I believe there is much work to be done in every sector. Philanthropy is key to addressing these issues. For those eager to help, it's crucial to focus on creating self-sufficient solutions. Instead of just fundraising for medical supplies for a community in a developing country, we should aim to help build strong infrastructure so they don't need external aid in the long run. Instead of merely hosting educational workshops for students in underrepresented areas, we should provide them with the tools to sustain their own community’s growth indefinitely. These are the considerations we must prioritize as we move forward in philanthropy. #philanthropy #Juneteenth #whitesaviorism\n\nCovered is celebrating 7 years this month! We have assisted 137 trafficking survivors in our program since 2017 and empowered them toward healing and self-sufficiency. We are excited for what the future will hold and how many more lives we will impact. We opened our first safe house in January of 2023 and have had: -1,374 safe night’s sleeps -3,744 meals served -2,552 counseling hours -327 group therapy hours Covered started in 2017 after our founder discovered that there are very few resources in Colorado for sex trafficking victims over the age of eighteen. A group of people wanting to make a difference got together and formed Covered. After receiving our 501c3 status as a nonprofit, we began to build our program and help survivors find hope and healing. Covered continues to grow and improve on the resources and care that we are providing for these brave women seeking a new life.
