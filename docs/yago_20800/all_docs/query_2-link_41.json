        "text": "June 16, 2021\n\nI think I read all of Tabby's books in the 90's, but it was before GR and I don't remember much about most, so recently ordered copies of all of them. I want to protest the fact that some of her books are out of print and were not that easy to find. This and two others were only available as \"retired\" library books. This is a travesty. I am actually angry on her behalf.\n\nI want to point out, first of all, that this book was littered with typos. This is not the writer's fault. Dutton published the book and it was their job to get it copy edited. What the hell? They didn't care enough to hire someone to do a good job? I can overlook one or two. It happens. But I stopped counting at 23. TWENTY THREE typos in a professionally published book. Back to the fact that this book is out of print. This book is phenomenal. The reviews here on Goodreads support this. Clearly Dutton didn't publicize it enough. Let's forgive them that ridiculous mistake. I know that YA was not really a thing in 1993, but it damn well is now. They are missing a golden opportunity to reprint this book in an affordable Mass Media Paperback and market it as YA. They could even make use of the idea that the book was written 30 years ago and is as relevant today as it was when published. They missed a very profitable boat!\n\nNow the story. I played a little basketball in middle and high school. Tabby knows the sport. Inside and out. Front ways and back ways. The descriptions of practices and games are breathtaking. They are realistic and accurate, do not talk down to the uninitiated and are thrilling despite being long and mostly play by plays. She infuses emotion and mood into the descriptions and I think even those who know nothing about the sport will be swept away.\n\nThe relationship between Sam and Deanie, the main characters, is beautifully built. They are one of those mismatched pairs that work not despite their differences, but because of them. There is very little sweetness and light in their story, but what is there is told in such a way that the impact is far greater than it would be if King had written a traditional romance. Knowing some of what I know about her, she is no shrinking violet herself, knows what she needs and wants, and is willing to go about the hard work of getting it. Her characters do the same. Because she is writing what she knows it comes across as very believable and genuine. Truth oozes from the pages. Even, if not especially, the ugly truth.\n\nThe book opens on a night of revelry and we are given a glimpse of Sam being reckless, a bit irresponsible and celebratory in a way that is very out of character for him. It may seem odd to introduce a character like this, but it's actually genius because King then uses the rest of the book to show us the real Sam. I love Sam. How could you not?\n\nDeanie, AKA \"The Mutant\" is introduced and described throughout with very little insight. We are seldom told how she is feeling, or what she thinks, and yet King shows us in undeniable ways. Showing instead of telling is one of King's strengths. Deanie's life is hard and hurtful and instead of writing a pity party, King decides instead to tell it like it is, show us Sam's reactions and allow the chips to fall where they may. As readers we become more deeply invested because we are forced to really think about what Deanie means by her words and actions. Just like real people, Deanie and Sam seldom say what they mean, do what they really want or wax poetic about love. People rarely do and King knows this.\n\nThe one flaw, and the beauty of the rest of the book more than makes up for it, is the epilogue. I could have done without it. I am not a reader that requires a neat, tidy ending. I am happy left to ponder what I think happens after the last page. The epilogue here attempts to make straight and even edges of Sam and Deanie's lives. Almost as if King was told to add it. I didn't need it. This is a very small mistake in what is otherwise an ocean of all that is good about brilliant writing. I can skip the epilogue when I reread, and I WILL be rereading.\n\nJuly 27, 2011\n\nThis is considered adult fiction, but has one of the best ever young adult love stories in it set against a backdrop of high school basketball. I read it one spring just after it came out and both the NCAA and the NBA championships were over and I was in basketball withdrawal. The hero is dyslexic and has a crazy mixed up family of a loveable sort and the heroine is one of the most complex and screwed up - think Raeanne from \"My So-Called Life\" but wayyyy more messed up and way more, well, pierced. I LOVE this book and wish it was still in print and more accessible. Look it up on B&N's site and request the publisher to put this book (and Tabitha's other titles) on NOOK or other ebook sites.\n\nJune 22, 2008\n\nAmong my favorite books of all time; one that lives on the \"comfort reads\" shelf. When I lost my copy, I got another one in hardcover.\n\nOctober 26, 2011\n\nThis is one of my favorite reads. It's beautiful and haunting with the imagery that King uses in depicting how two mismatched kids fall in love against a backdrop of basketball, emotional woes, abuse, and high school. The characters are wonderfully rendered in all their imperfections and the love story is so bittersweet that the ending will leave you with a permanent ache in your heart. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to read something that's not perfect by any means, but definitely powerful and stirring.\n\nAnd, as I believe a graffiti stated in another book written by another author named King: Sam and Deanie forever.\n\nSeptember 19, 2011\n\nA pivotal coming of age novel about the way relationships in a teen's life can be life changing -- for better & for worse. The characters are strong & significantly well developed. Tabitha King is a very good author, who builds a world that entrances the reader immediately, drawing the audience into a place where we don't even question the need to suspend any disbelief: we just run with her narrative and don't look back. I believe this is an interesting novel for teens or young adults, as the sexual elements offer some good habits to demonstrate for a life that can begin with similarly healthy sexual expression (the use of protection & caution with which the characters progress in their relationship on a sexual level). Also, the way Sam protects his girl, the abuse she suffers and the way he begins to care for her despite their formerly adversarial encounters, and although in the end he doesn't walk away unscathed & he doesn't follow the path his family expected Sam ends up happiest walking another path. This novel will make you laugh, make you hold your breath in fright for Deenie, & cry with the life-altering changes that happen to both these amazing characters.\n\nDecember 31, 2011\n\nI am so grateful for Sue D. for recommending this novel to me. As my book club was discussing a short story by Stephen King, we stumbled upon the fact that his wife was also a writer. Tabitha King has compiled an amazing story here. Would I have ever picked up a 440-page novel about basketball? Not likely...but I am so happy that I did. Obviously, this book is about far more than basketball. It is about two young high school players: Sam Styles and Deani \"The Mutant\". Both seniors, Sam is the reigning VIP on his team; he sets a goal to see both the boys and girls team with the state championships this year. He will, however, have to convince the girls of this goal, so he has to get the Mutant on his side. The Mutant is a rebellious, head-shaven, pierced, aggressive and crass girl, who has developed a terrible reputation, known by everyone in the small Maine town. As Sam begins his so-called quest, he is drawn to her, curious about her outlook on life and how she survives a daily existence due to an obvious lack of money and parenting. Surrounded by friends who are limited by the town, Sam yearns for a better future. The relationship that develops between Sam and Deani is heart-pounding; I could not put this book down. Tabitha King has created an amazing story here; the dialogue and character development is excellent. I believed every word I read. I believed that this story was really happening. Although this novel is perhaps geared towards a YA audience, I believe that adults should be equally exposed to this amazing book. I will be recommending this to everyone.\n\nMarch 27, 2018\n\nMy favorite book of all time - I own two hardcover copies and read it at least yearly. One was to replace a well-worn paperback, and the second was an autographed copy that I could not leave on the bookshelf at my local bookstore.\n\nThis is the story of Deanie & Sam, both of which have challenges in their life. They're an unlikely couple, united intially (and reluctantly) through their love of basketball. The challenges continue through their unconventional courtship. It's often dark, gritty, and too real - I've loaned it to friends who couldn't read it due to that. But it's well-written with obvious affection for the characters, some of whom also appear in other books by the same author.\n\nSeptember 2, 2008\n\nWhen I first picked this book up, I was jostled by the tense that it was written in, the artistic, gritty descriptions, and the strangely different female protagonist. About 40 pages in, I found the flow of the writing and I was completely taken by the story.\n\nIt was brilliant and I'm so glad that I discovered how talented MRS. King is!\n\nAugust 11, 2021\n\nTabitha King is a masterful—regrettably unsung—literary author who characterizes rural Maine unlike any other, and One on One is my favorite of her books. I’m a rural Mainer myself, and the authenticity of the 90’s high school setting really hit home for me; ditto the tourney time basketball fever which drives both Sam and Deanie, the enemies-to-lovers protagonists whose dual narration weaves this tale of a basketball hero “good boy” falling for the most unlikely of heroines—Deanie, aka The Mutant, a tough, antagonistic teen girl whose abusive, neglectful childhood has left her with a razor tongue and an inability to trust anyone, even when she wants to. I’ll never forget their struggle to see eye to eye, their battles, their eventual hard-won connection over the period of one basketball season. Treat yourself to this masterpiece—you won’t be sorry.\n\nMarch 24, 2018\n\nKing works together an excellent story, pinching the plot points together with ease, tightening the screws, until the pressure pops and the whole weave comes together. Tightly wound, my only complaint is that sometimes the language feels overwrought.\n\nJanuary 26, 2023\n\npretty good if you don't get offended at course language, crudeness, etc. it's actually intelligent and well-written. had to put it down sometimes due to sadness and violence, but it was definitely worth reading in my opinion.\n\nSeptember 10, 2010\n\nMixed feeling. The story drags towards the end. Love the hero, sympathetic to the heroine. However, they're wrong for each other. No, as a matter of fact she's wrong for him. But I'm not going to complain about that. Mismatch couples happen all the time, in books and real life.\n\nBad things happen to them. A lot. Sometimes over-the-top bad. Everything in this book is extreme, the personality of characters, the mood swings, the language. Not a single kid in the school (or in other schools for that matter) seems mentally stable. I mean..are we this bad in HS? I think not.\n\nThe only anchor that holds the story together is Sam, and I feel bad how he ends up. I can't help but think he's got a stinking end of the bargain.\n\nSome might feel uplifting after finishing this book. I? Nothing but sad and a little depressed. 3 and 1/2 stars\n\nNovember 19, 2013\n\nRead this years ago and still have it, and Yes, I read this first because S.King is and always will be my favorite author but, after I started this book then I forgot all about him and got sucked into this story. It is really a great book and I so enjoyed the tough girl in the book. So I now have all of Tabitha's books, ha ha! she needs to write more!!\n\nNovember 6, 2013\n\nThis book was fantastic. I loved this book and it was very good. This book, in my opinion deserves a sequel to show the life of Deanie and Sam. To see if they had a family or if they truly did make it. I would recommend this book to everyone in the world. Very good work here indeed\n\nFebruary 25, 2009\n\nThis book is heartbreakingly well written and contains the truest, most beautiful depiction of teenage relationships I've ever read (plus some of the best love scenes).\n\nMay 7, 2011\n\nThis is one of my favourite books. I just love the interplay between the family members and that time in your life going from high school to real life.\n\nWant to read\n\nJuly 17, 2011\n\nStephen King's wife.\n\nDecember 3, 2015\n\nBoy saves a girl from her Rapist father and they forge and unlikely relationship\n\nNovember 9, 2022\n\nThis one grabbed me from the beginning, and part of me wonders if part of that is the present-tense telling of it. For a good part of this book, I was thinking of giving it a few more stars; it's a riveting story especially the first half and a bit; edging into the four-and-a-half star star territory.\n\nThe characters have a realistic kind of feel to them, especially Reuben and Pearl; the everyday, ordinary stuff of life, and I like that Sam, the protagonist is a decent guy, on good terms with decent people. It's a mostly-decent place that King has carved out here, with the less decent ones, and a villain or two for a deeper and richer sense of context.\n\nI skimmed through a lot of the sex scenes and toward the end, a fair bit of the basketball scenes when there'd be long swaths of description. They didn't end up bringing much extra to the story, and I wasn't up for trying to make out the detailed choreography in either case.\n\nFor me, the book felt like it ran out of a bit of steam when Deanie had found a temporary refuge, which was a good thing, and then there was a jarring but short bit--just a few paragraphs--where Sam says she should help out with the dishes, and it felt like it was a manufactured kind of tension--oh crap, here we go and then it thankfully dissipated easily enough, and no more mention was made of it.\n\nIt started falling apart toward the end, where the various characters were getting justice meted out to them; it seemed too comically quick and complete, but I guess leaving those parts unresolved wouldn't have been good, either. (I have a sharp disdain for overly-tidy gift-wrapped resolutions, which is where this looked like it was heading for a bit.)\n\nThe final epilogue was good. Quiet and powerful, and it told you just what you needed to know.\n\nI know I'm just an ordinary reader, and this is probably going to sound dreadfully condescending--in my defense, I don't at all mean to be--but here it is, anyway: Tabitha King wrote this a good bunch of years ago, and there's so much good stuff here, I'd love to see what she'd write like these days.\n\nAugust 19, 2018\n\nI've been reading all of Tabitha King's novels in order of publication and I'm very impressed. I've enjoyed the last 4 most of all because she is setting them all in the same small (imaginary) town in Maine. Because of this the reader gets to know intimately all the characters of that town and how they interact. She also sprinkles in some of husband Stephen King's imaginary towns and characters which is what I've always enjoyed about his work. This particular book is very sexually intense PLUS it's a sports high school basketball book. My husband used to love those kinds of books. I felt she accurately captured the way teenagers feel, think and act with their raging hormones and need for independence. Good book!\n\nNovember 3, 2022\n\nKing makes interesting characters in this book, and in outline, the plot is good. I like the ideas of this story and the plot points. Unfortunately, it is just too slow. It took FOREVER for this story to progress from one point to the next. Part of me wanted to root for these characters, and another part of me was bored with them and wanted to yell, “Get on with it!” There is a great deal of time wasted on highly detailed sex scenes between two high schoolers. Now, I realize that plenty of high schoolers do, in fact, have sex with each other. But I did not feel entirely comfortable reading such precise descriptions of sex between minors. The pacing of this book is off, and the emphasis on sexual detail is off-putting.\n\nRead\n\nApril 2, 2022\n\nProbably my favorite book of all time. I wore out the paperback years ago and had to replace it with a hardcover. I try to read it every January. It kinda of sets the post-Christmas,\n\nwinter mood for me.\n\nJanuary 22, 2023\n\nThis book needed a better editor. It was at least 100 pages too long. It reminded me of writing a paper for a Writing Class and one would need to pad it to get to the minimum number of pages or word count.\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\nDevastating almost tragedy of Grecian proportions that reminds me of what I thought Normal People would be like. Can’t believe I cared so much about basketball state championships! Will definitely be reading more Tabitha if I can get my hands on them.\n\nOctober 19, 2016\n\nI came for the basketball, but I stayed for the coming-of-age. One of the better flawed romances I've ever read. There are some seriously damaged people in this book, but they find a certain peace in spite of it all. In addition to the great romance and coming of age, this is also a brilliant look at life in a small time. The erotic scenes are damn impressive as well. Very explicit and very well done.\n\nSeptember 3, 2020\n\nOne of my favorite stories ever!"
