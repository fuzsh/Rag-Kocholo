        "text": "Stephen King Defends Tabitha King After Headlines Call Her Just ‘His Wife’\n\nStephen King’s not having it. He and his wife, novelist Tabitha King, are taking the media to task for not giving her the respect she deserves.\n\n“My wife is rightly pissed by headlines like this: ‘Stephen King and his wife donate $1.25M to New England Historic Genealogical Society,’” he shared in a Facebook post on February 28.\n\nRELATED: Here's Why You Should Be a Feminist\n\nThe best-selling horror novelist let fans know right off the top that he and his wife are not happy with the media’s coverage of the couple’s recent donation to the New England Historic Genealogical Society. According to Stephen, the donation of $1.25 million was originally her idea. Further, as he explains, neither was happy with the media addressing the couple in its coverage as “Stephen King and his wife.”\n\nStephen shared the short letter from Tabitha as follows:\n\nDear Editors (married to a wife or a husband):\n\nIn recent media coverage of a gift that my husband (ironic usage) and I made to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society, we became Stephen King and his wife.\n\nWife is a relationship or status. It is not an identity.\n\nYou could have made other choices. You could have referred to me as OfStephen. Or His Old Lady. Or His-Ball-And-Chain.\n\nI have sons. You could have referred to me as Mother-of-Novelists. I have a daughter but wouldn’t it be just silly to refer to me as Mother-of-Clergy?\n\nI’m seventy. I thought I would give you permission, if “OfTabitha” predeceases me, to title my obituary, Relick of Stephen King.\n\nIn the meantime, you might consider the unconscious condescension in your style book, and give women their names\n\nFor many fans, Tabitha King is just as accomplished as her husband. For instance, she is the author of eight books, and is considered an accomplished writer on her own. Fans of the Kings were quick to show support, with many commenting that they were even bigger fans of Tabitha than Stephen.\n\nStephen and Tabitha King aren’t the only famous names to complain about the wife not getting her proper respect. In May 2018, actress Gabrielle Union spoke out after a Florida news station tweeted “.@DwyaneWade, wife donates $200,000 to student-ran gun control rally.”\n\n“When they let you know what they think of you,” she clapped at the news station. “I have a name.”\n\nYou Might Also Dig:"
