Tabitha King is an award winning writer who just happens to be married to another popular novelist.

Neither of the writers shy away from speaking out against injustice and very recently Tabitha expressed her annoyance at everyday sexism she encountered in the media. Her husband Stephen used his extremely popular Twitter account to spread her message, and point out the blatant sexism in their headline and article where Tabitha was merely ‘Stephen King’s wife’.
