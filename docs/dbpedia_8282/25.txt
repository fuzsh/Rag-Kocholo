They don't ask 'Cause they know I'll say It ain't nothin' Just another woman done walked away Still on track No I ain't phased I rock on all night long Just playing this masquerade [Chorus] I got everybody thinking I'm Superman strong But that big ole' "S" Ain't on my chest At night when I get home And one look at my reflection And lone is all I see I can tell 'em all That I'm glad you're gone But the truth is I can't lie to me Call you up To get shot down Throw my pride aside And I just cry out loud Call my bluff Now just look at me A fool in love And all tore up Down here on my knees [Chorus: x 2]
