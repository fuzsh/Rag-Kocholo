        "text": "Berklee College of Music (Major: Performance/Professional Music). Blair School of Music (Major: Orchestral Percussion). Over 25 years of teaching experience. Chad started his career at just 14 years old with Tommy Cash, younger brother of country music legend Johnny Cash. He has also toured with\n\nLonnie Mack, Denny Jiosa, Kirk Whalum, Pat Coil, and Clay Davidson.\n\nWhat do you love about teaching?\n\nThe challenge of starting a new student from the beginning regardless of his or her background is very rewarding at the end of the day. I have had many students that have become professional musicians over the years and this is what makes teaching so enjoyable for me.\n\nWhat is your favorite musical style, band or song?\n\nAll styles would best describe what I like, from Jazz to Latin, funk, and hard rock. Favorite album: would have to be âCity Nightsâ by Allan Holdsworth.\n\nPlease describe your teaching style. What can a parent expect their child to learn?\n\nI usually gather an individualâs personal musical interest, and then we set certain goals based on their level. For drum set students, I focus on teaching all styles of music, starting out with four way coordination, getting the correct sounds from the drum set, and ultimately developing good time and feel.\n\nExpect to learn all styles, such as Funk Grooves, Afro-Cuban styles to R&amp;B, and the polished studio grooves of the 80s and 90s. For more advanced students, I like to focus on specific things that might be of\n\ninterest, or, need improvement, such as, sight-reading, linear drumming, and rhythm and meter studies.\n\nRegardless of what level a particular student may be, I enjoy the musical journey in making them the very\n\nbest that they can be.\n\nFor Lessons:"
