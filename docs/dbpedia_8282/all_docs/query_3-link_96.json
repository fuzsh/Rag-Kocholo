        "text": "The brothers are back with another album of bluegrass, folk and country music in their laconic, easy-going style.\n\nAt times the songs themselves dip into bland and cliched lyrical territory but if you can get past that, take a long drive or kick back on a sunny afternoon and relish the exceptional musicianship on display. Banjo, fiddle and mandolin are their go-to instruments and here they weave some fine melodies and solos that dance and spark off each other with a lightness of touch. Thankfully, though impressive, the frenetic playing is broken up by some quieter moments such as the winsome title track, the slow ache of ‘I Won’t Give Up’ and the gorgeous instrumental ‘Pending Arrival’.\n\nChris Familton"
