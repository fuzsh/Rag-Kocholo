        "text": "So many great artists have played our Taste of Country over the past 20 years. Back in 2001, the first one ever at the ballpark (then called Dunn Tire Park), one of the performing artists was newcomer, Clay Davidson.\n\nIt was in February of 2000, when Davidson released his debut single, \"Unconditional.\" It went on to peak at #3 in July on both the Mediabase and Billboard country airplay charts. The song was blocked from #1 by two huge hits, \"I Hope You Dance\" by Lee Ann Womack and \"Yes!\" by Chad Brock.\n\nWritten by Rivers Rutherford, Deanna Bryant and Liz Hengber, the song would be the title track off Davidson's debut album.\n\nUnfortunately, the next two singles from the album (\"I Can't Lie to Me\" and \"Sometimes\") failed to make the top 20 on Billboard.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, Clay Davidson would be involved in a near-fatal tour bus accident that was caused by his bus driver falling asleep at the wheel. Luckily, nobody was killed but injuries did occur. Davidson would cancel many of his tour dates and would eventually leave the music business.\n\nIn 2016, he would form a country duo Damn Davidsons, with his brother.\n\n\"Unconditional\" makes you think and appreciate the loved ones in your life. It's a song that makes you realize why you love country music."
