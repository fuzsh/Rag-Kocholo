One of Davidson’s greatest joys is being on stage and collaborating with other musicians. She comes from a musical family, singing and performing with her father since childhood and later writing songs together. She continues to co-write with him today in addition to other writers on the music scene.\n\nWhat are your fondest music memories growing up?\n\nHanging out with my family and my siblings and performing in Community Theatre.\n\nCan your remember the first time you wrote a song?\n\nI can’t. I think in some ways I’ve written almost all my life — melodies and poems and just never committed to it being songwriting. The first song I seriously wrote was “Hear Me” off my first EP with my father."
