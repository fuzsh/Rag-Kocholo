        "text": "\"Kanye west video is actually disturbing,\" one fan wrote while sharing Ye's music video. \"pete Davidson needs to sue and file a restraining order.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, Ye captioned his recent Instagram post: \"Art is therapy just like this view. art is protected as freedom of speech. art inspires and simplifies the world. Art is not a proxy for any ill or harm. Any suggestion otherwise about my art is false and mal intended.\"\n\nDavidson and Kardashian have not publicly responded to the video but last week the SKIMS founder liked a tweet in which director James Gunn defended \"The Suicide Squad\" actor.\n\nKardashian has made it clear that she is concerned about Ye's repeated posts about Davidson, who he refers to as \"Skete.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nOn February 4, Kardashian spoke out publicly for the first time about Ye's comments, writing on her Instagram Story that Ye's \"obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all.\"\n\nA post shared by ye (@kanyewest)\n\nLater, Ye shared a text in a now-deleted Instagram post where Kardashian had tried to ask the rapper to stop speaking about Davidson because it was creating a \"dangerous and scary environment.\"\n\nYe wrote that he would \"handle the situation\" with \"Skete.\""
