        "text": "Chances are good that if one of the highest profile recording artists of the day released a music video featuring a claymation version of you or I being buried alive with flowers growing out of our head, we’d be, at the very least, concerned.\n\nNot so with Pete Davidson. Following the release last week of a music video for the Kanye West-The Game collaboration, “Eazy,” the Saturday Night Live star “finds the fact that Kanye included a cartoon version of him in his music video hysterical,” a source told ET Online.\n\nThe song, which already raised eyebrows in January for lines like, “God saved me from that crash just so I could beat Pete Davidson’s ass,” saw Kanye placing his ill feelings toward his ex’s new beau front and center. The Gumby-esque animation style (and, yes, that opening riff is a hat tip to the old kiddie TV show, once sampled by the late rapper Eazy-E, whose name inspires a play-on-words throughout the song) swiftly turns dark, showing a clay Davidson getting kidnapped, buried up to his neck, and transforming into flora. Though off-screen, it is assumed Davidson’s avatar is also decapitated, as we do see his severed head in some shots. Unpleasant!\n\nNevertheless, ET’s source says that Davidson “is almost flattered by it all because it is so ridiculous to him.” Moreover, the comedic actor “is not threatened by Kanye in any way, shape or form” and “Kim [Kardashian] and Pete have grown closer from all of this.”\n\nAccording to People, however, Kardashian, who shares four children with West, is taking this more seriously. The fashion mogul and celebrity is reportedly “furious,” and, according to a source, is “really upset with Kanye that he’d do this.” The magazine continued, “she’s completely over all of this and she wants it to stop.”\n\nThe video concludes with text reading: “EVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER / EXCEPT SKETE YOU KNOW WHO / JK HE’S FINE.” Skete, it has been deduced, is West’s nickname for Davidson.\n\n(Less disturbing in all of this, but equally transgressive, is how Ye rhymes the word “together” with “together.”)\n\nAs it happens, the day of the “Eazy” video release coincided with a judge declaring Kardashian legally single, after many delays (like firing three previous lawyers) on West’s behalf.\n\nLate last week, Davidson and Kardashian were spotted together having fun at the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
