        "text": "Barbara Alan \"In Nashville\" (Mid Land Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by William Lee & Jack Logan)\n\nA lounge singer from Saint Louis, Missouri, Barbara Alan was the runner-up in a talent contest sponsored by the Grand Ole Opry as part of its fiftieth anniversary celebrations. I guess that's kinda like playing horseshoes, though, 'cause a couple of years later, she was still playing the bar at the Best Western Inn. But what the heck? She was still a working musician, and she got to make an album in Nashville, with Buddy Emmons playing steel and Phil Baugh playing guitar. This is an appealing album, although it does have a rather static feel... Ms. Alan says that Patsy line was her hero, and you can definitely hear it in her singing (though perhaps filtered through the rougher tones of Kitty Wells...) though there's not a lot of variety to her style, she's still kind of appealing. The real problem was with the studio crew -- they just don't seem that into it, and don't give her a lot, and while there are much more going-through-the-motions albums to be found, this one does suffer nonetheless. What's cool about this album is the odd song selection -- she sings some pop standards by Gershwin and Berlin, a few country oldies by folks like Eddie Miller and Bill Monroe, as well as one by Wayne P. Walker (who's always a personal favorite of mine) but there are some odd entries that I think are unique to this album... \"Walking Midnight Road\" is the least of these, an odd ripoff of Patsy Cline's \"Walking After Midnight, while \"Walk On The Wild Side\" is a pretty good honkytonk novelty number, where the singer balances six days of fun against one day of repentance and concludes that's a straight ticket to Hell. Perhaps the most interesting track is \"I Don't Know,\" a song written by Bill Adams, that's a sort of sideways gospel tune, written by a person who questions their faith because of all the horrible things God lets happen. I also enjoyed their bar-band funk rendition of \"Blue Moon Of Kentucky,\" which is solid private-record kitsch. On balance, I thought this was a nice, sincere record made by a gal who for whatever reasons maybe didn't get the best treatment when she made the trek to Nashville. And so she came in second...? Well, she made a record, and that's more than most of us have done! So who even cares who came in first?\n\nUrel Albert \"One Man's Woman At A Time\" (Cinnamon Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Elgio)\n\nAn oddball novelty artist whose best-known work is in a long string of far-flung indie-label singles, Missouri native Urel Albert was a professional country music imitator, doing impressions of folks like Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Johnny Cash and the like... He had a few songs that grazed the back end of the Top 100, but mostly Albert was a plugger, relying on live shows for his bread and butter. Albert also recorded a few football-related private pressing singles (rah! rah! go Buckeyes!) which seems to have been a viable gig for under-the-radar country singers in the late '70s... Anyway, there's some straight country stuff on here, as well as some impressions, which, frankly I don't think were all that great, but they are kind of interesting in an odd, pop-culture way.\n\nUrel Albert \"Saturday Night In Nashville\" (Spar Records, 1974) (LP)\n\nRick Albright & One Of A Kind \"A New Flame\" (Harvest Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Carl Godin & Jim Lake)\n\nWell, yeah, I guess you could slate this guy from Saint Charles, Missouri as a \"country\" singer, though a heft dose of his repertoire (three songs) come from Bobby Goldsboro... Not to mention his covers of \"The Way We Were\" and Burt Bacharach's \"Say A Little Prayer.\" Still, you've got some Jimmy Webb (\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\"), Eddy Raven, John Denver, and a version of \"Welcome To My World.\" No pedal steel or fiddle, but his pop-lounge leanings are clearly balanced by a taste for twang... or countrypolitan ballads, at least. This set was recorded at the KBK Studios, in Saint Louis. No info on whether Albright played live gigs as well, or where, but if anyone out there knows more, I'm all ears.\n\nArrow Memphis \"Arrow Memphis\" (Intermountain Records, 1980) (LP)\n\nOriginally from Saint Louis, Missouri, these guys moved to Tucson, Arizona in the late '70s when the desert's country-rock scene was really hot... They became mainstays of the local scene, and at the time they made this album, were the house band at the Stumble Inn honkytonk bar. Lead singer Steve Williams bought a smooth, James Taylor-ish voice to front a solid outlaw country sound -- he later broke into the Nashville songwriting racket, penning several Top Forty hits, including \"Redneck Yacht Club\" (a chart-topper for Craig Morgan) and \"Where Have I Been All My Life,\" which was recorded by George Strait. And here's Williams and his pals, back in their longhaired glory... Pretty good stuff, though you can sure hear the commercial, Top 40 aspirations in there as well.\n\nEddy Asher \"Faded By The Night Life\" (Dry Holler Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Nelson & C. E. Asher)\n\nA singer who hailed from Springfield, Missouri, Eddie Asher packed this album with original material, with eight out of ten songs were written by Asher...\n\nJohnny Baker \"Songs Of The Rodeo\" (Audio Arts, 1964) (LP)\n\nIn the 1950s, over a decade before Moe Bandy, Chris LeDoux or Pake McEntire hung up their spurs, Missouri rodeo rider Johnny Baker became, as legend has it, the first professional cowpuncher to devote himself full-time to singing rodeo-related music. This was his first full-length LP, with a brace of songs so packed with with rodeo lingo that they had to include a glossary with the album. Keep loose, but hold on tight!\n\nJohnny Baker \"Let Her Buck\" (1965) (LP)\n\nJohnny Baker \"Rodeoin' With Johnny Baker\" (1966) (LP)\n\nJohnny Baker \"The Rodeo In The Sky\" (FF&S Sound Recordings, 1974) (LP)\n\nClunky, sure, but it's the real deal. Johnny Baker wasn't the greatest singer... or lyricist... or guitar picker... or humorist... But I imagine he was a pretty good rodeo rider, and he was certainly committed to his music, as his multiple albums attest. Though musically static, these tracks ooze authenticity, with Mr. Baker ruminating about various aspects of rodeo life while strumming solo on his acoustic geetar. Perhaps the funniest number is \"Microphone Bandit,\" in which a rodeo announcer razzes Baker by saying -- over the PA -- that if that's how he rides, maybe he should stick to playing guitar. So, yeah, Johnny Baker didn't take himself too seriously and he certainly was aware of his limitations as a musician, but he plugged away and had fun doing what he was doing, and that translates pretty well when you give him a spin. Not exactly the kind of record you'd listen to over and over, but it's got its charms.\n\nThe Baldknobbers - see artist profile\n\nTom Bark \"Cosmopolitan Redskin\" (Leprechaun Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Mike O'Neill & John Moseley)\n\nKansas City singer Tom Bark was a for-real Native American, so the album title isn't as weird as you might think... Over the years he moved through a series of local rock bands, although this solo album has a definite country flavor. Sure, there's scary stuff like conga drums and cowbells, but pedal steel player Roger Workman added some legit twang: he also played on the first album by the Jolly Brothers band, which is a KC alt-country classic. Most of the songs here were Tom Bark originals, including the title track, as well as \"Mayes County Jail,\" and \"Crooked Politician Blues\" -- \"Oklahoma Rodeo Queen\" was penned by local folkie Dana Cooper a few years earlier.\n\nThe Barleen Trio \"Country Favorites With Curt Burrell\" (Eve In The Sky Sound, 1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Randy Miotke)\n\nThe family band trio of siblings Barbara, Brenda and Jeff Barleen started out singing in their Kansas hometown, but pursued music professionally after the family moved to Missouri and they became part of the Ozark Mountain country scene. They were bolstered by the addition of singer-fiddler Curt Burrell, who married Barbara and emerged as a solo vocalist. By the time this album was recorded, they had moved to a gig in Estes Park, Colorado -- where they ran their own venue -- and they're joined on the recording sessions by steel player Donny Cook and lead guitar Gary Cook. The Barleens recorded numerous other albums, though most of these came out as cassette-only releases.\n\nBill Beeny, Margaret Beeny & The Westerners \"Sonny Boy\" (Temple Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nThe Beenys were, I believe, married couple from Saint Louis, Missouri who evangelized in the area as well as recording several albums of all gospel material, including both standards and songs they themselves wrote. I'm not sure about the time-frame for these uber-indie albums (some of which didn't even have cardboard jackets!) but I think they were made in the late 1960s or early '70s. Turns out Mr. Beeny was a more-than-colorful character, a rabid right-winger of the John Birch-ian variety: Beeny ran an \"anticommunist ranch\" near Wright City, and formed a group called CROSS (Counter-Revolutionary Organization on Salvation and Service) which sponsored classes to train its members to use guns, so they could mix it up withe the hippies and Black Panthers, in case the forces of godless anarchy ever tried to invade the Ozarks. A staunch segregationist, Beeny ran unsuccessfully for statewide office, and was a supporter of George Wallace's 1968 presidential run. He also had ongoing legal problems -- mostly on tax issues -- and was kicked out of several positions as a pastor in Southern Baptist churches. The best part comes years later, though, when Beeny mellowed a little and became an Elvis Presley conspiracy theorist, opening the \"Elvis Is Alive Museum,\" which he ran until 2007, when he sold his Presley relics on eBay. Jinkies. What a nut! (Thanks to Wikipedia for filling in the blanks.)\n\nBill And Margaret Beeny & The Westerners \"Heaven's Hall Of Fame\" (Temple Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nBill And Margaret Beeny & The Westerners \"Circuit Ridin' Preacher\" (Temple Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nThis album includes a twenty-minute long sermon entitled \"Are There Communists In Our Churches?\" along with the title track and \"Heaven's Hall Of Fame\" (which appears on another Beeny album) and versions of oldies such as \"Did You Think To Pray,\" \"Supper Time,\" et. al. The sermon sounds pretty fun!\n\nBlack Stallion \"...Featuring Benny Mahan\" (Black Stallion Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Belknap & Frank Westbrook)\n\nA country-oriented album featuring Springfield, Missouri's Benny Mahan (1944-2009) a regionally popular vocalist who started his career back in the 'Sixties, singing blues and soul, and was a longtime member of the local R&B band Granny's Bathwater, which toured nationally. This twangy album marked a real shift in direction, though Mahan's bluesy roots are never far from the surface. Black Stallion included Benny Mahan on vocals, with Kenny Cox (bass and guitar), Randy Gipson (steel guitar),Rex Meredith (lead guitar), Stan Smith (drums), and Frank Westbrook on piano and keyboards... Not sure how long the group was together, though this seems to have been their only record. All but three songs were originals written or co-written by Benny Mahan, with the exceptions being \"Cajun Keyboards\" an instrumental by Westbrook, and covers of \"Since You've Been Gone\" and Wayne Carson's \"Bugle Ann.\" Mahan's tunes include tracks such as \"Black Satin Stallion,\" \"Honky Tonk Blood\" and \"Swamper,\" a tune he re-recorded two decades later with the band Howie & The Hellcats.\n\nBlue Mountain Classics \"Live In Concert\" (Muddy Creek Productions, 1981) (LP)\n\nA bluegrass-based band that performed in the cast of a Missouri-based \"opry\" venue called the Ozark Mountain Jamboree, Blue Mountain Classics started out as a bluegrass trio featuring brothers Ben and Paul Weatherford. In stepping up to the Jamboree's main stage, the group took a more country- and rock-flavored sound, delivering zippy (one might even say slightly frantic) versions of contemporary hits by harmony-oriented Top Forty groups such as the Statler Brothers and the Gatlins. This album was recorded live at the Jamboree, and there's something a little too rickety and unsure about these performances, though as always it's nice to have a snapshot of what these regional \"opry\" bands sounded like in concert. Didn't do much for me, but it's okay.\n\nBlue Ridge \"Country Music\" (Ridge Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dean Raymer & Randy Hauser)\n\nA quartet from St. Ann, Missouri, led by songwriter Bill Highley...\n\nBlue Ridge \"Country Music\" (Ridge Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dean Raymer & Randy Hauser)\n\nThis second album (same title, different songs) was recorded in Nashville with studio musicians Mike Shrimpf on keyboards.\n\nBluegrass Brigade \"Happy I'll Be\" (Ozark Opry Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by R. N. Parker & Jim Phinney)\n\nA straight-up bluegrass band from Kansas City, Missouri, who seem to have been connected to Lee Mace's Ozark Opry, and recorded this album at Mace's studio in Osage Beach. This was their first album, with the band made up of Jack Burlison on guitar, Mae Burlison (bass), Rusty Dutton (banjo and fiddle), Jim McGreevy (banjo and mandolin), and Don Montgomery on fiddle. Though on a couple of tunes they hit an overly-folkie tone, on most others, though, thee's an old-timey Appalachian feel that's quite compelling, particularly on the group harmonies which find Ms. Burlison's voice as their anchor. The Brigade went on to self-release a couple of albums of their own and appear to have played a lot of regional gigs throughout the 'Eighties.\n\nThe Bluemont Singers \"At The Castaway\" (Brass Record Company, 1964) (LP)\n\n(Produced by George W. Hodes, Jr.)\n\nReal-deal, genuine 'Sixties folk revival material from a clean-cut Kansas City quintet that used to play at a venue called Castaways. This is less country-oriented than most of the records I'm reviewing here, but I just couldn't resist the Midwest connection. Plus, these folks were pretty good -- they play straight-up Kingston Trio/Backporch Majority-style coffeehouse folk, bluesy acoustic folk, prim spirituals and some decent bluegrass, too. Really, they were on a par with what bands were playing on the East Coast, with just a hint of the jugband scene as well. The group included founding members Larry Dimmit, Galen Slifer and Dave Warner, joined by bassist Byron Schlosser and a gal banjo player, Jackie Haines, who was a pretty good picker. A little-known but pretty sharp regional folk group, definitely worth a spin if you like the style.\n\nBob-O-Links \"Country Born...\" (American Artist Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Higgins)\n\nThis was the first souvenir album made for the Bob-O-Links Country Hoe-Down, a Branson, Missouri mom'n'pop opry show started in 1977 by Bob Mabe, one of several brothers who started the Baldknobbers Jamboree back in 1959. He and his wife Sue Mabe quit the Baldknobbers in 1976 and started this venue the following year, parking it near a motel and restaurant they also owned in the area. One thing leaps out at you right away: the wealth of country music talent that existed outside of Nashville. This was a very skilled and professional-sounding ensemble, with Bob Mabe as emcee, steel player Byron Arnold (a veteran of the 'Sixties Ozark scene), as well as Steve Crouch (drums), Rick Friend (banjo and guitar), Linda Henry (vocals), Randy Newman (fiddle), and Johnny Patton on lead guitar. Singer-pianist Donna Hale solos on a couple of tracks (later she changed her name to Donna Dixon); also featured are comic Don Koonce (later billed as \"Tom Thumbpickitt\") and the Rex Burdette Family cloggers, aka \"The Hoe-Downers.\" The repertoire is notably modern, mostly contemporary hits with a couple of faves from the 'Sixties, such as \"Tippy Toein',\" and \"You Gave Me A Mountain,\" as well as a little outlaw stuff, like \"Luckenbach, Texas.\" There are some oldies, but not the same proportion of bluegrass and gospel you'd normally see in these Ozark opry shows, so maybe when he started out Mabe wanted to set himself apart from his old venue. Whatever the plan was, the record sounds good... A bit manic, but still pretty solid.\n\nBob-O-Links \"Country '83\" (Aardvark Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kenny Gott & Ralph Plank)\n\nFun stuff... I like this one! Many of the musicians are the same, with a few new faces... Bob Mabe is still emcee and leader of the band, picking, singing and cracking corny jokes, zipping through a jovial performance packed with contemporary hits such as John Anderson's \"Swingin',\" Guy Clark's \"Heartbroke,\" \"Come On In,\" and \"Tennessee River,\" as well as some oldies (\"Why Baby Why\" and \"Last Date\"), a little dab of bluegrass and a bunch of gospel tunes to close things out. Sue Mabe plays piano, with Eddie Lane on lead guitar, Arnie Arnold (steel guitar), Donna Dalton (piano), Randy Newman on fiddle, Don McAlee (banjo), Steve Maples (bass), Linda Henry on vocals and Don Koonce providing comic relief as \"Tom Thumbpickitt\" and even some clogging by the Burdette Family Square Dancers. Honestly, I do enjoy this album... there's no original content, but the band is into it and projects an air of joyfulness that doesn't always come through on this kind of souvenir album. They also get surprisingly funky on some of the opening numbers, with some playful guitar licks and lively rhythm. Worth a spin!\n\nBob-O-Links \"Country '84\" (1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kenny Gott & Ralph Plank)\n\nThe following year, covers included \"Long Tall Texan,\" \"Houston,\" \"Y'All Come Back Saloon,\" and \"He Stopped Loving Her Today,\" along with more oldies, less bluegrass, and another round of gospel tunes to finish things off... There are also dips into more pop/soul territory, with versions of \"Slow Dance\" and \"Take Me To The River.\" I'm not sure if the band had the same lineup as on the previous record... I'm also not sure if this one came out on vinyl, or only on cassette, or if other records came out beside these two. The Bob-O-Links show, which was the fifth variety revue opened in Branson, had a large, 1800-seat amphitheater, and was run by Bob and Sue Mabe until the early 1990s, when they sold the venue to another group.\n\nBob-O-Links \"Tuesday Night Live\" (Aard-Vark Recording, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kenny Gott & John Jacobson & Mark Roy)\n\nA 2-LP set spanning bluegrass, gospel and contemporary country... The inclusion of a couple of Waylon & Willie tunes -- \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys,\" \"On The Road Again\" -- and a cover of \"Elvira\" leads me to think this probably came out around 1980, '81 or thereabouts.\n\nDewayne Bowman \"Dewayne Bowman\" (Antique Records, 1984) (LP)\n\nGood ol' boy Dewayne Bowman was a local star in Southwestern Missouri, near the Oklahoma border, playing main in his own bar, the Paint Stallion, located in Joplin, Missouri. This album was recorded in nearby Pittsburg, Kansas, and is pretty much straight-up honkytonk country, with slightly slick early '80s production. He's a little stiff as a singer, but it's the thought that counts. Fans of Moe Bandy might dig this guy, too.\n\nDewayne Bowman \"Dewayne Bowman\" (Antique Records, 2001) (CD)\n\nA reissue CD that includes all the tracks off his 1984 album, along with some more recent recordings.\n\nTerry Ray Bradley \"It Just Keeps Getting Better\" (J.E.K. Records/Kennett Sound Studios, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Keene)\n\nA nice, mellow set of rockabilly-tinged indie twang from a Missouri crooner who sounds quite a bit Elvis-y, with a velvety baritone and generally relaxed vibe. Mostly these are soft ballads, with a gentle rock backbeat... Some tracks are more country than others, such as producer Joe Keene's \"I've Got A Lot To Get Over,\" which has a pure early '60s Nashville Sound feel. Another album highlight is his version of Bill Rice's \"Hand Of Hurt,\" which is a solid country weeper. Ex-rockabilly-gone-country-star Narvel Felts contributes laudatory liner notes, and that gives you a pretty good sense of where Bradley was coming from... Fans of retrobilly crooners such as Crash Craddock, Narvel Felts and Orion might dig this as well. It's not electrifying, but it's heartfelt and musically solid.\n\nBranson \"When We Sing For Him\" (Ramblin' Records, 1986) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Salem)\n\nA southern gospel performance, recorded live on August 30, 1986 at a venue called Country Music World, in lovely downtown Branson, Missouri. This creatively-named vocal quartet is backed by a group called the NightWay Band, with pedal steel (Obie Jones), banjo (Danney Yancey), bass, drums and keyboards. Not sure if they made any other records...\n\nBrewer & Shipley -- see artist profile\n\nLeon Briggs \"Dreamin' Again\" (1987) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ron Roberts & David Gilmore)\n\nRough-hewn, stripped-down country story-songs with bare-bones arrangements and straightforward production... Kansas City singer-songwriter Leon Briggs was formerly in the band Midnight Flyer and had kind of a Merle Haggard vibe to him, both vocally and in his musical approach, and while this fine DIY album lacks pedal steel, there's fiddle, banjo and dobro adding the right amount of twang, and a loose, chunky sound that gives it a distinctive feel. Briggs has a few rough edges as well, as heard on \"Nothin' In A Name,\" a novelty song about a guy who can't be bothered to remember (or learn) the name of whatever woman he's with at the moment, or \"Old Whiskey And Young Girls,\" which has a similarly dude-centric point of view that almost drifts into Hank Jr./Toby Keith territory... A nice indie twang set from the heartland... These songs were all originals, written between 1980-87.\n\nLeon Briggs & Peter Fisher \"Hang And Rattle\" (2008)\n\nI'm guessing this is the same guy, just twenty years later... Anyone know if he recorded anything else?\n\nBrother Love \"Brother Love\" (Kennett Sound Studios, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Keene)\n\nThe trio of Gary Blanchard, Mike Glisson and Clyde Brown got a little assist from rocker Terry Bradley and some other folks in the orbit of the Kennett Sound Studios in Kennett, Missouri. They played all cover songs, including an Elvis Presley medley, KC & the Sunshine Band's \"I Like To Do It,\" a tune by Jesse Winchester, one from Roy Orbison tune, and a rockabilly-era Charlie Rich song as well as a version of \"The End Is Not In Sight,\" from the Amazing Rhythm Aces. Eclectic, to be sure!\n\nJohnny Bruce \"Carroll County Fiddler\" (WW Sound Service, 197--?) (LP)\n\nMissouri master musician Johnny Ray Bruce (1939-1992) came from a musical family and owned a 120-acre family farm near Bosworth, Missouri, a microscopic, hyper-rural crossroads about an hour or so east of Kansas City. Mr. Bruce was known as \"the Carroll Country Fiddler,\" referring to his family home (and not to any of the twelve other US Carroll Counties, located in Arkansas, Georgia, et.al.) Though he was a show-me stater through and through, it's worth noting that this album was made with the help of several Nebraska bluegrassers, namely Steven O. Hansen and couple of guys in his band, Bluegrass Crusade -- Hansen was a local hero in Omaha, known in part for his gig backing country star C. W. McCall. The full lineup on this album includes Johnny Bruce on fiddle, fellow Missourian Dave Fowler on second fiddle, Oklahoman Elston Murphy guesting on harmonica, and Nebraska lads Steven O. Hansen (banjo and mandolin), Terry B. Schmitt (guitar), Ron Taylor on bass. (They also played on Hansen's own solo album, which was also released through WW Sound Service...) Johnny Bruce was deeply involved in preserving the state's traditional music, participating in countless folk festivals while mentoring younger musicians; he apparently died in an auto accident in 1992. The Missouri State Old Time Fiddlers Association digitally re-released this album along with tracks from a second album, Carroll County Fiddler #2 which I haven't been able to find mention of elsewhere...\n\nAlbert E. Brumley, Jr. \"Legendary Gospel Favorites\" (Memory Valley Records, 1986-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Vic Clay & Jackson Brumley)\n\nThe son -- or rather, sons -- of country gospel pioneer Albert E. Brumley pay homage to their father's work. The senior Mr. Brumley (1905-1977) wrote ebullient spiritual classics such as \"I'll Fly Away\" and \"Turn Your Radio On,\" along with hundreds of other songs that remain bedrocks of the American gospel canon. Albert E. Junior sings lead on these two albums, recorded at the same time with a crew that included producer Vic Clay on lead guitar, Bruce Watkins (banjo, fiddle, mandolin), Terry McMillan (drums, harmonica), and of course his brother, Tom Brumley, an influential steel guitarist known for his work with Buck Owens and country-rock pioneer Rick Nelson. Several pianists also sat in on the sessions, most intriguingly Tennessee's then-governor Lamar Alexander(!), who tickled the ivories on both albums. Although their father was born in Oklahoma, the Brumley family had relocated to Missouri by the time the boys were born, though of course Nashville beckoned when the time came to make these records...\n\nAlbert E. Brumley, Jr. \"Sentimental Favorites\" (Memory Valley Records, 1986-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Vic Clay & Jackson Brumley)\n\nThis album includes the same backing band as above\n\nJeannie Bryant \"What Our Feelings Have To Say\" (Column One Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim Martin & Jim Vest)\n\nBureman & O'Rourke \"Strawberry Pickin's\" (Pearce Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Stapleton)\n\nThe Kansas City-based duo of Bruce Bureman and Tim O'Rourke seem to have taken their cues from the more established Brewer & Shipley, mixing anthemic soft rock with country and folk. They recorded at least two albums in the '70s and have played together for decades since... Sweet, spacey, folkie, rock'n'country musings.\n\nBureman & O'Rourke \"Somebody Give Me A Smile\" (Happiness Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Allen Blasco)\n\nA great record, though you wouldn't suspect from the goofy album art that this album would have such an expansive, polished pop sound... It opens with several soft-rock anthems, stuff that bigger bands such as Bread or America would be proud of... Their twangy side soon kicks in, sending them into pleasantly country-tinged tuned like \"Tomorrow There's A New Sun,\" which features the steel guitar of Lynne Pillar. The Brewer & Shipley influence is still there, and in a very nice way... There are rough edges, sure but that's part of the DIY charm... Devotees of hippie rock will enjoy these melodic stoner pop songs...\n\nShirley Caddell/Shirley Collins - see artist discography\n\nThe Calton Family \"The Old And New\" (Professional Artist Recording Company, 1976-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Parvin Tramel & Dick Grady)\n\nA family band, with Charles Calton on fiddle and mandolin, joined by Jimmy Bunch on banjo... They play a mix of (mostly) bluegrass and country, including a Paul Craft song, one by Mel Tillis and a tune called \"My Oklahoma\" by Steve Young, along with bluegrass and old-timey tunes by Flatt & Scruggs, the Carter Family and others. There's one original, \"Minor Repairs,\" composed by Jimmy Bunch. They recorded in Saint Louis, though I'm not 100% sure if they were from Missouri, but Mr. Bunch certainly was: he was a founding member of the Missouri-based bluegrass band, Cedar Hill, and also worked at Silver Dollar City and other regional Ozark venues.\n\nClay & Vicki Campbell \"Clay & Vicki Campbell\" (Phone Records, 1975) (LP)\n\nThe Campbells were a country lounge duo from Bland, Missouri (that's a place, not a value judgment...) They were very young, although poking around online I couldn't determine whether they were they married or siblings. Anyone know for sure? This studio album was recorded at Kajac Studios in Carlisle, Iowa.\n\nClay & Vicki Campbell \"Live!\" (C&V Records, 1976-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Clay Campbell)\n\nThis live album -- recorded at the Paddock Steakhouse in South Sioux City, Nebraska -- captures their country music stage show, complete with comedy skits and impersonations of Nashville stars such as Freddy Fender, Hank Snow and Marty Robbins. Clay plays fiddle while Vicki Campbell sings a version of Jessi Colter's 1975 hit, \"I'm Not Lisa\" as well as the \"Girl's Medley.\"\n\nClay Campbell \"Clay Campbell\" (Fiddler Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nHe released two self-titled solo albums with different cover art on each one -- it's possible they're the same record, re-released, but I dunno for sure. Yet.\n\nSteve Cantrell \"Memories Of Years Past\" (Ozark Records, 1978-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Buddy Lane)\n\nHomegrown honkytonk by a fella from Seymour, Missouri. About half the songs are credited to J. S. Cantrell, including tunes such as \"A Year Ago Today,\" \"Lonely Guitar Pickin' Country Music Lovin' Man,\" \"Thinking Of You Again,\" and the title track, \"Memories Of Years Past.\" Some other songs may have been originals penned by some of his pals, though he also tackles a few country classics, like \"Break My Mind,\" \"Springtime In Alaska\" and Jud Strunk's \"A Daisy A Day.\" The backing musicians were guys who worked in various local Ozark \"oprys\" as well as in the regional southern gospel scene, including drummer Jerry Dooley, fiddler Frank Ellis, Stan Friend (guitar), Mike McGee (steel guitar) and Gene Reasoner on piano. It's not clear whether Mr. Cantrell really ever pursued music full-time; he worked at a few different local \"produce auctions,\" which seem to be like farmers markets on steroids... Other than that, not a lot of info.\n\nThumbs Carllile - see artist discography\n\nB. J. Carnahan \"You Ain't Never Had Lonesome\" (History Records, 1974)\n\n(Produced by Gordon Terry & Charlie Bragg)\n\nApparently Missouri native Billy Joe Carnahan was an old fishing buddy of Johnny Cash's -- that's what Mr. Cash says in his liner notes -- and they were stationed together in Germany when Cash was in the Army, before he came home and started his music career. So, they go back a ways. Carnahan recorded this album at Cash's studio, the House Of Cash, with his own local band augmented by studio pros such as Jimmy Capps, Charlie McCoy, drummer D. J. Fontana, Hargus Robbins and Earl Ball on piano, and hillbilly old-timer Gordon Terry playing fiddle, as well as producing the album. Terry also contributes one song to the album, \"I Get Lonely Easy,\" though most of the songs are Carnahan originals, either written by him or by his relative Frank Carnahan. The band includes his brother Bob on bass, as well as several teenagers adding a youthful vibe, and gal singer Geri Whipple who is highlighted on a couple of duets, notably a version of \"Jackson\" which closes the album out. (Footnote: Cash also says that he used Carnahan's name in the song \"Don't Take Your Guns To Town\" when he recorded it years earlier... how's that for a little behind-the-scenes country music lore??)\n\nCharley Carnelison & The Apostolic Faith \"Bluegrass From The Heart\" (Canaan Valley Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\nBluegrass preacher Charley Carnelison grew up in Hollister, Missouri, and was living in Springfield when he began his recording career. When he was eighteen, he joined Jack Keithley's band, the Ozark Country Boys, before forming a duo with Johnny Holt a few years later. Carnelison and Holt played on the radio locally in the Branson area, and recorded together over the course of several years. Carnelison's signature song is a gospel tune called \"20-20 Vision,\" which bears a striking similarity to a secular heartsong recorded by Gene Autry way back in 1954 (and more famously in a bluegrass arrangement by Jimmy Martin) though he say he copyrighted his own version in 1967, first recording it in 1972. Mr. Carnelison cut several albums and published a collection of bluegrass gospel songs as well as a book of regional Ozark folklore. Eventually he quit performing due to hearing loss, but Carnelison his band 20-20 Vision were still performing locally well into the 21st Century, with a presence on Facebook and podcasting as well. These three albums seem to have dated back to the 1970s, though he also seems to have self-released a number of CDs, which are a lot harder to track down.\n\nCharley Carnelison & The Apostolic Faith \"America You're Drifting Away\" (Canaan Valley Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\nCharley Carnelison \"Presents The Gospel, Bluegrass Country Style\" (Pine Tree Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\nOn this album, Carnelison shares the spotlight with his pal Johnny Holt, as well as Ohio gospel singers J.D. Jarvis and Rose Jarvis, who hosted the sessions at a Cincinnati recording studio. They all sing lead on various tracks, with Carnelison in the spotlight for four of his own songs, a reprise of \"20-20 Vision,\" another oldie called \"I'm Longing To See That City,\" and two newer songs, \"One Drop\" and \"Today I Started Serving My Lord Again.\" The liner notes indicate that this was Carnelison's third album, and I'm assuming the two above on Canaan Valley were the first two. In addition to Holt and the Jarvises, the musicians include banjo players Noah Holland and Carlos Jones; Junior Bennett and Jimmie Dutton on fiddle; Lucky Jarvis playing rhythm guitar and Bill Woolum on dobro and bass -- the overlapping personnel and the liner notes reference to \"all four of the songs I recorded on this album\" leads me to believe this was actually kind of a semi-compilation rather than strictly a Carnelison LP.\n\nVernon Carr \"Roots Of My Raisin' \" (Glory Barn Sound, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Hargraves & John Moseley)\n\nThis custom label country-gospel album was recorded at the legendary Cavern Studios in Kansas City... Vernon Carr was an old-school country singer who grew up in Bakersfield, but moved to the Kansas City area later in life and became a prominent country gospel (as opposed to Southern gospel) performer. He also recorded at least one secular hard-country single in his youth (\"Country Music Fever\"/\"Breaking Point\") and includes a Hank Williams oldies on this album.\n\nJimmy Carter & Dallas County Green \"Summer Brings The Sunshine\" (BOC Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jimmy Carter, Brad Edwards & B. J. Carnahan)\n\nIndie twang from Missouri. Part of the sprawling network of local Ozark \"opry\" venues, Jimmy Carter's band included lead guitarist Bill Belky, Jerry Bell on bass, Mary Beth Lemons (vocals), Steve Lemons (rhythm guitar and keyboards), Steve Storey on drums, with a spotlight lead singer Elaine Fender, who later recorded an album of her own after moving through a few different bands.\n\nThe Chaparral Show Band \"The Chaparral Show Band\" (19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Clyde Orten)\n\nThe very epitome of a country bar band, these guys actually took their name from the bar they played at, a local bar in Caruthersville, Missouri called the Chaparral. The bar apparently sponsored this record, and naturally there are lots of pictures of the bar -- which looked pretty dismal -- as well as the band. Gal bandmember Linda Countess sings \"I'm Not Lisa,\" among an mostly-covers set that included a couple of relatively obscure songs, such as \"Has A Cat Got A Tail\" (a Tanya Tucker song recorded by Billy Crash Craddock) and Johnny Burnette's \"Big, Big World.\" The album kicks off with one original tune, \"I Ain't In A Long, Long Time,\" written by the band's saxophonist, Jerry Tuttle.\n\nRandle Chowning \"Hearts On Fire\" (A&M Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ron Bacchiocchi & Paul Leka)\n\nThe first solo album by Randle Chowning, a founding member of the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, and one of the pillars of the 1970s Missouri rock and country-rock scene. Methinks this is more of a pop/soft-pop set, but still worth having on our radar because of the Daredevils connection. Chowning plays guitar and mandolin (see? there is some twang!) and is backed by guitarist Ken Shepherd, a fellow Missourian returning the favor from when Chowning played on Shepherd's album of the previous year, Ken Shepherd And The Kenfolk. Randle Chowning apparently also performed and recorded under a couple of aliases, including \"Ozark Joe\" and \"R. C. And The Keys.\"\n\nGene Clark -- see artist profile\n\nThe Clearwater Jamboree Show \"The Clearwater Jamboree Show\" (Mel-Ran Records, 1969-?) (LP)\n\nThis group was an early version of the Plummer Family revue, a family-based \"opry\" show from Knob Lick, Missouri, that was one of the staples of the Branson-area country tourism scene. The Plummers are notable for the high percentage of original material written by one of the kids, Randy Plummer, and this disc was no exception. He contributes two songs of his own, as does lead singer Harley Clements, with additional tunes by Darrell Plummer, Bruce Watkins and his dad, Glen Watkins. The band members include Harley Clements (lead vocals), Ray Elders (lead guitar), Bill Haggard (steel guitar), Bruce Watkins (banjo and fiddle), Randy Plummer (drums), Darrell Plummer (guitar), Melody Plummer (lead vocals, bass) and Rosie Plummer (accordion) -- the liner notes say that this was the first recording by any of the artists, which is particularly noteworthy since fiddler Bruce Watkins later moved to Nashville and became a prolific usual-suspects studio musician who has played on countless recordings. (A Missouri native, the teenage picker later had a stint performing at nearby Silver Dollar City, moving to Nashville sometime on the late '70s, touring with southern gospel groups such as the Hemphills as a day job until the studio musician gig fell into place...) There's no date on the album, but since it includes a cover of the 1968 hit, \"Harper Valley PTA,\" I'd guess this disc came out around 1969 or thereabouts.\n\nKevin Cline \"Rumor Has It\" (BOC Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Brad Edwards)\n\nAll-original honkytonk from the heartland... Native sons of Weston, Missouri, Kevin W. Cline and his brother Ted cut their teeth performing at Buddy Boswell's Union Mill Opry in nearby Edgerton, starting 'way back in 1974. Later on, as seasoned veterans of the local country scene, they opened their own mom'n'pop opry, hosting live shows at the New Deal Tobacco Warehouse in their hometown of Weston, a tiny suburb on the north end of Kansas City. The brothers pursued various projects over the years, but rejoined forces and were still running a version of Cline's Opry well into the 2010s. This album is a a fine example of locals-only country... Kevin Cline wrote or co-wrote all of these songs, including a few writing partners such as Glenard Stephen Crowell, Darrell W. McClung and Henry Daniel Sage. The musicians were also all locals, including members of Cline's own band as well as folks from the AudioLoft studio in Mack's Creek: J.R. Bradford on drums, Kevin Cline (fiddle and guitar), Lisa Cline (vocals), Perry Edenburg (drums), Brad Edwards (bass and guitar), Monty Laffoon (steel guitar), Gene Reasoner (piano), Myron Smith and on steel guitar.\n\nJohn Paul Cody \"Reflections\" (Ironside Recording Studios, 1985-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Millsap)\n\nEarly 'Eighties mega-hunk John Paul Cody had a gig at Branson in the early '80s and recorded this album with a crew that looks like all locals, including Greg Bailey on rhythm guitar, David Evans (piano), Mitch Kiersey (electric guitar), David Milligan (bass), Craig White (drums), and backing vocals by Johnny Long and Jake Nicely. Two hefty chunks of time are taken up by a pair of medleys -- one a tribute to Elvis Presley, the other for Marty Robbins. There are some regular country songs on here, too, though I'm not sure if any were original to this album.\n\nShirley Collins/Shirley Collins Nelson - see artist discography\n\nJohn Corbin \"Let Me Sing A Song\" (BOC Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by B. J. Carnahan & Roger Wealand)\n\nAn oddball album of Appalachian-inflected dulcimer music by a guy who performed at the Silver Dollar City theme park in Branson, Missouri, which explains his recording on the normally country-oriented BOC label. John Corbin Goldsberry started playing hammered dulcimer at a park booth in the 1970s, and continued his residency for over four decades. He's backed here by a full band, including Steven Carter on mandolin, Jay Goumer (percussion), Don Jones (keyboards), Ron Meier (guitar), and Shawn Pittman on fiddle. In later years his act expanded to include his wife, Janice Marilyn Goldsberry, who he met in the late '80s. They recorded numerous albums together, though I think this may have been his first album. Not to be confused, methinks, with the Arkansas honkytonker below.\n\nCottonwood \"Cottonwood\" (Magic Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Keith Brown & Cottonwood)\n\nNot to be confused with the hippie-era rockers of the same name, this Midwestern, disco-era trio were aiming for a Poco-meets-Eagles country-rock sound, but along the way they plowed their way through some truly horrible musical ideas. Matters are complicated by the weak vocals of two bandmembers, bassist David Spier and drummer Bob Rolens, although their lead guitar player Larry Rolens cuts loose on a few hard-rock anthems (\"Movin' On,\" etc.) and his voice is fine, as are his bar-band rock instincts. But honestly, a lot of this album is pretty torturous, particularly the more AOR-oriented numbers, with chunky power chords and grandiose pop-schmaltz arrangements that were meant to mimic the pop music on the radio. Oh, well. It's still a good example of the music being made by \"real folks\" in the '70s, but it's one of the more painful indie-twang albums I've come across. Nonetheless, the band has a pretty interesting story. The trio was from Saint Louis, and in the early '70s had a band called The Nashville Enterprise (see below) which also included \"girl\" singer Vonna Faye. That band toured regionally, but apparently didn't last too long. Then there was Cottonwood, which later re-formed as the more overtly rock-oriented, late-'80s bar band, Bay Wolfe, which is notable for helping start the career of Top Forty redneck country queen Gretchen Wilson. After this hair-band folded, the Rolens brothers went deeper into the country music mainstream, with Larry Rolens joining the Bellamy Brothers and Bob Rolens helping anchor Wilson's band, after which he became part of the Well Hungarians indie-twang band. Anyway, this early work is an iffy record, at best: the bar-band rock numbers and the twangier tunes are okay, but the pop-oriented numbers are a bummer. But from humble beginnings...\n\nA Country Band \"Music By A Country Band\" (Golden Eagle Records, 1973-?) (LP)\n\nBehold: the most generic country record ever made! I couldn't resist. I mean, yeah sure, it cost me fifty-one cents and I was sure it wasn't going to be very good, but how could I pass this one by? This seems to have been a souvenir album made by the Golden Eagle label, which produced several albums in the 1970s which I believe were part of a tourist attraction related to the old steamboat industry... Anyway, turns out this album is actually pretty good -- two young guys picking and singing banjo and guitar in robust, salty renditions of golden oldies from the Antebellum and pre-bluegrass eras, as well as the cowboy-western and white gospel traditions... There's no information at all about who played on this record or when it came out, just the picture on the front (an anonymous group portrait from the 19th Century) and the song titles on the disc -- other than that, it's literally a blank slate. A little diligent research, though, and one discovers that this was the recording debut of guitarist Orville Johnson, who at the time was working on a tourist paddlewheel steamship, the SS Julia Belle Swain, and was an up-and-coming artist in the St. Louis music scene. I still dunno who was playing with him, but when I find out, I'll let you know. It's a nice record: thanks in advance if anyone has any additional info to add!\n\nThe Country Lads \"The Country Lads At Music Mountain\" (Music Mountain Productions/Sound 16 Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by W. A Madsen & Ron E. Riley)\n\nA souvenir album of an early 1970s country quartet playing gigs around Jefferson City, Missouri, possibly at a venue called Music Mountain, though that part's a little unclear. The band itself is of interest to \"private press\" fans, as their seventeen-year old drummer was Mike Schrimpf, a guy who later set up shop as a record producer and engineer who worked on countless custom pressings (including any written about here...) including some work in Nashville and environs. The band was led by lead singer and guitarist and Ron Mahan, along with Ralph Mueller on fiddle and bass, and steel player Don Riley, who might have later formed his own band down in Texas. Though the liner notes definitely place these guys playing in Jeff City, the Music Mountain thread is harder to pin down -- it may have been the name of the studio (in Kentucky!) where they recorded this album, though there is also a Music Mountain venue near Hot Springs, Arkansas, and it's vaguely possible they might have had a gig down there at the time. No date on this disc, though it had to have been early, early 'Seventies or possibly late, late 'Sixties. The younger fellas look pretty clean-cut, though with a slight trace of counterculture creeping in around the edges -- the hit song covers are older stuff, tunes like \"City Lights\" and \"Release Me,\" though overall this album features some pretty obscure material, including a slew of originals. There are two songs written by Mr. Mahan, and a couple others credited to J. Abernathy, who could have been Ab Abernathy, a guy who cut an album of his own several years later... (This is pure speculation on my part, though.) Anyway, nice snapshot of a local Midwestern band that had a few little ripple effects in years to come.\n\nThe Country Shindig Gang - see artist discography\n\nThe Crazy Horse Band \"Jus' Horsin' Round With The Crazy Horse Band\" (19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Blasingame & Rich Brown)\n\nA good-timin' alt-honkytonk band from Sullivan, Missouri, a rural town about twenty miles west of Saint Louis. The group included fiddler Gene Bouse, Greg Klousek on lead guitar, Jeannine Leeker (keyboards), Dale McCanless (lead vocals), Glenn Richards (saxophone), Len Slankard (bass), Jerry Thurmond (lead guitar and pedal steel) and Mark Wooley on drums... They were mostly St. Louis locals, though Gene Bouse apparently had previously been working in a band from Indianapolis called Nashville Sounds, who were the original backing band for top forty hopeful Tom Grant. There's an obvious affinity for Charlie Daniels at play, both with the prominence of the fiddle, and with Dale McCanless's chunky, old-man vocals, which sometimes drift into pretty questionable territory. (Jeannine Leeker, by contrast, was a pretty solid 'Seventies countrypolitan gal, sort of a slightly rootsier version of Crystal Gayle...) I'm not sure when this album came out, but early 'Eighties is my best guess, maybe around 1981-82.\n\nThe Dick Crockett Band \"Just For You\" (D. C. Productions, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dick Crockett)\n\nOzark locals from Eldon, Missouri... This looks like more of a western swing thing, with a horn section led by trombonist/arranger Ron Anson, and additional vocals from singer Carolyn Smart. The band covers songs by Bob Wills, Hank Williams and others\n\nAl Crossland/Various Artists \"Al Crossland's Table Rock Opry: Country Music Ozarks Style\" (Dungeon Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\nAnother family band from some micro-opry located in Kimberling City, Missouri, near the Silver Dollar City/Branson, Missouri musical axis. This troupe was led by Al Crossland and his wife Linda, along with their teenage daughters Kim and Tammy, with six-year old \"Little Lee\" Crossland adding a little bit of comedic relief onstage. Kim Crossland sang and played bass; the house band also included Everett Glenn on harp, drummer Harley Israel, pedal steel player Jack Musgrave and Steve Plank on fiddle, as well as cornpone comedy from Warren \"Jughead\" Wade, who also sang gospel numbers. There's no date on the album, but judging from the girl's lightly feathered hair, I'd guess somewhere around 1976-77.\n\nJimmy Dallas \"Jimmy Dallas\" (Kansa Records, 1978) (LP)\n\nA pretty solid set by a Midwestern honkytonker whose career stretched back a few decades. Back in the early 1950s Jimmy Dallas (1927-2004) recorded for the legendary Westport Records label, based in Kansas City, and notably cut a few duets with KC cowgal Cathy Justice. He later worked as a radio deejay and hosted his own country music TV show on the city's KMBC, Channel-9, and also performed on a local mini-opry called The Cowtown Jubilee. This album seems to be a compilation of a string of singles he released in the 'Seventies, on indie labels such as Graceland, Lee Mac and Triune Records, tracks that came out over a five- or six-year period, and not surprisingly have slightly different feels. (Unfortunately, there's no information about the backing musicians, but there were probably a few different sets of session bands.) As a vocalist, Dallas fell inside a long tradition of fragile masculine figures, calling to mind Bill Anderson, John Conlee, and Lefty Frizzell. One of his best performances is on his cover of Bill Mack's \"Drinking Champagne,\" though perhaps of greater interest are some of the album's more \"flawed\" songs, including a couple of Jimmy Dallas originals that may be of interest to women's studies scholars interested in the depiction of the male psyche in country music: the protagonist of \"I'll Be A Better Man\" sullenly snaps back at a gal who tells him he's a bad lover by telling her he'd do better if she \"were a better woman,\" while good sex seems to quell the wanderlust of some typically self-centered dude in \"My Woman Loves The Leaving Out Of Me.\" There were some other singles from this era that got left off this album; a later CD best-of included some of those tunes, while dropping others that were on the vinyl version.\n\nJimmy Dallas \"The Best Of Me\" (Kansa Records, 1987-?) (LP)\n\nMonte Davidson \"Love Country\" (MCL Records, 1977-?)\n\nMonte Davidson & The Wild Bunch \"Wanted\" (AudioLoft, 197--?)\n\nAn \"outlaw\" band from Missouri, recording at the fabled AudioLoft custom label in Mack's Creek, MO. They do some oldies -- real oldies -- like \"Wabash Cannonball\" \"El Paso,\" and Will The Circle Be Unbroken,\" along with more modern, Waylon-esque material such as \"Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way\" and \"Just Call Us Outlaws,\" and even a version of Rodney Crowell's \"Ain't Livin' Long Like This.\" Monte Davidson was an Ozarks regular since the early 1960s, and led the house band at the Lodge Of The Four Seasons, in Lake Of The Ozarks, Missouri, basically in Branson territory. He also toured regionally, did Vegas, and eventually retired the band sometime in the 1980s. I'm not sure who else was in his band, although the steel and lead guitar was by a guy named Charlie Hill... Fans of Waylon Jennings and/or Jerry Lee Lewis might like this one... fake-live audience \"cheering\" and all.\n\nMonte Davidson \"...Sings The Old Ones\" (BOC Records, 198--?)\n\nGene Davis \"My Kind Of World\" (Toppa Records, 1964) (LP)\n\nGuitarist-singer Gene Davis was a true stalwart of the Southern California county-rock scene, cutting singles back in the 1950s while appearing on local TV programs such as Cal Worthington's popular show, Cal's Corral. Originally from Saint Louis, Missouri, Davis is probably best known as the early-to-mid 1960s bandleader at North Hollywood's fabled Palomino nightclub, where hot country pickers and talented sidemen such as James Burton, Jerry Cole, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Jay Dee Maness, Johnny Meeks, Red Rhodes and many others cycled through the club's revolving door during the early heyday of LA's live rock scene. Davis's tenure at the Palomino came before the club shifted to a more rock-oriented focus, but there was certainly some crossover, as hear here.. This is a strong album, packed with rootsy, earthy material and plenty of originals, giving some sense of what the Palomino's nightly jam sessions must have been like, back in the day.\n\nGene Davis & The Star Routers \"All Together\" (Toppa Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gene Davis & Lee Carroll)\n\nAs detailed in the liner notes by LA country music deejay Larry Scott, Gene Davis branched out after his Palomino days, setting up shop in San Diego as owner of Gene's Lion's Gate restaurant, and also back home in Missouri as owner of a music venue called the Indian Foot Lake Resort, in Pevely, MO, just south of St. Louis. He was also heading the Star Routers as the house band at a San Diego club called the Alamo, just for good measure, and recorded this album there as well. Alas, the boys in the band, although pictured on the cover are not mentioned by name. Oh, well. But this album is notable for the wealth of original material: all but one of the songs are credited to Davis's own Jay-Gene publishing, and the remaining track, on Mixer Music, is probably original to this album as well.\n\nGene Davis \"Lovin' And Hurtin' \" (OL Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by James Burton & Randy Davis)\n\nHow or when Gene Davis got hooked up with Overton Lee's oddball, mega-DIY OL label, I have no idea... But I would hazard a guess that this is perhaps the best record they ever put out, particularly with the input from fabled superpicker James Burton, a longtime West Coast icon who anchored Elvis Presley's Vegas band and had more recently starred in the Emmylou Harris Hot Band. Also included are the Gentry Sisters backing vocalists... a lot of talent here!\n\nGene Davis \"Let's Coast Awhile\" (Hydra Records, 2010)\n\nDelisa Dawn \"Memories Of You\" (Stardom Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Chuck Bartlett & Frank Evans)\n\nNot sure when this one came out, but it seems to be an early 'Eighties kinda thing. Singer Delisa Dawn grew up in Independence, Missouri and started her performing career when she was just nine years old. She made her way to Nashville and wound up working for several older artists on tour, backing up falling stars such as Jack Greene, Faron Young and the Wilburn Brothers; she seems to have been in Jack Greene's band at the time this album came out. This was her first (and as far as I know, only) album, and may have been a Nashville songwriter's demo, produced by steel player Chuck Bartlett, who co-wrote the title track. Later she moved back to the Midwest, performing mainly in eastern Kansas and the Missouri Ozarks with with guitarist Dennis Cook in a group called Delisa Dawn & Route 66.\n\nDichotomy \"Muddy Waters Presents Dichotomy's Last Album\" (KBK/Earth City Sound Studios, 1985) (LP)\n\nA Saint Louis, Missouri bar band that was together from about 1970-85. They worked as the house band at a place called Burnham's St. Louis Opera, and then at the Muddy Waters bar up until the club closed in 1985. This commemorative set includes covers of country songs like \"East Bound And Down,\" \"Red Neck Mother\" and \"The Gambler\".\n\nDichotomy \"Just Here To Make Friends\" (OMR Records, 1987-?) (LP)\n\nAccording to the liner notes, this was their second album... Includes a cover of \"Up Against The Wall, Redneck Mother,\" in case anyone's keeping track...\n\nDeke Dickerson - see artist profile\n\nThe Dillards - see artist profile\n\nZig Dillon \"Something Old, Something New\" (Ripcord Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\nIn his heyday, midwestern honkytonker Allan \"Zig\" Dillon worked with national headliners such as Ernest Tubb, Porter Wagoner and Red Foley, although as a solo artist his main stomping ground was Kansas City, where he recorded a string of rockabilly-tinged singles in the early 1960s for the ultra-obscuro R Records label. This album comes from much later in his career, probably in the mid-to late-1970s. About half the songs are originals - including \"There'll Be No Color Line In Heaven\"; some of his earlier recordings have been anthologized on rockabilly and hillbilly bop collections, notably on Redita Records' fab KANSAS CITY COUNTRY ROCKERS collection.\n\nSlim Dortch \"Below The Dixie Line\" (Kennett Sound/Lightning Ball Records, 1993-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Keene)\n\nA Tennessee native who started playing guitar when he was twelve, Henry Pierce \"Slim\" Dortch (1921-2000) moved across the nation chasing various radio gigs, such as the \"Breakfast Time Frolic,\" on WJJD, Chicago, or the \"Saddle Mountain Roundup\" in far-distant Dallas, where he played with musicians such as Fiddlin' Arthur Smith and singer Ray Whitley. He's best known among rockabilly enthusiasts for his 'Sixties sizzler, \"Big Boy Rock,\" which has a driving hillbilly soul-beat sound, perhaps not surprising for an uber-indie Memphis single, back in 1964. There is some really wicked twang-bar guitar on that platter, but even more impressive is the vigor with which the forty-plus years old Dortch really grinds into some sweaty, bluesy 'billy vocals. Anyway, this album came out years later and was recorded in Mack's Creek, Missouri with a small local band that included James Prince on lead guitar and steel, Lee Barnes on bass, Jeff Bost on drums, and Dortch singing ten of his own original songs. Mr. Dortch eventually settled down in Poplar Bluff, MO, where he passed away at age 78.\n\nDown Yonder Band \"Where's Adrian, Missouri?\" (Tuff-Stuff Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nI'm gonna make a couple of guesses here... One, this isn't the same band as the group \"Down Yonder\" out in California, and two, they probably played at one of the many Branson-esque venues that populated Missouri back in the '70s and and early '80s. It might take me a while to track down the particulars on this one, though... And by the way? Adrian -- population tiny -- is located in Bates County, on the very Western end of the state, just south of KC.\n\nDave Drennon \"Live Dave Drennon Show\" (American Artists, 1971-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Higgins)\n\nA veteran of the Branson, Missouri \"opry\" scene, bandleader Dave Drennon was the first country artist to record for the Springfield-based American Artists label, which documented many of the Ozarks-area regional musicians of the 1970s. He and and his wife Dee Drennon, split off from her family's Branson revue (The Presley Mountain Music Jamboree) and started their own venue in the early 1970s, the Crossroads Auditorium in Nixa, Missouri, near Springfield. A few years later, in 1975 they pulled up stakes again and moved to the Saint Louis suburb of Eureka, where they opened a 900-seat venue called the Pine Mountain Jamboree. The Drennons ran Pine Mountain as a family business for over thirty years, eventually selling it to a fellow Bransonite, Mike Bishop, in 2006. This bluegrass-flavored album is a souvenir of their first, more short-lived venture, with a photo of the club and Drennon's tour bus parked outside. Alas, the musicians pictured on the front cover are not identified on the back, though a few of the musicians may have been piano player Joe Griffin, Kathy Kiehl, Jerry Mcnown and fiddler Don Wright. Whoever they were, they were pretty good: the banjo and lead guitar pickers were pretty flashy, and the fiddler was no slouch, either. The set list is pretty conservative -- mostly chestnuts like \"Cripple Creek,\" \"Orange Blossom Special,\" \"Rocky Top\" and \"White Lightning,\" with a couple of bluesier numbers (\"Going Down The Road Feeling Bad\" and \"It Takes A Worried Mind\") that are a little unusual for the little-opry scene. The only semi-contemporary tunes are versions of Dolly Parton's \"Daddy Was An Old Time Preacher Man\" and Joe South's \"Games People Play,\" which both originally came out in 1970 so this album may have come out around '71 or '72. (Side note: judging from the photo montage on the front cover, they seem to have done a parody of the Porter Wagoner-Dolly Parton show as part of their act... bet that was a real hoot.)\n\nDave Drennon \"...Sings The Words Of Lon Hogan\" (American Artists Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\nA set of patriotic, gospel, and regional pride songs written by Lon Hogan, an old-timer from the southern end of Missouri who was in Drennon's orbit. Alonzo Vannis Hogan (1883-1981) was born in Willow Springs, Missouri, and spent his life in the heart of the Ozarks, watching the intensely rural landscape change over time. He may be best remembered as a photographer: in his youth, Hogan worked for a large local lumber company and took countless photos of the lumberyard and other local sights; later in life he opened a photography studio and met and documented numerous local residents. In the late 1970s, Mr. Hogan had earned the title of the oldest resident of Shannon County, Missouri, and was interviewed on film about his life and the changes he saw -- these interviews were preserved by the state historical society, and have also been posted on YouTube and elsewhere. His work as a songwriter is less well-known, and it's interesting that a musician such as Dave Drennon, who had commercial aspirations decided to record an album of material by such an obscure local figure. The songs include \"Old Missouri,\" \"We Americans,\" and \"God Isn't Dead,\" as well as the more frivolous \"Doodle Bug Rag\" and the exotic \"My Hawaii.\"\n\nLee Dresser & The Krazy Kats \"Beat Out My Love\" (Fury Records)\n\nThis reissue label collection gathers over thirty tracks by Kansas City rocker Lee Dresser (1941-2014) and multi-instrumentalist who formed a high school band called the Krazy Kats in 1957 and scored a few regional hits before getting drafted and sent to Vietnam. When he came back to the States, Dresser headed for LA and fell into steady session work as a harmonica player, backing pop and country stars throughout the late '60s and '70s. The Krazy Kats got back together in 1980, and Dresser moved back to KCMO to play with them full-time a few years later, playing with the band up until he passed away from leukemia in 2014. This compilation mainly features his early stuff from the late 'Fifties and early 'Sixties -- lively, Jerry Lee Lewis-inspired (though sometimes kinda surfy) rockabilly, including unreleased demos and the band's best known song, \"Beat Out My Love,\" a mildly naughty song which is frequently anthologized on rockabilly reissues. There's also some stuff the Krazy Kats recorded after they got back together... It's not very innovative, but it sure is fun!\n\nLee Dresser \"El Camino Real\" (Amos Records, 1969) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jimmy Bowen)\n\nLee Dresser \"To Touch The Wind\" (Bella Linda Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Doug Gilmore & Doug Decker, Dennis Bachmann & Ivan Fisher)\n\nThis country-flavored album shows Dresser fully entrenched in the LA music scene, backed by an impressive studio made up of some of the elite pickers in the West Coast country-rock and bluegrass scenes, including Larry McNeely, Dan Crary, Glen D. Hardin, along with steel players Al Perkins and Red Rhodes. Dresser plays banjo, guitar and harmonica and wrote all but two of the songs -- the exceptions were the title track, \"To Touch The Wind\" and \"Wilderness Family,\" which were both apparently from a 1975 feature film called \"The Adventures Of The Wilderness Family.\"\n\nLee Dresser \"The Hero\" (Air International Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Mark Sherrill)\n\nThis later album was recorded in Nashville with session players such as Hargus Robbins and Bobby Thompson, as well as several less well-known players\n\nBill Dudley \"Nashville Moves North\" (Paragon Records, 1968-?) (LP)\n\nAlthough he was born in Missouri, honkytonker Bill Dudley only hung around Nashville for a few years before sensing that he might have more opportunities up North in Canada. Earlier, Dudley had cut some singles for Capitol Records, but he had to hoof it up to Toronto to get out a full album. This is packed with low-tech twang -- simple arrangements that match his plainspoken vocals. Authorship of most of the songs is credited to Dudley, but many are just thinly-disguised ripoffs of better-known Nashville hits (such as \"Poor Poor Me,\" which is a shameless lift of Don Gibson's \"Lonesome Me\") while several others, like \"Oh Please Mr. Conductor\" and \"I'm Just Here To Get My Baby Out Of Jail\" are hillbilly chestnuts that Dudley didn't even try to gussy up into \"new\" versions. Like a lot of Canadian artists, he pulls out the regional pride card on the album's opener, \"My Nova Scotia Home\" (a Hank Snow oldie) while he also makes a brazenly direct appeal for radio airplay with \"Top Ten In Heaven,\" a recitation tune that's kind of like Tex Ritter's \"Hillbilly Heaven,\" except that instead of naming country musicians, he lists a bunch of country deejays -- by name -- in the lyrics of the song. Not very original, obviously, but a fun record nonetheless.\n\nBill Dudley \"...Sings The Life And Death Of Hank Williams\" (M. M & C Records, 1971-?) (LP)\n\nDon Elkins & The Missouri Poor Boys \"In My Style\" (Nugget Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nThis Midwestern combo had been around for a few years before cutting this album... Beginning in 1965, the group played on radio station KLPW, in Washington, Missouri and played shows in Owensville and other nearby towns such as Rolla and Union, Missouri, in the stretch between St. Louis and Springfield. They were regulars on the Charlotte Peters TV show in Saint Louis and also played at the Cannon Dam Opry, a musical variety venue further to the north that was still in operation well into the 21st Century. The lineup for this album included Jim Day playing rhythm guitar, Wayne Lee (lead guitar), Roy Ritchie (drums), Jim Scott (steel guitar), Bob Vickers on bass, though apparently there was a fair amount of change in the lineup over the years. The fellas travelled to Nashville to record this LP, having cut a few singles a few years earlier... I'm not sure if this is the same Donnie Elkins (below) who recorded an album in the late 'Seventies, though that disc was on an Ohio-based label, so maybe not.\n\nDonnie Elkins \"New Sides Of Country\" (Artist's Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Junior Bennett & Donnie Elkins)\n\nA youngish-looking middle-aged guy with a deep, resonant voice, Donnie Elkins was a likeable though flawed performer... the flaw being mostly in his phrasing, which tends to be a bit rushed. He plows through the melody and drags the band along with him, so most everything is taken at a gallop. That's probably okay, though, 'cause when he slows things down, he really goes over the top with his crooning: \"You're The Best Thing\" is an incredibly cheesy, over-performed number that stands in sharp contrast to the country covers that lead up to it... Anyway, this disc is mostly real-deal twang, albeit with a few Nashville-style sweeteners. Plenty of thumping drums, loping bass and twangy fiddle, guitar and steel, and a good selection of tunes (a few of which might be originals, though sadly there are no composer credits...) The backing band includes Junior Bennett playing fiddle, Vic Clay on lead guitar, Joe Adams on steel, Chris Lee playing piano, Kenny Bobinger on drums and Dennis Whitaker on bass. I'm not sure if he's the same Don Elkins who led the Missouri Poor Boys (above) though it seems fairly likely. Anyway, this one's worth checking out, if you're into regional twang.\n\nHarland Ellis \"Songs Ole Harland Sings\" (Custom Cavern, 197--?) (LP)\n\nDunno anything about this guy - this is a very generic-looking album from one of the many \"custom\" labels in the Ozarks area... The Cavern label was a regional powerhouse in the Kansas City area, though I'm not sure where Mr. Ellis was from himself. If I find anything else out about this one, I'll let you know.\n\nPete Estes \"Dealer's Choice\" (BOC Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Myron Smith & Pete Estes)\n\nAn exceptionally good indiebilly album from a top-flight band... This one's on a par with many \"classics\" of the genre, from folks such as Alvin Crowe, Deadly Earnest, or Cornell Hurd. And that's high praise, in my book. Estes was a bar-band singer from Chillicothe, Missouri, singing a mix of original songs and covers, including stuff by the likes of Rodney Crowell and Lefty Frizzell. He mixed jovial country-twang with discreet amounts of boogie rock and blues, tapping into a rock vibe without getting all clunky about it. Best of all, all the guys in the band were on top of their game and kept a nice, good-time vibe rolling throughout. Estes kind of reminds me of Gary P. Nunn as a singer -- he didn't have a great voice, but the voice he had, he used just right... If you get a chance to check this one out, definitely go for it.\n\nThe Etcetera String Band \"The Harvest Hop\" (Moon Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dennis Pash)\n\nI'm running a little far afield on this one, but I just can't resist a good, twangy band from Kansas. This Kansas City, Kansas trio specialized in pre-jazz, pre-country old-timey music, rags and cakewalk instrumentals, with particular emphasis here on composers from Kansas and Missouri, which is what makes this album particularly unique. A handsomely illustrated and copiously researched insert details the careers of regional turn-of-the-century composers such as E. Harry Kelly, Ed Kuhn, Charles L. Johnson and Charles A. Gish who clustered together in Northwestern Missouri, performing together in marching bands and other venues, and whose work complimented that of the better-known Scott Joplin, who hailed from nearby Sedalia, and whose ragtime tunes defined the popular music of the era. Like their obscure idols, the fellas in the Etcetera String Band stuck close to come, playing local gigs mostly in and around Kansas City. This first album is largely defined by the mandolin work of Dennis Pash, with firm but humble accompaniment by guitarist Kevin Sanders and fiddling by Pat Ireland that often seems obscured in the mix. There's not a lot of stylistic or sonic variety to this album, but it is compelling and immersive nonetheless. Highly recommended, particularly for fans of retro-ologists such as Steve Grossman or Bob Brozman.\n\nThe Etcetera String Band \"Bonne Humeur\" (1990-?) (LP)\n\nYears later, the group explored Caribbean and Latin themes, resulting in this album. Eventually, Dennis Pash moved to San Francisco and formed a new group, the prolific Ragtime Skedaddlers, and the remaining bandmembers -- who now included art therapist Bob Ault, and a musical multi-instrumentalist in his own right -- formed a new old-timey/ragtime trio called The Rhythmia.\n\nDick Feller - see artist discography\n\nElaine Fender & Missouri Rain \"Come On Home\" (History Records, 1981-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Brad Edwards)\n\nA singer and keyboardist, Elaine Fender played in a series of local Missouri bands, including a stint in Stan Hitchcock's short-lived opry, and later collaborations with other veterans of the Hitchcock show, notably multi-instrumentalist Larry Smith, who she later married. This solo album was made with bandleader Eddie Pangborn, who also worked in a variety of Ozark \"opry\" venues and formed his own band, Missouri Rain, in the mid-1970s. The group made two albums of its own before teaming up with Fender for this last hurrah, with Elaine Fender on keyboards and lead vocals, drummer Jerry Dooley, Jerry Ingle (also on drums), Eddie Pangborn (bass), and multi-instrumentalist Larry Smith on banjo, fiddle, guitar and mandolin. This album is self-consciously commercially-oriented, with Fender showing her vocal chops on covers of contemporary pop/country hits, and the boys in the band trying to craft rural power ballads. It's an uneven effort, though, as the male lead vocals (and the original songs) are a bit strained. Still, it's local as all get-out and fills in a few gaps in the Ozarks indie-twang scene. Ms. Fender also recorded with the group Jimmy Carter & Dallas County Green, on their 1977 album, Summer Brings The Sunshine, and on Stan Hitchcock's 1979 opry album, along with Larry Smith and others.\n\nFestival \"Just Another Band From Skidmore\" (Max Stout Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Neal Rieffanaugh & Bill Schnee)\n\nDefinitely not your average, garden-variety southern rock band. This group was from Skidmore, Missouri, a microscopic hamlet in northeastern Missouri, halfway between Kansas City and Omaha. The band was the center of a large commune, originally based on a 300-acre farm outside of town, locally known as \"the Farm.\" Festival was led by songwriter Britt Small, an Army veteran who served as a paratrooper in Vietnam, and spent much of the war fantasizing about starting his own rock band. His dream came true in 1971 when Festival was formed, drawing on several late 'Sixties rock groups from Northwest Missouri State University, in nearby Marysville. It was, oddly enough, the push to make the band successful that led to the formation of the commune, which gave the \"family\" members a sense of cohesion, as well as a place to perform. Self-professed socialists, the communards raised animals and crops, and also decked the band out in shiny, glammy outfits worthy of Jethro Tull or Wizzard, and sent them on the road. Beginning in 1975, the group released numerous singles and LPs, including this one which is perhaps the most country-oriented of the lot, ending with a medley of oldies by the cowboy band, Sons Of The Pioneers. The group included Mr. Small on lead vocals, Stan Funston (guitar) Becky Reinig (keyboards), Mark Reinig (drums), arranger Don Struve on trumpet, and various and sundry others. Although they were mostly rockers, Festival considered themselves distinctly a rural band, and referred to themselves as \"the worldâs funkiest cowboy band.\" They toured throughout the United States and Canada, though in the early 1980s the tone of the group shifted from a party vibe to a more conservative political perspective, as Britt Small became consumed by POW-MIA issues, and the band's repertoire became almost entirely patriotic music. The commune and the band began to fray in the 1990s, and broke up entirely in the early '00s. [Many thanks to David M. Struve for his amazingly detailed history thesis, which provides extremely granular detail of the Farm, and of his dad's band.]\n\nJan Files \"What More Can I Say\" (1977-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Mike Schrimpf, Jerry Shook & Colin Walker)\n\nCrowned as Miss Jefferson City in 1975, Missouri teenager Jan Files made a serious bid to crack into Nashville -- or maybe move out to LA? -- traveling to Nashville to cut this shiny, well-produced countrypolitan/AOR album right after graduating from high school. It's a pretty impressive set, even if the songs and arrangements get to be a bit much... Ms. Files evokes comparison to '70s sirens such as Olivia Newton-John and Karen Carpenter (and even Loretta Haggers, on the twangier tunes) and the musical backing is pretty solid, smoothly shifting from disco-tinged pop to generic pop-country. She's backed by the house band at Mike Schrimpf's independent studio, which at the time still included future star Steve Wariner, who plays bass, acoustic and electric guitars, and sings backup. There's also an early song of his on here, \"Will You Still Love Me In The Morning,\" a hookup ballad that's not to be confused with Carole King's similarly-titled girl-group hit... Wariner was already under contract to RCA Records at the time, though hadn't yet released his own first single, and as far as I know, never released this song under his own name. Anyway, this slick-sounding custom pressed album really coulda-shoulda-woulda made Jan Files a star, if the planets had lined up the right way... As it was, I think it mostly made the rounds at county fairs and Christmas parties, though fans of 'Seventies soft-pop (and Steve Wariner devotees) might enjoy tracking it down.\n\nThe Foggy River Boys \"Songs To Remember\" (International Artists, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Higgins)\n\nA gospel quartet from Carthage, Missouri who recorded an album with one side of secular music -- Dallas Frazier's \"There Goes My Everything,\" \"Skip A Rope\" and \"Cool Water\" from the Sons Of The Pioneers alongside pop oldies such as \"Glow Worm.\" Side Two is straight gospel oldies... all standards in that department.\n\nThe Foggy River Boys \"Ozark Mountain Jubilee\" (International Artists, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by David Dombrowski & Winnie Swaim)\n\nA mostly-secular set by a later edition of the band, who by this time had their own private theater in the Branson, Missouri ecosystem. This lineup featured the main vocal quartet of Bob Hubbard, Denzel Koontz, John Shepherd and Dale Sullens, backed by Bobby Hill on drums, Mike McCallister (guitar), Bob Moskop (piano) and Rick Taylor on bass. They deliver a heavy dose of chart-toppers by folks such as Alabama and The Oak Ridge Boys, with covers of \"Play Me Some Mountain Music\" and \"Ozark Mountain Jubilee,\" as well as a \"Dixie Trilogy\" medley and a version of \"Peace In The Valley,\" along with several other hits of the day. There's no date on the disc, but judging from the early 'Eighties repertoire, this seems to be from 1983 or possibly early '84.\n\nJoy Ford \"The First Of Joy Ford\" (Country International Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sherman Ford, Jr. & Fred Christie)\n\nThe young Ms. Ford was born in Alabama but raised near Poplar Bluffs, Missouri... Although there are some cover tunes on here -- \"Til The End Of The World,\" \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,\" \"Release Me\" -- most of the songs were written by various composers signed to the Rest A While Music Company... Folks like Don Canton, Eddie Fontaine, Janice Torre and Bee Walker who remain as mysterious today as they were back then, though presumably they were all Missouri locals. Sadly, there's no info on the musicians backing her, but this was certainly a very private/indie type of album.\n\nJoy Ford \"Keep On Truckin'... Keep On Lovin' \" (Country International Records, 1977) (LP)\n\nJoy Ford \"From The Heart Of Joy\" (Country International Records, 198--?) (LP)\n\nThe Forney Brothers \"The Forney Brothers\" (1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jerry Forney, Phil Forney & Ronnie Light)\n\nLed by guitarist Jerry Forney, this family band hailed from Hopkins, Missouri, a tiny town on the state's northeastern border with Iowa. Although Jerry Forney later focussed on blues music, his early career was in Nashville, where he landed a spot in Charlie Rich's band, straight out of high school. He was working in Nashville when he cut this country-flavored album with his brother Phil, backed by an elite crew of Music City session players (and possibly a few folks from home). Half the songs are Forney originals, including one song co-written with George Couts, and another original credited to \"Sonny and Lindsey,\" as well as a cover of Rusty Weir's \"Don't In Make You Wanna Dance,\" a Bob Wills tune, and a version of \"High Time You Quit Your Low Down Ways.\" These outlaw tunes foreshadowed Jerry Forney's eventual move to Austin, where he established himself in the Texas modern blues scene. The Forney Brothers band also recorded a single or two in the early '80s, including one where they backed a fellow Missourian named John Marriott Jr.\n\nJerry Foster \"Looking Back\" (Cinnamon Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny Morris & Lewis Willis)\n\nOne of Nashville's most prolific songwriters, Jerry Foster was born in Tallapoosa, Missouri, a tiny town just north of Memphis, and he made his way -- literally -- into the Songwriter's Hall Of Fame. His professional career started in the late 1950s, when he performed on a series of regional \"jamboree\" revues, including a TV show in Cape Girardeau, not far from Saint Louis. He met lyricist Bill Rice in the mid-1960s and formed a partnership that swept into Music City at the decade's end, placing hit after hit with stars such as Mickey Gilley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Charley Pride. A commercially dominant duo for most of the 'Seventies: they won ten awards at the 1972 CMA ceremony alone, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. Foster recorded albums of his own, including this gentle countrypolitan gem.\n\nKen Fowler & The Hurricane River Band \"Ken Fowler And The Hurricane River Band\" (Ozark Sound Studios, 1978) (LP)\n\nApparently singer Ken Fowler was from rural Republic, Missouri and played in local bars and high schools in and around Springfield, later landing a gig at Branson... This indie album came out nearly a decade before Fowler's big shot at fame. In 1986, he cracked into the Top 100 with a slick, very '80s-sounding single, \"You're A Heartache To Follow,\" which hit #96 on the Country charts, but wasn't enough to propel him much further. Don't know much else about him, though... Hurricane River is actually up in Michigan, so I'm not sure what the connection was...\n\nFragile \"Fragile\" (Renee Records, 1976-?) (LP)\n\nAn eclectic offering from a multi-directional band from the heartland... The poorly-named Fragile hailed from Kansas City, Missouri though they headed up to eastern Nebraska to record this album at the uber-indie Renee Records. The group seem to have been part of a stable of for-hire cover bands managed by local promoter Ken Summers and like their contemporaries such as the band Patchwork, they covered a lot of musical ground, playing country stuff (Bobby Bare's \"Winners And Losers,\" \"Welcome To My World,\" \"The Auctioneer\") alongside pop oldies (\"Locomotion,\" \"Let It Be,\" \"Sunshine Of My Life\") and more contemporary Top Forty material such as \"Laughter In The Rain\" and \"Listen To The Music.\" Fragile was led by singer Terry Allen, with Niaomi Allen (his wife, I guess) as the female lead. The band was also notable for having an integrated lineup, including keyboard player Jim Carter, an African-American who stands out less for his skin color than for his lack of general dorkiness and scary 'Seventies hair. Maybe not the twangiest band on Renee Records, but still a good example of what working bands in the mid-'Seventies Midwest were like.\n\nMary Francis \"A Little Bit Country\" (Ozark Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Buddy Lane)\n\nNot a lot of info on this Missouri gal or who was backing her on this album... Though she proclaims herself a country artist, the material's a bit odd, including tunes such as her own \"TV Brainwash\" or \"Avenue Of My Mind,\" written by E. Goff, which were released together on the same 7\" single. (\"Fiddle Diddle Boogie\" sounds a little more promising for twangfans, perhaps...) Mostly a mystery disc.\n\nDwayne Friend - see artist discography\n\nJimmy Gateley \"Jimmy Gateley\" (Westwood, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Frank Evans, Dave Lindley & Billy Troy)\n\nBorn in Springfield, Missouri, Jimmy Gateley (1931-1985) was a successful Nashville songwriter who composed hits for Bill Anderson, Sonny James and Webb Pierce. He was in Anderson's band, the Po' Boys, for several years and recorded some singles under his own name for Chart Records, ABC-Dot, Decca and other labels, but never quite clicked as a solo artist, and later became a gospel artist. This album features all original material and was recorded on the independent Westwood label, which was briefly a home for a slew of older Nashville stars who had been left behind during Nashville's big shift in the 'Seventies. He's got a pretty solid crew backing him, including studio pros such as guitarist Greg Galbraith Sonny Garrish and Jim Baker playing pedal steel, and Buddy Cannon on bass.\n\nThe Glory Gang \"Nice Guys Finish First!\" (BOC Records, 1982-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by B.J. Carnahan & Gene Reasoner)\n\nA country-gospel featuring several members of the house band at BOC's Audioloft recording studios, as well as guys who were in various \"oprys\" in the orbit of Missouri's homegrown country scene. At the time, drummer Perry Edenburn and steel player Myron Smith were in Chuck Watkins' Ozark Jubilee show, while bassist Brad Edwards and pianist Gene Reasoner were working on numerous projects with Grandpa Jones and his wife Ramona; guitarist Stan Friend worked with several of these guys on this and other albums. The album is also noteworthy for the abundance of original material, written by Mills Caraway, Don Hulse and Steve Shotts, who are listed simply as \"performers,\" which probably meant they were singing their own songs with backing from the studio band.\n\nGene Goforth \"Strike Up The Bow\" (Professional Artist Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nAn old-timey/traditional fiddler from Shannon County, Missouri, Gene Goforth (1921-2002) worked as a heavy machinery operator in Saint Louis while also playing down-home music at the highest level. He toured with fellow Ozarkers such as Dub Crouch and Norman Ford, as well as nationally famous bluegrass auteur John Hartford, with whom he recorded an album in the 1990s. The Goforth family, including his father Josh and brother Cecil, was deeply enmeshed in the musical culture of the regions and had connections to bluegrass stars such as fiddler Kenny Baker and fellow Missourians, The Dillards. If you're looking for sincerity, authenticity and soul, this disc's for you.\n\nLarry Good \"Good N' Country\" (Pearce Records, 1969-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Pearson)\n\nOriginally from Kansas City, singer Larry Good (1932-2010) slowly gravitated towards Nebraska, where he recorded several albums for the local Renee Records label and was eventually inducted into that state's Country Music Hall of Fame. He also worked as a professional minor league baseball player, playing in the orbit of the Chicago Cubs farm teams, but devoted himself full-time to music after his athletic career petered out. In later years Good created his own label, Lari-Jon Records and started up a live music venue called The Nebraskland Opry. Although he also recorded some rockabilly singles in his youth, his was his first album, recorded for the fabled Kansas City-area Pearce label\n\nLarry Good & The Good Times \"Half-Alive At The Sahara\" (Rene Records, 197-?) (LP)\n\nThe liner notes tell us of Larry Good's erstwhile baseball career and his switch to music \"when his playing days were over.\" They also inform us that Good had been leading his own band for eight years by the time this album came out, though as with most releases on the Rene/Renee label, there's no date on the disc. It's a pretty compact band backing Larry Good here: drummer John Cline, bassist Jim Eaves and guitarist Tommy Dawn, who was apparently a country deejay from Omaha on his days off. (If there were any additional musicians provided by the label, they aren't mentioned on the jacket...) I'm not sure if this was actually a live album, but you can certainly see how this could be a strong set for a country lounge band back in the 'Seventies... It's all pretty safe material, and none of it original as far as I can tell, stuff like \"Okie From Muskogee,\" \"Sally Was A Good Old Girl,\" \"Proud Mary,\" \"White Lightning,\" a Johnny Cash medley, etc. The band is introduced by deejay Ralph Wayne, of station KTTT in Columbus, Nebraska.\n\nLarry Good & Dalton Fuller \"A Bit Of Country With A Touch Of Brass\" (Rene Records, 197-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bud Comte & Bill Palensky)\n\nWhen these two midwestern honkytonkers bumped into one another while cutting their respective albums at Bud Comte's studio in David City, Nebraska, someone came up with the idea of collaborating on a country-big band hybrid record. So a year later Dalton Fuller's band, the Nebraska Playboys hooked up with several regional jazz players -- Marty Grubbs on clarinet and saxophone, Bill Palensky (trumpet), Jack Seckman (trombone), Allen Valish (trombone), Brad Wesely (trumpet) and Dennis Wesely on piano -- crafting brassy renditions of western swing and country oldies. This album also seems to have been the inspiration for his long-running regional TV show, \"Country With A Touch Of Brass,\" which ran for several years in the Nebraska market.\n\nLarry Good \"...And Some Damn Good Friends\" (Renee Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bud Comte & Eric Kucera)\n\nI'm afraid I'm coming at Larry Good's career a little backwards, starting out with this later album and the Dalton Fuller collaboration above, which may not be his strongest efforts. Although his true-country bona fides aren't in question -- great song selection, outside of Bobby Bare's \"Marie LeVeau\" -- but he certainly sounds a bit depleted on many of these tracks. There are obvious echoes of Johnny Paycheck, and by implication, Merle Haggard, and while Good's rugged, old-guy vocals ooze authenticity, if we're being honest, he sounds a little too rough around the edges. The band's okay, not great, but okay, with contributions from album co-producer Tom Campbell (on fiddle and lead guitar), someone simply identified as \"Jackie\" on steel guitar, Henry Guererro (drums), Gina Kavanaugh (piano), Mick Kovar (bass), Don Muzney (banjo, fiddle and guitar), and Bob Pasenault on drums. Along with a slew of well-chosen covers, the set includes three Larry Good originals: \"As Long As You Need Me,\" \"Fast Moving Freight Train,\" and \"Money Troubles.\" This is certainly worth checking out, though I'm maybe a little more curious about his early stuff.\n\nLarry Good \"Movin' Country\" (Lari-Jon Records, 1979-?) (LP)\n\nThis indie album includes a bunch of original songs, including two by Midwestern honkytonker Larry Good, two more by Charlie Craig and a couple by old-timer Redd Stewart... This album came out on Good's own private label, Lari-Jon, which also released a few discs by other artists, including Kevin Cline, Bill Eagle and Kent Thompson. This may have been Larry Good's last album, though I'm not 100% sure about that... (Thanks to the KCLawrencevinyl blog for background info on this one...)\n\nKris Gordon \"New Songs And New Writers\" (CGM Productions, 19--?) (LP)\n\nA song-poem set from a custom label in Saint Louis, Missouri. Apparently this features singer Kris Gordon singing the lyrics of numerous unknown \"poets\" -- too numerous and too obscure to catalog right now. This album came with a plain white back cover and includes no recording info, nothing about the studio or producer, or the musicians involved. Also, no date, alas, though your guess is as good as mine. I would guess sometime in the mid-1970s, just from the look of it.\n\nThe Grand Poo-Bah Beaner Band \"It Must Be A Breakdown\" (Rising Star Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Chuck Chapman)\n\nBasically a decent \"progressive\" bluegrass band from the Kansas City area, with Byrds-y harmonies and a repertoire that spanned from traditional material to more rock-pop oriented stuff such as covers of Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"Friend Of The Devil\" by the Dead, and Gordon Lightfoot's \"Early Morning Rain.\" The vocals aren't great, but the picking was fine, particularly Jan Carlson's banjo, and some sweet mandolin riffs on their version of \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow,\" which is an album highlight. On their version of \"Cold Sailor,\" they give Kansas a little shout-out, which is cute. No original material on here, as far as I can tell, but some nice picking.\n\nThe Great White Possum String Company \"The Great White Possum String Company\" (Professional Artist Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Parvin Tramel)\n\nFormed at the start of 1976, this bluegrassy band took their name from an early, pioneer-days nickname for Kansas City... According to the liner notes, they met at a KCMO music shop called the Possum Trot Pickin' Parlor, which was defunct by the time this album came out, and played local festivals and fairs. Lead singer Don Hupp lived in nearby Olathe, Kansas, and the other members -- Gary Gray (banjo), Bill Norton (bass), Mark Pusell (lead guitar), and Tony Rodriguez (fiddle and mandolin) -- were from Kansas City and environs, augmented by fiddler Kirk Brandenberger, of Kirksville, Missouri, in the northern end of the state. As far as I know this was their only album, and has them trotting their way through a mix of bluegrass and stringband standards like \"Make Me A Pallet On Your Floor,\" contemporary bluegrass numbers from J. D. Crowe and Tony Rice, country standards and folk-rock tunes such as Gene Clark's \"Tried So Hard.\"\n\nThe Greene County Boys \"Medic Emetics\" (19--?) (LP)\n\nA truly oddball, and truly local offering here. This folk-parody set was produced by several (sadly unidentified) medical students in Springfield, Missouri, and sold as a fundraiser for scholarships to Greene County Medical School. Songs on this disc include gems such as \"At Your Cervix,\" \"The House Calls Song,\" \"Menopause,\" and \"Pentothal Is A Ball.\" Although the record came without cover art, a xeroxed insert informs us of two other albums in the series, Borborygmi and Placenta Review which added tunes like \"Black And Blue Cross,\" \"Tranquil-Eyes Her,\" \"Thanks For The Referral\" and \"It Must Be A Virus. Lots of songs about medical billing and financial bureaucracy -- also a bunch of tunes about flatulence and bad breath. Plus le change, and all that.\n\nHarold & The Chaparrals \"Live At The Teepee Lounge\" (Sambo Sounds Records, 197-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Del McKinnon)\n\nA bunch of real-deal good old boys from Central Missouri, Harold & The Chaparrals included Harold Tincher on piano and vocals, Bill Barnhart (drums), Stan Friend (steel guitar), Bobby Preston (lead guitar) and Dale Wallace on bass. All the guys except the steel player sing lead on a track or two, and one instrumental, \"Super-Del,\" is credited to the Chaparrals, and one track is credited to the Dallace Brothers, making me suspect most of the songs on this LP were originally released as singles, under various guy's names. They all seem to have been from the area just south of Lake Of The Ozarks, with a list of local sponsors that includes auto shops, supermarkets, pizza parlors from all around St. Robert, Missouri and the VFW organization of nearby Fort Leonard Wood, an Army engineering school in the middle of a state park. Biographical info is scarce, but it seems likely that at least some of the guys were also in the Army at the time... Harold Tincher apparently moved to Texas and worked at a sort of \"wild west\" style antique/thrift store village called The Mountain, in Canton, Texas. Had a booth of his own called Tincherville, and played music at least part of the time. Mr. Tincher also recorded at least a couple of singles, an older one on Lofton Records, and one from 1990 on a Texas label where he covered oldies by Lefty Frizzell and Marty Robbins. He passed away, down in Texas I think, though I'm not sure if I found his obituary info, or if it was someone else... Steel player Stan Friend passed away in 2009, at age 61.\n\nClint Harrison \"...Presents Songs & Satire\" (1965-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Pierre & Gary Siftar)\n\nClinton J. Harrison (1927-2012) was a California native who grew up in Southwestern Missouri, where he established himself as a regional performer, playing at Joplin, Missouri's Hidden Acres Supper Club during the 1960s and '70s, as well as regular gigs at some joint in nearby Tulsa, Oklahoma called The Camelot Inn. Harrison kicked off his career working casino lounges with the Bob White Trio, singing in Vegas after World War II. He also worked in Tucson, Arizona and in Bentonville, Arkansas, where he owned and sang at his own restaurant and nightclub. Although he started out as a pop/big band vocalist, very much under the spell of Frank Sinatra, by the time he made his own records, Mr. Harrison had also acquired a taste for country material. Apparently he was a one-man band as well, playing all the instruments on this live album himself. This is one of those high-concept, split-personality, Mister Versatility kinda records, with Side One all music, and Side Two a country comedy set, including a few tunes that had been monkeyed around with, ala Homer & Jethro. To be honest, it's a pretty terrible record; there's some slick, good guitar playing, but the piano and organ -- which he favors when he's in Tony Bennett mode -- sounds just as cloying as his vocals. The comedy bits are awful, as are his \"funny voices,\" and many of the jokes and blue humor do not hold up over the years (such as \"I got a request for 'Goldfinger' Goldfinger... that's a Jewish gynecologist\") His horrendous parody of \"Almost Persuaded\" is pretty over-the-top bad, so much so that if I was every to make a golden-voices style collection of the worst country records ever, I would definitely put it at the top of the list, though otherwise this album has very little to offer. It was recorded at The Camelot Inn, although copies of the record could be obtained through Harrison's home address in Joplin. Not sure when, exactly, this came out but if covers of mid- 'Sixties hits like \"Make The World Go Away\" and \"King Of The Road\" are any indication, probably not much later than late 1965, or '66. Several years later he reissued this album but apparently didn't want to pay for fancy graphics, so that edition -- which I prefer -- had minimal text on a plain white background.\n\nClint Harrison \"The Two Sides Of Clint Harrison\" (Mark Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Higgins)\n\nThis was his second album, once again with one side devoted to comedy, the other to music -- among the tracks are covers of Harlan Howard's \"Heartaches By The Number,\" \"Help Me Make It Through The Night,\" and Ray Stevens' early '70s hit, \"Everything Is Beautiful.\" He may have also cut a few singles, though this information is fairly sketchy...\n\nChuck Harter \"Keep Me In Mind, Keep Me In Love\" (Chaparral Records) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny Maggard)\n\nAlthough this early '80s album was recorded in Nashville, Harter seems to have been from the Kansas City area... Blue Springs, Missouri, to be exact, over by Lee's Summit. Harter hired a top-flight studio crew for these sessions, including Music City stalwarts such as Hoot Hester, D. J. Fontana, Hargus Robbins, Fred Newell and Doyle Grissom on steel guitar... But the sad fact is, Harter wasn't the world's greatest singer, and though he wrote all the songs on here (and many are quite good) they often fall flat due to his wobbly vocals and the sometimes indifferent accompaniment. Still, you can hear where he was headed with this, and on the twangier, less pop-oriented tracks (like \"How Fortunate Am I\" and \"Sonya\") he sounds pretty okay. Indeed, with attentive listening, this could turn into an inadvertent guilty-pleasure album, and it's certainly ripe for some stronger singer to mine for material. Harter mimics some great artists, notably George Jones and Gary Stewart, and those hopeful aspirations should give you an idea of where he was aiming on this one. Worth a spin, though you shouldn't get your hopes up too high. (By the way, thanks to the KC-Lawrence music blog for tipping me off to this one... I couldn't find the magic thrift store you mentioned on your blog, but I still appreciate the tips!)\n\nJohn Hartford -- see artist profile\n\nCarol Hascall \"Spotted Pony\" (Cavern Custom Recording, 1975) (LP)\n\nTraditional fiddling by a gal from Independence, Missouri, near Kansas City. According to the liner notes, Elizabeth Carolyn Hascall (1936-2019) grew up in Humansville -- which is a real place -- down in the southern end of the state, in the Ozarks. Her dad, Andy Beaty, was a well-regarded local fiddler, and she grew up to learn several instruments, and performed at numerous bluegrass festivals and old-timey events. Hascall cut this album for Cavern, a legendary regional label, with backing by a group called the Bluegrass Association: John Bennett on guitar, Jim McGreevy (banjo), Don Montgomery (bass), and Chuck Stearman on mandolin. She recorded elsewhere, including her participation in an authoritative 2-CD set dedicated to Missouri fiddling, Now That's A Good Time, and later in life, Ms. Hascall became interested in making fiddles, as well as playing them.\n\nDenny Hilton - see artist discography\n\nLouis Hobbs \"Louis Hobbs\" (Creative Country Records, 1975-?) (LP)\n\nMissouri's Lou Hobbs (1941-2007) was an early, first-generation rockabilly artist who played in Narvel Felts' band and wrote several songs with Felts, back in the day. Like many of his peers, Hobbs \"went country\" later in life, and placed a couple of songs in the Billboard charts in the early '80s. In "
