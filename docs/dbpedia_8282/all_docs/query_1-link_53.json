        "text": "Ben: Right, I started out by trying to find a tempo, which overlapped a bit with what we were doing in composing the song as an idea. The tempo was the hardest part for me because I was limited by repertoire! Meaning, I couldn't entirely play as fast or as smooth as I wanted. When I finally chose a tempo—138 beats per minute (BPM)—the speed was at the very limit of my ability to play. Actually, 136 BPMs felt good to me when I was originally setting the click, but my experience tells me that when recording, you almost always wish an uptempo song were just a little bit faster. Even so, I knew edging past 138 BPMs would be impossible for me to play the drums on because I was not skilled enough to play so fast. I considered playing it slower inside of ProTools, but I've never done that before, so I wasn't sure if it would work. And honestly, it just doesn't feel \"right\" to work that way. I don't mind fixing mistakes, but speeding up performances… I don't know.\n\nAfter setting the click, I then recorded a scratch guitar and a scratch vocal for you, Bill, to reference. \"Scratch\" means that the sound were placeholders for the real thing that would eventually be recorded. I do this when I'm composing other texts too. In a wireframe, for example, I'll put a box with an X through it. On a memo, I'll leave space for a heading. Even when writing an article, if I want to drop in a citation but don't know the detals, I'll put the person's name and write the word \"year\" or leave four X's in the year spot. In our work together, Bill, the scratch tracks were just a way for you to assemble a bass line and to hear the melody. They were a kind of way for you to work across the model in the ways you needed to… as a way to invent ideas. And then to practice them. And they also gave me a visual reference for your performance later on, particularly for how the ideas aligned and didn't align—not just in terms of time, but sonically.\n\nBill: Yeah, a lot of the choices you made come, at least from my point of view, from you sitting in the sweet spot in the center of our diagram—phronesis, this space of practical wisdom where you're exercising judgement—drawing on vocabulary, technique, and repertoire to pull many audio files together into a performance. Can you talk through one of the examples of that?\n\nBen: Definitely can provide an example. So, after setting the click, I began by recording somewhere around eight different takes of drums and then worked to create a single performance using all the best parts. This is how I make up for a lack of technique and repertoire in terms of my playing. I record a lot of stuff and then piece it together. It's like freewriting ideas and then later worrying about how to structure them and how they might fit together. My experience tells me that I may not be able to play what I imagine in terms of vocabulary, but that a bunch of repetitive attempts will help me assemble something close, or something I hadn't imagined or foreseen initially. It opens up the recording process to serendipity. I repeated this process for the bass and vocals too… each had somewhere between six to ten takes, but not the guitars. In the end, I kept the scratch guitars because they sounded gritty and sort of off, but in a good way, so that was something that happened that I didn't anticipate. That's the moment of serendipity. I did fix a few things on the guitars, but they are mostly the original takes (see image below). The goal for working this way was to provide options to make the idea of the song into a performance of the song that we would be happy to share with an audience. So, as a drummer I was working through constraints of my technique, but as someone who was composing the performance more like a producer would, I was thinking about genre and trying to balance each area of the model.\n\nBill: Ok, so right there, you are hearing and seeing details, right? You're using the visualizations in the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to see what options you have?\n\nBen: Yes, but when I started working with the drum tracks in the DAW there were a few issues with the drums in the song. I don't think I played the song all the way through without making quite a few mistakes. As I talked about in the previous section, my drumming abilities are somewhat limited, so I had to spend time imagining a sustainable, doable, and fixable technique, or drum pattern. In other words, I had to find a rhythm to suit the song and the genre—one that I could actually play well enough to piece together after the fact.\n\nThe piecing together process is mostly visual in ProTools. I can use the software to zoom in to the soundwave and find a place to bring two, three, or four different takes together (see Video 1 below). I'll move hits around or replace a snare hit that was wrong or remove a fill that was out of time. Doing that work requires careful listening, but it also includes seeing what you are listening to so you can make good decisions and make the right cuts. If you make the wrong ones your ears tell you, so I toggle back and forth. I work with the visual and then listen to what I made. It's a different kind of composing that's more akin to editing a text globally, and then seeing how it looks on the page. So, asking questions like: is this paragraph too long? Are the sentences too long or too short? Similar questions might occur in the design of something: is there too much scrolling? Too many images? It's a question about feel, or what we think about as the interplay between style, genre, and conventions. One other example that I tend to use is when I write an article or when I write an essay, I'll often have to print it on the page to see what it looks like. That seeing helps me make better decisions about what I'm writing. And if one area in our model has too much emphasis, like say style, then the drum pattern may sound interesting but it doesn't necessarily serve the song. If it is too genre-specific, the drum pattern may come across as generic. So, balancing these areas is really important… and visualizing the sound waves is a vehicle for keeping balance.\n\nYour browser does not support the HTML5 video element.\n\nBill: So, would you say that the way you could use the drums to write was more limiting than the way you can use the DAW to write in this case? I ask it that way because I'm kind of unsure myself… Using the drums to write, I mean, that's a pretty interesting idea. And, more importantly, perhaps for our model, what set of techniques do you feel were helping you make the idea of the song that you were trying to turn into a performance, more accurately reflected in the result? Were they the techniques of your drumming on the drum kit? Were they the techniques you were using in the editing process? Or some combination?\n\nBen: I would say it was a combination of both. I knew that the DAW would help me make the things I couldn't actually play sound like I actually played them. When you listen to the song \"For the 1979,\" for instance, it sounds like somebody played it from start to finish. I don't know that I ever successfully played it from start to finish. Now recognizing the ethical dimensions of editing music or writing in this way (I mean, imagine software that helps us write in a nonlinear fashion or helps us check for spelling and grammar—oh wait, Microsoft Word already does that!), ProTools, like any software, has quite a few tools to help us improve our performance by making it more even or more in time. It helps us recognize patterns or issues by visualizing sound or by showing us that if we moved all of the sound waves just a tick or two back that they would sound somehow a little bit more even and a little bit more in time (for a discussion of the ethical dimensions of editing sound that problematizes this approach, see Chambers, 2017). Now these tools are automated through algorithms, and they can't make a performance perfect, but used sparingly and effectively, they can help to make it better. But there is someone behind the DAW who is helping to make those decisions—somebody who's implementing the software, so you can't let the DAW think for you, you have to think with it, and that's where visualization becomes so important. The interesting element of (sound) editing tools is that they are mostly visual.\n\nBill: I'm really fascinated and I would guess that other people are too because this article—but also the community of readers for Kairos is composed of people itself who are interested in digital composing and the tools we use to do that work. So, could you talk more specifically just for a minute about what you literally see on the screen and interact with on the screen when you are working in ProTools and helps you do the composing work you just described for us?\n\nBen: Sure, the first way sound becomes visual is through the production of sound waves. So, when you start recording something, like the bass, you can see feedback right away. Bigger soundwaves means a stronger signal. Smaller soundwaves means you probably need to boost your signal, and the best way to make a great recording is to start with the signal. Whatever you record—trying to make it sound as good as possible. There are other ways to check levels that are visual too. We have monitors inside of ProTools that will tell you how loud something is. If it's in the green, it means everything is okay. If it goes to yellow, then that means that you are almost close to peaking. And if it goes to the red then you are peaking and that's bad. That means that the sound is too loud. Once sound is recorded, the soundwave is there to reference what was recorded. So visualization aids your listening, and helps make something auditory into a visual in ways that helps you, then, analyze sound with your eyes. You can see what you are hearing, which is sort of like when something tastes how it smells.\n\nThe sound wave seems to help me in a few ways. I can see modulation, for example. Changes in performance. Something goes from really loud to really quiet. We like to see performance be a little bit more even than that in rock music because we can control modulation in other ways. I can also see mistakes or changes in rhythm. The wave affords me the ability to then address any of these kinds of issues through things like normalizing volume, moving sounds around, or even automating volume, pan, etcetera in certain parts of the vocals or bass line, like I did in \"For the 1979.\"\n\nIf we look at the short video of me editing vocals, you can see some of what I'm mentioning above. In this short clip, you see me editing vocals and moving different performances together. I select a performance from one track and move it to another, what I term Final Vocals or VOX for short. What you see me doing is grabbing one phrase because I like the way I said that phrase and moving it up to the Final Vocal phrase. This is how I use visuals to cobble together a vocal performance. There were six takes, and then I did a few punches as I edited the sound because I didn't like the way I sang something—I wanted to change up the style to help keep the performance in balance a bit more. I tend to like vocals a bit more raw and imperfect, so I kept all the notes that were slightly out of tune.\n\nBill: Something that occurs to me that I'll make as a comment about what you were just speaking about related to waves is I think waves are a fundamental way we also experience sound. That is, sound physically is moving air, so a sound wave goes through you or hits up against you and that's how we register it in our ear drum and so literally, it's a performance, or it's an event anyway, so it makes sense when you turn to this moment of performance you have a very basic representation of what we are doing or what we have already done as a kind of experience and that's the sound wave. So as of now, at least count, which I think you updated last night, we have about 13 versions of the full song! And those are just the ones you've sent me. I suspect there are more. But, I think somewhere around the seventh version or something that I saw anyway, we started sharing it with a few friends and family—just people that were near our laptop at the time or something. Anyway, what I want to ask is what that looks like to you now as something to work with and further revise? So, what shape is this song as a performance and song as an idea—bringing those two together—in right now for you? When I see it, and, you know, if we played it for someone else or if sent it to someone else it'd be one little file on their computer probably. And I listen to it and go, \"Okay, he changed that, now I have to repeat that part three times,\" so I'm listening to it to practice a future performance, in a way. But, you're still seeing something different when you look at the song. It's kind of, for you, a big visual stack now, a full arrangement with many tracks, sound levels, effects… what does that view help you do from here to help you shape future performance?\n\nBen:That's a really good question. I think I've done the best I could with mixing and mastering… in other words in composing a performance or a series of performances that make one performance given the quality of the sound. Part of what I did is I spent some time in mixing thinking about, \"How can I make all this sound better?\" There were certainly moments where both of us didn't perform the best, probably to our abilities, even though, you know, I still think that everything was really well done. One of the things that happens to me ultimately is I have some interval rest, as we've called it, I have some moments where I recover—let my ears recover and let my brain recover—and I go back to the recording and I think to myself, \"Oh that could be better\" or \"This could be better\" or \"I hear something I didn't hear before,\" so it always sort of starts with me listening, right? And imagining, as Steph Ceraso (2014, 2018) and others tell us to think about how our listening is felt in the body—that listening is an embodied practice. And so, as I start with listening, I immediately go, \"Hmm, I don't like the way that makes my body feel.\" Like, that note sounds harsh in my ear. That makes me cringe a little bit. And well then, I think, \"Well, let me fix that one thing,\" and then I fix that and it leads to fixing something else, kind of like trying to remodel an older home.\n\nOne of my learning goals for this project was to spend some time thinking about how to improve my mixes and my masters of music in particular because this is something that I just really enjoy doing and is something that informs all the work that I do in one way or another. And then I'll read about some new trick or I'll go to YouTube and I'll watch somebody do some interesting mixing or mastering thing and then I'll want to try it and then I come back to our song and I try it. I've done this many, many times throughout this project.\n\nFor me, I see this model as something that helps remind me of the balance across considerations—of the elements—of vocabulary, technique, and repertoire. This reminds me that when I'm working on, say, stylizing backup vocals, that I don't take any one specific direction too far. That balance across these areas is really important. That style and convention… that I have to think about, \"How can I balance across these areas?\" And that's where I really find that practical wisdom or phronesis being sort of central to my future praxis is that I spend some time thinking about balance and keeping things in balance is part of my composing practice. Unless the point, of course, is to be out of balance in a particular way. And in \"For the 1979\" that was sometimes true. The point was for the song to be kind of garage-bandy. It wasn't meant to sound perfect, like it was done in a ten thousand dollar a day studio (if those even exist anymore), but it was also, sort of, meant to sound like we knew what we were doing even though, you know, it's supposed to be imperfect in places. That's kind of what '90s rock was about.\n\nI can't make up for poor technique, I've learned that, but I can think about keeping poor technique in a balance with vocabulary and repertoire, and this project, most importantly in all my composing projects, I see that there is an opportunity for me to gain more experience from repetitive practice—and I think the more I try something and take an interval rest and then try it again and take more interval rest, and that interval rest might include things like not thinking about the thing that I'm doing, that that actually leads to better outcomes and more balance, and I make better decisions about what it is that I'm composing.\n\nThis model demonstrates that for me. And after this thirteenth mix—really probably the twenty-fifth mix and master of the song, I think I finally have something that is better than the first mix and master, even though if you ask me tomorrow, I'll probably disagree with that.\n\n[\"For the 1979\" fades in]\n\nBen: Here's where Bill and I end our discussion of composing a performance of the song \"For the 1979.\" We invite you to listen to our reflections about this project and making the song \"For the 1979\" in our learning model in the next section of the webtext.\n\n[\"For the 1979\" fades out]\n\nBill: I found it interesting that you saw my inventional work for the article—creating a kind of heuristic as a frame for invention of the core theoretical contributions of the article—as a new way of working for you. Could you say more about that and describe how it asked you to practice differently, like did it help you build repertoire? New technique? Extend your vocabulary?\n\nBen: One of the ways I found the model new for me is that, like many practitioners, I never stopped to really think about my process. I just worked. What the model invited me to do was spend more time trying to explain what my work looks like at the level of practice. So, for example, after writing the verse and the chorus, I spent some time generally thinking about the arrangement of the song. This is where I drew from my repertoire of knowledge about pop songs in general, which tend to average around 3 minutes in length. My first attempt was a bit longer at 4 minutes, but by playing with the arrangement a bit, I was able to cut the first 30 seconds and then later another 30 seconds because I sped the track up from around 118 beats per minute (bpms) to 136 bpms. This was also partially because I began thinking about my technique, that is, how was I going to actually play the song? I knew it was a pop rock song, but I was thinking about pop like R.E.M. and Pixies used to do it, and some more recent stuff like OK GO, The Kooks, and The Fratellis… which all seemed to have more of a new wave indie rock feel rather than an alternative rock feel, and so that was a conscious decision to speed up the song to sound poppier. I was then thinking both about genre and style too, as I wrote the song a half step low on an acoustic and then tuned it to standard and sped it up again on the electric. This last part, about the tuning, was more or less about my vocabulary, because I recognized, once I had the song sussed out, that I had to explain it to you, Bill, because you were going to play on it too.\n\n[Bill laughs]\n\nBen: So, I have my own vocabulary for thinking about songs when I'm writing, and it isn't rooted in words necessarily—more like shapes, sizes, colors, and emotions—but I realized that I'd have to find a way to explain those shapes and colors to you. In all my previous experiences, that worked by breaking the song down to parts like A, B, C and saying how many times to do each part.\n\nAll this to say, I've never actually thought about my songwriting practices so concretely. I just do them. I just make something where the shapes, sizes, colors, and emotions seem to fit together. I let my ear and intuition lead. The model showed me that I have processes that are more practical than I actually thought they were. It also showed me that space is an important part of my practice. We chatted about this over text the other day as we were writing.\n\nI feel like we need a term for taking a break as part of invention—to create enough distance that something becomes new again. You call it a time to recover, and note it is where growth occurs. The term we settled on, interval rest, seems to relate to Casey Boyle's (2016) idea of \"serial practice\" where growth or improvement is not necessarily linear.\n\nHow do you see interval rest connecting to the model you developed? Did you try taking time away? What did that time do to your understanding of the song and your ability to write a bass line?\n\nBill: I take the idea of a rest interval very literally and it comes from my experience with athletic training where you come to understand that a workout is a way to apply adaptive stress to your body. You are trying to subject yourself to something that your body is so unprepared for that it will change to be better prepared the next time.\n\nWhen you see things this way, you also understand that you don't get better during the workout, you just suffer.\n\n[Ben laughs]\n\nBill: You get better when you recover from it. And that takes time. And… as you get older, it takes longer too!\n\nSo, you can teach an old dog new tricks. It just takes a lot more time for the old dog!\n\n[Ben laughs]\n\nBill:: For this song, I think I did need some time off. Not so much to refine technique, per se, but to get to a higher level of understanding than notes-in-a-row about how I wanted the bass line to actually work. After our first session where we tried to do a little recording, which was really still where I was trying to figure out ideas and get a sense from you about what I should be doing, I had almost nothing decided for sure. It was humbling for me because I felt I might have wasted your time, but I just couldn't go faster or try things out. I didn't have enough of any of the three things—vocabulary, technique, or repertoire in this particular case (with this style of pop song) to be able to improvise and then record. So I had to work things out a bit more ahead of time. If this were a piece of writing I would say I need a really strong outline to work from I can't just sit down and count on a lot of experience with the macro or micro structures of the genre to carry me through. If it were a genre I knew more about, maybe I could have. Like if you'd have said let's make this a funk groove or a blues, or something, maybe I'd have had more to go on. But mostly I left that first recording session thinking I had homework to do! Or I left that first recording session thinking I got to get in the shed and work this out.\n\nBen: One of the other rhetorical concepts we talked about was rehearsal as an essential component of revising. The basic idea was this: through playing the song over and over again, we learned where it could improve or change. We discovered its possibilities. What is your take on rehearsal as a kind of revision process? Especially considering we just finished recording the song and rehearsal was kind of a part of that too, right?\n\nBill: Yeah, well, first I think of rehearsal as distinct from the kind of workout—practice, whatever you might call it—that you do to create adaptations. A rehearsal is more of a deliberate repeat, where \"deliberate\" means you are engaging in doing the thing again to try to be attentive to polishing up a performance in some way or like you were saying, maybe trying to find a different performance. This is usually done with a future performance in mind: a specific time, place, audience, etc. For recording I guess it is a future audience. Practice is not always like that. Sometimes I practice to create that adaptive stress, not with any specific performance in mind but to change my body in a way that will make a future performance possible.\n\nSo, can I ask you another question about this whole composing experience?\n\nBen: Yes, of course.\n\nBill: Because it is fascinating for me. When it comes to making the song, which, you know I've never done, I want to ask you… I felt like I was working at the very edge of my ability, like all of the time, in all of the model's areas: technique in terms of performance, trying to get that right, but specifically performance for recording, not making a lot stray noises, and then all the decisions that comprise the techniques of recording were completely new. I was working on repertoire in terms of pop songs of a certain era ('90s-ish), and then vocabulary which I could fill a page describing. But what I want to ask you is what if anything, do you feel like you might have learned from this particular process? And did you set this challenge for yourself in order to try learn something specific?\n\nBen: Well, I used to think that when I wrote music I worked exclusively in and with sound. Now I would think of myself as a practitioner of sound, so to speak, but you know I was a musician more or less, and that's how I felt most comfortable, picking up an instrument and playing and seeing what would happen. Today I realize that's not entirely true. Much of what I make relies on other kinds of genres, a lot like professional writers. Like the project managers I've studied, for example, some of those genres people will never see because they are part of a staging process. All the spreadsheets. The to-do lists, you know. The different kinds of boards they assemble to make sure that we can visualize work. That is all a part of a staging process, and for me, this is the kind of visualization of the song that I made for you.\n\nBill: Oh yeah, so I could figure out the parts.\n\nBen: Right. And in your work with Mark Zachry and Clay Spinuzzi (Spinuzzi, Hart-Davidson, & Zachry, 2006), you called these \"helper\" genres, texts put together to help someone do their job. I actually think those helper genres are no less powerful than the target genres, or in this case, the song. I needed all those helper genres to make the song a song. So I'm doing a lot more writing of words on a page and mapping of concepts visually than I ever really considered.\n\nI also didn't realize how quickly I toggle back and forth between technologies that help me visualize the song that I'm writing. So songwriting is already a visual process for me because I \"see\" the music so to speak, but spending so much time thinking about how a smartphone and a computer visualizes sounds, and how much those visualizations contribute to my decision-making, was startling. For example, the first version of the song being 4 minutes and knowing that I wanted to cut that down to 3 minutes or 3 minutes and 30 seconds… The computer told me that—it told me that it was 4 minutes long—it wasn't my ears. I may need to think about whether or not that's a good thing at some point. And then, seeing how the drums line up with the bass and guitars, how hand claps and vocals live together and occupy the same sonic space, and how the digital audio workstations literally visualize that for an author shows me that no matter what, sound is always made somehow visual for us—whether by associating it with records, CDs, playlists, mixtapes, or the printing of soundwaves on our screens. Even the file name of an MP3 is a kind of visualization.\n\nSo, I'm curious, Bill, how you might respond to this same question. What do you feel you might have learned from this particular composing process?\n\nBill: Oh [Laughs]\n\nBen: And did you set this challenge for yourself in order to learn something specific?\n\nBill: Ugh, I feel like learning overload, I feel like almost everything I did in making my part of this song is a new lesson, and I really only contributed a small piece. I'm a little overwhelmed by it, in fact. In a good way. So I'm not quite sure I really can say all the things I have learned just yet. But one thing I realized yesterday as I finally got what I felt like were all the parts of the bass line worked out so that I could repeat them is that every other time I'd learned a song, I had an existing song to reference and it acted as a really strong scaffold to my practice. So I could say \"well, there are three bits I have to get under my fingers: the verse, the chorus, the bridge—whatever\" and then I'd go pick one, listen to that, and start working out how I wanted to play it on the fingerboard. You know I had some choices but it was all laid out for me already.\n\nHere, I didn't have that. And, I mean, first I had to decide how many parts there were and then I had to figure out, based on the song demo you'd given me to work from—which had, like, drums and guitar and later the vocals—what I wanted to do. All of the parts were in flux while I was trying to learn them, and so the only place the bass part really existed was in my own head! And that was continuing up until the minute we recorded it.\n\nSo, I'd play it one way and kind of like it or not, and then maybe try something different the next time through. What I eventually did is if I hit on something I wanted to do that was at the level, vocabulary-wise, of a note or a phrase I wrote a few of those, what I would do is I would write them down, make a visual, so as not to lose them because otherwise I would forget it the next time through. And I wasn't writing notes like notes on a staff, I mean I could have done that, but I was writing the letters or a little note to myself like \"descend minor scale from D on the A string\"—so I'd just make a little note right there when I was figuring out \"what did I like about what I played?\"\"\n\nSo, the first breakthrough for me that I would say in terms of learning something was actually something you had reminded me of a long time ago when we were first working on a different piece that we wrote and that was the way other songs can be inspirations without having to be kind of direct quotes, and I realized the key center of the song and the tempo were close to \"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey. And so, just for a lark, I played the scratch track for Leslie at home, and instead of playing the line I'd been working on I played the Journey bass line just to show her and she laughed about it. But then, that made me see that I could outline the chords in the song like a bass player is supposed to do, but I didn't have to make just a boring pentatonic box—oh and there is another visual, right? Box on the fretboard.\n\nBen: [Laughs] Right.\n\nBill: I could make a little melody line with more movement than that. So that's how I found that intro bass riff that I think now becomes a little motif in the song. And a similar analogy led me to the descending line in the chorus, except it was \"I Want You Back\" by the Jackson 5, which has a descending line in the chorus of it's song too.\n\nBen: So while you weren't learning other people's songs, you were using other people's songs to make your own!\n\nBill: Yeah, like I was thinking about it, and going \"Oh you know that descending line might sound good here.\" I mean it's a completely different key, different tempo, nothing really is the same about it except that going down the scale sounded like an interesting complement to what you were doing vocally and what you were doing with the rhythm track.\n\nBen: Right!\n\nBill: So I want to come back to this learning bit because I'm fascinating by another thing that you said when we were texting back and forth, and we were sending these clips—voice memos and so forth. You noted that the venn diagram that we made for the learning model helps you to envision the pathway to learning and composing as a kind of spiral through those various areas.\n\nBen: Yes!\n\nBill: And for me, this invoked a foundational idea in composition studies, really, and in design too, when you think about it, or UX and that is the idea that the composing is a recursive process. I haven't really dwelt on the idea of recursion—of a thing recurving back onto itself—as a visual metaphor, but it certainly is one! So, do you think that it is important to have something to spiral towards? When we are thinking about learning? Or is it enough to spin endlessly through those circles or do you have to work towards something like we did here with the song?\n\nBen: I think as a metaphor for learning, spiraling makes more sense to me than scaffolding, even though I imagine that I do, and I did, in this particular project, both. One thing I did see is that I tend to separate the song from the performance of the song, so I suppose I see spiraling to have an end when you're saying, okay I'm done writing a song, and now that song is written. At some point you have the components and you just say I'm gonna call this song good, and move on. But, for me, the performance of a song is a very different inventional process. Take for example Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah,\" which is an amazing song, but the performance of it by Jeff Buckley really stuck with me a lot longer than the original recording by Cohen. The song was the song, with verses, chorus, melody, time signature, chord progressions, etc.… but the performance of those elements can vary.\n\nIn writing, I think we can do something similar by separating our ideas from the performance of our ideas. I think over time we learn to perform ideas better, or that we have a particular kind of performance we feel better executing. We call these \"moves\" or rhetorical moves. In other words, our first take is rarely our best when we're recording. In this way, I see writing as largely performative. Sometimes ideas are good, but the performance isn't right. Sometimes the performance is right, but the ideas are lacking.\n\nI suppose what I'm getting at is that we spiral towards some sort of conclusion or ending, but that's mostly arbitrary in my experience. We continue to refine how we define our ideas over time as we learn how to perform them for different audiences, purposes, and situations. And we do that through rehearsal while we are inventing or discovering ideas, but also while we are thinking about how to perform the ideas for others.\n\nSo, you had some good ideas, Bill, on how this translated from writing music to composing more broadly. Explain how you saw this connection.\n\nBill: Well, I have to credit you for showing me that it seems now obvious in retrospect… that, you know, in my life I do write and rewrite the same idea in order to increase my own understanding of it. I suppose that has always been true but it was never really very obvious to me. I want to say one more thing about the song before I go back to this idea about how making the song reflects on how we learn to compose, but the thing about the song that I want to say is it does feel to me now like we wrote a song, although that wasn't true yesterday.\n\nBen: [Laughs]\n\nBill: And its also not necessarily true that I feel like we've ever performed the song…\n\nBen: [Laughs]\n\nBill: … because we haven't sat together in a room while you are singing and I'm playing and you're playing and we've performed it. So it's weird to think about how yeah we wrote a song but we never performed the song. Maybe that, to a musician, that's a natural idea, but it's kind of a new concept for me. But here's one thing that's really true is that it did change my vocabulary for writing songs, so now I think it's a little more reasonable that I might one day write a song. Because building vocabulary, for me, means more than just learning new words or a new notes or a new kind of scale. It also means consolidating smaller bits into larger ones and making those available to yourself as compositional tools. So words and sentences and paragraphs, for instance, become \"sections\" of an academic argument, these rhetorical moves that we can use to lay out a macro-structure for an argument and that will move the dialogue forward in a given academic discussion. So, these are the moves you are talking about and we use them all the time as experienced writers, we're like \"We'll do this, then we'll do that…\" We don't strategize about every word we put on the page, though. We'll say, \"We'll have a little lit review here and then we'll go to add a methods section there.\"\n\nWe do this visually, by the way. Or at least we use visual formats to facilitate these acts of consolidation and transposition, is what I want to call them. Think of an outline or a wireframe, for instance. I could pass you that on a document and it would function as a kind of gestalt (see Hart-Davidson, 1996), so you could be like, \"okay I'll take this section and you take that section,\" and we've done that when we've written other stuff.\n\nBen: Right. That's true.\n\nBill: So, for example, how does this apply for music though? I think notes become larger structures like chords, chords become chord progressions, and then you can use to invoke whole genres such as the blues. So, you can learn to play the individual tones in the minor pentatonic scale on a guitar, it's often the thing we learn first because its pretty simple to just—every other fret in a box shape, and we can consolidate those over time by associate them with a shape on the fretboard. You talked about composing songs before and thinking really just about shapes. It's a little like Tetris. When I was first learning I was like \"oh this is Tetris.\" An L-shape or a T-shape or whatever. The ability to move that shape to a new location or a new key means we can use not just the notes but the whole scale as an element to compose with in a chord progression or a pattern like the 12-bar blues and we can play the blues starting with any key. A musician need only shout out \"Blues in G\" and we know this means we have the notes of the minor pentatonic scale, with an emphasis on the flat seven in each key to work with and then we'll move from the key of G for four bars, on to C and then to A. And that's because we follow this I, IV, V progression that is the blues. And that twelve-bar pattern becomes another vocabulary element all by itself that consolidates rhythm and melody and establishes when the key changes happen and in what order and all that stuff, and we can get it all just by saying \"Let's play the blues\" and I don't even have to tell you that, and you know at the end will come a turnaround, right? The signature little bit that always comes at the end of that twelve-bar phrase. I can get all that just by saying \"Let's play blues in G.\"\n\nSo, any of these things can be called out as compositional elements. That's what I mean by your vocabulary developing. If I say, \"hey folks, let's play the ascending line on the turnaround the first time through and then we'll let the guitar play the descending line the second time through.\" So then we can talk about variations and that's all because they are in our vocabulary in a different way. We're not thinking about tiny little bits, but we are thinking about whole patterns. So, that's what's pretty amazing to me is at this level, I think, especially with this song, you were working at that pattern level. And I felt like all the way along I was running behind as fast as I could note for note, one note at a time.\n\nBen: Right, right—that makes total sense to me. I think, you know, one of the things I find kind of interesting, kind of reflecting back on it now too, is how much of those patterns occur in basically any genre of music. You are talking about the box pattern, and when I was writing and choosing chords, and I was using power chords, I wasn't thinking of the scales, but I was thinking \"oh naturally this chord follows this\" because that's what fits the pattern. Right? Similar to when you are making a list in a document. Right? In which case you are trying to visually design information in a way that makes it easily digestible. Right? And so, I see myself drawing frequently on those patterns even if I'm not stopping to go \"Oh I'm using a pattern here. Or I'm using this move.\" It's just I understand that that's one of the moves that can be made.\n\nBill: I think the revelation for me—the first visual-auditory connection when I started learning to play the bass was this notion that you can have a chord in a single-voiced instrument like I learned on a saxophone. I was only ever one note on a chord. Playing the guitar you have these notes laid out for you on the fretboard, and all of a sudden a chord isn't just three notes it's a shape and you are like \"Ohhh.\" And the cool thing is changing keys before with a single-voiced instrument was always a pain because if I'm in the key of C, concert C is great. No sharps, no flats. That means every note you're going to play the natural version of that note. But then if you start changing that around all of a sudden I've got to transpose in my head and move things up and down. Or I have to play all these notes—even in musical notation they are called accidentals. And that's because what you can do pretty easily on the fretboard or on the keyboard of the piano which is just slide your hand over one little bit, takes mental gymnastics on the saxophone.\n\n[\"For the 1979\" outro fades up]\n\nBen: Here is where we end our reflection—for now. If you haven't already, we invite you to listen and respond to other parts of this webtext. We hope that you found our orientation to learning as demonstrated in the model useful for your own composing practices.\n\n[\"For the 1979\" outro fades out]"
