        "text": "Biography\n\nClay Davidson was born in Saltville, Virginia to a musical family. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee in search of a record deal. While in Nashville, Davidson won Charlie Daniels' Talent Round-Up show in 1995. Davidson and his wife later moved to Tennessee, and Davidson soon became a demo singer for other artists.\n\nDavidson was later called in to substitute for Michael McDonald at a party for rock artist Jude Cole. While at the party, Cole recommended Davidson to Scott Hendricks, who had just started the Virgin Records Nashville label. Davidson's first album, Unconditional, was released in 2000, producing three hit singles on the country music charts.\n\nIn early 2001, Virgin Records announced that it would be closing its Virgin Nashville branch. Virgin's artist roster was transferred to Capitol Nashville. Davidson, however, did not record any albums or singles during his tenure on Capitol. On July 20, 2001, Davidson and his touring band were involved in a bus accident outside Effingham, Illinois. He and his band mates suffered only minor cuts and bruises, but several concerts had to be cancelled.\n\nDavidson has now teamed up with his younger brother Arnold Davidson and formed a new duo act named Damn Davidsons. Album release is set for some time in fall/winter of 2016. www.damndavidsons.com"
