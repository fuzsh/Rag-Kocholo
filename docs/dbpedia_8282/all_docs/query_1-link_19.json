        "text": "Arnold Davidson of Marion began his journey as a musician when he was a toddler.\n\nHe was one of four children born to Mack and Annette Roark Davidson of Saltville. His father Mack was a musician and passed his love of music on to his children. His sister, Stacy, sings; his brother, Carlton, plays the drums in Davidson’s band; and his brother, Clay, plays guitar and sings.\n\n“It was instilled in me at a very young age. I started playing drums when I was three. Just being around a musical family, just surrounded with it, dad, my brothers, my uncles, just everywhere you looked, my cousins, they were all singing and playing. I was just brought up in it,” Davidson said, adding both his parents came from musical families.\n\nHis father “dabbled in a little bit of everything, but mostly older country. He had several opportunities to go and play with some national acts, but he chose to stay home because he had kids,” Davidson said.\n\nDavidson started out playing in his dad’s band, played in several local bands over several years, and now has ventured out on his own. He just finished recording his first solo CD in May.\n\n“When I was playing with my dad, we played everywhere, everything from going to friends’ and family’s living rooms to pick to shows and festivals. Dad actually played the Saltville Labor Day Celebration from the first time that it started. He never missed a year. It started at the football field. They pulled a flatbed trailer in there and that’s where Labor Day actually started. I played a lot in church with him. We did a lot of festivals. He was more or less a guitar man for hire. He played music for just about everybody and didn’t know a stranger,” Davidson said.\n\nDavidson’s father had several opportunities for a professional music career, but that was not to be.\n\n“I can remember when he was younger he told me these stories about Johnny Cash. He was somewhere locally, I’m not sure where. Dad was a teenager and had a band together at the time. It consisted of him and his brothers. They were playing at a Moose Lodge or some type of deal like that. Johnny Cash’s manager had actually come in after Johnny’s show to just kind of hang out. He offered for dad to come and play guitar for Johnny Cash. Dad went home and asked his mom and dad and they told him no, that he wasn’t getting out there and running around. He was young. He told me, ‘I cried for about a week.’ I would have too. He was just beside himself,” Davidson said.\n\nDavidson’s father was also offered an opportunity to play with the Bellamy Brothers, but, because he had children at home, he turned down that opportunity as well.\n\nDavidson went from playing drums to playing guitar, bass, piano, dobro, harmonica, mandolin and banjo. He also sings and writes songs.\n\nCurrently his older brother, Carlton, is playing drums in his band.\n\n“Another fellow who is a brother more than a family friend, he helped me some growing up and has been in a few bands with me, Jar Hogston, plays bass for me. He introduced me to this very talented young man, Blake Stevens, who is quite a guitar player. He’s 19 years old and lives in North Carolina. He’s actually attending college right now for music. He plans to pursue his music career and wants to move to Nashville after he graduates. He is a phenomenal guitar player for his age. He plays guitar for me,” Davidson said.\n\nDavidson was young when he realized that he wanted to make his living playing music.\n\n“The band that I was actually in officially at about age five was a band called Backwoods that consisted of myself, my brother Clay, who played guitar and sang, his best friend Robbie Hunt, who played bass, and another good friend of ours, Scott Roop, who played guitar. My first real big show was when I was five and we opened for Restless Heart. I’ve been hooked ever since. That will do it,” he said.\n\nBand names and members changed over the years, but Davidson, Clay and Hunt remained consistently in the group.\n\n“Southern Grace was the longest running band. When I was nine, we had already formed that band. I played my first bar with them when I was nine. That was at the Ford Grill. That was my first bar gig. We were kind of like the house band there. We felt like it. We were there every weekend, it seemed. It was wild. It was really kind of scary at times,” Davidson said.\n\n“Backwoods, Southern Grace and Bad Influence, those were the three main bands I played in. I did a lot of fill-in work, just jammin’ around with a lot of other bands. We opened for a lot of nationally known groups – Restless Heart, Shenandoah, Billy Ray Cyrus, Garth Brooks, Canyon, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Black Oak Arkansas,” Davidson said.\n\nWhen he graduated from high school in 1999, Davidson joined his brother Clay on the road. Clay had gone to Nashville and cut a CD and was touring with national acts, including Aaron Tippin, Travis Tritt, Joe Diffie, Jo Dee Messina, Lee Ann Womack, Deana Carter, Rascal Flatts and Neal McCoy.\n\n“I’ve always said, even through school, ‘I’m going to play music for a living. That’s what I want to do.’ I ended up playing drums and touring with Clay. A big item on my bucket list was to play the Grand Ole Opry. At 19 years old, I played it twice. I played the televised and the radio shows. So I did get to do that,” Davidson said.\n\nIn 2001, touring with his brother came to an end when they were involved in a bus accident while on the road.\n\n“That pretty much ended everything else that was going on with my brother. I moved back home, and we still did a few shows after the bus wreck, but not very many and it never really took back off,” Davidson said.\n\nBut, in 2005, Davidson reached the point where he knew he would only be happy if he actively pursued his music career.\n\n“I was thirsting for that feeling, that satisfaction that I had had. There’s no drug in the world or any other kind of stimulant that can give me what I need, what I get when I play music. It’s just such a big deal to me. I missed that. I missed the stage,” he said.\n\nHe put together a band called Back for More and played for two to three years. Band members changed and the band name changed to Caution. Davidson played for another three years with Caution. It was during this time that he began writing songs. None of the band members in Caution were interested in pursuing things any further, so Davidson began looking for a band that wanted to “try to do something on a larger scale, to do songs I had written and songs we had written together, original material,” Davidson said.\n\nThe new band was called Take Five and it eventually became Govt Plant.\n\n“We had a really good long run with Govt Plant. We got to do a lot of really cool shows with those guys and meet a lot of really cool people. We played a mash up of outlaw country and southern rock with a little bit of blues thrown in. It’s kind of like I take everything I grew up around and grew up playing and just mashed it together. That’s where my sound sort of comes from,” Davidson said.\n\nGovt Plant released one CD before the band dissolved.\n\n“Then, I was just kind of out there on my own. I took a break from performing, but not from writing. I was still writing my own stuff. I still had that vision. I still wanted to do this. I kept writing and doing a lot of acoustic shows. I could kind of play what I wanted to play at any given moment. That’s pretty much where I am now,” he said.\n\nDavidson’s wife, Jessica, encouraged him to record a CD, something he had always wanted to do on his own. Jessica writes poetry and song lyrics, and she and Davidson co-wrote the song Truth Will Stand. Davidson included it on his CD. He and Jessica occasionally perform on stage together as well.\n\nDavidson plays all the instruments on his CD, first recording the acoustic tracks. He would then go back and record the same song again and play the drum tracks and so on until complete. He did have a couple of extras who played the B-3 organ and pedal steel guitar on the CD.\n\nHe began work on the CD in October of 2016 and released it May 19. Physical copies are available at his shows or through him. The CD is available online from iITunes, Amazon, Spotify, Google Play, CD Baby and other sites where music can be downloaded.\n\nDavidson’s CD, More Outlaw than Me, includes several songs he has written along with songs written by Nashville songwriters he is friends with that have written for George Strait, Eric Church and other nationally-known performers.\n\nOne of those songs, McComb Mississippi, has opened some doors for Davidson that could well bring him closer to fulfilling his dream.\n\nHe released McComb Mississippi as a single, using the money from downloads to help pay for his CD. He and Jessica shot a video of the song and uploaded it to YouTube.\n\n“I was doing a live feed every Sunday on my music Facebook page. My normal routine was to check the views on YouTube to see how many people had viewed the video, do my live feed, wait about 30 minutes and go back and check to see if the views had gone up. I was just trying to keep track of it and see how well it was working. It was Jan. 1. I checked YouTube and had 750 views. I finished the live feed for that day, checked YouTube again as usual. The views had jumped to 1,800. I wait just a couple of minutes and I hit refresh. They are up to 2,000. I hit refresh. They keep climbing. In about an hour and a half, I had over 4,000 views of McComb Mississippi,” Davidson said.\n\nHe began receiving messages on his Facebook page from radio stations in the city of McComb.\n\n“They were saying, ‘Do you know your song is circulating very heavily down here?’ Of course I didn’t know that at the time, so I said, ‘That’s awfully cool.’ I got to talking to them and we set up a radio interview,” Davidson said.\n\nA friend of Davidson who had been his keyboard player in Govt Plant now drives for Garth Brooks. He contacted the mayor of McComb. The mayor already knew about the song and wanted Davidson to come to the city and play a show.\n\nVal Deer, a lifelong entrepreneur, businessman, executive producer and talent manager and a resident of McComb, was delighted to have Davidson come to McComb and play Big Daddy’s Blues Club and Cultural Exchange, a recently opened club owned by Deer’s daughter, Ashley Nichols.\n\n“Arnold connected to us through Mississippi’s Scenic Rivers Development Alliance director, Joseph Parker. My daughter… was looking for a special performer to highlight the grand opening of her new venue. It was simply meant to be. Arnold’s talent and new song McComb, Mississippi made it a no brainer. Scenic Rivers assisted Ashley with the promotion of the event, which drew the likes of (rock ‘n’ roll legend) Bo Diddely’s family to Big Daddy’s. Arnold’s music was so well received, as the crowd was singing, clapping and even dancing along. I can’t wait to see what Arnold has in store for us next,” said Deer.\n\nThe people of McComb want Davidson to return for another performance, and songs from his CD are being played on three radio stations there, country, gospel and R&B stations, Deer said.\n\nAlthough Deer is unable to comment on any plans to promote Davidson’s career at this time, he is impressed with Davidson’s talent.\n\n“Arnold is the real deal. He and his wife Jessica stayed with us at our home during their visit to McComb. After hearing him in person, I knew immediately he is someone I want to work with. I will do what I can in presenting Arnold and his music to the world. Arnold is a genuine, gifted, very talented person, humble, down to earth with a positive attitude, a true professional. Words can’t describe Arnold’s music. You’ll have to listen for yourself. I am sure you will be hearing more from Arnold Davidson in the music world,” Deer said.\n\n“Big Daddy’s is such a cool place. It really is. I wish I lived closer because I would be frequenting that place. You can’t put Big Daddy’s in one category. It says blues club in the name. Of course there is going to be blues there. Not only is blues going to be there, there’s going to be jazz, country and rock, a mix of different genres of music. Big Daddy’s whole point is to bring as many kinds of people together as possible,” Davidson said.\n\nWhen he arrived in McComb, Davidson was reminded of his hometown of Saltville. The city was small with lots of vacant buildings, “but the ones that are occupied, the community is pretty strong with it. Big Daddy’s is very new, but it’s such a cool place…. The building used to be a hot spot in the ‘80s for the hair metal bands. Warrant, Great White and Poison have played there. Lots of music has come through that building,” Davidson said.\n\nWhile performing at Big Daddy’s, Davidson had the opportunity to meet Evelyn, the daughter of Bo Diddley and other members of the family.\n\n“Val Deer is a super cool guy. He is very excited, very enthusiastic about everything I am doing. We have plans to pursue some things together. When I was at Big Daddy’s, I got to meet and share the stage with Bo Diddley’s daughter. That was super cool…. She got my information. Val knows them on a more personal level. He has my information as well. I am hoping we are going to be heading down to Florida where they live to do some shows there. We’ll just have to kind of wait and see when that does come about or how,” Davidson said.\n\nAlthough McComb Mississippi is not Davidson’s original material, but is one of the songs written by Nashville songwriters Monty Chriswell and Rick Huckabay, Davidson is certainly happy the song came his way.\n\n“I was just lucky enough to get my hands on it. A few of the songs were on hold by other artists, but none of them had been cut. They are great songs. They need to be heard,” he said.\n\nMcComb’s mayor would probably agree.\n\n“I had the greatest day when Arnold and Jessica Davidson stopped by my office for a visit. They were in town promoting their hit song McComb Mississippi. The lyrics speak to me in two special ways – my favorite city and Lynyrd Skynyrd. I wish Arnold much success,” said Mayor Whitney Rawlings.\n\nJeromy Spiers, guitarist, songwriter and musician, was also impressed with Davidson’s music.\n\n“Authentic country music, Arnold Davidson is as good as anybody in Nashville right now. I invited everyone to check out Arnold’s music,” Spiers said.\n\nJoseph Parker, director of Mississippi’s Scenic Rivers Development Alliance, agreed.\n\n“Raw talent, outstanding, please include Mississippi’s Scenic Rivers Region on your list for future performances,” Parker said.\n\nWhile Davidson is waiting for things to take off in his career following his trip to Mississippi, he can be seen locally at the Wohlfahrt Haus Dinner Theater in Wytheville as the drummer in the show Million Dollar Quartet.\n\nSpeaking of his theater work, he said, “I’m still trying to play music any way that I can.… It’s kind of a break from what’s going on here back to my roots, the kind of music where everything started. That whole show is the music of Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. It’s a really cool throwback to Dad and some of the music that I cut my teeth on,” Davidson said.\n\nIn addition to playing music, Davidson loves to cook, draw, paint and fish. He and Jessica have three children.\n\nFor more information on Davidson, visit arnolddavidson.com or check out his Facebook page.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
