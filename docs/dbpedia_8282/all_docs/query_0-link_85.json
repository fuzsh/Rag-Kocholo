        "text": "Welcome to the Jerry Run Page\n\nThe J Max McKee & Ken Scoggins show scheduled for August 24 has been cancelled due to illness of band member\n\nWelcome to our 22nd season! We are excited to be presenting another summer of live music for your listening pleasure! We appreciate the talented groups that will grace our stage this summer as they fine-tune their set lists to avoid songs licensed by BMI. (We have decided not to renew our BMI license this year as a matter of principle; musicians will be playing original and public domain songs as well as those from the extensive ASCAP catalog.)\n\nHope to see lots of familiar faces and to make new friends and fans as we look forward to another summer of live music in our one-of-a-kind rustic theater where live music lives!\n\nemail [email protected] or call 304-493-6574 for info or reservations\n\n2024 SCHEDULE\n\nAll shows start at 7:oo\n\nMay\n\n24 Friday Carpenter Ants\n\nseats for this show are $10 and reservations are welcome\n\nOld-Style Rythym & Blues, Gospel Soul and Country Funk.\n\nEven the best bands come and go but the Charleston WV-based Carpenter Ants have defied the odds and been together for well over 30 years, with their trademark country-soul sound rich, soulful harmonies, stinging solos and a rock-solid rhythm section that captures that rare, loose-but-tight feel, and has won the band international as well as regional acclaim. In 2021, they lost founding member Charlie Tee to Covid, and he is remembered wherever they go. West Virginia's premier rhythm & blues group, the Ants guitarist Michael Lipton, drummer Jupie Little, bassist Ted Harrison and keyboardist, multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter Mark Bates have quietly amassed a resume that rivals many national groups. With an arsenal of classic and forgotten American music, the Ants wail through classic R&B, country-swamp and gospel-soul with equal conviction. Regardless of the occasion, they never fail to have a good time and that feeling is contagious.\n\nhttp://www.carpenterants.wvmusichalloffame.com/\n\nJune\n\n&nbsp7 Friday Benefit for Cystic Fibrosis\n\n15 Saturday Mack Samples Band\n\nseats for this show are $7 and reservations are welcome\n\nAlthough the composition of the band has changed some over the years, the Samples Brothers Band (now known and the Mack Samples Band) has been around since the mid-1970s.
