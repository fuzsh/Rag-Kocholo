        "text": "February 11, 2024\n\nI just had a fun Saturday and Sunday! I had the honor of getting to play a few on some shows with the legendary John Cowan (of New Grass Revival and The Doobie Brothers) along with the amazing Luke Bulla (most recently of Lyle Lovett's Large band) and Ethan Ballinger (currently with Miranda Lambert.) Sometimes I get really lucky and I am thankful for it!\n\nl-r: Scott Anderson, Luke Bulla, John Cowan, Ethan Ballinger (hidden)\n\nl-r: Ethan Ballinger, Scott Anderson, Luke Bulla, John Cowan\n\nWe have another great mato house concert lined up on Friday, March 8 with two of my heroes and friends, Alan Munde and Jim Hurst. Click here for details and tickets\n\nJanuary 20, 2024\n\nWe had Luke Bulla dazzling the crowd tonight at one of our mato house concerts. He also did a fiddle workshop before the show. He sounded fantastic in the living room! If you've never seen a show like this, you need to.\n\nAugust 20, 2023\n\nI attended my first Blue Ridge Banjo Camp last week Béla with a group of fantastic instructors led by the great Béla Fleck. I learned some things and came home with a bunch of homework, and it was a great time!\n\nat Béla's morning session\n\ngoofing around with Lluís Gómez\n\ngoofing around with Tony Trischka\n\nScott with Jake Schepps and our top tension cousins\n\nrehearsing for the show\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nI had a great time playing with Medicine Springs at Suwannee Spring Reunion. I'm teaching a lot this year and have already taught at Suwannee Banjo Camp and Bluegrass and Gee's Bend Camp. Next month I'll be at Midwest Banjo Camp and in July out in Texas at Camp Bluegrass. I hope to see you somewhere along the way!\n\nFebruary 13, 2023\n\nJoin us on Saturday, March 4, from 1-8pm at Rum 138 near Fort White, FL, to honor the life of James “Tuck” Tucker, dobro master and my dear friend, who passed away on December 24, 2021. I played a lot of music and spent a lot of time with Tuck over the last 30 years or so, and that was after watching him on stage for 10 years and marveling at his mastery of that slidy guitar thing. He was a fantastic player and always a lot of fun to be around. We all miss him. Come out and enjoy some music from a bunch of his friends on March 4. Tuck would like that.\n\nJanuary 12, 2023\n\nI'm headed up for Banjothon tomorrow to start a busy banjo year for me.\n\nI'll be teaching this year at four (so far) different music camps: Suwannee Banjo Camp in Florida this March, Bluegrass and Gee's Camp in Alabama this April, Midwest Banjo Camp in Indiana this June, and Camp Bluegrass in Texas this July. Hope to see you at at least one of these!\n\nI'll also have some gigs with Medicine Springs and who knows what else.\n\nHere is a photo from one of my recent mato music house concerts with the amazing Luke Bulla.\n\nOctober 27, 2022\n\nOne quick Facebook Live video from the Gamble Rogers Gala a few weeks ago:\n\nSeptember 6, 2022\n\nBe sure and come out for an all too rare appearance of Medicine Springs in St. Augustine in October!\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\nI've been back to playing some music lately and more is on the calendar! I taught at the Midwest Banjo Camp in Holland, MI last month. In July it was off to Nashville to play at The Station Inn with my old buddy Jim Hurst for his CD release party. We've got more shows with Jim this weekend and next month and I'll be back at Midwest Banjo Camp in 2023. Come on out!\n\nJuly 13, 2022\n\nMy old friend Mike Hyde passed away today from a recently diagnosed cancer after a couple of years of other health problems. We were bandmates for years in The Bluegrass Parlor Band and then Endless Highway. Mike was a fantastic musician but he may have been an even better storyteller. You couldn't be around him for more than a minute before he'd have you laughing. He will be missed, but I'll try to be sure you see him at least once a year around Christmas time with Endless Highway's rendition of Santa Claus Is coming to Town on YouTube.\n\nJune 18, 2021\n\nFinally live music is coming back at we have some shows on the schedule!\n\nFor details always check my Shows page. I hope to see you soon!\n\nMarch 18, 2021\n\nIt's been a terrible few years for a number of reasons, but the worst of those for me was the loss of my wife Mary to pancreatic cancer. I'll love and miss her always.\n\nPlease visit her memorial site and if you are so inclined, please donate to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network in her memory. It's a terrible disease and we still have no really good treatments.\n\nMary Anderson Memorial Page\n\nJanuary 26, 2020\n\nOn August 31, 2019, a day when the weatherman told us that Hurricane Dorian would hit us, we had our first Belle Oaks Music Festival near Brooker, FL. The hurricane stayed away and everyone had a great time, so Doug and Michelle Green, Scott Roberts, and I decided to make it an annual thing. Our next one is coming next month on February 22 when we don't expect any hurricanes. We've got some great bands coming so make your plans now!\n\nMore info here: https://scottandersonmusic.com/mato-concerts\n\nJanuary 24, 2019\n\nGreat fun last weekend at the Baygrass Festival in Islamorada. I played a duo set with the amazing Silas Powell and we had a blast! Below is a photo in which Silas appears to have a chicken on his head. The whole festival is a lot of fun. Come on down next year!\n\nI'll be playing with the Driftwoods again soon and also have another show with Don't Pet the Grass doing bluegrassish versions of Tom Petty tunes. The band includes Tom’s former Mudcrutch bandmate Danny Roberts along with Mike Boulware, James Tuck Tucker, and myself.\n\nFor details always check my Shows page. I hope to see you soon!\n\nOctober 11, 2018\n\nIBMA 2018 was a blast! I got to see some great new and old bands and some great new and old friends. It was great to see my buddy Ned Luberecki win a well-deserved Banjo Player of the Year award!\n\nLast Friday I had a fun recording session for Andre Michaud with partners Tuck Tucker, Gabe Valla, Lis Williamson, and Barbara Johnson at Gatorbone Studios with Lon Williamson at the helm.\n\nCome out to see Gabe, Lis, Lon and I on November 3 in St. Augustine! For details always check my Shows page.\n\nI got to play Earl Scruggs' old Vega!\n\nHere with Johnny Baier (of the American Banjo Museum) and Gary \"Biscuit\" Davis - both amazing players!\n\nMay 3, 2018\n\nI was lucky enough to get to play a few tunes with the legendary Peter Rowan, Chris Henry, and Lon and Lis Williamson at the Thomas Center show. What a blast! (photos courtesy of Russell Ettllng and rick Davidson)\n\nMarch 9, 2018\n\nI've had some fun gigs with Lon, Lis, and Gabe lately and now it's almost time again for Suwannee Banjo Camp 2018. If you are a banjo player (or want to be one) come on out. I promise you'll be glad you did!\n\nHere I am with one of my banjo heroes and fellow instructor, the great Alan Munde at Suwannee Banjo Camp, 2017\n\nJanuary 9, 2018\n\nHappy New Year! It's busy already with good music happenings...\n\nLast week I met Rodney Dillard when he was here in Gainesville doing a show with the Walker Brothers. I wish we'd had more time for me to hear more of his great stories!\n\nLast weekend I was in Knoxville for the annual Banjothon and Loarfest. I saw and played a lot of great instruments and visited with a lot of old friends. My weekend was made especially memorable by a reunion with my old friend Charlie Cobble. Charlie is the nicest guy you could ever meet, and he was the first great banjo player I got to see and hear really close up. In addition to knowing all of the standard banjo tunes and more, he could play every note of every fiddle tune with flowing ease. When I first stumbled upon a jam with Charlie and his picking buddies at the festival Slagle’s Pasture in Elizabethton, Tennessee, they were nice enough to invite me as a 16 year old kid to play with them. It was scary as heck for me to drop into that group of amazing pickers, but it was a blast! I always left inspired to learn more and I returned every summer for the next several years until I started college. I’ve been wishing I could pick like Charlie ever since! We hadn’t seen each other in person in over 30 years so it was really great to see him and talk for a while.\n\nI played last Sunday night at Creekside Dinery in St. Augustine filling in with the Driftwoods. I have three more of those dates in the next couple of months so come out for some great food and music.\n\nNext weekend I'll be down in the Keys again as the Jambassador for the Baygrass Festival. Come on down and play a tune! For details always check my Shows page.\n\nAugust 4, 2017\n\nIt's been a hot, wet summer with some music sprinkled in.\n\nI recently visited backstage at the Grand Ole Opry with my friend Jake Workman, the amazing guitar player with Ricky Skaggs. My buddies Aubrey Haynie and Scott Vestal just happened to be filling in that night and Scott let me try out his 1933 Granada (it started as a PB.) Sadly, he didn't leave any of his notes on it for me. (Before you ask, that's George Gruhn on the couch and Ricky Skaggs in the doorway.)\n\nI did a gig at Satchel's recently with my old buddy Tuck Tucker as a duo and Slidey and I had a great time. We'll be doing some more of that. Come out and see me next on Aug. 24 with the Gatorbone band in St. Augustine! For details always check my Shows page.\n\nMay 4, 2017\n\nSuwannee Banjo Camp was another great one! Everyone I talked to said they had a great time. Put it on your calendar every year!\n\nWatch for some of my upcoming shows - I have one next week with Tuck Tucker at Lightnin' Salvage at Satchel's Pizza.\n\nFebruary 3, 2017\n\nLast month I was a Jambassador for the 2017 Baygrass Festival in Islamorada. It was a great time! Thanks to my buddies in Grandpa's Cough Medicine for inviting me onstage for a few tunes. Those boys like to play fast! I also got to jam for a few hours with Mike Compton, Silas Powell, Anjelica Grim Doerfel, and AJ Lee among many others. It was great to sing a few songs with Anjelica and AJ. What great singers!\n\nL-r: Scott Anderson, Mike Compton, Josh Powell, and SIlas Powell\n\nI stopped playing for a minute to take a quick video at the finale of the 2017 Baygrass Festival.\n\nCome out and hear me this Friday with The Mitch Corbin Trio at Disney Springs and on Sunday with The Driftwoods at Creekside Dinery. For more info click here:.\n\nJanuary 9, 2017\n\nI was lucky enough to visit my first Banjothon this past weekend in Knoxville (thanks, Roger!) I met some new friends, saw some old ones, and played a BUNCH of great prewar Gibsons. Here are a few photos including a photobomb by J.D. Crowe himself! Thanks to Ned Luberecki for that great shot. I'm holding J.D.'s old \"Banger\" there. This 1929 original 3, no-hole flathead #9467-5 can be heard on many classic Jimmy Martin recordings as well as Rounder 0044, Bluegrass Album Band and many more. I've spent many hours trying to emulate the sound of that player and that banjo.\n\nSome of the herd.\n\nThe amazing Noam Pikelny here. I was lucky enough to hear Noam play quite a bit and he let me play his old Granada too. I really liked it.\n\nJamming here with banjo master Ned Lubercki and the fantastic Chris Joslin on a batch of old top tension models.\n\nDecember 16, 2016\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nI had the good fortune to sit in with my friends The Driftwoods at Creekside Dinery for a few tunes last month. I'll be filling in for Eric Searcy with them for a few more dates in February and March. I'll also be doing some shows with Lis, Lon, and Gabe as a new band, as of yet unnamed. So please send me some good band name suggestions!\n\nJune 28, 2016\n\nI was in Virginia recently visiting family and attending the memorial service for Dr. Ralph Stanley. It was an emotional time honoring a great man who was also a legendary musician. He will be greatly missed. You can see more of my thoughts on Ralph and some photos here.\n\nIn one of the most surreal moments of my life, I sat next to Ralph during a banjo workshop at MerleFest 2014 when he announced that he would be cancelling his already-announced retirement. And then the assembled players onstage all played a round of his own Clinch Mountain Backstep in his honor. I will never forget that moment. You can see YouTube video of all this here.\n\nMay 2, 2016\n\nI just returned from another great Merlefest hearing some great music and seeing a lot of old (and new) friends. Here is Flattop and me with an excellent Photobomb courtesy of Steve Johnson​ himself.\n\nApril 2, 2016\n\nRecently I taught at another Suwannee Banjo Camp. If you have never been to a camp like this, GO! It's a great experience.\n\nIn the near future I'll be working on a few new project including a new (additional) band configuration that promises to be a lot of fun. I will also have an article on the American Banjo Museum published in an upcoming issue of Banjo Newsletter. Stay tuned!\n\nFebruary 28, 2016\n\nI had my buddy Jim Hurst do a house concert last night and as usual he was amazing! I got to play a few tunes with him too which was a lot of fun.\n\nI've got a show coming up on March 6 with my friends The Driftwoods (filling in for Eric who will be surfing the North Shore of Oahu - lucky dog!) at Creekside Dinery in St. Augustine. Come out for some great food and music.\n\nAlso Suwannee Banjo Camp 2016 is fast approaching on the third weekend in March. Be there!\n\nFebruary 18, 2016\n\nRecently I was lucky enough to get to play with one of my mandolin heroes, David Grisman. Yes, Dawg himself. What a blast! Thanks to my buddy Mickey Abraham for making it happen! Hope to see you soon...\n\nDecember 9, 2016\n\nMerry Christmas! At this time of year I always remember the video above of my old band Endless Highway and my friend the late Greg Turner. I hope you like it.\n\nNow is also a good time to remember the banjo players in your life with a gift of Suwannee Banjo Camp 2016. That's always a great time.\n\nKeep checking back here for shows I'll be playing as well as shows I'll be promoting. I'm working on details now for a great one on January 9...\n\nOctober 6, 2015\n\nI am proud to introduce The Scott Anderson Band, circa 2015! Watch for us at a show near you!\n\nl-r: Jason Thomas, Billy Varnes, Scott Anderson, Gabe Valla, and Lamont Goff\n\nAugust 5, 2015\n\nAmanda and Christian have gotten married and moved off to Birmingham where Amanda has begun dental school at UAB and Christian has a new job in addition to more fiddle gigs, both playing and recording. Amanda will be able to perform on a pretty rare basis. I will continue on with The Scott Anderson Band and has some great shows planned for the fall. Watch out for more news and shows!\n\nYou can check out my latest article on a recent banjo-full trip to North Carolina in Banjo Newsletter here.\n\nMarch 23, 2015\n\nI filled in with Newtown on short notice this past weekend on guitar after their usual player contracted viral meningitis. (He's doing OK!)\n\nKati is an old friend and the whole band is great with great material. It was a blast!\n\nMarch 13, 2015\n\nLast weekend we were lucky enough to be invited to play the Bluegrass on the Beach Festival at Lake Havasu, Arizona with Bud Bierhaus and Eric Uglum and the Vintage Martins. (Eric is Christian's stepdad.) It was a great festival and we had a great time with some borrowed instruments. We even got to jam a little bit in the parking lot!\n\nWe have a private gig next week, and the end of March brings the always popular Suwannee Banjo Camp!\n\nJanuary 8, 2015\n\nHappy New Year! Time for some music!\n\nCome out this Saturday to Music Junction in Alachua, Florida to see our friend and Scott's old boss, Jim Hurst. He will knock your socks off! More info at mato music concerts.

Sadly, Greg passed away on Nov. 9, 2013. I played a lot of music with Greg over quite a few years and we had a lot of good times. And he was a great mandolin player. We miss him."
