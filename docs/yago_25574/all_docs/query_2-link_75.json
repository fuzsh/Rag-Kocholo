        "text": "“Being funny is not only hard but perhaps the most powerful thing of all,” says the author, whose latest book is “Why I Don’t Write: And Other Stories.”\n\nWhat books are on your night stand?\n\nThat would be sprawled on the floor. “Elvis and Gladys,” by Elaine Dundy; “Three of a Kind,” novellas by James M. Cain; “The Paintings of Charles Burchfield”; “The Lost Pianos of Siberia,” by Sophy Roberts; “Abroad: British Literary Traveling Between the Wars,” by Paul Fussell; “100 Years of the Best American Short Stories,” edited by Lorrie Moore and Heidi Pitlor; “The Hat on the Bed,” stories by John O’Hara; “An Alphabet for Gourmets,” by M.F.K. Fisher; “Light Thickens,” by Ngaio Marsh; “Marilyn: Norma Jean,” by Gloria Steinem. I am not at my usual bedside because of the pandemic, but permanently there are the essays of Montaigne, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, plus Laozi’s “Tao Te Ching,” all excellent for steadying reference.\n\nWhat’s the last great book you read?\n\nHave read a few. “Caste,” by Isabel Wilkerson, which shines a stunning light on racial issues from a new angle; “Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory, and the Conquest of Everest,” by Wade Davis, which tracks the extremes of human behavior; “A Judgement in Stone,” by Ruth Rendell, a briskly and entertainingly told story of the evils of illiteracy masquerading as a murder mystery.\n\nAre there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?\n\n“Can You Forgive Her?,” by Anthony Trollope (I listened to the audio), where I was delighted to find some metafictional narrative intrusion in an otherwise conventional narrative."
