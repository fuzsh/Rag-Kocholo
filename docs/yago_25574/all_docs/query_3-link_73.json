        "text": "Gloria J. Miller, age 65 passed away on Friday, June 25, 2021 surrounded by her four adoring children following a long, courageous battle with cancer. “Glo”, to those who loved her most, chose to keep her diagnosis private with the hope that others would remember her at her best. Gloria was born in Detroit, Michigan to the late Grace and James Garvin. She grew up in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and was a graduate of Valley High School. Gloria earned her Bachelor of Arts degree and met the love of her life, David, while attending Penn State University. Together they started a family in Warren, Pennsylvania before later moving to Ravenna, Ohio making countless memories with their children in both cities. Throughout her life, Gloria took great pride in her career. In Pennsylvania, she was a successful realtor and served as President of the Warren County Board of Realtors. After moving to Ohio, she held various professional roles in the insurance industry, most recently working as a Software Analyst with National General Insurance in downtown Cleveland. Gloria enjoyed cooking, baking, decorating, bargain-hunting, traveling (especially to the beach), and spending time with loved ones. Above all else, Gloria will be remembered as someone who used her many creative talents and gifts to make special moments and lasting memories for her family. Gloria will be forever remembered by her devoted children: Janine (Troy) Beros, Michael (Katie) Miller, Nicholas (Wade Rakes) Miller, and Victoria (Patrick) Sweeney. Grammy’s memory will also be cherished by her grandchildren: Everett, Lyla, Jackson, Trenton, and soonto-be Sophia. “Prince”, Gloria’s treasured pet, will continue to be loved and spoiled in her absence. Gloria is survived by her brothers, Larry (Deborah) and James (Doris) Garvin. She will be missed by countless friends and extended family. Gloria was preceded in death by her mother and father, Grace and James Garvin, as well as her mother and father-in-law, Ruth and Paul Miller, and most recently, her beloved husband, David Miller. The family will receive friends from 5:00- 7:00 pm on Thursday, July 1, 2021 at Shorts Spicer Crislip Funeral Home’s Ravenna Chapel with funeral services to follow. Private family burial will take place at the Swedish Union Cemetery in Tidioute, Pennsylvania. The family would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of the medical staff within both the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospital systems for the care that they provided and in lieu of flowers ask that donations be made to the American Cancer Society in the hopes of someday finding a cure.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Gloria J (Garvin) Miller, please visit our floral store."
