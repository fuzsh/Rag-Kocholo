        "text": "I want to inquire about two different actresses.\n\nThe first one is the juvenile actress who played the daughter of the late John Gabrielle on Loving. She must have been a model because during the time that she was on Loving, there was a magazine at the local library which had her on the cover. I think that she was also on a commercial that I frequently saw.\n\nThe second inquiry is about actress Lee Beery. She played a role on Dark Shadows during the final year. This character was the sister of Kate Jackson's character in the 1840 storyline. I have never seen Ms. Beery in any other television or film role. I do know that her husband is Broadway and record arranger and conductor Jonathan Tunick. (I first became familiar with Mr. Tunick when he arranged Send in the Clowns for singer Judy Collins.) He would arrange for the Stephen Sondheim musicals.\n\nI was thinking the other day about actor and singer Rick Ely. He is best known for his role on the prime times series The Young Rebels. I remember that he had played a role on Love of Life.\n\nI looked him up, and I learned that he had also played roles on One Life to Live (Steve Pierpoint #1, which I had probably forgotten about since he was later replaced in the role by the actor married to Judith Light) and also on Texas.\n\nI am wondering what he has been doing since leaving his daytime television roles.\n\nI am wondering about New Orleans native Jennifer Harmon. She played Chris Kirby on How to Survive a Marriage and Cathy Craig on One Life to Live. After a long absence from One Life to Live, she returned to that show playing a different character in a day role (as an attorney).\n\nDoes anyone know what she has done since she appeared in her second One Life to Live role?\n\nI would like to know about actress Chase Crosley. She She\n\nShe played the following daytime roles:\n\nEllen Wilson on NBC's Today Is Ours (1958).\n\nFaye Bannister Koda on NBC's Young Doctor Malone (1962-1963).\n\nJane Fletcher Hayes #2 on CBS's The Guiding Light (1963-1968).\n\nEleanor on CBS's The Secret Storm (1968-1969)\n\nShe was also a temporary substitute for Billie Watt on CBS's Search for Tomorrow.\n\nAccording to Imdb, she is a widow and still living. I wonder what she has been doing since her last acting role. She appeared in a short film in 1994.\n\nYou may have gotten your answer already since it's been 11 months but, if not, she became a holistic practitioner in Bayonne, NJ. The link below is/was her business. Not sure if it's still active as the website looks like it hasn't been updated for about 7 years. Their FB page has a couple of recent(?) posts but is pretty stagnant as well.\n\nhttp://www.walkinhealth.net/home.html"
