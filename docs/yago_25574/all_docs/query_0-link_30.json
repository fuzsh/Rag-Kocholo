        "text": "Fargate Boarding House – Living Room\n\nCeara welcomes Jeremy back and he asks if everything is alright between her and her mother. “Everything went smoothly,” she says, but then as she’s hugging Jeremy, she imagines her father across the room calling her a liar. Jeremy realizes something is wrong and asks what it is.\n\nValley Inn – Adam’s Room\n\nAdam gets a visit from Will, who wants to accept an offer Adam made months earlier for them to join forces against Palmer. Adam laughs in his face, guessing that Palmer kicked him out of Cortlandt Electronics, which makes Will basically useless to him. “Dixie’s future and your son’s are about to be ruined,” Will warns.\n\nWildwind – Drawing Room\n\nDimitri compliments Natalie on how she looks. She calls for Tim and he offers to go with her when she takes Tim to school to make sure no one bothers her. She gratefully accepts, but when Tim walks into the room, he wants to invite Trevor to come to the school’s open house.\n\nChandler Mansion – Drawing Room\n\nTrevor catches Hayley making plans to meet with Brian and tells her that she needs to go to class instead. “I was talking about going after school,” she claims. Brooke walks in just as Hayley is walking out and Trevor gets right to the point, asking her about an article she wrote some time ago about the Marick family. “I need the dirt on Dimitri Marick.”\n\nWildwind – Drawing Room\n\nNatalie turns down Tim’s suggestion and reminds him that they talked about him not trying to arrange for her and Trevor to be places together because she needs time to figure things out. Dimitri asks Tim how he’d feel about him coming to the open house and Tim says it’s fine, but isn’t very enthusiastic about the prospect.\n\nTim asks Natalie when they’re going home and she tells him that things are “complicated.” After Tim leaves the room, Natalie wonders what she’s doing to him by staying at Wildwind instead of going home. Dimitri assures her that she’s doing the right thing, but she’s not sure. “I’m just getting more confused,” she confesses, saying that she thinks she might be overreacting when it comes to Trevor. “Should I give him another chance?” she wonders.\n\nYeah, I’m sure the guy who’s trying to get with you is going to answer that question in a completely honest and unbiased way.\n\nHe encourages her to make a decision and “get out of this holding pattern” and not let Janet’s actions take away her future. “And Trevor?” she wonders. “Break it off now – cleanly – just put an end to it.” He adds that he won’t let her waste years of her life refusing to move forward the way that he did.\n\nChandler Mansion – Drawing Room\n\nTrevor gives Brooke the rundown on why he wants to know about Dimitri, but Brooke offers that from what she’s heard, Dimitri has been treating Natalie well. Too well for Trevor’s liking as he explains that Dimitri is moving in on her.\n\nTrevor blames himself for the situation and thinks that Natalie is suffering from PTSD from being trapped in the well. She’s sympathetic, but wonders if “undermining the one person she trusts right now is the right thing to do? Do you really think that that’s in her best interest?” He thinks that Natalie won’t get any better until she’s back in Pine Valley.\n\nTrevor says that he’s run Dimitri’s name through the police database, talked to people in government, and talked to people at Interpol, and came up empty handed each time. He thinks Brooke might be able to uncover something no one else did, but she tells him that she doesn’t think there’s anything to find. “He’s one of the good guys.” She offers to speak to Natalie since Natalie doesn’t want to see him.\n\nValley Inn – Adam’s Room\n\nWill tells Adam that he’s going to do everything possible to get back at Palmer. “I’ll give you everything you need to bring him down.” Adam doubts that Will is up to the task and suggests that he just get out of town. Will tells him that he should want to participate for Dixie’s sake, warning that Craig Lawson is bad news, but Adam isn’t buying it and just wants Will to get lost. Will thinks Adam is just bitter because he turned down the original offer. “I needed you then; I don’t need you now,” Adam tells him, opening the door to show him out.\n\n“You can’t throw Dixie to the wolves,” Will says.\n\nYes. Adam, a man who once had Dixie institutionalized, is totally going to be moved by an appeal to Dixie’s safety.\n\nAs Will is telling Adam that he’s going to regret this, Dixie walks in.\n\nHospital – Lobby\n\nUnsurprisingly, Hayley did not go to school and is instead at the hospital, taking Brian for a walk around. He asks her to promise that she’ll go straight to school from their visit and Gloria walks over and asks how Brian is doing. Gloria kind of flirts with Brian and Hayley gets pissy and chases her off and Brian calls her out for being jealous.\n\nHe asks Hayley what she got up to the night before, guessing that Adam and Erica were trying to talk her into taking the job at Enchantment, and she reveals that she told them she’d think about taking the job.\n\nValley Inn – Adam’s Room/Wildwind – Drawing Room/Foyer\n\nDixie chastises Will for running straight to Palmer’s enemy to try to make an alliance and Adam assures her that he’s not going to take Will up on his offer. “You’re both going to be sorry when Craig shows his colors,” Will says, leaving.\n\nOnce they’re alone, Dixie says that she just wanted to talk about Adam’s parenting time with Junior. Adam brings the conversation around to Craig and she tells him that, yes, they’re engaged but they’ve decided to wait a year to get married. He asks if she’s sure about the marriage and she gets defensive, stating through gritted teeth that Craig is a wonderful man. Adam tells her that he trusts her judgment, which comes as a surprise to her, and he wishes her happiness.\n\nThey’re interrupted by a phone call from Natalie, who asks Adam to come to Wildwind right away.\n\nAfter she hangs up, Dimitri assures Natalie that she’s doing the right thing.\n\nThe doorbell rings and Helga lets Brooke in and then goes to see if Natalie will receive her.\n\nChandler Mansion – Drawing Room\n\nTrevor waits impatiently and glowers. He picks up the phone, but then thinks better of making the call and hangs up.\n\nWildwind – Drawing Room\n\nNatalie asks Dimitri if he thinks she should see Brooke and then tells Helga to send Brooke away.\n\nFargate Boarding House – Living Room\n\nCeara tells Jeremy that everything is fine, but he gently persists and without much prompting she admits that things have been “strained” with her mother in town, but states that it’s getting better. She tells him that her mother attended a session with Dr. Toland and they worked some things out.\n\nThey’re interrupted by Ceara’s mother, who says she’s glad to get to see Jeremy before leaving town and then heads back to her room to pack. Jeremy tells Ceara that he has to head out to an appointment with “a collector from out of town” and they make plans to meet for dinner later. She tells him that she can’t wait until they’re married and they do some kissing before he heads out the door.\n\nOnce he’s gone, the ghost of her father returns, calling her a “little hypocrite.” He goes on to say that she belongs to him. “Only to me.”\n\nFargate Boarding House – Living Room\n\n“You’re not real, you’re inside my head,” Ceara tells her father. “Dr. Toland told me that I control you. You can’t be here.” Regardless, he just goes on tormenting her and tells her that she’ll always belong to him. “They’d think you were ruined, used, soiled,” he tells her. “To them? You’ll never be clean again. You’ll never be good.” She cries and says it isn’t her fault and sits on the couch, curling up into a ball as he tells her that he loves her, but any other man would think she was “garbage.”\n\nShe tells him to shut up, but he just keeps going on, wondering what kind of a wife she could even be to Jeremy. She pleads with him to stop as he tells her that she’s unfit ever to become someone’s mother. “I can break the cycle,” she says uncertainly. He laughs at her and tells her that she’d be “a lousy mother.” She starts yelling for him to shut up, which finally draws her mother back into the room, wondering who she’s talking to.\n\nHer mother asks if she should call Dr. Toland and Ceara wonders why she would want to do that. “Ceara, you’re talking to nobody.” Ceara says that she’s not crazy.\n\nHunter Gallery\n\nTrisha walks into Jeremy’s gallery and introduces herself, telling Jeremy that she just saw some of his work in New York and it was “marvelous.” She’s effusive in her praise and he’s flattered as she tells him that she wants to add some of his work to the Alden collection.\n\nThey talk about the collection, which is housed at Alden University, and she brings up Giff, whom he knows from their days as students in Paris. Jeremy expresses surprise that Giff has settled down as a professor and then takes her into another room to see more of his work.\n\nHospital – Lobby\n\nHayley and Brian fight because he doesn’t think she should take the job with Enchantment. “I get to be working with Erica Kane. Now she is the coolest of the cool,” she argues. He agrees, but tells her that this whole thing is just a ploy to get her to spend time with Adam. “The man is my father,” she says. “That doesn’t mean you can trust him,” he returns. She thinks that Adam has done a lot lately to prove that she can trust him and starts listing those things off.\n\nThey keep arguing until Ruth comes over to tell Brian that he needs to go back to his room because his doctor is doing rounds. She then adds that Hayley should be in school. “I don’t know why I bothered coming here anyway,” Hayley yells after Brian as she storms out.\n\nWildwind – Drawing Room\n\nHelga shows Adam in and Natalie gets right to the point, asking him if he’d like to buy back his house.\n\nWildwind – Drawing Room\n\nAdam is taken aback by Natalie’s offer and wonders what would happen to Trevor and Hayley in the scenario where he gets the mansion back. “They’ll have to make other arrangements,” she says.\n\nIn an uncharacteristically unselfish move for an Adam who isn’t secretly Stuart pretending to be Adam, he tells Natalie that maybe she shouldn’t be making this decision right now, reminding her that she and Trevor were going to make a life for themselves at the mansion. “Other than yourself, no one was as badly hurt by all this as Trevor,” Adam says. But because this is the early ‘90s and the character in question is a man, no one says that Trevor was raped and instead Adam says that Trevor “deeply regrets” what happened. Natalie is unmoved.\n\n“He’s desperate to have you back,” Adam tells her. Natalie redirects the conversation to whether or not Adam wants to buy his house back. “You’re sure no one is pressuring you?” She responds that Dimitri isn’t influencing her and tells him that if he doesn’t want to buy the house, she’ll put it on the market.\n\nChandler Mansion – Drawing Room\n\nBrooke returns and tells Trevor that she wasn’t allowed to see Natalie. He thanks her for trying and wonders if its hopeless. She tells him not to give up, but he feels like Natalie already has. “When she heals, she’ll come back to you.”\n\nHunter Gallery\n\nTrisha tells Jeremy that she wants to buy two of his paintings, but then they’re interrupted by a call from Gwyneth. Trisha gets on the phone with her mother and assures her that she’s fine and is following doctor’s orders. After getting off the phone, Trisha “reveals” – and I’m using that term loosely because Beck is noticeably pregnant at this point (although Trisha only found out days ago in show time) – that she’s pregnant and confides that people have been driving her crazy with concern over it.\n\nFargate Boarding House – Living Room\n\nCeara denies that anything is wrong and tells her mother that she’s just sensitive to the suggestion that she’s mentally unstable. Her mother blames herself for what happened in the past and Ceara says that she doesn’t need her to feel guilty, she just needs to deal with her own feelings. Her mother offers to stay in Pine Valley, but Ceara insists that she’s fine.\n\nHunter Gallery/Fargate Boarding House – Living Room\n\nTrisha makes a pitch to Jeremy to become AU’s artist in residence for “a month or so.” Jeremy offers to think about it, but tells her that he doesn’t know if it’s a good time for him to leave Pine Valley, citing the fact that he’s about to get married. She offers that Corinth would be a “perfect” place for a honeymoon and he tells her that he’ll discuss it with Ceara and give her an answer later in the day.\n\nMeanwhile, Ceara calls Dr. Toland’s office, but is told she isn’t available. Instead of making an appointment, she says she’ll just keep calling until she gets through. After she hangs up, Jeremy calls and asks her to come over to the gallery.\n\nPark\n\nDixie and Craig make out, but he feels like she’s distracted and asks if she’s thinking about Will. She laments that her brother never learns his lesson and Craig offers that being forced to deal with things on his own will force Will to grow up. She wonders if she and Will can bury the hatchet before the wedding, which she and Craig are planning for Valentine’s Day.\n\nHospital – Lobby\n\nJoe is showing Will out after he’s come by looking for a job at the hospital. Will wonders if this has anything to do with Palmer being a member of the hospital board and Joe tells him that Palmer doesn’t run the hospital, they just don’t have any positions available.\n\nAcross the room, Gloria asks Ruth who the guy is that’s talking to Joe. Moments later, she literally walks into Will as they’re both crossing through the lobby. She introduces herself, but he’s not in a chatty mood and quickly makes his exit.\n\nHunter Gallery\n\nCeara walks in and Jeremy asks how much time she’s getting off for their honeymoon, but she’s not sure. He tells her that he wants them to get married tomorrow.\n\nChandler Mansion – Drawing Room\n\nHayley comes home in a huff and Trevor wonders why she’s not in school. As Hayley is complaining, Adam drops in and tells Trevor that he just came from speaking to Natalie. “She’s absolutely determined never to come back to this house. She wants to cut all ties to her life here.” He adds that Natalie just sold him the house.\n\nWildwind – Drawing Room\n\nNatalie is on cloud nine and tells Dimitri that she feels like she’s getting her life back. She thanks him for giving her the push that she needed. He tells her that he wants her to be happy and then he kisses her.\n\nEpisode Cast:\n\nCraig Lawson – Scott Thompson Baker\n\nBrooke English – Julia Barr\n\nGloria Marsh – Teresa Blake\n\nBrian Bodine – Matt Borlenghi\n\nAdam Chandler – David Canary\n\nNatalie Hunter – Kate Collins\n\nRuth Martin – Mary Fickett\n\nCeara Connor – Genie Francis\n\nTrevor Dillon – James Kiberd\n\nJeremy Hunter – Jean LeClerc\n\nJoe Martin – Ray MacDonnell\n\nDixie Cooney – Cady McClain\n\nDimitri Marick – Michael Nader\n\nHayley Vaughan – Kelly Ripa\n\nWill Cortlandt – James Patrick Stuart"
