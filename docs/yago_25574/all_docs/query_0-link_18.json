        "text": "Unlike Tad and Dixie, Adam and Liza were not the kids with stars in their eyes experiencing the first rush of love. Adam and Liza are... Adam and Liza. For The Liza and Adamaniacs , October 2, 1996 is when it all began. Adam and Liza were lusting after their one-time flames, Brooke and Tad. (Ha! So Tad was helpful at one time in Adam and Liza's relationship!) Adam dutifully squired Liza about Pine Valley, hoping that he would get the sign from Brooke that he was looking for. Liza, on the other hand, wanted some sign from Tad, but she never got one. (Thank heavens!) He was too busy chasing Gloria Marsh around Pine Valley. Adam and Liza pulled several stunts, including Liza making an early morning appearance at Adam's in his robe and Adam winning a bidding war with Brooke over a sculputure. Unbeknownst to both Adam and Liza, Tad and Gloria were taking their relationship (if you could call it that) to the next level. Liza found them the morning after, sending Adam and Liza's plan into hyperdrive. Later that day (I speak in soap time, not real time), Adam proposed to Liza. Liza; however, would not settle for a diamond. She wanted half of her pride and joy, WRCW. Adam was flabbergasted and they later spent a platonic night at the Chandler Estate. The following day, Adam announced their news on The Cutting Edge, but Liza had news of her own: she would get half of WRCW as a wedding present.\n\nBrooke and Tad accepted the news in a mild state of shock, mumbling their congratulatory messages. Liza and Adam were overjoyed and began making preparations for a \"wedding\" at Christmas. They played the happy engaged couple at several instances, most notably Thanksgiving and the death of Hector Santos.\n\nAs Adam tried to plan the wedding, Liza was going insane with the thought of the wedding that would never be. Hoping to get away from it all, she drove away to the country. At the Sleepy Hollow Inn, she met \"Jake.\" Unbeknownst to her, he was Joey Martin... as in Tad's younger brother.\n\nAs Liza and Jerk flirted (Excuse me as I gag) , in Pine Valley, Tad and Adam were sparring, as usual about the women they usually wind up sharing at some point in time. Tad demanded to know why Adam was marrying Liza. Adam countered it was none of his business and to stay as far away from Liza as he possibly could. Tad wanted ammo to break up Adam and Liza. He soon found it in the truth. Adam didn't own WRCW. Stuart did! Tad began a quest to find Liza. She was at the Inn with Jake. Totally unaware that Jake was Joey Martin, she began to develop a thing for this man. Realizing (Thank God!) that this wasn't real, she headed back to the Inn to find Tad sitting on her bed.\n\nWhile Adam-as-Stuart tried to convince Brooke that she should stop the wedding, Tad tried to convince Liza to do the same. Liza thought his sudden urge to tell her to stop the wedding was a romantic overture. He made it clear to her that it was over between them. They were nothing more than friends. Embarrassed, Liza ordered Tad to leave her alone. He obeyed her wish. Liza tried to find Joke, but she didn't. She went home to Pine Valley with an agenda. She spied Adam changing from Stuart-mode. She approached him with an idea: Why not get married the next day? Adam was shocked at first, yet agreed with Liza. The marriage would go on!\n\nAs they made their whirlwind of plans, Tad and Brooke talked about their problem. Tad didn't want to stop it; Brooke was nearly ready when Marian uninvited her to the ceremony. As the hours decreased, the tension increased. Flake showed up at the front door, hoping to convince Liza not to marry Adam. Adam broke her bubble. \"Joey? Joey Martin, is that you?\" Stunned that he hadn't revealed his true identity, Liza decided to still \"marry\" Adam and kicked the idiot out. Later, Liza overheard Stuart and Brooke talking. She told Brooke that Adam was wearing the same sweater Stuart was. Brooke left, realizing that Adam was still up to his old tricks.\n\nAs the New Age ceremony was about to start, Brooke was missing. Adam was, well, adamant about it not starting until Brooke showed. Soon the guests began to arrive, with both Martin brothers in attendance. As the moment of truth approached, Brooke still wasn't in attendance. She was still at the carriage house, reflecting upon her past relationships with Adam. With a little pressure from Adam, Laura called her, wondering where she was. She then decided to show. Adam and Liza, with Skye and Scott as their witnesses, were ready to start the wedding. The room quieted as Brooke entered the room. The wedding was now ready to begin, all the principals were in place. The ceremony started without a peep from Brooke or Tad. As the ceremony progressed, Marian, who had been barred from the ceremony by Liza, watched at the window. Soon it was time for the vows. Adam slipped the ring on Liza's finger -- no reaction from Tad. It was now Liza's turn. She took the ring, and while everyone looked on, she said the two magic words... \"I do.\"\n\nIt was official. Liza was now Mrs. Adam Chandler! Adam was stunned; he hadn't expected her to go through with it.\n\nOn New Year's, Adam and Liza welcomed a new surprise into the Chandler estate -- Marian!\n\nOn April 21, 1997, it was the best possible day for any fan of Adam and Liza. In a stunning turn of events, instead of Liza leaving Adam for Jake, Adam and Liza consummated their marriage. Their marital bliss would be short-lived. Liza woke up, and instead of Adam hearing her murmur his name moments before, he heard her say \"Jake.\" Adam was devastated. He promptly threw divorce papers at Liza and forced her to sign, granting her nothing. Liza was as equally devastated as Adam. While Adam took out his frustrations at WRCW, Liza curled up into a little ball and climbed back into their bed. The door opened. She had hoped it was Adam. It was Jake. He proceeded to accuse Liza of sleeping with Adam for a lucrative divorce -- and for only that reason. While she begged Jake for forgiveness, Adam and Stuart talked. He admitted he had made a fool of himself the night before. Stuart tried to make him see that he loved Liza. When Stuart failed, he left. Liza, on the other hand, was nearly catatonic in bed. Marian found her daughter inconsolable. She found out that Liza and Adam had indeed consummated the marriage, but everything was wrong. She had lost Adam and Jake. Devastated, Liza left her ring at the Chandler Estate and moved into the Valley Inn.\n\nLater that night, Belinda showed up at her room to say that she received divorce papers. Liza admitted to Belinda that she had consummated the marriage, and admitted that she had wanted Adam. Adam was still at Chandler Enterprises, staring at the divorce and alone. Stuart found him, and tried to convince him that he loved Liza and she loved him, despite what had happened. Stuart's attempts were unsuccessful. Marian then showed up and told Adam that Jake had dumped Liza!\n\nIn the meantime, Liza told Belinda that she wanted to try to see if Jake would accept her again. She headed to the Martin residence where she met Jake.\n\nAdam was shocked as Marian told him that Jake dumped Liza. He was stunned, and told Marian so. She then told him to listen in with the little bugging device she had installed days before. He did that.\n\nAt the Martin residence, Liza tried to explain to Jake about her night with Adam. In a desperate effort to win him back, she told Jake that she didn't love Adam, and considered her night with him to be the most \"humilating\n\nOn, perhaps the second saddest day in Liza and Adam's history, Liza signed Adam's divorce. It's official. Adam and Liza, despite their obvious love for each other, parted on Wednesday, March 27, 1998. However, it ain't over til it's over... Adam and Liza have yet to begin!\n\nReturn to The FATAL Page ') } d.write('\n\n\\[x\\]close <\\/span><\\/div>'); if ( width-x>=440 || width>=1425) { d.write('"
