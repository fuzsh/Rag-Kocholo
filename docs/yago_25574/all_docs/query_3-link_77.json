        "text": "Gloria Rosalinda Garcia (Cavazos)\n\nGloria passed away at the age of 99 on February 1, 2024. She was born on December 6, 1924 in San Antonio, Texas, to Santos S. and Maria del Refugio (Gracia) Cavazos. She was the devoted and loving wife to the late Col. Ray Joseph Garcia (USAF, Ret) for 78 years who passed away in November 19, 2023, also at the age of 99 years old.\n\nAs an Air Force officer's wife, Gloria had to organize and move the family frequently, with stays domestically in Texas, South Carolina, Maryland, Massachusetts, Colorado and Virginia and abroad in England, Germany, and Newfoundland Canada, until they chose civilian life in Chester County, Pennsylvania. She was passionate about her family, extremely proud and supportive of her husband and his accomplishments, and of her five children and their scouts, sports and hobbies. She often volunteered at her church food banks, the local hospital, and hosted families from abroad. Locally, Gloria had been a 28-year volunteer for Neighborhood League Shops of Wayne, PA. She regularly gathered clothing and household items for families in need, particularly immigrant Hispanic families while using her childhood Spanish skills. She enjoyed and cared for family pets. We admired and loved her concern for others and she had a love for all animals.\n\nDespite, or because of, her husband’s career as a jet pilot, Gloria disliked flying. As a result, they traveled extensively by Amtrak, including train travel to many U.S. states, Mexico City, and loved local road trips and biannual nearby hotel stays, while always making new friends.\n\nGloria is survived by her children: Louis E. Garcia (Cindy) of Landisville, PA; Gerald A. Garcia (Ninfa) of Holualoa, HI; Marty Garcia (Leota) of Ponte Vedra Beach, FL; Loretta Garcia of Eagleview, PA; and Terri Lee (Jon) of Rancho Mirage, CA; beloved grandchildren: Marina Keizer, Grant L. Garcia, Liana Steindamm, Marla Nora, Jessica LeeLoy, Rebecca Marsh, Paloma Garcia-Lee, Morrall Garcia; 8 great grandchildren; many nieces, nephews, and other extended family and friends.\n\nIn addition to her husband and parents, Gloria was preceded in death by all of her siblings: Celia Cavazos, Minerva Hernandez, Samuel Cavazos, Santos Cavazos, Atanacio Cavazos, Mary Ruth Riley, Ernestine Cordova, Ninfa Beard, and Bernard R. Cavazos.\n\nGloria will be interred at Arlington National Cemetery with her husband at a later date.\n\nThe Garcia family would like to thank all the wonderful caregivers over the years, and Main Line Health HomeCare & Hospice for their loving and professional attention. Memorial contributions in Gloria’s name may be made to your favorite animal rescue."
