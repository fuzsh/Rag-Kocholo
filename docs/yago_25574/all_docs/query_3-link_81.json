        "text": "Valrea Weber passed away in her home June 2, 2023, at the age of 102.\n\nShe is survived by her grandchildren Steven Marsh (Verica), Shari (Keith) Meyers, and Christopher (Michelle) Winkelmann. She was the beloved great grandmother of Nicholas (Samantha) Marsh, Anthony (Elizabeth) Marsh, Ryan Meyers, Elissa Meyers, Gabriella Marsh, Sara Winkelmann and great-great- grandmother of Thomas Marsh.\n\nValrea was preceded in death by all three of her children: Glenda (Charles) nee Lusk, Marsh, Ronald (Pauline) Winkelmann and James (Paulette) Winkelmann. Three husbands preceded her in death: Earl Weber, Lee Winkelmann and Lorenza Lusk. She was a loving mother-in-law, stepmother, cousin, neighbor, friend and inspiration to many people.\n\nBorn Valrea Bowman February 12, 1921 in Portageville, Missouri, Val moved to St. Louis during World War II, following the death of her first husband in an automobile accident. Some of Val’s earliest memories are of picking cotton beside her grandmother Annie Shaver, who raised her when Val lost her mother as a toddler.\n\nVal was a stay-at-home mom while raising her family. In 1968 she joined her husband Lee Winkelmann in his family business, Schultz Door. After completing some bookkeeping classes, she took pride in helping run the business as efficiently as her home. Even after retiring in 1983, she developed a home budget and maintained meticulous financial records in her ledgers. It was one of her passions – family knew it was not advisable to visit on a day the books wouldn’t balance.\n\nIn retirement Val and her third husband Earl Weber enjoyed travel, playing cards with friends and visits to local casinos. Even widowed and living alone, she maintained her books and a budget that always included a modest allotment for some casino outings.\n\nVal was an avid reader, preferring nonfiction books, especially memoirs and biographies. She had a keen interest in politics and world events and many lively discussions took place around her patio table. Exercise played an important part in her life – the hospice nurse had a hard time recently convincing her it was no longer safe to use her treadmill. Family was her treasure. Once shown that her family could send pictures and messages on a smart phone, she embraced the technology. Even better – a playlist could summon her favorite Frank Sinatra songs. Ever frugal, Val immediately ditched her landline.\n\nVal loved her home of more than 60 years in Crestwood and felt blessed to be able to remain there until her death. Videos and visits from her first great- great grandson were a highlight of her final days. She couldn’t take her eyes off little Thomas.\n\nVal was an inspiration to many and truly did it, “My Way.”"
