New Life Associates

New Life Associates is a non-denominational evangelistic and social service organization based in Hyderabad, India. This ministry is evangelical in its theology and inter-denominational in its outreach. It was started by Rev. Dr. Masilamani and his wife Vimala, who were Joseph's parents. Masilamani was a mighty man of God and was given the title “Prince of Preachers” in India. Masilamani went to be with the Lord in 1990 and at that time Joseph Kishore took over the responsibility of carrying this ministry forward with his hard-working wife, Dr. Marie.

On January 20, 2022, Dr. Mariamma (Marie) Joseph passed away at age 67 following a long struggle with diabetes, which included a kidney transplant in April 2021. Please pray for Kishore and his children as they mourn her loss. Her Thanksgiving worship service can be found here.

New Life has now expanded to include radio broadcasts, a TV ministry, medical ministry, pastor and evangelist training and conducting gospel and revival meetings across Hyderabad and India. One recent achievement is the construction of the New Life Ministry Centre, comprising Trinity Community Church, Emory Hospital, Masilamani Conference Center, offices, guest rooms, a TV studio and residences. This ministry center assists New Life in continuing to preach the saving gospel of Jesus Christ to millions; teach the Word of God to tens of thousands of Christians; train more pastors and evangelists; provide loving medical care to the poor and needy; and take up various projects to help the elderly and the orphan children.
