        "text": "German pastor\n\nWolfgang Max Wilhelm Roth (1 October 1930 – 24 November 2013), also known as W. M. W. Roth, was a German pastor[3] of the United Church of Canada and an Old Testament scholar with major contribution to the growth of Old Testament scholarship for more than half a century from 1959 through 2013. Roth was a scholar in the line of Gerhard von Rad acknowledging the influence[4] of the master-specialist of Old Testament ever since his study days at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. Roth's writings drew the attention of the world of Old Testament scholarship through his writings which began appearing in journals like Catholic Biblical Quarterly, Journal of Biblical Literature, Vetus Testamentum, theological commentaries and other theological treatises.\n\nStudies\n\n[edit]\n\nGermany\n\n[edit]\n\nInitial graduate studies were undertaken by Roth at the Universities[2] of Tübingen, Heidelberg, and Marburg.[2] Roth acknowledges the inspiration of Gerhard von Rad,[4] his Professor at Heidelberg.\n\nCanada\n\n[edit]\n\nRoth studied for postgraduate and doctoral degrees at Emmanuel College under the Old Testament Professor Robert Dobbie.[4] During Roth's study days in 1953[5] at the college in Toronto, he happened to be a companion of A. B. Masilamani, the Indian lyric writer who was studying at the college in 1952.[6] In their later years, both Roth and Masilamani happened to teach at seminaries in India affiliated to the Senate of Serampore College (University). While Roth began teaching from 1959 onwards at the Leonard Theological College, Jabalpur, Masilamani was already on the faculty of a seminary located further south at the Baptist Theological Seminary, Kakinada.\n\nProfessorship\n\n[edit]\n\nLeonard Theological College, Jabalpur, India\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 1959 to 1967 Roth taught Old Testament at the Leonard Theological College, Jabalpur, which is affiliated with the Senate of Serampore College (University).\n\nGarrett–Evangelical Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1967, Roth moved to the Garrett–Evangelical Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois where he began teaching Old Testament. He was the Frederick Carl Eiselen Professor of Old Testament Interpretation from 1981 until his retirement in 1996. The Seminary continued to keep Roth under its teaching faculty and designated him as Professor Emeritus from 1996 onwards. Roth continued to teach at the Seminary until his death in 2013.\n\nWritings\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks authored\n\n[edit]\n\n1965, Numerical Sayings in the Old Testament: A Form-Critical Study[4]\n\n1968, Old Testament Theology.[7]\n\n1988, Hebrew Gospel: Cracking the Code of Mark[8]\n\n1988, Isaiah[9]\n\nBooks co-authored/edited\n\n[edit]\n\n1966 (with H.
