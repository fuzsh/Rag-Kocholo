        "text": "Characterization of allergen-specific T cells is critical to understand their contribution to disease pathogenesis. The identification of immunodominant T-cell epitopes is crucial for development of T-cell-based vaccines. Peptide-specific T-cell proliferation studies are usually performed in a library of short synthetic peptides (15mer or 20mer) with 3 or 5 offset spanning the entire length of the allergen. T-cell peptide epitopes lack the primary and tertiary structure of the native protein to cross-link IgE, but retain the ability to stimulate T cells. The peptides sequences can also be obtained either by in silico approaches and in vitro binding assays. The efficacy of T-cell epitope-based peptide immunotherapy has been proven in certain allergies. The present methodology describes T-cell proliferation assays using whole blood sample from allergic subjects.\n\nTY - CHAP\n\nT1 - T-cell proliferation assay\n\nT2 - Determination of immunodominant T-cell epitopes of food allergens\n\nAU - Masilamani, Madhan\n\nAU - Pascal, Mariona\n\nAU - Sampson, Hugh A.\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: Â© Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2017.\n\nPY - 2017\n\nY1 - 2017\n\nN2 - Characterization of allergen-specific T cells is critical to understand their contribution to disease pathogenesis.
