        "text": "Seminary in Telangana, India\n\nThis article is about UGC-recognised undergraduate courses (for the Clergy) and diploma, undergraduate and master's courses (for the Laity) offered by ACTC. For UGC-recognised master's courses (for the Clergy) specializing in Religion and Sacred Scripture, see Advanced Institute for Research on Religion and Culture.\n\nAndhra Christian Theological College (ACTC) is a seminary[2] in Telangana which was founded in 1964.[3] It is affiliated with India's first[4] university, the Senate of Serampore College (University) (a university under section 2(f) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956),[5][6] and has degree-granting authority under a Danish charter ratified by the government of West Bengal.[7] ACTC is on the Hussain Sagar canal (north) in Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the Secunderabad Junction railway station.[8]\n\nThe college was founded on the Lutheran Theological College campus in Rajahmundry and the founding societies included[9][10] the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Church of South India, the Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars, the Methodist Church in India and the South Andhra Lutheran Church. The Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches held its B.D. classes at ACTC in 1967, and in 1972 the B.D. programme of the Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary was integrated into the college. When M. Victor Paul was principal (1991–1993), Good Samaritan Evangelical Lutheran Church joined the college.[11][12][10]\n\nChristian missions in Andhra Pradesh[13] opened seminaries in Gooty (Union Theological Seminary),[14] Dornakal (Andhra Union Theological College,[15] for the Church of South India), Ramayapatnam (Baptist Theological Seminary, for the American Baptists), Luthergiri[16] (Lutheran Theological College), Kakinada (Baptist Theological Seminary, for Canadian Baptists) and Shamshabad (Mennonite Brethren Centenary Bible College, for the Anabaptists). Although professors were exchanged among the seminaries, Bachelor of Divinity students attended Serampore College in West Bengal.\n\nParticipating ecclesiastical societies\n\n(in reverse alphabetical order)\n\nMethodist\n\nMethodist Church in India (MCI); 1964[9]\n\nLutheran\n\nSouth Andhra Lutheran Church (SALC); 1964[9]\n\nGood Samaritan Evangelical Lutheran Church (GSELC); 1992\n\nAndhra Evangelical Lutheran Church (AELC); 1964[9]\n\nBaptist\n\nSamavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches (STBC); 1972[17]\n\nConvention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars (CBCNC); 1964[9]\n\nAnglican, Congregational, Presbyterian and Wesleyan Methodist: the SPG, WMMS, LMS, ABCFM, CMS and the Church of England\n\nChurch of South India (CSI); 1964[9]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nKretzmann Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nACTC constituted the Kretzmann Commission in 1969,[18] consisting of:\n\nM. L. Kretzmann, D.D., secretary for planning, study and research of the Lutheran World Federation's Department of World Missions\n\nK. Devasahayam, M.A., B.D. (Hon.), S.T.M., Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church\n\nA. B. Masilamani, M.A., Th.M., Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars\n\nC. S. Sundaresan, bishop of the Church of South India's Diocese of Rayalaseema\n\nThe commission's report, presented to the board of governors, suggested increasing the Bachelor of Divinity curriculum and abolishing the Licentiate in Theology programme.\n\nMerger\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1964, the college was founded in Luthergiri, Rajahmundry, East Godavari with the merger of three[20] theological colleges:[21] Andhra Union Theological College in Dornakal, Baptist Theological Seminary in Kakinada,[22] and Lutheran Theological College in Rajahmundry.[22]\n\nWith William D. Coleman as its first principal, the college was dedicated on 1 July[23] 1964 by R. M. Clark[23] of the BTESSC.[a] The inaugural address was delivered by Senate of Serampore College registrar C. Devasahayam in Rajahmundry.[24]\n\nThe Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary was a separate part of the college in Rajahmundry until it merged in 1972.[12][23][11] By 1973, the college had moved from Rajahmundry to Secunderabad due to pollution from nearby paper mills.[25] The new buildings were dedicated by Church of South India bishop Pereji Solomon in the presence of Catholic archbishop Samineni Arulappa and seminarians from St. John's Regional Seminary.[26] During the 1990s, the college's postal address changed to Hyderabad (now in Telangana).\n\nAdministration and faculty\n\n[edit]\n\nBoard of governors\n\n[edit]\n\nSuccession of Old Testament faculty\n\nat ACTC, Secunderabad (Telangana)\n\nW.

D. Coleman, the college's first principal, explained the hall system: \"Each of the participating denominations has its own 'hall'. There are two hours of instruction each week about the liturgy, history, and policy of each denomination\".[53]\n\nThe churches commonly associated with Protestantism in southern India include the Anglicans, Congregationalists, Wesleyan Methodists, Baptists, Lutherans and Methodists. Each church has its own tradition. At ACTC, students learn their respective church doctrine in addition to general theology.[54]\n\nPrincipals\n\n[edit]\n\nThe principal serves a four-year term (2022-2026), with each participating church having an opportunity to provide a principal. The current principal is the Rev. T. Swami Raju, D.Th. (Serampore).\n\nTerm Years Church Society Denomination Principals Domicile 1964–1972 8 AELC Lutheran W. D.
