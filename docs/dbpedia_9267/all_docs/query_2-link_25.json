        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency that would benefit from a systematic investigation of molecular alterations in patients to predict outcomes for improving clinical care. Currently, no conclusive cytokine-based treatments exist, although there are indications that targeted therapy could improve outcomes. Although interleukin (IL)-6 elevation has been associated with severe disease, its predictive capacity for clinical outcomes is poor. IL-6 receptor blockers such as tocilizumab have shown conflicting results in clinical trials,1, 2, 3 and have suggested substantial benefits of IL-6 blockade in select patients; however, we have no ability to identify these patients clinically. Similarly, IL-1 blockade with high-dose anakinra in patients with COVID-19 has shown inconsistent results.4 Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors have been associated with less severe clinical phenotypes but clinical trial data are sparse.5 Lenzilumab has shown promise as a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhibitor, whereas otilimab failed to show similar benefit.6 Ultimately, all of these results point to diverse inflammatory phenotypes that need to be better understood to individualise therapy.\n\nEvidence before this study\n\nCytokine storm has been shown to be associated with severe COVID-19, and proinflammatory cytokines have been suggested as markers. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published from Jan 1, 2020, to Jan 31, 2022, without any language restrictions. We used keywords including “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “multi-omics”, “cytokines”, “lipidomics”, “metabolomics”, “proteomics”, “predictive biomarker”, and “machine learning”. Many articles reported proinflammatory cytokines of the innate immune response, such as interleukin(IL)-1, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor, among cytokines and chemokines measured in plasma or serum as early markers of unfavourable outcomes. At least six recent studies focused on measuring the concentrations of hundreds of circulatory proteins, and six studies profiled lipids or metabolites in smaller cohorts (n<100). Only three studies included an integrated multiomics analysis of proteins, lipids, and metabolites across samples, although they had an inadequate number of controls, sampled patients at different stages of hospitalisation, and did not include severity criteria.\n\nAdded value of this study\n\nTo our knowledge, this study of 637 individuals, including 455 samples from patients positive for COVID-19 at different levels of severity as defined by the WHO ordinal scores of clinical improvements, represents the largest profiling of plasma samples from such a population. Coupling multiomics analysis with a machine-learning-based stratification revealed an early signature of COVID-19 severity that was validated in a held-out dataset. Our study led to the discovery of multiomic signatures in the early course of disease that are better predictors of adverse outcomes than the classic cytokine storm panel of cytokines.\n\nImplications of all the available evidence\n\nAvailability of deep, unbiased profiling data using multiomic platforms is crucial for the discovery of predictors of disease severity. Along with existing markers, these novel markers could lead to better management of patients and reduce mortality of COVID-19.\n\nWe sought to combine concentrations of specific cytokines with other omics data for an individualised approach to predict outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Several studies have investigated cytokine, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic changes.7, 8, 9, 10, 11 However, only a few have combined a multiomics approach with machine learning for an integrated analysis.10, 11 Notably, although some potential markers for COVID-19 have been suggested, they suffer from several limitations: small sample sizes (<100 participants in most studies); plasma samples that have been collected after hospital admission or after occurrence of serious clinical outcomes; group comparisons without adequate controls or without mild COVID-19 cases; disparate definitions of severity; and participants without matched samples before COVID-19 infection. In this study, we aim to develop a machine learning-based prediction model to discover a signature predictive of severe disease in patients with COVID-19.\n\nResults\n\nOf the 455 patients who tested positive with COVID-19 between April 14, 2020, and Dec 1, 2020, 272 (60%) were admitted to hospital and 183 (40%) were outpatients ( ). 182 age-matched and sex-matched uninfected individuals from the Mayo Clinic Biorepository were used as controls.12 Plasma samples from COVID-19 outpatients were obtained between 0 and 48 days (median 33 days [IQR 8–33]) after their first positive PCR test. For patients with severe COVID-19, plasma samples were collected between 0 and 18 days (median 2 days [0–5]), and for patients with critical COVID-19, between 0 and 47 days (median 3 days [1–7]). The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR 3–7) for the patients with severe COVID-19 and 11 days for those with critical COVID-19 (IQR 8–25). A total of 1463 unique proteins, 902 lipids, and 1018 metabolites were analysed (appendix 1 pp 6, 8; appendix 2). Network analysis revealed enriched biological pathways and processes associated with severity and the results are summarised in appendix 1 (pp 6, 9–10, 17–18).\n\nUsing AutoGluon's tabular prediction algorithm, we generated a signature of 102 markers (53 proteins, 12 lipids, and 37 metabolites; ; appendix 1 p 15). Two baseline models were built for comparison; one using only IL-6 and the other using the cytokine storm panel of cytokines. A model built using all markers (protein, lipid, and metabolite markers) outperformed the baseline models in the held-out test dataset (ie, IL-6 and cytokine storm panel; p<0·0010), showing the superiority of the additional molecules profiled in this multiomics analysis over other established cytokines for predicting severity (appendix 1 pp 7, 16). A list of cytokine storm cytokines are shown in and details on how the model can be used for new data is described in appendix 1 (p 6).\n\nTable 2\n\nCategoryImportance scoreLinoleamideMetabolite0·0793Leukotriene A4 hydrolaseCytokine0·0500OleamideMetabolite0·0440Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 19 KRT19Cytokine0·0360C-C motif chemokine 7Cytokine0·0273HemeMetabolite0·0227V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 4 VSIG4Cytokine0·02135-methyluridineMetabolite0·0167Interleukin-15Cytokine0·0160Galectin-4Cytokine0·0133LactateMetabolite0·012Prostaglandin-H2 D-isomeraseCytokine0·0093C-X-C motif chemokine 9Cytokine0·0087Integrin alpha-VCytokine0·008LeucylglycineMetabolite0·008Odorant-binding protein 2bCytokine0·008Prolow-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1Cytokine0·00732,6-dihydroxy-benzoic acidMetabolite0·0073Phosphatidylcholine (16:0/20:1)Lipid0·0067EicosanedioateMetabolite0·006DocosadienoateMetabolite0·006Bilirubin (E,Z or Z,E)Metabolite0·0060Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 18Cytokine0·006γ-glutamylisoleucineMetabolite0·006Dipeptidase 1Cytokine0·006Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6Cytokine0·0064-aminophenol sulfateMetabolite0·006Phosphatidylethanolamine (P-18:1/18:1)Lipid0·0053Chymotrypsin-CCytokine0·0053Membrane primary amine oxidaseCytokine0·0053γ-glutamylthreonineMetabolite0·0053Integrin beta-6Cytokine0·0053GlucoseMetabolite0·0053Kallikrein-10Cytokine0·0053PE(O-16:0/18:1)Lipid0·0047AcetoacetateMetabolite0·0047Cathepsin BCytokine0·0047Diacylglycerol (18:1/18:2)Lipid0·0047Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 5Cytokine0·0047Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5Cytokine0·0047ICOS ligandCytokine0·00474-hydroxychlorothalonilMetabolite0·0047Centrosomal protein of 85 kDaCytokine0·0047Serpin B5Cytokine0·0047T-cell surface glycoprotein CD1cCytokine0·0047HeneicosapentaenoateMetabolite0·0047Glycoprotein hormones alpha chainCytokine0·0047Neurotrophin-4Cytokine0·0047Ras-related protein Rab-6ACytokine0·0047Epithelial cell adhesion moleculeCytokine0·0040Dipeptidyl peptidase 2Cytokine0·0040EicosapentaenoateMetabolite0·0040Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily A member 5Cytokine0·0040Calcineurin subunit B type 1Cytokine0·0040Androstenediol (3α, 17α) monosulfateMetabolite0·0040ArachidonateMetabolite0·0040δ-carboxyethyl hydroxychroman oMetabolite0·0040Cortolone glucuronideMetabolite0·0040Carnitine of C10H14O2Metabolite0·0040C-type lectin domain family 6 member ACytokine0·0040TheobromineMetabolite0·0040CysteineMetabolite0·00402-hydroxydecanoateMetabolite0·0033Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (18:1)Lipid0·0033Triacylglycerol 55:7-fatty acid 20:3Lipid0·0033Integrin beta-1Cytokine0·0033PE(O-16:0/22:6)Lipid0·0033Dual oxidase 2Cytokine0·0033RetbindinCytokine0·0033Alpha-L-iduronidaseCytokine0·0033N-methylpipecolateMetabolite0·00334-hydroxyphenylpyruvateMetabolite0·0033Hemoglobin subunit theta-1Cytokine0·0033Phosphatidylinositol (18:0/20:3)Lipid0·0033PhenylacetylcarnitineMetabolite0·0033Alpha-amylase 2BCytokine0·0033Cadherin-6Cytokine0·0033UrsodeoxycholateMetabolite0·0033Phospholipase A2 group XVCytokine0·0027Protein GOLM2Cytokine0·0027PentadecanoateMetabolite0·0027Retinoic acid receptor responder protein 2Cytokine0·0027Angiopoietin-2Cytokine0·0027C-X-C motif chemokine 11Cytokine0·0027Pancreatic alpha-amylaseCytokine0·0027Carbonic anhydrase 1Cytokine0·0027Neuropilin-1Cytokine0·002Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor associated 2Cytokine0·002Nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3Cytokine0·002ArabinoseMetabolite0·002Diacylglycerol (16:1/20:4)Lipid0·0023-methyl catechol sulfateMetabolite0·002TBC1 domain family member 5Cytokine0·002TAG56:6-FA18:3Lipid0·002Dihydroceramide (18:1)Lipid0·002SebacateMetabolite0·002EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing protein 4BCytokine0·002Hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, mitochondrialCytokine0·002Cysteinyl-glycine, oxidizeMetabolite0·002Trizma acetateMetabolite0·002Phosphatidylethanolamine (16:0/20:4)Lipid0·002Cysteinylglycine disulfideMetabolite0·002\n\nMachine learning and individual statistical analysis identified several proteins that were significantly different between the severity groups. Cytokines associated with cytokine storm and macrophage activation syndromes showed an expected association with disease severity; concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), TNF, and interferon (IFN)-γ were positively associated with disease severity ( ). IL-10 and IL-1β did not show such an association. Several other cytokines and chemokines were positively associated with severity, including C-C motif chemokine 7 (CCL7), C-X-C motif chemokines 9, 10 and 11 (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11), IL-15, azurocidin (AZU1) and midkine (MDK; ). Markers of apoptosis, including caspase-1 (CASP1) and TNF receptor superfamily member 10A (TNFRSF10A), were higher in patients with greater severity of disease ( ). There were decreased concentrations of TNF ligand superfamily member 10 (TNFSF10), TNF ligand superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11), and ICOS ligand (ICOSLG) in patients with greater severity of disease ( ). Increased concentrations of apoptotic marker prolow-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 4 (VSIG4), which are involved in the complement pathway, were both associated with greater severity (appendix 1 p 11). The concentrations of haematopoietic mediators including macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), and interleukin-5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5Rα) were also higher in patients with greater disease severity ( ). Concentrations of glycan-binding molecules C-type lectin domain family 6 member A (CLEC6A), sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 5 (SIGLEC5), and galectin-9 (LGALS9) were positively associated with severity, and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 7 (GALNT7) were negatively associated with severity ( ; appendix 1 p 11). Increased concentrations of heparan sulfate glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1 (HS3ST3B1) and syndecan-1 (SDC1), both related to proteoglycans, were associated with greater severity (appendix 1 p 11). Among cell surface receptors, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD1c (CD1C) and integrin alpha-V (ITGAV) were negatively associated with severity, and leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily A member 5 (LILRA5), lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG3) and macrophage-capping protein (CAPG) were positively associated ( ; appendix 1 p 11). Increased levels of keratin, type I cytoskeletal 19 (KRT19) was associated with greater severity, but cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and cartilage acidic protein 1 (CRTAC1) were downregulated with increasing disease severity ( ; appendix 1 p 11). Concentrations of leukotriene A-4 hydrolase (LTA4H), and matrilysin (MMP7) were higher in the severe and critical cohorts than in outpatients, and kallikrein-13 (KLK13) was lower in the severe and critical cohorts than in outpatients. Prokineticin-1 (PROK1), angiopoietin-related protein 1 (ANGPTL1), and ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EPHB4), which are associated with vascular remodelling, were positively associated ( ; appendix 1 p 11). Calcitonin (CALCA) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1) were higher in the severe and critical cohorts than in outpatients, whereas cadherin-6 (CDH6) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were lower in the severe and critical cohorts than in outpatients ( ; appendix 1 p 11).\n\nAn overview of the relative abundance of 14 classes of lipids across disease severity categories is shown in appendix 1 (p 12). Although the abundance of classes such as diglycerides remained unchanged across the groups, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, ether phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol were lower in the hospitalised patients than in the outpatients ( ). Among the 102 predictive biomarkers of COVID-19 severity, 12 were lipids. Individual statistical analysis identified several species of phospholipids that were attenuated in hospitalised participants including lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0), phosphatidylcholine (14:0/20:3), phosphatidylcholine (16:0/20:1), ether phosphatidylethanolamine (P-18:1/18:2), ether phosphatidylethanolamine (P-18:1/18:1), ether phosphatidylethanolamine (O-16:0/22:6), phosphatidylinositol (18:0/20:3), and phosphatidylinositol (18:1/18:1). In contrast to a general decrease in phospholipids with increasing levels of disease severity, concentrations of select species of ceramides, including ceramides (16:0) and ceramides (18:0), were increased in hospitalised participants ( ).\n\nIndividual statistical analysis uncovered metabolites that showed significant elevation in hospitalised patients compared with outpatients including heme, N,N,N-trimethyl-alanylproline betaine (TMAP), 3-ureidopropionate, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and polyamine metabolites N(‘1)-acetylspermidine and N1,N12-diacetylspermine. Several metabolites related to the host gut microbiome were also significantly associated with disease severity; hospitalised patients were associated with decreased concentrations of ursodeoxycholate and 2-hydroxyodecanoate (a medium-chain fatty acid), and increased concentrations of a histidine-derived metabolite, imidazole propionate ( ).\n\nTo analyse cellular mRNA expression of predictive cytokine markers, we identified three publicly-available studies in which cells isolated from patients with COVID-19, who had disease ranging from mild to severe, were profiled by RNA sequencing.13, 14, 15 We observed a similar upregulation on the basis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data in the severe group for 17 proteins that were identified from our cytokine analysis ( ; appendix 1 pp 12–13). Details of upregulated genes are in appendix 1 (p 6).\n\nDetails of the 21 patients whose pre-COVID-19 plasma samples were available and used for proteomics and glycoproteomics analysis are in appendix 1 (p 14). 472 proteins and 732 glycopeptides were quantified in all 21 patients ( ). The abundance values of the glycopeptides were used to calculate the ratio of post-COVID-19 glycopeptides to pre-COVID-19 glycopeptides for each patient. These ratios were then compared between the three groups (outpatients, patients with severe COVID-19, and patients with critical COVID-19) and one-way ANOVA was done, which identified 114 glycopeptides (derived from 62 glycosylation sites of 47 glycoproteins; p<0·05) that were significantly different between the groups ( ). Glycosylation was found to be decreased on Asn1523, Asn3465, and Asn3595 of apolipoprotein B-100 and on Asn402 of afamin ( ). Overall, protein concentrations of these molecules were reduced in post-COVID-19 samples when compared with pre-COVID-19 samples in patients with severe and critical disease but not in outpatients. Additionally, one glycopeptide of haptoglobin (Asn211) with a composition of Hex9HexNAc7NeuAc3 was not altered in outpatients but elevated in patients with severe disease and in patients with critical disease ( ). The distribution of total haptoglobin and its glycopeptides (Asn207 and Asn241) is shown in and appendix 1 (p 14). Sialylated complex-type glycan containing glycopeptides derived from β-2-glycoprotein 1 (APOH; ) and kininogen-1 (appendix 1 p 14) were significantly decreased in patients with critical COVID-19 and kininogen-1 Asn72 was increased (appendix 1 p 14). Protein concentrations of α-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1) were significantly elevated in patients who were admitted to hospital.\n\nWe used 24 paired samples to do an expanded multiomics profiling and this paired analysis allowed us to examine how various molecules were altered in these individuals following infection. Notably, most molecules followed the patterns observed in the design described above, including IL-6, TNF, and LTA4H (ie, in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, these molecules were found in higher concentrations in the post-COVID-19 cohorts than in the pre-COVID-19 cohorts; ). Following COVID-19, CRTAC1 was significantly decreased in patients with critical disease, and non-significantly decreased in patients with severe disease. Reduced concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and ether phosphatidylethanolamine species were observed in hospitalised patients following COVID-19, supporting the association of these lipids with severe and critical COVID-19 outcomes ( ). Metabolites including heme, ursodeoxycholate, 3-ureidopropionate, and TMAP across the matched samples also showed a similar trend of changes as observed in the cross-sectional analysis ( ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this study of 637 individuals, which included 455 patients with COVID-19 at different levels of severity, represents the largest profiling of COVID-19 plasma samples using an integrative multiomics approach to date, using an integrative multiomics approach. Additionally, we present data from a unique collection of 24 patients with COVID-19 for whom matched pre-COVID-19 plasma samples were available. We report predictive biomarkers of severity in COVID-19. We saw that several molecules associated with the cytokine storm syndrome were associated with severity, as expected, including IL-6.10, 11 Other markers of systemic immune response, including CSF1, IL-5Rα, and IL-15 showed a similar association. We also identified additional plasma protein markers that have been implicated in inflammation, apoptosis, and other important cellular processes, including several that have not previously been described in the context of COVID-19. SIGLEC5, which has been hypothesised to be involved in the ligation of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein with CD33, was elevated in patients with severe and critical COVID-19.16 The elevated concentrations of CLEC6A, CCL7, AZU1, CAPG, and LILRA5 in these hospitalised patients are suggestive of the innate immune response associated with severity. Elevated CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, which are secreted by chemotactically activated immune cells, are indicative of strong interferon-mediated responses.17 LAG3 and LGALS9, involved in lymphocyte function, were elevated in the severe and critical groups; ICOSLG, however, was reduced. Although proinflammatory enzyme LTA4H was high in patients with severe and critical disease, VSIG4, a phagocytic receptor with anti-inflammatory effects, also showed a positive association with severity; this is a novel association that we report.18 Patients with severe and critical outcomes showed elevated concentrations of apoptotic markers TNFRSF10A and FAS, but concentrations of TNFSF10 and TNTFSF11 were reduced in these groups. Interestingly, COMP, a known biomarker of osteoarthritis and suppressor of apoptosis, was downregulated in patients with severe and critical disease.\n\nSDC1, a proteoglycan, known to be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis, was elevated in patients with severe and critical COVID-19. MDK, a cytokine and growth factor, was also elevated in these groups, along with one of its interactors, LRP1. CD1C, a T-cell surface glycoprotein, was negatively associated with severity; this is consistent with a 2020 report that CD1C+ T cells preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19.19 MMP7, which has been reported to be elevated in patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection who previously needed admission to intensive care, was elevated in patients with severe and critical COVID-19.20 CRTAC1 was negatively associated with severity; this might be indicative of the poor health status of alveolar type-2 epithelial cells in patients with severe COVID-19 as has been previously described in the context of interstitial lung disease.11, 21 Angiogenesis-related proteins were elevated in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, including VEGFA and ANGPTL1, along with EPHB4 and dimethylarginase-1 (DDAH1; a promoter of nitric oxide biosynthesis and angiopoiesis); this is in keeping with previous studies that describe vascular angiogenesis as an important feature of COVID-19.22 Consistent with previous reports of consumption of components of the coagulation system,23 KLK13 concentrations were downregulated in patients with severe and critical COVID-19.\n\nWe found differences in the concentrations of several lipid classes between patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and outpatients with COVID-19. In contrast to our finding of decreased concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholine in hospitalised patients, previous studies have reported increased lysophosphatidylcholine in patients with COVID-19.7, 8 Although lysophosphatidylcholine has been reported as a proinflammatory mediator in the past, a 2020 study questioned whether lysophosphatidylcholine exerts anti-inflammatory and vasoprotective roles.24 Also, decreased lysophosphatidylcholine has been reported in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.24 Most importantly, lysophosphatidylcholine inhibits the release of IL-6; thus, decreased lysophosphatidylcholine in hospitalised patients corresponds with increased IL-6 in these patients.25 In addition to reduction of lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine was also found to be decreased in hospitalised patients, consistent with other studies.7, 8 Plasmalogen ether phosphatidylethanolamine is known to possess antioxidant properties and its reduction in hospitalised patients suggests increased oxidative stress.26 Phosphatidylinositol acts as an antiviral mediator and it has been reported to attenuate infection in respiratory syncytial virus.27 As an inhibitor of IL-8, phosphatidylinositol suppresses infection and viral propagation.27 Decreased phosphatidylinositol is in line with elevated IL-8 in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Reduced ether phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol could be suggestive of induced oxidative stress and poorly controlled viral propagation in hospitalised patients. Select species of ceramides were increased in hospitalised patients; elevated ceramide is related to pulmonary cell apoptosis and emphysema-like disease and reduced ceramide protects against oxidative stress.28 Notably, increased serum ceramides have been described in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2.7\n\nSeveral metabolite predictors of COVID-19 severity were also discovered. High concentrations of heme in patients admitted to hospital is consistent with reports that SARS-CoV-2 causes elevation of free heme.29 TMAP, a marker of reduced kidney function, showed a positive association with increasing severity, which supports findings from a 2021 study that reported the same trend in patients with severe disease.30 Polyamines facilitate virus replication by aiding cellular attachment; the increased polyamine concentrations in hospitalised patients might indicate increased disease severity.31 We discovered accumulation of 3-ureidopropionate, a metabolite in pyrimidine metabolism, in the severe and critical cohorts. 3-ureidopropionate increases reactive oxygen species and inhibits complex V.32 Anosmia has been reported by patients with COVID-19 and 3-ureidopropionate is a precursor of β alanine, which is required for the synthesis of carnosine that protects the olfactory sensory neurons and sustentacular cells.32 Olfactory sensory neurons are damaged during infection with SARS-CoV-2, causing anosmia; thus, we speculate that inhibition of complex V by 3-ureidopropionate might be related to damaged neurons and anosmia. Our results reflected the alteration of the gut microbiome in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 2-hydroxydecanoate exerts anti-viral properties and has been known to inhibit the viral replications;33 its decrease in hospitalised patients corresponds with severe infection. Antioxidant ursodeoxycholate, an important bile acid in SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties that can inhibit proinflammatory cytokine storm, was decreased with increasing disease severity, supporting its negative association with cytokine storm.34\n\nAPOH, known to drive hepatitis virus retention by direct interaction and induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, was reduced in patients with severe and critical disease for whom paired pre-COVID-19 samples were analysed.35 Kininogen-1, which plays an important role in prekallikrein-kinin axis, was also reduced. ORM1, however, was increased; this is the first demonstration in the context of COVID-19. The glycosylation levels of APOB were reduced in hospitalised patients; interestingly, N-glycosylation mutant APOB in liver has been known to lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress and insulin resistance, suggesting glycosylation of APOB is important for its sustained function.36\n\nOur study revealed novel molecules including cytokines, lipids, and metabolites as predictive biomarkers of severe and critical outcomes after COVID-19 infection. Importantly, these markers were found to be altered early in the course of the disease, before or around the time of hospital admission, suggesting a close link between inflammation and adverse outcomes. The markers described in this study improved the accuracy of prediction of COVID-19 severity over the classic cytokine storm panel of cytokines. For example, although previous studies have suggested IL-6 and TNF concentrations in plasma as predictors of COVID-19 severity, our study identified a multiomic signature of 102 analytes that perform better than them.\n\nEven though this is a retrospective study, the samples were drawn at the baseline when the patients had typically not yet reached that worst outcome. Although we discovered potentially predictive markers, they do not necessarily imply causation. The number of biomarkers collected was greater than the size of our cohort, which can lead to concerns of overfitting. However, the sophisticated AutoGluon modelling approach avoided overfitting as evidenced by our high accuracy in the held-out test set. Without an external dataset, our study could not evaluate whether these models would extend to cohorts that are not well represented by the Mayo Clinic population and this remains a major limitation of the study. We are also limited by the changing nature of treatments and the disease itself over the course of the pandemic, offering a group of confounders that cannot be remedied in a retrospective design."
