        "text": "Chapter IV: SOCIAL INFLUENCES <strong>4.1.2.2</strong> _____________________________________________ <strong>Caste</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Denom<strong>in</strong>ation</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Andhra</strong> <strong>Christianity</strong> It is a fact that different denom<strong>in</strong>ations or different churches of the same denom<strong>in</strong>ation ( t h e r e a r e f o r i n s t a n c e t h r e e d i f f e r e n t L u t h e r a n C h u r c h e s i n A n d h r a P r a d e s h ) d o n o t j o i n because they fear problems on the basis of caste orig<strong>in</strong>. 366 Especially Malas <strong>and</strong> Madigas have a deep-rooted hatred aga<strong>in</strong>st each other. 367 I t s e e m s o n t h e o t h e r s i d e , t h a t c o n f e s s i o n a l i s m , w h i c h i s t h e m a j o r r e a s o n f o r t h e s c h i s m s i n t h e W es t e r n c o u n t r i e s , d o e s n o t c a u s e t h e s e p a r a t i o n b e t w e e n t h e I n d i a n churches. 368 In Tirupati, e.g., there is a Baptist family which has jo<strong>in</strong>ed the Lutheran Church a s l o n g a s t h e y w o u l d s t a y i n T i r u p a t i , b e c a u s e t h e r e i s n o B a p t i s t c o n g r e g a t i o n . O n t h e doctr<strong>in</strong>al basis, there would be no way for the Baptists to jo<strong>in</strong> the Lutherans, even temporarily. However, the family participates even <strong>in</strong> the Holy communion. The same occurs with a family which belongs to the Salvation Army 369, which has jo<strong>in</strong>ed the Lutheran community, because there is no community of the Salvation Army found <strong>in</strong> Tirupati. T h e o n l y s e p a r a t i o n o f t w o d i f f e r e n t d e n o m i n a t i o n s w h i c h i s e v e n s t r o n g e r t h a n i n E u r o p e i s t h e o n e b e t w e e n R o m a n C a t h o l i c s a n d P r o t e s t a n t s . O n e r e a s o n i s f o u n d i n t h e history of the missionary work: A strong separatism was kept up by the missionaries already <strong>in</strong> the beg<strong>in</strong>n<strong>in</strong>g. At the time when Western missionaries came to India, Protestant <strong>and</strong> Roman Catholic Christians did not have any contact with each other <strong>in</strong> their country of orig<strong>in</strong>. 370 Another reason appears to be the different approach <strong>in</strong> missionary work. The Roman Catholic Church does allow the converts to use <strong>and</strong> to practise some customs which they were follow<strong>in</strong>g as long as they were H<strong>in</strong>dus. The Protestant churches, however, are quite strictly prohibit<strong>in</strong>g customs which appear to have a H<strong>in</strong>du background. 371 366. e.g. the <strong>Andhra</strong> Evangelical Lutheran Church counts about 25% Madigas, while the South <strong>Andhra</strong> Lutheran Church mostly consists of Malas. A merger of these two Lutheran churches <strong>in</strong> <strong>Andhra</strong> Pradesh is unlikely, because the Malas of the SALC do not want their property to fall <strong>in</strong>to the h<strong>and</strong>s of Madiga Christians. 367. See M.E. Prabhakar, <strong>Andhra</strong> Christians…, p. 21. He states that the rivalry between Malas <strong>and</strong> Madigas has assumed unhealthy proportions <strong>in</strong> the recent years. 368. This becomes obvious <strong>in</strong> the union of the CSI as well as the CNI. Both unite churches with m a i n d i f f e r e n c e s i n t h e i r b a s i c d o c t r i n e s , b u t t h e q u e s t i o n s m o s t d i s c u s s e d w e r e t h o s e c o n c e r n i n g a u t h o r i t y a n d l e a d e r s h i p . O n e r e a s o n m a y b e t h e l a c k o f a h i s t o r y o f r e f o r m a t i o n . W h i l e i n E u r o p e n e w d e n o m i n a t i o n s d e v e l o p e d o n a c c o u n t o f fi g h t s o v e r d o c t r i n a l d i f f e r e n c e s , t h e I n d i a n C h r i s t i a n i t y a n d e s p e c i a l l y t h e C h r i s t i a n i t y i n A n d h r a Pradesh, where the mission societies of various denom<strong>in</strong>ations did not <strong>in</strong>terfere <strong>in</strong> the other’s work <strong>and</strong> area, did not have any reason to fight over such issues. On the contrary, many a times a Lutheran is ready to visit the worships of an evangelical or any other church (except the Roman Catholic Church), the doctr<strong>in</strong>es of which would not at all meat those of the Lutheran church, be it the P entecostals, Brethren of Christ or others, <strong>and</strong> vice versa. The most important reason for choos<strong>in</strong>g the worship which one is go<strong>in</strong>g to attend is either the social determ<strong>in</strong>ation by the caste system, or, <strong>in</strong> case one has a more liberal view of the caste system (which is mostly the case among evangelical Christians), the way how the gospel is preached. Cf. also the section 3.6.3 369. see also the section on the Salvation Army on page 64 370. The attempt of Roman Catholic missionaries to baptize people who had previously been under the care of Protestant missionaries, caused also a deep atrocity between these two Christian factions, which was adopted by the Indian Christians who were baptized <strong>in</strong> fear of the Roman Catholic missionaries. 371. see chapter 5 on this issue. There, it becomes clear that the prohibition of certa<strong>in</strong> customs does not have much effect on the day-to-day life of the Christians, <strong>and</strong> it does also not draw any consequences if one follows such customs. In fact, many pastors say that they have to tolerate these customs, because they were common <strong>and</strong> the H<strong>in</strong>du neighbours w o u l d b e t a k e n a b a c k i f t h e y s e e t h e C h r i s t i a n s c o m p l e t e l y r e f r a i n f r o m a n y o f t h e 101"
