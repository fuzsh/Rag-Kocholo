        "text": "Whereas classical HLA alleles are frequently lost in human cancer to prevent T-cell recognition (68, 69), we and others reported high levels of HLA-E in several cancer types, including gynecologic cancers (up to 90% of tumor samples; refs. 70–72) and up to 50% in breast cancer, non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), liver, pancreas, kidney, melanoma, prostate, head and neck, stomach, rectal, and colorectal cancer (73–78). Figure 2 displays some examples of tissue sections of human cancers and their healthy counterparts. The surface expression of HLA-E is correlated with functional antigen-processing components and infiltration of CD8 T cells, however, expression can also be observed in tumors with downregulated classical HLA class I expression. In a cohort of patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, HLA-E expression correlated with a significantly worse survival (81). A poor relapse-free survival rate was also observed in breast cancer, but only when classical class I expression was lost (73). CD8 T-cell infiltration and retained expression of classical HLA class I strongly associate with a better prognosis for patients with NSCLC, cervical, and ovarian carcinomas. However, this predictive value is abrogated when tumor display high HLA-E levels, suggesting that HLA-E mediates resistance against CD8 T-cell attack (70, 71, 74). In primary colorectal cancers, patients with high HLA-E expression showed a significantly decreased disease-free survival for Dukes C patients (76). In another retrospective cohort of 234 colorectal patients, the expression of HLA-E, β2m, CD94, CD8, and NKp46 was examined by IHC on tissue microarray. HLA-E/β2m was overexpressed in microsatellite instable tumors and to a lesser extend in microsatellite stable ones (45% vs. 19%, respectively) and corresponded with worse survival (78). Unfortunately, NKG2A expression cannot be quantified in paraffin-embedded tissues because of lack of specific antibody. In an independent study of colon cancers, the researchers concluded that the total absence of HLA class I, including HLA-E and HLA-G, related to a better overall and disease-free survival (77). This was attributed to NK-cell–mediated killing in the portal vein of MHC class I–negative cancer cells, which give rise to liver metastases.\n\nIt should be stated that there are also several studies of patient cohorts in which the researchers did not observe a relevant correlation with HLA-E expression (75, 82). However, as previously demonstrated, the role of HLA-E expression seems to be dependent on immune contexture, like lymphocyte infiltration and presence of classical HLA class I molecules. Stratification on these factors might also signify the negative effect of HLA-E in these cohorts as observed in others. Finally, it should be noted that HLA-E–directed antibodies fail to distinguish between peptide-filled molecules and empty conformers (see Box 2), complicating the interpretation of these tissue slide results, as especially HLA-E filled with leader peptides constitute ligands for the CD94/NKG2A receptor (56).\n\nSimilarities between the PD1–PD-L1 axis and the NKG2A–HLA-E axis are obvious, as they both involve lymphocytes and represent inhibitory immune receptors, and their ligands are expressed on cancer cells and inducible by the proinflammatory cytokine IFNγ. Of note, HLA-E transcripts in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database exceed those of PD-L1, suggesting a high and general overexpression (Fig. 3). These two pairs reflect feedback signals to dampen overt T-cell–mediated tissue damage at affected lesion sites, which might result in resistance and immune escape of cancer (97, 98). In contrast to PD-1, NKG2A is selectively expressed on lymphocytes with cytolytic function, including NK cells, NKT cells, and a subset of CD8 T cells. Thereby, the NKG2A–HLA-E axis is suggested to predominantly act at the terminal tumor–attack stage and not to be involved in priming or regulation of immune responses. Interruption of this axis by blocking antibodies can be envisaged at both sides. However, NKG2A is the preferred target instead of HLA-E, because blockade of HLA-E would also prevent interaction with the activating NKG2C receptor. A NKG2C-expressing subset of NK cells, also called “adaptive NK cells,” displays an altered receptor profile and is associated with chronic viruses, like cytomegalovirus (CMV; refs. 99, 100). Its role in immunity to CMV remains elusive, but anti-HLA-E antibodies would also block activation of such NK cells through NKG2C.\n\nDisappointingly, mouse cancer models demonstrated limited success of NKG2A blockade therapy when provided as a standalone blocking antibody, however, it greatly improved antitumor efficacy of other forms of immunotherapy, like PD-L1 blockade or cancer vaccines (7, 8, 101). Cancer vaccines induced strong tumor-directed T-cell responses and infiltration of CD8 T cells in the tumors, leading to local IFNγ release and increase of the mouse HLA-E ortholog (7). In addition, frequencies of NKG2A+ CD8 T cells were increased in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL). The association of immune reactivity and NKG2A+ T-cell frequency was corroborated in human TIL of oropharyngeal carcinomas (7). Together, these observations designated a role for NKG2A as an acquired resistance mechanism (102). This concept is further substantiated by preclinical in vitro data demonstrating a requirement of immune activation signals to reveal beneficial effects of NKG2A blockade (8, 27, 38). Design of clinical trials should therefore be based on combination therapy leading to inflammatory responses in patients with cancer. Induced expression of HLA-E or enhanced frequencies of NKG2A+ immune cells in the tumor might serve as predictive biomarkers."
