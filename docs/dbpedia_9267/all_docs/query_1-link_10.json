        "text": "Annual religious meeting in Kerala, India\n\nMaramon ConventionGenreChristian conferencesDatesSecond week of FebruaryFrequencyAnnuallyLocation(s)Maramon, Pathanamthitta, Kerala, IndiaFounded1895Organised byMalankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church - through Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association (MTEA)Websitehttp://mtconvention.com/\n\nThe Maramon Convention, a Christian convention in Asia, is held at Maramon, Pathanamthitta, Kerala, India annually in February on the vast sand-bed of the Pampa River next to the Kozhencherry Bridge. It is organised by Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association, the missionary wing of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church.\n\nThe origin and growth of this annual get-together for one week at a stretch can be traced to the great revival movement which gathered momentum during the reformation period in the Syrian Churches of Kerala under the pioneering leadership of Abraham Malpan in the latter part of the 19th century. This brought about the transformation in resurgence of the ancient apostolic Churches in Kerala founded by St. Thomas the Apostle[1] approximately in AD 52.\n\nCultural identity of Saint Thomas Christians\n\n[edit]\n\nSaint Thomas in the Syriac-speaking culture of upper Mesopotamia and Syria the apostle was called Judas Thomas. Thomas (Tau'ma) means twin in Syriac.[2]\n\nJawaharlal Nehru in his Glimpses of World History, 1934 wrote about Christianity in India:\n\n\"You may be surprised to learn that Christianity came to India long before it went to England or Western Europe, and when even in Rome it was a despised and proscribed sect. Within 100 years or so of the death of Jesus, Christian Missionaries came to South India by sea. They were received courteously and permitted to preach their new faith. They converted a large number of people, and their descendants have lived there, with varying fortune, to this day. Most of them belong to old Christian sects which have ceased to exist in Europe\".\n\nSt. Ephraem, a Christian deacon and scholar, in AD 363 composed a poem that honors St. Thomas in that era's understanding:[3][4]\n\n\"Blessed art thou, like a solar ray, India’s darkness doth dispel. Thou the great lamp, one among the Twelve, with oil from the cross replenished India’s night flooded with light. Oh Blessed Apostle, valiant Mar Thoma whom violent threats did not affright, Blessed apostle be thou praised, whom the Great King has sent that India to his one begotten thou shouldest espouse.\"\n\nAn ancient Indian non-Christian work Nagargarandhavaryola mentions St. Thomas:[5][6][verification needed]\n\nIn AD 52 \"the foreigner Thomas Sanyasi came to our village, preached there causing pollution. We therefore came away from that village.\"\n\nMar Thoma Evangelistic Association\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1877, there were two factions in the Malankara church, known as Bishop faction (Methran Kakshi) and Patriarch faction (Bava Kakshi). By a court verdict on 12 July 1889, Bishop faction lost all the properties. In this turbulent period, on 5 September 1888, 12 members of the Bishop faction formed a missionary group called \"Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association\".[7][8] These 12 members are considered the founding fathers of the Maramon convention. The names of these 12 members are:-\n\nKottarathil Thomas Kasseessa, Chengannur\n\nEdavamvelil Mathai, Eraviperoor.\n\nKottooreth Yohannan, Chengannur\n\nChempakasseril Kadavil Abraham, Kallissery\n\nChakkalayil Cherian Upadesi, Puthencavu\n\nChempakasseril Kadavil Mathuchen, Kallissery\n\nAzhakinal Thommi, Kallooppara\n\nNathaniel Upadesi, Chengannur\n\nKurichiath (Vattadiyil) Ittiyavara, Niranam\n\nArangat Philipose, Maramon\n\nOttaplammoottil Kunju Mathew, Kallissery\n\nKochumannil Skariah, Edayaranmula\n\nThey met at the Kadavil Malika belonging to Chempakasseril Kadavil Abraham and Chempakasseril Kadavil Mathuchen (1860 - 1897). This house at Kallissery near Chengannur was built by their grandfather Unnittan Kathanar (1767 - 1852) and his son Abraham Kathanar (1822 - 1884) also known as Kadavil Achen, in the early 19th century. (The Kadavil Malika was reclaimed by the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church church and renovated on 10 September 2005.)\n\nBeginning\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1894, a number of small supportive prayer group communions emerged and this paved a way for revival.[citation needed] They had regular meetings in various parishes. Because the number of people attending these meetings was growing; the need was addressed by deciding to have a meeting of these groups in a wider level at a central accessible place. This was a venue for dimensional spiritual edification that is applicable, biblically sound, ideal and value based[9] for striving with the realities of the world and never a place for signs, wonders and miracles.[10] During the 19th century, people began to occupy hilly places which resulted in felling of forests in and around the catchment area of Pampa river and started intensive cultivation of annual crops like tapioca, yams ... etc.[citation needed] This unplanned encroachment resulted in large scale soil erosion.[citation needed] Deep river with mud was filled with white sand, which turned to be congenial place to assemble for a gathering of masses. No need for any seating arrangement as people can sit on the neat white sand bed under roofs made by knitted coconut leaves. The duty of organising this meeting was given to the Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association and the first convention was held in 1895 at Maramon. Today the changing habitat and lesser focus on agriculture with rise of rubber plantation, the surfaced roads minimised soil erosion and a large scale sand mining for construction activities decreased the size of the sand bed to a great extent.\n\nBy 1900 reformers adopted the name Malankara Marthoma Suriyani Sabha also known as the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church to encase its ancient lineage.\n\nPictures\n\n[edit]\n\nThis view of the 2008 convention is from Kozhencherry side. The Kozhencherry bridge is on the right. There are usually no empty spaces inside the Panthal (tent) so people stand outside and group around the shade to listen to the songs and messages.\n\nThis view of the 2009 convention is from Maramon side. The Kozhencherry bridge is on the left.\n\nThe first convention\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first convention was held for 10 days from 8 to 17 March 1895.[citation needed] The venue was the vast sand-bed of the Pampa River next to the Maramon church. The parishes in and around Maramon – Kozhencherry helped in making a very large panthal (tent) to accommodate about 10,000 people. The main speakers were David and Wordsworth.[who?] On an average 10,000 to 15,000 people attended these meetings. On the last day almost 25,000 attended. There were no proper roads during those days. So nearby houses accommodated the people from far away places. Some of them came in boats and used them as their shelter.\n\nThe convention at present\n\n[edit]\n\nMaramon Convention is held for eight days during the first week of the Great Lent that usually falls in February. The tent has a seating capacity in excess of 160,000 people. They are seated on the dry sand bed. Old and weak are given sponsored-paid chairs to sit on. There is also a smaller tent erected next to the larger one for people with infants and with children below 5. All around the temporary tent there are prayer and rest sheds and other tents for various purposes related to the Church. Stalls for the sale of religious literature and other items, church mission advertisement and funding offices and restaurants are allowed to operate in the vicinity of the tent under the control of the Church authorities.\n\nProgramme\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Maramon Convention is pre-eminently an assembly of Christians who once a year come here for listening to the Word of God as read and expounded by Christian leaders from all over India as well as abroad. Introduction and promotion of Church activities and Preaching occupy the major part of the convention programme. In the morning there will be separate Bible study classes for Men, women, youth and children conducted by specially invited leaders. The mornings and afternoons are public meetings and in the evening, meetings are for men only. Four of the afternoon public meetings are for 'Facing the challenges of Social evils as Christians'. The choir leads the singing and the introduction of voguish songs and the whole gathering joins in singing.[citation needed] A hymn book with 101 hymns including 16 new ones are printed every year for the convention use. Everyday half an hour is spent for intercessory prayer.[11] Also there are family gatherings, youth meetings and special gatherings after the afternoon session.\n\nLeaders\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to the Metropolitan and Episcopas of the church, distinguished world-renowned speakers addressed this convention.

Early on, offerings were collected in every meeting. Now it is collected in four of the 21 general meetings and a special collection from parishes in foreign lands. The collection is distributed to various organisations and missions of the church and also for the Bible society and CSSM.[34]\n\nConclusion\n\n[edit]\n\nAll those who come to the convention area experience peace, the spiritual liveliness that is spread around the panthal (tent) & the mobility of the masses with the sense of equality. The unbroken prayer of the laity is considered the grace behind the spiritual backbone of the convention. The Maramon Convention displays co-operation and union between different sections of Church in Kerala. It fosters an ecumenical outlook. It is also a source of spiritual inspiration and enlightenment for thousands.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMalankara Marthoma Syrian Church\n\nKadavil Malika\n\nPathanamthitta\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nRev.
