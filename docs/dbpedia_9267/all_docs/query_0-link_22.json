        "text": "Purpose: Patellar resurfacing has long been a contentious subject in TKA with no consensus and the literature yielding disparate results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term functional outcomes and complications of patients undergoing primary TKA without patellar resurfacing (non-resurfacing).\n\nMethods: This study retrospectively analysed 9346 patients who underwent primary manual jig-based TKA without patellar resurfacing at a single high-volume arthroplasty centre between 2010 and 2018. Patients with a minimum three year follow-up irrespective of disease etiology and implant manufacturer were included in the study. Primary outcome was measured using Oxford knee score and patellofemoral Feller score. Secondary outcomes included determining the incidence of patellofemoral complications and re-operation rates following TKA."
