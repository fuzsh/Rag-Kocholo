Methods: This is a prospective matched cohort study (1:2 ratio). One hundred and one UKA cases were matched to 206 TKA cases by propensity score matching for age, body mass index (BMI), gender distribution, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The primary outcome (Oxford knee score, OKS) was assessed at a 3-year follow-up, along with secondary outcomes (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC] Score, Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), Anterior Knee Pain (Kujala) score, patient satisfaction, and revision rate at the final follow-up). Results: The UKA group was superior to the TKA group in patient-reported functional outcomes based on the OKS (p = 0.004). Using the FJS score, UKA was more likely to be a forgotten joint compared to TKA (p < 0.001). However, differences in the OKS and FJS did not meet the reported minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds. Quality of life (EuroQol-5D VAS scale) was found to be significantly higher in the UKA group (p < 0.001). Patients in the UKA group were more likely to be very satisfied (75.2%) versus the TKA group (62.1%, p = 0.023). Conclusion: For AMOA, UKA was associated with improved patient satisfaction compared to TKA. Although patient-reported outcome measures were statistically in favour of UKA over TKA, the differences were not clinically significant. Multicenter and randomized studies comparing the two procedures are warranted.\n\nEvidence: Level-II Therapeutic"
