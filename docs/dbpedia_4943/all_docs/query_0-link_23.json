        "text": "William Edward Burghardt Du Bois[1] (February 23, 1868 - August 27, 1963) was an African-American writer, and an intellectual leader as sociologist, historian, civil rights activist, and Pan-Africanist. His poems were published posthumously.\n\nLife[]\n\nOverview[]\n\nBorn in Massachusetts, Du Bois graduated from Harvard, where he earned his Ph.D in History, the first African American to earn a doctorate at Harvard. Later he became a professor of history and economics at Atlanta University. As head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1910, he was founder and editor of the NAACP's journal The Crisis. Du Bois rose to national attention in his opposition of Booker T. Washington's alleged ideas of accommodation with Jim Crow separation between whites and blacks and disfranchisement of blacks in the South, campaigning instead for increased political representation for blacks in order to guarantee civil rights, and the formation of a black intellectual elite who would work for the progress of the African-American race.[2]\n\nBiographer David Levering Lewis wrote, \"In the course of his long, turbulent career, W.E.B. Du Bois attempted virtually every possible solution to the problem of 20th-century racism — scholarship, propaganda, integration, national self-determination, human rights, cultural and economic separatism, politics, international communism, expatriation, third world solidarity.\"[3]\n\nFamily[]\n\nDu Bois's name is sometimes misspelled \"DuBois,\" \"du Bois,\" or \"duBois\"; the correct spelling separates the 2 syllables and capitalizes each. Although the name is of French origin, Du Bois himself pronounced it \"dyoo-boyze\", unlike the French \"doo-bwah\".[4]\n\nDu Bois was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, to Alfred Du Bois and Mary Silvina (Burghardt) Du Bois. Burghardt's family was part of the very small free black population of Great Barrington, having long owned land in the state. Their family descended from Dutch and African ancestors. Tom Burghardt, a slave (born in West Africa around 1730) earned his freedom in 1780 by military service during the American Revolution as a private soldier in Captain John Spoor's company.[5] According to Du Bois, several of his maternal ancestors were notably involved in regional history.\n\nAlfred Du Bois, from Haiti, was of French Huguenot and African descent. His grandfather was Dr. James Du Bois of Poughkeepsie, New York. Dr. Du Bois's family was rewarded extensive lands in the Bahamas for its support of King George III during the American Revolution. On Long Cay, Bahamas, James Du Bois fathered several children with slave mistresses. When he returned to New York in 1812, Du Bois brought with him John and Alexander, 2 of his mixed-race sons, to be educated in Connecticut.\n\nAfter James Du Bois died, his black sons were disowned by his family and forced to give up schooling for work. Alexander became a merchant in New Haven and married Sarah Marsh Lewis, with whom he had several children. In the 1830s Alexander went to Haiti to try to salvage his inheritance. His son Alfred was born there in about 1833. Alexander returned to New Haven without the boy and his mother. Alfred Du Bois and Mary Silvina Burghardt married on February 5, 1867, in Housatonic, Massachusetts.\n\nYouth[]\n\nAlfred deserted Mary by the time their son William was 2. The boy grew up in Great Barrington, a predominately Anglo-American town. He was very close to his mother. When he was young, Mary suffered a stroke which left her unable to work. The 2 of them moved frequently, surviving on money from family members and Du Bois's after-school jobs. Du Bois believed he could improve their lives through education. Some of the neighborhood whites noticed him, and 1 rented Du Bois and his mother a house in Great Barrington. During these years, Du Bois attended the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington.\n\nDu Bois performed chores and worked odd jobs. He did not feel separate because of his skin color while he was in school. He has suggested that the only times he felt out of place were when out-of-towners visited Great Barrington. One such incident occurred when a white girl who was new in school refused to take one of his \"calling cards\" during a game; the girl told him she would not accept it because he was black. Du Bois then realized that there would always be a barrier between some whites and non-whites.[6]\n\nDu Bois faced some challenges as the precocious, intellectual, mixed-race son of an impoverished single mother. His intellectual gifts were recognized by many of his teachers, who encouraged him to further his education with classical courses while in high school. His scholastic success led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans.[7]\n\nUniversity education[]\n\nIn 1888 Du Bois earned a degree from Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. During the following summer, he managed the Fisk Glee Club, which was employed at a luxury summer resort on Lake Minnetonka in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota. The resort was a favorite of vacationing wealthy American Southerners and European royalty. In addition to providing entertainment, Du Bois and the other club members worked as waiters and kitchen help at the hotel.[8] The young Du Bois was put off by the drinking, crude behavior, and sexual promiscuity of the rich white guests at the hotel.[9]\n\nDu Bois entered Harvard College in the fall of 1888, having received a $300 scholarship.[10] He earned a bachelor's degree cum laude from Harvard in 1890. In 1892, he received a fellowship from the John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen to attend the University of Berlin for graduate work. While a student in Berlin, he traveled extensively throughout Europe. He came of age intellectually in the German capital, while studying with some of that nation's most prominent social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller, Adolph Wagner, and Heinrich von Treitschke.\n\nIn 1895, Du Bois became the 1st African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University. After teaching at Wilberforce University in Ohio, he worked at the University of Pennsylvania. He taught while undertaking field research for his study The Philadelphia Negro. Next he moved to Georgia, where he established the Department of Social Work at Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University Whitney M. Young school of Social Work). He also taught at The New School in Greenwich Village, New York City.\n\nIn 1940, at Atlanta University, Du Bois founded Phylon magazine. In 1946, he wrote The World and Africa: An inquiry into the part that Africa has played in world history. In 1945, he helped organize the historic Fifth Pan-African Conference in Manchester, Great Britain.[11] In total, Du Bois wrote 22 books, including 5 novels. He helped establish 4 academic journals.\n\nCriminology[]\n\nDu Bois began writing about the sociology of crime in 1897, shortly after receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard (Zuckerman, 2004, p. 2). His first work involving crime, A Program of Social Reform, was shortly followed by a second, The Study of the Negro Problems (Du Bois, 1897; Du Bois, 1898). The first work that involved in-depth criminological study and theorizing was The Philadelphia Negro, in which a large section of the sociological study was devoted to analysis of the black criminal population in Philadelphia (Du Bois, 1899).\n\nDu Bois (1899) set forth three significant parts to his criminology theory. The first was that Negro crime was caused by the strain of the \"social revolution\" experienced by black Americans as they began to adapt to their new-found freedom and position in the nation. This theory was similar to Durkheim's (1893) Anomie theory, but it applied specifically to the newly freed Negro. Du Bois (1900a, p. 3) credited Emancipation with causing the boom in crime in the black population. He explained, \"[T]he appearance of crime among the southern Negroes is a symptom of wrong social conditions--of a stress of life greater than a large part of the community can bear.\" (Du Bois, 1901b, p. 745). He distinguished between the strains on southern Negroes and those on northern Negroes because the problems of city life in the North were different from those of the Southern rural sharecroppers.\n\nSecondly, Du Bois (1904a) believed that black crime declined as the African-American population moved toward a more equal status with whites. This idea, referred to later as \"stratification,\" was developed in a similar manner later in the twentieth century by Merton in his 1968 structure-strain theory of deviance. In The Philadelphia Negro and later statistical studies, Du Bois found direct correlations between low levels of employment and education and high levels of criminal activity.\n\nThirdly, Du Bois held that the Talented Tenth or the \"exceptional men\" of the black race would be the ones to lead the race and save it from its criminal problems (Du Bois, 1903, p. 33). Du Bois saw the evolution of a class system within black American society as necessary to carry out the improvements necessary to reduce crime. (Du Bois, 1903). He set forth a number of solutions to crime that the Talented Tenth had to enact (Du Bois, 1903, p. 2).\n\nHe was perhaps the 1st criminologist to combine historical fact with social change and used the combination to postulate his theories. He attributed the crime increase after the Civil War to the \"increased complexity of life,\" competition for jobs in industry (especially with the recent Irish immigrants), and the mass exodus of blacks from the farmland and immigration to cities (Du Bois, 1899). Du Bois (1899, p. 64) states in The Philadelphia Negro:\n\nNaturally then, if men are suddenly transported from one environment to another, the result is lack of harmony with the new conditions; lack of harmony with the new physical surroundings leading to disease and death or modification of physique; lack of harmony with social surroundings leading to crime.\n\nCivil rights activism[]\n\nTemplate:African American topics sidebar Du Bois was the most prominent intellectual leader and political activist on behalf of African Americans in the first half of the twentieth century. A contemporary of Booker T. Washington, he carried on a dialogue with the educator about segregation, political disfranchisement, and ways to improve African American life. He was labeled \"The Father of Pan-Africanism.\"\n\nAlong with Washington, Du Bois helped organize the \"Negro exhibition\" at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It included Frances Benjamin Johnston's photos of Hampton Institute's black students.[12] The Negro exhibition focused on African Americans' positive contributions to American society.[12]\n\nDu Bois is viewed by many as a modern day prophet.[13] This is highlighted by his \"Credo\", a prose-poem first published in The Independent in 1904.[14] It was reprinted in Darkwater in 1920.[15] It was written in style similar to a Christian creed and was his statement of faith and vision for change. Credo was widely read and recited.\n\nIn 1905, Du Bois, along with Minnesota attorney Fredrick L. McGhee[16] and others, helped found the Niagara Movement with William Monroe Trotter. The Movement championed freedom of speech and criticism, the recognition of the highest and best human training as the monopoly of no caste or race, full male suffrage, a belief in the dignity of labor, and a united effort to realize such ideals under sound leadership.\n\nThe alliance between Du Bois and Trotter was, however, short-lived, as they had a dispute over whether or not white people should be included in the organization and in the struggle for civil rights. Believing that they should, in 1909 Du Bois with a group of like-minded supporters founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n\nIn 1910, Du Bois left Atlanta University to work full-time as Publications Director at the NAACP. He also wrote columns published weekly in many newspapers, including the San Francisco Chronicle as well as the African American Chicago Defender, the Pittsburgh Courier and the New York Amsterdam News. For 25 years, Du Bois worked as editor-in-chief of the NAACP publication, The Crisis, then subtitled A Record of the Darker Races. He commented freely and widely on current events and set the agenda for the fledgling NAACP. The journal's circulation soared from 1,000 in 1910 to more than 100,000 by 1920.[17]\n\nDu Bois published Harlem Renaissance writers Langston Hughes and Jean Toomer. He encouraged black fiction, poetry and dramas. As a journal of black thought, the Crisis was initially a monopoly, David Levering Lewis observed. In 1913, Du Bois wrote The Star of Ethiopia, a historical pageant, to promote African-American history and civil rights.\n\nDu Bois thought blacks should seek higher education, preferably liberal arts. He also believed blacks should challenge and question whites on all grounds. Booker T. Washington believed assimilating and fitting into the \"American\" culture was the best way for blacks to move up in society. While Washington stated that he did not receive any racist insults until his later years, Du Bois said blacks have a \"Double-Conscious\" mind in which they have to know when to act \"white\" and when to act \"black\". Booker T. Washington believed that teaching was a duty, but Du Bois believed it was a calling.\n\nDu Bois became increasingly estranged from Walter Francis White, the executive secretary of the NAACP. He began to question the organization's opposition to all racial segregation. Du Bois thought that this policy undermined those black institutions that did exist. He believed that such institutions should be defended and improved rather than attacked as inferior.\n\nBy the 1930s, the NAACP had become more institutional and Du Bois increasingly radical, sometimes at odds with leaders such as Walter White and Roy Wilkins. In 1934, Du Bois left the magazine to return to teaching at Atlanta University, after writing 2 essays published in the Crisis suggesting that black separatism could be a useful economic strategy.\n\nAs a member of the Princeton chapter of the NAACP, Albert Einstein corresponded with Du Bois, and in 1946 Einstein called racism \"America's worst disease\".[18]\n\nDuring the 1920s, Du Bois engaged in a bitter feud with Marcus Garvey. They disagreed over whether African Americans could be assimilated as equals into American society (the view held by Du Bois). Their dispute descended to personal attacks, sometimes based on ancestry. Du Bois wrote, \"Garvey is, without doubt, the most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and in the world. He is either a lunatic or a traitor.\"[19] Garvey described Du Bois as \"purely and simply a white man's nigger\" and \"a little Dutch, a little French, a little Negro ... a mulatto ... a monstrosity.\"[20]\n\nDu Bois became an early member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity which was established by African Americans and had a civil rights focus.\n\nReligion[]\n\nDu Bois was involved in religion, studied Baptist churches, and contributed to the sociological study of religion.[21] He believed that the capacity of religion could be either good or evil. In the context of the black community, Du Bois suggested that religion gives people strength and pride; African Americans could derive comfort from one another by sharing their common struggles and experiences. On the other hand, Du Bois contended that religion maintained the status quo of America in regards to racial injustice and class disparity.\n\nDu Bois believed that religious organizations serve as communal centers. In The Philadelphia Negro, Du Bois argued that blacks who attended church went for a social gathering first and religion second. Du Bois said that church \"introduces the stranger to the community, it serves as a lyceum, library, and lecture bureau—it is, in fine, the central organ of the organized life of the American Negro.\"[21]\n\nSusan Jacoby writes that Du Bois was \"raised as a liberal New England Congregationalist… contrary to the majority of blacks, who were brought up in the Baptist evangelical tradition\". He \"became a self-described freethinker in Europe.\"[22]:191 Returning to the United States in 1894 to teach at Wilberforce University in Ohio, Du Bois' polemical stance on prayer in school and his critical views on the church set him at odds with contemporary Booker T. Washington.[22]:193 In his autobiography, he wrote: \"When I became head of a department at Atlanta, the engagement was held up because again I balked at leading in prayer… I flatly refused again to join any church or sign any church creed. …I think the greatest gift of the Soviet Union to modern civilization was the dethronement of the clergy and the refusal to let religion be taught in the public schools.\"\n\nAmerican Historical Association[]\n\nIn 1909, W.E.B. Du Bois addressed the American Historical Association (AHA) at its annual conference, the first African American to do so. According to David Levering Lewis, \"His would be the first and last appearance of an African American on the program until 1940.\"[23]\n\nIn a review of the 2nd volume of Lewis’s biography of Du Bois, Michael R Winston observed that, in understanding American history, one must question \"how black Americans developed the psychological stamina and collective social capacity to cope with the sophisticated system of racial domination that white Americans had anchored deeply in law and custom.\" Winston continued, \"Although any reasonable answer is extraordinarily complex, no adequate one can ignore the man (Du Bois) whose genius was for 70 years at the intellectual epicenter of the struggle to destroy white supremacy as public policy and social fact in the United States.\"[24]\n\nImperial Japan and Nazi Germany[]\n\nDu Bois became impressed by the growing strength of Imperial Japan following the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War. He saw the victory of Japan over Tsarist Russia as an example of \"colored pride.\"Template:FACT Hikida Yasuichi ran Japan's \"Negro Propaganda Operations.\" After traveling to the United States to speak with students at Howard University, Scripps College, and Tuskegee University, Yasuichi influenced Du Bois’s opinions of Imperial Japan. In 1936, Yasuichi and the Japanese ambassador arranged a trip to Japan for Du Bois and a small group of academics.[25] The trip was to include stops in Japan, China, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet stop was canceled after Karl Radek, Du Bois’s diplomatic contact, was swept up in Stalin's purges. While on the Chinese leg of the trip, Du Bois commented that the source of Chinese-Japanese enmity was China’s \"submission to white aggression and Japan's resistance.\" He asked the Chinese people to welcome the Japanese as liberators. Du Bois joined a large group of African-American academics who cited the Mukden Incident to justify Japan’s occupation and annexation of the formerly European-held southern Manchuria.\n\nDuring 1936 Du Bois also visited Nazi Germany. He later noted that he had received more respect from German academics than he had from white American colleagues. On his return to the United States, he voiced his ambivalence about the Nazi regime. While admiring how the Nazis had improved the German economy, he was horrified by their treatment of the Jews, which he described as \"an attack on civilization, comparable only to such horrors as the Spanish Inquisition and the African slave trade\".[26]\n\nOn scientific racism and eugenics[]\n\nDu Bois was an outspoken opponent of scientific racism.[27] Along with cultural anthropologist Franz Boas, and in the pages of Crisis magazine, and in debates with advocates of a biological basis for white superiority Du Bois opposed the notion that African-Americans are biologically inferior to whites.[28][29][30][31][32]\n\nDu Bois opposed scientific justifications for racism and he spoke out against the eugenics experiments at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; he advocated the use of birth control in conjunction with what has been called his \"elitist\" encouragement of a \"talented tenth\" among gifted African-Americans.[33][34]\n\nIn 1904, Du Bois wrote that black people show no physical variation from Europeans sufficient to base any theory of essential human difference.[35] In 1910, Du Bois challenged eugenicist opposition to racial mixing and lent his support to racial intermarriage; he said gradations exist within all races: \"I believe that there are human stocks with whom it is physically unwise to intermarry, but to think that these stocks are all colored or that there are no such white stocks is unscientific and false.\"[36]\n\nIn his 1932 essay on birth control in Margaret Sanger’s Birth Control Review, Du Bois accepted the conventional wisdom that “the more intelligent class” uses birth control; he wrote that, “The mass of ignorant Negroes still breed carelessly and disastrously, so that the increase among Negroes, even more than the increase among whites, is from that part of the population least intelligent and fit, and least able to rear their children properly.” He suggested that African Americans “learn that among human races and groups, as among vegetables, quality and not mere quantity really counts.”[37]\n\nCommunism and activism[]\n\nDu Bois was one of a number of African-American leaders investigated by the FBI, which claimed in May 1942 that \"his writing indicates him to be a socialist\".[38] He was chairman of the Peace Information Center at the start of the Korean War, and among the signers of the Stockholm Peace Pledge, which opposed the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn 1950, at the age of 82, Du Bois ran for U.S. Senator from New York on the American Labor Party ticket and polled a little over 200,000 votes, about 4% of the total. Although he lost, Du Bois remained committed to the progressive labor cause. In 1958, he would join with Trotskyites, ex-Communists and independent radicals in proposing the creation of a united left-wing coalition to challenge for seats in elections for the New York State Senate and Assembly.\n\nOn March 16, 1953, upon the death of Joseph Stalin, Du Bois wrote of him in The National Guardian:\n\nJoseph Stalin was a great man; few other men of the 20th century approach his stature. He was simple, calm and courageous. He seldom lost his poise; pondered his problems slowly, made his decisions clearly and firmly; never yielded to ostentation nor coyly refrained from holding his rightful place with dignity. He was the son of a serf but stood calmly before the great without hesitation or nerves. But also—and this was the highest proof of his greatness—he knew the common man, felt his problems, followed his fate.[39]\n\nWhile Stalin had fallen into disfavor among some of the American Left of that era, and Communism had come to be regarded as \"the god that failed\" in the eyes of some African-American intellectuals as Ralph Ellison and Richard Wright, Du Bois persisted in his admiration for Stalin.[40] He was frequently challenged for his support of Stalin, particularly after Khrushchev's 1956 \"Cult of Personality\" speech. Having once, after a 1920s visit to Russia, observed that, \"Russia is the victim of a determined propaganda of lies\", he remained persistently skeptical of American media reports regarding the USSR; when challenged as to his beliefs on Stalin in 1956, in one instance he conceded that \"[Stalin] was probably too cruel; but… he conquered Hitler.\"[40]\n\nIn regards to Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956, the 88-year-old Du Bois defended the USSR, suggesting that the Hungarian Revolution was the work of \"landlords and fascists\".[41] Regarding this, one scholar said he was \"one of the great pioneers of anti-colonialist scholarship… a headstrong idealist: he idealized Stalinism… He saw what he wished and needed to see, and thus he replicated the hard, domineering consciousness he condemned.\"[41]\n\nDu Bois visited Communist China during the Great Leap Forward. He was questioned before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) about his alleged communist sympathies. He was indicted in the United States under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and acquitted for lack of evidence.(Citation needed) In 1959 Du Bois received the Lenin Peace Prize. In 1961, at the age of 93, he joined the Communist Party USA, at a time when it was long past its peak of membership.\n\nJust 40 days before he was assassinated, Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke at an event marking the 100th anniversary of Du Bois' birth, at Carnegie Hall in New York City:[42]\n\nWe cannot talk of Dr. Du Bois without recognizing that he was a radical all of his life. Some people would like to ignore the fact that he was a Communist in his later years. It is worth noting that Abraham Lincoln warmly welcomed the support of Karl Marx during the Civil War and corresponded with him freely. In contemporary life, the English speaking world has no difficulty with the fact that Sean O'Casey was a literary giant of the 20th century and a Communist, or that Pablo Neruda is generally considered the greatest living poet though he also served in the Chilean Senate as a Communist. It is time to cease muting the fact that Dr. Du Bois was a genius and chose to be a Communist. Our irrational obsessive anti-communism has led us into too many quagmires to be retained as if it were a mode of scientific thinking....Dr. Du Bois’ greatest virtue was his committed empathy with all the oppressed and his divine dissatisfaction with all forms of injustice.[43]}}\n\nDeath[]\n\nDu Bois was invited to Ghana in 1961 by President Kwame Nkrumah to direct the Encyclopedia Africana, a government production, and a long-held dream of his. When, in 1963, he was refused a new U.S. passport, he and his wife, Shirley Graham Du Bois, became citizens of Ghana. Contrary to some opinions (including David Levering Lewis's Pulitzer Prize winning biography of Du Bois), he never renounced his US citizenship, even when denied a passport to travel to Ghana. Du Bois' health had declined in 1962, and on August 27, 1963, he died in Accra, Ghana at the age of 95, a day before Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech.[44] At the March on Washington, Roy Wilkins informed the hundreds of thousands of marchers and called for a moment of silence.[45]\n\nDu Bois is buried at the Du Bois Memorial Centre in Accra.\n\nPrivate life[]\n\nDu Bois was married twice: in 1896 to Nina Gomer Du Bois (died 1950) with whom he had 2 children, Burghardt (who died as a baby) and Yolande; and in 1951 to author, playwright, composer, and activist Shirley Graham Du Bois (died 1977) with whom he emigrated to Ghana. The second volume of David Levering Lewis's Pulitzer-winning biography controversially presented evidence for extramarital relationships, describing Du Bois as \"a priapic adulterer\",[46] though a subsequent biography, Dubois and His Rivals by Raymond Wolters, cast doubt on this, based on the lack of direct corroboration from Du Bois's alleged lovers.[47]\n\nWriting[]\n\nDu Bois wrote many books, including 3 major autobiographies. Among his most significant works are The Philadelphia Negro (1899), The Souls of Black Folk (1903), John Brown (1909), Black Reconstruction (1935), and Black Folk, Then and Now (1939). His book The Negro (1915) influenced the work of several pioneer Africanist scholars, such as Drusilla Dunjee Houston.[48] and William Leo Hansberry.[49][50]\n\nDuring his time in Atlanta, he also saw the overwhelmingly rural agricultural areas of Georgia, where most blacks worked on others' land as laborers and sharecroppers. Reflecting on their lives was part of what he expressed in The Souls of Black Folk, a meditation on the problems of race in American culture, which he defined as the problem of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the New York Times review of The Souls of Black Folk, the anonymous book reviewer wrote, \"For it is the Jim Crow car, and the fact that he may not smoke a cigar and drink a cup of tea with the white man in the South, that most galls William E. Burghardt Du Bois of the Atlanta College for Negroes.\"[51]\n\n[I]t is the thought of a negro of Northern education who has lived long among his brethren of the South yet who can not fully feel the meaning of some things which these brethren know by instinct — and which the Southern-bred white knows by a similar instinct: certain things which are by both accepted as facts — not theories — fundamental attitudes of race to race which are the product of conditions extending over centuries, as are the somewhat parallel attitudes of the gentry to the peasantry in other countries.[51]\n\nWhile some prominent white scholars denied African-American cultural, political and social relevance to American history and civic life, in his epic work Black Reconstruction, Du Bois documented how black people were central figures in the American Civil War and Reconstruction, and also showed how they made alliances with white politicians. He provided evidence to disprove the Dunning School theories of Reconstruction, showing the coalition governments established public education in the South, as well as many needed social service programs. He demonstrated the ways in which Black emancipation — the crux of Reconstruction — promoted a radical restructuring of United States society, as well as how and why the country failed to continue support for civil rights for blacks in the aftermath of Reconstruction.[52] This theme was taken up later and expanded by Eric Foner, Leon F. Litwack, the two leading late twentieth-century scholars of the Reconstruction era, as well as David W. Blight, whose Race and Reunion demonstrated how issues of race were pushed aside in the drive for reconciliation between the North and South in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nRecognition[]\n\nIn 1958 Du Bois was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Prague.

Rawlings, opened Du Bois's former residence as a memorial center, and he was re-interred with the remains of his second wife, Shirley Graham Du Bois. The W.E.B.
