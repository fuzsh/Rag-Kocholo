The Scarlet Knights advanced to the final of the BIG EAST Tournament before receiving a second seed in the West Region of the NCAA Tournament, and the right to host the first two rounds of the national tourney. Rutgers dispatched No. 15 Holy Cross 91-70 and No. 10 Saint Joseph's 59-39 in Piscataway before moving on to the West Regional in Portland, Ore. RU defeated No. 11 UAB 60-45 in the semifinals, then upset top-seeded Georgia 59-51 in the regional final, punching the team's ticket for the Final Four in Philadelphia. The Scarlet Knights' dream season ended with a 64-54 loss to Tennessee.\n\n2004-2005 Men's Track & Field Team - Class of 2017\n\nHall of Fame Focus Feature\n\nThe 2004-05 Rutgers men's track and field team was perhaps the most dominant squad in program history. That season, the Scarlet Knights secured their first Big East Outdoor Conference title, claiming the team championship by 49.5 points. A winner of both the indoor and outdoor IC4A Championships that season, the 2004-05 squad was the first Rutgers team to win either championship and produced 12 NCAA qualifiers in the process. Sam Segond earned First Team All-America in the discus, while Marquis Allen finished as a First Team All-America performer in the long jump during the outdoor season. Twenty student-athletes were named All-Big East, while 19 claimed conference titles. Fifteen school records fell that season, including an NCAA indoor record set by the 4x200m relay team that stood for seven years. Segond and Trevor O'Grady were named NCAA Regional Athletes of the Year, while the Scarlet Knight staff of head coach Mike Mulqueen and assistant coaches Kevin Kelly, Lou Tomlinson and Tony Naclerio were named the Big East Coaching Staff of the Year. Additionally, Mulqueen was named indoor and outdoor NCAA Regional Coach of the Year.\n\n1990 Men's Soccer Team - Class of 2015\n\nBuilding off a final four appearance the previous season, the 1990 Rutgers men's soccer team advanced all the way to the national championship game that resulted in a penalty kick shootout. The Scarlet Knights ended the season at 20-3-2 as they knocked off previously unbeaten and No.1 ranked Evansville to reach the championship match. A first-half goal by Mike Miller would be the only scoring in the match, but also the 15th shutout of the year for the Scarlet Knights and the second number one team to fall to Rutgers in 1990. The Scarlet Knights also dominated top-ranked UCLA in the MetLife Classic and followed with 600 minutes of shutout soccer to close out the regular season.\n\nThe 20 victories earned by the team under head coach Bob Reasso, which included a win over Penn State to claim its first Atlantic 10 title, still remain an RU record. Steve Rammel, the team's leading scorer with 43 points and ninth-ranked Scarlet Knight with 84 career points, was the runner-up for the Hermann Award and goalkeeper Bill Andracki was named an All-American after shutting out Dartmouth, Evansville and UCLA in the year's final three contests. Alexi Lalas, who recovered from a ruptured appendix early in the season, and Jeff Zaun were All-Region selections from a defense ranked second nationally in goals allowed, as was David Mueller, the Scarlet Knight that scored the game-winner in the Atlantic 10 championship game. Lino DiCuollo, who assisted on Miller's game-winner that gave the Scarlet Knights a chance to play for a national title, was an All-Atlantic 10 selection.\n\n1982 Women's Basketball Team - Class of 1993\n\nIt was this team that put together a 25-7 record, remained in the top 10 all season and captured the only national championship in Rutgers' basketball history. The team silenced critics that felt that the loss of All-American center Kris Kirchner and Wade Trophy finalist Joanne Burke, in addition to the uncertainty of June Olkowski's knee injury, would be too much for the team to handle.\n\n1975-76 Men's Basketball Team - Class of 1999\n\nThe story of the 1975-76 team has been told and re-told for 20 years. The number of people who claim to have been in the 2,800-seat College Avenue Gym on March 1, 1976, the night RU sealed the perfect season with an 85-80 win over St. Bonaventure, is in the hundreds of thousands. As was the case so many times before, paint chips fell from the ceiling that night, caused by the tremendous, vibrating noise and the heat generated in the building. The names on that team still resonate within the minds of all Rutgers fans; Sellers, Dabney, Copeland, Jordan, Bailey, Anderson, Conlin, Hefele, Scherer, Klienbaum, Palko and Nance. That team pressed and ran opponents right out of the gym on a nightly basis. In an era without the three-point shot, the team broke the 90-point barrier 25 times, the century mark on 11 occasions. The constant defensive pressure applied would often dictate an opponent mistake and an ensuing long pass and, ultimately, an open layup. Sellers to Dabney to Jordan - A blur of uniforms streaking to the hoop. That team won its first 31 games, made an appearance in the NCAA Final Four in Philadelphia, featured a National Coach of the Year and included five of the seven leading scorers in Rutgers history. It was a magical time, a magical season. The achievements of that team have been well-told. They will be told again and again.\n\n1970 Men's Track & Field Sprint Medley Team - Class of 2013\n\nJohn Herma, Jim Smith, Tom Ulan and Robert Kerr comprised the Rutgers sprint medley relay team that captured the Scarlet Knights' first track national championship. In 1970, the Scarlet Knight quartet won gold at the AAU Championship at Madison Square Garden. Coached by the late Les Wallach, the Scarlet Knights captured the winning time of 1:53.4, surpassing competitors that included former Olympians, post-graduates and non-collegiate track runners. Tom Ulan ran the 440 yard leg, John Herma ran the 100 yard leg, Jim Smith ran the 220 yard leg and Rob Kerr ran the 300 yard leg. In the same year, the Rutgers relay team also captured the mile relay title at the prestigious Baltimore Sun Paper Games Indoor Track Meet.\n\n1961 Rutgers Football Team - Class of 2014\n\nRutgers enjoyed its first undefeated season in program history in 1961, when the team went 9-0, capping the season with a 25-point comeback victory over Columbia. That team included All-American center Alex Kroll, and was ranked No. 15 nationally. An Associated Press First Team All-American in 1961, Kroll, who was also a top-notch linebacker, was regarded as the finest center in the nation. Head coach John Bateman was in his second season of 13 seasons at the helm of the Rutgers program in 1961 when he guided the Knights to the unblemished mark.\n\nQuarterbacks Sam Mudie and Bill Speranza directed the offense, with Mudie totaling 703 yards of offense and Speranza going for 318 yards through the air. Mudie took home the Homer Hazel Award as the team's most valuable player that season. Fullback Steve Simms led the rushing attack with 614 yards on the ground. He earned Honorable Mention Associated Press All-America honors that season. One of Simms' most notable accomplishments was his go-ahead touchdown against Columbia in the season finale to preserve the undefeated season. Pierce Frauenheim also secured the win against the Lions with a pair of interceptions.\n\nThe 1961 squad relied heavily on its rushing attack with 1,968 of its 2,612 yards of total offense that season on the ground. Rutgers and Alabama were the only undefeated teams in the nation that year.\n\nAlton \"Al\" Adler - Men's Basketball - Class of 1995\n\nAl Adler, a 1931 Rutgers graduate, played for the Scarlet Knights from 1928-1931. He was the second-leading scorer on the 1928-29 team, which compiled a 10-5 record. Known as an aggressive defensive player, the Bayonne, NJ native was one of the top players for Rutgers in the 1920's. In fact, the current Rutgers defensive player of the year award is named after Adler. Adler was a member of the 1928-29 team, which was the first Rutgers team to defeat CCNY, a team that was coached by the legendary Nat Holman. Following his playing career, Adler became a prominent fixture in the Rutgers athletic scene. He served on the Board of Trustees for 20 years, was a member of the President's Council, was president of the Rutgers Alumni Association and served as the treasurer of the class of 1931.\n\nJohn Alexander - Football - Class of 1992\n\nAlexander achieved honorable mention All-America honors in 1975. A first-team All-East selection in 1976, he teamed with Hall of Famer Nate Toran to head a Scarlet defense which was first in the nation in rushing defense, total defense and scoring defense. Alexander played on teams that amassed a 33-10-1 record, including the 11-0 mark in 1976. He was drafted by the Miami Dolphins, but he had a short-lived professional career due to injuries.\n\nRonald \"Ron\" Allen - Football - Class of 2008\n\nAllen, a standout member of the Rutgers secondary and return specialist from 1988 to 1991, was inducted into the Rutgers Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

Allen earned First Team Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) All-Star Honors as a senior with a team-high three interceptions and seven passes defended in seven games. That season, he helped guide RU to a 6-5 record in its inaugural season in the BIG EAST Conference. Nicknamed \"Rocket,\" Allen also served as a return specialist where he averaged more than 25 yards per return to rank 14th in the nation his junior season in 1990. He had three career touchdowns on kickoff returns. Against West Virginia as a freshman in 1988, he returned a kickoff 92 yards and later that season, returned a kickoff 94 yards against Cincinnati for a touchdown. During his junior season in 1990, Allen returned a kickoff 82 yards for a touchdown against Colgate. Allen received First Team Associated Press All-EAST honors along with First Team ECAC All-Star laurels as a return specialist his junior season. The versatile athlete was the recipient of the program's 12th Man Award as a junior, honoring him as the special teams player of the year. More than 15 years later on the eve of his induction into the Hall of Fame, Allen still ranked fifth in Rutgers history with 1,283 career kickoff return yards, and seventh with 51 career kickoff returns.\n\nDoug Alongi - Baseball - Class of 2018\n\nHall of Fame Focus Feature\n\nA native of Spotswood and graduate of St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, Doug Alongi is one of just two players in Rutgers baseball history to be named first team all-conference three times, one of four to earn a conference player of the year distinction and still holds the program career record with 85 stolen bases. The leadoff hitter, who joined the team as a walk-on, was named All-America in 1993 after hitting .371 with nine home runs, 86 hits, 18 doubles, 45 RBIs, 39 stolen bases and 143 total bases.\n\nHis signature moment came in the 1993 Atlantic 10 Championship Game against West Virginia when he blasted a three-run homer on an 0-2 pitch to tie the game in the bottom of the ninth, earning him tournament Most Outstanding Player. The Scarlet Knights would go on to walk off to overcome a five-run deficit starting the inning, making it two tournament titles (1991 and 1993), three regular season championships (1991-93) and two NCAA Tournament berths (1991 and 1993) during Alongi's three seasons that saw the team finish 103-58-2.\n\nIn addition to holding the career stolen base mark, Alongi left as the program single-season leader in runs (62), hits (86), total bases (143) and steals (39) during the memorable 1993 campaign in which he earned Atlantic 10 Player of the Year. The Chicago Cubs selected the outfielder in the 1993 draft.\n\nRobert Amabile - Men's Track & Field - Class of 1997\n\nAmabile was considered to be one of America's top javelin throwers in his time at Rutgers. In 1987, he finished fourth at the NCAA Championships, earning All-America status. That effort capped a year in which he was ranked as the top javelin thrower in college. Also in 1987, he won the javelin event at the prestigious IC4A Championships and the Penn Relays Carnival. He was a four-time Metropolitan Champion as well as a three-time All-East performer. Amabile also won the 1984 Pan American Junior Championships. Amabile, who collected a host of meet championships throughout his career, held the school record in the javelin for nearly a decade.

In his four seasons, Anderson played on teams which made two NCAA and two NIT appearances. Those teams were a combined 95-28, the best four-season mark in school history. He was an unsung contributor as a freshman to the Scarlet Knights' magical 1975-76 season. Coming off the bench as the sixth man, the lithe 6-7 Anderson averaged 9.4 points per game during that 31-2 season when the Scarlet Knights won their first 31 games and finished the season ranked fourth in the nation. Anderson, employing a distinctive and unorthodox jump shot, was the consummate team player. As a sophomore, he tallied 15.2 points per game when the Knights went 18-10 and made the NIT. His junior year, the Belleville, N.J., native averaged 12.3 points an outing in helping to lead the Scarlet Knights to a 24-7 record and to a third-place finish in the NIT. He capped his career by averaging 11.8 as a senior, second on the team to All-American James Bailey, as the Knights compiled a 22-9 record and a berth in the NCAA Tournament.
