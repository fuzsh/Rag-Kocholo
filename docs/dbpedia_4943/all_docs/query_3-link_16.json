        "text": "Seventy five years ago a boy was born here in Princeton, N.J.\n\nThe birthplace was the corner of Green and Witherspoon Streets, This boy was destined to emerge as one of the great Americans of the twentieth century. His name is Paul Leroy Robeson.\n\nAs a native of this community it is fitting that the story of his life be brought to you. You may never have heard of him as the history books invariably make no mention of his accomplishments, So it is a real pleasure for me to relate to you some of the things I have learned.\n\nAs I have mentioned Paul Robeson was born here in Princeton. His father, William D. Robeson, was pastor of the Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church, Reverend Robeson exerted a tremendous influence on his youngest son who was so proud of his father. He tells of his feeling for his father and the other members of his family in his book \"Here I Stand\", Also of his youthful days here in Princeton. The Robeson family moved to Somerville when Paul was twelve years old, It was at Somerville that I grew to know him personally and began to realize what an outstanding person he was, But what I say here today is not only my thoughts. I will also quote from his book \"Here I Stand\" and from many others who became intimate with him and who realized his greatness. Also I would like to point out the extreme brevity of this talk. If my few words excite an interest in you, I suggest further explorations into the life of Paul Robeson. It will truly be an inspiration.\n\nRobeson was a sensational athlete, At Rutgers University where he was only the third Negro to graduate, he played on their football team for four years. In those days there was really only one recognized All American team. This was Walter Camp's. Twice Robeson was selected, the years 1917 and 1918. He also starred in basketball, baseball and track. he earned a total of twelve letters during his four years at Rutgers. He was a member of the debating team, received his Phi Beta Kappa key and delivered the commencement oration. His years at Rutgers were memorable.\n\nAnd Just this Spring, 54 years after he had left that seat of learning, he was recognized as Rutgers most illustrious alumnus. A seven day symposium was held at the Student Center. A series of events commemorating Robeson's accomplishments on the stage and screen, in scholarship and on the athletic field. The Campus Center Building was renamed after Robe,on. Edward J, Blaustein, President of Rutgers University, said in his dedication speech \"I declare this building the Paul Robe,on Campus Center to stand for all time in honor of a man for all time\".\n\nIt was during the era when the accomplishments of memorable figures in sports still live in memory that Paul Robeson's feats have become legendary. Figures like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb in Baseball, Red Granger in football. Big Bill Tilden in tennis, Robert Jones in golf, Jack Dempsey in boxing and Nat Holman in basketball. It was this fantastic era in the history of athletics that Paul Robeson rose to fame.\n\nAfter Paul graduated from Rutgers in 1919 he prepared for law at Columbia University, But his plans as a lawyer went up in smoke. He had excelled - yet failed. Bigotry and intolerance prevented him from continuing the practice of law. He would have become a great lawyer. But it is fortunate for the world that he turned to other fields of endeavor.\n\nIt was at this time that he became associated with Eugene O'Neil, the playwrite, who saw his possibilities as an actor. The Provincetown Players decided to introduce Paul Robe,on to the public in the role of Emperor Jones. This was a demanding and arduous role. He would be on the stage alone for five consecutive scenes, This would have been an exacting test for the most experienced actor. And only a short period before, Paul had never walked across a stage. Paul drove himself with relentless fury. He was determined that this was his future. And the audience answered whatever misgivings he had. They applauded wildly. The critics rushed to write reviews. Here are a few.\n\n\"Robeson adds to his extraordinary physique a shrewd understanding\".\n\n\"A voice the like of which is rarely heard\".\n\nAnd so when Eugene O'Neill's \"All God's Chillen Got Wings\" opened the public were anxious again to see Paul Robeson. The critics again were enthusiastic. I will quote from George Jean Nathan's review, \"Rob, son, with relatively little experience and with no training to speak of, is one of the most thoroughly eloquent impressive and convincing actors that I have looked at and listened to in almost 20 years of professional theatre going\".\n\nIt was about this time that Rob, son went on the concert stage. Again I quote from a critic, Glenn Dillard Gunn, writing in the Chicago Herald Examiner said \"I have just heard the finest of all voices and one of the most beautiful in the world, Those who were fortunate to be present last night at Orchestra Hall will testify that I do not exaggerate. In the soft resonance, in sympathetic appeal, in its organ like ease and power, it is distinguished among the great voices of the times\".\n\nBecause of his great appeal Hollywood drafted him for work in motion pictures. Of the dozen or so films he made, two of them he was proud of. One was \"Proud Valley\" and the other was \"Song of Freedom\". Most of the films did not satisfy him. Let me quote him. \"I thought I could do something for the Negro race in films - show the truth about them and about other people, too. I used to do my part and go away feeling satisfied, thought everything O.K. Well, it wasn't. The film industry is not prepared to permit me to portray the life or express the living interests, hopes and aspirations of the struggling people from whom I come. They never let me play a part in a film in which a Negro is on top\".\n\nOne of his greatest triumphs on the stage was the Shakespeare production of Othello in 1943, The play ran for 296 performances to set an all-time record for any Shakespearian play on Broadway. Robeson received the Donaldson Award for the best acting performance; And the Gold Medal for the best diction in the American Theatre, presented by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nHe made a great number of recordings, one of which was the Memorable Ballad for Americans in 1939. Here are Just a few lines of this ballad sung by Robeson on C.B.S. Pursuit of Happiness Program.\n\n\"Man in white skin can never be free\n\nWhile his black brother is in slavery.\n\nOut of the cheating, out of the shouting,\n\nOut of the windbags, the patriotic spouting,\n\nOut of uncertainty and doubting,\n\nOut of the carpet-bag and brass spittoon,\n\nIt will come again - our marching song will come again,\n\nSimple as a hit tune, deep as our valleys,\n\nHigh as our mountains, strong as the people who made it\".\n\nIt seemed that thousands of Americans had been waiting for a rallying cry to make them proud of their heritage. Tumultuous applause - stamping, shouting and screaming - reached the listeners sitting at home as Robeson's voice faded softly into silence.\n\nRobeson's audiences constantly increased in size until on June 23rd, 1941, 14000 people heard him sing at New York's Lewisohn Stadium. Now, when he was scaling to unprecendented heights of fame, he sought to aid his own people in those areas most vital to their existence - to improve wages, hours, living conditions, and to abolish discrimination in employment and education.\n\nIt was in this atmosphere that Paul Robeson set out on an extensive concert tour which carried him across the country. Everywhere he went he heard disturbing talk. The much talked-of public housing scheme which was so desperately needed by all low-income families and particularly by Negro families, remained a castle in the air. He heard many stories of police brutality against Negroes; while in the South the number of lynchings was increasing at an alarming rate.\n\nThese things had an intense effect upon Robeson and he spoke out boldly protesting the outrages committed against his people. While in Russia he was received as a great artist and as a friend. He found no distinction of color in the land. He was impressed. later on he was to send his son to be educated there. A large mountain was renamed after him. It is called Robeson Mount. So he was impressed with the friendliness and lack of discrimination. He was moved to make this statement. \"It is unthinkable that American Negroes could go to war on behalf of those who have oppressed us for generations against the Soviet Union, which, in one generation, has raised our people to full human dignity\".\n\nSo the wrath of those men in power was brought down on Robeson. Halls were closed to him, he was pilloried by Congressional Committees, his statements were either suppressed or distorted from their original meanings; and finally, after silencing his voice in this country, his passport to travel abroad was revoked at a time when his popularity and prestige around the world were at an all-time high.\n\nSomeone once said that Paul Robeson would not be appreciated in his life time. But ages, yet unborn will be the recipients of his wisdom, his talent and his genius. He hated and feared militarism and was a man of peace in a world that did not contain peace. He was attacked as a radical and maligned for having friends that were Communists and for speaking out boldly for peace in the world and social justice for all people.\n\nBut those who said he would not be appreciated in his life time were mistaken. Listen to this list of awards given to him during the last three years:\n\n- Fiftieth Anniversary Award by the Civil Liberties Union.\n\n- Pioneer in Black Achievement from the Black Cultural and Business Exposition.\n\n- Dedication of the Paul Robeson Campus Center Award at Rutgers University.\n\n- The Solomon Fuller Award for contributions to promoting the Mental Health of Black Americans from the Black Psychiatrists of America.\n\n- Ebony Magazine lists Paul Robeson among the Ten Greats of Black History.\n\n- Whitney M. Young Jr National Memorial Award for the New York Urban League.\n\n- Ellington Medal from the Yale Ellington Fellowship Program.\n\n- Theatre Hall of Fame.\n\n- A new Hall of Fame for black athletes was established this year and Paul Robeson was named to it with six other football spars\n\n- Doctor of Human Letters Degree awarded to Robeson recently by Rutgers University. The citation said, in part \"Grandson of slaves you have been called the tallest tree in our forest and your voice the finest musical instrument wrought by nature in our time. After a period of neglect, too long contributed to and countenanced by Rutgers University, we return to you with this degree some small portion of that great honor you have brought to us\".\n\n- In February and April of this year Paul Robeson's 75th birthday was celebrated at Carnegie Hall in New York City by two sold-out audiences, Many famous people were there to extol the man they felt was so deserving of acclaim.\n\n- Somerville, where Paul grew to young manhood, also celebrated his 75th birthday. Dean Douglas Brown of Princeton University, who was a classmate of Paul's at Somerville, spoke at these ceremonies. Dean Brown, who is now retired and resides here in Princeton, said on that occasion \"It was a rich experience to have four years in school with as great a human being as Paul Robeson -- to have him as a warm and loyal friend; to have him as a fellow student who was already showing the brilliance of genius as an all-around athlete, as a debater, as a singer, and as an actor, and who could, at the same time, make one push very hard to keep up with him in a tough academic course\".\n\nAlso in connection with the Somerville celebration, a communication was received from President Edward J. Bloustein of Rutgers University. It said \"It is a pleasure for me to have this opportunity to join you in paying tribute to a great American who through his world wide acclaim brought honor and esteem to Rutgers University. Paul Robeson is a scholar and outstanding athlete and one of the greatest singers and actors in the country. But Paul Robeson is even more than these. Paul Robeson is a man of great integrity and compassion whose dedication to social justice Is an example for us all, Please extend my best wishes to the citizens of Somerville for this celebration in honor of your former neighbor\".\n\nSigned EDWARD J. BLOUSTEIN, PRESIDENT RUTGERS UNIV.\n\nI have here a copy of a speech made at Carnegie Hall by Judge George W. Crockett of Michigan. This was on February 16th of this year. The occasion was the commemoration of Paul Robeson's 75th birthday. To me it is so significant and soul-stirring that I am reading a portion of it.\n\n(Judge Crockett's speech)\n\nPaul Robeson is still alive but ailing. He resides with his sister in her home in Philadelphia. I hope that my remarks to you today have been interesting, enlightening and inspiring. I have tried to make them just that. Thank you for the opportunity"
