        "text": "District 35 is home to more than forty co-named streets that honor deceased residents who made a significant impact on their community. The Department of Transportation (DOT) oversees a process by which New Yorkers can petition to “co-name” a street. While the street retains its original name, DOT installs a sign beneath the original street sign to “co-name” the street in an individual’s honor.\n\nTypically, co-naming requests begin at the local community board, which votes on whether to approve the co-naming application. Each community board has their own requirements, including how long an individual must be deceased (ranging from 6 months to 3 years), total number of petition signatures, and letters of support. You can review the requirements for Community Board 2 (Ft. Greene/Clinton Hill), Community Board 8 (Prospect Heights/Crown Heights North), and Community Board 9 (Crown Heights South) at each link.\n\nOnce the community board approves the co-naming application, a letter of approval is sent to the local Council Member, including all materials submitted with the application. The co-naming request is then submitted for inclusion in bi-annual legislation that is then voted on by the full Council, and usually signed into law (though it could be vetoed by the mayor). Once approved, the Council office and requester work with the DOT to select a date for the sign’s installation. DOT installs one sign, provides one replica sign for the requestor’s family, and offers additional signs for purchase for $32 plus shipping and handling. Should you have specific questions about the co-naming process, please feel free to email us at district35@council.nyc.gov or by phone at (718) 260-9191.\n\nThe following list includes all identified street co-namings in District 35 found on the New York City Council’s Legistar website. If you know that we have missed one, feel free to email District 35 with the honoree’s name, sign location, and a photograph of the sign (if you are able).\n\nAll biographies are those sent to the New York City Council and included in the Committee Report for each co-naming bill. If a biography was not available, staff compiled one using public records with hyperlinks provided to indicate sourcing.\n\nThis list is current as of July 2024.\n\nSaheed Vassel Way, 2025*\n\nAhmad Samhan Way, 2024\n\nDr. Beny J.

The responding officers were not charged for his death.\n\n*This co-naming sign has not yet been installed. A ceremony is tentatively planned for 2025\n\nAhmad Samhan Way\n\nHall Street (Between Myrtle Avenue and Willoughby Avenue), 2024\n\n(Photo Credit: Myrtle Avenue Brooklyn Partnership)\n\nAhmad Samhan (May 22, 1969 – June 21, 2020) was a longtime resident and business entrepreneur of Fort Greene, Brooklyn. He was born in a small village in Palestine and later migrated to Brooklyn, New York in March 1973. He resided on Vanderbilt Ave between Myrtle and Park for over 30 years before starting a family of his own in his childhood home. Inspired by fellow Brooklyn residents, Ahmad was determined to be the true definition of an American-Arab pioneer. From the age of 13, he began to work so that he may provide additional income for his family. His earliest business ventures varied from delivering newspapers door-to-door in the neighborhood, to selling water bottles on the street, to washing car windows at the gas station formerly located on Vanderbilt Avenue, to working as a bag boy at the Met Food supermarket on Myrtle Avenue. Many people in the neighborhood recall his inviting smile and incredible sense of humor.\n\nAside from his remarkable work ethic, he was known in the community for his impressive intellect. As a student at Samuel J. Tilden high school, he was a member of the school band and played the French horn. After graduating high school in 1987, he obtained his baccalaureate at John Jay College in Criminal Justice. Although very fond of and well versed in criminology and justice, he found his niche as an entrepreneur instead. He went on to own over eight businesses in his lifetime, two of which were on Myrtle Avenue. Paying homage to his Palestinian roots, Ahmad opened his first restaurant ‘Zaytoons’ in Carroll Gardens in 1995. Following the immediate success of that location, Ahmad was able to open a second location in his own backyard on Myrtle Avenue. Of all his businesses across Brooklyn, this location was always Ahmad’s favorite.\n\nHowever, as the neighborhood began to transform, Ahmad realized he too would have to adapt to the evolving neighborhood. After 15 years of serving the community Middle Eastern food, Ahmad converted Zaytoons into a taqueria in 2017. Villa Pancho would eventually close after his untimely passing in 2020. The neighborhood not only enjoyed his cuisines, they were acquainted with his exuberant personality. Ahmad was known for stopping anyone and talking to them. The bench in front of his business has encountered a multitude of conversations varying from common street banter to the deep and thought-provoking conversations that many people in the community expressed their gratitude for after his passing.\n\nIndifferent of age, religion, politics, race or beliefs, Ahmad always found a way to connect to the people he would converse with. He left an incredible impression on those who knew him. He was an extraordinary man who could relate to anyone who interacted with him. He was best described as a wealth of knowledge, always able to relate and understand anyone he happened upon. He spent many days sitting on the bench in front of his restaurant talking to his neighbors and bringing joy to their lives as they brought joy to his. He cared for the community that contributed to his upbringing and constantly reminded everyone around him to always give back to their local communities as it is what shapes the future generations. He spent his life in service to his community, from his lunch donations to Brooklyn Hospital and SUNY Downstate Hospital in appreciation of our healthcare heroes on the frontlines of the pandemic to his annual dinners, made by him personally, in Ramadan at the local mosque on Fulton Street.\n\nEmily Ann Myrick Way\n\nSouthwest corner of Park Avenue and Carlton Avenue, 2024\n\n(Photo Credit: Community Heroes)\n\nEmily Ann Myrick was known as “A Mother To All” who cared for children at PS 46 and all 22 of her children and grandchildren. She was able to obtain her master’s degree at the age of 71. She was a guidance counselor at PS 46 and served as president of Fort Greene Houses for many years. She fought for many programs and resources for the Fort Greene community. She was the president of the Tenant Association and fought for buildings to be clean and safe. She volunteered at the Little Zion Baptist Church for over 70 years and advocated strongly against the closing of Cumberland Hospital, which was in the largest public housing complex in Brooklyn. She also served as assistant to the executive director of Cumberland Hospital and deputy executive director of the Fort Greene Community Corporation.\n\nDr. Beny J. Primm Way\n\nFulton Street (Between Waverly Avenue and Washington Avenue), 2024\n\n(Photo Credit: HIV.gov)\n\nDr. Beny J. Primm (May 21, 1928 – October 16, 2015) was a doctor who started some of New York City’s first methadone clinics to treat heroin addicts and advocated for changing public health policy toward intravenous drug users during the AIDS epidemic. He served in the United States Army’s 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg and trained as a paratrooper. In 1969, he founded the Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation, which opened methadone clinics in Brooklyn and Manhattan. He was an advocate for clean-needle programs and information campaigns during the AIDS epidemic. He was appointed to Ronald Reagan’s Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic in 1987. He served on the National Drug Abuse Advisory Council, associate administrator of the Office of Treatment Improvement and was president of the Urban Resource Institute, which he founded in 1981 to provide career counseling and job training for addicts and to provide a safe haven for victims of domestic violence.\n\nJames Caldwell Way\n\nDean Street and Washington Avenue, 2024\n\n(Photo Credit: Kings County Politics)\n\nJames Caldwell (Died May 27, 2021) served in the United States Army for six years. He served as president of the 77th Precinct Council and former executive director of Brooklyn United for Innovative Local Development, an organization designed to implement the community benefits agreement for the then Atlantic Yards Development Project. He served as the board chairperson for the North Crown Heights Family Outreach Center to help families with drug and alcohol addiction and served as president of the Brooklyn House Community Relations Board, a halfway house to assist people recently released from prison to integrate back into society. He also served as chairperson of the Ryerson Street Veterans Committee which successfully stopped the loss of vital services to over 3,000 Black and Latino Veterans in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\nThe English Way\n\nNew York Avenue (Between President Street and Union Street), 2024\n\n(Photo Credit: Community Heroes)\n\nDr. Josephine English (December 17, 1920 – December 18, 2011) moved to Brooklyn in 1956 after graduating from medical school and working in Manhattan. She opened a women’s clinic in Bushwick and delivered thousands of babies, including the daughter of former United States Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, and the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz. In 1979, she established the Adelphi Medical Center to provide better medical care to both men and women and later added a senior citizens’ center. In 1981, she started the Up the Ladder Day Care Center and After School Program and a summer youth camp. In 1982, in an effort to bring more of the arts to the community, she purchased a deserted church next to the Adelphi Medical Center and converted it into Brooklyn’s Paul Robeson Theater. In 1986, she became the first minority and the first woman to be awarded a license from the New York State Department of Health to develop a free-standing ambulatory surgical center. She self-funded many of her programs and had to continuously fight foreclosure. She received several awards, including the African Community Contribution Award and a Lucille Mason Rose Community Activist Award. In 1996, the Dr. Josephine English Foundation was established in order to honor her and to carry on her health and welfare initiatives.\n\nEdward A. Carter Way\n\nNorth Portland Avenue (Between Myrtle Avenue and Park Avenue), 2023\n\n(Photo Credit: Patch)\n\nEdward A. Carter (1933 – 2011) served the Fort Greene community for many years. He served in the United States Military in 1950 with the 715th AA Battalion. He received several commendations of merit and four honorable discharges, one from the Army and three from the Air Force. He founded and served as executive director of the Fort Greene Youth Patrol, which was established in 1968 and served hundreds of inner city youth, young adults, and senior citizens, was a founding board member of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and participated for over 20 years, served as chairman of the Parks and Public Safety Committee for Community Board 2 for 20 years, was co-founder and vice chairman of the Fort Greene Senior Citizens Council, served as chairman of the Veterans Association’s Civic Affairs Committee, founded Fort Greene Memorial Post 1908 of the American Legion, founder and board chairman of the Wonderland Day Care Center, president of the Walt Whitman Tenants Association from 1968 to 1976, president of the Resident Advisory Council for New York City Public Housing in 1970, executive board member of Cumberland Diagnostic & Treatment Center, served 26 years on Selective Service Draft Board #145 in Brooklyn and was vice president of the Black Cowboys for more than 15 years.\n\nJoyce Quamina’s Way\n\nAt the intersection of President Street and Nostrand Avenue, 2023\n\n(Photo Credit: WIADCA)\n\nJoyce Quamina steered WIADCA organization for over 40 years, was affiliated with the carnival group, more than twenty of which she served as business manager. She was director of judges for more than 20 years. During her tenure, she implemented the Children’s Carnival and, along with Marta Vega, developed the Stay in School Concert, now known as Youth-fest. She also started the Jamboree at Brooklyn’s Boys and Girls High School, as a fundraiser for the Mas’ and Steelband groups, where artists donated their time. She negotiated for the Daily News to sponsor CASYM Steel Orchestra and provided educational scholarships to the youth. As a cultural ambassador, she represented WIADCA and supported other carnival groups in Toronto, Miami, Boston, New Jersey, Washington DC and Baltimore. She spent time mentoring youth, community members and prison inmates about Caribbean culture. Over the years, she continued to support the organization as co-chair of the Steelband Committee, assisting the groups to get practice space, and worked alongside the NYPD on sensitive cultural and community matters affecting them. She was dedicated to WIADCA and all its members and enjoyed sharing her knowledge of the early days. She was a spectator of the original West Indian American parades in Harlem, and became an active participant when the parade began in Brooklyn, stating that she was the founder and organizer of the Kiddies Carnival, an event in which children between the ages of infancy and sixteen participate in their own mas or masquerade parade. She was also a contributor to the Westchester County Caribbean Carnival in White Plains, New York. She was director and, thereafter, vice president of the Westchester Carnival; director of the Caribbean Muzik Festival in the Bahamas for 10 years; consultant for Western Union, the money transmitter, in past carnival events; vice president of the International Caribbean Carnival; and one of the founding members of the World Carnival Commission. Joyce was lectured and conducted carnival workshops at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, City University of New York; Hofstra University; Ossining Penitentiary; and Folsom Prison. The late Calos Lezama, the founder and former WIADCA president, had recognized her organizational skills and expanded her role to include business manager. After over 30 years of service, she tendered her resignation from WIADCA. In 2010, she recommissioned to coordinate what is the most difficult event on the carnival calendar, the Steelband Panorama, which she successfully did for the last 10 years.\n\nTomchei Temimim Way\n\nCrown Street (Between Troy Avenue and Albany Avenue), 2023\n\n(Photo Credit: Office of Council Member Crystal Hudson)\n\nLocated at 570 Crown St, the United Lubavitcher Yeshiva, also known as Tomchei Temimim, occupies most of Albany Avenue and is recognizable as the “red brick building with tinted windows” in the center of Crown Heights. Established in 1897 in Russia by Rabbi Shalom DovBer, the fifth Chabad Rebbe, the yeshiva survived through various upheavals and wars, relocating to Warsaw and later Otwock, Poland, and finally to Shanghai, China during World War II. The previous Lubavitcher Rabbi founded Tomchei Temimim of America in 1940, immediately upon arriving in America, having just escaped war-torn Europe. He encouraged the continuation of Jewish life, traditions and culture in America, and the roots of the school that were planted on that day bore fruits that helped rebuild the broken Jewish community shattered by the Holocaust. In 1988, the grand Lubavitcher Rebbe called for the construction of more housing and cultural, educational, and community facilities, which led to the construction of the iconic 570 Crown Street building, which opened in 1992.\n\nFor over thirty years, this building has serviced tens of thousands of children in our community. It has hosted thousands of community events including bar mitzvahs, engagements, community awareness programs, conventions and much more. Recently, during the COVID 19 pandemic, when the building was not able to service the children we retrofitted the school to be a rehabilitation center for the many people recovering from the pandemic. Currently, the facility is adding an additional 21,000 square feet to include more classrooms, resource rooms, mental health offices, staff lounges, a recreation room, a new synagogue and gym. The new gym will service the community with after school programs, children leagues and occupational outlets.\n\nEudes Pierre Way\n\nEastern Parkway and Utica Avenue, 2022\n\n(Photo Credit: College of Staten Island Athletics)\n\nEudes Pierre (Died December 20, 2021) was shot and killed after allegedly charging at police officers with a knife during an apparent mental health episode. His death has brought attention to mental health awareness.\n\nDr. Sam Pinn Jr. Way\n\nFulton Street (Between Grand Avenue and Cambridge Place), 2021\n\n(Photo Credit: Our Time Press)\n\nDr. Sam Pinn Jr. (Died December 27, 2017) was born in Rice, Virginia and later moved to New York to become a life-long resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He served in the United States Army Reserves for eight years and was honorably discharged with the rank of Lieutenant. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from Morgan State University, a Masters of Social Work Degree from Rutgers University, and two Doctors of Law degrees bestowed by Mary Holmes College and Morgan State University. He was also a Licensed Master of Social Work (LMSW) in the State of New York. In May 1973, he helped found and then served as Chairman of the Fort Greene Council Inc. Under his leadership, the Council expanded its sponsorship of senior centers, offering a range of comprehensive services, from their first center located in Fort Greene-Clinton Hills to its present sponsorship of 13 centers located throughout Brooklyn.

Significant to world history, the Haitian Revolution is not only the first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas, but also resulted in Haiti being the first Latin American country and second in the Western Hemisphere to declare its independence, after the United States declared independence from Britain in 1776. Furthermore, the Haitian Revolution was inspirational and gave support to the enslaved and subjugated peoples throughout the world. More significantly, the Haitian Revolution was a truly transcultural event, joining three interlocking and intersectional 18th Century struggles, which continue to reverberate to the present: the challenge to imperial European authority; the fight for racial equality and the movement to end to slavery. Jean-Jacques Dessalines was born into slavery in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. In 1791, he joined the fight for freedom when thousands of brutally exploited enslaved people rose up against their colonial masters, and their enablers in France, who murdered and massacred hundreds of thousands of people across the Caribbean. By 1793, he was fighting under General Toussaint Louverture, earning the nickname “the Tiger” for his intensity in battle and his military skill. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794. From 1794 through 1802, Dessalines fought with Louverture both for and against France for the eradication of slavery and the self-determination of the people of Saint-Domingue.\n\nAfter Louverture was kidnapped, shackled and deported to France in 1802, Dessalines led the Revolution, as Napoleon appointed General Rochambeau to lead the French military expedition to re-conquer Saint-Domingue. Rochambeau immediately embarked on a massacre of much of the non-white civilians, including women and children, and military population by staging mass executions via firing squads, hanging and drowning. By January 1, 1804, the French were defeated and Dessalines declared Haiti independent. Between February and April 1804, Dessalines, in response to French brutality and out of fear of future French re-conquest and re-enslavement ordered the execution of all the remaining white French on the island, estimated in the range of 3,000 to 5,000, but personally protected whites loyal to Haitian independence, including thousands of Polish soldiers who had defected from the French Army. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) became the first slave revolt in modern history to result in an independent nation.\n\nThe independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States, and encouraged republican revolutions in Latin America, and eventually Africa. Under Petion, Haiti provided direct assistance to Simon Bolivar on at least two crucial occasions during the latter’s successful efforts to secure independence for the Spanish Colonial territories throughout Latin America. Dessalines was declared Emperor of Haiti in September 1804. Many of the policies he implemented were progressive even by today’s standards, including social policies, such as freedom of religion, equal rights for children born out of wedlock, marriage and divorce laws favorable to women. Dessalines also attempted land reforms, and specifically policies to address the concentration of ownership of valuable plantations throughout the country by a few wealthy families, which likely led to his death in a roadside ambush on October 17, 1806, when those who opposed his economic policies rebelled and took up arms against him. Jean-Jacques Dessalines remains a popular symbol of Haitian nationalism. The first capital of independent Haiti was renamed “Dessalines”; the national anthem of Haiti is named after him (“La Dessalinienne”); and his image appears on the 250 Haitian gourde note.\n\nDr. Solly Walker Way\n\nIrving Place (Between Putnam Avenue and Gates Avenue), 2017\n\n(Photo Credit: Saint John’s University Athletics)\n\nSolly Walker (April 9, 1932 – April 28, 2017) was the first African-American basketball player for St. John’s University who played from 1951-1954.

She lived on Lincoln Place between Classon and Washington Avenues for over 40 years, and fought hard to maintain the integrity of the neighborhood by speaking out against employment and housing discrimination, and battled to keep the Franklin Avenue Shuttle from being dismantled. In addition to fighting for our institutions, she also fought for individual residents, attempting to make sure they were not taken advantage of.\n\nMs. Dubin was a true leader, both by words and by example. She fostered in the community during her time on the Board, a lasting desire for positive change. Her fiery temperament and desire to voice her opinion to those that needed to hear it, made Ms. Dubin the community legend that she has become today.\n\nJames E.

Davis (April 3, 1962 – July 23, 2003) dedicated his life to stopping violence in urban America, particularly violence in urban communities in New York City. Councilman James E. Davis was born in 1962, graduated from Samuel Tilden High School in 1980 and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Pace University in 1989. Upon graduation, James Davis joined the New York City Corrections Department, serving for two years at Riker’s Island before joining the New York City Transit Department as a police officer. In 1993 he was transferred to the New York City Police Department and upon graduation was assigned to the 73rd Precinct in his home borough of Brooklyn, later teaching social science as a certified New York State instructor at the New York City Police Academy and a Youth Officer at the 69th Precinct in Canarsie, Brooklyn.\n\nPrior to elected office, he made many strides to combat negative influences on children in his community including his successful crusade against the largest toy manufacturer, Toys R Us, where he persuaded the company to stop selling toy guns that appeared real or could be modified to look like a real weapon; and campaigned against MTV’s daytime and evening music format, calling on the cable music station to stop showing videos during the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. that glorify violence. Since his campaign, MTV has publicly announced that they have made positive changes regarding the broadcast of music videos.\n\nBecause he was so committed to making a difference in the lives of urban youth, Councilman James E. Davis founded a voluntary, not-for-profit organization called “Love Yourself” Stop the Violence, dedicated to instilling the message of self-love, self-respect, respect for our communities and partnership between communities and police departments across America. The Stop the Violence events are attended by thousands of community residents and feature prominent and notable guests including three-time heavyweight boxing champion of the world, Evander Holyfield; recording superstars Salt-N-Pepa and many more. James Davis sought political office to put himself in a position to allocate resources to benefit the community.\n\nIn recognition of his hard work and dedication, James Davis was featured in several local and national newspapers including The New York Daily News, The New York Post, The New York Times and The Washington Post; as well as national cable network programs such as USA Live, The Maury Povich Show, Leeza and The Montell Williams Show, and offered his insightful wisdom on law enforcement and its effects on the relationship between communities and police departments on such programs as CNBC, CNN, BET and MSNBC.

Davis was honored as one of today’s heroes who exemplify the spirit and dedication of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by CBS television.\n\nOn July 23, 2003, during a Stated Council meeting at New York’s City Hall, Councilman James E.

Recently, this mecca has been enhanced by the addition of the 651 Arts Group and the Mark Morris Dance Group. The Mark Morris Dance Group has built an entire building from the ground up to house their internationally known troupe. In order to welcome these two additions to the community, and encourage other cultural programs to join them, Rockwell Place, between Lafayette Avenue and DeKalb Avenue, is proposed to be co-named The Street of Arts & Culture."
