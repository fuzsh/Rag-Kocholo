The publishers cannot and do not guarantee the correctness of all information furnished them nor the complete absence of errors or omissions, hence no responsibility for same can be or is assumed. The publishers earnestly request the bringing to their attention of any inaccuracy so that it may be corrected in the next edition of the directory.\n\nR. L. Polk & Co., Publishers\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAND\n\nGENERAL INDEX\n\nR. L. POLK & CO., publishers of more than 850 city, county, state and national Directories, present to subscribers and the general public, this, the 1959 edition of the Statesboro City Directory, which also includes Collegeboro and the rural routes emanating from the Statesboro Post Office.\n\nThis is the first Polk Directory of Statesboro, and is completely standardized according to the policies of the Association of North American Directory Publishers.\n\nConfidence in the growth of Statesboro's industry, population and wealth, and in the advancement of its civic and social activities, will be maintained as sections of this Directory are consulted, for the Directory is a mirror truly reflecting Statesboro to the world.\n\nThe enviable position occupied by R. L. POLK & CO.'S Directories in the estimation of the public throughout the country, has been established by rendering the best in Directory service. With an unrivaled organization, and having had the courteous and hearty cooperation of the business and professional men and residents, the publishers feel that their labors will meet with the approval of every user, and that the Statesboro Directory will fulfill its mission as a source of authentic information pertaining to the community.\n\nFour Major Departments\n\nI. THE YELLOW PAGES constitute the first major department of the Directory. This embraces a complete list of the names and addresses of the business and professional concerns of the city and vicinity, arranged in alphabetical order under the appropriate headings--a catalog of all the activities of the city and vicinity. Preceding this catalog, likewise grouped under appropriate headings, are the advertisements and business cards of firms and individuals desiring to present a more complete list of their products or services than is possible in the catalog itself. The Yellow Pages represent reference advertising at its best, and merit the attention of all buyers and sellers seeking sources of supply or markets for goods. In a progressive community like Statesboro, the necessity of having this kind of information up-to-date and always immediately available, is obvious. The Directory is the common intermediary between buyer and seller, and plays an important role in the daily activities of the commercial, industrial and professional world.\n\nII. THE ALPHABETICAL LIST OF NAMES of residents and business and professional concerns is the second major department, printed on white paper. This is the only record in existence that aims to show the name, marital status, occupation and address of each adult resident of Statesboro, Collegeboro, and on the Statesboro rural routes, and the name, official\n\nviii\n\nINTRODUCTION AND GENERAL INDEX\n\npersonnel, nature and address of each firm and corporation in the city.\n\nIII. THE DIRECTORY OF HOUSEHOLDERS, INCLUDING STREET AND AVENUE GUIDE is the third major department, printed on green paper. In this section the streets are arranged in order; named streets in alphabetical order, the numbers of the residences and business concerns are arranged in numerical order under the name of each street, and the names of the householders and concerns are placed opposite the numbers. The names of the intersecting streets appear at their respective crossing points on each street. Special features of this section are the designation of tenant-owned homes and the listing of telephone numbers.\n\nIV. THE NUMERICAL TELEPHONE DIRECTORY, printed on blue paper.\n\nCommunity Publicity\n\nThe Directory reflects the achievements and ambitions of the community, depicting in unbiased terms what it has to offer as a place of residence, as a business location, as a manufacturing site and as an educational center. To broadcast this information, the publishers have placed copies of this issue of the Directory in Directory Libraries, where they are readily available for free public reference, and serve as perpetual and reliable advertisements of Statesboro and vicinity.\n\nThere are more than 700 Directory Libraries, installed and maintained in the chief cities of the U. S. and Canada through the courtesy of members of the Association of North American Directory Publishers, under whose supervision the system is operated.\n\nThe publishers appreciatively acknowledge the recognition by those progressive business and professional men who have demonstrated their confidence in the City Directory as an advertising medium, with assurance that it will bring a commensurate return.\n\nR.

On November 8, 1801, George Seibald, a citizen of Augusta, Georgia signed a deed to the Bulloch County Commissioners giving 200 acres of land to be used as a county seat. A city was laid off in 1806, one acre was set laside for a court house and the other acres were sold to Bulloch county citizens eager to settle in their new county seat,: and Statesboro began a steady march toward the thriving city it is today.\n\nLocation\n\nStatesboro is located in the southeast part of the State of Georgia, latitude 32 degrees-30'; longitude 80 degrees-45'.

The county was laid out and established as a fixed political division on the map 6f Georgia in the year 1796. Prior to that time it has been a part of Screven and Bryan counties and in early Colonial days a part of St Philips Parish. The county is now bounded by Emanuel and Candler on the west, Jenkins, Screven, Effingham and the famous Ogeechee river on the north, Bryan on the east and Evans on the south. The county was named for Archibald Bulloch, first president of the Executive Council of Georgia. The first Superior Court in the county was held in 1797. In 1822 the Bulloch County Academy was built, in 1823 the county got its first post office, in 1834 the first free school, in 1849 the Pony Express, and in 1890 the first railroad. The early settlers were Scotch and Irish. In 1845 the census gave Bulloch county a total population of 3,305. The race percentage today is 62 per-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxvn\n\ncent white and 38 percent colored. Statesboro is the county seat. Other active and progressive towns and communities are Brooklet, Portal, Register, Stilson, Nevils, Denmark and Leefield.\n\nAgriculture\n\nWith the coming of industry, progress in agriculture has not been neglected. Bulloch county has eight Master Farm Families (the most of any county in the nation), and two national 4-H champions for cattle raising. The per capita family farm income is far above the national average. Bulloch county, many years ago, became established as a live-at-home county. The shift from cotton to feed crops proved a boon to Bulloch county livestock minded farmers. Last year the Statesboro tobacco market sold 11,597,152 pounds, peanuts had an approximate value of $1,500,000.00, livestock $5,500,000.00, pecans $200,000.00. Cotton is still a big money crop in Bulloch. Water melons, hay, corn, pecans and poultry are also money producing crops. Most farms are mechanized and 95 percent of the land is owned by people who live on the farm. Modern pastures, farm ponds, and pine tree cultivation are also important factors of the modern Bulloch county farm operations.\n\n(Courtesy, The Statesboro and Bulloch County Chamber of Commerce)\n\nVITAL INFORMATION\n\nAT YOUR FINGER-TIPS\n\nTens of thousands of people who were formerly strangers to the City Directory are consulting it on questions of citizenship, employment, sources of supply, communications, etc. Also, Directory usage is up among regular subscribers.\n\nMore People Are SEEING CITY DIRECTORY ADS\n\nWHY A YELLOW\n\nPAGE SECTION?\n\nIt is customary to include\n\na Yellow Page Section in\n\nthe City Directory because:\n\nIt gives business firms the opportunity to elaborate upon a description of their products and services impossible in the limited space of regular Alphabetical and Classified listings.\n\n*\n\nThe Yellow Page Section is a necessary supplement to the regular listings; il is good City Directory information ...
