        "text": "Congressman John Lewis 1940–2020\n\n“When you see something that is not right, not just, not fair, you have a moral obligation to say something, to do something,” Congressman John Lewis (1940–2020) remarked in 2019. Born to a family of sharecroppers in Troy, Alabama, Lewis spent his life in the vanguard, making what he called “good trouble” by working tirelessly for equality and nonviolent social change. He cofounded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960, reinforcing his early dedication to combating injustice.\n\nLewis was one of the thirteen original Freedom Riders in 1961, an organizer of the March on Washington in 1963, and a key figure in the Selmato-Montgomery marches for voting rights in 1965. As a leader of the SNCC, he organized demonstrations to end racial segregation, and as director of the Voter Education Project, he helped secure voting rights for millions of disenfranchised African Americans. Lewis served in President Jimmy Carter’s administration before making his first successful run for Congress in 1986. He held his position as the representative of Georgia’s fifth congressional district from 1987 until his death.\n\nPainted during the final year of his life, this portrait, with its unfinished look, evokes the unending struggle for justice that Lewis made his life’s work\n\nMichael Shane Neal (born 1968)\n\nOil on linen, 2020\n\nGift of Jeffery and Cindy Loring in memory of Congressman John Lewis\n\n© Michael Shane Neal\n\nCarrie Chapman Catt 1859–1947\n\nBorn Ripon, Wisconsin\n\nCarrie Chapman Catt’s organizational talents are credited with making the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) an effective force in winning the struggle for women’s right to vote. In NAWSA, she worked with such leaders as Susan B. Anthony to win the franchise state by state and also for a constitutional amendment. Initially condemning America’s flood of immigrants, whom she believed were influenced by their paternalistic Old World cultures to vote against women’s suffrage, Catt eventually discarded such xenophobic simplifications, founded the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, and became a crusader for internationalism and world peace. In 1900, she replaced Anthony as president of NAWSA and was again elected president in 1915, leading the organization during the successful passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, which guaranteed women the right to vote.\n\nMary Eliot Foote (1872–1968)\n\nOil on canvas, 1927\n\nGift of the National American Woman Suffrage Association\n\n© Estate of Mary Foote, courtesy of John Pence Gallery\n\nGeorge Washington Carver c. 1864–1943\n\nBorn Diamond Grove (formerly Diamond), Missouri\n\nBorn into slavery, George Washington Carver overcame the obstacles of slender means and racial discrimination to seek an education. He believed that “when you can do the common things of life in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world.” These words, coupled with his lifelong goal to help poor black farmers trapped in sharecropping and dependency on cotton as a crop, pervaded his work at Alabama’s Tuskegee Institute, where he was director of agricultural teaching and research for nearly forty years. Carver’s laboratory investigations led to the discovery of more than 450 new commercial products—ranging from margarine to library paste—that could be extracted from previously untapped sources such as the peanut and sweet potato. He demonstrated for southern farmers the wisdom of diversifying crops, instead of relying mainly on the soil-exhausting crop of cotton.\n\nBetsy Graves Reyneau (1888–1964)\n\nOil on canvas, 1942\n\nGift of the George Washington Carver Memorial Committee\n\n© Peter Edward Fayard\n\nJ.Rosamond Johnson 1873–1954\n\nBorn Jacksonville, Florida\n\nIn 1899, composer J.Rosamond Johnson set to music a three-stanza poem by his brother, the writer and future civil rights leader James Weldon Johnson. The result was “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the soaring, inspirational hymn later adopted by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and widely embraced as the “Black National Anthem.” The work debuted on February 12, 1900, when it was performed in celebration of Lincoln’s birthday by five hundred children at the Stanton School, the only school open to Black students in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nMore than a century since its introduction, “Lift Every Voice and Sing” continues to resonate. It has been performed movingly by Beyoncé and remains closely associated with the struggle for social justice, including the Black Lives Matter movement. In January 2021, Representative James Clyburn introduced a bill in Congress that would make “Lift Every Voice and Sing” the national hymn.\n\nWhite Studio (active 1903–1936)\n\nGelatin silver print, 1912\n\nWilliam Campbell 1917–2012\n\nBorn Tuskegee, Alabama\n\nA decorated fighter pilot who served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, William A. “Bill” Campbell joined the military in 1942, when all branches of the armed forces were rigidly segregated. Shortly after America’s entry into World War II, Campbell enrolled in flight training at special facilities established for African American pilots and technicians at Alabama’s Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University). Earning his wings in July 1942, Second Lieutenant Campbell was assigned to the U.S. Army Air Corp’s Ninety-Ninth Pursuit Squadron. On June 2, 1943, he saw action as a wingman on the inaugural combat mission carried out by the Tuskegee Airmen. The first African American pilot to bomb an enemy target, Campbell flew 106 missions and ended the war as commander of the Ninety-Ninth Fighter Squadron. Awarded two Distinguished Flying Crosses, a Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit, and thirteen Air Medals, he retired from the service as a full colonel in 1970.\n\nBetsy Graves Reyneau (1888–1964)\n\nOil on canvas, 1944\n\nGift of the Harmon Foundation\n\n© Peter Edward Fayard\n\nMary McLeod Bethune 1875–1955\n\nBorn Mayesville, South Carolina\n\nThe fifteenth of seventeen children born to her formerly enslaved parents, Mary McLeod Bethune believed deeply in education as the main route out of poverty for herself and other African Americans. In 1904, she founded the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute—a school for Black girls in Daytona, Florida. By 1929, that institution had blossomed into Bethune-Cookman College.\n\nPerhaps Bethune’s greatest impact came in the mid-1930s with her service as a director for the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency established to aid jobless African American youth during the Depression. She leveraged her position to speak out powerfully against racial discrimination throughout the federal government. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order in 1941 requiring equal consideration for African Americans seeking jobs in the government and in the nation’s defense industries, there was little doubt that Bethune’s lobbying had played a major role in bringing it about.\n\nWinold Reiss (1886–1953)\n\nPastel on board, c. 1925\n\nGift of Lawrence A. Fleischman and Howard Garfinkle, with a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts\n\nEleanor Roosevelt 1884–1962\n\nBorn New York City\n\nAs the nation’s first lady from March 1933 to April 1945, Eleanor Roosevelt transcended her role as hostess and proved to be a vital force in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration. She took public stands on issues ranging from exploitive labor practices to civil rights and often urged her husband to advocate for causes he might otherwise have avoided. Her activism did not end with her departure from the White House. As a U.S. delegate to the United Nations (1945–52), Mrs. Roosevelt was instrumental in formulating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and securing its ratification by the General Assembly in 1948.\n\nThis painting, which is based on a photograph from 1944, was created by a Polish artist and may have been presented to the first lady as a gesture of gratitude. In 1946, Mrs. Roosevelt repeatedly called attention to the terrible conditions in post-war Poland.\n\nBernard Tadeusz Frydrysiak (1908–1970)\n\nOil on canvas, 1946\n\nLoaned by Ford and Marni Roosevelt\n\nMarian Anderson 1897–1993\n\nBorn Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nArturo Toscanini said that Marian Anderson had a voice that came along “once in a hundred years.” When one of Anderson’s teachers first heard her sing, the magnitude of her talent moved him to tears. Because she was black, however, her initial prospects as a concert singer in this country were sharply limited, and her early professional triumphs mostly took place in Europe. The magnitude of her musical gifts ultimately won her recognition in the United States as well. Despite that acclaim the Daughters of the American Revolution banned her from performing at its Constitution Hall in 1939. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt ultimately intervened and facilitated Anderson’s Easter Sunday outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial—an event witnessed by 75,000 and broadcast to a radio audience of millions. The affair generated great sympathy for Anderson and became a defining moment in America’s civil rights movement.\n\nBetsy Graves Reyneau (1888–1964)\n\nOil on canvas, 1955\n\nGift of the Harmon Foundation\n\n© Peter Edward Fayard\n\nEarl Warren 1891–1974\n\nBorn Los Angeles, California\n\nAs Chief Justice of the United States (1953–69), Earl Warren played a pivotal role in crafting a series of landmark rulings by the Supreme Court during a period of tremendous social change. A former Republican vice presidential candidate (1948), who served previously as California’s attorney general (1939–43) and governor (1943–53), Warren was named to the Court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and joined that body as it wrestled with Brown v. Board of Education. The justices were deeply divided over the case, which challenged the constitutionality of public-school segregation. But Warren brought them together in 1954 to forge a unanimous opinion, which held that “in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.”\n\nIn subsequent ground-breaking rulings, the Warren Court struck down race-based restrictions to voting (1966), marriage (1967), and housing (1968); it also barred state-sanctioned prayer in public\n\nschools (1961) and enumerated the “Miranda rights” of those under arrest (1966).\n\nYousuf Karsh (1908–2002)\n\nGelatin silver print, 1955\n\nGift of Estrellita Karsh, in memory of Yousuf Karsh\n\nCharlayne Hunter-Gault born 1942\n\nBorn Due West, South Carolina\n\nIn January 1961, following a two-year legal battle, Charlayne Hunter-Gault and fellow student Hamilton Holmes walked resolutely onto the University of Georgia campus as the first African American students to enroll at the all-white public university. Within forty-eight hours of their arrival, students opposed to the pair’s admission were rioting outside Hunter-Gault’s dormitory and hurling bricks and bottles through her window. Hunter-Gault and Holmes were suspended, ostensibly to ensure their safety. They soon returned under a new court order, “determined as ever to stay the course.”\n\nJoseph Schwarz, an art professor who helped organize a faculty resolution to reinstate the suspended students, created this portrait. It captures the cool determination that enabled Hunter-Gault to challenge entrenched segregation and earn the journalism degree she fought to pursue at the University of Georgia. In 1988, twenty-five years after her graduation, Hunter-Gault became the first African American to deliver the school’s commencement address.\n\nJoseph Schwarz (born 1938)\n\nOil on canvas, 1961\n\nGift of Charlayne Hunter-Gault\n\nEsther Schmoe 1924–2012\n\nGordon Hirabayashi 1918–2012\n\nBoth born Seattle, Washington\n\nFollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor (1941), the U.S. government imposed federal edicts that discriminated against Japanese Americans. Gordon Hirabayashi tested the constitutionality of those orders when he broke curfew and refused to be forcibly relocated to an internment camp. After surrendering to the FBI in 1942, he filed a lawsuit against the government. The case reached the Supreme Court, which upheld Hirabayashi’s conviction in 1943.\n\nHirabayashi and Esther Schmoe made headlines when they married on July 29, 1944. They met in college and married while Hirabayashi was out on bail. He had been imprisoned for refusing to complete a selective service form that questioned Japanese American loyalty to the United States. After serving a one-year sentence, he went on to become a sociology professor. Hirabayashi’s 1943 case returned to the news when, in 1987, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated the earlier convictions. In 2012, Hirabayashi was posthumously awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nChi Sun Den (life dates unknown)\n\nGelatin silver print, 1944\n\nGift of an anonymous donor\n\nThurgood Marshall 1908–1993\n\nBorn Baltimore, Maryland\n\nAs chief staff lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1938 to 1961, Thurgood Marshall led the legal campaign to dismantle the nation’s longstanding barriers to racial equality. His crowning achievement in this effort came in 1954, when he tailored the arguments leading to the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which found racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional. Following this landmark victory, Marshall’s legal stature continued to grow and, in 1967, he became the Supreme Court’s first African American justice.\n\nOn May 31, 1955, the Supreme Court issued a follow-up ruling to Brown v. Board of Education that instructed the states to implement school desegregation plans “with all deliberate speed.” The publication of this portrait of Thurgood Marshall on the Time magazine cover of September 19, 1955, coincided with the start of the first school year to come after that ruling.\n\nJames Ormsbee Chapin (1887–1975)\n\nOil on board, 1955\n\nGift of Time magazine\n\nGeorge Takei born 1937\n\nBorn Los Angeles, California\n\nWhen George Takei made his debut as helmsman Hikaru Sulu on Star Trek in 1966, he became the first Asian American to play a major, nonstereotyped character in a U.S. television series. Takei appeared in almost every episode of the short-lived but wildly popular series, as well as in all six of its feature films released between 1979 and 1991.\n\nEarlier in life, during World War II, Takei and his family were imprisoned in Japanese American internment camps in Arkansas and California. This photograph was taken when Takei returned to one of these camps, in Rohwer, Arkansas, for a dedication ceremony of the Jerome-Rohwer Interpretive Museum and Visitor Center. Takei’s experiences as an internee inspired his 2015 Broadway musical, Allegiance. Long active in politics and civic affairs, he “came out” in 2005 and continues to advocate for LGBTQ+ and social justice issues through his large social media following.\n\nGrav Weldon (born 1971)\n\nInkjet print, 2013 (printed 2020)\n\nEunice Kennedy Shriver 1921–2009\n\nBorn Brookline, Massachusetts\n\nEunice Kennedy Shriver was the creative force and organizer of Special Olympics, Inc., a nonprofit charitable organization that provides training and competition in Olympic-style sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. In 1962, she established a summer day camp at her home that became the basis for Special Olympics. In 1968, the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, working with the Chicago Park District, organized the First International Special Olympics Summer Games. Currently, the Special Olympics serves more than 4.9 million children and adults from nearly 172 countries.\n\nDavid Lenz was commissioned to paint this portrait as part of the first prize in the museum’s inaugural Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. Lenz embraced the idea of making a portrait of Eunice Shriver that would also include five persons with intellectual disabilities who have been involved in Special Olympics and in the Best Buddies program: (left to right) Airika Straka, Katie Meade, Andy Leonard, Loretta Claiborne, and Martin “Marty” Sheets.\n\nDavid Lenz (born 1962)\n\nOil and acrylic on canvas, 2009\n\nCommissioned as part of the first prize, Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition 2006\n\nDennis Banks 1937–2017\n\nBorn Leech Lake Reservation, Minnesota\n\nRussell Means 1939–2012\n\nBorn Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota\n\nClyde H. Bellecourt born 1936\n\nBorn White Earth Reservation, Minnesota\n\nCheryl Walsh Bellville photographed Dennis Banks (Ojibwe), Russell Means (Oglala Lakota), and Clyde Bellecourt (Ojibwe), leaders of the Minnesota-based American Indian Movement (AIM), at a tenement off Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis in August 1971. Banks, Bellecourt, and Means, along with other members of AIM, worked toward gaining rights for Native American communities in the MinneapolisSt. Paul area and beyond. Their multipronged efforts included drawing attention to the excessive policing of Native communities; creating housing projects; and establishing Native schools that functioned independently of the federal government.\n\nAIM also organized marches and protests, some of which drew national and international attention. Following their seventy-one-day occupation of Wounded Knee, in South Dakota, in 1973, Banks and Means both faced charges that were later dropped. Despite their individual run-ins with the law and AIM’s internal conflicts, the three men continued advocating for Indigenous rights. Today, Bellecourt is focused on eliminating racist imagery in sports.\n\nCheryl Walsh Bellville (born 1944)\n\nGelatin silver print, 1971 (printed 2019)\n\n© Cheryl Walsh Bellville\n\nOna Kingbird and student\n\nBorn Red Lake Reservation, Minnesota\n\nThe American Indian Movement (AIM) deemed access to education as essential for Native Americans to obtain civil rights. Ona Kingbird (1935–2010; Red Lake Ojibwe) worked with Native American students at several Minnesota public schools at a time when these children faced discrimination so extreme that it resulted in disproportionately high dropout rates. Kingbird was a longtime educator at AIM’s Heart of the Earth Survival School, founded in 1972 as an alternative to public schools, teaching both Native cultures and languages, especially Ojibwe. Having learned from her family, Kingbird became a great storyteller, a skill she shared with her students. As a respected elder and keeper of knowledge, she was also frequently called on to help resolve conflicts.\n\nIn this photograph, we see Kingbird (left) at Heart of the Earth, sitting next to one of her students, who wears a button that reads, “Think Indian,” alluding to the school’s embrace of Indigenous identity.\n\nCheryl Walsh Bellville (born 1944)\n\nGelatin silver print, c. 1972 (printed 2019)\n\n© Cheryl Walsh Bellville\n\nAntonia Pantoja 1922–2002\n\nBorn San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nA preeminent social leader of Puerto Ricans in the United States, Antonia Pantoja arrived in New York City in 1944, joining thousands of islanders who moved there over the following decade to work in low-paying postwar industries. While employed at various factories, she quickly started organizing to contest labor violations. Meanwhile, with scholarships, savings, and determination, she eventually earned a doctorate in social work.\n\nIn 1961, Pantoja founded ASPIRA (“to strive” in Spanish), an organization dedicated to improving disproportionally low Latino high school graduation rates. ASPIRA won a landmark lawsuit in 1972 that mandated bilingual education in the New York City school system. Pantoja’s efforts in education earned her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996.\n\nThis mosaic is a study for a public mural honoring Pantoja that was installed in the Puerto Rican community of East Harlem in 2015, where Pantoja initiated her career as a community and youth\n\norganizer.\n\nManny Vega (born 1956)\n\nMarble, glass, and stone, 2014\n\nAcquisition made possible through the Smithsonian Latino Initiatives Pool, administered by the Latino Center\n\nKate Millett 1934–2017\n\nBorn St. Paul, Minnesota\n\nFred McDarrah’s photograph portrays feminist writer, activist, and artist Kate Millett in 1970, the year she published her first book, Sexual Politics, a best-selling touchstone for the second wave of the women’s movement. Based on Millett’s doctoral dissertation, the book deploys feminist literary criticism to uncover misogynist tropes embedded in the novels of Henry Miller, D. H. Lawrence, and other writers often hailed as sexual revolutionaries.\n\nMcDarrah, the first staff photographer for the Village Voice, shows Millett happily marching down New York City’s Fifth Avenue, during a parade commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the\n\nratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. Later, at a rally in Bryant Park, Millett spoke before an exuberant crowd, exclaiming “today is the end of millenniums\n\nof oppression.”\n\nFred McDarrah (1926–2007)\n\nGelatin silver print, 1970\n\nRobert Dole born 1923\n\nBorn Russell, Kansas\n\nWhen President George H. W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) into law on July 26, 1990, Senator Robert Dole hailed the enactment of this historic civil rights legislation.\n\nHis commitment to the ADA and its goal of ending “the unjustified segregation and exclusion of persons with disabilities from the mainstream of American life,” was rooted in personal experience. While serving with the army during World War II, Dole suffered catastrophic injuries that left him without the use of his right arm. Thereafter, he identified with the disability community\n\nDuring his tenure in the U.S. Senate (1969–96), Dole supported a number of key pieces of disabilities rights legislation. Among these was the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination “on the basis of disability in programs conducted by federal agencies, in programs receiving federal financial assistance, in federal employment, and in the employment practices of federal contractors.”\n\nArthur Grace (born 1947)\n\nGelatin silver print, 1988\n\nGift from the Trustees of the Corcoran Gallery of Art\n\n(Gift of Arthur Grace)\n\nThe Return to Aztlan\n\nCesar Chavez 1927–1993\n\nBorn North Gila Valley, near Yuma, Arizona\n\nEncouraged by the civil rights movement, labor organizer Cesar Chavez began in the early 1960s to protest the unfair treatment of farm workers in California and the Southwest, the majority of whom were Mexican or Mexican American. In 1962 he and Dolores Huerta founded the forerunner of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), which launched a boycott of California table grapes in 1965 as part of a movement to improve working conditions for field laborers. This eventually resulted in a national boycott of grapes by many sympathetic Americans.\n\nThis painting links modern-era activists Chavez and Huerta to historic figures Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos (leaders in Mexico’s War of Independence) and Emiliano Zapata (Mexican revolutionary and champion of agrarian reform), who shared their Mexican heritage and a commitment to justice. The painting’s title refers both to the mythical homeland of the Aztec people and to the cultural realm of greater Mexico.\n\nAlfredo Arreguin (born 1935)\n\nOil on canvas, 2006\n\nGift of Felix Arreguin Velez and Catalina Toledo de Arreguin\n\nPaul Robeson 1898–1976\n\nBorn Princeton, New Jersey\n\nA celebrated dramatic actor and concert artist, Paul Robeson was also a strong voice in the struggle for racial equality. Encouraged by the professional opportunities and broader acceptance afforded him in Europe, he spent much of his early career performing abroad. When he returned to the United States, he spoke out forcefully against the injustices he encountered. His conviction that socialism could produce a more just society put him at odds with a rising tide of conservatism in post-World War II America. Cast as “un-American,” Robeson was effectively blacklisted for the remainder of his life.\n\nJacob Epstein (1880–1959)\n\nBronze, 1928\n\n© Estate of Jacob Epstein\n\nAlbert Einstein 1879–1955\n\nBorn Ulm, Germany\n\nTheoretical physicist Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Less well known is the fact that he was an influential civil rights activist. In 1946, Einstein worked closely with Paul Robeson on an antilynching campaign. Later, he and his wife welcomed Marian Anderson into their home after she was denied lodging at the Nassau Inn in Princeton, New Jersey, due to her skin color. Regarding racism in the U.S., Einstein observed, “The more I feel an American, the more this situation pains me. I can escape the feeling of complicity in it only by speaking out.”\n\nJo Davidson (1883–1952)\n\nTerra-cotta, c. 1934\n\nGift of Dr. Maury Leibovitz\n\nRosa Parks 1913–2005\n\nBorn Tuskegee, Alabama\n\nWith a courageous act of civil disobedience, Rosa Parks sparked a challenge to segregation that culminated in one of the seminal victories of the modern civil rights movement. On December 1, 1955, while traveling on a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama, the seamstress was arrested for refusing the driver’s demand that she surrender her seat to a white male passenger. When Parks was convicted of violating local segregation laws, Montgomery’s African American community launched a massive oneday boycott of the city’s bus system. The boycott expanded with the help of Martin Luther King Jr. to last 382 days, ending only after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled bus segregation unconstitutional.\n\nMarshall D. Rumbaugh (born 1948)\n\nPainted limewood, 1983\n\nDustin Lance Black, born 1974\n\nBorn Sacramento, California\n\nPraised as one of “the rare voices from within the film industry to speak…passionately and openly about gay activism,” Dustin Lance Black worked tirelessly to bring the story of slain gay rights activist Harvey Milk to the big screen. He not only wrote the Academy Award-winning original screenplay for Milk (2009) but also served as the feature film’s executive producer. It was during his undergraduate studies at UCLA’s School of Theater, Film and Television that Black first embraced storytelling as a tool to humanize LGBTQ+ issues. Coming out during his senior year, he was inspired by Milk’s legacy to believe that he could live his life fully and authentically.\n\nWhile building a successful career with his work for stage and screen, Black also joined the fight for marriage equality by supporting a successful challenge to California’s Proposition 8. The 2008 ballot initiative that resulted in a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage was overturned.\n\nLouis Briel, born 1945\n\nAcrylic on canvas, 2012\n\nAnonymous gift in honor of Equality Virginia and the American Foundation for Equal Rights\n\n© 2012 Louis Briel"
