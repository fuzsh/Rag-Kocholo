        "text": "Since ChatGPT emerged as a leading symbol of advancements in generative artificial intelligence, there have been warnings that such technology will trigger financial crises, worsen inequality, influence elections, and facilitate crime.\n\nAttorney Jack Hicks, a global intellectual property attorney with the transatlantic law firm of Womble Bond Dickinson LLP, hears those concerns. His response? “Time will certainly tell.”\n\n“But I do know that we need to be on the field and not on the sidelines,” Hicks said in a Commencement address to Elon Law’s Class of 2023. “Fortunately, most lawyers agree.”\n\nCiting recent surveys, Hicks noted that nearly three quarters of attorneys expect to integrate generative AI into their legal practices, though nearly as many don’t feel prepared for the impact the technology is sure to leave on the profession. And attorneys must not abuse artificial intelligence, or overlook the possibility of disclosing confidential information.\n\nSo what did Hicks recommend to the newest graduates of Elon University School of Law, as well as friends and families who surrounded them in a December 8 morning celebration on the university’s main campus?\n\nFluency. Master the vernacular and learn whether the AI product adds content to its database to share with third parties. Also appreciate and learn to look for “so-called hallucinations or fake facts” that have gotten other lawyers in trouble.\n\nExplore. When using new systems, try prompts and test queries on a topic you already know well.\n\nDon’t forget you’re a lawyer. Remember your obligations to the courts and the bar, he said, and safeguard confidential client information. Attorneys are required to act with integrity and honesty.\n\nPractice critical listening. “Do what you are trained to do,” he said. “Recognize advocacy masquerading as fact. Seek primary sources. Question videos and voice creations from non-reputable sources.”\n\nContinue to build trust. Artificial intelligence cannot create person-to-person connections. “If you want to thrive in the age of artificial intelligence,” Hicks said, “you better become exceptionally good at connecting with others.”\n\n“I challenge you to use the skills you have honed, the education you have received at Elon Law, to build a robust network filled with those person-to-person connections,” Hicks said. “Those connections will support you and empower you as you endeavor to make positive change in the world.”\n\nElon University hosted Commencement inside Alumni Gym where members of the Class of 2023 gathered to celebrate the formal end of their legal education. With 140 graduates, the class was the largest and highest credentialed in Elon Law history, including several members who had already earned advanced degrees, had served in the military, or who brought leadership and service experiences with them to their legal studies.\n\nHicks’s practice over the past three decades includes managing complex intellectual property matters, from federal and state litigation to international patent and trademark filing strategies. A leader of Womble Bond Dickinson’s Manufacturing Industry Sector and of the firm’s Innovation Board, he represents a diverse group of manufacturing and services providers, with a focus on the furniture, building products, lighting, apparel, food and beverage, nanotechnology, automotive and aerospace industry sectors.\n\nA passion for teaching and mentoring led Hicks to serve Elon Law as an adjunct instructor in intellectual property. For nearly a decade he co-led multiple Elon Law and Elon MBA student trips throughout Asia and Europe, inspiring students to broaden their vision for using a legal education to advance global industries and the common good.\n\nHis contributions earned Hicks an Outstanding Service to Students Award in 2013 from the Student Bar Association.\n\nCommencement also featured a student address from Jennifer A. Martinez L’23, a former editor-in-chief of the Elon Law Review elected by the class to deliver remarks, and a welcome message from former Student Bar Association President Elizabeth Kwon L’23.\n\n“When we cross this stage, we will receive more than a degree. We will receive a gift. Not a gift given gratuitously, but one striven for, one earned, and thus one far more special,” Martinez said. “This gift is an opportunity to use our voices, for ourselves, for those we represent, and for those who have been silenced.”\n\nMartinez said she realized early in her legal studies that more than learning the law, she was learning how the world worked. The law should not be a secret language between the elite, she added, but a language accessible to all.\n\n“This gift is an extraordinary privilege, because more often than not, we will be dealing with people at their most vulnerable,” Martinez said. “There will be times when our hands guide them through their worst day, and there will be times when those same hands rejoice in their victory.\n\n“And there will be times still where our work doesn’t bear fruit until we are gone, but a society grows great when we plant trees under whose shade we know will never sit.”\n\nKwon reminded her classmate how fast time can fly even when, in the words of Professor Steve Friedland, law school is like a marathon where students must focus on the finish line. Commencement is that finish line.\n\n“Two and a half years ago we sat in these seats for Convocation as we entered into what might be labeled as the hardest period of our lives so far. And here we are today to celebrate our success as a class,” Kwon said. “We have seen ourselves and each other laugh, cry, smile, struggle, and succeed during these last few years, but today, we end our journey with celebration for all we have accomplished.\n\nShe then thanked family and friends who offered words of encouragement as students progressed through their studies. “We could not have accomplished all that we have without the network of support behind our backs,” Kwon said. “With your patience and support, you now also get to say you have one more lawyer in your network, which is definitely something to celebrate.”\n\nThe program included the presentation of the David Gergen Award for Leadership & Professionalism, the highest honor bestowed by Elon Law each year on an individual from the graduating class whose activities represent the twin principles of leadership and professionalism.\n\nThe award is named in honor of David Gergen, a former adviser to four American presidents whose professional life and contributions have embodied the highest levels of selfless leadership and service. Gergen serves as chair of the Elon Law Advisory Board.\n\nElon Law Associate Dean Wendy Scott presented the 2023 award to Samantha Hepler L’23, who recently accepted a position with the Guilford County District Attorney’s Office to prosecute criminal offenders in Greensboro and surrounding communities.\n\nIn closing the program with a charge to graduates, Elon University President Connie Ledoux Book instructed the Class of 2023 to use Elon Law’s values when encountering the inevitable hard choices attorneys face.\n\n“As you stand here, you are not just graduates,” Book said. “You are advocates, leaders, and change makers. You are equipped with a comprehensive legal education and you are ready to take on society’s most pressing legal challenges. Go forth with resilience and steadfastness, and carry the knowledge and skills and values you have gained into a world in dire of need of your expertise, empathy, and your leadership.”\n\n“Uphold the principles of justice. Serve with integrity. And strive to be a positive force in whatever path you choose. … Long live Elon!”\n\nElon University School of Law’s Class of 2023\n\nNabeel Ahmad Abdelmajid\n\nB.S., North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University\n\nYaseen Rawhi Abutabanja\n\nB.A., The University of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\nMichelle Aguilar Figueroa\n\nB.A., Sewanee: The University of the South\n\nM.S., University of Miami\n\nDeAndre Jordan Alexander\n\nB.S., The University of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\nCraig Thomas Almond\n\nB.A., University of South Carolina\n\nMargaret Osborne Anderson\n\nB.A., University of South Carolina\n\nMorgan Terrie Ashmore\n\nB.S., Oregon State University\n\nNicholas Andrew Bainbridge\n\nB.A., High Point University\n\nFaith Alyssa Bangs\n\nB.S., Stevenson University\n\nChance Acker Bartenfield\n\nB.A., The University of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\nKatelyn Danielle Bendrick\n\nB.S., Radford University\n\nIan Casey Blackwell\n\nB.A., University of South Carolina\n\nAnthony Jesus Bland\n\nB.S., Texas A&M University\n\nEsther Severina Lewis Bouquet\n\nB.A., The College of William & Mary\n\nTodd Michael Bowyer\n\nB.S., James Madison University\n\nM.S., James Madison University\n\nFletcher Brooks\n\nB.A., Guilford College\n\nDenver Chadwick Brown\n\nB.A., The University of North Carolina at Charlotte\n\nZachary Steelman Bryson\n\nB.A, Wake Forest University\n\nJudith Caitlyn Bullock\n\nB.A., Elon University\n\nDaja Danielle Burgee\n\nB.A., Virginia Wesleyan University\n\nAlexandra Jeanne Buxbaum\n\nB.S., Coastal Carolina University\n\nJoseph Cammarano\n\nB.S., East Carolina University\n\nJackson Manning Carter\n\nB.S., Appalachian State University\n\nMatthew Robbins Carter\n\nB.S., North Carolina State University\n\nNatasha Castellano\n\nB.A., Mars Hill University\n\nGordon M.
