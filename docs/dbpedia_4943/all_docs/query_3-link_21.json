        "text": "In 1952, the Supreme Court agreed to hear five cases collectively from across the country, consolidated under the name Brown v. Board of Education. This grouping of cases from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Delaware was significant because it represented school segregation as a national issue, not just a southern one. Each case was brought on the behalf of elementary school children, involving all-Black schools that were inferior to white schools.\n\nIn each case, the lower courts had ruled against the plaintiffs, noting the Plessy v. Ferguson ruling of the United States Supreme Court as precedent. The plaintiffs claimed that the \"separate but equal\" ruling violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. In 1954, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that state-sanctioned segregation of public schools was a violation of the 14th Amendment and was therefore unconstitutional.\n\nBrown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas\n\n(Brown et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka et al.)\n\nLinda Brown\n\nLinda Brown, who was born in 1943, became a part of civil rights history as a third grader in the public schools of Topeka, KS. When Linda was denied admission into a white elementary school, Linda's father, Oliver Brown, challenged Kansas's school segregation laws in the Supreme Court. The NAACP and Thurgood Marshall took up their case, along with similar ones in South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware, as Brown v. Board of Education. Linda Brown died in 2018.\n\nOliver L. Brown\n\nOliver Brown, a minister in his local Topeka, KS, community, challenged Kansas's school segregation laws in the Supreme Court.

The NAACP and Thurgood Marshall took up Brown’s case along with similar cases in South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware as Brown v. Board of Education. Oliver Brown died in 1961.\n\nRobert L. Carter\n\nBorn in 1917, Robert Carter, who served as an attorney for the plaintiffs in Briggs v. Elliott, was of particular significance to the Brown v. Board of Education case because of his role in the Briggs case. Carter secured the pivotal involvement of social scientists, particularly Kenneth B. Clark, who provided evidence in the Briggs case on segregation's devastating effects on the psyches of Black children.\n\nHarold R.

Justice Marshall died in 1993.\n\nFrank Daniel Reeves\n\nFrank D. Reeves, who was born in 1916, served as an attorney for the plaintiffs in the Brown v. Board decisions of 1954, and 1955 (Brown II). Mr. Reeves was the first African-American person appointed to the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners, although he declined the position. Frank Reeves died in 1973.\n\nCharles Scott\n\nCharles Scott was a Topeka, KS, based lawyer who initially began the Brown case on behalf of Oliver Brown and the other litigants.\n\nJohn Scott\n\nJohn Scott was a Topeka, KS, based lawyer who initially began the Brown case on behalf of Oliver Brown and the other litigants.\n\nEarl Warren\n\nChief Justice Earl Warren, who was born in 1891, secured a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education, outlawing segregation in public schools and striking down the \"separate but equal\" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson. Warren also delivered the opinion in the District of Columbia case, Bolling v. Sharpe. Justice Warren died in 1974.\n\nBriggs v. Elliott\n\n(Briggs et al. v. Elliott et al., Members of Board of Trustees of School District #22)\n\nHarold R. Boulware\n\nHarold Boulware was born in 1913. In 1941, he became the chief counsel for the South Carolina NAACP and led the effort to gain equal pay for equal work for African-American teachers.

Boulware also worked on the briefs in the Belton v. Gebhart case. He died in 1983.\n\nHarry Briggs\n\nHarry Briggs and 19 other adults filed suit on behalf of 46 Black children, against R. W. Elliott, Chairman of the Clarendon County School Board of South Carolina. Briggs, who was born in 1913, was a father to three of the children named in the suit, two boys and a girl, as well as legal guardian of a third boy. Mr. Briggs died in 1986.\n\nRobert L. Carter\n\nBorn in 1917, Robert Carter, who served as an attorney for the plaintiffs in Briggs v. Elliott, was of particular significance to the Brown v. Board of Education case because of his role in the Briggs case. Carter secured the pivotal involvement of social scientists, particularly Kenneth B. Clark, who provided evidence in the Briggs case on segregation's devastating effects on the psyches of Black children.\n\nKenneth B. Clark\n\nKenneth Clark, who was born in 1914, provided expert social science testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs, illustrating the harmful psychological effects of segregation upon Black schoolchildren, in the Briggs v. Elliott trial. At the time, Clark was an assistant professor of psychology at the New York City College and Associate Director of the North Side School for Child Development in New York City. The Supreme Court cited Clark’s influential research on the harmful effects of segregation in their decision on Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nJohn W. Davis\n\nJohn W. Davis, who was born in 1872, was a democratic candidate for president in 1924, and former Solicitor General of the United States and ambassador to Great Britain.

DeLaine inspired some of his Summerton, SC, neighbors to petition the Clarendon County school system in November, 1949, to provide buses for Black students, just as they did for white students. When their efforts were met with resistance, the state chapter of the NAACP stepped in and agreed to sponsor a case that would go beyond transportation and ask for equal educational opportunities in Clarendon County. Harry and Eliza Briggs, the first two signers, lent their names to the case that came to be known as Briggs v. Elliott. Delanie died in 1974.\n\nR. W. Elliott\n\nR. W.

Board of Education case along with his legal partner, Oliver W. Hill, by trying and winning the case Davis v. Prince Edward County School Board, Virginia. Robinson died in 1998.\n\nJulius Waties Waring\n\nJudge Waring, as the lone dissenter in the court’s ruling in the Briggs v. Elliott et al. case, alluded to the plaintiffs’ social science testimony regarding the harmful psychological effects of segregation upon black and white children. His dissent would foreshadow the eventual success of Brown v. Board of Education in overturning the Plessy decision based on the argument that “separate but equal” is inherently unequal. Judge Waring was born in 1880 and died in 1968.\n\nDavis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, Virginia\n\n(Davis et al. v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, Virginia et al.)\n\nRobert L. Carter\n\nBorn in 1917, Robert Carter, who served as an attorney for the plaintiffs in Briggs et al. v. Elliott et al., was of particular significance to the Brown v. Board of Education case because of his role in the Briggs case. Carter secured the pivotal involvement of social scientists, particularly Kenneth B. Clark, who provided evidence in the Briggs case on segregation's devastating effects on the psyches of black children.\n\nDorothy E.

The suit began, however, as a result of a student strike organized and led by 16 year-old Barbara Rose Johns, in an attempt to force the county to provide facilities equal to those provided to white high school students as required by law. Their case eventually became one of five included in the landmark 1954 case, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nSpottswood William Robinson, III\n\nSpottswood W. Robinson, III, who was born in 1916, taught law at Howard University, in Washington, DC, and eventually became dean of the school. He made his mark on the history of Brown v.

Sharpe\n\n(Bolling et al. v. Sharpe et al.)\n\nSarah Bolling\n\nSarah Bolling and two other adults filed suit, on behalf of five Black children, against C. Melvin Sharpe and 13 others, including members of the Board of Education of the District of Columbia, the Superintendent of Schools, and the Principal of Sousa Junior High School, for denial of admission of the minor plaintiffs to Sousa Junior High School solely because on their race or color.\n\nSpottswood Thomas Bolling\n\nIn 1951, the case of Bolling v. Sharpe was filed in U.S. District Court, in Washington, DC. This case was named for Spottswood Bolling, the minor-aged son of Sarah Bolling. Spottswood was born in 1939. Ms. Bolling brought suit in her son’s name in the Bolling case, which addressed segregation at the Junior High School level within the District of Columbia. Although Bolling is historically considered one of the Brown v. Board of Education bundle cases, it was a different case due to the legal arguments. The plaintiffs could not argue this case on the basis of a violation of their citizenship rights to equal protection and due process, as in the other cases, because the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was not applicable in the District of Columbia. The Supreme Court rendered a separate opinion on Bolling v. Sharpe., which was argued as a Fifth Amendment case.\n\nGardner Bishop\n\nOn September 11, 1950, Gardner Bishop, a minister and community leader, led a group of 11 African-American children to Washington, DC’s new high school for white students, John Philip Sousa Junior High School.

Houston launched a number of precedent-setting cases that targeted segregated education as the key to undermining the entire Jim Crow system, focused first on segregation in the graduate and professional schools of state universities. Houston provided legal representation for a group of Anacostia, DC, neighborhood parents, the Consolidated Parents Group, in the case Bolling v. Sharpe until serious illness necessitated that he be relieved by James Nabrit, Jr., a colleague from Howard University. Houston died in 1950.\n\nMilton Korman\n\nMilton Korman served as Assistant Corporation Counsel for Washington, DC, and Chief Counsel for the District Board of Education in the case, Bolling v. Sharpe.

Gebhart and 12 others (both individuals and state education agencies) in the case Belton v. Gebhart. The plaintiffs sued the state for denying to the children admission to certain public schools because of color or ancestry. The Belton case was joined with another very similar Delaware case, Bulah v. Gebhart, and both would ultimately join four other NAACP cases in the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. Belton was born in 1937 and died in 1981.\n\nHarold R. Boulware\n\nHarold Boulware was born in 1913. In 1941 Harold Boulware became the Chief Counsel for the South Carolina NAACP and led the effort to gain equal pay for equal work for African-American teachers.
