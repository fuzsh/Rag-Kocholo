        "text": "Biographical Note\n\nDr. Craig Lloyd, a native New Yorker, served as Professor of History and Archivist at Columbus State University until his retirement in 2001. Lloyd, a graduate from Middlebury College in Vermont, initially arrived at CSU, then Columbus College, in August of 1971 after completing his PhD at the University of Iowa. Dick Amundson, chair of the Columbus College Social Science Division initiated the call that made Lloyd the 8th hire in the History Department since 1969. Lloyd's PhD dissertation, Aggressive Introvert: Herbert Hoover and Public Relations Management, was published by Ohio State Press shortly after his hire at Columbus College.\n\nLloyd began working in the Archives in 1985, when the position was a half time one. Teaching history in the mornings, Lloyd spent the remainder of his afternoons in the Archives. Here Lloyd began his 13-year labor in producing the definitive biography of Eugene Bullard entitled: Eugene Bullard, Black Expatriate In Jazz-Age Paris.\n\nAlthough he was the first African American fighter pilot, Eugene J. Bullard (1895-1961) is still a relative stranger in his homeland. The Columbus, Georgia native was an accomplished professional boxer, musician, club manager, and impresario of Parisian nightlife between world wars. Bullard found in Europe a degree of respect and freedom unknown to blacks in America. There, for twenty-five years, he helped define the expatriate experience for countless other African American artists, writers, performers and athletes. The above text was taken from Craig Lloyd's, Eugene Bullard, Black Expatriate In Jazz-Age Paris.\n\nScope and Content\n\nFive boxes equaling 5 linear feet of material comprises the Craig Lloyd/Eugene Bullard Collection.\n\nBox 1 consists of various manuscripts and manuscripts revisions of Craig Lloyd's book Eugene Bullard: Black Expatriate in Jazz Age Paris published by University of Georgia Press 2000.\n\nBoxes 2 and 3 contain the correspondence of Lloyd in carrying out his research for his book on Bullard, presentations and articles by Lloyd on the subject and a mix of primary and secondary sources relating to Eugene Bullard.\n\nBoxes 4 and 5 consist of mainly primary and secondary sources on Eugene Bullard used by Lloyd. Also, Lloyd's slide show on Eugene Bullard is included.\n\nBox 6 is housing for oversized materials.\n\n1910-2015 6 boxes (6 l.f)\n\nPermission to Publish\n\nBy accessing the CSU Archives, the user agrees to give proper acknowledgement to the CSU Archives and further agrees to secure permission in advance from the CSU Archives to publish any item in any way, in whole or in part, from its collections. The Archives preferred citation is:\n\nCraig Lloyd/Eugene Bullard Collection (MC 181) Columbus State University Archives Columbus, Georgia\n\nColumbus State University Archives does not claim to control the rights of reproducing for all materials in the collection.
