        "text": "This morning view just doesn’t get old!\n\nAcross the rooftop, you can see two churches in front of the mountain.\n\nDay 2 was jam packed, and that’s without attending any sessions. I did hear through the RootsTech grapevine that some of the afternoon sessions did have a few seats available. Of course, you would need to select the right sessions.\n\nThere’s a lot of very unhappy rumbling here about the conference: lines, full sessions, lack of signage, etc.\n\nI spent the day doing four things:\n\nVisiting vendor booths\n\nTalking to people\n\nMyHeritage Lunch\n\nVendor appointments\n\nLet’s take a look at each of the four.\n\nVisiting Booths\n\nThere are probably hundreds of booths. Some quite large, of course, like FamilySearch (show sponsor), Ancestry and the other big players, to Mom and Pop shops.\n\nI managed to visit maybe half of the booths today. I’ll try for the other half tomorrow. I am going to make myself absent for part of the day to visit the Family History Library.\n\nI noticed a LOT of vendors offering products to digitize and catalog your photos. Others encouraged recording memories and of course, given that we’re in Salt Lake, there was lots of focus on the Mormon faith and many obviously local vendors.\n\nIn addition to the sessions, there was a vendor demo area in the rear of the hall. I wandered past a couple of times, but the two vendors I saw didn’t really catch my eye.\n\nAt the Legacy Tree Genealogists booth, I found Jessica Taylor (at left, beside me), Paul Woodbury and Amber Brown (far right). (I apologize for not getting the lady’s name at the far left.) Jessica is the owner and founder of Legacy Tree Genealogists, Paul Woodbury is the amazing genetic genealogist that specializes in adoptee and missing parent family reconstruction and Amber Brown is their marketing representative. They were kind enough to give me with a RootsTech survival basket. I’ve never been to a conference before where you needed one of these, and by the end of the day, I was extremely grateful.\n\nA really big thank you Jessica and crew!\n\nNext, I ran into my old friend, Peter Roberts, at the conference as a volunteer for WikiTree, a free site for you to upload your family tree and collaborate with other genealogists. I’ve known Peter for years from the Family Tree DNA annual conference where he is the project administrator for the Bahamas DNA Project.\n\nPeter took the time to sit down with me and explain some of the new DNA features at WikiTree that include Y DNA, mitochondrial, autosomal and most recently, the ability to link your WikiTree tree to your DNAPainter profile. WikiTree utilizes various types of DNA information to support or disprove ancestral connections.\n\nPeter and I also discussed that putting information like links to any articles or blog posting you have written about your ancestors into the description area about each ancestor would be a great idea! I was thinking about the 52 Ancestors series, of course.\n\nI briefly met Chris Whitten, founder of WikiTree, but I wasn’t quick enough to grab a photo.\n\nSpeaking of DNAPainter, Jony Pearl, from England, won the Innovation Showcase with DNAPainter. I’ve been using this extremely useful tool for about a month now, and I have an article half written. I’ll be finishing it as soon as I get home. You’re going to love this tool!\n\nCongratulations Jony! Well deserved.\n\nThis conference has lots of beginners. FamilySearch had a very large area called the Discovery Zone. Just walking past, I did notice people entirely engrossed and making discoveries.\n\nOne of the Discovery Zone areas encouraged you to take your photo, or a group photo, with a backdrop of your choice.\n\nI couldn’t resist. Plus, it’s free and the results are messaged to your phone immediately.\n\nI was amazed to find this backdrop, given that I have actually stood in exactly this place in Germany – in real life. In fact, I can tell you there are two lovely lace shops just past that clock tower arch, one on either side of the street, and a quilt shop just beyond. In fact it was right here that the quilt shop-owner’s husband came riding up on his bicycle to deliver our purchases at the end of the day.\n\nA few minutes later, I came across MYndVault, a digital cloud storage solution that includes servers stores in the granite mountain.\n\nTo prove his point, the founder of MYndVault was giving little boxes of granite – well, chocolate that looked like granite anyway. The chocolate was great – and everyone needs to think about this type of “inheritance issue.” It’s not just cloud storage, but an electronic directive that lists your personal representative, things like social media accounts and passwords. Obviously, I suggested that he add a specific field for DNA results at vendors, but there is already ample room to include this in non-specific fields.\n\nThere were lots of “charts” vendors in attendance, but I particularly liked this one from BranchesArt.\n\nI’ve been wanting to meet Lara Diamond, who blogs at Lara’s Jewnealogy. Lara is Jewish and specializes in endogamous DNA and the inherent frustrations therein.\n\nThe lovely thing about meeting in person is that you actually get to talk to the individual. Lara tested with 23andMe initially and it was that test (before the FDA restricted the information they could provide to consumers) that led her to discover she had both a mutation for cancer, and cancer itself. Take a minute and read Lara’s story here. DNA testing very literally saved her life!\n\nLara will be writing about a super-cool record find soon that defies all logic. Right, Lara, right???\n\nNext was the MyHeritage lunch, where I was thrilled to meet Randy Seaver, finally, in person.\n\nMy joke is that I wake up each morning to Randy, because that’s when I read his blog, Genea-Musings, every day. Randy writes more quality content than any other blogger I know. In fact, he has a great compendium of RootsTech conference articles that you can check out on his blog yesterday and today.\n\nThe MyHeritage luncheon speaker was Gilad Japhet, founder and CEO of MyHeritage.\n\nGilad and I had a personal meeting later in the day, and he gave me permission to share the slides from the luncheon with my readers.\n\nI must say, MyHeritage is making very big waves in the genealogy community.\n\nFor a company that just started DNA testing about 18 months ago, and had significant startup challenges with matching, they’ve come a very, very long way.\n\nFirst, Gilad announced a new initiative to test 15,000 adoptees or those seeking unknown parents by donating free kits. You can read more about this program here or apply to receive a kit. Those with financial need will receive priority.\n\nSecond, they also announced Family Search Tree sync between Family Search and MyHeritage that allows collaborative syncing of trees between LDS members and MyHeritage.\n\nThird, they announced the publication of a paper culminating from 7 years of research, published today, discussing 86 million family trees from Geni and the patterns that emerge from this much data about migration and families. For example, exceptional genetics only adds abut 5 years to life expectancy, but poor lifestyle habits can deduct 10.\n\nThey are on a tear, I’m telling you. They weren’t done yet.\n\nFourth, they announced that they are adding new records at an amazing pace. Three new collections, including the digitization and indexing of high school yearbooks from the US.\n\nFifth – new advancements in genetic genealogy.\n\nMyHeritage has observed that many people don’t understand the details of genetic genealogy or how to use the tools. Additionally, many people don’t have or create family trees.\n\nMyHeritage has created what they call “The Big Tree” where all of their customers are connected in one large “tree of humanity,” or at least as much of humanity as has tested or uploaded to MyHeritage. They then look at how your own node is connected to others in that large tree and distill the results into something useful for you.\n\nThe next step, Gilad calls the “Theory of Family Relativity,” where MyHeritage combines your DNA matches, their trees and documents from their collection to construct a theoretical tree between you and your matches.\n\nThe connection may need to go up and down other people’s trees a couple of times, and may be discovered in the tree of someone you both match.\n\nIn summary, “The Theory of Family Relativity” will provide a paper trail theory for how you match your DNA matches. That theory will be for you to confirm or disprove. Gilad says that it’s easier with a tree, but can be accomplished at some level even without one AND it will be released before year end 2018.\n\nSixth, a new triangulated chromosome browser that compared up to 7 people simultaneously.\n\nDownloads are being added as well.\n\nMyHeritage is focusing a marketing drive in Europe. Their market research revealed that in Germany (I think,) only 22% of the population had even heard of DNA testing. Their goal is to infiltrate that market space.\n\nFrance Gilad…focus on France😊\n\nGilad has christened 2018 “The Year of the Segment.”\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, Gilad added even MORE items.\n\nPaper trail theories and connections to explain DNA matches.\n\nTheories genetically of how your matches connect to you.\n\nClustering of triangulated segments.\n\nAutomatic chromosome painting.\n\nIdentification and recreation of ancestors through the testing of multiple descendants by creating an “ancestral segment bank,” of sorts.\n\nResurrecting the DNA of dead ancestors which would be made into a kit for matching. For example, your grandfather.\n\nAutomatic tree building.\n\nIf you’re sitting there with your mouth hanging open in shock…well, so was I. This is what I’ve talked about for years, now coming to fruition.\n\nGilad credits these strides to a combination of vision, applied technology and very smart people!\n\nAll of these development items are either in beta or past proof of concept. Some are available now, some shortly, the “Tree of Family Relativity” by the end of 2018.\n\nTruthfully, I don’t even know what to say after that massive announcement, except transfer your DNA results to MyHeritage. If you ever had doubt, it’s gone now.\n\nFinishing Up\n\nIn the Innovation Showcase competition, obviously DNAPainter won first place, but the rest of the entrants also deserve recognition. Rootsfinder and ItRunsInMyFamily took second and third. You may want to go and take a look for yourself.\n\nMatchCompare https://sortingdnacousins.blogspot.ca/\n\nGno-mine http://gno-mine.com/\n\nItRunsInMyFamily http://www.itrunsinmyfamily.com/\n\nOrigins (Lillian and David Mann) http://www.heirloomsoftware.com/origins/\n\nRootsFinder (Dallan Quass) http://www.rootsfinder.com/\n\nI have not had a chance to review these myself, so you’ll have to let me know what you think.\n\nApparently LivingDNA made an announcement as well. Many vendors make private appointments with bloggers, movers and shakers at RootsTech. In the past few days I’ve been fortunate enough to have private meetings with Ancestry, Family Tree DNA and MyHeritage. Living DNA is not on that list. I did stop by their booth today, but the right people weren’t there.\n\nWe’ve known for some time that matching was to be released in 2018, but we didn’t know that LivingDNA planned to reconstruct trees from genetic data alone, with no trees or other information involved.\n\nYou can read the announcement for yourself here.\n\nI don’t anticipate that I’ll have the opportunity to meet with a Living DNA representative to garner additional information, unfortunately.\n\nI would be more comfortable with this goal if they had matching experience at all. MyHeritage, with their early out-the-door matching issues is proof of how difficult it can be to get matching right.\n\nI also feel matching and tree reconstruction will be much more accurate with a blend of trees, documents and DNA.\n\nHowever, Living DNA is giving it a shot, and everyone has to start someplace. I will be very interested in what their new product will look like and how well it will work.\n\nOn the way out the door this evening, I noticed a bunch of teenagers who had obviously been to the conference, having fun.\n\nVarious vendors give away ribbons to attach to the bottom of your badge.\n\nThese kids had obviously been very busy. I enjoy seeing young people having good clean fun, and especially if those young people are the future of genealogy!\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nDisclosure\n\nI receive a small contribution when you click on some of the links to vendors in my articles.

And it’s only Day 1 of this great adventure!\n\nSince y’all are coming with me, I’m going to share from the beginning.\n\nThis is my first time at RootsTech, so I’m walking through the experience from start to finish. Yesterday was Day 0 and today is Day 1.\n\nBefore leaving Michigan, I took a “prayer walk” around the labyrinth in the yard, grateful for the lovely flying weather. Retrospectively, I’m so glad I took these few minutes, because later, I would need every ounce of patience I could muster.\n\nYesterday, I spent the day in the airport and in the air.\n\nYes, I bought the cool double helix t-shirt from DNAGeeks, because I am one😊\n\nI arrived in Salt Lake City at night. The Marriott Salt Lake Downtown at City Creek, across from the conference center, where I’m staying is a short taxi ride from the airport, $25. Other hotels provide shuttle service, but the Marriott does not.\n\nThe driver was very nice and informative and I actually enjoyed the ride. There is abundant transportation in baggage claim.\n\nI was excited to wake up in Salt Lake City, this morning.\n\nThe first thing I saw on my phone was this:\n\nI subscribe to “This Day in History,” and you might be interested too. It’s free and often gives me perspective about my ancestors’ lives.\n\nHow appropriate when I’m destined to see awesome genetic genealogy presentations today.\n\nSalt Lake City is truly beautiful. Looking out my hotel room, I can see the conference center across the street and the beautiful mountains in the background. Since I arrived in the dark, this was a truly beautiful surprise! A visual delight.\n\nThankfully, there’s a Starbucks in the hotel lobby, and the conference center is across the street. And there’s no new snow. Let’s hope that holds all week!\n\nInteresting signs outside the conference center. Wasn’t quite sure what to make of this. I think it’s art.\n\nEarly conference registration opened yesterday, allowing attendees to pick up their badges early “to avoid the long lines” today. I couldn’t do that because of the flight schedule, so I hoped that the lines wouldn’t be too awful this morning. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nI talked to people in the elevator that waited two and a half hours in line yesterday. Yes, that’s not a typo.\n\nThis conference has a paid registration of over 14,000 participants.\n\nInside the conference center, I quickly discovered that the line is so long that you literally, and I do mean quite literally, cannot see the beginning/end.\n\nNow for that gratitude list. Because Family Tree DNA is hosting my meet-up this evening, they added me to their list of people with access to their booth. Therefore, my registration pickup did not require the two and a half hour wait that other people endured.\n\nI almost feel guilty, and I had absolutely no idea how lucky I was.\n\nI physically could not have stood for 2.5 hours in line with the knee/broken femur issue from the fall last summer. Walking I can do, but 2.5 hours standing is excessive.\n\nOk, what else is there to see?\n\nThe vendor area in the Expo Hall won’t be open until this evening, beginning at 6.\n\nHere’s a sneak preview during setup.\n\nAfter I retrieved my registration, I proceeded to find Ballroom E for Diahan Southerd and Louise Cooke’s talk about “A DNA Match with No Tree? No Problem,” except I discovered that the session room had been full since 9AM, more than half an hour before the session started.\n\nThankfully there are MANY very friendly volunteers who are wearing teal t-shirts shirts and have infinite patience with confused and frustrated conference attendees. Bless those people!\n\nI asked a volunteer if any of the Ballroom sessions had any available seats, and guess what – they were all full.\n\nNow, this is really disappointing, especially since I had carefully mapped out in advance through the conference app the sessions I wanted to attend. In fact, the hallway was full of people who wanted to attend sessions, any of these sessions, but couldn’t.\n\nSpeaking of super-friendly volunteers, meet Josh Hall. He works for Family Search, and he’s one of the people coordinating the legions of volunteers. I spoke with him for a few minutes, and he had a great story. See his missing tooth? He said, “When a 2 year old wants a cookie, give it to them.”\n\nI laughed out loud, a much needed reprieve from frustration. Then he told me that he really ran into another kid on the playground years ago, but the 2 year old story is much better. His tooth is going to be replaced shortly, but then he won’t have this great story to tell!\n\nAside from being super friendly, Josh was genuinely interested in suggestions to help people eliminate the confusion factor and to improve the conference experience.\n\nI suggested that mailing the registrations and bags to attendees, in advance of the conference, even if they had to charge a $10 shipping fee would be well worth eliminating the two and a half hour lines. That would also facilitate attendees being able to attend the early sessions, which started before most people could get through the conference registration line.\n\nHowever, given that the sessions were full, it wouldn’t have mattered if they got through the registration line – they STILL wouldn’t have had access to the sessions. RootsTech needs to do a better job of sizing the facility/conference to the number of attendees.\n\nAdditionally, some “you are here” types of signs at entrance doors would be really useful.\n\nAfter Josh and I finished our conversation, I spent some time trying to familiarize myself with this massive facility. I wanted to scope out where the restrooms and other classrooms were for later classes.\n\nThe facility has a nice area on the second floor for people to sit with computers and such.\n\nBTW, I love this architecture!\n\nThe second class I wanted to attend, given by Ancestry titled “Behind Your DNA Results” started at 11 in one of the second floor classrooms. I arrived about 10:30, thinking I could go inside the room as soon as the people from the earlier session left.\n\nI was about to receive the shock of my life, because the line for this session was ALREADY down the entire length of the hallway. Literally hundreds of people who were never going to fit into that room\n\nThis is about half way down the line and it literally reached to the end of the hallway.\n\nI felt really sorry for these people, because they were doing to stand in this long line only to discover that they weren’t going to get into the session they wanted and the rest of the rooms were full too.\n\nHow the heck is this happening?\n\nFirst, DNA is a VERY popular subject. But that’s not all.\n\nLet’s Do Some Math\n\nTwo sessions were held this morning. The first session slot offered a total of 17 different sessions you could select from, and the second offered 20.\n\nLet’s say that only 10,000 (of the 14,000 total) people are here today. 10,000 people divided by 17 sessions means that the sessions have 588 people each. Even if only 5000 are here today, that’s still 294 people per session. If 14,000 people are here, that’s 823 people per session and there is no way these rooms are set up to handle anyplace near this kind of capacity.\n\nThis means that many of the people who not only spent the money to register, but to travel here and stay in hotels on average of $150 per night aren’t going to be able to attend the sessions they are paying so dearly to attend. For me, this amounts to over $2000 already.\n\nIf you physically can’t stand in long lines for extended periods, you’re not going to be able to attend ANY of the sessions, because the lines for the next session are beginning long before the previous sessions is over. Obviously, if you need to be in line for the next session, you can’t be in a previous one, unless you can somehow clone yourself.\n\nTo say I’m disappointed is an understatement.\n\nRegroup\n\nOk, I’m here and clearly not going to be able to attend sessions, so what am I going to do to make lemonade out of this one?\n\nI went to Starbucks to get a coffee and think. I got some chocolate too!\n\nI’m meeting people, friends old and new.\n\nThis morning, I briefly met Thomas MacEntee of GeneaBloggers fame.\n\nI didn’t grab his picture, but hope to see him again. We’re both old-timers in this field and have never met before in person.\n\nI ran into Janine Cloud and the Family Tree DNA crew in the hotel lobby and got to spend some time with them talking. It’s so incredibly hectic at the FTDNA conference that I never actually get a chance to talk to these people, so this was a nice treat for a few minutes.\n\nWe grabbed a sandwich in the coffee shop and had a picnic in the hotel lobby.\n\nHey, sometimes fun is where you make it.\n\nI ran into Bob McLaren, long time administrator of the McLaren DNA Project. It was SO MUCH FUN to see Bob again. We’ve been doing genetic genealogy together for 18 years and also share a technology interest as well.\n\nBob is almost always dressed in his McLaren kilt at these types of function. I told him I love his purse. He told me this is a sporran. I have sporran envy and want one!\n\nIt’s exciting to see old friends.\n\nI’m looking forward to the meetup this evening at 6:30.\n\nI can’t wait to meet you this evening in the Family Tree DNA booth. I’ll be there for sure at 6:30 and perhaps earlier, so come by. I’m probably not going to attempt to go to the general session at 4 due to the obvious space issues.\n\nI’m going to spend more time in the Expo Hall with vendors.\n\nSince going to sessions isn’t a viable option, I’m going to visit lots of vendors and take photos for you. I will also be reporting on show specials for DNA products. Right now, I know that both MyHeritage and FTDNA will be having specials of some sort, and I’m sure other vendors will be too.\n\nI do have some appointments with vendors to discuss products and new features, and I’ll be sharing those discoveries with you. Shows like this are great for seeing all the vendors under one roof and talking to the employees.\n\nI’m going to the Family History Library, and you’re coming along with me\n\nOne needs a research plan to visit the FHL and get the most out of the records, and I don’t have a plan in advance, BUT, I will construct one as best I can on the fly. As a genealogist, who among us doesn’t have a line or two that needs research.\n\nSummary\n\nOk, I’ve had to regroup. Here are some of the take-aways from day 1.\n\nIf you can’t physically stand in long lines, arrange for a scooter or don’t attend this conference. Josh said that RootsTech is genuinely interested in reducing the confusion and making the conference easier, and I sincerely hope that he is right and that they succeed. I’m not angry, just extremely disappointed.\n\nPeople are incredibly friendly here and helpful.\n\nThe meetup tonight is going to be awesome.\n\nSeeing friends and making new acquaintances is sometimes the best part of…well…anything.\n\nThe vendors’ booths are going to be really interesting! I’m going to learn something new, for sure.\n\nYou can construct a research plan on the fly if you have to.\n\nCan’t wait to visit the FHL – kind of like Mecca for genealogists.\n\nI’m going to make lemonade and I’m going to have a great time no matter what!!!\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nDisclosure\n\nI receive a small contribution when you click on some of the links to vendors in my articles.

I thought the sun would never shine again, but somehow you arranged a gloriously sunny day to celebrate your funeral, and today as well. A fitting gift from a long-haul truck driver.\n\nSince you can’t call me anymore as you crisscross the country in your big rig named The Black Pearl, I’ll just have to write to you and hope that the same airwaves that used to bring me your voice now transport my message to you.\n\nYou see, I finally found your father, or have at least narrowed the candidates and discovered your surname.\n\nI remember how many years you searched, painfully and fruitlessly. DNA was the key, now that enough people have tested.\n\nIn 2004 when I finally found you, you explained how your mother had teased you with the names of at least three different men that were supposedly your father. How you tracked them down and arranged to visit. They were nice, understanding and sympathetic, but they weren’t your father.\n\nI suspect that perhaps your mother didn’t know, considering the circumstances. We won’t revisit that, except to say it saddened me greatly to see you suffer so based on activities you had no part in. Worse yet, she left you an envelope hidden in a drawer with your name on it after her death in which you were positive you would find the answer. You ripped it open, but once again, no answer was forthcoming. A final disappointment. The first of two words that come to mind is heartless.\n\nOur introductory phone call when I explained my understanding of who your father was – my father – which explained why you carry the Estes surname was one of the most emotional days of my life. You were finally found. A hole filled. The gap of almost 50 years gone.\n\nYou told me how you opened the envelope I had sent with the photos of “our” father, whom you already knew as a family member, but not as your father. I sent photos because I didn’t want you to think I was some crazy lady, or that my letter was some kind of scam.\n\nYou’d discover soon enough my own personal brand of crazy😊\n\nOf course, at that time, I didn’t understand who in that family was actually your biological mother – and what that meant in terms of complex family dynamics. You’re so fortunate that, for the most part, your grandmother raised you, at least reducing your mother’s damage.\n\nA few days after our first phone call, we met for the first time, talking for hours like we had known each other forever. Time and place simply disappeared and we floated on our own wave of giddy happiness. I still have that photo by my desk, with your arm around me. You watch over me every single day, right beside me.\n\nYou shared that I was your only living family member, except for your children, and how you had always longed for a sibling.\n\nI knew in that moment what family meant to you, and that if needed, you would die for me. Literally.\n\nI loved you instantly and completely.\n\nI came to know you as a grizzled, hard-driving, long-haired tattooed trucker with a short temper for injustice – to animals or people. God help anyone that abused someone you loved, anyone in need, or an animal.\n\nYou told me you never said “the L word,” love. Tough as you were, love would make you vulnerable. Your wife of many years confirmed that to me. I just smiled. Love doesn’t need words.\n\nAs I said goodbye the second time, a few weeks later, you hugged me and whispered softly, almost inaudibly in my ear, “Love you, Sis.”\n\n“What?,” I asked and you grumbled, “You heard me,” afraid that someone else would hear. I just smiled and hugged you again, tears running down both our faces. Except, yours were just allergies of course.\n\nYou told me every time we talked after that, because as a truck driver, we never really knew when our last conversation would be. Our last words spoken, always, from that day forth, were “love you.” I smiled through tears every time and I suspect you did too.\n\nDanged allergies.\n\nWe had already missed so many years.\n\nI still hear that Dave, and I know the next time I meet you, I’ll hear it again.\n\nDamn, I miss you.\n\nI knew before you died that we weren’t half-siblings after all. The original two paternity/siblingship tests we took suggested that, but they weren’t conclusive and needless to say, we certainly didn’t want to believe that message.\n\nOur next clue was when I was eliminated as your liver donor candidate, although the medical team would not confirm why. However, the “new” autosomal DNA tests we took not long before you died proved it beyond any doubt.\n\nI never had the heart to tell you.\n\nIt would have broken both of our hearts and we were already indelibly bonded as family. Nothing, no DNA test would ever change that.\n\nRemember that half heart I gave you to protect you on your journeys? You took half of my real one with you when you left.\n\nFor the sake of honesty, I tiptoed around the siblingship subject, testing the water. The limited commentary you did make told me that perhaps you already suspected, but were strongly rejecting that possibility out of hand. End of subject.\n\nThe truth could wait until the afterlife.\n\nHowever, I made a vow to you that you never knew about. One day I would identify your father. I would find that puzzle piece.\n\nNow herein lies a great irony, the best irony of all. I have to tell you – you’re going to love this story. Hope you’re sitting down on a cloud.\n\nYour grandmother raised you in the Catholic church and sent you to Catholic school. You left the church in high school, but those childhood teachings have a way of taking hold permanently.\n\nDuring your last days in the hospital and then in hospice, you requested a priest to do a “Last Confession” and whatever rituals are completed in the Catholic religion to prepare for death.\n\nThe hospital called the local priest. Then, hospice called the local priest.\n\nNo response, at all.\n\nThen, your wife called the local Catholic churches.\n\nStill no response, at all.\n\nThen I called.\n\nNothing.\n\nWhen I saw you that day, I knew the end was very near.\n\nStill no priest to do your Last Rites.\n\nI’m sure you remember that Jim, my husband, a former Eucharistic minister in the Catholic church before he sinned by getting divorced and continued sinning by remarrying to a non-Catholic heard your last confession. He performed the anointing of oil, (my chapstick) and holy water, (bottled water from my purse,) both of which I blessed with my very own hands. HERESY!\n\nJim was horrified and was just certain I was going to be struck dead by lightning on the spot for my heretical actions, but I did what needed to be done. Just like you would have done for me. Whatever you and Jim did in that room together with the chapstick and Dasani holy water brought you great peace. That’s all that mattered.\n\nAnd I survived to tell the story.\n\nLove you Brother, and I surely hope you’re not stuck in purgatory because of my last minute battlefield fox-hole improvisations. 😉\n\nYour wife was a Baptist, which might have been part of why the Priest never showed up, or even called. Clearly, there wasn’t going to be a Catholic funeral for any number of reasons, not the least of which was because you were cremated by that time.\n\nYes, I know, yet another “sin.”\n\nOh well, we just added it to the long list and St. Peter will have to blame us because you really didn’t get to vote, being dead and all.\n\nYou had volunteered at the Baptist church, refinishing the basketball floor and other odd jobs, so your wife invited the Baptist preacher to “preach your funeral.”\n\nBeing in the middle of the winter, we worried about the weather, with me arriving from out-of-state and many truckers that had known you for decades driving hard to get back in time. We scheduled your funeral for 4 on Friday to accommodate their schedules so they could arrive in time and didn’t have to sacrifice pay to attend.\n\nI remember hearing those big rigs parked outside the funeral home, lined up, up and down the street, their running lights turned on, with their engines all running in a rumbling trucker-tribute to you.\n\nI smiled then to think about how much you would have liked that. The neighbors must have been mortified.\n\nThe room at the funeral home was full, standing room only, overflowing into the lobby and outside when it was time for your funeral to begin. Your photos were on the table in the front, and everyone was seated and waiting.\n\nBut, there was no preacher.\n\nAnother 5 minutes passed. Then 7. Then 10.\n\nThe preacher didn’t answer his cell phone.\n\nEveryone was shuffling and shifting restlessly.\n\nThe funeral home said they couldn’t help.\n\nI looked at your wife, who was in no shape to do anything.\n\nShe looked at me and said, famously, “You have to do something.”\n\nOH GOD.\n\nWere you there with us? Do you remember how I started your funeral?\n\nI just walked up front, picked up the microphone and said:\n\n“Hi, I’m Dave’s sister. I bet most of you never knew Dave had a sister. Well, he does.”\n\nI told about how we met.\n\nI told them how much I loved you.\n\nAnd how much you loved me. Sorry, your secret is out!\n\nI told them that your gruff and tough exterior disguised a soft soul afflicted with pain.\n\nI told them how you rescued animals.\n\nNot everyone knew the story of how you acquired Dio, your abused Rotty, literally rescuing him from the hands of his abusers. But, most everyone knew he rode with you for years. Dio had more miles than most cars. It does my heart good to know the two of you are riding together once again, across the rainbow bridge.\n\nI remember how inconsolably devastated you were when he died as you were fighting your own battle. He went to wait for you and I know the reunion was one of sheer ecstasy.\n\nI told them that I discovered you had taken that awful mountainous Idaho potato run so that you could see me because the drop-off terminal was about 10 miles from my house. Of course, you would never have admitted to that!\n\nI was amused to discover that they thought your “sister,” who you stopped to see regularly, was code for a different kind of relationship. Perhaps because they teased you incessantly about loving your sister😊\n\nThat’s Ok, so did the manager at the hotel down the road where you would park your rig while we went to eat and came to the house to visit for awhile. I explained that you couldn’t get turned around on my dead-end road but he didn’t believe me. Remember the time we finally pulled out both of our IDs and showed him we were both named Estes? The shocked look on his face said it all.\n\nThose were such good days and wonderful surprises when you’d call to say you were coming through.\n\nI miss them so.\n\nI still look in every black truck I see. I know better, but old habits and rituals of love die hard.\n\nI told them how you announced you would sell your house and move up here to care for me when you thought I had cancer. Thankfully, I didn’t have cancer, but that proclamation meant the world to me. You’ll never know how much. Ok, well maybe you know now.\n\nI told them how much you loved your children and how living long enough to walk your daughter down the aisle was your motivation to live for many months while you waited for the transplant that never arrived. I never told them that you didn’t get to.\n\nI told them how much you didn’t want others to make the same mistakes you had – because love you as I do – you weren’t exactly perfect. None of us are.\n\nSo, that day, I became at once the comforter and the preacher. I gave you the ultimate loving send-off on that spectacular sunny winter’s day six years ago. Much like the beautiful day outside today. I always feel that these lovely sunny winter days that melt the snow on the roads are a gift from you.\n\n“Preaching your funeral” was an honor, and one I could never have adequately prepared for. Maybe impromptu was better.\n\nBut there’s one thing I didn’t share with them.\n\nThat you really weren’t my biological brother. It didn’t matter. I don’t know how I could ever have loved you more.\n\nIn spite of thinking your surname really was Estes, biologically, it wasn’t.\n\nBecause you were on the “other side” by then, you already knew the truth. You also knew that it was out of love that I spared you that pain here on earth.\n\nBefore you passed over, you didn’t know that I had secretly sworn an oath to you as well, that one day I would unearth the truth.\n\nDave, that day is today.\n\nAnd now, the ultimate irony. Karma at it’s very best.\n\nYou see, you never needed a priest. Despite all of our unsuccessful efforts.\n\nBecause you are one.\n\nFor years at Family Tree DNA, you’ve had matches to multiple Y DNA surnames.\n\nRecently, two men tested whose surname was Priest, descended from John Anderson Priest born in 1798 in North Carolina.\n\nThey are your closest matches, but still, given the variety of surnames that you matched, I paid it little mind.\n\nThat is, until today.\n\nYour autosomal DNA returned a match to a first cousin, whose surname just happens to be Priest. Looking at your matches in common, I saw several people with that surname. About 4 hours later, I had the relationships mostly unraveled!\n\nSo yes, indeed, you, my dear brother, are a Priest.\n\nI can hear you laughing heartily.\n\nEstes can be your middle name now.\n\nDavid Estes Priest, with no comma. Our new private joke, even if you do have to enjoy it from afar.\n\nI hope you can truly rest in priest, er, peace now. It’s solved. The last tie to bind you here is gone.\n\nFly free.\n\nI’ll see you overhome.\n\nLove you.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nDisclosure\n\nI receive a small contribution when you click on some of the links to vendors in my articles.

I am leaving this story because parts of this information have been on the internet for some time – and I want to be sure the entire story of why people thought Irene was a Schlosser, and how we know she isn’t, is available. For the rest of the story, including her correct surname, click here.\n\nJust when you think you can’t wring out one more drop of history, you’re at the dead end of the road and out of luck entirely – one of those genealogical acts of kindness for which we all long arrives at just the right time.\n\nUnveiling the layers of Conrad Schlosser’s life reminds me very much of peeling that proverbial onion. I’m making progress, but some tears have been shed!\n\nIn my recent article about Conrad Schlosser, I felt very fortunate to establish his birth year as 1635, especially since the church records in Steinwenden begin in 1684. It’s there that we first find Conrad in 1685 with his children marrying and baptizing their own children.\n\nConrad’s burial on February 13, 1694 at age 59 provides his birth year as either 1634 or 1635, but it doesn’t tell us where.\n\nI had to utilize the history of the region, to discern more.\n\nWho Lived in Steinwenden?\n\nLocal historians tell us that in 1685, when Conrad’s daughters were marrying and having children, only 6 families lived in Steinwenden with a total of 25 people. We also know that many Swiss immigrants settled here.\n\nConrad Schlosser’s family at that time consisted of:\n\nHimself\n\nAnna Ursula, his wife, last name unknown\n\nAnna Catharina, daughter, born about 1661, never married\n\nAnna Maria, daughter, born before 1665, married in 1685\n\nCarl, son, born about 1664, married in 1701\n\nAnna Ursula, daughter, born about 1676, married in 1696\n\nJohannes Peter, son born about 1680, died 1691\n\nJohannes, son, born about 1680, died 1701\n\nThat’s a total of 8 people living in his household. He had another daughter, Irene Charitas, who was married by June of 1685 when her child was baptized, so she and her husband may have counted as a second of those 6 households.\n\nIrene Charitas, daughter born about 1660 who was already married to Johann Michael Muller.\n\nWith just Conrad’s family alone, we have at least 10 or 11 of the 25 reported residents accounted for.\n\nTherefore, putting 2 and 2 together, it seemed logical that Conrad Schlosser was one of those Swiss immigrants, especially since we know that Johann Michael Muller that married Conrad’s daughter WAS a Swiss immigrant.\n\nBut guess what?\n\nI was wrong.\n\nConrad did not arrive with the Swiss immigrant group in 1684 or 1685.\n\nMy German friend, Chris, found an invaluable record in this article:\n\n“Johann Jakob Hauser around 1660 constructor of the “moor mill” in Steinwenden. During the 30 years war, the region Steinwemden, including among others the villages Weltersbach and Steinwenden, was heavily depopulated. It is only in a tax list in 1671, that inhabitants are again listed, among them Johann Jakob Hauser, miller in Steinwenden. [compare the copy from 1800 of a not conserved original; copy printed in: “Weltersbach. Streifzüge durch die Ortsgeschichte”, a.a.O., page 19]. Around 1660, Johann Jakob Hauser and CONRAD SCHLOSSER rebuilt the moor mill. In the 1680s, the mill was owned by Johann Schenkel.”\n\nIt seems that Conrad was in or near Steinwenden all along, which means that Anna Ursula, his wife, who was having children by 1661 had to have been there too. Weltersbach is only a hop, skip and a jump from Steinwenden. Literally, maybe half a mile.\n\nOf course, we don’t know if Conrad Schlosser and Anna Ursula arrived from some other place together to make their home in the Steinwenden area, or perhaps their families arrived together or from different places at the same time.\n\nIn Search of Taxes and a Mill\n\nThe next several days after this breakthrough were spent in a frantic scramble with a friend in Salt Lake City trying to find the historical tax list cited in the paragraph above. Unfortunately, that document does not live in Salt Lake City, but in two libraries in Europe. Whoever thought the Mormon Church WOULDN’T have something!\n\nI reached out again to Chris, asking if he knew of any resources, and indeed, he did the logical thing. He tracked down the author of the book, Roland Paul, and e-mailed him. Well, duh. Sometimes we don’t think of the simple solutions. Of course, thankfully, Chris is a native German speaker, which overcomes the next hurdle for me.\n\nRoland Paul, historian of the Steinwenden region, as it turns out, had also written an article about the “Moormuhle” in Weltersbach, the very mill that Conrad was helping to restore.\n\nI generally use Google translate, but the page about the mill is entirely locked down, it seems, and Google translate doesn’t work, nor can I copy and paste manually into a German/English translator. Chris tells me that the article is not about the early history of the mill that Conrad restored, and says that Conrad’s mill was torn down recently. Unfortunately, that means there is nothing left of the 1660 mill that Conrad rebuilt to see today.\n\nCrumb!\n\nIt’s fun to look at the old photo in that article that is the home of the mill built in 1825 by a man whose name just happened to be Adam Muller. Of course, the word Muller translates literally into the profession, “miller” and every village needed at least one, so there are lots of German Miller families. To the best of our knowledge, this Muller isn’t related to our Johannes Michael Muller, but I’d love to have a Y DNA test of one of his Muller descendants to know for sure.\n\nIf any Miller male descends from this man, I have a free Y DNA test for you!\n\nIronically, I spy the same doorway in that article that was in a photo taken by cousin Rev. Richard Miller taken in 1996 when he visited Steinwenden. He obviously saw the word Muller above the doorway too.\n\nAlthough this building is not the same mill that Conrad rebuilt in 1660, it’s still a part of Steinwenden’s history. Since it was only built in 1825, it wouldn’t have been there in the late 1600s and early 1700s where our family walked up and down these streets.\n\nStrolling Through Steinwenden\n\nSince we’re visiting Steinwenden anyway, let’s take a stroll down the very streets that Conrad Schlosser, his wife Anna Ursula, Johann Michael Mueller the first, Johann Michael Mueller the second, his wife Susanna Agnes Berchtol, and her parents Hans Berchtol and Anna Christina walked down. Yep, the whole family was here and many made the decision to immigrate to America together too. This is our ancient home!\n\nI just love the character of these old buildings.\n\nWelcome to Steinwenden!\n\nCousin Richard was very generous to share his photos. Above, the 1825 mill again.\n\nI recognize this building (above) as residing in the old village center, across the street from the contemporary church built in 1852, which is not the same structure as the old church. I suspect the old church was build in the same location, however. I’m hoping for confirmation of that fact soon.\n\nCousin Richard visited the current church in 1996 and they took him to the bell tower, the only remnant of the original church. Indeed, I wouldn’t be surprised to discover that Conrad as well as his older male children along with Johann Michael Muller (the first) helped construct the original church.\n\nIn the bell tower, we may well be looking at stones placed with their own hands, their fingerprints still in the mortar. If this bell tower could only talk!\n\nThe 1656 and 1671 Tax Lists\n\nAccording to the records unearthed by Chris, there were no inhabitants of Steinwenden in 1656 as indicated in this statement, below.\n\nRoland Paul was generous enough to send Chris a copy of the tax list from Weltersbach in 1671, along with some additional information which Chris was kind enough to translate.\n\nFind enclosed the scan. Was Conrad Schlosser an ancestor of your acquaintance in the US? He [Conrad Schlosser] rebuilt the moor mill together with Jakob Hauser around 1660, after the mill had been destroyed in the 30 years war. My ancestors bought the mill in 1719. I am very interested in more details about Schlosser and Hauser, even more so since I currently write on an extensive chronicle about the moor mill.\n\nSo Roland’s ancestor bought the mill about 60 years after Jakob Hauser and Conrad Schlosser rebuilt it. Needless to say, I can’t wait to read his chronicle.\n\nIf rebuilding the mill was occurring as the area was being rebuilt and repopulated after the 30 Years War, in 1660, about the time that Conrad married – might this perhaps suggest that he and Jakob Hauser were potentially related?\n\nI can’t help but wonder if Conrad’s wife, Anna Ursula is Jakob Hauser’s daughter. Of course, there is nothing more, yet, to suggest this, BUT with few or no other families in the region, Conrad had to meet Anna Ursula somehow and we do know what Conrad was doing in 1660, about the time they married, and where.\n\nPlease note that this is unbridled speculation, and I probably shouldn’t even be thinking this out loud, let alone in print. But maybe, just maybe, someone out there actually has some information about Jakob Hauser, the miller, and his family.\n\nFrom Chris:\n\n[The tax list] does not include information about Conrad Schlosser at all, only the names of the Steinwenden miller Johann Jakob Hauser, who rebuilt the moor mill together with Conrad Schlosser. Johann Jakob Hauser and Johannes Ingbert, a Swiss immigrant, were the only two inhabitants of the village of Weltersbach in 1671. But no names included here from the neighbor village Steinwenden, where Conrad Schlosser supposedly lived.\n\nWhere was Conrad Schlosser living? Was he living at the mill with Jakob Hauser or with his family? He had to be living in close enough proximity to work at the mill every day, and there are no other villages nearby.\n\nI can’t help but notice that Johannes Ingbert was mentioned as a Swiss immigrant. This suggests that Swiss immigration began long before we find the Muller family in Steinwenden intermarried with Conrad Schlosser’s daughter in 1685.\n\nChris also found two additional resources, tax lists that might contain information from neighboring villages. Would we be lucky enough to find Conrad there?\n\n“Schatzungsbelagregister” from 1656 (no inhabitants in Steinwenden, but maybe interesting anyway because of family names in neighbor villages) and “Schatzungsprotokoll” from 1683-1684, available here at FamilySearch.\n\nThe 1683/1684 tax lists are from just before the records began on September 21, 1684 in the church in Steinwenden.\n\nOf course, all of this begs the question of where Conrad’s children were baptized between 1661 and 1685. And sadly, given the time and place, there were probably several children buried someplace too. Did Conrad Schlosser and Jakob Hauser establish a cemetery for their family members?\n\nIf so, where?\n\nThe Old Cemetery Hill\n\nAs it turns out, Chris just might have found the answer to that question too.\n\nMy speculation was that the cemetery was around the original church, but that would not have been until 1684 and after. What about between 1660 and 1684? And what about before the 30 Year’s War? Did the new inhabitants just continue to bury their loved ones in the same location as the inhabitants before the war?\n\nWe don’t have the exact answer to that, but Chris did find some very interesting information.\n\nI think the old church tower would be most probably at the same location or very close to the current church. The current Steinwenden cemetery is today Northwest of the Steinwenden church. I attach a Google Maps screenshot with the Protestant church labeled with a green circle and the current cemetery labeled in red surroundings as well. That, however, does not answer at all the question, where Steinwenden inhabitants were buried at the time of Michael Müller and Conrad Schlosser. Since Steinwenden only counted a few families these days, it is quite possible that burials first took place around or close to the church and that only later on a larger cemetery was constructed. The cemetery then may have moved another time later on.\n\nChris provided the map below, with the current cemetery boxed in red, the contemporary church in green, and the old cemetery hill with the red balloon.\n\nChris provided a link to an article in German, which Google translate doesn’t, which states (as translated by Chris):\n\nThe Steinwenden centre is formed by the protestant church and the village square and the well system south of the church. Only a few metres south of it, on the old cemetery hill, is the local community house,newly constructed in 1992 and surrounded by a public park.\n\nThe photos in the article of Steinwenden are so enchantingly beautiful that they make my heart skip beats. I can just see my ancestors here.\n\nThe Location of the Mill\n\nChris found the location of the mill that Conrad restored. In the aerial photo below, the mill is the red balloon and the small grey pin near the top is the church in the center of Steinwenden.\n\nGoogle tells me that it’s one third mile or a 6-minute walk from the mill to church.\n\nSteinwenden and Weltersbach are neighboring villages and obviously, Conrad lived someplace in this vicinity.\n\nThe location that Chris pointed out as the location of the mill can be seen below, as closely as I can zoom in. The creek, Moorback, runs between Moormuhle, Haupstrasse and Muhlbergstrasse. It was here, right here, that Conrad worked in 1660. It may have been here that he lived as well.\n\nI can’t tell you how much I wish that Google Street View was enabled here. Oh, to drive down this street!\n\nRabbit Holes\n\nYou know, there just have to be a few rabbit holes. And I simply cannot help myself, so let’s take a look and see if there are any rabbits. First, let me say how very blessed I am to have friends, many of whom are blog followers and commenters.\n\nThe one hint about the origins of the Conrad Schlosser family that I do have, or might have, is the location given in this Steinwenden church entry:\n\n28 April 1685 at Steinwenden were married Melchior Clemens, emigrant from Graffschaft Felkenburg with Anna Maria, legitimate daughter of Cunradt Schlosser, the same (place?).\n\nOf course, what does “the same place” mean? Does it mean the same place at the time the record was written, or the same place as in Graffschaft Felkenburg?\n\nUpdate: Chris looked at the record and suggests that “the same place” refers back to where they were married – meaning Steinwenden, especially since we know that Conrad Schlosser was in the area by 1660. However, I am leaving the rest of this section for context…and just in case.\n\nAnd if Conrad left Graffschaft Felkenburg in 1660 and Melchoir is listed as being from there in 1685, that’s quite a bit of time difference. Of course, Melchoir’s family could have left at the same time as Conrad, or it might not mean that at all. But, since it IS my ONLY hint, I’m very grateful for all of my friends that are willing to go rabbit-hole hunting with me.\n\nAnother friend, George who draws maps professionally, to support his genealogy habit I’m sure, offered the following:\n\nRoberta, I am by no means an expert on this, but I do draw maps as my day job and so took up your challenge to find out what happened to Graffschaft Felkenburg.\n\nTreating the two words separately, it appears that Graffschaft (Grafschat) was a term for a “county” or “administrative district” (rough understanding) under authority of the Holy Roman Empire. I did find one reference to a “Principality of Felkenburg (Montefalcone) in a Google Book search.\n\nI did a Google search on “Falkenburg County” and came up with the reference on page 465, Appendix II of a book named “Introduction to the study of international law designed as an aid to teaching, and in historical studies” written by Woosley, Theodore D. In 1879.\n\nI have no clue if this is your Graffschaft Felkenburg, but it sounds promising and you may want to now search for Montefalcone.\n\nRoberta, take a look at item # 7 on the following page. The spelling is Falkenburg, but the associated maps might help, or lead you further down the rabbit hole.\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/ancestorsinthepfalz/home/1700—divisions\n\nAnd because one rabbit hole isn’t enough, another friend did some footwork and offered the following:\n\nLooking for Felkenburg and remembering one of the commenters of Conrad Schlosser’s entry said his ancestors with the same surname lived in Alsace, so I tried to google “comté felkenburg”. It seems there’s a Faulquemont in Lorraine which is named Falkenburg or Falkenberg in German, as the region passed between France and Germany quite a few times.\n\nThen trying “Schlosser Faulquemont”, I found a book titled “Inventaire sommaire des archives communales de la ville de Strasbourg antérieures à 1790, rédigé par J. Bruncker, archiviste – Série AA Acts constitutif et politique de la commune, première partie”; roughly “Succinct summary of the district archives of the city of Strasbourg older than 1790, written by J. Brucker, archivist – constitutional and politic actes of the district, first part”.\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=tpkNAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=fr#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nOn page 121, subtitled “correspondance des souverains, corps d’état, gouverneurs, etc.” “AA. 368. (liasse) 46 pièce papier en bon état”\n\n“1530-1536 (suite) […] Réponse du comte Louis à des lettres d’intercession et de recommandation du magistrat de Strasbourg en faveur de Simon Schlosser de Faulquemont, incarcéré”\n\nTranslation:\n\n“correspondence of the monarchs, state, governors, etc.”\n\n“AA. 368. (bundle) 46 piece of paper in good state”\n\n“1530-1536 (continuation) […] Reply from the earl Louis to letters of intercession and recommandation of the magistrate of Strasbourg in favor of Simon Schlosser of Falkenburg, jailed”\n\nSo, there was some Schlosser in Faulquemont, Lorraine, back in 1530. Maybe not your family though, I don’t know how widespread the surname was, but they could be.\n\nAnother interesting entry: “Le comte palatin Louis […] prévient [le magistrat de Strasbourg] que les anabaptistes de Munster ont dépêché un émissaire, nommé Jean de Goele, vers Strasbourg, pour y acheter de la poudre et d’autres munitions de guerre, et que Knipperdolling doit également se rendre dans cette ville”\n\nTranslation:\n\n“the palatin earl Louis […] warn [the magistrate of Strasbourg] that the Anabaptist of Munster send an emissary, named Jean de Goele, to Strasbourg, to buy powder and other war ammunition, and that Knipperdolling must also go to the city”.\n\nEarl Louis would be Louis V, elector palatine\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_V,_Elector_Palatine\n\nHmmm….Anabaptists. This is my Brethren line.\n\nGoogle is my friend too.\n\nI Googled Graffschaft Felkenburg and found an article, in German of course, and a photo of Falkenburg, a location in the Pfalz.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nThe ruin of the Falkenburg lies above Wilgartswiesen in the Palatinate Forest in the district of Südwestpfalz in Rhineland-Palatinate. Like almost all castles in the Palatinate Forest, it is built on a colorful sandstone rock as a rock castle. The Falkenburg was probably built in the 11th century as the successor of the Wilgartaburg and the protection of the neighboring villages.\n\nThe castle was first mentioned in 1246, although the construction of the castle, as with many castles in the area, may have taken place earlier. 44 years later, in 1290, a Werner von Falkenburg was mentioned in a document. From 1300 to 1313, the Falkenburg was pledged to Frederick IV of Leiningen, in 1317 she was mortgaged again, by Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian, this time to the Counts Palatine of the Rhine Rudolf II and Ruprecht I. 1375 Emich V. von Leiningen was the owner of Castle. Although the Falkenburg, which was measured in 1427, survived the German Peasants’ War, it was occupied in 1632 until it was returned to its owner in 1648. It was blown up in 1680 by French troops.\n\nThe fact that this location was destroyed would also explain why the location can’t be found contemporaneously. The additional clue is that the word Graffschaft means administrative district. Together, this seems to make sense. The question is, of course, if it’s accurate.\n\nIf indeed, this is the location, it’s about an hour away from Steinwenden, still well within the Palatinate.\n\nIs any of this relevant to our story? Danged if I know. Remember, we’re in the rabbit hole.\n\nAha, Finding a Rabbit – The 1684 Tax List\n\nMy friend Chris made another incredible find on the tax list from Steinwenden and surrounding villages in 1684.\n\nThe first Schlosser appearance occurs on page 271 at FamilySearch, or the original book page 185.\n\nConrad is listed, but I don’t see any tax calculated for him. The next film in the series is an extracted version of the tax list which gives us the date of April 17, 1684. Note that there is one Hans Jacob Muller, mayor or sheriff (schulteuss) of the Weilerbach court, as well as a several other Mullers listed on the tax list with locations noted.\n\nAlso, Nikel Muller, Hans Muller and Hans Jacob Muller (twice) in Rodenback, along with Hans Jacob Muller in Ertzenhausen.\n\nHans Muller of Porbach and Hans Muller of Schweydelbach. Are you getting the idea that Muller is a common surname?\n\nThe title says this list above is from Weylerbach and Conrad Schlosser is noted as being “of Steinwinden,” although the word looks to be Binwenden. It’s not, it’s the German script. Why is Conrad being taxed or mentioned in Weylerbach?\n\nIt appears that the men listed at the top of this page are the “committee,” according to a German to English translation tool.\n\nWeilerbach and Steinwenden aren’t terribly distant, about 5-6 miles with Rodenbach just beneath Weilerbach.\n\nThe next municipality in the tax book is Steinwenden.\n\nPage 286 begins the tax list, and two pages later, we find Conrad Schlosser in the middle of the page.\n\nThe tax records for Steinwenden begin on FamilySearch page 288 or book page 220. That’s the original page 113 of the original book at the bottom right, or page 220 at the top right.\n\nHis actual tax is calculated two pages later, on page 289 at FamilySearch, or page 222 of the original book.\n\nOn this list, it shows that he either pays or is valued at 745, as compared to other people’s worth between 75 and 485 with the exception of one man, Jacob Nagel who has a value or pays a tax of 800 whatever the money was at that time.\n\nThere are a total of 15 entries, including Conrad. His son-in-law, Johann Michael Muller nor any Muller is listed other than the Mullers listed above. Are any of these relevant. Possibly Hans Nickel Muller, but I don’t really know.\n\nHere’s the translated page including the households.\n\nThis is slightly different than the earlier information that Steinwenden had a total of only 6 families comprised of 25 people in 1684. This looks to be 15 households if you don’t count the people listed above as a “committee” with no tax amount. It’s also possible that some of these families lived in the same household.\n\nChris says the term “aussmarcker” is an old fashioned word that means a person who does not live within a parish and don’t have full resident rights, but owns lots in the parish area.\n\nBernhardt Schlosser’s Widow\n\nPerhaps the best nugget is saved for last, on the following page (290 FamilySearch, original page 225) where we find the widow of Bernhardt Schlosser listed separately.\n\nThis widow is not taxed on a house, so it would be reasonable to speculate that indeed, Bernhardt might have been the father of Conrad and the still-living-widow is Conrad’s mother. What are the possible scenarios?\n\nGiven that Conrad was born about 1634, and the widow is found in 1684, 50 years later, if this is Conrad’s mother, she would be between 70 and 90 years old. Chris points out that she could have not had a house and been living with Conrad (or someone else) or she could have had a home in such poor condition that it was considered to be worth nothing.\n\nBernardt could also be the brother of Conrad, so this widow could have been Conrad’s sister-in-law.\n\nIt’s also possible, but less likely, that Bernhardt is a son of Conrad, born around or before 1660 and having died before 1684, not long after marriage. This is the less likely of the various scenarios.\n\nOne thing we do know, though, is that the widow herself surely perished (or remarried, if she was young) very shortly after the tax date of April 21, 1684, because the Steinwenden church records begin in September 1684 and no widow of Bernhardt (or Gerhardt as it’s translated in this document) Schlosser is found in the death records. It’s also worth mentioning that the only records from 1684 in the book are baptisms and the death records don’t begin until 1685. Does that mean no one died or was married between September and December of 1684, or were those records simply not recorded? We don’t know the answer to that question either.\n\nConrad’s Wife\n\nThe two surnames we have from the 1671 tax list are Hauser and Ingbert. By 1684, just 13 years later, I don’t find either surname in either Weylersbach or Steinwenden.\n\nDid the miller Johann Jacob Hauser move away? What about Johannes Ingbert? Did they die or move? I did find death records for both Ingbert (Ingvert) and his wife and both were born about 1600, so they were of an age that they could certainly have been having children in 1633. I find no records for any Hauser.\n\nWas one of these two families the parents of Anna Ursula Schlosser, Conrad’s wife?\n\nIf not, would we be lucky enough to find Anna Ursula’s family name among those on the tax lists in 1684? Perhaps if not her parents, then maybe uncles or brothers?\n\nHere is an extracted list of the Steinwenden families in 1684:\n\nSamuel Hoffmann\n\nHans Georg Schumacher\n\nConrady Schlosser\n\nNickel Orsel\n\nHans Sprentz\n\nGerdardt (Bernhardt?) Schlosser\n\nJohann Engbiess (is this possibly Johannes Ingbert?)\n\nHans Peter Frolich\n\nSimon Christmann\n\nJacob Schenckel (owned the mill according to local history)\n\nJacob Pletsch\n\nJacob Holtzhauser\n\nJacob Nagel\n\nMichael Feyhel\n\nGeorg Jeserang\n\nIs it too much to hope that Anna Ursula’s family is among these names?\n\nSummary\n\nWell, thanks for my rabbit-hole indulgence.\n\nWhere are we in evaluating where Conradt, probably along with Bernhardt Schlosser, came from?\n\nI suspect that Conrad Schlosser probably arrived from closer rather than further away.\n\nMy gut feel is that generally the closer, simpler option is always more likely than further or more difficult. KISS for genealogy. Of course, during and after a time of horrific warfare, who is to say? Conrad wasn’t born yet when the 30 Years War reached the Palatinate in 1620. His parents were either young, or young parents themselves.\n\nBy the time the 30 Years War ended, in 1648, Conrad would have been about 14 and as soon as he became of age, the lure of reconstruction and perhaps the ability to settle on land in the Palatinate was probably quite alluring. He obviously did well for himself by 1684, about age 50, based on the fact that he was on the tax committee and one of the two wealthiest men in the village of Steinwenden. Nothing like being a big fish in a little pond. I wish we knew his occupation, the source of his wealth.\n\nThe Palatinate tended to be more protestant than Catholic, but the French were just the opposite. Steinwenden was very clearly Protestant, so I would guess that Conrad was too. I would think the Palatinate locations for the Schlosser family would be more likely than the Wurttemberg area.\n\nWithout additional hints being uncovered, we’ll likely never know…but then again, that’s exactly what I thought about 3 articles ago too.\n\nAnd since it seems that I’m destined for more rabbit holes, let me share one more hint that literally just this minute arrived from Chris:\n\nIn 1682 a daughter of Bernhard Schlosser from Steinwenden was married in the church of Steinwenden with the marriage entry recorded in the church book of Miesau. So here we go…\n\nThis tells us a couple things. First, there was a church or at least a minister in Steinwenden in 1682 and second, perhaps their earliest books had not been started or have since been lost.\n\nGiven this new information, we may have the answer to where Conrad’s children were baptized. Miesau is about 8 miles from Steinwenden and their church records begin in 1681. Baby steps backward in time.\n\nYou know what I’ll be doing for the rest of the day, don’t you?\n\nI was stunned to see a second Schlosser name on those tax lists. I suspect that Bernhardt’s widow was indeed Conrad’s mother, but without any church death records, there is no way to verify. However, this brand new information tells us that Bernhardt had children marrying in 1682, so he was too old to be Conrad’s son. We’re back to brother or father or maybe even uncle.\n\nChris, a Native German used to working with these records, agrees, but he said he’s not convinced enough to “put his hands in the fire over it.” What a quaint saying, and I agree, although clearly with more rabbits to seek, we’re not done yet.\n\nAre these people buried at the old the Old Cemetery Hill or by the old church tower in Steinwenden? Very probably.\n\nWhere did Conrad Schlosser baptize his children, all born between 1661 and 1681? For that matter, where was he married? Are there church records that are awaiting us in the future? I checked and the church records for Weilersbach don’t begin until 1721, so we’re out of luck there – unless there is a burial after 1721 for someone born in the 1600s that might be relevant. Sounds like another rabbit hole that needs to be investigated.\n\nI’m beginning to have a rabbit hole list.\n\nWhere were Johann Michael Mueller and his wife, Irene Charitas Schlosser living in 1684? They had a child baptized in the Steinwenden church on June 5, 1685. I’m presuming that child was born that day since, sadly, he died the following day. Using a reverse conception calculator, Irene Charitas became pregnant about September 12, 1684, assuming the child was full term.\n\nGiven that the Steinwenden church records didn’t say anything about illegitimacy, and they surely would have if that was the case, we’re going to presume the parents were married before conception, meaning there is probably a church record for that lurking someplace too.\n\nWe know that they would have married in that region, because the Schlosser family clearly had lived there for a quarter century by that time. The couple had to live in the same proximity to “court.” Therefore, there are only three options as to where Johann Michael Muller and Irene Charitas Schlosser were living in April of 1684 when the taxes were taken:\n\nThey weren’t married yet, and both Johann Michael Muller and Irene Charitas were living with their respective parents or other family members. In this case, Johann Michael Muller’s family has to be present. Who is the father of Johann Michael Muller? Was he perhaps Hans Jacob Muller or Johannes Muller of Weilersbach? We do find a Hans Nickel Mueller and a Johannes Mueller in Steinwenden baptizing children at this same time. Hmmmm….rabbit hole.\n\nThey weren’t married yet and Johann Michael Muller had not yet arrived. If this is the case, then the couple fell madly in love and had a whirlwind courtship given that Johann Michael Muller arrived sometime after April and before mid-September when Irene Charitas became pregnant.\n\nThey were already married and living with another family, probably Conrad Schlosser, given that this family was apparently more well-to-do than their neighbors. From the 1684 list, we know that Conrad lived in Steinwenden. Furthermore, Johann Michael Muller and Irene Charitas Schlosser baptized their newborn baby, Johann Nickel Muller, in June in the church in Steinwenden – surely the closest location given that the baby was gravely ill and not expected to live. He died the following day. To assure the child’s spiritual salvation, they would have baptized the baby immediately in the closest church, which suggests they were living in Steinwenden at that time.\n\nLastly, were Conrad Schlosser’s wife’s parents among the families in Steinwenden on that 1684 tax list? We don’t know, but if I had to guess, and I do have to guess, I would suspect that either Anna Ursula’s father was Johann Jacob Hauser or that her family was found among the Steinwenden families in 1684. Families tended to travel together in order to assist and support each other.\n\nYes, yes, I know, more rabbit holes.
