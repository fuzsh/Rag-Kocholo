TG Easterley at 218 1/2 N 4th for 1871, and Joseph Mellor is somewhere in St Louis County (outside the city) at the time of the 1870 Census, I have to presume the business was sold on about 1870. 1867 - 1869/70 Swett, A. G. & Co.(Genealogy notes from Donna Connell:\n\nAndrew Jackson Fox was married to Harriet Ann Swett, and he is listed on your website 1859-1910 as a photographer in St. Louis.\n\nHarriet Ann Swett's brother was Albert G. Swett (photographer 1872-at least 1900 in St. Louis.)\n\nAlbert G. Swett was married to Elizabeth H. Frank, and one of her brothers (either Theodore or Henry) was the other \"Frank\" in partnership with Albert G. Swett in 1885.\n\nHarriet and Albert's sister Julia Swett was married to John H. Hubbard... who was in photography partnership with bro-in-law Albert Swett in 1872. ???\n\n1406 (or 1416) Franklin 1849\n\n1886, 1887"
