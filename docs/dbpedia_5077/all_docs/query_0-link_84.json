Solima will head Zac Brown Band's radio promotion efforts, working in conjunction with the rpmentertainment promotion staff headed by Sr VP April Rider and VP of Promotion Jack Christopher.\n\nThe current single \"The Wind\" impacted at #1 Most Added with 74 adds on the Mediabase chart (June 11th). The single, written by Zac Brown, Wyatt Durrette, Levi Lowrey and ZBB, is the first track to be released from the two-time GRAMMY Award-winning band's highly anticipated July 10th release, 'Uncaged' (Southern Ground/Atlantic).\n\nThe move reunites Jeff Solima and Zac Brown Band with RPME's Christopher and National Director Rocco Cosco. Solima, Christopher and Cosco were part of the team that previously logged nine consecutive #1 Zac Brown Band singles while working at Bigger Picture Group.
