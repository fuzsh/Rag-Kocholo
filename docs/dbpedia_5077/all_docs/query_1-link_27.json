I know they were on Executive Nashville, but I think that was just for US promotion purposes.\n\nAs for Atlantic, they don't really have a country division. That's why artists like Hunter Hayes and Brett Eldredge are signed as Atlantic/Warner Music Nashville (any artist that leans country and is signed to Atlantic, Reprise, Elektra, etc will most likely wind up under the Warner Music Nashville label)....because Atlantic was bought out years ago by the Warner Music Group. The Zac Brown Band has their own label and only partnered with Atlantic for distribution purposes. Anyway, I don't think Jesse Lee is currently with any label.\n\nAnd in regards to the Universal purchase of EMI, yeah, that's bound to shake things up in Nashville sooner or later, once everything with the deal is finally complete. That's why Mike Dungan, former CEO of Capitol Nashville, moved to the same position at UMG Nashville earlier this year, in anticipation that the 2 companies would eventually be operated as one big label. I love following the charts and stuff, but I'm definitely no Nashville insider so I have no idea how it will all work out, but I imagine it would essentially be like this--the current Capitol label will move to under UMG (like Mercury and MCA are), except of course it won't be called 'Capitol' or 'EMI' anymore. I'm not sure if all the lesser-established artists currently signed to UMG and Capitol/EMI will keep their record deals either, once the 2 companies are joined together. And I'm sure there will definitely be some moving around.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nCan't tell you how many times I've wished I had a list like this at my disposal. Thanks so much.\n\nETA: So, Zac Brown Band records on their own label, has a distribution deal with Atlantic, and RPM does their radio promo. Is that correct?\n\nActually, for their first 2 albums, they got radio promo from Bigger Picture, and then switched to RPM during the chart run for \"The Wind\" (Bigger Picture dropped services for all artists not signed directly to their label). But actually, the ZBB has moved promotion in-house to Southern Ground (Zac's own label), which I figured they would do eventually. They have their own promo staff on the label now and they are working \"Goodbye In Her Eyes\" to radio. The partnership with RPM is over--it was very brief. And I think for their 4th album, they won't be distributed by Atlantic anymore, but will do everything on their own at Southern Ground.\n\nPost by mikem on\n\n^ Thanks. RPM has caught my attention with its handling of Maggie Rose, that's why I was curious. They've had full-page ads in Aircheck for her two weeks in a row. Every time the song starts to flatten out in its performance (it hasn't been a big gainer at any time), they seem to step in and give it a boost.\n\nSome time I'd love for someone with some knowledge of it to explain what labels, management, PR people actually do to promote a song once it has been on the charts for a while. Is it as simple as just contacting the radio people and trying to convince them to play it more?\n\nETA: I'm straying a bit off topic with this question, so if anyone wants to reply feel free to message me if you think it's inappropriate for this thread.\n\nPost by rsmatto on\n\nWhat a great listing! Thank you! It's an absolute travesty that true talents Lee Ann Womack and Kellie Pickler currently don't have record deals.\n\nLee Ann is nearly done with her record and seeing as she's got a husband with a boutique label (Carnival Records, where Eli Young Band started), I bet she releases her record through that label and sees how it does.\n\nOther Stuff:\n\nJesse Lee is unsigned (But managed by Average Joes now). The McClymonts are on their own label and released the 2nd CD in the USA through that. they're still signed to Australia's Universal label. Sarah Darling is still with Black River. This is their first REAL major market push with her and also first time they've outsourced the album's production.\n\nCapitol will remain a label name. It's EMI Nashville that will change names or cease to exist as a 'label.' More than likely - at least for a year or so - Capitol will operate the way it is now, just under UMG - not unlike Universal South/Show Dog-Universal or Republic as part of BMLG. Capitol Nashville was/is one of the biggest current assets that UMG bought and they likely want to have it operate independently.\n\nI actually can see where Capitol Nashville could rename EMI \"Interscope\" to create that 'shingle' and thus transferring Lauren and Scotty over there and shuttling artists around too. Now, this is pure 'conjecture' on my part but honestly, an Interscope label in Nashville makes all too much sense and why not use talent Dungan already likes to run those radio promo teams.\n\nThe whole merger will be really interesting but the likely only early casualties will be back-end stuff like publicists or redundant staffs that will be streamlined.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI am just amazed that Julianne Hough still has a label. She came in to country music then I blinked and she was gone never to be seen again.\n\nI could see her being let go eventually, when the UMG/EMI merger is complete. If you combine the 2 rosters as they are currently (Capitol, EMI, Mercury, and MCA) that's about 40 artists. Obviously it is going to remain the biggest label but I could see Julianne getting let go. Maybe she gets another single/album sometime, but I don't even think that's a guarantee. If it flops (which, at present, I am guessing it would), that would only increase her chances of being dropped. I think with Mike Dungan now running UMG, that some of those artists who were already there (and therefore, weren't signed by Dungan) and aren't 'producing' might wind up getting let go eventually.\n\nPost by onebuffalo on\n\nHm...looks like Valory may have parted ways with Jewel, and Republic may have parted ways with Sunny Sweeney.\n\nIf you go here, and hover the mouse over the \"Artists\" menu, there are no longer pictures of Jewel (under Valory) and Sunny (under Republic). If you actually click on the artists tab, it still has them on there, though, which is odd. All I know is that this is different than it was just a few days ago...simply 'hovering' over the artists menu brought up pictures of all the artists, including Jewel and Sunny, but now it's not so.\n\nThat's too bad. The only thing that both women had in common is that they have scored only one major hit each. Jewel was first with Stronger Woman (#13 in 2008) while Sunny Sweeney scored last year with From A Table Away (#10). Oh well, if your name is not Taylor Swift, Reba McEntire, or Martina McBride I guess being a female artist on the Big Machine family of labels sucks for you!\n\nPost by rsmatto on\n\nHm...looks like Valory may have parted ways with Jewel, and Republic may have parted ways with Sunny Sweeney.\n\nIf you go here, and hover the mouse over the \"Artists\" menu, there are no longer pictures of Jewel (under Valory) and Sunny (under Republic). If you actually click on the artists tab, it still has them on there, though, which is odd. All I know is that this is different than it was just a few days ago...simply 'hovering' over the artists menu brought up pictures of all the artists, including Jewel and Sunny, but now it's not so.\n\nThat's too bad.

As for Jewel, I think they'll just work with her if she decides to do another country record as that was always their arrangement. The label does have the \"Nashville\" soundtrack stuff now (BMLG does)."
