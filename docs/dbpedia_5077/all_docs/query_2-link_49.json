        "text": "With the current and ongoing digital revolution creating a general optimistic scenario for the music industry to bloom in, global access to music gets spread continuously and at a faster pace than ever before. New worldwide digital platforms and the power of streaming are setting an unrivalled ground to explore new music genres, grow audiences, enjoy music on the go and even build closer engagement with online communities.\n\nYet, while the music industry has been greatly impacted and disrupted by this digital wave, in many cases it still remains a sector that has not yet fully embraced a data-centric approach, missing out on a great opportunity to boost its revenues even further, and optimise every aspect of its music production pipeline-chain. As a result, composers, artists, songwriters, publishers, record labels and all types of rights holders may not exploiting the maximum benefits, ownership and control of their IP.\n\nWait… How come rights’ management is paramount?\n\nAll industry players, but especially all artists and independent labels, should be aware of the importance and the industry insights that come along with the management of music rights and the process behind the redistribution of music royalties. From full administrative tasks and creative needs, to A&R, data management and digital marketing, there is a very vast pool of boxes to be ticked, and often many hazy technical gaps to be noted, until the rights of a song are accurately managed.\n\nHow do we know who the rightful owner of a music track or album is? Who has the control over which specific type of rights (Publishing or Master in example) ? Who should receive royalties for a sound recording, and are these royalties collected correctly around the world? How is all information collected, and the metadata managed?\n\nIf the metadata is not meticulous and correct, the usage of the tracks will be ineffective, since there won’t be any visibility over where it’s coming from. If the rights and the linked metadata isn’t properly synchronised crosswise every database of the industry, then again, the right people will not be identified – and consequently not get paid. All the above mentioned factors can have a direct outcome on how artists and other rights holders are losing opportunities to get recognised, and grow their audience, reach and income.\n\nBetter understanding and new technologies are making recent times look brighter and are improving drastically how everything gets managed within the music world. Transparency in big data and metadata collection, innovative rights and royalty management technology and blockchain projects, are shedding a lot of light in all the players of the music industry’s value chain. Processes are getting automated, digital marketing is getting fully optimised, and copyrights are getting more and more registered. And all this, while royalty splits and payout distributions are managed in a more trusted and transparent way.\n\nHand-in-hand to the top\n\nWhile artists, producers and musicians are fully devoted and captured in the creative process of making new music, the correct management of their music rights can easily be outsourced and optimised. With all the innovations the evolution of the internet brought in recent years and throughout the big progression linked to music right management, a whole set of new companies arose, ready to help the music industry reach its maximum potential.\n\nThere are many companies out there ready to assist, with each of them having their very own best practices and unique selling points. One thing all of them have in common, is that they all aim for a more precise and transparent management of music rights, and for the income optimisation of the generated music royalties.\n\nWe’ve selected a few of these industry players who are focussed on right management and listed them here below:"
