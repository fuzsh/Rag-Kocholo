While Live Nation shares rose 0.5% to $84.79, the other promoters and ticketing companies in the index had down weeks: Madison Square Garden Entertainment fell 2.7%, CTS Eventim dropped 5.7% and Sphere Entertainment Co. plunged 9.6%. Sphere Entertainment shares have gained over 19% since the company turned on the external display on its state-of-the-art Las Vegas venue and showcased the potential inside the structure on July 5. The company‚Äôs second quarter results, released Tuesday, showed revenue of $129.1 million ‚Äî with the Sphere contributing just $700,000 and the remainder coming from MSG Networks. Sphere‚Äôs share price rose nearly 8% to $39.58 following Tuesday‚Äôs earnings results but fell nearly 15% over the next three days. The $2.3-billion Sphere will open on Sept. 29 with a 25-date residency by U2. Related What Inflation? Music Execs Remain Bullish on Consumer Demand for Concerts, Subscriptions 08/25/2023 iHeartMedia shares rose 6.6% for the week to close at $3.56 on Friday (Aug. 25), making the radio giant the week‚Äôs greatest gainer on the Billboard Global Music Index. However, radio companies‚Äô struggle with weak national advertising has hurt their share prices overall in 2023. Year to date through Friday, iHeartMedia was down 41.9% and Cumulus Media had lost 41.9%. Audacy, troubled by debt on top of the soft advertising market, was de-listed by the New York Stock Exchange on May 16 and currently trades over the counter at 75 cents per share despite a reverse stock split on June 30 raising the price from 7 cents to $2.13. Audacy was removed from the Billboard Global Music Index following the de-listing. Overall, the 21-stock Billboard Global Music Index was flat this week at 1,298.80. Ten stocks finished the week in positive territory, ten stocks lost ground and one stock, Round Hill Music Royalty Fund, was unchanged. Record labels and music publishers were the top performing sector with an average gain of 1.7% and only one company, Universal Music Group (down 0.7%), finished in negative territory. Streaming companies and radio companies suffered average weekly losses of 1.3% and 1.7%, respectively. Year-to-date, the index has increased 11.2%, even as it‚Äôs now on its fifth straight week without a gain. Stocks in general performed better than music stocks. In the United States, the S&amp\n\n\"The audio in this reel is no longer available\" Have you heard the news? Tiktok removed ALL music licensed to Universal Music Group which includes names like Taylor Swift, Drake and others. Why? Their license contract was up and UMG argued the artists were not getting properly compensated by TikTok for the use of their music. So what does that mean for creators? The plus side is that some of these audio tracks and artists are still available to select on Instagram. With that being said, regardless of the platform - after putting work in (sometimes hours of setup, filming and editing) to create the perfect video synced to the perfect audio, it's unlikely creators would want to risk the potential for a muted video down the line. Instead creators will do their best to increase longevity of their content, not just capitalize on trends that can possibly undo their work down the line. From a business perspective, when it comes to brokering influencer content, i'd be extremely specific in any brief to create expectations or regulations surrounding audio selected by content creators. When brands are investing in influencers they don't leave it to chance whether the content can be used or not. So what to expect in the future? There are some industry experts who believe that this news from TikTok may result in an uptick of reels on platforms like Instagram and Facebook to capitalize on the audios available there. There could be potential for the platforms to negotiate exclusive licenses and therefore encourage users to prefer a platform based on the music available. As a community girl, I'd love to see the profits go directly to the artists regardless of which big corporation music heads are in charge. We saw it with Taylor Swift rerecording her entire music library to gain control of the rights again. We've seen it recently with a trending audio by Cat Janice \"Dance you outta my head\" Who happens to be a mom dying of cancer that assigned the royalties to her 7year old son. Dare I say I'm not far off in assuming the people are begging for opportunities to take back their musical powers? I'm no expert on the music industry but what this looks like to me is an opportunity for a shift that would be welcomed by the masses. What I'd like to see? 1. Social platforms adding \"edit track\" function to reels after they've been posted. Wouldn't it be great if you could change the audio months after it's been posted and recently muted? 2. More transparency in the music industry and royalty free music platforms getting better visibility for new and emerging artists. HBU? Leave a comment down below your thoughts on this news and if youve experienced getting muted video on your TikTok or if reel.\n\nThis seems to go against Sir Lucian‚Äôs mantra of passing on catalogue transactions which don‚Äôt give UMG control. But for all the music finance nerds out there (üëã) it actually looks like a strategically sensible transaction done at a reasonable price. üéπ Most importantly, UMG will buy a 26% stake in a vehicle which can deploy leverage to acquire catalogues in future. And taking over administration of a pretty large rights portfolio from Kobalt will also give Universal Music Publishing an ongoing revenue stream on the side. So when a large catalogue comes up from sale (e.g. the $1bn+ Queen recorded music, publishing and neighbouring rights catalogues), UMG has a choice: üé∏ Use its own equity. In this case it may pay $15 for each dollar of NPS (assuming a typical 15x multiple), make a big dent in its FCF (which equity investors hate) and likely barely cover its cost of capital. üé∏ Instead, it could invest via Chord. In this case, Chord invests the $15, but if the equity cheque is 50% of that, UMG would only need to pony up $1.95 (26% x 50% x $15) for economic exposure to $0.26 of NPS (26% x $1 of NPS) at an implied 7.5x multiple; plus it would have the ongoing administration fee on the copyrights, which should exceed its share of the funding costs of any debt in the acquisition vehicle. UMG would have no control over how rights are exploited, but it will still have exposure to rising asset values and the returns on its capital should definitely be higher. üéπ The one issue here is whether UMG paid a fair price for its stake in Chord. When you dig into it, it probably did. üé∏ The entity UMG acquired is essentially Kobalt Capital‚Äôs Fund II, which was sold to KKR and Dundee Partners in October 2021 for ‚Äúapproximately $1.1bn‚Äù (https://lnkd.in/epmZdeYG). When the original transaction closed, KKR/Dundee disclosed they were acquiring ‚Äúover 60,000 copyrights‚Äù, which hasn‚Äôt changed. üé∏ So it looks like UMG paid a nearly 70% higher valuation for assets where ‚Äî judging by reported results from the music majors ‚Äî the royalty stream has probably gone up by about the same amount. You could argue multiples should come down because interest rates are higher, but that aside UMG probably paid a fair price. #universalmusicgroup #musicstreaming\n\nIsn't the Superbowl more than just a game? üèà As I watched it with friends, memories of past halftime shows, commercials, and the game itself flooded my mind. It struck me how the Superbowl's advertising space is unparalleled. With millions of viewers, it's a chance for brands to connect with potentially millions of new fans or followers. It's validation for consumers too ‚Äì confirming that the brands they've chosen are the right ones. üåü Isn't that the sweet spot every brand aims for? Where the audience not only connects with the brand but sees themselves in the story? After all, who doesn't like confirmation that they're making the right choices? üí° Let's hear from the stars themselves ‚Äì Usher, Rihanna, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and others who've graced the Superbowl stage. What's the experience like for them, both on and off-camera? Was it worth it, or more than worth it? And what's next on the horizon? üöÄ #BusinessInsights #Entertainment #TV #Music\"\n\nWell ain't that some s**t!! The biggest record label in the world will be pulling music off TikTok. üòµ I'm shocked at this news, mainly because it has come so soon and at a time when sonic branding is on the rise. üìà Now, there is a lot to unpack with this big news, but the main thing to note before reading further is that TikTok and Universal simply could not agree on a fair rate for payment of their artists. ü§∑üèæ‚ôÇÔ∏è Universal holds license to some of the biggest names out there. Taylor Swift (seen below), Drake, The Weeknd, The Beatles and even the re-ignited Sophie Ellis-Bextor! Artists (and music companies) get paid royalties from the songs that are used, and despite TikTok having over 1 BILLION users, they contribute to less than 1% of UMG's revenue. Something is off... TikTok ain't playing fair... or should I say... paying fair. üí∞ üö´ Universal stated in an open letter - \"ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music\". TikTok responded with - \"It is sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters....\" I mean, it's a negotiation... and clearly they were not aligned. And if Universal gets paid, the artists get paid. It's business. But..what does this mean for brands and businesses wanting to use music to promote? Well, obviously there will be less music from the charts to use... however... this is a wake up call. üîî There is power in ownership. Brands that create original and bespoke sound will not only be able to shape their own sonic identity, they will own the sonic assets and not have the risk of losing anything. Audiences will also be able to connect with something that is truly original. Say for example, your audience connected with you because you used Drake on your videos, and now you are unable to, next to a competitor brand that seemingly produces original sounds... The consistency of the competitor brand will play out through loyalty and psychological trust that brands rely on when marketing on social. I won't go into the science, but brands and businesses need to wake up. Brand identity is fragile. The more control you have, the safer the brand identity. Sonic brand identity is BIG part of that. Those who understand this will move ahead. Those who ignore it... well.. you get it... #TikTok #musicnews #musicproduction #advertising #marketingandadvertising #socialmedia #socialemediamarketing\n\nThis weeks editorial commentary from the 137th edition of the AmplifyYou newsletter which 37k artists and music industry pro's get directly to their inbox every Tuesday. If you want the sign-up link let me know and I'll send it over. üé∂ James Blake Launch's Vault as an Answer to Streaming Payouts üé§ Earlier last month, British singer-songwriter James Blake went viral with his comments about streaming platforms and their low payout-per-stream. He promptly leveraged this virality to announce that he's participating in the launch of Vault, an artist-to-fan streaming platform. ü§© This year, the buzzword is \"superfan,\" thanks to some eye-opening insights from Goldman Sachs. Everyone in the game, from the big labels to the tech players are scrambling to figure out how to engage these die-hard followers more effectively. üí∏ Subscription platforms can be a great way for artists to leverage their fandom and make money on a regular basis. However, there are a few things that artists and their teams need to be aware of to ensure that maintaining a subscription model is sustainable and doesn't leave the artist more burnt out. ‚¨Ö First off, unless you're Taylor Swift with millions of devoted superfans, asking your fanbase to migrate to a whole new platform to listen to your songs and subscribe to your exclusive content will be a tough task with low conversion rates. Not only is this a big ask, but as MiDiA argues, the industry, or more specifically DSP‚Äôs, has \"brainwashed\" people to prioritise songs over individual artists. üì∏ The idea of \"exclusive content\" is getting trickier too. With artists already sharing a ton of their lives for free on social, crafting something truly special for subscribers requires extra creativity and effort. üìà Yet, there's a glimmer of hope. Data shows fans are down for subscriptions if they get real value like early access to tracks, tickets, and merch. It's about offering something they can't just scroll past. üîó Over here at Amplify, we're in the trenches with you, building tools to help artists forge stronger connections with their real supporters. But let's not kid ourselves, there's no magic bullet to fix the industry overnight. üß© Superfandom and subscriptions are two pieces of a much larger puzzle. But instead of forcing the artist to shoulder even more responsibility, the music industry as a whole must make a crucial decision to create a new music economy that's more artist-centric. What do you think about James Blake's new Vault platform? #Musicmarketing #MusicIndustry #Streaming #ArtistFirst\n\nUniversal Music Group has announced that it won't be renewing its licensing agreement with TikTok. Once this agreement expires, which will happen on January 31, this music behemoth will no longer license its content to TikTok. This includes both Universal Music Group (UMG) and Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) so it's no small blow. UMG and UMPG are among the largest music companies globally. For recordings, UMG is the largest major with a 31.8% market share (source: https://lnkd.in/gxeuaeJz). For publishing, UMPG has a 23.4% market share and UMPG has maintained more than a 30% market share on the U.S. Hot 100 chart for three consecutive quarters (source: https://lnkd.in/gxeuaeJz). UMG has been negotiating with TikTok about three main concerns: fair compensation for artists and songwriters, the impact of AI on human artists, and online safety on TikTok's platform. UMG claims that TikTok's current offer undervalues their music and doesn't provide enough revenue, considering TikTok's large user base and advertising income. Moreover, UMG is worried about the rise of AI-generated music on TikTok, fearing it might decrease the earnings for human artists. They are also concerned about the large amount of content on TikTok that uses their music without permission and the presence of harmful content on the platform. Neither the stance on the impact of AI on human artists nor the request for fair compensation for artists and songwriter are surprising. UMG's demands of TikTok falls right in line with the current bargaining between the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). \"The union is advocating for protections against the impacts of artificial intelligence on their profession, and this aspect of the negotiations reflects and underscores a broader industry trend, where technological advancements are reshaping traditional roles and revenue models (source: https://lnkd.in/gvYaeDrY)\". TikTok responded by saying UMG is prioritizing its own profit over the interests of artists and songwriters. TikTok argues that it has reached fair agreements with other labels and publishers and that UMG's decision is not in the best interest of the music community. The company suggests that UMG is ignoring the promotional benefits TikTok offers to artists and songwriters. Todd Spangler discusses UMG's commitment to protecting its artists, songwriters, and their music. They are determined not to give in to what they consider unfair tactics by TikTok, showing their resolve to stand up for the value of music and the rights of creators. #MusicLicensing #MusicIndustryNews #AIInMusic #MusicPublishing"
