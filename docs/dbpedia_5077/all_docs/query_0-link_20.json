        "text": "Foster The People have signed to Atlantic Records ahead of the release of their first new album in seven years, “Paradise State of Mind,” slated for Aug. 16. The first single, “Lost In Space,” debuted on Friday with the signing and album announce.\n\nFoster The People — comprised of Mark Foster and Isom Innis — released all four of their previous projects under former label, Columbia Records. Their last album, “Sacred Hearts Club,” arrived in 2017.\n\n“The record started as a case study of the late Seventies crossover between disco, funk, gospel, jazz, and all those sounds,” said Foster. “It was such a beautiful moment in time, when these different styles of music were cross-referencing each other – artists like Nile Rogers and Chic, the Tom Tom Club and Giorgio Moroder.”\n\n+ Artist Legacy Group (ALG) has been named the global representative for the estate of Earl Simmons, professionally known as rapper, actor and entertainer, DMX. DMX’s fiancée, Desiree Lindstrom, and daughter Sasha Simmons were involved in the partnership.\n\n“A force of nature. That is how I would describe DMX,” Ashley Austin, CEO of ALG, commented: “Rapper, poet, actor, preacher — the man’s talent was truly limitless. I am honored to work alongside Desiree and Sasha as we maximize the estate’s potential. Together, we will ensure that his message and music lives on.”\n\n“Earl was devoted to his fans. He was grateful that they stayed by his side and walked with him through his ups and downs,” said Lindstrom. “Sasha and I are confident that ALG is the right team to partner with to honor Earl’s music and legacy. For my son and all of Earl’s children and fans, we will keep Earl’s spirit alive.”\n\n“My father, Earl, was more than an icon; he was my inspiration and guiding light,” shared Simmons. “His music touched countless lives, and his legacy will forever resonate in our hearts. With ALG by our side, Desiree and I are committed to preserving his spirit, ensuring that his art continues to inspire generations to come.”\n\nWednesday, May 29\n\nWarner Music Canada has inked a deal with producer Eli Brown and his Loophole Records label. Brown is a multi-platinum producer from Ontario with credits on music for globally-recognized artists including Drake, Giveon, PartyNextDoor and Chris Brown.\n\nAmisha Sarkar, Warner Music A&R, said, “Canada is special. From the artists to the writers to the producers. Eli Brown is the epitome of Toronto culture and plays a key role in the city’s creative community. We are excited to support him in his parallel journey of highlighting and developing Canadian talent on a global scale.”\n\nKristen Burke, president for Warner Music Canada, added: “Eli is an incredible creative force who not only has a deep connection to his culture, but is also a constant driver of it. His ability to find and develop talented young artists and bring them to the world stage aligns perfectly with our mission at Warner Music Canada.\n\n“I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Kristen and Amisha and the opportunity they have given me to contribute to the development of the next generation of stars,” said Eli Brown. “Our shared aspirations extend beyond reshaping Canadian music history to revolutionizing the entire music industry as a whole. I am excited to leverage the extensive knowledge I have gained over the years in the music industry, encapsulated in what I refer to as the ‘Eli Brown Bible.’ This comprehensive resource is a distillation of my diverse experiences and the invaluable insights shared by legendary creatives and executives who have generously supported me. Thank you for entrusting me with this opportunity to make a meaningful impact.”\n\n+ Mom+Pop Music has signed singer-songwriter pablopablo (real name Pablo Drexler).\n\nThe London-Madrid-based artist is already a Latin Grammy Award-winning artist following his studies at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London.

In addition to recording his upcoming debut album, Pablo has a series of international tour dates, including supporting the Marías.\n\n+ Prescription Songs has signed Venezuelan singer-songwriter, Aloisio. The Miami-based artist was signed into the company by Prescription Songs A&Rs Siara Behar and Shari Fitch. Aloisio was brought on by fellow Perscription Songs signee, DallasK.\n\nDallasK said, “The first time I heard Aloisio’s music I knew he was someone that can forge his own path in Latin music, regardless of what’s popular in the moment, and bring the whole world along for the ride… I’m so excited to work with him and Prescription Songs in our new joint publishing venture. They’ve played such a large part in my career and I’m excited to work with them to help make Aloisio a household name.”\n\n+ Anthony Martini and Rich Barner have partnered for the launch of Gravel Road, a new Nashville-based record label and management firm. The venture touts clients including Compton Cowboys, Randy Savvy, Justbrandon, and producer Scattered Brains.\n\nMartini’s first significant management client was Tyga, and under Martini’s prior label, Commission Records, Lil Dicky’s album “Professional Rapper” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard rap album chart.

The launch of our London office in 2023 has been pivotal; it positions us to collaborate directly with international artists and songwriters, and to connect with a diverse global audience. International expansion is intrinsic to our ethos, and I am profoundly confident that our partnership with UMP China – with their expansive network and proven success – will propel our journey of internationalization even further.”"
