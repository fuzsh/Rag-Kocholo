        "text": "It’s shakeup season for major labels. Universal Music Group has reorganised its labels in the US and UK this year, and now Warner Music has confirmed some big changes for its global recorded-music business.\n\nThat division’s CEO Max Lousada will step down at the end of September, while Atlantic Records boss Julie Greenwald “has begun a leadership transition” that will see her become chair of Atlantic Music Group. The new CEO of that group is Elliot Grainge, son of UMG boss Sir Lucian, whose independent label 10K projects launched a joint-venture with WMG last year.\n\nIn the US, WMG will now have two label groups: Atlantic Music Group and Warner Records, with the latter including Warner Music Nashville, Nonesuch and Reprise. WMG also said its reorganisation will create a “flatter structure” for its recorded business, with no overall CEO, and regional and divisional leaders reporting directly to the company’s overall boss Robert Kyncl.\n\n“We have an amazing bench of creative leaders, and I’m looking forward to working more closely with them, as we collaborate on the company’s next phase of creative excellence, commercial transformation, and growing revenues,” said Kyncl."
