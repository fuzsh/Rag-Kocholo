        "text": "The contrast between almost any Chess record from the mid nineteen-fifties and almost any Atlantic record from the same period is striking. Beside the Chess record, the Atlantic record will sound eclectic, urban, and “overarranged.” It will sound self-conscious. This may sound like a judgment against Atlantic Records, but it is not. In recent times, there have been two distinct trends within black popular music. One is solid, obviously derived from blues or gospel, somewhat rural, and somewhat naïve. This trend never entirely disappears, and at times (when other popular music has moved too far in the direction of artifice) it reasserts its strength in the marketplace, but it has not been so potent as the second trend, which is toward music that is more nervous, more eclectic, more urban, and more “arranged.” In the nineteen-sixties, this more powerful second trend came under the control of Motown Records, whose music (very nervous, very eclectic, very urban, very “arranged”) is without doubt the classic black music of the nineteen-sixties. In the nineteen-fifties, this trend was for a few important years in the hands of Atlantic Records.\n\nThere are no artifacts in the possession of Atlantic Records to justify an auction. There is, however, one very modest little register, dating from 1947, in which the details of the company’s first recording sessions have been entered. This register shows what would not be evident from an examination of Atlantic records available in stores or in memory—that for the first several years of its operation Atlantic recorded music that explored all the corners of Ahmet’s enthusiasms and the enthusiasms of his then partner, Herb Abramson. In 1947, Atlantic recorded sixty-five sides. Among them were twelve gospel songs by the Gospeleers; seven sides by Tiny Grimes; and versions, by different artists, of “Button Up Your Overcoat,” “Memories of You,” “How High the Moon,” and “The Lady Is a Tramp.” Fewer than half of these sixty-five were released, and of those released none were hits. In 1948, Atlantic recorded sixty-seven sides, and there were no hits in this group, either. Atlantic recorded a hundred and eighty-seven sides in 1949. Among them were a number of sides by Frank Cully, including “Cole Slaw,” a minor instrumental hit; ten sides by the jazz pianist Erroll Garner; fifteen sides by the blues singer Blind Willie (only two sides were released); ten sides by Professor Longhair, the one-man band Ahmet and Abramson had found in New Orleans (he had come free of his contract with Mercury); and six sides issued as “Square Dance Party Parts I-VI.” There was, however, a record issued in 1949 that was important in the history of Atlantic. This was “Drinkin’ Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee,” produced by Ahmet and Herb Abramson in February of that year. There are two things to note about this song. First, it was the most successful record that Atlantic had had up to that time, reaching No. 3 on Billboard’s rhythm and blues chart. Second, it had humor—a certain jaunty, self-aware humor.\n\nIn 1950 and 1951, Atlantic had an increased activity among established artists. Few of these artists had any special allegiance to Atlantic, however, and most had musical styles that had been established elsewhere and did not admit of modification. During 1950 and 1951, Atlantic recorded Mary Lou Williams, the Billy Taylor Quartet, Leadbelly, Al Hibbler, Lil Green, Sidney Bechet, Meade Lux Lewis, and Mabel Mercer. In July, 1951, Ahmet went to Chicago and recorded the boogie-woogie pianist Jimmy Yancey. This work did not immediately result in any significant commercial success, but it was satisfying to the aspect of Ahmet’s ambition which had to do with appreciation. Ahmet’s appreciation of music and musicians has been intimately linked with his interest in certain American styles and social milieus, but it is tied as well to a good ear and a respect for integrity. It is a fact that Ahmet has rarely been able to resist a vogue or a temptation, but neither has he been able to resist an important talent or an eccentric talent—or any talent that knew what it was doing. The appreciative mode (the mode with a passive sense of history) has always been allowed some importance at Atlantic, and it manifests itself today in a creditable roster of jazz artists, but it has not been given as much attention as another mode, which began to show itself during the early fifties—at about the same time Ahmet was recording Mabel Mercer, Meade Lux Lewis, and Jimmy Yancey. This was the mode of the producer—a mode eclectic by definition, a mode devoted to the active use of history for what might be serviceable in the present.\n\n1951: Two songs by a group called the Clovers appear on a page of the little register which is otherwise dominated by Mary Lou Williams and the Billy Taylor Quartet. One of the songs is “Skylark,” a significant jazz song that is not significant in the history of Atlantic Records. The other is a song called “Don’t You Know I Love You,” written by Ahmet Ertegun under his pen name of Nugetre. “Don’t You Know I Love You” is a very elementary song. In some ways, it is a painful song. It has something to do with the blues, but it has none of the naïve strength of the blues. It has something to do with a little jump band from the forties, but it is less polite and more awkward. One cannot help noticing, however, that the song has some strength of its own, not immediately traceable to the forms from which it derives. Its principal strength may, in fact, lie in its novel combination of awkwardness with lack of naïveté. Typically, after all, awkward productions are naïve and knowing productions are slick. It may be that in divorcing a certain worldliness from any sophistication that could be perceived as a link with the established order of things this song and others like it awakened a new, if slightly perverse, response in an audience that had tired of oversophisticated pieces, on the one hand, and pieces that were too obviously naïve, on the other. “Don’t You Know I Love You” was a hit.\n\nAlso in this year, Ahmet produced “Chains of Love,” a song of his own composition, with Joe Turner. Joe Turner differed from the Clovers in that he was a man of proved talent, established reputation, and mature age. In the case of the Clovers, Ahmet had taken five obscure young men (who had come to his notice through his friend Waxie Maxie Silverman) and coached them in a style that made use of one or two musical modes in which he had an interest. In the case of Joe Turner, Ahmet (with Herb Abramson) took an established blues artist whose career had almost come to an end and, by making the established blues mode of his work more obvious, more vivid, more urban, and less naïve, created for him a new and more successful career in a new and unexpectedly larger marketplace. “Chains of Love” is a blues song but not exactly a blues song. It is diminished in its essence but expanded on its surface. “Chains of Love” was a hit.\n\n1953: In this year, Ahmet and Abramson produced “Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean,” by Ruth Brown (“Miss Rhythm”). This song can supply some meaning to the phrase “rhythm and blues.” The phrase “rhythm and blues” was invented by Ahmet’s partner Jerry Wexler, in 1949 (when he was working at Billboard), to replace the word “race” as the formula descriptive of the black music then current. It was contrived to encompass two coexisting postwar trends in black music (the jump song and the blues song), but by 1953 it was being used to describe all black popular music taken together, and it was beginning to imply a movement. “Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean” is a classic rhythm-and-blues song. It has an unnaïve blues lyric supported by a distinctive, jaunty, nervous jump beat, but one is less aware than before of the separate identities of the elements of the song. The eclectic, nervous Atlantic style, responding, perhaps, to a certain urban mood, had begun to cohere by 1953. The coherence of such a style is not a small occasion. It comes as the result of a complicated musical and social treaty, requiring an essential integrity (to supply the basic energy), a talent for modification, and an intuitive sense of the moment. These things Ahmet Ertegun and others at Atlantic Records—notably his partner Herb Abramson and, later, his partner Jerry Wexler, the arranger and composer Jesse Stone, and their distinguished engineer, Tom Dowd—had in abundance in the middle nineteen-fifties.\n\n1954: There were a number of significant Atlantic records in this year, including “Shake, Rattle, and Roll,” by Joe Turner, which, in the cover version by Bill Haley & The Comets, had an enormous impact on the popular market and contributed to the vogue for the words “rock” and “roll” in reference to popular music with a blues feel and a heavy beat. But it is my opinion that the most satisfying song released by Atlantic in this year was “Money Honey,” by Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters. This is a great song. Male Negro falsetto voices have been particularly appropriate to the jittery urban songs of the recent era, and Clyde McPhatter had one of the most compelling of these voices. In “Money Honey,” the jump beat has come very far up front, but the knowing, tough, post-blues lyric has such authority that it will not be overwhelmed. The effect is one of aggression, power, cynicism. “Money Honey” was written and arranged by Jesse Stone, an eccentric composer of real talent, who was in middle age when he wrote it.\n\n1956: “Since I Met You Baby,” sung by Ivory Joe Hunter, was a hit in this year. It is cast as a blues song, but it has been debased as a blues song by an eagerness to please. The arrangement expands the surface of the song as it contracts its meaning and saps its strength. Ivory Joe Hunter’s falsetto has a whining quality and lacks the authority implicit in the voice of Clyde McPhatter.\n\n1958: By 1958, Atlantic’s arrangements were no longer at the cutting edge of popular music. Atlantic’s peculiar contribution—the eclectic amalgam of unnaïve blues motifs with a nervous but aggressive jump beat—had been subsumed into the general trend of what was by then called rock and roll. By 1958, the most interesting songs to come from Atlantic, from the point of view of production and arrangement, came from Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who wrote and produced the music of the Coasters, under an independent production agreement. Leiber and Stoller had a sure touch with rock and roll. Their two-sided hit “Searchin’ ” and “Young Blood,” produced for the Coasters on Atco, an Atlantic subsidiary, was the significant Atlantic hit record of 1957. Ahmet and Jerry Wexler were less at home than Leiber and Stoller with material that was directed from its inception to an adolescent market. In February of 1958, Ahmet and Wexler produced a song for Chuck Willis called “Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes,” which displayed an unpleasant self-consciousness. An unpleasant self-consciousness was by no means unexampled at the time. Rhythm-and-blues singers, having experienced an unexpected success in the white marketplace, had begun to address that marketplace directly, and by 1958 tough, experienced Negro voices were often singing songs that dealt with white adolescent concerns. In May of 1958, Ahmet produced a rock-and-roll song for Bobby Darin, who had been unsuccessfully recorded by Herb Abramson (who by 1958 was on the verge of leaving the company). The song was called “Splish Splash,” and was a hit, although an embarrassing one.\n\n1959: On June 8, 1959, Atlantic released “What’d I Say?” by Ray Charles. From the release of this record, it is possible to date the end of the period of experimentation in rhythm and blues which began for Atlantic ten years before with the release of “Drinkin’ Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee.” By 1959, Ray Charles was producing his own records, and they were as significant and powerful and pleasing as any records being made. His career in the national marketplace had had its start in 1955 with “I Got a Woman,” and reached its climax with “What’d I Say?,” which seemed to combine all the energy of the most shameless rock and roll with the real energy of the blues in a manner that was knowing without being cynical and was eclectic without being weak or perverse. Only Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye have made popular music as full as this. At the end of 1959, Ray Charles left Atlantic without giving Ahmet and Wexler a chance to meet the terms of a generous offer made to him by ABC Paramount Records.One day, I listened with Ahmet to some Atlantic records from the nineteen-fifties. “I don’t think they hold up that well,” he said. “The singing holds up pretty well, but the background sounds dated to me. . . . The inventions—the inventions of arrangers—give it leaden feet, you know what I mean? It’s like an automobile. A simple body design of 1938 on a Delage or some of those simple French cars looks as beautiful today as— But the 1948 Buick Roadmaster, with a lot of chrome, looks funny. It’s of its time but not something that one would copy in any way. There’s too much chrome on all of those records, you know what I mean? And when I listen to these old records, the things that make them of their time also make them ugly.”\n\nAhmet played a song he had written under the name Nugetre, and I asked him why he had used a pseudonym.\n\n“I didn’t want to embarrass anyone, you know—especially if I went into government service,” he said. “There has always been that other possibility, you know? In the background, some kind of involvement with Turkey.” Ahmet paused. “They call me, you know? The government of Turkey. And I am able to have some effect at times.” Ahmet paused again. “But now there is less and less chance that I will be anything else than what I am.”\n\nBy the time I met Ahmet, in 1971, he was seen at his most powerful not in any recording studio but at parties. Parties at his house on East Eighty-first Street (parties of thirty or thirty-five, assembled in the large spare space on the second floor, seated in the dining room on the first floor, spread out over the house after the meal); parties at home in Southampton; parties in London and in New Orleans. Parties to push a record. Parties with as much authority as could be assembled without having reference to anything that could be perceived as inhibiting.On the night of Wednesday, July 26, 1972, Ahmet and his wife, Mica, went to see the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden, and I went along. They arrived late. By the time they arrived, their seats had been taken by very young people. Ahmet and Mica made no attempt to evict the squatters. Ahmet spread a white handkerchief on the concrete step adjacent to their seats, and Mica sat on this. Ahmet stood next to her, protectively. Mica looked very handsome. She wore a black dress. Her hair was short. She wore an ivory bracelet trimmed with gold. (The ivory came from Mombasa; the gold was put on in Turkey.) I felt a sharp pleasure at being next to them. There have been a number of times when I have felt a difficult but compelling affection for Ahmet and Mica. At odd moments. Usually in public—at times when one does not expect to be feeling anything at all.\n\nA boy who looked about thirteen passed around a joint. Ahmet nodded politely and passed it along. Mica kept her eyes on the stage. Onstage, Mick Jagger, wearing a white suit trimmed with a red sash, began to sing “Street Fighting Man.” To his left stood a black man. The black man held a silver bowl full of rose petals. At moments when emphasis was wanted, Mick Jagger grabbed a handful of rose petals from the silver bowl and threw them over the edge of the stage. Later, when he sang “Satisfaction,” he had bowls of water kept at his disposal, and at moments when emphasis was wanted he threw water over the edge of the stage. Photographers looking for interesting effects took advantage of these moments of emphasis. Mick Jagger sang “Love in Vain.” He knelt on the stage, his hands behind his head. His attitude implied flagellation. Then his birthday was celebrated. Mick Jagger threw pies and confetti. A large beach ball was thrown. Stevie Wonder, who had opened the show for the Rolling Stones (and who was at the time almost certainly the most significant popular musician in America), sang “Happy Birthday to You” to Mick Jagger. Mick Jagger threw more water over the edge of the stage. Stevie Wonder sang a powerful medley of “Uptight,” which is his song, and “Satisfaction,” which is Jagger’s. Then, remarkably, he smeared pie on his own face.\n\nIt may be that Ahmet and Mica have an impressive ease in large, unwelcoming crowds because the sensibility of the émigré continues to adhere to them. It may be that they have come upon an enormous professional and social success because the sensibility of the émigré (distanced, eclectic, cosmopolitan, wary of homely authority, at home in large, unwelcoming crowds) has come to adhere to everyone. After Mick Jagger’s birthday was celebrated on the stage at Madison Square Garden, it was celebrated again, at a party given by Ahmet at the St. Regis Roof. When Ahmet and Mica arrived at the St. Regis, there was already a great crowd in the lobby, around the elevators, on the sidewalk. In the lobby, transvestites lolled in gilt chairs, desperate for an invitation. People with invitations tried not to look at them.\n\nUpstairs, at the entrance to the St. Regis Roof, batteries of secretaries flanked by uniformed guards checked off names against an enormous list. On this list there were social people and celebrated people and some others for spice. The men in the business were not on the list. Freaky people with a plausible story—people who knew people who played in well-known groups—were not on the list and were repulsed at the door but did not give up. They commissioned people to tell other people that they were at the door, waiting. Two celebrated people, a man who used to be rich and a woman who used to be beautiful, were not on the list and were repulsed at the door, but it was so embarrassing to have them lolling around next to the list that they were let in.\n\nInside, Count Basie led his band. People sat at tables covered with green felt or pink felt. There was an old pastel style at the party, but it was in retreat. There was an old Negro style at the party, but it was just a picturesque hit. The style of the party (eclectic, reminiscent, amused, fickle, perverse) was the style of pleasure with an edge to it. Parts of the edge were blunt, however (no Great Social Figure could any longer provide a sense of violation by her presence; no Negro entertainer could any longer provide a sense of the elegance of the low-down), and parts of the edge were dangerous without being interesting. No small gesture had any meaning. The juxtapositions were so varied and so random that they lost meaning. The meaning was in the attempt, in the aspiration, and in the painful sadness of the times—which struggle for public pleasure and cannot find it, even in reminiscence and play-acting and juxtaposition and attempted violation, smartly assembled.\n\nAndy Warhol sat at a table covered with green felt. He had a Polaroid camera with him. A giant cake was brought in. A young black woman wearing rhinestone tassels popped out of this cake. She took off her rhinestone tassels one at a time. People stood on their chairs to see this. Someone asked Ahmet where he had found this young woman. “Andy Warhol found her,” he said. “She was in ‘Trash.’ Her name is Gerry. Gerry something.”\n\nMrs. William Rayner watched the young woman pop out of the cake. “I was at the rehearsal. The rehearsal was better,” she said.\n\nThere was a problem having to do with petty theft. All around the room, as part of the decorative scheme, there were giant flags printed with the Rolling Stones’ symbol of the moment—a giant tongue lolling out of a giant mouth. Everybody wanted one of these. People were quietly restrained. People were sulky. Later, they just ripped them off and took them home.\n\nThere was tap-dancing. The tap-dancers, who were deep into middle age, had been in a show called “The Best of the Hoofers,” which had played at various small theatres. The tap-dancers wore white pants, boaters, and white four-in-hand ties, and each of them carried a white cane with a black tip. Their first number was “The Darktown Strutters’ Ball.”\n\nAndy Warhol had been taking Polaroid pictures. Lee Radziwill began to take Polaroid pictures. Then Muddy Waters came on with his band. He dedicated a song to the Rolling Stones and to Marshall Chess and Chess Records. “I worked for Marshall Chess’s family for twenty-six years,” Muddy Waters said. He sang “Hoochie-Coochie Man.”\n\nLee Radziwill took a Polaroid picture of Mick Jagger. She asked Andy Warhol how his pictures had come out. “Oh, I’ve missed everyone,” Andy Warhol said. “I got Count Basie, and I got Dylan, but Dylan stuck together and I’ll never get it apart.”\n\nSandman Sims, one of the tap-dancers, looked around the St. Regis Roof approvingly. “I’ve just knocked myself out looking at the good-looking people,” he said. “It’s quite a while since I’ve been to this big of a party. In 1939, in California, Mae West gave a party. That’s the only one I can compare.”\n\nMuddy Waters, businesslike, packed up his equipment after his set was over. He and his musicians sat at a table near the bandstand. Muddy Waters and his band were geared for rapid appearances, rapid setups, and rapid departures. They were on the road. “We’ve been in Chicago, we’ve been up to Iowa,” he said. “We’re going out to Washington.”\n\nAt 3:45 A.M., a black transvestite made it past the door. At 4:10 A.M., Andy Warhol went home. At 4:15 A.M., a blond girl in a negligee made it past the door. “I was crazy for a while, but now I’m going to make a record deal,” she said. This was the important party of the early nineteen-seventies.\n\nAhmet and Mica went to a dinner party in New York given by a fashionable girl with frizzled hair for George Weidenfeld, the chairman of Weidenfeld & Nicholson, publishers, of London. George Weidenfeld occupies an interesting social position, significantly superior to Ahmet’s but within range of Ahmet. George Weidenfeld, like Prince Rupert Lowenstein, financial adviser to the Rolling Stones, is an experienced broker, dealing, on the one hand, with certain useful remnants of traditional authority (authority with the power to inhibit) and, on the other, with the custodians of contemporary power. Familiar enough with the mode that is eclectic, cosmopolitan, fickle, and perverse, George Weidenfeld makes it a point to inhabit a style whose surface is less vivid, less expansive, and more easily confused with the surfaces of a traditional gentleman.\n\nI asked Mica why Ahmet did not see as much of Jerry Wexler as he had in the past.\n\n“I don’t think, perhaps, that Jerry Wexler is that good a friend,” she said. “He tried to buy Ahmet out of the company once. With Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. I don’t think they were very good friends after that.”\n\nEntry in a diary: Went to see Ruth Brown, Club Baby Grand, on 125th Street. Club Baby Grand has outline of baby-grand piano inset in street front. The old fun. Cocktail glasses. Stemmed glasses flaring into a wide triangle. Not a bit of irony. Symbols of elegance, a good smooth time. Cocktail glasses reappearing downtown, overlaid with irony. Cocktail glasses held in hands of eighteen-year-old girls with blood-red nails and an edge of irony. The new fun. In the door at the Club Baby Grand. Bar in front. Entertainment in back. Very dark. Ruth Brown a fine-spirited woman with a hint of her old voice. Plump. Sang standards. Sang some of her old songs as though they were standards. An interest in grace. Very sweet. Straining toward Class. As though Ahmet had never come along. Back to “ ‘A’—You’re Adorable,” in a way. This doesn’t work now. “Miss Rhythm” wouldn’t work now, either, but something between “Miss Rhythm” and a parody of “Miss Rhythm” might work. A coating of irony to bring out the highlights.\n\nA thought: When whites manage blacks, they generally want the blacks to be more black than the blacks really want to be. When white entertainers imitate blacks, they generally try to make themselves rougher, more unsophisticated than they really are. Sometimes it works. No white, however, can capture the sweetness of a black singer or musician who is pushing himself toward sophistication.\n\nJerry Wexler once told me, “We recorded Ruth long past the time when it was really commercially there. We had to swallow ten to twenty thousand dollars in unrecouped studio costs.”\n\nAtlantic Records signed Bette Midler. Bette Midler had at that moment a novelty and a vogue. Her appeal was strong among those people who had lolled about the lobby of the St. Regis waiting to crash Ahmet’s party for Mick Jagger. Bette Midler was perceived as having a style. Bette Midler’s style embodied several surfaces from other, earlier moments (from the forties, especially), but it was overlaid with an irony that was completely of her own time. People who thought about the implications of this style (but not too deeply) said that it involved “nostalgia,” but in fact the style addressed itself not to the past or to any real appreciation of the past but to an ennui in the present. During the sixties, a number of historic adult modes had been thrown into discredit. During the early seventies, a number of historic adolescent modes had begun to pall. So that there were, in the St. Regis lobby and elsewhere, a large number of overexperienccd people, chronologically ready for adulthood, who were without a next step to take. Under cover of irony, some of these people began to cultivate an interest in dated adult manners. They began to adopt styles that had been in disrepute for a generation. Some girls began to dress up like “débutantes.” Some blacks began to dress up like Negroes. A considerable number of Americans, most of them of unremarkable middle-class background, began to cultivate an aesthetic (eclectic, appreciative, amused, fickle, perverse) that had in the past belonged to a few privileged people. And they began to cultivate a distanced infatuation with American artifacts and American archetypes which had in the past demarked most notably a few privileged foreigners, early transplanted.\n\nIn the spring of 1973, Atlantic Records gave a party for Bette Midler. Ahmet and Mica had a dinner before the party. Ahmet’s friend Earl McGrath was there with his wife, Camilla. Prince Lowenstein was there. The manager of a British rock-and-roll group was there. The fashionable young woman with frizzled hair was there. Another guest was a South American man of about fifty who had that European manner which only rich South Americans know. The South American man described his family to Prince Lowenstein. His family, the South American said, could claim a number of titles. His family, the South American said, was one of the few in Latin America listed in the Almanach de Gotha. “I’ve never used any title,” the South American said, “except a Jewish one that I think is amusing.”\n\n“That’s grotesque,” said the girl with the frizzled hair.\n\nThe manager of the British rock-and-roll group gave Ahmet a cricket bat. “I am very close to that boy,” Ahmet said. “I like him very much. At one point, I thought he was—well, a crook. I mean, he did in fact sell positions on the British charts. He was very clever about it, actually. He had a friend who worked for a computer company, and he gave the chart people a little tour of the computer company on a Saturday, when the real computer people were off, and he pretended he worked for the computer company, you know, and he told the record-chart people that the computer company had been doing some record charts as part of a project, and from then on the chart people began calling him up to get the computer’s chart results, and, of course, he gave them the names of some records he was being paid to promote. You know what? He’s a terrific manager. I think he’s terrific.”\n\nAfter dinner, there were several limousines to take people to the party for Bette Midler. Prince Lowenstein got into a limousine with Ahmet, keeping some distance from the South American. The South American waved at Prince Lowenstein as Lowenstein got into the limousine. “Almanach de Gotha!” the South American shouted.\n\n“Exactly!” said Prince Lowenstein.\n\n“You know, twenty years ago he was the most amusing man in New York,” Ahmet said as the limousine pulled away. “I mean, I could tell you the names of the people who were his friends. . . .”\n\nAhmet and Prince Lowenstein picked up Mick Jagger at the St. Regis before going to the party for Bette Midler. Mick Jagger got into the front seat with the driver. Mick Jagger and Ahmet began to talk about boxing in Turkey.\n\nThe party for Bette Midler was held at a place called the Café Russe—then the tenant of a bad-luck property in the East Fifties where restaurants and night clubs came and went. At the Café Russe, Mick Jagger was the main attraction. People crowded around him in an alarming way. Bette Midler was in the back of the room, receiving people. There was a crowd around her, too. Soon enough, Ahmet and his guests were back outside by the limousines. Everyone agreed that it would be more amusing to go to El Morocco than to stay at the Café Russe. Ahmet and Mick Jagger and Earl McGrath and the girl with the frizzled hair got into the first limousine and set out for El Morocco. When the car arrived at El Morocco, Earl McGrath asked if they didn’t require a coat and a tie there. Everyone agreed that they did require a coat and a tie. Mick Jagger, it was impossible not to notice, was not wearing either a coat or a tie. It was agreed to go instead to Le Club, where certain celebrated people could come as they pleased.\n\n“How do we let the other cars know that we’re not going to be at El Morocco?” Earl McGrath asked.\n\n“Someone has to stay and tell them,” Ahmet said. “I’ll stay.”\n\n“Let the driver stay,” Mick Jagger said.\n\n“Who’ll drive?” asked Ahmet.\n\n“I’ll drive,” Mick Jagger said.\n\nThe driver got out. Mick Jagger got into the driver’s seat and took the car abruptly into traffic.\n\n“Jesus,” said the girl with the frizzled hair. “What a way to die.”\n\nEarl McGrath turned to Ahmet. “If you were Leonard Chess, he’d drive for you all the time,” McGrath said.\n\n“He’s not Muddy Waters,” Ahmet said. “He’s just one of those white imitators.”\n\n“If you were Leonard Chess, I’d crash,” said Mick Jagger.\n\n“Jesus,” said the girl with the frizzled hair.\n\n“It’s true,” McGrath said. “Leonard Chess used to have Muddy Waters drive for him between recording sessions.”\n\n“Jesus,” said the girl with the frizzled hair. “What a way to die.”\n\nI went to a dinner at the house of Jerry Wexler. At the time of this dinner, Jerry Wexler lived in an elaborate penthouse apartment on Central Park South. The apartment had been decorated by Mica Ertegun. Jerry Wexler, who is a large, expansive man with a graying beard, was at this moment second in power to Ahmet at Atlantic Records, but he did not see Ahmet as often as he had in the past, and he did not see him at all socially. “Ahmet sees only two kinds of people—social people and morons,” Wexler said seriously. He paused. His voice changed. “And I ain’t either one.” He moved his shoulders in a jaunty way that was reminiscent of the jaunty way Ahmet sometimes moves his shoulders. He had assumed a black inflection just slightly more emphatic than the black inflection Ahmet sometimes assumes.\n\nThe area of Wexler’s power at Atlantic Records at the time of this dinner included most particularly the recording of black music. There was an interesting distinction to be made between his interest in black music and Ahmet’s. Both men had an appreciation of black musical and social forms which significantly outran the knowledge and instinct of other white men in the business, but although the two men could react as one man when they were confronted by any strong, incontrovertible excellence, it turned out that in the absence of any such special excellence what Ahmet most enjoyed in black music was paradox and anomaly and incongruity and excess of style, while Wexler sought instead evidence of that unspoiled energy which, taken together with eccentricity of expression, can be perceived as honesty. The separate aesthetics of Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler had difficulties that perfectly shadowed their outlines in the world. To the extent that their aesthetics converged, they shared a difficulty—the difficulty experienced by all white men who seriously interest themselves in black music: that at times they felt excluded from the deepest secrets of the enterprise and at other times they were deeply, deeply bored, and afraid that there were no secrets to learn and nothing to be included in. To the extent that their aesthetics diverged, they experienced separate difficulties. Ahmet’s interest in paradox and anomaly and incongruity had led him very far into artifice and contrived juxtaposition, until there was serious doubt whether there was raw material enough left in the music to satisfy his interest. Jerry Wexler’s interest in unspoiled energy and eccentricity of expression led him to actively seek what cannot be actively sought but only welcomed.\n\nAtlantic Records had been at the center of two remarkable moments in the history of black popular music. One of these moments—in the middle nineteen-fifties, during which artists like Ruth Brown and Joe Turner and the Clovers and Ray Charles had helped to establish the outlines of rhythm and-blues music and of rock and roll—had been shared by Ahmet and Jerry Wexler. The other—in the middle nineteen-sixties—belonged to Jerry Wexler alone. During the sixties, at a time when the company’s original burst of energy in the black marketplace had diminished, Wexler had superintended the careers of a new group of black artists, whose records defined a sound—rougher, more rural, more Southern, more like the simple blues, but no less fully “arranged” than the music that had brought Atlantic to prominence in the nineteen-fifties—that came to be called soul. (The term “soul music” has been used to define black popular music generally, but its most useful definition encompasses only the less urban black music of the sixties, which was also called “the Memphis sound.” The term “soul” is not usually applied, for instance, to music recorded by Motown Records, in Detroit. Motown Records had control, during the nineteen-sixties, of the more urban, more nervous trend in black music—a trend opposed for a while by soul music. Atlantic music during the nineteen-fifties, of course, had had the jittery urban quality that marked Motown Records in the sixties. During the last two decades, the nervous urban trend has consistently been the more significant—the simpler, more rural trend nearly always coming as a temporary reaction.) Some of these artists, like Otis Redding, were recorded on the Stax and Volt labels, which had a distribution agreement with Atlantic. Others were under direct contract to Atlantic and under the direct supervision of Jerry Wexler. Among the artists who worked most closely with Jerry Wexler were Wilson Pickett and Aretha Franklin. With Aretha Franklin, especially, Jerry Wexler did work sufficiently fine to justify the reputation of Atlantic as a company attentive to excellence in black music. Aretha Franklin had recorded for a number of years for Columbia, where her genius had been recognized but where no material appropriate to her genius had been given her. In her first session at Atlantic, Jerry Wexler gave her a song called “I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You.” This song (rougher, more rural, more Southern, more like the simple blues, but no less “arranged” than the songs she had recorded for Columbia) established a Voice for her and a presence in the commercial marketplace. Later songs confirmed her reputation as the most significant black voice of the time and Jerry Wexler’s reputation as the most significant white man making black music.\n\nIn his library (a small room with large windows facing north across Central Park), over an impressive sound system, Jerry Wexler played tapes of some music he had recorded with Ahmet during the early years at Atlantic. He played a song by Professor Longhair called “Tipitina.” “He didn’t have any material,” Jerry Wexler said. “We just told him, ‘You know, just play tee-nah-nah, do something like that.’ And so he made up this song. These lyrics have become endowed with great authority with the passage of time. We just wanted some off-the-wall stuff, some of that swamp music.” Jerry Wexler listened to “Tipitina.” “It was different in those days, when we were making records together. Ahmet wasn’t out to impress anyone, because there wasn’t anyone to impress.” He shut off the tape machine. “Everyone sees this company as some whole, unstoppable mushroom, but there were times when things were bad. And when things were bad Ahmet was the most standup person you ever knew. And uptown—Ahmet uptown, man, was something.”\n\nJerry Leiber was in the library. Jerry Leiber, with his partner, Mike Stoller, had written and produced (with the Coasters and the Drifters, especially) important hit records for Atlantic in the past. At a certain moment, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller had been the most productive of Ahmet’s subordinates. Jerry Leiber made reference to Ahmet’s protégé David Geffen, who, by this time, had made a large success of Asylum Records, a company he had founded in partnership with Atlantic. Wexler said with some irony, “David seems to be acting as sort of a spokesman for the whole conglomerate.”\n\nJerry Wexler left the room for a moment and returned with a tape. He put the tape on the machine. It was a tape of a song by Aretha Franklin that was about to be released. There was evidence of her extraordinary voice, but there was evidence, also, of something close to uncertainty—an uneasiness that was not obscured by the powerful bravado with which she used the instrument of her voice. It was not difficult to praise her voice, but it was impossible to praise the tape.\n\n“It’s upward mobility,” Jerry Leiber said. “Aretha is suffering from upward mobility.” He paused a moment. “We all does it,” he said, assuming a jaunty black inflection.\n\nFor a while, I saw Ahmet only by chance.Press release from Warner Communications, June 28, 1974:\n\nATLANTIC, ELEKTRA-ASYLUM MERGE FIRMS: AHMET ERTEGUN, DAVID GEFFEN, JERRY WEXLER NEW CHIEFS\n\nAhmet Ertegun, President of Atlantic Records, and David Geffen, Chairman of the Board of Elektra Asylum Nonesuch Records, both Warner Communication companies, announced this week an internal reorganization under which the two record companies would merge. The new company, which will be called Atlantic Elektra Asylum Records, will be headed by Ahmet Ertegun and David Geffen as co chairmen with Jerry Wexler as vice chairman. . . . From Cash Box, September 7, 1974:\n\nSEE DECISION IN ATLANTIC, ELEKTRA TIES IN ONE MONTH\n\nNew York—In about a month’s time the matter of the proposed merger of the Atlantic and Elektra/Asylum [companies] will be determined one way or another, Cash Box has learned. It’s understood that execs of both companies met recently and decided on a postponement of the merger.\n\nThen the merger was cancelled.\n\nAtlantic press release, July 17, 1975:\n\nJERRY WEXLER SIGNS LONG-TERM CONSULTANCY AGREEMENT WITH ATLANTIC RECORDSNew York, N.Y.—In a joint announcement today, Ahmet Ertegun, Chairman of the Board of Atlantic Records, and Jerry Wexler, Vice Chairman, advised that Wexler has signed a new and extended contract under which he will serve as consultant to the label. At the same time, it was stated that Wexler has resigned as Vice Chairman effective August 1, 1975. . . . Ahmet Ertegun stated: “It is with great reluctance that we forego Jerry’s daily services as one of the great working executives in our industry, but we understand his inclination to delve into new areas of activity and interest. . . .\n\nOne afternoon in 1975, Jerry Wexler said, “Ahmet says that we’re going to have a party. ‘We have to have a party at my house,’ he says. I think he means it when he says it, you know. I think they should put that on Ahmet’s tombstone—‘He Meant It When He Said It.’There was a brief vogue for David Geffen. David Geffen was seen with Cher. David Geffen went shopping with Cher. David Geffen shared a cover article in Esquire with Cher. “Who’s Man Enough for This Woman?” Esquire asked. David Geffen struck out on a new career. He left the record business and went to work for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, Ltd. It was rumored that his first project would be a movie with Warren Beatty that would be very explicit sexually. Later on, David Geffen broke up with Cher and Cher began to go out with Gregg Allman, and Ted Ashley came back to work at Warner Bros.-Seven Arts and couldn’t get along with David Geffen and so David Geffen left. (Later still, David Geffen accepted a Hoyt Fellowship at Yale, lecturing about the music business while he looked at his options.)Entry in a diary: Went to party in Beverly Hills given by Ahmet for the Rolling Stones at the house of Diana Ross. One of the new, triple-barrelled parties. The Duke of Bedford invites you to a dinner for Lauren Hutton at the home of Billie Jean King. Triple-barrelled parties always for the press in the end. Never really convincing. Diana Ross’s house almost all tennis court. Every inch of land cleverly arranged for a leisure activity. Backgammon inside. Diana Ross wearing a caftan. “I’ve spent the whole day with the guest list,” Diana Ross said. The force of aspiration makes things right sometimes. Sometimes not. At some point, doubt begins to creep in and spoils the simplicity of the aspiration. Diana Ross and the Supremes. Who could fault the aspiration of the Supremes? “Supreme” being a nice word. “I’ve spent the whole day with the guest list” leaves a little room for doubt, and for quarrels.\n\nNothing happened at party. Juxtapositions simply not possible in Beverly Hills. Berry Gordy there. Berry Gordy, head of Motown, responsible for the best nervous music. Has left Detroit for Los Angeles. Wearing madras jacket. Unknown quantity when he was in Detroit. Out of range of Ahmet. Everyone. Maybe ahead of Ahmet, everyone. Ahead no longer. Unknown no longer. Madras jackets well understood by Ahmet. Ahmet has better jackets.\n\nMost interesting person was Bianca Jagger. Carried a little cane. Her aspirations a little tougher, cut a little higher.\n\nAhmet talked with Berry Gordy. Their first meeting. Ahmet told Berry Gordy that he thought Motown had made the great music of its time. Berry Gordy told Ahmet he only sought to emulate Atlantic. Very courtly.\n\nI saw Ahmet and Mica at another dinner, given for George Weidenfeld. Jacqueline Onassis was there. Ahmet talked with Mrs. Onassis for a minute. “Do you know what she said?” Ahmet said to me. “She said something was ‘delish.’ She said it was ‘delish.’ I love that. ‘Delish.’I saw Ahmet at a large party given by an established businessman and his wife in an expansive apartment, where they had entertained expansively for a number of years. They were giving the party because they were giving up the apartment. The apartment, which had three floors and a ballroom, bore a legible mark: not the mark of the group that established itself on Fifth Avenue before the turn of the century but the mark of the next rich group—the group that had established itself off Fifth Avenue, and especially on Park Avenue and Sutton Place, during the nineteen-twenties. Once they begin to decline, of course, all groups begin to seem Old Guard, and it was clear that to the people at the party this apartment was as much of another era as the James B. Duke house. In fact, the apartment stood exactly between the James B. Duke house and the most representative of contemporary apartments and houses (among which one would number the Erteguns’ house on Eighty-first Street). The Duke house had been meant to establish a place within a hierarchy and had been meant to be inhibiting. It may even look a little foolish for that reason. This apartment made reference to the known hierarchy (and the known inhibitions) without coming down clearly on their side. The Ertegun house stands outside the traditional hierarchy altogether, appropriating only its luxury.\n\nI talked with Ahmet briefly, and he told me he was very pleased, because it looked as though he were going to re-sign Ray Charles to Atlantic.\n\nAhmet and Mica gave a dinner for George Weidenfeld at their house on Eighty-first Street. This was shortly after George Weidenfeld (who had been a knight) was created a baron. Jacqueline Onassis was asked to this dinner and went.Last year, Ahmet and Mica gave a dinner for fifty people in a private room at Gallagher’s Restaurant, which is a restaurant with an athletic flavor. Mr. and Mrs. William Rayner were there, and Kenneth Jay Lane, and Mr. and Mrs. Fredrick Eberstadt, and Andy Warhol and Maxime McKendry, and Bill Wyman, of the Rolling Stones, and Baby Jane Holzer and Rupert Lowenstein and Diana Vreeland.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Rayner discussed the burning, by arson, of a Canadian fishing camp where they and Ahmet and Mica had been guests the preceding spring. The arsonists, Mr. Rayner said, had come by snowmobile, spread fuel all about the house, and set it afire.\n\nMaxime McKendry, who was once the Countess de la Falaise and is sometimes still called by that name, said that she was very tired, because she had been working on a column she was writing for a Japanese newspaper. “I’ve been writing about cowboys,” Mrs. McKendry said. “I think the Japanese are interested in cowboys. I was a little thrown because Andy Warhol told me that cowboys have always been gay. Andy read that somewhere, I think. In any case, it confuses and clouds the cowboy issue.”\n\nAhmet was seating the dinner. He moved with concentration from table to table. From time to time, he conferred with Mica. I went up to him. I had not seen him in some time. I was surprised, as I had been surprised before, to find that I was very glad to see him. “There is a lot to tell you,” Ahmet said. “One or two amusing things. I was the chairman of the Istanbul Music Festival. And I’m an adviser to the Department of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University.” Ahmet rolled his eyes in a way that was jaunty and ironic. “And we’ve re-signed the Stones, and it’s definite that we’ll re-sign Crosby, Stills & Nash. And I think we will sign Ray Charles. You and I should have lunch,” Ahmet said, turning one or two seating cards in his hands. “I mean, it’s a little hard to talk . . . right now.”\n\nLater, at dinner, Mrs. Rayner told, in a simple, direct way, something of the recent history of her family as it had to do with a fishing camp maintained by them on the Au Sable River in Michigan. Her family’s camp, she said, lay along a stretch of river which had been bought by the rich families of Toledo. Access to the camp had been most easy by railroad, she said—it had been possible to hitch a private car onto a train of the Ann Arbor Railroad. “My family lived in a town called Perrysburg, outside Toledo,” Mrs. Rayner continued, “in a house called La Lanterne, which was an exact copy of a French hunting lodge called La Lanterne, in Versailles. During the Depression, we lost the house, and my grandmother had a difficult time. She had a German couple who were very, very loyal. My grandmother gave our camp to them, and they run it now for paying guests. I’ve been, and they serve quite good food.” Mrs. Rayner said that her grandmother, now in her eighties, had kept her health and had recovered her fortune and is now in the process of rebuilding La Lanterne according to the original plans, but in Haiti. “Better than Perrysburg,” Mrs. Rayner said. “Perrysburg is a dead town now. Completely dead.”\n\nAfter dinner, Ahmet and Mica and their guests went across the street to Roseland, the enormous dance hall, to see the Trammps, a group of black singers who were signed to Atlantic and were popular in discothèques. Ahmet and Mica and their guests went down a long corridor and across the vast central room to a special little area (marked off by an iron rail) to one side of the dance floor. It was not easy to see the stage from this special area without standing, which most of Ahmet’s guests declined to do. The Trammps, who had been together as a group for fifteen years, began their show with jabs of energy and special effects. There was smoke and something that looked like fire. They used the “power” salute of the nineteen-sixties in conjunction with their choreography.\n\n“Oh,” said Andy Warhol, who, because he was standing, was able to see a large sign over the stage. “They spell it with two ‘m’s. I thought they spelled it with two ‘a’s.”\n\n“Are they black or white?” Rupert Lowenstein asked. Rupert Lowenstein was seated.\n\n“Oh, black,” Andy Warhol said.\n\nOne of the Trammps addressed the audience over a microphone. “Are you ready to disco?” he asked excitedly.\n\n“I think we are always ready to disco,” Rupert Lowenstein said in a tone of resignation.\n\n“Oh!” Andy Warhol said. “I almost forgot to turn on my tape.”\n\n“How could you listen to it twice?” Rupert Lowenstein asked.\n\n“Oh, I never listen to my tapes,” Andy Warhol said.\n\nThe Trammps chanted one phrase over and over. The phrase was “Let’s go—disco.”\n\nOn the enormous floor, two young homosexuals danced to the music of the Trammps. They were dressed almost identically, in short-sleeved plaid shirts and olive-green Army pants bloused at the boot. Another young man wore a motorcycle suit. Another had a monkey wrench in his belt. A young black man wore tan jodhpurs, a pair of good jodhpur boots, and a modest polo shirt with an alligator on the chest. There were several black girls in espadrilles and many, many people in berets and plastic framed glasses.\n\nFrom The Atlantic Weekly, a public relations pamphlet, May 9, 1977:\n\nAHMET ERTEGUN RECEIVES CONFERENCE OF PERSONAL MANAGERS’ HUMANITARIAN AWARD\n\nAtlantic Records Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Ahmet Ertegun accepted the 6th annual Humanitarian Award from the Conference of Personal Managers East last week, presented at an exclusive luncheon in his honor at the St. Regis Roof in Manhattan.\n\nMore than 500 recording, entertainment industry, and society figures were on hand to celebrate. . . . Highlights during the luncheon were numerous, beginning with the a cappella rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner” by Cotillion Recording artists Sister Sledge.\n\nAmong the many stars on the dais were Roberta Flack, Ringo Starr (with fiance Nancy Andrews), Herbie Mann, Hazel Scott, and Connie Francis. An even wider range of guests included Turkish Ambassador to the United Nations Ilter Turkmen, Mr. and Mrs. Oscar de la Renta . . . Mr. Jerome Zipkin, and Mr. Mario Santo Domingo. . . .\n\nA highlight of the afternoon took place when Alan Gorrie and Steve Ferrone of the Average White Band made a surprise presentation to Mr. Ertegun on behalf of all the artists whose careers he has furthered over the years. In thanks, they presented him with a rare leather bound edition of Estampes Representantes Differents Nations du Levant, an historically important volume of engraved plates illustrating Turkish costumes of the era, published in England in 1814.\n\nI went to see Diana Vreeland at her apartment. Mrs. Vreeland was going to a party at the Italian Consulate. “You know, I think it’s quite remarkable about the consulates,” she said. “There is something going on. I was never an embassy girl. Never. And now! The French! The Persians! The Italians! Of course, we all know that the wops are all over the city. Marina Schiano! Those delicious little Rattazzis! Now, you understand, I see only Italians. And I am constantly at the consulates—which is interesting, I think, because I was never an embassy girl. Never.”\n\nI asked Mrs. Vreeland when she had first come to know the Erteguns.\n\n“I had them to dinner before anyone you know had them to dinner,” Mrs. Vreeland said. “Ten—more than ten—years ago. Why? Now, why did I have them? It must have been through Chessy Rayner. But Chessy was so young then. But it must have been through Ches, whom I’ve known forever, of course. But why did I ask them back? It was the energy. Of course, it was the energy.”\n\nThen Ahmet and I met for lunch at the Carlyle. The restaurant of the Carlyle, I was aware, reflected an important aspect of the sensibility of the moment, and reflected as well the taste of the Erteguns. I thought about an afternoon I had spent with Ahmet in his house on Eighty-first Street shortly after I first met him.\n\nAhmet had sat on a small gold chair in the third floor library and gone slowly through a pile of records. The room was elegant, severe, and predominantly white. The walls were white; the sound system next to Ahmet was encased in white. On a nearby desk was a white telephone; on a nearby table was a piece of pure-white quartz. Ahmet was wearing a pair of slacks of cavalry twill and a white silk shirt. His belt was a Brooks Brothers belt of the kind that was dominant during the nineteen-fifties—narrow, elastic, blue with red stripes. Ahmet wore velvet slippers with the initials “AE” worked in at the toe (where less ambitious velvet slippers have a fox head). Ahmet, as a favor to me, played the records he most liked. First he played a record of music by Johnny Dodds. The record was new, and Ahmet was obliged to free it from its plastic wrapping. He slit the wrapping deftly with a letter opener. “It has made me sad since I was the age of twelve that I never saw Johnny Dodds in person,” Ahmet said. As the record played, Ahmet imitated the sound of Johnny Dodds’ clarinet. “Da da doo,” he sang. “You have no idea,” he said. “Dodds was not as powerful as Louis Armstrong, but in some ways he was more soulful. This record was made in 1925.” Ahmet took the needle off the record and slit open another. He played a song by Lovie Austin and Her Blues Serenaders and sang with it. “It takes a brown-skin man to satisfy my mind,” Lovie Austin (and Ahmet) sang. Ahmet took this record off and opened another—by the King Oliver band, with Jelly Roll Morton. “I knew Jelly Roll Morton in Washington,” Ahmet said. “By then, he was already old-fashioned for blacks.” Ahmet gave a moment of deep attention to Jelly Roll Morton playing with the King Oliver band. “What they are playing here is the birth of swing,” he said. “Fifteen years later, Benny Goodman played that and was hailed as the King of Swing.”\n\nAhmet played “King Porter Stomp,” by King Oliver. “This was the inspiration of every white musician in Chicago,” Ahmet said. “That’s Louis Armstrong and King Oliver playing together. That’s the greatest thing in jazz. When I was a kid, I paid forty dollars for a 78 of this song. King Oliver was elegant, damn it.”\n\nAhmet played songs by Louis Armstrong and His Hot Seven. Then he played, just for a moment, music by Frank Teschemacher, Bix Beiderbecke, and the white jazz musicians of Chicago. Ahmet paused. Suddenly he began to talk about people who had not recorded, about music of which there was no record. “You used to hear these legends, you know, of people who were great. They’d say So-and-So was greater than Louis, you know, but he never made a record. There was a guy named Monk Hazel, who was a drummer and cornet player in New Orleans, and I went to see him in 1949 or 1950. And he used to talk about Emmett Hardy. Now, Emmett Hardy—nobody ever heard him play, right? Except Bix Beiderbecke, who was dead, and Monk Hazel. And Monk Hazel spent his life looking for old Edison cylinders on which Emmett Hardy was supposed to have played. . . . There is that thing, that possibility, about music that has been lost.”\n\nAhmet turned back to his stack of records. He played blues by Tampa Red, Cripple Clarence Lofton, and Cow Cow Davenport, slitting each wrapping with the letter opener, finding exactly the cut he wanted on each record, playing that cut for as long as it held his interest, then going on to the next. Sometimes it was the music that held his interest; sometimes it was the lyrics. He played “Can’t Get That Stuff No More,” by Tampa Red. “Used to sell hair grease. Got in trouble with the chief of police,” Tampa Red sang.\n\n“It’s incredible how black music stayed black when most black artists tried to be white,” Ahmet said.\n\nAhmet shuffled through the stack of records. “You know what?” he asked. “You know who my favorite is?” Ahmet put on a record of “Songs by Fred Astaire.” Fred Astaire sang “Puttin’ on the Ritz,” and Ahmet moved his shoulders, jauntily, with the beat.\n\nWarner Communications made Ahmet president of the New York Cosmos soccer team. One evening, Ahmet took busloads of people out to the New Jersey Meadowlands to see the Cosmos play. People from Women’s Wear Daily were invited. Some people on the buses were critical of Ahmet, because they thought he was exploiting his social friends to publicize his soccer team. “This group is beginning to look like Le Riffraff,” a woman said who had been infatuated with Ahmet and then disappointed. There was a party after the game in a room under the stadium. Ahmet had arranged for a band—the Jazz All Stars. Among the musicians in the band was Clarence Hutchenrider, a musician whom Ahmet has admired since he was a boy. “The first time I saw him, I was fifteen years old,” Ahmet told me. “I wanted to get his autograph, but I couldn’t get up on the stage to get it, so at one point they asked for volunteers from the audience to do a magic trick, or something, and I volunteered, and when I got up on the stage I went over to Hutchenrider and said, ‘Can I have your autograph?,’ and they kicked me off the stage. That was at the Warner Brothers Earle Theatre.”Then Halston, the designer of loose, unstructured clothes, gave a birthday party for Bianca Jagger. This was not long after Bianca Jagger was on the cover of People (“Bianca Jagger: She talks bluntly about husband Mick, their love affairs and her need for independence”). Halston’s party was given in his house in the East Sixties, which may be the last private house to have been built in Manhattan. The house presents a façade of smoky glass. Inside, there is a large white space, with a railless stairway ascending to a balcony. It is a space for the observation of poses. The party for Bianca Jagger had for its duration the air of a party still assembling. Because Halston dislikes plates and knives and forks, he did not serve dinner but provided, rather, many elaborate hors d’oeuvres. These were served by that new breed of young man who has recently taken an interest in catering and who serves food impeccably—without reference to any authority that could be perceived as inhibiting.\n\nDiana Vreeland was there. A young man without much conversation introduced himself to Diana Vreeland as someone who was interested in sandals. “You know, that’s a very interesting subject—sandals,” Mrs. Vreeland said. She told a long story that involved a high official under Mussolini, the brothel at Pompeii, a tiny gold slave necklace, and, ultimately, a pair of ancient Roman sandals preserved in lava. “With just one thong,” Mrs. Vreeland said. “Pulled back like this. I had several pairs made up for me in Capri. Later, I went to my friend Mr. Maxwell in New Jersey and he copied them. Mr. Maxwell made a lot of money from that sandal. He made so much money he died.”\n\nPat Cleveland and Sterling St. Jacques were there. At first, they stayed up on a little ledge against the west wall; later, they went up to the balcony. Pat Cleveland and Sterling St. Jacques are very striking black models. Some people remark that they are the new Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Other people claim that that story began with Pat Cleveland and Sterling St. Jacques themselves. Pat Cleveland may play a part in a movie about Josephine Baker. Sterling St. Jacques wore black leather pants and a silver-and-turquoise belt.\n\nAfter a while, Halston told his guests that the party was going to move to Studio 54, the new discothèque on West Fifty fourth Street. “Bianca is going to ride a white horse with a nude man,” Halston said.\n\nSterling St. Jacques kissed Mrs. Vreeland twice. He told her that she had to come to Studio 54. “It’s very futuristic,” he said.\n\n“Bianca is going to ride in on a white horse with two nude men,” said Joe Eula, who is a friend of Halston’s.\n\nMarina Schiano, who represents Yves Saint Laurent in this country, said that she, too, thought Studio 54 was futuristic. She said that the elaborate lighting at Studio 54 constituted “an art form.”\n\n“I’ve never understood that—about art forms,” Mrs. Vreeland said. “People say a little Schiaparelli design is an art form. Why can’t it just be a very good dress?”\n\nRupert Lowenstein was at Halston’s party for Bianca Jagger, but he left early and did not go to Studio 54. Ahmet and Mica arrived late at Halston’s and then did go on to Studio 54.\n\nStudio 54 is one of the new breed of discothèques and is done in a style that is eclectic, reminiscent, and perverse. Studio 54 makes it a point to stress pleasure with an edge to it. The street was deserted as cars began to arrive at Studio 54 from Halston’s house. Some people were puzzled and confused about the address.\n\nDiana Vreeland, puzzled, went up to two black men who were standing near the curb drinking whiskey. She asked them if they knew where the party was.\n\nThe black men smiled. “Must be there,” one of them said, pointing a little way down the block.\n\n“Righto!” said Mrs. Vreeland cheerfully, and she went off down the block.\n\nAhmet stood with Halston in front of a silver scrim on the dance floor of Studio 54. There were sharp-angled lines on the scrim, reminiscent of the sharp-angled lines associated with the term Art Deco. In front of Ahmet and Halston, there were twelve poles clustered with lights. From time to time, these poles descended from the ceiling toward the floor and then ascended again. There was loud music. Unpleasing, contrived, eclectic, monotonous discothèque music, the last murky result of the amalgam of black and white musical motifs—the background against which the tiny dramas of white and black misapprehension are nowadays played. Ahmet, more than Halston, moved with the music, but he didn’t move much. Mica got a glass of champagne. “I didn’t think the white wine could be good,” she said.\n\nA woman, an intelligent and social woman who had been infatuated with Ahmet and then critical of him, sat on a banquette (formed of inflated silver elements) and watched Ahmet against the scrim. “Of course, he can’t stand to be alone,” she said. “And, of course, he’s not at all secure. But the most remarkable thing, I think, is that there’s no one he doesn’t feel snubbed by. Basically, I think he loathes anything established, even though he will court it. Which is why sometimes he will pound a wall or make an awkward move, on purpose, in public or under a table.” She paused for a moment, continuing to look at Ahmet. “The person who has his number is Rupert Lowenstein,” she said. “I have watched Rupert put him through hoops. I remember Rupert talking about a party he was going to take Ahmet to—a really tacky party. Rupert kept saying, ‘Of course, it’s quite chic. Not all your guests will be able to come.’ Anyone could have gone to that party.”\n\nBianca came in on a white horse. The horse was led by a young man and a young woman who had circus costumes painted on their bodies. Bianca wore a red dress. She was quite remarkably good-looking.\n\nI went to talk with Mrs. Vreeland. “The thing about Bianca is the patrician quality,” Mrs. Vreeland said. “A little bit of this, a little bit of that—from where? Nic-a-ra-gua, is it? But patrician. Always patrician. And, of course, there is the skin. That incredible skin.” Mrs. Vreeland started to leave to talk with Mick Jagger. “Mick is the most attractive man in New York when he’s had one or two days’ rest,” she said.\n\nA new scrim came down on the stage. It showed the man in the moon and a spoon. The bowl of the spoon was rimmed by lights, and so was the nose of the man in the moon. It was possibly the first discothèque scrim with a cocaine motif.\n\nAhmet came up to me. “What the hell are you doing here?” he asked. After a moment, he told me that his deal with the Rolling Stones had finally been settled, that it meant a lot to him that Mick Jagger would continue to be associated with Atlantic Records, that he was going to fly to the West Coast that week to re-sign Crosby, Stills & Nash, but that the re-signing of Ray Charles to Atlantic was in some doubt. “I listened to the tape he sent,” Ahmet said. “We can’t put out that tape.”\n\nIn the end, Atlantic did re-sign Ray Charles. His album, released under the title “True to Life,” peaked at seventy-eight on Billboard’s chart and then dropped back down. The album is filled with unsuccessful songs, but one, “The Jealous Kind,” is a classic song—a classic Ray Charles song, a classic Atlantic song, a song of the kind that Led the Field in Rhythm & Blues. ♦"
