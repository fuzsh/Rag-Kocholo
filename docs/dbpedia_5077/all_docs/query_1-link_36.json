        "text": "A&M RECORDS HISTORY 1960s\n\n1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969\n\nA&M RECORDS FOUNDED: 1962\n\nI want to be Columbia Records. I always liked songs. I remember great songs.... Being with a musician helped me get along with other musicians.--Jerry Moss\n\nThe musician and the promotion man. Jerry Moss began his career in the music industry promoting records. \"I would find something different to say about every record.\" With Herb Alpert, Moss found a friend. Before there was a record label, the two would analyze records finding out what they liked.\n\nBy mid-year Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss each invested $100 to form a partnership they called Carnival Records. Carnival released two singles, \"Tell It to the Birds\" by Dore Alpert (a Herb Alpert vocal released in July) and \"Love Is Back in Style\" by Charlie Robinson.\n\nCarnival was only able to create local distribution but \"Tell It to the Birds\" became a local hit. To get national distribution of the Dore Alpert single, Herb and Jerry sold it to Dot Records for $700. \"Tell It to the Birds\" sold between 12-15,000 copies (about 7,000 units in California) that earned the partners about $3,500.\n\nThe second single released by Alpert and Moss was by Charlie Robinson. Moss knew Robinson socially. Charlie Robinson was an actor and at the time TV actors were having hit records. \"Love Is Back in Style\" did not sell well.\n\nIn August, Carnival became A&M Records when Alpert and Moss learned another record company used the Carnival name first. Moss also brought his music publishing company Irving Musicto the deal. Both Carnival and A&M Records began as divisions of Irving Music. The business address was 419 Westbourne Dr., West Hollywood, California--Herb Alpert's garage. Said Jerry Moss, \"We had a desk, piano, piano stool, a couch, coffee table and two phone lines. And that for the two of us worked out very well, because we could go over the songs on the piano and make phone calls to the distributors. We also had an answering service at the time. I'd do all my own billing.\"\n\nMoss told Billboard, \"People advised us against starting a record company with the 'Lonely Bull' single but we had faith in the sound and didn't want to lease the master, so we went for broke.\"\n\nThe single of \"The Lonely Bull\" was recorded in August-September 1962. The album version of the song was recorded in October 1962. The single was released in late September 1962. In the U.S. the single peaked at #6 on the Billboard and Cash Box charts. In Australia the song was #1 for five consecutive weeks.\n\nImage\n\nFestival Records in Australia licensed the single and on December 22, 1962, \"The Lonely Bull\" reached #1 on the Australia singles chart. Alpert and Moss retained Festival Records as its distributor in Australia and New Zealand until they sold the label in 1989. This was the longest of all of A&M's international licensing and distribution agreements.\n\nA&M selected Jerry Dennon's Craig Corporation as its second distributor.\n\nSeptember 1962 is the date attributed to the first commercial use of the A&M Records logo originally shown with the A&M typeface, trumpet and rectangle with rounded corners. The logo remained in use until March 16, 2020.\n\nOn October 27, \"The Lonely Bull\" entered the Billboard Pop Singles Chart. It peaked on December 8, 1962 at the #6 position. The single sold about 700,000 copies and netted about $180,000. The Lonely Bull album was released in December and on December 29, it entered the Billboard charts. In December, EMI acquired \"The Lonely Bull\" for its Stateside label in England.\n\nIn November, the label released \"Little White Lies/Story of an Evergreen Tree\" by the Kenjolairs. It showed regional sales potential in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Hartford, Connecticut according to Billboard.\n\nThe original record manufacturer of A&M products was Monarch Records. Monarch would remain one of A&M's manufacturers until 1979. A&M's interest in quality pressings started with \"The Lonely Bull.\" At the time, monaural albums were pressed on styrene and stereo on vinyl. Alpert insisted on vinyl for his mono album.\n\nAs 1962 ended, Alpert and Moss had scored three successes: they had their first Top 10 single; their first album was on the Billboard Album Charts, and they had hired their first employee, Jolene Burton, as operations manager ensuring that records were pressed, jackets were printed, and to manage accounts received and bill payment.\n\nFestival Records of Australia paid $500 to distribute A&M Records. Their association lasted until 1989. In the U.S. A&M used independent distributors including Schwartz Brothers (Washington, DC) and Topps (Miami, FL).\n\n1962 BILLBOARD POP SINGLES CHART\n\nALBUMSSINGLESHerb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (1)Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (1)\n\nTop\n\n1964\n\nMost of our hits have come from left field. We search for the strange sound and we seem to have an ear for this kind of tune. You can drop dead with it or sell four million copies.\"\n\n--Jerry Moss, Billboard, June 20, 1964\n\nGil was responsible for the look of the company; advertising, campaigns, copywriting, liner notes. Gil dealt with industry people.\n\nI was responsible for the sound of the company. I dealt with artists and managers because I didn't have time for more.\n\n--Jerry Moss\n\nIn April, A&M signed Waylon Jennings to a new contract.\n\nIn November, Alpert and Moss hired their second employee, Gil Friesen as their General Manager. Jerry Moss told the story of meeting Gil at Alan Freed's first day at Los Angeles radio station KDAY in 1960. Moss knew Freed from his work as a promotion man in New York where Freed was the most famous DJ. Freed was also known for his dance shows and movies. At KDAY that day Freed chose the record Friesen was promoting for Capitol Records as his Pick Of the Week. After the event, Moss sought out Friesen. Moss remembers Friesen as the first friend he made in California.\n\nThe third employee was engineer Larry Levine who was often called \"the eighth member of the Tijuana Brass.\" Friesen's first big contribution to A&M was to talk Herb Alpert into performing. He and Alpert hired the musicians and played two performances as the opening act for Dave Brubeck in Santa Monica.\n\nIn 1964, A&M released five albums and grossed about $500,000. Two of the Tijuana Brass singles and one Baja Marimba Band album appeared on the Billboard charts. The Lonely Bull album sold 125,000 copies during the year and the Baja Marimba Band single \"Comin' In the Back Door\" sold over 100,000 copies. The third Tijuana Brass album South of the Border was released in October. Moss estimated that the first three TJB albums sold 60,000 copies.\n\nA&M struck its first international licensing agreement with Festival Records in Australia. In December, A&M finalized a distribution deal with Pye Records for Great Britain and South Africa. Until then, A&M licensed its music to the British market on a per record basis. The Lonely Bull album was licensed to EMI and The Baja Marimba Band was licensed to Decca internationally. A&M also had licensing arrangements with Nippon Victor in Japan and Quality Records in Canada.\n\nSan Francisco radio station KSFO ran an early contest promoting A&M. It was called, \"Why I Would Like Herb Alpert to Write a Song for Me.\" The winning contestant was Wincle Lamoyan Coan who was chosen for his unusual name. The song was titled \"Wincle Lamoyan Coan\" and was recorded by the Baja Marimba Band.\n\nA&M signed Young Billy Beau who, at ten years old, was the youngest artist A&M would ever sign. Billy recorded one single for A&M titled \"Kids.\" He went on to be known as Billy Burnette. \"Kids\" was written by Dr. Seuss.\n\nSigned Captain Beefheart. Re-signed Waylon Jennings.\n\nPRICE AND FORMAT HISTORY\n\nMonaural albums retailed for $3.98 and stereo albums sold for $4.98.\n\n1964 BILLBOARD CHARTS\n\nBILLBOARD POP ALBUMS AND SINGLES CHART\n\nALBUMS SINGLES The Baja Marimba Band (1) Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (2)\n\nBILLBOARD ADULT CONTEMPORARY CHART\n\nSINGLES Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (2)\n\nTop\n\n1965\n\nBillboard reported that in March A&M made $175,000 and did $200,000 of business in April.\n\nIn May, A&M signed with Capitol Record Club anticipating that it would bill $2 million during the year.\n\nTommy LiPuma was hired in July as the label's first artists and repertoire (a&r) manager and a staff producer. His duties also included working with the Irving/Almo catalog of songs and acquiring singles. Dave Hubert was the director of music publishing. Marshall Lieve was hired as a producer and Chester Pipkin as a staff writer for Irving Music.\n\nIn August, A&M Records established a second music publishing company, Almo Music.\n\nThe Alpert and Brass single \"Whipped Cream\" sold about 150,000 copies. In September, the Brass played its last concert as an opening act, this time for Johnny Mathis. In October, George Carlin and Astrud Gilberto opened for the TJB at Basin Street East in New York City. They played three shows a night for three weeks to sell-out crowds.\n\nFrank Werber's Trident Productions entered an exclusive distribution deal with A&M Records. The deal brought We Five to A&M and gave the label its second top five record on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart in October. The success of the single created a rush-release for the album of the same name.\n\nFestival Records, the A&M distributor in Australia rush-released the Tijuana Brass single \"Third Man Theme\" because it was expected to be the biggest selling TJB single since \"The Lonely Bull.\"\n\nIn Europe, A&M was distributed by PYE in England; Decca in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Holland and Belgium; Pathe Marconi in France, and CGD in Italy.\n\nOn October 8, the Baja Marimba Band held its first concert at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. They appeared with comedian Bill Cosby.\n\nFor the first time the label had two hit singles--\"A Taste of Honey\" and We Five's \"You Were on My Mind,\" numbers 1 and 2 respectively in Cash Box. Their albums, Whipped Cream and Other Delights and You Were on My Mind sold one million copies in one month. The TJB records were selling at a rate of 50,000 copies per day in late 1965. The company grossed about $6 million in 1965.\n\nA&M entered the 4- and 8-track tape formats with manufacturing and distribution by ITCC.\n\nOn December 15, A&M Records received its first RIAA gold album certifications for Whipped Cream and Other Delights and Going Places!, both by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. A&M won its first four Grammy Awards for the single \"A Taste of Honey\" by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.\n\nBy year's end, A&M had placed five singles and one album on the Billboard Pop charts. Herb Alpert put two albums and three singles on the charts.\n\nOn Cash Box Top Records of the Year, We Five's \"You Were On My Mind\" was #10. Its #21 Top Album was Whipped Cream & Other Delights by Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass.\n\nARTIST SIGNINGS\n\nIn December La Bert Ellis was signed by Tommy LiPuma. Other signings included The Grads (later renamed The Sandpipers, the New Comers.\n\nOther signings this year were Bill Dana, The Sequins, and Sergio Mendes & Brasil '65. (Mendes changed the group's name to Brasil '66 with the release of his first album Herb Alpert Presents Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66.) With the signing of Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66, Alpert and Moss met Mendes' attorney, Abe Somer. Somer would go on to become A&M's general counsel and a member of its board of directors.\n\n1965 BILLBOARD CHARTS\n\nBILLBOARD POP ALBUMS AND SINGLES CHART\n\nALBUMS SINGLES Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (2) Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (3)\n\nWe Five (2)\n\nBILLBOARD ADULT CONTEMPORARY CHART\n\nSINGLES Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (4)\n\nChris Montez (1)\n\n>We Five (1)\n\n1965 GRAMMY® AWARDS\n\nCATEGORY TITLE ARTIST WON Best Engineered Recording Taste of Honey (a) Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass\n\n(Larry Levine, Eng.)

La Brea Avenue, Hollywood with 32 employees. On buying the Charlie Chaplin Studios, Jolene Burton remembers, \"With absolutely no idea that we would possibly, conceivably buy it, Jerry and I went over with the real estate people and the attorney. Herb was out of town. When we drove through the gates, I took one look at Jerry and said, 'We just bought ourselves a piece of property!' Immediate enthrallment. When Herb came back he took one look in Philadelphia to handle its East Coast work.\n\nBob Fead said that on his first day of work (Fead was hired as the national sales director), A&M sold 278,000 records. By the end of the year, Herb Alpert sold 13.7 million albums and sales exceeded $25 million.

A&M made a three-year distribution deal with EMI for Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia.\n\nRick Wakeman's live double album was the first CD-4 discrete album released by the label. The quad albums were in the SQ format from Columbia and QS format from Sansui. Producers determined which format they wanted to use. Wakeman's album was SQ.

We personally go around the country visiting these people. They know our catalogue, and we tailor our merchandising tools for that retailer...we try to help them. When you spend a lot of money on a display, and ship it out, you have to take into account what type of store you are sending the display to. Some places can't use stand-ups; some stores don't use counter displays, and other retailers can only use counter displays. What we did was send out questionnaires and had each account tell us what they can use. The last thing we want to do is promote an idea that is too impractical for the retailers.\"\n\nIndependent distributors filed a $10.5M antitrust lawsuit against A&M and Motown. Jack Solinger claimed both labels dropped his company Independent Music Sales. The suit went to the Supreme Court in 1979. The court decided that if Solinger could prove he was ready to buy IMP in 1972, that he could pursue his case.\n\nIn the first of only three times, A&M did not win a Grammy.

It's not just one cut that's popular, the public wants to hear where that artist is coming from....\n\nA group that has no basis other than a single has little to go on.\"\n\n--Billboard, June 26, 1976\n\nOn the business side, A&M Records now had over 300 employees. In January, Jolene Burton became the first vice president of financial affairs and Dave Hubert the first vice president of international. In February, A&M named John Anthony as its East Coast Director of A&R. Staffing in the New York office was increased by 40%. It had full promotion, sales, merchandising, a&r, advertising and publicity departments. A&M recognized that some of its artists had stronger airplay, audience and sales in the eastern U.S. By working from the artist's base, it helped the artists establish their national identities.\n\nIn March, A&M created a director of singles sales. Ernie Campagna was the first person to fill this position.\n\nA&M Records create a special products division. Among its duties was the development of A&M's black music marketing with Boo Frazier (east), Robert York (Midwest), Veta Victorian (south) and Brenda Johnson (west). Frazier also led the staff. Harold Childs told Cash Box, \"The entire company is involved in one promotional effort. Not only do the special projects people cover the black stations, but so do our local promotion men in every city. As a result, the black stations are likely to be contacted twice on a particular product, which further enables us to build a strong bas in each market. And the special projects people also promote all or artist.... Combined with the fact that our roster is very selective and carefully chosen, I think this helps to build our overall credibility.\"\n\nA&M won compensatory and punitive damages from E-C Tapes which was found guilty of selling pirated tapes from 1971 through 1975.\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nSeptember 24 was the first commercial use of Almo Rapid Play logo for its line of music books and sheet music.\n\nA&M created a holiday giveaway game. It printed 18 million game cards with a potential 4.5 million winners. The game cards gave winners 50 cents off the cost of an album or a free album from a group of 16 recent albums.

The game increased sales by 200-300,000 albums and $750,000.\n\nAlso in December, A&M Records brought suit against Dark Horse Records to dissolve distribution agreement; sought $10M in damages, and ultimately won $4 million.\n\nChuck Mangione won the only Grammy for the year. 1976 was A&M's second best in history for RIAA gold records. They received 13, including four for the Captain & Tennille, two for Cat Stevens, and two for Nazareth. This was also the first year that RIAA began its platinum certifications. Earlier recordings deserving of platinum status were not dated. In 1976, A&M artists received three platinum records. A&M Records led all independent record companies with the most RIAA gold and platinum record awards for the year.\n\nAnother solid year on the Billboard charts with 22 singles and 30 albums.

The program included posters and displays as well as print ads in school and local newspapers. Artists on tour also helped by conducting workshops and seminars. Bob Frymire told Billboard, \"Campus reps are the eyes and ears of the street. They are in tune with new music and what students are into. It's also a training ground for those hoping to break into the music business.\"\n\nMost notorious signing and release from A&M Records--the Sex Pistols. They were signed privately to the label on March 9. The public signing was staged on March 10, and A&M was going to rush the Pistols' single God Save the Queen to promote their newest artist. The Sex Pistols, however, had another record: their reputation for offensive behavior. Their conduct at the public signing, and the reaction it caused among other A&M artists who questioned whether the Pistols could fit into the A&M \"family\", caused Alpert and Moss to buy out the Pistols contract. They were dropped from the artist roster on March 16. By then, some copies of the single had been printed and found their way to the public. Billboard reported that the Sex Pistols contract was for two years and 20 tracks. The group's manager, Malcolm McLaren, estimated the deal was worth about $240,000. Upon signing, Derek Green told Billboard, \"Signing the Sex Pistols gives us a unique business opportunity to be involved with a new force in rock music, spearheaded by this group....I believe the group will effect some major changes in recorded music.\" Billboard also reported that A&M would not \"exercise any control over the group's public behavior....But one thing is certain: we're not on a crash course for signing punk rock bands.\" Billboard subsequently reported, \"Dumped by A&M for 'bad behavior after finalization of the deal.'\" A&M's John Deacon said, \"The decision was taken by Derek Green the managing director alone. There was no pressure from A&M in the U.S.....He also has the full support of all the staff here.....Unfortunately, the group's behavior since signing with the company compelled reconsideration of the situation.\"\n\nIn March and April, A&M ran a print, radio and in-store promotional campaign for its jazz catalog of more than 70 albums from its affiliation with CTI, Horizon and those released on the A&M label. The effort spotlighted the range of artists on the labels and was supported with a jazz sampler album.\n\nSqueeze signed with A&M in July.\n\nDavid Kershenbaum signed a long-term agreement to produce new and established artists\n\nThere were many promotions at A&M headquarters in April. This was the first realignment in A&M Records history. President Jerry Moss's new title was Chairman, Executive Vice President Herb Alpert became Vice Chairman, Senior Vice President Gil Friesen was now President, Vice President of Sales and Distribution Bob Fead was named the Senior Vice President of Marketing and Distribution, Andy Meyer was named vice president of special projects, Pete Mollica became the assistant national director of promotion, Ken Powell became the first director of business affairs, Chuck Kaye became President of Irving/Almo Music and Rondor Music, and Gerry Lacoursiere became President of A&M Records Canada. Thanks to this first major restructuring in the company, Moss was to spend more time with artists, producers and managers and Alpert was to focus more on producing records. Mike Ledgerwood left A&M Ltd. to move to A&M's New York Office as its director of publicity.\n\nA&M established a national special projects coordinator position. Al Edmondson was the first to fill it. Karen Lipold was appointed merchandising manager. In the international division, Bob Brownstein was hired as a special projects coordinator. In July Louise Barnum became the director of production.\n\nBob Reitman became the director of advertising and merchandising; Jeff Ayeroff was the director of creative services and product managers, and Kiki LaPorta was promoted to advertising media director. Allen Levy became the first national publicity manager. Joan Dlugatch was appointed promotion coordinator.\n\nOn June 22, the Financial Center (nicknamed Jolene's building) opened at 1336 N. La Brea Avenue; Financial Affairs had over 40 employees under Jolene Burton. The building was designed by Harry Newman who also designed A&M Canada's headquarters.\n\nA&M June 1977 National Meeting Book\n\nThe Many Faces Of A&M\n\nA&M began running spots on the spectacolor board in New York's Times Square to promote concerts and new albums by its artists.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1977, A&M hired over 100 employees in the U.S.\n\nThe east coast publicity operation was restructured with an east coast publicity director; publicity director; publicity administrator. This was done as the entire east coast operation expanded. Michael Leon was hired as the New York local promotion man.\n\nThe sales and marketing department promoted Ernie Campagna as its national sales director and Bernie Grossman as the national singles sales manager. Both reported to Bob Fead, vice president of sales and marketing.\n\nThe merchandising staff was also expanded with a director of special marketing products, a west coast regional merchandising director, and a southern regional merchandising director. Janice Whiffen became the national advertising manager.\n\nThe promotions department established regional promotion directors with Don Tolle in the southern region; Larry Green in the western region; Steve Dunn in the midwest, and Ron Farber in the northeast.\n\nThe international department appointed an international marketing director, a publicity coordinator and an administrative coordinator. Susan Woodnick was the liaison with A&M's 45 affiliate companies and also worked on tours outside the U.S.\n\nThe publicity department appointed Lee Cadorette to the director of publicity, west coast, and Peggy King to associate in publicity, west coast; Susan Brainin to national tour press coordinator and Barbara Fisher an associate in tour press publicity. Bernard Comas was the national publicity coordinator for special markets.\n\nThe product management department was expanded. Jordan Harris became the senior product manager; Bud Scoppa as product manager/special projects; Dorene Lauer product manager, and Jamie Cohen product coordinator.\n\nA&M started A&M Pacific, hiring its own direct sales staff to work directly with its major retailers, one-stops and rack jobbers. Headed by Les Silver, National Sales Manager, A&M Pacific had a staff of four. A&M Pacific was A&M's first step toward developing a full national sales staff.\n\nA&M entered an agreement with Phonogram to represent its products in Nigeria, Kenya, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nIt was a strong year in the r&b market. The core artists were Quincy Jones, Billy Preston, Brothers Johnson and L.T.D. The label was also successful in crossing over artists like Peter Frampton and Pablo Cruise into the r&b. The label also had a stable of potential crossover artists. Gil Friesen told Record World that the label had waited for the right artists to come along then developed them so they hit the chart when they were ready rather than making a conscious decision to enter the r&b market. At this point, Quincy had a major album with the Roots soundtrack; the Brothers Johnson's first two albums were platinum; L.T.D. had recorded two albums and had a hit single.\n\nA&M created the first promotional picture disc with 4,000 copies of Peter Frampton's I'm in You which it sent to distributors when the album went double platinum. A&M also extended in-store display materials with 4' x 4' posters mounted on foamcore, modular displays that could be used in record bins or as mobiles or as stand-up displays.\n\nA&M held a month-long campaign for its jazz recordings from CTI, Horizon and A&M that included radio spots; in-store mobiles and posters, and a special A&M jazz sampler album.\n\nHorizon Records also received top attention this year. In November, Tommy LiPuma was chosen to head the division and in December he became Vice President of A&M and Creative Developer of Horizon Records, now as a contemporary music series rather than a one-record deal for jazz artists.\n\nA&M Records Europe was established in Paris.\n\nA&M's holiday theme display was \"Give 'Em the Good Stuff\" with a display that could be placed on the floor, wall or hung from the retailer's ceiling.\n\nIn December, the concert by the Brothers Johnson and L.T.D. at the Los Angeles Forum was the first national satellite broadcast of R&B artists. The concert was aired in Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans and Washington, DC. Ads, flyers, posters were placed in the cities that aired the concert.\n\n1977 was A&M's best year ever for RIAA gold records. Nineteen certifications were given to artists. Top artists each had two certs, the Captain & Tennille, Brothers Johnson, L.T.D., Styx and Supertramp. There were also four RIAA platinum certifications, each to different artists.\n\nIt was also one of A&M's two best years on the Billboard Pop album chart with a record five albums in the Top 10, and a total of 31 A&M albums entered the Billboard chart.\n\nPhonogram Ltd. distributed A&M Records in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Phonogram's promotional campaign for Letta Mbulu's Music In the Air imported catalog from A&M U.S. and Britain. RPM Records continued to distribute A&M in South Africa. In July, A&M entered an album and tape licensing deal with CBS for 12 European countries.\n\nPRICE AND FORMAT HISTORY\n\nSERIESALBUMS8-TRACKCASSETTESP 4100$6.98-7.98$7.98$7.98SP 3700$8.98$8.98$8.98\n\n1977 BILLBOARD CHARTS\n\nBILLBOARD POP ALBUMS AND SINGLES CHARTALBUMSSINGLESBILLBOARD ADULT CONTEMPORARY CHARTSINGLESBILLBOARD RHYTHM & BLUES AND HIP-HOP CHARTALBUMSSINGLESCaptain & Tennille (2)\n\nNils Lofgren (2)\n\nNazareth (2)\n\nRick Wakeman (2)Peter Frampton (3)\n\nCaptain & Tennille (3)\n\nCarpenters (3)\n\nCat Stevens (3)\n\nRita Coolidge (2)\n\nL.T.D.

A brief history of FM radio and how A&M responds to it in 1978.\n\nTotoian Speech 1978\n\nIn January, A&M launched its Management Information Services department under Bob Housman. With six employees, it collected and reported management information, demographics, and sales by format, market, account, distributor airplay history, accounts reporting to music magazines, ad levels in each market by account and media.\n\nOn January 1, A&M opened a south-central marketing region in Dallas, TX. This was A&M's fifth region. It was staffed with a regional marketing director, promotion director, and merchandising director.\n\nA&M Pacific launched in February with branches in San Francisco, Seattle, Denver and Phoenix plus employees in the Boston and Atlanta offices. This was the first in-house distribution effort moving away from independent distributors. The effort was short-lived because some of A&M's retail accounts were slow to pay and A&M had receivables issues with its independent distributors. The result was that A&M had a serious cash-flow problem.\n\nA&M established its first national director of black music marketing. Derry Johnson was the first person to hold the position. A&M also created a black music publicist position. In December, A&M held a \"Month in the Community\" campaign with posters, divider and bin cards specially designed for stores; print media, direct mailers and radio ads highlighting the growth of music in the black community.\n\nA&M was one of only two labels with a specialized college department. The college staff serviced about 450 radio stations and had an extensive concert committee mailing list. Bob Frymire was the director of the college division and commented on how important it was for the college department to lay the groundwork for new A&M artists.\n\nMajor artist developments included signing Joe Jackson in February. On March 22, 1978, Miles Copeland optioned the Police single Roxanne to A&M Records. In July, the band 1994 was signed.\n\nIn June Michael Leon moved from the New York office to Los Angeles to become Gil Friesen's executive assistant.\n\nA&M opened promotional offices in CBS Records facilities in the Netherlands and Germany. In October, Alfa Records began distribution in Japan, and A&M began to release Alfa recordings in the U.S..\n\nBillboard reported that A&M president Gil Friesen reaffirmed the label's artist oriented philosophy with the A&M staff saying he \"urged artists and managers to 'sit down with any major executive and openly discuss the marketing strategy behind any one of the albums in the A&M catalog.\" Friesen also told the staff his objective was a \"more directed marketing approach for all our music.\"\n\nIn July, A&M created a new position, senior vice president of promotion. Harold Childs who had been the VP for promotion was promoted into it. Gil Friesen said, \"Harold's contribution to A&M Records has been invaluable over the last 10 years. His ability to break records is unequaled in the business. Through his promotion staff, Harold Childs has been directly responsible for hiring many of our executives ranks and now hold key positions in the company.\"\n\nAlso in July, Ernie Campagna was promoted to vice president of sales; Bob Reitman became the vice president of advertising and merchandising, and Al Moinet was named the vice president of promotion. The label also created a vice president of special projects and assistant to the chairman that was filled by Andy Meyer. Jeff Ayeroff was appointed to the newly created vice president of creative services. Ken Powell became the vice president of business affairs.\n\nIn September, A&M Records entered the cutout market hoping to get products exposed that radio would not play. A&M was the last major label to enter the cutout market. It sold more than one million units were to Pickwick International.\n\nIn December, A&M released its third direct mail catalog with recordings to clothing. The catalog included coupons for placing orders.\n\nMeanwhile at Almo Music, the Almo Publications logo (jack-in-the-box style) was approved as a registered trademark on June 13 and the Almo Rapid Play logo approved as a registered trademark on July 18.\n\nSeptember 1 was the first commercial use of Horizon Records logo (3 sunrise style), and on September 12, the Horizon Records logo (script style) approved as registered trademark.\n\nThe label released three limited edition picture discs.

Rita Coolidge, Chuck Mangione and Styx were the leaders as each were awarded two gold records.\n\nA&M artists placed 22 singles and 22 albums on the Billboard Pop charts.

The deal also included concert tours. To comply with Yugoslav law, RTB could adapt cover art and titles.\n\nIn January, A&M released four albums with bar code pricing. The albums were No Mean City by Nazareth, Head East Live, The Best of Rick Roberts and Milton Nascimento's Journey Till Dawn. Kris and Rita's Natural Act which was released on January 12 was not bar coded.\n\nOn February 15, RCA began manufacturing and distributing A&M Records. Until then, Columbia Records manufactured 80 percent of A&M's albums and 100 percent of its tapes. Monarch Records manufactured the other 20 percent of albums. RCA was 3 cents to 4 cents cheaper for every album pressed than Columbia. Also, RCA advanced A&M money against the amounts owed by A&M's independent distributors. Due to the change in distributors, A&M held all of its January releases until February.\n\nThe label finished closing its in-house distribution, A&M Pacific in March. A&M was the largest and last label to stop using independent distributors, effective with the RCA deal. The deal was for the U.S. only. While distribution was no longer independent, A&M continued to operate as an independent label in all other aspects. RCA hired A&M's vice president of sales and distribution, Bob Fead, to be its vice president of sales and distribution overseeing the new RCA and A&M and Associated Labels. At A&M, Marv Bornstein was promoted to international vice president and director of quality control. This was an addition of duties for Bornstein who had directed quality control of records and tapes since 1969. He also worked with products mixed and mastered in A&M Studios.\n\nBy February, A&M had restructured the promotions department:\n\neast coast promotions director\n\nwest cast promotions director\n\neast coast AOR director\n\npromotion representatives in Boston, Washington, D.C., Buffalo, Southern Ohio, Seattle\n\nNew York disco/cabaret promotion coordinator and college director\n\nThe sales department was also reorganized. Under Ernie Campagna's direction, David Steffens became national director of sales for singles, albums and tapes and directed the regional sales staff. Bernie Grossman became director of national accounts. Robert Elliot became A&M's first director of sales research and communication. John Powell was promoted to national manager of retail promotion. Jayne Neches became the west coast regional marketing director. Z Zimmerman was named the special projects coordinator. The local retail staff were located in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh area; Minneapolis; Houston; Chicago; Buffalo; Baltimore/Washington.\n\nThere was a reorganization of field merchandising staff to specific cities rather than regions. A&M had offices in ten cities plus five regional promotion directors and regional sales managers.\n\nIn November, Michael Leon became the first vice president of east coast operations to coordinate A&R there. The importance of the New York office increased as disco and new wave music first took hold in New York and continued to have their greatest popularity there. With new wave, The Police's management worked with A&M on how to market new wave artists, including working with the small cult clubs where these bands played.\n\nAlso in November, Jolene Burton was named senior vice president. Ms. Burton was A&M's first employee. Said Jerry Moss, \"A&M has come a long way in our seventeen year history. I am sure this journey through time and space might not have taken place with as much reward or fun had it not been for Jolene Burton's strong contribution.\" Michael Parkson was appointed vice president of finance, following Burton's promotion.\n\nAgain in November, Jason McCloskey was appointed the director of international publicity/promotion and Mike Gormley was named assistant to the chairman Jerry Moss.\n\n1979 was a difficult year for the recording industry and for A&M Records. During the year, A&M let nearly 90 employees go because of its consolidation of operations and industry economics.\n\nOn January 1, PolyGram began representing A&M Records in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Korea. CBS was the representative in Israel.\n\nEffective August 3, the price of singles was raised to $1.49 and 12-inch singles to $4.98.\n\nIn May, Martin Kirkup was appointed to the new position of vice president for artist development. He had been the director of artist development.\n\nIn June, Jack Losmann was made the managing director of international to direct the operation, marketing and promotion of A&M product with 50 affiliates around the world plus artists' international tours. Losmann told Cash Box, \"Our marketing pushes are tailored to the artist and who he appeals to. We are careful to key in on specific territories for specific artists, matching th"
