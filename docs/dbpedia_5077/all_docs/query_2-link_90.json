        "text": "Music Business Essay\n\nBelow is my essay for the moduale Music Bussiness, taken in Semester 2 Year to for the course BA Popular Music…\n\nThe Current and Future Structure of the\n\nMusic Business\n\n“Popular Music is with us constantly, it is part of our everyday environment, and increasingly part of the aural or sonic soundscape that surrounds us.” (Burnett. R, 1996: P1). Here Burnett puts forward the idea of music being a form of global communication, available worldwide to be accessed anywhere by anyone at anytime. A person spends on average 5% of their life listening and registering Popular Music, owing thanks to certain advances in technology over the years. However, music is now at a point where it is a powerful expression of different cultures in society (1996), a mass of people yearning for a musical community, one populated with active listeners who seek out specific tastes in music to use within a certain context in their everyday lives. Listeners within society today can be considered active, meaning they use listening as a form of appreciation to develop their own personal tastes. With access to technologies such as; the internet, audiences can then seek out these desires and use them as a form of escapism to provide pleasure, or to use them in social context forming groups that are perhaps focused on a particular type of music (Bergh, A and DeNora, T: 2009). With music present all around us, being it on; radio, TV, or even our own personal devices, it is now a challenge for our society to become passive listeners, unable to attach meaning or context to music. The Music Industry is what is responsible for this society of active listeners, responsible for mass distribution of a record to all parts of the world; the main objective of the industry is; to exploit an artist’s work to ensure album sales. However, many may agree with Burnett when he explains in his book; The Global Jukebox that, “The music industry is nothing more than…an industry that makes money out of music.” An industry lead by business men with no desire for creativity, this may be the case with certain parts of the music business, however there is more to it than this which we will soon move on to.\n\nThe music business is said to be part of the entertainment industry along with; the film and gaming industry, and has been present in society since the late 1800s, where publishers held all the power in distributing printed sheet music. This can have its advantages as collaboration between certain aspects of the entertainment industry suddenly become available to companies, for instance; the music industry collaborating with the film industry to create soundtracks. Out of the three, sadly music business is the industry carrying the most risk as it is based on the foundations of success and failure with a complex history relating to both technological and social factors, as Keith Negus explains in his book Producing Pop: “…arrived at their current form as a result of a complex history of acquisitions and merges, technological changes, and booms and slumps connected to wider change in the world economy.”. This is down to many factors affecting both consumer and producer, for example; influences of consumption, the demand for different styles and tastes is constantly varying the audience and companies must adapt to their needs. Recently over the past decade the industry has found itself in a time of change one where digital distribution is now a major form communication to the audience and the industry must adapt. “The pure record store is almost extinct…not enough CD business left to support them” (Passman; P67), even with the rise of digital downloads it does not match that of the decline in CD sales. Most major retail stores such as; Tesco, have now reduced shelf space for CDs, while music stores also have to sell products from the rest of the entertainment industry, for instance HMV. The current structure of the music industry can be broken down into three sections each with their advantages and disadvantages to both artist and consumer, these are: the recording, the licensing, and the live sector. In its basic form the industry is focused on mass production of a record, and relies on a large network to create relationship between artists to company (Wikstrom, 2009).\n\nOn the recording side of the industry record labels play a large role in the exploitation of an artist’s work, these are companies that vary in size yet all rely on a vast network in areas of; production, promotion and finance to exploit the artists work. A record company is usually split into different sections each with a particular role in acquiring and developing artists, these include; A & R, marketing and promotion, production, and sales.\n\nIn the UK music industry there are two types of record labels each carrying pros and cons for its artists and consumers, these are called majors and independents. Major record labels are large companies, who often focus on other areas of the entertainment industry as well as music, they make use of large networks to distribute records through major distributors to maximise sells. “The recording industry has been dominated by a few major corporations which have increasingly developed connections with a wide range of related media and technology” (Negus, 1999). In 1988 six major labels dominated the music industry in record sales, these were know as “The Big 6”, over time these companies merged together leaving the industry with “The Big 4” ; Sony Music Entertainment, EMI Group, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group. As I previously mentioned, these companies are also involved in the production of devices that allow the playback of music, for example; Sony and the walkman. A major label can seem appealing to an artist, as they will receive the necessary funding to create their records, with advances ranging from: £50,000 to £15,000 for a new artist (Passman, 2011). Majors will use a large network of distributors which will ensure an artist’s music reaches all parts of the world, and with radio pluggers and a large team of marketing and promotion, the general public will soon know their image. Since the companies use major distributors, consumers find it easy to gain access to records, through either retail stores or digital downloads, however consumers over time will have an expectation of the quality of music provided by the labels that needs to be met. Once an artist has signed with a major label sadly it is not all as glamorous as once thought, as with any system the music industry does have its flaws. While an artist is given a large sum of money to create the record, that must first be recouped before money can be earned, this is taken out of royalties for the recording. A royalty is the money earned when a record is sold, how this is split between the artist and company can vary, however it is very different with majors and independents. When signed with a major the royalty is split between many departments that contributed towards producing the record, leaving the artist with very little money, however these earnings will soon add up if the record is successful on a worldwide scale. Compared with independent labels artists have often found a lack of creative freedom when producing songs as they have to meet the audiences needs and expectations, since the company is focused on exploiting the record not if it meets the needs of the artist desirers. This then leaves consumers with the issue that majors will only cater for certain types of music, such as; Pop, if an audience wishes to hear or purchase music of other genres then they will have to look elsewhere.\n\nThe independent labels are companies that are not owned by a major however some do make deals with major distribution companies to meet consumer demand; they normally have little staff with workers doubling up on departments where in a major a team of employees may perform that one job. In signing a deal with an independent, an artist will receive a smaller advance due to financial issues with the labels, therefore there is a risk of low quality recordings, and also distribution is often restricted to the home country unless the artist makes a deal with overseas labels. However, amidst these issues there are some benefits as independents often do a 50% split with the artist for royalties, but there is the chance the record will not sell as well due to this restriction in distribution. While the consumer suddenly finds themselves with a wide variety of music available to them, but sadly with the restriction of distribution the fan base may be unable to obtain the music, for instance: if a record was to be released in only Scandinavia and did not make it to the UK fan base, this then causes consumers to resort to other methods, such as; illegal downloading. Although, the artist does receive more creative freedom is signing with a label that cares about the music rather than merely the amount of revenue, and they will tend to make most of their money through the live sector of the industry.\n\nWhen a record label takes on an artist they will offer them a deal which will entitle the label to make profits off the artist’s songs when they sign the ownership across, or when the song is licensed. With the decline in CD sales the industry is now looking to the immaterial aspects of the business such as a songs copyright, “A considerable part of the turnover of the music industry is now being derived from the exchange of immaterial items.” (Negus, 1999: Pg 12). The types of deals offered to artists vary weather they are with a major or an independent; however it is important to note that only 5% of artists signed to majors are successful. Before the label makes the move to offer a deal it must first consider; what type of deal the artist should be offered dependent on their potential, what type of act are they, and the costs of production and promotion. Currently in the music business, companies are witnessing the fall of CD sales and a rise in merchandise and the live sector section of the industry. In response to this labels are now offering a new type of deal known as the 360o deal, where companies now want a share of everything from: songs, touring, to merchandise. This has been done to allow labels to make a bigger profit off their artists, “These deals started because the record industry was in such financial distress that the companies couldn’t survive on their business alone.” (Passman, 2011: pg 102). This affects the artist in a negative way as they are losing part of their income however they may be able to recover around 25% of these costs, most companies will tend to get around 10% to 35% of an artist’s income through this deal, Passman describes this type of deal as “Passive Interest” (2011).\n\nMoving away from the production side of a record, I will now briefly discuss the licensing side of the industry where money is made through the ownership of copyright. Ever since music publishers began to sell the first pieces of sheet music in the late 1800s they have now developed to a point where they exploit the work of unknown song writers to consumers by selling songs. “Music Publishers perform a role for the composer comparable to that which the record companies perform for the recording artist.” (The Supply of Recorded Music, 1994). Publishers are ideal for songwriters who are after money without the hassle of fame and touring, a publisher will take a song that a songwriter has produced and licence them to other companies for use giving the songwriter a share in the profits which is usually around 50%, this known as “The Publishers Rights” (Passman, 2011). This is where the songwriter will benefit in the music business as they will receive revenue from the copyright each time the record is played through other organisations, for instance: radio, TV, these are known as; performing, mechanical, and public performance rights. In the modern world most songwriters will need a publisher in order to expose their work however it is in the company’s interest as well to exploit the track to gain maximum revenue, this is a deal that please most artists (Passman, 2011).\n\nMarketing and Promotion are a key part in the music industry in persuading consumers that these records are right for them, it also aids towards the live sector. The objective of marketing is to find the best way in selling the maximum amount of records to the public, being a musician is not just about selling songs it is also partly to do with manipulating media in a way which makes your music seem appealing. “What we hear as authentic is already determined by the technological and economic conditions of its production.” (Frith, 1988: pg 72), Frith explains here that authenticity is something that has been put in place by the marketing system where certain codes are to be followed which ultimately creates the illusion to the consumer. The result of marketing is best seen through the live sector, where similar groups of people will show up to gigs, for instance: metal. Since CD sales are declining the live sector in the industry is taking over in acquiring revenue through merchandising and ticket sales. An artist can bring in a reasonable income from live shows especially tours, where they will earn money from each time they play at a public venue as well as additional sales. Tour merchandising often sells more than retail sales mainly due to the behaviour of the consumer at that time as impulse takes over: “While retail merchandising may be more visible, it doesn’t create the same sales frenzy as concerts do.” (Passman, 2011, pg:403).\n\nSince we entered the 21st century, the music industry has found itself in a period of transition, one which it is not as reluctant to accept compared to other periods. These periods pass through WWI through to the 1970s, from this the industry has learned that a main contributing factor to change that the music industry has always had to face is that of new developments in technology (Burnett).\n\nOver the past decade the internet has become a major source of distribution and exploitation for artists and labels, a resource such as this allows anyone in the world to access music from their own home at any point during the day, however some might argue that the rise of the digital file has de-valued music to a point where it is not even a physical item. CD sales have been declining rapidly whilst digital sales are growing, however it does not seem this will counteract the loss in revenue (Freeloaders, 2010). Sites are available for artists to upload their music to stream or sell, whilst they can also create their own fan pages using social networks, for instance: iTunes, Spotify, Soundcloud and Facebook. With Mp3 files now replacing the old format of the CD, consumers have found that they can easily be copied due to the small size of the file, although they are of a lower quality which in turn means the initial production costs will have been reduced (Freeloaders, 2010). This is a disadvantage to both artist and consumer as each now has a recording which does not match audience expectation, although a WAV file is available. The record industry does however face an issue with this advance in technology as music piracy has slowly made its way into this distribution system. Illegal downloads are effortless to access and can seem appealing to consumers when no money is involved, however I believe the main reason for illegal downloading is due to the lack of access to the original file, or other influential factors such as; the recession. With the rise of Apple’s iTunes records are now available all on one programme, with a small fee placed on each track or album, this is appealing to both sides of the industry as artists may receive more royalties, whilst consumers can have access to any music they desire instantly. Illegal downloads through P2P file-sharing do still exist even with the recent developments in streaming and online stores, although some researchers believe that it has very little if not no effect in the decline in CD sales, and I quote the researchers of Harvard University: “statistically indistinguishable from zero”. The next generation of distribution will most likely be digital with very few physical sales, such as merchandise, however record companies and the industry must first stop fearing this new technology and embrace it. Passman has a theory of how the industry reacts when it encounters new technology; he believes that the industry follows a predictable pattern where the initial thought is panic as companies are unable to work out finance side. The technology will then pass through a period where it is expensive due to the small market behind it, through to the industry constructing a pattern for royalty rates (2011). I believe this will soon be the same with online stores and streaming sites.\n\nA final point on technologies influence on the industry is the recent developments in equipment used to produce the initial recording; microphones are constantly improving offering a clearer sound on the basic recording. With a range of programmes now also available offered by Apple, such as; Pro Tools and Logic, artists are now in position where a studio is not needed and they are able to produce decent quality tracks by themselves in their bedrooms. This has led to the DIY or “Do It Yourself” side of the industry where artists leave out the middle man record label to produce tracks themselves using industry standard equipment, while they can use the internet for the marketing and promotion side. Most songwriters tend to use this method where they would produce a song to then sell on to a publishing company who would exploit the record; either way artists now have all they need to produce a record themselves. However with the amount of music suddenly available from endless amounts of resources, who really controls the media on this vast distribution system, artists or labels? Consumers may face the issue now of having too much music to choose from, music that is de-valued to a point where it is given away for free through streaming and file-sharing.\n\nAs I have mentioned before the UK music industry is now left with four major record labels entitled “The Big 4”, these play a large role in the industry to provide consumers with records, as well as developing and creating artists. However from a songwriter’s point of view there are other organisations which are more beneficial to them on the finance side of the industry. Working alongside publishing companies, collection agencies devote their time and effort to retrieve royalties from public venues where an artist’s song has been either performed or used. The Performance Rights Society, or PRS, is a main UK collection agency, one which is a non-profitable organisation where songwriters can upload their records as well as publishers. Each time these records are then used in a public place, be it on; radio, TV, or in public venues, a royalty is paid to the artist and the publisher, “PRS for Music offers a combined mechanical/performance license.” (Passman, 2011: Pg 269). Artists are now in a place where they can earn money from not only selling records but by having radio play and online streaming, however this does not work as well for record labels as they tend not to see any of this money despite the fact they may have helped develop the artist. As well as PRS the Phonographic Performance Ltd organisation (PPL) aids in the collection of costs for the public performance of a record. Usually 50% of PPL’s income goes to the companies and artists which has been derived from logs kept by broadcasters and venue samples, these royalties are then given to the artist once a year. Working alongside PPL is Video Performance Ltd, or VPL, who specialise in the collection of money for artists and songwriters whose work appears on; TV or in films. With all these collection agencies suddenly things are looking good for the artist and publishing company who are now able to obtain more royalties, however the system does have its flaws especially with small artists in that the amount of data the agencies receive can overwhelm them, therefore artists may have to consider collecting evidence themselves. I believe that the industry may see a merge with UK collection agencies since they are already engaged in collaboration with each other. The three agencies would now be under one organisation name where artists can collect their royalties from; performances, and use of the record in public places, using their own log books.\n\nWe have looked at the benefits for the artist with these organisations but how about the consumer? With the introduction of the internet, the barrier between artist and fan has now been broken with direct contact through websites, now audiences are able to follow them and keep up to date on all the latest news and shows around the world. Even with small local artists social networking sites have played a huge role in connecting the two sides together, even with the expected shut down of Myspace, Facebook enables bands to create fan pages as does Twitter. However the most important organisations are the distribution sites of iTunes and the recent edition; Spotify, where audiences are able to access and listen to music for a small fee, a fee which with the help of collection agencies will reach the artist and supporting company. These types of organisations aid the industry in the area of marketing and promotion, using popular distribution sites to help keep the success of the live sector moving forward. Apple, over the past decade, has been fighting the frontlines of the music business with its constant developments in technology. Breakthroughs in software developments for Macs offer artists higher quality records, and consumers can benefit from the creation of the iPod, a device which has changed the way society consumes music to make it a part of our everyday lives. However the industry does have mixed views about the organisation, as it is the only current successful marketing model giving the company a lot of power which parts of the industry may not trust (iTunes inspires…2006).\n\nThe music industry is in a constant state on change mainly due to social factors and the development of technologies, however with the introduction of the internet as a major form of distribution the industry “this is a leap into the unknown” (Major to Minor, 2008). No one knows for certain what the future holds for the music industry with the revolution of interactive multimedia resources, consumers are now at a point where they can share files with each other essentially de-valuing a record to a point where companies may just use it as a promotional tool to increase awareness within the live sector and other successful parts of the industry such as; merchandising. Steve Purdham predicts that within the next 10 years online music will change dramatically with streaming sites seeing an increase in popularity, record companies will have to embrace this marketing tool. If this were to happen record producers will end up making money from licensing and performances of their artists through the 360o deal, rather than record sales. I believe that streaming will become a dominate form of accessing music; however the sites will eventually be merged together into one portal essentially benefiting the consumer, similar to iTunes with digital downloads. If this is the case record labels will continue to fight for control over this distribution system to ensure an income for themselves and their artists, as they have done since the introduction of this technology, as Negus explains in his book Producing Pop; “the owners of record companies therefore sought to organise and exert control over the technologies of sound production and those of its consumption.” (1999, Pg: 23). This brings me to my next point where Purdham also predicts there will be further developments in the technologies of physical consumption with mobile phones being a primary listening device. If this is to be the cause then “The Big 4” may continue to merge as they have done in the past to gain control over these technologies (Negus, 1999).\n\nMuch of what lies ahead for the UK music industry currently seems to be resting on the fate of the internet; this is a risk for the simple reason that the internet is still an emerging market one which does not have a fixed marketing system (Easley, 2005). Music piracy will no doubt still be present in ten years time, the music industry is going to have to stop fighting this fact and embrace it to benefit them and the business as a whole; “For several years now the recording industry has been battling music piracy…This may be holding back the evolution of the music industry towards an ultimately beneficial embrace of the possibilities inherent in electronic distribution of music.” (2005).\n\nThe recording industry has and will always be a risky business, due to the consumers tastes and change in what is commercially successful, the industry has more failures than successes and must learn to develop marketing strategies to ensure their ultimate goal to maximise album sales is met (Negus, 1999). We are now a society connected as a whole, an audience with a desire for music because of this connection one which drives and fulfils our needs as consumers. What is certain in determining the fate of the UK music industry is: “The music business may well never be the same.” (Burnett, pg: 146). No matter what the future holds for the industry it will always be on the lookout for the next big thing as well as ways to sell this across to its customers.\n\nBibliography\n\nBurnett, R., 1996.
