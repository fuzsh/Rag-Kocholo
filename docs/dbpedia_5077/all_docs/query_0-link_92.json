        "text": "[LEWITT] But you’re also using the DGT 650?\n\n[Ron Robinson] Yeah, the DGT 650 is very cool. Out of all the mics we’ve been using, that one may get the most use. Nowadays, you know, everyone is kind of recording things on the fly with laptops. These producers come in, and we’ve got this big studio with an API console and racks and outboard gear, giant speakers and great interfaces – just all this stuff that sounds amazing. And they come in with their laptops and just plug into the speakers and go, and they’re looking for something simple and quick. Quite often, that ends up being something they’re using in their home studio setups, and that’s frequently a USB mic, where you can just plug it into the computer and go. We’ve found the DGT 650 to be pretty awesome, with the two different low-cut filter settings at 80 Hz and at 160 Hz plus the 96 kHz sample rate, and its zero-latency direct and playback monitoring is pretty handy, too, especially when you’re running stuff with a lot of CPU load on your laptop. It’s just plug and play, and you’ve also got that awesome breakout box … it kind of just works for whoever comes through. And whatever setup they have, it always seems to be a great solution. People have been blown away by its sound. Normally, I wouldn’t think that a USB mic could sound that great, but it really does sound incredible! We’ve even tracked some guitars and stuff that were meant for demo reference tracks but eventually found their way onto the actual recordings because there was just no reason to recut it.\n\nThen there’s the fact that it’s got that stereo setting where you can have two mics in one on the fly, and you get that nice, wide acoustic image of the guitar. Like I said, the way people are doing these sessions nowadays, with everything on the go … like when they need to borrow something when they go over to the hotel where the artists are staying because they want to work on something. Or if some of the folks here are working on podcasts, where they’ve got some DJs in and they want to do interviews. This mic is just always ready to go and sounds amazing. Everyone can figure out how to use it in a matter of seconds, since you just have to plug it into your laptop and it pops right up in Logic or ProTools or whatever. So it’s been a very amazing tool in our toolbox here.\n\n[LEWITT] Are there any final things you’d like to say about LEWITT microphones?\n\nI just think people kind of get hung up on the microphone issue, like this argument for cool vintage gear and $20,000 microphones like the C12 or the U47. The truth of the matter is that none of these microphones sound the same: you know, over the course of time the sound changes as their capsules deteriorate or the tubes start to go bad. And the one thing you really need nowadays – especially with these sessions happening so quickly and everywhere – is something you know you can plug in that’s gonna sound amazing, that’s gonna be consistent, that’s gonna be low-noise and where, at the end of the day, everyone smiles and says it sounds great. And the one thing we find with the LEWITT mics is that they’re super consistent and they sound fantastic. So to me, a LEWITT is something that everyone should consider, especially producers who work on the go. You’re really not going to find a much better microphone – for me, it’s just a winner."
