The one-of-a-kind event brings Nashville songwriters together with top winemakers for an intimate evening of entertainment and wine tasting. Guests enjoyed live music and fine wine presented directly by those who hold the stories of their creation – the winemakers and songwriters – in an intimate writers round and chef-hosted dinner on the grounds and in the wine caves of the Baldacci Family Vineyards.\n\nDavid Lee Murphy, Don Schlitz, Jonathan Singleton, Travis Hill, and Striking Matches’ Justin Davis and Sarah Zimmerman performed their tunes for the crowd among the gorgeous Napa backdrop as guests enjoyed vintages from the Baldacci and Trespass vineyards, as well as the Hope and Grace, Mi Sueno, Aonair, Chimney Rock, and Date Night wineries. An additional NOTES for Education fundraising event was held on Aug. 1 at Vintners Collective in downtown Napa featuring Striking Matches.\n\nHosted and sponsored by Baldacci Family Vineyards, SunTrust Bank, Palantir Technologies, Dunlop and more, “Nashville in Napa” benefits music education in Napa Valley and Nashville. NOTES for Education funds programs that bring music, art and literacy to school-age children. The organization was founded when Frank Rogers (producer/songwriter, co-owner of Sea Gayle Music Publishing) and Debi Cali (Baldacci Family Vineyards General Manager) began to see the similarities between their industries, since often the names of the songwriters or winemakers are unknown, and only the products of their passion receive public recognition. With the intention of highlighting the process of collaboration required within these industries, NOTES was formed to support arts education for today’s youth and to continue to develop the artists of tomorrow.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/10184803/nashville-in-napa2222.jpg 398 570 Lorie Hollabaugh https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Lorie Hollabaugh2013-08-09 11:39:312013-08-09 11:39:31ASCAP Brings Nashville To Napa For Fifth Straight Year\n\nCharlie Cook On Air: The Boomerang Generation\n\n/\n\nSome interesting demographic information was presented late last month to TV executives, and it has a considerable effect on radio.\n\nThe 18-49 demographic is a smaller percentage of the overall population in numbers. This according to research presented recently by CBS-TV researcher David F. Poltrack, in defense of CBS television having the oldest median viewer, 56.1 years. People 18-49 make up only 55 percent of all adults. A decade ago this number was 62 percent.\n\nThe number that stunned me was 82 percent of 18-24-year-olds live in someone else’s home. Most likely their parents. From someone who left home at 18 and never went back, this percentage surprises me but this number is really scary. Fifty-six percent of those 25-34 years old are in a similar situation.\n\nI am from the baby boomer generation. The 25-34 year olds are being referred to as boomerangs. They just keep coming back. I know this is an impact from the economics of today’s workplace. I don’t mean to joke about this situation. I am sure a 32-year-old male is not happy to be living back with his parents. In many cases he may have brought along a family.\n\nHow does this impact radio? Well in PPM households it is all in or none in. So now a household could now include ages 6-65. A child, her parents and grandparents. If you don’t think this happens often, look around. Fifty-six percent of 25-34 year olds are not living in their own domicile. That is a big number.\n\nI would also suggest you think about how many radios are in homes today. In the good old days, there was a radio in every room and the listener would follow the morning show through their routine. From the bedroom, to the bathroom to the kitchen and then to the car. Do you think this is today’s routine? Add the fact that there are a number of tastes being represented in the average household today and the one thing they do agree on is Good Morning America in the living area.\n\nWith the recent death of Kidd Kraddick, the impact a really good radio personality can have on listeners came to everyone’s attention. Reading the posts and listening to KHKS-FM the first workday after his death proved a good radio personality can move the masses. Kidd was the kind of talent that would actually be able to appeal to the wide spectrum of ages in today’s household.\n\nCan your morning show? If the answer is no, it is not too late to make the changes necessary to do so. We talk about identifying your listener so the staff can focus on him/her. Maybe now we need to think about households and how we can provide a morning show so entertaining no one wants to make another choice. Content, content, content. Planning, planning, planning.\n\nI know the radio listener is going to make the overall choice of their favorite station based upon the music you play, but morning shows can make a difference no matter the format. Growing up, I did not have a choice of which station to listen to if my father was around. He chose the station. Listening to the morning show on WXYZ as a kid, playing music I could not stand still led me to my career. The morning disc jockey was funny, warm and he knew the city of Detroit like the back of his hand.\n\nA morning show can make that kind of difference in a household, but it takes real effort directed at every demo in the house every day.\n\n(The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of MusicRow.)\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/10190035/CCook-onair-39021.jpg 260 390 contributor https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png contributor2013-08-09 10:08:392013-08-09 10:08:39Charlie Cook On Air: The Boomerang Generation\n\nExclusive: CEO Gary Overton Breaks Down Sony Partnership With Quu\n\n/\n\nSony Music Nashville announced earlier this week (Aug. 6) it has entered into a first-of-its-kind partnership with Seattle-based media technology company Quu Interactive. The platform allows a fully interactive and customized medium across computers, mobile devices, and, for the first time, within vehicles.\n\nMusicRow discusses this new venture with Gary Overton, Chairman and CEO of Sony Music Nashville, revealing how this platform offers new promotional opportunities for the artists and the label and how this partnership will enhance its marketing efforts to the listener.\n\nMR: How did the idea for joining with Quu come about?\n\nOverton: We are always looking for innovative ideas that connect our artists with the consumer. Quu provided a real opportunity to try something that has not been done before on the label side. We spent a lot of time with them so we could understand how their new technology could be used and the possible benefits to Sony and our artists.\n\nMR: Can you explain Quu’s Liner Notes Network and how that will work with your artists?\n\nOverton: Quu will push relevant, geo-targeted info-bites on the artist whose song is currently playing—such as the artist is performing on tour in your area next week, or their new single is now available for purchase. The goal is to provide an added value and opportunity for both our artists and their fans in a way that made sense. If someone is listening to Carrie Underwood on the radio, we can now let that listener know to tune in to see her co-hosting Good Morning America or that her new live concert DVD is available Aug. 13.\n\nMR: Quu covers several platforms. Is Radio the focus in this partnership?\n\nOverton: One of the unique aspects of Quu’s technology is that it instantly syncs the artist message across radio station websites and mobile applications in addition to radio. We can brand the station websites to our artists and show the same artist-focused message, all tied to radio airplay.\n\nMR: Other than concerts and release dates, what other messages do you see this platform being used for?\n\nOverton: Quu is unique because its gives the ability to offer a message at the right moment. If someone is listening to Brad Paisley on the radio, they’ve already chosen Brad. They want to listen to him, or they would have changed the dial. This gives us an opportunity to say, great, you like Brad Paisley, let us tell you more about him and where to see and hear from him next–on TV, in concert, and through retail. It’s really about being in the right environment to deliver that message. Other messaging could include artist centric contests, breaking news about the artist, artist’s sponsorship partners, media appearance tune-ins, and messages from the artists themselves and from their social media feeds.\n\nMR: How will you evaluate this platform’s success in reaching your targeted listeners?\n\nOverton: Partnering was the first step. This is uncharted real estate and something that hasn’t been done before, so getting in front of it was the first successful step.\n\nMR: Will it roll out for all Sony Nashville artists on your roster or select artists?\n\nOverton: We are rolling out messages for our artists and will eventually cover our entire roster. Currently there are already messages running for several artists, including Carrie Underwood and Kenny Chesney.\n\nMR: How do you foresee this affecting the marketing and publicity plans for artists?\n\nOverton: It is a great opportunity for true synergy of our marketing and radio promotion departments in building our artists and their brand.\n\nMR: Do you expect other labels to jump on board?\n\nOverton: Absolutely! It is not proprietary to Sony. The artist message is linked to the artist’s song. That message is also synched so the car display, station website and mobile app are all consistent. I view this as a beneficial partnership and opportunity for other labels and station groups at Country radio.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/10184805/garyoverton2.jpg 260 390 Sherod Robertson https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Sherod Robertson2013-08-09 09:31:432013-08-09 09:31:43Exclusive: CEO Gary Overton Breaks Down Sony Partnership With Quu\n\nWeekly Chart Report (8/9/13)\n\n/\n\nSPIN ZONE\n\nFlorida Georgia Line’s “Round Here” continues to entice listeners, holding the No. 1 spot on MusicRow’s chart with 3261 spins for two consecutive weeks.

He was 81 and died peacefully in spite of a long struggle with Parkinson’s disease, according to the Houstonpress.com.\n\nIn the mid-’70s, Don was credited as producer on three singles by George Strait for D Records, the label owned by Don’s father, H.W. “Pappy” Daily. Twenty years later, the singles were re-released on the 1996 set Strait Out of the Box.\n\nDaily’s father built a company that eventually included nearly every aspect of the music business in Southeast Texas: retail, management, record labels, publishing, distribution and even performance – family member Mike Daily is an original member of Strait’s Ace In the Hole Band.\n\nDaily Sr.’s label Starday Records had a string of hits including George Jones‘ “White Lightnin” and the Big Bopper‘s “Chantilly Lace.” Don and his brother Bud later opened Cactus Records in 1975.\n\nCurrent Cactus Music partner and general manager Quinn Bishop describes Daily as “proud, but very unassuming about the Dailys’ contribution to [Houston’s] musical heritage.\n\n“Don kept a hardback book on his desk that was embossed with “Everything I Know About the Music Business” with his name listed as the author,” he adds. “There was nothing written on the pages. He would always crack a smile when someone would pick it up and flip through the pages, not sure what to make of it.”\n\nDaily was a widower who had been married to his late wife Helen for 35 years. He is survived by five children, several grandchildren and numerous other relatives. His memorial service was held Wednesday (Aug. 7) in Houston.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/10184812/don-daily0806.jpg 199 208 Lorie Hollabaugh https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Lorie Hollabaugh2013-08-09 09:11:382013-08-09 09:11:38Houston Music Exec Don Daily Dies at 81\n\nLoretta Lynn to Receive Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\n/\n\nLoretta Lynn is one of 16 recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.
