        "text": "You might recognize the guitar riff that provides the chorus melody for Beyoncé’s “6 Inch.” Or perhaps you’re familiar with the creeping bass line that drives the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Warning” — it rolls out of speakers like a storm cloud, maybe, or a tank. If not, you’ve surely heard one of the other 89 songs that sample Isaac Hayes’s 12-minute version of Burt Bacharach’s “Walk on By.”\n\nThe music that Hayes recorded from 1969 through 1971 has since supplied the hooks, beats and textures for more than 500 songs by other artists. When Hayes died in 2008, however, the proto-disco “Theme From ‘Shaft’” and his voice performance as the character of Chef on “South Park” crowded his extraordinary legacy out of obituary headlines. A recent boxed set, “The Spirit of Memphis (1962-1976),” not only gives an overview of the most fertile years of Hayes’s career, but also shines a light on the versatile musicians who consistently backed him: One of the four discs is entirely dedicated to spotlighting the band’s interplay."
