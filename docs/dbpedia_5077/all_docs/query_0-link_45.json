        "text": "Joyner Lucas has expressed frustration with his former label Atlantic Records, saying he felt “scammed” after he was promised collaborations with big-name artists like Cardi B.\n\nIn an interview on Math Hoffa’s My Expert Opinion podcast, the ADHD MC reflected on his experience as a major label artist and explained how it didn’t work out for him.\n\nDescribing the disingenuous process of major labels courting new talent, he said: “They find an artist. They do a little research. They’ll have the artist come in. Everybody at the table will make it seem like they’ve been rocking with this artist for so long. Everybody’s in on this cruel, fucked up scam.”\n\nHe later recalled his own experience visiting Atlantic Records’ offices where he said the label’s staff convinced him that they were committed to making him a star.\n\n“Here’s the sham: I’m like, ‘Am I gonna get to work with Bruno [Mars]?’ [They’re like], ‘Of course!'” he remembered. “‘What about Cardi?’ ‘Anything you want!’\n\n“Then they walk you through the fucking building, they got all these n-ggas on fucking big ass pictures. It’s like a museum. You see all the hottest, popping artists.\n\n“And then when you’re walking down that hall, at the end they got a picture of you. And they say, ‘Look, this could be you right here. All we missing is you! … That’s Ed Sheeran, right next to you. You want to work with Ed Sheeran?’ I’m like, ‘I do want to work with Ed Sheeran.'”\n\nHe concluded: “It’s a big sham, n-gga … As soon as you leave, everyone’s like, ‘[laughing] we got them n-ggas!'”\n\nJoyner Lucas signed to Atlantic Records in 2016 after building a buzz independently but didn’t release an album on the label.\n\nHe left the label two years later, describing his departure as amicable while stating his desire to be “100 percent independent.”\n\nHe later released his debut album ADHD through his own Twenty Nine Music Group imprint, with the project cracking the top 10 of the Billboard 200.\n\nThough Lucas feels aggrieved by the major label system, he is still a fan of some of the stars it has produced.\n\nLast month, the Massachusetts native celebrated getting Rihanna‘s autograph after meeting her at a party.\n\nFilming the encounter on Instagram, Joyner could be seen sitting opposite RiRi on a long table at a charity event hosted by Hollywood Unlocked’s Jason Lee.\n\nJoyner, who was sat next to Paris Hilton and his once-promised collaborator Cardi B, asked the Bajan beauty to sign what appeared to be a program with her face on it, and she duly obliged.\n\nBefore she signed it, Rihanna said to Joyner: “You’re the real deal, y’all.”\n\nThe rapper then showed a close up of the autograph which read: “To my boy Joyner.” He then excitedly said: “Let’s go,” as he revealed how happy he was to get the signature."
