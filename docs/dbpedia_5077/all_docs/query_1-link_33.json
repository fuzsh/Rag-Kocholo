        "text": "There was a time where there was nothing like the feeling of walking into your local Tower Records or Sam Goody and heading straight for the new releases section. The sight of racks of CDs lined up in endless rows of musical discovery offered the thrill of not knowing exactly what you were going to get. In the ’90s, it was likely that you had only heard one or two songs from an album, on the radio or MTV, before you forked over your hard-earned $20. Here are 150 albums that were more than worth it at the time, and that shaped the way music would sound in the decades to come.\n\nRead Pitchfork’s list of the best songs of the 1990s here, and check out our full ’90s package here.\n\nFor more about how we put together this list, read this letter from our editor-in-chief Puja Patel.\n\nOur 2003 list of the best ’90s albums can be found here. Our 2010 list of the best ’90s songs can be found here.\n\n(All releases featured here are independently selected by our editors. When you buy something through our retail links, however, Pitchfork may earn an affiliate commission.)\n\n150.\n\nSalt-N-Pepa: Very Necessary (1993)\n\nSalt-N-Pepa were a rebuke to the music industry’s storied disdain for women rappers, having gone platinum on their first two records; by their fourth album Very Necessary, which quickly went multi-platinum, the trio could not be denied. They didn’t change up their raison d’etre: Salt, Pepa, and Spinderella were still committed to women determining their own futures and calling out creepers and weirdos. But in the wake of the so-called “Year of the Woman,” their career-long pop sensibilities congealed in the hits “Shoop” and the En Vogue-featuring “Whatta Man,” positive anthems that remain stalwart in the wedding and auntie playlists. More than that, though, hip-hop was beginning to thaw to the idea of incorporating R&B and pop: Puff had convened Bad Boy Records in 1993, and genre-shifting cuts like Method Man and Mary J. Blige’s “I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By” weren’t far away.

Beginning with an incendiary opener—“Admit it! Innocent little girls turn you on, don’t they”—Bratmobile burn all the walls down. “Cool Schmool” uses sing-songy sugar to taunt pretentious scene politics, while the blistering “P.R.D.C.T.” depicts the correlation between male-ego idolization and sexual violence: “You’re my punk rock dream come true/I would die to stay with you.” Over the course of 16 tracks in just 28 minutes, Bratmobile established themselves as a revolutionary force. –Quinn Moreland\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n148.\n\nSoundgarden: Superunknown (1994)\n\nOn Superunknown, Soundgarden mixed some pop vulnerability into their Zep-influenced hard rock and broke into the mainstream. The album often gets grouped in with grunge—overdriven guitars abound, and yes, Soundgarden are from Seattle—but its pummeling riffs and Chris Cornell’s one-of-a-kind wail transcended the genre’s power chords and raspy sneering. The anthemic melodies are juxtaposed with bleak themes of death, despondence, and apocalypse that feel even more devastating following Cornell’s 2017 suicide. The album remains an alt-rock anomaly, thundering and openhearted in equal measure. –Max Freedman\n\nFurther Reading: Superunknown Reissue Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n147.\n\nWhitney Houston: The Bodyguard (1992)\n\nThe interracial romance-thriller The Bodyguard, starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, was the 13th biggest movie of 1992—a feat that had more than a little to do with the film’s soundtrack, which featured Houston delivering six superbly written and produced tracks at the pristine peak of her vocal superpowers. First, there’s the covers, including her ebullient remake of Chaka Khan’s “I’m Every Woman,” and her bold reconstruction of Dolly Parton’s sentimental country-weeper “I Will Always Love You,” which spent a record 14 weeks atop the Hot 100 en route to becoming one of the most beloved and hated songs ever, depending on your taste for pop schmaltz. Not to be overlooked are the album’s original torch songs, “I Have Nothing” and “Run to You,” performed by Houston with maximalist feeling and immaculate precision.\n\nThe Bodyguard became the highest-earning soundtrack of all time, surpassing Saturday Night Fever, and influencing generations of big-voiced divas like Christina Aguilera and Ariana Grande. It’s easy to forget that the album also contains six other worthwhile cuts by artists like Kenny G and Lisa Stansfield—we might consider them more if Whitney didn’t slay so hard. –Jason King\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n146.\n\nBoredoms: Super æ (1998)\n\nBoredoms started in 1986 as something like a noise band, and ended three decades later as something like a mountain. The Osaka collective’s fifth full-length comes the closest to encapsulating the entirety of their journey, with long passages of the ecstatic trance-rock that would characterize their later years, punctuated frequently with the cartoonish riffs and chaotic smash cuts that had been their specialty early on. At times, they sound like a hardcore band that never got the memo about brevity; at others, like a religious cult for whom the sound of a skipping CD is the embodiment of the divine. Two chords might repeat for 10 minutes, until that relatively small sliver of time feels like eternity. A crescendo might gain thrilling momentum only to slam abruptly into silence. Later Boredoms recordings and performances could resemble live-band DJ sets, with shards of noise and melody whirling around a single central pulse. On Super æ, they delighted in shaking listeners out of their flow states just as thoroughly as they did in drawing them in. These prankish interruptions and asides don’t take away from the music’s joyousness and near-mystical uplift; they enhance it. Meditation is one path to bliss. A good joke is another. –Andy Cush\n\nListen/Buy: Spotify | Tidal\n\n145.\n\nFugazi: Repeater (1990)\n\nTo save hardcore, Fugazi had to destroy it and build something new from what scraps could still be salvaged. By 1986, Minor Threat frontman Ian MacKaye was bored and frustrated with the violent, pig-headed masculinity prevalent in hardcore scenes across the country. He found kinship in the arty introspection of Rites of Spring, whose singer-guitarist Guy Picciotto and drummer Brendan Canty joined the fold of MacKaye’s next band. With these new members and bassist Joe Lally as collaborators, MacKaye paired slower and more rhythmically supple arrangements with an unrelenting commitment to his DIY, straight-edge values and the revolutionary spirit at the heart of the genre. After two tremendous EPs (later compiled on 13 Songs), 1990’s Repeater was the definitive moment when “post-hardcore” finally crystalized. Over lacerating chords and a deft use of space, the band took the many indignities of the Reagan-Bush era into their own hands—a sound, and a political worldview, that would reshape scenes overnight. –Rob Arcand\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n144.\n\nIris DeMent: Infamous Angel (1992)\n\nIris DeMent opened her first album with a meditation on what happens to a person in the afterlife; after wandering through some of the more popular theories, she reached a practical conclusion: “I think I’ll just let the mystery be.” “Let the Mystery Be” set the tone for 1992’s Infamous Angel, a staggering debut across which the Arkansas-born singer-songwriter reflected on mortality, faded hopes, and bygone affections. Her voice authenticated every bit of heartache she sifted through the rubble and found the bittersweet beauty therein: “Our Town” endures as an album standout for how succinctly DeMent captured the tragedy of American dreams drying up, but the raw pathos of “Mama’s Opry” and the sublime escapism of her take on “Fifty Miles of Elbow Room” are no less potent. –Allison Hussey\n\nFurther Reading: Infamous Angel Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n143.\n\nAimee Mann: Whatever (1993)\n\nThe start of the ’90s found Aimee Mann world-weary and jaded, put through the wringer of MTV stardom and what would become many years of label troubles. It’s no coincidence that Mann’s solo debut Whatever—recorded independently with producer Jon Brion after a three-year stand-off with Epic—encapsulated all the shades of meaning derived from the word it was named after. Marrying wry and melancholic narratives that grappled with disappointment and disillusionment—be it at the hand of labels or lovers—Whatever ran the gamut from caustic kiss-offs and stubborn determination to resigned sighs of defeat and shrugging indifference. It set the tone for the rest of Mann’s career, particularly as the decade would wear on, as an uncompromising songwriter with unparalleled gift for depicting the many different sighs of life. –Carrie Courogen\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n142.\n\nBoyz II Men: II (1994)\n\nThe first single from Philadelphia vocal harmony group Boyz II Men’s follow-up to their massively successful debut Cooleyhighharmony was titled “I’ll Make Love to You,” a wholesome anachronism at a time when every other R&B artist wanted to creep, freak, knock boots, rub it down, or sex you up. (Listening to the song now, with its gentle lyrics about respectful consent, it actually sounds strangely progressive.) An article about II in Entertainment Weekly was headlined “Revenge of the Nerds” and noted that they still lived with their parents. But these nerds met at performing arts school, and their studious attention to their craft shines across the album, particularly on their a cappella cover of the Beatles’ “Yesterday.” Uncool and out of step, II was a collection of lush crowd-pleasers that spoke to the silent majority of the record-buying public. Its influence endures across generations, passed down via family gatherings, proms, and weddings; these days, Boyz II Men count Tyler, the Creator, BTS, and Justin Bieber as their biggest fans and collaborators. –Jessica Suarez\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n141.\n\nSparklehorse: Good Morning Spider (1998)\n\nWhen Mark Linkous died for the first time, in a London hotel room in 1996, he was brought back to life by paramedics. Despite a challenging recovery, the Sparklehorse leader returned to music with a heightened awareness of the world around him. Fittingly, Good Morning Spider sounds like the album an alien might produce after getting a glimpse of life on Earth. These proudly eclectic songs are full of reverence for things we mostly take for granted: tiny creatures, overlooked moments, forces outside of our grasp. Musically, the album tends toward a natural state of entropy, veering from cowpunk to rural blues to dusty AM rock. (And when Linkous managed to pull off a radio-friendly pop song like “Happy Man,” he was sure to bury it under static.) Where his previous work seemed to quietly conjure the ghosts of his rural Virginia home, Good Morning Spider plays like a chaotic celebration of everything that’s outside and alive. –Mehan Jayasuriya\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n140.\n\nThree 6 Mafia: Mystic Stylez (1995)\n\nRecorded while holed up in North Memphis, Mystic Stylez is Three 6 Mafia’s horrorcore sound at its most skin-crawling. The songs feel like they’re never going to end—they’re unhurried and drawn-out, like the scene in a good slasher flick where the killer may or may not be about to strike. Moments as small as the pitched-down vocals on the opening of “Sweet Robbery” or the punishing drop on “Break Da Law ’95” hit you like a jump scare; Juicy J and DJ Paul’s beats are one-of-a-kind and truly cinematic, with brooding piano lines, tripped-out samples, and hi-hats that tick like a climbing heart rate. Collectively, their writing feels as if they’re all competing to rap the most shocking bar, and the nightmarish tone is emphasized by colorful and hyper-specific references to satan, coffins, and soul snatching. It’s not just a great album, but a dark text on how to push the limits in rap. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n139.\n\nToni Braxton: Toni Braxton (1993)\n\nIn the time of b-girls and baggy overalls, Toni Braxton emerged on the cover of her self-titled debut with a sultry but low-key sexiness—high-waisted jeans, a white tank, a leather jacket slung off her shoulders, an of-the-moment pixie cut and a red lip. Coming off the success of the Boomerang soundtrack, Braxton’s first album is a crooning, bluesy deep dive into the agony of heartbreak. Produced by the era-defining Babyface and L.A. Reid, along with famed producer and hit maker Daryl Simmons, Braxton’s alto is punctuated by the post-new jack sound yet still sounds like a throwback. The album put her on the map—she won three Grammys for it and spent weeks at the top of the charts—and has remained a staple, especially for the grown, sexy, self-aware of us who aspired to its posture. –Samhita Mukhopadhyay\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n138.\n\nAmerican Football: American Football (1999)\n\nBy the fall of 1999, the members of American Football were done with college, with emo, and with American Football itself. The trio had decided to break up even before the release of their first full-length; thus, the album turned out to be a farewell from a band that had scarcely introduced itself. American Football was also a rebuke of the Midwestern scene that had been shaped by the incalculable long-tail influence of Mike Kinsella’s previous one-album supernova Cap’n Jazz, rerouting emo’s bloodline from hardcore toward minimalist jazz and meditiative math-rock. It’s likely that no album on this list had less impact on the actual 1990s than American Football, but few loom larger right this moment; after the bursting of the Myspace bubble, hundreds of bands took Kinsella’s elliptical expressions of hope and heartbreak as unfinished business, rebuilding the genre on a foundation of open-tuned Telecasters, capos, and red and black flannels. Yet, while the sound of American Football is remarkably easy to replicate, its spirit of wistful carpe diem remains forever elusive. “You can’t miss what you forget,” Kinsella warns on “Never Meant,” if not the greatest emo song ever then the most potent expression of preemptive nostalgia in a genre that does it better than any other. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n137.\n\nBone Thugs-N-Harmony: E. 1999 Eternal (1995)\n\nBone Thugs-N-Harmony made absence and the afterlife a focal point of their music: Their second album, E. 1999 Eternal, was less about the hurdles they scaled to achieve success, and more about those who would not be around to toast with them. Each track hit like a message to the grim reaper: The album worked through the stages of grief for those whose lives move too fast to properly acknowledge pain, yet still need something like closure. It is darkly comedic, treating death like both an intruder and unavoidable foe. The 808s are somber and steady as a marching band, giving center stage to lines that act as both introduction and eulogy. A year after the album’s release, Tupac Shakur would be dead, and the Notorious B.I.G., shortly after—unquantifiable casualties that made it difficult for peers and fans to both grieve and remember. Coming from the only group to work with both of those artists, E. 1999 Eternal was a grim blueprint for moving forward while never losing sight of those not in the room. –Tarisai Ngangura\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n136.\n\nDepeche Mode: Violator (1990)\n\nWe are lucky to live in the musical world that Depeche Mode helped create with Violator, their celebrated album of synthy, sexy gloom. At this point, it’s mostly taken for granted that artists can crunch together pop, rock, dance, and electronic music into something capable of pleasing fans of each genre, or that deep, sensual darkness can writhe its way onto the radio—but it wasn’t always like this; there’s a line that runs straight from Martin Gore and Dave Gahan all the way on through to Finneas and Billie Eilish. “Personal Jesus” is so crisply produced that you’d think it was made yesterday, but it’s “Enjoy the Silence” that is the album’s best and most subtle moment, with a melancholy guitar line that still mystifies three decades years later. Violator sounded like the future when it arrived in 1990. Now, it sounds like everything. –Alex Frank\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n135.\n\nJeff Buckley: Grace (1994)\n\nIf all he ever gave us was “Hallelujah,” Jeff Buckley would still be hailed as a tremendously influential artist whose drowning death at 30 remains an unfathomable tragedy. Fortunately for everyone who skips that track at this point (guilty), there’s so much more to Grace than his cover of John Cale’s cover of Leonard Cohen’s most famous song. The son of a folk singer who also died way too young, Buckley drew from New York bohemia as well as from European chanson, from Patti Smith as well as from Edith Piaf, and that unusual set of influences—not to mention that voice—distinguished him then as now. Buckley savored the drama of unabashed beauty colliding with unrestrained noise: “So Real” erupts in orgasms of guitar distortion, quieted only by Buckley whispering, “I love you… but I’m afraid to love you.” It’s almost over-the-top, almost ridiculous, which makes its transcendence that much more impressive and daring. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n134.\n\nGillian Welch: Revival (1996)\n\nGillian Welch was in her late 20s when she issued her debut album, Revival, but she already sounded like a woman who’d lived through a few other lifetimes. Several years before she predicted the digitally induced collapse of the music industry, the singer-songwriter was writing tunes about lonesome left-behinds, heartaches that wouldn’t quit, and sweet little Appalachian flowers. With producer T Bone Burnett, Welch built songs that were spacious in their sentiments, spare in their melodies, and quietly puckish in their view of the world, as guitarist David Rawlings, a steadfast musical companion to Welch over subsequent years, backed her cool and easy voice with prickling steel-string licks. Revival was the first plank in the career of a generational voice, one whose work feels both timely and eternal in any decade. –Allison Hussey\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n133.\n\nJonathan Richman: I, Jonathan (1992)\n\nModern Lovers founder Jonathan Richman was 41 when he released this sunny solo record, but he looks half that, nearly teenaged, on the album’s cover. He sounds it, too. Richman’s lyrical concerns involve the magic of new love, the despair of a disagreement with a roommate, and the joy of losing oneself on the dancefloor in a lesbian bar. I, Jonathan marries the airtight pop construction of Brian Wilson to the crustpunk ethos of K Records as it narrates all the triumphs and tribulations of 20s adolescence. Timeless is the word. –Peyton Thomas\n\nFurther Reading: I, Jonathan Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n132.\n\nOval: 94 Diskont (1995)\n\nOval has always been a highly conceptual project, as central figure Markus Popp could spiel for hours about the standardization enforced by digital audio software. Attempting to subvert such strictures, the German trio turned digital dysfunction into raw material: Physically damaging actual compact discs, they took the gnarly weirdness that sputtered out of the CD player and tiled these sonic splinters into glittering mosaics. But it’s easy to divorce the polemical framing from the listening experience, and simply immerse yourself in Oval’s stream of strange beauty—particularly on 94 Diskont’s 24-minute standout, “Do While,” which resembles a My Bloody Valentine song shoved through a paper shredder and collaged into a shimmering abstract sound painting. 94 Diskont almost single-handedly inspired a wave of glitchy late-’90s electronica woven out of skips and clicks, ranging from Herbert’s twitchy but danceable grooves to punky noise-blasts like Lesser’s influence-exorcizing jibe, “Markus Popp Can Kiss My Redneck Ass.” Oval’s later releases grew conceptually top-heavy, but with 94 Diskont they created an ambient dreamscape as pretty and placid as it was disorienting and uncanny. –Simon Reynolds\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify\n\n131.\n\nPrefab Sprout: Jordan: The Comeback (1990)\n\nPaddy McAloon, the eccentrically ambitious frontman of Prefab Sprout, has a habit of self-mythologizing. Read enough interviews with him and you’ll start wondering if half the abandoned projects he mentions—say, a Christmas album called Total Snow or a movie musical written with Spike Lee—actually exist somewhere in the vaults or were just momentary bursts of inspiration tested out against some befuddled music journalist. The English band’s 1990 masterpiece, Jordan: The Comeback, however, makes you believe it’s all true. Somewhere in its 19-song sprawl—which spans bossa nova party-starters, tear-jerking R&B ballads, and arena rock anthems—there’s a narrative throughline about reincarnation, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and the imminent turn of the century, all delivered with enough gravitas for several Bible characters to make credible appearances. (“Hi, this is God, here,” goes a particularly memorable opening line.) It might all feel like a puzzle—something to be studied and worked over rather than celebrated—if it weren’t also filled with impeccable hooks and performances. Three decades later, the world finally seems to be catching up to its vision for cerebral, heartfelt pop. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n130.\n\nMaxwell: Maxwell’s Urban Hang Suite (1996)\n\nA song cycle that moves from a passionate fling to a breakup to a reunion and marriage proposal, Maxwell’s sumptuous debut album dilates one turbulent romance into a celebration of monogamous love and ’70s soul. To bring this retro vision to life, Maxwell enlisted accomplished collaborators like Sade saxophonist Stuart Matthewman and guitarist Wah Wah Watson, known for his work with Marvin Gaye and Herbie Hancock. But it’s ultimately Maxwell’s distinct voice as a singer, songwriter, and producer that powers these songs of courtship. His tender croon radiates vulnerability, his higher notes tinged with an anxious yearning. Marriage plots like this one are by definition conservative, but the rich details of Urban Hang Suite leave the door ajar for anyone who’s horny and lovestruck. –Stephen Kearse\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n129.\n\nTom Petty: Wildflowers (1994)\n\nAlready a household name long before the release of Wildflowers, Tom Petty didn’t need to go above and beyond his signature rich, driving rock’n’roll to ensure the album’s success. But Wildflowers stood out precisely because it pulled back some of that anthemic rock sound. With its stripped-down production, and spartan, honed lyrics, his second solo record was a turning point for the then-44-year-old rocker into a wiser era, strolling through folk, blues, and rock—including the self-pitier’s theme song “You Don’t Know How It Feels”—depending on how the spirit of the moment moved him. –Evie Nagy\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n128.\n\nDrexciya: Neptune’s Lair (1999)\n\nDetroit techno had always relished myths about the utopian promise of the information age, but no one took the epic, worldbuilding spirit of the genre further than Drexciya. From their first Deep Sea Dweller EP, James Stinson and Gerald Donald used the project as a vehicle for exploring the lingering traumas of the Black diaspora in the United States and beyond, creating an elaborate narrative of undersea people and nations rooted in the real history of the Middle Passage and Paul Gilroy’s concept of the Black Atlantic. The duo’s first album-oriented release, Neptune’s Lair draws the legend of Drexciya into a larger-than-life story, using wonky synths, electro drum patterns, and pitched-down vocal samples to describe Drexciya’s aquatic population and their quest to return to their homeland. Yet for all of the album’s sci-fi imagery, Stinson and Donald always resist the allure of true escapism, consistently asking how speculative fictions can challenge the presumed immutability of everyday life and contribute to a social world as rich and all-consuming as the collective fantasies they document. –Rob Arcand\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n127.\n\nSinéad O’Connor: I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got (1990)\n\nI Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got begins with a recitation of the Serenity Prayer and ends with the title track, an a cappella hymn of self-acceptance. In between, you’ll find the enormous range of the Irish singer-songwriter: a prophetic protest ballad (“Black Boys on Mopeds”), a 17th-century poem set to the “Funky Drummer” beat (“I Am Stretched on Your Grave”), a jaunty alt-pop us-against-them anthem (“The Emperor’s New Clothes”). And, of course, the massive hit “Nothing Compares 2 U,” originally written by Prince, but owned forever by Sinéad O’Connor. It’s a breakup song so devastating it would tower over everything else around it on a lesser album. Instead, it stands as just another skyscraper in a skyline of heartbreak. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n126.\n\nOl’ Dirty Bastard: Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version (1995)\n\nWhere Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) described a self-contained world—Staten Island as Shaolin, martial arts movies and local Five Percenters as the only moral guideposts—Ol’ Dirty Bastard embodied the bleed between that realm and our own. After all, the lead single from his solo debut is named after a whole other borough. A lesser version of ODB would scan as a raucous live act who couldn’t quite translate his shtick to record; the ODB we got was instead so radically unpredictable that any vocal take capturing his exuberance and idiosyncrasies became a perfect little time capsule, irreducible and irreproducible. Near Return to the 36 Chambers’ middle, a song is interrupted by ODB’s wife excoriating him over his litany of affairs. He responds by singing four lines of “Over the Rainbow” and then snapping upright into more conventional verse—where he describes his style as “evil, like a Wicked Witch.” –Paul A. Thompson\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n125.\n\nModest Mouse: The Lonesome Crowded West (1997)\n\nOn Modest Mouse’s second album, Isaac Brock stares down the open expanse of the American West and finds the placeless drudgery of urban sprawl where something like freedom used to be. The Lonesome Crowded West embodies the claustrophobia of late-’90s American cities—Brock’s guitars creak and squeal with a creeping unease, carving sharp edges into the melodies of “Heart Cooks Brain” and setting his caterwauling screams ablaze on “Shit Luck.” But that unsustainable mania gives way, more often than not, to quiet profundity: The clap-stomp folk-punk of “Cowboy Dan” melts into a meditation on being in nature and “thinking nothing,” before just as quickly returning to its defensive crouch. Brock has a knack for spinning the bleakness of late-stage capitalism into postmodern poetry, finding romance in trailer parks and truck stop bathrooms. The Lonesome Crowded West is a death rattle for the American dream, the kind of album that will feel just as vital when all that’s left are cockroaches, snow-drenched plastic forks, and half-decomposed cups laced with the thick syrup of Orange Julius. –Arielle Gordon\n\nFurther Reading: The Lonesome Crowded West Reissue Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n124.\n\nTori Amos: Little Earthquakes (1992)\n\nAs Tori Amos was writing her solo debut, the singer-songwriter had little faith on her side. Little Earthquakes followed her time in the short-lived synth-pop band Y Kant Tori Read; when she turned in a new album of stark piano and voice to Atlantic in 1990, the label rejected it and insisted on more guitars. But Amos—a minister’s daughter who had been playing piano in bars since 15 and knew this music was her lifeblood—was nothing if not resolute. She fought to release Little Earthquakes as she intended, an album of revelations hammered through piano that stunningly recounts crises of faith and relationships. Songs like “Crucify” use religion as a springboard to forgive and stand up for oneself; on “Silent All These Years” and “Me and a Gun,” Amos gives voice to survivors of sexual assault in powerfully unembellished words. Those songs led her to partner with the anti-sexual violence organization RAINN in 1994, still the largest of its kind in the United States. “I wrote my way out of my own private hell,” Amos said in 2020. “Writing songs was the only way I was going to heal.” With the soul-affirming music of Little Earthquakes, she made way for countless others to do the same. –Eric Torres\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n123.\n\nGuided by Voices: Bee Thousand (1994)\n\nIn 1994, Guided by Voices frontman Robert Pollard quit his job after 14 years as a schoolteacher and bet it all on rock’n’roll with Bee Thousand. Throughout this DIY touchstone, Pollard cranks out distorted gems full of do-or-die spirit and misheard lyrics, as if he’s recreating the greatest British Invasion songs that never existed directly into a four-track. Flanked by his Dayton, Ohio buddies, Pollard sounds insatiable and totally uninhibited. While his words rarely get more coherent than “goldheart mountaintop queen directory,” there’s something alchemical about the way he uncorks each phrase of poetic gibberish with everything he’s got, conjuring indie rock myth out of thin air. –Steven Arroyo\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n122.\n\nRoni Size / Reprazent: New Forms (1997)\n\nWhile some of his contemporaries were trying to legitimize drum ‘n’ bass by adapting it to the concert hall, Bristol, England’s Roni Size orchestrated a double-disc exercise in musical excess that often feels as if it could’ve been the work of a very amped-up jazz ensemble. This is nimble, proper music, crisp as a freshly vacuumed carpet with not a single fiber out of place. The individual performances Size captures are brilliant—Si John plays standup bass in a strangely inverted way, as if he’s watching himself in a mirror—but even as he’s leaning on the ensemble or expertly tacking vocalist Onallee’s sibilant runs to the ticks of the hi-hat, he never loses sight of the bigger picture. Take “Brown Paper Bag,” where he holds the listener up in a hotel lobby for the first two-and-a-half minutes, then gleefully sprints out of the front door to dance. –Marty Sartini Garner\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n121.\n\nGarbage: Garbage (1995)\n\nWhen it began, Garbage was a project helmed by Nevermind producer Butch Vig, who, by 1993, was kind of a big deal. But when they released their self-titled debut with a Scottish female singer in 1995, it was definitely Shirley Manson’s band—her fierce stage presence, outspoken attitude, and dark sense of humor would be the defining figure of the band. More pop than grunge but with plenty of grit and electronic edge, Garbage had layers of sharp production, but still felt raw thanks to Manson’s sneer and biting lyrics. It was anything but humorless, though—the hit single “Only Happy When It Rains” was actually a dig at the band’s own alternative scene and its preoccupation with misery, while “Stupid Girl” mocked privileged people who don’t use their power or potential for good. –Evie Nagy\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n120.\n\nRage Against the Machine: Rage Against the Machine (1992)\n\nEvery generation gets the rap-metal it deserves (see: the loutish gum-swallowers who ruled the late ’90s), but in 1992, Rage Against the Machine gave us the rap-metal we needed. Hearing their revolutionary ruckus on the same rock radio assembly line as the Black Crowes and Guns N’ Roses felt like discovering a Molotov cocktail in a crate of milk bottles. Their self-titled debut spiked millions of suburban CD changers with desperate funk and radical leftist politics; Tom Morello’s riffs conjured record scratches and sirens, while Zack de la Rocha punctuated the riot with exhortations and gut-shot grunts. Grunge bands of the day were nosing into darker corners, but only Rage seemed hellbent on flooding them with light—whether via truth or explosion. Even if you missed Rage’s point then, you could tell they had one, and that made all the difference. –Brian Howe\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n119.\n\nSarah McLachlan: Fumbling Towards Ecstasy (1993)\n\nFor those who hear the words “Sarah McLachlan” and reflexively summon an image constellation of tremendous adult-contemporary mauveness—shelter cats, hemp skirts, Lilith Fair corsetry—Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is here to serve as a reminder of the singer-songwriter’s formidable powers. Written alone in the mountains as the dark winter softened into spring, McLachlan’s third album is a rough-hewn cathedral: abstract monsters lurk behind the formalist arrangements, under the flowing stream of her voice. Directly inspired by Talk Talk’s experimental rock seance Spirit of Eden, McLachlan and producer Pierre Marchand undergird Ecstasy with a similarly shocking synesthetic precision—guitars strike at chest level like a conviction; chords shimmer out of a void, epiphanic; beauty blooms from stone. “Possession,” a love song told from the point of view of McLachlan’s real-life stalker, is the lodestar: alive, haunting, searching for some terrible grace. –Jia Tolentino\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n118.\n\nU2: Achtung Baby (1991)\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world woke up changed. U2, huffing off the historical moment, followed suit with their own rebirth. Their seventh album, which began its gestation in the reunified German capital at the top of the decade, remains one of rock’s most rewarding left turns, a beacon for mid-career bands looking to loosen up and freak out.\n\nAcross the record, the Edge trades in his holy guitar chimes for riffs that howl like tornados being sucked down a storm drain. The rhythms are suddenly, surprisingly danceable. Bono floats above the distorted din, moaning and whispering his deepest desires. Doused in black hair dye and shiny leather, the frontman transformed into a sentient oil slick, sending up hoary rock’n’roll clichés while gleefully reveling in them. At this point, the album’s surreal, after-hours milieu brings to mind another ’90s touchstone, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, with Bono playing the part of a famous family man trapped between love and lust, faith and folly. Achtung Baby still stands as the sleekest, grooviest, and just plain coolest thing U2 have ever done—a dark night of the soul seen through buggy wraparound shades. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n117.\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G.: Life After Death (1995)\n\nReleased 16 days after his murder, Life After Death demonstrates the Notorious B.I.G.’s mastery of seemingly every type of rap music that existed in 1997. If his debut Ready to Die was a gritty, austere New York album, Life After Death is the glossy, maximalist statement, with evermore intricate and subversive flows. He gets luxurious on “Hypnotize” only to step on his enemies’ necks on “Kick in the Door,” all of it unfolding on top of Bad Boy’s shiny, R&B-inflected production. When it comes to this nearly two-hour double album, the overwhelming sprawl is the point. –Jayson Buford\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n116.\n\nMazzy Star: So Tonight That I Might See (1993)\n\n“Fade Into You,” the dreamiest single of the ’90s, broke Mazzy Star through to the charts with its aching beauty. But anybody expecting their full-length to sustain that sense of fragile romance must have been shocked by the disquieting dread that hangs thick over So That Tonight I Might See, a dream-pop album with a gothic core. It plays out in a hallucinogenic swirl: Glimmers of warmth peek through the album’s lurching psychedelia, but they’re ephemeral, interrupted by stern, almost contemptuous blues riffs that glare into the distance. The harder you try to make eye contact with these songs, the more pointedly they avert your gaze. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n115.\n\nArthur Russell: Another Thought (1994)\n\nArthur Russell was boundless, iridescent, and unplaceable. The Downtown New York composer and cellist from Iowa worked across styles—disco, folk, experimental, pop, contemporary classical—but every note was charged by the illumination that flowed from his voice and heart, gathered at the fount of his Buddhist practice. His name, largely unknown in his lifetime, is now synonymous with possibility, restlessness, and love. Another Thought was the first compilation of his iconoclastic work following his 1992 death from AIDS. The delicate dissonance and depth of his amplified cello, paired with his sublimely sensitive singing, comes alive on “This Is How We Walk on the Moon,” proof he saw the future; “Lucky Cloud,” embodying his vision’s borderlessness; and “Losing My Taste for the Night Life,” an introvert’s hymn. It is for good reason that Russell is now an avatar of misunderstood genius. The only comfort is to keep listening as voraciously as Russell did, each song moving, he sings, towards “another thought now.” –Jenn Pelly\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n114.\n\nThe Pharcyde: Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde (1992)\n\nWith G-funk crumbling pavements in the Wild West, Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde offered a breezier boom-bap alternative. The Pharcyde were four knuckleheaded school friends from South Central L.A. who rapped about not getting girls and told “your mama” jokes in verses that could sound drunk and/or helium-high. Add in producer J Swift and his no-such-thing-as-sample-overkill attitude, and you have a madcap concoction that could never have come from any kind of tested recipe. –Dean Van Nguyen\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n113.\n\nThe Cranberries: Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We? (1993)\n\nBefore Dolores O’Riordan joined The Cranberries, she listened mainly to traditional Irish music and songs from her Catholic church, where she played the organ. She had never heard of Melody Maker or NME—“All I knew was that I was writing songs and saying what I felt,” she later remarked. But it was precisely that unvarnished earnestness—not a naïveté, as the press suggested, but a heartfelt lack of cynicism—that made The Cranberries’ 1993 debut, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can’t We?, so singularly moving, so unblinkingly sincere, breaking open even the irony-scarred hearts of American college radio snobs.\n\nThe Cranberries met O’Riordan’s chiming brogue with windswept string arrangements, delicate cymbal hits, and reverb-washed guitars. Listening to their music felt like reading the diary of a wood nymph—ethereal, enchanting, and slightly heartbreaking. But as much as O’Riordan’s lyrics define The Cranberries, it’s her wordless incantations, like that liberated, warbling cry before the last bridge of “Dreams,” that encapsulate their greatest feat: finding freedom, and even joy, in the great unknown. –Arielle Gordon\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n112.\n\nSelena: Amor Prohibido (1994)\n\nLatinos who grew up in the U.S. have a saying—ni de aquí, ni de allá; neither from here, nor there. Selena, a Latina from Texas, was making music that sounded like and appealed to both sides of the borderlands. And as complicated as her estate has become, or the dark shadow cast by her tragic death, nothing can take away from the impact Amor Prohibido—her final studio release before her 1995 death—had on American culture at large. Amor Prohibido was playful and pleasurable, revelatory and confident as Selena’s booming voice detailed male toxicity in greater detail and power than ever before. Through the ’90s balladry of “Si Una Vez” and “No Me Queda Más,” and bangers like “El Chico Del Apartamento 512” and “Techno Cumbia,” Selena brought cumbia rhythms to mainstream attention. Amor Prohibido remains the best-selling Tejano album of all time, blasting the subgenre to national attention. Most importantly, it’s the moment where Selena transcended regional stardom and became American pop royalty. –Gio Santiago\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n111.\n\nGreen Day: Dookie (1994)\n\nEvery decade gets the punk rock it deserves. The brutal imperialism of the ’70s inspired the biting satire of the Dead Kennedys; the ’80s gave us Tipper Gore and, in response, Danzig. But by the ’90s, a decade into the far quieter brutality of Reaganomics and the Moral Majority, punk’s targets had become evasive. Absent any obvious villains, what could a teenager in the Oakland suburbs rebel against other than himself?\n\nDookie, the Bay Area band’s major label debut, packaged up their neurotic, goofy, inward-facing jitters as neat, whip-fast pop perfection. Combining Brill Building vocal harmonies and palm-muted power chords, frontman Billie Joe Armstrong made apathy sound apoplectic. From “Burnout”’s disarmingly cheerful descent into total numbness to the bleakly sardonic portrait of urban decay on “Welcome to Paradise,” Dookie reached for humor to communicate helplessness. It was a clever sleight-of-hand that allowed Green Day to mask despair with dick jokes. For the downtrodden and the downwardly mobile, masturbating until you lose your mind can feel like rebellion, too. –Arielle Gordon\n\nFurther Reading: Dookie Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n110.\n\nGang Starr: Moment of Truth (1998)\n\nDJ Premier’s trademarked plinky piano loop kicks in seconds into “Work” and you go “uhh”—like, this is an insane oatmeal raisin cookie “uhh”—only for Guru to instantly echo your satisfaction with an “uhh” of his own. “I put in work,” he preens, “and watch my status escalate.” A quarter century later and 12 years since Guru left the planet, Moment of Truth’s status remains undisputed. The 1998 album—Gang Starr’s fifth total, and second after Guru’s landmark Jazzmatazz teamed him with Dr. Lonnie and Roy Ayers, among others—collects 20 tracks of spare Premier hip-hop beatcraft plus radically refined enunciation from Guru (calling himself “king of monotone,” a rare moment of self-deprecation, on the title cut). In the decades since, I’ve mostly listened to instrumentals of these tracks, luxuriating in Premier’s jazz snatches and other exotica-tinged samples, and meditating on the void left by Guru’s premature death. –Marc Weidenbaum\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n109.\n\nElastica: Elastica (1995)\n\nDuring Britpop’s heyday, Elastica were unjustly denied the same respect as peers like Blur and Suede in the powerful British music press. The best bits of “Connection” and “Waking Up”? Just rip-offs of Wire and the Stranglers. The band’s initial hype? It was little more than prurient interest in frontwoman Justine Frischmann's love triangle with Blur's Damon Albarn and Suede's Brett Anderson. But Elastica’s only real sin was making it all look so easy. Frischmann wrote wry lyrics about car sex, alcohol-fueled erectile dysfunction, and the tedium of making tea, and wrapped them around taut, bouncy hooks that got to the point and moved on. Elastica packs 15 tracks into a spring-loaded 38 minutes; Frischmann told anyone who wanted more to just rewind it. Good advice, then and now. –Jessica Suarez\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n108.\n\nMary J. Blige: What’s the 411? (1992)\n\nFrom the first refrain of her early single “Reminisce,” a mournful, sensual ex-sex jam, it was clear Mary J. Blige was not fronting. Her voice was raw with the travails of heartbreak and sounded perfectly imperfect, sidestepping the vocal flawlessness celebrated in R&B by letting emotion lead first—a revolutionary notion in the era of Jodeci’s choral masterpieces and Mariah’s operatic gymnastics. Her sound, too, signaled an evolution from new jack swing towards a more explicitly intertwined hip-hop and R&B, imbuing it with Blige’s emotional resonance and a Bronx-Yonkers vernacular. “Real Love” was a juggernaut that earned her the moniker the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul (initially a Puffy-inspired marketing gambit for radio stations confused by her porous genre lines), but every song on Blige’s debut knocked, even the slow jams. She was just 21, cool, and mad New York, embodying tough-girl sexy in oversized jerseys and doorknockers, and her entrance into the pop landscape was a revelation. –Julianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n107.\n\nSmog: Knock Knock (1999)\n\nBill Callahan has said that he intended Knock Knock, the seventh album under his Smog alias, to be a “teenage” album: big riffs, boundless attitude, wildcat and lightning bolt on the cover. Yet the songs, many of which were conceived behind the wheel of his Dodge van as he abandoned South Carolina following a breakup, examined entirely adult feelings and themes like empathy, self-knowledge, and regret. From the romantic promise of the opening “Let’s Move to the Country” to the kiss-off of “I Could Drive Forever” and the bruised farewell of the closing “Left Only With Love,” Knock Knock is charged with the pleasures and terrors of domestic comforts: budding families, abusive fathers, lonely suburban streets. In fact, the only song explicitly about adolescence, “Teenage Spaceship,” is a look back at a moment of serenity that Callahan seems to know he’ll never experience again. But the record’s keen-eyed depiction of promise and disappointment—paired with Jim O’Rourke’s inventive and exacting production—makes it one of the best in Callahan’s catalog. –Philip Sherburne\n\nFurther Reading: Knock Knock Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n106.\n\nTortoise: TNT (1998)\n\nForget you’ve ever heard the term “post-rock,” and all its associations—windy album titles, yawning orchestral dirges, the word “cinematic.” Instead, try thinking of Tortoise’s third album, TNT, as the sound of several galaxies on a slow collision course.\n\nIn the early ’90s, within the wake of Seattle’s grunge boom, at least five Billboard cover stories aimed to position Chicago as a grunge capital to rival the Pacific Northwest’s. Bands balked, alliances formed: Men from acts like Slint, Eleventh Dream Day, and Bastro blended with free jazz saxophonists and theatrical no-wavers for a strangely harmonious cosmic phalanx of punk, avant-garde, and jazz, intent on moving as far as possible from alt-rock’s earthbound mud. What came next was a strange, inconsistent universe: a constellation of spaghetti Western, Reichian patter, fusion noodling, krautrock locomotion. Skyward and too-much, Tortoise was an evolution—proof of entropy, a will to explore the colder perimeters of space, marginal by definition and design. –Mina Tavakoli\n\nFurther Reading: TNT Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify\n\n105.\n\nDigable Planets: Blowout Comb (1994)\n\nBlowout Comb is among the lushest and most sublime of hip-hop albums: Unhurried tempos invite dreamy contemplation, while samples from old jazz records carry fragrant clouds of vibraphone and Fender Rhodes. Floating above the grooves, the deeply musical voices of Ishmael “Butterfly\" Butler, Mary Ann “Ladybug Mecca” Vieira, and Craig “Doodlebug” Irving are three points of a perfect triangle, so confident in their message of Black liberation they need never shout. The sonic beauty and effortless style are woven into a complex emotional tapestry—amid joyous odes to the group’s Brooklyn home are lines about racist policing, incarcerated heroes, and neglected communities—leading to an album that meets you wherever you are and sounds different every time you put it on. –Mark Richardson\n\nFurther Reading: Blowout Comb Reissue Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n104.\n\nPet Shop Boys: Behaviour (1990)\n\nDrugs and success’s pressures rocked much of England’s great gay ’80s wave before AIDS did: The Pet Shop Boys nevertheless ascended while others overdosed. But by 1990, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe knew their self-described “imperial phase” of staggering worldwide success was over. So on this, their fourth album, they emphasize elegy over energy, and often symphonic melodies rather than club-centric rhythms. Their drollery is still intact: a former editor of UK pop bible Smash Hits, Tennant takes down smug stars like only he can on “How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?” But what gives the entire project life are the ghosts of countless AIDS fatalities summoned by meticulous analogue synth work overseen by Giorgio Moroder’s former collaborator Harold Faltermeyer, particularly on the haunted masterpiece, “Being Boring.” For those who survived, “All the people I was kissing/Some are here, and some are missing” remains one of pop’s saddest rhymes. –Barry Walters\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify\n\n103.\n\nAir: Moon Safari (1998)\n\nAs French house music started burning up dancefloors in the late ’90s, Moon Safari arrived for everybody who was trying to chill at home near the stereo. Air’s Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel made slinky electronics-bolstered lounge music—hookup jams that were at once of their era and an undeniable product of ’70s popular culture. Dainty robot voices sing “Kelly watch the stars” on a wistful track in homage to Jaclyn Smith’s Charlie’s Angels character; the instrumental “Ce Matin-lá” carries sweeping Bacharach and Love Unlimited Orchestra vibes, while Beth Hirsch’s vocals made the songs sound “like a space-age Carpenters,” as Godin once put it. It’s a bold series of vintage looks, but the duo’s earnestness makes Moon Safari camp without caricature. –Evan Minsker\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n102.\n\nWilco: Summerteeth (1999)\n\nWilco’s 2002 album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is widely seen as the fault line dividing their formative roots-rock phase and their more boldly experimental second act, but its 1999 predecessor, Summerteeth, had already demonstrated an equally urgent desire to break free from their past. It’s just that, where Yankee infamously deconstructed their sound into dissonance and drones, Summerteeth aspired to be nothing less than the alt-country Pet Sounds. But the album’s hair-raising orchestral ascents and Mellotron-swirled luxuriousness can’t mask the deep distress in Jeff Tweedy’s lyrics—written during a rough patch in his marriage, songs like “She’s a Jar” and “Via Chicago” teeter perilously on the edge of where domestic disturbances turn into crime scenes. Today, Summerteeth also stands as a pristine portrait of the troubled relationship between Tweedy and late Wilco co-founder Jay Bennett, before well-documented discord triggered their aesthetic divorce. –Stuart Berman\n\nFurther Reading: Summerteeth Reissue Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n101.\n\nBuilt to Spill: Keep It Like a Secret (1999)\n\nBuilt to Spill’s most reassuring album, and the last of their trio of consecutive great ones, Keep It Like a Secret comforts like a hug from a friend who doesn’t usually do hugs. Band leader Doug Martsch cut through the cynicism of ’90s alt-rock with unabashed earnestness, singing about psyches and bodies buckling under the weight of societal pressures while insisting we’re more than the weight of our adolescent traumas. “Count your blemishes/You can’t, they’re all gone,” he sings on “Carry The Zero,” as guitars cry along. You can be forgiven for joining them. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n100.\n\nJim O’Rourke: Eureka (1999)\n\nAt the end of the ’90s, underground music’s foremost hyphenate tossed a surprising title onto the dashboard: singer-songwriter. Before Eureka, Jim O’Rourke had played hurdy-gurdy on more tracks than he’d sung lead. Nowadays, there’s a sizable audience that associates him not with noise collaborations or guitar experiments but a clutch of exquisitely wrought pop-rock releases from the turn of the century. Warm yet prickly in the rumpled tradition of Harry Nilsson, the album includes allusions to the perilous performance art of Chris Burden, a poignantly faithful Bacharach cover, and finely crafted chamber-pop arrangements played by the cream of Chicago’s jazz and indie rock scenes. Guiding it all are the steady hands of O’Rourke, who can set a cello and steel pan to dance, or make a shaker sound meditative. –Brad Shoup\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Tidal\n\n99.\n\nThe Flaming Lips: The Soft Bulletin (1999)\n\nFew records have fundamentally shifted the trajectory of a band’s career as The Soft Bulletin did for the Flaming Lips. Nine albums and 16 years into their existence, The Soft Bulletin redirected these presumed one-hit wonders from the cut-out bin to the top line on the festival poster, transforming an irreverent fuzz-rock band into deeply philosophical emissaries of circus-sized orchestral spectacle, nun puppet and all.\n\nBut while it’s impossible to hear the opening drum strike of “Race for the Prize” without picturing exploding confetti cannons and human-sized plastic bubbles, The Soft Bulletin’s breathtaking symphonic-rock rapture is ultimately a function of escapist fantasia crashing into cold, hard truths. Spinning real-life stories of drug addiction and the loss of parents into sweetly sung, wondrous fables, the album remains an indispensable support system for dealing with the problems and stresses that await us outside the venue once all that confetti gets swept up. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n98.\n\nSmashing Pumpkins: Siamese Dream (1993)\n\nIn the video for “Today,” Smashing Pumpkins’ breakthrough single, Billy Corgan stars as a dorky ice cream man who reads comic books and imagines sexy couples making out all around him. He is by far the least cool-looking person in the clip, and that’s the point. With their second album, the Chicago quartet dive-bombed into a rock era defined by rawness and DIY humility armed with guitar-god solos, drum theatrics, and production that made every second of the 62-minute opus sound as pristine as the Hope Diamond. Siamese Dream was an alternative to punk piety, and it soon became an alt-rock blueprint for generations to come.\n\nThroughout the record, Corgan coos and sneers as he works through troubling childhood memories and suicidal depression, his trauma turning triumphant when matched with so many squealing riffs. “Life’s a drag!” he sings, smearing the last word across five ecstatic syllables, and making human existence sound like a bummer that’s very much worth living. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n97.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest: Midnight Marauders (1993)\n\nFaced with the task of following up 1991’s classic The Low End Theory, A Tribe Called Quest responded by adding just the right touches of conceptual breadth and subtle innovation. From its multiple album cover designs celebrating a community of (literal) hip-hop heads to its playful, proto-Siri interludes, Midnight Marauders positioned Tribe as unifiers and humanizers amid modern life’s estrangements.\n\nThe record was at turns thoughtful (the N-word defense language discourse “Sucka Nigga”) and self-deprecating (“8 Million Stories,” a comical chronicle of mundane struggles), but it most dominantly emoted joy. Across a dazzling boom-bap production-scape that merged Blue Note, original school breaks, and Quiet Storm classics, Q-Tip and Phife sounded ebullient, their vocal chemistry offering a comprehensive study in abstract/wisecrack interplay. From statements of purpose like “Award Tour” to the ecstatic rhyme exercise “Lyrics to Go” to the bawdy pick-up lines of “Electric Relaxation,” the pair exuded comradery and affection. It was Tribe’s true love movement. –Jeff Mao\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n96.\n\nPrimal Scream: Screamadelica (1991)\n\nPrimal Scream made it all sound far too easy on Screamadelica, whose combination of classic songwriting and electronic production left an early high-water mark for forward-thinking rock music in the 1990s. Listening to the Scottish group’s third LP, it seemed only natural that house, blues, soul, dub, ambient, rave, and psychedelic rock should come together in 65 minutes of joyful music; it seemed somehow right that a gang of MC5-obsessed rockers on their critical uppers should create a work of ecstasy-blasted euphoria that provided the Day-Glo yin to Nirvana’s turbulent yang. The results were the epitome of unfettered musical instinct, as Primal Scream and their motley crew (including producer/DJ Andrew Weatherall, ambient-house pioneers the Orb, singer Denise Johnson, former PiL bass player Jah Wobble, and Rolling Stones producer Jimmy Miller) powered through the history of modern music and into the future, operating on inspiration and too many early mornings. Its ragtag bag of influences meant Screamadelica sounded a lot like many people, but no one sounded quite like Screamadelica, an album both perfectly of its time and light years ahead of the rock/dance curve. –Ben Cardew\n\nFurther Reading: Screamadelica Reissue Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n95.\n\nIce Cube: Death Certificate (1991)\n\nNo Jheri curl, no mercy. Over molten funk and soul loops, Ice Cube spends Death Certificate accosting every American person, demographic, and structure that he sees as an impediment to Black power. The concept album—divided into a death side mirroring the times and a life side imagining an improved future—is fiendishly specific and textured, gangster rap as sworn deposition and apocalyptic fever dream.\n\nWhen Los Angeles exploded in protest the following year over the acquittals of three LAPD officers who brutalized Rodney King, Death Certificate’s caustic verses evoking fiery Black insurrection proved prophetic. But the album’s urgent mood relies on tension as well as outright flamethrowing. Cube plays both storyteller and polemicist, couching the threats to burn it all down in slow-building narratives set in hospital waiting rooms, jail cells, and Korean-owned package stores. As he brings these locales to life with humor, wit, and irritation alongside rage, the album reveals itself to be more testament than manifesto—one rapper’s constant proximity to death informing an unapologetic vision of life. –Stephen Kearse\n\nFurther Reading: Death Certificate Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n94.\n\nNo Doubt: Tragic Kingdom (1995)\n\nGwen Stefani’s heartbreak became No Doubt’s glory, fueling the SoCal ska-pop group’s powerhouse third album, Tragic Kingdom. The soon-to-be-iconic frontwoman wrote her way through a breakup with the band’s bassist, Tony Kanal, resulting in a series of hits that juxtaposed her pain with frolicking rhythms and liberal explorations of ska, disco, and new wave. But it was “Just a Girl,” the album’s snarky wink of a lead single—with muscular, looping guitar from Tom Dumont backing Stefani’s affected warble—that captured the feminist attitude of the time and helped them conquer the mainstream. With Tragic Kingdom, No Doubt seemed to ask: What if, instead of crying over all that hurt, you could kick the door down, throw one helluva party, and skank your way better? –Amanda Wicks\n\nFurther Reading: Tragic Kingdom Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n93.\n\nBeck: Odelay (1996)\n\nListening to Odelay is like watching a Vegas revue made from the trash we left behind. He’s karaoke country, he’s toy-commercial rap, he’s rhinestone-studded soul. You get the sense Beck is having fun with it, but also that he’s lost in translation: After all, “I’ve got a devil’s haircut in my mind” doesn’t make sense no matter how passionately you scream it.\n\nAs much as the album captured the eclecticism of mid-’90s bohemia, it also glimpsed the attention-deficient moment to come. This is music that came out before most people had cell phones, when the internet came from a plug in the wall. Where early hip-hop had used sampling and collage to bring disparate sounds together, Odelay created a feeling of almost perpetual dislocation, but also of wonder: The lights that keep flashing and the pings that keep pinging whether you know where they’re coming from or not. –Mike Powell\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n92.\n\nAutechre: Amber (1994)\n\nAutechre’s second album soothes with one hand and abrades with the other. The comforting touch makes the irritant all the more effective; there’s so much warm bathwater flowing over your skin that you don’t realize it’s being sanded away. The Manchester electronic duo released Amber on Warp as the label entered its most emblematic era, when albums from Aphex Twin, Nightmares on Wax, and Boards of Canada would pinch UK dance music into a tight, heady corner. The record taught successive generations of hyperfocused sound sculptors that you didn’t need more than a handful of off-the-shelf tools to render lurid, immersive environments; that nausea could feed pleasure rather than upend it; that with enough patience, fertilizer, and poison, impossible landscapes can grow. –Sasha Geffen\n\nFurther Reading: Amber Reissue Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n91.\n\nWeezer: Weezer (Blue Album) (1994)\n\nMainstream pop culture was not always so obsessed with superheroes and nerds named Sheldon; for many years, rock stars were insatiable creatures, not insecure dorks. Weezer leader Rivers Cuomo wasn’t single-handedly responsible for this shift, but his bespectacled presence from 1994 onward was like a flare to the sky for rock geeks everywhere. The wholesomeness of the first and greatest of Weezer’s color-coded eponymous albums—from the Beach Boys harmonies and X-Men lyrics to the Happy Days-inspired “Buddy Holly” video coming preloaded on Windows 95—is matched by a sour note, upon closer listening. You can hear it in the ultra-crisp hard-rock riffs, the loud-soft dynamic cribbed from the Pixies, and most of all, the record’s animating tension, between crushing vulnerability and uncomfortable jokes about the opposite sex (if released today, someone would surely call it an incel classic). This is the dream-shame space of kids who fear the rules but long to break them, of boys and girls who feel rejected before they even try, and it is one of the most powerful forces that can propel a modern guitar record. No wonder Blue and its even more curdled follow-up, 1996’s Pinkerton, became classics of third-wave emo and sensitive indie rock alike. –Jill Mapes\n\nFurther Reading: Weezer Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n90.\n\nGhostface Killah: Ironman (1996)\n\nGhostface Killah recorded Ironman in a burst of uneasy adrenaline, fresh off the incarceration of his best friend and a frightening diabetes diagnosis. The fact that he’s never been happy with the result—“deadlines will fuck you up,” he told Okayplayer in 2021, on occasion of the album’s 25th anniversary—only testifies to the impossibility of confining the splatter of his unruly mind to one canvas. Without the Al Green flips on “Iron Maiden” and “260” or the sunlit Jackson 5 sample on “All That I Got Is You,” there would be no soul loops as rap fans understand them today—a young Kanye West cited Ghostface as the originator of his style, and made the beats for The Blueprint with him in mind. Without Ghostface’s furry Kangols and two-toned Wallabees, Cam’ron would have never worn pink or driven a Laffy Taffy-colored Range Rover; without the comic-book style lettering on the front, a young Daniel Dumile would have never donned the mask to become MF DOOM. Ghost’s influence spread so wide in part because he felt so human and touchable. In a group of rough shouters, he raised his voice in anxiety as often as in anger, and he remains the only Wu member capable of making you weep for him, as he did on the Mary J. Blige-assisted “All That I Got Is You.” He would refine his bugged-out panoramas on 2000’s Supreme Clientele, but Ironman injected the first operatic note into gangsta rap, and it’s trembled with strange, ungovernable emotions ever since. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n89.\n\nSonny Sharrock: Ask the Ages (1991)\n\nEven in jazz, singularity can be a burden. With asthma precluding him from the sax, Sonny Sharrock bent and hammered his guitar strings to sound like the tenor players he worshiped. The style he developed in the ’60s—which sometimes suggested the sound of someone forging a sword out of lava—made him an odd fit in a scene that had tilted from free jazz toward fusion. He bowed out in the mid ’70s but emerged a decade later, his gifts fully appreciated and intact.\n\nHis last release before his death at 53, Ask the Ages was the culmination of this comeback: a taut, modern set showcasing his tonal and compositional abilities. He recruited two key figures from John Coltrane’s spiritual-jazz era, drummer Elvin Jones and saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, and set them loose on prickly modal slouches, skronky workouts, and some of his stickiest melodies: “Who Does She Hope to Be?” is a candidate for the most plaintive ballad—in any genre—of the decade. –Brad Shoup\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n88.\n\nSonic Youth: Goo (1990)\n\nWhen Sonic Youth signed with major label DGC for their 1990 album Goo, some feared they had abandoned the underground. As if. Goo takes the destructive bliss defined by its predecessor Daydream Nation and sharpens it—but only a smidge. The resulting songs are some of their finest, from the warped “Dirty Boots” to Kim Gordon’s devastating tribute to Karen Carpenter, “Tunic (Song for Karen).” As usual, Sonic Youth were ahead of the curve: One year later, punk would break and every major label would invest in alternative bands that they hoped could crash the charts. (For their part, DGC crossed their fingers that an album called Nevermind would match the sales of Goo.) But few bands ever “sold out” and remained as untouchably cool as Sonic Youth. –Quinn Moreland\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n87.\n\nDJ Screw: 3 ’N The Mornin’ Part Two (1996)\n\nDJ Screw was an effortless curator of vibes, an intuitive conductor of rhythm and a notorious workaholic known for his nocturnal habits and nonstop hustle. The basics of chopped and screwed are simple: two copies of the same record are slowed down side-by-side, with one track a beat behind the other to create the stuttering “chopped” rhythm. But Screw was a turntablist wizard before he ever slowed music down, and there’s an electric unpredictability to his mixing that never resorts to formula. 3 ’N the Mornin’ Part Two is one of Screw’s signature works not just because it was one of the few retail projects he released during his lifetime, but because it’s such a vivid time capsule of Texas rap—essentially, an extended studio session with local legends like Lil’ Keke, Big Moe, and Point Blank. In the years since, his music has spread from the trunk speakers of Houston to the earbuds of the world, passed along like folklore through burned CDs and zip files, revived by Drake samples and Megan Thee Stallion freestyles and the Moonlight soundtrack, summoned by every kid making vaporwave remixes in their bedroom. But there’s no mistaking homage for the original—it’s only screwed if Robert Earl Davis made it. –Nadine Smith\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n86.\n\nSpiritualized: Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space (1997)\n\nIn Jason Pierce’s musical quest to hit as many pleasure receptors as real heroin, the high has never been more pure and terrible than on Spiritualized’s 1997 masterpiece. Painstakingly constructed from performances by the band, a string quartet, a gospel choir, and Dr. John, Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space blurs shoegaze sleep paralysis into full-throated gospel deliverance into lullaby harmonica blues. The noise burns like a sunspot, the light at the end of a tunnel stretching from the first church bell chime of the title track to the decaying ebb of “Cop Shoot Cop…,” the ultimate comedown. Never duplicated, Ladies and Gentlemen is an album of bared teeth and tender romantic underbelly, a secret password to the hearts of the surliest old heads in indie rock. –Anna Gaca\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n85.\n\nGodspeed You! Black Emperor: F♯ A♯ ∞ (1997)\n\nUpon first listen, you might mistake Godspeed You! Black Emperor’s first album of chilling and expansive post-rock for an apocalyptic prophecy intercepted from an extraterrestrial frequency. “We’re trapped in the belly of this horrible machine/And the machine is bleeding to death,” the narrator of “Dead Flag Blues” states in a deadpan growl. But for each foreboding drone, there’s a glimmer of hope: jubilant glockenspiel, wistful bagpipes, the crashing drums halfway through “Providence.” GY!BE were not only interested in illustrating our broken world, but also in radicalizing listeners to do something about it. Like the penny flattened by passing trains that comes with each vinyl copy—a symbol of the force needed to bend and break capitalism—F♯ A♯ ∞ is both a warning and an inspiration. –Nina Corcoran\n\nFurther Reading: F♯ A♯ ∞ Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n84.\n\nOutKast: ATLiens (1996)\n\nATLiens is simultaneously an excavation into the city of OutKast’s childhood and a farewell to it. It is a solemn ruin of cross streets, landmarks, aggrieved ballads, and defensive young men talking past one another. Its muted funk licks and fathomless basslines are transmissions from a subterranean bunker, or, if you prefer, deep space. The slow contemplation yields intricate characters—dour pimps, half-aware caricatures, backwoods philosophers. Yet the miracle of ATLiens lies in its digression. “Babylon,” for instance, is at once a graphic account of Andre 3000’s sexual history and a heartfelt tribute to Big Boi’s late aunt. This yin and yang would prove OutKast’s undoing, but on ATLiens it makes for a fascinatingly humane dialogue, creative partners maintaining brilliant correspondence while failing to meet one another’s eyes. –Pete Tosiello\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n83.\n\nSlint: Spiderland (1991)\n\nSpiderland is the loudest quiet record of the ’90s, a harrowing experience of psychic despair and physical desolation whose impact was as significant as its record sales were fallow. (To tweak the old saying, less than 10,000 people bought a copy but every one of them started a post-rock band.) The members of Slint were four regular guys from Louisville, Kentucky, prone to goofs and pranks—that they made such a profoundly bleak record characterized by negative space and brooding contemplation speaks to the mundanity of depression and its unbreakable hold on the spirit. As the story goes, singer Brian McMahan checked himself into a psychiatric hospital the morning after recording was finished. His vocals toggle between plaintive spoken word and pained howls, as David Pajo’s guitar lines stretch and wobble like power lines swaying in the wind. The songs are beyond summary, because to say that “Good Morning, Captain” is about missing someone is to say that Moby Dick is about going fishing. Thirty years after it reshaped rock music with the potential to create an unknowable atmosphere, Spiderland is still a portal to a haunted America where ghosts lurk in every forgotten crevice. –Jeremy Gordon\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n82.\n\nThe Chicks: Fly (1999)\n\nThe Chicks begin Fly, their fifth album, by running from love, and they end it ready to say goodbye to a relationship that can’t be fixed. Heralded by Natalie Maines’ twangy yelps and pace-quickening arrangements of banjo, violin, and guitar, the trio fight against domestic standards, instead painting relationships with men as dangerous, limiting, and boring. “Goodbye Earl,” which tells the story of two best friends who murder an abusive ex and then start a farm together, is Fly’s emotional centerpiece: a snarling, intensely funny quest for justice and a celebration of the safety found in bonds with other women. Their desire to find wild and unruly love shines through, but often as a means for self actualization rather than yearning for any particular person. Fly laid the groundwork for the group’s more explicitly political era, too: These were women who honored their truest desires and paid no attention to what others wanted from them. –Vrinda Jagota\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n81.\n\nRadiohead: The Bends (1995)\n\nBetween the grunge pastiche of Pablo Honey and the outsize art-rock of OK Computer, The Bends arrived as an unlikely milestone for Britpop and for Radiohead itself. The band worked with mainstay producer Nigel Godrich for the first time, and Thom Yorke blew his previous songwriting out of the water, signaling a visionary future. Some of the quintet’s most reliable traits emerged: stadium-singalong balladry; cryptic lyrics about capitalist dread, artificiality, and paranoia; deceptively complex guitar lines that could split the ground open or gorgeously float through space and time; Yorke’s unmistakable falsetto. Radiohead managed to expand upon this framework en route to most acclaimed rock catalog of the past 30 years because the template was so undeniable. –Max Freedman\n\nFurther Reading: The Bends Reissue Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n80.\n\nBikini Kill: The C.D. Version of the First Two Records (1994)\n\nUsing hardcore’s aggression for unapologetic feminist expression, riot grrrl pioneers Bikini Kill kicked down the door of the patriarchy and male-dominated punk scenes. Their song “Rebel Girl,” in which frontwoman Kathleen Hanna declares her devotion to “the queen of the neighborhood” who embodies the revolution, became the undisputed riot grrrl anthem after the release of the band’s studio debut Pussy Whipped in October 1993. But the band brought their older music to the front on this 1994 LP, unequivocally affirming for a new global audience that their revolution was far more than a one-off battle cry. Songs like “Suck My Left One,” about defiance in the face of incest, and “White Boy,” a white-hot rage against sexual assault (“I can not scream from pain down here on my knees/I’m so sorry that I think!”), went in hard and intensified Bikini Kill’s unrelenting message. –Evie Nagy\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n79.\n\nDMX: It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot (1998)\n\nAmid the frenzied mourning that erupted in New York City following DMX’s tragic passing last year, it was easy to forget that Earl Simmons had once seemed like a lost cause, passed over by Bad Boy for the more bankable LOX after early single “The Born Loser” flopped at Columbia. But this trial by failure proved to be his salvation. By the time Def Jam gave him a shot, DMX was a 27-year-old vet who wasn’t about to take his second chance for granted.\n\nIt’s Dark and Hell Is Hot is a chilling, introspective debut album that laid waste to the shiny suit era by cashing in on X’s hard-won vantage point. “Ruff Ryders Anthem”’s bruising clarion call sets the stage for an odyssey through a man’s fractured soul, one that can cook up Faustian bargains (“Damien”) while playing God’s ventriloquist as self-therapy (“The Convo”), preach a gospel of retribution (“Get at Me Dog”), and bask in everlasting forgiveness (“Prayer”). It’s a toast to a new king as he sits atop a throne of blood. –Phillipe Roberts\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n78.\n\nThe Magnetic Fields: 69 Love Songs (1999)\n\nAfter Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, but before Sufjan Stevens promised to write an album after every state, the most ambitious music project known to indie heads was 69 Love Songs. The album delivers exactly what the title says, styled as cowboy ballads, folk songs, synth pieces, and countless other genres, all tied together with Stephin Merritt’s devastatingly clever lyrics. Merritt has maintained that it’s not an album about love, but about love songs—devotional, yes, but only to the tropes of the genre. He’s a scholar of pop music, and Love Songs is his thesis. But all of that is easy to forget once immersed in the world of the album itself, which is endlessly generous with its vignettes and listeners alike. They wouldn’t be love songs if they didn’t charm us off our feet, waltz us through familiar scenes which suddenly feel eye-openingly new, and leave us swooning—even when we think we should know better. –NM Mashurov\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n77.\n\nThe Roots: Things Fall Apart (1999)\n\nIf Things Fall Apart was Questlove’s idea of going pop, then the Roots drummer and bandleader’s vision of commercial appeal was so rich and multi-faceted that just about anything could qualify. The Philadelphia hip-hop group’s fourth album boasts one of the most breathtaking ballads of the neo-soul era they helped guide, “You Got Me,” a Jill Scott co-write that overflows with bittersweet strings, a serene Erykah Badu chorus, and the brash introduction of Philly rapper Eve. But as you might expect from a record named after the seminal Chinua Achebe novel, it’s also some rigorously heady stuff, bookended by dialogue from Spike Lee’s Mo’ Better Blues and a graphic spoken-word poem. And with dual MCs Black Thought and Malik B. trading verses with their usual improvisatory verve, joined by such formidable verbal sparring opponents as Mos Def and Common, it’s closer to an old-school rap battle than the personality-driven myth-making that was then crossing over from the hip-hop charts. Still: take one listen to the loopy flows of the J Dilla-produced “Dynamite!,” and Things Fall Apart sounds like—if not pop exactly—then the impressionistic shape of art-pop to come. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n76.\n\nThe KLF: Chill Out (1990)\n\nAs a creation story for the ’90s, Chill Out has it all. Emerging in the first months of the decade from a British rave scene approaching its apogee, this sublime suite of anti-music was all about appropriation—a quintessential ’90s methodology. From its origins in a contested DJ collaboration to its majestic tapestry woven from samples of Tuvan throat singers, BBC jingles, and bursts of Fleetwood Mac and Van Halen, the record exalted the gathering obsession with musical borrowing (aka theft) in late 20th century pop. But aside from its situationist hijinks, the KLF’s most listenable album also sounded—quite literally—like a dream. The cornerstone of an entire genre, Chill Out’s hypnagogic fantasy of a twilight trawl across the Deep South established the gold standard for early-hours comedown music—one only rarely matched in the decades since. –Alex Niven\n\nFurther Reading: Chill Out Sunday Review\n\nListen: YouTube\n\n75.\n\nNirvana: In Utero (1993)\n\nBy 1993, Kurt Cobain was ailing from chronic stomach pain, exacerbated by a poor diet and his scoliosis, which he treated unsuccessfully with heroin. In February of that year, In Utero wasn’t so much made as it was purged from Nirvana’s digestive tract, tasting of copper and smelling of offal. Recorded live in a Minnesota studio by Steve Albini in a two-week sprint, the album was in exercise in rejection: of the glossy sound of Nevermind, of Nirvana’s sudden fame, of bodily organs, of life in general. Cobain sang about kissing open sores, eating cancer, anemia, milk, shit, umbilical nooses—an undigested litany that hints that his pain was much more of his body than in his mind. The singer’s vocal cords sound either lightly sandpapered or heavily scalpelled, recorded without any overdubs. He is alternately angry, sarcastic, spiritual, caustic, wearing his heart on his sleeve only because he’s turned his body inside out for all to see. –Jeremy D.

An inflated garbage bag jumpsuit, a universe of celestial, serrated beats, and a love of the eccentric. Timbaland’s mosaic production style—often spacious, with room for a chorus of crickets, some beatboxing, or masterfully placed soul samples—were the ideal foundation for Missy’s ruminations on fuckboys, booty calls, and heartache. With staccato raps and catchy flows, Elliott struck a perfect balance between romantic vulnerability and self-assured flexing, an approach that felt like uncharted territory within a world that hypersexualized women. The album also assembled late ’90s R&B and rap luminaries like Lil’ Kim, Busta Rhymes, and Aaliyah, showcasing an industry in transition. At the moment of hip-hop’s commercial surge, this pair of Afrofuturists was envisioning how the genre could stretch its imagined boundaries in the new millennium. The fact that it only took two weeks in the studio to bring Supa Dupa Fly to life is just further proof of the depth of the duo’s prescient vision. –Isabelia Herrera\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n73.\n\nYo La Tengo: I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One (1997)\n\nThis was not Yo La Tengo’s first great album, nor their second, but it marked the first time that they were so great in so many different ways at once. While the New Jersey indie trio had by this point perfected the connection between close-mic intimacy and freakout solos, I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One shows them brimming with ideas, including sample-punctured meditations (“Moby Octopad”), tightened-up pop (“Stockholm Syndrome”), and dialogues between ambient crickets and a slide guitar (“Green Arrow”). The album is as quiet and gentle as a winter snowfall, as loud and electric as a spring thunderstorm, as free and fun as a summer bike ride, and as durable and dependable as, yes, the world’s best autumn sweater. –Steven Arroyo\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n72.\n\nDe La Soul: De La Soul Is Dead (1991)\n\nA fraught follow-up to their irresistibly confectionary debut, 1991’s De La Soul Is Dead is a sui-generis act of ingenious world building and uneasy vibes. Its closest antecedent in music history could be Sly and the Family Stone’s 1971 landmark There’s a Riot Goin’ On, which likewise evinced newly formed skepticism regarding utopian ideals while exhibiting a thrillingly novel sonic palette. The two groups’ migration from optimistic self-determination to anguished acknowledgement of an insurmountable power structure roughly traces the tortured start-and-stop trajectory of every consequential American liberation movement, and the blood is all over these tracks. From the self-negating album title to the skittering don’t-fuck-with-us-’cause-you-think-we’re-hippies warnings of “Please Porridge” to the infectious but spiritually wobbly “Keepin’ the Faith,” De La Soul Is Dead is the sound of a group taking inventory of their early success with pronounced wariness and a vaulting sense of musical adventure. –Elizabeth Nelson\n\nListen: YouTube\n\n71.\n\nPulp: Different Class (1995)\n\nAt age 16, Jarvis Cocker drew up an ambitious manifesto for his new band, then called Arabicus Pulp: “The group shall work its way into the public eye by producing fairly conventional, yet slightly offbeat, pop songs [...] then begin to subvert and restructure both the music business and music itself.” Nearly two decades later, the frontman and his group did manage to capture the attention of the masses via Different Class, a full-length that alchemized bubblegum, glam, and luxe new wave into artful pop preoccupied with social divisions and furtive couplings. Anchoring it all is “Common People,” the stinging insta-anthem about a sculpture student slumming it with a normie, that got Pulp to No. 2 on the UK charts. The album may not have upended the record industry at large, but it did illuminate a path forward for the band’s fellow mis-shapes, mistakes, and misfits. –Robert Ham\n\nFurther Reading: Different Class Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n70.\n\nPavement: Slanted and Enchanted (1992)\n\nPavement weren’t the only early-’90s band that turned noise into something like pop—Nirvana and Sonic Youth did the same—but the low-key charm of Slanted and Enchanted felt different. Whatever angst they might’ve felt was sublimated by a bookishness and sense of grandeur that made even their feedback seem sweet. In an unearthed 1982 high school newspaper profile on singer Stephen Malkmus, he’s pictured in lacrosse gear, looking dreamily toward the horizon under the headline “Athletics, punk band occupy Malkmus’ time.” The jocks, the nerds, the freaks—maybe it wasn’t as simple as The Breakfast Club made it seem.\n\nThe title comes from the poet Emily Dickinson: “Tell all the truth/but tell it slant.” They sound like boys but their mystery runs deep. To gentle hearts inspired by punk’s freedom but wigged out by its intensity, they served as proof that not every revolution demands a fight. –Mike Powell\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Bandcamp | Spotify | Tidal\n\n69.\n\nGZA: Liquid Swords (1995)\n\nStaten Island is lonely. Time moves slower; the winter feels a little more frigid than in Brooklyn or Jersey; the limited ways to get off the island sometimes make you feel like you’re trapped. More so than any other Wu-Tang Clan album, group or solo, Liquid Swords is Staten Island’s. GZA’s still, quiet, and grim nature captures the mood of a borough that feels like exile. The bedrock is made of dark and brooding beats—with the R&B samples stripped of all color, it’s arguably the greatest production work of RZA’s hot streak. All the Wu members are here, but their larger than life personalities are reserved without being muted, handing over the centerstage to GZA’s pensive, dense, and descriptive rhymes. Bullets hit first floor window panes and bust up dice games on “Cold World”; the world-building on “Hell’s Wind Staff/Killah Hills 10304” is full of imagination as the song gradually builds from drug-dealing in real-life New York City locations to a Narcos plot. The album is lined with clips from the bleak 1980 samurai flick Shogun Assassin, where blood sprays and battles are treated like an inevitability. At a time when the Wu solo records were from the roughhousing, quotable, and larger-than-life personalities like Method Man, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, and Raekwon, the gravity of Liquid Swords pulled rap into a new orbit. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n68.\n\nBob Dylan: Time Out of Mind (1997)\n\nMotorcycle crashes and crashed marriages, spiritual awakenings and amphetamine escapades: Despite rounds of severe real-life turmoil, Bob Dylan had never gone four years without releasing new music, at least until the late ’90s. Nearing 60, was he done? Time Out of Mind suggests he wondered that very thing. An album of bedrock existential doubt and loneliness so pervasive that death itself seems the only cure, this is a Dylan record without precedent or parallel, blues draped across his back like a translucent mourning shroud, as if he were sitting shiva for himself. In a humid Miami studio, producer Daniel Lanois conducted a sterling band of multiple drummers and keyboardists, shaping the eerie haze through which this Dylan-in-doubt could drift. “There’s not even room enough to be anywhere,” he grumbles during a song about making one’s own deathbed. He was wrong: No other ’90s album by Dylan’s aging peers invented a new space for its maker like these 11 haunted beauties. –Grayson Haver Currin\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n67.\n\nBeastie Boys: Check Your Head (1992)\n\nAfter their skull-snapping 1989 sample-go-‘round Paul’s Boutique flopped, the Beastie Boys wiped the slate clean. Michael Diamond, Adam Horovitz, and Adam Yauch set up shop in their Los Angeles headquarters (complete with skateboard ramp and basketball court) and started jamming on the instruments they had put down when they left hardcore punk behind. Inspired by the funk classics they had been mining for samples, they set out to create some grooves of their own. “A lot of the theory was, let’s make a record that’s like the dope break parts,” said Diamond. The blend of punk, funk, and hip-hop on Check Your Head—from the fuzzed-out, stuttery hit “So What’Cha Want” to a Biz Markie guest spot to a blistering cover of Sly Stone’s “Time for Livin’”—established the archetypally ’90s skate-rap-rock aesthetic. And on soul-searching songs like “Gratitude” and “Stand Together,” the Beastie Boys’ startling transformation from superbrats to enlightened activists had begun. –Alan Light\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n66.\n\nCat Power: Moon Pix (1998)\n\nChan Marshall wrote all of her fourth record as Cat Power in one evening while living in a barn with fellow songwriter Bill Callahan, and it plays like a summer thunderstorm in the middle of nowhere. At the time, Marshall was under pressure and about to give up on music, and you can hear that urgency, that weariness. Moon Pix is primarily a tempestuous, feel-bad listen: It’s 4 a.m., stumbling drunk, drop-your-keys-on-the-front-porch shit. Her bleariness on a song like “Metal Heart” is palpable; the shuffling drum machine loop on “American Flag” can’t help but make your soul grow tired. On Moon Pix, Marshall sings like she has to, like it’s the only way she can make you understand how she’s feeling. And she does. –Sophie Kemp\n\nFurther Reading: Moon Pix Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n65.\n\nMF DOOM: Operation: Doomsday (1999)\n\nIn 1994, after his brother’s sudden death and the cancellation of his group’s album due to its controversial cover, a dejected Daniel Dumile disappeared into the streets of New York City. He resurfaced years later at Nuyorican Poets Cafe, wearing a stocking over his face and performing a new song called “Doomsday,” in which he announced his new, villainous mission “to destroy rap.” Soon, Dumile would ditch the stocking for a metal mask and fully assume his new form: MF DOOM. On his debut album, DOOM drew himself as a self-effacing, mentally disturbed outcast who was hell-bent on seeking revenge on the industry that forced him to hide his face. His absurdism was evident in his punchlines and his production, filled with Scooby-Doo grunts, offbeat drums, and beat drops that acted like comedic rimshots, but DOOM also conveyed tenderness through R&B flips and diaristic lyrics about his late brother. Operation: Doomsday didn’t destroy the rap industry; instead, it paved the way for fellow villainous weirdos to flourish. –Arjun Srivatsa\n\nFurther Reading: Operation: Doomsday Reissue Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n64.\n\nTricky: Maxinquaye (1995)\n\nTricky’s debut album, Maxinquaye, hit No. 3 in the UK album chart and helped spawn a genre—trip-hop—that became synonymous with bourgeois lifestyle music. Yet listening back today, it still sounds more jarring than that legacy would suggest. An unholy fusion of soul, hip-hop, and the soundsystem heritage of Tricky’s native Bristol, the album’s largely languid pacing conceals an undercurrent of dark, chaotic energy. There is torrid sex (“Suffocated Love”), occult rap (“Hell Is Round the Corner”), even a sample of Smashing Pumpkins’ “Suffer” spun into curdled bliss (“Pumpkin”). A cover of Public Enemy’s “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos” is sung insouciantly by Tricky’s muse and romantic partner Martina Topley-Bird atop a bed of full-tilt heavy metal. Tricky himself is largely a phantom presence, directing affairs from the shadows. But where their voices intertwine—hers a sultry blues cry, his a husky, smoked-out whisper—it feels almost indecent. –Louis Pattison\n\nFurther Reading: Maxinquaye Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n63.\n\nR.E.M.: Automatic for the People (1992)\n\nNo band did more to establish the idea of “college rock” and the indie rock ethos than R.E.M. As a young group of Georgia sweeties, the band steadily built a devoted following while rejecting any commercial maneuvers that could sacrifice their artistic drive. When their sound and distribution leverage finally intersected with the mainstream, 1991’s Out of Time made them superstars. But a year later, it was Automatic for the People that set R.E.M. up for immortality.\n\nIt’s ironic, then, that many at the time suspected that frontman Michael Stipe was nearing his end. His gaunt appearance and indeterminate sexuality fueled false rumors that he was dying of AIDS, bolstered by the new album’s sublime grappling with nostalgia, depression, and death. Heart-gripping ballads including “Drive,” “Nightswimming,” and “Everybody Hurts” were made richer in both tragedy and hope by stirring string arrangements from former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Anything but a last gasp, Automatic for the People breathed powerful life into R.E.M.’s ascent for decades to come. –Evie Nagy\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n62.\n\nJuvenile: 400 Degreez (1998)\n\n400 Degreez stands as the ultimate Mannie Fresh production—a sweaty, irresistible ride through the sights and sounds of New Orleans’ Third Ward. The beatmaker always excelled at squeezing the soul and funk out of programmed drums and keyboards, but his partnership with Juvenile—a mealy-mouthed, melodic rapper from the Magnolia Projects—resulted in a mélange of bounce and rap that was darker and more viscous than anything he’d done before. Juvenile would come to Mannie with fully written verses, and Mannie would make beats on the spot that molded to his cadences. The effect is music and voice in total symbiosis: See the album’s masterpiece, “Ha,” where Juvenile’s talky flow dips in and out of Mannie’s groove, a rhythm inside a rhythm. –Mano Sundaresan\n\nFurther Reading: 400 Degreez Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n61.\n\nMassive Attack: Blue Lines (1991)\n\nIn the decade leading up to Blue Lines, Bristol was home to reggae soundsystems, post-punk bohemians, and some of the UK’s earliest converts to hip-hop. Massive Attack emerged from this ferment of overlapping undergrounds. The group’s core of 3D, Daddy G, Mushroom, and Tricky were crate-digging DJs and MCs who’d grown up on 2-Tone and post-punk, and chose to rap using the faltering phrasing of English speech patterns rather than pretend to be American. They were inventing a new archetype of the meditative MC, a British homegrown mode that would blossom with Tricky’s solo album Maxinquaye, the street-level reveries of Mike Skinner, and Dizzee Rascal’s more introspective moments. But while the mumbled flows, samples, and scratching identify Blue Lines as hip-hop, the album’s scope is expansive, embracing soul and reggae with achingly melodic contributions from Shara Nelson and Horace Andy, and nodding to the grandeur of film scores and jazz fusion. Rolling at a languid 90 BPM—or slower—Blue Lines reflects the spliff-tempo metabolism of Bristol’s stoners. Massive were hardly slackers, though; ambitiously conceived and immaculately achieved, the landmark Blue Lines mapped out directions that would define the British ’90s and reverberate to this day. –Simon Reynolds\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n60.\n\nMariah Carey: Butterfly (1997)\n\nFueled by the tantric edging of an extramarital liaison and the pleasure of “finally getting a shot of good Vitamin D,” as she cheekily put it in her memoir, Butterfly is Mariah Carey at 28, reawakened by “breathless and fervid” love affairs, as well as a post-divorce freedom to fully embrace Black genres in her music and write from the heart. She is a babydoll with a tear-soaked pillow; a sexy-ass vixen; a technician and a tone poet. Few but Carey can sing “My All” on a technical level, but Butterfly rarely feels like vocal showboating; her voice weaves textural tapestries over in the cut R&B, and she takes audible pleasure in her instrument’s elasticity. Particularly heavenly is the five-song hang suite at Butterfly’s center, a showcase for the strength she finds in vulnerable sensuality, as well as sympatico with peers like Mobb Deep and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony—collaborators she lavishes in layers of harmony like tweezed gold leaf. –Owen Myers\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n59.\n\nJAY-Z: Reasonable Doubt (1996)\n\nA quarter century later, it’s hard to see JAY-Z as anything but the lordly figure he has become, but his first album is a reminder that nothing about him or his success was inevitable. Inspired by Nas’ Illmatic, the Brooklyn-by-way-of-Trenton, New Jersey high school dropout and drug dealer crafted some of the most crushing tales of poverty, hustling, and street politics in hip-hop history on Reasonable Doubt. The street details are intricate and vivid. The hustler aspires to the big time, but he’s not quite dreaming of a mogul’s life. He takes his wages to Vegas—to bet against Mike Tyson—so he can get a break on his taxes. He buys the whole car and never leases. This is the good life as imagined by someone balanced on the edge between making it and oblivion. –Jayson Buford\n\nFurther Reading: Reasonable Doubt Sunday Review\n\nListen/Buy: Amazon | Apple Music | Spotify | Tidal\n\n58.\n\nSlowdive: Souvlaki (1993)\n\nBy the time frontman Neil Halstead turned up to record Slowdive’s second album, with his iconic shaggy hair shorn off after a “bad acid experience,” it was already clear that the group, once heralded as a boundary-pushing act in the nascent shoegaze scene, was in crisis. Halstead’s relationship with bandmate Rachel Goswell was unraveling, the British music press were beginning to use the group as a punching bag, and Alan McGee, head of their label Creation Records, openly disliked their new songs. Emotions were raw, but that’s always where Slowdive thrive.\n\nSouvlaki has since become a touchstone for virtually every reverb-clouded, feelings-forward act that has come in its wake.
