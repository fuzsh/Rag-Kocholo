        "text": "A&R executive Pete Ganbarg has started a new joint venture with Atlantic Records called Pure Tone Records. Ganbarg will step down as Atlantic’s president of A&R to steer the new launch, in addition to signing and developing artists on the Pure Tone label.\n\nGanbarg will continue to A&R select artists on the Atlantic Music Group roster, including Twenty One Pilots, Shinedown, Gayle and Halestorm, among others. The first artist signed to Pure Tone is platinum Canadian singer/songwriter Forest Blakk, whom Ganbarg originally signed to Atlantic.\n\n“For the past 16 years, Pete has brilliantly led our A&R mission – discovering, signing, and championing a genre-crossing array of hit artists, while also boosting our theatrical presence with a string of award-winning cast albums,” said Atlantic Music Group Chairman and CEO Julie Greenwald and Atlantic Records Chairman and CEO Craig Kallman. “At the same time, he’s mentored and built a fantastic A&R team who are expert at nurturing baby acts and superstars alike. The formation of Pure Tone is an important event for Pete and Atlantic, as he brings his decades of experience, his impeccable taste, and great ears to steering his own ship, and we’re thrilled to be his partners on this exciting next phase of his musical journey.”\n\n“The launch of Pure Tone Records as a standalone label is an exciting moment for me,” said Ganbarg. “It’s the best of both worlds – a golden opportunity to run my own shop, while at the same time having the backing of the outstanding Atlantic team who I’ve worked with so closely over the past 15-plus years. I’m looking forward to making Pure Tone a home for exceptional, original talent, and at the same time, I’m very happy to continue to work with my amazing Atlantic artist roster. I want to thank Julie and Craig for their tremendous support over the years, and for having the faith to join me in this new adventure.”\n\nGanbarg originally formed Pure Tone Music prior to joining Atlantic, as an A&R consulting firm with clients ranging from Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Chaka Khan to Santana, Train, Aaron Neville, Donna Summer, and more.\n\n+ Arista Records has promoted their co-heads of urban music, Kendell “Sav” Freeman and Khris Riddick-Tynes (a 2023 Variety Hitmaker), to senior vice presidents of A&R. Freeman and Riddick-Tynes will continue to operate out of the NY and LA offices respectively and report to David Massey, president.\n\nThe pair were first named VPs and co-heads of urban music in 2021 and have since had a run of success across the roster including the signing and continued development of Lola Brooke and up-and-comer Hurri Haran.\n\nBefore joining the Arista team, Freeman held positions at Maybach Music Group via WMG, Def Jam and Standing Room Only MGMT where he repped multi-platinum artist Flipp Dinero. Riddick-Tynes is best known as a Grammy-winning producer, most recently for his work on SZA’S “Snooze” in addition to his work with Ariana Grande, Drake, Lil Baby, Chris Brown and Rick Ross.\n\n+ Warner Chappell Music (WCM) has announced Delia Orjuela as its new head of creative Mexican music/música Mexicana. Based in Los Angeles, she will report to Gustavo Menéndez, president, U.S. Latin and Latin America, and work with the publisher’s regional Mexican music writers and artists in the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nOrjuela, who most recently co-led WM Latina’s Mexican music division, was instrumental in helping develop WCM songwriter and singer DannyLux (an honoree on Variety‘s 2023 Power of Young Hollywood list). She’ll continue to collaborate closely with the recorded music team and look for cross-collaboration opportunities between the label and publisher.\n\nOrjuela shared: “I have spent most of my career advocating and championing songwriters, and they’ve remained my true passion. Music is incredibly powerful, and I love how a great song with meaningful lyrics can impact people’s lives. I’m so glad to once again be a part of the songwriting process from the beginning, helping to set up collaborations and nurture creative connections. This next step in my career brings everything full circle, and I can’t wait to hit the ground running with Gustavo and the incredible team at WCM.”\n\n+ Empire has tapped Heather Vassar as senior VP of operations, Sarah Beth Gerlecz to director, business and legal affairs, and hired Hannah Galluzzi as director of A&R. In these roles, Vassar will continue to spearhead the hundreds of Empire Nashville releases and expand the roster as Gerlecz remains the dealmaker for Empire Nashville’s label and publishing divisions.\n\n+ The Songwriters Hall of Fame (SHOF) has inducted legendary country songwriter Cindy Walker, who passed away in 2006. The ceremony was featured as a segment during a SHOF Master Session with 2023 SHOF inductee Liz Rose which was hosted by Belmont University’s Mike Curb College of Entertainment and Music Business. The event was co-hosted by SHOF Board Member Fletcher Foster, who also chairs the SHOF Nashville Committee.\n\nDeceased writers to be considered for posthumous induction were included in a special segment of the 2023 ballot. As the annual SHOF gala normally does not include inductions for songwriters after their death, the organization intends to continue hosting future posthumous inductions at unique venues and special events.\n\nBorn on July 20, 1917, Walker boasted numerous hits during her 60+ year career, including “You’re From Texas” and “You Don’t Know Me,” among others. Eddy Arnold, Glen Campbell, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, and Cher, have recorded her songs. She was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in March 2011.\n\n+ Avex USA has invested in artist management company S10 Entertainment, a joint venture between Brandon Silverstein and Jay Z’s Roc Nation that was started in 2017.\n\nAvex USA is a music and entertainment company in Japan while S10 Entertainment is the management division of Silverstein’s S10 music and entertainment holding company that also includes publishing and records divisions. Recent S10 Entertainment successes include Latin superstar Myke Towers.\n\nThe partnership with S10 gives Avex’s Japanese talent access to management teams in the U.S., as they look to develop and break Japanese acts globally, while also providing a route into the Asian market for S10 and Roc Nation.\n\nTuesday, May 7\n\nBreakthrough artist Peso Pluma has signed with CAA for representation in all areas.\n\nPeso’s debut album, “Génesis,” soared to No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, marking the highest-charting Mexican music album in the chart’s history. The album has also garnered a variety of other awards this year, including a Grammy for best música Mexicana album.\n\nIn the past year, Peso also made history as the first Mexican artist to perform at the MTV Video Music Awards and to win the best new artist category at the MTV Europe Music Awards. In 2023, Peso and Eslabon Armado’s hit single “Ella Baila Sola” shattered records by securing the No. 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 list.\n\nPeso is gearing up for his North American tour this summer and headlining major festivals such as the Governor’s Ball, Sueños and Baja Beach Fest. Additionally, his highly anticipated second studio album, “Éxodo,” is set to release this spring.\n\nPeso is managed by George Prajin of Prajin Parlay, Inc.\n\n+ BMG has appointed Kristal McKanders Dube as its new global head of corporate communications.\n\nMcKanders Dube joins BMG after nearly six years at Warner Music Group (WMG) where she led the global communications function at Warner Chappell Music (WCM), the publishing arm of WMG, including overseeing executive and songwriter communications, corporate events and philanthropic initiatives at WMG’s West Coast headquarters in Los Angeles.\n\nBased in LA, McKanders Dube will report to BMG CEO Thomas Coesfeld.

Based at Atlantic’s New York City headquarters, he will report to the label’s co-president of Black Music, Lanre Gaba.\n\nMota comes to Atlantic from Columbia Records where he played a pivotal role on the team that discovered and developed hip-hop stars including Lil Tjay, Polo G, Fivio Foreign, and Joey Bada$$.\n\nMost recently, Mota served as senior VP of A&R at Columbia Records.
