Credited for bringing the new sound of New York City to the masses, the Bronx, NY-native has been proclaimed “the most promising young rapper the city has produced in some time” by The New York Times while boasting nearly 18B global streams and over 50 RIAA platinum and gold certifications to date. With a dynamic catalog of world-renowned hit songs (“My Shit,” “Drowning (feat. Kodak Black),” “Swervin,” “Look Back At It” and more) and 3 critically-acclaimed albums under his belt (HOODIE SZN, THE BIGGER ARTIST and ARTIST 2.0), A Boogie has proven he is one of the music industry’s brightest generational stars. A Boogie has also become one of music’s most in-demand collaborators, working with a wide variety of artists ranging from Ed Sheeran, Maroon 5, and Khalid to Chris Brown, DJ Khaled, Paulo Londra, Meek Mill, Pop Smoke, and more.\n\nSpecial guest: Flo Rida | Born Tramar Dillard on September 17, 1979, Flo Rida was raised by a single mother in Miami's rough neighborhood of Carol City, Florida. Music helped Flo Rida stay on the straight path. His father was a talented musician who encouraged his son to express himself through music. Growing up, Flo Rida was exposed to all kinds of music, thanks in large part to his sisters, some of whom formed a local gospel group. When he was a teenager, Flo Rida found local success rapping with a group called the Groundhoggz. At 18, he became the hype man for Fresh Kid Ice from 2 Live Crew. Eventually, Flo Rida caught the attention of DeVante Swing, formerly of famed R&B group Jodeci, and spent a few years in Los Angeles working with him. Unable to land a record deal, Flo Rida returned home to Miami and, in late 2006, hooked up with Poe Boy Entertainment and its CEO, Elric \"E-Class\" Prince. On December 20, 2006, Flo Rida inked a deal with Atlantic Records and, in 2009, started his own management company, Strong Arm, with longtime friend and manager Lee \" Freezy\" Prince. With the success of his management company, Flo Rida and Lee \"Freezy\" Prince launched their own record label, IMG, in June 2011. With his musical success, Flo Rida got back to his roots of giving back and started \"Big Dreams For Kids,\" a nonprofit foundation that is committed to inspiring future leaders.\n\n2024 Line-up: Slope Fest\n\nComing soon....\n\nSlope Day Programming Board\n\nSlope Day Programming Board\n\nThe Slope Day Programming Board is a student organization made up of students helping plan Slope Day behind the scenes with Campus Activities staff year round. They help coordinate the artist selection from the fall student survey to seeking talent, the attractions on Slope Fest, and any other student component of the day! Follow on Instagram and considering joining Slope Day Programming Board!\n\nSlope Day, a Cornell Tradition\n\nSlope Day, a Cornell Tradition\n\nThere is a long history of a spring-time gathering here at Cornell University. While this event has taken many shapes over the past century, one common thread persists: celebration. Today, the event we affectionately call \"Slope Day\" inherits a proud century-long tradition as a year-end gathering and celebration of the Cornell Community.\n\nFrom The Beginning...\n\n1901 The first recorded \"Spring Day\" takes place. Spring Day was a celebration of the end of winter and imminent warm weather. This tradition continued for the next half century. Over the years, Spring Day was comprised of events ranging from variety shows to circuses. One year there was a mock bullfight; another year students, staff, faculty and guests enjoyed the Fraternity Float parade. While many of these events took place at and were centered around the University's open spaces (including Libe Slope), there were many activities that took place indoors, as well as off campus.\n\n1960 Protests and unrest plagued the University. There was little time and place for any celebration during these years. In addition to nationwide protests and civic discord, many minimum legal drinking age restrictions were lifted. During this time many states began lowering their minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) from their post-prohibition high of twenty one.\n\n1979 Cornell Dining sponsored a barbeque on Libe Slope on the last day of classes and Spring Fest was born. This so-known \"Great Feast\" started in the afternoon, and was centered on a big chicken barbeque and live music. New York State's MLDA of eighteen made it possible for alcohol to be served at Spring Fest, as most Cornell students were over eighteen by the end of the school year.\n\n1984 The federal government passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984, mandating that all states had two years to increase their MLDA to 21 or lose Federal-aid highway funding. New York changed their MLDA because of this act, and so the university's alcohol policy was changed to reflect the change in state law.\n\n1987 Robert Cray band performed at Spring Fest, sponsored by the Cornell Concert Commission.\n\n1988 Spring Fest was cancelled! After too many students admitted to Gannett the year before, the university decided to not hire a musical act.\n\n1989 In the face of these legal changes and the public sentiment that precipitated it, it was no longer feasible for the university to allow the event. Students formed the Springfest Coordinating Committee to promote safe drinking habits and to provide alcohol-free activities as an alternative to drinking.\n\nSlope Day, as it came to be called, became an informal gathering of students on university property. During that time, the focus of Slope Day shifted from food, music and celebration to widespread and uncontrolled alcohol consumption.\n\n1993 An organization, known as SOS, was created in order for students, staff, and faculty to provide a \"positive presence\" on Slope Day. Now known as the Slope Day Volunteer Committee, these volunteers operate as a subcommittee of the Slope Day Programming Board, and fulfill vital roles in the event from working to ensure the safety of those attending, to manning the gates, fence, and checkpoints, distributing water, and keeping the Slope clean. Without student and staff volunteers in their brightly colored t-shirts, Slope Day couldn't happen!\n\n1999 Student opinion surrounding the future of the event began to shift, as evidenced by the creation of SlopeFest, a non-alcoholic activity-based event featuring carnival-type games and rides, live music, free giveaways, and other attractions. SlopeFest, taking place on West Campus, was meant to accompany Slope Day and accommodate students during times when they weren't drinking as well as provide an alcohol-free environment for students desiring one.\n\n2001 Hunter R. Rawlings III, then president of Cornell University, issued a charge to the President's Council on Alcohol and Other Drugs to assemble a group of staff, faculty and students to critically assess and address the role that alcohol and other drugs (AOD) played on Slope Day. This group became known as the Slope Day Steering Committee.\n\n2002 The Steering Committee began to undertake corrective measures to address the alcohol related issues surrounding Slope Day, including moving the concert back onto the slope.\n\n2003 A new and improved Slope Day was created by a Steering Committee of students, faculty, and staff. Live entertainment (Rusted Root and Fat Joe) brought to the Slope, catered food and alcohol service from Cornell Dining, and giveaways became a part of the celebration as well. A student-administration partnership was created, one where students would take the lead in planning and organizing programming and direction for the day. The Slope Day Programming Board was created and funded by the Student Assembly to organize the event and bring bigger and better entertainment to the day.\n\n2004 The celebration continued, with performances by Kanye West and OAR, the return of SlopeFest, and record crowds in attendance.\n\n2005 The Slope Day Programming Board brought The Starting Line, The Game and Snoop Dogg. The bands played for record crowds and Slope Day was a huge success!\n\n2006 Once again, Slope Day was a lot of fun for all, featuring Ben Folds and Talib Kweli with special guest Acceptance. SlopeFest was moved from West Campus to Ho Plaza.\n\n2007 T.I. with special guests TV on the Radio and Catch 22 took the stage and slope by storm. New additions to SlopeFest made it a larger hit than ever before. Prizes were raffled off to winners of certain carnival games before the music began.\n\n2008 Gym Class Heroes brought local flair to the Slope with energetic openers Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and Hot Hot Heat. Even the rain could not keep students from celebrating the end of the semester. Libe Slope became greener with Cornell Dining's switch to biodegradable products (including corn plastic cups).\n\n2009 The Pussycat Dolls took command of the stage as the first all-female act for Slope Day. Openers the Apples in Stereo and Asher Roth pumped the crowds for the main act as neither the threat of rain nor recession could prevent this Slope Day from being enjoyed by the huge audience that attended.\n\n2010 In the Campus Consciousness Tour, Drake headlined with a message of sustainability to a welcoming crowd. The audience was warmed up by the beautiful weather and by openers Francis and the Lights and k-os.\n\n2011 Grammy Award winning hip-hop artist Nelly made sure Slope Day wasn't just a dream for Cornellians. Excellent weather and openers Ra Ra Riot and The Cool Kids brought everyone out to the Slope early to spend time with friends and celebrate the end of another great year.\n\n2012 International star Taio Cruz lit up the Slope like it was dynamite. Supporting artists Neon Trees and The Wailers brought record early crowds out to enjoy the perfect weather and celebrate with the Cornell community.\n\n2013 Hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar headlined Slope Day. Supporting artists included DJ 5 & A Dime and Hoodie Allen.\n\n2014 Ludacris headlined Slope Day with performances by Matt and Kim and 3Lau.\n\n2015 Slope Day was headlined by Chance the Rapper with supporting performances by artists Salva and Magic!\n\n2016 Cash Cash and Walk The Moon took the stage, supported by R-City.\n\n2017 Misterwives and Big Gigantic performed at Slope Day in 2017, supported by Brasstracks + S'Natra.\n\n2018 Galantis, Young Bombs, and Dreezy rocked Slope Day 2018.\n\n2019 Steve Aoki headlined Slope Day with supporting performances from Cousin Stizz and Ezi.\n\n2020 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Slope Day, in collaboration with Cornell Concert Commission and Multicultural Concert Funding Advisory Board, held its first Virtual Slope Day festival spanning over two days. Performances include Swae Lee, Rico Nasty, KYLE, and Matoma.\n\n2021 Virtual Slope Day returned as a two-day event. On night 1, Last Dinosaurs headlined with supporting artists from PREP and MICHELLE. One night 2, there were performances from Ari Lennox, who was the first solo female artist to headline Slope Day, and rap artists Smino and EARTHGANG.\n\n2022 A return to an in-person Slope Day! Aminé headlined Slope Day with supporting performances from Loud Luxury, Luna Li, and Cornell student group After Six. Slope Fest hosted a second stage on Ho Plaza between main stage performances with a DJ, and student groups The Spencer Nachman Band and The Fuse.\n\n2023 Coin headlined Slope Day with supporting performances from Snakehips and Coco & Clair Clair. This year we introduced a new student artist set: student DJ Leong Su Yean '26.\n\nWristbands & Food Tickets\n\nWristbands\n\nWristbands are required by ALL attendees to enter the Slope Day gates - they are your entry ticket.
