Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThose shaping the music industry on the app run the gamut from marketers who pay influencers in an effort to spark a music trend, to artists who have used the app to grow their fan bases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May, producer Vano 3000 jumped into the spotlight on TikTok after his sample of BadBadNotGood's \"Time Moves Slow\" became the soundtrack to a meme. Scottish singer Nathan Evans became a star on the app after a sea shanty trend caught fire. And in late 2020, a group of TikTok users developed a musical version of the Pixar film \"Ratatouille\" that transformed into a full-fledged production.\n\n\"With TikTok, a lot of stuff happens organically,\" said Gaby Fainsilber, head of digital at Crush Music. \"A lot of it is just looking at TikTok constantly, and just seeing what kids are doing on there with our artists and how we can help fuel that.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean artists don't have a plan.\n\n\"These days, for every single artist on the label who's putting out a record, we are strategizing how to make the most out of the TikTok platform,\" RCA Records' SVP of digital marketing Tarek Al-Hamdouni said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is Insider's second annual list of the record labels, artists, marketers, and creators using TikTok to shape the music industry. We spoke with dozens of industry sources for this story to identify professionals that excel at using TikTok to promote music.\n\nHere is the full list for 2021 (listed in alphabetical order):\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAri Elkins, TikTok creator\n\nAri Elkins (TikTok creator)\n\nAri Elkins is a 21-year-old senior at the University of Michigan who's built a following of over 800,000 fans on TikTok by creating music recommendation videos.\n\nElkins' high-energy posts often direct viewers to listen to songs on Spotify, where he has 37 public playlists and about 160,000 followers. His influence on TikTok's music culture, highlighted in a recent Rolling Stone story on the future of music journalism, has since caught the attention of music marketers and festivals that are working with the creator to promote songs and events.\n\n\"My life goal currently is to kind of be this Gen-Z music curator,\" Elkins told Insider. \"Ten years ago you had 'TRL' with Carson Daly where kids my age would tune in. Now your options for new music are Spotify playlists that Spotify created or tuning into TikTok.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarlos A. Cuadros and Tarek Al-Hamdouni, RCA Records\n\nCarlos A. Cuadros (director, digital marketing) and Tarek Al-Hamdouni (SVP, digital marketing)\n\nRCA Records, a label under the umbrella of Sony Music Entertainment, works with a large roster of artists across genres, from Doja Cat and Alicia Keys to Kings of Leon and H.E.R.\n\nThe company's 14-member digital marketing team knows firsthand the power of TikTok as a promotional tool, with performers like Doja Cat regularly driving music trends on the app.\n\nTarek Al-Hamdouni oversees the team, which focuses on online activations, album rollouts, and supporting artists on digital content creation.\n\nCarlos A. Cuadros, who works on Al-Hamdouni's team as director of digital marketing, works on digital strategy with artists like Doja Cat, SZA, Khalid, Alicia Keys, H.E.R., and Jazmine Sullivan, among others. He said the group regularly works with TikTok's music team to understand the best way to promote tracks on the app, whether through livestreamed events, in-app promotions on the sound page, or influencer-marketing campaigns.\n\n\"What we've seen lately is that it's becoming far more common where an unreleased song gets teased on TikTok by the artist,\" Cuadros said. \"This gives us the ability to really jump in early on, get fan reaction, [and] see what the influencer reaction is like.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCesar Toirac, Warner Latina\n\nCesar Toirac (associate director of marketing services)\n\nCesar Toirac is a associate director of marketing services for Warner Latina, a Latin music-focused label within Warner Music Group.\n\nToirac works on social-media strategies for artists like Justin Quiles, Lenny Tavarez, Sofia Reyes, and Zion & Lennox, helping artists build an audience on TikTok by posting and engaging with user videos.\n\n\"I spend a lot of time in my little studio apartment listening to music all day and trying to come up with creative ways on how we can sell a song on TikTok,\" he said.\n\nToirac recently worked on the label's influencer strategy to promote Justin Quiles' track \"Loco\" on TikTok via a dance challenge. He also partnered with TikTok's music team in Latin America to feature Warner Latina's artists in a recent livestreamed concert on the app.\n\nBefore joining Warner, Toirac worked at Facebook and Instagram as a sales manager for record label brands and streaming services. Prior to Facebook, he worked on streaming analytics at Universal Music Group Latin America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChelsea Smith, Warner Music Group\n\nChelsea Smith (digital accounts manager)\n\nChelsea Smith is a digital accounts manager at Warner Music Group, serving as a liaison between digital platform partners like TikTok and the various record labels within Warner.\n\n\"At each label there's a digital marketing team and their focus is pushing content for their roster,\" Smith said. \"They come to us saying, 'We have this new Cardi B, Lizzo track coming out, how do we optimize it on TikTok?'\"\n\nSmith, who works on TikTok strategies under the direction of Warner digital VP Jeff Stevenson, said campaigns on TikTok are often reactive. The team, for example, worked with Canadian rock band Simple Plan after the group's 2002 track \"I'm Just A Kid\" resurfaced as a meme on the app. Simple Plan later created their own version of the trend on their TikTok account.\n\n\"We know everything goes viral on TikTok, and it's hard to make things go viral on your own,\" Smith said. \"If you see something bubbling up, you have to jump on it then because we see TikTok has a direct impact on DSPs (digital streaming platforms) like Spotify, Apple, and YouTube.\"\n\nPrior to joining Warner Music Group, Smith worked at Universal Music Group in the streaming department at Verve Label Group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthan Geltzer, Arista Records\n\nEthan Geltzer (VP, digital marketing)\n\nEthan Geltzer leads the digital marketing team at Arista Records, a label within Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nThe company's roster includes a variety of artists who have had breakout hits on TikTok and other social-media platforms, including Tai Verdes, Yung Bae, Carolesdaughter, and Cody Ko and Noel Miller's Tiny Meat Gang.\n\nArista Records works with its artists to create organic content on the app, while also hiring influencers to boost tracks when it's relevant.\n\nOne of its artists, Tai Verdes, rose to fame on TikTok after his singles \"Stuck in the Middle\" and \"A-O-K\" took off on the app. Another Arista performer, Yung Bae, went viral last year after the track \"Bad Boy\" became a meme.\n\n\"Digital marketing is very reactive,\" Geltzer said. \"It's all about social listening and recognizing those opportunities, and then amplifying it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreddie Morris, 300 Entertainment\n\nFreddie Morris (senior digital director)\n\nFreddie Morris is the senior digital director at record label 300 Entertainment, where he works on digital and social-media strategies for a roster of artists that includes Maria Becerra, Gunna, Waterpark, Young Thug, and $NOT.\n\nMorris told Insider that he's been worked on TikTok since its early days in the US, promoting Maroon 5 and Kendrick Lamar's \"Don't Wanna Know\" back when the app was called Musical.ly.\n\nThe team now uses TikTok to pre-release tracks for 300 Entertainment artists and to help emerging artists build a fan base.\n\n\"Our goal for an up-an-coming artist is not necessarily making a song trend but increasing the follower count,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaby Fainsilber, Crush Music\n\nGaby Fainsilber (head of digital)\n\nGaby Fainsilber is head of digital at Crush Music, a musician management company that works with artists like Sia, Lorde, Green Day, Fall Out Boy, Train, Weezer, Alanis Morissette, and Panic! At The Disco.\n\nFainsilber has been running the company's digital strategy and marketing since 2008, long before TikTok.\n\n\"With TikTok, a lot of stuff happens organically,\" Fainsilber said. \"A lot of it is just looking at TikTok constantly, and just seeing what kids are doing on there with our artists and how we can help fuel that.\"\n\nOne recent viral hit for the company was the resurgence of Sia's 2017 track \"Snowman,\" which entered into the global top ten on Spotify in December 2020 due to a TikTok challenge that had users singing the song in one breath.
