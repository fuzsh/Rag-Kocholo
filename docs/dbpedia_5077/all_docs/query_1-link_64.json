However, ASKM is open to representing and working with all songwriters, composers and artists of all genres. I, A'Ishah Songstress am more than just an independent music publisher. I'm a songwriter, composer, pianist, vocalist, author, music historian and artist myself. I've been singing since 9 years old. I've been writing songs since I was 13 years old, which is the same year I decided to start studying the business side of music. I'm also a classically trained vocalist, although R&B music is my 1st love. I've been classically trained since 16 years old. The same age I learned music theory and started to compose music. One of the main reasons I decided to get into music publishing and start my own company was due to the constant \"\"no's\"\" I was receiving from established industry producers and managers when I would shop my demos. I noticed as long as I was viewed as an unknown songwriter and singer I would never make any progress. So I soon decided to join ASCAP, learn the business side of the industry and start a brand and company where my music would speak for itself, while also inspiring others. My vision at ASKM Publishing is to enable other songwriters, composers and artists with the proper tools and resources to prosper. This includes behind and in front of the scenes within the music industry. Although I advocate for being an independent music artist and controlling your own career, this also includes mainstream success.\n\n11.

With that thought in mind, in 2012 David officially began bringing together what would become the Flexitone Records you have today. But Flexitone is not your typical music label...we operate in a slightly different and unique way. In the music business we live in today, it is all about one thing: the single. With this in mind, Flexitone approaches the industry by signing the song, not the artist. The singles our artists create are fantastic, and they deserve more attention and effort than the artists themselves can give them. And thats where Flexitone comes in - our mission is to represent the best tracks from the best independent regional, national, and international artists. Were the support system that specializes in guiding and promoting their single on a grassroots level. Our experience, combined with our in-house radio, publishing, and promotions team gives Flexitone the ability to provide our releases with the best exposure and promotion available.\n\n20.
