Bench seating is provided free of charge, but it is limited. Since seating is first-come first-served, we ask that you don't save full benches in the hours leading up to show times. We encourage audience members to bring their own chairs.\n\nIn addition to our Seaside Concert Series, we will also host movies and bonfires on the beach. All events are weather dependent and subject to beach conditions.\n\nBe among the first to find out what's going on by visiting our official social media sites:\n\nFacebook: @visitbethanybeach\n\nInstagram: @bethanybeachevents\n\nTwitter: @bethanybeachfun\n\nYouTube: @BethanyBeachGov\n\nFor questions about town happenings, call Events Director Julie Malewski at 302-539-8011, ext. 123.\n\nJune 6th, 7:30 pm\n\nDave Matthews Tribute Band\n\nTheir name says it all: The Dave Matthews Tribute Band. For nearly 20 years, the band has been performing sold out shows around the world; playing over 1,500 dates in 46 states and 8 countries.

This 5-piece ensemble strives to pay homage to their famous counterparts by matching the excitement, energy, intensity and intimacy of a DMB live show. While most fans never witnessed the real band before they became the platinum-selling artists they are today, The Dave Matthews Tribute Band prides itself on giving audiences this opportunity at intimate venues around the world. Beyond mastering the DMB sound and the relentless touring, what separates The Dave Matthews Tribute Band from other cover bands is their passion, love, and respect for DMB and their music.

Don’t miss it!\" Both he and Mr. Dugmore (Ms. Ronstadt’s longtime steel guitarist) have produced tracks for, and are also featured on, the band’s latest album (which also includes contributions from Linda’s nephew, the noted cellist, Michael G.
