        "text": "How I Got a Meeting With a Record Label (And It Went Nowhere)\n\nYes, I did get a meeting with a record label… and nothing happened. I’m going to explain how I got a meeting with a major label, and why nothing happened.\n\nEVERYONE WANTS TO GET SIGNED, BUT IS IT STILL WORTH IT?\n\nWe all know someone trying to make it in the music business. Thanks to the world of technology we live in, the industry has become over-saturated with millions of aspiring singers, producers, songwriters, musicians, DJ’s, etc.\n\nLiterally anyone with a smartphone and a Wi-Fi connection can fill out their social media bio and give themselves whatever title they wish to be called. With too much supply and not enough demand, no wonder so many aspiring artists are getting discouraged while in pursuit of their dreams.\n\nWHY YOU’RE BETTER OFF AS AN INDEPENDENT ARTIST\n\nThe new way of thinking is very much in favor of DIY (Do It Yourself).\n\nIt’s all about taking matters into your own hands now. Stop whining, stop complaining, and stop looking for someone to “put you on.”\n\nUnfortunately, artists that are signed to major record labels get significant advantages that independent artists don’t get to enjoy. Such as the financial resources and media connections that come from the power of being backed by a label.\n\nAll of that being said, the truth is that you definitely don’t need to be signed to become successful anymore.\n\nYes of course it helps in some aspects, but there are many pros and cons to either side of being independent versus getting signed.\n\nOne major difference is the mindset. Waiting around to “get discovered” (Yes I was once naive enough to think that was possible) versus GO out there, bust your ass every day, be fearless of rejection, and go make something happen for yourself.\n\nHOW DID I GET A MEETING WITH ATLANTIC RECORDS?\n\nWith that being said, I somehow ended up in a situation last year that landed me a meeting at Atlantic Records.\n\nIt was completely unexpected and rare. My mental picture of a label office consisted of a bunch of greasy suits sitting around a huge corporate conference table scheming about the best ways of maximizing profits from every angle. Of course, this is the MUSIC BUSINESS – the for-profit monetization of distributing recorded music.\n\nRelated Read: Check out the best recording studios in NYC.\n\nHOW TO GET A LABEL MEETING: YOU NEED CONNECTIONS\n\nYou’ve heard it before, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”\n\nThat proves to be all true and powerful in the music business, but I would say it even goes a step further than just who you know.\n\nIt’s who you know that believes they can PROFIT by helping you. Let that sink in.\n\nEveryone is talented these days, but that’s not enough. Whenever you meet an A&R, manager, music publicist, etc, what they ultimately want to assess is your commercial viability. How likely are you to be commercially profitable?\n\nAN ATTORNEY PLUGGED ME INTO ATLANTIC RECORDS\n\nSo, through the wonderful power of the internet, a relative of a high school friend of mine came across my music and reached out.\n\nShe believes in me greatly, and wanted to help. She had a connection to some attorneys who were previously successful in entertainment law.\n\nThrough a series of emails and introductions, my music package ended up in the hands of a well connected music attorney in LA.\n\nFor non-disclosure and legal purposes, let’s just say his name is… Professor X.\n\nAfter lots of discussion with Professor X, he felt that I had massive potential and said I was a “rare find.” What a compliment.\n\nFrom there, Professor X set up a meeting in New York between myself and his A&R buddy at Atlantic.\n\nDAY OF THE MEETING WITH ATLANTIC RECORDS\n\nI’ve got my acoustic guitar, press kit, and confidence as I go up the elevator. Slight feeling of knots in my stomach and heart beating fast, but that’s normal.\n\nI get off the elevator and saw those huge glass doors. Those doors that I’ve seen in other people’s Instagram pics so many times before with the overtly corny hashtag #meetings in the caption.\n\nWell it was finally my turn to walk through those doors.\n\nWALKED THROUGH THE FAMOUS GLASS DOORS\n\nI’m greeted by a stand offish dude that looked like he just finished jamming to old 90s Nirvana tunes in his mom’s basement. After 30 minutes of waiting, I’m finally greeted by the A&R.\n\nFor non-disclosure purposes, let’s call him Doctor Robotnik.\n\nSo, I’m at the conference table sharing my music career history with Doctor Robotnik. We talk about some of my accomplishments, things that have shaped my musical influences, latest shows, production accolades, etc.\n\nFinally, I play him 3 records. Then, I busted out the acoustic guitar and rocked out for about 10 minutes. He was complimenting me up and down about what a unique sound I have, and how he wanted to get me in the studio with Cee Lo Green and Trey Songz.\n\nFollowing that, we continued talking for another half hour or so. Discussing my potential as a songwriter and producer.\n\nDoctor Robotnik was a fan of my versatility, especially my vocal arrangements and musicianship. I was down for that. I just wanted to build and see where the road could lead.\n\nAt the end of a near 2 hour meeting, I had all the reason in the world to be optimistic.\n\nTHEY GHOSTED ME 😂\n\nDays, weeks, then finally a month goes by and I haven’t heard from Doctor Robotnik or Professor X.\n\nI tried the usual email and text follow up, but got totally ignored. A complete cold shoulder.\n\nNeedless to say, I was confused and disappointed. I was looking forward to getting in the studio with some new people and building. I wasn’t expecting to become the next superstar overnight. I’m a smart guy with realistic expectations, but I was puzzled as to why I was getting snubbed.\n\nMonths later, I attended an industry event and ran into the same Atlantic Records A&R who ghosted me. He saw me, looked down at the floor, and passed by with no acknowledgement.\n\nNow, I’m a man of respect and dignity. In my world, there’s no excuse for a grown man being that immature and petty. As an artist, I’m always trying to get better. I would prefer to receive the constructive criticism and learn from it.\n\nI GOT A MEETING WITH A RECORD LABEL AND NOTHING HAPPENED\n\nSo that was that. It’s a sketchy industry. It happens. But who cares? Just be you. Continue to work hard, stay humble, believe in yourself and your gifts, because the only person that can deny you is yourself."
