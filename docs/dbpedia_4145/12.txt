STRONG SECOND HALF LEADS MEN’S SOCCER TO 2-2 EXHIBITION TIE

RADFORD, Va. – After falling behind early, Radford scored a pair of second-half goals to play Appalachian State to a 2-2 exhibition tie in men's soccer action Sunday afternoon at Cupp Stadium.

Trailing 1-0 at the break, the Highlanders got second-half strikes from freshman Luis Grande (Caracas, Venezuela) (62nd minute) and junior Anthony Payne (Manassas, Va./Osbourn Park) (81st minute) to conclude their first of three pre-season tune ups deadlocked.

The two teams agreed prior to the contest to play two 45 minutes halves regardless of the score at the end of regulation.

Grande's goal was set up by a flick from Iyiola Awosika (London, England/Aylesbury Grammar) from just outside the box, while Payne's late equalizer came off a long Bernardo Ulmo (Sao Paulo, Brazil/South Kent) cross over the defense.

Appalachian State finished with a 10-7 edge in shots, while both teams attempted two corner kicks.

Chad Dalton's header off a Luis Calzadilla corner gave the Mountaineers a 1-0 advantage just 18 minutes into the game.

Shortly after Grande evened the score 1-1, Antonio Harley put away a Sean Dreybus shot attempt, which caromed off the fingers of Highlander goalkeeper Joey Dennis (Manassas, Va./Osbourn Park) to push Appalachian State back in front with just over 20 minutes remaining.

Dennis, who split time with Ryan Taylor in goal, finished with a game-high three saves.

Radford will continue its pre-season slate with a 4 p.m. match at in-state foe James Madison Wednesday afternoon in Harrisonburg.
