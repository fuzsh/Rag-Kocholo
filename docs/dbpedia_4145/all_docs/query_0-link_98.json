Friday, October 10, 2008 and following the service at St. James Episcopal Church in Lake City. Father Hall was born in Tampa, FL on August 26, 1928 and grew up in Plant City, FL. Upon graduation from Plant City High School, he entered Stetson University where he earned a BA in 1949. Responding to a call to ordained ministry, he moved to New Haven, CT to study at Yale Divinity School. He graduated from Yale University with the Bachelor of Divinity in 1953 and a Master of Sacred Theology in 1955. In 1980, he earned the Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of the South (Sewanee). During his time at Yale University, Father Hall met his future wife, Margaret Ann MacLennan. They were married in Toronto, Canada on November 26, 1955, and lived in New York City where Father Hall was serving as minister and working with troubled youth at the Judson Memorial Church, Washington Square, New York City. Father Hall returned to Florida where he assisted the rector at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, Gainesville, FL. Father Hall was ordained as an Episcopal priest on September 18, 1958, by the Rt. Rev. E. Hamilton West, Diocese of Florida. In 1958 Father Hall served as the Bishop's Vicar in St. Michael's Mission Parish, Gainesville, FL and continued to serve as St. Michael's first priest until 1964. From 1964 to 1966, he served as Assistant Rector of St. Marks Episcopal Church, Jacksonville, FL, before being called to St. James Episcopal Church, Lake City, FL in June 1966. Father Hall served Rector of St. James for 27 years until his retirement in 1994. Throughout his ministry, the many positions he filled on committees in the Diocese of Florida have touched the lives of many people, particularly his work as Chairman of the Bishop's Advisory Committee on Admission to the Ordained Ministry for 18 years, and Chairman of Continuing Education for the Clergy. Father Hall was also involved in many civic and philanthropic organizations and was extremely active in prison ministries. Upon retirement, he enjoyed traveling to visit his grandchildren in Louisiana, attending various Elder Hostels listening to operas and classical music, and of course, reading his many books. He remained very active in retirement serving as Diocesan Historian, supplying for vacationing clergy, and filling in during vacancies at St. Mary's, Madison, FL; St. James, Perry, FL and Grace Episcopal Church in Monroe, LA. In his final years, Father Hall moved to the Advent Christian Village retirement community in Dowling Park, FL. He became quite active there and was responsible for starting the \"History of Florida\" course. In an age when so many things are considered temporary or expendable, his example has proven to all of us that steadfastness is found in a life of faithful service. His selfless giving to others endeared him to all who knew him and he leaves many family and friends to mourn his loss. Father Hall was preceded in death by his wife of 38 years, Margaret Ann MacLennan Hall, who died February 9, 1993. He is survived by his daughter, Margaret Hall Zentner and her husband, Dr. Scott D. Zentner, Monroe, LA; son, Bill Hall and his wife Beverly of Palatka, FL; sister, Josephine Hall Spears of Palm Beach Gardens, FL; sisters-in-law, Effie MacLennan McCombe and Jane Grimes MacLennan, Ontario, Canada; two beloved grandchildren, McLaurine \"Mac\" Hall Zentner and Margaret Ann Zentner of Monroe, LA; and numerous nieces, nephews and great-nieces and nephews.
