        "text": "Corgi Aviation Archive 1/72 scale AA33001: Vought F4U-1A Corsair in the superb markings of “Daphne C” of the VMF-213 Hell Hawks, as flown by ace pilot James N Cupp, Solomon Islands 1943. Non limited edition. Boxes may have the odd light scuff, crease or score line but nothing that detracts.\n\nLength 5.5 inches Wingspan 6.75 inches\n\nIn March of 1943, VMF-213 arrived in the Solomons, equipped with Wildcats, but re-equipped with Corsairs before entering combat. With 13 kills, Captain Cupp was one of the highest scoring aces of this outfit. Cupp claimed his first two kills (a “Betty” and a “Zero”) in this aircraft on 15th July 1943 during his second tour. The aircraft wears a white 7 in place of the previous number just forward of the national insignia. The old style black 13 is still faintly visible under the canopy and on the cowl. The aircraft bears four kill marks representing Cupp’s next victories claimed on the 17th in F-4U1B No.02580. He was shot down on the 18th September and after bailing out he was picked up by the Americans and spent 18 months in hospital undergoing 14 operations.\n\nDesigned to meet a US Navy requirement for a single-seat carrier based fighter, the F4U was first flown on May 29th, 1940. This versatile aircraft saw service with both the Navy and Marine Corps in WW II and in the Korean War. During its lifetime, the Corsair underwent numerous improvements such as a lengthened fuselage, a high visibility bubble-top canopy and folding inverted gull wings that provided clearance for a large propeller. Its performance advantage, 400 mph capability, the ability to withstand punishment and six .50 Browning machine guns made the F4U a devastating weapon against aircraft, ground targets and ships."
