Ouilda was born on May 9, 1916 in Illinois Bend, Texas. She was the 3rd child of Russell and Myrtle Arthur of Leon, Oklahoma. Her early years were spent on the family farm. She worked and played alongside all of her brothers and sisters and had many fond memories of her siblings. Ouilda attended school at Leon where she met her future husband, Garnet Petty. She and Garnet were married in Marietta on July 1, 1931. She often mentioned how she married the most handsome boy in Leon. Their marriage was blessed with four children, Media June, Garnet Wallace (Buddy), Norma Jean, and Brenda Jane. Ouilda and Garnet lived in Leon where they grew peanuts, cotton, and corn. She also found time to raise hogs and chickens. She was known around the county as an excellent seamstress. Ouilda designed and made baby clothes that she sold during The Depression. Her baby clothes were ordered by people from all parts the country. Her life was turned upside down on September 9, 1956 when her husband, Garnet, unexpectedly died at the age of 44. She sold their home in Leon and moved with her youngest daughter to Topeka, Kansas. Ouilda then began her career as a florist at Stanleys Flowers. She worked as a florist for 42 years in Topeka, Tulsa, Marietta and Ardmore. She designed flowers for Harry Truman, Gerald Ford, and several Kansas governors. Ouilda married John Norman Green on July 20, 1968 in Topeka, Kansas. John was a minister with the Methodist Church, recently assigned to a church in Robinson, Kansas. While in Robinson, John taught her how to drive. This began her love for cars. Tragically, their life together was short lived as he died just two years later on August 8, 1970. She spent the last 44 years of her life in Carter and Love Counties. She loved to work in her yard, design flowers, and make quilts. Her favorite pastimes were watching NASCAR and the Texas Rangers. In 2000, Ouilda moved to Ardmore. The last few years of her life were her happiest as she was able to live with her family. She loved being around family and loved getting to spend time with her great-great grandchildren. Ouilda was a woman of great faith and she set an example for her family. She loved reading her bible and in her earlier years taught Sunday school. At the time of her death, she attended Victory Life Church Ardmore. In addition to her husbands, Ouilda was preceded in death by her parents, as well as six brothers; Jack, Adrian, Cecil, Ray, Bennett, and Byron, and four sisters; Cleda, Cecile, Esther, and Thelma Faye.
