        "text": "Introduction\n\nIt is estimated the Confederate Army captured 5,000 Federal prisoners at the battle of Gettysburg, not including wounded. The '13th Mass' reported 98 men captured. The loss was so great in General John C. Robinson's 2nd Division it caused Colonel Charles Wainwright, Chief of First Corps artillery to muse; “All the regiments look very small & some of them have disappeared altogether; three of the 2d Division were captured entire.”1 Facing a difficult retreat, General Robert E. Lee tried to parole the prisoners on the battle-field to alleviate the difficulty of guarding and feeding so many men in addition to his own troops. It is estimated that about 1,500 Yankees accepted the parole, though their own officers told them that the parole was 'illegal' and would not be honored by the authorities in Washington.\n\nA shaky agreement for the exchange of prisoners had been accepted on July 22, 1862 by a cartel of representatives from both sides, chosen to negotiate the terms. On May 25, 1863, General-in-Chief Henry Halleck ordered the exchanges stopped because of a disagreement with Jeff Davis about the treatment of captured Negro troops. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton re-enforced this understanding to the Federal Army, with General Orders No. 207, July 3rd 1863, “declaring that all such paroles were in violation of general orders, and therefore null and void; declaring further that any soldier accepting such parole would be returned to duty and punished for disobedience of orders.” 2\n\nPictured, Secretary of War Edwin W. Stanton.\n\nThe Federal soldiers captured at Gettysburg were offered a battle-field parole by the Confederates. The Union officers present advised the captives not to take the parole; that it was not legitimate and it would not be recognized by the government. Still, according to Private Bourne Spooner, about one half the prisoners corralled with him, took it, —which proved to be lucky for them! It is guessed that of the estimated total of 5,000 Federal captives, about 1,500 dis-obeyed the recommendation of their officers and accepted the parole. These soldiers started off July 4th under a Confederate guard, and marched to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, then onto West Chester, where a temporary parole camp, Camp Elder, awaited them. After a time spent in camp, many of the Massachusetts boys made their way home from here, some by hook or crook, and others by waiting several weeks and following orders. By accepting the parole these men gained an unexpected respite from the war via an improvised furlough.\n\nThe officers and others that obeyed orders and refused the battle-field parole endured a wretched two week forced march to Staunton, Virginia, with little or nothing to eat. The leg of the journey from Williamsport to Staunton, was succinctly described by Captain William Wilkins, 1st West Virginia Cavalry who joined the column of prisoners July 5 at Hagerstown.\n\n“Our march from Williamsport to Staunton comprised the whole length of the Shenandoah valley, which is the best watered region I have ever traveled in; yet we suffered horribly for water. I saw the men, 8 or 10 at once, after having been nearly famished for water, break from the ranks to procure a drink from a spring or a pump by the edge of the road, and, in every case, they were immediately driven back at the point of the bayonet, without having time to get a drop. It was pitiable, to see them go along, cups in hand, ready to dip and drink from every little mud-puddle or stagnant pool that came within reach; and this, too, in one of the best watered countries in the world...\n\n“And how did you stand it?' That question was asked me more than one-hundred times on the road. I answered that nothing kept me up but the resolution that I had formed — never to give up till I fell dead in my tracks — This I told our men, together with the strong and unconquerable desire I had to get back and fight them (the rebs) again which kept me up, but it was by the hardest that I got through several times I reeled and staggered like a drunken man; my head became dizzy, my sight failed me; I almost sunk to the earth — Once I caught hold of my comrade, and steadied myself for a few minutes, and then traveled on again, staggering at every step till a halt was ordered. Toward the last of the tramp, I suffered very much with my feet, for not being used to walking any in the last two years they soon became so blistered that I could not wear my boots and had to take it barefooted. Being on a McAdamized pike, I soon became badly crippled. My feet took to swelling and every step I took pained me to the very heart — but I must hurry along.”3\n\nAt Staunton the prisoners, estimated to be about 3,500 - 4,000 in number, camped in a hot treeless field overlooking the railroad depot south of town, exposed to the elements, where they waited for rickety rail cars to carry them 136 miles to Richmond. The trains could only carry about 700 men at a time, and exhausted soldiers often had to push and fight their way into line in order to get a chance at boarding the cars. Believing they would be exchanged and released from captivity the sooner they got to Richmond, many were willing to to do so. It took more than nineteen days, between July 19 and August 6, to clear the prisoners out of Staunton via the railroad. In Richmond their fates varied. Many officers were confined at Libby Prison, a large dark tobacco warehouse along a canal beside the James River. Others were transferred to prisons in the deep south to alleviate the over-crowded prisons in Richmond. Enlisted men were sent to Belle Isle, a 6-7 acre Island in the James River, with 2-3 acres set aside as a prison camp.\n\nThere is plenty of primary source material from the '13th Mass' on this page. The stories are divided into two sections, those who accepted the parole and those who did not.\n\nPrivates Bourne Spooner, William A. Newhall, and Sergeant Warren Freeman, took the parole. Their letters and memoirs begin this page. A short bit about Camp Elder, the parole camp in West Chester, Pennsylvania that was their destination, is included in this part of the narrative.\n\nSergeants George Henry Hill, John Boudwin and Lieutenant Morton Tower did not take the parole and were marched south. They also recorded their experiences in letters, diaries, and memoirs which are presented on this page. In between these stories from the regiment is a rare description of the railroad trip from Staunton to Richmond, as reported by William E. Warren of the 17th Connecticut Infantry.\n\nEleven other ‘13th Mass’ comrades are specifically mentioned in these narratives, which helps to add a bit of detail to their military records. Information about these soldiers is listed in Part III; Soldiers' Biographies, at the bottom of this page.\n\nPrivate Bourne Spooner mentions, Alfred M. Burton. Sergeant Warren H. Freeman mentions Edgar C. Reed. Sergeant George Henry Hill mentions, Lieutenant Samuel E. Cary, Lieutenant David Whiston, Corporal John B. Curtis, and Private Henry W. Metcalf. Sergeant John Boudwin mentions Corporals Albert E. Morse and Edward A. Boyd, and Privates John C. Clark, Fred D. Locke, and Charles Christopher MacGraw. The experiences of these men is as varied as their number. The stories of officers Cary & Whiston lead the biographies from this group, as they lingered the longest in Southern prisons.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

While traveling through New York on board a steamer, he references the bloody New York Draft Riots that were then in progress. More about this will be forthcoming on a future page of this website. This manuscript was shared with me by Mr. Will Glenn, a descendant of Private Spooner.\n\n“In The Ranks”\n\nTranscribed by Maxine Glenn.\n\nNext day [July 4th] we were up at betimes and en route for Carlisle in the Cumberland Valley. Our escort was a squad of four or five rebel cavalrymen under the lead of sergeant who carried a flag of truce, i.e., a white handkerchief tied to a stick. We streamed along the road without any attempt at the formation of a column, and our rebel escort had great difficulty in keeping many of the men from pushing forward in advance of the main body. They time and again threatened to shoot, especially at halts, when some of the more irrepressible spirits persisted in streaming on in advance of them. Indeed, it was a novel and strange march to all of us - proceeding in a free and easy manner with no other restriction than in not pushing ahead of the guards. “Give us a gun to carry,” said some of them, “and ’twill seem more natural.”\n\nAs we proceeded through this rich and fertile region, the loyal people, especially womankind, furnished us with food from their doors as we passed. Huge slices of bread and “apple butter” (Shaker applesauce) were the principal articles of food. After our hard soldier fare and fasting this food was perfectly delicious and was eaten with great voracity. Another thing to be remembered was that this day was our great national anniversary, the Fourth of July. Towards noon, I believe, it began to rain, and thereafter it increased in force and in the middle of the afternoon came down in drenching sheets. But the rain was nothing to us. We were a jolly crowd, traveling pretty much upon our own hook, and the condition of the elements in nowise affected us. As we neared Carlisle we passed through some very picturesque defiles in the mountains. During the latter part of our journey we met considerable bodies of the Pennsylvania militia, moving to the front. Their new uniforms, if nothing else, would distinguish them from the regular volunteers; but their great discomfort in consequence of the rain made them the subject of many jocose remarks. In passing one of the mountain gorges, the effect of its picuturesqueness was much heightened by a sharp thunderstorm which prevailed at the time.\n\nWe reached Carlisle before dark and spent some time in roaming about the city. Several of the houses bore the marks of shells, which had been thrown into the city by a rebel force under Fitz Hugh Lee before it surrendered. We were quartered that night in empty wash-houses, etc., and the next day, I believe, furnished with transportation up to Harrisburg and thence on eastward to Westchester where we were formed into a parole camp. Our train was composed of baggage cars, and a portion of us, I among the rest, rode on top. We reached Westchester towards night and were first enclosed in an open space within the limits of the village surrounded by a board fence. The next day we were removed to a field where there was a stream of water and some shade trees running through it for our camp. A small force of militia were set guard over the camp and whom the boys were disposed to treat with contempt.\n\nJust how many days I spent at this place I don’t know, but I don’t think it could have been over two. I believe I enjoyed the luxury of a bath in the stream, and I also remember visiting a cherry tree nearby and filling myself with its now ripe and luscious fruit - a thing we had hardly tasted of for two years. About noon four of us belonging the 13th concluded we would cut camp and steer for home as many of the men had already done. We acted at once upon the suggestion. A little before one o’clock we managed to elude the guards, and after proceeding a mile or so from camp on the north side we sat down by the roadside to consult our future course. Many of those who left the camp hired themselves out as harvest hands, as the fields of that region were now yellow with the ripened grain. We concluded it was best for us to avoid Philadelphia (about twenty-five miles to the east) and other large cities because we were technically deserters, and provost marshals and guards were always on the watch at these places for absentees from the army. We therefore concluded to strike diagonally across the country in the direction New York. Our united funds did not exceed a few dollars, and of course only our legs could be relied upon for getting to our distant homes. Before we started, however, an organ grinder happened to come along, and we had him play us a few tunes for diversion. Then we proceeded on our tramp, and before we turned in for the night we had traversed over twenty miles. At last, long after dark, we clambered into the haymow of an old barn by the side of the road where we found a comfortable night’s rest. About daylight the owner of the barn came round to do his chores, when one of the boys slid down from the mow to make his acquaintance. This so startled the man that he immediately “streaked” for the house.\n\nAfter enjoying a little laugh over this event we began our second day’s journey. Without gun, knapsack, haversack or any of our usual impediments we made excellent progress with the greatest of ease. We were not by any means deserters, in spirit or in fact. We retained our blue uniforms, when we easily might have substituted a citizen’s dress, and passed openly along the road by daylight. In passing through a place where some quarrymen were engaged, I believe in getting out iron ore, one of the number treated us to a glass of …..\n\n(The last page of the narrative has been damaged. The following are the portions that are still legible.)\n\nWe were fortunate in finding a …[steamer?]…… bound for Stamford, Connecticut, whose skipper was as ….. and whole souled a tar as ever breathed, whose name I think was Johnson. We did not get underway, I think, until afternoon. At this time the great anti-draft riots were in progress in New York. The captain cautioned us to keep below the rail, as gangs of roughs were constantly cruising about in boats, eager to wreak their vengeance upon any “boys in blue” whom they might by chance discover. We lay that night in the stream beyond the Battery. The city from the water front looked dark and sombre, few lights were to be seen, the rioters at this time having the lower wards of the city pretty much at their mercy, though their brief reign of blood was nearly at an end. An ominous silence seemed to hang over all. However, we were not molested and the next day had a most pleasant sail along the East River, through Hell Gate, and down the Sound. The captain was genial and full of anecdotes and instead of taking the fare we had bargained to pay gave us a dollar himself. It was bright and balmy Sunday when we entered Stamford Harbor…..\n\nAfter getting ashore we …. I wandered ….. ground depot, and when the night train ….. came along I got aboard. I did not purchase a …… ticket before getting into the cars, as I had not money enough to take me home and trusted to luck in getting over the road; and, as good luck would have it, I happened to sit right down in the seat with my fellow prisoner, Burton, who had left the parole camp only the day before and had come right through direct via Philadelphia and New York, braving the provost marshals, who, however, did not molest him. He loaned me a half dollar, which, with the money I possessed, came within twelve cents I think of the requisite fare, and the conductor, after hesitating a moment, passed me through to Boston. I walked out to Dorchester and caused a genuine surprise to the folks there. I duly reported myself at the state House, and was able to secure a very pleasant furlough, all in consequence of my capture at Gettysburg.\n\nReturn to Top of Page\n\nLetters of Warren Freeman & William Newhall;\n\nParole Camp, West Chester, PA\n\nLetter of Corporal Warren Freeman, July 7th, 1863\n\nFor the first time since before the battle of Gettysburg, Sergeant Warren Freeman was able to write a letter home, from the Parole Camp in West Chester. These letters are from the book, “Letters From Two Brothers Serving In The War For The Union,” Cambridge, 1871.\n\nLetter of Private William A. Newhall, July 8, 1863\n\nPrivate Newhall, of Company F, also wrote home to family from the parole camp to let them know he was alive and well after the battle of Gettysburg. At the end of his letter he mentions George Atkinson's death. Charles Roundy who was also in Company F, identified 'Greasy Cook' Atkinson as the hero of the story, 'General Hartsuff and the Baked Beans' which he included in his memoirs. You can read the story as told by historian Charles E. Davis, Jr. on the website here.\n\nWilliam A. Newhall survived the war. He mustered out of the '13th Mass' on August 1, 1864 with the rank of corporal, Company F. He settled in Hudson, Mass. This is the only letter transcription I have from him.\n\nThis transcription of Newhall's letter [done by someone else] at the end of page 5 said “Captain Pierce is wounded in the knee.” I changed this to “Captain Palmer.” I do not have a copy of the hand-written letter so this is an informed guess on my part. Private Newhall was in Company F, from Marlboro, and would have known Captain Palmer, who organized Company I, in the same town. Captain Palmer was badly wounded in the knee at Gettysburg. Captain Elliot C. Pierce of Company H, was attached to the First Corps Ambulance train. As far as I know he was not wounded at Gettysburg and he is not listed in Lt.-Col. Batchelder's report of officers present at the battle. According to that list, I think Sam E. Cary was the ranking officer of Co. F at the battle. - B.F., webmaster, 2/23/2017.\n\nThe Site of Parole Camp Today\n\nPrivate Spooner and his friends were technically deserters, when they left the parole camp and headed home. But they fared far better than many of the soldiers, like Warren Freeman, who obeyed orders and stayed in the Parole Camp. These soldiers lingered for weeks waiting for the government to act, - to figure out how to deal with this 'illegal parole,' and in the course of time, some of the men took sick and died. Extended time spent in any confined place was never healthy during the Civil War.\n\nIn 2013, a state historic marker was dedicated to commemorate the site of the Parole Camp in Westtown, Pa. near where the camp was located.\n\nThe new historical marker commemorating the camp states that more than 2,000 soldiers were held here. Warren Freeman wrote, “We have moved camp since I wrote you last; we are now about a mile and a half from the town, on the West Chester and Philadelphia Railway; the cars run about as often as they do at West Cambridge, and I can lay in my tent and see them pass by – the prospect is quite pleasant.”\n\nThe new marker is located near the corner of Oakburne Road and Trellis Lane in Westtown. Google maps shows the railroad runs right by the location.\n\nThis photo was taken by Ginger Rae Dunbar for the West Chester Daily Local News. Click the image to view larger.\n\nLetter of Warren Freeman, July 12, 1863\n\nImage of the general area where Camp Elder was located.\n\nLetter of Warren Freeman, July 17, 1863\n\nSome of the boys took the parole offered and some didn't. The parole was offered to the prisoners on more than one occasion, as the large bodies of men were consolidated on the battle-field. It is interesting that Warren states in this letter that of the squad of about 600 men corralled with him on July 2nd, all of them accepted the parole. When the parole was again offered the next day after the prisoners had been consolidated, George Hill says, “We were now offered a parole but our Officers declined to accept it and so did 35 of us, the rest did take it, with what result I have not yet learned.”\n\nParole Camp, West Chester, Pa., July 17, 1863\n\nDear Father, - I acknowledge the receipt of two letters from home, also one from Uncle Washington, and one from Eugene. For these favors you will please accept a soldier’s thanks.\n\nIn reply to your queries about my treatment by the rebels, I would say that they did not take my watch nor money, - nothing, except, of course, my rifle and equipments; neither did they laugh and jeer at us, as I have seen our men do to them under similar circumstances. After our capture we were marched back on the pike road about two miles, and halted at the side of the road near one of the wagon trains, the Eleventh South Carolina Regiment, which was the guard, doing duty over us. We stayed there that night; the next day they took our names. There were between five and six hundred in our squad, when we were paroled after this manner: we were drawn up in line by states, and asked if we were willing to take the parole that we would not take up arms against the confederate government until we were fairly and legally exchanged; the answering to our names as they were called, is considered the same as an oath; all of our squad took the parole.\n\nOn Friday, July 3d, we were marched down toward the front of the rebel army. Here we found another squad of prisoners, about three times as large as ours. Part of these men took the parole and part would not. We halted quite near the rebel line of battle. The artillery fight was then in full blast; we could see the shells burst very plain; some of the shells from our side burst almost over our heads.\n\nHave you seen the rebel description of the battle? I will quote a few lines which describe the fight at about the time I speak of: “At twelve o’clock the signal gun was fired and the cannonading commenced. The fire of our guns was concentrated upon the federal line on the heights, stormed on the day before by Wright’s Brigade. Our fire drew a most terrific one from the federal batteries, posted along the heights from a point near Cemetery Hill to the point in their line opposite to the position of Wilcox. I have never yet heard such tremendous artillery firing. The enemy must have had 100 guns, which, in addition to our 115, made the air hideous with most discordant noise. The very earth shook beneath our feet, and the hills and rocks seemed to reel like a drunken man. For an hour and a half this most terrific fire was continued, during which time the shrieking of shells, the crash of falling timber, the fragments of rocks flying through the air, shattered from the cliffs by solid shot, the heavy mutterings from the valley between the opposing armies, the splash of bursting shrapnel, and the fierce neighing of wounded artillery horses, made a picture terribly grand and sublime, but which my pen utterly fails to describe.”\n\nThe above is from the “Richmond Enquirer’s” war correspondent, and I can testify to its truthfulness. Toward sunset those of us that were paroled were marched off the field toward Carlisle; there were about 1,400 of us. I did not know the rebels were beaten till I reached Harrisburg and read the account of their defeat in the papers.\n\nJuly 26. – An order has just been issued, saying that our parole was good for nothing, and that as soon as we were armed and equipped we must join our respective regiments again without being exchanged. Now I don’t understand about this. I think there will be serious trouble if we should be taken again by the rebels, for they may take a notion to hang us for so gross a violation of our parole. But I will not borrow any trouble till I understand better about it.\n\nI have recently received photographs of mother, Eugene, Susie, George Henry, and Albert Gould. Now, although a soldier, still I will confess to a little weakness, and admit that I have looked with undimmed eyes upon all the horrors of many battle-fields, with my brave comrades torn and bleeding on every side, without experiencing those tender emotions which the little cards never fail to produce.\n\nFarewell.\n\nWarren.\n\nLetter of Warren Freeman, July 26, 1863\n\nTowards the end of July, the prisoners in parole camp were still awaiting orders. Warren tells his father about the confusion of affairs.\n\nParole Camp, West Chester, Pa., July 26, 1863\n\nDear Father, - I got my box of nice things in good order, and only three days from West Cambridge. The shirts and draweres came in good time, for I am quite destitute of those things. The condensed milk I will keep till I go back to the regiment, as I can buy milk here for five cents a canteen full, or three cents a quart. We draw soft bread now, and are living well.\n\nWe have not got our new uniforms yet, but expect them every day; I will then go into the town and get a picture taken.\n\nI have not heard anything more about our parole not being valid or our being sent to the regiment; it may all blow over yet, so I shall not worry about it. The guard that do duty over us are raw Pennsylvania militia, and seem disposed to grant us, not only a full run of the camp, but the largest degree of liberty. Consequently, some of the men have gone home, others work for the farmers in the neighborhood at haying, etc. Some of our regiment talk of stepping out some day and going to Boston and reporting to General Schouler* and our Colonel Leonard for duty. They must look upon such an act as a very grave matter, but I think they would not arrest us for desertion. But perhaps they will say: “Well boys, you have done wrong in coming away from camp without a furlough from the proper officer. We must report you to the government, but will give them the facts, and I recommend that your offense be looked upon in a favorable light,” etc. Colonel Leonard was not severely wounded, and I suppose he will return to his command in a few weeks. We could report to him occasionally, and return with him, etc. Well, I don't know what will come of it, but if you do not hear from me soon you may think there is something in the wind.\n\nFrom your affectionate son,\n\nWarren.\n\n*Adjutant-General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, William Schouler\n\nIt seems Warren and others may have traveled to Boston as he contemplates doing here, for his next letter home is dated 7 weeks later, September 13th, when he had finally re-joined the regiment at Rappahannock Station. That letter describes his trip to the front via New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, accompanied by Colonel Leonard.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents\n\nSOME ESCAPED ! Tales from the 97th & 94th NY\n\nOn the march over South Mountain, many Union prisoners managed to escape from their Confederate guards. One such officer was Colonel Charles Wheelock (pictured) of the 97th New York, Baxter's Brigade. He was age 50. Colonel Charles Wainwright, Chief of First Corps Artillery, noted the escape with a humorous comment in his journal.\n\n“July 9th. - ...A great many of the prisoners that were captured from us are escaping; I hear of several officers arriving every day. Even old Colonel Wheelock got off though he is as big & old as Jack Falstaff; the old fellow showed a good pluck in running.”\n\nAnother officer who made note of the event is Chaplain John V. Ferguson, 97th NY Vols, whose letter is quoted in part below.\n\nThe letter of another escaped soldier from the 94th N.Y. regiment, Lieutenant R. N. Joy, was printed in an unknown home town Newspaper. This letter was found among the collection of digital newspaper clippings posted at the New York Military Museum. (https://dmna.ny.gov)\n\nReturn to Top of Page\n\nLetter of George Henry Hill, August 4, 1863\n\nGeorge Henry Hill was one of the prisoners who obeyed Union officers' advice, and refused the battle-field parole offered by the Confederates. In the letter to his father dated August 4th, he does an exceptional job describing the exhausting forced march from the fields around Gettysburg to Staunton, Virginia.\n\nHe names several officers and comrades in this letter who shared some of his experiences. They are Lieutenant Morton Tower, Lieutenant Samuel E. Cary, Lieutenant David Whiston, and Private Henry W. Metcalf.\n\nI believe, after checking the regimental roster and other sources, that the 'John' he mentions in his letters is Corporal John B. Curtis, Company B. Curtis's service record states : “Was taken prisoner at the battle of Gettysburg, carried to Richmond and Belle Island, and held a prisoner four weeks. Paroled and remained in camp at Annapolis, Md., till duly exchanged; rejoined his Regiment at the front in February following.”\n\nLieutenant Tower's memoirs are on this page in a section of their own. Lieutenant Cary's and Lieutenant Whiston's experiences are outlined with the others, including Curtis, at the bottom of this web page.\n\nAlfred Waud sketched the portion of Belle Island where prisoners were kept. There are several descriptions of Belle Island on this page. Private Roland E. Bowen, who was imprisoned there between August 8 - December 27, 1863, described in great detail what life was like at the camp in letters home.\n\n“Belle Island is situated in the James River just above the City of Richmond, its extreme lower end being opposite the famous Tredegar Iron Works. It is said to be about a mile in length and about a half mile in breadth, some parts of it are quite elevated. The main channel runs on the north or Richmond side and is quite rapid. This Island furnishes a fine water power station, water being brought down from its upper end in an aqueduct and running an extensive nail manufactory. The Island is connected with the mainland on the South or Manchester side by a R.R. Bridge wich runs to the nail works, considerable other business is carried on also.\n\n“At the lower end of the Island there is a level spot of ground, say 6 or 7 acres in area, and of a very sandy nature, and about 8 or 10 feet above the river. On this piece of ground there is about 3 acres of land enclosed by a ditch and a bank, the ditch being about 2 feet deep and 4 feet wide, the bank being 4 feet high, the ditch was formerly on the outside but has recently been changed to the inside. There are two entrances or gates, the main gate being on the N.E. Side wich leads out to Headquarters, Cook House, Hospital. The gate on the S.E. side leading down to the river.”\n\nLetter of George Henry Hill, August 4, 1863\n\nSergeant Hill was lucky in getting away from Belle Island so quickly. His comrade Sergeant John Boudwin, who was still lingering at Staunton, waiting for transport to Richmond, was imprisoned 5 times longer than Hill and his friends. More detail regarding his luck leaving prison so early is found in an article printed in the National Tribune, October 23, 1902, by Captain R. K. Beecham of the 2nd Wisconsin. A few relevant excerpts are presented here.\n\n“On or about Aug. 5 an order came to the prison authorities to exchange or parole several hundred prisoners. First, all the sick were selected, without regard to priority, which amounted to about half the quota.\n\n“...After the sick had been selected the remainder of the quota was filled in the order of priority. The oldest prisoners were called until all were taken, and there remained only the Winchester and Gettysburg prisoners. The quota lacked then 100 or more of being full. The Winchester prisoners were the next in priority, but the rolls had been mislaid, and the rolls of the Gettysburg prisoners were substituted.\n\n“This even caused an excitement that is easier imagined than described. It was like a death-knell to the hopes of the Winchester men, but it gave a new and unlooked-for hope to every man from Gettysburg. After getting my tent-mate through the gate I had gone back to my desolate den with no expectation of being exchanged on that day, but the moment I heard the call for the Gettysburg prisoners I joined the excited crowd and watched the result, with my heart beating like a trip-hammer. We had been enrolled by regiments, but we knew nothing of the priority on the rolls of our organizations. Usually there were only a few in each regiment, and we watched anxiously for the name of the next on the rolls.\n\n“...Rapidly the names are read off by the clerk, to which fortunate one responds as he runs through the gate. The quota is almost filled; there are only a few more names to be drawn. The 2d Wis. is called. How that name thrills the very marrow of my bones, for my name is among the number on that short list. Then follows a moment of suspense that no living being who has not been placed in a like situation can imagine, a few seconds of time of almost endless duration. My heart stands still in an agony of hope and dread. Will the quota hold out? Will my name ever be reached? Live a thousand years, I cannot experience another such moment. At last the spell is broken, my name is called, then my heart gives a great rebound, and I stepped out from under the Shadow of Death.”\n\nReturn To Table of Contents\n\nThe March to Staunton; Sgt. John Boudwin's Experiences\n\nGeorge Henry Hill gives a good account of the Union prisoners’ march to Staunton, VA, nearly 200 miles from Gettysburg. The diary of Sergeant John Boudwin provides another account. which adds some detail left out of Hill’s letter.\n\nThirteenth Mass comrades mentioned in the diary are, Ed Boyd, John C. Clark, Fred D. Locke, Charles ‘Chris’ Magraw, and Charles B. Morse.\n\nThe March to Staunton\n\nHunger and fatigue are the defining words for the forced march of Union prisoners to Staunton, Virginia, nearly 200 miles distant from Gettysburg. Heavy afternoon rain provided the proper emotional backdrop for the dreary trudge 5 miles further from town which kicked things off on July 4th.\n\nA little bit of flour and beef was issued and cooked up at midnight for the next day’s 11 mile hike over South Mountain to Monterey Springs. The road was clogged with wagons and the tedious halting march didn’t cease until 11 p.m. The boys caught a glimpse of the Confederate commander passing by, ‘on our way over the mountain General Lee passed us. Also General Picket & Brother, fine looking men both of them.’ Hunger drove Sgt. Boudwin to slip outside the Confederate Guards in the dark to beg something to eat from members of the Washington Artillery camped nearby. They genially obliged him with some bread.\n\nThe prisoners received another scanty ration of flour and beef at 7 a.m. July 6, but they had to march 8 miles down the mountain before they could cook it. The journey to Williamsport resumed at 7 p.m. At midnight the party stopped for a one hour rest. Sgt. Boudwin again ‘slipped by the Guard and got in to a garden and got some potatoes.- Dug them up with my hands.’\n\nThey were on the move again at 1 a.m., and stumbled along for another 7 hours through the rainy night, before they arrived ‘very sleepy’ at Hagerstown. This was the old stomping ground of the ‘13th Mass’ in the heady days of ’61. Not surprisingly, members of the regiment ‘saw several of our old friends who used to visit our camp at Williamsport.’ John Boudwin continues, ‘Marched within ½ mile of Williamsport and turned in to a cow pasture. On the Road passed several of our dead laying stripped of their clothing. There was a large cavalry fight here the evening before.’ George Hill said they arrived at Williamsport at 11 a.m. on Tuesday July 7.\n\nCrossing the Potomac\n\nAt Williamsport, the prisoners waited 3 days to cross the Potomac River. A ration of flour and beef was issued on Wednesday. On Thursday, ‘the Rebels and our boys are exchangeing for Bread, Knifes, Pocket Books, Combs, Paper &c. for a small pancake we had to pay 1 & 2 dollars for the same. Last evening the Ladies of Williamsport, Md. sent us some bread by one of the Rebel officers and he brought it to camp and sold it to us for 4 dollars a loaf. At 2 p.m. …marched to the Town and the boats – that carry us across – broke loose and we have to march back to our old place again. While down in the town saw several of our old friends and had a talk with them, also several of the young ladies in the town came and brought us bread and cake which Johnnie Rebel did not like and they sent them away, but the girls stood their ground and would not go - gave them letters to Wife and Mother. Got back to our old camp and at dark some cattle strayed in side of our lines & hunger drove us to kill them and it was done with out much ceremony. I got quite a piece and gave it to my boys & turned in for the night feeling very much in need of some rest. Bought some bread and paid $1 a loaf.’\n\nThe rest he needed was cut short at 3 a.m. by an order to ‘fall in’ and march to the river. It was time to cross.\n\nSgt. Boudwin did not describe the crossing only to say he cooked breakfast by the river bank and didn’t get on the road to Martinsburg until noon. One soldier estimated about 3,000 prisoners were ferried across the river in an old ferry boat, about 200 men at a time.\n\nFrom the south side of the Potomac the party started at noon for Martinsburg, about 13 miles distant. The day was hot, ‘several [of the men] gave out from the effects of the heat.’ They arrived at Martinsburg and discovered many citizens were still loyal to the Union. (It was the home town of 13th Mass drummers Sam and Isaac Webster). John Boudwin wrote, ‘going through the town several of the men and women threw bread into the ranks & the guard stopped them and would not let them speak to us and called them every thing but respectable people. At night the guards laid in line of battle & had 3 pieces of artillery pointed at our camp in case of an outbreak as the men were hungry and were told that we would get rations when we got to Martinsburg but there was none to be found…we have been 48 hours without food.’\n\nIn the morning the hungry prisoners were pushed forward at the point of bayonets for another 8 miles before they got any food. Rations of bread and beef were issued, ‘the bread was cooked by the women of Martinsburg. We were a happy set when we got the bread as we had been 68 hours without anything to eat. ...marched again at 5 and over one of the worst roads that man ever walked on – arrived within 7 ½ miles of Winchester at 12 midnight. Completely used up – Woke up several times in the night.’ This is the night George Henry Hill had the vivid dream about food, described in the letter to his father, above.\n\nSeveral woment lined the streets of Winchester to watch the prisoners pass through. Sgt. Boudwin recognized several of them from their previous stay at Winchester in 1862. The column was halted for the day and night on the far side of town and two days rations of beef and flour were issued to the prisoners. John sold his watch for $40 to a Confederate Calvary man. It was here Richmond newspapers informed the captives that Vicksburg was taken on the 4th of July. While halted here, another two hundred captives from Milroy’s command, mostly sick and wounded, joined the column. The day’s short march and supply of food caused Sgt. Boudwin to sleep well that night, --regardless of the rain. At least they still had their tents. That would change soon.\n\nStaunton was still 100 miles distant, and the prisoners, estimated to be 3,500 in number, were pushed on toward their destination like cattle, through rain and mud and water, averaging 18 miles a day.\n\nMonday, July 13 came in wet with a heavy downpour, and in consequence, at Newtown it took 4 hours for everyone to wade waste deep through a flooded creek. The column pressed on. Sgt. Boudwin wrote, ‘marched within 2 miles of Strasburg and camped for the night feeling tired – hungry and used up. My clothes all wet and nothing dry to sleep on I had an uncomfortable nights rest. Rained hard during the night.’\n\nTuesday July 14, came in clear, but the tired prisoners in wet clothes were driven 23 ½ footsore miles !\n\nSome relief was had the next day, when more rations of beef, bacon, and flour were issued at 10 a.m. but only after the usual 3 hour morning march. Distance covered this day was just about 13 miles and for the first time, plenty of good water was found in the abundant springs surrounding the village of New Market, where the column camped for the night.\n\nAt Harrisonburg on Thursday, -- ‘going through the town some of the men went to get some water out of one of the buckets – which was on the sidewalk and the woman turned the bucket over and told him he should not have a drop as it was for the Confederate soldiers and not you Nasty Yankees.’ Distance marched; 18 miles. At night Sgt. Boudwin got a touch of the chills. Small wonder.\n\nFriday, the last full days march was uneventful other than the long 18 ½ miles covered. Rations of bread and bacon issued. Officers were brought into Strasburg, 4 ½ miles further on.\n\nWaiting for a train; July 19 – August 4.\n\nEarly the next morning the prisoners were marched through the city of Staunton and turned into a large treeless field on a hill overlooking the depot at the south end of town. They were searched and everything of use or desired by the Confederate officers was taken away. Tents and rubber blankets would be sorely missed. In defiance to the Rebels, Corporal Albert E. Morse [pictured, above] and some of the boys cut up their blankets.\n\nSgt. Boudwin wrote, ‘Those who were seen doing so were bucked and gagged. Corporal Morse of Company B of our Regiment was one of the victims.’ The hands and feet of the victims were tied with arms passed over their drawn up knees, and a rod inserted between the arms and the back of the knee. Some seven hundred of the prisoners were soon after loaded onto rickety railroad cars and started for Richmond. These proved to be lucky men, the idea being that since they were all going to be paroled, the sooner they arrived at Richmond the sooner they might be exchanged, --and sent back to Union lines. Those left behind in Staunton slept cold at night without their tents.\n\nSunday morning, another group of prisoners left on the cars for Richmond. There was nothing to do in the field at Staunton but broil in the sun and mark time. Some local enterprising women from the town entered the camp on Monday with bread and pies to sell to the captured Yankees - at exorbitant prices, in general, double the going rate. They returned the next day to peddle their wares but the guard told them not to overcharge the prisoners. Prices dropped in half accordingly.\n\nAfter 3 days anxiously sitting around, all were ready to start for Richmond. This was the Tuesday that George Hill, John B. Curtis and 4 others stood in the sun for 3 hours and ‘by crowding and punching’ succeeded in getting onto the cars bound for Richmond. They went on their way rejoicing. Sgt. Boudwin ‘tried hard to go but did not get the chance.’ This proved very unlucky for him and his companions. They would uneasily wait in camp another two weeks for their turn.\n\nTime dragged on. Afternoon rain showers were frequent, sometimes heavy. This caused consecutive sleepless nights in wet clothes on damp ground. Other days came in hot. The captives wilted in the sun. Rations were scanty and hunger was constant. On July 31st, perhaps to break the monotony, the soldiers were marched down the hill and searched. Any money found was confiscated. John Boudwin and his friend Ed Boyd were robbed of $27.00 and $17.50 respectively.\n\nTwo weeks of exposure naturally made many men sick, without doctors or medicine to ease their symptoms. The post surgeon finally visited camp and doled out badly needed medicine on August 3rd. The next morning at 10 a.m. Sgt. Boudwin with his friends, ‘left Staunton for Richmond on freight cars 70 of them in a car and packed in any way.’\n\nThe rickety train ride is described in detail below, but Sgt. Boudwin did note passing through the Blue Ridge tunnel at Rockfish Gap, and passing through several small towns en-route. He admired the splendid scenery notwithstanding the circumstances. But the ride was still agonizingly slow. By contrast, George Henry Hill and his friends through much luck, were at this date comfortably safe behind Union lines at Annapolis.\n\nTo be continued.\n\nReturn to Table of Contents\n\nThe Train Trip from Staunton to Richmond\n\nIt was announced that 700 men would be transported to Richmond & the 1st that got in line would go first so of course there was a scattering, jamming, & a great deal of swearing as the line was forming. 8 of our company succeeded in getting in the line & thus was marched down to the depot & embarked on part platform & part box cars. Rickety old things they were too as the box car I was in had no roof on, only the frame & I remember while setting upon the frame that it swayed, back & forth sideways, so that it frightened me & I was expecting every moment to be dumped out by the side of the road & left there. Pictured is the engine, 'Westward Ho' purchased by the Virginia Central Railroad in 1857.*\n\nThe inside of the car was so full there was not standing room. The rideing was very slow as the cars being so poor, they would not admit of fast travel, besides the road bed being in very poor condition. There was also a halt every little while. The scenery however was truly a remarkable feature, especially after passing beyond the Blue Ridge.\n\nThe road skirted the summit of a high ridge, giving a splendid view of the valley beneath & distant mountains. It was very tedious rideing nevertheless. Night brought no relief as it was so crowded as to render sleep of any account out of the question & so the day wore away into the night while we went jogging on to Richmond.\n\nWe left Staunton at just 11 A.M., the distance to Richmond being 136 miles. The first station we arrived at was Fishersville, 129 [miles] to Richmond. The second station was Wanesborough, 124 miles to Richmond. About halfway between Fishersville & Wanesborough we stopped about ½ hour, going up grade. They burn chestnut & oak wood.\n\nPassed through 4 tunnels between 2 stations. First tunnel we were 7 minutes passing through it. I timed it by my watch. We were running lively too. After we got through I had to look almost strait up in the air to see the top of the mountain.\n\nPictured is the north face of the Blue Ridge Tunnel, completed in 1858. It ran through Rockfish Gap 4,237 feet long, the longest in the U.S. at the time of its completion. It was engineered by Claudius Crozet. [Wikipedia]\n\nThe third station was Meashum River, 115 miles to Richmond. Passed a sign board marked “Blairs Park 24 ½ miles.” There were 2 trains on the side track at this station, one a passenger train just arrived, loaded mostly with soldiers.\n\nThe name of the R.R. is Virginia Central. The name of the passenger train engine was Hero, the name of the other engine was C.S.C. Name [of the] fourth station Ivy. Fifth station Charlottsville, quite a place. Sixth station Shadwell. Here was a brick building & several wooden buildings with the insides all torn out. At this station we run on the side track & waited about one hour for another train. Between this station & the next, we stopped to get wood. At 5 P.M. we were just 90 miles from Richmond. Seventh station not known. 8th station, Lindsays, did not stop here. 9th station, Gordonsville, another road branched off here & went to Culpepper.\n\nSeveral barracks & tents were here put up around & near the depot & filled with wounded. Reached here about dark & stayed about 1 hour for the officers to get their supper, so it was reported.\n\nWe then went on stopping at the different stations along the road till we arrived at Richmond. I bought 2 blackberry pies for $1.00 & sold one to R.G. Seymore for $1.00. They were very thin, hardly more than the top & bottom crust & hardly berrys enough to color the crust. Pretty poor things but I was very hungry & I bought the first thing I could get hold of.\n\n*The 'Westward Ho' is pictured at Winifrede Junction, WV; 1875.

The prisoners had to wait for daylight to disembark.\n\nCitizens of Richmond turned out at the depot ‘to see the Yankees’ who were marched at 9 a.m. to a tobacco warehouse and searched. Canteens, haversacks, and any valuables found on their person were taken away. Next they marched to Belle Isle. They signed parole papers and entered the prison area at dark.\n\nA good description of Belle Isle is provided by Captain R. K. Beecham, 2d Wisconsin Infantry.1\n\n“The island seemed well shaded with trees and fair to look upon, but the soil was a bed of sand and the island was low and level. The prison pen was adjacent to the river, and comprised three or four acres of ground surrounded by a wide, deep ditch and an embankment, within which enclosure there was neither tree, nor shrub, nor plant, nor flower, nor blade of grass; nothing but a bed of sand. In or near one corner, where the water came close to the surface, were three or four excavations about six feet deep, with sloping sides. These were our wells of living water, and the green scum that covered the water made them very inviting. There were also a number of old tents, all badly dilapidated, pitched in a promiscuous cluster in the center of the enclosure, occupied by several hundred Union prisoners of war captured in part from Milroy’s command at Winchester in June, and others at some earlier date. No extra tents were furnished for the additional prisoners, and we found shelter as best we could or went without. During our whole imprisonment I never once enjoyed the luxury of a change of clothing or the opportunity to wash a garment.\n\n“The cooking establishment for the prison was situated just outside of the pen, on the bank of the James River, and 20 or 25 rods above it, at the other corner of the pen, and out over the river a few feet, were situated the prison sinks. The water supply for cooking purposes was drawn from the river, and of the relative situation of our kitchen and the sinks I have no further statement to make, except that the statement of their relative positions is true.”\n\nWhen George Hill and friends had arrived at Belle Isle, 11 days earlier, a comrade had reserved a tent space for them. This was not so for Sgt. Boudwin. He wrote, “Tents could not be had for love or money.” Those without tents suffered terribly in the hot weather that persisted through early August. The first night in camp a tragic killing was foreshadowed, when a guard fired at a prisoner standing not ten yards away. Miraculously, He missed.\n\nA letter of Private John F. White,2 a soldier of the 9th N.Y. Vols. [Baxter’s Brigade] describes life at Belle Isle at this time. Private White was among the first group of 700 prisoners to depart Staunton on July 19th. He arrived at Belle Isle 2 weeks before Sgt. Boudwin.\n\nThe murdered prisoner referred to in the letter above, is Private John Donnelly, 91st PA.3 His murder on August 14 shocked Sgt. Boudwin, who wrote:\n\n“At 2 P.M. one of the guard fired on one of the prisoners who was standing near the bank and killed him & wounded two others slightly. The guard had no cause what ever to fire on him. The man was married and left a large family to mourn over his untimely death -- It was as cold Blooded a Murder as ever witnessed -- Evening his body was carried away and buried. It was a sad sight, and I never want to witness another. Evening a heavy thunder shower.”\n\nThe above shows that survival at Belle Isle Prison was not just about filling up vacant hours of relentless boredom waiting to be exchanged. It was a life and death struggle against dirt, vermin, starvation, neglect, and exposure. Of the lice Private Roland E. Bowen, (15th Mass) said:\n\n“I don't deny being lousy when I went on to the Island, but I was not alive with them. I had been there but a short time before every crevice and seam in my few remaining rags were full of lice and nits. I used to pick lice from one to two hours a day, and then it was with the most utmost difficulty that I keep them in subjection. On the ground they could be seen crawling in all directions.”\n\nAfter 2 weeks sleeping on the ground Sgt. Boudwin came down with chills and was sick for a week. In general, cries of help for the sick were ignored. Private Roland E. Bowen4 continued:\n\n“The sick are much better taken care of than formerly; the[re] was a time when it was almost impossible to get a sick man out to the hospital. You might hear men at all hours of the day crying out Steward; Steward; I want to get a sick man out to the hospital, don't expect he can live but a short time. Answer. can't help it, have no room for him. Nine times out of ten this would be the answer. Yes, I believe nineteen out of twenty, and the poor wretch would be left to die without ever seeing a physician or having the first identical thing done to relieve him of his sufferings, until at last death relieves him of all his miseries.\n\nIn the midst of his illness Sergeant Boudwin wrote, “if we are kept here much longer we will die off like time.” After toughing it out on his own for a week John Boudwin was able to see a doctor and get some medicine.\n\nThroughout his captivity, he kept a careful record of the daily rations. Prisoners were issued rations twice daily. A sergeant was often placed in charge of a squad of 100 prisoners. Sgt. Boudwin was one of these squad sergeants. He was responsible for getting the squad's rations in the morning, and afternoon, from the Confederate Quartermaster at the prison gate. The sergeant, with some men, distributed the rations to his squad, which was further divided into 5 messes, each in charge of an appointed corporal, who divided it accordingly among the men in his mess. Breakfast invariably was bread and meat. Supper was bread and soup. Sgt. Boudwin failed to provide a culinary review of these offerings, but Roland Bowen did record his impressions.\n\n“About 4 oc P.M. we get supper, the routine is about the same except that we get 6 buckets of soup instead of meat, more appropriately called slush or swill. Sometimes it is rice, at other beans, and once in awhile mush. The beans are a very inferior kind, I think I never saw any like them before, they are very small and dark coloured. It is said they grow wild in many parts of the South and are commonly called peas. I should never call them peas however. The quality of the rice would be very good if they would pick it over, but the quantity, Lord. The mush would be very good if it was not for the absence of meal. I have seen many a pail of soup, say ten or twelve quarts, with less than a pint of beans or rice in them. Sometimes for supper we would get a few miserable half decayed sweet potatoes. A few times we got potatoes and soup both at the same time. Occasionally in the place of bread we got 3 hard tack and a little pork in the place of soup, which came from our lines. Very little of the provisions sent by our Goverment ever reached us, and when they did they were spareingly dealt out to us in place of Confederate rations.”\n\nTuesday, August 25, the day after Sgt. Boudwin saw the camp doctor, everybody's rations were cut. Beef rations were cut down to 12 pounds per 100 men, “and it makes quite a small piece to a man. Also our bread ration is smaller but all we can do is to grin and bear it.”\n\nThe day had a bright side though, for Sgt. Boudwin finally got himself into a tent, “...after being here 20 days and it is a little more comfortable than laying out in the hot sun.”\n\nThe added shelter the tent provided was a fortunate thing for the days were very hot and the nights turned cold during the last week of August. One night John wrote, “Those that did not have tents – had to keep walking most of the night to keep warm.”\n\nPrisoner Bowen re-enforces Boudwin's diary entries. He wrote:\n\n“Very seldom during my stay on the Island that all could get into tents. At times many hundreds had to sleep on the street and in the ditch with out a blanket or an overcoat. I say blanket or overcoat. They were half naked and would lay down 8 or 10 together like pigs just as close as they could get, in this way they would shiver out a part of the night, the remainder of wich they would walk the street. The silent hours of night are always broken by the dismal tread of a hundred shivering forms as they pass to and fro. I suppose every one is aware that in this clime, especially in the low lands of the James, that in the fall of the year we have very chilly nights with hot days.”\n\nThere were other threats inside the prison apart from exposure and hunger. At the end of August and early September Sgt. Boudwin begins to frequently mention the speculators, thieves and bread raiders that preyed on fellow inmates. Reduced rations incited men called ‘ralliers’ by Bowen, and ‘bread raiders’ by Boudwin, who would prowl camp to steal bread and rations. On August 28, Sgt Boudwin wrote,\n\n“Evening bread raids in camp several tents torn down. …the bread raids continued till 2 this morning the Guard came in camp and put a stop to it as the boys got very noisy. Some of the men got very roughly handled as knives were freely used.”\n\nPrivate Bowen called these men ralliers and described them in his letters:\n\n“…time and time again I have known the raiders to make a furious attack on a few loaves of bread, then there would go up a hideous yell and clubs would fly and bread too. In an instant there would come forth a throng of raiders and anti-raiders, men with clubs and knives and men without either. Some one would be sought out as a rallyer and get a crack on the cranium. Another would seize a loaf of bread, no sooner than he would get it 3 or 4 would rally on him and thus the scramble for bread and the fight would become general.\n\n“…A number of the raiders lost their lives in these melees. Its no crime on Belle Island to kill a man. In the Bay State if a man has plenty of money and puts it out freely, he is a good fellow. On Belle Island if a man kills a rallier he is a good fellow…”\n\nThieves were another problem. The day following the bread raids Sgt. Boudwin wrote:\n\n“I was to day engaged in a fight as we found a thief who stole some things from us and Lock and myself gave him a good thrashing which he won’t forget for some time. We found several stolen articles on him all of which he said he found…” [Fred D. Locke, Company D, 13th Mass].\n\nAugust dragged into September, and the party of 13th Mass men with Sgt. Boudwin marked their 4th , 5th and 6th weeks in camp. The Confederate Newspaper sugar-coated conditions at the camp.\n\nHow can the miserable dreariness of life here be described? Captain Beecham of the 2d Wisconsin said:\n\n“Talk not to me of your long June days in the North - they are as but moments. The longest days ever experienced by man were those prison days of July and August in the sunny Southland, within a stone’s throw of the court of Jefferson Davis.”\n\nThere were no exchanges after some 650 men left camp on August 20th and 28th; only rumors of exchanges. Meanwhile more prisoners were coming in to the camp. At irregular intervals, men captured from various engagements on land and sea swelled the ranks of the 3 acre plot that was Belle Isle Prison. Condemnation of the government authorities, a popular past-time with soldiers, became more frequent. Sgt. Boudwin wrote ,\n\n“I wish to God our Government would use some means to get us out of here for there is not any excuse for our being kept here so long...”\n\nAnd men continued to die. In the early dawn hours of September 13th, another soldier, half out of his mind from the strain of prison conditions, was shot down by a guard.\n\n“At 4 a.m. one of the prisoners was shot dead by one of the guard while on his way down to the sink. I have not heard the cause. I have learned his name and it is Mahoney of the 12th Mass Vols. He was a little out of his mind & was sick and was going to the sink and before he got there was fired on twice by the guard. It is a very sad affair and I am afraid a great many more will meet the same death for a large number of the men are getting desperate on account of being fed so poorly, but I will hope for the best and keep my courage up. I had a talk with the Lieutenant to day and he told me he would send me out if possible in the next squad.”5\n\nThe Lieutenant of the Guard kept his word. Confederate officers came in to camp to begin the process of exchanging a batch of prisoners on September 17. Sgt. Boudwin made his way to see him to have another talk. As an incentive, he gave the lieutenant Private Fred Locke’s gold ring, and Corporal Ed Boyd’s Meerschaum pipe, and a book, and in return the lieutenant promised to parole them the next day.\n\nThe anxiously awaited dawn came in stormy with a cold drizzling rain that turned to showers. After 9 a.m. it cleared off and the Confederate officers returned. The paroling process resumed. John Boudwin wrote, “after considerable hard work I got myself and comrades E.A. Boyd, John Clark, Fred Locke, and Chris Magraw paroled before sunset. Nothing else occurred during the day I learned that another man died in the Hospital this morning.”\n\nThe rain returned at night. The temperature dropped, the wind increased and the shower grew into a storm. Those without tents suffered severely. It was literally, 'a dark and stormy night.' The cold wind and rain persisted into the morning and throughout the next day. Two men in camp were found dead from exposure. And, John got 7 more men paroled.\n\nOn the night of the 20th the temperature dropped further still. It was another chilling, sleepless night, the coldest yet, for the paroled prisoners desperate to get away. Thoughts of their long awaited freedom nearly at hand fortified their patience to endure, yet still they suffered.\n\nThe 21st of September, continued cold into the morning, and for most of the day. And there were no evident signs of release. It was the 47th day at Belle Island for Sgt. Boudwin and his comrades. But the slow, drawn-out struggle for survival was about to end. On this day he wrote:\n\n“…This morning was very cold and I have not slept one hour the whole morning for I could not. I am feeling pretty old and since I have been a prisoner I have lost 30 lbs. of flesh and there seems to be nothing left but bones of my whole body. I hope to the Lord that we will leave this cursed hold before the week is out.\n\n“At 10 A.M. we all marched out and were counted; at 4 P.M. the very joyful news of going away. My name and my comrades was called and I have not felt so happy for a long time to march out and off of Belle Isle. Marched to a large Tobacco warehouse in Richmond and quartered for the night here. We drew rations of Bread, ham & soup & there was some pretty tall raiding for the same. I got 9 loafs of bread & 6 lbs. of boiled bacon & a bucket of soup for 12 of us, and if we did not stow that away no one ever did, for we were pretty hungry. Did not sleep any being over-joyed at getting away from Belle Isle.”\n\nPatience was still required as the exchanged prisoners traveled by train from Richmond to Petersburg, changed cars, and started to City Point to meet the Flag of Truce boat. The boys had to camp out yet another night but slept little while excitedly waiting to board the boat to freedom.\n\n“The boat came in sight at 7 and some tall cheering was done by the boys. It brought some paroled Rebel prisoners. At 9 A.M. all were landed and we took there [their] places on the boat and got rations of bread & bacon, all we wanted to eat.”\n\nPictured is the Federal “flag-of-truce boat” New York, which carried exchanged prisoners to Aiken's Landing, and later to City Point, in 1862, for the change to be completed. The Federal prisoners were usually taken from the point of exchange first to Fortress Monroe, and then to the parole camp at Annapolis. - From, “The Photographic History of the Civil War”, vol. 7.\n\nJohn took sick while the boat steamed up river through the night to arrive at Annapolis, 8 A.M. September 24. The released soldiers marched up to the barracks and found, “several of our regiment here looking very well. Received a clean suit of clothes & I went down to the river and had a wash & threw away my old ones and I felt like a new man when I got clean clothes. I got plenty of good food to eat & I feel happy. I quartered for the night in a good warm building & had a blanket to cover me and the first one for 3 months.”\n\nSgt. Boudwin was sick for over a week following his return to safety. But with proper care and shelter he recovered. He had been at Belle Isle 47 days. Those incarcerated even for a short time complained of the suffering endured when in the hands of the Confederacy.\n\nConditions at Belle Isle deteriorated even more, from these low Summer standards, for those imprisoned through the winter. Captain R.K. Beecham said:\n\n“Yet we saw only a fraction of the horrors of prison life - or prison death, as it afterward became, when all exchange of prisoners had ceased, and the doors of hope were closed. At that time the oldest prisoner on Belle Isle had not been there to exceed 60 days, for exchanges were being made at irregular intervals. We all expected to be exchanged, and hope is a wonderful invigorator.”\n\nJohn Boudwin and his comrades got off just in time. One wonders how any prisoner, north or south, survived prolonged imprisonment during the war under such conditions as those at Belle Isle.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Captain R. K.

Tower settled in Coos Bay, Oregon after the war. When Charles E. Davis, Jr. learned of it, he requested a copy for publication in the 13th Regiment Association Circulars. It was published in this form in Circular #8, December, 1895. In the forward to the article Davis wrote,\n\n“I am prompted to say that for a long time I have hoped our circulars would be made a vehicle for the publication of similar papers from comrades who can recall incidents of their service worth reading and preserving.”\n\nSTORY OF THE ESCAPE OF UNION PRISONERS FROM LIBBY PRISON, RICHMOND, VA., IN FEBRUARY, 1864.\n\nBy MAJOR MORTON TOWER.\n\nChancellorsville had been fought; it had been called a drawn battle. We retreated, and after a few weeks Lee and his army were again on the march, this time destined to reach Pennsylvania.\n\nOur march to Gettysburg, although a long one, was not particularly hard, as we had become inured to marching and the hardships attendant upon a soldier's life, by long service. There were small fights such as almost always preceded large battles ; almost everyday we could hear cannonading, and knew that the enemy was in our vicinity. On the evening of June 30, after the day's march, we went quietly into camp. Early on the morning of July 1, the long roll was sounded and we were hurried along, and at the double quick were marched some five or six miles, and formed into line under a severe musketry fire - formed not as usual, in one continuous column, but went into line by regiments with intervals between each. Very soon we found we had hot work to perform, and well the old First Corps did it. It is said we withstood Early's division of thirty thousand with our corps of only ten thousand nearly all day.\n\nRepeatedly they charged our lines and as often were repulsed; our regiment during the fight captured more men than it contained, and got them safely to the rear. A brigade of the Eleventh Corps came up in the afternoon and took position on our right; it was a fearful all-day's fight. General Reynolds, our Corps Commander, was killed early in the morning, and every division or brigade general was either killed or wounded, General Paul, commanding our brigade, being shot through both eyes, entirely destroying his sight. About four o'clock the enemy made a final charge, outflanking our right, and driving us into the town of Gettysburg, which they completely surrounded, taking between two thousand and three thousand prisoners, of which I was one.\n\nWhen our corps was driven back to the town there was no rout, though we steadily gave way as we were forced. As far as I know, not a single piece of artillery was lost; but, what was of very much more importance, I do know that by stubborn and heroic fighting the First Corps saved the heights of Gettysburg, as well as the army, for the fights that were to take place during the next two days. As we were driven back we could see our army marching and taking possession of the hills beyond the town, and we all felt that our task was done, and well done.\n\nThe Confederates gathered us up, marched us over the battlefield to their rear, and I had every reason to think that after more than two years vainly endeavoring to get into Richmond, I was at last destined to reach there.\n\nWe were marched about three miles to the rear of their army and halted. The incessant reverberations of the artillery and the rapid discharge of musketry told us how bloody was the struggle and how well disputed the ground. On the 4th we heard rumors of the repulse of the enemy, and unmistakable indications told us our captors were in full retreat. On that day our only celebration was the glorious news that Vicksburg was captured by Grant, and the knowledge that our troops had won at Gettysburg.\n\nWe started during the morning and marched steadily until midnight, in a drenching rain, to a place called Monterey. The next day we started early, and could plainly hear the firing in our rear, which gave us groundless hopes of our recapture. All through our march in Pennsylvania and Maryland the people along the route gave us provisions, which our guards allowed us to receive; in fact, during our long march while in charge of the men who had seen service, we received no unkindness. Our rations, after we entered Virginia, were scanty, and our march was a hard one, as it rained very hard most of the time, and when it did not rain the heat was almost unbearable. On the third day's march they camped us on the very same ground our regiment first occupied in 1861, near Williamsport. The people there heard of the capture of our regiment, and as we passed through the town loaded us with provisions.\n\nWe crossed the Potomac by the ferry, which was a tedious process, and again found ourselves once more in Virginia, with but little prospect of recapture.\n\nStanton, our destination, was about two hundred miles away; this distance was made by forced marches. We had few blankets, and those mostly of rubber, a canteen and a haversack, which were all we carried; the latter was most of the time empty, at irregular intervals during the march, rations of flour and raw beef were issued, which we cooked by making a paste of the flour and baking on the hot coals, the meat being cooked the same way. All things have an end; so did our march to Stanton, Va. We were strongly guarded, only one man that I know of, Colonel Spofford, of a Pennsylvania regiment, managing to escape. Once I tried it. While marching along a railroad one rainy night I slid down an embankment, and thought I had succeeded, when a voice said to me, “If you feel rested you better join the other fellows.” Another time I might have escaped had I only recognized the chance. One night as we were going into camp we passed a well where men were getting water. I passed out of the line, filled my canteen, and stood watching the men, when one of them asked me to what regiment I belonged; on my replying Thirteenth Massachusetts he kindly escorted me to the prisoners' camp. Our uniform was worn by many of the Confederates, so one could have stayed among them without being noticed.\n\nWhen we arrived at Stanton a large crowd was at the depot to meet us; our reception was very loud, if not very warm. Here we were to say good-by to our guards, and to be handed over to the tender mercies of the “stay-at-homes.” Captain Patterson, of the Sixty-first Virginia, had been in command, and he bade us good-by, saying, “I and my boys have treated you as well as we could. When you get to Richmond everything will be taken from you; the rubber blankets, haversacks and canteens you have will be of great use to my men.” Instantly almost every man handed them what he had, the guard then left us, but soon came back and loaded us with pies, cakes and cold meat, and when the cars started for Richmond gave us three cheers, which we returned. This was good-by for a long while to any considerate treatment. On the evening of the same day our sorry column, weary, foot-sore, and dust-covered from eighteen days' hard marching, was marched through the streets of Richmond to Libby Prison.\n\nThe gloomy and forbidding exterior of the prison, with the pale, emaciated faces staring vacantly at us through the bars, were repulsive enough, but at least it was a haven of rest from the weary foot-march. We were ushered into a lower room, where we were thoroughly searched and all money and articles of any value taken from us. We were then led into the upper south room. Not a chair, bench, table, or bunk was there; from the rafters hung a lot of old dirty blankets, to which we helped ourselves, and when put to use were found to be filled with vermin. Weary and sore we laid our-selves on the bare floor and slept as only overworked men can sleep.\n\nLibby Prison stood close by the Lynchburg canal, and in full view of the James river. It was a capacious warehouse, built of brick and roofed with tin; the building had a front of about one hundred and forty feet, with a depth of one hundred and five. There were nine rooms, each one hundred and two feet long by forty-five wide, the height of the ceiling from the floor was about seven feet, except the upper story, which was better ventilated, owing to the pitch of the roof; while at each end of these rooms were five windows.\n\nWe were now fairly embarked upon Libby life, little thinking what a long weary time it would be before we were once more free.\n\nThe room I was in was occupied by officers from the Army of the Potomac; there were over two hundred of us. Our only water supply was a faucet in one corner, with a sort of trough for the water to run into, which we utilized as a bath-tub when we could get a chance, though that was not often, among so many. Our rations were of the scantiest kind, with the exception of a short time when they allowed us to receive boxes from home. Mornings, the first thing was roll-call, which meant standing in line in files of fours until counted. After this came what was called breakfast, which consisted of a piece of unbolted corn-bread three inches square, and a very small piece of meat, mostly rancid bacon; this was all the bread and meat for the day. About five o'clock in the afternoon half a dozen negroes, each with a couple of buckets, would appear; these buckets were filled with a sort of broth that the meat had been boiled in, with a little rice added, and of this they gave us about a pint. Such were the rations we received every day. Every morning came a darkey with a frying-pan filled with steaming tar; this was to fumigate the rooms. Once a week came scrubbing-day, which was most dreaded of all days; the same darkies would appear with buckets and brooms and thoroughly drench the floor with water; this, as we had to sleep on the bare floors, would make it decidedly uncomfortable for a day or two.\n\nLife in Libby, at best, was very monotonous, but as we became used to it, we passed the time playing cards, chess, and other games. Schools of all kinds were in vogue. We had mock trials, civil and military, in which, generally, the culprit would be an officer who understood very little English, and the jury would be selected from the same kind; frequently during the trials, the anxiety of the prisoners and the jury to understand what was going on would be very interesting to the outsiders, though it did not appear so to them. We had lectures, and published a weekly paper called the “Libby Chronicle.” The editor, I thought then, and still think, could have been successfully sued for libel, as the items were generally quite personal. At night, after lights were out, came what was called the “Catechism,” when such questions as these were asked and answered ; “Who hid behind the big gun?” “Who surrendered for humanity's sake?” “Who washed his clothes in the soup buckets?” “Who burnt the hash ?” “Who took a bath ?” etc. And these were replied to with the names of the several offenders, much to the amusement of those acquainted with the circumstances referred to. These highly refined entertainments usually closed with a bombardment of all the utensils one could find at hand, which resulted in a general search for personal property the next morning.\n\nAt one time we gave theatrical and musical entertainments, and they were remarkably good, as among so many, more than average talent was to be found. Sundays, as we had several chaplains amongst us, we had Divine service. We also had temperance lectures by the famous Neal Dow. They did not make much impression on the audience, for of all the 1,500 or 2,000 men who attended, I knew of no one who used intoxicating liquors; perhaps from the fact that none were to be had.\n\nAbout a month, during the fall of '63, we were allowed to receive boxes from home, and clothing which was sent for the prisoners at Belle Isle by the Sanitary Commission, and here I want to say what any true, loyal man who saw the workings of that commission will echo with his whole soul, “God bless the Sanitary Commission!” Words cannot tell the good work they did.\n\nWhile we received boxes from home we fared very well. We gave and received dinners, and for a time, if prisoners can be, were jolly. Christmas came about this time, and we had a grand ball in one of the lower rooms, when we were allowed to burn candles until mid-night; we sang and danced until then. Soon after lying down someone started “Home, Sweet Home,” and I do not think there was a man that didn't join in singing the grand old tune, and grand and sad it must have sounded when one takes into consideration our surroundings.\n\nWinter was cold and cheerless without fires and with scanty clothing. Life was dreary indeed; we had long given up hopes of exchange, but all willingly submitted to the decision made by our government, that no arrangement for a just and equitable exchange of prisoners could be made.\n\nFrom the time one becomes a prisoner, the whole tenor of his thoughts will be the means and method of escape. Very few chances were offered, owing to the almost impregnable position of the prison. Few escapes were made, and most of these by seizing sudden opportunities. Occasionally visitors, mostly citizens of Richmond, were allowed, by the consent of the authorities, to enter the prison, and when leaving would pass out without being challenged by the sentinels.\n\nOne day several visited the prison. Captain Porter, Major Bates, and Lieutenant King, having obtained citizens' clothing from home, donned the same and followed this group of visitors past the guard. Captain Porter succeeded in reaching our lines, but the other two were recaptured.\n\nAt another time workmen were replacing wooden bars in the upper story with iron ones, and Lieutenant Cupp disguised himself as one of the number by soiling his hands and face, putting his old shirt over his clothes, and taking a piece of iron bar in his hands. When the workmen left at dinner-time, he quietly followed them out of the prison. As he passed across the street he was stopped by a citizen, to whom he apparently explained the alterations being made at the prison. He then coolly walked up the street and probably as coolly walked into our lines.\n\nAt another time Major Halstead and Lieutenant Wilson were in the hospital, presumably sick. The major, who had been a tailor prior to his military life, offered to make a uniform for one of the surgeons, but the surgeon, however, did not wear it, for one afternoon the major, in a surgeon's uniform, and Lieutenant Wilson, who by some means had obtained a Confederate private's uniform, not only walked out of the door, but all the way down the peninsula to the Federal lines.\n\n1.

Open Lot (not visible in cropped image)\n\nLibby prison had been considered by confederate authorities as one of the most difficult of all the prisons from which to effect an escape, the building being completely isolated. On the north and south sides were vacant lots, on the east and west, streets. Libby itself is a brick building divided into three tenements of which the middle portion of the ground floor was the only one accessible to the prisoners, the north and south rooms being occupied, one as the Confederate officers' quarters, the other for a hospital for the Union sick; the basement under this hospital was used as a place for rubbish, also as a place of temporary receptacle for the dead previous to burial. The prison was guarded night and day by twenty sentinels, five on each side of the building. During December of 1863 and January of 1864, combined attempts at escape were commenced.\n\nThe first of these was to tunnel to the sewer which passed under the street between the prison and the canal. The first attempt was made by Major Hamilton and another officer,* who tried to pass through a drain to the sewer; this was found to be impracticable. They had meantime obtained access to the middle tenement by raising a board from the floor. Next, tunneling was tried, but was stopped by the tunnel coming in contact with a large rock. Another tunnel was abandoned on account of striking a flow of water. Traces of the tunnels were obliterated and all endeavors in this direction ceased. Had they been able to reach the sewer, which was built of brick and led to the outskirts of the city, undoubtedly the prison could have been emptied of prisoners in a few hours.\n\nDiscouraging as these failures were to the men engaged, they were not disheartened. The next attempt made was commenced in a brick fireplace on the south side of the middle room, the object being to reach the basement under the hospital. This was done by digging out the bricks from the fireplace, the only implements used being a common case-knife. These bricks had to be replaced after the night's work was finished, every trace of which must be obliterated.\n\nAfter obtaining entrance to the basement under the hospital, a ladder was formed of old pieces of rope, blankets and sticks, which were hidden away during the day. The first work in the cellar was to remove the bricks from the foundation, thus making an opening of about two feet by eighteen inches in size. Then it became necessary to cut through one of the piles that formed the foundation of the building. This was a tedious labor, as the work had to be done with ordinary pocket-knives. Then commenced the process of tunnelling through the dirt, which was accomplished by filling common spittoon-boxes, with which the prison was furnished, and placing the contents under the rubbish in the cellar, throwing it into sinks where it was washed away by the water, and in every other conceivable place where it would not attract attention. After the tunnel had been dug a few feet, one would lie on his back, draw the spittoon to his chest by means of a string, loosen the dirt behind his head with an old chisel, fill the box with his hands and pull the string, when the spittoon full of dirt would be drawn out by 'a comrade and replaced with an empty one. All the excavating of the tunnel was accomplished in this manner. As we had no means of propping the tunnel, the sensation of being buried alive was fearful, and men could work only for brief periods.\n\nIn a building which occupied part of the yard our boxes from home were stored, since the authorities had stopped delivering them to us. Could we but reach that yard, we supposed the sentries would think we were their own men stealing them. This they probably did, as not one of us was challenged during the night of our escape. The entrance from the street to the yard was a brick arch-way closed by ordinary wooden picket gates, through these we passed into the street in plain sight of at least seven sentinels.\n\nOn the night of February 9, as soon as it was sufficiently dark the exodus from the prison commenced from the lower middle room, through the hole in the fireplace to the cellar below the hospital. The room was crowded with prisoners, which somewhat interfered with the exit of those escaping. About 11 o'clock an alarm was raised that the guard was coming. This caused the room to be cleared. With a rush every man sought his resting-place, and immediately all was quiet. Soon after Colonel Davis, of the Fourth Maine, came to me, saying, “Now is our chance.” We, with Major Hamilton, Colonel Rose, and others of the projectors, went down to the room and, finding no one there, passed at once through the tunnel just as the clocks in Richmond were striking twelve. It seemed strange that no alarm was given, as the noise made by the men rushing and crowding up the stairs was very much out of the ordinary. Colonel Davis had been seriously wounded in his left arm, which was now nearly helpless, and I had to help him crawl through the tunnel by pulling him along as best I could. We passed under the archway, waiting for what we thought a favorable moment to evade the sentinels' observation. Colonel Davis turned into and went down the street first. After a few anxious moments I followed and came up with Davis leaning against a building. We then passed along to the suburbs of the city, when we came to a railroad, near which a sentry was standing near a small fire. We succeeded in eluding his vigilance and walked as rapidly as possible away from Richmond, crossing over unoccupied fortifications.\n\nNear daybreak we reached a small thicket of woods, where we stopped to rest. We had scarcely lain down when we heard \"reveille\" sounding all around us. We knew we had to move, and we did so suddenly. We came out in full view of their camps, and tried to find some hiding-place. We were not successful in this, for we were on a small hill, within not more than a thousand yards from where cavalry was located. We lay down on the ground expecting, of course, to be recaptured before the day was done. Time passed on, and still we were safe. After the longest and most anxious day I ever spent, night came again and once more we breathed freely. We again started on, evading in the best way we could their camps and sentries.\n\nEarly in the morning we reached the banks of the Chickahominy river, where there was a grove of large trees with no underbrush, in plain sight of a sentry, had he been looking our way. He was leaning over a small fire around which several men were sleeping. It was as dangerous for us to retreat as it was to advance, so we did the latter. We struck the river where parts of an old pontoon boat and other drift had lodged, over which we passed in safety.\n\nFor an hour or more we travelled on, hiding in the brush the remainder of the day. As soon as night fell we again took up our line of march. During our wanderings we avoided all highways and open fields. Most of the way lay through swamps filled with tangled underbrush, and with water sometimes waist deep. The weather was very cold, the Potomac river being partly frozen over during the time we were out. We shaped our course by the north star.\n\nAt one time during the night, as we were walking along a path, we heard the tinkling of a cow-bell. Davis thought it would be a good scheme to have some fresh milk, we therefore hid in the brush beside the path, waiting for the cow to come along, the cow, how-ever, proved to be no cow at all, but a Confederate soldier leading his horse, which had a cow-bell suspended from its neck. We hunted no more lacteal fluid that night, as we had come to the conclusion that it was not healthy, although at different times we heard more bells, which we always carefully avoided. Early that morning we found, as we thought, a secure place for the day, near an old log. We had not hidden there long before we heard the baying of a hound, and as the sound drew nearer and nearer we knew the enemy were on our track. It was no use to run, and we prepared ourselves the best we could. The colonel selected a stout club and I opened a common pocket-knife which I had, and then waited. Soon a hound came up, jumped on a log, and commenced to bay, not offering to touch us unless we moved. The colonel struck the dog over the head with his cudgel and I with my knife, and soon he was a good enough dog for us.\n\nWe travelled for an hour or two hunting for another place to hide, where we stayed until dark, when we once more commenced our tramp. We journeyed all night through the swamp until daylight, when we suddenly came into the Williamsburg turnpike, which we had all along been trying to avoid.\n\nWe struck the road in plain sight of a Confederate picket, who called upon us to halt, which we did not see fit to do, but turned and ran for the swamp; three shots were fired at us as we disappeared. We managed to hide under some old logs, in water nearly up to our necks. For nearly an hour we could hear them hunting for us and calling to each other. After waiting until all was quiet we took up our march. We travelled for a couple of hours and hid for the day in a thicket. As soon as it began to grow dark we heard some one passing near us, and as they came in sight we discovered them to be two escaped Union officers. We joined forces and travelled together during the night. Early in the morning we came in sight of a house, which we concluded to visit. We found only three or four women there, and to them we said that we were Confederate cavalry, and that the Yankees had captured our horses and chased us through the swamp. We asked where our troops were. Pointing to a hill, they informed us “there were right smart of 'em” over there. They gave us some corn bread and biscuit, when we immediately left, making a wide detour of the place indicated as being occupied by the Confederates, and soon again went into hiding.\n\nAt nightfall we once more started, and had travelled for about three or four hours when we saw a large fire ahead of us. We proceeded toward this, coming soon into a large field in which were three haystacks. We could plainly see the fire, which was near a road. We dared not approach nearer, and as the haystacks offered a tempting bed we burrowed into the centre of one, lay down and enjoyed our first real rest since leaving Richmond. Next morning, feeling much refreshed, we concluded to travel for a few hours and find a safe hiding-place, as we thought the haystacks, from their position, too conspicuous. We passed around the place where we had seen the fire on the previous night, when we came to a wood where we had a plain view of the Williamsburg turnpike. We had been lying down for an hour or two when we saw coming from the direction of Willamsburg a troop of cavalry. As they approached near enough for us to distinguish their uniforms and equipments, we felt sure they were Union. We waved our hats to them, when they broke into a gallop and came cheering to where we stood. We found them to be a company of the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry, commanded by Captain Ackerly, coming out from the camp at Williamsburg to relieve a company that had been sent out to help escaping prisoners, they having heard of the escape from officers already arrived. The fires we had seen in the night had been built by these troops, thinking they might be seen by the fugitives. We stayed at this place all day. Captain Ackerly furnished us with horses, and with the company we rode to Williamsburg, a distance of about eight miles, where we found several officers who had succeeded in escaping. We were received with open arms by every one, were furnished with a tent, plenty of blankets and eatables, which we had been almost without since leaving Richmond seven days before, and from which place we took with us two small boxes of sardines, a piece of bologna sausage about four inches long that we had saved from boxes received from home, and two small pieces of Confederate cornbread. These were all the rations used by us during our wanderings, excepting the bread we received from the only house we visited.\n\nWe slept well that night and were up when the sunrise gun was fired and reveille sounded. We saw the flag raised, and never did a flag look as handsome to us as \"Old Glory” did that morning. One who has not passed through the hardships experienced by us the last eight months could hardly imagine the joy we felt in knowing that we were once more really free.\n\nOne hundred and nine officers escaped through the tunnel, fifty-three of whom succeeded in reaching our lines.\n\nFrom Williamsburg we were sent to Yorktown in ambulances, from which place some thirty of us were sent by steamer to Fortress Monroe, where we were received by Gen. B. F. Butler, who placed everything in Hygeia Hotel at our disposal. Next morning General Butler detailed an escort for us, with which we proceeded, passing through Baltimore, and upon arriving at Washington marched to the White House where we were received by President Lincoln. The news of our escape had preceded us, and all along the route from Fortress Monroe to Washington we were constantly receiving ovations from the crowds of people that thronged our way.\n\nThe officers on board the boat that conveyed us from Yorktown to Fortress Monroe did not apparently know who we were. As we left the former place we occupied the cabin, and of course were jubilant and very noisy. Soon the captain of the boat came into the cabin and said, “This noise must be stopped.” He then left, but soon reappeared and asked, “Are you the men that escaped from Libby?” We replied, “Yes.” He then said, “Make all the damned noise you please.”\n\nAboard the same boat was the celebrated Miss Dix, of sanitary and soldiers' hospital fame. She was greatly interested in us and our adventures, and invited us all to visit her in her home at Washington. At the Capitol there was the usual amount of “red tape.”\n\nWe had received orders to be paid off, and had been allowed thirty days' leave of absence. For two days I vainly tried to get my pay, visiting the Treasury Department each morning. On the third morning I again presented myself there, and was met by the usual answer “that I would have to wait.” I remarked “that it was mighty hard that a man who had just spent eight months in Libby Prison, and with a thirty days' leave of absence in his pocket, could not get the wherewithal to go home.” As I said this a kindly looking gentleman, who stood beside me, asked my name, rank, and regiment, saying, “Wait a moment.” He left, but soon returned, handing me a check "
