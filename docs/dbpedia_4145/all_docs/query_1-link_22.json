        "text": "151st New York Infantry Regiment's Civil War Newspaper Clippings\n\nDESERTER ARRESTED.—Yesterday morning Deputy Sheriff Cochrane, of Orleans county, came to this city having in custody William Watson, a deserter from the 151st regiment.—Officer Cochrane had been looking for Watson a long time, and on Sunday evening he was advised that the latter had gone west from Albion on a boat. He started in pursuit, overhauled and arrested his man at Brockport. He lodged his prisoner in jail here to be sent forward with the next squad of deserters.\n\nDeath of James Pomeroy.\n\nJAMES B POMEROY, Son of Heman Pomeroy, of this Village, died on the 12th of Aug. 1863, in the Army Hospital, near Culpepper, in Virginia. He was 23 years and six months old, was a Sergeant in company C of the 151st\n\nRegiment of N. Y. Volunteers, James H. McManis being Captain of the same company. Mr. Pomeroy had been unwell since the 25th of July last, but kept with his company till it reached its present location, when, seven days before his death, he went into the Government hospital which is in the open field.\n\nCapt. McManis writes that he was a good man and brave soldier. To the bereaved family it will be a consolation to know that he performed his duty and died in a noble cause.\n\nFROM THE 151ST,—Col. Emerson and Lieut. Williams, of the 151st, reached home on Friday night, where they were gladly welcomed by their many friends. They are sent to receive and forward drafted men, and will make their headquarters for the present at Buffalo.\n\nCol. Emerson is in feeble health, having been quite unwell for about three weeks.—Up to that time his health was capital. We hope that a few days of the comforts of home life will restore him to his usual good health.\n\nLieut. Williams reports himself in good condition; and his looks do not belie his report. For most of the time since last fall, owing the illness of his superior officers, he has had command of his company, and we are glad to know that he is esteemed one of the most reliable and efficient officers in the regiment.\n\nHABEAS CORPUS.--Yesterday morning a boy named William Wallace Watson, was taken be fore Com. Storrs upon a writ of habeas corpus, issued by Judge Hall, of Buffalo. Watson enlisted in the 151st N. T. V., at Albion, and afterwards deserted. It is claimed by his friends that he never was regularly enlisted, hence the writ. The hearing was put over to the 26th.\n\n— Col. Wm. Emerson, of the 151st Regiment, was in town yesterday. He has been detailed to Elmira, on service connected with the draft. He left his Regiment at Warrenton, Va.\n\nORDERED TO BUFFALO.—Orderly Sergeant E. E. Russell, of Capt. Coleman's company, arrived here Saturday and was warmly welcomed by his numerous friends. He with others from the 151st and other regiments are ordered to report at Buffalo for the purpose—as we learn—of taking charge of drafted men and escorting them to the commands to which they may be assigned. The Sergeant looks every inch a soldier. He reports the boys from this place in good health. The 151st now belongs to the 3d Division of the 3d Army Corps and was below Warrenton when he left about a week ago.\n\nTHE 151st.--This regiment is now encamped about 50 mile south of Washington, about two miles from the Rappahannock, near Peeltown.\n\nTHE NEW DUTCHESS COUNTY REGIMENT.\n\nPOUGHKEEPSIE, Tuesday, Aug. 26.\n\nAt a meeting of the War Committee, to-day, Hon. J. H. KETCHUM was unanimously elected Colonel of the new Dutchess County regiment.\n\nLetter From the 151st Regiment.\n\nCAMP NEAR BOONSBORO, Md.\n\nJuly 7th, 1863.\n\nEDITORS AMERICAN:—I have a few spare moments and will send you a short description of the fight which our cavalry had at Hagerstown last night. Gen. Kilpatrick sent the 18th Pa. ahead, and just as they entered the town they met a concentrated fire of musketry which compelled them to retire. Being unsupported by infantry and the rebel force being superior to our own, it was found necessary for our boys to get out of a bad scrape as best they could. The whole of Kilpatrick's brigade was surrounded, and affairs were getting rough, when the men were ordered to cut their way out, which they effected, but not without great loss. Gen. Buford gave the rebs a taste of his quality by burning one of their wagon trains seven miles long. The smoke was plainly discernible from our camp, as the train was only three miles distant from us. Scouts report the rebels as crossing the Potomac at Williamsport. Yesterday Gen. Buford hung a spy by the name of Richardson that he had captured the day before. The execution took place near Frederick City.—The day before one of our pickets observed a man writing on horseback near where he was stationed, and challenged him. The literary gentleman put up his writing materials in double-quick time and attempted to escape, but our cavalry soon overtook him. When examined, he was found to possess accurately drawn plans, diagrams, and positions of our forces, in the vicinity of Harper's Ferry, Frederick and Monocacy. He had passes signed by very many Union commanders, and others signed by Lee and Ewell. When he visited the camp of the 151st, at Maryland Hights, he passed himself off as a map peddler. His peddling is done! all honor to Gen. Buford. Three others were to have suffered a like fate, at Frederick, yesterday. I have not heard whether they were hung or not. Buford's cavalry passed our camp yesterday, A. M. Among the many familiar faces, I observed that of Chas. Brignell of the 1st Michigan Cavalry, formerly Barre. Charley says he has seen \"right smart\" of war. He has been in forty-eight skirmishes and five general engagements. His sabre was blood-stained, which was proof of its having been used to some purpose. He says the battle at Gettysburg was the most desperate that he has seen. The rebs, he says, suffered a very much greater loss in killed and wounded than our forces. Morris' brigade, to which we belong, is stationed at South Mountain, on identical field where the battle was fought last September. Our regiment is thrown out as the advanced line of infantry pickets. To-day the enemy are reported only eight miles distant, at Funkstown. Whether they will attempt to break through our lines at this place, is very doubtful. Let them come if they wish. We are pre- pared to give them a hot reception.— Co. D. in good spirits and spoiling for a fight. Capt. Hallock and Lieut. Oaks are on the sick list, and Lieut. Williams commands the company with great ability. My time is up, and I must throw down pen and put on the weapons of war.\n\nRespectfully yours C. H. M.\n\nFrom the 151st Regiment.\n\nCorrespondence of the Democrat & American.\n\nON PICKET, ON THE BANKS OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,\n\nAug. 4, 1863.\n\nWe have received a letter inquiring why we did not communicate to the DEMOCRAT and let the friends of the 151st know where we were, what doing, &c. It stated there were letters from the 108th, 140th, old 105th, &c. but none from the 151st. Although only one company came from Monroe County, yet nearly all interested friends probably have access to the D. & A., owing to its extensive circulation in the three northwestern counties. Recently there has been little opportunity for writing, but as poor at the best, and consequently anxious relatives do not hear as often as they otherwise would.\n\nThe regiment has been in the service nearly a year, and in the field since April; and has ever been ready for whatever services it has been called upon to render, and has done honor to a good name and laid the foundations of a fine and high reputation, Its bravery and courage have not been tested by participating in an actual battle, although it has been in close proximity to a few. There need be no fear, for these traits are plainly evinced in every feature. Some lucky fate has kept it from the one main reality of a soldier, although it has ever been ready and sometimes anxious--and often expected battles. Old officers affirm that this division or corps has experienced as hard service as troops ever do. We have been in the Potomac army during this last campaign, and in the hard long marches have cheerfully endured much fatigue.\n\nCamp is back about a mile from the river, but to-day the whole regiment is out on picket along the river. It is raining, and you will please make allowances for soiled paper. This is the section of country opposite Culpepper Co. We are in the vicinity of Sulphur Springs, and a few miles distant from Warrenton.\n\nThe health of the men is generally good and its numbers yet good in consideration of the same when it came out. Of course some have fallen out sick by the way, but are usually taken to General U. S. Hospitals. We belong to the 3d corps, and all letters intended for the regiment should be addressed to Washington, D. C.\n\nWhat the future operations of this army are to be, few know—it remains to be seen. It certainly is hoped that a decisive blow will be struck to Lee's army, and the far famed Army of the Potomac yet be transcendent in renown and glory. This is what it deserves, for there can be no better army. Severe cannonading and musketry are going on near here.—The reports come from a southerly direction.\n\nRumors have come of another New York mob being attempted. If it is so we hope that her streets will run with blood, till the mention of the affair, for years to come, will create a shudder. May the authorities do their duty if thousands are slain. It will be a blessing for the altogether too riotous New York, a city whose copperhead, anti-religion, anti-temperance traitors are disgracing our country and humanity.\n\nVery truly, &c., HOLLEY.\n\nNew Publications.\n\nTHE 151ST REGIMENT.—A letter from First Serg't. Mattison, of Co. D, 151st Regiment, informs us that the regiment has changed its base of operations; and on June 11th was located at Point of Rocks, Maryland. Our correspondent also gives an account of a mutiny in a Maryland company, who refused to march over into Virginia when ordered. Col. Emerson is reported to have given three or four of the mutineers telling evidence of his physical powers. Six companies of the 151st were ordered out to assist in putting down the rebellion, \"which they did in double quick time.\" The 151st were doing picket duty on a line of several miles. The rebels were soon expected to cross the Potomac.--Roch. Dem.\n\nFROM WEST VIRGINIA.\n\nHEADQUARTERS 151ST REG'T N. Y. S. CVolunteers,\n\nCAMP BOWEN, BUCKHANNON, WESTERN, VA.\n\nMay 19, 1863.\n\nThis is a town of about five hundred inhabitants, and the county seat of Upsher county. Our regiment arrived here day before yesterday, and encamped in an orchard upon a small knoll near the town. There is a battalion of cavalry here, which, together with the 151st Regiment, constitutes the entire force in the place. Col. Emerson is acting Brigadier General and Military Governor of this place at present, and Lieut. Col. Bowen commands our regiment. I intended to write you from Clarksburg, but had no opportunity. From the latter place we marched to Weston, a distance of twenty-three miles southwest of Clarksburg, our regiment having moved from the latter place on the Monday previous. We arrived at Weston on Sunday morning, and found that the 151st had moved from this place for Buckhannon the day before, a distance of sixteen miles southeast of Weston. This was an unpleasant prospect indeed, for our blistered feet and stiffened limbs. We had been since Wednesday night trying to reach the brave New Yorkers; had slept two nights upon the damp ground, rolled up in Uncle Sam's blankets, with no other shelter but the azure sky above. But reach the camp of the gallant 151st we must, and a spirit of enterprise made us forget our afflicted feet, and we were soon upon the road, bound for Buckhannon. After a rapid march of nine miles over the worst road I ever saw, one of the horses attached to our baggage wagon gave out and again we put up for the night—another chance to repose my wearied limbs upon the sacred soil of Virginia.\n\nWhile in Baltimore, I often thought the Government foolish to furnish four and oftentimes six horses to an army wagon; but when I saw the condition of the roads in Virginia, I at once saw the propriety of it. You are aware that Northerners are continually croaking because our forces do not move, and when they do go forward complain that they move too slow. To such people, a two weeks' march as the rear guard to an army train, over a road in the Old Dominion, would effect a lasting cure. They would say less as they learned more of war, I reckon.\n\nAt Janelew, a small hamlet about half way between Clarksburg and Weston, we learned that the rebels under Imboden, Jones and Jankins robed a citizen of Lewis county of cattle and horses worth over ten thousand dollars. They seemed to be after plunder, and not \"spilin' for a fight.\"\n\nWhile here, we called at a humble dwelling for the purpose of buying some provisions, and to our surprise found the inmates to be blood relations of Stonewall Jackson. They were an aunt and two cousins of the deceased General. From them I learned that Thomas Jonathan Jackson (Stonewall's real name) was born at Clarksburg, Harrison county, Va., and, being a poor boy, at an early age went to live with an uncle in Lewis county, near the village of Weston. He remained there until he was sent to West Point Military Academy, to complete his education. After he graduated at that institution, he was, until the breaking out of the rebellion, in the service of his country. I was shown letters written by him when commanding Fort Mede, Florida, and others written at various places. All are quite religious in their tone, and are set forth in an easy and graceful manner. His relatives are Unionists, and regret that he died while serving so mean a cause; but at the same time they believe that he was a great and good man, though sadly misguided in fighting for Jeff. Davis.\n\nTo-day we are encamped in Pan Orchard, a pleasant location and furnishing a grateful shade. This place was disgracefully abandoned by the Union forces under Brig. Gen. Roberts, two weeks since. We had four thousand troops here, consisting of artillery, cavalry and infantry, and held positions of great natural strength, supported by batteries. When the rebs came on, Gen. Roberts was suddenly seized by an extraordinary fit of discretion, which he manifested in a most dastardly retreat. He destroyed bridges, camps, and ordnance stores, in all worth about two hundred thousand dollars.—The rebs took to their heels as soon as they saw that our forces were moving--probably supposing that he (Roberts) was moving upon them; but soon regained their senses, and after destroying their cannon and ammunition marched upon this town, and plundered it of everything valuable that they desired. Citizens declare that our force here was sufficient to have whipped the whole rebel horde. The rebs were but half armed, and without ammunition. It is time that we have a commander who will fight, and not attempt to show their military ability in \"successful retreats.\" The raiders secured five thousand head of cattle and two hundred horses, and now are reported to be falling back to the mountains, or to some other safe place. It makes no difference where they go. While we are under Gen. Roberts we shall not be allowed to follow them, or attempt their capture.\n\nThis is soldiering indeed. We have shelter tents, frosty nights, hard tack, \"salt horse,\" and all the delicacies incident to camp life in the field, and yet are anxious to chase the rascally secesh. I reckon this kind of life would make a Mark Tapley intensely jolly. When something more turns up, of importance, I will write again. Yours truly, C. H. M., Company D.\n\nFROM THE ARMY.\n\nCAMP NEAR CULPEPPER, VA.,\n\nNov. 20th, 1863.\n\nMESSRS. EDITORS:--It is from this place that we last addressed you: since that time there has been a fine skedaddle up to Manassas and a glorious, though less hasty, advance in returning. The Federal army is here again much sooner than the Gray Backs, and even loyalists expected. General Meade's style is to do things sooner than anticipated. The journey as usual, has been varied with hardships and pleasure, sunshine and rain, heat and cold, slow marching and fast marching, cross-marching and counter-marching. The last move of this Brigade was from Brandy Station. Darkness and a heavy rain overtook us, the lightning was blinding and the thunder deafening. Such a scene, as occurred cannot be imagined but known only by experience. The officers, soldiers, servants, mules, horses, niggers and wagons of all the three Regiments were promiscuously conglomerated and endeavoring to paddle through the mud and swollen streams, of which there were more than a dozen over knee deep.\n\nThe 151st has not yet been directly in an engagement but it has not been for want of good will, for it has been drawn up in line of battle times innumerable right in the face of the enemy, but somehow the wiley foe always ran. Our Regiment ought to be grateful to its Supreme Ruler; for it has been signally protected and prospered. The 2d Brigade had a night engagement on the advance to Brandy Station, and the 1st were in supporting distance. The first Division did the work at Kelly's Ford but the 3d were near by. We were under fire at McLean's Ford on the Bull Run, but the Johnnies did not get range, and the Regiment did not realize their situation. This occurred while marching down to reinforce another Battalion, which had taken advantage of some rifle pits, and were fighting only a few rods to the front of our line of battle. The system of strategy appears to have changed. It now consists of flank movements. The cavalry and artillery are usually effective. There is so much of this lighting of late that all have become accustomed to, and familiar with the excitement of severe and brisk cannonading.\n\nThe weather for this time of year is good, and the fall season so, far, has generally been favorable for activity.—Some days are very pleasant and cheering. How long we shall remain here or what are our prospects no one knows. Inspections, and investigation as to amount of rations on hand, are taking place, and these things sometimes indicate a move.\n\nThe health of the soldiers is much better than in warm weather. The army never felt better or stronger. The rebel cause, from reliable sources, is rapidly waning and will soon we trust lose caste even to the laying down of arms and again cherishing and holding fast the blessings of peace.\n\nThe army looked anxiously forward to the State election, and their hopes are fully realized. You, friends of the Union have done well, and nothing has occurred since the rebellion more encouraging to the soldiers. Press on in the work! you have the cause of justice and right, and good men will forever sanction your efforts and bestow their benediction on all true loyalists. God does, we are confident, favor the cause in which we are engaged and in due time will bring back again the balmy days of peace and security.\n\nYesterday a friend and myself took a walk to Culpepper, about two miles distant. The town now is all military, few citizens making their appearance.\n\nIn fact there are none left save women, old men and children. What would the citizens of Albion think of seeing their pleasant village all dilapidated and going to desolation, with only a shabby barber shop with two old gray headed negroes in it, and one or two places where only tobacco was sold. The business places generally have the windows pushed in or the shutters closed. The Court House is used for a stable. It was indeed a pleasant and flourishing place before the war, and would compare favorably with a place only a little smaller than Albion. This country and the country round about is as fine a section as we have seen in Virginia.—The dinner which we were fortunate in getting at $1 each in greenbacks or $4 Confederate, was very good and satisfactory.\n\nYery truly, &c., HOLLEY.\n\nBALTIMORE, MD., July 13, 1864.\n\nMESSRS. EDITORS:\n\nI had a list of the killed, wounded and missing of our regiment, in the fight at Monocacy Bridge, on Saturday the 9th inst., published in the American this morning, a copy of which I send you for publication. Among those I have reported missing, some were probably killed, some wounded and in the hands of the enemy, and the rest are probably prisoners. I have waited till I think all the stragglers have come in who were not captured, before sending you the list; and it is as nearly correct as we can make it at. Those whose manes are not in this list are known to be safe. It is a sad record we made in that terrible fight--the most severe in which our regiment was ever engaged. The rebels outnumbered us three or four to one, and it was only after eight hours hard fighting, when our boys found that they were flanked on the right and left with three lines of battle pressing them in front, that they commenced to fall back. Our officers and men stood heroically against such fearful odds till ordered back. Even then, Col. Emerson displayed the qualities of a brave and daring soldier, and was conspicuous for his gallantry through the entire fight. Lt.-Col. Fay did, all that an officer could do, and showed the same coolness and courage as when on former occasions it has devolved on him to lead the regiment in the contest against a desperate foe. Adjt. Jewell was at his post all through as brave as the bravest, and the line officers unflinchingly led their men amidst the storm of iron hail, till some of them had but two to take off with them when the retreat came. Col. Emerson had four balls pass through his clothes—two of them wounding him slightly—though he remained on duty, and is now commanding the brigade.\n\nOur Division is now encamped in Druied Hill Park, just outside the northern limits of the city, where I hope they may remain long enough to rest. As we marched with the remnant of our noble regiment through the streets of Baltimore this morning, I could not keep back the tide of feeling that would moisten my eyes as I thought of the noble dead who left this place with us a little more than a year ago, but are now filling honored graves at Locust Grove, Wilderness, Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor, and Monocacy Bridge. May God be kind to the sad, stricken hearts at home. Very respectfully,\n\nL. T. Foot\n\nChaplain 151st N. Y.

Oct. 13, 1864.\n\nInteresting Letter from the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia.\n\nCAMP NEAR BERRYVILLE, VA.\n\nSeptember, 17, 1864.\n\nBRUNER BROTHERS:— We are in camp on or near Clifton Farms. We know very little about the place, but suppose it to be one of the great, broad possessions of Virginia aristocracy. We came here the 3d inst. This is the longest rest we have had since the pulling up of camp near Culpepper, May 3d. Here there is no firing oftener than once in two or three days. Day before yesterday there was a reconoissance by the Cavalry supported by the 2d Division of the 6th Corps. Yesterday morning they brought in an entire regiment of South Carolina prisoners.\n\nSince you heard from us at Buckeye-stream, Md., there has been a continued active campaign. We were put on the cars at Monocacy Junction, our old battle-field, the next morning and came directly to Harper's Ferry, and thence to Bolivar Heights. The army of the Middle Department, well organized under Gen. Sheridan, a brave and accomplished soldier, advanced up the Valley as far as Strasburg; and then back again to Hoeltown, near Bolivar; out again beyond Charlestown; back again to near Harper's Ferry; and, after a season, another forward movement as far as this place. During the time there has been several little skirmishes but with small loss to the 3d Division. The morning we were ordered from Monocacy Gen. Grant was there. He was at Gen. Hunter's head-quarters near by the railroad, and as the troops passed by they cheered him grandly. The movements that have been made since then have taught us what he knew then and we did not. Now this morning the Corps Officer of the Day has passed along and reported that Gen. Grant had arrived and was now at Gen. Sheridan's headquarters.\n\nInspections are prevalent, and affairs begin to assume a shape that indicates active operations again.\n\nIt is singular how soon after an engagement soldiers forget their sorrow for loss of friends; forget their hardships and trials and suffering. After getting in camp and rested, all hands are jubilant. All the little amusements and sports that can be invented, are indulged in. They are very innocent, and certainly beneficial and desirable. Such sports as pitching quoits, playing duck, jumping, cock-fighting &c. We go into a battle and perhaps one sees his best friends cut down by his side. This is grievous and cannot be blotted from the memory in an instant, but it does no good to brood in a melancholy mood over the matter. The hopeful and cheerful spirit is everywhere prevalent in the army. One regiment of our Brigade goes home one week from today. The 87th Pa. are brave soldiers and have done three years good service. We are rejoiced to see so many left to go home. The Brigade is having some recruits, conscripts and substitutes sent to it. Substitutes are usually poor soldiers, however. This Valley is an excellent country, but it should be entirely cleaned out and not a citizen be allowed to stay in it at present. The armies here are using up the substance of this section most effectually.\n\nOccasionally there is a letter published in the Northern Rebel papers reported to be from soldiers. Do not believe this. There was one the other day quoted as being from a soldier in the 151st and dated at Strasburg, the 26th ult. The author ought to be a little more careful in regard to dates. We were not at Strasburg, at all at that time. Seymour, Vallandigham, Pendleton & Co., need not flatter themselves that the army is disloyal, or even partisan. Occasionally, to be sure, a sour, selfish misanthrope may talk venomously, but as a general thing the great mass speak, and will vote for Union and the suppression of the Rebellion by force of arms. The only safe Platform before the people is that of the Union. The nominees of the Baltimore Convention are satisfactory. Everything looks bright and promising.\n\nWise men told us, even in the days of greatest gloom and doubt, that all would be well. Gen. Grant is rapidly bringing the campaign to a successful and satisfactory consummation. We are all anxiously looking forward for the end of this awful war. But, be assured, none in the army are anxious to have it close till it is done honorably and effectually. The 8th Artillery are really unfortunate. It is sad to see so large a regiment cut down so rapidly. You may remember that out term of service expires Oct., 22d 1865. We trust, by the kind protection of God, to come home safely and honorably.\n\nHARRISONBURG, Va. Sept. 26th.\n\nSince I wrote the above there has been no mail; and there has been so much greater events that all else is made insignificat; nevertheless you have it.\n\nWe received marching orders the next day, (Sunday 18th,) but after getting packed up the orders were countermanded. At night, however, about ten o'clock, orders came to march at 2 o'clock, Monday morning. After marching about seven miles in the direction of Winchester we met the enemy. A battle ensued, the first of two great engegements and Victories during last week. The details of these battles are probably already familiar to you. A Cavalry fight occurred in the morning, and then infantry skirmishing till 11:40. At this time a grand charge was made of all the line. The enemy were driven and bitterly punished, but under his withering fire our forces were obliged to fall back a little. This was owing in a great measure to an accidental halt in our lines. But it was only for a short time, and our boys again recovered all the ground the had taken and held it by persistent fighting for four or five hours. The lines were again formed to good order and another charge made which night alone ended. The enemy were driven and dispersed and hosts of prisoners captured together with several cannon.\n\nOur forces occupied Winchester and camped that night on the south side of the town. The 151st were on the skirmish line in the forenoon and consequently did not have to go forward in the first charge, and their loss is not so severe as that of other regiments. The greatest loss was in the first onset. Cannonading was kept up during the brisk skirmishing in the forenoon and many were killed and wounded. Capt. Williams was wounded while skirmishing. He is a very brave officer. Col. Emerson, commanding Brigade, and Lieut. Col. Fay, commanding the Regt., have acquitted themselves gallantly. They have had many narrow escapes. The loss of the regiment is only about 25. That of Brigade 289. This is out of about 900 or 1,000 fighting men. Our in prisoners is nothing. I inclose a list of casualties among the Orleans Co. boys. The lost some of its finest field officers. Major Dilingham the 10th Vt., son of the Lieut. Governor of that State, and Maj. Medenburgh of the 14th N. J., are both among the killed. Both these officers were commanding regiment. Gen. Russell commanding the 1st Division of the 6th Corps was killed early in the engagement.\n\nTuesday morning this army marched forward up the Valley, reaching Strasburg the same day, and found the enemy in his old intrenched position. The following day our Corps moved to the right and advanced on the enemy, but darkness coming on suspended further operations. During the night fortifications were built, but not used, for early the next day skirmishing began, and an advance was made. The 3d Div. of the 6th Corps was legitimately in reserve, but actually in front. Orders were given that the 8th Corps should take the main works while the 3d Div. of the 6th were to cary a certain crest. But as soon as the charge was ordered, the whole army pushed irresistably and frantically forward carrying everything before them. Darkness ended the charge but it did not end the exultation—cheers, huzzas and yells. A constant and heavy fire was kept up all day and caused some occasional loss, but it was trifling in comparison with the great achievement. The enemy were behind strong works and a great slaughter was expected if not a repulse, but by the superior strategy of Gen. Sheridan the \"Johnnies\" were completely routed and lost at least 21 guns, and hosts of prisoners. Gen. Sheridan has made himself everywhere conspicuous during the recent engagements, riding up and down the lines in the hottest of the fire; infusing his troops with the greatest enthusiasm. Officers and soldiers were wild in their pursuit of the retreating foe, but the rebels run so like sheep it was impracticable for infantry to continue further. So cavalry and flying artillery followed as well as they could in the darkness.\n\nAfter the troops were reorganized and had cooked coffee they moved deliberately forward to Woodstock, 12 miles, where we made breakfast. After a few hours rest we went \"onward\" again, to Edinburg. The next morning early, marched again, overtaking the enemy at Mt. Jackson. But they were readily shelled out, and after that during the day their rear was constantly in sight. We marched with a skirmish line in front and the \"Johnnies\" were obliged to skirmish what they could with us in face of our artillery, all the afternoon, continually retreating. Finally, just before dark they made a strong stand about three miles this side of New Market, when night came and we camped. Yesterday the army marched to this place and have remained here to day. The enemy appear to have divided and a portion gone the other side of the mountains. This is most disgraceful retreat any army ever made. Several of their hospitals have fallen into our hands. Tere are four in this place.\n\nThe army, at least our Division, is well supplied with tobacco here. The soldiers are nearly subsisting off the country. This is a pleasant, fertile and fruitful section. The weather is excellent. We are some distance away from our base of supplies, and had hard work getting here, but who says we have not done a successful week's work?\n\nYours truly, HOLLEY.\n\nTHE 151ST IN THE BATTLE AT MONOCACY.\n\nThe 151st N. Y. V., Col. Emerson, was in the recent battle with the rebel force at Monocacy and sustained considerable loss. A letter from an officer to Captain Imo gives a few particulars. The 151st is in Rickett's division. The writer says: \"the fight was a rough one. Our division with the exception of 900 men who did not arrive and some one hundred day men who all ran away at the first fire—had to fight at least four times our number. The rebels had six batteries and we had one. (Alexander's of Baltimore, and they knew but little). We fought five hours and retreated about six miles from the field and reorganized, but the enemy did not press us.\n\n\"Our casualties are as follows: Lt. Hutchinson, killed; Capt. Bogardus, wounded in leg and missing; Col. Emerson, wounded in arm, slight; Lt. Col. Fay, leg, slight; Capt. Wiles, slight bruise; Capt. Geo. J. Oaks, (of Rochester) head, thigh, back, and wrist, slight; 1st Lt. McNaughton, Company H, arm.\n\n\"The casualties in company E, of Rochester, are as follows: Henry J. Bell, killed; Sgt. Geiser, wounded in leg, slight; Corp. Seheidnagel, arm; Kleppert, Ehrle, Hartwick, Wm. Kreigg, and Suter, missing. Some of the missing may be heard from.\n\n\"Company E lost the fewest and company G. the most men. Company F. had five killed.\n\n\"Our men fought the rebels well, if we did have to give way. The loss of killed in the division is 121 reported. The rebels lost 300.\n\n\"Capt. Oaks was knocked down and lay senseless for twenty minutes. He has been in hospital but will soon join his division at Washington.\"\n\nDEATH OF CAPT. S. S. WILCOX.—Capt. S. S. Wilcox, of the One Hundred and Fifty-first Regiment, was killed in the battle near Mine Run, Va., last Friday. Capt. W. was but twenty-five years of age, a native of Gasport, Niagara county, and before he joined his regiment, was in the employ of Mr. WOLVERTON, of this city. He was a young gentleman of excellent character, and of unusual business capacities. But he felt it to be his duty to go to the field, and to do so made great social and pecuniary sacrifices. He has died a martyr to his love of country, and his parents and friends will mourn his early death.\n\nDEATH OF CAPT. S. S. Wilcox.—Capt. S. S.

He has died a martyr to his love of country, and. his parents and friends will mourn his early death.\n\nAmong the arrivals here, Saturday, was Capt. F. W. Coleman of the 151st N.\n\nY. V. It is now about two years since Capt. Coleman went with a company from this place, since which he has been in constant service. In the present Virginia Campaign he received a severe wound in the leg which has not yet healed so that he can walk without a crutch. Capt. C. is enjoying excellent health. He is now on duty as a member of an Examining Board to inspect all the army hospitals in the Eastern Department. Brig. Gen. F. H. Warren and Surgeon J. J. Craven, are the other members of the Board. Some time will elapse before Capt. Coleman will be able to resume active duty in the field. We learn that he has been promoted to Major—but has not yet been mustered as such. Lieut. Derrick of Capt. Sheldon's Co., 8th N. Y. Artillery, was also in town Saturday.\n\nCASUALTIES IN TH 151ST.—We are indebted to Chaplain Foote for a complete list of the casualties in the 151st, at the battle of the Monocacy Junction on the 9th inst. Our readers, we know, will thank the Chaplain for this evidence of devotion to the interest of the Regiment and to the gallant men who offer their lives for their country.\n\nPROMOTIONS FROM THE 151ST REGIMENT.\n\nA letter from Captain Imo, of the 151st Regiment, informs us that Benjamin Ambruster, of his company, has been promoted to a 1st Lieutenantcy in the 2d New York (colored) Regiment, and Ed. Hiller and Frank Otto, of the same regiment, are ready to be examined for the same promotion. These gentlemen are all from this city, and enlisted in Capt. Imo's Company as privates. Capt. Imo writes that his men are al in good health and spirits. The 151st Regiment.—This regiment, from Orleans and Niagara counties, seems to have been in the fight at Monocacy with the rebel raiders, for the two following names are reported in a list of casualties:\n\nCol. Emerson, slightly wounded,\n\nLieut. Col. Fay, wounded in the leg.\n\nNo other names of privates or officers are mentioned in any of the New York papers, and it may be two or three days before we can publish the full lists.\n\nThe 151ST.—Very little can yet be heard from our 151st Regiment in the 6th corps. The papers report but few names of wounded—and none of those are of Capt. Coleman's company. A letter, however, from Johnson, who had been detailed for duty in the hospitals, states that H. Turk, of this place was slightly wounded. Of course there is an intense anxiety to hear full particulars. It is possible that they have been through these terrible battles of two weeks without much loss, but their friends at home fear it has been otherwise. We must soon hear the worst."
