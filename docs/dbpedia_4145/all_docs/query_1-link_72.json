        "text": "44th New York Infantry Regiment's Civil War Newspaper Clippings\n\nHONOR TO COL ELLSWORTH.\n\nTO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.\n\nThe recent assassination of the gallant and lamented Ellsworth, and the barbarous manner in which the rebels have thus far conducted their hostilities against the government, has fired anew the zeal of our young men, until all are chafing with impatience to meet the foe.\n\nThe quota of New-York troops called for by the President is already organized; and if they were not too much time would be consumed in organizing under existing laws.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it has been deemed advisable to raise a regiment from among the people of this state; each town and ward to be represented by furnishing one man to be at once armed and equipped by voluntary subscription, and tendered to the general government, to serve during the war, as avengers of the noble blood, spilled on the soil of Virginia on the 24th inst.\n\nTo carry out this purpose, an organization was effected in Albany, Saturday evening, by the adoption of the following resolutions:\n\nResolved, That the undersigned immediately organize an association, to be called the \"Ellsworth Association of the Slate of New-York,\" for the purpose of raising a regiment in honor of the lamented Col. Ellsworth.\n\nThat its officers be a president, treasurer and secretary, and an executive committee of five members.\n\nThat said officers serve during one year; and until others be chosen in their places.\n\nThat subscribers to the funds of this association be members thereof.\n\nThat it be proposed to each town and ward in the state to furnish one able-bodied man for this regiment; said person to be selected from those who shall offer to enlist in the same by a committee of three, to be chosen by the subscribers to the fund in said town or ward.\n\nThat in each town and ward in this state, subscriptions be solicited, not to exceed one dollar from each person, and that the same be immediately forwarded to the treasurer of this association at Albany.\n\nThat the soldier to be selected in each town and ward be an unmarried man, not less than five feet and eight inches in height, active, able-bodied, and not to exceed thirty years of age.\n\nThat as soon as may be, each town and ward report to the secretary the name and address of the soldier chosen by said town or ward, and that it be recommended to each to select men of moral worth, and as far as possible, those who have some knowledge of military evolutions.\n\nThat on notice each person chosen to said regiment report himself for duty, and rendezvous in the city of Albany.\n\nThat with the funds to be subscribed, the men so chosen be mustered into service and divided into companies, and officered by the executive committee and officers of this association, and a regiment formed and officered by the said committee and officers.\n\nThat the funds so subscribed and paid be faithfully applied to the mustering and complete equipment of said regiment, and when the same shall be ready for service it be tendered to the government, for active duty during the war, upon the same terms as other troops, and subject to all existing military regulations of the United States army.\n\nThat the sum required to be raised is about the sum of $150,000, which will fully fit said regiment for the field and furnish it with all necessary equipage.\n\nThat it be recommended to each town and ward in the state to immediately open a correspondence with the secretary at this city, and to circulate subscriptions at once, in order that the regiment may be organized, uniformed, and equipped during the month of June.\n\nOn motion, the following officers of this association were chosen:\n\nPresident—Hon. Geo. H. Thacher, Mayor of Albany.\n\nTreasurer—Hon. Erastus Corning, M. C.\n\nSecretary—Charles Hughes, Clerk Court of Appeals.\n\nThe following executive committee was chosen:\n\nHon. James M. Cook, John K. Porter, Hon. Lyman Tremain, Jacob J. Werner, Henry A. Brigham.\n\nOn motion, resolved; That these proceedings be at once published in all the papers of this state, and active measures be taken for carrying out the purposes of this association; that the names of all subscribers to the fund be transmitted to the secretary at Albany for publication and record; that no funds be disbursed by the treasurer except on vouchers certified by a majority of the executive committee and countersigned by the secretary.\n\nAlbany, May 25, 1861.\n\nGEO. H. THACHER, President.\n\nERASTUS CORNING, Treasurer.\n\nCHARLES HUGHES, Secretary.\n\nLYMAN TREMAIN,\n\nJOHN K. PORTER,\n\nJACOB I. Werner, Executive Committee.\n\nHENRY A. Brigham,\n\nJAMES M. COOK,\n\nTHE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—The Central Ellsworth Association issue the following: To the Town and Ward Ellsworth Associations of the State of New York:\n\nThe Executive Committee of the State Ellsworth Association, announces that the Central Government have accepted the \"People's Ellsworth Regiment,\" but with the condition that the Regiment shall be ready for marching orders within twenty-one days from the 24th uitimo.— This condition the Committee find themselves unable to comply with in consequence of the towns of the State having failed as yet to respond to their call, and thus furnish the men and means to make-up the regiment. Under these circumstances, the Committee have resolved to call together the men already selected, and to allow the towns which have furnished men and means, to select as many more men, from any town in their several counties, as they shall choose, up to the number of five men each, without raising any additional funds, and to muster them into service under the call of the Governor for twenty five thousand men. (Provided, that each man selected shall come up to the standard of qualification, heretofore prescribed by the Committee.)\n\nBy availing themselves of this opportunity, the Government will clothe and arm the men, and thus relieve the Committee from that expanse; and the soldiers of this regiment can avail themselves of the provisions of General Older No. 15, which is as follows:\n\n\" Every volunteer non-commissioned officer, private, musician and artificer, who enters the service of the United States under this plan, shall be paid at the rate of 50 cents, and if a cavalry volunteer, 25cents additional, in lieu of forage, for every twenty miles of travel from his home to the place of muster, the distance to be measured by the shortest usually traveled route; and when honorably discharged, an allowance, at the same rate, from the place of his discharge to his home, and in addition thereto, the sum of one hundred dollars.\n\n\" Any volunteer who may be received into the service of the United States under this plan, and who may be wounded or otherwise disabled in the service, shall be entitled to the benefits which have been or may be conferred on persons disabled in the regular service, and the legal heirs of such as die or may be killed in service, in addition to all arrears of pay and allowances shall receive the sum of one hundred dollars.\"\n\nWith the money collected in the various towns and paid into the treasury of this Association, under our first plan of organization, the Executive Committee will purchase for the use of the regiment such additional articles of uniform, arms and wearing apparel as will add to the comfort and efficiency of the men of this regiment.\n\nAny town desiring to be represented in this Regiment and not heretofore having taken action, can select a man, on raising the sum of twenty dollars or as many men as they choose at that rate, but all men selected must comply with our stand¬ard of qualifications, viz:\n\nThat the soldier to be selected in each town and ward be an unmarried man; not less than five feet eight inches in height, active, able bodied, and not to exceed thirty years of age, and of good moral character.\n\nArrangements have been made by which it is expected that the pay of the men will commence the day after their arrival in this city.\n\nAll men selected before the 8th day of August will report themselves for duly on that day, at the City Hall, in Albany.\n\nAll selected after that date will report themselves for duty at the camp of the regiment in Albany on the 20th of August.\n\nWe earnestly appeal to the patriotic citizens of every town in the State to furnish a representative for this regiment and ask our young men to come forward and give aid to the country in defense of its time-honored flag. We call upon the patriotic press of the State to give publicity to this circular.\n\nBy order of the Committee,\n\nCHARLES HUGHES, Secretary.\n\nTHE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—Senator FERRY writes, apropos of the Ellsworth Regiment: CHICAGO, June 10, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nI have just received the enclosed circular, which is perhaps stale at your place. I hope our people are moving in the matter, and proper steps taken for a complete organization. I shall not be at home in time to take any part in it, but am good for my dollar, and should not only be very willing but very glad to take hold of a laboring oar to move it forward. I knew Ellsworth well, and was for many years very much attached to him. Such a regiment as is proposed, if property selected and officered, without any of the red tapism that has too frequently shown forth, would be very useful and effective. Their very name would carry a feeling of dread and apprehension to the contemptible wretches who look upon assassination and poisoning as the proper instruments of war, theft as honorable, high-minded chivalry.\n\nYours, truly, WM. H. FERRY.\n\nThe Ellsworth Regiment.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nSeveral copies of the HERALD are taken in this town, and a good many in the county; possibly therefore through it, I may be able to reach some patriotic party, and cause a move in this and other towns, in behalf of the People's Ellsworth Regiment. Every patriot should feel humiliated at the thought that any town or ward in the State will neglect to choose and send a good man to take his place in the ranks of this most noble regiment, and especially that a town so rich as this in all the elements of material prosperity should be careless of such an enterprise at such a time. So far as I am aware, not a movement has been made in Otsego county—I am sure not in this town—to aid in filling this regiment. Men of Springfield, men of Otsego, shall this be? There is yet time. The men will be accepted, and the funds are wanted. Let a stand be taken at once, and let Springfield give the watchword, \"Remember Ellsworth.\n\nF.\n\nEast Springfield, Otsego Co., July 31, 1861.\n\nPeople's Ellsworth Regiment.\n\nALBANY BARRACKS, August 16, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nAs a member of the People's Ellsworth Regiment, I wish the privilege of saying a few words through the columns of your paper to the loyal and patriotic citizens of Oneida and adjacent counties. The original design of the Committee was that this regiment should be raised, armed and equipped ready for duty by the people in the several towns and wards of the Empire State, that it might emphatically be the People's Regiment, by having one representative from each locality; but from some reason the towns were so slow to take action in the matter that the Committee were forced to change their original plan, by providing that towns which had selected a man and raised the requisite sum, viz.: $100, could send four more; and towns that have not taken action, by raising $20, can send a man. There are now about 180 men in the barracks, and I challenge any academy in the State to show as much talent and intellect as we have among these volunteers. Nearly all are from the best families of their respective towns, and of good moral character, and I can confidently say that never was there a regiment formed which had for its basis such good material. There is an erroneous sentiment that seems to prevail throughout Central New York that this regiment is got up for Albany favoritism; this is a mistake. There are many applicants for office from the said city, yet they stand no better chance than applicants from other portions of the State, nor, indeed, as good a chance as many from Erie county. One word for Erie county—she stands A No. 1 in this enterprise. There came from that county, on the 8th, thirty-five fine young men, who have elected for Captain and First Lieutenant Messrs. E. B. Chapin and Frank Sidway, both well versed in military tactics, and highly esteemed citizens of Buffalo; the other commissioned and non-commissioned officers will be chosen from Erie county and that vicinity, and the company will be filled up on the 20th with representatives who are from that part of the State. New York city sends a full company of one hundred men; we expect them every day. I am surprised that Oneida county is not more numerously represented—only two or three, and not one from the city of Utica; though I am most happy to state that the town of Vernon has the tallest representative, in the person of the well known Doctor Landon, who measures six feet six inches in his stockings, and held a Captain's commission in the Mexican war, acquitting himself with great credit. We hope neither the town nor county will think that because they have sent the tallest man that is all they can do, but there ought and indeed may be a full company officered by good, efficient and capable men from Central New York. Cannot some one move speedily in the matter; without action is taken immediately, it will be too late, for doubtless the regiment will be full before many days. Some four hundred additional men are expected here on the 20th.\n\nLet Central New York be fully and faithfully represented in this regiment, which will without doubt be the best that enters the service. \"A word to the wise is sufficient.\"\n\nP.S.—Twenty-five men from Duchess county and vicinity have just arrived this, Friday, evening.\n\nH. M. G.\n\nTHE PEOPLE'S ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.\n\nALBANY ELLSWORTH BARRACKS,\n\nAugust 21, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nI am anxious to have a few lines inserted in the HERALD, in regard to the \"People's Ellsworth Regiment,\" of which I am proud to sat I am a member. Be it a shame to Oneida county that she only has three representatives in the Regiment, at the present writing, I will here say that Vernon has a \"big thing.\" I allude to Dr. Landon, who is the tallest man in the regiment. He stands six feet six inches, and held a captain's commission in the Mexican War, in which he served with distinction. There should be at least one company composed of and officered by men from our county. Herkimer, Madison and Chenango, have responded nobly to the call. Members are arriving daily from different parts of the State, which is steadily filling up the regiment.\n\nALBANY EVENING JOURNAL.\n\nELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—This Regiment will be paid off to-morrow. ERASTUS CORNING will advance the money to Maj. RICHARDSON, in anticipation of its reception from Washington. It will require about $20,000.\n\nTHE ...TION TO THE GALLERY ... FOURTH REGIMENT.—The remnant of the original 44th (Ellsworth) Regiment, which left here in 1861 under Col. Stryker, reached their homes in this city yesterday. The ovation made on the occasion of their arrival was indeed a grand one. Long before the hour announced for their arrival, the people of our city began to assemble to welcome back the war-worn heroes. They were detained an hour on the road, owing to courtesies extended to them by the citizens of Hudson, where they were kindly cared for. The members of the 44th that have been discharged from service, owing to wounds and otherwise, paraded under command of Capt. Alex. McRoberts, and wore the badge of the corps, a red leaf. They were preceded by Schreiber's Brass Band, also wearing the badge, which Band, it will be remembered, left this city and proceeded to the front with the Ellsworths. The 22d Veteran Reserve Corps, and 16th Massachusetts Battery, from the Troy Road Barracks, were also out in full force, and acted as an escort to the heroes. Capt. Harris Parr announced the arrival of the veterans by firing & salute from the pier at the corner of the cut. On the arrival of the 44th upon this side, they were received with military honors by the escort, when the line was formed and a parade through our public streets took place. The appearance and looks of the brave fellows speak in terms stronger than we can write them of the hardships and service they have passed through in going up State street the Ellsworths halted in front of the residence of Erastus Corning, Esq., and saluted his lady. It will be remembered that this family presented the Ellsworths, on their departure, a suit of colors. The veterans were then escorted to the Capitol, where they were properly received by Gov. Seymour, who made a very happy speech, welcoming the brave heroes back home again. Col. Connor responded. Subsequently the Ellsworths were feasted with a dinner at the Congress Hall.—Those members of the Ellsworths who belonged out of town were furnished quarters at the City Hall, where Col. Connor's headquarters are for the present. (Knickerbocker, Sept. 30, '64)\n\nWill not some of our patriotic young men, in the towns that have not taken action, be induced to make the effort immediately. Circulate your subscription in your respective towns. If you are not able to raise more than $20, do this and send your best man. Our regiment is composed of men representing nearly all the trades and professions, and many graduated from the best collages in the country. Many left good situations and made great sacrifices willingly, esteeming it a duty to serve the country in its hour of peril. Major Stryker is in temporary command of the regiment. We are under drill from four to six hours each day. All of our officers are experienced and competent men. Many of them formerly belonged to the celebrated Chicago Zouaves, and saw service with the Fire Zouaves at Bull's Run. Our leisure hours are devoted to ball playing, sparring, reading and writing &c. We while away the evenings in singing, dancing and the like. We have a Glee Club called the \"Ellsworth Glee Club,\" who discourse splendid music accompanied by a melodeon. We have a temperance organization which boasts of 106 members, and still increasing. The pledge is that we abstain from the use of intoxicating Liquors, while we remain in the regiment, unless prescribed by the surgeon. I would say that our food is of the best quality in every respect, and we have all are want. We have excellent accomodations [sic] for washing, so none have an excuse for being unclean. Our uniform, which is to be the regular U. S., is expected this week. The fatigue suit, I understand will be a drab color, made up in Zouave style. The examining physician gave us a compliment by saying that we were the finest body of men that he ever examined. Many visitors are on the grounds each day. I heard one gentleman remark, that he would see the regiment leave, if he had to walk from Saratoga to do it. The father of the late Col. Ellsworth was on the grounds to-day, and was very enthusiastically received by the boys. The Colonel has not been chosen as yet, but we can rest assured that he will be the right man when found. The late Col. Farnham of the Fire Zouaves was to have been the Lieut. Colonel, but for his sudden and unexpected death, which was properly observed by the regiment. How can one think here of war, of strife and civil discord. We almost forget all these when we rasume our .... It seems more like a school, and in fact it is the \"school of the soldier.\"—Would that our soldiers would remember that they are not only our country's defenders, but her pride. She points to them as did the noble Roman matron to her jewels. They are no mercenaries, no tools of a despot, but intelligent and manly citizens, who peril life for freedom and law, because they know their worth. They are the pride, too, of the loved ones at home. Many a mother speaks with tearful joy, of her \"boy\" in the army, many a sister tells of a noble-hearted brother. Let these dear ones have no cause to _lu_ for them when they shall return, as less _ure, less worthy of their love and pride, than when they went forth at the call of duty. Yours for the Union, D. S. Jr.\n\nUtica Morning Herald\n\nAND DAUILY GAZETTE.\n\nFrom the Ellsworth Regiment.\n\nHeadquarters People's Ellsworth Regiment,\n\nAlbany, Oct. 8, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nOur regiment is now full to the maximum standard, and the \"Boys\" are anxiously awaiting marching orders. We shall remain here probably not longer than ten days at the most. We paraded for review by His Excellency Gov. Morgan, yesterday, and the people all say it was a fine affair. The Governor and staff came upon the parade ground, well mounted and dressed in the full military uniform, and were received by the firing of the proper salute. About 800 of our men were upon the ground with well filled knapsacks, which proved to be quite a load before the four hours were past, the time which we had to carry them. We marched before His Excellency, on common, quick and double quick time, went through various flanking, marching, and musket exercises; and the citizens say it was the best exhibition of the kind ever witnessed in Albany. There were probably from ten to fifteen thousand spectators present of both sexes who seemed much pleased with the performance.\n\nWe are using the Springfield musket now, but have the promise of soon exchanging them for the Minnie rifled musket. Our fatigue uniforms, which are not like any other Zouave cut, are making, and those that have seen them say they are very nice. We expect to receive some pay from Uncle Sam's servant, the paymaster, in a few days, as the pay rolls are nearly completed. We have a fully organized Christian Association which promises to be a nourishing and profitable affair; and have also a Literary Society well under way, the exercises of which will be of a miscellaneous character, consisting of debates, essays, orations, &c. If we can carry a library and we think we can, these institutions will be made of great use by way of guarding against the demoralizing influences of the camp, and keeping up a taste for literary pursuits. Health and hilarity pervade our ranks as much as ever, there being but one in the hospital. The officers still retain the most unshaken confidence of the soldiers, especially Col. Stryker commanding, who is loved and respected by the entire regiment and all who know him.\n\nUndoubtedly all are aware that the people of the great Empire State are looking to this, their \"pet regiment,\" expecting hard work, and fidelity to the glorious cause that has brought us together, and we trust that they will not be disappointed in their expectations. We have no sympathy with any \"peace measure.\" All the peace, or compromise measure that our regiment will look at, is the unconditional surrender of the Confederate army, and the hanging of the secession leaders. Undoubtedly should these semi-secession editors, and perfidious civilians, visit our barracks to promulgate their pernicious peace doctrines, they would find themselves under \"marching orders\" with very short time to \"pack up.\" And they would probably fare no better in any regiment in our army. For the same love of country—a country, the principles of which are the most pure ever witnessed by intelligent beings—that animated our fathers, pervades the breasts of our soldiers in this trying hour. Caesar aut nullus, cried the old Romans. So now our armies and patriotic men will shout, our country or nothing.\n\nYours for the Union.\n\nM. Shaw.\n\nThe People's Ellsworth Regiment.\n\nHEADQUARTERS PEOPLE'S ELLSWORTH REGIMENT,\n\nAlbany, Oct. 16, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nOur marching orders are at hand—we are ordered to leave our barracks next Monday at 1 p. m., for Washington. We are to be armed with the Minnie rifled muskets. The above orders were read on parade at 4 this P. M. The boys have been cheering incessantly nearly two hours, on the strength of this good news. I write you these few lines in addition, hoping that they may be somewhat interesting to the readers of the HERALD. The various rumors that have been circulated respecting our marching orders and destination, have kept the boys on the gui vive for the last fortnight. During this time Madam Rumor has appointed the day many times, and we have as often been disappointed. If some of these reports had been official, we should ere this have been encamped in the land of Secesh. Some would have located us in Missouri or Kentucky; others, Virginia. I must admit that the state of affairs looks quite \"dusty\" in each of these departments. I am sure our companions in arms would gladly welcome us wherever we might go. Our regiment, according to this morning's report puts our number 1,026 men. I think this report is not large enough by twenty-four men at least. Recruits continue to arrive daily. We will take them as long as we remain, Col. Stryker having the privilege to increase the regiment to 1,100 men. I am sorry there are not more Oneida county boys in this crack regiment. I am sure some will live to see the awful mistake they made in not coming here. The general health of the regiment is good, and we are comfortably located in the large and spacious brick barracks which are so well adapted for the use made of them. We find much better protection here from the chilly nights of autumn than we did in the wooden barracks. If we now and then have a chill, which is but momentary, we do not suffer from the pangs of hunger, as our commissary department is always well stocked. Several members of Company D received last week from their fair friends, the patriotic young ladies of Norwich, several large boxes, which looked quite suspicious owing to their great size, but when opened were found to contain a host of good things, such as an epicure might have envied. I, having a ticket for the collation, was able to judge of the goodness of the various edibles. If the fair donors had been present, they would have received many thanks for their kindness.\n\nOur parade ground is visited by hundreds daily to witness the drill and martial appearance of the boys, and none seem to regret having made the visit. Yesterday, we were reviewed by Gen. Rathbone and staff, which attracted a crowd, as usual. We went through the manual exercise and various battalion movements. But the main feature of the day was the \"charge\" made on double quick, the whole regiment being drawn up in line of battle. The other was the presentation of a beautiful silk flag to Company F by the ladies of Albany. Presentations have been the order of the day for some time past. Many captains have received presents from their re¬spective companies and friends.\n\nThe Regiment formed a hollow square previ¬ous to dismissal, for the purpose of introducing to the boys Mr. Ellsworth, father of the late Col. Ellsworth. When introduced by the Colonel, every soldier's head was uncovered, and not a cheer was heard. We remained in this position some moments, expecting he would make some remarks. He seemed to take a careful survey of each man, and at the last seemed to be so much affected that he was unable to speak. Perhaps his silence and the emotions which caused it told more than language could express. The occa¬sion was truly a solemn one to all.\n\nRev. Mr. Pease, of Saratoga county, has been appointed Chaplain for the Regiment. We have needed one for some time, but I am confident we have the right man at last. Mr. Pease is a Presbyterian. He has traveled extensively in the Old World, and thus having an opportunity to store his mind well with the incidents of his travels, and having an opportunity to study well the character and habits of men, consequently is well fitted for the position he has been urged to accept. He gave his first discourse last Sabbath. He remarked that he was of Old Revolutionary stock, his grandfather having fought at the battle of Bennington, and the fire of old '76 burned in his breast. He came here not for pay or hoping to get office; all he wanted was his bread and butter. He now recognized no denomination, but was here as a Christian, hoping to do good among us, and to stand as an electric telegraph between the 44th and Heaven.\n\nI have omitted much which is needless to repeat, as it was noticed in a letter of my comrades in last Saturday's HERALD.\n\nI have been informed upon reliable authority that we are to have a grand reception in Washington, and, in fact, the whole route from here will be one continued ovation. In a few days, at least, we shall be near the scene of conflict, and if we are called upon we shall endeavor to do our duty. We go to sustain a government to which all alike owe allegiance. It is not a war of hate and rapine, but one in which our principles and honor are involved. God is on our side. The sense of right is plain to all. It has the approval of conscience. It exalts the struggle into the heroic. We are fighting for truth, (which is mighty and will prevail,) for freedom, for national existence, for the hopes of humanity in all the future. We should go forth into battle with this motto, \"God and our country,\" inscribed on our banners. When our work is over, we hope to return to our homes with our country redeemed, united and saved.\n\nYours for the 44th,\n\nD. S., Jr., Co. D.\n\nDeparture of the Ellsworth Regiment—A Great Time Expected.\n\nThe announcement made on Saturday that the People's Ellsworth Regiment would leave to-day for the seat of war, caused great excitement not only among the members of that body, but among citizens generally. At the barracks yesterday there was a constant stream of visitors, of both men and women, all anxious to see their friends and acquaintances. Numerous carriages from country towns were also present. It was indeed a day of much excitement. The Regiment was yesterday furnished with the leggins, which adds very much to their appearance, as it certainly does to their convenience. The articles were made by Ald. L. M. Rodgers, and it may be stated as a somewhat speakable fact that they were delivered two days before the agreed time. The dress parade yesterday afternoon was largely attended, and was gone through with to the entire satisfaction of all present. During the day Dr. Rogers, who is chaplain of Gen. Rathbone's staff, preached to the soldiers in the open air. It is gratifying to state that the greater portion of the Regiment were present, and listened with marked attention.\n\nCol. Stryker yesterday morning issued orders to his Captains, that they must have their commands promptly in line at 1 o'clock to-day, as at that hour he should start. The Regiment will proceed to the residence of Hon. Erastus Corning, when his lady will formally present the Color to the Regiment. The presentation speech will be made by Charles Hughes, Esq., and Col. Stryker will reply. The Regiment will then proceed to the Steamboat Landing, where it will embark on board of barges. Mr. J. Austin has very kindly tendered the use of his steam-tug, the Austin, to draw the barges.\n\nCompany A Zouave Cadets, Capt. Van Vechten, and Company B, 10th Regiment, Capt. Ainsworth, will escort the Regiment to the boat. Chief of Police Adams has directed that a sufficient force of the police be employed in keeping State street and Broadway clear, so that the Regiment will have a fine opportunity of displaying itself and allowing our citizens to witness their evolutions. Should the day prove favorable we expect to see a greater sight than Albany or Albanians ever before witnessed.\n\nMessrs. Taylor, Brayton & Co., the contractors, have made up seven thousand huge sandwiches with which to feed the regiment until it arrives in New York. Coffee will be made on board the barges, so that the soldiers will have a good time in getting to the metropolis.\n\nArrangements have been made to give the Ellsworth's a proper reception and entertainment in New York.\n\nTheir new uniform, of the Zouave pattern, is not all manufactured as yet; but it was said yesterday, that Col. Stryker would let such companies as could be uniformed complete, wear the new clothing to-day. This would let our citizens see how the regiment will look when completely uniformed. We are sorry to learn that Capt. Revere is quite sick from diptheria. He was able to be about yesterday, though not to take his company to the dress parade.\n\nThe Regiment will go direct from New York to Jersey City, and there take the cars for Washington; arrived there, Col. Stryker will report to the Secretary of War. What disposition will then be made of the Regiment is only known to the Secretary.\n\nIt is a matter of regret that the Ellsworth's go off without the Springfield Rifles. It has been found impossible to furnish them with this particular pattern of weapon, but those they have will answer until others are furnished.\n\nMayor Thacher has issued the following order to the Police Department:\n\nCITY OF ALBANY, MAYOR'S OFFICE, OCT. 21ST,\n\n1861.—In order to facilitate the passage of the Ellsworth Regiment and to promote the convenience of the public, the Police Force will be required to keep State street from the Capitol to the Exchange, and Broadway from the Exchange to the point of embarkation, free from obstructions of every kind from 3P. M. till the Regiment shall arrive at the boat. Drivers of hacks, carts and vehicles of every description will take notice and conform to the above requisition.\n\nGEO. H. THACHER, Mayor.\n\nFROM THE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.\n\nHEADQUARTERS 44TH REGIMENT N. Y. S. V.,\n\nHALL'S HILL, Va., Nov. 5th, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nTen days' experience in camp has given us a little taste of the pleasures of a soldier's life. We are comfortably situated at present, and the only question that perplexes the mind of not a few is, can we winter comfortably with our present conveniences and clothing? Instead of leaving this question to the officers, who care as much for us as we for ourselves, it is thought proper to discuss it in every group that assembles upon the corners. Our friends may rest assured that when the \"cold stormy winds of December\" sound their doleful dirges over the whited hills of the North, we shall be cosily housed in some snug place in \"Dixie.\"\n\nThere are more cases of sickness than usual at present. This might be expected on leaving the thick-walled barracks and elevated bunks for beds of boughs on the damp ground, protected from the cold and damp only by the thin covering of a canvas tent. There are quite a number of cases of the measles, and they are daily increasing. This epidemic is likely to visit all that have not had them. The officers look well to the cleanliness and healthy condition of the camp-ground, spending much time daily in sweeping and putting things in order. This is also true of the neighboring camps. Our regiment has been assigned to Gen. Butterfield's brigade—Gen. Porter's division. Gen. Butterfield spoke to us to-day in regard to the reputation that we had gained, and the pleasure that he had in knowing that we were to be placed in his brigade. He gave us timely warning against loosing our reputation by inattention or carelessness on our part, or by supposing that we knew it all. His remarks will undoubtedly be of great benefit to us.\n\nForty of our boys went on a foraging expedition one day last week, and succeeded in getting ten large loads of hay and a \"secesher,\" who had wandered from his camp in search of some liquor. He expressed great confidence in his cause, and regretted that he could fight us no longer. He is represented as being poorly dressed and dirty.\n\nLast Saturday, one hundred and forty of our men, and enough from the other regiments to increase the number to about two or three hundred, went on picket duty. The rain poured down all day and nearly all night without cessation, causing us to think of times of which we have read. Some of us, kept in reserve, spent the night shivering under the broad branches of the fruitless apple trees, while others fared but little better in the out-buildings and wagons of the farm. Quite a singular incident occurred during the first night that we were out. Lieut.-Col. Rice was taken prisoner by a Union picket. The sentinel did not have the right countersign. Each supposing the other to be an enemy, both made ready their revolvers, but fortunately neither attempted to fire. After the Colonel had satisfied himself that his captors were friends, he went back with them about three miles to headquarters, where it was shown that it was all right.\n\nA scouting party, detailed from the reserve, searched the country several miles beyond our pickets, without finding any rebel camps or rebel pickets. It is generally believed that there are no rebels within ten or fifteen miles of us. Various opinions are entertained relative to an advanced position of the army, but undoubtedly the better conclusion is that there will be no advance movement made till Gen. McClellan is fully prepared to give rebellion the finishing stroke. This may be within a few days, and may be many weeks first. The army is increasing by thousands almost every day, and the most thorough and formidable preparations are being made for a decisive victory. This demonstration will be made at the right time and in the right place, for the responsibility rests upon the right men. But why need there be haste in this movement? So long as our army is daily stronger, and so long as the rebels are falling back, and so long as our troops are filing into their defenseless coast cities, capturing forts and confiscating property, why need there be a great sacrifice of life by a hasty attack on their fortified places. But there may be expected great results when the grand forward movement is made. Failure is not on our banner. The Richmond Whig may say, in despair of their cause: \"The possibility of success is not within the range of accident;\" but not so with our cause. We may safely say, in view of our superior financial and numerical strength, and in view of the righteousness of the cause in which we are engaged, if we keep in remembrance the Overruling Power that gave our fathers success in war, the possibility of failure is not within the range of accident. Dieu defend le droit, (God defend the right.) Yours for the Union,\n\nM.SHAW.\n\nFROM THE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.\n\nHEADQUARTERS 44TH REGIMENT N. Y. S. V.,\n\nCAMP BUTTERFIELD, HALL'S HILL, VA.,\n\nNovember 28th, 1861.\n\nTo the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald:\n\nAs your paper is taken by most of the citizens of Trenton and vicinity, I thought I would write a few lines to you to let you and my friends know how we are situated, and if you feel inclined you can publish them. We are encamped upon Hall's Hill, one and a half miles from Munson Hill, and three miles from Fall's Church. We arrived here the 28th of October, (just one week from the day we left Albany,) about 7 1/2 o'clock, after a tedious march of about, 10 hours and 18 miles travel, and were quite surprised to find that the 83d Pennsylvania regiment had pitched our tents and had a good warm supper ready for us, which we did ample justice to, I assure you.\n\nWe are in Gen. Butterfield's Brigade and Porter's Division. Our brigade is composed of the New York 17th and 44th regiments, and the Pennsylvania 83d and Michigan 2d regiments. We drill about six hours a day, so you see we don't have much time to ourselves. We have knapsack drill from 7 to 8 A. M.; battalion drill from 10 to 12; and brigade drill from 2 to 5 P. M. We drill mostly in skirmishing, bayonet exercise and target shooting. The measles have broken out in camp and most of the men have had them. We lost six men last week, whose names I here give: Company C, George W. Schermerhorn, of Albany county, and Nathan A. Wilson, of Salem, Washington county; Company D, Elias D. Gardner, of Burlington, Otsego county; Company E, Albert C. Belcher, of Newark Valley, Tioga county; Company F, Charles W. Chappel, of Schuyler Lake, Otsego county; Company I, John F. Hime, of Hamburgh, Erie county.\n\nLast week Wednesday, our regiment, together with 71,000 more troops, were reviewed by General McClellan and President Lincoln, in a field of about 200 acres, near Bailey's Cross Roads. It was the largest number of troops ever reviewed at one time. There was a perfect sea of heads as far as the eye could reach. From 9 o'clock A. M. until 1 P. M. every road leading to the review ground was crowded as far as you could see. At 1 o'clock the President and General made their appearance on the ground. They were greeted with cheers from the men as they passed, and our band struck up \"Hail to the Chief.\" A salute from the batteries was also fired as they came upon the ground.\n\nLast Sunday, Gen. McClellan came to see us parade, and when we were done he told our Colonel that our regiment was the best drilled and finest looking regiment that he had ever reviewed. That was something big for the Commander-in-Chief of our army to say, when there are so many fine regiments in the field.\n\nLast Tuesday night, a messenger came into camp post haste, with the report that our pickets had been attacked by the rebels and driven in two miles.—\n\nFive regiments were sent out, but it was found to be the Pennsylvania 3d regiment of cavalry that had been attacked, about nine miles beyond our lines.—They were surrounded by the rebels and had to fight their way out. They lost 15 men, and a sorrier looking lot of men you never saw than they were when they came within our lines—some on foot—some on horse back—some minus hats, coats, &c., with their faces and arms scratched by the bushes. One lieutenant came in the next morning with his head cut by a sabre; he had lain out in the woods all night. Our pickets were advanced one mile yesterday; they are now about three miles from Fall's Church towards Centerville. We expect to move on in a few days, but in what direction we don't know; we hope it is South Carolina, for it is so cold here that we are willing to have a little fighting just for the sake of getting into a warmer climate.\n\nYours, for the country,\n\nSergeant GARDNER S. PARKER,\n\nCompany D, 44th Regiment, N. Y. S. V.\n\n… and w... beneficial. The army is in much better condition for service than when it came into Maryland. The men have lost that haggard, despairing look and appear like themselves again. True, the old enthusiasm has not, and probably never can be aroused again, but there is an earnest wish to have the war ended at once and a willingness to do anything and every-thing to accomplish this, that perhaps will answer just as well. The common remark is, \"we have seen enough of fighting, but we are willing to march and fight if we can only bring the war to a close.\" With such a spirit \"the army\" will make its mark in the coming campaign. Our regiment is now the second as regards numbers in the Brigade. Two of the old companies, E and C, have been consolidated with the others and two new ones take their places. These, with the recruits for the old companies, have increased our number up to four hundred and seventy-five. We begin to make a respectable appearance again when drawn up in line. Still, it is not the old 44th, and can never seem the same to the original members. A year ago yesterday we crossed into Virginia, a thousand strong. To-day, not two hundred of that number are in the ranks. Should the future prove as disastrous to us as the past, the number who see the end of their term of enlistment, will be fearfully small. We all hope for better things but fear the worse.\n\nGen. Butterfield reviewed us to day for the last time. He goes, as I understand, to take command of a division. A braver and better officer cannot be found in the army. Were all like him, the rebellion would soon be crushed. Col. Stockton of the 10th Michigan commands the brigade at present. We are under \"marching orders\" and expect every day to move. Whether we are to go to a new picket ground, cross the river, or go towards Washington we know not. It is something to know that there is a prospect of our moving. It does not seem possible that Government will keep the six hundred thousand new men idle all the fall and winter. I should think one such experience would suffice. But in these times we must be prepared to expect anything and it may be the old policy will be carried on still longer. The weather has been cod, very cold, for a few days past. Many of us left our knapsacks with our overcoats and extra clothing at Washington and, as a consequence, we suffer from the cold very much. This is one of the ills of a soldier's life, but we hope it will soon be rectified. The health of the regiment is unusually good, much better than at any time since we went to the Peninsula.\n\nIn my next I hope to be able to report some progress towards finishing up the War. It certainly is time and it must be done soon. Truly Yours,\n\nM. H. B.\n\nWOUNDED IN THE 44TH REGIMENT.—The Tribune gives the following list of the wounded in the 44th (Ellsworth) regiment in Thursday's battle.\n\nThe companies are not designated:\n\nLieut. B. Thomas, abdomen; Capt. B. Munger, groin; Lieut. Brickman, side; John Breckett, arm; Thompson Barrick, arm; John Bresler, slightly; V. U. Goderich, slightly; Samuel Risley, slightly; Aaron Esshond, arm; W. W. Smith, shoulder; G. W. Hobart, leg; Frank Scott, hand; Peter Hollawich, foot; M. F. Graham, breast; Delos Thomson, face; J. Hanney, leg.\n\nCOL. ROOT SAFE.—A telegram was received yesterday morning from Captain H. R. S. Colton, 94th Regiment N. Y. Vol., bringing the joyful intelligence that Col. A. R. Root had been paroled by the rebel Gen. A. P. Hill, and was in Washington, the guest of Col. Albert J. Meyers. No particulars with reference to his wound are given, but it is stated that he is doing well. May he soon be able to receive home care and the congratulations of his friends.\n\nFuneral.\n\nThe funeral of Lieut. E. L. Dunham, late of the 44th Reg't N. Y. Vols., who was killed at the battle of Gettysburg, will be held at Hamilton Centre on Sunday next, at 1 o'clock P. M. Rev. C.E. Hewes, late Chaplain of the 14th, will officiate.\n\nTHE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—Co. A, the Erie county company in the Ellsworth Regiment lost four killed and seventeen wounded in the last battle. Among the killed was Capt. Kraft, commanding the company. The Regiment lost 111 in all, more than one-third of the number it went in with.\n\nMORNING EXPRESS.\n\nTHE 44TH (ELLSWORTH) REGIMENT.—Captain E. S. Johnson, of Schodack, has received a letter from his son, Lieut. Seth Johnson, of the gallant 4th Regiment, in which it is stated that the regiment had the extreme advance in the crossing of the army to attack the Rebels.\n\nTHE WOUNDED IN ALBANY REGIMENTS.—The following are reported among the wounded in the late battles. Those in the 44th are reported slightly wounded and in hospital at Washington:—\n\n44TH REGIMENT.\n\nAsaph Holdridge, Co. G.\n\nSergt. W. Johnson, Co. G,\n\nJames Bauen, Co. C,\n\nAndrew J. Taylor, Co. G,\n\nJames Hendrickson, Co. F,\n\nLieut. Huested, by a shell.\n\nThe 44th.\n\nIn the battle of Gettysburg, the 44th N. Y. (\"Ellsworth\") Regiment went in with three hundred men, and of that number one hundred and eleven were killed, wounded, and missing. DAVID DUNHAM, Jr., of this town, writes that the men on each side of him were killed and a ball passed through his own coat sleeve.\n\nLOCAL MATTERS.\n\nFROM THE 44TH (ELLSWORTH) REGIMENT.—The following extract of a letter from a member of the 44th will be found interesting by those having friends in that regiment:\n\nIN FRONT OF THE ENEMY AT GETTYSBURG,\n\nPENN., July, 1863.\n\nAbout half-past two we received orders to go the front, and about half-past three we took our position on a hill, and just in time to save our flank, for we had not more than got in position before a brigade of rebels charged upon us, but were handsomely repulsed. We either killed, wounded or took prisoners more than four-fifths of the 4th and 5th Texas regiments. The musketry fire was about the severest that we were ever under, and lasted till dark. In all, we had 111 killed and wounded—more than one-third of those we went in with—but night soon put an end to the firing. We lost more in this fight than we ever did in any other. Our brigade commander was wounded, so Col. Rice is in command of the brigade now. This fight is the first one in which we ever had any officers killed. Capt. Lorbey and Lieut. Dunham were shot dead, and one Captain and three Lieutenants wounded.\n\nTHE CITY AND VICINITY.\n\nWOUNDED OF CO. A, 44TH REGIMENT.—The following wounded of Co. A, 44th Regiment, N. Y. V., are now in the hospital at Gettysburg: Joseph Harnagan, leg; Robt. Burns, thigh; Wm. M. Morris, knee; Henry C. Kenele, eye; Allen J. Herd, neck and breast; John Steele, thigh; S. Cheesman, foot; Thos. Hunt, leg; Lewis F. Ferram, face; Justan Bennett, back; Julian Rowlton, knee; Jacob Wagner, arm; Wm. Cunningham, shoulder.\n\nAPPOINTMENT.—Lieut. CHAS. E. PEASE, of this city, formerly of the Forty-fourth New York regiment, has been appointed Assistant Adjutant General, with the rank of Captain, and assigned to duty on Gen. VAN ALLEN'S Staff.\n\nWounded.—The only member of the 44th Regiment from this vicinity whose name appears among the wounded at the battle of Gettysburg, is Henry L. Todd. Mr. Todd is well remembered here as a steady and very intelligent young carpenter, who worked a year or two for the Waits.\n\nPERSONAL.—Lieut. Col. Connor, of the 44th Regiment, is in town. He was wounded in the arm at the battle of Fredericksburg. Lieut. Col. Conner's name seldom appears in print, but he is nevertheless one of the best officers in that, or any other regiment.\n\nTHE FORTY-FOURTH.—In a letter to E. S. Johnson, Esq., of Schodack Landing, from his son, Lt. J., of the 44th, it is stated that the Regiment had the extreme advance in the crossing of the army to attack the Rebels.\n\nLOCAL AFFAIRS.\n\nFROM THE FORTY-FOURTH REGIMENT.—We make the following extract from a letter written by a member of Company F, 4th (Ellsworth) Regiment:\n\nWe left our new camp on the 28th of May, and are now at Banks's Ford, a very handsome place. Our brigade extends from Banks' Ford to Richard's Ford, a distance of about eight miles. There are four Regiments in this brigade, viz: the 83d Pennsylvania, 20th Maine, 16th Michigan, and 44th New York Volunteers. When we came here there was one company of cavalry doing picket, which we relieved. Our regiment is in two parts—the right wing at the right of the Ford, and the left wing at or near the centre—and the 1st Ohio battery of six brass twelve pounders—three guns with each wing.\n\nThe rebel pickets are on the other side of the river, and ours this side. They do not fire at each other. The pickets of both sides go in swimming. The rebel pickets are not permitted to converse with us. All they say is, if we don't fire they will not. To-day one of their pickets was sitting with his back turned toward us, and one of our boys, named Lynch, swam over before he was discovered by the \"reb,\" and ejaculated, \"Hallo, old boy, what are you doing there?\" The fellow looked around apparently amazed at seeing the Union soldier in the water, and replied, \"come over here quick.\" Lynch \"couldn't see it,\" in that light, and immediately returned to his companions.\n\nAnother of the boys swam across and got a Richmond paper, and came back to camp \"safe and sound.\"\n\nAs I remarked before, this is the nicest place I have ever seen since leaving home. I write this letter in an old house—or, at least, made old by the soldiers. It is pretty well gone to ruin. But I don’t think we can enjoy the pleasure of stopping here long, as, while I am writing, it is intimated by the \"knowing ones\" that we have received orders to move. If we stay I shall endeavor to give you a better idea of the place in my next. H. B.\n\nDEPARTURE OF THE PEOPLE'S REGIMENT.\n\nALBANY, Oct. 21.\n\nThe Ellsworth regiment, numbering 1,060 muskets, left this afternoon for Washington. There was a perfect ovation at the departure of this Regiment, whose members have won hosts of friends during their sojourn at this depot. They are decidedly the finest body of troops that have left the city since the war commenced. Prior to their departure, a handsome banner was presented to the regiment, by the wife of Hon. Erastus Corning, with appropriate ceremonies.\n\nWe see that our fellow townsman First Lieutenant Charles E. Pease, Forty-fourth New York, has been appointed Assistant Adjutant General, with the rank of captain, and assigned to duty with Brigadier General Van Allen.\n\nThe following parody on \"Rock me to sleep, mother,\" was written by a member of Co. D, 44th Regiment, a resident of this city, and was recently read before the Debating Society of that Regiment:\n\nTHE RECRUIT'S LAMENT.\n\nBackward, roll backward, oh time, in your flight,\n\nMake me a citizen just for a night;\n\nTake me away from this valley of mud,\n\nBore me no more with powder and blood.\n\nBear me away from this fountain of tears,\n\nFar from the sound of orders and jeers;\n\nI have grown weary of Uncle Sam's work,\n\nWeary of living on \"hard tack\" and pork.\n\nBackward, roll backward, oh time, in my flight,\n\nMake me a citizen just for a night;\n\nWhy did you torture me, Corporal, thus,\n\nWhy get me into this devilish muss;\n\nHad you no heart in your bosom of clay,\n\nThus to entice me from freedom away;\n\nDid you not know (that's where the shoe pinches)\n\nThat hanging is better than dying by inches?\n\nBackward, turn backward, oh time, in thy flight,\n\nMake me a citizen just for to-night;\n\nI have grown tired of trouble and toil,\n\nTired of tramping on Chivalry's soil;\n\nTired of having no brandy or rum.\n\nDo send me home, Doctor, do send me home.\n\nMany the faces that wish I was there,\n\nMany the creditors left in despair;\n\nMany the bantlings that pray he will come,\n\nDe send me home, Doctor, do send me home.\n\nBackward, roll backward, oh time, in thy flight,\n\nMake me a citizen just for a night;\n\nLet me a citizen gallant and gay be,\n\nSend me back home to my w ife and my baby;\n\nLe me go back to the Home Guards again,\n\nMusic of cannon oppresseth my brain;\n\nOnce I was brave and sound as a brick,\n\nWhistling of bullets have rendered me sick.\n\nBackward, roll backward, oh time, in thy flight,\n\nMake me a citizen just for a night.\n\nOnce I was brave and still I am zealous,\n\nOnce I had lungs like a blacksmith's bellows;\n\nBut tell the plain truth, accursed be the pegs,\n\nI put too much faith in my confounded legs;\n\nMy courage was good, but my legs had a tendency\n\nAlways to run, and they got the ascendancy;\n\nOh take me back where the bullets don't rustle\n\nThe hair of one's head, then feel of my muscle,\n\nTake me where bullets and bombs don't come,\n\nDo take me home, mother, do take me home.\n\nBackward, roll backward, oh time, in thy flight,\n\nMake me a citizen just for a night;\n\nHasten my pleasure, ye Gods, if ye can,\n\nMake me once more a family man;\n\nI will be brave—as brave as a lion,\n\nLet me Old Albany once get my eye on;\n\nI will cry \"onward\" and write editorial\n\nFrigid or warm, Auroral or Boreal,\n\nI will be bold to counsel and think,\n\nShed for my country my heart's rarest ink;\n\nStand at no work, however inglorious,\n\nFoolish, fanatical—ever laborious;\n\nIf, oh sweet Doctor, thou picture of beauty,\n\nThou wilt discharge me from war and its duty.\n\nBackward, roll backward, oh time, in thy flight,\n\nMake me a citizen just for a night;\n\nTake back the bounty, the golden advance\n\nThat were all the chains to my earlier glance;\n\nSend me away to the land of white collars;\n\nYou bought me too cheap for three hundred dollars;\n\nYou told me also a beautiful story\n\nOf honor and fame, soft bread and glory;\n\nBut send me back, Uncle Sam, do,\n\nI will leave honor and glory to you.\n\nLOCAL AFFAIRS.\n\nFROM THE FORTY-FOURTH REGIMENT.—We make the following extract from a letter written by a member of Company F, 44th (Ellsworth) Regiment:\n\nWe left our new camp on the 28th of May, and are now at Banks's Ford, a very handsome place.

A, 44th Regt., N. Y. Vols., written to his relatives in this city:\n\nON THE FIELD NEAR GETTYSBURG,\n\nJuly 5th, 1863—8 P. M.\n\nI have only time to write you a few lines, to assure you that I am safe and well. Since I last wrote you we have marched about 200 miles in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, and were engaged in the battles of the 2d and 3d here. Our regiment lost many—one company more than half its number. I had my pants torn by a bullet, which grazed my leg, but did no injury; and of a group of eleven near me nine were hit. The enemy left our front this A. M., and are probably in full retreat for the Potomac. Our advance is after them. They left most of their dead and wounded on the field; and any quantity of arms and equipments. Our company alone has brought in over fifty rebel muskets. They lay scattered around the field in every direction. This has been the most destructive fight I ever saw.\n\nOTSEGO COUNTY.\n\n— Elias B. Gardner, of West Burlington, a member of the Ellsworth Regiment, died last Tuesday week at Camp Butterfield, Va. He died of inflammation of the lungs, and was sick two weeks. He was highly esteemed as a good soldier and a loyal man. His body was sent to his friends. This, we believe, is the first death in the regiment.\n\n—The winter term of Unadilla Academy begins December 4th, 1861.\n\nFrom the Ellsworths.\n\nANTIETAM FORD, MD.,\n\nOctober 28th, 1862.\n\nFRIEND STEBBINS:—\n\nSince my last letter to you everything has been so still and quiet in our camp that I could find nothing that I thought would be of interest to you and so have neglected to write till now. However, as there all the indications of a movement of our corps to be made very soon, the sluggish blood begins to quicken in the veins, the old patriotic fire to brighten again and I feel in the mood to write even if I can find nothing of interest to record.\n\nSince the battle of Antietam we have been lying by, resting, if it can be called resting, where we have to go \"on picket\" three times a week and fill up the intervals with drilling. Still, we have but little reason to complain. Our picket duty is easy and the drill light; compared with that we performed at Hall's Hill last fall and winter. The result has been most ...\n\nWOUNDED OF CO. A, 44TH REGIMENT.—The following wounded of Co. A, 44th Regiment N. Y. V., are now in the hospital at Gettysburg:\n\nJoseph Harnagan, leg; Robt. Burns, thigh; Wm. M. Morris, knee; Henry C. Kenele, eye; Allen J. Herd, neck and breast; John Steel, thigh; S. Cheesman, foot; Thos Hunt, leg; Lewis F. Ferram, face; Justan Bennett, back; Julian Rowlton, knee; Jacob Wagner, arm; Wm, Cunningham, shoulder.\n\nTHE BATTLE-FLAG OF THE 44TH.—The torn and bullet-pierced flag of the 44th (Ellsworth). Regiment, which was presented to them before they left this city, yesterday morning adorned the front of Erastus Corning & Co.'s warehouse on Broadway, where it will remain for several days, to be seen by all who may be desirous of looking upon the emblem of many a battle, pierced with bullets and stained with blood.\n\nTHE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—Co. A, the Erie county company in the Ellsworth Regiment lost four killed and seventeen wounded in the last battle. Among the killed was Capt. Kraft, commanding the company. The Regiment lost 111 in all, more than one-third of the number went in with.\n\nGoshen.\n\nWe regret to learn that Webster Duryea, son of Alpheus Duryea of this town, member of the 44th N. Y. V. Volunteers, (Ellsworth Regiment,) was killed in the late battle near Gettysburg. He was wounded, and while his comrades were taking him off the field, a shell struck him and killed him instantly. This regiment, like the 124th, has seen hard service, and ranking among the bravest of the brave, its numbers are sadly reduced.—Goshen Democrat.\n\nFROM THE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—We are permitted to use for publication, a letter received by D. SHAPLEY, Esq., of New Hartford, from his son who represents that town most ably in New York's best regiment. Of late the regiment has been praised on all sides, and their course will be watched with great interest:\n\nKALORAMA HEIGHTS, Oct. 26, 1861.\n\nCAMP PEOPLE'S ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.\n\nDEAR FATHER—We arrived here last night after a tedious journey, since last Monday. I expected we should remain here for some days, but to-night at _ o'clock P. M., we have orders to pack up and march over to Virginia. The order was received with cheers. I am writing this with my accoutrements on, all ready to march, not knowing the place of destination. As near as I can find out, we shall stop at Arlington Heights to act as reserve. Col. Stryker has received a second dispatch, saying we shall not march until Monday. We shall then be reviewed by Gen. McClellan, and be attached to the brigade of Gen. Howard, our regiment to have the right. I am well, but feel about worn out, having lost much rest the last week. Two Corporals in my tent are sick with the measles. I should not be surprised if it went through the regiment. I am somewhat pleased with camp life and the romance connected with it. It seems more like the 4th of July here; it is bung bang all the time. There are some 4000 or 5000 men within a few miles, who practice each day. Everything is quiet at present. Do not know how soon we shall have a fight. I shall write a more interesting letter in a few days, or as soon as we get settled. From your son,\n\nD. SHAPLEY, JR.\n\nOn Furlough.—James E. Spry of this village and a member of the 44th Regt. N. Y. S. V., is home on a short furlough. We had the pleasure of a long talk with him on Monday. He represents the Army of the Potomac as in fine condition, and states that Hooker has the entire confidence of the army. Mr. S. is now a Clerk in the commissary Department in the army.—He says he is a Democrat still but not a Copperhead. This is his first visit home since his enlistment. Good for Jim.\n\nPERSONAL—Dr. J. D. Steward, assistant surgeon in the 44th, having mostly recovered from his wounds received at the battle of Gettysburgh [sic] returned to the army on Monday last.\n\n—EDWARD B. NORTHUP, the son of H. B. Northup of this village, and formerly of the 44th Regt., N. Y. S. V., has received a Lieutenants commission in the Invalid Corps.—Sandy Hill Herald.\n\nLIEUTENANT VANDERZEE.—Lieut. John G. VANDERZEE went to the field as Color Sergeant of the 44th Regiment. A few months since he was promoted to the post of Second Lieutenant of the 25th, which immortalized itself at Hanover Court House. In that battle, he had command of Company A—its Captain and First Lieutenant being sick. He did his duty so well, that the General of the Brigade has transferred him to the command of Company F, whose Captain was taken prisoner, and whose First and Second Lieutenants were disabled. In a letter just received from him, he says: \"I never felt better in my life than when it rained bullets around me at Hanover, and I am in perfect health now.\"\n\nAPPOINTMENT.—Lieut. CHAS. E. PEASE, of this city, formerly of the Forty-fourth New York regiment, has been appointed Assistant Adjutant General, with the rank of Captain, and assigned to duty on Gen. VAN ALLEN'S Staff.\n\n—The Tribune's Washington dispatch, dated Friday, says:\n\nThe 44th New York (Ellsworths) was a wonder to us this afternoon. Hackneyed as we are in marching regiments, nothing in the army can compare with it. It is the finest body of men ever enlisted on this continent. Its march through the Avenue made a great sensation.\n\nTHE 44TH.—In a letter to E. S. JOHNSON, Esq., of Schodack Landing, from his son, Lieut. J., of the 44th, we learn that that Regiment had the extreme advance in the crossing of the army to attack the Rebels.\n\nWOUNDED OF THE 44TH (ELLSWORTH) REGIMENT—Among the wounded soldiers who reached Washington, on Tuesday, from Fredericksburg, none of whom were very seriously hurt, were the following members of the 44th Regiment:\n\nAsaph Holdridge, Co. G; Sergeant W. Johnson, Co. G; James Bauen, Co. C; Andrew J. Taylor, Co. G; Henry C. Dennis, Co. E.\n\nTHE LOSSES AT HANOVER.—The following has been received in Buffalo: HANOVER, 28th May.\n\nTo W.

Ellis, Co. E, top of right ear shot off. The truth about the Forty-fourth is that they had about twenty killed and forty wounded, among them the Major. The Forty-fourth is in the brigade of Gen. Dan Butterfield.\n\nEdward B. Northup, the son of H. B. Northup of this village, and formerly of the 44th Regt., N. Y. S. V. has received a Lieutenants commission in the Invalid Corps.\n\nLoss IN CO.

The money—$20,000—was advanced to Major Richardson by Erastus Corning, in anticipation of its reception from Washington.\n\nMadison.—The citizens of this town met Monday evening at the Baptist Church, and organized an Ellsworth town association. Thirty-six volunteer subscriptions of $1 each were immediately made, and solicitors appointed to circulate subscriptions in the different parts of the town. An Executive Committee of five was appointed, and also a committee of three to select the volunteers. Speeches were made suitable to the occasion, by the Chairman, Dea. Brigham, Rev. Mr. Sharts and Rev. Mr. Swift.\n\nThe meeting adjourned to Friday evening this week, at this place, when we expect the association will number one hundred.\n\nJOHN W. LIPPETT, Ch'n.\n\nALLEN CURTIS, Sec'y.\n\nDated Madison, Aug. 6, 1861.\n\nNEW HARTFORD.—At a meeting held last Friday evening, a town organization to assist in raising the Ellsworth or People's Regiment was effected, and already the soldier to represent the town has been selected, and the money for his equipment raised. The man selected is DAVID SHAPLEY, Jr., of whom a correspondent writes viz: Mr. SHAPLEY is a young man who stands high in society, strictly moral and of true integrity. He is a graduate of Whitestown Seminary, and also of Bassett's Commercial College.\" He will soon make many friends in the regiment, I am confident.\"\n\n—The Ellsworth Regiment will receive one month's pay this week. They will leave for Washington, probably, early next week.\n\nPEOPLE'S ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—Charles C. La Grange, Guilderland, Albany county, and Albert Morgan, Dover Plains, Dutchess county, have been selected to represent said towns in this Regiment.\n\nHon. ERASTUS CORNING telegraphed last evening from Washington, that this regiment will be accepted by the Government.\n\nCHAS. HUGHES, Secretary.\n\nNEW YORK VOLUNTEERS.—Two skeleton regiments—the People's regiment and Col. Vinton's—were mustered into the United States service at the Albany barracks on Friday.\n\n—The Peoples' Ellsworth Regiment, to the number of about 900, were reviewed by Major General Morgan and Staff, Monday afternoon. Between six and eight thousand persons witnessed the review, and the reputation of the Regiment as one of the best, if not the best Volunteer Regiment in the State, was fully established.\n\nTHE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—The Albany Journal says the ranks are being rapidly filled up. Nearly 700 men are now enrolled. The committee have selected Maj. J. B. RICE, who served as Adjutant in the Garibaldi Guards, as Lieutenant Colonel. He is a gentleman of the highest character, tried bravery, and of conceded soldiery skill. He will be popular with the Regiment, as he is with all who have known him—as many of our citizens have—from boyhood up. Schreiber's Band is to be attached to the Regiment—one of the finest in the State.\n\n—The Ellsworth Regiment is rapidly filling up. They spend six hours out of the twenty-four in drilling under experienced and competent officers, and devote their leisure time to athletic sports. The Regiment bids fair to be an honor to the State.\n\nTHE ELLSWORTHS.—This regiment is now practically full. The full quota has not yet been mustered in; but there are men enough on the rolls to bring it up to 1040.\n\nLieut. Munday, of Seneca county, has been appointed Quartermaster. He is a young gentleman of fine character and thorough business qualifications.\n\nRev. Mr. Pease, a Presbyterian clergyman of eminent fitness, of Saratoga county, has been appointed Chaplain.\n\nThe fatigue uniform of the Regiment—of Zouave cut—will be ready next week. It will be very neat. In ten days they will be ready to march.—Albany Journal, 5th.\n\nTHE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—The Greene (Chenango county) American has a rumor that the Ellsworth People's Regiment is expected to be ordered to Missouri in about a week. There is no official announcement of the fact, but Chenango county has a considerable number of officers and men in the Regiment, and from some of them the information was probably obtained.\n\n—On Monday morning, Messrs. W. E. Lewis and Paul B. Clark, of Preston, and Geo. Webb and C. Rorepough, of Smithville, left for Albany to join the Ellsworth Regiment.\n\nTHE ELLSWORTH REGIMENT.—Mr. David SHAPLEY, JR., OF NEW Hartford, called on us yesterday, on his way to join his regiment at Albany.\n\nExtract of a Letter from the 44th Reg't.\n\nCAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, Va.\n\nApril 3d, 1862.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nEverything is quiet here. We had our inspection to-day by Lieut. Col. Webb, of Gen. Meade's Staff. The regiment was in splendid shape. The inspection was for the purpose of getting more furloughs granted, for both officers and men. I think it will be a success. It has been reported here that our corps (that is the 5th) is to go to Kentucky soon, but I think it is only a report. If we move I will let you know. Capt. Gibbs and all the officers are well.\n\nRespectfully, S. F. J., 44th Reg't., N. Y. V.\n\nWOUNDED OF Co. A, 44TH REGIMENT.—The following wounded of Co. A, 44th Regt., N. Y. Vols., are now in the hospital at Gettysburg:\n\nJoseph Harnegan, leg; Robert Barnes, thigh; Wm. M. Morris, knee; Henry C. Kencle, eye; Allen J. Herd, neck and breast; John Steel, thigh; S. Cheeseman, foot; Thomas Hunt, leg; Lewis F. Ferram, face; Justan Bennett, back; Julian Rowlton, knee; Jacob Wagner, arm; Wm. Cunningham, shoulder.\n\nARRIVAL OF OFFICERS OF THE 44TH.—Capt. Charles W. Gibbs, Lieut. Graves and six Sergeants, of the 44th Regiment, arrived in town on Saturday. They go hence to Elmira to take charge of the conscripts at that depot. Major Knox, formerly of this city, proceeded direct from Harrisburg for the same purpose.\n\nPersonal.—Capt. Chas. W. Gibbs, Lieut. Anthony Graves, Jr. and Sergeant Bomus, of the 44th (Ellsworth) Regiment, arrived in town Saturday. They are en route for Elmira, having been detailed for special duty, the reception and charge of conscripts. Major Knox will meet them at the rendezvous with six privates from the 44th.\n\nOur Albany friends are all well and hearty, having escaped injury during the recent severe battles in Pennsylvania. As might be expected they are all in excellent spirits, on account of the recent brilliant achivements [sic] of the glorious Army of the Potomac, with which they have been connected since its organization.\n\nHOME MATTERS.\n\nFrom the 44th Regiment—An Advance Movement Expected.\n\nCorrespondence of the Times & Courier.\n\nCamp Near Falmouth, Va., April 14.\n\nWe have orders to be ready to move to-morrow. The men are to carry five days rations and the officers eight. All the Cavalry went yesterday and we must soon follow. We are all ready to go. The roads are in good order and the weather is splendid. I think we have any amount of hard work and fighting to do this month.\n\nWe received notice last night that Lieut. Col. Connor had been honorably discharged from the service. You know he was wounded at Fredericksburgh [sic] and has been home since that time, it being over sixty days, and I suppose he was discharged on that account. The men are in good spirits and ready to move. If we have any fighting to do, you will hear a good account from the 44th. Respectfully yours, J.\n\nOTSEGO COUNTY.\n\nDEATH OF A SOLDIER.—At a meeting of the members of Company F, 44th (People's Ellsworth) Regiment, called in consequence of the death of their late esteemed comrade and fellow soldier, Charles Chappell, on motion, it was unanimously resolved that a series of resolutions be drawn as expressive of their sense at this bereavement, and to forward to his afflicted family a copy thereof.\n\nIn pursuance of the above, it is\n\nResolved, That in the death of our late brother soldier, Charles Chappell, we have lost a faithful comrade, the cause in which we are engaged an earnest supporter, and the service a young and promising soldier. Whatever may be our loss, or that of the army in the early decease of our comrade, it is our stern duty to bow to the mandate of an all-wise God, and in meek submission acknowleddge [sic] His right to rule among men, and feel that whatever He willeth is for our temporal and temporal good and welfare.\"\n\nResolved, That to the parents and family of our deceased comrade, we offer a soldier's heartfelt consolation and sympathy in this their hour of affliction. Though our own grief is keenly felt on this sad occasion, it must be as naught in comparison to that of an affectionate family. It is our fervent hope that the trial may be borne with resignation and fortitude, and we again ask them to accept our heartfelt sympathies in their bereavement.\n\nResolved. That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the family of the deceased.\n\nCamp Butterfield, Hall's Hill, Va., November 26, 1861.\n\nCommittee—John G. Vanderzee, Color-Sergeant, 44th Regiment; Robert H. McCormice, Sergeant, Company F, 44th Regiment; Samuel W. Chandler, Corporal, Company F, 44th Regiment; George W. B. Seely, Private, Company F, 44th Regiment.\n\nJOHN G. VANDERZEE, President.\n\nGEORGE W. B. SEELY, Secretary.\n\nTHE ELSWORTH REGIMENT.\n\nWHAT HAS BECOME OF IT.\n\nA sketch of the Ellsworth Regiment, the part it has performed in the war and what has become of it, will be interesting to our readers. We are indebted for the following statement to Col. RICE:—\n\nThe Forty-fourth Regiment New York State Volunteers, was originally composed of 1028 men, rank and file, selected from the different towns and villages throughout the State of New York, and it entered the service of the United States on the 8th day of August, 1861.\n\nThe average height of the rank and file of this regiment was five feet ten and a half inches, and more than four hundred of the same averaged six feet.\n\nThe average age of the rank and file was twenty-two years.\n\nOn or about the 1st of November, 1861, the regiment marched into Virginia. Forming a part of the 3d Brigade, under the command of Gen. Butterfield, it became very proficient in the manual of arms and battalion drill, through the efficiency of that thorough disciplinarian and accomplished officer.\n\nSince the 1st of November, 1861, this regiment has marched 713 miles, performed 103 days of picket and fatigue duty, and drilled 147 days on an average of five hours per day.\n\nThe regiment has been engaged in the following battles, viz: Seige [sic] of Yorktown, Hanover Court House, Gaines Mills, Turkey Bend, Malvern Hill, Groveton, Antietam and Fredericksburg.\n\nIn the battle of Hanover Court House the regiment lost, in killed and wounded, twenty-five per cent of its force engaged. In the battle of Gaines Mills the loss was twenty per cent, and in the battle of Malvern Hill the loss was forty-five per cent. At the latter battle the regiment charged, at a critical moment in the fortunes of the day, upon an entire brigade of the enemy, put it to flight and captured its stand of colors.\n\nThe total number, rank and file, of the original members of the regiment, killed and wounded, is 314; of deaths by disease, 67; discharged for disability, 207; detached from the regiment, 45; promoted to the rank of commissioned officers in this and other regiments, 32; discharged by order of the Secretary of War, including musicians, 50.\n\nOf the original rank and file there are:—Present for duty at this date (Feb. 1st, 1863,) 229; present sick in camp, 9; absent sick, 125.\n\nRecapitulation of the original members of the Regiment, rank and file.\n\nKilled 113\n\nWounded 201\n\nDied of disease 67\n\nDischarged for disability 207\n\nDetached from the regiment 45\n\nPromoted 32\n\nDischarged by order 50\n\nPresent for duty Feb. 1st, 1863 229\n\nPresent sick in camp 9\n\nAbsent sick 125\n\nTotal 1078\n\nLess wounded returned to duty 55\n\nTotal enlisted 1023\n\nThe regiment has recruited since its organization 181, of which eight have been killed and wounded, five have died of disease, five have been discharged for disability, two detached from the regiment, one promoted to\n\nthe rank of commissioned officer in this regiment, present for duty 116, present sick 22, absent sick 22.\n\nRecapitulation of Recruits Received.\n\nWounded 7\n\nDied of disease 5\n\nDischarged for disability 5\n\nDetached 8\n\nPromoted 1\n\nPresent for duty 116\n\nPresent sick 22\n\nAbsent sick 23\n\nTotal 181\n\nCompanies C and E are composed of the recruits above mentioned, and entered the service after the battle of Groveton.\n\nRecapitulation of the total strength of the Regiment at this date, Feb. 1st, 1863.\n\nTotal killed 114\n\n\" wounded 208\n\n\" died 72\n\n\" discharged for disability 212\n\n\" discharged by order of Sec'y of War 50\n\n\" detached 47\n\n\" promoted 33\n\n\" for duty 345\n\n\" present sick 31\n\n\" absent sick 147\n\nTotal 1259\n\nOriginal men enlisted 1023\n\nWounded returned to duty 55\n\nRecruits received 181\n\n1259\n\nNo accurate account of the number of the wounded that have died from their wounds, or been discharged on account thereof has as yet been received by the Adjutant of the Regiment, and, therefore, all such of the rank and file have been included under the head of discharged for disability, and those of the wounded who are absent and unfit for duty are included among the absent sick.\n\nThe following officers of the regiment have been wounded in battle, namely:—Lieutenant Colonel Conner, Major Chapin, Adjutant Knox, Captains Larrabee, Nash, Van Derlip, Shaffer, Becker, Gibbs, McRoberts and Woodworth, Lieutenants Fox, Hardenburg, Kelley, Graves and Gaskill. Five officers were on detached service, three had resigned, and two had died before the first engagement.\n\nIn several battles not all of the regiment was engaged, a large number of soldiers having been left as camp guard.\n\nHOME MATTERS.\n\nARMY CORRESPONDENCE.\n\nFrom the 44th Regiment.\n\nWe are permitted to make the following extracts from a letter received by CHARLES R. JOHNSON, from GEORGE H. SPRY, of the 44th Regiment. We wish we had space to print the entire letter, but as it is must content ourselves with the following:\n\nSTONEMAN'S SWITCH, NEAR FALMOUTH, Va.,\n\nMay 18, 1863.\n\nMost of the two years and nine months men have already left the army. Every train that has passed towards Acqua Creek for the last two weeks has been loaded with discharged Regiments. I assure you they are all jolly over their home prospect.\n\nGeorge Pabodie was here last week. He will be home next month. He has been a good soldier and will come home with a clean record. Yesterday I was over to the 5th Excelsior, and saw Lieutenant Terry, and David Hetzel. Capt. R. A. Stanton is Ordnance Officer on the Staff of Gen. Graham, Commander of the 3d Division, 3d Corps. Stanton is a good soldier, and I am glad he is appreciated.\n\nI presume you have read much of Hooker's late movements and are anxious to know how they are regarded in the army. My observation assures me that his plans and movements were admirable, and that but for certain events which no human being could foresee or avert, we should now be in Richmond. Every intelligent soldier in the Army of the Potomac admires\n\nGen. Hooker more than ever, for on the field he fully sustained his reputation as \"Fighting Joe,\" and manifested that military skill and resource which should be expected of so grand an army. The battles which were fought across the Rappahannock were terribly desperate, and the enemy must have lost nearly twenty thousand in killed and wounded. I assure you Charley, the troops came off that blood-stained field feeling that they had whipped the enemy, and believing that our retrograde movement was expedient, and necessary to the future success of our arms. What army in the world, in the same length of time, ever did more or any better fighting than this army has done?\n\nThe Army of the Potomac has saved the Northern Border States from invasion, saved our Capitol, and given the \"Home Guard,\" the pleasing assurance, that as yet the country is safe. The memorable battle-fields, almost within hearing distance of Washington, where bleach the bones of heroic soldiers should be sacred to the memory of the \"Army of the Potomac,\" an army unequalled for its valor and discipline in the whole world. What though this war lasts ten years, should we be any the less certain of final victory? The spirits of our Revolutionary fathers, and of the illustrious dead of the campaign answer No! I want to see a certain class of people in Chenango County, who have been at their ease the last two years, double quicking with a knapsack on and going into a fight where they can taste of battle. There have been times heretofore when I felt blue, but those times are past. The prospects of the Government are encouraging, and already our national horizon brightens with the sunshine of foreshadowed victory. Tell the people of Norwich that \"all is well\" with our army. As I learn more of military, and more fully realize the necessities of our cause, I see how necessary it is that every man should stand firm by the Government, and crush every symptom of treason in the army, or at home. Everything looks cheering to me, and I am in earnest when I tell you that the army is in good spirits and has the utmost confidence in Gen. Hooker.\n\nI send you a photograph of our flag, which has seen many hard fought battles. Its bullet holes and broken staff tell whether or not the 44th has done its duty. Yours ever,\n\nGEO. H. SPRY.\n\nFrom the 44th Regiment.\n\nCAMP OF THE 44TH REG. VA.\n\nMay 18th, 1863.\n\nMr. Editor. —I promised you a letter after the battle, if I did not get my head pushed off on the occasion, so I fulfill, and do so more willingly after reading the comments of the New York papers on this last great conflict. Never before have I seen such misrepresentations of any movement we have made. It seems to be a malicious attempt of reporters to vent their impotent rage upon Hooker, and Butterfield because they were kept from the usually cowardly enjoyment of seeing a terrific battle at a safe distance.\n\n\" You must keep this side of the river, Gentlemen, says Gen. Hooker to the sneaks. If you go over you must shoulder muskets, I'll have nothing but fighting man over there.\" This was a different business to any they had been accustomed to, yet they must send some report to the N. Y. papers, if they fabricated one, hence the infamous stories now afloat. Not wishing to take for soldiers more credit than truth will allow I wish the people of Oxford to have a correct version from one who was in all, and through all, from the 1st to the 6th of May, the first Division on the ground was ours. The simple gaining of the position unopposed by the enemy, which we held to the last at Chancellorville, the other side of the Rapidan, was a movement exhibiting more Generalship than has ever been displayed by any previous Generals of this army. It perfectly astounded the rebels, we dropped down in their midst so suddenly, it left doubtful the diection [sic] we came from. The river where we crossed was so desirably fitted by nature for a strong defence, it was estimated by the best judges, that had 5000 rebels opposed our crossing with thirty pieces of artillery, it would have been impossible for us to get over.\n\nThe old \"44th\" were on the lead that day, a mile ahead of the corps. We came to the river bank, on the other stood 20 rebel pickets, apparently lost in amazement our sudden appearance. Gen. Griffin came to the river, took one look at the frowning hill on the other side, turning around in his saddle said, \"Forty-fourth, we must gain those hills with one Division, within an hour, or this river will run with blood. Every minute is worth the lives of 500 men. Will you lead?\" \"We will! we will!\" shouted 300 strong voices. Taking off our cartridge boxes and rations, holding them high above our head in the left hand, our gun in our right, we plunged in. It was cold, and muddy, and rising fast from the rain of the day before, and wider than the Chenango at Oxford. We reached the opposite side safely, with our powder dry, taking a good position, stayed there that night. The next morning moved forward three miles and found we were in the vicinity of the entire Rebel army. Now came the manoevering, but three corps of ours, were then on the ground, that night the 2d and 3d Corps joined us, via of U. S. Ford. Friday in the forenoon our corps began to feel of the enemy, he seemed rather shy. In the afternoon, we had one short but severe collision. The 2d Division of our corps, (Gen. Sykes) suffered the most, the enemy had a good charge at him, with us, it was the other way, we lost few, and killed very many. Saturday we were assigned our position on the left centre, having time made a breast-work behind which we expected to stand, and if the rebels came give them a warm reception, about 4 P. M., were astonished by a discharge of musketry on our right, the like of which I never heard. Those heavy discharges from long lines at Antietam, and Malvern Hills, seemed but picket firing beside this. Cannon opened immediately, and with the musketry fairly shook the earth where we stood. In a few moments news came that the 11th corps had broke, and back they came upon us in the utmost confusion.—Our boys felt this state of things keenly, knowing too well what an advantage it gave the enemy. Conch's corps immediately filled the breach, being nearest we went on Conch's right, leaving our place since there was no probability of any fighting in the old quarter, collecting what they could of the scattered 11th it was nearly dark, but the real fighting of May 2d now began. Jackson's whole force, the flower of the rebel army were moving up, flushed with momentary success.—Hooker, rode down the lines, receive the enemy upon your bayonets, fire not a shot they cannot see you. We got down, in a moment they burst fro the woods, line after line, came steadily forward toward Berry's Division first to our left.—They thought there was nothing in the way, and an easy victory before them, but instantly a long dark line extending across the fields arose, presenting a glistening, they halted as quick as though shot in their track. In vain did their commanders urge them forward, they could not drive them on to the bayonets, they wavered for a moment, then the first line broke, at this we opened with musketry throughout the whole line, at the same time some 30 brass Napoleon guns 20 lbs. opened with canister, at the discharge of these pieces, so close were the enemy, that legs, arms, and huge pieces of bodies filled the air. They would totally demolish a line of battle at two or three discharges. They fell back in the wood and formed again, and then came forward as before, only again to be demolished. How many times this was done I cannot say, but as fast as the men could be got into line till midnight. The long sheets of fire from the infantry, the terrible flashes of the cannon, the bursting of shells, all together, made fireworks awfully grand, and cast Fourth of July operations into shade. When at last Jackson learned what he had to deal with, that it was impossible to break our lines he withdrew for the night. We laid down on our arms. As day broke Sunday morning the enemy came on. Deserters during the night, told us that Jackson had promised \"to break our centre if it cost his life, and the lives of his entire army,\" and when line after line came out of the woods early in the morning, advancing across the fields steadily to the attack, it would seem to an observer, unused to such scenes, that no human power could withstand the onset. We were ready, and however determined Jackson might be, there was determination equally firm in our unwavering line, which stood with bayonets fixed for the foe. The scene which now ensued was similar to that of the night before, only the slaughter of the enemy was greater, if that was possible, although they hurled their entire force against two divisions for six hours, they never moved an inch, not a solitary inch from where we had set our line after the retreat of the 11th corps. At length they encumbered the ground, they could not move their lines over it. We lost heavily in two Divisions, of course we must in such fighting, but by the side of the enemies dead in front, piled up till nearly as high as the fences our loss was but a cypher. As they went down almost by battalions, I could hardly refrain from swinging my hat and crying out. \"So much for Dec. 13th when they set us down so before Fredericksburg.\" The enemy left us, and went back on Sedgwick with their whole force and drove him from the height.—What then should keep us there? It would not do to drive Lee this side of the river, between us and Washington, there was nothing but to retire, as for being driven back by Lee's army, you may set this down that the whole population of the South, men, women, children, niggers and all, could not have driven us from that position.\n\nThe 17th N. Y. started for home to-day, you remember Capt. Tyrrell enlisting men in Oxford for that regiment, their time is out, we have been to see them off, for they belonged to our brigade. In kind regards,\n\nYours, J. E. B.\n\nBIVOUAC OF 44TH REG'T N. Y. VOLS.,\n\nKELLY'S FORD, RAPPAHANNOCK RIVER,\n\nJune 6, 1863.\n\nTo the Editor of the Springville Herald:\n\nI herewith send you a photograph of the old flag of the FORTY-FOURTH REGIMENT, which has obtained some celebrity through the newspapers. The people of Springville have a heritage in this flag, for Springville valor has sustained it amid all the trying scenes through which it has passed, and its glory has been purchased with the blood of her noblest and truest sons. The names of MYERS, WALKER and HAMMOND should be cherished in lasting rembmbrance [sic] as long as valor and country are cherished among men. These young men yielded up their lives to vindicate the honor of this flag, and maintain the integrity of the Union; and their names should not be allowed to sink into oblivion. Deeds of valor and heroism should be regarded among the choicest treasures of a free people, and every town should see to it that the sacrifices and achievements of her Sons are not forgotten, but treasured up in grateful hearts, and transmitted as a priceless legacy to future generations.\n\nMr. Editor, will you put this photograph in a frame and hang it up in your office, and let it commemorate the heroic deeds of JEROME MYERS, who fought at Yorktown, Hanover and Gaines Hill, and who fell with his face to the foe on the bloody field of Malvern; and let it speak also of the indomitable courage and heroic endurance of EUGENE WALKER and HENRY Hammond, who followed its fortune all through the Peninsula campaign, and at last fell, amid gloom and defeat, on the sanguinary plains of Manassas. And if there be any among you who are praying and striving for an inglorious peace let this tattered banner appeal to what honor and manhood there is left in them, and say whether the blood of our martyred heroes shall have been shed in vain.\n\nLet it be known that every man from the town of Concord in the Ellsworth Regiment, without an exception, has followed the fortunes of this ... without a murmur of discontent, and they are entitled to no insignificant share of its glory. There are but two of them left with us now, SPAULDING and STEARNS, tried veterans, than whom none braver or truer ever carried a musket.\n\nThe health of the army, so far as I am able to learn, is excellent, and their spirits undaunted, not over anxious, but always ready for a fight.\n\nYours for the war,\n\nE. L. HARRIS,\n\n44th N. Y. V.\n\nThe Dunkirk Union.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 5, 1863.\n\nFrom the 44th Regiment.\n\nWe are permitted to make the following extracts from a late letter written by a member of Co. A, 44th Regiment, who was in the battle of Gettysburg.\n\nMIDDLETOWN, MD.,\n\nJuly, 8th, 1863.\n\nMY FRIENDS AT HOME:\n\nWe came into this town this morning, having had a very hard march in the mud and rain. Most of the army is encamped near here. We are within eight miles of the old Antietam battle ground. It is now 3 P. M. Whether we shall move before morning, I cannot tell. We have just received news of the fall of Vicksburg. This morning we received another mail, I got for my share six letters and about as many papers. I assure you, I was glad to hear form home. I have read each letter over a half dozen times. The latest was June 30th. This is the second mail we have had since we left the Rapahannock [sic]. I wrote you immediately after the battle of Gettysburg. This campaign has been a hard one so far, but I stand it first rate. The day before the battle, we marched from 8 o'clock in the morning until 12 at night, moved again at 3 in the morning, (July 2d,) marched four miles to the battle field, maneuvered around until 4 P. M., when the rebels advanced, and from that time until dark we had hot work. Our corps was on the left of the centre, where the rebel Longstreet tried to break through and turn our lines. Our brigade lay on the side hill. It was covered with large stones. We threw up a small breastwork to protect us. I was where I could see nearly one-half of the field. At our right there were several battle fields. I could see the two armies advance. The lines would sway to and fro. The second and third corps were in these fields. The rebels drove our men across these fields twice; our men would fall back, reform, and then advance again. The second time our boys advanced, they held the field.—Firing ceased about 8 P. M. and then we went to work, caring for our wounded.—Our regiment lost very heavy; 111 out of 300. Our company lost more than any other company in the regiment, 22 out of 40, had 5 killed. Each company cared for their wounded. Knowlton, from Forestville, was badly wounded in the knee. I helped carry him off from the field. The last I heard from him, he was doing well. Both of my tent mates were wounded.—After we had carried our wounded of from the field, we then buried our dead. Three boys from our company together with myself, carr"
