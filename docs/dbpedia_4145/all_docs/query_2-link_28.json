        "text": "J\n\nJulian and Jo Ann Grubb posted a condolence\n\nWe have so highly privileged to know Ed as a beloved brother in Christ, a most outstanding Christian gentleman, and the father of our wonderful daughter-in-law, Judy. Both he and Mary have welcomed us into their home many, many times and truly made us feel like part of their family! We are confident that upon his graduation from this life, he has received a great promotion to a much better life in a much better and more wonderful world with its riches and glory! Even though we are unable to be with you during this difficult time, be assured that each of you are constantly in our thoughts and prayers, and take comfort from the words of Jesus in Matthew 28:20--\"I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.\"\n\nS\n\nSusie Wiltrout posted a condolence\n\nDear Mary, Marion, Judy and family - my sympathies to you and yours. I heard about Ed's illness a few months ago, but my mom is battling cancer too. She is doing OK but recently hospitalized last week. I will miss my peanut brittle buddy, last year was 30 years that is hard to believe. Love and prayers to you."
