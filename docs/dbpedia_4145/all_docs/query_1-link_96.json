During his youth he exhibited considerable talent in sketching, to such and extent that his parents allowed him to cultivate it, together with the art of painting, in one of the finest schools of art in Philadelphia, the result of which far exceeded their expectations, he having since produced some very excellent paintings, some of which may be seen at his son’s residence, at that of T. R. E. Harvey, Robert Brown, A. T. Irvine and various others in the county. His family consisted of five children, four of whom are now living, the subject of our sketch being the second child. After the death of his father, which occurred in 1854, in the forty-third years of his age, Peyton lived part of the time in Missouri and part of the time in Virginia. With the exception of two years, in which he engaged in merchandising, he followed the occupation of a farmer. In 1858, September 21, he was married to Miss Sallie M.

In 1872 after the re-enfranchisement of the southern men in Missouri, Capt. Ruxton ran for the office of collector, as an independent democrat, but was defeated by H. H. Harris, the regularly nominated candidate of the democratic party. In 1876 he was a candidate against the regularly nominated democratic candidate, running against Col. W. S. Jackson, for the office of county clerk, and was again defeated. Before and since the war, Capt. Ruxton has traveled largely in Canada and in all the states of the Union. Since 1855, he has been engaged in the general shipping business, except during the war. In 1857 a fire cost him about $9,000, and then the war almost impoverished him, losing him about $15,000. But by his indomitable pluck and energy, he has once more worked out for himself, a fair competency. Capt. Ruxton, a gentleman of the old school, and a man of hard Scotch sense, and notwithstanding his repeated political defeats, is one of the most popular men in the county. Page 812\n\nColumbus G.

He has on hand a number of high-grade cattle and Berkshire hogs. He is the owner of the noted trotting stallion, Boone Chief, one of the best bred harness horses in the state. In 1876 this horse took the premium in the 3-year old harness ring, at the St. Louis fair, and again in the 4-year old ring, in 1877, competing with twenty-four others. He is of the Membrino and Edwin Forrest families. Mr. H. is also proprietor of Lucille, Glencoe Belle, and Alice Hutchinson, of the Membrino family, and of quite a number of high grade horses.

When but two years old, his father moved to Saline county, where he was raised on a farm, and received a good English education. He entered William Jewell College; but had only been there one year when the war broke out, and he volunteered, August, 1861, in the southern army, and continued in the service until the close, in 1865. First volunteered in the Missouri state guards. When discharged at the end of his six months, he enlisted in the Confederate army, Capt. Ruxton’s company, and was captured with Robinson’s regiment of recruits at Blackwater, December 19, 1861, and imprisoned in the old McDowell College, St. Louis. In the next month, January, 1862, he escaped from the prison, passing the sentry in the disguise of a negro, and spent the night in one of the hotels. Early the next morning he started out on foot, but soon encountered the picket. As soon as he came to the sentry, he stopped, and remarked to his servant (who was with him) “George, we can’t get any ice out of the river here, and we might as well go back!” They therefore turned back toward the city, but in a short time met a lost of cows going out to the common to graze, so they fell in with them and thus passed the picket. They walked all day up the river, but were recaptured that same evening. From some cause, the officer who had captured them, called Giles a “liar.” He replied, “you are neither a gentleman for a brave man, you have two revolvers, and I propose that we make this personal, and settle it with them.” The officer took the proposition in good part, and bringing out a supply of old Bourbon, proposed that, instead of fighting, they should drink and be friends. McDaniel agreed. With the idea of escape in his mind, he then encouraged the drinking, but only pretending to drink himself. By daylight, the whole of his guard, officer and men, were too drunk to take any notice of him. So he bade them adieu; and that is the last he ever saw of them. After going a short distance, he met an Irishman that had seen him the night before. The Irishman accused him of being the man, he denied it, until the lie passed, and the Irishman started for McDaniel. Mac. had no arms, but put his hand in his pocket, as if he had, and ordered him to halt, or he would shoot him. The Irishman was bluffed, and a recapture avoided. He now moved on, but found it impossible to get rid of the Irishman, who now pretended to be his friend. The Irishman finally agreed to ferry him across the river. After they got in the skiff and out a little way from the shore, McDaniel again put his hand in his pocket, and notified the Irishman that unless he landed him safely and quietly on the Illinois shore, he would be shot through the head. The Celt rowed for dear life, made a safe landing in Illinois and received his pay and returned. The rest was easy, and except that the weather and roads were bad, he had little trouble in reaching home. But the Federal soldiers soon heard of his return, and endeavored to capture him. He dodged them, and went to Louisville, Kentucky, then around to Richmond, Virginia, crossing the Chesapeake bay in a canoe, where it was twenty miles wide. From Richmond he was passed on to Little Rock, Arkansas, and reported to Gen. Price. Mr. McDaniel was married February 12, 1867, to Miss Laura V. Garnett, and to them have been born five children, all living: Mattie D., Minnie L, Ethel F., Chapman A., and Bessie R. He is a member of the Baptist Church and A. O. U. W. Page 822-823\n\nWilliam Surbaugh, deceased. One of the early settlers of Saline county; was born in Greenbriar county, Virginia, November 12, 1804, and was raised and educated, and married there to Miss Hannah Hisey. They had twelve children, six of them now dead, and six living, viz: Ann E., Charles W., Henry C., Joseph T., John L, and Mitchell B. In 1839 he moved to Missouri, and settled on a farm near Miami, in Saline county. From this place there is a fine view of the surrounding country, and of the stirring little city of Miami, and here Mr. Surbaugh lived until his death, which occurred September 27, 1878. He was mourned by a large circle of relatives and friends. His estimable lady still survives him, and, in fair health, is living at the old homestead with her son, John L. Surbaugh, the next to the youngest son, who is still unmarried, and carries on the home farm. Both the old folks have been connected with the Baptist Church for over thirty years. Notwithstanding that the war lost Mr. Surbaugh fully $15,000, he left a fine estate. Page 823-824\n\nDaniel T. Guthrey, deceased. One of the early settlers of Saline county, was born in Buckingham county, Virginia, July 17, 1817, where he was raised in the country, on a farm, and received a good English education. In 1837 he came to Saline county, Missouri, and was employed by Col. John Brown, as overseer, which position he occupied for a number of years, and then commenced farming for himself. He was married August 5, 1840, to Miss Harriet M. Brown, daughter of Col. John Brown. They have nine children living, (and two, Addie, and James E., dead), viz John W., Mrs. Annie M. Jeter, Charles P., Arthur M., Ida R., Nova H., Emma B., Lucy L., and Travis S. Mrs. Guthrey died November 12, 1876, and February 23, 1880, he was laid by her side, awaiting the resurrection of the just. Arthur M. Guthrey, son of Daniel T. Guthrey, was born in Texas, while his parents were there on a trip for their health, March 10, 1853. He was raised on his father’s farm in this county, where he was principally educated, spending one year at Kirksville, Missouri. He has charge of his father’s affairs, settling up the estate, and, with his two brothers and three sisters, is managing the farm of 480 acres, keeping the family together. He is feeding sixty-seven head of fat cattle, and about eighty-seven head of stock cattle. He is a member of the Methodist Church, South, and is yet unmarried. He is a managing and enterprising young man, and is sure to succeed. Page 824\n\nWilliam H. Pate, Sr. P. O. Miami. Was born in Williamson county, Tennessee, September 26, 1816, his father being a cotton planter there; and when William was but nine or ten years old his father moved to Lauderdale county, Alabama, where he entered more largely into the growing of cotton. He (William) received a good English education. In 1836 he volunteered as a private in the Florida war, and was detailed to the very hazardous employment of carrying the mail. In 1837 he began the trade of blacksmith and gunsmith, which he followed until 1842. He then moved to Carroll county, Missouri, and located on a farm four miles west of De Witt, and remained there until 1865, when he moved to a farm in this county, and has since been engaged in farming and stock-feeding. On the 21st of October, 1841, he was married to Miss Belinda Watson, of Alabama; and to them have been born seven children, three—Thomas J., William Henry, and Andrew J.,--now living, and four, two daughters and two sons, dead. Mrs. Pate died in 1857; and March 20, 1861, he was married the second time, to Mrs. Mary D. Stephenson, widow of Edward Stephenson, by whom she had one son, William D. Stephenson. Her maiden name was Moberly, Mr. Pate was a constitutional man in the great excitement of 1860. He believed slavery to wrong per se, but yet did not believe it right to take the slaves from their masters without paying for them, after the law had made them property. He was too old for the army when the war broke out, and he endeavored to hold a neutral position; this, however, only made him the common target for both factions, and he was persecuted accordingly. His losses were large. He had a fine farm of 320 acres, well improved, but it was stripped down to the bare land; and he had to dispose of his land to get bread. Through energy, perseverance and management, he has, in a great measure, recuperated; has given his sons 268 acres of land, and has now a well-improved place of 120 acres. Mr. Pate keeps well up with the times, and has been a reader of the St. Louis Republican for thirty-eight years. Page 824-825\n\nCaptain William S. Bates, farmer and joiner, P. O., Miami. Son of William S. and Huldah B. Bates, (nee Parrish), was born in Goochland county, Virginia, September 16, 1817, and at the age of seven years came with his father and family to Marion county, Missouri. Soon after their arrival in Marion county, the new county of Lewis was organized, and without any further move they found themselves located in Lewis county, where Capt. William was raised on a farm. The Indians (Sacs) were still numerous there at that day, and the Indian children were his daily companions. His education was obtained in the pioneer style, and he learned to speak the Indian language. At the age of eighteen he learned the trade of house joiner, and worked at it until 1848, combined with cabinet making, and had a farm southwest of LaGrange. In 1856 he moved to this county, and located on the farm where he has lived to the present time, engaged in farming. In April, 1845, he was married to Miss Mary E. Gash, daughter of Martin and Mary Gash, of Marion county, Missouri. She died July 26, 1872, leaving five children: Mrs. Mary R. Ish, William M., Henry M., Edward J., and Elizabeth H., all living, and two dead. In July, 1846, he fell from a scaffold and broke his left ankle, and as a consequence has never since been able to do much walking—cannot walk five consecutive miles. His father was well-to-do until he was broken up by having to pay a number of security debts. From his grandfather he received $862, and at his marriage his wife received $1,500, and by economy and industry he had accumulated a competency when the war broke out, which caused him heavy losses. His energy and push have again sustained him, however, and he has now a splendid farm of 235 acres (and fifty acres of timber), admirably improved. At the beginning of the war he was worth about $25,000. His great-grandfather, James Bates, came from New England to Virginia, and there married Mrs. Duncombe, and to them were born five sons. His grandfather, also James Bates, married Mahethalum Sergeant, to whom were born four sons and three daughters. His grand-mother’s name (mother’s side) was Massey, and he is descendant from two of the best families of Virginia. During the war he opposed secession, but was in sympathy with the south. Page 825-826\n\nJohn G. Guthrey, capitalist, P. O., Miami. Was born in Cumberland county, Virginia, May 2, 1810, and is of German descent. He was mostly reared on a farm in Cumberland county, being educated in the country schools of the period, one of his teachers having formerly been private secretary of Gen. Andrew Jackson. At the age of nineteen he entered a country store as clerk, in Stony Point mills, serving an apprenticeship of five years. He then came to Missouri, and was in the west about five years, and visited Saline county in 1835 and ’36 during a western trip. He then settled down to merchandising in Petersburg, Virginia, where he dealt largely in tobacco and making money largely. During the visit to New York in 1861, after the battle of Bull Run, he was seized as a southern sympathizer and thrown into Fort Lafayette, and all his personal property, to the amount of $140,000 in bonds and currency taken from him. After six months in prison he was released for want of evidence, and immediately brought suit for his property, which he recovered. He then established a tobacco factory in Brooklyn, New York, which he carried on to the end of the war, and out of which he cleared about $100,000. He then entered a banker’s and brokers’ establishment on Wall street, New York, under the firm name of Harvey & Guthrey, which he aided in conducting until 1867, when he sold out to his partner. Having already invested about $100,000 in real estate in Saline county, in 1868, he removed with his family to Miami, where he has since resided, and which he has greatly aided in building up and improving. While doing business in Brooklyn he married Miss E. S. Hawkins, daughter of Joseph Hawkins, of Yonkers, New York, by whom he has a family of seven children. He is and has long been a member of the Episcopal Church, as are nearly all his family. Mr. Guthrey is of Scotch-Irish descent, and his ancestors came to America from the north of Ireland. He is president of the Miami Saving’s Bank, and is also a farmer. Two of his brothers, James and Daniel, are also residents of Saline county, and have been for many years."
