She married Larry McClung on February 10, 1963 and he preceded her in death on August 11, 2018.\n\nCarlita had worked at Washington Avenue Collections, the Dunn Memorial Hospital Auxiliary, and was a lecturer for Weight Watchers in several counties. She was a member of the Bedford High School class of 1963. She loved shopping (sorry Amazon), her cat, and working with her flowers. After the passing of Larry, her neighbors became especially important to her as they stepped in and provided the care and friendship she needed.\n\nSurviving Carlita is one brother, Tom (Lana) Smith; two nieces, Amanda (Brad) Totten and Holly (Ryan) Mills; two great nephews, Garrett and Ezra; one aunt, Betty (Richard) West; brother-in-law, Brian McClung and his daughter, Shelby McClung; one cousin, Julia (Mike) Johnson; and three special neighbors who thought of her as a grandmother, Amanda McCullough, Braden Terry and Chase Terry. Carlita was preceded in death by her parents; her husband, Larry; and one son, Aaron Scott McClung.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 2:00pm on Monday, December 4, 2023 at the Ferguson-Lee Chapel of Thorne-George Family Funeral Homes in Bedford with Bud Smith officiating. Burial will follow in Green Hill Cemetery. Visitation will be from 11:00am-2:00pm Monday, also at Ferguson-Lee Chapel.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to the White River Humane Society in Carlita’s name.\n\nMemories and condolences may be shared online at www.FergusonLee.com.\n\nNovember 29, 2023\n\nCharles Allen Finney\n\nJuly 24, 1949 – November 28, 2023\n\nCharles Allen Finney, 74, of Oolitic, passed away on Tuesday, November 28, 2023, at IU Health University Hospital in Indianapolis. Born on July 24, 1949, he was the son of Charles H. and Maxine (Jones) Finney.

He was a member of the First Christian Church and the Bedford Masonic Lodge #14. He retired in 2009 after 32 years from General Motors.\n\nCharles worked hard for his family his entire life and instilled values in his two sons to strive for the best.
