The Oxygen Network officially launched in February 2000.\n\nIn the very early days, the programming lineup was filled with some original shows, popular 80s reruns, and an interactive service that featured a stripe at the bottom of the screen. It was used to pass along additional information to viewers. The main focus audience was women. It was one of the first networks to target entertainment to females.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, it was announced that NBCUniversal would be buying the network for approximately $825 million. The following year, the channel was rebranded. By 2014, division heads decided to shift programming toward a modern young female audience. Its logo became “Very Real.”\n\nThree years later, Oxygen was reformatted again and concentrated mainly on true crime programs. This genre had become quite popular. In fact, the logo featured well-recognized yellow crime tape. In many ways, the network filled the void for the defunct CourtTV.\n\nToday, Oxygen has a full library of crime shows. It caters to millennial multicultural women. Like its other sister channels, many of the shows are unscripted. If you love action, you should check out Bravo, USA, Sci-Fi, and E! Each of these has a similar vibe to Oxygen.\n\nProgramming\n\nTo repeat, Oxygen is full-speed crime. Over the years, it has created quite a following for its current original programming. When you are in the mood for a mystery, murder, or exposed secret, it’s time to watch Oxygen. If you give it a try, it’s almost impossible not to become addicted to some of the most popular Oxygen shows.\n\nSnapped: Love can be a beautiful thing. On the other hand, it can turn deadly when revenge is involved. Snapped is the longest-running original series on Oxygen. It follows some of the most bizarre cases of women who are accused of murdering their lovers. In fact, this program is extremely popular and always brings in big ratings. It was a major reason why NBCUniversal branded Oxygen as a crime network.\n\nBuried in the Backyard: The title of the show perfectly describes the main plot. Each week, you watch true crime stories of victims who were found buried in some of the most unsuspicious sites. What will be uncovered next?\n\nFamous Cases Explained: Over the decades, the world has been filled with famous murders. This series gives unprecedented access and delivers in-depth explanations of cases like The Hollywood Ripper, The Zodiac Killer, and the death of Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nThe Real Murders of Atlanta: Atlanta may be a beautiful place to visit, but the area is not empty of excitement. This program spotlights some of the city’s deadliest murder cases. Each one-hour episode features homicide crimes as told by the witnesses, detectives, and reporters who were involved.\n\nChicago PD: From the Emmy-award winning producer Dick Wolf, Chicago PD is a sister production to Chicago Fire and Chicago Med. If you missed it the first time around, you can catch reruns on Oxygen. Enjoy one of the best police action dramas ever made.\n\nDateline: Secrets Uncovered: One of NBC’s most popular real-life broadcasts for over 25 years.
