I generally love their shows, from Seinfeld to Superstore. That âding-ding-dingâ is a sound I like. However, this app is disappointing. Why? Because I cannot pay to use it or to not be bothered by commercials. I am a millennial, I have come to love that for 3-5$ dollars more a month I donât have to watch commercials. Plus a subscription cost, perhaps you can fund some shows that have been cancelled that have a strong following, like giving us some form of closure on Dracula or Emerald City. By subscribing, to the NBC app, you can offer the news or sports as an added bonus. Alas, I can watch NBC news without any subscription. Which is great on your part NBC but as an app business model itâs not ideal. People like watching Nightly News. Additionally, if you want to stream original programming, just allowing people to subscribe at a cost can help fund aforementioned original programs. I had to login, with my motherâs Cable account in order to use the app. Which is annoying, and should be unnecessary as regular TV is dying in most city areas. I wouldâve paid 5-7$ a month just to watch NBC (WITH commercials ð) and I wouldâve paid because itâs the only place to find some programs I love. Câmon NBC, itâs 2021. You should focus on your streaming platform, I thoroughly enjoy Peacock, why arenât all of your shows on peacock!? I have to use two NBC applications ..."
