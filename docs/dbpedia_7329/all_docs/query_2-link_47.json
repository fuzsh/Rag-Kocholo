        "text": "MEDIA ALERT\n\nNBCUniversal has renewed \"Resident Alien\" for season four and will be moving the series to USA Network from SYFY.\n\nSeason three averaged 3.3 million total viewers (+4% vs. S2) and 1 million in the 18-49 demo (+36% vs. S2) across all platforms through 35 days.\n\nBased on the Dark Horse comics, \"Resident Alien\" follows a crash-landed alien named Harry whose secret mission is to kill all humans. In season three, Harry vowed to work with General McCallister to rid the Earth of the Grey aliens, a task made more difficult when he discovered that the Grey Hybrid Joseph had taken a job in town as the new Deputy. In addition, Harry struggled to balance business and his personal life when he fell in love for the first time.\n\nThe series stars Alan Tudyk, Sara Tomko, Corey Reynolds, Alice Wetterlund, Levi Fiehler, Elizabeth Bowen and Judah Prehn.\n\n\"Resident Alien\" was adapted to television by executive producer Chris Sheridan, who has served as showrunner since the launch of the series and remains at the helm for the upcoming fourth season. Mike Richardson and Keith Goldberg of Dark Horse Entertainment, Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank of Amblin TV, Robert Duncan McNeill and Nastaran Dibai also executive produce.\n\nThe series is produced UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group, in association with Amblin TV and Dark Horse Entertainment.\n\nABOUT USA NETWORK\n\nUSA Network has been a top five cable entertainment brand for over 25 years and is home to the most compelling television properties in the industry. Serving a broad, passionate fanbase, USA's diverse slate includes popular award-winning dramas, unfiltered family comedies, buzzy unscripted, weekly live WWE programming, high-octane sporting events and a portfolio of sought-after acquired series and movies. USA Network is part of NBCUniversal's Entertainment portfolio, which includes NBC, Bravo, E!, Oxygen True Crime, SYFY, Universal Kids, USA Network and Peacock.

Executive producers Jason Richman and Michael Seitzman co-wrote the pilot.\n\nUSA recently launched the second season of the intense athletic competition series \"Race to Survive: New Zealand, and this summer the network premieres \"The Anonymous,\" the highly anticipated series from the producers of \"The Traitors,\" Studio Lambert. Starting in September and through the end of 2024, USA will serve as the exclusive linear home of the WWE's two tentpole franchises \"WWE Monday Night RAW\" and \"WWE SmackDown,\" which returns to the network on Sept. 13 as part of a new multi-year partnership."
