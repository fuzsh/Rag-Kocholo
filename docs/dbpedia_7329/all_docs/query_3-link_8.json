These capitalized words and phrases are defined terms and the definitions for such terms are found either in these Terms of Service, the “Frequently Asked Questions” section of NBCUniversal Checkout (“FAQ” or “FAQs”) or in our Privacy Policy (the FAQs, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy may also be referred to together as the \"Agreements\").\n\nSome areas of NBCUniversal Checkout may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which you should read carefully before making any use of those areas. Such additional terms will not change or replace these Terms of Service regarding use of NBCUniversal Checkout, unless otherwise expressly stated.\n\nOccasionally we may make changes to NBCUniversal Checkout and Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll notify you through updates posted on NBCUniversal Checkout.

You are also solely responsible for all activities associated with your Account, including without limitation any purchases through your Account. You agree to immediately notify NBCUniversal of any unauthorized use of your password or Account or any other breach of security.\n\nUse of Third-Party Payment Processor. NBCUniversal uses a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to process your payments in connection with your orders from NBCUniversal Checkout. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms of Service. NBCUniversal is not responsible for errors made by the Payment Processor. By choosing to purchase products via NBCUniversal Checkout, you agree to pay NBCUniversal, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any purchase of products in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize NBCUniversal, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”).\n\nYour Payment Method. You agree you have the legal right to use the Payment Method you provide and you agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. NBCUniversal reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. The financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method must be located within the United States. If NBCUniversal, through the Payment Processor, does not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand. Completion of a payment transaction is contingent upon: (a) your providing complete personal, account, transaction and any other information needed, (b) authorization of the payment by your credit or debit card company, and (c) acceptance of your payment.\n\nNBCUniversal may, in its sole discretion, cancel your payment at any time by providing notice to you through your contact information or by a notice when you attempt to make a payment. NBCUniversal may cancel a payment or prevent you from initiating future payments for any reason, including, without limitation, the following: (i) if you attempt to use NBCUniversal Checkout in breach of any applicable law or regulation, including the card network rules or regulations; (ii) if you use NBCUniversal Checkout in breach of these Terms of Service; (iii) if NBCUniversal suspects fraudulent, unlawful or improper activity regarding a payment; (iv) if NBCUniversal detects, in its sole discretion, that your payments have excessive disputes, high reversal rates or present a relatively high risk of losses; or (v) failure to cooperate in an investigation or provide additional information when requested. Refunds and exchanges shall be subject to the terms set forth herein, as may be updated from time to time.\n\nCollection of Tax. We will collect applicable sales and seller’s use tax on sales made to all state and local jurisdictions. For purchases where sales tax is applicable you will see the tax calculated on the checkout page before you are asked to confirm the purchase. We use reasonable commercial efforts to calculate and remit the correct amount of tax required on each taxable purchase, but we do not guarantee the accuracy of the amount of the tax we represent to you as the tax owed. Minor errors may occur owing to the inability to accurately track multiple taxing districts, state and local “tax holidays,” the timing of rate changes or the application of certain taxes to categories of items we sell.\n\n3. Retailers, Product Purchases, Shipping and Returns\n\nRetailers. NBCUniversal Checkout includes products that are offered and fulfilled by third party sellers (“Retailer(s)”).\n\nFulfillment, Shipping and Delivery. If you purchase a product from a Retailer, we will share certain information (including your name and address) with that Retailer in order to permit the Retailer to fulfill and ship your order, process returns, and provide related service. We require all Retailers to keep your information secure. By purchasing a product from a Retailer, you acknowledge and agree that such an order will be fulfilled by the third-party Retailer and not by NBCUniversal. Shipping information is available on the check-out page before you complete your order and in our FAQs. Customer service information is available on the contact us page.\n\nReturns and Refunds. Products purchased from a Retailer must be directly returned to the Retailer from whom the product was purchased, in accordance with NBCUniversal Checkout Returns Policy. In some cases, the return or refund policy of a Shop Merchant may differ from NBCUniversal Checkout policies; if that is the case, the Shop Retailer’s policy will be stated within the Returns Policy.\n\nHow to Order Through NBCUniversal Checkout. When ordering, please follow all ordering instructions carefully. For products you order on NBCUniversal Checkout, you agree to pay the price, delivery fees, and applicable taxes. The prices displayed are quoted in U.S. dollars and are valid and effective only in the United States. When you purchase products through NBCUniversal Checkout, you will receive an order confirmation email acknowledging receipt of your order and the items purchased (“Order Confirmation”). This Order Confirmation does not mean that your order has been accepted by NBCUniversal or the Retailer(s). Your order is deemed accepted once it has been shipped. Any delivery dates provided on NBCUniversal Checkout or in emails are estimates. When all or portions of your order are shipped, you will receive an email confirming shipment (“Shipping Confirmation”).The Shipping Confirmation may include links to track or check the status of your order shipment.\n\nPrices, Availability, Errors and Product Descriptions. Products on NBCUniversal Checkout are subject to change without notice. NBCUniversal Checkout contains a large number of products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products listed on NBCUniversal Checkout may be incorrectly priced, the quantity or availability of a product may have changed just prior to your placing an order or other errors or inaccuracies may be displayed on the product page.\n\nPrices. Where a product's correct price is less than the stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the product to you. If a product's correct price is higher than the price stated on NBCUniversal Checkout, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection. We are under no obligation to provide the product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after an Order Confirmation or a Shipping Confirmation has been sent, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognized by you as a pricing error.\n\nAvailability. Unless indicated otherwise, most products featured on NBCUniversal Checkout will be available while supplies last. On occasion, you may be able to place a product in your shopping cart and submit your order for processing, but your order is subsequently cancelled due to unavailability of the product. You acknowledge that products may sell quickly and for a short period of time, listed products may become unavailable, even in cases where you were able to submit your order. You also agree that we may cancel your order without penalty even after you have received an Order Confirmation. On rare occasions, you may receive a Shipping Confirmation from us, but the product is no longer available in our inventory, our third-party fulfillment provider's inventory, or a Retailer’s inventory. You agree that we may cancel your order without penalty if the product you ordered is unable to ship due to unavailability.\n\nCorrecting Errors; Cancellation of Orders. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions on a product page. We have the right to decline or cancel an order (in whole or in part), prior to its acceptance or through refund of the amount charged, if it is discovered that the product information or pricing listed on NBCUniversal Checkout is incorrect. If you have already received your order, we will do our best to resolve any concerns you may have.\n\nProduct Descriptions. We have made a conscientious effort to display the products on NBCUniversal Checkout accurately so that you can get a good idea of the color, design, texture, sizes, look and configuration of the products featured. However, the detail and accuracy of the images of the products that you see as a visitor to NBCUniversal Checkout will depend on a number of things, including your computer equipment and Internet connections. Consequently, we cannot and do not guarantee that the product images available to you on NBCUniversal Checkout are accurate in every detail. Further, we attempt to be as accurate as possible with our product descriptions. However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that product descriptions or other content made available through NBCUniversal Checkout are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging. Product listings also may contain ratings and reviews obtained from third parties. Product reviews are the opinions of such third parties.\n\nShipping. We will only ship items to locations within the continental United States.\n\nThe term shipping or ship includes the commencement of shipping items in an order for multiple purchases or where the item purchased consists of components that must be shipped separately. For example, your order may consist of (1) several different items, (2) a quantity of the same item, or, (3) a single item with several component parts the size of which might require them to be shipped in separate packages. In such orders, individual packages may be shipped out together so that they arrive at the same time; however, when that may not be possible, shipping may commence by shipping individual packages in the order that items are available for shipment and when conditions permit. In such instances, notification to you that your order has “shipped,” marks the time when shipping has commenced; it does not mean that all items in the order have shipped at that time.\n\nAll packages sent have a separate tracking number and you will receive tracking information in the Shipment Confirmation.\n\nRisk of Loss. All items purchased through NBCUniversal Checkout are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon delivery of the item to the carrier.\n\n4. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Notification\n\nNBCUniversal Checkout NBCUniversal is not designed or intended for use by children under the age of 13.\n\nPursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d) as amended, NBCUniversal hereby notifies you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors.

Social media plug-ins of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus (amongst others) may be integrated on our Site and other online services. Where our online services contain a plug-in to a social network, these are clearly marked (e.g. with a Facebook button). If you chose to click on one of these buttons or links, your browser connects directly to the servers of the relevant social network. The social network directly transmits the content of the plugin to your browser. If you are registered on the relevant social network and logged into your respective account the social network receives the information that the web page was used by you.

The Service and materials incorporated by NBCUniversal therein are protected by copyrights, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Some of the characters, logos or other images incorporated by NBCUniversal in NBCUniversal Checkout are also protected as registered or unregistered trademarks, trade names and/or service marks owned by NBCUniversal or others.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, NBCUniversal, pursuant to applicable law, reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate your license to use NBCUniversal Checkout if it determines in its sole and absolute discretion that you are involved in infringing activity, including alleged acts of first-time or repeat infringement, regardless of whether the material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing.\n\nNBCUniversal accommodates and does not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to protect their materials. Therefore, if you believe that any such third party materials infringe your intellectual property please send a written notice to the agent identified below to request a review of the alleged infringement:\n\nBy mail:\n\nNBCUniversal Content Commerce, LLC\n\nc/o NBCUniversal Media, LLC\n\nDMCA Agent\n\nNBCUniversal Law Department\n\n30 Rockefeller Plaza, Rm. 1087E\n\nNew York, New York 10112\n\nBy e-mail: dmca.agent@nbcuni.com\n\n20. Export Control\n\nNBCUniversal Checkout are controlled and operated by us from our offices within the State of New York. You hereby represent and warrant that (A) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo (Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria); (B) you are not listed on any U.S., United Nations Security Council (UNSC), UK or EU government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons administered by the U.S. Treasury Department or the U.S. Commerce Department’s Denied Persons List; and (C) you are not otherwise the target of U.S., UNSC, UK or EU economic sanctions.

Software in or from NBCUniversal Checkout are further subject to U.S. export controls. No software may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of applicable laws, including without limitation to any end user in a U.S. embargoed country or territory or an end user included on any U.S, UNSC, UK or EU government list of prohibited or restricted parties.\n\n21. Binding Arbitration of All Disputes; No Class Relief\n\nANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SHOPS AT NBCUNIVERSAL SERVICE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, MANDATORY ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT AND IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY. YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\n\nThis Section 21 is deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. You and NBCUniversal agree that we intend that this Section 21 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 21 can only be amended by mutual agreement. For non-U.S. residents, if binding arbitration is adjudged by a tribunal to be unenforceable, the provisions of Section 21 below shall apply to all relevant disputes between you and us.\n\nWe believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of Service and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with NBCUniversal Checkout (including this Site), (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with NBCUniversal made through NBCUniversal Checkout, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to NBCUniversal or that NBCUniversal may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction conducted through NBCUniversal Checkout (collectively, “NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships”), YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE A CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY DECIDE THE CLAIM AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION. To the extent permitted by applicable law, by clicking to indicate your agreement to these Terms of Service and by using or interacting with the Site or NBCUniversal Checkout, or engaging in any other NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below. In the event that this CLASS ACTION WAIVER is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.\n\nWe will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. To the extent permitted by applicable law, by agreeing to these Terms of Service and by using NBCUniversal Checkout, you agree that, if those efforts fail, any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against NBCUniversal, and any claim that NBCUniversal may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, or any NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships, shall be resolved exclusively by final, and binding, and confidential arbitration (“Arbitration”) administered by JAMS or its successor (“JAMS”) and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the “Applicable Rules”). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com. If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the “AAA”) instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the “Applicable Rules” in such circumstances). If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness or successor or analogous policies in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute (“Minimum Standards”), NBCUniversal agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 21, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart E or I below. Furthermore, this Section 21 shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. You further agree that:\n\nA. Single Arbitrator. The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and NBCUniversal (the “Arbitrator”);\n\nB. Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement. The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and/or the arbitration provisions in this Section 21, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable;\n\nC. Location of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and us; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.\n\nD. Governing Law. The Arbitrator shall (i) apply internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles, unless the laws of your jurisdiction require the application of your local laws; (ii) entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable, or, to the extent required by applicable law, your local jurisdiction’s rules of procedure; (iii) honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;\n\nE. No Class Relief. The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or NBCUniversal’s individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;\n\nF. Written Award. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an “Award”). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;\n\nG. Arbitration Costs. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, NBCUniversal will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;\n\nH. Reasonable Attorney’s Fees. In the event you recover an Award greater than NBCUniversal’s last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award NBCUniversal’s reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees associated with the Arbitration, but NBCUniversal shall in all events bear its own attorneys’ fees; and\n\nI. Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause. With the exception of subpart E above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart E is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor NBCUniversal shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nJ. Confidentiality of Arbitration. You and NBCUniversal agree to maintain the confidential nature of the Arbitration and shall not disclose the fact of the Arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the Arbitration, the Arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any Award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the Arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to such confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an Award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.\n\nModification of Arbitration Clause with Notice NBCUniversal may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after NBCUniversal has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from NBCUniversal Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.\n\nSmall Claims Matters are Excluded; No Class Relief or Joinder of Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against NBCUniversal in small claims court in New York (or your local equivalent) if your claim is within such court’s jurisdictional limit; provided, that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.\n\n22. Dispute Resolution for Non-U.S. Residents Only if a Tribunal has Ruled that Arbitration is Prohibited by Law\n\nThis Section 22 applies to non-U.S. residents only, where applicable law prohibits arbitration of disputes in accordance with Section 21 above.\n\nA. Section 22 disputes. If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to NBCUniversal Checkout, Content, these Terms of Service, whether heretofore or hereafter arising, or to any of NBCUniversal’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (collectively, a \"Section 22 Dispute\"), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Section 22 Dispute along with a proposed resolution.

Jurisdiction. The parties agree that the state or federal courts in the State of New York (or, if required by applicable law, the courts in your local jurisdiction) shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Section 22 Dispute.\n\nC. Governing Law. To the maximum extent permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms of Service and any Section 22 Dispute arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes) will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the U.S. and the State of New York (or, if required by applicable law, the laws of your local jurisdiction) without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.\n\nD. Limited Time to File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A SECTION 22 DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 22(A) ABOVE) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE SECTION 22 DISPUTE ARISES, OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.\n\nE. Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 22 will not apply to any legal action taken by NBCUniversal to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to NBCUniversal Checkout, any Content, your User Content and/or NBCUniversal’s intellectual property rights, NBCUniversal’s operations, and/or NBCUniversal’s products or services.\n\n23.
