        "text": "Background\n\nThe Oxygen Network (branded as Oh! Oxygen from 2003-2008) was launched on February 1, 2000 by the privately-held Oxygen Media, which was founded in 1998 by former Nickelodeon executive Geraldine Laybourne, talk-show host and Harpo Studios owner Oprah Winfrey (who later founded her own network, OWN), media executive Lisa Gersh, and producers Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach, the latter three of whom were at the time owners of The Carsey-Werner Company.\n\nThe channel was originally an interactive service focusing on original programming with some reruns (including Carsey-Werner's output and Kate & Allie), and featured what was referred to as \"the stripe\", which was a black bar occupying the bottom 12% of the screen which would show various information (the interactive part involved the channel's website); the stripe was eventually dropped. The channel later begun to focus chiefly on reality shows, reruns, and movies; among the network's highlight shows around that time were Snapped, Girls Behaving Badly and Bad Girls Club.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, NBCUniversal announced it would purchase Oxygen for $925 million; the sale was completed on November 20, and the network rebranded to simply Oxygen.\n\n1st Logo (2003-June 2008)\n\nVisuals: The big 3D text \"oh!\" flies in over a magenta background with pink bars and white lights moving around. As it settles, it emits light sparks and slightly zooms in as \"oxygen\" fades in below the \"h\". The website URL \"oxygen.com\" in white appears on the bottom.\n\nTechnique: CGI by AdamsMorioka.\n\nAudio: A whoosh with a synth choir theme, or the ending theme of the show/movie.\n\nAvailability: Can be seen on original programming until 2008, such as Husband for Hire, The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency, and early seasons of Snapped and Bad Girls Club.\n\n2nd Logo (2003-June 2008)\n\nVisuals: The \"oh!\" moniker, now black with a slight gold tint, is revealed from a white flash, panning and zooming away from the screen. It stands on a white floor with a yellow background behind it. After it centers, the background gains orange stripes and \"The Oxygen Network\" (\"Oxygen\" being the network logo) appears below the moniker.\n\nTechnique: CGI by AdamsMorioka.\n\nAudio: Same as before.\n\nAvailability: It was concurrently used with the previous logo, mostly on TV movies such as Girls Behaving Badly and Romancing the Bride. It also appeared on the pilot of The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency."
