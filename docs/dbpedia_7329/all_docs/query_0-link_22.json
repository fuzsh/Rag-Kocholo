You could say it's an extension of TBS, TNT, and truTV sports as it airs select (not all) games from those channels, but it also covers so much more, including other sports like golf, cycling, and MMA. Since October 2023, B/R Sports has been added to all Max plans completely free of charge, but once the promo ends, you'll have to pay $10/month on top of your Max subscription to enjoy B/R content.

You'll also get ESPN, Fox Sports, and local channels depending on your area. If you're looking for a way not to just get TNT but to get access to a large bundle of live TV channels, DIRECTV Stream is a great way to cut the cord completely while keeping access to popular networks. Of course, DIRECTV Stream requires no satellite dishes, contracts, or commitments to watch TNT and other channels.\n\nSling Orange: Sling Orange costs $40/month making it the most affordable way to stream TNT anywhere online. You'll also get the sister channel TBS, ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN3. For sports fans, especially NBA watchers, Sling Orange offers a great price-to-coverage ratio.\n\nSling Orange + Blue: For those who don't want to choose between Sling Blue (Fox Sports and local channels) and Sling Orange (ESPN), Sling Orange+Blue is a bundle that combines both while saving $25/month. Of course both Sling offerings include TNT and TBS, so they are both included here.\n\nSling Blue: Sling Blue offers TNT for $45, but unlike Sling Orange, it offers both TNT sister channels: TBS and TruTV (Sling Orange only offers TBS with TNT). What really sets Sling Blue apart is that depending on your area it can include FOX, ABC, or NBC local channels. Sling Blue is cheaper than other streaming services like Youtube TV, and of course much cheaper than cable, making it a great way to save some money while keeping access to TNT, Fox Sports, and in some cases local channels.\n\nHulu with Live TV: Sitting at $76/month, Hulu with Live TV is not exactly the most affordable way to watch TNT, but you will be getting a lot for your money: most major channels, local channels, and a big on-demand library. Hulu + Live TV currently offers a 3 day free trial, which includes TNT. This means that you can subscribe, stream TNT, and cancel without being charged for three days.\n\nYouTube TV: What if to watch TNT you can do so from the comfort of Youtube's highly optimized interface? This is the strenght of Youtube TV: the reliability and quality of the internet's biggest video service. You'll get TNT with its sister channels TBS and TruTV, as well as most major national and local channnels. Don't have time to say, catch an NBA game live on TNT? Youtube TV includes unlimited cloud DVR, so you can add as many programs or sports events as you want to your library to watch later.\n\nSpectrum TV Choice: Spectrum TV Choice is an \"a la carte\" cord-cutting service: you take your pick of 15 channels and you only pay for those. You can select from a long list of channels that includes TBS, TruTV, and of course TNT. Because the list of channels also includes ESPN and Fox Sports, both of which are usually jack up the price of streaming packages, Spectrum TV Choice offers good value to stream TNT and cut the cord. The only catch? You have to be in a Spectrum \"serviceable area\" to subscribe.\n\nVenu: TNT, TBS, TruTV, all the ESPNs including ESPN+, and both Fox Sports channels for $42.99: this is the promise of Venu, a new streamer set to launch in 2024. The current launch date is set for this August 23rd.\n\nMax + B/R Sports Add-on: Max's The Bleacher Report add-on is a good way to stream many live events from TNT including March Madness, the NBA Playoffs, The Stanley Cup Playoffs, and some MLB games. Right now it is free for Max subscribers, and it also includes content from TBS and TruTV.\n\nThe streaming services on this page were chosen by our editors.
