        "text": "The Oxygen network will debut three new reality shows and is developing four new projects for its 2009-10 season. The cable network, owned by NBC Universal, announced Wednesday it will add “The Naughty Kitchen With Chef Blythe Beck,” “Dance Your Ass Off” and “Addicted to Beauty” later this year.\n\nOxygen’s development slate includes a reality series starring former “Cosby” kid Keisha Knight Pulliam; “Celeb-U-Moms,” an unscripted series about a group of Hollywood mothers; and a couples’ makeover show titled “Mr. & Mrs. Makeover.” Plans are also in place to produce a made-for-TV movie about Tori Spelling and her husband Dean McDermott, whose “Tori & Dean” franchise continues to anchor Oxygen’s slate.\n\n“All of our programming initiatives and our decision to move forward with another night of originals underscore Oxygen’s long term strategy to appeal to a very valuable audience,” Amy Introcaso-Davis, Oxygen’s senior vice president of original programming and development, said during an upfront presentation in New York.\n\n“We delivered that coveted demo this past quarter and are ‘living out loud’ with new projects featuring boisterous, saucy, charismatic and over-the-top personalities whose distinctive voice has set our network apart from the pack.”\n\nSee below for the network’s full list of shows:\n\n\"Dance Your Ass Off\"\n\nPremieres: This summer\n\nOxygen brings dance, diet and divas together with the new dance/weight-loss competition series \"Dance Your Ass Off.\" Tony Award-winning actress Marissa Jaret Winokur, well known for her role as plus-sized Tracy Turnblad in the hit Broadway musical \"Hairspray,\" will serve as host. In this unique show, talented, full-figured contestants who struggle with their weight will dance to unleash their inner thin. Each contestant will be paired with a professional dance partner who will train them for their weekly stage performances – ranging from Hip Hop, to Ballroom and even Pole Dancing! Then they’ll shake and rattle their rolls in front of a live studio audience and a panel of expert judges: choreographer Danny Teeson, dancer/choreographer Mayte Garcia, and dancer/actress Lisa Ann Walter. \"Dance Your Ass Off\" is scheduled to premiere on Oxygen this summer. Executive Produced by SallyAnn Salsano of 495 Productions and Lisa Ann Walter and Kate Rigg.\n\n\"Addicted to Beauty\"\n\nPremieres: Later this year\n\nOxygen pulls back the curtain on the tantalizing world of medi-spas with a new office docu-comedy, \"Addicted to Beauty.\" As seen through the eyes of the larger than life staff at one of the country’s hottest beauty enhancement facilities in California, the eight one -hour episodes examine the young, highly dysfunctional team who provide Restylane injections and hits of Botox(r) to the rich and pampered – and sample the goods themselves during their coffee breaks. Executive Produced by Mike Duffy, Greg Goldman, and Chris Coelen of RDF USA (\"Secret Millionaire,\" Wife Swap\") as well as Mechelle Collins and Kevin Dill of Intuitive Entertainment (\"The Millionaire Matchmaker,\" \"Sunset Tan\").\n\n\"The Naughty Kitchen with Chef Blythe Beck\"\n\nPremieres: Later this year\n\nTake one fiery young chef on a quest for total world culinary domination, mix her with distinctive and sexy American cuisine, add a cutting edge Dallas restaurant with a loud cast of characters…and you’ve got the recipe for \"The Naughty Kitchen with Chef Blythe Beck.\" Blythe, a 29-year old Texas native, who is plus-sized in stature and\n\npersonality, is the naughty head chef at Central 214 – a top-rated Dallas restaurant. Oxygen will follow Beck’s life running the kitchen and the colorful crew at Central 214, as they interact with the elite of Dallas and the local private university students in and out of the restaurant. From Authentic Entertainment (\"Flipping Out,\" \"Ace of Cakes\"), \"The Naughty Kitchen with Blythe Beck\" is executive produced by Lauren Lexton, Tom Rogan, Brandy Menefee, Brad Hall and Code Entertainment.\n\nIN DEVELOPMENT\n\n\"Keshia and Kaseem\" (WT)\n\nFormer Cosby kid Keshia Knight Pulliam (\"Rudy\") and her entrepreneur boyfriend and business partner, Kaseem Penn, learn first-hand how the trivial turns epic when newly cohabitating. Together for almost two years, Keshia has recently forsaken her Atlanta home, spending most of her time at Kaseem’s place in the exclusive Cascades community of Atlanta. Between Keshia’s exploding television and movie career, and Kaseem’s many business endeavors, the relationship questions loom… Is it possible to have a successful union without the ceremony? This docu-series follows the ups and downs of being young, rich, single … AND living together. Executive produced by Tracey E. Edmonds of Edmonds Entertainment (\"College Hill,\" \"Soul Food\"); Keshia Knight Pulliam and Kaseem Penn of Pullpen Productions.\n\nCeleb-U-Moms\n\nCeleb-U-Moms is a docu-series that follows the action-packed, personal and professional lives of a group of Hollywood moms juggling life, love, family and friendship along with their glamorous careers. These women live the polished life of designer dresses and beautiful people, hitting the hottest premieres with access to the hippest clubs and coolest people – but when they get home, they’ve got diapers to change and screaming toddlers to soothe. Oxygen will see how quickly a celebrity mom goes from glitz and glamour to ragged and regular. Executive produced by Randy Barbato, Fenton Bailey and Tom Campbell of World of Wonder (\"Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood,\" \"Million Dollar Listing\").\n\n\"Mr. & Mrs. Makeover\" (WT)\n\nIn this pilot for series, developed by and starring Tori Spelling and her husband Dean McDermott, couples will experience the ultimate in makeover magic: both in how they live and how they look. Part marriage counseling, part makeover, each couple will spend time with Tori and Dean who uncover what makes each partner tick; what works and what doesn’t work about their relationship; and create a forum for opening\n\nthe door to a stronger and more honest partnership. Tori and Dean use physical change both personally and in their surroundings to create a foundation to jumpstart their relationships. Executive produced by Randy Barbato, Fenton Bailey of World of Wonder (\"Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood,\" \"Million Dollar Listing\"), Tori Spelling & Dean McDermott."
