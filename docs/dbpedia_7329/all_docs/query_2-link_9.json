        "text": "For 20 years, Oxygen’s Snapped has chronicled lives of women who lost control and were charged with murder. Over 33 seasons, the beloved true-crime series was one of the first shows launched in the now popular genre and will have produced more than 646 episodes by the end of this season.\n\nTo celebrate the 20-year anniversary of Snapped, Oxygen is kicking off Season 33 with a two-hour special on Sunday, May 12 at 6/5c. The two-hour special reexamines a case previously featured on the series, the “Internet’s first murder trial.” This season of Snapped is on track to be its best season ever, and is pacing to grow for the fifth season in the row.\n\nBased on the viewership of Snapped, in 2016, Oxygen began its shift as a true crime-oriented channel. The network started with “Crime Time” airing Fridays to Mondays which was a primetime block. Since the true crime programming was such a success with the targeted demo of women between ages 25-54, in 2017 Oxygen implemented a new logo featuring the name in the style of yellow police tape.\n\nThis focus had a strong launch because of the successful legacy shows already on the network such as Snapped, and various spin offs. Then came original series such as Cold Justice and Criminal Confessions from executive producer and longtime NBCU partner, Dick Wolf.\n\nOxygen continues to make new compelling content for their loyal crime junkie fan base. Earlier this year, Oxygen aired its most watched series in over nine years, Selena & Yolanda: The Secrets Between Them which dove deep into the infamous murder of rising pop star Selena Quintanilla Perez. Selena & Yolanda: The Secrets Between Them is available to stream on Peacock."
