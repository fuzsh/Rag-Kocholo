        "text": "It is Friday late afternoon. On one cable channel for women, there is an earnest documentary on the struggle for equality by the women's crew team at Yale in 1976.\n\nOn another, there is a made-for-TV movie, starring Joanna Kerns (of the old hit sitcom ''Growing Pains''), about a woman who develops amnesia, and forgets that her husband is molesting their child.\n\nWomen have consistently favored the latter. The made-for-TV movie was shown on the Lifetime channel, the highest-rated cable network in the country thanks to a steady diet of sitcoms, movies, and dramas tailored to a female audience. Oxygen, which showcased the Ivy League rowers, casts itself as a cable network for more discerning women. Its morning exercise program (''Inhale'') is yoga, performed in muted tones of sea-green and putty designer sweats. (In contrast, Lifetime has the perky fitness expert Denise Austin doing beach aerobics in hot-pink spandex.)\n\nOxygen, which started in February 2000 and is owned by Oxygen Media, is now selling its sensibility to New York City, a critical testing ground for an independent cable network plagued by high expectations and poor reviews. Oxygen is lightening its schedule mix, adding a new talk show conducted by the exuberant fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, as well as mainstream reruns like ''Xena, Warrior Princess.''\n\n''Please don't say Oxygen is gasping for air,'' Oxygen's chief and founder, Geraldine Laybourne, said with a plaintive laugh. ''We are bursting with energy.''\n\nNew York, the epicenter of advertising and media attention, is critical for Oxygen.\n\nOxygen began being shown on the cable systems of AOL Time Warner in September, bringing it into 10 million new homes, 1.2 million of them in New York. Until that deal, which broadened Oxygen's reach to 30 million homes, (Lifetime has more than 80 million), the start-up was fighting for viewers in cities like Atlanta and Dallas, which are to the New York media market what a New Haven tryout is to Broadway.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
