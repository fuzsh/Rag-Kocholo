        "text": "Oxygen‘s latest true crime series Sins of the South comes from one of the biggest names in entertainment: Dick Wolf. Well-known for his scripted crime dramas, Wolf and his production company Wolf Entertainment are also players in the reality TV space, and now they’re getting into the trend of region-specific true crime.\n\nAs the title indicates, Sins of the South focuses on shocking and dramatic crimes that have taken place in the Southern United States. Across twelve episodes, the series visits major Southern cities including New Orleans and Miami. The show continues Wolf Entertainment’s partnership with Oxygen; the company is behind Cold Justice, one of the most important series in true crime history, which ended its eighth season on May 12 and has already been renewed for Season 9.\n\nThe company has also produced the underrated Murder for Hire, Criminal Confessions and 911 Crisis Center for Oxygen, which is a sister network to NBC.\n\nBut Sins of the South is taking the Wolf Entertainment brand in a new direction when it premieres on Sunday, May 12 at 7:00 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nThe Miami episode will center on one of that city’s most well-known cases—described as “the unfathomable killing of a Miami Beach hotel heir,” the press release is likely referring to the murder of Ben Novack, Jr., who was slain along with his mother Bernice in 2009. The Novack murders were very high-profile, and have been previously featured on several true crime shows, most notably CNBC’s American Greed spinoff American Greed: Deadly Rich (in the series premiere episode “Bound for Murder”).\n\nThe series comes to a network that is already home to The Real Murders of Orange County, The Real Murders of Atlanta and New York Homicide. Oxygen will also be debuting Philly Homicide, which is centered in Philadelphia, as part of its 2024-2025 programming slate. With competition at its highest thanks to the large number of true crime TV shows, producers are increasingly zeroing in on specific audiences.\n\nThat angle and Dick Wolf’s name will likely get a number of people checking out Sins of the South; interested viewers can check out the trailer for the series below.\n\nSins of the South airs Sundays at 7:00 p.m. ET/PT on Oxygen."
