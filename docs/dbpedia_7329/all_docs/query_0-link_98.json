        "text": "You can watch Hallmark Channel streaming without cable on seven different live TV streaming services.\n\nfrndly TV, Peacock, Philo, Hulu Live TV, Sling TV, Fubo, DIRECTV STREAM, and YouTube TV all stream Hallmark Channel live without a cable or satellite subscription.\n\nHallmark Channel has been a premium cable network since 2001, known for hits like “When Calls the Heart,” “The Way Home,” and “Ride.” Most of these services let you watch Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Drama, and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries.\n\nHow Can I Watch Hallmark Channel?\n\nLive TV services that carry Hallmark Channel usually include its sister networks, Hallmark Drama and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries. All services listed below carry Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, and Hallmark Drama.\n\nPhilo, fuboTV, frndly TV, DIRECTV STREAM, Sling TV, and YouTube TV all stream Hallmark Channel and its sister networks in their channel lineups. But Peacock is now the cheapest way to watch these channels live without cable.\n\nAll you need is an internet connection to get started. Once you pick a streaming service and sign up for a plan, you can start streaming Hallmark Channel on a Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, or Chromecast. Smart TVs from Samsung, Sony, and LG support these services. You can watch TV on your iPhone or iPad as well. Just make sure your iOS software is updated.\n\nThere are a few advantages to using a live TV streaming service instead of cable or satellite. You can easily cancel your subscription online if you don’t want it anymore.\n\nNo more dealing with customer service reps on the phone. No more contracts. Some cord-cutters even jump from one streaming platform to another just so they can have a certain set of channels when a new season of a favorite show comes on the air.\n\nSubscribers to these services can also activate the Hallmark Channel app to watch live TV shows or on-demand programs. Xfinity internet customers can also stream Hallmark Channel live.\n\nMost of these live TV streaming services have a free trial, so you can see if it’s a good fit for you without having to pay anything.\n\nPeacock\n\nA Peacock subscription is an affordable way to live stream all three Hallmark Channels. The Premium plan costs $5.99 per month. In October 2022, Peacock struck a deal with Hallmark Media to stream live and on-demand programming from Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, and Hallmark Drama.\n\nYou can use the dedicated Hallmark hub within Peacock to find all the shows and latest holiday movies from the various Hallmark channels. So, you can easily find the annual Countdown to Christmas once it kicks off. New shows on NBC such as “Law & Order” and “Top Chef VIP” are on Peacock along with originals such as “Mrs. Davis.”\n\nFor sports fans, Peacock has live Sunday Night Football, Notre Dame Football, Premier League, NASCAR, INDYCAR, and WWE events. Some of this programming comes from NBC Sports.\n\nIf you are a Premium Plus subscriber at $11.99 per month, you can get a local live NBC station as well as commercial-free access to on-demand shows and movies.\n\nPhilo\n\nPhilo specializes in sought-after entertainment channels once exclusive to cable TV.\n\nHallmark Channel, Hallmark Drama, and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries are included in the channel lineup. A&E, BET, Discovery, BBC America, Great American Family, History Channel, Game Show Network, HGTV, MTV, TLC, AMC, and Paramount Network are part of a Philo subscription.\n\nSubscribers get unlimited Cloud DVR. So you can record a whole season of a show with one click of your remote. In addition to the slate of live TV channels, new subscribers also get AMC+, which carries movies and series from AMC+, Sundance Now, and Shudder.\n\nPhilo doesn’t carry any sports channels or local channels. And that’s why the company can keep its monthly price so low. A subscription costs $28 per month.\n\nYou can watch live TV through your Philo app on a Roku, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Google Chromecast, or Apple TV. Philo has apps for iPhones and iPads. Philo supports activating more than 40 apps. So if you wanted to catch up on a favorite show on your AMC app, now you can. I’ve been subscribing to Philo since 2017 and remain very happy with the service.\n\nCheck out the channel selection or sign up for a free 7-day trial. You can easily cancel online if Philo isn’t for you.\n\nfubo\n\nfubo (formerly fuboTV) has all three Hallmark networks in its entry-level Pro channel bundle. Don’t be fooled into thinking that fuboTV is only about college football, NASCAR, and ESPN.\n\nThis live TV streaming platform aims to be an overall replacement for a cable TV or satellite provider. Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Drama, and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries are included.\n\nThe fubo Pro bundle has 181 channels total. A&E, Bravo, HGTV, Travel Channel, National Geographic, Oxygen Network, Paramount Network, Food Network, Fox News, Lifetime Movies, and Fox News make up its diverse channel lineup.\n\nSubscribers get local ABC, NBC, and FOX stations along with regional sports networks from Bally Sports and NBC Sports. fubo includes unlimited Cloud DVR and features entertainment and select sports in 4K picture resolution.\n\nA subscription costs $79.99 per month. A regional sports fee of $11.99 to $14.99 per month is included. fubo carries Hallmark channels within fubo’s two other plans.\n\nThe Elite plan is $89.99 per month and has 65 more sports, news, and entertainment channels. The Premier plan has 264 channels, including Paramount Plus with Showtime, for $99.99 per month.\n\nfuboTV works on Amazon Fire TV, Roku, Apple TV, Smart TVs, and Google Chromecast with Google TV. Check out what local channels fuboTV has before signing up for a free 7-day trial.\n\nHulu Live TV\n\nHulu Live TV has over 90 live TV channels, including Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries. Hulu Live TV has only one plan. You can watch live TV on up to two screens at once.\n\nHulu with Live TV comes with unlimited DVR storage so you can record sports, news, movies, or whatever else you want.\n\nHulu carries local ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC across the U.S. A subscription costs $76.99 per month and now includes ad-supported subscriptions to Disney+ and ESPN+. With a Hulu Live TV subscription, you can also activate the Hallmark app on your Smart TV or streaming device.\n\nHulu Live TV currently offers a 3-day free trial for live TV to new and returning customers.\n\nFrndly\n\nfrndly TV is an affordable option for watching popular TV networks without cable. frndly carries more than 40 live TV channels, including A&E, History, and The Weather Channel. All three Hallmark Channels are included in the three plans that frndly offers.\n\nThe streaming service has a basic plan that is $7.99 per month.

It includes Hallmark Drama, Hallmark Channel, and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries.\n\nAt $46 per month, Sling TV is a budget option for replacing your cable subscription.\n\nSling TV has two main channel bundles called Sling Orange and Sling Blue. You can subscribe to either the Orange or Blue bundle for $40 per month.\n\nBut you’ll need to subscribe to an add-on channel bundle called Lifestyle Extra for all the Hallmark networks. It costs another $6 per month.\n\nSling Orange has Comedy Central, ESPN, AMC, and Disney Channel. Adding Lifestyle Extra adds 10 channels under the Orange plan. Sling Blue has NFL Network, HGTV, and Food Network. Lifestyle Extra with the Blue bundle adds 10 more channels. You will have 56 channels total. Sling Blue is probably the better deal for most people. But you can look over the Sling TV channel lineup before deciding.\n\nYou can start watching with a Roku, Fire TV, Smart TVs, Google Chromecast, and smartphones.
