I love this app! I get to catch up on episodes of shows that I missed over the past several months or even a year. See, you do not subscribe to cable, dish, or have an antenna. We watch a lot of Redbox movies.\n\nBut, when I visit my family in PA, I can watch all of those stupid shows that are really useless television. No lessons learned, family values (already raised my children), or vulgar language. So, I really only have two shows that I watch on TLCgo. They are: My Big Fat Fabulous Life, because I can relate to Whitney with being a large person at one time of my life. Plus, if I could get ahold of Todd, I would be telling him, âThe world does not revolve around you and grow up!â The other show I like to watch is, â90 Day FiancÃ© â. Because people are ssooooo darn stupid to think that person you brought not our country is here for your love.....think again!! It is a rarity that the marriages really do work out.\n\nAs for the commercials, at least the app lets you know how many commercials you will be having. Regular TV does not do that, and then you never know when to leave the room. Is their going to be another commercial or not, do I have time for a drink, etc. Plus, it is a free app....just be grateful for that! ð¥\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHey Zeus! Glad you love the app and get to have some moments of guilt-free watching! We'd love to know what we can do to push your review from 4 stars to 5 stars! Let us know at the link below. http://tlc.custhelp.com/\n\nCLBBR ,\n\nTLC\n\nI enjoy this app, just way too many commercials. If/when I rewind I do not like that I have to re-watch the same 8 commercials, they should be skipped over and go straight into the show if they have already been played. It would be nice to have a 10 second rewind option so that doesnât happen, or if Iâm interrupted or have to stop watching and come back later and I rewind part of an episode, it would be nice to not have to watch the same commercials again to find your place in the show if you have to go backwards a segment or 2. Itâs annoying and a big time waster. I understand the need for commercials, but there are a lot, and repeating in the same place commercials have already been played can be frustrating.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nRight now, due to the current functionality, moving around a video will cause the ads to play again even if you've already watched those breaks. Love your feature request however, itâs a great idea and appreciate you sharing it with us. If you have any additional suggestions to improve your experience please let us know. It's possible that requests such as yours will be added in the future, so stay tuned for updates.\n\nMolson125 ,\n\nDisappointed\n\nHonestly, I expected a lot more from this app. The idea is great and I really do love the fact that I can catch up on episodes of shows I missed. But the app is too flawed for me to be able to use it effectively. It requires me to resign in to my tv provider every time I open the app which is frustrating. Even after signing in sometimes it wonât let me watch episodes Iâm usually able to watch because theyâre âlockedâ. When I click on them to see why theyâre locked, it says itâs because Iâm not signed in even when I am!! Then once Iâm finally able to watch episodes, they will often skip. Meaning, Iâll start watching the beginning of an episode and out of nowhere itâs skips to the end! This is so frustrating because when I try to rewind it back to the beginning, the app glitches and then will shut down. These are only a few of the problems Iâve encountered, trust me there are a lot more. I truly love TLC, and wish they would put more time into working out these bugs so I can properly enjoy the app and episodes I miss.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThank you for the detailed feedback, we're very sorry that you've been experiencing these issues with the app. Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app recently?
