I'm also exhibiting the same as Jackamus\n\nOK, thank you. Sorry I missed the announcement you made a few days ago. Well, this does kind of suck but oh well, I'll adapt. I have OTA at least for the local NBC station. Thanks again.\n\nI should say though, MSNBC was working as of this morning. So, I wonder if this is just a TVE issue. Oh well.\n\nI am having the same issues with CNBC & MSNBC, but mine are 500 not the 504 errors that you received. CNBC & MSNBC are still available via TVE, they have nothing to do with the sports channels the other person was talking about.\n\nWill other NBC owned networks be affected?\n\nAt the time of writing, all other NBC owned networks are still working. We expect them to transition to the new streaming technology in the future and will eventually become unavailable in Channels as well. But time will tell.\n\nNBC and NBC Sports Networks No Longer Available via TV Everywhere Providers - Announcements - Channels Community (getchannels.com)\n\nIâ€™m getting this from those channels\n\nThat is what I am hoping as well.\n\nNBCUniversal is shifting to a DRM format for all of their networks that is incompatible with CDVR. The first to make the shift was the NBC regional sports networks. A list of networks would include those you listed as well as USA, E, SYFY and a few others. The timing for transitions is unknown so it could be that the DRM switch has occurred or it is another issue that may be resolved in the interim. Remember TVE is experimental and may come in and out with provider updates.\n\nIt looks like it's drm. Check out the dvr prerelease notes.\n\nv2023.04.18.2208\n\nNBC Universal stations no longer work over TVE and have been disabled\n\nI think they are trying to fight piracy.\n\nAll this move will do, is inspire more of it.\n\nIt's honestly been amazing to me it's taken this long for some major stations to drm. If you think about it's kind of nuts that before this pretty much every cable channel other than a few premium sports networks and PBS lol sent their feed out on their website unprotected.\n\nWell,\n\nThe networks mostly offer sports content. Local stations and the fact that they are local seem to be less important.\n\nTugotv has msnbc.\n\nI'm running the levelnews docker and really like having access to News Nation.\n\nMaybe localbtv will get an agreement going at some point."
