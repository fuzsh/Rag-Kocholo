        "text": "DIG\n\nDemi-Leigh has found that some of the greatest moments of her life, though wonderful, could not and did not fulfill her deepest needs. Her new book explores what she was missing at those times – an identity rooted in Christ alone – and how we all can come to rest in that truth. With four sections, she helps us visualize finding one’s true identity through the analogy of gardening. The first section, “Dig,” exhorts us to “untangle your identity from your label,” and to “dig into the falsehoods that trip us up and keep us from moving forward.” With characteristic transparency, Demi-Leigh reveals some of the falsehoods that held her captive for years. The largest one thus far in her life is how she felt after crowning her Miss Universe successor. “The end of my reign as Miss Universe was my rug-ripped-from-underneath-my-six-inch-heels moment. I had dedicated years of my life working toward that goal, and it was suddenly over in the space of the one minute and twenty-two seconds it took for me to do my farewell walk,” she recalls. She says she felt stranded in a future that was no longer clear. “It’s filled with doubt, questions, anxiety, and in my case, an identity crisis. It was my identity. My source of confidence. I had no idea what I was going to do next.” Demi went on to do the digging and planting she needed to do and found the answers.\n\nYears before that experience, Demi-Leigh went through a rough season with her family that caused her to doubt God’s goodness for a time. Her parents divorced when she was young, and both later remarried. When Demi was ten, she received the happy news that she was going to be a big sister, as her dad and stepmom were expecting. Franje, her new sister, was born with cerebellar agenesis, “a rare condition in which the brain forms without the cerebellum, which controls smooth movement. When it does not develop, the rest of the brain must compensate, which it cannot do completely” (Wikipedia). Demi-Leigh says her family walked through an agonizing journey of medical treatments and caring for Franje. It caused her to ask God many questions, such as: “Why won’t God heal her when I know He can? Why did He allow this to happen to Franje? Why do my parents have to see their daughter hurting? Why does this feel so hopeless? My faith was rattled throughout my teenage years into my early adulthood,” Demi admits. Franje lived to nearly fourteen years old, then died in 2019. What she learned from Franje, Demi-Leigh says, is invaluable. “My sister taught me that when we look at all human beings through God’s lens, we will know that everyone is an image-bearer of God. There may be painful circumstances in your life that don’t make sense now but know that one day they will. God’s trustworthy hand in it all is undeniable. We may not get all the answers to our why questions this side of heaven, but we can choose to trust that God sees clearly.”\n\nPLANT\n\n“Now that we’ve successfully dug, it’s time to plant!” Demi-Leigh exclaims. On the heels of the difficult seasons of her life, she learned that every setback is rightly seen as an opportunity for growth. “As many times as we get surprised by life’s setbacks or unexpected hardships that seemingly pop up out of nowhere – a global pandemic, a market crash, divorce papers, a bad diagnosis, a backhanded comment from a friend, a flight delay, or a flat tire – when it comes to our circumstances, they don’t surprise Him.” She offers the example of a South African swimming prodigy named Natalie du Toit. By age fourteen, Natalie was winning titles and dreamed of competing in the Olympics. But three years later, her dreams were dashed when she lost her lower left leg in a terrible scooter accident. With a positive attitude, Natalie worked through her devastation, returned to the pool, and four years later, competed in the Paralympics in Athens. Four years after that, she competed in the Beijing Olympics against able-bodied swimmers! “You may not be exactly where you hoped you’d be. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have a purpose exactly where God has planted you,” Demi reminds us. “Whether you feel you’re in a dead-end job or a career lacking purpose, a stay-at-home mom wondering what meaning you can find in the mound of laundry you’re folding, or still single after years of praying for a spouse, stop and look around. You have no idea of what hangs in the balance if you’d just be willing to be used, willing to show up right where God has planted you right now.”\n\nGROW\n\nOn a Wednesday afternoon in June 2017, Demi-Leigh was on her way to an event as Miss South Africa. In bumper-to-bumper traffic, stopped at a light, she noticed three men walking between cars toward hers, and another man doing the same on her right. She hoped they were simply trying to sell trinkets, which is common there, but something told her they had more nefarious plans. Praying the light would change, the man on her right reached her car, and pointed a gun at her head through the windshield. The other three men soon reached the car and surrounded it. Demi-Leigh was terrified. “With a gun aimed at my head and horror stories of similar situations flashing through my mind, I realized I had no choice but to surrender my vehicle and belongings.” She was being carjacked – or worse. When she tried to make a run for it, one of the men grabbed her wrist and growled that she was coming with them. Demi-Leigh punched the man as hard as she could in the throat, startling him just enough to loosen his grip, and ran for her life – in six-inch heels. She desperately knocked on 30-40 car windows as she ran down the street pleading for someone to rescue her. Not a single person was willing … until finally, a young girl veered across four lanes of traffic and asked Demi if she was okay. They sped away, and eventually the girl returned Demi to her event, where the pageant team helped her contact police.\n\nDemi-Leigh suffered acute stress disorder for weeks afterward. With time and therapy, she was able to turn her traumatic experience into a positive, founding the #Unbreakable conferences for women to learn life-saving and empowerment skills. “God used my trauma and turned it into one of my life’s greatest purposes: to fight for those who can’t fight for themselves, being a voice for the voiceless, and empowering women all over the world to break barriers and overcome challenges with confidence.”\n\nFLOURISH\n\nThe only way to flourish in life, Demi believes, is to continue to grow and thrive. “There are two powerful perspectives,” she says, “that help me keep a healthy perspective on what matters most: prioritizing excellence over perfection, and pursuing things that will last!” She shares how the day before her and Tim’s January 2020 wedding in Cape Town, South Africa, a big storm hit. “I’m talking fifty-mile-per-hour winds, six-foot waves thrashing, objects flying, and a torrential downpour. That kind of storm!” About 150 people had flown in from the US for the big day, and they had no backup plans for their outside ceremony. The big day was rocky, too, she explains. “My bridesmaids forgot their flowers, the vintage car that drove my dad and me to the venue broke down about four hundred yards from the venue, the videographer’s drone wouldn’t take off due to the strong winds, and I was certain the wind was going to rip my six-meter-long veil out of my perfect bun. Our wedding day was crazy windy, our guests were freezing, and things went flying all day, but everyone showed up with awesome attitudes to celebrate Tim and me.”\n\nDemi-Leigh says she’s learned that “When you feel you must always be put together and present the perfect version of yourself, you don’t leave any room for the authentic and messy side, which is glorious! An eternal perspective … encourages us ‘to look through’ immediate circumstances and move forward, in light of eternity, knowing that in Christ we have purpose, hope, and ultimately victory because we know how this story ends.”\n\nFor more on Demi Tebow: www.DemiTebow.com\n\n“I just kind of remember thinking, Really, God, like, you're gonna take this from him now, at this pivotal moment in his life,” says Mitzi Byrd, Parker Byrd’s mother.\n\nIn 2022, Parker Byrd was one of the nation’s top high school shortstops. As an eighth grader he committed to play college baseball at Eastern Carolina University, and dreamed of playing in the big leauges.\n\n“He committed when he was 14 years old, he hadn't even played a high school baseball game yet,” says Parker’s Dad, Jeff Byrd. “We didn't know how far he would go in it, but we knew that he was going to play baseball for a very long time.”\n\nBefore he was ever born, Parker’s parents committed to raising him in a Godly home.\n\nJeff: “We prayed so hard for Parker, you know, we had trouble getting pregnant to begin with. And I can just remember, um, praying when I got it. Give us a baby. We will. Always will bring him to you. And we raise him in church, and he would know who you are.”\n\nAs Parker’s high school career ended, he signed full scholarship papers, ready for his future at E.C.U.\n\nJeff: “He did it on home plate. And, you know, surrounded by his family and his teammates and sitting there with his high school baseball hat and his college baseball hat and just thinking about the four years that we waited because he committed so early, it felt like he was committed to ECU forever.”\n\nWill Dawson: Parkers dream of playing high level college baseball was right in front of him. However, just weeks before he stepped onto the ECU campus, something happened that would not only threaten his playing career but change his entire life.\n\nMitzi: “Four teammates went to the river house.”\n\nJeff: “Parker's out on the tube that day, and he had fallen off the tube and he was swimming back to the boat. And when he got close to the boat got put into reverse. And the propeller hit both of his legs and his left hand. But the propeller cut one of his main arteries in his right leg.”\n\nWith his life hanging in the balance, parker was lIfe-flighted to ECU hospital in Greenville.\n\nMitzi: “His girlfriend at the time, um, actually called Jeff and said, ‘Jeff, you have to get to Greenville. There's been an accident. Parker's been ran over by the boat, and I think he's dying.’”\n\nWill Dawson: “I'm sure that there was probably a pit in your stomach when you heard that.”\n\nJeff: “I'm driving so hard down 95 because, you know, I'm like, I got to get there before he dies. And, you know, they're all in the car, like, ‘slow down’. But all I could think about, like, well, if I don't make it? I think the whole way we were just always God to be with him, you know? Please, God save him.”\n\nThe Byrds arrived at the hospital and spoke with Parker’s surgeon. The good news was Parker was alive. The bad news, without an amputation of his right leg, Parker could face infection, kidney and pulmonary failure…possibly death. Jeff and Mitzi mourned their son’s future in baseball, but remembered something greater.\n\nJeff: “I was pretty angry with God. And, you know, he was such a good kid, you know, he never went out, he never caused trouble. He was just a really good kid and this is his reward. I just remember one night just thinking about Jesus hanging on the cross. And that's God’s son. If Jesus can hang on a cross and that's God, son, how can I not expect bad things that have not happened to us. And, you know, that was the moment I realized whatever God's plan is, we're gonna share glory and hope in it.”\n\nParker: “I just want to keep living. He came in very early that morning today, like we continue on this medicine that we have right now and which isn't working at all and you will end up dying or we can amputate your right lower extremity. And I was like, ‘Hey, I want to keep living life. Definitely a lot of questions because your like, ‘God, why am I here? What are you doing?’ But eventually His plans are always greater than yours.’”\n\nParker endured twenty-two surgeries and extensive rehab, learning to walk with a prosthetic. Parker’s goal, though ambitious, was to make a comeback and play college baseball.\n\nJeff: “As soon as he came home from the hospital the very next day, he said, ‘Can we go to the batting cage?’ We just go to the batting cage and he sits there with a bat on his shoulder in a wheelchair and watches balls go by. Eventually he got to a walker and this goes on for weeks and then months, he gets better. He's now on crutches and four months after his amputation, he gets fitted for a prosthetic. And of course, that night we go to the batting cage for the first time with two legs again. It was almost like watching them all for the very first time as a baby. You know, your just so proud.”\n\nOn February 16th this year, just nineteen months after losing his leg, Parker became the first division one college baseball player to play a game with a prosthetic leg. A moment, his family will never forget.\n\nJeff: “I just burst into tears, like you could just see from the very first time he sat in a wheelchair to that moment running to first base that no one ever thought he was going to walk again. To see him walk to first base…It was a miracle.”\n\nParker: “I mean, it was just a powerful moment. Just to prove people that I'm still here. I'm still Parker. I'm still a baseball player. Just, even though difficult things happen in life and adversity hits you doesn't mean just to give up cause if you just continue to work hard then His plan is greater than ours.”\n\nMitzi: “First of all, God never leaves us. He's always with us. Even when you feel that he's not there and you feel, he's still there, he's still working. He's carrying you through it.”\n\nParker: “I realize that His plan is greater than mine because I thought I had my whole life planned out, go to college and go to MLB and just be a great baseball player. But life's so much bigger than just baseball. God's always there, that even in your darkest times or in the valley that he's still working, You may not see it at the time and it may be very foggy to you at the time, but His mercy is still there, that he still has a plan for you, that He's giving you that trial just so you can lean closer to Him.”\n\nBetty says, “The whole room was spinning. I was so dizzy, but is started causing me to have nausea, so I almost threw up.” Betty Cusack was praying when the vertigo hit. Lying down only made it worse. Betty recalls, “The nausea and the dizziness. It came on very very strong. Never have I felt that kind of nausea and dizziness before. With vertigo, you can't just get up. You are so dizzy, you're so disoriented.”\n\nWhen she woke up the next morning, the nausea had passed, but she still felt dizzy. Betty remembers, “I had to carry a laundry container in one hand and hold onto the railing with the other hand and make sure I walk slowly because my balance was not a hundred percent. So I'd pick up something, bend over, turn, all of a sudden I'd feel dizzy.”\n\nWith Thanksgiving in a week, Betty thought she wouldn’t be able to get everything ready for the holiday and enjoy the time with her daughter who was coming from out of town.\n\nBetty shares, “I was contemplating on canceling our Thanksgiving get together. But I hadn't seen my daughter for a whole year and I thought, I'm just gonna pray and let God allow me to have the strength to do what I needed to do.”\n\nInstead of going to see the doctor Betty prayed. She also sent in an on-line prayer request to CBN. Betty says, “I felt the power of that prayer lift a lot of that weightiness of that dizziness from me.”\n\nDespite occasional bouts of dizziness, Betty managed to prepare Thanksgiving dinner for her family. Betty recalls, “And even though I was lightheaded, I was able to get around. As long as I didn't turn too fast or bend over and get up too fast, the Lord gave me the strength and I was able to spend time with my family.”\n\nThe next day, Betty, a longtime CBN partner and 700 Club viewer was watching the show when Andrew Knox gave a word of knowledge.\n\nAndrew Knox shares, “Someone's been battling dizziness. In fact, you're sitting watching this program because you need to sit, because when you walk, you need to put your hand on furniture to stabilize yourself and that dizziness is gonna go away now in the name of Jesus. God wants to do something mighty in your life. Thank you, Lord!”\n\nBetty remembers, “So I thought, wait, that's, that's me. I was so excited. So, I stood up and say, 'thank you Lord.' I'm going to receive it in Jesus' name. And all of a sudden, I started feeling just slightly better. And I thought, well, I just won the lottery. I can't believe this. I was so blessed when I could, I just lift my hands to the Lord and say, ‘thank you Lord Jesus, because you saw my situation. You had mercy.’”\n\nThe next day, Betty no longer felt any symptoms of vertigo.\n\nBetty says, “I was feeling so much better. All of a sudden, I didn't need to balance myself. I didn't feel lightheaded. I was fine. I was back to normal.”\n\nBetty encourages others to believe that with God all things are possible.\n\nBetty shares, “And hearing my testimony and thinking it’s not going to happen to you. Maybe it happened to me because I am somebody special. But no way. I'm no special than anybody else. But it was my faith in the Lord Jesus. I was waiting for a miracle. And he just honored that. And he just came through. He's always someone that you can trust.”"
