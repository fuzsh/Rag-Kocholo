        "text": "TNT Renews Cold Justice for Season 3\n\nJustice will be served. Again. And it will be cold! TNT ordered a third season of&nbsp;Cold Justice&nbsp;on Wednesday, meaning criminals who think they got away with their wrongdoing had better watch out (or at least make sure they're presentable for television).\n\nTNT Announces Summer Premiere Dates for Rizzoli & Isles, Murder in the First and More\n\nTNT has announced the premieres for its summer shows, including&nbsp;Rizzoli &amp; Isles,&nbsp;Dallas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Franklin &amp; Bash. The network also revealed the series premiere date of&nbsp;Murder in the First, a new crime drama from Emmy winner&nbsp;Steven Bochco&nbsp;that stars&nbsp;Taye Diggs,&nbsp;Kathleen Robertson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tom Felton.\n\nTNT Renews Cold Justice for Season 2\n\nCold Justice has been renewed for a second season, TNT announced Tuesday. The docu-drama follows former prosecutor Kelly Siegler and former crime-scene investigator Yolanda McClary as they solve small-town murder cases...\n\nLaw & Order Producer Dick Wolf Enters True Crime Territory with Cold Justice\n\nThere's a new crime-fighting duo coming to prime time this fall, but the cases they're investigating have been dormant for years and sometimes even decades. On TNT's&nbsp;Cold Justice&nbsp;(premiering&nbsp;Tuesday&nbsp;at 10/9c), the latest endeavor from&nbsp;Law &amp; Order&nbsp;creator&nbsp;Dick Wolf, prosecutor&nbsp;Kelly Siegler&nbsp;and crime scene investigator Yolanda McClary&nbsp;team up to reopen unsolved small-town cases that have gone \"cold\" despite the best efforts of local law enforcement."
