        "text": "If you looked at the finances of the broadcast TV networks, you might not be optimistic about the future of free TV.\n\nEach year, ABC, NBC and Fox contribute a smaller share of the profits reaped by their parent companies. Meanwhile cable channels boost viewership and get growing chunks of the advertising pie. No wonder a cable company is about to scoop up NBC -- largely because it owns cable channels, which also deliver a stream of revenue from subscription fees.\n\nSo why are the TV networks spending tens of millions of dollars more on prime-time dramas and comedies for next season than they did in the last season? What's in it for the companies, when even Fox, No. 1 among viewers in the key demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds, eked out just 3 percent of the total operating profit reported by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in the last quarter?\n\nAn analysis of the broadcast business suggests a few answers:\n\nSpending money on new programs helps sister divisions such as TV production studios, which will own the rights to shows in perpetuity and can sell them in other countries, to other channels and on home video.\n\nThat's partly why NBC is investing 40 percent more on new shows this year than in the 2009-10 season and backtracked from its move last year to replace new shows with a daily dose of Jay Leno at 10 p.m. Its 13 new shows are more than double what it made last year. Six will be produced by sibling Universal Media Studios, such as the Indian call center comedy \"Outsourced\" and the apocalyptic thriller \"The Event.\"\n\nIt's partly history and partly economics, but cable networks anchor their programming with reruns of shows that were once broadcast. That helps fill their 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week schedule.\n\n\"If you look at USA Network, it's driven by 'House'; if you look at Turner (TNT), it's driven by 'Law & Order,'\" said Bruce Rosenblum, president of the Warner Bros. Television Group, which makes shows for all the networks.\n\nMega-hits like \"CSI\" or \"Lost\" can be sold around the world and generate hundreds of millions of dollars in licensing fees for reruns. A failed show might have cost $1 million-plus per episode to produce, but much of that cost is covered by advertising revenue.\n\nNBC's failed gamble of putting Leno at 10 p.m. last year shows why this kind of spending is a must.\n\nTV stations used to give their signals away for free to cable, satellite and telecommunications companies in exchange for their agreeing to carry new cable channels under the same corporate umbrella. For example, News Corp. let cable companies show Fox network broadcasts if the cable providers also took the FX channel. NBC Universal did the same thing to get Oxygen, MSNBC and CNBC on the tube.\n\nNow, broadcast TV stations are demanding to be paid licensing fees to \"retransmit\" their signals. The negotiations are getting intense: ABC briefly blacked out the Academy Awards to Cablevision Systems Corp. subscribers in March."
