        "text": "One could call veteran NBC Nightly News correspondent Kate Snow “relentless” when it comes to trying to make the world a better place.\n\nSnow ascended from local news to the highest ranks of network television news — as a correspondent at CNN, ABC and NBC. And, her whole career, at least one of her priorities remained constant: A dedication to highlighting issues and stories that matter to everyday Americans, like suicide prevention.\n\nAnd with her new show, “Relentless With Kate Snow,” premiering on Oct. 4, Snow will profile incredible people who have suffered unimaginable losses due to crime, who pushed for justice for themselves, then others.\n\nSnow has made a name for herself as an anchor and White House correspondent at ABC, Congressional correspondent for CNN and, currently, the Sunday anchor for the NBC Nightly News. She has covered five presidential elections and interviewed everyone from former President Barack Obama to Ringo Starr, according to NBC.\n\nHer crowning achievements in broadcast journalism have been deeply reported, important stories that make an impact in the world, NBC explained. She has broken news with firsthand interviews on the Bill Cosby sexual assault case, transgender children and the opioid crisis, as well as the epidemic of concussions among young female soccer players.\n\nSnow won an Emmy Award this year for her exclusive sit-down with Andrea Constand, who broke her 13-year silence after she was drugged and sexually assaulted by Cosby, in a case that led to his conviction.\n\nSince her father-in-law’s death by suicide almost 10 years ago, Snow has worked with the American Society For Suicide Prevention, hosting an awards gala for the organization and being honored with its award for responsible reporting on suicide and sharing important stories.\n\nIn a personal column written for NBC in 2018, Snow reflected on her father-in-law’s death, recalling the terrifying moment when her husband got the call — the couple was preparing to host a Christmas party at the time — and the lessons she learned after that day.\n\n“We can’t blame ourselves for missing signs or not saying enough,” Snow wrote. “What we can do is talk about it — out loud, in public — and hope we can somehow help other families and help someone else avoid that horrible phone call.”\n\nSnow grew up in a small town in upstate New York called Burnt Hills, and earned her undergrad at Cornell University. She later graduated Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service with a Master’s in international affairs. Her career in the public eye, however, began in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she spent three years as a reporter and anchor for local station KOAT-TV. There in Albuquerque, as a transplant looking to get to know her community, she decided to become a part of the city’s fabric by volunteering with Big Brothers Big Sisters.\n\nShe would follow her Little Sister’s progress for years to come, even as Snow continued to gain prominence in the television news world.\n\n“It started out with me mentoring her mostly, but I’ve always learned from her, even in the beginning, when she was little,” Snow told BBBSA.\n\nWhen she gained a larger platform, Snow, who also hosted BBBSA’s National Awards Gala 10 times, used her position as one of the faces of the news to help boost awareness of the organization. She helped promote a BBBSA-created police mentoring program called “Bigs in Blue,” that was designed to strengthen bonds between officers and the communities they police.\n\nBBBSA honored Snow — who now sits on the organization’s national board, as well as that of BBBS of New York City — in 2017 with the Charles G. Berwind Lifetime Achievement Award at the organization’s annual gala. When Snow accepted the award, her Little was in her 20s.\n\nSnow has been married to Chris Bro for 20 years, with whom she has two children — Zack and Abby.\n\nWhen “Relentless” premieres on Friday, Oct. 4, at 8 p.m. ET/PT, join Snow for powerful, handpicked stories of women who turned unthinkable tragedies into empowerment and advocacy, and learn more about the good work being done by some of them to this day here at Oxygen.com."
