USA Network (commonly referred to simply as USA stylized as usa network since 2005) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by the NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group division of NBCUniversal, itself a subsidiary of Comcast. Once a minor player in basic cable, the network has steadily gained popularity due to its original programming; USA also broadcasts syndicated reruns of current and former "network television" (i.e., broadcast) series and theatrically-released feature films, as well as limited sports programming and WWE.
