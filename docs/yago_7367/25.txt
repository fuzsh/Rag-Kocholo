Deuda is a great (art)documentary explaining the origin of the Argentina debt (although not absolutely since many things are uncertain)

The direction is truly amazing, I never saw an Argentinian production with so much variety in a film.

The only problem I saw was the pacing, it was not right. The edition confuses at some moments since they put scenes with people who do not have direct relation with the people to who they are being spoken.

Leaving that flaw, I really liked this movie. Even if you expect some kind of Michael Moore wannabe movie, this movie is interesting and you will learn what really happens to us, the Argentineans.

The guilty are those people who manipulates us from the North or us ?

*****/***** (5 stars) A must see
