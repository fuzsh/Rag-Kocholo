        "text": "Gustavo Fontán’s films are defined by the way they restore sensitive experience from the utilitarian, functional mode in which the world is inhabited. His most narrative movies, such as LA DEUDA, also exhibit the same general poetic principle as the rest of his work – the visible (and aural) reorganization of the world. Here, the plot is reduced to a clerk who has to return a wad of bills, a significant amount of money (because she perhaps “borrowed” it), to a client in less than 24 hours. This sets a series of visits and journeys in motion – through an unknown, nocturnal Buenos Aires – which find their culmination at dawn in a passage in which the film reflects the main meaning of its title: In the neverending progression of time, workers will never get to rest because they will forever live in debt. This sublime closing sequence is preceded by the protagonist passing through a casino filmed as a temple of those in despair and the anticipation generated by the previous shots, where we see a desolate, soulless Buenos Aires. Whether the young woman who stars in the film manages to get the money or not is the least relevant issue here, because by that point it’s already clear that money is society’s only symbolic organizer. (Roger Koza)\n\nIn the presence of Belén Blanco."
