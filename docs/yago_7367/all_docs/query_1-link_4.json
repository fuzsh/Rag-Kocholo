But when his father's debts catch up with them, they are given an ultimatum: payment in full, or The Collectors take Isabel, and turn her into birria (goat stew). As the situation escalates, Victor comes of age – for better or worse – in his quest to save Isabel's life.\n\nThis screening is sponsored by HBO, FlixLatino and ViendoMovies Available with Xfinity."
