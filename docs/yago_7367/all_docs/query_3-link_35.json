The episode struck a personal chord with me. Transitioning from a corporate role, where I served as a Senior Lecturer in FIITJEE, to the creative industry without any prior connections was a leap of faith. This series remind us that embracing risks and pursuing our passions can lead to profoundly fulfilling outcomes. Let’s dissect EP01 from Screenplay Perspective. There are 2 Protagonists here - Prashant and Jimmy as they navigate between the cut-throat world of Delhi's real estate and the world of their dreams. Act 1 - Setup - We Introduce the Protagonist to the Audience, shedding light on his 1-2 characteristics and his Want. The threat of being thrown out of the job looming large, Prashant, an honest soul torn between theater and sales, faces a test of character as he juggles between his job of a salesperson and his Drama class where he has been offered the lead role. INCITING INCIDENT - Something that disturbs the equilibrium of the Protagonist. Guruji warns him that if he does not come by 7 PM to the Theatre Practice, he would lose his lead role. PLOT POINT 1 - Act 1 Ends with the Goal of the Protagonist - Prashant has to ask his Boss to relieve him by 6:30 PM. ACT 2 Starts - The Protagonist goes on a journey. We as Screenwriters will throw problems in his path. Prashant musters the courage and asks his asshole Boss for help. The Boss as expectedly refuses from entertaining his request. ( NOTE: The dialogue here is really good as the Boss explains Prashant through a story of a Wife and Timepass. We Indians love listening to stories and is a tried and tested way to explain our POV. ) Prashant is in a fix. What will the Protagonist do now ? - Prashant goes to show a Flat to a couple but beyond his wildest nightmares, he ends up getting tricked by the clients. The couple just needed a Flat to have sex. Prashant is severely embarrassed by the situation. In Act 2 - The Protagonist thinks of doing A but B happens. He then does C but D happens. This continues until... ACT 2 End - Lowest point of the Protagonist. - Prashant gets slapped by a Resident. He falls down. The pain in his eyes conveying - Did I deserve this? (In metaphorical sense, the society leaves no stone unturned to pin you down.) ACT 3 - Resolution - Prashant escapes Police arrest as the couple accept their mistake. The Boss labels him as a dimwit and assures him that the next day, he will poke fun at him infront of the entire office. Main Resolution - Prashant remisces his childhood Flashback - The teacher played by Naveen kasturia motivates the little Prashant to never give up on his dreams. The Music builds as Prashant speaks to himself in the Mirror - I will be the best actor and Damn! Pure Goosebumps!! Thank You for reading. Will discuss on Jimmy in the next post. #writer #sapnevseveryone #tvf #ambrishverma #timeliners #webseries #YouTube\n\n🔎📺 Looking for some series to watch to practice a bit of English? Here are my top 3 recommendations of this month 💡 ⚡ FROM I started watching this after hearing that Stephen King couldn't stop watching it, and now I can't either. This show is about different people who get stuck in the same town and cannot find a way out. It's similar to Lost in that sense; you have no idea how or why they got there, they have no clue where they are and every time they try to leave, they end up in the same place as if they were just running in circles. SUUUUUPER intriguing. But wait! There's another plus for horror fans: not only are these people stuck in this weird town, but there are also some 'monsters' who look like humans and they'll eat you alive if they find you after sunset. If you're looking for something entertaining and suspensful, this is for you. Two seasons so far, third one coming in 2024. 🤙 watch here the trailer: https://lnkd.in/dxHGWKFX ⚡ DOPESICK This is a limited series, great if you are looking for something to watch without having to wait for further seasons to come. Amazing starring performance from Michael Keaton. This incredible series introduces you to the sick business of medicine. The dark side of taking pills. Ever heard of 'Oxy'? You may have heard of it on some other shows like Euphoria or even on the news. Well, DOPESICK is a series based on the real case of how a big-ass pharmaceutical company created a drug which turned thousands of people into drug addicts. Yup, based on the REAL events of how OxyContin appeared in the market, you'll witness the dreadful business that lies behind medicine. I've recommended this show to plenty of people and none of them were disappointed. 🤙 watch trailer here: https://lnkd.in/dYAFh_tX ⚡ HEARTSTOPPER Cute, sweet, romantic. These are the three best adjectives to describe this show. If you're looking for something more 'chill' and teenage-like, this one is for you. Heartstopper is based on the bestseller LGTBQ+ novel which narrates the story of a gay boy who falls in love at school. It's really nice to watch it with teenagers/young adults since there are some interesting things to highlight, going from a love story to how teenagers' cruelty can mess you up. Another plus for you: British accent, which is just so nice to listen to. Season 2 has recently been released, and they have confirmed two more seasons to come. Good to feel young again while watching this. 🤙 watch trailer here: https://lnkd.in/dT4kCVXs Hope you watch any of these and practice some English! 🤸♀️ Remember that watching movies/series and listening to songs/podcasts is always good for your brain and learning process 😎 Do you have any recommendations for me? 😽\n\nDo or did you have a stammer growing up? Known as a stutter in the US, Emily Blunt and actor Andrew Scott grew up with one. So did Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson. Andrew Scott's mother sent him to drama to help. Emily Blunt found it helpful too. Inhabiting a role helps. In the Women's Hour episode on 28 November, you can hear two people with stammers being interviewed. As I heard that interview on BBC Sounds on my lunchtime dog walk, one young woman described it as her super power. Good for her! But having listened to both of them talk about the anxiety of having to communicate from an early age and the impact on their whole selves, I wondered. Not everyone with a speech impediment or learning difficulty embraces this reframing. As audiences, we struggle too. There is so much to learn about how to show up for other people. The best takeaway? WAIT! Don't try to finish the sentence of a stutterer. Just wait. Maintain kind eye contact if you can, and be patient. What do you struggle with and what can your audience do to help? It was delightful to have a coffee with fellow professional, Susannah Stobart yesterday and catch up about this and all things speech, empowerment, competence and communication related. Susannah is a Speech and Language Therapist and I'm a Voice and Speech Coach. Depending what you want to accomplish, you may wish to speak to one of us at some stage. We're also happy to do a Discovery Call if you're not sure what you need, and to refer each other if you need us to help you figure that out. #stammering #stutteringawareness #effectivecommunication #audienceengagement https://lnkd.in/eDx3eFY7\n\nJust received a Blacklist Evaluation for our 2nd \"Rebels\" Episode titled, \"REBELS: THE FIRST TEENAGE IDOLS\" Era: 1950s Genre: Drama, Period Drama, Coming-of-Age, Romance Logline: In the 1950s, future teen idols James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo stake the first steps on their paths to stardom while grappling with the dark corners of Hollywood, and those who prey on their youthful beauty, including controlling parents, poverty and sexual abuse. STRENGTHS The strengths of REBELS stem from three-dimensional characters with organically constructed goals and obstacles that contribute to high personal stakes and are anchored by beautifully authentic period piece detail that captures the big dreams and dark corners of Hollywood in the 1950s. James Dean's UCLA fraternity story and Sal's military school story are particularly poignant in setting up these characters and what they are fighting against in their personal and professional dreams. This pilot convincingly portrays the edge of poverty and abusive parents that propelled so many of Hollywood's biggest stars, which grounds these iconic personalities in relatable, emotionally visceral circumstances. These stories at UCLA, the military academy, and Jimmy's farm also nicely broaden the world outside the Hollywood rat race, allowing the characters to feel like three-dimensional people and not just beautiful hamsters on a devastating wheel. The period detail of this script is particularly stunning, from the Pepsi commercials to the military school's homophobia and a girl growing up and cutting off her pigtails, even audiences who never experienced this period feel like they live there with the characters. PROSPECTS REBELS is an exciting period concept in the vein of HOLLYWOOD and WHY WOMEN KILL that, with further development, will attract producers and executives alike. The roles of James Dean and Natalie Wood are developed with enough emotional hardship to attract rising A-list talent and the role of Sal Mineo is a star-vehicle-perfect role for an up-and-coming queer actor. While the series takes place in the 1950s, the drama is steeped in interpersonal relationships, so the series could be creatively shot on a low budget in Los Angeles. If significant talent attached itself, it would go a long way to finding the show a home, and therefore financing. Once produced, the show could pop on a young female-skewing streamer like Freeform, MAX, or Peacock.\n\nBy BBC Culture 23rd November 2023 As the British sci-fi show turns 60, the question of which actor has been the best in the role of the time-travelling hero has never been more contested. Here five Doctor Who experts give their verdicts. T Today, Doctor Who celebrates its 60th birthday – a truly astonishing achievement for a TV series. And in that time, no less than 13 actors have played the time-travelling Doctor, with Ncuti Gatwa set to become the 14th when he takes over at Christmas (although he will officially be known as the Fifteenth Doctor, as one actor, David Tennant, has now played two separate incarnations of the Doctor). More like this: – A beginner's guide to Doctor Who – Why Doctor Who is the ultimate British show – Doctor Who's most stylish Doctors In honour of this great day, we decided to ask a selection of Doctor Who experts a very tricky question: who is the greatest Doctor of them all? Here were their answers, which make for perfect fuel for continuing the debate in your own home. (Credit: BBC) (Credit: BBC) Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor (1974-1981) A Saturday night, April 1975. A man with a shock of tumbling curls and a colossal multi-coloured, striped scarf holds in his hands two wires. Touch them together and the greatest evil ever visited on the universe will never come to be. But the man's expression is of impossible torment. \"Simply touch one wire against the other, and that's it, the Daleks cease to exist,\" breathes the Fourth Doctor. \"Do I have that right?\" No-one who saw this electrifying scene in episode 5 of Genesis Of The Daleks has ever forgotten it. It's not just a pivotal moment in this time-travel saga, it is the time-travel story, the ultimate moral question: could you kill the infant Hitler? And it works chiefly because it's delivered by an actor whose outsize charisma and burning moral intensity – and, elsewhere, absurdist levity – were powerful enough to remake entirely everyone's idea of who and what the Doctor is. For decades afterwards, when comedians or cartoonists spoofed Doctor Who it was the fourth incarnation, Tom Baker, that they were doing, with his scarves, hats, Jelly Babies, and robot dog K-9. The longest-running Doctor, with seven years' Tardis-time, Baker made himself the definitive article. https://lnkd.in/dZVRN-Qa\n\nLooking for an agent... What makes ABOUT I DO unique is not the storyline. Yes, it is hilarious! Award winning actors have gone out of their way to personally compliment the writing. Yes, it’s about multi-generational relationships that are complicated, timely, and filled with angst. Loyalty, Family, Trust, Wisdom, Heritage, Romance—check! Betrayal, Adventure, Danger, Suspense, Mystery, (even a car chase), Rescue, Love—check! A surprise ending out of nowhere that will make you cry—Of Course. But what makes ABOUT I DO unique deals with the conventional Three Act Story Structure. At the end of Act Two there is generally a lull where the audience can go for refreshments or wait for the ultimate, anticipated resolution and climax. ABOUT I DO doesn’t allow that to happen. ABOUT I DO has two major story lines and a half dozen mini-conflicts between bridesmaids, groomsmen, parents and even Reverend Tony. The primary story pits the two lovers, William and Tiffany/Bride and Groom against social norms and what they expect from each other. The story follows a traditional path with a lot more awkward moments than you would expect. It checks all the boxes and has a wonderful ending. But the sleeper story is about Grampa Fred and Grammy Hazel. They are the real stars of the show. It’s the reason Ed Asner called me up ten years ago while I was mowing my lawn to tell me I had to expand his character’s story before he could take it. The foundation for the second story line takes place early on in the first act and develops slowly through antidotal stories by Grammy Hazel. In the middle of the Second Act—at the height of the drama when Tiffany is about to be swept out to sea in her wedding gown by a rip current—she reveals the second story line as she flashes back to her first meeting with William at his Grandfather’s Wake. (Grampa Fred was blown out to sea after Grammy Hazel took him skydiving on Valentine’s Day.) As the rescue ensues, the lover’s reunite, the bedraggled wedding party almost get arrested on the way back, and Grampa Fred’s story evolves, locking the audience in their seats. In the end, ABOUT I DO become not just another Romantic Comedy… but a STORY. The audience goes in expecting popcorn and is delighted when it includes steak, lobster and a vintage wine. Please request the screenplay. I am looking for representation. William R. Eastman III muchadoproductions@outlook.com\n\nThe three-part Netflix documentary about this case is definitely worth watching. The stunning case of Denise Huskins, of Mare Island, whose kidnapping and sexual assault was dismissed as a hoax is shocking- especially because it occurred in an environment where there had been several reports of a man peeking into windows of residences at night. What's more, some residents had observed him, followed him home, and identified the \"Mare Island Creeper\" as a White, male, individual who was ex-military, and an attorney. You can't get more specific than that with regards to describing Matthew Muller without actually naming him. If something had been done at the time it could have possibly prevented Denise (who indicated in the documentary that she had been the victim of two prior sexual assaults) from being kidnapped and sexually assaulted by Muller. But sadly people often dismiss Peeping Tom incidents, even when they occur in broad daylight. l know first hand how traumatizing an encounter with a Peeping Tom can be, after having a male security guard unlock a locked bathroom at my previous job, and attempt to take a photo of me. I also know that a person who is deviant enough to do something like that in the middle of the day, with multiple people nearby, has probably done it before, and is probably still doing the same thing, if not worse to other women. What was really disappointing was the response from my supervisor (who was also a female) and those who were supposed to investigate the incident--which I reported immediately. Even more disappointing was the response from the Vice President of my former HR Department (another female) when I asked for a copy of the written report. She told me, she was not going to provide me a copy because I was no longer an employee with the organization. My belief is that she couldn't provide the report because the Director of my department (yet another female) did not actually do her job and create a writing copy of my complaint at the time. While Muller was an attorney who probably had his own office one wonders what his behavior was like while he was at Harvard, and in work environments where he had access to potentially stalk women in broad daylight, and nothing was done. https://lnkd.in/gMaZCjUR"
