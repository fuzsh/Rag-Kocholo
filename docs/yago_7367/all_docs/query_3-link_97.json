        "text": "Director Woody Allen has weighed in on the #MeToo movement, saying he should be its “poster boy.”\n\nIn an extensive interview with Jorge Lanata, reporter for Argentina’s Periodismo Para Todos, Allen spoke at length about his support for the larger movement, sparked in part by investigative journalism done by son Ronan Farrow.\n\n“Everyone wants justice to be done,” Allen said. “If there is something like the Me Too movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that’s a good thing.”\n\nAllen touted his own history working with women, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes on his films, with nary an untoward accusation while suggesting he “should be the poster boy for the Me Too movement.”\n\n“I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses, hundreds, and not a single one — big ones, famous ones, ones starting out — have ever, ever, not a single one, have ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them,” he said.\n\nThe director did have reservations on some aspects of the movement, however.\n\n“I think in any situation where anyone is accused of something unjustly, this is a sad thing,” he remarked. “I think everybody would agree with that.”\n\nAllen included himself in the falsely accused category.\n\n“What bothers me is that I get linked with [harassers]. People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse and abuse and abuse — and I, who was only accused by one woman in a child custody case which was looked at and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people,” he said.\n\nAs for adopted daughter Dylan Farrow’s accusations that Allen sexually abused her at age seven, the director continues to categorically deny any misconduct.\n\n“This is just so crazy. This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue. And that was the end and I’ve gone on with my life and now, for it to come back now, my God. It’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of,” Allen said."
