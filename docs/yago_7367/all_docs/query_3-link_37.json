        "text": "Página 12 is a national current affairs newspaper edited in the city of Buenos Aires. Its editorial line opposes Mauricio Macri’s administration.\n\nIt belongs to Editorial La Página S.A., founded in 1987 by businessman Fernando Sokolowicz and purchased by Grupo Octubre in 2016. Jorge Prim and Hugo Sorian, members of the newspaper’s board of directors, are minority shareholders of the company.\n\nAt the beginning, the newspaper was managed by Jorge Lanata, who had been Editor-In-Chief of magazine El Porteño, and by Ernesto Tiffenberg.\n\nSokolowicz acknowledged that, at the beginning, the newspaper received funds from former members of armed group Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP), who had created political party Movimiento Todos por la Patria (MTP) in 1980.\n\nIn 1994 Lanata left Página 12. He resigned when Sokolowicz signed an agreement with Página 12’s main competitor, Clarín, to get funding. Tiffenberg remained as Editor-In-Chief until 2018.\n\nDuring Carlos Menem’s administration (1989–1999), the newspaper consolidated as a model of investigative journalism, thus becoming the third broadest circulation newspaper in Argentina, after Clarín and La Nacion.\n\nSince 2003, the newspaper’s editorial line has supported Néstor Kirchner’s and Cristina Fernández’s administrations, and was among the newspapers that received more official advertising.\n\nOne of the main journalists of the newspaper was Horacio Verbitsky. He wrote for Página 12 from its foundation to 2017, when one of his articles annoyed the Argentinian Government and he decided to leave the newspaper under political pressure."
