        "text": "Woody Allen said he should be the face of the #MeToo movement because he believes he's a shining example of how to behave in Hollywood.\n\nIn a new interview with Argentina's Channel 13 on Sunday, the 82-year-old film director revealed that he wholeheartedly supported the campaign -- an international movement against sexual sexual harassment and assault -- and would be a great asset because he's never once acted inappropriately towards actresses he's worked with.\n\n\"I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement because I have worked in movies for 50 years,\" Allen told Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata. \"I've worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one -- big ones, famous ones, ones starting out -- have ever, ever, suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I've always had a wonderful record with them.\"\n\nHis claims ring true for leading ladies such as Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johansson and, most recently, Pen√©lope Cruz, who have all said that Allen was always a consummate professional around them.\n\nMore recently, Cruz -- who won an Oscar after starring in Allen's 2008 film Vicky Cristina Barcelona -- spoke out on the long-standing sexual abuse allegations made against Allen by his daughter Dylan Farrow, saying that it's a case that needs to be trialled in the courts, not by the public.\n\n\"We're supposed to believe in justice, and this was looked at years ago, and it's not clear. It should be looked at again, and then I can give an answer,\" Cruz told Vanity Fair on whether she'd work with Allen again.\n\nMeanwhile, Australian actress Cate Blanchett said that she had no idea about the allegations when she worked with Allen on his 2013 comedy drama Blue Jasmine, which won her a Best Actress Oscar.\n\n\"I don't think I've stayed silent at all,\" Blanchett told The Guardian in March. \"At the time that I worked with Woody Allen, I knew nothing of the allegations. At the time, I said it's a very painful and complicated situation for the family, which I hope they have the ability to resolve.\"\n\nHis daughter Farrow, 32 -- who he shares with 73-year-old actress Mia Farrow -- would be the first one who'd love to see the case revisited. She has long claimed that her father Allen had molested her in 1992 when she was just 7 years old, allegations he has vehemently denied. And although the famed director was investigated, he was not charged.\n\nIn his interview with Channel 13, Allen expressed his frustration over being grouped with Hollywood's \"terrible accusers\" such as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and Kevin Spacey, who in the past year have been accused of sexual harassment.\n\n\"What bothers me is that I get linked in with them,\" said Allen. \"People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse, and abuse, and abuse, and I, who was only accused by one woman, in a child custody case, which was looked at, and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people.\n\n\"This [case with Farrow] has something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue,\" he added. \"And that was the end and I've gone on with my life.\""
