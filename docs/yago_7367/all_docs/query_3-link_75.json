        "text": "After it was recently revealed that football agent, model and presenter Wanda Nara had been admitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires for something 'serious', it is now being said that Mauro Icardi's partner has leukemia.\n\nJorge Lanata, on his Radio Mitre show, claims that several sources close to Wanda Nara confirmed to him that she is suffering from leukemia.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Nara was taken to a medical centre after feeling a severe pain in her stomach. After that, doctors decided that the best thing to do was to admit her so that she could undergo all the necessary tests, including an analysis that, according to Argentine media, said that it did not yield bad news.\n\nThen, on Friday, local media reported that Wanda Nara had been transferred to the Sanatorio de Los Arcos, in Buenos Aires. After that, she has been checked by the medical staff in order to find and diagnose the ailment that her loved ones have shown their concern about.\n\nMauro Icardi wants to fly Wanda to Italy\n\nLanata also claims that, since finding out the horrible news of Nara's alleged leukaemia diagnosis, her partner Mauro Icardi wants to fly her to Italy for treatment.\n\nIcardi has played the majority of his football in Italy, and it is where he and Nara spent most of their relationship, a country in which they feel most at home.\n\nThe striker is currently on the verge of a permanent move to Galatasaray in Turkey, but it seems he wants to take his partner to Italy as it is a more familiar environment.\n\nAlso according to Lanata, Wanda had just finished filming a MasterChef episode and was set to travel to Ibiza to meet up with her sister Zaira and her mother Nora Colosimo, but the shocking diagnosis has changed their plans."
