I learned a great deal from Vladimir’s study of the Antamina transnational mining project, with which he completed his doctoral degree in anthropology at Yale University. This publication should be required reading for those interested in the neoliberal transformation of countries like Peru. From colonial times up until the present day, mineral extraction has marked the country in an unequal relationship with the metropolises that consume our metals. Mining has always been notorious for its abusive labor practices and the contamination of its surroundings. This new phase of extraction is associated with the globalization of capital investments tied to financial circuits and adjustments in relations with governmental regimes, as well as contradictory oversight and control mechanisms. For these reasons, the case of the Antamina megaproject in Ancash is very illuminating. The World Bank guaranteed the investment, conditioned on fulfillment of its own requirements in regard to the treatment of affected populations. It also demanded that the company comply with restrictions imposed by new environmental impact–evaluation processes. The emergence of the multinational Antamina marked a turning point in the shift to privatization of Peruvian mining and the return of foreign investment.\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

What stands out in Vladimir’s study is how this whole process is a long path of learning for all the parties involved. With admirable meticulousness, the author recounts the interests of the actors from different perspectives. There is the company, in conjunction and contradiction with different branches of the state and globalized civil society; the indirect beneficiaries, and also those who wish to benefit but are unable to; and of course, the perspective of the victims. The main point of the book is how these parties in conflict manage to compromise in spite of having very different values and goals. We see the environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) convincing Antamina’s financiers to transport the ore by pipeline instead of crossing roughshod with hundreds of trucks through Huascarán National Park. But the fact that the apparent conflict was mitigated and that all parties negotiated does not necessarily mean that everyone is content. Using political ecological approaches combined with tools from cultural anthropology, this study observes how parties negotiate under asymmetrical conditions, and how incommensurable values can be reconciled. The reader will see how complicated it is to understand such bandied-about concepts as the “development” that mining could bring to a region, and whether it is true that “Antamina contaminates.” Different discursive registers are used, contrary feelings are mobilized, and support is recruited from local, national, and international sectors in complicated strategies, all of them minutely documented in this book. Antamina presents itself as a responsible company, and for that reason the study is extremely valuable in recording the company’s often pompous statements. These are assessed in a measured way, together with the loud protests of those claiming to be victims or to have been deceived. The author carefully avoids winning applause from any of the parties, and, without neglecting to criticize where he should, he brings us a book that deserves to be praised for its rigor and balance. The main lesson, I repeat, has been to document how, in the process of becoming established, all parties have learned a great deal from their faults and errors, as well as their respective achievements, availing themselves of diverse strategies. And the learning—although not yet accompanied by a better and more just redistribution of benefits from the mine—also includes\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R.. Fighting for Andean Resources : Extractive Industries, Cultural Politics, and Environmental Struggles in\n\nFOREWORD\n\nxiii\n\nsteps forward on the long road that implies the building of citizenship for those Peruvians who were previously invisible and helpless. Herders in the high punas, displaced from where there is now an immense hole in the ground, community leaders, mayors, and members of committees from neighboring towns also learned how to negotiate, how to take advantage, with whom to ally themselves, and how to force the company to be more responsible for that which it had itself initially committed to. And thus, without blindly taking sides either for or against today’s supercapitalist companies, reading this book teaches us how it might be possible for new mining to avoid simply extracting wealth in the midst of so much poverty, as the industry has been doing since its colonial beginnings.\n\nCopyright © 2020.

Thanks to those efforts, this work benefits from the invaluable contribution of the protagonists interviewed, who still had fresh memories of the beginning of the most recent large mining expansion in Peru. Here I have rewritten and updated relevant information, including selected data produced in subsequent years, and have adapted approaches and terminologies to facilitate an appreciation by an international reading. Like most research efforts, this work is a testimony to individual and collective generosity. Among the innumerable recognitions of indebtedness, I would like to highlight the residents close to the mining areas and the professionals associated with these impacts, who shared their time and ideas to enable me to understand the complexity of the conflicts and negotiations with mining corporations. In San Marcos, I especially thank Mito Vásquez, the members of the Local Communities of Health program, the Huaripampa and Ango Raju de Carhuayoc peasant communities, and the mayor of San Marcos, Francisco Vargas. The staff of the Chavín de Huántar archaeological complex shared valuable testimonies. Particularly attentive and collaborative with the study were, in Huarmey, Karina Morante and Jaime Zevallos of the environmental committee and Mayor Juan Pacífico, and in Huallanca, Mayor Luis Barrenechea. In Huaraz, the Mountain Institute, especially Raúl García and Director Jorge\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

In Lima, Manuel Glave of the Group for the Analysis of Development and Martin Scurrah, former director of Oxfam America, shared valuable advice and experience. I would also like to thank the following personnel of the Antamina Mining Company: in San Marcos, I thank the staff of the Office of Community Development— Agustín Vásquez, Raúl Urbina, Rosa Ocaña, and Iván Vega. In Lima, Steven Botts, then vice president of Environment, Health and Safety, was particularly receptive to my questions. At Yale University I was fortunate to have exceptional mentors and faculty who supported the central work of this book. Enrique Mayer, always generous with his vast knowledge and warm support, gave me a great lesson in free thinking. His encouragement and understanding of my project, through his moral and intellectual support, have been fundamental in my studies and beyond. Michael Dove stimulated the analysis with sharp observations, suggesting innovative ways to approach and understand the interactions between nature and human groups, thereby helping me to move toward new ways of approaching research. Many thanks also to the members of the Dove Doctoral Lab, directed by Michael Dove. Eric Worby was an important motivating figure through successful questioning and recommendations for the analysis of political and social issues. James Scott, David Graeber, William Kelly, Helen Siu, Harold Scheffler, Arun Agrawal, Carol Carpenter, and Andrew Schrank taught me novel ways to both engage and question social theories in the field. At the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Sheila Olmstead was very generous in sharing her knowledge in natural resource management, while Charles Dana Tomlin introduced me to the value of geographic information systems. Parts of the text have benefited from the insights of participants in different academic forums, including meetings of the Latin American Studies Association, the New England Council of Latin American Studies, and the American Anthropological Association, as well as seminars at Yale, Columbia, Dartmouth, and the New School for Social Research.

More than half of these explorations were for copper and a quarter for gold, both of which led to the increase in international mineral prices.1 Following the collapse of communism in Europe in 1989, the World Bank began to promote neoliberal reforms in many countries, encouraging the lifting of restrictions on foreign investment and changes in mining codes to deregulate protections for the environment, labor, and displaced persons (Danielson 2006; Kirsch 2014). New mining codes in South America aimed to emulate the success of Chile in attracting foreign capital following its 1981 introduction of a mining law, which occurred eight years after the coup d’état that had toppled the socialist government of President Salvador Allende and ushered in neoliberal economic policies. Their legislation put an end to treatment considered discriminatory by international firms. The aim was to introduce “more stable and generous tax treatment and allow repatriation of profits” while the governments speeded up the granting of exploration permits (Economist 1995). The openness to foreign investment coincided with a period of environmental pressures and reduced resources for mining in so-called developed countries, such as Australia, Canada, and the USA, that combined to make the industry increasingly difficult and expensive (Kapelus 2002:277).\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

It can be seen as either an ideal imagined future to which investment efforts should be directed, or as a destructive myth: the “evil twin” of anthropology (Ferguson 2002:160), constituting for some an infamous chapter in the history of Western modernity (Edelman and Haugerud 2004; Escobar 1995). Although analyses point to improvements in human wellbeing, in practice a political and technical debate has yet to occur that defines what such improvements would be, the best way to achieve and measure them, and how to integrate dimensions such as sustainability and equity. As this book will show, many conflicts arise from an inability to reconcile the definitions of development. Many confrontations have arisen from frustrated expectations, environmental impact claims, and a state apparatus virtually absent in the locations where new projects emerged. In Peru, although mining investment has been presented as necessary for national progress, it has brought environmental costs, left unfulfilled hopes for development, and led to an increase in conflict, becoming a principal source of confrontation. At the center of mining confrontations are unmet development expectations, forming part of broader welfare discourses. This book discusses the role of the exploitation of nature in development in the context of the growing demand for civil participatory practices and the incorporation of the concept of sustainability. While mining has been Peru’s main source of foreign currency over recent decades, its benefits fail to meet the expectations of different groups, especially in rural areas in the Andes, where poverty and mining coincide. Despite certain strengthening of government regulations and the state’s own environmental organizations since the early 1990s—mostly promoted by international entities and drawing on some national support—mining continues to be a notable source of risk for environmental degradation. The placement of colossal mines close to human settlements that are dedicated to agriculture or grazing and dependent on affected resources—such as water and soil—coupled with mining’s low demand for local labor, creates a sensitive context prone to disputes in which the protagonists are local communities, the mining companies, and the state, as the promoter of the extractive activity. At the center of local defiance is an emerging environmental awareness and a set of older demands for development, within the context of great distrust in state supervisory authorities. The study of the political culture of pollution and risk illustrates how groups shape their claims through cultural and political filters, and how tensions are alleviated—at least in the short term—through participatory scenarios.\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

Under extractive models perceived as near enclaves that fail to generate local jobs or production chains, confrontations have increased between the mining companies and their neighbors, who do not receive the expected benefits. Local concepts and social structures are unknown or ignored by companies. Apart from the cultural differences at the core of the hostilities, there is an immense asymmetry of power between billionaire mining companies and local residents. This book examines the dynamics existing between the social actors, unveiling the rationale behind their behavior and discourses. The study highlights the sociotechnological apparatus of international investment projects, including regulatory systems and social networks, as well as conflictive behavioral patterns. The relationship between extractive industries and neighboring populations has led to an increase in conflicts in Peru, accompanying the expansion of the mining frontier in the Andes and of the oil industry in the Amazon.2 The demands for environmental protection and development—including basic services such as potable water systems—are at the heart of the struggles with mining companies such as Antamina, which presented itself, and was recognized by some relevant groups, as a model of openness and at the forefront of so-called corporate social responsibility. The arrival of a mine to a certain extent conditions its later relationship with local residents. There can only be one first impression. Conflict in Antamina dates back as far as 1996, when the concession for the project was granted. It includes disputes over evictions, obstruction of grazing routes, failure to fulfill promises of jobs and other benefits, and environmental degradation. The processes studied involve the environmental impact assessment (EIA) construction and its rhetorics, the analysis of environmental risks and protests, the resettlement of families, and empirical discussions of the meanings of development and demands for citizenship.3 Those displaced by the operations provided a unique opportunity to focus on an immediate effect of the mine. A comparison of the decision-making processes of neighboring communities when using the funds obtained from the sale of their land revealed their preferences in improving their living conditions, analyzed as development choices. In addition, clues found in an examination of contamination complaints enabled an assessment of environmental degradation protests. I seek to identify the causes of the conflicts and the forms of resistance and negotiation. In this empirical account that begins with the opening of Antamina—a mine\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

To understand the tactics employed by groups, the analysis includes local grievances and the rhetoric that is used as a negotiation resource by the company and other actors, such as NGOs.4 If the underlying dilemmas associated with the capitalist mode of production are only partially resolved through different forms of renegotiation (Kirsch 2014:3), the investigation of resistance to, struggles around, and stratagems for the benefits of natural resources also help us understand the extent of everyday articulation of a state and nation under the mantle of neoliberal policies. I argue that, as a mining tactic, the rhetoric of mineral extraction models for development seeks to counterbalance the demands for real political participation. The book shows that the conflictive processes caused by the opening of a mining project can provide opportunities to extend the citizenship status of some excluded groups through the reappropriation of democratic state discourses and participatory schemes, which themselves emerge as an unanticipated consequence of precisely those same contentious processes.\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

Countries such as Ecuador and Bolivia, whose recent governments have been self-proclaimed critics of neoliberal models, have nevertheless promoted extractive activities that have led to social conflicts. Peru reached the 1990s affected by the antiexport macroeconomic policies of the first government of Alan García, implemented from the mid-1980s, and the closure of several mining projects. During the 1990s, the authoritarian regime of Alberto Fujimori led the expansion of mining through incentives provided by reforms that included rules promoting foreign investment, the sale of state enterprises, the simplification of concession purchasing, and modifications to environmental and tax regulations. Many of these transformations were promoted by the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank (Li 2015). These changes, in the context of a rise in international mineral prices, meant that mining in Peru came to constitute, on average, 10 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) over the last two decades. In this respect, Peru resembles Chile and Bolivia, whose extractive industries represent the largest percentage of GDP in Latin America (Dargent et al. 2017). Neoliberal reforms include the privatization of natural resources, deregulation of social and environmental safeguards, as well as significant social and biophysical transformations, especially in the communities neighboring mining operations. Peru was one of the last Latin American countries to establish an environmental authority and a regulatory framework for national environmental policy. These changes began in 1990 when the Fujimori regime approved a strict environmental code, revised the following year with other decrees to promote private investment.5 Prior to this, Article 123 of the 1979 Constitution was the only one devoted to environmental issues. The amendments contained in the decrees diminished state regulatory capacity by handing over jurisdiction on environmental issues in each sector, including the preparation of EIAs, to the responsible ministry. These decrees reduced environmental standards and established advantageous legal stability agreements for companies (e.g., special tax regimes and free availability of foreign currency and remittance of profits). In parallel, Legislative Decree 708 granted additional benefits for investment (e.g., administrative, tax, and exchange rate stability). The decree also defined\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

The system reproduced governmental centralism and gave limited responsibility for subnational governments while empowering private consulting auditing.6 The stability regime could not be legally altered for up to fifteen years.7 Most of the more than eight hundred environmental regulations have been approved since 1993. In 1992, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, produced at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (or Earth Summit) left an impact on Latin America. Many countries established national environmental commissions or ministries. Two years later the Peruvian government created CONAM (Consejo Nacional del Ambiente, or the National Environmental Council) to coordinate environmental policies among the ministries. Trade unions and peasant or Indigenous federations lacked representation, although the government did expand the public right to information and so-called consultation on environmental issues.8 The 1995 Land Law, law no. 26505, allowed peasant communities to sell their land and defined the concept of servidumbre (easement), which obliged owners to sell their land to a mining company and be compensated in cash.9 Subsequently, the government further extended the incentives for large extractive projects, giving rise to massive profits for businesses and speedy tax collection. Government pressure to promote mining activity by deregulating the precarious mechanisms for labor (in order to weaken unions), for environmental protection and for access to Indigenous lands, was apparent from the 1990s (Gil Ramón 2014). Only at the start of the new millennium—with the creation of MINAM (Ministerio del Ambiente, or the Ministry of the Environment) and its absorption of CONAM to comply with the free trade agreement with the USA—did a limited process commence for the consolidation of institutions for a more autonomous environmental oversight. The privatization process in South America was leading to generalized discontent, primarily due to threatened increases in tariffs for basic services, such as electricity and water, which were to be sold off. Disillusionment led to protest. In Bolivia, following protests against high prices in 2005, the government canceled its contract with a subsidiary of French Suez for the provision of residential water services (Forero 2005). In Peru, the 2002 revolt in the city of Arequipa, or Arequipazo, was the first major mobilization against the sale of a state-owned electrical company based on the fear of massive layoffs. It would\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R.. Fighting for Andean Resources : Extractive Industries, Cultural Politics, and Environmental Struggles in\n\nCopyright © 2020. University of Arizona Press.

The citizenship conflicts over the mining expansion stand out as asymmetric encounters in rural areas involving marginalized sectors, which are relegated from access to private or public opportunities and modern state services. The contemporary demands for citizenry rights can be connected with longer assertion processes from marginalized sectors, especially in rural scenarios. Among the most significant citizenship battles in Peru over the last decades, we can identify both violent manifestations, such as land seizures that preceded the Agrarian Reform of 1969, and more peaceful examples, such as the large migrations to urban centers since the 1940s. The top-down agrarian reform redrew Peru’s social landscape, ending cruel labor conditions for Indigenous peoples, who were converted into precarious citizens.11 In the mining struggles, rural citizens seek transformations, especially in prevention or remediation of mining damage, and rights to greater participation in benefits and modern services. The battles are located within strains of exclusion and class-based historical privileges, as evidenced through the sharp concentration in the capital of the state and its major investments, frequently oblivious to demands from outside the metropolis. The Antamina clashes reflect public concerns over the privatization and neoliberalization process in the region since the 1990s. The Peruvian mining boom since this decade has generated colossal income for companies but unequal gains and losses for the state and neighboring localities. The underfinanced and historically indebted Peruvian state sought funds through the sale of national companies and concessions, many of which operated in nonrenewable resources. Following this globalized exchange, the Economist (2005a) magazine showed that in real terms, the prices of the main industrial goods in the middle of the first decade of the twenty-first century only represented 30 percent of their value in 1845.12 Optimism about the privatizations of the early 1990s was replaced by disappointment about their modest contribution to the generation of employment, not to mention the uncovering of government and business corruption.13 While governments present mining as a source of development, residents question its real benefits and complain about environmental costs. Big mining—or “megamining,” as many activists refer to it—with its colossal scale that starts with the exposure of deep subterranean layers in order to establish an open pit,\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

Indeed, there is now much discussion about the need to define a new geological era—the Anthropocene—to describe human impact on the earth’s ecosystems, reflecting global processes of socioenvironmental interconnection and disintegration. Contemporary mining reflects the current phase of the globalization of capital flows and environmental concerns (Barham et al. 1994; Bunker 1985; Escobar 1995, 1998). Discourses on natural resources, development, and power frame distributive processes about the environment, as in the case of extractive industries (Blaikie and Brookfield 1987; Bryant 1992; Escobar 1991; Peet and Watts 1996). The opening of transnational mining projects is a notable opportunity for observing “glocalization”—global-local linkages reflecting north/south, poor/rich, and West-and-the-rest encounters and disencounters— where more capitalist and urban-based actors confront populations that are Indigenous, vulnerable, marginalized, and poor.16 I examine mutual influences between local and international relations in these contentious scenarios. The increase in mineral prices throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s sparked a boom in mining exploration, particularly in the largely underexplored Asia-Pacific region. As a result of more advanced exploratory technologies, the majority of these new projects were located in the world’s most remote frontiers, inhabited by marginalized populations, including Indigenous peoples. Economically and politically vulnerable people were located at the hub of these mining discoveries (Ballard and Banks 2003). New conflicts arose in these far-flung corners. Examples of these tensions can be found in industrialized countries, such as Canada, as well as poor ones, such as Indonesia and Zambia. Conflict intensified in politically centralized states with weak institutions. The interest in socioenvironmental conflicts over recent decades emerges primarily from social resistance studies, showing how marginalized groups develop strategies to respond to threatening situations (e.g., Comaroff 1985; Guha 1989; Martínez-Alier 1990, 2002; Ong 1987; Scott 1985). In Rowstonian theories of\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R.. Fighting for Andean Resources : Extractive Industries, Cultural Politics, and Environmental Struggles in\n\nCopyright © 2020.

Ethnographic evidence shows how individual motivations and conflicts between groups shape strategies that change according to the dynamics between agents. Affected residents can create mechanisms to present their identity as local or Indigenous. Disputes over political and economic resources can become struggles for cultural representations (Dove 1999; Pigg 1997). Sociologist Louis Kriesberg (1999:122) states that a social conflict can be understood as “a perspective in which conflict permeates and shapes the aspects of human interaction and social structure, or one of innumerable specific fights or struggles, such as wars, revolutions, strikes, and uprisings.” Numerous battles were fought over expectations for development, the displacement of families, disputes over the definitions of property systems, and legitimate compensation for the opening of Antamina. I examine the fundamental assumptions to understand the causes of the conflict and the proposed renegotiation of disputes. Drawing on political ecology approaches, I use discourse analysis to understand the underlying behavioral motivations, rationales, representations, and practices of groups in conflict as manifested in acts, testimonies, and documents (Dove and Kammen 2015; Escobar 1991; Ferguson 1994; Foucault 1980; Grillo and Stirrat 1997; Orlove 1977; Peet and Watts 1996; Schmink and Wood 1992).17 Evidence shows that countries dependent on extractive industries often perform worse than their peers with fewer resources (in terms of economic development and good governance)—the so-called resource curse. The first studies that developed this concept were based on Latin American countries (Auty 1993; Humphreys et al. 2007; Sachs and Warner 1995). In addition, it has been found that the dependence of countries on the mining and oil industry is “strongly associated with unusually bad conditions for the poor” (Ross 2001:4). As president of Peru, García (2007) developed a discourse that attributed this fate to local residents, especially Indigenous associations and communities, together with—who he claimed presented themselves as—protectionist “pluralistic and patriotic anti-mining” groups and “environmentalists.” He articulated this position in several op-eds. According to this rhetoric, the aforementioned groups, by denying others with greater capacity or capital to exploit the natural resources that they themselves don’t use, act in a way that is akin to the fable of the “Dog in the Manger.” In a televised interview he called Amazonian Indigenous Peruvians “not first-class citizens,” accusing them of promoting\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

The absence of adequate institutions and public policies—a kind of institutional curse—has been identified by research that provides more detailed explanations of the relationship between natural resource dependency and economic growth (e.g., Auty 2000; Humphreys et al. 2007; Karl 1997; Ross 1999, 2001, 2007). Evidence about socioenvironmental conflicts demonstrates institutional apparatus—legal, financial, bureaucratic, and technoscientific—perpetuating scenarios of domination (Brosius 1999). Transnational mining projects bring together colossal globalized extractive forces and “corporate social technologies” (Rogers 2012), including governance regimes designed to manage their relations with the public, aiming to mitigate concerns by stimulating uncertainty and doubt (Kirsch 2014). This book investigates the behavior of large extractive corporations, including multilateral agencies, to understand the social dynamics of multinational capital beyond corporate culture (Rouse and Fleising 1995), examining the impact of corporate policies that seek a more environmental face for mining when pressured by civil society and international organizations such as the World Bank. Demonstrating the significance of the capacity of organizations to enforce regulations, extractive industries in regions with weak local institutions frequently lead to greater environmental degradation (Bunker 1985; Martínez-Alier 1990, 2002). The boom in these industries has weakened institutions, especially where governments lack transparency and accessibility (Ballard and Banks 2003; Karl 1997; MMSD 2002; Ross 1999). Empirical studies point to a relationship between natural resources and conflicts, highlighting the impact on state capacity or democracy (e.g., Ross 2006). In some cases, mining has damaged institutions, producing a direct relationship with civil conflicts (MMSD 2002). Countries whose macroeconomic well-being depends largely on the export of primary products have a high propensity for civil violence (Collier and Hoeffler 2000; Humphreys 2005; Ross 2006). The importance of institutions to influence the quality of sustainable development has been addressed from the governance of natural resources to achieve sustainability (e.g., Agrawal 2005; Humphreys et al. 2007; Martínez-Alier 2002;\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

The mechanisms to ensure environmental quality and human development from mining frequently have been weak, contributing to social confrontations, especially when the mining expansion precedes the necessary institutional adaptation (Bebbington and Bury 2009; Muradian et al. 2003). The timing of the creation of effective institutions to control the arrival of extractive industries contributes to the degree of benefit or harm to the environment and society (e.g., Karl 1997). Negative impacts can generate conflicts even when regulations are implemented (Gil Ramón 2014). Institutional deficiencies explain a good part of the environmental conflicts generated by mining, which are catalyzed when it becomes impossible to channel fears and legitimate demands (Bebbington and Bury 2009; Gil Ramón 2009). Approaches with a more institutional-cultural orientation reveal the importance of examining competitions for power, participation, and political tactics between groups. These studies identify who defines a change in nature as a risk and contributes to a recognition of the rhetorical tools in environmental degradation discussions (e.g., Douglas and Wildavksy 1982; Fortun 2001; OliverSmith 1996). Debates about the role of human impact in nature show how the environment is constructed, symbolized, and contested by different subjects (Brosius 1999). In response to environmental criticism and because of international pressure, the EIA process appeared as a tool that sought to reconcile negative mining impacts. I examine the rhetoric that claims that through an EIA all the environmental and social “footprints”—a term used by an Antamina official—would be predictable, manageable, and able to be mitigated. The EIAs draw on a rhetoric of prevention with little predictive power, as demonstrated by the study led by mining engineer James Kuipers in the USA. EIA discourse proclaims its authority based on the supposed technical and scientific objectivity of the experts that construct it. The evidence discussed throughout this book helps us understand how the natural sciences and technology are embedded in globalized political contexts, impacting new forms of social mobilizations (Ballard and Banks 2003).19\n\nSocial Research on Mining Due to lower transportation costs in the 1960s, mines were located away from consumers and processing centers. As mines grew and the technological processes became more complex, the specialized mining labor and equipment was\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

A global pattern was established: multinational companies, the purchase of inputs outside the mining region, and the geographical dispersion of the projects. As a result, regional economic ties decreased with respect to the time when mines were smaller and located near industrial centers (Eggert 2001:34). Higher proportions of inputs were purchased outside the extractive area, processing near the deposit decreased, and multinational companies managed their revenues away from the mining region. Tax payments more clearly benefited national governments, rather than the regions or localities neighboring the mine. The mining companies built settlements and supported infrastructure that was mainly focused on the direct needs of the mine and its workers. National governments and mining companies tended to make decisions without considering neighboring communities. The enclave and its few links with the national economy had only a slight impact on internal development (Edelman and Haugerud 2005; Scott and Marshall 2005a). The term enclave was propagated in the 1960s through dependence theories, which highlighted the problems of countries on the “periphery” that based their economies on exports to countries in the “center” controlled by foreign capital. The historian Alberto Flores Galindo (1993:33 [1974]), in his study of the Cerro de Pasco Copper Corporation (or La Cerro), defines the mining enclave as “a company whose origin was abroad, where its decision center and the destination of its production were also located.”20 Historians Contreras and Cueto (2007:210–213) inquire into the general historiography, criticizing the purportedly scarce production chains from these large mining centers, at least for a large part of the twentieth century. According to these authors, the critique mostly apply to oil projects, which worked under relative isolation, whereas large mining centers, when accompanied by significant local salaried jobs, presumably contributed to dynamizing peasant agriculture in several regions. From the perspective of neighboring communities or the region, a mine becomes an enclave when it isolates itself from nonmining activities, especially in poor countries. Underground mines hired large unskilled labor forces during the 1970s. The social sciences focused on mining in the Andes—especially in Peru during the 1970s and 1980s—concentrated on regional economic development (e.g., DeWind 1987; Long and Roberts 1984). These scholars detailed the extent to which peasants became unionized proletarians (e.g., Dewind 1975; Flores Galindo 1993 [1974]; Godoy 1985; Mallon 1983; Nash 1993 [1979]; Taussig 1980). The anthropological research into the mining industry highlighted stud-\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

Nash and Taussig exemplify the works of historical, symbolic, and ethnographic political economy to understand processes of social resistance. Working conditions improved after the appearance of open-cut mines in the 1950s and their subsequent gradual global expansion. However, this system occasionally meant temporary or subcontract labor regimes. These mines led to a fiftyfold increase of waste rock by comparison with underground mining. Labor conflicts continued, however, their political importance diminished (Dore 2000; Kirsch 2014). The neoliberal reforms in Peru during the 1990s— the reform of mining codes, the lifting of restrictions on the investment of foreign capital, and the privatization of state industries—heralded new relationships between mining transnationals and impoverished neighboring populations. In this book I also show how a large-scale mining project affects the population and the surrounding environment in different ways according to the stage of the life cycle of the mine, arguing that these new mines can be perceived locally as near enclaves, independent from other economic processes in the contiguous and impacted areas. Yet the aggregation of activities of different mines and mining-related enterprises could have a significant impact on a region. Historically, diverse scenarios account for mining activity integrating regions in a single economic sphere (Assadourian et al. 1980; Godoy 1985:207–208). There was a shift from a process of “accumulation by exploitation” in the confrontations, with workers complaining of labor exploitation during the 1960s to 1970s, to a greater “accumulation by dispossession” brought about by privatizations (Harvey 2003). This process led to new concerns about environmental impacts, particularly manifested as threats to the subsistence agricultural activities of residents close to the open pit (Kirsch 2014). Emblematic cases in Peru included the fumes produced by the La Oroya refinery, the impact of water from the Yanacocha gold mine, and the threat to agriculture posed by the Tambogrande mining project. Research began to be conducted to understand the social dynamics of conflicts and resistance in marginalized contexts, highlighting the competition between mining and agriculture (e.g., Bebbington and Bury 2013; Bury 2004; Caravedo 1998; Gil Ramón 2005, 2009; Golub 2014; Kirsch 2014; Muradian et al. 2003; Scurrah 2008). This competition has generated particular contentious scenarios when basic resources such as water or soil\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

An issue that continues to require further indepth study is how these imposed EIA sociotechnologies affect the negotiations and interactions between various confronted groups (Gil Ramón 2005, 2009). Beyond utilitarian conceptions of natural resources, this book addresses transformations and impacts, departing from the disagreements over the opening of a mining project. The study examines the negotiations and demands for participation in environmental evaluations, using the study of the EIA assembly, established as a sociotechnological tool for approaching the impact of mining. Demands for participation are useful for understanding the questioning of the environmental “matters of fact” proposed by the mining company, replaced by a broader discussion of “matters of concern” (Latour 2004), referring to the networks between subjects and information in order to establish diverse environmental knowledge and meaning. The anthropologist Roy Rappaport (1993:298) criticized the way in which the economy supplied contemporary societies with their “dominant social discourse” to the detriment of fundamental ecological issues. There is a growing need to study the interface of how ecological problems are economized (i.e., translated into economic terms) frequently using national development labels. By taking into account cultural contexts, an analysis of impact evaluation guidelines and the causes of conflict—examining how populations evaluate their participation in and expected benefits from mining projects—provides elements for understanding how to strengthen institutions, reform aspects of equity, and reduce negative externalities.\n\nExpectations of Citizenship The abundant narratives about contemporary globalization celebrating international interconnections—generally reflecting unequal exchanges—are insufficient for understanding contentious scenarios. The economist Amartya Sen (2002) prefers the term globalism over globalization to denote the current asymmetric exchanges of capital and information, where the individual has restricted capacity to cross borders for employment motivations by comparison with multinational corporations that are able to mobilize as truly globalized subjects and are welcome to work virtually in any country.21 Changes in regulations,\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

In Latin America, the notion of citizenship that has emerged is linked to processes of democratization that have occurred since the 1980s, especially in countries with authoritarian regimes (Dagnino 2006). This panorama has generated debates about the meaning of political participation and the dynamics of state formation in relation to claims against domination and demands for legitimacy (Krupa and Nugent 2015; Scott 1976, 1985, 1998). Over the last several decades, most of the Andean region has been witness to major restructuring that has produced a particular historical conjuncture of governmental contraction and expansion associated with violent redistributions of social, political, and economic rights, as well as obligations between the public and private sectors. The beginning of the mining boom of the 1990s led to sustained macroeconomic growth in Peru for the first time in many years, something that continued into the new millennium. The word opportunity appeared frequently in publications, conjuring up images of an auspicious expansion of mining and favorable economic scenarios.22 Not properly considered at first was that the Peruvian Andes now had a large population—certainly much larger than at the start of the Spanish Conquest—consisting of vulnerable and marginal citizens, with an important Indigenous presence, who were survivors of the war between the Shining Path and the state during the 1980s and 1990s.23 I offer consideration to discourses and practices relating to citizenship that are broadly regarded as an unstable, contextually constructed, and continuous series of transactions and sets of relations between persons and agents of a given state, in which each has rights and obligations while experiencing encounters in political terrains and where everyday economic processes and power relations are mediated and contested over access and political participation (Gregory 2008; Tilly 1995). The citizenship approach used transcends the current status and is more a “legitimating political and cultural field” (Krupa and Nugent 2015:6), constantly restructured against promises and popular clamor, applied not only to the state but also to the disencounters of citizens in the face of corporate apparatuses and regimes. I also evaluate how conflicts can be interpreted as a demand by excluded citizens who seek social participation rights for concrete benefits and safeguards against the exploitation of a “national patrimony” (Article 66 of the Peruvian Constitution), such as mineral resources. Participation by all seeks to end the “political alienation”—paraphrasing anthropologist Eric Wolf (1971)—and find paths toward a national liberation.\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

The notion was popularized as a division between the urban and the rural. In 1943 Basadre used the phrase Perú profundo (deepest Peru) for the first time. It pointed to groups closer to the informal sector, at the margins of the mercantile system and the cities (Mayer 1992:192). The anthropologist Arjun Appadurai (2001) proposes to examine “deep democracy” to understand social tensions in broadening the definitions of politics, as a consequence of the denationalization of older governmental spaces.24 Depth also refers to impoverished populations establishing alliances with more powerful groups—urban, regional, national, or multilateral. This notion frames local demands and the appropriation of government discourses (such as citizenship) for local development in relation to the increase of connections between local and international networks, sharing ideals of inclusion, participation, transparency, responsibility, and activism. Citizenship is not confined only to the limits of relationships with the state but is also with the society itself, as shown in this case with the interactions with powerful corporations (Dagnino 2006).25 The demand for direct participation, by civil society and social movements in spaces and decision-making processes normally left only to the state, has become one of the keystones in the redefinition of citizenship, based on the transformations in the power relationships of Latin American societies (Dagnino 2006:26).26 This book examines a citizenship from below, seeking to ally with a “grassroots globalization” while evaluating the discourses and intentions of the participants (Appadurai 2000; Dagnino 2006). To this end, I recount perceptions about compensation for damages from the opening of a mine, including the expectations for development, highlighting the formulation and deployment of the EIA, as well as the implementation of multi-stakeholder mesas (negotiation roundtables) and comités de monitoreo (environmental monitoring committees) (Escobar 1995; Ferguson 1999; Peet and Watts 1996; Rahnema 1992; World Bank 1996). In general—although sometimes the roles overlap—a mesa could be a mesa de diálogo (dialogue roundtable) or mesa de concertación (agreement roundtable) for addressing a more urgent conflict, and a mesa de desarrollo (development roundtable) for evaluating local needs for social services or programs. The widely used expression participación ciudadana (citizen participation) implies the right to participate in public affairs but does not clarify conditions, meanings, and the status of the act (Dagnino 2006:28). Based on the deliberative\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

The mining conflicts allow empirical discussion of the competition for access to and benefits from nature, reporting cultural imperatives of behaviors and strategies assembled as practices with individual motivations, establishing citizenship as a configuration of action to participate. Becoming an active citizen entails one’s transformation into a political subject, aware of one’s rights and with the capacity to fight for them (Dagnino 2006:28). Ballard and Banks (2003) demonstrate how multiactor approaches contribute to understanding mining conflicts by considering contexts with new and rapid interactions, highlighting how NGOs with national and international networks are able to establish negotiations with transnational corporations, such as mining companies. I explore unexpected collaborations (e.g., NGOs and mining companies) that maintain the “friction” (Tsing 2005) of globalized scenarios, articulated more as networks of “enunciatory communities” (Fortun 2001:11) with a changing nature and based on particular interests. I also explore a sector that has received insufficient attention in studies of mining conflicts: the media, especially mass communication systems and their influence on social interactions in contentious scenarios. I examine the role of these agents in creating expectations and channeling local demands. Their performance is important, given the growing public demand to know the details of the plans and policies of extractive projects.\n\nExcavating Research This book reflects my long-term commitment to socioenvironmental concerns, which stems from my being a born-and-raised Peruvian citizen. This led to approximately two years of ethnographic research conducted between 2000 and 2004, followed by further fieldwork in prioritized mining areas in 2014. Archive research was followed by interviews and informal conversations. I aimed for a data collection process in order to identify an inductive conceptual framework to understand the research questions based on key local issues, subjective norms, and cultural schemas related to the impact and conflict arising from mining expansion. Subsequently, I cross-checked information from different sources and discussed my ideas about the main factors causing conflicts so\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

By examining events and processes, my approach sought to identify emerging patterns. Given the breadth of the Antamina project, I opted for a multisited approach. The fieldwork was empirically grounded close to the mine site in Ancash while also tracking the evidence about the impact in various localities, but most particularly in three towns: San Marcos, Huarmey, and Huallanca. From San Marcos I visited the neighboring communities of Huaripampa and Ango Raju de Carhuayoc. I also included Lima, where state institutions, NGOs, and Antamina headquarters were located (see map 1). In each locality I posed the same set of questions about the impact of mining and then contrasted responses. A multiactor approach contributed to the examination of the polyphony of discourses around the subjects and cultural imperatives that lay beneath the causes of the conflict.27 In a dispute context, the multivocal approach reflected the diverse positions and changes that were framed in interests and rationalities, all revealed when processes collide. The cross-checking of several types of data meant conducting more than three hundred interviews and collecting dozens of reports with more quantitative information. Maps, songs, photographs, and hundreds of news stories, among many other sources, were also consulted. The central questions for the research guided me as I traveled to the various localities. Since I was trying to understand the causes of conflict, I started at the sites first impacted by the mining project. For this reason, I began working in the district of San Marcos.28 Interviews with displaced families provided a wealth of information about a social change directly produced by the mining project. During encounters with the residents, I began to discover a particular opportunity to compare the revealing negotiation and change processes experienced by the communities of Huaripampa and Ango Raju de Carhuayoc, considering also that many displaced families were either from these communities or moved there. I later compared the initial experiences of development, examining the decision-making process of these communities—among other populations—for the allocation of the funds obtained from selling their land. My assumption was that the funding choices would reveal the cultural concepts underlying the preferences for improving their well-being. During my fieldwork I also traced complaints about contamination. These grievances enabled the analysis of social structures and cultural patterns for the comprehension of the environmental degradation claims. Huallanca offered a rich comparison with San Marcos. I heard many testimonies about the favorable impact in Huallanca of a direct relationship with the\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

This condition was something the people of San Marcos resented. As the mine site was located in their district jurisdiction, the residents expected clear benefits from the outset. Although these Andean towns had much in common, from the perspective of the people of San Marcos, the experience in Huallanca came to be seen as a kind of inverted mirror because of what they perceived to be positive results that the arrival of Antamina brought. Although the urban architecture of Huallanca was directly impacted by the transportation of machinery for the construction of the mining operations area, it was San Marcos that suffered from pollution caused by the mine opening, which visibly affected aquatic bodies. While San Marcos had families complaining about displacement for the construction of the operations, Huallanca was temporarily invaded by the workers constructing Antamina’s infrastructure. With advice from the municipality, several families in Huallanca provided temporal lodging, which meant temporary income. Probably the most visible collective difference between the initial impacts in these two towns was the “big gift”—in the shape of a large coliseum and reconstruction of its main square—that Huallanca received from Antamina as a compensation for the damage to its urban architecture. Huarmey, the coastal town where the Antamina pipeline terminates and from where the concentrate is shipped (see map 1), was another particularly important site, due to protests that arose there reflecting fears about environmental degradation. These protests would have wide resonance and ultimately lead to the involvement of national-level authorities. Examining events there allowed the documentation of renegotiation mechanisms mediated by direct actions, providing material for a contrast between coastal and mountain scenarios. This book takes on the shape of a long trip, uncovering trails based on the footprints of contentious changes caused by the mining project. In the introductory chapter, by examining the most recent mining boom in the Andes following the privatization process within a neoliberal legislative apparatus during the 1990s, I focus on the context that sowed the contentious scenarios. Departing from a case study centered in the mountains of Peru, I also lay out conceptual analytical tools to address mining conflicts within a context of demands for development and citizen participation. Since the book emerges from an inquiry of the micropolitics of negotiations, in chapter 1 I present the narrative for the impact of the initial phases of the Antamina project while tracing the main paths and footprints produced. Starting with ancient legends, I proceed to describe the background of the mining\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

My examination of social changes introduces the EIA process as the main instrument for intermediation between nature and society. The description of the infrastructure and the main rhetorical mining tools for delimiting the extractive impact rationalize the selection of the main research sites presented. In order to save the reader from a cultural shock from the immersion into the Andean and international micro- and macropolitics of negotiations, I introduce the cast involved in the mining expansion, which lays the ground for understanding their pathways followed in the book. In chapter 2 I examine local disputes caused by the displacement of people living at the mining site. The investigation unveils dilemmas with the communication internal to the company and with residents. By scrutinizing the debates between different parties about cultural notions and regimes of value, time, space, and land tenure rights, the chapter displays the corporate sociotechnologies that provoke marginal residents’ responses to participate, reap benefits, and obtain compensation. Through an analysis of the social groups contesting the risk evaluations by referring to the use of space—in this case, around a natural protected area— chapter 3 introduces the cultural politics of technical reports and the evolution of EIAs. It examines strategies employed under the leadership of a small NGO based in the USA, the Mountain Institute (TMI). In its efforts to diminish risks posed to the Huascarán National Park, this organization negotiated directly with the mining company’s financial investors, promoting a redesign of the route and method for ore transport from the mine to the coastal shipping port in Huarmey. Many inhabitants of Huarmey had high expectations of benefits expected to accrue from the arrival of a new road. These included better opportunities for their agricultural products and the prospect of providing services to the drivers of heavy vehicles. When a pipeline option was chosen instead, Huarmey groups protested and resorted to arguments about potential contamination. By providing a cultural examination of the politics of power and place and unpacking the evolution of the behavioral patterns displayed by the confronted groups, the chapter demonstrates how ground debates over environmental impact can promote political participation, even prompting for unanticipated dialogues and alliances. In chapter 4 I examine the meaning of development as a contentious resource for different groups. The historical overview of development myths in mining\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

I follow the route of monetary compensation obtained from land sales or compensation paid by the mining company and other fund transfers that emerged as a byproduct of the extractive activities. The interpretation of the results analyzes the “big gift” and the “corporate social responsibility” regime in order to understand behavior practices in conflict situations. The evidence shows that when abundant resources become available over a short period of time, the aim for development comes to imply a negotiation of multiple concepts in motion by different subjects. An analysis of reciprocity in the Andes helps us to understand the behavior of local residents when confronted by a large mining company and its rhetoric of voluntary corporate social responsibility. Local expectations of development through economic participation can be better understood as part of a larger demand for citizen participation in the recent history of claims for benefits from mining. In chapter 5 I analyze the clash of cultures and the power strategies that address environmental risks, as well as the conflicts based on disagreements over the process of hazardous changes in nature brought about by the mining project. The unpacking of rhetorical battles provides elements to understand behavioral schemes in the claims and negotiations about contamination, especially regarding demands for participation in environmental risk definitions. In the concluding chapter, I provide a review of the research approach while reexamining connections not previously highlighted, especially regarding the repertoire and dynamics of stratagems. The book concludes with thoughts about the extent of the tradability of mining claims, and with a reflection on future challenges for research on institutional regimes to understand contentious mining scenarios while considering mobilizations and their ability to redefine political landscapes and citizenship.\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

All rights reserved.\n\nMining Apparatus\n\nThe name Antamina is formed from the Quechua word anta (copper) and the Spanish word mina (mine). The Antamina Lake was located in an uninhabited rocky space mostly unsuitable for agriculture or grazing, both widespread across the region. This aquatic body and its surroundings were privately owned or in the hands of peasant communities. There had been several mining projects in the area prior to the arrival of the Antamina company. Neither the banks nor the lake had been used, although according to local legend, the lake was home to giant serpents who lived side by side with fighting bulls.1 Marcos, a farmer from the Huaripampa peasant community, told me the lake was the site of mythical bullfights during the full moon. He grew up near Antamina Lake before migrating to Lima, the capital. At the age of sixty, he still remembered the aridness of the place and his fear of the lake with its mythical inhabitants: Below is a cave, a large well. We stayed away from it because we were afraid. Golden bulls have been seen there. . . . It is said of Antamina that there was\n\na golden snake inside. . . . Some gringos were exploring. A diver went in, a gringo, and came out dripping blood. It is no story [fantasy]. We were grazing\n\nour livestock when the ambulance went by and several more cars. Later they\n\nappeared and said, “The gringo has died.” . . . Nobody could live in this lake. Besides, Antamina is rocky, there is no grass, nothing. My mother said when\n\nshe was a child . . . with a catapult you would throw salt into the lake and a large\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

The site was all rocks, unpleasant, difficult, completely mineral.\n\nAlejandro Espinoza is a native of Chavín de Huántar, a town neighboring San Marcos. He worked in the archaeological complex for which the town is named—one of the oldest Andean ceremonial centers. For him, the beliefs about Antamina were inscribed in the legends about the water sources.\n\nCopyright © 2020. University of Arizona Press. All rights reserved.\n\nWe have many beliefs here about lagoons, rivers, and puquial [“spring” in Quec-\n\nhua] waters whose sources are in the hills, and about giving a pagapu [“offering”\n\nin Quechua] to the apus in the hills.2 We offer a pagapu to the puquial so that\n\nis does not dry up. . . . It is believed that within that lake [Antamina] there are bulls, bulls made of gold. The pagapu is mostly given to them [those types of aquatic bodies]. When the bull leaves, the lake will follow it by emptying. An\n\navalanche will start. . . . Our ancestors believed very much in our nature, in the lakes, in the apus.\n\nThe thirty-two-hectare lake was drained because most of the mineral body was located under its waters (Love et al. 2004). In popular imagination the foretold avalanche and the mythical fighting bulls conjured up disputes in this mining region, embodying conflict by alluding to the dangers present in its waters, capable of drowning strangers. The poverty present in this rural landscape\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

These juxtapositions are something the mining entrepreneurs were not fully capable of or willing to understand, as this book details. This chapter offers a prelude of the sociotechnological mining apparatus assemblage landing on the main impacted socioenvironmental scenarios. It also delineates issues fundamental to understanding the power of the main social actors in the conflicts that are developed in the next chapters. It provides a preparatory overview of the mining concession, the consortium evolution, the infrastructure and its extraterritoriality, and the institutional framework of the EIA. By outlining the main elements of the conflictive orchestras, including the socioenvironmental settings, this section announces the corpus of the main cast and the tone to appreciate the complex processes dissected in the following chapters.\n\nCopyright © 2020. University of Arizona Press. All rights reserved.\n\nBackground and Benefits References to mining in and around Antamina date back to the mid-nineteenth century and start with the small Taco and Rosa projects (KS 1998a). These had also been worked by pre-Hispanic residents. In 1952, Cerro de Pasco Copper Corporation—La Cerro—owned concessions, was the first company to conduct exploratory work, and had completed a feasibility study; however, political complications postponed exploitation indefinitely (CMA 2005a). By 1971, with Peru under a military government, many of La Cerro’s concessions over Antamina had expired. Control reverted to the state under the administration of Minero Perú (AMIDEP 1997a). In 1973 Minero Perú and the Romanian company Geomin agreed to develop the mine. They formed the Empresa Minera Especial Antamina, rehabilitated more than 3,200 meters of underground work, and developed approximately 900 meters of exploration. Financial problems led to the dissolution of this company in 1981 and return to state control, via the state-run mining consortium Centromin. The consortium originated from the expropriated possessions of the Cerro de Pasco Corporation in 1974. Its projects in the area had little financial success, and in 1996 the government launched a tender process (KS 1998a). The most vivid mining experience in the collective memory of residents of the district of San Marcos was that of the Sociedad Minera Gran Bretaña in the 1980s, and its extraction of minerals in Contonga, five kilometers from Antamina Lake (see map 2). The company went bankrupt during the 1990s (it\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

The Antamina project was bombastically presented by the Peruvian media as one of the largest in the world (see chapter 2). Understandably, residents imagined the possibility of an abundance of new jobs and the opportunity to sell products, just as they had done to Contonga personnel. These old mines were a benchmark in the popular memory, setting the parameters for the expectations of development detailed throughout this book. Political economist Albert Hirschman (1958, 1978) laid out the central logic of the power of large companies when policy makers seek to provide them with stability and protect them in the hope that they will generate employment. If companies fulfill this promise, they produce popular well-being, which in turn attracts votes for the reelection of the government. The Antamina contract contained generous incentives. The Antamina concession must be understood in the context of the stimulus provided by the Fujimori regime to attract international capital, which was a response to the internal armed conflict sparked by Shining Path and policies of the mid-1980s that had alienated foreign investment. The capture of Shining Path’s leader in 1992, coupled with the legislative reforms of the decade, promoted macroeconomic stability and led to colossal profits for international investors. The government included the mining concessions belonging to the state enterprise Centromin—and, by extension, Antamina—in a decree that declared of “national interest the promotion of private investment” in state-owned companies.3 Through an international public tender in 1996, the government evaluated domestic and foreign bids to develop the project, which consisted of forty-five concessions, a petitorio (claim), support facilities (camps; galerías, or “levels”; and cruceros, or “crosscuts”), and information about exploration (CEPRI-Centromin 1996:260). Many of these concessions sat over the land of peasant communities and private individuals who lacked legal formalization of their titles. Rights of usufruct were, however, customarily recognized. Moreover, the sale of mining natural resources and privatization do not involve local prior consultation. As there is not a complete cadastre of Indigenous communities, nor is this condition verified before a private entity obtains a concession, it is common for concessions to cover territories belonging to these communities (Dargent et al. 2017; IBC 2015). The possession rights for natural resources affect the expectation of benefits, something which in turn contributes to understanding the conflicts. Other than a few localities within countries such as the United States, Canada, and some old Spanish concessions in Colombia, mining rights around\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

Occasionally, when the minerals are part of the surface ownership, the state establishes regulations. In South Africa, for example, the (subsequently replaced) Minerals Act required the issue of a license for exploration or mining activities.4 The ownership structure contributes to the understanding of local expectations of development. Understandably, a citizen—especially a neighbor to a mine—expects benefits from the exploitation of a resource that is both national heritage and a public good. In accordance with the Peruvian Constitution, given that natural resources belong to all citizens, the state administers them on behalf of the nation. The term concession only implies a right to natural underground resources that do not affect the surface. These superficial lands frequently lack legal title, although there are owners who use the terrain, sell it, or pass it down to the next generation. Some bidders for the Antamina tender expressed concern about this condition, since they understood they were also acquiring a conflict. As one former Antamina employee commented when we talked almost a decade after the company obtained the concession: “When it comes to a privatization project and the state grants mining rights . . . what is being given when the surface belongs to others? The idea that the project could fail due to lack of agreement with the owners of the surface land almost did not enter into our risk analysis. . . . It is very difficult for a company today to put a mine where people do not want it.” The management of surface rights for Antamina was left to the new concession holder. The contract released Centromin from “all clear title obligations,” other than eviction (CEPRI-Centromin 1996:529; Corvetto 1996:499). The establishment of clear title required hasty work by PETT (Proyecto Especial de Titulación de Tierras y Catastro Rural, or the Special Land Titling and Cadastre Project). Established in 1992, and originally financed by the World Bank, PETT began under the Ministry of Agriculture before being absorbed by the Ministry of Housing in 2007. Included among its functions was the physical and legal clear titling of private rural land and of peasant and native communities. The state recognized its absence during a possible mediation between the concession buyer and the land surface owners or groups settled in the concession area. Although visible in negotiating the concession and for land titling, the state’s presence was otherwise scarce at the time of Antamina’s arrival. This increased the risk of conflict. Farmers with limited time resources and training in complex regulations had to negotiate directly with a billion-dollar transnational mining company.\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R.. Fighting for Andean Resources : Extractive Industries, Cultural Politics, and Environmental Struggles in\n\nM I N I N G A P PA R AT U S\n\n31\n\nThe tender documentation promoted the use of state-of-the-art technology, which inevitably excludes low-skilled local labor. Tenderers had to propose a “base price” (or minimum amount) to be disbursed for the concessions and the “minimum investment commitment” to develop the project. The winner promised to invest $2.52 billion, plus $20 million for the option of the deposit. The commitment generously included many expenses or costs (e.g., feasibility studies and offices) counted as investment, which appeared to generate benefit for the company rather than the country. The tax security requested by some bidders meant an estabilidad jurídica (legal stability) contract consistent with prevailing legislation. The Antamina investment contract did not require the employment of a minimum number of Peruvian workers or local residents, nor did it mention how the project would directly benefit the adjacent populations. The contract ended when Antamina paid the $111.5 million penalty applied because it failed to meet the agreed minimum investment commitment (see chapter 4).\n\nCopyright © 2020.

It has opportunistically devoured the smaller organizations that previously owned the concession. The Antamina concession was won by a consortium consisting of the Canadian companies Rio Algom Limited and Inmet Mining Corporation, which in 1996 formed a Peruvian subsidiary— Compañía Minera Antamina S.A.—to execute the project. The exploration stage confirmed reserves 25 percent greater than those previously estimated, and Antamina announced that there would be twenty years of production, extracting seventy thousand tons of concentrate per day (Schmidt 1999). A subsequent expansion of operations would extend the life of the mine until the year 2029, a total of approximately thirty years. The parent firms would change during the life of the project. The junior partner Inmet withdrew before the approval of the EIA in 1998 because it was unable to finance its part of the proposal development. Noranda Inc. and Teck Corporation, also Canadian, joined Rio Algom through the purchase of Inmet’s share, giving the project a greater international dimension. Officials of the three companies visited the mine, reviewed the environmental impact statement, and replaced some employees in order to improve the project’s environmental and social dimensions (Schmidt 1999). The changes were probably influenced by\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R.. Fighting for Andean Resources : Extractive Industries, Cultural Politics, and Environmental Struggles in\n\nCopyright © 2020.

Rio Algom, the majority partner, was also involved in disputes with environmentalists and neighbors at sites in Canada and the United States. Its CEO, Pat James, stated in a speech in 1998, “If our industry cannot effectively combine social, economic, and environmental goals, then we will gradually find ourselves unable to operate” (Schmidt 1999:55). While financing was being arranged, Mitsubishi Company of Japan also joined. At that stage share ownership of the consortium was as follows: Rio Algom (33.75 percent), Noranda (33.75 percent), Teck Corporation (22.5 percent), and Mitsubishi (10 percent). In 2000, Noranda made a hostile takeover bid for Rio Algom, forcing the latter to look to the British giant Billiton. The following year, Billiton merged with the Australian mining company Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd. (BHP) to form, at that time, the world’s largest mining company. At that stage, the consortium consisted of the Anglo-Australian BHP Billiton (33.75 percent), the Canadian companies Noranda (33.75 percent) and Teck Cominco (22.5 percent), and the Japanese-based firm Mitsubishi Corporation (10 percent) (CMA 2002). In 2004 Falconbridge absorbed Noranda, which in turn was absorbed by Xstrata, a Swiss-based mining corporation. In 2013 the latter was absorbed by the Anglo-Swiss Glencore commodity trading and mining company, considered the third largest copper-zinc producer in the world. By mid-2018, the shareholders in Antamina were BHP Billiton (33.75 percent), Glencore (33.75 percent), Teck (22.5 percent), and Mitsubishi Corporation (10 percent). The Canadian companies were welcomed by Peruvian media organizations following the announcement of the tender result. By contrast, another Canadian mining company, Barrick, which was exploiting gold elsewhere in the Ancash Department, had been criticized for its environmental record. Antamina stated its intention to avoid the criticisms that had been directed at the Yanacocha project, the largest gold mine in Latin America. A joint venture between the U.S. company Newmont (51 percent), the Peruvian company Buenaventura (43 percent), and the IFC (International Finance Corporation of the World Bank) (5 percent). Yanacocha was the first large international mine of Peru’s recent boom. This project has been characterized by its conflictive relationship with local residents and by struggles that have included mercury spills in Choropampa, clashes over the proposed drainage of lagoons for the Conga mining project, and protests that led to the cancellation of a planned expansion into\n\nGil, Ramón, Vladimir R..

As in the conflictive scenarios of socioenvironmental disputes of Noranda and Rio Algom, BHP-Billiton withdrew from Ok Tedi Mining at Papua New Guinea in 2002 after long and costly court disputes and lawsuit settlements, some of which continued afterward (Golub 2014; Kirsch 2014). I argue that these expensive episodes marked the consortium’s rapacious instincts toward investments and their accompanying socioenvironmental issues, generating internal debates that reflected in actions, strategies, rhetorics, and lessons that are examined through this book.\n\nCopyright © 2020.

Antamina contracted Klohn Crippen—SVS S.A. Ingenieros Consultores to prepare the environmental impact statement.5 This firm, which had been constituted as a Peruvian company during the privatization of Antamina in 1996 (KS 1998a), in turn subcontracted an NGO that presents itself as specialized in social issues—AMIDEP (Asociación Multidisciplinaria de Investigación y Docencia en Población, or Multidisciplinary Association for Research and Teaching in Population) (AMIDEP 1997a). The environmental impact statement was primarily based on government information and an environmental baseline that had been established by Klohn Crippen—SVS S.A. Ingenieros Consult"
