See About archive blog posts.\n\nHe was a journalist, screenwriter, humorist, television host and comic-strip author, among other skills. Jorge Guinzburg, 59, died in Buenos Aires this month.\n\nMultitudes mourned his passing; parts of his funeral at the La Tablada Jewish cemetery were broadcast live. His offbeat take on world events during the 1980s, as democracy was returning to a nation recovering from years of ‘dirty war,’’ was a welcome relief after the humorless reign of the generals.\n\nSome called him an Argentine hybrid of Woody Allen and Danny DeVito.\n\nA tinge of melancholy leavened his humor. Wrote Jorge Lanata in Critica: ‘If we’re speaking of God, I would like to believe that Jorge Guinzburg, like many others, is now in some place with a look of surprise, in peace and without the sadness that every now and then escaped from his eyes.’’ R.I.P. Jorge Guinzburg."
