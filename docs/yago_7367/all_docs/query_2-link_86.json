        "text": "Woody Allen is suing Amazon Studios for £52 million after it refused to distribute his film, following allegations about him molesting his adopted daughter resurfaced.\n\nAllen, 83, claims the company is in breach of contract as it did not distribute his 2017 movie A Rainy Day In New York and is said to have abandoned a four-film production and distribution agreement.\n\nRead more\n\nWoody Allen says he should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement\n\nThe director is accused of abusing his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992 – a claim which he strongly denies.\n\nIn legal papers lodged in New York, lawyers representing Allen described the allegations as “baseless” and said they were “well known” to both Amazon and the public when the deal was signed, adding: “It does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract.”\n\nDylan Farrow and her mother Mia Farrow, who was Allen’s longtime partner, have made the claims of abuse for more than 20 years, but no charges have ever been brought against Allen.\n\n‘Negative publicity’\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Manhattan, states Amazon Studios’ associate general counsel, Ajay Patel, wrote in a 19 June email that they “cannot continue in business” because of the negative publicity.\n\nLawyers for the director argue the publicity does not justify Amazon walking away from the contract.\n\nA Rainy Day In New York was completed in 2017 but has been shelved. It stars Timothee Chalamet, Elle Fanning, Selena Gomez and Jude Law.\n\nActors regret working with him\n\nChalamet admitted he regretted working on the film last year. In an Instagram post he wrote: “I have been asked in a few recent interviews about my decision to work on a film with Woody Allen last summer. I’m not able to answer the question directly because of contractual obligations.\n\n“But what I can say is this: I don’t want to profit from my work on the film, and to that end, I am going to donate my entire salary to three charities: Time’s Up, the LGBT Centre in New York, and Rainn [the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network].\n\nHe added: “I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all the people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.”\n\nActress and director Greta Gerwig also expressed regret for working with Allen. She told The New York Times last year: “I can only speak for myself and what I’ve come to is this: If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film. I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.\n\n“Dylan Farrow’s two different pieces made me realise that I increased another woman’s pain, and I was heartbroken by that realisation. I grew up on his movies, and they have informed me as an artist, and I cannot change that fact now, but I can make different decisions moving forward.”\n\nOther stars who have featured in his past films have also spoken publicly denouncing the director and their decision to work with him – including Rebecca Hall, Ellen Page, Peter Sarsgaard, Mira Sorvino, Colin Firth and Evan Rachel Wood.\n\nAllen is a four-time Academy Award winner, including the best director Oscar for 1977’s Annie Hall.\n\nOther films include 1979’s Manhattan, 1986’s Hannah and Her Sisters and 1989’s Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA"
