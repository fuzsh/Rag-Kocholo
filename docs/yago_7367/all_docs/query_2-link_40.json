        "text": "Film director Woody Allen has said he should be the “poster boy” for #MeToo as he spoke out in support of the movement against sexual harassment and assault.\n\nAllen – known for films such as Annie Hall and Manhattan – described himself as a “big advocate” for #MeToo in an interview with Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata.\n\nHe said he should be the movement’s poster boy because he had worked with hundreds of actresses and they had never “suggested any impropriety”.\n\n‘Not one has ever suggested impropriety’\n\nSpeaking to the journalist in New York, he said: “It’s funny, I should be the poster boy for the #Metoo movement because I’ve worked in movies for 50 years, I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses… and not a single one, big ones, famous ones, have ever, ever, suggested any kind of impropriety at all.\n\n“I’m in principle, and in spirit, completely in favour of their bringing to justice genuine harassers.\n\n“Now, if innocent ones get swept up in there, that’s very sad for the person, it’s unjust, but otherwise, I think it’s a very good thing to expose harassment.”\n\nThe director also spoke of his frustration that his name gets linked to cases where men are accused of misconduct.\n\nHe has long denied allegations made in 2014 by his daughter, Dylan Farrow, that he molested her in 1992 when she was seven. He was investigated but not charged.\n\n‘What bothers me is that I get linked in with them’\n\nA number of actors have since distanced themselves from Allen, raising questions about the future of the prolific filmmaker in a Hollywood newly sensitive to allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nEarlier this year, Mira Sorvino published a public apology to Farrow, saying she was sorry for “turning a blind eye” to Farrow’s accusations against Allen. She also vowed never to work with him again. Sorvino starred in Allen’s Mighty Aphrodite.\n\nAllen said: “What bothers me is that I get linked in with them.\n\n“People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse, and abuse, and abuse, and I, who was only accused by one woman, in a child custody case, which was looked at, and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Press Association."
