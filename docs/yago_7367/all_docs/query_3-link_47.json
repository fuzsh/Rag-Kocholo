        "text": "With the goal of releasing six to eight films per year, Paul Hudson and Peter Peterson recently unveiled the launch slate for their new distrution company, Outsider Pictures. The principles said in an announcement that they plan to release dramatic and documentary films in the U.S., Cananda and Latin America. First up for the conmpany is Spiro Taraviras‘ doc “Buzz,” about screenwriter A.I. Bezzerides.\n\nAlso on the slate is Robert Connolly‘s “Three Dollars” starring David Wenham, Frances O’Connor and Sarah Wynter, the film is described in an announcement as the story of “a decent man in an indecent world (that) illustrates how many people in modern society are just one paycheck away from the street.” In mid-September the company plans to release Randall Rubin and Jon Schroder‘s “Jimmy and Judy,” starring Edward Furlong, Rachael Bella and William Sadler. The film is described as the story of “a hellish Romeo-and-Juliet romance between a couple of teens who meet and fall dangerously in love. As they hit the road together, the two take on drug dealers, sexual mischievousness, violence, and a whirlwind of trouble brought on by one bad decision after another.” And also on tap is the release of Barbara Willis Sweete‘s “Five Days in September – The Rebirth of an Orchestra.”\n\n“We’re really excited about our eclectic slate,” said Peterson, in a statement. “There is a strong interest in documentaries and independent films in the U.S. right now, and we are going to try and capitalize on that.” Hudson added in his statement, “Movies have always been our passion and Outsider Pictures allows us to play a part in bringing independent and foreign films to theatres across the country.”"
