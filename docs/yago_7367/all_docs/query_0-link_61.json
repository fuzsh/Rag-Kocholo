        "text": "Dating back to 100 B.C., the Nazca lines have been called the « Eighth Wonder of the World. »\n\nSome 250 miles south of Lima, Peru, not far from the shores of the Pacific Ocean, there is a great arid plane — the site of one of the world’s oldest mysteries.\n\nAcross 170 square miles of flat earth, the hard red soil is broken only by a series of strange furrows. They aren’t deep — usually breaking just six to twelve or so inches into the ground — and most aren’t especially wide. The majority span just a foot or so of dry ground.\n\nBut they are long. Some trenches go on for as much as 30 miles, slicing great parallel lines across the desert. Others turn in on themselves, spiraling like the whorls of a giant’s fingerprint. And some seem to follow no discernible pattern at all.\n\nThe first travelers who stumbled upon them in the 1500s thought they were the remnants of roads — vast, complicated roads from a bygone civilization.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1927 that the truth was discovered. Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejía Xesspe was making his way up a series of nearby hills when he glanced down and saw the furrows in the valley below.\n\nThe desert grooves, he realized, weren’t the ruins of ancient roads at all. They were a set of massive images, symbols carved into the earth, so big that they were unrecognizable from ground level.\n\nSo began almost a century of investigation as archeologists and amateur enthusiasts alike tried to make sense of one of the world’s greatest mysteries: the Nazca lines.\n\n[Front page image : Paul Williams/FlickrThe Condor, one of the 70 plant and animal geoglyphs or “ground drawings” that make up Peru’s Nazca lines.]\n\nDid Aliens Create Peru’s Nazca Lines?\n\nDiego Delso/Wikimedia CommonsA Nazca biomorph depicting a monkey.\n\nGiven the astonishing size and complexity of the designs in Peru’s Rio Grande de Nasca river basin, it comes as no surprise that supernatural explanations of the symbols have been popular.\n\nProponents of paranormal theories claim that the Nazca, the indigenous people credited with creating the lines some two thousand years ago, couldn’t possibly have etched the designs in the earth without being able to fly. It’s only from directly overhead, they say, that some of the designs are truly visible.\n\nAliens are a popular choice for their helpers. Others say the Nazca built the lines themselves but with extraterrestrial instructions, perhaps to create landing strips and runways for alien spacecraft, or to attract aliens with images big enough to be visible from space.\n\nAs evidence, fans of the alien theory point to some of the more unusual Nazca biomorphs — the name for the etchings that depict forms found in nature, like humans, insects, birds, fish, trees, and flowers.\n\nA popular example is the biomorph called “the astronaut,” a human figure with a bulbous head like a man in a space suit.\n\nilkerender/FlickrA humanoid figure nicknamed “the astronaut.”\n\nSwiss author Erich von Däniken was convinced some of the biomorphs depict aliens themselves, an idea he popularized in his 1968 book Chariots of the Gods.\n\nThe book catapulted Peru’s Nazca lines to prominence among conspiracy theorists, and the discovery of Nazca bodies only fed the legend.\n\nThe Nazca, who inhabited the arid valleys of the Rio Grande de Nasca river basin from around 100 BCE to 800 CE, practiced mummification. As a result, archeologists have found a number of well-preserved bodies — sometimes in unusual conditions.\n\nMost notable is a distinct and unnatural elongation of the skull in some of the corpses.\n\nThen, too, there was the mysterious three-fingered mummy, which made a splash in June of 2017 as excited researchers announced their belief that this latest body might not be human at all.\n\nThe Truth About The Nazca Lines\n\nWikimedia CommonsThe elongated skulls of the Paracas, an ancient civilization that slightly predated the Nazca in the Rio Grande de Nasca river basin.\n\nSo did aliens play a role in the creation of the Nazca lines? Probably not.\n\nEven if you’re inclined to believe in the existence of aliens who visit earth, there’s not a lot of reason to suspect they had a hand in this particular mystery.\n\nThat’s because when it comes to the “how” of the Nazca lines, there’s not really anything left to solve.\n\nUnlike the pyramids and Stonehenge, which both raise lingering questions about how the ancients who built them achieved such technologically difficult feats, the Nazca lines can clearly be made with technology available before the Common Era.\n\nDiego Delso/Wikimedia CommonsA Nazca depiction of a spider.\n\nThe Nazca simply raked back the top layer of rocky soil, which thousands of years of weathering had turned a deep brownish red, to reveal the lighter yellow sand underneath. The difference in coloration creates distinctive lines that are visible for miles.\n\nTo get the proportions of their designs right, the Nazca could have created small models, then used stakes (some of which have been found) and ropes to scale them up.\n\nWhile the Nazca lines look best from the window of an airplane, all of them are also perfectly visible from elevated land, like the plain’s surrounding foothills — including the one Peruvian archaeologist Xesspe was hiking up when he spotted the glyphs. The Nazca could have easily directed operations or checked much of their work from nearby hills.\n\nEven the designs’ longevity is easily explained. The plain the Nazca inhabited is so arid that it is almost weatherless; few winds disturb its soil, and the region’s average precipitation tops out at 4 millimeters per year. As a result, furrows dug thousands of years ago have remained virtually untouched.\n\nNo alien intervention was needed, either during construction or after.\n\nDiego Delso/Wikimedia CommonsPeru’s Nazca lines don’t only depict animals — this glyph is a stylized tree.\n\nAs for the “astronaut” biomorph, it’s also known by another name: the giant. It’s not hard to imagine that the Nazca stylized their images of people in the same way they deviated from reality with their animals — by enlarging some portions (like the head) and shrinking others.\n\nBut what about the bodies?\n\nArcheologists have a pretty good fix on those too.\n\nThe three-fingered mummy is widely believed to be a hoax cobbled together by forgers from real mummified Nazca remains.\n\nPeter van der Sluijs/Wikimedia CommonsA Nazca cemetery like the one thieves are suspected of raiding to create the three-fingered Nazca hoax mummy.\n\nThe elongated skulls of the Nazca mummies are absolutely real — but they, like the Nazca lines themselves, are the work of human hands.\n\nThe Nazca performed what archeologists call artificial cranial deformation, a practice that involves binding the skulls of infants when they’re pliable to create an altered skull shape that lasts into adulthood.\n\nIt’s a practice found among ancient peoples around the world, thought to have been used as a kind of in-group marker to differentiate a tribe from outsiders, or perhaps as a signal of social status within a tribe.\n\nResearchers think it’s unlikely to have affected cognitive capacity or health.\n\nThe Real Mystery Of Peru’s Desert Drawings\n\nDiego Delso/Wikimedia CommonsA Nazca depiction of a whale.\n\nThough it’s clear how Peru’s Nazca lines were made, one thing remains a mystery: why?\n\nIn the years following their discovery, archeologists favored astronomical explanations.\n\nPaul Kosok and Maria Reiche, some of the earliest to study the lines, hypothesized that the furrows had been made to indicate the places on the horizon where the sun and moon would rise and set on important holidays, like a kind of enormous calendar.\n\nThe geoglyphs were thought to represent earthly constellations like the ones in the night sky.\n\nIn recent years, however, scholars have begun to doubt astronomical interpretations of the marks, pointing to the fact that most of the lines aren’t easily tied to celestial happenings.https://www.youtube.com/embed/Spvn_BGCLa0?feature=oembedAn aerial view of some of the new lines recently discovered with the help of drones.\n\n.\n\nNational Geographic’s Johan Reinhard thinks it’s more likely the lines were markers of the sites of religious rituals, especially those centered around water.\n\nIn such a dry climate, water would have been a going concern for the Nazca — a preoccupation some archeologists see in the biomorphs the ancient people chose to carve into the earth.\n\nDiego Delso/Wikimedia CommonsA stylized hummingbird of impressive size.\n\nSpiders, in many Andean cultures, are associated with rain, and animals like monkeys and hummingbirds would have appeared in nearby jungles — where water was plentiful.\n\nIt’s almost impossible to know why the Nazca built the lines without more evidence. Researchers, however, are hopeful that with the advent of new technology, especially high-tech drones like the ones Peruvian archeologists used to discover 50 new lines in 2018, answers are just around the corner.\n\nAll it takes is a fresh perspective.\n\nAfter learning about the mysterious Nazca lines of Peru, read up on why some people think Ancient Sumerians were visited by aliens.
