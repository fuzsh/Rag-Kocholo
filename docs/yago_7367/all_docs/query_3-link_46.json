        "text": "​PRESS\n\nLeonardo possesses a unique spirit and is a virtuoso extraordinaire on the violin…the spirit of the age inhabits him. By this I mean he is a citizen of the world, a modern man in the truest sense. In fact he shows us how easily we can communicate across cultures if the desire and effort are there.\n\n- Wynton Marsalis, Artistic Director Jazz at Lincoln Center\n\nFernando Suarez Paz played with delicious clarity and passion.\n\n- New York Times\n\n​\n\nPersonifies and embodies the authentic spirit of Tango.\n\n​- LARAS, Latin GRAMMY-Awards Live\n\nHis knowledge of the tango violin playing conveys a century of individual styles.\n\n- The STRAD Magazine\n\nThe harmonically sophisticated arrangements by Leonardo Suárez Paz are superb, as is his sardonic Milonga de los monsters – an unlikely yet happy marriage of Prokofiev and tango nuevo.\n\n- GRAMOPHONE, UK Andrew Farach-Colton\n\n​Leonardo Suarez Paz is Tango Royalty\" \"powerful and sensual\" \"Few other musics, if any, move so comfortably on the dance floor or stand so proudly on the concert stage.\n\n​Leonardo Suarez Paz is tango royalty. His father Fernando played violin with Astor Piazzolla, the great tango composer and bandoneon player.

Some of the composer's spirit seems to have seeped into the next generation.\n\n​\n\n\"A Schubertian pianism gives way to a dramatic Weill-esque flair..\" \"The instrumental introduction to \"Oblivion\" is one of Suárez Paz's finer moments... Original and rather operatic piece of modernism composed by Suárez Paz .. opens with a kind of minty cadenza for violin and cello, and goes on to pay tribute to the great Astor Piazzolla..\n\n- Seattle PI\n\nA standout.\n\nA must-have.\n\nMasters of Bandoneon is the closest most of us will ever come to being in the same room with this many legends of Tango! Excellent tango and classical players.\n\n- Cleveland Classical, Cuartetango String Quartet\n\n​Leonardo Suarez Paz - Tango Master of the 21st Century.\n\n- LATINA, Japan\n\n​A jewel.\n\n- Victor Hugo Morales, Radio Continental Interview\n\nLeonardo Suarez Paz.... one of the names of the best tango legacy - the precise evidence that the tango history is still being written.\n\n- Diario Critica de la Argentina, Jorge Lanata\n\n​Rich and wonderful ..... artfully unflinching.

His strong voice (he sings as well as he plays) sold the lyrics, and articulated tango performance’s very soul.”\n\n- Greenwich Citizen, Symphony Review\n\n​Leonardo Suarez-Paz, could hardly have been anything but a tango player. Born in Buenos Aires and now a New Yorker, Suarez-Paz is Tango Royalty. With his dark good looks and impeccable manners, Suarez-Paz might himself be a screen star someday, especially given that the start of his American career could have come right out of an MGM backstage musical.\n\n- Erie Times-News, John Chacona\n\nLeonardo has such an amazing professional legacy and authenticity. He and the musicians and dancers of Cuartetango bring us an exceptional live sexy performance.\n\n- The Patriot News, Teri Guerrisi, director of the HACC Performing Arts Series\n\nSuarez Paz’s father, a brilliant tango violinist, had been one of Piazzolla’s principal collaborators, and from the first bar it was clear that the father and the son were made of the same stuff.\n\n- JAZZIZ Magazine, Cuartetango in Birdland\n\nA young Argentinean violinist played on Saturday in New York with a guitarist Jim Hall, a living jazz legend. He even sang. The violinist is the son and a colleague of Fernando, a celebrated instrumentalist of Astor Piazzolla, played crossover with a jazz star, Jim Hall. It was incredible. Leonardo Suarez Paz has been living in New York for five years. He is dedicated to what he likes most of all: music. He is 30 years old and does everything. Among other things, he writes arrangements for the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, records music for films, and leads his two tango groups and one jazz group. The night on Saturday was his night. Jim Hall presented him very emotionally as a new talent.\n\n- CLARIN “It was Incredible,” Fernanda Iglesias"
