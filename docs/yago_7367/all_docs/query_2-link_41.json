        "text": "Woody Allen has granted himself the dubious distinction of “poster boy” for the #MeToo movement. In a recent interview with journalist Jorge Lanata, the controversial director discussed the growing anti-sexual-misconduct movement—saying that while he supports the mission, he also really wishes people would stop mentioning him in the same breath with the Harvey Weinsteins of the world. (Allen’s estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, has accused him of sexually abusing her as a child; Allen has repeatedly denied the allegations.)\n\n“I’m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,” Allen said. “I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it’s a good thing that they’re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement, because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses, hundreds, and not a single one—big ones, famous ones, ones starting out—have ever, ever, not a single one, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all.”\n\nHe continued, adding that “in any situation where anyone is accused of something unjustly, this is a sad thing. I think everybody would agree with that. Everyone wants justice to be done. If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people that do all these terrible things. And I think that’s a good thing. What bothers me is that I get linked in with them. People who have been accused by 20 women, 50 women, 100 women of abuse and abuse and abuse—and I, who was only accused by one woman in a child-custody case which was looked at and proven to be untrue, I get lumped in with these people.”\n\nAllen also noted that he’s created “wonderful roles” for women, has hired numerous women to work behind the scenes on his films, and has always paid his female stars equally. “So I’m very much on their side and in their corner and feel part of that,” he said.\n\nHe also once again issued a denial of Farrow’s allegations. “Of course not, this is just so crazy,” he said. “This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago. . . . For it to come back now, I mean, my god. It’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of.”\n\nFarrow has not let up on her claims, which have resulted in numerous stars saying they are no longer willing to work with Allen. Stars like Greta Gerwig, Michael Caine, Colin Firth, and Natalie Portman have all pledged that they’ll no longer make movies with him, while stars like Rebecca Hall and Timothée Chalamet have donated their salaries from his last film to charitable causes, including the Time’s Up fund. Penélope Cruz and Cate Blanchett, who both won Oscars for their work with Allen, have been slightly more neutral, calling for the Farrow case to be examined again by legal experts. And others still have decided against giving the director the cold shoulder. Cruz’s husband, Javier Bardem, said he is not ashamed of working with Allen, while Scarlett Johansson, who’s made three films with the director, reportedly had dinner with him on Friday.\n\nBehind the Scenes at Diane Keaton's A.F.I.
