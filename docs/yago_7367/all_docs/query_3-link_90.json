        "text": "Woody Allen has no regrets about a controversial statement he made in 2018 about how he believes he should be the “poster boy” for the #MeToo movement. Amazon later cited these comments, which earned backlash at the time, in its defense when Allen sued the streamer for $68 million.\n\nStill, Allen recently told France 24 that he stands by his words: “I should be” the movement’s poster boy, he reiterated.\n\n“Not at all,” he replied when asked if he regretted those remarks. “I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses, not one of them has ever complained about me; not a single complaint. I’ve employed women in the top capacities, in every capacity. For years we’ve always paid them exactly the equal of men. I’ve done everything that the #MeToo movement would love to achieve.”\n\nAllen originally made his remarks in a 2018 interview with Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata. “I’m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,” Allen said at the time. “I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it’s a good thing that they’re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement, because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses, hundreds, and not a single one—big ones, famous ones, ones starting out—have ever, ever, not a single one, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all.”\n\nDylan Farrow, Allen’s estranged adopted daughter, has long accused him of sexually molesting her as a child. Allen has repeatedly denied the claims. Still, Farrow’s allegations have earned her support from actors like Natalie Portman and Reese Witherspoon. Actors like Colin Firth and Ellen Page have said they will no longer work with Allen in the future, though not every member of Hollywood’s A-list has turned against him; actor Scarlett Johansson, for instance, recently threw her support behind Allen. “I love Woody,” she told the Hollywood Reporter this week. “I believe him, and I would work with him anytime.”\n\nFarrow penned a quick response to Johansson on Twitter following the THR story. “Because if we’ve learned anything from the past two years it’s that you definitely should believe male predators who ‘maintain their innocence’ without question,” she wrote. “Scarlett has a long way to go in understanding the issue she claims to champion.”\n\nAllen sat down for the France 24 interview to promote his film A Rainy Day in New York, starring Timothée Chalamet and Elle Fanning. Both stars have since distanced themselves from the project, which was dropped by Amazon and later picked up by international distributors; it made its debut this summer in Poland. Allen is currently embroiled in a $68 million lawsuit against Amazon, after the streamer broke off its four-picture agreement with the director. Amazon has named Allen‘s #MeToo comments as part of the reason the company could no longer work with the polarizing director.\n\nIn the France 24 interview, Allen shrugged off concerns that he has lost the favor of Hollywood. “I couldn’t care less,” he said. “I’ve never worked in Hollywood, I always work in New York…. If tomorrow nobody would finance my films and nobody would finance my theater plays or nobody would publish my books or anything, I’d still get up and write because that’s what I do. I will always work. What happens to it commercially is another matter.”\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— How intimacy coordinators are changing Hollywood sex scenes\n\n— The Crown’s Helena Bonham Carter on her “scary” encounter with Princess Margaret\n\n— The Trump-baiting Anthony Scaramucci interview that roiled the president\n\n— What happens when you try to be the next Game of Thrones\n\n— Why are teens flocking to Jake Gyllenhaal’s Broadway show?\n\n— From the Archive: Keanu Reeves, young and restless\n\nmatch point\n\nScarlett Johansson Believes Woody Allen, “Would Work With Him Anytime”\n\nThe actor, who has made several films with the controversial director, doubles down on her defense of him.\n\nallegations\n\nDylan Farrow Slams Scarlett Johansson Over Woody Allen Comments\n\nWhen asked what she thinks of the director, Johansson said she believes Allen when he denies Farrow’s allegations of sexual abuse, and added, “I would work with him anytime.”\n\nthe latest\n\n“One Battle in a Big Old War”: Where Woody Allen’s Amazon Lawsuit Goes Next\n\nHere’s why a judge just dismissed several claims in Allen’s $68 million suit.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Trumpworld Is Coping With the Kamala Harris Boom\n\nIn just days, the vice president has raked in more than $100 million, scored countless endorsements, started a social media phenomenon, and secured enough delegates for the nomination. “She has been totally dominating,” marveled one GOP strategist.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden.
