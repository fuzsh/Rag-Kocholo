        "text": "The life of Wanda Nara and Mauro Icardi never seems to take a break.\n\nIt is a relationship of ups and downs which always seems to be in the news, and it's happened once again following a new leak regarding their life as a couple.\n\nThis time it was journalist Jorge Lanata who shared news on national television regarding the terms that the influencer, model and businesswoman set for her partner Mauro Icardi. As a result, we now know what would happen if the Argentine footballer commits a new slip up in their relationship.\n\nThe contract that Wanda Nara put pen to paper would see her receive several million dollars as compensation should Icardi be unfaithful to her.\n\nWanda: 200 women have passed through that mattress\n\nA few days ago Wanda shared some intimate details on her and Icardi's relationship.\n\nIn fact, she recounted her experience about a house where Icardi lived before having a partner.\n\n\"About 200 women must have passed through that mattress, but after me the mattress was completely destroyed. The mattress no longer served him,\" said Wanda Nara.\n\nWanda Nara and Mauro Icardi married in June 2014. A few days ago it was revealed that, despite the numerous controversies during their relationship, they have decided to renew their vows.\n\nThe model confirmed the new marriage proposal in an interview with Gente magazine. A 'gift' she came up with as a way to celebrate.\n\n\"He proposed after ten years together. We haven't decided anything yet, but it was beautiful to receive his proposal,\" she said."
