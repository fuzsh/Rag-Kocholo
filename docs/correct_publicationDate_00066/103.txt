Biography: Mary Shelley is best known for writing the Gothic novel "Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus" (1818). She was the daughter of political philosopher William Godwin and feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft.

Shelley's mother died shortly after her birth, and as a result she had an unconventional upbringing. She was educated informally by her father and exposed to radical politics and literature from a young age.

In 1814, Shelley eloped with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, which led to both societal disapproval and financial hardship. During a summer spent with Lord Byron and John Polidori in Geneva in 1816, she conceived the idea for "Frankenstein."

After moving to Italy in 1818, Shelley faced personal tragedies, including the deaths of two children and her husband's drowning in 1822. She returned to England and focused on her writing career, producing several further novels and editing her late husband's works.
