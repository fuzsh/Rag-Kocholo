For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nContents\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThemes\n\nEssay Planning\n\nEssay Topics\n\nResources\n\n1. Historical Context\n\nKennedyâs anthology of fifteen short stories, Like a House on Fire, explores the impacts of familial and social issues on an individualâs sense of identity and humanity, illustrating the vast spectrum of human condition. Having lived a majority of her life in Victoria, Australia, Kennedyâs collection follows the stories of various protagonists whose voices are characteristic of Australian culture and society. As the text is set in the backdrop of rapid Australian modernisation, the novel also depicts the paradoxical nature of technology, as various characters are depicted to be torn between confronting or embracing this fundamental change. Despite approaching the stories of characters conflicted by modern and social challenges with both humour and cynicism, Kennedyâs lack of judgement is notable; it is with this empathetic stance that she is able to the universal nature of human emotions to her readership.Â\n\n2. Themes\n\nIdentity\n\nKennedy explores the theme of identity mainly through physical injury, as various characters with physical trauma find themselves to be agonisingly limited within the confines of their condition. In Like a House on Fire, the narratorâs sense of identity becomes intertwined with his subsequently decreased masculinity, as his back injury leaves him unable to physically take care of his family, and his wife begins to undertake stereotypically masculine roles within the household. In tandem with this, Roleyâs wife in Little Plastic Shipwreck is rendered humourless and witless due to her brain injury, distorting her once enthusiastic self into one shadowed by her illness; further emphasising the link between physical and mental identity.Â\n\nOrder and Disorder\n\nThe inherent tension between order and chaos is continually examined throughout the anthology, particularly in Like a House on Fire, in which perfectionistic order and scatter minded disorder are embodied in the unnamed narrator and his wife respectively. As the two individuals are unable to establish a compromise between their contrasting personalities, Kennedy suggests that this lack of cooperation is the core reason for the deterioration of their marriage, and their subsequent misery. The notion of disorder is also symbolised by the domestic setting itself, as Kennedy depicts various characters who feel pervasive ennui and dissatisfaction within the âchaotic messâ of their household environments.\n\nLonging\n\nEach protagonist in the collection is portrayed as possessing some object of longing, whether it be material or emotional. Kennedy utilises scattered verses of prose within her writing to communicate these human desires, building upon their significance poetically. In Static, Anthony attempts to negotiate his own wishes with those of his wife and family, leading him to wonder whether anything present in his life has been created by his own will or merely his eagerness to please others. His desire for various types of happiness, embodied in material concepts such as money or children, suggest that the human condition is built upon the foundation of dissatisfaction; that innate longing is what ultimately defines us as human.\n\nLove\n\nThe theme of love is present in each story of the collection, often used as an instrument through which the characters can heal and grow from their physical or spiritual pain. While suggesting that true love endures all hardship in Like a House on Fire, Kennedy also illustrates the various sacrifices one must make in order to protect the ones you love. Such is depicted in Five-Dollar Family, as a new mother makes the difficult decision of leaving her âloserâ boyfriend to give her child a chance at the best life possible, despite the unfortunate situation he has been born into.Â\n\nCommunication\n\nThe vital importance of communication within families is emphasised in the anthology, as the lack of effective communication perceivably exacerbates dysfunctional relationships. The crushing regret of a son is explored in Ashes, as he laments his lack of communication with his father who he can no longer speak to. However, Kennedy empathetically depicts the difficulty of communicating potentially painful messages to loved ones in Waiting, as the protagonist anxiously agonises over the prospect of telling her husband that she may have another miscarriage following an excruciating string of lost children.Â\n\nEmpathy\n\nIn tandem with longing, Kennedy asserts that empathy is vital to the survival and happiness of a human being. This notion is aptly depicted in Little Plastic Shipwreck, in which the death of Samson the popular show dolphin results in Roleyâs revelation of his managerâs complete lack of empathy, and subsequently the abundance of his own. Similarly, the salient importance of empathy is emphasised in Flexion, as the cold-heated and harsh victim of a brutal tractor incident repairs his marriage by allowing himself to feel more empathy for those who have supported his recovery and been understanding of his bitterness.Â\n\nFamily\n\nThe anthology centres around the concept of family, as both dramatic events unfold directly due to altercations and misunderstanding within the household. By depicting both the dramatic and mundane events that contribute to creating dysfunctional families, Kennedy asserts that kindness and understanding is vital to the maintenance of a healthy and loving family. The power of family is also depicted in Like a House on Fire, as the protagonistâs dissatisfaction with life is instantly washed away by the actions of his children, who remind him that despite his life-threatening injury, his family is his constant source of love and support.Â\n\nâ\n\nIf you'd like to see how themes like these can be identified and analysed in one of Kennedy's short stories, you might like to check out our Close Analysis Of 'Cake' From Like A House On Fire blog post!\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\n3. Essay Planning\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nQuestion 1: âGender plays no role in the tragic identities of the characters in Like a House on Fire.â To what extent do you agree?\n\nSuggested contention: Despite the ubiquitous nature of hardship, the short stories of Like a House on Fire explore the effect of gender roles on individualsâ sense of self-worth.\n\nBody paragraph 1:Â\n\nPain is depicted to have no partiality to either gender in Like a House on Fire.Â\n\nMuch of the trauma explored throughout the anthology is a result of lack of emotional connection or familial misunderstanding arising through individual actions, rather than due to stereotypes associated with gender.Â\n\nKennedy suggests that there is no gender more at fault for these issues, but rather that it is mindset that determines oneâs identity and fate, especially in relationships. For example, just as the protagonistâs wife in Flexion makes the mistake of cruelly wielding her physical dominance over her husband, the passive boyfriend in Five-Dollar Family is cruel in his apathy toward his girlfriend and their newborn baby.Â Â Â Â Â\n\nBody paragraph 2:Â\n\nDespite this, Kennedy explores the social views that plague men as a result of their gender, compelling to limit their identity to meet these fatal expectations.Â\n\nThe concept of masculinity is explored throughout the collection, often presented as an inferiority complex for many male protagonists due to their physical disabilities. The societal idea that men should be physically strong in order to be able to provide for his family is heavily condemned in Like a House on Fire, as Kennedy depicts the destructive consequences of such on oneâs sense of self-worth.Â\n\nFor example, the narrator of Like a House on Fire perceives his own physical weakness as unmanly, and subsequently himself as an unfit and useless father. As he is unable to pick up theÂ familyâs Christmas tree, the tree seller looks towards him with disdainful judgment, perceiving the protagonistâs wife lifting the tree to be âdestroying the social fabricâ.Â\n\nIn addition to this, the narratorâs extreme attempt to physically help the family results in the destruction of the precious family nativity scene, symbolising the idea that social constructs of masculinity inevitably ends in destruction, as the narratorâs inability to recognise his physical limitations only exacerbates the problem.Â\n\nBody paragraph 3:Â\n\nIn tandem with this, the collection of short stories also examines the social limitations placed upon women solely due to their gender.Â\n\nThe difficulty for women to balance their roles of mother and career woman is explored in Cake, in which the protagonist Liz fails to separate one from the other, leading her to feel dissatisfaction in both. Kennedy ostensibly denounces the social expectations of women to be domestic helpers, as Liz faces judgement at work for bearing a child, whereas her husband is exempt from any judgement despite it also being his son.Â\n\nThe complicated and personal concept of pregnancy is further depicted in Waiting, as the protagonist agonises over the fact that she may lose another child due to a miscarriage. As the fear of disappointing others takes over her own pain and anguish, readers of the collection are invited to consider the harrowing expectations placed on women to be successful mothers.Â\n\nQuestion 2: âLike a House on Fire shows that family relationships are never perfect.â Do you agree?\n\nSuggested contention: Through the constant depiction of dysfunctional families in Like a House on Fire, Kennedy asserts the importance of communication and empathy in repairing broken relationships, and suggests that perfect families are unrealistic.Â\n\nBody paragraph 1:Â\n\nEvery story in the collection depicts a family undergoing some kind of hardship, whether it be financial, emotional or spiritual. Through her depiction of broken families, Kennedy suggests that emotional stress and tension within families is sometimes inevitable, even in a loving and supportive environment.Â\n\nThe title of the collection, Like a House on Fire, is emblematic of the dual nature of families, as while the phrase symbolises the chaos and disorder of oneâs family dynamic, it also symbolises the love and extreme passion that often coexists alongside it.Â\n\nFor example, while the protagonist in Like a House on Fire reminisces upon the âfieryâ sexual and emotional happiness of their marriage, he also deplores their current period of domestic stress, describing it as a âhouse on fireâ.Â\n\nBody paragraph 2:Â\n\nKennedy depicts the need for family members to engage in open and honest communication with one another to overcome the effects of trauma.Â\n\nFor example, in Ashes, Chris is only able to find closure by finally understanding the mindset off his parents through effective communication. His newly found ability to express his true emotions to his mother allows him to finally perceive the grief that was masked by her supposedly âcruelâ actions, and subsequently finally achieve a stable relationship with her.Â\n\nBody paragraph 3:Â\n\nKennedy also advocates for the exercise of empathy between family members in order to find harmony within dysfunction.Â\n\nThis is apparent in Flexion, in which the seemingly emotionless protagonist and his wife undergo their respective journeys of expressing empathy for the other. As their marriage significantly improves due to their increased understanding of each other, Kennedy promotes the importance of vulnerability and openness within families.Â\n\nBeyond the Basics:Â\n\nHow does Kennedyâs short story format add to the readerâs understanding of the themes uncovered in the novel?Â\n\nThe range of diverse, Australian voices depicted in the anthology work to portray the vast spectrum of the human condition.Â\n\nThe concise narrative present in each of the fifteen stories work to provide the readership with an extremely personal point of view that emphasises the emotions and mindset of the protagonist, furthering the sense of authorial empathy and compassion.Â\n\nIt is through this almost voyeuristic advantage we subsequently possess as readers, that we are able to fully understand the depth of each characterâs humanity and sense of identity, as well as the various struggles that follow the course of an individualâs life.\n\nKennedyâs ordering of the short stories also contributes to the readerâs depth of understanding. There is no apparent chronological order present in the collection, but rather a varied order of stories, depicting its diverse range of voices. For example, while the key themes and tones of the anthology remain consistent throughout, other factors such as age, gender and life experience of the protagonist vary in order to provide contrasting character viewpoints.Â\n\nAs such, this variation in narrative voice allows Kennedy to present her stories as universal human experiences, emphasising the ubiquitous nature of the themes present in Like a House on Fire.Â\n\nFinally, the varied structure within each individual story lends an optimistic tone that underscores the entirety of Kennedyâs work. While some stories such as Flexion begin with the inciting event, others emphasise the chain of events that occur in leading up to the key event, as depicted in Ashes. As the undertones of hope and faith are present throughout the collection, the varied plot structure of each story allows Kennedy to assert that no matter the circumstance of hardship, one can always find a glimpse of optimism within its depths.Â\n\nIf you'd like to see another essay topic breakdown, you might like to check out our Like a House on Fire Essay Topic Breakdown blog post!\n\n4.

Gail and Wesley, Davidâs parents, attempt to enlist the help of Wesleyâs brother Frank, a well-respected doctor in the community. However, Marie reacts to this idea with fear, anxiety and resistance. Gail concludes that something sinister must be happening for her to have such a reaction and she presses Marie for why she is so afraid. Marie then reveals to Gail that she has heard that Dr Frank has been sexually abusing many of his female Native American patients. Gail immediately confides in Wesley who is both the Sheriff of their town and Frankâs brother. This becomes the central source of tension, as Wes must decide between his duty as the Sheriff and his loyalty to his family.\n\nThis is all told from the perspective of David, our protagonist, who has to watch his father confront his Uncle Frank about these taboo accusations. Eventually, it seems they reach an agreement with Frank to stop the abuse.\n\nMarie is discovered dead the next day in her bed when Gail goes to check up on her. Later that night, David admits to his parents that he saw Frank go into their home in the afternoon and immediately, Wesley concludes that Frank âis guilty as sinâ for murdering Marie. As the Sheriff of the town, Wesley is obligated to arrest Frank, but in order to spare Frank the embarrassment, he keeps Frank in their basement instead of sending him to jail. Â\n\nUpon hearing this news, Davidâs grandfather, Julian, orders Wesley to release Frank. Julian accuses Wesley of arresting him out of jealousy and he threatens to use his power within the community to set Frank free. At this point, Wesley realises that the power of his father would only be matched by the law, and he decides that he must officially prosecute his brother.\n\nThat next day, David, Wes and Gail wake up to find Frank dead, having used broken glass to slit his wrists and commit suicide. Young David believes that this was the right action and hopes that everything would go back to normal. But as the story goes, this is not the case.\n\nThemes\n\nPrejudice, discrimination and the abuse of power\n\nAnother key theme is prejudice, discrimination and the abuse of power. Frankâs abuse of the Native American women is both an abuse of his power and responsibilities as a Doctor and a way to take advantage of his personal belief in White âracial superiority.â Julian and Frank embody the toxic, violent and bigoted mentality prevalent during that time period, which Watson deplores as reprimandable and unacceptable. Even at the novelâs close, Frankâs death is symbolic in two ways. Firstly, it means that Frank managed to escape persecution, public denouncement and jail time. But more importantly, he is still revered in the community as a ârespected manâ and a âwar hero. '' Therefore, while he physically passes away, his âlegacyâ and faÃ§ade of heroism remains alive.\n\nLaw vs Justice\n\nOne of the central themes of âMontana 1948â is the conflict between abiding by the law and doing what is just. Due to the institutionalised racism that existed in the 1940âs, Frankâs actions were not considered technically illegal, however, by intuitive standards of morality, his rape of Natives in his practice and his subsequent murder of Marie clearly warrant punishment. Thus, Watson touches on the failures of the judicial system to consistently hand out judgements that are morally fair and instead reveals the flaws within the legal system of the time that reflect widespread and corrupt social attitudes.\n\nLoyalty vs Morality\n\nWatson also touches on the conflict between loyalty and morality. This, as we know, forms the crux of narrativeâs tension. Should Wes arrest and prosecute his brother Frank or not? Should he stay loyal to his family or uphold the moral values that he must stand by as the towns Sheriff? Gail, Davidâs mother, embodies all the virtues of morality that we all stand by and she is appalled by Frankâs behaviour and demands that he be persecuted regardless of his relationship with Wes. In sharp contrast, Julian believes that Frank can be excused for his actions because the victims were merely âred meatâ Native American women who he views as subhuman.\n\nâ\n\nCharactersÂ\n\nGail:\n\nGail is Davidâs mother and Wesleyâs wife. She is a compassionate, idealistic and courageous woman. This can also be seen as she stands up for Marie, despite the prejudices in the society at the time. She also spends a âgood deal of energyâ protecting herself and her family.Â She also doesnât take part in Wesleyâs racist jokes. For example, when Wesley makes a joke about Marie, ânever been to anyone but the tribal medicine manâ, David responds with âmy mother didnât laugh.â\n\nDavid:\n\nDavid is Wesley and Gailâs son and is the narrator of the text. He doesnât share Wesleyâs beliefs surrounding race and forms his own moral perspective. This is demonstrated when he makes a fuss about wanting to wear moccasins (which Gail sides with him on) while his father says will make him âas flat-footed and lazy as an Indian.âÂ\n\nUnlike his father, we donât see David conflicted with his loyalties and he is particularly critical of his father. This is best demonstrated when he âwas beginning to already think of Uncle Frank as a criminalâ upon hearing sexual assault accusations against Frank. When Wesley spares Gail the details of his investigation into Frank, David believes it could be because he is âtrying to protect his brother and keeping the number of witnesses to the accounts of his crime to a minimumâ. After Wesley arrests Frank and takes him to the basement for imprisonment, David assumes his father killed Frank despite Wesley not being depicted as a particularly violent person in the novel.Â All it takes is an indistinct noise from the basement for David to conjure up ways his father could have killed his Uncle Frank.\n\nFrank:\n\nFrank is Wesleyâs brother and is described as a âwitty and charmingâ doctor, and war hero who is widely loved by the community -particularly by his dad, Julian. In reality, Frank is a criminal who abuses his power - both a white man and a doctor to sexually assault Indian women - which he believes he can get away with.Â This is compounded when he states, âI am not concerned about social progress.â Through Frank, Watson demonstrates how some individuals can abuse their positions of power and privilege, and to not lose any sleep over it (âat smiling ease with his life and everything itâ).\n\nWesley:\n\nWesley is Julianâs son, Gailâs husband, and Davidâs father and the sheriff of Mercer county. He dislikes Native Americans and frequently makes jokes about them and stereotypes them. He even uses the fact that Marie Little Soldiers is a Native American to belittle and doubt the credibility of her experience.Â\n\nWesleyâs conflicting loyalties become more complex and difficult once you consider the prejudices at the time, his job as an officer of the law, Frankâs station in the family and community, Gailâs strong opinions and his constant need to seek validation from his father. An instance that mirrors Wesleyâs conflicting loyalties is when he tells Gail, âI wish you wouldnât have told the sheriff.â When she told informed him of Marieâs sexual assault allegations against Frank. However, in Wesleyâs eyes, Frankâs murder of Marie Little Soldier, is where the latter crosses the line. The magnitude of his brotherâs crime is too large for him to let his previous conflicting loyalties as a sheriff and a brother hold him back from arresting Frank. After convicting Frank and having to argue about it with his father, we learned âfor the first time how this experience with his brother was ruining him physically.âÂ\n\nJulian:\n\nJulian is a bigoted racist man who has an unconditional love for his son Frank and unfairly favours him over his son Wesley. When he learns of Franks charges he exclaims, âWhat kind of bullshit is this?â He belittles the sexual assaults as Frank just âfeeling them upâ and âassaulting an Indianâ. At this point, Julian taking Frankâs side exposes how irrationally loyal he is to his son and suggests that even if the women were not Indian, he may still stand by Frank's actions. He protests that the only reason Wesley convicted Frank was that âever since the war, ever since Frank came home in uniform and he [Wesley] stayed here [home],â heâs âbeen jealousâ. However, this comment seems to say more about Julianâs feelings than Wesleyâs - perhaps, this is why Julain felt this inclination towards Frank. After this argument, we see Wesleyâs feeling of defeat and heartbreak - that despite Frank being a murderer and a rapist, his father still seemed to pick his side over Wesleyâs.Â\n\nQuotesÂ\n\nQuotes on Prejudices, Discrimination and the Abuse of Power\n\nâHe wears those and soon he'll be as flat-footed and lazy as an Indian\" - Discrimination is evident in Montana 1948 where Wesley uses stereotypes of Indians to imply they are inferior to them, and that David shouldnât be like them.\n\n\"She's an Indian- Why would she tell the truth?âÂ Â\n\nâYour mother and I thought weâd have more to show than just one grandchild â¦ and white- we want them we want them whiteâ\n\nâScrewing an Indian. Or feeling her up or whatever. You donât lock up a man for that.â\n\nâYou know Frankâs always been partial to red meat.âÂ Â\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nâWesley, your brother is raping these women. These girls. These Indian girls.â\n\nQuotes on Law vs Justice\n\nâWhy did my grandfather first run for sheriff? â¦ He wanted, he needed power. He was a dominating man who drew sustenance and strength from controlling others.â This quote shows that many people in society at the time held positions of power such as lawyers or sheriff but didnât enforce the law or worry about the morality of their actions. Thus creating an unjust legal system that would allow these people to shape how the law is enforced with their own prejudices.\n\nâYou know what your Grandad said it means to be a peace officer in Montana? He said it means knowing when to look and when to look away.âÂ Â\n\nâI think the problem has been taken care of. Frank said heâs going to cut it outâ\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nQuotes on Loyalty vs Morality\n\n\"David, I believe that in this world people must pay for their crimes. It doesn't matter who you are or who your relations are; if you do wrong, you pay. I believe that. I have to.\"\n\nâI wish you wouldnât have told the sheriff.âÂ\n\nâI think the problem has been taken care of. Frank said heâs going to cut it outâ\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nâYou donât lock up your brother. A respected man. A war hero.â âThis is a legal matter.â âBullsh*t.â âThen why have you got him locked up here and not over at the jail? This is your brother here. My son!â\n\nQuotes on Destruction of Innocence\n\n'I had gone back into the house -to the kitchen, to my room, out the backdoor, I had left the porch and followed frank's steps down the front walk - I never would have heard the conversation between my father and mother, and perhaps I would have lived my life with an illusion about my family and perhaps the human communityâ - page 33\n\nâThe shock of hearing this about Uncle Frank was doubled because my mother was saying these words. Rape. Breasts. Penis. These were words I never heard my mother use-ever- and Iâm sure her stammer was not only from emotion but also from the strain on her vocabulary.â\n\nâBut I was on a trail that would lead me out of my childhood.â\n\nâ\n\nWith contributions from Fae Saberi.\n\nLast updated 20/10/19\n\nPlanning is an essential part of any successful text response essay. It helps you ensure that youâre answering the prompt, utilising enough quotes and writing the most unique and perceptive analysis possible! The hard part of this is that you only have about FIVE MINUTES to plan each essay in the Year 12 English examâ¦ (more info on the best way to tackle that challenge in this video!)\n\nSo, I developed the FIVE TYPES of essay prompts to help students streamline their planning process and maximise every minute of their SACs and exams.\n\nBy identifying the type of prompt youâre being challenged with immediately, a number of parameters or guidelines are already set in place. For a specific type of prompt, you have specific criteria to meet â for example, in a metalanguage-based prompt, you immediately know that any evidence you brainstorm in your planning stage should be based around the literary techniques used in your given text.\n\nIf youâd like the full picture on our best FREE advice on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response here.\n\nâ\n\n1. Theme-Based Prompt\n\nâAmbition in the play Macbeth leads to success.â Discuss. (Macbeth)\n\nWhen youâre presented with a theme-based prompt, you can automatically shift your brainstorming and planning towards the themes mentioned in the prompt along with any others that you can link to the core theme in some way.\n\nIn regard to this Macbeth prompt, for example, you could explore the different ways the theme of ambition is presented in the text. Additionally, the themes of guilt and power are intimately related to ambition in the text, so you can use those other ideas to aid your brainstorming and get you a step ahead of the rest of the state come exam day.\n\n2. Character-Based Prompt\n\nâFrankensteinâs hubris is what punishes him.â Discuss. (Frankenstein)\n\nThese prompts are pretty easy to spot â if you see a characterâs name in the prompt, there you have it; you have a character-based prompt on your hands.\n\nOnce you know this, you can assume that each example you brainstorm has to be relevant to the specific character named in the prompt in some way. Also, you can explore how the actions of characters donât occur in isolation â theyâre almost always interrelated. Remember, however, that the actions of characters are always connected to the themes and ideas the author is trying to convey.\n\nThis type of prompt also grants you some freedoms that other types donât give. For example, unlike a Theme-based prompt, a character-based prompt means that itâs perfectly fine to write about characters in the topic sentences of your body paragraphs.\n\n3. How-Based Prompt\n\nâHow does Grenville showcase Rookeâs inner conflict in The Lieutenant?â (The Lieutenant)\n\nUnlike other prompts, the âHowâ positions you to focus more on the authorâs writing intentions. This can be achieved by discussing metalanguage â language that describes language (read my blog post about it here). These prompts tell you immediately that you need to be thinking about the literary techniques explored in the text and explain how they affect the narrative.\n\nRather than using specific techniques to frame your specific arguments, itâs best to use them as evidence to support arguments that attack the main themes/ideas mentioned in the prompt.\n\n4. Metalanguage or Film-Technique-Based Prompt\n\nâHitchcockâs use of film techniques offers an unnerving viewing experienceâ. Discuss. (Rear Window)\n\nThis type of prompt is very similar to How-based prompts, specifically in the fact that the discussion of literary techniques is essential.\n\nFor this type of prompt specifically, however, the actual techniques used can form more of a basis for your arguments, unlike in How-based prompts.\n\n5. Quote-Based Prompt\n\nâOut, damned spot!â How does Shakespeare explore the burden of a guilty conscience in Macbeth? (Macbeth)\n\nCountless students ask me every year, âWhat do I do when thereâs a quote in the prompt?!â My reply to these questions is actually fairly straightforward!\n\nThere are two main things that you should do when presented with this type of prompt. Firstly, contextualise the quote in your essay and try to use it in your analysis in some way. Secondly, interpret the themes and issues addressed in the quote and implement these into your discussion. The best place to do both of these is in a body paragraph â it weaves in seamlessly and allows for a good amount of analysis, among other reasons!\n\nWhen faced with unknown prompts in a SAC or your exam, it's reassuring to have a formulaic breakdown of the prompt so that your brain immediately starts categorising the prompt - which of the 5 types of prompts does this one in front of me fall into? To learn more about brainstorming, planning, essay structures for Text Response, read our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâ\n\nWondering what VCAA examiners might be looking for in a high-scoring essay? Each year, the VCE EAL Examination Reports shed light on some of the features that examiners are looking for inÂ high-scoring responses for the Listening and Language Analysis sections of the EAL exams. Let's go through 5 key points from the reports so that you know how to achieve a 10/10 yourself.\n\nFor advice on how you can apply the VCE EAL Examination Reports to strengthen your skills in the listening section, see Tips on EAL Listening.\n\nTip #1 Analyse How the Overall Argument Was StructuredÂ\n\nLetâs take the 2017 VCAA EAL Examination Report as an example:Â\n\nâThe highest-scoring responses analysed argument use and language in an integrated way. Some responses used a comparative approach that analysed arguments and counter arguments from both texts in the same paragraph. However, only comparatively few responses focused on how the overall argument was structured.â\n\nSo how do we write about/analyse âhow the overall argument was structuredâ?Â\n\nTo save time during the exam, we can adopt templates that can help us transfer our thoughts into words in a fast and efficient way.Â You can construct your own templates, and you may want to have various templates for various scenarios or essays. Below, I have provided a sample template and Iâll show you how you can use this template in your own essays.\n\nSample Template\n\n(AUTHOR)âs manner of argument is proposed in real earnest in an attempt to convince the readers of the validity of his/her proposal of...by firstâ¦and then supplying solutions to...(DIFFICULTIES), thus structuring it in a logical and systematic way.\n\nThe above template ONLY applies to opinion pieces that satisfy these 2 rules:\n\nThe opinion piece commences by presenting the âbad effect/consequence/situationâ of the topicÂ\n\nThe opinion piece supplies the solution to resolve the âbad effect/consequence/situationâ of the topicÂ\n\nFor example, say the author, John White, contends that plastic bags should be banned and does so by:\n\ncommencing the piece with the fact that plastic bags can travel long distances by wind and water. They litter our landscapes, float around in waterways, and can eventually end up in the oceans, ultimately polluting the ocean and posing a threat to marine animals\n\nthen supplies solution to ban plastic bagsÂ\n\nWhen we use our template here, the intro may look like this - note that Iâve bolded the âtemplateâ parts so you can clearly see how the template has been used:\n\nJohn Whiteâs manner of argument, proposed in real earnest in an effect to convince the readers of the validity of his proposal of banning plastic bags by first exposing the deleterious nature of these bags to our environment and natural habitat and then supplying solutions to ban plastic bags, putting it in effect in a logical and systematic way.\n\nHead to Introductions for EAL Language Analysis for more templates and guidance on how to nail your Language Analysis Introduction.Â\n\nTip #2 Keep the Listening Answer SuccinctÂ\n\nThe 2019 VCAA EAL Examination Report states:Â\n\nâStudents are encouraged to use the key words in the questions as a focus for their listening...Short-answer questions require concise and precise answers. Responses that demonstrated understanding provided what was asked for without including extraneous information.â\n\nSome students tend to add unnecessary information in their answers. Although the answers are correct, they will NOT earn you any extra marks. Listening answers should NOT be a mini essay. Writing irrelevant information will not only waste time but may also compromise the accuracy and overall expression of your response.Â\n\nTip #3 Practice Makes Perfect\n\nThe examination reports frequently point out that students struggle with identifying and describing the tone and delivery. For example, the 2017 VCAA EAL Examination Report states:\n\nâIdentifying tone and delivery is challenging for students and emphasis on this is needed...Students are encouraged to use the key words in the questions as a focus for their listeningâ.Â\n\nThe good news is, just like most skills, listening and identifying the tone can both be improved with practice. In fact, VCAA acknowledges the importance of daily practice as well.Â\n\nâStudents need to develop their critical listening skills both in and outside of the classroom. They are encouraged to listen, in English, to anything that interests them â current affairs, news, documentaries and podcasts can all be useful.â (2017 VCAA EAL Examination Report)\n\nPracticing listening does not necessarily mean sitting down and doing Section A questions; it can be as simple as talking with classmates, teachers, neighbours, friends from work, church, etc.Â\n\nTake a look at our EAL Listening Practice and Resources for a comprehensive list of external resources for practicing listening and a step-by-step guide on how to use them!\n\nTip #4 How To Formulate a Cohesive Response?\n\nVCAA encourages us to write answers that make sense to the reader and are grammatically correct. Make sure you do address, and ONLY address, what the question is asking, because marks will not be rewarded for redundant information.Â\n\nâShort answer questions require concise and precise answers. Responses that demonstrated understanding provided what was asked for without including extraneous information. Expression skills need to be sufficiently controlled to convey meaning accurately.â (2017-2019 VCAA EAL Examination Report)\n\nHINT: This may sound super simple, but a lot of EAL students struggle with it. If you do, you are definitely not alone. Some students seek to use complicated words and/or sentence structures, but we should not compromise clarity over complexity.Â Â\n\nTip #5 Use a Range of Precise VocabularyÂ\n\nVCAA acknowledges the importance of sophisticated vocabulary. This phrase âanalysis expressed with a range of precise vocabularyâ has been repeatedly used to describe high-scoring essays in the examination reports from 2017 onwards\n\nBelow is a list of commonly misspelled, misused and mispronounced words. If you donât know the meaning of a word, check out Collins Online Dictionary for definitions OR you can use a physical copy of the Collins Dictionary (which you are allowed to bring into the exam and SACs).\n\nWords That Look the Same/Have Super Similar Spelling:\n\nAbroad vs. Aboard\n\nAdapt vs. Adopt vs. Adept\n\nAffect vs. Effect\n\nAltar vs. Alter\n\nAngel vs. Angle\n\nAssent vs. Ascent vs. Accent\n\nAural vs. Oral\n\nBaron vs. Barren\n\nBeam vs. Bean\n\nChampion vs. Champagne vs. Campaign\n\nChef vs. Chief\n\nChore vs. Chord\n\nCite vs. Site\n\nCompliment vs. Complement\n\nConfirm vs. Conform\n\nContact vs. Contrast vs. Contract\n\nContend vs. Content\n\nContext vs. Content\n\nCostume vs. Custom\n\nCounsel vs. Council vs. Consul\n\nCrow vs. Cow vs. Crown vs. Clown\n\nDairy vs. Diary\n\nDecent vs. Descent vs. Descend\n\nDessert vs. Desert\n\nDose vs. Doze\n\nDrawn vs. Draw vs. Drown\n\nExtensive vs. Intensive\n\nImplicit vs. Explicit\n\nIn accord with vs. In accordance with\n\nLater vs. Latter\n\nPray vs. Prey\n\nPrecede vs. Proceed\n\nPrincipal vs. Principle\n\nSweet vs. Sweat\n\nQuite vs. Quiet\n\nFor an overview of the EAL study design plus tips and tricks for reading comprehension, time management and more, check out The Ultimate Guide to EAL.\n\nCan you believe itâs already 2021? To kick off the year in VCE English, youâll probably be working on your Oral Presentation sometime soon. The past year has flown by, but so much has happened in that year - there are plenty of juicy and controversial topics to get stuck into for your SAC.\n\nEach heading below represents a broad topic and each subheading under it takes you into more specific debates. A more precise topic can make your speech more engaging and current, so feel free to pick a broad issue that resonates with you but donât forget to zoom in on more specific questions too.\n\nIf you havenât already, check out our Ultimate Guide to Oral Presentations for some general tips and tricks to get you started!\n\nCOVID-19\n\n1. Working From Home\n\nICYMI, thereâs been this global pandemic going around for about a year now. Itâll probably come up in a few speeches this year, but letâs work through some more specific ways of using it in yours.\n\nFirst up is working from home. In 2020, a lot of people spent a lot of time working from home - but this hasnât been possible for everyone, meaning that it could be worsening certain forms of inequality. âEssential workersâ like supermarket clerks and delivery drivers have not been able to work from home, which might put them at a disadvantage when it comes to the flexibility or even the conditions of their work. Conversely, a âtax on remote workersâ has been proposed which would see people pay a 5% tax if they chose to work from home instead.\n\nIs working from home all that itâs chalked up to be? Is it a positive sign of flexibility, or a widening gap between the manual working class and white-collar professionals? What can we learn about working from home now that we can apply to the future? Is it the environmentally responsible thing to do?\n\nThe hidden impact of the coronavirus pandemic is rising urban inequality â 26/11/2020\n\nâRebound in carbon emissions expected in 2021 after fall caused by Covid â 11/12/2020\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nAll workplaces, especially those with essential manual or physical labour, should provide paid health and safety training to staff who are for example more at risk of disease\n\nA working from home tax is a bad idea - it encourages people to commute and pollute. We should look to ways of promoting flexibility and sustainability instead\n\nCasual workers in manual professions should be given paid sick leave and other entitlements to make their jobs as flexible as remote office workers\n\n2. Education\n\nYou mightâve spent 2020 learning from home too. Everything happened pretty quickly right at the start of the year, but as the months wore on it became clearer that some students were adjusting better than others. In particular, âdigital exclusionâ became a big problem for many students around the country. Inequality is once again a big theme: access to the internet and other technology is vastly uneven, and students who were already dealing with things like mental ill-health were set further back by remote learning. Even though the Victorian government applied special considerations to all Year 12 students in 2020, this is far from a long-term fix.\n\nWhat can be done about the education system to make it fairer, or even just to make it work better for you? Is it an issue with technology, or are there underlying problems around, say, mental health and wellbeing? Maybe itâs time to axe the ATAR system - would a new scoring system solve these problems?\n\nCoronavirus kept Victorian students out of class. This is what we know about long-term effects of school closures â 21/09/2020\n\nâGovernment must address barriers to education in rural and remote areas, inquiry finds â 12/11/2020\n\nâThe ATAR Benefits No-One: Reflections of a âHigh-Achieverâ â 02/11/2020 (yes this is a shameless plug for my own piece)\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nThe government should supply public schools with tech for every student, including iPads and broadband devices\n\nThe government should implement a needs-based approach to technology in schools\n\nSchools need engagement staff as well as teaching staff: COVID-19 has shown just how easy it is for students to disconnect\n\nReplace the ATAR with something that measures skills and interests, rather than just results\n\nThe Climate Crisis\n\n1. The Paris Agreement\n\nThe Paris Agreement is an international agreement that was signed a little over five years ago. It binds every country to a commitment of carbon neutrality by 2050 - this means that everyone will be taking as much CO2 out of the atmosphere as we emit. Part of the Agreement is that countries have to commit to new, increasingly ambitious plans every five years, and this deadline has just passed.\n\nHow did we do, you might ask. While the mid-century goal still stands, the five-year increment isnât looking fantastic - most countries, including Australia, havenât strengthened their climate targets. The Prime Minister was even snubbed out of a speaking slot at a UN climate summit, some suggest because of his inaction on climate. None of this has really snatched headlines though.\n\nIs this something that youâve been following? If not, is it a problem that this news isnât really getting out there? What can Australia do better with regard to the climate crisis?\n\nThe Paris agreement five years on: is it strong enough to avert climate catastrophe? â 08/12/2020\n\nâThe Paris Agreement 5 years on: big coal exporters like Australia face a reckoning â 14/12/2020\n\nâAustralia records fourth hottest year as it risks being isolated globally on climate change â 05/01/2021\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nAustralia needs to be proactive on the Paris Agreement, rather than doing the bare minimum\n\nAustralia needs to transition away from coal\n\nOur countryâs lack of climate action is a great source of shame, particularly for young Australians who want a better future\n\nThe Australian media should take the climate crisis more seriously\n\n2. Environmental Racism\n\nOne aspect of the climate crisis weâre starting to talk about more now is environmental racism. The term started in the US, where it was used to describe the disproportionate impacts of environmental problems like pollution on working class people of colour. That doesnât mean it doesnât apply in Australia though - earlier in 2020, a sacred Aboriginal site was blasted by Rio Tinto in order to expand a mine. Now, taxpayer money is being set aside for fracking in the Northern Territory. This will have an adverse impact on not only the climate, but also the local water quality on which First Nations communities depend.\n\nWhat can be done about environmental racism? Is it about making changes in government, or about activism from outside the halls of power? If environmental racism is the problem, is there a solution that can tackle both problems at once? Is it even accurate to refer to them as two separate problems?\n\nThe young Indigenous woman fighting fracking in remote NT â 11/11/2020\n\nâ$50 Million Hand-Out to Northern Territory Frackers â 17/12/2020\n\nâFighting not just to survive, but to flourish â 21/12/2020\n\nâMaking sense of Australiaâs climate exceptionalism â 01/01/2021\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nIndigenous land rights is not just a social movement: it could help us avoid environmental disaster as well\n\nPoliticians are too reliant on fossil fuel companies: we need more grassroots activism around climate justice\n\nFracking is dangerous, its impacts disproportionately affect BIPOC communities and as such it should be banned\n\n3. A Carbon Price?\n\nThis topic was kind of on our 2020 topic list, but the debate around climate action has changed a little bit since. A carbon price would make the atmosphere a commodity basically - corporations would have to pay in order to pollute.\n\nBut maybe thatâs still giving them too much power? If you can just pay your way out of environmental responsibility, whoâs to stop you from polluting? Maybe there isnât a capitalistic or free-market solution to carbon emissions - maybe we need to rethink our entire relationship with land and country. What can and should Australia learn from its First People in this regard?\n\nAustraliaâs plants and animals have long been used without Indigenous consent. Now Queensland has taken a stand â 16/09/2020\n\nââAs an Australian it will affect you. Itâs your land as wellâ: Indigenous tourismâs new online travel agency â 03/12/2020\n\nâWhat is cultural burning? â 31/12/2020\n\nâThe barriers to a carbon fee and dividend policy â 07/01/2021\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nA carbon price is still necessary, but itâs a stepping stone in a larger conversation\n\nPutting a price on excessive pollution isnât the same as creating laws to prevent it: as such, it is no longer enough\n\nRace\n\n1. First Nations Justice\n\nYou might recall the huge impact that George Floydâs death had on conversations about race around the world. Though this erupted in a wave of furore last June, the conversation has been shifting ever since. In Australia, weâve been grappling in particular with First Nations justice. While the Prime Ministerâs made attempts to unify the country through certain words and gestures, First Nations leaders such as Lidia Thorpe, the first Indigenous senator from Victoria, have been calling for something more substantive. In the meantime, police brutality against First Nations people continues.\n\nWhere to from here? What does the future of First Nations justice look like in Australia, and what is the role of leaders like Ms Thorpe? Where do non-Aboriginal folks fit into this? What could we do better?\n\nLidia Thorpe: Victoria's first Aboriginal senator urges end to deaths in custody and mass incarceration â 09/09/2020\n\nââWe have the fight in usâ: Lidia Thorpeâs incredible journey to historic place in the Victorian Senate â 23/09/2020\n\nâ'Unfinished business': Senator Lidia Thorpe on fighting for Treaty for Indigenous Australians â 10/12/2020\n\nâCan we breathe? â 31/12/2020\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nReconciliation is an outdated term; it implies two parties are coming together as equals, when history would tell us otherwise\n\nLidia Thorpeâs election is the first step in a longer journey towards representation, truth-telling and self-determination\n\nEven after the #BlackLivesMatter movement in 2020, we still a long way to go with anti-racism\n\nAustralia is far from a multicultural utopia: we need to learn to treat politicians like Lidia Thorpe with more respect\n\n2. Refugees\n\nIn 2019, the âmedevacâ bill allowed refugees to be brought to mainland Australia for medical care. That bill has since been repealed, but it did allow some refugees to leave their detention centres and receive medical treatment. 60 of them have now been detained in various Melbourne hotels for over a year now. In December, they were moved to a former COVID-19 quarantine hotel, where they will continue to be isolated and detained.\n\nWhat injustices (plural) are going on here? Did medevac force us to confront our out-of-sight-out-of-mind asylum seeker policy? And if this isnât the impetus we need to shut offshore detention once and for all, what exactly will it take?\n\nThe Mantra 60 should be freed from torture. Hereâs why the Coalition wonât do it â 15/12/2020\n\nâFormer mayor among protesters arrested as police escort refugees and asylum seekers to new Melbourne hotel â 17/12/2020\n\nâRefugees and asylum seekers moved from Mantra hotel in Melbourne â 17/12/2020\n\nââWe are human, we are not animalsâ: Mantra refugees transferred to another hotel â 17/12/2020\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nBring back medevac: it was a bare minimum policy to begin with, and itâs unconscionable that it would be repealed, thereby denying sick people healthcare\n\nAustraliaâs refugee policy is as lazy as it is harmful: something needs to change\n\nThe hotel industry is profiting off detention and we should consider boycotting chains like Mantra\n\n3. COVID-Related Racism\n\nThis couldâve gone in the first section, but it poses important questions about ongoing and future race relations in Australia. During 2020, Asian Australians and particularly those with Chinese heritage experienced a sharp increase in racially-provoked harassment. Towards the end of the year, Chinese Australians were asked in a Senate committee hearing to condemn the Chinese Communist Party, which many have described as race-baiting. Many Australians with Chinese heritage have no relation to the Chinese government, so itâs jarring that theyâd be called upon to give an opinion like this.\n\nHow does race still impact civic life in Australia? If youâre Australian, should you be expected to have opinions about or deny loyalties to foreign governments? Does it matter what race you are, and if so, how is that problematic?\n\nChinese Australians say questions from Senator Eric Abetz about their loyalties are not asked of other communities â 15/10/2020\n\nâEric Abetz refuses to apologise for demanding Chinese-Australians denounce Communist party â 16/10/2020\n\nâMore than eight in 10 Asian Australians report discrimination during coronavirus pandemic â 02/11/2020\n\nâToo many men in pin-striped suits â 10/12/2020 (this is an interesting one that also touches on gender and class in civic life)\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nPoliticians are increasingly out of touch with Australiaâs diverse communities because they are just so overwhelmingly undiverse\n\nAgain, Australia is not a multicultural utopia. When times get tough, the racism really jumps out\n\nAustralians are yet to confront the reality that there are Chinese Australians (which sounds like a joke, but based on these articles isnât really a joke) - their behaviour continues to âotherâ people who actually really are Australian, telling them they somehow donât belong\n\nMore people of colour should run for public office; this starts with civic empowerment in schools\n\nThe Media\n\n1. Representation\n\nAs it turns out, journalism isnât a very diverse profession. When issues about disability come up, for example, theyâre often covered by abled journalists in a âpity partyâ or âinspiration pornâ manner. When issues about race come up, itâs also often white people who cover them, usually with racist undertones as well. We started seeing a bit of this in 2020: the stories that kept coming up about people breaking COVID restrictions were often targeting minorities - their names and faces would be splashed across newspaper front pages, while their white counterparts were afforded privacy and forgiven for making a mistake.\n\nHow fair is the media landscape towards people from minority backgrounds? What different forms might racism and ableism take in the media, and how can we overcome them? Is it as simple as allowing disabled people to tell their own stories, for example?\n\nMuslims, Chinese Australians and Indigenous people most targeted in racist media coverage â 11/11/2020\n\nââDouble standardâ: Experts weigh in on publicly shaming only certain COVID rule-breakers â 22/12/2020\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nThe media landscape isnât fair towards minorities: stereotypes can be subtle but persistent\n\nJournalism schools should create more scholarships for diverse applicants\n\nAustralian media should adopt a code of ethics around representation of minorities\n\n2. Youth\n\nThis may or may not come as a surprise to you, but young people are also one of the groups that are likely to be underrepresented in the media. A report from the Foundation for Young Australians found that there were not only less stories about young people in the media in 2020, but barely half of them actually quoted a young person.\n\nAgain, we return to questions around representation - does the media have an ethical obligation to let young people tell their own stories? How much do you, as a young person, trust the media to accurately depict you? What can be done about this?\n\nYoung People Have Been Pretty Much Ignored By The Media During COVID â 28/10/2020\n\nâResearch Report: mainstream media either ignores young Australians or castigates them â 21/12/2020\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nYoung people can no longer trust the media, and this is detrimental to civic society\n\nThere needs to be a national youth broadcaster, kind of like the ABC, run by young people for young people\n\n3. Murdoch\n\nRemember Kevin Rudd? The former Prime Minister has been making waves recently for starting a parliamentary petition for a royal commission into media diversity. The petition was signed by a record 501,876 people, and it looks like the commission - a bit like a government inquiry - will go ahead. The âmedia diversityâ in question isnât about race or disability though - itâs more about media ownership. In Australia, Rupert Murdoch owns almost two-thirds of metropolitan media circulation. Heâs also a climate sceptic, which means a large chunk of his media output is also climate-sceptic.\n\nWhat is the role of media in democracy, and can it still fulfill that role if one person gets to own so much of it? What are some ways Murdoch has used his influence, and what have been the consequences for the Australian people? What should the royal commission look to now achieve?\n\nPetition calling for media royal commission and setting Australian record tabled in Parliament â 09/11/2020\n\nâRudd and Turnbull will be called to give evidence at Senate inquiry into media diversity â 11/11/2020Â\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nBecause the media holds government to account in the eyes of the people, one person owning this much of the media gives them too much power\n\nAustraliaâs climate inaction is a direct result of Murdochâs media empire, and we need to break it apart to get honest debate and coverage\n\nPop Culture\n\n1. Sia\n\nIn December 2020, the Australian singer Sia was caught in a bit of Twitter beef. She defended casting Maddie Ziegler, an abled actress, in a disabled role for her upcoming film. Disability justice activists argued that autistic people should be able to portray themselves, and that roles for autistic people should be written by them as well. Sia later admitted this was âableismâ, but didnât back down on her decision.\n\nWhat is the appropriate way for celebrities and creatives to approach representation? Without debating anyoneâs actual identity, how can the film industry do better here?\n\nSia opens up about lashing out on Twitter to defend her new film â 19/12/2020Â\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nAbled people shouldnât write roles for disabled people, nor should they play these roles; if a disabled person canât play the role, then it isnât appropriate in the first place\n\nCancel culture isnât a thing, given how comfortable Sia feels admitting to ableism and then committing to her decision anyway\n\nWe shouldnât cancel people, but we still need new ways to really hold them to account: otherwise, they can still get away with discrimination\n\n2. Grammys\n\nThe Grammy Awards have been oft-criticised for racial biases, including once again in this yearâs coming ceremony. Black artists like Beyonce are often relegated to subcategories like R&B and rap - of her 24 Grammy Awards, only one was awarded in a major category (Best Music Video in 2017 for âFormationâ). Meanwhile, she was arguably snubbed for Album of the Year wins in both 2017 (Adele won) and 2015 (Beck won). Now though, the Grammys are hoping to #ChangeMusic and acknowledge the contributions of Black artists to the industry.Â\n\nWhat should this look like? Are award wins all it will take? Is a change for the future enough to fix wrongs of the past? Maybe awards arenât even that important - is cultural impact what really matters?\n\n#ChangeMusic Roadmap aims to redress racism in music industry â 17/12/2020Â\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nThe cultural impact of Bla(c)k artists canât be measured through awards\n\nAwards are a necessary first step to acknowledging Bla(c)k talent in the music industry\n\nRadios stations should make more of an effort to diversify their sets, particularly when local BIPOC talent in Australia is at an all-time high (think Thelma Plum, Sampa the Great etc.)\n\nBe sure to check out our Ultimate Guide to Oral Presentations for more advice on how to write your speech, presentation tips and more. Or, if you really want to dive in further to make sure you absolutely nail your Oral, then you'll definitely want to check out our How To Write A Killer Oral Presentation ebook - it explores essay structure, the written explanation and even has sample A+ essays so that you can learn from past students who have succeeded in VCE!!\n\nFor many VCE Students, Language Analysis is most commonly their âweakestâ section out of all three parts of VCE English. Throughout my years of tutoring, when Iâve asked these studentsÂ whyÂ theyÂ struggle, theyÂ usually blame the difficulty in grasping theÂ mostÂ important component of Language Analysis:\n\nUnderstandingÂ howÂ Â the authorÂ intendsÂ to persuade their readers.Â\n\nYouâll see that I have italicised the words, âhowâ and âintendsâ in the above statement to highlight where your focus needs to be.Â If youâre currently trying to get your head around Language Analysis, or if you donât understand where youâre going wrong, donât worry. Weâre going to look at the incorrect assumptions students make about Language Analysis, how to avoid it and also what youÂ shouldÂ do instead! So first, letâs have a look at aÂ couple of common studentÂ errors. Students (including yourself perhaps)Â may believeÂ that:\n\n1. Language Analysis is aboutÂ findingÂ language techniques that persuade readers.\n\nStop right there! This certainly isnât a treasure hunt (but that would be pretty awesome right?). If an essay was just about identifying language techniques, everyone would get an A+ (we wish!). Once youâve had some practice under your belt, youâll notice that anyone can find rhetorical questions, inclusive language and statistics, so there is a lot more to it than simply pointing outÂ language techniques. Also, steer clear from throwingÂ in all the possible language techniques youâve found in an article too, because itâs not a competition about who can find the most techniques and even if you did, it doesnât guarantee you an amazing score on your essay.\n\n2. Language analysis is aboutÂ ifÂ authors successfully persuade their readers.\n\nSorry to tell you, but this definitely isnât it either. Our job as the student isnât toÂ figure out whether or not the author successfullyÂ persuades their reader. You canât really speak for all the people reading an article if they do or do not agree with the authorâs contention. Just like if you see an advertisement on television for MacDonalds, you canât tell if the next person who watches the ad will be persuaded to go out and buy a Big Mac meal.Â Thatâs why at the end of the day, itâs not up to you to figure out the extent to which the author persuades their readers.Â So in that case, what should you be doing instead?\n\nThe ultimate goal is to demonstrate your understanding of how the author attempts to persuade the reader to agree with his or her contention.\n\nLetâs break up the essential parts of analysing language so we can pinpoint exactly theÂ part that is most problematicÂ and also how we can finally get a strong grasp of how to be successful in this area:\n\nTheÂ TEEÂ rule\n\nÂTechniqueÂ â whatÂ persuasive techniqueÂ is used?\n\nÂExampleÂ â whichÂ textÂ that shows it?\n\nÂEffectÂ â what is theÂ intended impactÂ on readersâ attitudes?\n\n1. TechniqueÂ\n\nThere are so many persuasive techniques around, once youâve got your hands on a bunch of language technique lists then youâre pretty much set in this area. Be wary however, as I have mentioned in the past(and above)Â how simply âlabellingâ language techniques is not enough for you to do well in language analysis.\n\n2. Example\n\nThis is quite frankly, the easiest part of Language Analysis! All you need to do is quote your evidence! Straightforward? If quoting is not your forte, you can check out:Â how to embed quotes in your essay like a boss\n\n3.Â EffectÂ\n\nOk, this is the core of most studentsâ issues. We already know that the author is trying to persuade readers but here, weâre going to look how their choice of words or phrases creates a certainÂ effectÂ on readers so that they will be encouraged to agree with the author. When thinking about the effect, the best way is to put yourself in the readerâs shoes â you are after all, a reader! So in order to understand the effect think about the following three points:\n\nWhat readers may feel â emotions\n\nWhat readersÂ may think â thoughts\n\nAnd what readers may want â wishes\n\nExample 1:Â âYou are my smartest friend, Iâm really stuck on this question and I need help!â\n\nÂThink about it realistically. If someone said this to you, how would you feel? There mustâve been a time where you were complimented (whether it be about your clothes, how you did something well, or how friendly you are with others), and you used this experience to your advantage. Each time you analyse a language technique, contemplate on what emotions, thoughts or wishes emerge as a result.Â When someone gives you a compliment,Â you probably feel flattered, or maybe evenÂ proud. And this is exactly what you need to include in your analysis!Â You should garner these everyday experiences as a trigger to help you understand how readers may respond to a certain technique. So if we broke it down via the TEE formula:\n\nTechnique:Â Compliment\n\nÂExample:Â âYou are my smartest friend, Iâm really stuck on this question and I need help!â\n\nÂEffect: You feel feel proud and as a result want to assist your friend.\n\nAnd letâs put it all together coherently and concisely:\n\nAnalysis:Â The compliment, âYou are my smartest friend, Iâm really stuck on this question and I need help!â encourages the listener to feel a sense of pride and this in turn, may encourage them to assist their friend.\n\nExample 2:Â âThe pet puppy was stuck inside a car on a 32 degree summer day, with no windows left open, and no room for fresh air.â\n\nAgain, think about the three points â how do you feel? What do you think of this scenario? What do you want as a result? You probably feel sorry for the puppy and want to save it from this situation.\n\nÂTechnique: Appeal to sympathy\n\nÂExample: âThe pet puppy was stuck inside a car on a 32 degree summer day, with no windows left open, and no room for fresh air.â\n\nÂEffect: You may feelÂ that it is unfair for the puppy to be in such a horrendous and potentially life-threatening situation.\n\nAnd letâs put it all together coherently and concisely:\n\nAnalysis:Â Through the appeal to sympathy, âthe pet puppy was stuck inside a car on a 32 degree summer day, with no windows left open, and no room for fresh airâ, readers may believe that it is unfair for the puppy to be subjected to such a horrendous and potentially life-threatening situation and thus, may be persuaded to take action to prevent further harm to pets.\n\nUltimately, focus on the potential effect language can have on the reader and as a result, how this may encourage the readerÂ to agree with the author. If you do that, then youâre definitely on the right track.

Resources to help you prepare for your Oral Presentation\n\nWhat is an Oral Presentation?\n\nFor many VCE English students, the oral presentation is the scariest part of the course; itâs often also the first.\n\nDoing a speech can indeed be dauntingâ youâre marked in real time, you canât go back and edit mistakes, and the writing part itself is only half the battle. Nonetheless, the Oral SAC can also be one of the more dynamic and engaging tasks you complete in VCE English, and thereâs plenty of ways to make it more interesting and also more manageable for yourself.\n\nKeep reading for a comprehensive overview of what you need to know to succeed in your Oral Presentation. Weâve got you covered- from choosing your topic and contention, to writing and presenting your Speech.\n\nWeâll also be suggesting useful resources, Study Guides and YouTube videos that will provide more detailed information and give you more confidence. Letâs get into it!\n\nWhat are you expected to cover in an Oral Presentation? (Oral Presentation Rubric)\n\n1. Your Oral Presentation SAC has two components. The first is the Oral Presentation itself (âa point of view presented in oral formâ), and the second is a Written Explanation, also known as a Statement of Intention.\n\n2. Your selected topic needs to be an issue that has appeared in the media since 1 September of the previous year\n\n3. Your aim for this entire Oral Presentation SAC is to persuade your audience to agree with your contention (whatever that may be) based off the issue youâve selected.\n\nHereâs the raw version of VCAAâs expectations from you, taken from the VCAA website:\n\nHow to choose your Oral Presentation topic\n\n1.Â Select a topic that has appeared in the media since 1 September of the previous year\n\nThis can be time consuming and tricky, especially if you want to choose something a bit more original or fresh.\n\nFirstly, you need an event.Â An event in the VCE English context is anything that happens which also generates opinionated media coverageâso, itâs not just an event but it has to be an event that people have published opinions about, and they have to have been published since September 1.\n\nYou might wonder why we donât go to the issue straight away. Hereâs a hypothetical to illustrate: if you asked me to name an issue, the best I could probably come up with off the top of my head is climate change. However, if you asked me to name an event, Iâd pretty easily recall the Australian bushfiresâsomething much more concrete which a) has generated specific and passionate opinions in the media; and b) can easily be linked to a wider issue such as climate change.\n\nThe ABC news archive is also really helpful for finding events since you can pick dates or periods of time and see a good mix of news events from then. Otherwise, Wikipedia has helpful pages ofÂ events that happened in specific years in specific countries, so â2023 in Australiaâ might well be a starting point.Â\n\nWhen you have your event, you can then look for an issue. This will be a specific debate that comes out of the event, and can usually be framed as a âwhether-or-notâ question. The bushfires, for example, might generate debate around whether or not the Australian government is doing enough to combat climate change, whether or not Scott Morrison has fulfilled his duties as Prime Minister.\n\nMost importantly, choose an issue from an event thatâs interesting and important to you. After all, youâre going to be spending the time researching, writing and presenting!\n\n2. Filter out the boring events/issues\n\nUnderstand who your audience is.\n\nOnce you know who your audience is, ask yourself: Does this event and issue relate to my audience?\n\nThis question matters because âyour aim of this entire Oral Presentation SAC is to persuade your audience to agree with your contention (whatever that may be) based off the issue youâve selected.â This means that what you say to your audience and how they respond to your speech matters.\n\nEven if your assessor isnât counting exactly how many people are still listening to your speech at the end, everyone knows a powerful speech when theyâre in the presence of one - it hooks the audience from start to end - and an assessor, consciously or subconsciously, cannot deny that the collective attentiveness of the room has an influence on their marking of your Oral Presentation.\n\nThatâs why you should choose a topic that your audience can relate to. Also, avoid topics that have too many unfamiliar words, because as soon as thereâs something they donât understand, it becomes much harder for them to follow your speech.\n\nNow you may be asking yourself; what is the best topic for oral presentation?\n\nHere are some example topics from previous years to give you inspiration:\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2014\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2015\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2016\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2017\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2018\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2019\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2020\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2021\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2022\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2023\n\nFor more detailed information on choosing a topic, read my blog Choosing a WOW topic for your VCE Oral Presentationâ\n\nHow to choose your oral presentation contention\n\nOnce you've chosen an interesting topic and have researched all of its different viewpoints, it's time to formulate your contention.\n\nOften, creating a killer contention is about avoiding some common traps that will make your overall presentation boring, bland and just like the rest of your cohorts'.\n\nSo, there are three things I like to AVOID:\n\n1. Broad, Overarching statements\n\n2. A Contention That Is Just Plain Obvious\n\n3. Avoid A Contention That Is Generally Accepted As True In Todayâs Age\n\nFor more information on writing a contention, read my blog Creating a Killer Contention for your Oral Presentation â\n\nHow to write your speechÂ\n\n1. Have a CAPTIVATING introduction sentence; use a short, clear and powerful sentence.\n\n2. RELATE to your audience so that it keeps them interested so they actually WANT to listen.\n\n3. If you are taking on a persona, firstly study and UNDERSTAND your character.\n\n4. Donât forget your persuasive techniques. I usually use repetition in conjunction with the ârule of threeâ.\n\n5. Remember that you are writing a SPEECH, not an essay. Instil your oral with emotion, varied tone and sentence lengths.\n\nIn fact, I've talked about a few of these in a 'Must Dos and Don'ts' video. If you haven't seen it yet, watch below before you read on.\n\n4 Tips on Presenting Your Speech\n\n1. Body Language\n\nConfidence is key. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and, more importantly donât move your legs. Especially if youâre nervous, swaying or shuffling will be noticeable and make you appear more nervousâwhen you practise, pay attention to the lower half of your body and train it to stay still if possible.\n\nThat being said, do use your arms for gestures. Those are more natural and will help engage the audience, though donât overdo it eitherâusually, holding cue cards in one hand frees up the other but also stops you from going overboard.\n\n2. Eye contact\n\nCue cards brings up another important consideration- eye contact. Hold cue cards in one hand as high as you can without it feeling uncomfortable. This means you donât have to take your eyes away from the audience for too long or too noticeably to check your notes.\n\nEye contact increases your engagement with the audience. It also gives the impression of confidence and that youâve been practicing and know your speech inside and out!\n\n3. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse\n\nIn a best case scenario, you wonât need to rely on your cue cards as you will have your speech basically memorised! Read your speech aloud and pretend that youâre actually delivering your speech. This means:\n\n- Looking up ahead\n\n- Holding the cue cards in the right spot; and\n\n- Not just reading the words, but speaking as if to an audience\n\nÂ Itâs extremely helpful to also practice your speech to an actual audience! Practice in front of your family and friends. An alternative is to put a sticker next to your camera and record yourself. The sticker will help indicate where you should create eye contact. Look back at the video and give yourself some feedback, you might be surprised at your presentation!\n\n4. Tone variation\n\nTone variation involves emphasising certain words, using pauses or slowing down for effect, or modifying volume. Incorporating some of these elements- even writing them into your notes by bolding/italicising/underlining will help you break out of monotony and make the speech more engaging.\n\nBe sure to emphasise emotive language and any evidence you might use to illustrate your arguments. Most importantly, donât speak too quickly!\n\n5 things to keep in mind while writing the written explanation\n\nFor oral presentation based written explanations, the VCAA study design requests students write...\n\n\"A written statement of intention to accompany the studentâs own oral presentation, articulating the intention of decisions made in the planning process, and how these demonstrate understanding of argument and persuasive language.\"\n\nUsing the topic, 'Why we need to stop crying 'cultural appropriation' when cultural exchange is far more important, âletâs see how this can be done with FLAPC with some examples below:\n\n1. Form\n\n2. Language\n\n3. Audience\n\n4. Purpose\n\n5.
