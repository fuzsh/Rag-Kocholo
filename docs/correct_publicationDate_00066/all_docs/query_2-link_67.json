        "text": "” –Laura Demanski, The Baltimore Sun\n\n“An entertaining, detailed and well-researched study of this hitherto enigmatic author.” –Time Out New York\n\n“A warm, lively and minutely detailed account.” –The Economist\n\n“Miranda Seymour understands the monster’s magnetism, and with Mary Shelley offers a book that is part biography, part literary criticism, part social history. It is a scholarly work, soothing in its attention to the smallest details of the lives of the literary and political elite of 19th-century London. It is also a riveting story in its own right.” –Washington Times\n\n“Seymour’s lively writing, penetrating critical insights, and attention to detail elevate this to one of the finest and most significant literary biographies of recent years.” –Library Journal (starred review)\n\n“A splendid biography.” –Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n“Evocative, well researched, as readable as a novel and as utterly compelling as its subject.” –The Sunday Tribune (Ireland)\n\n“Mary Shelley is the most dazzling biography of a female writer to have come my way for a decade. . . . Here for the first time [Shelley] steps off the page as a living, thinking, suffering woman, fraught and caught in the web of her own intelligence.” –Financial Times (London)\n\n“Seymour’s scrupulous, almost anxiously tender portrait peels away the myths like layers of tissue paper shrouding a lost relic. This is a fine biography that gives us the dense background to Mary Shelley’s work while losing none of the searing glamour and pain of her sad, extraordinary life.” –The Sunday Times\n\n“This is a book to be savored for its vivid and sympathetic re-creation of the tragic life and brilliant times of the gifted Mary Shelley.” –Time Literary Supplement\n\n“A wonderfully vivid, human and learned portrait of the woman who created Frankenstein, married Shelley, and, amazingly, survived.” –The Spectator"
