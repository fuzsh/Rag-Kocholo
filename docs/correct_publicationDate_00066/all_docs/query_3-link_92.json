        "text": "An inspiration to write your novel during a lockdown\n\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I began writing my first novel. I was staying all day at my house because of quarantine. I didn’t have lots of homework from university, so I had some free time. It was perfect. But, as the days went by I started to lose my motivation. I decided to get motivated again by investigating how my favourite writers wrote even when times were rough. After doing research, I found that Mary Shelley spent a whole summer inside, during which she started to write Frankenstein.\n\nIn the summer of 1816, when Mary Shelley was 18 years old, she, her boyfriend Percy and her stepsister Claire Clairmont visited Lord Byron and Polidori to Villa Diodati in the Lake Geneva. During that summer there were many thunderstorms which were caused by the eruption of a volcano from Indonesia. This unexpected weather confined them into the house all summer. Every day they will all read ghost stories to past the time.\n\nOne night in the living room, Lord Byron proposed a challenge for all of them. He wanted all to write a ghost story. Mary was excited about it, but the more she tried to think of an idea, the more she failed. Later, she wrote the following text about it.\n\nI busied myself to think of a story, — a story to rival those which had excited us to this task. One that would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature, and awaken thrilling horror — one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle the blood and quicken the beatings of the heart. If I did not accomplish these things my ghost story would be unworthy of its name. I thought and wondered — vainly.\n\nEvery morning they will ask her if she had an idea, but the answer was always no. Every night at the living room, Percy and Lord Byron used to have long conversations about a variety of topics. They talked for hours until they went to bed. Mary used to listen to the conversation, but she stayed silent. One of those nights, they talked about galvanism. Galvanism refers to the discoveries of Luigi Galvani. He discovered that you could generate a contraction or convulsion of biological muscle tissue just by using an electric current. Because of this, some people thought you could give life to organic matter. This topic was interesting for Mary, so she began to wonder, what this possible? can you create life? can a corpse be reanimated? After Percy and Lord Byron conversation ended, they all went to bed. But, Mary could not sleep, her vivid imagination did not let her. All she could think about was these amazing discoveries and what could happen if they were possible. She began to daydream later she wrote the following:\n\nI saw — with shut eyes, but acute mental vision, — I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together — I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion.\n\nAfter that night, she had an idea. At first, she was planning on writing a short story, but later she decided to write a novel.\n\nThis is how Mary came up with the idea for Frankenstein. During a time where she couldn’t go outside. She used all her time, got an idea and wrote it. This idea came to be one of the most influential stories in english literature.\n\nI believe that Mary should be an inspiration for us to keep writing when the times are hard. If you are waiting for a sign from the universe that you should write your novel or any other writing project, this is your sign. Don’t waste more time. The world is waiting for your next story."
