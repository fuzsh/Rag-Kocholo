        "text": "Frankenstein\n\nMary Wollstonecraft Shelley\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\nCRITICISM\n\nFURTHER READING\n\n(Full name Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley) English novelist, poet, playwright, short-story writer, travel writer, essayist, and editor.\n\nThe following entry presents commentary on Shelley's novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818) through 2005.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA seminal work of Victorian literature, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818) is considered one of the most influential and popular novels in the English language. Equal parts Gothic romance, science-fiction adventure, and horror story, Frankenstein has spawned numerous stage and screen adaptations, emerging as an icon of modern popular culture. First published anonymously in 1818, the book came to be regarded as Shelley's masterpiece and paved the way for such horror genre classics as Bram Stoker's Dracula and Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Critical interest in Frankenstein, which greatly increased in the twentieth century, has largely focused on the enduring ethical, moral, and social implications of Shelley's tale. Though Frankenstein's creature is regarded as a horror icon, the novel itself has been adopted by many grade-school and high-school reading lists and has been adapted in several young adult-friendly formats, including a version which appeared in Gilberton Publications's popular \"Classics Illustrated\" comic book series, which ran from 1941 to 1962. Frankenstein's creature has also been featured as a character in a number of picture books targeted at beginning readers, such as Frankenstein Makes a Sandwich (2006) by Adam Rex and Mommy? (2006) by Maurice Sendak, Arthur Yorinks, and Matthew Reinhart, among others.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nBorn on August 30, 1797, Shelley was the daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft, the outspoken feminist and author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, and William Godwin, the novelist and philosopher. Ten days after Shelley was born, her mother died. Shelley and her half-sister Fanny Imlay did not receive a formal education; instead, Godwin raised the girls on progressive ideals and encouraged self-expression and analytical thinking. With this influence, Shelley came to believe in female independence and sexual freedom—concepts that deviated from the values prevalent in English society of the time. In 1801 her father remarried, which caused Shelley to feel alienated and unhappy. She took refuge in books and discussions with the poets and intellectuals who visited her father's house, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, William Wordsworth, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. At the age of sixteen, she fell in love with Percy Shelley, a twenty-two-year-old poet and free-thinker. Their relationship caused much consternation and public controversy, as he was married and his wife was expecting their second child. Nevertheless, in July 1814, one month before her seventeenth birthday, Mary ran off with him to Europe. For the next several years, they traveled in Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. They eventually returned to England, where they married. These years were not idyllic ones: Percy was cut off financially by his father; Fanny committed suicide; Percy's estranged wife, Harriet, drowned herself; and Percy was denied custody of his two children. Mary and Percy had three children, all of whom died. In the wake of these personal hardships, Percy and Mary's marriage suffered, and Percy began to form attachments to other women. While these were trying years in the lives of the Shelleys, it was also a productive time for both of them as writers. In 1818 Mary published the novel Frankenstein, which remains her best-known work. In 1819 she gave birth to Percy Florence, her only surviving child. The elder Percy drowned in Italy, on the Gulf of Spezzia, in 1822. Heartbroken, Mary returned to England with her son in 1823. After her husband's death, Shelley's life was marked by financial hardship. With a meager stipend from her husband's family, she struggled to support herself and her son. Already an established writer, she used her influential contacts to write biographical and critical sketches for Chamber's Cabi-net Cyclopedia as well as numerous short stories for popular English periodicals and the annual The Keepsake. In 1840 her financial situation improved when her son's allowance was increased, which allowed mother and son to travel to Italy and Germany. She recounted these adventures in Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840, 1842, and 1843 (1844). Despite poor health, her last few years were spent in relative contentment. On February 1, 1851, she died as a result of a brain tumor.\n\nPLOT AND MAJOR CHARACTERS\n\nTold from a series of shifting perspectives, Frankenstein opens with a prologue explaining the novel's origin as part of an informal contest among friends to compose a story of the supernatural. The prologue—which is commonly attributed to the author's husband, renowned poet Percy Bysshe Shelley—also cites such literary influences as John Milton's Paradise Lost and Homer's Iliad. The narrative begins as a series of letters written by Captain Robert Walton, an Arctic explorer, to his sister. While detailing his journey toward the North Pole, Walton describes his chance encounter with Doctor Victor Frankenstein, whose sledge has become stranded on an ice floe. The novel adopts Frankenstein's perspective as he recounts his childhood in Geneva, Switzerland. Frankenstein's early years are spent cultivating an interest in alchemy and philosophy in the company of his close friend, Henry Clerval, and his romantic interest, Elizabeth Lavenza. He also expresses great fondness for his mother, Caroline, and father, Alphonse. After his mother succumbs to scarlet fever, Frankenstein leaves home to study science at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Germany. Encouraged and inspired by his professors, he devotes himself to uncovering the mysteries of life. Doctor Frankenstein soon becomes fixated on the idea of creating a superior race and uses the body parts of corpses to assemble a synthetic man, imbued with the spark of life through galvanic electrical power. When the creature comes to life, the doctor is repulsed by it and flees; he later returns home later to find the creature gone. The situation worsens when Frankenstein learns of the murder of his youngest brother, William. While returning home to Geneva, he notices the creature lurking near the scene of his brother's death. Convinced of the creature's culpability, Frankenstein is horrified to learn that the murder has been blamed on Justine Moritz, a dear friend of the family. Moritz is subsequently executed, and the doctor, wracked with guilt, leaves Geneva to wander the countryside. Scaling a mountaintop glacier, Frankenstein is accosted by the creature, who confesses to the crime and pleads for his creator's understanding.\n\nThe narrative shifts to the creature's point of view while retracing the events following his initial escape from Frankenstein. Having spent the winter and spring observing a poor but loving family, the creature teaches himself to speak. He deduces that the head of the family, De Lacey, and his children, Agatha and Felix, were exiled from France for helping an innocent man escape from prison. After finding a bag containing copies of Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werter, the creature learns to read. More importantly, he now realizes the possibility of kindness and companionship. Yet his attempt to approach the family is thwarted by his hideous appearance. The creature begs Frankenstein to provide him with a mate, and the doctor's sense of personal responsibility compels him to grant the creature's request. Frankenstein enlists the aid of Clerval, and the two set out for England to conduct further research. Anxious to erase his indebtedness to the creature, Frankenstein parts ways with Clerval and sets up a laboratory in the Orkney Islands, located north of mainland Scotland. The doctor immerses himself in his work, but has a change of heart just before completing his task. The creature becomes enraged by Frankenstein's sudden decision to abandon the project and makes an ominous threat concerning the doctor's impending marriage to Lavenza. Before he can leave the Orkneys, Frankenstein is arrested for the murder of Clerval, whose body has been found strangled nearby. The doctor becomes gravely ill, and the local court eventually acquits him for lack of evidence. Alphonse soon arrives to take his son back home to Geneva. Once there, Frankenstein and Lavenza are wed, but the creature attacks and kills the new bride. Overwhelmed by the tragic chain of events, Alphonse dies shortly thereafter. The doctor pledges to track down and destroy his creation, following him all the way to the Arctic. The narrative now reverts to Walton's letters, which tell of Frankenstein's final days aboard the explorer's ship during the return trip to England. After Frankenstein's demise, Walton discovers the creature crying over his creator's body. The creature tells Walton of his unbearable loneliness, expresses remorse for his actions, and leaves the ship to die alone on the ice.\n\nMAJOR THEMES\n\nThe novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus, alludes to its key theme—the danger of seeking forbid- den knowledge. In Greek mythology, Prometheus steals fire from Zeus, the ruler of the heavens, and gives it to the mortals for the benefit of mankind. Like Prometheus, Frankenstein assumes godlike powers when he uncovers the secrets of creation and fabricates a new life. The horrors unleashed by Frankenstein's actions turn his story into a cautionary tale, and Walton takes heed by relinquishing his similarly lofty aspirations as an explorer. This connection to the Prometheus myth is emphasized by the novel's use of light as a symbol for knowledge and its inherent limits. For example, when the creature discovers a fire in the woods, he is mesmerized by its ability to cast light into the darkness. In this scene, Shelley suggests the potentially harmful consequences of enlightenment, depicting the creature as he unwittingly thrusts his hand into the flames. The search for greater understanding in Frankenstein correlates directly to the disciplines of science and technology. Rather than seeking it inwardly via compassion or empathy, the protagonist devotes his life to achieving wisdom through scientific experimentation. Another recurring theme of Frankenstein is the power of the natural world. In a manner characteristic of Romantic literature, nature serves to heighten or reflect emotional states throughout the novel. For instance, the utter desolation that has overtaken Frankenstein and his creation by the story's end is accentuated by the harsh and bitter Arctic weather. Additionally, the book calls into question what it means to be a \"monster,\" demonstrating Frankenstein's tendency toward destruction and the creature's capacity for compassion. As the consequences of Frankenstein's hubris become increasingly horrific, the creature begins to express signs of emotional complexity and humanity. In this way, the doctor and his creation are regarded as doppelgängers, or doubles, representing the dual nature of mankind and the relationship between intellect and emotion.\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nUpon its publication, Frankenstein garnered commercial success as a Gothic novel, but critically it was for the most part condemned as sensationalist and gruesome. While the quality of prose in Frankenstein has often been maligned, the novel's thematic elements have inspired a wealth of critical study. Some scholars have explored the religious undertones of the book, noting parallels between Christ's parable of the prodigal son and the predicament of Frankenstein's creature. Others have approached Frankenstein from a psychoanalytical standpoint to further expound on the creature's inner turmoil and conflicting emotions toward his creator. Additionally, Victor Frankenstein's determination to \"play God\" and employ science to create new life has been examined in relation to the Prometheus myth and the modern ethical debate concerning cloning and biotechnology. Another major source of critical attention has been the novel's portrayal of gender roles, leading some commentators to interpret Frankenstein as a thinly veiled response to male dominance in the creative arts. Critics also have cited the tenuous social climate of Europe after the French Revolution as crucial to understanding Shelley's authorial intent, finding political significance in the selection and progression of geographical settings for the story. While the novel has been favorably compared to such classic works as Ovid's Metamorphoses, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere,\" and Marge Piercey's Woman on the Edge of Time, modern academics have also found parallels between Frankenstein and recent works of children's literature—for example, in an essay in Lion and the Unicorn, Noel Chevalier has noted parallels between the portrayals of social justice and human rights in Frankenstein and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\nHistory of a Six Weeks' Tour through a Part of France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland, with Letters Descriptive of a Sail Round the Lake of Geneva and the Glaciers of Chamouni [with Percy Bysshe Shelley] (nonfiction) 1817\n\nFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. 3 vols.

James. \"A Tradition of Male Poetics: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as an Allegory of Art.\" Midwest Quarterly 39, no. 3 (spring 1998): 265-79.\n\n[In the following essay, Wohlpart analyzes the notion of artistic creation in Frankenstein, focusing on issues of personal affection and domesticity.]\n\nCentral to any analysis of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is the relationship between the Monster and his Creator. Several critics, including especially Robert Kiely and Paul Sherwin, have suggested that we read this relationship as a metaphor for the relation between the artist and the created artwork. More specifically, others have asserted that Shelley was centrally discussing her own creative process in the novel. Instead, I believe that she defines the nature of artistic production in her own society, especially as that production emerges from a male poetic, a theory of art which dangerously ignores the human affection that arises from the domestic sphere. Thus, in Frankenstein, Shelley analyzes the ethical nature of the male poetics of her time. In setting up a common parallel, that between the artist as creator and God as Creator, Shelley suggests that the artist must take moral responsibility for his fictive creations. Significantly, such a depiction of the artist's role parallels the role of Victor within Mary Shelley's novel; as he slowly comes to accept his part as the creator of the monster, Victor begins to see his own complicity in the monster's actions.\n\nIn her retrospective introduction, Mary Shelley clearly indicates that Victor's creation of the monster parallels the creation of art. She recounts a discussion between Byron and Percy Shelley about the principle of life, after which Mary Shelley went to bed but could not sleep; instead, she conceives her novel in a waking vision. She concludes: \"Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. His success would terrify the artist …\" (9). In her own analysis of the creative act which produced the novel, Mary Shelley notes the ethical implications of representation apparent in her society. She then concludes her discussion of the waking vision with a description of the creative process itself: \"Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon me\" (10). Similarly, Victor Frankenstein's creation of his monster begins after visiting the lectures of M. Waldman on modern science; Victor notes that \"I closed not my eyes that night\" (48). After a great deal of research into the \"principle of life,\" Victor explains how, one day, \"I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me …\" (51-52).\n\nAs I have noted, critics such as Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, Beth Newman, and Marc Rubenstein, locate the critique of artistic creativity apparent in the novel in Mary Shelley's own process of creation. I contend, however, that the critique finds its locus in the male-dominated artistic arena of her time. Not only does Mary Shelley implicate the Romantics in her novel, and especially Percy Shelley and Lord Byron, but she also implicates the tradition which led up this period, suggesting that artistic creativity has predominantly become, as Gilbert and Gubar so aptly point out, a male pursuit. At the center of Shelley's critique is the way in which male creativity omits any feminine influence and thus creates a series of monsters. Yet Mary Shelley does not suggest that a sudden acceptance of the feminine will alleviate the overwhelmingly male dominance of art; rather, she shows how such a domination insidiously inscribes the female in such a way that responsibility for the monster's actions is unfairly forced upon her as she becomes a semblance of the monster himself.\n\nThe Central Relation: Victor Frankenstein, Scientist, and His Hideous Progeny\n\nAs an allegory of artistic creation, the specifics of Victor's creation of his monster, as well as his subsequent relation to his progeny, need close attention. While it is clear that Frankenstein is born of parents who bestow much affection on him as a child and that Elizabeth Lavenza tempers Victor's searching after truth while young, when he moves towards the creation of the monster, Victor leaves these influences behind and isolates himself in a solitude that excludes not only society but also nature, which becomes symbolic of the feminine. After arriving in Ingolstadt and setting up his \"solitary apartment,\" Victor explains his predilection for an ancient science based on pursuing dreams and visions of the ideal: \"I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time, and exchanged the discoveries of recent enquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchymists,\" preferring those who search for \"immortality and power\" (45-46). As his studies advance, science, and especially chemistry, becomes his \"sole occupation.\" He explains: \"Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva [his family and friends], but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make\" (50).\n\nAfter discovering the principle of life, Victor devotes himself to building the frame for his monster. He notes that he \"seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit\" before describing his laboratory: \"In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation …\" (54-55). The site of the monster's creation is an isolated workshop wherein Victor separates himself from all society, a neglect paralleled in his relation to nature. He states that he is completely insensible of society and of the outside world: \"And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not been for so long a time.\" While he knows that he is not thinking of his family as he promised both his father and Elizabeth that he would, he feels irresistibly drawn by his pursuit: \"I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed\" (55). Victor continually emphasizes not only that he is creating his monster in an atmosphere of isolation and solitude but that his isolation is of a specific kind: from family and friends which leads to the neglect of feelings and affections.\n\nIn fact, at this point in his narrative, he turns to Robert Walton to deliver an admonition: \"If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind\" (56). To demonstrate the way in which his relation to the feminine has been destroyed as a result of his \"study,\" he describes a dream vision which he has immediately following the animation of his monster. In the dream, Victor sees Elizabeth who is at first \"in the bloom of health\"; after he embraces and kisses her, however, she becomes \"livid with the hue of death\" and then transforms into the corpse of Victor's dead mother (58). Significantly, immediately after the monster is brought to life, a transformation occurs in Victor, symbolized by a renewed awareness of the world outside: \"It was a divine spring; and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom …\" (62). Both family and nature once again influence Victor now that he is no longer in the process of creating his monster.\n\nThe hideous nature of Victor Frankenstein's creation seems to stem in part from the circumstances of his creative process. Mary Shelley suggests that, because of his isolation, Victor's creativity results in a deformed and hideous being. But Mary Shelley goes beyond such an implication, demonstrating further the creator's moral responsibility when he creates a work of art. Because the monster has at its foundation a male poetics, that is, a creative process dominated by male perceptions and ideas to the exclusion of any feminine influence, he eventually goes astray and murders three victims (William Frankenstein, Henry Clerval, and Elizabeth Lavenza Frankenstein) and causes the death of three others (Justine Moritz, Alphonse Frankenstein, and Victor Frankenstein)—deaths which Victor must eventually attribute to himself.\n\nAlphonse Frankenstein describes the first murder, that of Victor's younger brother William, in a letter. He notes that, when they discovered William's body, \"the print of the murderer's finger was on his neck\" (72). As if to represent an extension of Victor's creative act, an act akin to artistic creativity and thus to writing, the monster leaves his print on the body of his innocent victim. Only during the trial of Justine Moritz, the girl accused of William's murder, does Victor begin to sense his complicity in the actions of the monster. When discussing the possible outcomes of the trial, Victor notes that it \"was to be decided, whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow- beings …\" (81). Victor's reaction to the evil actions of his creation suggests that he realizes that they are an extension of his own creative act. Just as he sought solitude and isolation while creating the monster, after admitting that the murders of the first two victims result from his creative act and are thus his responsibility, he turns once again to solitude: \"I shunned the face of man … solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude\" (90).\n\nVictor's reaction to the second murder, that of Henry Clerval, follows a similar pattern of first acceptance of responsibility and then abandonment of society. Indeed, after returning home, Victor reiterates \"that Clerval … had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation\" (183). He then emphasizes his isolation: \"I abhorred the face of man. Oh not abhorred! … But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse\" (184-85). Once again, Victor responds to the complicitous nature of the monster's crime through an increase in his solitude and isolation. He continually insinuates his responsibility in the deaths of William, Justine, and Henry, but he no longer perceives the monster as a mediator between himself and the crimes. Rather, he begins to accept his own direct responsibility: since he created the monster, he is directly accountable for its actions, just as an artist is morally accountable for the occurrences depicted in a work of art.\n\nThe third and final murder, that of Elizabeth Lavenza on the night of her marriage to Victor Frankenstein, implicates Victor's creative act in a new way because this final murder destroys any possibility of a feminine influence. Victor decides to marry Elizabeth after he abandons his creation of a female mate for the monster because he knows that \"Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits …\" (190). Victor, however, never gets the opportunity to feel Elizabeth's influence for on the night of their marriage, the monster murders her: \"The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck …\" (196). As if finally to demonstrate the complete lack of any feminine influence in the creative process, the monster, with Victor's complicity implied, destroys the representative of such influence.\n\nThe deaths of these central figures, who comprise the totality of Victor's friends and the center of his family, conclude the monster's actions within civilization, and he leads Victor to the wastelands of the Arctic region where Victor eventually meets Robert Walton and tells him his tale. But before Victor departs to these wastelands, and even before he attempts to consecrate his own happiness with his marriage to Elizabeth Lavenza, Victor meets the monster on the slopes of the Swiss Alps and hears his tale, a tale which becomes embedded in Victor's own tale to Walton. Significantly, both Victor's tale to Walton and the monster's tale to Victor are told in the icy wastes of isolation, suggesting that such male-centered narratives have a founding flaw similar to that of Victor's creation of the monster. In his tale, the monster notes that he would have been a benevolent creature if he had had the opportunity of communing with others.\n\nThe monster's tale concludes with a plea for Victor to create a mate for him so that he can remain a benevolent being. He tells Victor: \"If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion…. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to the chain of existence and events, from which I am now excluded\" (147). A feminine influence, as the monster realizes, is necessary so that he might interact benevolently with the world. As already noted, however, Victor abandons his project of a second creation, thus withholding any feminine influence from his monstrous progeny. In this way, the female remains decidedly outside of the solipsistic male creative process.\n\nHowever, while such an influence does remain excluded from male creativity, the female is inscribed within the male poetics in such a way that the female seemingly becomes complicitous in, and thus responsible for, the actions of the hideous progeny. Even though Victor perceives that, ultimately, he is responsible for the crimes resulting from his creative act, he watches silently as the female is found guilty of those crimes. Obliquely emphasizing the nature of the condemnation of the female, Justine explains to Elizabeth that the confessor threatened her \"until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was\" (87). The male poetics not only silently acquiesces to the female's suggested complicity, but it turns the female into the monster itself, into the very being who perpetrated the crime. When Justine asks whether the silent Victor believes in her innocence. Elizabeth must answer for him that indeed he knows Justine to be innocent. Justine replies to Victor through Elizabeth: \"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!\" (88). Just as the confessor not only implicates Justine in the monster's crime but also equates her with the monster, Justine's final speech most ironically equates her with Victor Frankenstein's creation. Earlier in the novel, after having gathered his materials for his creation, Victor noted that \"A new species would bless me as its creator and source…. No father could claim the gratitude of his child[ren] so completely as I should deserve theirs\" (54). In Justine's \"sincerest gratitude\" and acceptance of her fate, she ironically appears to become one of Victor's own creations.\n\nThe inscription of Justine within the male poetics ultimately silences her and thus perpetuates the very lack that causes the male poetics to create monsters in the first place. After the condemnation of Justine, Elizabeth emphasizes this circularity:\n\nWhen I reflect … on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice, that I read in books or heard from others, as tales of ancient days, or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's blood.\n\n(92)\n\nThe appearance of the monster in the home has destroyed the felicity once enjoyed there, a destruction which bars the home from influencing the creations of the imagination and thus perpetuates further appearances of the monster.\n\nIn detailing his murder of William, the monster also explains the nature of this cycle. After the monster leaves his print on Victor's brother, he steals the portrait which hangs around William's neck, the portrait of a female and thus a representative of that influence from which the monster is excluded (143). The monster then proceeds to the barn and discovers Justine asleep in the hay. Before placing the portrait of the female in Justine's pocket, the monster notes that \"the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her: be hers the punishment!\" (144). Not only is Justine then implicated in the crime in that she will have to atone for it, but she is also held responsible for the crime as its source. Significantly, the very object which both implicates Justine in the crime and eventually equates her with the monster is a representation of the female figure.\n\nSpiralling Outward: Robert Walton, Explorer, and the Silent Female Reader, Margaret Saville\n\nAs Peter McInerney has noted, just as Victor Frankenstein's scientific creation finds its analogue in artistic creation, so too does Robert Walton's exploration of the North Pole. Moreover, the central element in Robert Walton's discovery voyage, as in Victor Frankenstein's discovery of the principle of life, becomes that of connection to the feminine. Unlike Victor, however, Robert Walton vacillates between isolation and community. While Walton admits to his sister that he lacks one element which he feels important to his journey, a close, male friend, he is connected to the feminine, as Fred V. Randel has suggested, in that he does at least attempt, unlike Frankenstein, to commit his emotions to paper and dispatch them to his sister (530). As Walton notes, however, paper is a poor medium for the necessary communication of affections, linked throughout the novel to the feminine. Yet Margaret Saville's influence on Robert Walton is thorough, for even though he turns from dispatching letters to writing daily entries in his journal, he continues to record events in order eventually to communicate his experiences. Her influence can also be seen in the care that Walton takes with his sailors. Although anxious to embark on his journey, he tells Margaret in a letter that he will wait until the weather clears: \"you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness, whenever the safety of others is committed to my care\" (21).\n\nBut Robert Walton travels far enough from the influence of his sister that he becomes privileged to hear Victor's tale, a tale whose purport is a warning against such a disengagement from the feminine. Shortly after the conclusion of Victor's tale, the sailors come to Walton and reveal their own forebodings. At this point, he begins to feel the depth of his responsibility: \"The brave fellows, whom I have persuaded to be my companions, look towards me for aid; but I have none to bestow…. [I]t is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause\" (212). As Victor slowly comes to realize his own complicity in the murders of his creation, Walton understands the nature of his responsibility to the lives of those aboard the ship. And just as Frankenstein's creation claimed it his \"right\" to have a female mate, the sailors come to Walton and ask for his promise that they will return home if they are freed from the ice, something which, \"in justice,\" he could not refuse (214).\n\nWhen the ice does break, Walton demonstrates unequivocally the strength of his sister's influence. Rather than continue his voyage to the North Pole as Victor urges, Walton agrees to return home: \"It is past; I am returning to England…. [W]hile I am wafted towards England, and towards you, I will not despond\" (215). But Walton demonstrates the influence of his sister not only in deciding to return home but also in his interaction with the monster. As the ship departs the Arctic wastes, the monster leaps aboard and visits the corpse of his creator. Walton hears the monster and enters the cabin to find him crouched over the body of his master. As Laura P. Claridge has demonstrated, his reaction to the monster suggests a new paradigm in the novel; instead of immediately rejecting the monster, Walton asks him to stay: \"I shut my eyes involuntarily, and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay.\" Walton's hesitation suggests that Frankenstein's desire to have the monster destroyed has not fully infected the explorer. Instead, Walton reacts with \"a mixture of curiosity and compassion\" (219).\n\nWhile it appears that Mary Shelley offers hope in the character of Robert Walton, as he eventually tempers his male spirit with a feminine influence, two significant events occur at this moment in the text. First, while Walton himself has abandoned his voyage to the North Pole in order to preserve the lives of his sailors, his pursuit is not totally forsaken, for the monster figures to complete Walton's voyage. Second, and perhaps more important, at the moment that Walton fully accepts the feminine influence, in that he decides both to return to England and to allow the monster to live untouched, he stops writing and the novel ends abruptly. As if to demonstrate the incompatibility of the feminine and an artistic world dominated by males, Mary Shelley does not allow Walton to continue writing.\n\nOnce again, however, Mary Shelley delineates the way in which the female resides both within and without the male poetics. As Peter McInerney has commented, the novel appears to be presented as if constructed by Robert Walton, the explorer who not only pursues the North Pole but also hears and transcribes Victor Frankenstein's tale. But, in actuality, the novel has a mediating force beyond that of Robert Walton in his sister Margaret Saville. For we know that the first three of Walton's letters are dispatched to his sister and that it is only the fourth letter, which transforms into a journal, that Walton retains. Thus, apparently, Margaret Saville is the final destination, and the silent destination, of the male text.\n\nAt the point where Robert Walton transforms his fourth letter into a journal, he notes to Margaret his reason for transcribing not only Victor's tale but also his own: \"You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are, therefore, somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man\" (29). Again the circular implication of the female must be noted: the female is rendered incapable of a significant relation to the artistic sphere because of her indulgence in that sphere. Rather than suggesting a remedy for such an entrapment, Robert Walton dispatches the male text to the silent female reader to further implicate her in this inescapable circle. As we might assume that the entire text of the novel is Margaret Saville's transcription of Robert Walton's letters and journal about this \"wonderful man,\" we can see Mary Shelley's final judgment of the female's place, or non-place, in the world of art. In the end, all artistic pursuit seems to be based on a male poetics, even, apparently, the artistic pursuit of the female, for she can only silently transcribe the male text.\n\nIn Conclusion: A Tradition of Male Poetics\n\nBecause of his isolation from any feminine influence, Victor Frankenstein, as a pseudo-artist, creates a monstrosity. Clearly, however, the monstrous nature of Victor's creation derives from more than just the creative atmosphere itself. As the monster continually notes, if he had communed with a female mate, he would have been not a monstrosity but a benevolent and beneficent creature. But Mary Shelley suggests yet another source for the creation's monstrosity, a source which is perhaps paramount to the others: that of the three texts of the monster's training (Johnson, 10). While Gilbert and Gubar aptly demonstrate the overwhelming influence of Milton's Paradise Lost on subsequent literary artists, especially female artists (219-30), a similar case can be made within the text of Frankenstein for both the Sorrows of Werther and Plutarch's Lives.\n\nThe monster describes the protagonist in The Sorrows of Werther as a man of such sensibility that he cannot exist within his own society and is ultimately destroyed. Plutarch's Lives expands the sphere delineated in the Sorrows of Werther from a focus on the male self to a focus on historical selves—all male. Finally, as Gilbert and Gubar point out, the monster's description of Paradise Lost omits any mention of the major female figure, Eve, concentrating, rather, on comparisons between himself and the major male figures. Gilbert and Gubar conclude that each of these three texts \"must have seemed to [Mary Shelley] to embody lessons a female author … must learn about a male-dominated society\" (237). Indeed, as Peter Dale Scott and Paul Sherwin have noted, Frankenstein directly critiques Percy Shelley's Romantic position, suggesting how his idealism inscribes his poetry within a similar circle. Concentrating on such poems as Prometheus Unbound and The Cenci, William Veeder comes to the conclusion that Mary Shelley's warnings were too late, that Percy Shelley's isolation was complete and total. Yet few critics have pointed out that it is Mary Shelley's very critique of art which also confounds her husband. While the plea to the west wind in Shelley's ode is that his poetry will be scattered among humankind, there is also implicit in the poem a despondency about his lack of any real connection with the flow of life. Indeed, Percy Shelley's last poem, The Triumph of Life, breaks off, as does Frankenstein, just as it suggests such a connection.\n\nIn addition to Mary Shelley's indictment of her husband is an indictment of Lord Byron, the other male artist from whose company Mary Shelley feels alienated. As she notes in her introduction, while she and Percy live in Switzerland and she conceives the idea of and writes Frankenstein, Byron composes the third canto of Childe Harold. Byron's famous canto centers on the Byronic hero's isolation from life and, specifically, the narrator's isolation from his daughter Ada. Just as Robert Walton's text has its ultimate destination in his silent sister, Margaret Saville, one senses that Byron's canto is also a dispatch to his daughter explaining his lack of paternal responsibility. Andrew Griffin, Rosemary Jackson, and Kiely have all suggested that Frankenstein be read as a feminist commentary on such poets as Percy Shelley and Lord Byron, as well as on the literary tradition which leads up to the Romantic period. As such, Frankenstein might be expected to liberate itself from the male poetics which Mary Shelley finds isolated from any feminine influence. Yet the very point of the novel is the apparent impossibility of such a liberation. Indeed, the very process in which the novel was constructed demonstrates this impossibility, for while Mary Shelley was the primary author of the novel, Percy Shelley closely monitored its production (see Murray). Not only did he guide Mary's hand in the creation of the work, but he had the final hand in its construction. Mary Shelley notes, in her journal on Wednesday, 14 May 1817, \"Shelley reads ‘History of the French Revolution,’ and corrects Frankenstein. Write Preface. Finis\" (79).\n\nMary Shelley clarifies, however, the kind of influence that she received from her husband. After having put but \"a few pages\" of a \"short tale\" on paper, Mary Shelley is incited by her husband \"to develope the idea at greater length\" (10). She goes on to note, however, that \"I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to my husband …\" (10). In detailing the lack of human affection implicit in Percy Shelley's creativity, Mary Shelley counteracts Percy's claim, in the Preface to Frankenstein written by Percy in Mary's name, that her aim was \"the exhibition of the amiableness of domestic affection\" (14). Indeed, the novel shows, rather, the results that a lack of domestic affection can have on art, results which allow Mary Shelley to call her novel \"my hideous progeny\" (10).\n\nBibliography\n\nClaridge, Laura P. \"Parent-Child Tensions in Frankenstein: The Search for Communion.\" Studies in the Novel, 17 (Spring 1985), 14-26.\n\nCottom, Daniel. \"Frankenstein and the Monster of Representation.\" Sub-Stance, 28 (1980), 60-71.\n\nCoyle, William, ed.

Christ describes the travails of an immature young man who demands and receives his inheritance from his doting father and then wastes every bit of it on high living and self-aggrandizement. When his funds are exhausted and his fair-weather companions have vanished, he finds himself isolated in a foreign land, dwelling in squalor among strangers who do not care about his plight. Eventually, his situation becomes so desperate that he is forced to take the vilest job imaginable for a Jewish male: He becomes a herder of swine, the keeper of a Gentile's filthy pigsty: \"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. […] And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him\" (Luke 15.14-16). Because swine are, according to Old Testament Jewish law, unclean and therefore unholy in the eyes of God, the prodigal son has not simply fallen on hard economic times. Rather, by living with and touching forbidden animals, he has degraded himself, defiled his family, and betrayed his faith. This wayward son cannot fall any farther from grace.\n\nLike most of the writers in her literary circle, from Lord Byron to Doctor Polidori, Mary Shelley—self-educated and one of the best-read women of her time—was intrigued by old tales and ancient myths concerning lost and outcast wanderers. Jesus' parable of the prodigal son fits perfectly into the Romantic notion of the isolated soul, the tortured, wandering loner who is, by fate or circumstance, cast adrift on a sea of loneliness and despair. In chapter 11 of Frankenstein —the first chapter narrated exclusively by the monster—there is a very subtle yet unmistakable allusion to Christ's parable.\n\nWithin hours of being animated by Victor Frankenstein's unnatural \"spark of being,\" the creature—confused and frightened by all the unfamiliar sensations around him—abandons Victor's apartment and begins to wander aimlessly through the forests of southern Germany (Shelley 52). After a few days of foraging for sustenance, he encounters a village of modest but well-kept cottages. Suffering from the intense hunger pangs of a giant man-child, he innocently enters one of the dwellings, drawn by the aroma of freshly cooked food, and he is shocked when the occupants scream, faint, or scatter in terror. The entire village is quickly roused into action, and the monster is viciously and repeatedly attacked until, \"‘grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons,’\" he flees for his life, finally reaching the safety of the pathless forest (110). After putting many miles between himself and his attackers, the creature finds humble refuge \"‘in a low hovel, quite bare, and […] wretched’\" (110). This cramped shelter has a dirt floor, and icy winds whistle through large chinks in the walls. The hovel, barely large enough for his huge frame, is attached to the rear of the De Lacey cottage. But most important, the monster's shed is \"‘surrounded on the sides […] by a pig-sty and a clear pool of water’\" (111). This is Mary Shelley's faint but telling echo of the parable of the prodigal son. Like the biblical figure, Dr. Frankenstein's creature has reached bottom. Literally, the monster now lives with pigs, and because he gathers roots and berries in the forest by night and brings them back to his hovel to eat while he hides during the day, he dines with swine as well. He is an outcast, dirty, unloved, unwelcome, and penniless. He is far removed from his father, Victor, who is still back in Ingolstadt, oblivious to the vile squalor into which his young son has fallen.\n\nAlthough both the prodigal son and the monster are on the verge of starvation, they choose not to kill and eat the pigs that keep them company. The prodigal son will not eat them for religious reasons. The monster will not eat them for moral reasons, explaining, \"‘My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment’\" (157). In another parallel, the creature learns bitter lessons about humanity during his solitary suffering by the pigsty; eventually he will undertake a difficult pilgrimage back to his father in hopes of a warm welcome. For the monster, however, that welcome will prove violent; he will not be accepted back into the embrace of familial love, because the creature's father is not a forgiving man. Unlike the good father in the Bible, Victor offers hatred in place of affection, violence rather than acceptance, and vengeance instead of understanding. Throughout the entire novel, Victor is portrayed as the antithesis of a good father, whereas in the parable, the father is held up as a model parent, loving his wayward son unconditionally: \"Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found\" (Luke 15.22-24).\n\nMary Shelley's many overt biblical references, which serve to layer and enrich her novel with echoes of archetypal figures, have been explicated at length in the nearly two centuries since the publication of her cautionary tale of science gone horribly awry. Yet often it is the subtle allusion—a familiar image, a fleeting turn of phrase, a telling echo in a sentence—that catches the reader's attention, tweaks the curiosity, and demands another perusal.\n\nWork Cited\n\nShelley, Mary.

The novel has also evoked frequent extended comparisons with other feminist utopian fiction of the 1970s. Critics have gained historical perspective on the novel by looking to the tradition of utopian writing, in particular Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland (1915). But to understand Piercy's novel—its present as well as its future worlds—in context, one might well look back another century, to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818, 1831).1\n\nFrankenstein, often called the first work of science fiction (e.g., Scholes and Rabkin 7, 192) and \"perhaps the single most influential work of science fiction by a woman\" (Jacobs 192), inaugurated a related genre within which Piercy works. In their use of other genres—for example Shelley, the epistolary and the gothic; Piercy, time travel and utopian and dystopian fiction—as well as in other respects, Frankenstein and Woman on the Edge of Time differ greatly, making the continuities less readily apparent. Discovering some of them contributes to recent efforts to develop a sense of a \"continuous literary tradition\" of speculative fiction by women, of these works speaking to one another (Donawerth and Kolmerten 1). The two novels contain revealing similarities, especially in their portrayals of the outsider and of science, two key aspects of what has become known as the Frankenstein myth. To explore the various connections entails delving into the realm of the monstrous: that which deviates from the norm, that which is perceived as violent, unnatural, unacceptable.\n\nIn Frankenstein and subsequent science fiction, the fantastic is reached through potentially credible science. Shelley gives no details of the creation of the creature but portrays a scientist who definitely did his homework, experimenting for long hours at his dissecting table. The two alternative futures Piercy portrays, Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, in 2137 A.D. and a high-rise world opposite to it in many ways, are clearly possible outgrowths of our own science and technology. Science fiction emerged amidst the Industrial Revolution, as people saw that science and technology could change their world, change their daily lives. Piercy's novel emerged from the next stage, the Computer Revolution, which has catalyzed us to see anew the radical changes we might anticipate. Physical changes may be internal as well as external, as medical technology gives us the power to alter behavior and manipulate genes. Indeed, among the more important changes made possible by computers may be control of biological processes, reanimating questions posed by Victor Frankenstein's experiment. Piercy herself explicitly looks beyond the Industrial Revolution when she notes that \"you will never hear me talking about control of the means of production, but rather control of the means of production and reproduction\" (Parti 129). As one of the characters in Woman on the Edge of Time, puts it, \"the crux […] is in the biological sciences\" (223). Varying approaches to human intervention distinguish the protagonist's present life and both of the future worlds she visits.\n\nMany works of science fiction have flattened character depictions while pursuing other ends, as Ursula Le Guin and others have noted (20). But already in its origins, Mary Shelley demonstrated Le Guin's conviction \"that the science fiction writer [should] be also a novelist of character\" (26). In language reminiscent of Coleridge's Biographia Literaria, the preface of Frankenstein (probably by Percy Shelley) emphasizes that the \"novelty of the situations which it develops […] affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of human passions\" (xxvii).2Woman on the Edge of Time follows this lead. Although one critic has labeled Connie flat, a character in a \"teaching story\" (DuPlessis 2), most have responded to Piercy's own stated interest in character: Alongside comments about the \"image of a good society\" she sought to portray, Piercy claims \"Consuelo Ramos is the best character I ever created, the fullest and deepest\"; \"it's primarily a novel about Connie\" (Parti 215, 100). Susan Kress notes, in discussing Piercy's \"search for appropriate form,\" that \"the science fiction form has provided her with the perfect solution to the problem of combining the novel of character and the novel of ideas\" (109, 120).\n\nIn her three related characters—Walton, Frankenstein, and the creature—Shelley both employs and subverts the figure of the intense, isolated, introspective, questing Romantic hero. We hear part of the story from the first-person viewpoint of each of the novel's three Romantic individuals. The Romantic hero, found in so many works of art and music as well as literature during the nineteenth century, is often trapped within his own consciousness, subject to insatiable longings that are doomed to disappointment. He is the alienated, misunderstood outsider. Piercy's Connie is in this line but as a woman and sole center of consciousness, although she is doubled by other characters in the novel. The main action takes place in her thoughts, whether or not she really visits a future society in Mattapoisett (a question Piercy claims she deliberately left ambiguous [Parti 110]). Connie is a mental traveler, who both in her present world and in the future thinks intensively about herself and her world. And like Walton, Frankenstein, and the creature, she cannot share or discuss her journey with others, who simply do not or would not understand. Frankenstein says if he had told others about the creature he would have been thought mad (as his experience with the Swiss magistrate supports); Connie understands that references to Mattapoisett would reinforce that diagnosis she has already incurred. Like so many protagonists of the Romantic era, Connie's heightened consciousness brings her not satisfaction but ongoing and seemingly inescapable pain. And like Coleridge's Ancient Mariner and like the Byronic hero, she bears a burden of guilt from which she cannot free herself. She suffers alone, tormented.\n\nThe connections between Connie and Shelley's creature are worth exploring.3 Piercy emphasizes that the novelist can \"seduce the reader into identifying with characters whom the reader would refuse to know in ordinary life\" (Parti 169). With Connie and the creature, both Piercy and Shelley engage that challenge. And the language of these outsiders is sometimes similar enough that one seems to speak for the other. In this essay I focus mainly on Connie in her present world because there Piercy establishes the themes she returns to in the alternative futures Connie visits.\n\nThe creature is an experiment created by a scientist. Connie becomes an experiment recreated by scientists. In both cases, the results are monstrous, deviating from the norm. Piercy's text encourages the reader toward such a connection through repeated references to monsters in the chapters about a planned operation to control Connie's personality: \"She would be a walking monster with a little computer inside\" (282-83; also see 279, 304). Connie and Skip greet each other after their brain implant operations, \"Hello, monster\" (285). We do not know much about the appearance of Shelley's creature. Ironically, however, as Connie is drugged into a shuffling walk and slurred speech and later has a plate implanted, affixed with \"sharp metal pins\" (281), she comes to resemble the creature's recurring representation in movies—with bolts, metal plates, and so on.\n\nIn such passages, Piercy seems to emphasize Connie in the hands of the doctors as a created monster, but other passages suggest that previously she also was a \"monster\" or \"misfit.\" Whereas Victor constructed the creature from the dead parts of other human beings, Connie has been \"constructed\" in constricting ways by her society, on the basis of gender, ethnicity, and class. She is female, abused by men from childhood: \"From an early age she had been told that what she felt was unreal and didn't matter\" (282). She is Chicana, in a world where college, a youthful appearance, and a clean job seem to be Anglo characteristics (35, 47) and where a professor as employer will bed his \"Chicana of the year.\" She is poor, in a world where that seems to be a crime (62). In fact, the creature is her predecessor in awareness of such constructions:\n\n[He] learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I?\n\n(104-05)\n\nThe creature is different from the dominant society and thus cannot \"pass\" no matter what he does. Connie, before and after her operation, feels different and unable to \"pass\" into the dominant society. Both are beings of great power but powerless within their world.\n\nNames by which we refer to them emphasize their misfit status. The creature has no name. Others do label him: in particular, Victor calls him \"devil,\" \"demon,\" \"monster,\" language that Walton picks up. Connie sees that she has multiple identities, multiple names: She describes herself as Consuelo, the silent, suffering, enduring Mexican woman; Connie, who tried to learn and work within the mainstream society; and Conchita, a drunken, mean self (122). Geraldo calls her a bag; her second husband Eddie calls her a witch. Friends in Mattapoisett see other potentialities, calling her Salt-and-Pepper—suggesting not only her hair color but also vitality, spice. In that society, people choose their own names, changing them at will. The medical establishment, in the reports at the end of the novel, gives Connie no name, only a set of delimiting labels—a Mexican-American (or erroneously in another report, Puerto Rican; at least for sure an outsider), child abuser, schizophrenic. In this essay, for convenience, I use the novels' most frequent usages—\"the creature\" and \"Connie,\" but with the awareness that these are not neutral pointers but rather ones that emphasize the protagonists' outsider status. Who are they? The reader is brought into the act of discernment as the characters themselves struggle with \"Who am I?\" They see how others answer that question for them but continue to long for different possibilities.\n\nWhat does the monster want? Most simply, not to be a monster; not to be deemed deviant from humanity; to be able to fulfill basic human needs. In each case, both learning and caring are central among their wants. Both the creature and Connie integrate the traditional dualism of head and heart. The creature in his hovel listens in on society with a hunger, a thirst for learning, but revelation of his monstrosity discontinues his lessons. In her \"pursuit of knowledge and some better way to live\" (47), Connie highly values her time at a community college, but in a sense she too is \"listening in\" from the outside. Her pregnancy forces her to discontinue her lessons, but she continues to wish for learning (e.g., 215). These \"monsters\" also want contact, connection, kindness, understanding, not just to be loved but to love and care for others. From the beginning, the creature is unloved: Victor, in his flight and subsequent ignoring of what he has done, seems to treat the creature as a nuisance that if ignored might simply go away, disappear. Connie's father beats her; she hungers for the mothering her brother Luis received but she did not, and Luis, it seems, by Americanizing his name, would like to forget that he has a sister, forget the link that binds them—the monstrosity of ethnicity and class. Both Connie and the creature continue to be rejected by those who should be family.\n\nDiscussion of these two characters often emphasizes their quests of the heart. But we need to see that their quests are set within a broader search for a social role. Connie is perceptive enough to see that connection: \"we often want love when we need something else, like a good job or a chance to go back to school\" (86). That comment sheds light back onto the creature's quest. Yes, he wants love, but he also burns \"to become an actor\" in the busy scene of human affairs, with an \"ardour for virtue\" (112-13). Connie sees that in Mattapoisett, unlike in her world, she could be useful (214) and would have the respect and self-respect she lacks. Luciente of Mattapoisett has scope to act, whereas her dystopian counterpart Gildina contributes only sex.\n\nLike the creature, Connie reaches out again and again but each time is slammed back into isolation. The reaching out may entail trying to help someone in danger. The creature tries to save a drowning girl, for which he is shot. In the striking opening scene of Woman on the Edge of Time Connie tries to help Dolly escape beatings and a forced abortion, for which Connie herself is beaten and institutionalized. Both helpers are \"misdiagnosed\" as violent beings. The creature tries to explain himself to the common man—the senior De Lacey—but the son drives him out of the cottage. The scientist momentarily listens but ultimately disregards the creature's feelings and needs. Connie tries to explain herself to her niece and her brother, but to no avail. The hospital employees and the doctors either ignore or disregard her: \"No one had heard a word she said\"; \"it was as if she spoke another language\" (17, 19). Only the external is visible: a giant, ugly man; a poor Chicana with a record. The voices of the outsiders are silenced.\n\nThe creature and Connie modify their dreams. The creature finally hopes to go away with just one other being, to live in seclusion and mutual caring. Connie was \"at fifteen full of plans and fire\" (47); despite her rejections then of the dream of domesticity, she later fantasizes about living as a family with Dolly and Dolly's children (46, 14). Realizations of even such dreams are for others, not for them. There is no bride of Frankenstein, no family for Connie (except her fellow mental patients, who have no power to elect an ongoing bond). Connie, \"lying in enforced contemplation\" (19) but longing for connection, is in the line of the creature. For both, this drive remains \"unsatisfied, yet unquenched\" (F [Frankenstein ] 205). When Connie visits the future, she sees one possibility where citizens are alone when they choose, or as part of a rite of passage, and another where Gildina is so accustomed to solitude that she does not know what she is missing (Friends? \"‘What for?’\" [291-92]).\n\nConnie, like the creature, has \"too little of what her soul could imagine\" (280). Anger rises up in both of them, and they finally resort to violence, but only as a last resort, after realizing that any further efforts will meet with the same kinds of results as before. In terms reminiscent of the creature's, Connie says late in Woman on the Edge, \"If only they had left me something! […] Only one person to love. […] For that love I'd have borne it all and I'd never have fought back. […] But I have nothing. Why shouldn't I strike back?\" (371-72). Revenge seems all that is left. In similar and stark terms, the creature turns to \"war against the species\" (121), and Connie says, \"it is war\" (375). The creature vows to destroy the scientist who has created him. Connie vows to destroy the doctors who have created her as a mental patient and are creating her as an experiment.\n\nDoes the protagonist \"go over to the Dark Side,\" believe in violence, the movement with which we have become so familiar through our contemporary myth of Star Wars? Hardly—except in various movie versions of Frankenstein. To the end, the creature says, \"still I desired love and fellowship\" (204); and Connie wishes for \"just one little corner of loving of my own\" (372). The violence destroys both the perpetrator and its targets. The creature brings down the scientist, but all that is left for him is to go off and destroy himself as well. Connie poisons four people, but nothing is left for her but final subjection to the mental institutions.\n\nMany critics have seen the violence at the end of Woman on the Edge of Time as a liberation, repeatedly describing it in glowing terms.4 \"Connie's action in poisoning her doctors is clearly an achievement of the self. […] Piercy asks us to see Connie's action as part of a pattern of empowerment\" (Jones 125). Connie is \"our hero and avenger\" (Gardiner 75); she plays a \"Messianic role\" (Adams 49); she \"takes independent action, and […] conquers her society heroically\" (Cramer 232-33). \"Piercy interprets [Connie's murders] as justifiable defense against an essentially violent system\" (Drake 117). Pearson (132), in milder terms, also justifies Connie's action. Such commentaries offer no questioning of the violence. Death to the oppressors! Are we to have bought into the perspective of Connie to such an extent that we cheer murder? Or do we ask, \"Wait a minute. Why did it have to be this way?\" Granted, Piercy herself has said that the novel portrays \"how a woman stops hating herself and becomes able to love herself enough to fight for her own survival\" (Parti 100). But alongside that comment we should note her response to a query about whether her characters speak for her—or, we might add, act for her:\n\nDirectly, seldom. [… T]o me the truth of the novel isn't in what any character says, but rather in the whole of the fiction. As a known feminist I find critics often naively imagine I am putting my politics directly into the mouth of my protagonist. That I could not possibly be amused, ironic, interested in the consonances and dissonances.\n\n(Parti 148-49)\n\nThe echoes of Frankenstein in Woman on the Edge of Time remind us that Connie's acts are monstrous. And society has created its monsters.5 Things could have been otherwise. The murderers could have been nurturers. They wanted desperately to be; as the creature reemphasizes at the very end, \"My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy […]\" (202). The creature feels great regret, unlike Connie, but both cast a critical look outward at the society. The creature says,\n\nAm I to be thought the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix. […] Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\n\n(204)\n\nAs Connie puts it, \"I murdered them dead. Because they are the violence-prone. Theirs is the money and the power, theirs the poisons that slow the mind and dull the heart. Theirs are the powers of life and death\" (375).\n\nSome critics (e.g., DuPlessis 3-4) who do question the violence at the end of Woman on the Edge of Time object to it on the grounds that others will perceive the murders as an individual, \"crazy\" act, further evidence of Connie's supposed violent tendencies, rather than a political act, because she left no trail to indicate her motivation. Here, too, Frankenstein is something of a predecessor: the public will not understand the creature's acts. Yet the listener to his story, Walton; the reader in the text, his sister; and we the external readers-listeners have the opportunity to sense something of the broader implications. Connie's act is indeed individual, unlikely to help toward bringing the utopian future into being. Following the murders, she can no longer make contact with Mattapoisett; she had \"annealed her mind\" (375), even as the creature had hardened himself. But the jolt of the shift of point of view to the \"official\" view of Connie in Piercy's last chapter brings readers face to face with the larger context, with the issues that the novel clearly invites them to engage. In a much-quoted passage, Luciente had told Connie that nothing is inevitable: \"We are only one possible future. […] Yours is a crux-time. Alternate universes co-exist. Probabilities clash and possibilities wink out forever\" (177). In different ways—Shelley with her closing pages that bring together the novel's multiple points of view and pull the reader in multiple directions, and Piercy with her last chapter that forces the reader to confront the inadequacy and often downright falsity of an \"objective\" view of Connie—both writers break the reader out of a passive reading stance.6\n\nThus the reader reflects on the complex realities in juxtaposition with the definitions of the creature and Connie. These characters have become the \"monstrous\" beings they were defined to be. Because these definitions so severely circumscribe their choices, the definitions—monolithic, inhumane, and incorrect—have become part of their reality. Who set them? The more powerful; and because the protagonists are so low in the social hierarchy, includes multiple layers. As the creature makes clear, one layer is the common person. Even here there is a hierarchy, with males on top. Felix beats the creature off from the senior De Lacey; a male rustic shoots him after he saves a drowning girl; William invokes the patriarchal authority of his father. (Note that Justine, without status of birth, wealth, or gender, is also defined as a \"monster\" and a \"wretch\" [71].) Geraldo, a common pimp, beats Connie away from Dolly (who submits to his institutionalizing Connie) and then has more credibility than Connie at the hospital; Connie's brother Luis—male, well-dressed, and thus considered a \"reliable informant\" (381)—reinforces the definition. The utopian and dystopian futures Connie visits take this issue of definition in opposite directions: Mattapoisett embraces differences of all kinds; the dystopia rigidly categorizes all people within an oppressive hierarchy.\n\nThe scientists in each novel, of course, have great power to define and to act. In each text the scientist is both target and cause of the violence. Shelley's novel launched science fiction, which \"above all else […] has used its special vision and its unique knowledge to face the history of human power over nature and to ask how that power ought to function\" (Scholes and Rabkin 191). The scientists in Woman on the Edge of Time are pioneering experimenters, as is Dr. Frankenstein, but updated to our century they are not isolated geniuses but collaborators with concerns about funding. Shelley gives Victor the dignity of a mythic model: he is a Modern Prometheus (the subtitle of the novel), an overreacher. And for multiple reasons, including our hearing much of the story from his point of view, the reader is brought into partial sympathy with him. Piercy gives no such dignity to the heartless doctors of Woman on the Edge of Time.\n\nBut there are important similarities. The \"real world\" of Woman on the Edge of Time has become like the science fiction world of Frankenstein. In both cases, the declared intention of the scientists is to do what has not been done before, to gain control over the mysteries of life. Why try to get to those mysteries? Ostensibly to do good for mankind. For Victor, \"life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world\" (38-39). Piercy's doctors cite the good for society of gaining control of violence, which entails controlling human emotion itself. In each case those intentions are complicated (if the control could be achieved, to what extent would we want it to be?), but one factor is the self-interest of the scientist. Frankenstein looks to \"glory\" (26), to the gratitude of \"a new species [that] would bless me as its creator and source\" (39). Piercy's scientists want a successful experiment so they can assert their power, achieve recognition, win grant money (91, 306).\n\nFeminist critics have noted that Frankenstein's scientific quest is described in terms of sexual aggression against (female) nature. Frankenstein sees nature as \"maternal,\" becomes obsessed by a \"fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature,\" and \"pursue[s] nature to her hiding places\" (25, 39). Piercy's scientists are his successors in their experimenting on the literal female: \"cold, calculating, ambitious, believing themselves rational and superior, they chased the crouching female animal through the brain with a scalpel\" (282). Anne Mellor develops the link between \"the exploitation of nature and of the female implicit in a technological society,\" discussing Frankenstein's view of nature as something that should be \"penetrated, analyzed, and controlled\" (38, 100)—just the attitudes Connie's doctors have toward her. If Victor Frankenstein is \"engaged upon a rape of nature\" (Mellor 122), Connie makes the domination explicit: \"they would rape her body, her brain, her self\" (279).\n\nWhen Frankenstein's creature comes to life, he abandons it, with no regard to its possible thoughts and feelings. Connie's doctors, with similar disregard, treat her and her fellow inmates as dispensable laboratory animals. The scientists in a sense play God but are not up to the part. The results in each case are not what they expect or want. Frankenstein says \"the beauty of the dream vanished\" with the reality of the creature (42). The doctors' fantasy of benevolent control in Woman on the Edge of Time meets the reality of unanticipated and uncontrollable consequences, including Skip, \"cured\" of his homosexuality but just waiting for an opportunity to end his life; Alice, \"cured\" of her strong emotions but left a kind of zombie; and Connie, plotting the scientists' murder. The scientists explore the unknown. Yet those whose profession should entail curiosity ironically show no curiosity where one might expect it, much less any empathy and caring. Frankenstein and Connie are objectified, depersonalized. As has frequently been pointed out, Shelley suggests that science divorced from human concerns is itself monstrous, dehumanizing; Piercy certainly does as well.\n\nBoth novels, then, critique the scientists and their utterly determined but heartless ambition, without car- ing, without morality. We see Frankenstein, the isolated, brooding Romantic hero, as introspective, unlike the scientists in Woman on the Edge of Time, but Shelley's novel, too, makes clear that the scientist does not understand: he does not see his own egotism, does not confront the pain he causes, does not confront his responsibility. Right to the end Frankenstein reexamines his conduct and does not \"find it blamable. […] I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being\" (199)—in reference to the possibility of creating a female—but oblivious to his prior responsibility. Frankenstein is contrasted with the creature, who has self-knowledge, sees and accepts responsibility. The doctors in Woman on the Edge of Time, obsessed with their own powers and assured of being in the right, are contrasted with Connie, who lacks confidence in herself, and is bereft by her society of all power, but learns through contact with Mattapoisett that she has more powers than she realized and ultimately accepts responsibility for her actions.\n\nIn the dystopian future that Connie visits, scientists busy in Frankenstein's quest of \"thrusting back the frontiers of life\" (WET [Woman on the Edge of Time] 292) have become unanswerable and completely out of touch with people. Genetic engineering has made it hard to tell who is human and who is not, with men altered for battle and women for sex. That world resembles the society against which the people of Mattapoisett fight, in which the powers of Frankenstein have gone wild, creating \"a population mostly of androids, robots, cybernauts, partially automated humans\" (267).\n\nMattapoisett provides an alternative to the patterns of Connie's present and the dystopian future. Instead of heartless scientists we meet Luciente, a plant geneticist with deep concern for other people and the environment. In this society, the \"result of a full feminist revolution\" as Piercy comments elsewhere (Parti 215), scientists have explicitly turned from the challenge Victor engaged—to triumph over life and death. They considered the possibility and chose not to try, a decision taken by councils, not by an isolated individual, and with careful consideration of all the consequences they \"could foresee or guess\" (277). Many of the key characteristics of this society result from citizens' ongoing attempts to keep science and technology linked to human concerns.7 They object that the scientists of our day—in which obviously we might include Frankenstein—learned \"never to ask consequences, never to consider a broad range of effects, never to ask on whose behalf\" (196). In Mattapoisett, Piercy specifically revisits Mary Shelley's great theme of human-directed creation. Instead of having a single male attempt to create without a female and then become an uncaring, irresponsible father, she imagines a community that creates children ex utero,8 who each have three caring and responsible parents of any gender. How science and technology are handled is central in both novels.\n\nThe connections between Frankenstein and Woman on the Edge of Time go far beyond passing references in the latter to monsters. Piercy's jumps in narrative from Connie's present world to two antithetical possible futures and finally to her \"official\" history make it clear that Piercy is employing the multiple genres of realist fiction, utopian fiction, dystopian fiction, and medical records. But permeating and unifying these genres are revealing echoes of the first science fiction novel. Science fiction critics note that although the creature lacks a mate, his story \"has had so many offspring that we now recognize it as the progenitor of a species\" (Scholes and Rabkin 6). That assertion sheds light on Woman on the Edge of Time in fairly specific as well as more general ways. The Frankenstein myth connects with and reinforces the key concept in Woman on the Edge of Time of alternative possible futures. Who or what is monstrous? The monstrosity in our world may not lie where we think it does. The monsters are we. But if we create monsters and monstrosity, then we could also do otherwise.\n\nNotes\n\n1. For a sample of the more recent analyses of Woman on the Edge of Time in juxtaposition with feminist utopian writings of 1970s writers like Ursula Le Guin, Joanna Russ, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Dorothy Bryant, Suzy McKee Charnas, Sally Miller Gearhart, and Mary Staton, see Spector, Fitting, Bammer, Drake; with traditions of utopian writing, see Ferns, Kessler (\"Fables\"); with Charlotte Perkins Gilman, see Jones. To date, the nearest that literary criticism has come to bringing together Woman on the Edge of Time and Frankenstein may be in the separate chapters on utopian fiction and science fiction in Cranny-Francis's book on feminist uses of generic fiction (that is, aside from a single phrase I discovered after writing this essay [Jones 124]). Piercy was certainly aware of the works of the Romantics: she notes the influence on her at age fifteen of Byron, Shelley (presumably Percy in this context), and Keats; later Blake and Wordsworth (Parti 305). Levine is one of many who have emphasized \"reverberations of Frankenstein through the subsequent literature, even where no direct allusion is intended\" (21). This essay draws on the 1831 revised edition of Shelley's text, the one most widely available. Page numbers to both primary works will appear in the text, with abbreviations where needed for clarity (F for Frankenstein, WET for Woman on the Edge of Time).\n\n2. Parrinder cites this preface as \"an aesthetic statement closely anticipating modern theories of the science-fiction genre\" (6; cf. Scholes and Rabkin 192).\n\n3. This linking of the creature and Connie accords with many recent feminist interpretations of Frankenstein that see the creature, constructed and marginalized, as suggestive of woman in a male-dominated society (e.g., Poovey 128, Cranny-Francis 44, Purinton 59-60). Linking the creature and Connie also accords with recent analyses of class issues in Frankenstein (e.g., Vlasopolos, Perkins, O'Flinn). Haraway links \"constructions of women of color and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction\" (93).\n\n4. The only book-length study of Piercy's novels to date, en route to demonstrating Piercy's celebration of the \"life enhancing\" impulse toward connection and her main theme of \"the repair of the world\" (Shands 22), does not discuss the ending of Woman on the Edge of Time at all.\n\n5. Baldick, pointing to the Oxford English Dictionary notes that \"the fear that human society may itself be producing monsters emerges as early as 1697\" (53). He traces the terms \"monster\" and \"monstrous\" through Shakespeare and elsewhere as linked with rebellion and disobedience, especially toward parents. The terms were much in the air in Shelley's day, linked with social issues: Burke had used them to discuss rebellion, whereas Paine as well as Shelley's own parents Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin reversed the reference to portray as monstrous the aristocracy and the class system (Baldick 54-60).\n\n6. For the effect on the reader of Woman on the Edge of Time, see, for example, Kessler, \"Woman\" 315; Rosinsky 95-96; Orr 73. See Fitting and Cranny-Francis, for example, concerning Piercy's novel within the context of other narratives of a visitor to utopia as they create an activist reading position. Readers come to see their own world as not \"natural or obvious or inevitable, but a construction of particular parameters (economic, social, political), and therefore liable to transformation\" (Cranny-Francis 116). Cranny-Francis and many others emphasize, however, that such contemporary feminist utopias as Woman on the Edge of Time should not be viewed as \"blueprints\" for specific actions (140). Booker briefly notes that the ending of Woman on the Edge should be read as ambiguous (341).\n\n7. Baruch and others note that emphasis on this connection is representative of much women's utopian and science fiction (xiii). Maciunas develops at some length Piercy's handling of feminist views of science.\n\n8. This feature of Woman on the Edge of Time has received considerable critical attention, often in connection with Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectics of Sex (1972). Piercy thus creates a Brave New World revisited, but perceived quite differently, a linkage that is occasionally noted in the criticism but deserves further attention. The connections are quite conscious, as revealed in Piercy's comments on Huxley's novel in her preceding novel Small Changes (1973, 393).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAdams, Karen C. \"The Utopian Vision of Marge Piercy in Woman on the Edge of Time.\" Ways of Knowing: Essays on Marge Piercy.

He steps out of the placeless space of our most terrifying nightmares. For many fans of the novel and its filmic adaptations, the murders of Frankenstein are likewise situated in a shadowy land of Gothic fantasy and thrill-provoking manipulations of our unconscious. Thanks to recent scholarship, however, many of the historicities of Frankenstein —its interactions with French Revolutionary era discourses about gender, race, class, revolution, and science—are now as recognizable to informed readers as its psychodrama.1 But we have only begun to decipher the significance of the geography of this novel, the rationale for setting its horrors in particular places, arranged in a specific sequence. Franco Moretti's Atlas of the European Novel 1800-1900 argues that \"in modern European novels, what happens depends a lot on where it happens,\" but omits Frankenstein from his analysis.2 Does it really matter that William Frankenstein dies at Plainpalais, Justine Moritz and Alphonse in or near Geneva, Elizabeth at Evian, and Henry Clerval in Ireland? Does Victor's trip through England and Scotland serve any purpose except to evoke personal memories of Mary and Percy Shelley? Why does the novel begin and end in Russia and the Arctic?\n\nMary Shelley inherited a usage of the Gothic that, in contrast with the expectations of many modern readers, foregrounded history and geography. As Chris Baldick and Robert Mighall have shown, Renaissance humanists used \"Gothic\" to refer scornfully to the architecture of northern European barbarians (as they viewed them), with particular reference to the Germanic and the medieval, but late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century English Protestant writers typically set their \"Gothic\" fictions in Catholic southern Europe, while keeping the term's crucial association with the archaic and oppressive.3 \"Gothic,\" therefore, was implicated in shifting regionalist, nationalist, and sectarian mythologies, but it was characteristically used to align the author and reader with the supposedly enlightened, against the anachronistic and benighted. \"The present study,\" Robert Mighall writes, \"will challenge the notion that settings in the Gothic are its most dispensable properties, by observing how various historical and political factors help to shape the narrative material and determine those settings.\" He excludes Frankenstein, however, from the history of Gothic and from his own treatment, on the ground that its greatest horrors are the product of enlightenment and a projected futurity rather than \"legacies from the past.\"4 I suggest, by contrast, that Mary Shelley's novel is an astute extension and complication of the political geography of Gothic, as applied to the spread of revolutionary ideas, and revolution itself, in Europe and beyond since the mid-seventeenth century. She complicates the Gothic fear of being pulled back into a despotic past by exposing the despotic residue which, in her view, can shadow—but not stop—a potentially liberating, progressive process. At a time when the Congress of Vienna had just given official status to a reactionary interpretation of the French revolutionary era and a reactionary reconstitution of Europe as a whole, Mary Shelley imagines a liberal alternative through the geographical subtext of a European Gothic fiction. She anticipates Percy Bysshe Shelley's \"A Philosophical View of Reform\" (1819) by opting for an international and comparatist frame of reference, invoking a relatively long-range perspective, and urging the need for the dominant forces of society to abandon Restoration intransigence in favor of fundamental reform—a liberal version of enlightenment—as the only alternative to the spread of violent revolution.5\n\nI. Ingolstadt and Northern Ice\n\nLee Sterrenburg first showed why Mary Shelley chose Ingolstadt in Bavaria, as the place where Victor Frankenstein brought the monster to life.6 An influential ultraconservative cleric, the Abbé Augustin Barruel, whose Memoirs, Illustrating the History of Jacobinism Mary and Percy read on their honey- moon, had claimed that the French Revolution was the product of a conspiracy of intellectuals originating in that university town. The novel's indebtedness to Barruel is even more extensive than Sterrenburg suggested. When Adam Weishaupt founded a secret society called the \"Illuminees\" at Ingolstadt on 1 May 1776, he \"formed a monstrous digest,\" in Barruel's words, of the various kinds of subversive thinking already current in the Enlightenment, much as Victor Frankenstein combines an assortment of body parts to form his monster.7 Like Victor, Weishaupt led a double life at the University of Ingolstadt: distinguishing himself in respectable academic pursuits while secretly, in the privacy of his rooms, pursuing an invisible project.
