        "text": "On August 30, 1797, in London, England, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was born to Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin. Ten days later, her mother died, leaving her to be raised by her father, a political philosopher and novelist. She didn't receive formal education but was surrounded by an intellectual community and was encouraged by her father to write.\n\nIn 1912 at age 14, Mary met poet and future-husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, 5 years older and an admirer of her father's writing. Two years later, they began a courtship not approved of by Mary's father, and would meet at her mother's grave in the St. Pancras churchyard until they eloped in July 1814. Mary and Percy began a daily journal that she kept writing in through 1844, and that she anonymously published in 1817 called History of a Six Weeks' Tour of France, Switzerland, and Germany. They initially return to England in September of 1814 with Mary pregnant, but it was not their only visit to Europe.\n\nIt was in June of 1816 during a trip to Geneva, Switzerland where Mary conceived of Frankenstein and his monster from a \"waking dream\" during a ghost-writing contest with her husband and their friends. When it was first published in 1818, critics believed it had been written by a man, some assuming it was her Mr. Shelley instead. Initial public analysis of Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus was focused through the lens of then-current politics. Now interpretations range from a mythical focus, as suggested by the mention of Prometheus, to considerations of women's experiences of oppression, repression, and motherhood.\n\nMary Shelley had four children, but only the fourth child lived past infancy. Percy Shelley drowned in 1822, which left financial control to his father Sir Timothy Shelley. Mary was required to return to England and restricted in publishing with the Shelley name. Despite the financial insecurity and control that lasted through 1844, Mary succeeded in financing her son's education and continued writing and publishing for herself and her late husband. During her final years, she continued in her travels before eventually dying of a brain tumor in London at age 53.\n\nIn the two centuries since its first publishing, Frankenstein has remained Mary Shelley's best-known work and has been reimagined in numerous adaptations across all story formats. The popularity of her story has given cause for her birthday to be renamed National Frankenstein Day. While Dr. Frankenstein and his creature may sometimes get confused in name as one and the same, there could never be another Mary Wollenstonecraft Shelley. Celebrate her birthday by reading one of her books!\n\nFactual information from Gale In Context: Biography and Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.\n\nMovie Adaptations for Adults:\n\nImage\n\nMovie Adaptations for Kids:\n\nImage"
