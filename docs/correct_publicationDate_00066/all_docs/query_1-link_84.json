        "text": "About the Book:\n\nFrankenstein’s monster has become so famous that its form and features have engulfed those of its creators — firstly the protagonist, the Swiss scholar Victor Frankenstein, and secondly the author of the novel herself, Mary Shelley. He dominates to such an extent that the name Frankenstein is often mistakenly attributed to the monster resurrected from the dead, a formidable reputation which has lasted for over two centuries.\n\nNo one could have imagined that these three hundred pages, written in two large notebooks and kept at the prestigious Bodleian Library in Oxford since 2004, would have had such a significant influence on the worlds of literature, cinema, theatre, and the arts. For a novel which was published anonymously in only 500 copies on 1 January 1818, the book has been adapted and retold too many times to count.\n\nThis manuscript facsimile brings the original text to life in spectacular details, complete with all of Shelley's edits, revisions, and notes.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nMary Shelley (1797-1851), the daughter of pioneering thinkers Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, eloped with the poet Percy Shelley at the age of sixteen. Three years later, during a wet summer on Lake Geneva, Shelley famously wrote her masterpiece, Frankenstein. The years of her marriage were blighted by the deaths of three of her four children, and further tragedy followed in 1822, when Percy Shelley drowned in Italy. Following his death, Mary Shelley returned to England and continued to travel and write until her own death at the age of fifty-three.\n\nAbout the Publisher:\n\nSP Books – standing for Éditions des Saints Pères – was founded in Saint-Germain-des-Prés by young publishers Jessica Nelson & Nicolas Tretiakow with the aim of creating a unique collection of great manuscripts. SP Books was born from our passion for outstanding stories, beautiful books, and above all, the original manuscripts of great works. As our lives grow increasingly digital, SP Books are committed to creating a reading experience that is at once revelatory, intimate and aesthetic: to restore the magic of handwriting to great works, that can be revisited and kept forever.\n\nDetails:\n\n25.5 x 35.5 cm, 328 pages\n\nOxford blue, in slipcase\n\nLimited numbered edition,1,000 copies"
