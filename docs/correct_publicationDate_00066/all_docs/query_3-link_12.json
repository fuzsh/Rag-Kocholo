        "text": "“Solitude was my only consolation – deep, dark, deathlike solitude.” – Mary Shelley, Frankenstein\n\nby Natasha O’Hara\n\nDuring a brainstorming session for the blog earlier this month, the topic of Frankenstein kept resurfacing. We did not intend on having a “Frankenstein February”, it happened organically. My personal interest was sparked by watching the 2017 romantic period-drama Mary Shelley, featuring Elle Fanning as the mother of sci-fi horror (the film is currently available on the Roku Channel).\n\nMary Shelley, an author ahead of her time, penned seven novels, a slew of short stories and articles, and even edited the works of her husband, romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. However, she is best remembered for her 1818 masterpiece “Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus”. The enduring popularity of her work, even after two centuries, is a testament to Shelley’s extraordinary talent. Perhaps her ability to capture profound themes of loss and ambition at such a young age stemmed from her own experiences with sorrow and heartbreak throughout her life.\n\nBorn on August 30th, 1797, in London, Mary Shelley’s lineage was steeped in literary and philosophical brilliance. Her mother was the renowned feminist and author Mary Wollstonecraft, while her father was the philosopher and political journalist William Godwin. Tragically, Mary Wollstonecraft passed away just ten days after giving birth to Mary. William Godwin later remarried another Mary, Mary Jane Clairmont in 1801, who (in true evil-stepmother fashion) already had two children of her own. The strained relationship between Mary and her stepmother is vividly depicted in the film.\n\nSeeking solace from her tumultuous home life, Mary often found herself reading and daydreaming at her mother’s grave. Her education was unconventional, as she did not attend school but rather grew up amidst her father’s intellectual circle and educated herself. At the age of 14, she published her first poem, “Mounseer Nongtongpaw”. In 1812, she was sent to live in Scotland, where she experienced a sense of familial stability with William Baxter and his daughters, Christina and Isabel, offering a contrast to her home life.\n\nUpon her return to London at the age of 16, Mary met Percy Bysshe Shelley, a young poet and political disciple of her father. Despite Shelley being married with a child, a romantic relationship blossomed between the two. Their elopement across Europe caused a rift with Mary’s father, who disowned her until she legalized her union with Shelley.\n\nDuring this period, Mary faced profound personal challenges. In 1815, she gave birth prematurely to a baby girl who tragically passed away after only a few weeks. Later, Mary experienced a life-threatening miscarriage. Out of Mary’s four children, only one survived beyond infancy.\n\nIn the summer of 1816, Mary and Percy spent time near Geneva, Switzerland, with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Jane Clairmont. This gathering became the birthplace of “Frankenstein.” Sequestered indoors by rainy weather, the group entertained themselves by telling ghost stories. Lord Byron then proposed a competition to see who could write the most frightening ghost story, leading Mary to pen the iconic novel.\n\nIn 1816, Mary’s half-sister, Fanny Imlay, tragically overdosed on opium, and Percy’s wife also died by suicide around the same time. Mary and Percy were married in December 1816, and Mary published a travelogue of their European journey, “History of a Six Weeks’ Tour” (1817). “Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus” was anonymously published in 1818, leading to speculation that Percy had written the book due to his introduction, an assumption that continues to undermine Mary Shelley’s authorship.\n\nFour years after “Frankenstein’s” publication, Percy Shelley drowned at 29 years old while sailing his boat, the Don Juan, during a storm near Italy, leaving Mary a widow at 24. Despite this loss, Mary continued writing, producing more novels. In 1824, Lord Byron passed away from a fever, further impacting Mary’s emotional landscape, as seen in her 1826 science fiction novel “The Last Man,” where she wrote of being “the last relic of a beloved race, my companions extinct before me.”\n\nTowards the end of her life, Mary faced financial and physical struggles. She first reported symptoms of pressure on the brain around 1843 and passed away in 1851 at the age of 53 from an undiagnosed brain tumor.\n\nMary Shelley’s life was marked by tragedy, resilience, and a fierce intellect that transcended the societal norms of her time. Her legacy as a radical author endures, inspiring generations of readers and writers to ponder the depths of human ambition and the consequences of our creations.\n\n."
