        "text": "The Mother of Science Fiction\n\nMary Wollstonecraft Shelley was born on August 30, 1797. She is an author, most famous for her book, Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus.\n\nShe was only 18-years-old when we wrote the book that would become the first science fiction book. She married philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley and was the daughter of famous romantic philosopher, Mary Wollstonecraft.\n\nThere was speculation that Shelley's husband wrote more of the classic novel than originally thought, but in recent years, it has been noted that Percy Bysshe Shelley was nothing more than an editor, and barely one at that when it came to the writing of Frankenstein.\n\nShelley was mother to one surviving son, Percy Florence Shelley. Additionally, she wrote other novels including Valperga: Or, the Life and Adventures of Castruccio, Prince of Lucca, The Last Man, The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck, A Romance, Lodore, Falkner. A Novel, and Mathilda. However, Frankenstein remains her most popular and well-known piece of writing.\n\nLearn More About Mary Shelley\n\nA list of non-fiction books for adults and children about the woman who created the science fiction genre.\n\nView Full List\n\nGothic Fiction and Romanticism\n\nGothic fiction or gothic horror is a type of literary fiction that features fear, hauntings and often supernatural elements. It was born from romanticism that was an 18th century artistic movement in England.\n\nFrankenstein was not the first, nor was it the last, gothic novel of the period. The genre was expansive and very popular especially with female readers. The influence of the genre continues today in many modern works such as Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia, The Essex Serpent by Sarah Perry and Once Upon a River by Diane Setterfield. However, the best way to learn about gothic fiction is to read the original sources, still printed and available today.\n\nIf You Liked...Frankenstein\n\nThese are other gothic novels of the time, with similar writing styles and helped create literature as we know it today.\n\nView Full List\n\nThe Influence in Modern Media\n\nIt is undeniable that Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; Or The Modern Prometheus has had heavy influence on media and pop culture.
