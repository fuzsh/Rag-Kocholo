        "text": "How did a 19 year old girl — a lass who never went on to anything that matched the genius of her career defining book — write Frankenstein, one of the first true science fiction novels?\n\nThe conventional account of how Mary Shelley, a teenager, came to invent Dr Frankenstein and his monster is of a \"waking dream\" brought on by a drinking session with some of Britain's most notorious Romantic poets. But a new book, The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein, claims Shelley, an icon of modern feminism, was a fraud who did not dream up the gothic monster in response to a challenge by Lord Byron on the shores of Lake Geneva.\n\nThe author, John Lauritsen, claims the true credit for the world's first science fiction novel should go to Percy Bysshe Shelley, her future husband, who was present that night.\n\nWhat's strange about this to me is that I always thought it was rather common wisdom that Percy Bysshe Shelley probably had a hand in Frankenstein... at the very least, in refining it. Certainly it was a theory most of my literature professors would murmur about occasionally. It's no surprise to me that such a theory is controversial, although it is surprising to me that anyone could seriously lay claim to it being original and new.\n\nI have to say, I sympathize with Hilary Bailey's thoughts on the theory: \"The style of Frankenstein is, to be brutal, clotted and pedestrian. Shelley didn't write it, and if he did, it would be kinder not to say so.\" It's a great book, but it's a great book of ideas, not of prose.\n\nFrankenstein's Fraud [Perth Now]\n\nThe Studio Executive Who Wants Hollywood to Get Real About Bad Storytelling\n\nAs the entertainment industry rebounds, Kamala Avila-Salmon, head of inclusive content at Lionsgate, wants to make sure it comes back healthier than before.\n\nThe Best Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids\n\nThese WIRED-tested hearing aids are affordable, audiologist-approved alternatives to prescription devices.
