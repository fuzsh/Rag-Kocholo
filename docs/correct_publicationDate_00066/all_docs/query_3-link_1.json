        "text": "Title First publication Notes Online text Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus 3 vols. London: Printed for Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, & Jones, 1818 (MS 1816-revised until 1831) There are six important versions of Frankenstein, two manuscript and four printed: \"Shelley's manuscript; the fair copy manuscript, the 1818 first edition, the 1821 second overall edition published in Paris translated into French by Jules Saladin with strong emphasis on black magic and the supernatural to which the book was the first to attribute Mary Shelley as the author of Frankenstein and the only such edition to do so during the lifetime of Percy Shelley who was said to be extremely proud of the 1821 edition. The first edition of 1818 and second overall edition of 1821 were the only editions of Frankenstein to be published as a three volume set with the 1821 edition being the rarest of all printed editions. The annotated Thomas copy, and the 1831 edition.\"[1] William Godwin edited a version for the press in 1823, but he had no help from Mary Shelley and thus the edition is usually disregarded. Mary Shelley revised the 1818 text in 1831, creating a substantially new text. The editors of the Broadview Press edition of the novel write that \"the 1818 and 1831 editions of Frankenstein are best treated as two separate texts\".[1] Anne K. Mellor argues that after her personal tragedies, Shelley altered the text to suggest that humans could not control their own destinies and Maurice Hindle notes that the \"1831 version strips the novel of much of its context, removing a number of references to contemporary science...and Godwinian philosophy.\"[1] Frankenstein Valperga: Or, the Life and Adventures of Castruccio, Prince of Lucca 3 vols.
