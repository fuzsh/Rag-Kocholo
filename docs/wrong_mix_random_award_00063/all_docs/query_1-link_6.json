Original cloth. Near Fine, without dust jacket. \"Siegbahn clearly recognized that the only way to lay bare the inner secrets of the atom was to develop X-ray spectroscopy to such perfection that the spectral line produced by every electron transition should be accurately recorded on the photographic plate. Through years of patient and unremitting work Siegbahn and his co-workers . went far toward attaining this objective\" (Heathcote, Nobel Prize Winners in Physics, p. 223). Siegbahn&#8217;s \"Spektroskopie der Roentgenstrahlen . translated . as The Spectroscopy of X-Rays . contains many of his school's results, including a chronologically arranged bibliography of these and related advances in x-ray spectroscopy\" (D. S. B. 18: 825). The English translation contains a new preface and additions by Siegbahn. Uncommon. Siegbahn: Nobel Prize, Physics, 1924, \"for his discoveries and research in the field of X-ray spectroscopy.\"."
