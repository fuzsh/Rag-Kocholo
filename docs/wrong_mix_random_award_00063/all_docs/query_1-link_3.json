        "text": "This Swedish photograph is in the public domain in Sweden because one of the following applies:\n\nThe photograph does not reach the Swedish threshold of originality (common for snapshots and journalistic photos) and was created before 1 January 1974 (SFS 1960:729, ยง 49a).\n\nThe photograph was published anonymously before 1 January 1954 and the author did not reveal their identity during the following 70 years (SFS 1960:729, ยง 44).\n\nFor photos in the first category created before 1969, also {{PD-1996}} usually applies. For photos in the second category published before 1929, also {{PD-US-expired}} usually applies.\n\nIf the photographer died before 1954, {{PD-old-70}} should be used instead of this tag. If the author died before 1926, also {{PD-1996}} usually applies.\n\nYou must also include a United States public domain tag to indicate why this work is in the public domain in the United States. Note that a few countries have copyright terms longer than 70 years: Mexico has 100 years, Jamaica has 95 years, Colombia has 80 years, and Guatemala and Samoa have 75 years. This image may not be in the public domain in these countries, which moreover do not implement the rule of the shorter term. Honduras has a general copyright term of 75 years, but it does implement the rule of the shorter term. Copyright may extend on works created by French who died for France in World War II (more information), Russians who served in the Eastern Front of World War II (known as the Great Patriotic War in Russia) and posthumously rehabilitated victims of Soviet repressions (more information)."
