        "text": "One of the greatest mathematicians of all time, yet with so few knowing her name, not the easiest thing at the end of the 19th century, let me introduce to you Emmy Noether.\n\nAmalie “Emmy” Noether (which you pronounce “NERter”) was born in Erlingen, Germany, on 23 March 1882 as the eldest of four children, albeit with only two surviving to adulthood. She would soon follow her family’s vocational history as mathematicians – her father Max Noether being a prominent professor at Universities of Erlingen and Heidelberg and her brother Fritz becoming a distinguished applied mathematician. However, in her primary education Emmy’s focus was on languages, especially French, English, and piano amd eventuallt becoming a certified girls’ school French and English teacher by 1900, but she quickly found maths more engrossing. She found a passion in cooking as well. Emmy’s mother was named Ida Amalie, whom Emmy was named after. However, naturally, Emmy found maths more engrossing and applied to study at her local University of Erlingen, where her brother studied and her father worked, but due to her sex she was prohibited from studying there. However they let her audit for taking classes at the University of Göttingen in 1903 and 1904 and she did so well at her exams in the end of this period that the University granted the equivalence of a Bachelor’s degree, hence giving her permission for a doctorate degree. Then in 1904 she returned to Erlangen for a doctorate when they started admitting women. She graduted there cum laude in 1907 with her dissertation on algebraic invariants as the second woman ever, the first one graduating in the preceding year, with a degree in mathematics. Emmy would associate with many contemporary ingenious mathematicians, all of which who realised her astounding potential, and almost tangible sense of humour, and persistently attempted to acquire her a teach position at a university, a paid one. Emmy had until then worked as an unpaid assistant for her father Max Noether’s research at Erlangen’s Mathematics Institute.\n\nWhen Emmy started her university studies it was not yet allowed in Germany for women to attend university so could only sit there as observer. This precarious position of hers in being an ingenious matematician of a woman would require her to publish several of her revolutionary papers, concerning abstract algebra and ring theory and many other intricate fields, under a pseudonymic male name. When she applied her mathematical findings onto what she observed around her in nature, that’s when she truly changed our paradigm. At the University of Erlangen, where she’d work for many years without pay, as well as at University of Göttingen, until finally getting a paid position there in 1915 when she was invited there by fellow mathematicians Felix Klein and David Hilbert, initially to further explore the mathematics behind Einstein’s theory of relativity, as a permanent “guest lecturer”, in spite of the ferocious objections of the faculty at Götting against a female lecturer. However, Emmy was solely allowed to lecture in classes under Hilbert’s name, but it would dwell three more years, until 1922, before her work would yield her a small salary. Emmy’s cohort of students, so conspicuously being all male, became known as “Noether’s boys”, travellimg from as far away as Russia to study under her. A loving person, Emmy was always willing to listen to her students’ problems. Almost as out of spite for the discrimination she faced, Emmy commenced swimming at a University’s all-male swimming pool. In 1918 she discovered her Noether’s theorem, henve gaining her the fortune of the position as a formal academic lecturer in 1919. In 1927, after having embarked upon her reputation as an eminent mathematician for the past seven years since the 1920 publication of “Concerning Moduli in Noncommutative Fields, Particularly in Differential and Difference Terms” in German, Emmy concocted the newly discovered field of conceptual noncommutative algerbra. In addition to this she also edited a mathematical science journal, and comprised Göttingen’s mathematical centre 1930-1933, although a substantial part of her mathematical ingenuity appeared through her students’ and colleagues’ papers.\n\nEmmy in white at colleagues at Göttingen.\n\nAt the University of Göttingen, where she’d remain until her migration to the USA in 1933, Emmy studied mathematical invariance with numbers being manipulated whilst still remaining the same, like gravitational forces remaining constant even though a planet’s orbit may change. After the 1915 publish of Einstein’s theory of relativity Emmy started applying this to her own work, which would ultimately create her own Noehter’s theorem. Nother’s theorem, concerning the natural symmetry of the universe and how this is related to the conservation of mass or energy or charge or momentum or something similar, which laid the basis for modern theoretical physics, including the theory and findings of the Higgs boson. In simple terms, it also explains how a bicycle can stand up. Some people even consider her work to be of equal importance to Einstein’s theory of relativity and it comprises the backbone of modern physics.\n\nEven though the pacifist Emmy first laughed, as so often, when a handful of students attended her classes dressed in Hitler’s brownshirts, in 1933 Emmy was obliged to migrate to the US as she was fired from her position, together with all other Jews there, at the University of Göttongen due to her being a Jewess in Hitler’s Nazi Germany. In the USA Einstein had acquired her a position as a visiting professor at the all-female Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania where she would encounter a gratitude and awe never yet faced in Germany. She also lectured and conducted research at Princeton University’s Institute for Advanced Study.\n\nIn 1935 Emmy was operated for an ovarian cyst. However, the operation was unsuccessful and due to complications she perished only a few days afterwards, on 14 April, without ever marrying nor fostering any children, in spite of her notoriously gay and humorous personality. She loved her maths more than anything and her students of remarked on how the bobby pins one by one fell out of her far-from-neat hair, without herself giving them much notice, as she so passionately discussed the mathematical problems in such an intricate way. Emmy contributed to rearing a few extraordinary mathematicians, the few who could apprehend her teachings, as she truly taught them to teach themselves. Throughout her lifetime, over forty papers were published by Noether.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Emmy-Noether\n\nhttp://www.alltomvetenskap.se/nyheter/vem-var-emmy-noether\n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/emmy-noether-should-be-your-hero-180962591/\n\nhttps://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/emmy-noether-507.php\n\nhttp://www.sdsc.edu/ScienceWomen/noether.html\n\nhttps://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/noether.htm\n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/03/27/science/emmy-noether-the-most-significant-mathematician-youve-never-heard-of.html\n\nMaria Sibylla Merian, the world’s first ecologist and entomologist, was born on the 2nd of April 1647 in Germany’s Frankfurt am Maim. Her marvellous drawings of the various insects of the world are one of the more famous features of her career. Merian’s observations of metamorphis, contributing to the contradicting of the vitalism theories also by cultivating insects of her own (the long-prevailing theory that life “just” emerges), helped set up the foundation for the field of entomology, the study of insects.\n\nYoung Maria.\n\nIn 1650, when Maria was merely 3 years old, her father the famous painter Matthäus Merian father died, leaving little Maria to be raised by her mother and stepfather Jacob Marrel, him, too, being a painter, but a still-life one. Hence, due the family history of painting, Maria was allowed to study painting, being tutored by the Marrel family (women were not allowed at art academies until modern times) at their home in Frankfurt. For their compositions, she collected insects and caterpillars and plants for them – a silkworm for was the first ever insect that would perpetuate Merian’s entomological interests. Merian’s first interest was in painting flowers, only to progress into painting intimate depictions of insects. To study them more efficiently, Merian set up her own collection of insects, to observe how the caterpillars mature into becoming butterflies. For their quality, in the 17th century, Merian’s illustrations and intricate observations were truly extraordinary.\n\nIn 1665, at the age of 16, Merian married fellow painter Johann Andreas Graff, also an apprentice of the Marrel’s, and 1668 they had their first child Johanna Helena and the family moved to Johann’s childhood city Nuremberg, where they would live for the following fourteen years and during which time Merian made her first drawings of common flowers which were to be published in her three-volume Blumenboch, Book of Flowers, to be published between 1675-1680, to be reprinted as “The New Book of Flowers”. Merian alternated the common practice of motherhood with caring for and painting her insects.\n\n1678 Merian had her second daughter Dorothea Maria, and in 1679 Merian’s thorough two-decade-long scrutinies of her engrossing caterpillars were finalised into her work Caterpillars, Their Wondrous Transformation and Peculiar Nourishment from Flowers, with its sequel being published four years later, in which Merian’s observations of the moth’s and the butterfly’s metamorphis being elucidated. What was interesting with Merian’s work, however, was that she in essence was an ecologist, as all of her illustrations showed the insects together with the plant source by which they were found, thus emphasising the importance of the connection an insect has with its context, and the every stage of metamorphis and the insects’ lives depicted were intricately described as well.\n\nAfter Marrel’s death in 1681, the Merian family moved back to Frankfurt to take care of Merian’s widowed mother. However, perhaps due to some marital issues, Graff alone returned to Nuremberg in 1685 and in 1686 Merian, her daughters, and mother travelled to Wiewert village in modern-day the Netherlands, where she would join an almost-sect, and when Graff attempted to win his independent wife back and where produced even more paintings. One year after her mother’s death, 1691, Merian moved to Amsterdam, where she legally would be divorced from Graff (quite a scandal at the time!). Thenceforth, Merian would support herself by selling her paintings. However, Merian wanted more as she heard of the enthralling natural phenomena taken back from explorers of the New World. Moreover, her illustrious depictions of nature made her a grand name, a name worthy of invitations to observe the various collections of the artist elite. With persistence as one of her most favoured traits, Merian for eight years straight studied and drew the insects and plants of Amsterdam and its surroundings, causing her to gain a grant – typically exclusively given to extraordinary men of the time – from the City of Amsterdam to travel to Suriname to study its natural world.\n\nQuite astonishingly, in June 1699 Merian set sail to the New World, Suriname (a colony the Dutch had traded with the English for Manhattan), together with her younger daughter Dorothea for a five-year long expedition where Merian could immerse herself into the wondrous world of insects and plants, a purely scientific excursion. In Suriname she financed herself by selling her paintings, and whilst there she had no protection whatsoever and just managed herself (quite rare for the time being). Together, the mother-daughter team settled in the capital of Paramaribo to collect, study, and illustrate various insects, plants, and animals of the jungles of Suriname, which she investigated in ponderous dresses, wearing corsets and petticoats, in sultry heat as a 50-year-old woman. She went to riverbanks, sugar plantations, the rain forest, the gardens in Paramaribo, and climbed trees and paid the indigenous people (and slaves, but she was ahead of her time in that way that she wrote in letters about the injustice in slavery and how women could liberate themselves through science) to bring her more insects to assay. Once again a pioneer in her field, Merian seldom took the insects out of their natural habitats, but studied them in their natural settings. However, unfortunately, Merian couldn’t fulfil the expedition, but terminated it 3 years in advance due to an unexpected affliction of malaria and so she travelled back to Amsterdam. Still, Merian had accumulated sufficient data for her 60 copperplate engravings of different stages of development of various insect cycles, in total 186 insects’ life cycles. Back in Amsterdam Merian in 1704 published these in her most famous work Magnus Opus, Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium (one of Merian’s works used by Carl Linnaeus in his classifying of insects), colloquially just called Metamorphosis, in particular containing fascinating moths and butterflies – Merian’s special interest – but also other insects and plants and snakes and lizards. So marvellous were her paintings, that on her funeral the year after her death on 13 January 1717 – after having been debilitated by a severe stroke in 1715 – the Russian tsar Peter I purchased all of her remaining paintings. Dorothea followed in her mother’s footsteps and was even summoned by Peter to his newly-built St. Petersburg for her work as a scientific illustrator, and Dorothea was the first woman ever to be accepted into the Russian Academy of Sciences. Merian’s first-born Johanna Helena moved with her husband in 1711 to become an august artist herself.\n\nAt the time of Merian, nobody questioned her revolutionary illustrations and description – her curious European audience were mostly just fascinated with all of her unravelled descriptions of nature. However, the Victorians would question Merian’s work, considering her a typical hysterical woman with inept ideas – being entirely nonsensical and absurd that for example a tarantula could devour a hummingbird, something depicted by Merian. Moreover, the Victorians regarded Merian with incredulity as she in her Metamorphosis expressed opposition to the slavery in Suriname, which naturally contradicted the 19th century colonialists’ paradigm. Still, Darwin’s friend Henry Walter Bates absolved her in 1863 by his own observations of the devouring tarantula. However, it is also to be mentioned that Merian wasn’t immaculate, and sometimes she paired together the wrong caterpillars with the wrong butterflies when illustrating their alleged stages of metamorphis, and she also drew, for example, four eggs in a hummingbird’s nest, which typically only contains one. Today Merian is facing revival again, and some of her works were published for the first time as late as in the 1970s.\n\nIn our modern times Merian has been celebrated on a Dutch banknote.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Sibylla-Merian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2013/apr/02/maria-sibylla-merian-artist-insects-science\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/the-woman-who-made-science-beautiful/424620/\n\nhttps://www.sierracollege.edu/ejournals/jscnhm/v6n1/merian.html\n\nhttps://www.uh.edu/engines/epi397.htm\n\nOne of the most revolutionary physicists of all time, only to bereaved of her Nobel Prize (not the first time something like this happens!) by her colleague and friend, Lise Meitner is someone who deserves her own herstory.\n\nOn 7 November 1878 in Vienna little Lise Meitner was born as the third of in total eight children. Her father was a wealthy lawyer, whom Lise succeeded to persuade to have her a private tutor for the admissions tests for the University of Vienna. Due to her remarkable results, she was admitted, even though the University of Vienna wasn’t exactly known for promoting women in science.\n\nIn 1901 Meitner was, hear this, as a woman, accepted to the University of Vienna as a physics student under Ludwig Boltzmann. In 1906 she completed her doctorate at the University of Vienna, but as the only position available for her there was as a schoolteacher, the following year she moved on to the University of Berlin to attend the ingenious Max Planck’s lectures. She was supposedly a timid person, but still initiated a collaboration there with the chemist Otto Hahn who worked on radioactivity, and Meitner joined him in the pursuit of deciphering more regarding radioactivity. However, having a woman in the team, the duo was allocated a small cellar room to perform their research, and Meitner was explicitly prohibited from entering the male research laboratories. Still, the Meitner-Hahn cooperation would persist for three decades and both of them led a sector each at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Chemistry at the University of Berlin after its foundation in 1912. In this time period they would also succeed in isolating the isotope protactinium-231 1918, discovering the element protactinium. In 1923 Meitner discovered the Auger effect, named after the French Pierre Victor Auger who discovered the same phenomenon in 1925, which explains when an inner electron is emitted, which results in that an outer valence electron falls back to replace the lost inner one and hence releases energy. After having been at the University without a formal position for almost two decades, Meitner was hired at the University of Berlin in 1926 as the first female professor in Germany, ever. In addition, Meitner also studied nuclear isomerism and beta decay radioactivity. In joint cooperation with physicist Fritz Strassmann Meitner and Hahn assayed uranium when it was bombarded with neutrons, thus resulting in the discovery of nuclear fission. All of her scientific publications she signed as L. Meitner, hiding her identity as a woman.\n\nMeitner and Hahn.\n\nAlways a pacifist, during the first Great War, that is, World War One, Meitner volunteered as an X-ray nurse, helping out in the Austrian army. After the end of the War she returned to Berlin and continued her research in nuclear physics at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.\n\nMeitner was of Jewish descent. Still, she wanted to remain in Germany, pursuing her research. After anschluss in 1938, in July Meitner was fired from her job at the university, but she still continued with her research at home and she wanted to remain in Berlin for as long as possible. In 1938 she barely escaped the Jewish hunt after Germany’s 1938 anschluss, and with only two small suitcases she was smuggled out by research associates, and she acquired a VISA in Sweden, where she ended up in the summer of 1938, where she would become a citizen in 1949 (however, it is to be mentioned, she was not particularly content with Sweden). Otto Hahn and Strassmann continued their research elsewhere and corresponded with Meitner, who continuing her research at Stockholm’s Manne Siegbahn’s institute. However, Siegbahn’s misogyny inhibited Meitner’s progress. He was not a believer of women in science.\n\nIn November 1938 Meitner travelled to Copenhagen to meet with Hahn to construct their new experiments. Hahn performed these in his laboratory in Berlin. However, he and Strassmann encountered a problem leaving them ambivalent – when bombarding uranium with neutrons they acquired a seemingly lighter element, barium. They wrote a letter to Meitner to tackle to problem. Lise was on Christmas holiday in Kungälv, visiting the Swedish physicist Eva von Bahr-Bergius. During a walk, although Frisch went on skis, in Sweden together with her nephew Otto Frisch, who normally worked at Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, Meitner figured it out – the uranium nuclei were split two lighter elements. In January 1939 Otto wrote an article on what the team together had discovered and their results were published, and in February Meitner published explanations for the results and, together with Frisch, coined the term nuclear fission after the biological term binary fission for explaining bacterial cell division. When people realised the immense amount of energy released by this phenomenon, many scientists urged the one and only Albert Einstein to write to the American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as Germany might be working on a radioactive bomb of their own, thereby indirectly initiating the Manhattan Project. Meitner herself was invited to join the project, but as a firm a pacifist she wanted nothing less than for her work to be used for mass destruction. She had intended for fission to be used used for future energy and medicine.\n\nMeitner and Bahr.\n\nFor his work on nuclear fission, Otto Hahn was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry 1944. He claimed that the work was mostly chemical, and not a physical discovery, which thereby consolidated his claim to the prize. In fact, ever since Meitner had escaped Germany Hahn had downgraded her work. Despite only Otto Hahn becoming a Nobel Prize laureate, she still received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1966 together with Hahn and Fritz Strassmann for their joint work on nuclear fission, which was a way to compensate for the mistake in Meitner not receiving her prize. She would also receive many honorary doctorates, and was chosen to be a member of Kungliga vetenskapsakademin in Sweden, the academy that actually elects the scientific Nobel laureates. At Kungliga tekniska högskolan, KTH, she helped develop Sweden’s first nuclear reactor, R1.\n\nIn 1960 she retired to England, where she would die of old age in Cambridge on 27 October 1968, ten days before her 90th birthday. In Cambridge her nephew Frisch worked as a professor in theoretical physics. Even if she never achieved the prodigious Nobel Prize, she was awarded with another of one of the most prestigious recompenses a scientist ever can acquire, in 1992 the heaviest known element in the universe was named after her, Meitnerium (Mt), upon its discovery.\n\nMeitnerium (268).\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Lise-Meitner\n\nhttp://www.atomicarchive.com/Bios/Meitner.shtml\n\nhttp://www.kvinnofronten.nu/Formodrar/lise-meitner.htm\n\nhttp://www.alltomvetenskap.se/nyheter/vem-var-86\n\nhttps://www.kth.se/2.82572/research/historia/4-atomkommitten-karnfysik-och-lise-meitner-1.562021\n\nhttps://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200712/physicshistory.cfm\n\nhttp://bnrc.berkeley.edu/Famous-Women-in-Physical-Sciences-and-Engineering/lise-meitner.html\n\nhttps://www.brainpickings.org/2016/10/27/lise-meitner/\n\nGertrude Margaret Lowithan Bell was born on the 14th of July 1868 in Washington New Hall, County Durham to the wealthy Bell family of iron masters. Even as a young girl Bell was extraordinary, even by modern standards, finding herslef immersed in topics like desert archaeology and alpine mountaineering (a summit in the Swiss Alps has even been namdd in her honour!). At home she obtained her fundamental education, until the age of 15, then to travel to London for further studies. She was witty and astute with her red hair, green eyes, and fine features. After her years in London she was off to Oxford University’s female Lady Margaret Hall college, where she was the first woman in history to obtain a degree in Modern History. However, being a woman, Gertrude wasn’t allowed to graduate. Indeed, overall Gertrude wasn’t too pleased with that typical female customs applied to her as well.\n\nYoung Gertrude.\n\nIn 1892 Gertrude left Oxford, thereafter making her way to Tehran to visit England’s minister (by modern standards, ambassador) in Persia, her uncle Sir Frank Lascelles. She prepared for this journey she by learning Persian, which per se illustrates her auspicuous personality quite well. Enthralled, Gertrude wrote to her father that she had “landed in the Garden of Eden.” During this seemingly imperative trip Bell fell in love in 1892 as well, with member of the foreign service staff Henry Cadogan. They were both passionately engrossed with literature and poetry, amongst others Kipling’s and Henry James’s works. After having travelled back to England in order to obtain her father’s approval of a bethrothal, Bell crestfallenly returned to Persia, without the prospect of marrying her love as her father naturally disapproved of Cadogan’s tendency to gamble and become indebted. They never saw each other again. Bell possibly had another moment of love in her life, and then it was with the already married Major Dick Doughty-Wylie, whom she had a correspondemce with but realized was a mere dream. Bell urged him to divorce his wife, who responded with threatening to attempt suicide. Doughty-Wylie died in Galipoli in 1915.\n\nAnother outcome of the Persian journey, with the exception of her perpetuated fascination with the Middle East, was the publication of Gertrude’s first book, “Persian Pictures.” In 1897 she published one of the greatest translations of Poems from the Divan of Hafiz and in 1907 her “The Desert and the Sown”, chronicles about Arabian cities and deserts. Just sporadically she would venture home, and then to combine them with visits to the Alps in the 1890s. Once she climbed Mont Blanc, which nearly resulted in her death after having hung “forty-eight hours on the rope”, an event which certainly didn’t avert her from jeopardizinh her life, when a blizzard struck one of her many climbing sessions.\n\nGertrude grew very fond of Perisan culture and people on the first Persian journey and thenceforth. She went on desert safaris, was taught Arabic, and visited archaeological goldmines. She mapped the Arabian peninsula to a great extent, and often on her own. She remained there for a while, with her ensemble of camels, male guides, and numerous gifts. As woman in the Middle East, she put herself in a rather perilous position. However, being a stupendous and charismatic orator, she won people over. An archaeologist – finding many elusive artefacts and excavating marvelous sites, an interest of hers that was initiated in 1899 during a family trip to the Greek city of Melos’s excavation – a writer, an explorer, she travelled alone in Middle East during early 20th century. She hadn’t let her sex stop her back in England, neither would she here. Surrounded by male Kurds and Sunni and Shia muslims, they started referring to her as “El Khatun”, the Lady of the Court. Still, she never dressed in Arabian clothing, being of the perspective that “you should come as you are.” That she still went on well with all the Arabic men startled many on the Western front.\n\nAt one archaeological dig in Carchemish, modern-day Iraq, Bell encountered T.E. Lawrence, whom she would form a life-long companionship with.\n\nBell and T.E. “Lawrence of Arabia.”\n\nEvidently a true polyglot, Gertrude mastered 8 languages, including Persian, Arabic, French, and Turkish (although she did consider Arabic particularly difficult). Being so settled in, in the Arabic peninsula and having immersed herself in the Arabic culture and the tribes comprising it and its geography and politics, the British Intelligence service indeed found her quite appealing.\n\nWhen the First World War plagued the planet Gertrude volunteered at the Red Cross in France, but British Intelligence services rather found her more pertinent as the first female officer employed by them in February 1915. She would be stationed in Cairo, as she would be more useful for the Allies there with her profound knowledge of the area. She was occupied at the Arab Bureau, which attempted to accumulate information to break the Ottoman Empire and safeguard British interests in the peninsula. She did this with her partner in crime Lawrence of Arabia and archaeologist David Hogarth. England also requested her to aid Allied soldiers in finding their ways through Arabian deserts.\n\nHer paper on “Self-Determination in Mesopotamia” ascertained her presence at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and in 1921 the secretary of the state in the colonies, Mr. Churchill, invited Bell, his only female guest, to attend a conference i Cairo to set up the borders of Mesopotamia due to her profound knowledge in Arabic tribes and warfare. Getting so many people’s fate in her hands was a sensational feeling for her; she liked seeing herself together with powerful men, as an exception of the female sex. This would not be the only time Gertrude would find herself in the heart of foreign politics. She would later establish the Iraqian borders, along with choosing its first king, King Faisal I, and was paramount on writing the Iraqian Constitution and organize its elections. Moreover, Bell wrote the study “A Review of the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia,” and so was quite involved in thr Iraqian life.\n\nAfter having aged for a while, Gertrude was appointed Honorary Director of Antiquities in Iraq. In 1923 she commenced her work on establishinh the Baghdad Archaeological Museum. She was of the firm belief that archeological finds should remain in their original countries. The Iraqian king, grateful for what she had done for him, dedicated a wing for Gertrude at the museum, which opened in 1926. The museum filled her with pride, as she described in a letter home to England in 1926.\n\nNot long before her 58th birthday, on 12 July 1926 Bell perished after an overdose on sleeping pills. If this was intentional or not still remains unknown to the public, although she had asked her maid to wake her the morning before. After her death Bell’s sister Lady Richmond provided 7000 letters and diaries and photographs regarding Belle to Newcastle University. Further, her legacy is perpetuated through the Gertrude Bell Archives. At her time she might well have been the most powerful woman in the British Empire, and her name was written in newspapers globally. However, after her death influential men ceased acknowledging her, not even in their biographies, and her name was soon forgotten.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/06/the-woman-who-made-iraq/\n\nhttps://www.svd.se/gertrude-bell-kampade-for-ett-fritt-irak\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/forgotten-female-lawrence-arabia-helped-create-modern-middle/amp/\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/12/iraq.jamesbuchan\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/.amp/news/gertrude-bell-biography-facts\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Gertrude-Bell\n\nMary Stuart, more commonly known as Mary Queen of Scot, was born on December 8th 1542 in Linlithgow Palace, Scotland, to King James V and the Fremch noblewoman Mary of Guise. 6 days later James died, and as Mary was his only surviving legitimate child, with two older brothers perishing at before she was born, Mary inherited the Scottish throne. Her uncle Henry VIII aspired for her regency, but instead Mary of Guise became the regent for the little queen. The mother and daughter were moved, for safety reasons, to Stirling Castle on 23 July 1543, and on the 9th of September 1543, Mary not yet one year old, the babe was crowned Queen of Scots. Her protection was put in the hands of Lord Erskine and Lord Livingstone.\n\nAt first, little Mary was betrothed to Henry VIII’s heir and only legitimate son Edward, born to him and Jane Seymour in 1537. As Scotland at the time was Catholic and the great mass objected to this betrothal to the Protestant Edward, as did her guardians, the bethrothal was thus annulled at Stirling Castle, resulting in an enraged England and Henry VIII ordering “The Rough Wooing”, tenacious, barbarian, yet futile raids from England onto Scotland lasting from 1544 to 1551, in attempts to forge a Scottish-English alliance. Instead, the French Mary of Guise betrothed her daughter to the French heir Francis, born 1544. To the French court Mary was sent in August 1548, where she would grow up. Being educating the finest manner, excelling in both dancing and hunting, Mary became fluent in French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, old Scot, and nearly Greek as well in addition to her stupendous musical and writing abilities. Evidently an immaculate bride with her svelte figure of almost 180 centimetres and golden red hair and dark eyes, she married Francis, Catherine de Medici’s and King Henry II’s eldest son, in April 1558. The following year he was crowned King Francis II and Mary his Queen Consort. Even though both were fond of each other, hypotheses are that Mary and Francs never consummated their marriage before he perished due to an ear infection in 1560, widowing the 18-year-old Mary, who exasperatedly returned to Scotland in August 1561. However, her kingdom had been changed, with John Know in 1561 altering their official religion into Protestantism. Mary was alienated, although quite a few also appreciated the cultivated splendour she brought to Scotland. Luckily for her, Mary’s adroit half-brother James Earl of Moray aided Mary in governing a country of different religion than herself by fomenting a religiously tolerant realm. She acquiesced to the Protestant government and was initially lenient in in her ruling in order to keep her power.\n\nIn 1558 Elizabeth Tudor ascended the English throne, but not particularly smoothly. Throughout her reign she would encounter Catholic opposition, with many Roman Catholics favouring putting Mary, her grandmother being Henry VIII’s elder sister Margaret, on the English throne instead. Mary hence having a strong Catholic claim to the English throne, her father-in-law King Henry II claimed the throne in her name.\n\nIn 1565 Mary remarried, this time with her Protestant cousin Henry Stuart Earl of Darnley, with the same grandmother of Margaret Tudor. He was proclaimed Henry King of Scots. Mary hence consolidating her claim to the English throne by marrying another Tudor relative, Elizabeth was enraged, as was James of Moray, feeling alienated and replaced. Even though initially affectionate, the marriage was an unhappy one, with the foolish and sodden Henry spending little time with his wife and his secretary James of Bothwell won Mary’s affection in her husband’s place according to the dubious Casket Letters, alleged love letters and poems from Mary to Bothwell, which most historians however discard as false evidences. Moreover, her beloved Italian secretary David Riozzo was stabbed 56 times by a jealous Henry together with Protestant nobles, Bothwell included. Mary, pregnant at the time, had supper with Riozzo and five close friends in Holyrood House when the mob burst in and dragged Riozzo out of the room, murderinh him. This was in March 1566. In June Mary gave birth to the future James VI of Scotland/I of England, who was baptized into the Roman Catholic faith in Stirling Castle. In October that year Mary fell ill and considered a divorce from Darnley. Mary recuperated, but their relationship never did.\n\nMary and James.\n\nOn the 9th of February 1967 an explosion erupted in Kirk o’ Field, outside Edinburgh, where Henry of Darnley was residing after a period of illness. As his and his servant’s bodies were found outside of the mansion, as if someone had strangled them, the act was dubious and the Earl of Bothwell James Hepburn was the main suspect of having murdered the King of Scot. A rumour of Mary being pregnant with James Hepburn spread. In a dire move Mary married James merely three months later, and he then abducted her and resided in Dunbar Castle. Still, Mary was enthralled. He became one of her confidantes and had aspirations of making himself King of Scotland, also of the same supercilious nature as Henry of Darnley. The ominous marriage infuriated the Scottish nobility, which rose against their Queen. On June 15 1567 , from Carberry Hill last seeing his wife, James fled into exile in Dunbar, then off to Denmark where he perished in 1578, allegedly insane. Mary was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle by the Lords of Congregation for her folly, marrying without their approval. There, Mary gave birth to stillborn twins. In July 1567 her government coerced her to abdicate, leaving the throne for her 1-year-old son.\n\nThe following year Mary escaped from Lochleven. In an attempt to regain her throne, she succeeded in gathering an army willing to fight for her. However, it was quickly vanquished at the Battle of Langside, outside of Glasgow, and Mary sought refuge in England. Being the greatest potential usurper, Elizabeth imprisoned Mary for the subsequent 19 years at various castles. Still, that was not entirely sagely done as this provided more reasons for the Catholic population to try to assassinate Elizabeth. In captivity, Mary occupied herself with trifles like embroidery and spending time with birds and lapdogs. She was very fond of animals. Her physical exercise was limited, resulting in a loss of her previously svelte figure and beauty. She pleaded to Elizabeth for impunity, then turned to conspiring schemes as her pleas were met with arrogance.\n\nWhen in captive, Elizabeth’s spymaster Francis Walsingham planted several spies amongst his precious captive. One of these was Anthony Babington, who succeeded in gaining Mary’s trust and offered her a convenient way of smuggling out messages, naturally all written in code (easily deciphered by Walsingham), in beer barrels. Mary had corresponded with a resource resolving that 6 men were planning to murder Queen Elizabeth. When Babington uncovered these, he added, feigned, that Mary would like to know the names of these men. In 1586 he delivered the messages to Walsingham, who immediately deciphered Babington’s plot, but regardless in October he delivered Mary’s scheming to the Queen, finally being able to convince her that Mary needed to be eradicated for Elizabeth’s own safety. Mary was put to trial and found guilty. Her son James, aspiring to inherit the English throne, didn’t object to the verdict. Fretting this decision, Elizabeth complied to Mary’s death sentence. The day for execution Elizabeth was a mess, truly upset over the decision she had had to make, under the admonitions of Walsingham and trusted William Cecil, Baron Burghley, and others.\n\nMary was beheaded in Fotherinhay Castle in Northamptonshire on the 8th of February 1587, not yet 45 years old. When the executioner lifted her head, he supposedly only apprehended her wig. Elizabeth, still sympathetic with her relative, buried Mary in Peterborough Cathedral. However, when Mary’s son James had ascended the English throne he moved his mother’s remains to Buckingham Palace, in Henry VII’s chapel, in 1612 (9 years after his coronation). In 1932 Mary’s collected poems where published under the title “Bittersweet within my Heart”. She was an excellent writer and a polyglot, but she preferred to write in French.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/.amp/people/mary-queen-of-scots-9401343\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/history/people/mary_queen_of_scots/\n\nhttp://scotlandsmary.com/\n\nhttp://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/Mary-Queen-of-Scots/\n\nhttp://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mary-queen-of-scots-beheaded\n\nhttp://m.historyextra.com/article/stuart/mary-queen-scots-what-happened-her-ladies-waiting\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Mary-queen-of-Scotland\n\nDid you know that one of the United States’ more famous presidents had his wife dictate his presidency for an extensive period? Edith Wilson was the woman behind Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president of the US. Indeed, she is often referred to as the de facto first female president of the United States 1915-1921.\n\nEdith and Woodrow.\n\nEdith White Bolling, was born on October 15th 1972 in Wytheswille, Virginia, as the seventh of eleven children of judge and lawyer William Bolling and homemaker Sarah “Sallie” White Bolling. In spite of the Bolling family’s aristocratic background Edith did not grow up in wealth, as her paternal grandfather had lost his extensive plantation after the Civil War and now his son’s family lived cramped above a store in Wyhtesville. As many other contemporary girls, young Edith was educated at home. She herself claimed to be too shy to join her three older sister who studied to the local school. Instead, Edith’s father and grandmother educated her and helped her read classic literature and learn to tailor dresses. However, her education was scarce and, according to Wilson historian Arthur S. Link, her handwriting was “primitive . . . almost illegible”. Still, she was admitted to Martha Washington College at the age of 15, leaving town for the first time, to study music as her major, but also history and maths. However, Edith was not fond of the school and as it was too cold there and the food was poor Edith left after just one year. She transferred to the minor Powell’s School in Richmond, but as her family prioritized educating her three younger brothers Edith had to leave school in 1890, in spite of her liking of it. Later in her life, before her famous marriage, Edith would be utterly uninterested in politics. The year of 1912, when Woodrow won the presidency for the first time, Edith later recalled that she then wouldn’t even have been able to name a single candidate of that year.\n\nYoung Edith.\n\nVisiting her married older sister in Washington D.C. in 1892 Edith encountered the prodigious jeweller Norman Galt, who was a relative to Edith’s brother-in-law, and four years later went through a marriage less known to the public. Norman’s famous family shop was located not far from the White House. Edith went to a child with Norman, but the son morosely suffered an infant death in 1903, naturally leaving Edith devastated, and in 1908 Norman died as well, leaving Edith with a bountiful bequest. With this substantial sum of money Edith often flew to Europe, becoming a frequent buyer of the Parisian couture designer Worth. Being of a tall and proud figure, Edith was renowned around D.C. and she was often seen driving around the streets in her electric car. She was even the first woman in Washington D.C. to have a car of her own. Police officers often even stopped traffic for her to let her pass through. Still, in spite of her wealth she could never made it to the upper and aristocratic echelons as the money she had accumulated came from a bourgeoisie family.\n\nWoodrow Wilson (1856-1924) had been married to Ellen Wilson, née Axson, since 1885 and she tragically died in 1914. Woodrow was devastated as well, but over a cup of tea at his cousin Helen Bones’s dwellings in the White House he was introduced to Edith Bolling Galt. She had been out with her friend Altrude Gordon who was dating the White House physician Gary Grayson, who also attended Woodrow’s cousin Helen Bones who had joined the two ladies and then invited them over for a cup of tea in March 1915. Both Edith and Woodrow were immediately love-struck and after a few weeks he invited her to dinner, where he felt so confident in Edith that he asked for her advise in whether or not to declare war on Germany after their attack on the Lusitania ship in May 1915, killing many passengers. After a mere few weeks Woodrow asked for Edith’s hand (hint: she said yes). He often sent letters to Edith, whose house the presidential limousine often frequented, on matters ranging from politics to trivial questions. Woodrow’s political advisors tried to dissuade him from remarrying so soon after his first wife’s death, fearing that it would affect the presidential election in November 1915. His trusted set of advisors even concocted love letters to his former lover Mary Peck and released them to the public in an attempt to make Edith run away. However, the couple still wed at Edith’s house in Washington on December 18th 1915 and Edith would thenceforth remember who had tried to disrupt the two lovers. They had a swift and joyful honeymoon in Virginia and, after having settled in the White House a month later, their joy quickly spread to the White House staff. Nonetheless, Woodrow won the election for presidency that year.\n\nWoodrow being an affectionate man, he often encouraged Edith to join him when dealing with politics and he often even read important documents aloud to her, let her read through mails, gave her secret war codes and access to drawers of classified documents, and invited her join him in discussions and meetings with diplomats and advisors, on whom Edith gave Woodrow her opinion. Edith complied to her husband’s wishes, but her political interest remained slight and her primary focus was and continued to be with Woodrow’s health and well-being. She was with him incessantly. However, as Woodrow’s workload was augmented immensely after the US entrance in World War One in April 1917 Edith offered him even more of her services. Together with his three daughters from his previous marriage, Edith volunteered at a Red Cross canteen and also made public appearances advising women to economize their food purchases to improve the soldiers’ food. She even let a herd of sheep graze at the lawn of the White House and then donated the $50,000 that their wool was sold for to the war effort.\n\nEdith’s ancestry was derived from Pocahontas and her southern heritage was something she liked to boast of. She was also a descendant of Thomas Jefferson and Martha Washington. Edith’s family had even supported the Confederacy during the Civil War, and like many other former slave-owners she claimed that slaves had been content at plantations. Evidently conservative, Edith was no suffragette either. After an arrest, ordered by Woodrow himself, of suffragettes demonstrating outside of the White House Edith even referred to them as “those devils in the workhouse”. That Woodrow himself later supported the suffragette cause, leading to female suffrage in 1920, was because of political reasons and to comply with the people’s wants, not with his wife’s.\n\nEdith followed her beloved Woodrow everywhere, even to Europe, being the first first lady to do so, during the Paris Peace Conferences in December 1918, where she was greeted like a celebrity as she travelled through the continent. One of Wilson’s 14 Points were a creation of the League of Nations, but this idea met much opposition in the Senate. Weary after having been debating with filibusters all year, Wilson still wanted to tour the United States in the autumn of 1919 to gain support for the League of Nations. In September he dramatically fell ill and was ordered by his physicians to return to the White House, where he was afflicted by a severe stroke on his bathroom floor, where Edith found him, on October 2nd. He was partially physically paralyzed and Edith believed his recuperating was dependent on if he could retain the presidency. Telling the public Wilson needed to rest and would continue to work from his bedroom, all information went through Edith during, as she later called it in her autobiography (which historians have debated the historical veracity of), her “stewardship”. She read through all matters for Wilson and then decided what was of sufficient importance to be shown to Wilson. Only his physicians and his closest circle of friends were allowed to see him. Still, it was leaked, and apparent, too, in early 1920 that Wilson wasn’t doing his job and a rumour started about there being an “Assistant President”. However, that was not the service Edith took on, but she rather did what many former first ladies had done, albeit with more persistence. For 17 months Edith continued with her duties. After Woodrow’s second presidential term was completed in March 1921 the couple tranquilly retired to a house on S Street in Washington D.C.\n\nOne of few photos from Woodrow’s period of illness of him and his wife.\n\nOn the 3rd of February 1924 Woodrow died. Edith would go on to live for another 37 years, finally herself perishing by a respiratory infection in on December 21st 1961. This period of time she devoted to ostensibly enhancing Woodrow’s two terms of presidency. His Virginian birthplace and later home in Washington were both turned into shrines for him, and she worked in close cooperation with is biographer, and she neatly preserved any papers by him. Her death took place on Woodrow’s 105th birthday and she had attended President John F. Kennedy’s inauguration 11 months earlier. She was buried in the same grave as her husband in Washington National Cathedral. They are the only presidential couple to be buried in Washington D.C.\n\nEdith and President Kennedy.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Edith-Wilson\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/news/edith-wilson-first-president-biography-facts\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/first-ladies/edith-bolling-galt-wilson/\n\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/first-ladies/edith-wilson\n\nhttps://books.google.se/books?id=JRt6AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=edith+wilson&source=bl&ots=nZ2Ijj-XCT&sig=JeiHjgcO0kXXG1w13abIJwMlDPQ&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiO__GNtY_YAhVhJ5oKHZ2LCkE4ChDoAQhrMA0#v=onepage&q=edith%20wilson&f=false\n\nPerhaps more known for her relationships rather than her own persona, this week’s herstory teaches us about someone intriguing, yet underrated by modern history. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you Alexandra of Hessen, Queen Consort of Russia, the last tsarina.\n\nAlexandra Feodorovna of Hessen – her Russian Orthodox name – née Alix Victoria Helena Louise Beatrice von Hesse-Darmstadt after her mother and maternal aunts, was born on June 6th 1872, in Darmstadt, Germany. She was the fourth daughter and sixth child of Princess Alice of England, thus making her the 23rd grandchild of the prodigious Queen Victoria (https://mhedsson.wordpress.com/2017/08/13/the-almost-dwarf/.), and Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, Louis IV. Alix and her 25 cousins celebrated many holidays together with their “Grandmama” Victoria, who played a paramount role in Alix’s life and education, which was subsequently pursued at Heidelberg University’s philosophy department.\n\nThe Hessian family in 1876.\n\nAlix and her grandmother Victoria.\n\nBeing a merry and dazzling child, Alix was called “Sunny” by her parents. Born in the Darmstadt Palace, the family was not wealthy as might be expected, but the family was still happy. Up until the age of six Alix led a life of love – she was very close to her siblings, in particular her brother Ernie, and these two would remain close for the rest of their lives – but then she unfortunately contracted diphtheria together with most of her family. Tragically both her younger sister Marie and shortly afterwards her mother perished due to the illness in December 1878. Consequently after her daughter’s death, Queen Victoria became more involved in her Romanovian grandchildren and arranged marriages for them. She first recommended Alix marrying her cousin Prince Albert Victor of Wales, but Alexandra courteously declined and instead suggested her second cousin the Tsarevich, tsar-to-be, Nicholas of Russia, even though Alix herself supposedly wasn’t that fond of Russia at the time, and simultaneously the Tsar Alexander III was strongly anti-German. However, Alix actually first declined Nicholas’s first proposal, unwilling to give up her firm Lutheran faith, but after her older sister Elisabeth’s encouragements she finally relented. Nicholas and Alix had first met at Elisabeth’s marriage to Nicholas’s uncle the Grand Duke Sergei when Alix was 12 years old and both immediately became fond of each other. Victoria thought of the match as slightly ominous, but was still proud of her granddaughter for standing up for herself and, because of her fondness of Alix, approved of the marriage. They became engaged at the wedding of Alexandra’s brother Ernie. Tsar Alexander was first unwilling to accept the betrothal, but after falling ill he rejected that adamant behaviour and summoned Alix to his court, formally clad in his uniform. He died on November 1st and the next day Alix converted to the Russian Orthodox faith and received her new name as Grand Duchess Alexandra Feodorovna.\n\n22 years old, on November 26th 1894, Alexandra wed Tsar Nicholas II, even though the marriage was initially planned for the spring. The ceremony took place in the Grand Church of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg with Alexandra wearing a lavish white dress, even though she technically was in mourning for the older tsar, which supposedly was so heavily adorned that she needed help to kneel and stand up. Alexandra’s assertive personality in combination with Nicholas’s more meek one resulted in Alexandra dominating the marriage (this, together with her curt and snobbish demeanour, her German heritage, and because of their subsequent son suffering from haemophilia because of her genetics made her unpopular at court; however, her close friends attributed her aloofness to her shyness, and contrasted to the gregarious and friendly Empress Dowager Maria Fjodorovna Alexandra didn’t appear in an auspicious fashion), that still was a happy one. Alexandra was crowned Tsarina in 1896 in the Kremlin in Moscow next to her already crowned Nicholas. Their first of four daughters, Olga, had been born in November the preceding year.\n\nUnderstandably, Alexandra was renowned for her beauty.\n\nPartly because of her personality and her foreign heritage, being from Russia’s forsworn nemesis, Alexandra did not gain many followers at court. Hence, she occupied a lot of her time with mysticism as solace. By her cousin Duchess Militza she had many “holy men” brought to her – for example a French butcher claiming to be able to make people invisible and later on the notorious Grigorij Rasputin. After Rasputin at a church service had predicted Alexandra bearing the desired son and heir within a year in 1903, resulting in the birth of Prince Alexej in August 1904, Rasputin was brought to her.\n\nRasputin, Alexandra, and her children.\n\nAfter Bloody Sunday in 1905, where the Russian people demonstrated for bread and more democracy after Russia’s loss in the Russo-Japanese War 1904-05, Tsar Nicholas was obliged to establish the Duma, an advisory government, which he, however, dissolved with ease whenever he was encountered by dissent. Still, the Duma diminished Nicholas’s power, and the Tsarina felt it to be her duty to try to fortify Nicholas’s influence again.\n\nThe family.\n\nHaving previously failed at her one duty as queen consort, Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters, but in 1904 the miracle finally happened, and a son, Tsarevich Alexej, was born. (In 1895, 1897, 1899, 1901 they had Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia were born respectively). Evidently Alexandra had been at an immense pressure for this pregnancy to happen as she in 1903 experienced a pseudocyesis, a phantom pregnancy. Luckily for her, she truly became pregnant in 1904 and finally gave birth to a boy, but unfortunately by Alexandra’s grandmother Victoria he had a mutation for haemophilia. His illness in combination with him being the so coveted and desired son and heir led to an overt and effusive care for Alexej. Due to his illness a mere scratch could cause him to bleed to death, so Alexandra’s care is not that wondrous either. Alexandra’s concern for her son in 1905 made her to contact with the “holy man” – he described himself as “a Christ in miniature” – Grigorij Rasputin, a sodden and lascivious womanizer, too, and of poor hygiene (he boasted that once he did not change underwear in 6 months and supposedly reeked like a goat) for him to help her son’s condition. Alexandra regared him as one of God’s saints, representing and revered by the people, which was contrary to the truth. After a severe cut and a severe illness for Alexis Alexandra called for Grigorij to come to their residence in 1908 to help their son. After him stopping the bleeding he remained with the royal entourage thenceforth. Rasputin appeared to be the only one being able to stop Alexej’s cuts, according to modern theories due to his ability to sooth the young boy. Rasputin, not living like a typical “Holy Man”, once said that “without sin there is no repentance.”\n\nAlexandra and Alexej.\n\nAlexandra and her daughter Anastasia.\n\nAs both Alexandra and Nicholas weren’t too fond of St. Petersburg, where the Anichkov Palace was located, because of its modernity they instead moved their residence to the isolated Alexander Palace in Tsarkoe Selo in 1995.\n\nAlexandra and her daughters.\n\nOn August 23rd 1915 Tsar Nicholas II moved himself out to the Eastern Front to enhance the soldiers’ morale and fighting spirit and took personal control over the armies, following both Alexandra’s and Rasputin’s advice but going against everyone else’s, and dismissed the Grand Duke Nikolai from his position. In spite of Nicholas’s effort nothing could save the Russians from defeat, in particular not during the tough winter raging in 1916. In the meanwhile, Alexandra was left to rule the country’s domestic policies. Under the influence of Rasputin as her personal adviser many adept ministers were dismissed, only to be replaced by Rasputin’s favourites. Every man giving just a slight impression of disloyalty to the Tsar was dismissed by Alexandra. The following government did not run the country well and planted mistrust and mischief amongst the people. Remarkably, a it was a popular belief that Alexandra, the Russian tsarina, was a German agent. It was commonly held among the public that Rasputin and Alexandra together made out a pro-German group at court wanting to sign a separate peace treaty with Germany to maintain the autocracy of Russia, of which Alexandra was a firm supporter. These rumours were affected by Rasputin’s boasting that he and Alexandra slept together – something highly improbable judging from Alexandra’s high profile and Rasputin’s lack of one. Because of Rasputin’s corrupting the country Nicholas’s niece’s husband Felix Yusupov, the Duma-member Vladimir Purishkevich, and others invited him to dinner on December 16th 1916. Having allured him with the promise of letting him sleep wait for Princess Irina, who in fact was in Crimea, they offered him cyanide-poisoned wine and cake. Without effect, Rasputin was shot and dropped through a hole into a frozen canal running outside the Palace. It was said that the man firing the bullet was a British agent Oswald Rayner, who was seen in Princess Irina’s palace within 24 hours afterwards. The Yusupovs, involved in the plot, were sent to the family’s secluded estates as punishment, but not a particularly stringent one because of the Yusupovs’ power.\n\nOverconfident and disregarding all the warning signs for her downfall, like Rasputin’s murder in 1916, Alexandra continued her way of living and ruling. The greatest warning sign of all was the February Revolution in 1917, in which the monarchy and government was lapsed and replaced by a provisional government comprising the Duma led under Alexander Karensky. Tsar Nicholas officially renounced the throne on July 15th 1917 after the Russian Army High Command had recommended his abdication two days earlier. The Romanov family was put in house arrest in the Alexander Palace and later on in Tobolsk. The British official David Lloyd George offered the Romanovs refuge in England after Nicholas’s abdication, but King George V, worrying for his own power, withdrew the offer. After the October Revolution, however, the Romanovs not in the Tsar-family, not yet arrested, succeeded to flee to England. After the October Revolution Alexandra and her family were moved to the remote Ipatiev House in Yekaterineburg, Siberia. There both Alexandra and her fragile son Alexis fell ill due to the comparatively meagre conditions. Alexandra was even bound to a wheelchair for most of their stay there.\n\nOn the morning of the 17th of July – although some sources indicate that it was on July 16th – 1918 Alexandra along with her husband and children were executed in Ipatiev House’s basement by a firing squad. According to rumours Alexandra and her daughters all wore necklaces with pictures of Rasputin in them. The dead bodies were first dumped down a mine, but then fetched and burned. When a mass grave in Yekaterinburg was discovered in 1978 it was DNA-tested and in 1998 it was declared that the skeletons did belong to Nicholas, Alexandra, and three of their daughters. On July 17th 1998 they were buried next to the preceding Romanovs in St. Catherine’s Chapel in St. Petersburg, receiving burials worthy of their names. In year 2000 Alexandra and Nicholas II were canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. In 2007 the two last children of the Romanov family were found, and their identities were confirmed in 2008 and they were buried that year next to their family.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexandra-empress-consort-of-Russia\n\nhttp://spartacus-educational.com/RUSalexandra.htm\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2553577/The-sexual-obsession-drove-Rasputin-death-Countless-myths-woven-But-dazzling-book-using-private-diaries-reveals-new-details-self-styled-Christ-miniature.html\n\nhttp://time.com/4606775/5-myths-rasputin/\n\nhttp://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/alexandra.htm\n\nhttp://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/the-stories-of-queen-victorias-granddaughters-princess-alix-of-hesse-the-last-tsarina-52731\n\nhttp://www.unofficialroyalty.com/princess-alix-of-hesse-and-by-rhine-empress-alexandra-feodorovna-of-russia/\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11887138/Russia-exhumes-remains-of-last-emperor-Nicholas-II-and-empress-Alexandra.html\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/people/alexandra-feodorovna-37295\n\nMata Hari, neé Margareta Geertruida Zelle, was one remarkable and enigmatic woman. However, if it hadn’t been for her conspicuous and unfortunate fate, there plausibly hadn’t been that many movies and documentaries made about her and her name would have vanished in oblivion.\n\nBorn on the 7th of August in 1876 in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands, as Margareta Geertruida Zelle as the daughter of the hat-shop owner Adam Zelle, whom was been attributed the august nickname the Baron. A rather wealthy hat-shop owner, the Baron Adam encouraged his daughter Margareta to exhibit the same effusive characters as himself, which she certainly did. Being her father’s most beloved child, she had a taste that was utilized through his wealth. However, when the Baron lost his money due to his exorbitant lifestyle and poor investments he divorced his wife Anthe and abandoned the family. Antje died shortly afterwards in 1891. Margareta’s, 13 years old at the time, embellished lifestyle abruptly ended. She was nothing but obliged to stay with relatives, being separated from her 3 brothers, and commenced her studies at a teacher-programme three years later. Margareta’s misfortune persisted and after the emergance of rumours of a potential affair between her and the 51-year-old headmaster she was coerced to quit her studies and leave the facilities. The headmaster retained his position.\n\nMargareta with her first and only husband.\n\nIn an immense need of money, moreover with an exorbitant lifestyle, Margareta spotted an ad in the local newspapers. The 20-year-older soldier Rudolf MacLeod stationed in the Dutch East Indies, present-day Indonesia, was looking for a wife. Due to his syphilis, unbeknownst to Margareta, he avoided the military regulations preventing him from marrying at Java, which was required for him to advance in the military ranks, and instead covertly searched for a wife in the Dutch newspapers. Margareta was quick to respond because of her meagre position. They met at Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum in 1895 and after a mere 6 days they were engaged. As Rudolf was a soldier he was soon to return to Dutch East Indian island of Java and his newly acquired wife accompanied him there, with a babe at her arm when they disembarked on the island in 1897. A habitual alcoholic sexist, not that rare at the time, Rudolf found Margareta’s flamboyant and gregarious way of living excruciating. He was a loving father to their son Norman-John and Jeanne “Nom” Louise, born in 1898, but Margareta he ferociously abused. In one letter she wrote that Rudolf “came close to murdering [her] with the bread knife. [She owed her] life to a chair that fell over and which gave [her] time to find the door and get help.” What further demolished the marriage was Rudolf’s re-stationing to the less picturesque island of Sumatra, leaving Margareta quite discontent. When their beloved son Norman died in 1899 they travelled back to the Netherlands. Rudolf’s jealous mistress and housekeeper had allegedly tried to poison the two children, leaving them both indomitably vomiting, but luckily with Nom surviving. Back home in 1902 they were finally divorced due to the incessant abuse and Margareta obtained full custody over Nom. However, after some impunity of her sister-in-law – no other relative dared to help poor Margareta and her daughter after the threats from Rudolf – Nom was taken care of by Rudolf as he refused to pay the promised allowance to Margareta. Her daughter would always remain in her heart, but she wanted Nom to have a life she herself couldn’t provide at the time. Rudolf’s syphilis probably contributed to the death of Norman and Nom’s fatal brain haemmorage in 1919. Margareta had to eat toxic mercury pills for the rest of her life as a “cure.”\n\nRudolf MacLeod and little Norman.\n\nRudolf and Nom.\n\nBeing penniless and unemployed, Margareta moved to Paris, the place filled with all of the grandeur she had always dreamt of. She first started working as a model for a painter, then as an equestrian at a circus. Heeding Margareta’s discontent with her various vocations, a friend of hers whom was aware of the American stripteasing dancer Isadora Duncan and many others advised Margareta to jump on the new trend of dancing. She had her first show in February 1905 under the name of Lady MacLeod. The fine Emile Guimet had her perform at his Musée Guimet before an august audience, who all became enraptured by the exotic and sensual dancer.\n\nAs an exotic dancer, she caught everyone’s, in particular most men’s, interest. She concocted orientally themed dance shows, having been inspired by their previously Javanese servants, she claimed to be a Javanesian princess, or possibly the child of an Indian priest, or the daughter to a Javanese temple dancer or to European parents situated in Java. To journalists her stories differed. The scheme of Margareta’s exotic “ancestry” and culture worked, primarily because of her appearance which differed slightly from other Dutch people. Her “Javanese” dance was traditional, she claimed, and her audience therefore justified her promiscuous shows by them being culturally educating. Almost immediately gaining the public’s interest, Mata danced exotically and slowly stripped her clothes off, ending up with nothing more than a breast plate and a veil.\n\nMargareta’s first alias Lady MacLeod, as she claimed to be the daughter of a Lord, ended in 1912 as Rudolf MacLeod sued her and all these names thus vanished abruptly from all posters. Thenceforth she would be called Mata Hari, which translates to the Eye of the Day in Javanese, and Sun if written Matahari, which was common, too. Her name has similar meaning in other related languages, such as Malay.\n\nMata Hari was not only a habitual letter-writer but also made her own scrapbook that today is on display at the Frisian Museum in her hometown.\n\nA famous dancer in the Netherlands, Mata Hari’s most popular performances were made 1905-06, and thenceforth she made more arbitrary shows with an increasingly lower pay as she was out-competed by the younger girls. During the height of her career Mata travelled to Monte Carlo, Milan, Vienna, Berlin, and many more grand cities. However, during her most actie years she swiftly acquired s considerable wealth and quickly immersed herself into the luxuries she had always dreamt of. Daily she could be seen going horseback-riding in the Boulogne forest. Most plausibly Margareta, or Mata, had taught herself how to dance, and her shows didn’t really appear to be much connected to the Oriental world. By claiming to be Javanese stripteasing became acceptable, even after her time, as it was believed to be a part of that culture, and her aristocratic attendees were often engrossed with this foreign culture. Sporadically she occupied herself with prostitution, being a highly coveted mistress amongst the elite (one lover even purchased a castle for her!), but with her customers she was scrupulous with whom she chose. Margareta had a thing for uniforms and she “would rather be the mistress of a poor officer than of a rich banker” (still the German crown prince has a lover of hers). She was a grand celebrity. Thus, her many lovers supported her financially after her shows stopped contributing that much to her own economy. Her living standards shifted, sometimes staying at more lowly hotels, whereas other timesl remaining at the most expensive ones in Paris.\n\nA Russian WWI soldier whom Mata fell in live with.\n\nAs Mata Hari’s popularity was diminishing at the time of World War One she gave up her career and moved to Berlin where she acquired a role in the Metropolitan opera. When the Great War erupted she was treated in an unfavourable manner and when trying to fetch her expensive fur coats stored at the German costume storage she was told that they had been confiscated, supposedly to a value worth 80 000 Franc, as had a lot of her property due to her being a foreigner in Berlin.\n\nOne of Mata Hari’s lover was the chief of France’s contraespionage during World War One, Captain Ladoux, told to his confidante that the British believed her to be a German spy. Knowing this information to be fallible, Ladoux requested Mata to spy for them instead. Her leading a lifestyle of grandeur, she agreed to his offer, if she obtained one million Franc in return and executed an imperative mission. This was in August 1916, with the Great War still raging.\n\nMata Hari’s tremendous mission was, however, not realized as she was arrested in London by British officers, led by Scotland Yard, mistaking her for the German spy Clara Bendix. Obviously innocent, Hari was instead sent to Madrid for other missions in December that year. For those two weeks the main activities of Mata’s career with espionage took place.\n\nIn Madrid, firstly Hari made contact with the German embassy, trying to gain their trust and become a spy for them, thus establishing herself as a double agent.\n\nFunnily enough, the actual reason why Mata Hari is such a uniquitous name is quite contradictory. She was a spy, yes, but for two weeks and a rather blithe one in addition to that. For example, her missions she explicitly told about in phone calls and in letters, not considering that they might be interjected and bugged, and invisible ink wasn’t anything she was particularly interested in either. She went straight to Ladoux’s office, sent him regulat letter, and telephoned him as if the calls were just everyday chats. Not fathoming her naivety, Mata Hari travelled back to Paris after these two weeks in Madrid, andthere the British were waiting for her. They had snapped up messages in Paris from Madrid, and following the provided cues it was almost palpable that the spy sending them were agent H 21, Mata Hari, from the Germans (i.e. her double agency), and the Englishmen’s first peculiar suspicions were thus “confirmed” that Mata Hari in fact was a German spy. They claimed her to have provided the Germans with imperative information about tanks, leading to thousands of causalities. The German messages snapped up were coded, BUT in a code the Germans knew the Entente had already deciphered and they hence planted fallacious information amongst their enemies. As the German officer providing Mata Hari with her information was quite aware of her position – it was’t that difficult to conclude from her amateur mistakes – he in a sense made her get caught. The French were unaware of the German schemes, too, so during Hari’s subsequent trials this wasn’t clarified. Still, Hari herself was unaware of this and returned to Paris with pride.\n\nIn February 1917 Mata Hari was arrested by the French authorities. What consolidated their verdicts, based upon dubious and scarce evidence, was that she had indeed accepted money from the Germans in May 1916 for spy duties. According to her chronology, it was to deceive them and to get money, the bountiful sum of 20 000 Franc, in advance in return for a few coats they had deprived her of earlier, whereas according to the so resolute offender Hari had alteady performed the requested service when she received the money. Judging from her lacking aptitude in Madrid, Hari’s version is the more plausible one considering many facotrs, including that the Germans were so willing to have her arrested (instead of continuing with the actually lucrative business of feeding her, and thus their enemies, with false information). The prosecutor of Hari’s case was Pierre Bouchardon and most of his evidences were simply the suspect’s personality: flamboyant, unreliable, and promiscuous. To him on the 5th of June 1917 she wrote that “Mata Hari and Madame Zelle MacLeod are two completely different women … Today with the war, the passport, I am obliged to live and sign Zelle, but that woman is not known to people. As for me, I consider myself to be Mata Hari.” In that very letter she also wrote that “I have never committed an act of espionage against France. Never. Never.” On her own side of the investigation she had an elderly old friend as a lawyer. In July a jury comprising seven military tribunes senteced her to death over a 2-day trial. Hari appealed for impunty twice, both times rejected. During this short trial Hari was locked in at the Conciergerie prison, where another interesting woman stayed, namely Marie Antoinette.\n\nMata Hari’s mugshot.\n\nOn the 15th of October 1917 Mata Hari was shot dead by 12 French soldiers for treachery. She was awaken hastily in her cell in Saint Lazare Prison in Paris in the morning hours and was then allowed to write two hasted letters. Two priests and a nun were also brought to her. Posed against an oak tree in the Vincenne forest in eastern France, the guns and the pejorative glowers were spiked against her. The 41-year-old Mata Hari wore a black velvet cloak with fur, black stockings, and high heels. According to the probably spiced story, she blew the 12 French soldiers a kiss before they fired their guns at her. 125 more alleged spies were executed in France for espionage during the Great War. Due to her enigmatic and exotic story – a lascivious and promiscuous dancer becoming a spy – over 250 biographies have been written about her, and in 1931 the prodigious Greta Garbo (whom would be a subject for a herstory, too) played her in a movie.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20171020-who-was-the-real-mata-hari\n\nhttps://www.svd.se/mata-hari-fran-hela-europas-alskling-till-avrattad-spion\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/15/i-am-ready-mata-hari-faced-a-firing-squad-for-spying-and-refused-a-blindfold/\n\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2017/11-12/mata-hari-history-killing/\n\nhttp://m.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2114764/exotic-dancer-prostitute-second-rate-spy-mata?amp=1\n\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/gallery/rare-pictures-exotic-dancer-spy-11356154\n\nhttps://amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/05/the-real-mata-hari-executed-abused-woman\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/.amp/people/mata-hari-9402348\n\nhttp://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mata-hari-executed\n\nhttp://amp.thedailybeast.com/100-years-since-her-execution-was-mata-hari-a-sexy-spy-or-a-sexy-scapegoat\n\nhttp://www.faktoider.nu/matahari.html\n\nAhhh, my Elizabeth, here she finally comes. Enjoy Gloriana’s/the Virgin Queen’s/the Faery Queen. However, as I am very busy in school right now with testweek this herstory is not as extensive as it ought to be for someone to whom there is so much information about. I could not fit it all and, as I said, I’m very busy. If you want to know more about this remarkable woman all you have to do is use Google (or, even better, borrow a book from a public library – read three books about a subject, perhaps about Elizabeth, and you can colloquially call yourself an expert, because three books on this topics is most likely much more than anyone else around you knows about it!). Once again, not as extensive as it ought to be, but hopefully sufficient, and if you want more trivia then you should read a book.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I was born on the 7th of September 1533 to King Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn (whom I’ve already written a herstory about). This loved, albeit unwanted daughter of the King reigned as queen of England from 1558 to her death on the 24th of March 1603 and is one of the most renowned monarchs in history.\n\nDuring the greater part or European and global history, women have been seen as inferior to men, and still are to a certain extent. Therefore, Elizabeth I and her accomplishments were seen as an exception, not the rule, by the general mass. She had a female, fallible body and she herself was hence also fallible, partly as consequence of Europe being Christian and Eve, not Adam, bringing damnation upon humankind (Eve actually means “snake” in some Semitic languages). Elizabeth – who was third in the order of succession after her sickly younger brother Edward VI and her older sister who previously, just like Elizabeth, was declared bastard – was a strong-willed person, which will be discussed in a subsequent paragraph, and quite soon into her reign she announced that she was more than a ruler in name only, which not was expected because she, after all, was a woman. To still be able to rule with her “weak, female mind” she declared in several speeches, the first one in 1559 to the Parliament, that she had a separate political body, as well as a female one that would not interfere with political and royal concerns.\n\nAs any other sovereign in history, Elizabeth I had several advisors. The Privy Council was the British ruler’s main councillors and, of course, they were mostly comprised of the heads of the greatest houses in England, because if these were not represented in governing the country they might riot against the Queen. However, Elizabeth herself had the power to choose the members of the Privy Council, which she, in practise, had to elect in accordance with the men’s titles to avoid offending any of them, but she still removed some Catholic dissidents when she ascended the throne. With a diverse group of councillors, as they consisted of nobles all wanting the best for themselves, their final suggestions for her were, almost as a rule, ambivalent and she could thus easier take a stand against them without insulting the losing side too much, because it would have been outrageous if a woman, regardless of her title, would defy the great majority of the wiser men. The two most prominent men in the Privy Council were Sir William Cecil (whom Elizabeth called her “Spirit”) and Sir Francis Walsingham, both famously loyal to her and the Protestant Church. Walsingham is renowned for his intricate spy network, providing Elizabeth and Cecil with imperative information about foreign and national businesses before they made up their minds. Cecil was Elizabeth’s chief secretary and advisor ever since her coronation, making many final decisions for or together with her. Elizabeth also had the House of Lords and the House of Commons, the Parliament, which she however summoned very arbitrarily and then almost exclusively to plead for money, at least initially.\n\nYoung Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth is renowned for having been a wise ruler. She received a rearing worthy of a prince, mainly done by Katherine “Kat” Ashley, whom Elizabeth had a very affectionate and motherly relationship with since the beheading of her real mother Anne Boleyn in 1536. Elizabeth would revere her mother long afterwards and in a painting in her adolescence she wore a necklace from her mother. Elizabeth never grudged her father for killing her mother. As you hopefully have read in my text about Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth was treated amiably by her parents, when they saw her, but, of course, she was not raised by them. Also, after Anne’s execution Elizabeth would be severely neglected by her father. Her governess sent letters to King Henry VIII writing how Elizabeth had out-grown her clothes since long and pleaded for the King to send some more.\n\nElizabeh’s education was eminent, making her fluent in seven languages, like English, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, and Welsh, in addition to other ones which she did not master as well. She could also play many instruments, such as the lute, and was very fond of art and dancing. She received this excellent schooling, contributing to her sage reign, despite that she was declared a bastard in 1536 after Anne Boleyn’s death on May 21st 1536 and King Henry VIII’s expectations on his new wife Jane Seymour to birth a male heir. Elizabeth was reinstated in the order of succession after the Third Succession Act of 1543, but was removed again in 1549 during her younger brother Edward VI’s reign when he made his advisor’s daughter-in-law Jane Grey heir. The eldest Tudor child, Mary I, made a coup d’état and took over the throne after only nine days of Grey’s ruling in 1553. Elizabeth again became the heir after her half-sister “Bloody Mary’s” potential child, despite her being imprisoned in the Tower for her Protestant faith by her sister from March-May 1554. (“Bloody Mary” had 287 Protestants burnt at stake during her reign from 1553-1558, whereas Elizabeth gruesomeily had about 200 Catholics hanged, removed their entrails, and then beheaded – she had to be a fearsome Protestant because her right to reign depended on it; on February 25th, for example, Elizabeth was excommuted by Pope Pius V).\n\nElizabeth is infamous for her dominant and sometimes aggressive behaviour. She broke her court lady Mary Scudamore’s finger after she had married without Elizabeth’s permission. Moreover, Elizabeth demanded absolute presence from her court ladies, with exceptions for grave illnesses and they had to spend as much time during and after a pregnancy as possible at her side. She was at other times very amiable and watched over her favourites’ beds during times of sickness and sorrow.\n\nThe only wife that King Henry VIII did not rid himself of, Catherine Parr, took Elizabeth under her wing after Henry’s death in 1547. Parr’s new husband Thomas Seymour who earlier had been an ardent proposer of Elizabeth is notorious for having molested her. Rumours even spread about him making her pregnant, which tried to be covered up by the court.\n\nElizabeth loved sugar and even sprinkled it over her salads. This unhealthy habit, however, made her teeth repugnant and she had a few of them pulled out. The first time it was because she was so terribly afflicted by toothache, but still feared the pain of the procedure. To encourage the Queen, a man in her service volontarily had one of his teeth pulled out, just to show the harmlessness of it. During public appearances she would stuff her mouth with cloth and she avoided smiling as often as possible.\n\nElizabeth I was a well-known Protestant, but she still could not be considered to be the Supreme Governor of the Church, which the English sovereign was supposed to be instead of the Pope in accordance with her father’s Act of Supremacy from 1534. Through the Act of Supremacy of 1559 Elizabeth “merely” became the Head of the Church. Women at that time were not allowed to speak in a Church, only to be meek and modest and stay out of religious issues, and therefore it would have been absurd if the Church’s sovereign was to be a woman.\n\nDespite being of the weaker gender, Elizabeth, shrewd as she was, made it to and advantage of hers. With England being one of few Protestant countries in Europe – Sweden, Denmark, North German and principalities, and Scotland in the 1560s – Elizabeth I was thought of as a royal bastard of the vast majority of the European royalty as, according to them, Henry VIII’s first marriage to Catherine of Aragon was never annulled. Still, a lot of these Catholic princes and kings were ardent proposers to Elizabeth, even though England at this time was a rather meagre country with a feeble army and navy and a poor treasury, but being in an alliance with England would still outweigh the disadvantages. King Philip II of Spain, for example, thought of it as his duty to liberate England from their heresy, Protestantism. It would also be in Spain’s favour to be in a marriage alliance with England due to the then existing menace posed by France, and it would be immensely unfortunate for him if Elizabeth instead chose to marry the king of France, which actually almost happened twice with Duke Francois of Anjou (whom she called her “Frog” as he had once given her earrings with frogs on them), but the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew’s Day in 1572 averted Elizabeth the first time and the second time she was truly considering it, but in the end thought of herself too old as she was 23 years old than Francis. Elizabeth would sometimes make it appear as she was interested in marrying, at times having marriage negotiations going on for a year, but always found some flaw and cancelled it in the “last minute”. However, she did at other times promise to marry when she would find a pertinent man, although she at other occasions explicitly said that she did not intend to marry unless God would change her will, thereby also justifying her virginity as if it was one of God’s choices. By refusing to marry Elizabeth created a cult around herself, renowned around Europe as the Virgin Queen or Gloriana, the Fairy Queen. She glorified the fact that she was a virgin and made it into one of her attributes.\n\nDue to Elizabeth’s close relationship to Sir Robert Dudley (Elizabeth’s “Eyes”), and later other men, like the pirate Sir Walter Raleigh, she was around the country and the continent accused for having been “improper” with this man and even having married him. This scandalous saying was consolidated by that her mother Anne Boleyn was the “Great Whore”. This rumour was outrageous in Elizabeth’s, and her councillors’ and her peoples’, opinion, simply because of how unacceptable it would have been for in particular an unmarried queen to have done so. As Elizabeth grew older and her cohort more impatient even Robert Dudley, whom Elizabeth appointed to become the fine Lord of Leicester, would suffice as King, as long as she married. Moreover, it was during the 16th century believed that women had a biological need for sex and that their health would be unstable by remaining a virgin. Thus, the obsession with Elizabeth’s well-being increased even further with her not having sex, in addition to her heirless state, not ensuring the survival of the dynasty. Also, it was believed to have been a correlation, she both explicitly and implicitly expressed it in several speeches, between Elizabeth’s chastity and strong, untouched body and England’s strong, untouched, by enemies, land. Elizabeth tried to establish this belief during all of her reign, but it became commonly accepted when she reached the age around fifty. She was quite concerned with her health and took walks almost daily and also visited every great city in England during the twenty first summers of her reign. That her health also was quite tenuous in reality, not just as any woman’s was expected to be, made it more imperative for her to get married and reduce this virgin illness of hers – she was for example afflicted by smallpox in 1562 and endured regular migraines and fevers. Her make-up, with detrimental toxins like lead and mercury, used excessively in particular after having reached menopause, contributed to her poor health. During Elizabeth’s last years 2 hours were required in the morning to apply make-up to the Queen and dress her. Elizabeth used an abundance of make-up to consolidate the cult around her virginity, with very white skin, symbolising innocence, and red cheeks and lips to amplify her and her country’s health. To show her grandeur as queen he court-ladies were obliged to only wear black or white, as if to not outshine the Queen. At least 2000 gloves it is believed that she had (however, when possible Elizabeth wore simple dress, sometimes for a couple of days straight). Moreover, according to diplomatic visits at Elizabeth she was insecure and constantly demanded compliments. People saw an actual correlation between her virginity, her female gender, and her unpredictable health. Elizabeth, however, tried to make her virginity associated with strength and protection of God instead. A common illness by the people was believed to only be cured by a monarch’s touch and Elizabeth was usually more than happy to help her poor subjects.\n\nElizabeth never had children, although there have been some rumours opposing that idea, and she was succeeded by the only son of her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, whom Elizabeth reluctantly beheaded for treason and killing her violent second husband. She supposedly only signed her death sentence due to the Parliament’s and Privy Council’s urging, as she made out a perilous threat to the English throne, but she had planned to make the verdict void and prevent the execution. Elizabeth’s, and her cousin Mary’s, heir, declared in March 1603 (although, Cecil had a correspondance with him from early 1601), took the name James I as the king of Britain and Scotland when he was made King on March 24th 1603. His first years of reigning were turbulent as he opposed the Parliament and had difficulties relating to his people, along with a very pompous spending, which on the other hand Elizabeth also had and the royal treasury was, however, almost empty when James came to power.\n\nElizabeth I is known to the modern great mass for having defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588. Anything related to the military was a man’s business. The English victory was not exclusively due to swift English ships, but also because of storms and heavy winds, shattering the Spanish fleets. Moreover, the initial eminent commander of the Spanish fleet died a few weeks before the attack was launched and his replacement was a seasick man with insufficient knowledge about naval warfare. The final stage for the Catholic Spain attacking England was due to the execution of the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots in 1587 after several plots to remove her cousin Elizabeth from the throne. In that sense, Elizabeth elicited a Spanish invasion. Just before the attack she held a famous speech for the troops at Tilbury, England, where she had appointed her previously – he had married one of her court ladies without her consent – very dear Sir Robert Dudley to command. There, Elizabeth gave a speech to rally the troops and made a correlation between how she had been “unpenetrated” and how her country would remain that way as well. She was soon transported to safety, pertinently for a woman, in contrast to her male ancestors who all lead troops with or without success. Elizabeth funded, through the royal treasury, preparations before the Invasion thanks to the information regarding it from Sir Walsingham’s spy network. In 1587 Elizabeth sent Sir Francis Drake to the Spanish harbour in Cadiz to loot and demolish as many ships as possible. This act postponed the Spanish Invasion until July 1588, thus buying some time for the English to prepare. Elizabeth was also involved in the Dutch Revolt, which begun in 1568. After the assassination in of the Dutch revolutionary leader William I of Orange, Robert Dudley with troops was sent over to the Netherlands, albeit with little success. The British started sending more troops over there after the Treaty of Nonsuch of 1585. Before that they merely aided the Protestant Dutch with money and land for stationing.\n\nPainted after the victory against the Armada, note her hand on the globe, symbolizing her control of the world with her hand on America, and in the background the actual Armada.\n\nElizabeth’s tenacity became evident around her death. She refused to bathe for three weeks and did her best to not fall asleep either, as if fearing that her perishing was imminent.\n\nSources:\n\nBritannica: Elizabeth I; Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester; Mary I; Protestantism; William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley; Sir Francis Walsingham; Armada; James I, Edward VI, last read 12th of May 2017\n\nHarrison, Dick, Elisabet I, Nationalencyklopedin, last read 15th of May 2017\n\nHarrison, Dick, Maria Stuart, Nationalencyklopedin, last read 15th of May 2017\n\nHarrison, Dick, Elisabet I – Gift med England, Populär historia, 6th of August 2002, last read 13th of May 2017\n\nWarnicke, Retha, Elizabeth I: Gender, Religion and Politics, History Review, 2007, last read 13th of May 2017\n\nWhitelock, Anna, Elisabet I- Historien om drottningen och hennes förtrogna, Erik Nisser, Historiska media, 2014\n\nCoombs, Katherine, Portrait Miniature of Elizabeth I, BBC history, 17th of February 2011, last read 14th of May 2017\n\nThe British Royal Household, Elizabeth I (r. 1558-1603), The Royal Encyclopaedia, last read 13th of May 2017\n\nAndrews, Evan, 8 Things You May Not Know about the Spanish Armada, History Channel, 14th of December 2014, last read 13th of May 2017\n\nhttps://www.biography.com/people/queen-elizabeth-i-9286133\n\nhttp://www.historyextra.com/article/facts-elizabethi\n\nHistory Extra Podcast; Terror in Elizabethan England with historian Jessie Childs; Queen Victoria’s Dinners and Henry VIII’s niece with historians Annie Gray and Morgan Ring; Elizabeth I and an Unlikely Suffragette with historian Lisa Hilton; Tudor Monarch’s and a Medieval Civil War with historian Tracy Borman (I highly recommend this history podcast for anyone interested!)\n\nPerhaps you know this already, but the Duchess of Aquitaine, Countess of Poitiers, and Queen Consort of France (r. 1137-1152) and England (r. 1154-1204), is often referred to as the Grandmother of Europe due to her eight surviving children’s connections to various royal houses in Europe, and being the mother to 5 monarchs. Any guesses whom this woman may be? Could it possibly be Eleanor of Aquitaine? Yes, it could.\n\nEleanor was born in 1122, where and when more specifically remain unknown to this day; a daughter was not expected to be of that great of an importance that her birth date and placed needed to be recorded. Her father was the tenth duke of Aquitaine, named Guillame (or William, if you want to be more modern), and her mother was Eleanor of Châtelleraut. Peculiarly, Mother Eleanor and and Guillame’s parents were lovers and these two therefore resolved to wed their children. By her parents, or more pertinently arranged by them, young Eleanor was extensively educated, and reared in a court with superfluous culture. Even her grandfather William of Aquitaine was renowned for the arts and culture and the amount of troubadours he held at his court, and his promiscuity.\n\nYoung Eleanor was renowned for her dazzling vivacity and energy. She was raised together with two siblings, one younger sister called Petronilla and a brother named Guillame, who tragically perished briefly after his mother in 1130, making Eleanor presumptive heir until further notice. The father was foraging for a new wife, able to carry a male heir, when he, too, died in 1137. This left Eleanor as the sole heir, in her own right, to the powerful and vast Aquitaine, even more extensive and wealthy than the lands held by the French Crown, in April 1137. This engendered her a very coveted bride, and her new guardian King Louis VI of France betrothed her to his own son and heir Louis hours after her father’s passing. King Louis VI sent for Eleanor, to bring her the jolly news of her new match, through a calvary of 500 men that very day.\n\nAquitaine in 1030 in contrast to thr French lands to the right of it.\n\nIn July that year, in 1137, Eleanor and Louis were married, her at the age of 15 and him 17. About a month passed of the “getting-to-know-your-spouse” phase before King Louis VII became ill and died, and Eleanor had to inhabit the Cité Palace de Paris, a quite draughty and averting palace to live in. On Christmas Day 1137 Louis was crowned King Louis VII of France and Eleanor his Queen.\n\nEleanor was to have been the first one who introduced built-in fireplaces after the palace in Paris was renovated for her and Louis, due to the astonishment and contrasts from southern to northern France, and her innovation spread like wildfire.\n\nEleanor was to have been the first one who introduced built-in fireplaces after the palace in Paris was renovated for her and Louis, due to the astonishment and contrasts from southern to northern France, and her innovation spread like wildfire.\n\nThe initial years of ruling comprised several struggles for the inexperienced couple, most notably with the Pope and the influential Count Theobald of Champagne. Many of these were due to Louis’s youth and inexperience, and astonishing choleric eruptions of the otherwise meek man. The “conflict” between Theobald and the Crown reached its climax at the massacre of hundreds of people in Vitry when Louis’s troops scorched a church in which the locals sought refuge during a siege. A remorseful Louis was eager to compensate for his faults and quickly took up arms when the Pope called for a second crusade in 1145. Louis was more of a follower than a leader – Eleanor exclaimed that she had married a monk rather than a man – and he cherished the enthrallingly beautiful, and conspicuously mercurial, Eleanor highly, often letting her direct him in his political choices. The love wasn’t overly reciprocated. On the journey, which set out in 1147, to the Holy Land in the West the adventurous and ardent Eleanor accompanied her husband and his troops, together with her own entourage, of course. Due to the lack of success of this Second Crusade Eleanor and Louis became more and more alienated from each other, in particular during their stay at Eleanor’s uncle Raymond de Poitiers’s manor rumours circulated that Eleanor and her uncle had an affair, which elicited Louis’s jealousy. Louis and Raymond did have contrary ideas of how to conduct the crusade, too, and both Eleanor and Raymond spoke the southern French Occitan, whereas Louis spoke the northern French language (of course Eleanor typically communicated with her husband in proper French). Moreover, the couple were notoriously struggling with becoming with child – Eleanor carried a daughter Countess Mary of Champagne in 1145 and then Countess Alix of Blois in 1151 – it was evident to them that the marriage wasn’t a good match.\n\nRaymond welcoming King Louis in Antioch.\n\nEleanor sought for the Pope to annul their marriage because of consanguinity and them being related, and her wish was finally approved in March 1152. Eleanor’s two daughters remained in custody of the King.\n\nTwo months passed before Eleanor married the 11 years younger Henry Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy. According to rumours Eleanor had conducted a love affair with Henry’s father before the marriage, and was technically more related to Henry than Louis, but the wedding still took place in Poitiers on May 18th. In two years time, in October 1154, the English King Stephen would perish and leave Henry as the new King of England (Henry, with his mother being Queen Matilda of England and a descendant of William the Conqueror, invaded the Isles in 1153 with the powerful Aquitaine’s wealth with him, and Stephen"
