        "text": "When presented with a new multivolume series on the history of chemistry, one cannot help but compare it to J. R. Partington&#39;s masterful four-volume A History of Chemistry. The new six-volume A Cultural History of Chemistry reviewed here, however, is really a different beast and should not be viewed as a simple attempt to update Partington&#39;s previous series. As highlighted by series editors Peter Morris and Alan Rocke in the Series Preface that begins each volume, &quot;This is not a conventional history of chemistry, but a first attempt at creating a cultural history of the science.&quot; As such, this series brings together 50 contributors in an effort to present the first detailed and authoritative survey of the impact of chemistry on society, as well as how society has influenced and impacted chemical practice and thought. Spanning from the earliest applications of the chemical arts in antiquity up through the present, this cultural history is split into six volumes, eac...\n\nA Cultural History of Chemistry in the Eighteenth Century covers the period from 1700 to 1815. Setting the history of science and technology in its cultural context, the volume questions the myth of a chemical revolution. Already boasting a laboratory culture open to both manufacturing and commerce, the discipline of chemistry now extended into academies and universities. Chemists studied myriad materials - derived from minerals, plants, and animals - and produced an increasing number of chemical substances such as acids, alkalis, and gases. New textbooks offered opportunities for classifying substances, rethinking old theories and elaborating new ones. By the end of the period â€“ in Europe and across the globe - chemistry now embodied the promise of unifying practice and theory."
