        "text": "Introduction to Japanese R&B: Definition and History\n\nJapanese R&B, often referred to as J-R&B, is a genre of music that combines elements of rhythm and blues with Japanese pop culture and music styles. The genre began to take shape in the 1990s, influenced by the global success of American R&B artists and the rise of hip-hop culture. Early pioneers of Japanese R&B include artists like Toshinobu Kubota, who infused traditional R&B sounds with Japanese lyrics and themes. Over the years, Japanese R&B has evolved, incorporating various elements from other genres such as jazz, funk, and electronic music, creating a unique and diverse sound that continues to grow in popularity both in Japan and internationally."
