        "text": "The best way to bring heart and soul to any wedding reception is through a carefully curated playlist of R&B tracks. From “Summer Rain,” by Carl Thomas to \"Weak,\" by SWV and \"Tonight (Best You Ever Had),\" by John Legend, there's no better way to commemorate your big day than with the smooth sounds of artists whose music is meant to celebrate love. Best of all, R&B wedding songs are able to appeal to individuals from all generations and walks of life.\n\nThough your grandparents might not groove along with a song by Ne-Yo, they may feel inspired to get up and dance to a classic Etta James or Otis Redding tune. Your parents may even feel moved to dance when Anita Baker or Luther Vandross comes on, while your bridal party might rush to the dance floor for Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, or Snoh Aalegra.\n\nWhatever your favorites might be, we put together a list of R&B tracks to help ensure everyone has a memorable experience on your big day. Ahead, keep scrolling for the ultimate roundup of R&B wedding songs to add to your ceremony and reception playlist.\n\n01 of 90\n\n“Before I Let Go,” by Maze & Frankie Beverly\n\nLyrics of Love: “You
