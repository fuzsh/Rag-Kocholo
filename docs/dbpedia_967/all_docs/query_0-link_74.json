In a recent summarv judgment, (BillboardBuMe<i/i, May 2), U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled that MPS.com's My.MP3 service violated copyrights of member companies of the Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA). The RIAA had filed the lawsuit on behalf of its label members in January within weeks of Majors All Move Toward Eod Of MAP BY ED CHRISTMAN NEW YORK— With all five of the major labels now having apparent- ly signed the Federal Trade Com- mission's (FTC) consent decrees that will eliminate their minimum- advertised-price (MAP) policies (BilIboardfiuHe<in, May 3), the FTC is expected to publicly post the ruling imminently and invite public comment. The Warner Music Group signed a decree in January but didn't dis- close that information until early April, when it filed its 10-K form with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sources say the other majors signed the consent decree sometime during the April 27-May 1 {Continued on page I^ii) Sony, Universal Link For Web Subscription Service users to access albums via a person- al Internet account.

And by using that time to upgrade services, cross-promote, further build customer bases, and solidi- fy ownership control via their own Web sites, they hope the threat will be defused. \"My advice to retailers is to just upgrade your service. After all, if you've been in business for any period of time, it wasn't the Internet or any of the new technology that built our business- es in the first place,\" says George Daniels, owner of 30-year-old Chicago mainstay George's Music Room. \"So I don't feel threatened.

GILLEN NEW YORK— WhUe America Online (AOL) and Time Warner are awaiting consumma- tion of their planned mega-merger, the first synergistic fruit of the pairing is already evi- dent in a forthcoming album from Atlantic Records act matchbox twenty. \"Mad Season By matchbox twenty,\" due May 23 woridwide on Melisma/Lava/Atlantic (Billboard, April 1), will be the focus of what Atlantic Records executive VP/GM Ron Shapiro calls \"a groundls-eaking, interactive marketing campaign the Ukes of which has never been done before.\" In true back-scratching fashion, the initia- tive is designed not only to expose AOL's 22 million subscribers to tlie music of matchbox twenty but also to put AOL's services and music-related prod- I ucts directly into the ^^^^^B hands of matchbox ■ twenty fans. ^i(Sk Among the key elements in the mul- \"V^jt tifaceted global pro- motion are inclusion ^^^H ^^^^B °^ several pieces of AOL software on the SHAPIRO CD itself, as weU as extensive tie-ins between the album and the band and a wide range of AOL properties worWwide. Album packaging will flag the inclusion of the added interactive material, according to Shapiro. Atlantic says initial album shipments will be sUghtly more than 1 million. The group's previous release, 1996's \"Yourself Or Some- one Like You,\" has sold 6.9 million copies in the U.S., according to SoundScan. Among the online events planned for AOL members are a special AOL band area that will have music previews, videoclips, tour news, photos, and links to the act's official Web site; ongoing tour coverage from dates along the band's club trek, beginning May 16; an online chat with the group on May 22, which will be available simultaneously to AOL sub- scribers in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the U.K., among other territories; and a band tie-in to the launch of AOL's new You've Got Pictures service, which will see the members of matchbox twenty choosing the winner of a \"mad season\"-themed digital photo contest As the online service promotes the band, so too will the act help promote AOL's ven- tures. Each matchbox twenty CD will be bun- dled with two AOL-owned Internet music player properties, which are used to play back music online: a dedicated Spinner player and a customized version of AOL's WinAmp play- er with a matchbox twenty skin. (\"Skin\" refers to the player's aesthetic appearance.) The Spinner player offers direct access to a band-designed Internet channel, dubbed \"matchbox twenty radio,\" while the WinAmp plaver will give the user access to a live bonus track, \"You And I And I.\" Users do not need to be AOL subscribers to access and use the players or the Internet channel and the bonus track, according to Josh Palsra; GM of SjMiner/NuUsoft, two AOL properties. \"Those who ward to sign up, however, will be welcomed aboard: Discs also contain AOL start-up software offering the opportunity to sign up for a free trial subscription to the ser- vice, according to an AOL spokeswoman. Shapiro declined to offer any spediks regarding terms of the software deal with AOL, calling it only \"win-win for everybody.\" AOL has done such start-up bundling deals before with otJier labels, but this marks the first time it has put its Sjinner and WinAmp plajers directly onto a music product \"While you've seen online promotions for musK before, this is really the &st time that we've brought together so many different pieces of the promotional puzzle, including value-added content and software on the CD,\" says Ffelser. \"It's great for matchbox 20 fans who just purchased the CD, because now they get a bonus track and a cool castom version of both of our plajers, and it's great fcr us because they also get introduced to our music services.\" While the inclusion of interactive elements or \"hyperlinks\" on music CDs — ^which move users into the online environment wliere they could, conceivably, buy product from other Web merchants or labels— is a primarj' com- plaint in a suit filed by the National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) against Sony Music, Shapiro says he anticipates no problems with the matchbox twenty bundles. \"The whole intent of this is marketing and promotion for matchbox twenty and AOL,\" he .says. \"The intent is not to be selling match- bcK twenty albums outside of our retail part- ner base.\" NARM representatives could not be reached for comment by press time. Michael Lippman, manager of matchbox twenty, says the upside of the cross-promo- tional opportunities in the AOLTime Warn- er merger was immediately evident — and appealing — to him v^iien news of it broke. \"It was a light bulb going off;\" he says. \"As we were making this record and we saw the Internet developing, we were trying to figure out what we could do to make sure that we continue to have a relationship with the kids. That's the most important thing for us. \"So then when AOL and Time Warner [agreed to merge], I called [Warner Music Group chairman/CEO] Roger Ames and said, 'Here's the perfect opportunity to do some- thing special,' \" Lippman adds. \"And I'm real- ly haRjy with how it turned out — even more so than I expected to be.\" Atlantic's Shapiro also says that the desire to do something \"special\" was the spark for the campaign. \"Matchbox twenty is one of our biggest-selling albums and our biggest stars, and this sophomore album of theirs is not only so hugely antic- ipated after their debut album achieved diamond award [certification] sta- tus, but certainly even more so after (band member J Rob Thomas' celebrated turn with Santana (on the Grammy-winning \"Smooth\" from Santana's \"Supernatural\" album]. \"So we were of course already sitting around thinking, 'What kinds of things can we launch and market this record with that have never been done before? How big can we make it, not Just because of the anticipatron but because of how brilliant we think Oils album is?' \" Shapiro continues. \"So we were in the mind-frame of 'un- precedented, big, huge,' and the backdrop of that of course, were the mergers going on with our parent company, one of which was AOL [and the other being Warner Music's merger with EMI Recorded Music],\" he says. \"So, needless to say, we thought 'Oh God, AOL; let's go talk to AOL.' \" Shapiro adds that Atlantic has consistent- ly looked to mine promotional and marketing opportunities from its related companies, who- ever they may be, including the WB Netwraic and Time Warner's film and cable operations. \"We ahva>'s try to avail ourselves of sj-ner- gies in the relationships with our sister com- panies,\" he sajs. \"We've been verj' pro-active on those fronts and have broken acts through them. We are very synergj'-minded. So I say to our parent company, 'Keep on merging, and we'll keep exploring opportunities with our partners.' \" LETTERS COPYRIGHTS, WORK-FOR-HIRE S NAPSTER Arti-sU; must .speak out! As explained in my Jan. 29 Billboard commentai\">' (\"C'Right Change Spells Trouble For Artists\"), Con- gress amended the Copyright Act by adding \"sound recordings\" to the definition of works that may be considered \"works made for hire.\" As a result, featured artists could lose the right, previously existing in the CopjTight Act, to regain ownership of their sound recordings after 3.5 .vears from the date of copyright. Artistic control of the recordings and the future stream of income generated by them are at stake. The Amer- ican Federation of Television and Radio Art- ists (AFTRA) has been working tirelessly to reverse this harmful change. It's time for everyone concerned with this ill-advised change to call your U.S. representative at 202-225-3121, advise them of your concern on this is.sue, and urge them to eliminate the new amendment and protect artists' rights. Ann E. Chailovitz National Representative/Staft Counsel. AFTRA New York In \"Letters\" in Billboard's April 29 issue, artist Christine Lavin makes the case that because record labels unfairly exploit their artists by lajing claim to a disproportionate share of royalties, they deserve to be ripped off by rogue entities such as Napster Lavin confuses two separate issues: the onerous nature of recording contracts and simple copyright infringement Theft of intellectu- al property is just that — theft — regardless of the rightful owners. No one (except the labels themselves. I suppose) disagrees with Lavin that artists regularly get raw label deals, but in the event they were getting their fair share, they would still be as vic- timized [by Napster] as the labels. She says, \"The rules have changed,\" but the rules have not changed; copyright law is copjTight law. Furthermore, the laws of supply and de- mand have survived every business innova- tion, and the Internet will not escape. No Web-based entity w ill ever get people to buy what they don't want — just ask the folks at NasdaqI That a respected veteran like Lavin cannot recognize these principles is dis- heartening and another ca.se of musicians not being good business|«ople. That's the \"rule\" that ought to change.

Jive Works Net To Help Spears Do It Again BY GORDON MASSON LONDON — Jive Records is using Inter- net-bred marketing techniques to supjwrt the global launch of Britney Spears' sec- ond album, \"Oops! ... I Did It Again.\" A dileinma in the artist's schedule is the main reason behind the campaign, which sees the teenager involved in some global activ- ity of her own, courtesy of li\\'e promotion- al performances May 2 in Japan and May 5 in France. The launch events, in Tokyo and F^ris, are being touted by Jive as among the most ambitious ever staged for the internation- al debut of a new album. Joined by 1,000 members of the world's leading consumer media from more than 29 countries, Spears is taking part in press conferences, photo shoots, 'TV news broad- casts, and one-on-one interviews ahead of the album's release — May 3 in Japan, May 18 everywhere else. Zomtia imprint Jive hopes that the four-d^ stint between Ibkyo and Paris will be the catalyst to propel Spears' latest offering on to even greater achievements than these of her multi-platr inum debut set, \"... Baby One More Time.\" Both of the launch events involve an onstage interview with the artist, the screening of exclusive behind-the-scenes video footage, and a live per- formance that will include songs from \"Oops! ... I Did It Again.\" Stuart Watson, man- aging director of Zomba International Record Group, says the use of the Internet will not help cut the promo costs; he points to the cost of flying in hundreds of journalists to rendezvous with Spears. He tells Bill- board, \"If a superstar artist could possi- bly put themselves in every territory of the world to do their promotion, it would he great, but let's be realistic . . . It's time now to start bringing the media to the artist rather than the artist to the media. \"As a result, we decided to do an Asia/Pacific and a European launch and to fly the media to Britney,\" he adds. \"This was driven by the fact that we had a limited period only for international pro- motion. That period is seven days, so we had to come up with something to cover the world.\" Zomba and its imprint Jive are har- nessing the power of the Internet with a strategy that includes the Webcasting of both launch events. International viewing pages have been created to allow local Web site partners to access the available con- tent A range of additional online initiatives will be exploited locally by Zomba Inter- national Record Group ofRces around the world. RealNetworks is Jive's exclusive streaming partner for the two regional launch events.

NARM Takes Stand On E-Commerce Position Paper Outlines Rigtits Of Consumers, Retailers BY ED CHRISTMAN NEW YORK— In an attempt to make sure that consumer rights are taken into consideration as the industry moves toward electronic di.stribution, the National Assn. of Recording Mer- chandisers (NARM) Ls issuing a posi- tion paper titled \"Baseline Principles For Online Commerce In Music.\" The paper addresses concerns about consumers' right to privacy, con- fidentiality, and even anonjTnity. Also discussed in the paper are consumer rights under the \"first-sale doctrine,\" which ensures that consumers are free to loan music to friends, take it to parties, or give it away. While labels and technology com- panies so far have had the most input in shaping the electronic distribution business models, Pam Horovitz, NARM president, points out that the \"one wice not currently represented at any of the discussions of E-com- merce of music is the one voice with- out whom the business of music has no business: the music consumer.\" f he Songwriters Witt Tof Honors M Bin latin Awaris BY JILL PESSELNICK LOS ANGELES— \"Livnn' La Vida Loca\" earned the song of the year award at BMI's seventh annual Latin Awards, held May 1 at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel here. The sin- gle, co-written by Robi \"Draco\" Rosa and published by A Phantom Vox and Warner-Tamerlane Publishing, was the most-performed song in the BMI Latin catalog this past eligibility year An unprecedent- ed five songwriters tied for the song- writer of the year award with three songs each. The winners were last year's songwriter of the year, Kike San- tander (\"Decir Adios,\" \"Te Vas,\" \"Tu Amor\"), Estefano (\"Ciega, Sordomu- da,\" \"Dejaria Todo,\" \"Tii\"), Marco Antonio P&ez ('A Mi Qu6 Me Qued6,\" \"Huracan,\" \"Perdedor\"), Mario Quin- tero of Los Tucanes De Tyuana (' Amor Plant6nieo,\" \"Desde Que Te Amo,\" \"Ifctel CoraaSn\"), and solo artist Shaki- ra (\"Ciega, Sordomuda,\" \"Inevitable,\" \"Tu\"). Other multi-award songwriter win- ners, with two songs each, included Rosa C'Livin' La Vida Loca,\" \"Perdido Sin Ti\"), Miguel Mendoza (\"Amor Maldito,\" \"Que Mas Te Puedo Dar\"), and Alejandro Sanz ('Aquello Que Me ESste,\" \"Coraz6n Piuiio\"). In the publishing arena, Warner Music Publishing, comprising Wam- er-Ttoierlane Publishing and Right- song Music, received its second pub- lisher of the year avrard. Eight of its songs, including \"Livin' La Vida Loca,\" were on the most-performed list Several other publishers were awarded multiple citations of achieve- ment. Six awards were granted to FIPP International/Foreign Import> (Continued on vaoe 155) I Also, she points out that the \"one voice whose input appears to be un- den-alued is the voice with the most direct contact with the consumer: the music retailer\" Horovitz says the position paper came about partly because of NAHM's inclusion in the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI), in which the industry has established technology guidelines to ensure music can be transmitted securely and to ensure inter-operabili- ty \"SDMI is supposed to be agnostic to business models, but we are concerned that is not happening,\" she says. \"Some aspects of the SDMI specs don't hare anything to do with the tfichnolog>' but are bleeding over into SDMI. We think that some of these larger issues shouM be discussed outside SDMI auspices.\" For example, \"there has been no discussion within the industry about the fact that the record companies are beginning to rethink the legal def- inition of what they are selling,\" she says. \"If some believe that the down- load must be in the form of a licensed agreement between the consumer and the record company or between the record company and the retailer, then the terms of that agreement hav^ yet to be addressed, and switching to that and away from the idea of selling music should be discussed.\" Moreover, since the online shopping experience often comes with the col- lection of consumer data or, at the very least, the E-mail address of the con- sumer, the \"notion of anonjinity needs to be discussed in the marketplace,\" she saj's. Fbr example, Horovitz says, look at the Columbine High School tragedy in Littleton, Colo. \"The next time there is a shooting, the police, the press, and people will want to know what music the shooters are listening to. Right now your \\'ideo rental records are pro- tected hy law, but your music choices aren't,\" she says. Looking at it another w-ay, she says, \"if Grandma is buying music for jumor, isn't it better for that transaction to be anonymous? We think having the option of providing consumer anonymity may be a necessary piece to the digital equation.\" Furthermore, Horovitz points out there is \"a long history in the business that when people purchase music, they can loan it to friends, take it to parties, and give it away. The paper states that 'copy protection systems should not interfere with the ability to continue such practices.' \" And if copy protection systems do interfere with such practices, the in- dustry should discuss \"how we are going to market the music to consum- ers if they can't do those things any- more,\" says Horo- vitz, \"If we are changing that model, let's think carefully of how we do it and how we sell it to consumers.\" Another part of the position paper states that digital rights management (DRM) shouldn't be misused to cir- cumvent restrictions imposed upon copjTight owners by law, such as tech- nologically extending the copyright term. Also, \"no DRM system . . . should go beyond the minimum neces- sary to prevent and detect infringe- ment of lawfully created copyrights.\" The paper also stakes territory on protecting retailers' rights, pointing out that as the majors' business mod- els come into place, the retailers may suffer \"irreparable harm to their own customer bases . . . due to unethical industry practices, restrictive trading policies, and the use of shortsighted business strategies that devalue the consimier, the prodiKt and the online shopping method.\" Horovitz says that the position pap- er likely will become a better docu- ment as NARM gets feedback from the different constituents in the industry. Unsigned/Small-Laliel Acts To Be Topic Of Web Heariog BY BILL HOLLAND WASHINGTON, D.C.— The issue of whether unaffiliated U.S. recording artists or those signed to .small inde- pendent labels have been able to take full economic advantage of the Inter- net will be the subject of an overview hearing May 24 by the House of Rep- resentatives' Small Business Com- mittee. The music-related hearing is unusu- al for the committee, but a spokesman explains that since unaffiliated and small-label artists have been pioneers on the Net both in selling product and offering sound snippets or full down- loads, the lawmakers want to study how they have fared in the new digi- tal/electronic marketplace. As a staffer for the committee explains, \"The committee members want to see how these artists can take advantage of the new digital means of distribution.\" Committee staff will demonstrate the \"legal\" downloading of music from an MP3 site at the hearing, ac- cording to a staffer Independent musicians and musi- cal groups, many of whom constant- ly tour throughout the country or in their regions, have used Web sites and E-commerce as adjuncts to the normal business of selling their CDs in local stores and at gigs. One certain line of questioning the committee members are expected to pursue is whether any of the many thousands of independent artists on the Web, including relatively unex- posed regional and local artists, can achieve the necessary exposure to develop a large enough listenership to sell enough product to survive without the publicity and marketing exposure provided by larger labels.

GILLEN NEW YORK— The joint-venture Internet initiative announced May 2 by Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group (UMG) marks both a new alignment among the major-label powers and a fresh approach by them to the question of how to reap revenues from the move- ment of music online. The venture will see the two com- panies working together to develop a subscription-based service for music and video content across multiple plat- forms (BillboardAi/fetei, May 3). UMG had previously worked with BMG on an online initiative dubbed Nigel and is a co-owner with BMG of the online content/commerce site Get- Music Sony has close ties with Warn- er — ^which is preparing to merge with America Online — via their jointly owned Columbia House record club and online operation. \"It's good that these guys are beginning to think beyond the 'prod- uct\" format that they've been locked into since the dawn of the recorded music industry,\" says Aram Sinn- reich, an analyst at Jupiter Commu- nications who is a strong advxwate of the subscription approach. \"There's no question that consumer use of online masic is going to dictate the models that are successful in the future, and obviously the incredibly rapid growth of Napster has demon- strated that there's a demand for a .suhscriptionlike .service on the con- sumer end,\" he adds. \"The only ques- tion is how to make that happen on the intellectual property end and how to build a revenue model out of it And that's pretty much just a question of the devil being in the details.\" MP3.eom also announced May 2 that it had launched an on-demand masic .subscription service, the Clas- sical Music Channel, offering streams and downloads for $9.99 per month. The channel has more than 3,400 streamed tracks and more than 300 downloads, according to MP3.eom director of channel programming Chris Montgomerj: Meanwhile, Horsham, Pa.-based MusicChoice.com says it plans to expand its cable and satellite music- subscription model to the Internet by launching a subscription area on its Web site called Backstage I^ss.

LOFTHUS OSIX) — ^The spreading introduction of new technology and relatively cheap pricing is helping put Europe on a level playing field with the U.S. when it comes to Internet use by con- sumers. Starting this summer, various European telecommunications oper- ators are introducing fixed-price, high-speed Internet connections that «ill offer consumers unprecedented opportunities to evaluate and pur- chLse legitimate music on the Web. On April 26 the Internet subsidiary of British Telecom — BT\\ipen«'orid-— unveiled its nonstop Net plans, allow- ing subscribers to stay permanently connected at nl2 kilobits \\>er second (kbps) (compared with today's stan- dajid 66 kbps) for a monthly fee of 40 pounds ($64). The service, one of the first of its kind in Europe, is due to launch in July Using asymmetric dig- ital subscriber line (ADSL) technolo- gy, the service sidesteps delays and other Internet bottlenecks. On the downside, the technology, of course, also has the potential to allow for the downloading of illegitimate material at a lower price, but the ben- efits of ADSL outweigh the disad- vantages, according to music industry' sources. While stresiiing that the Interna- tional Federation of the Phonograph- ic Industry's (IFPI) concern over copyright protection remains un- changed, the organization's London- based technology e.\\ecutivie Richard Gooch says, \"It's not a technology development that has taken us by sur- prise.

The two parties were to go to court again this month after Festh'al Rec- ords (as it was known at the time) launched action in April 1999 against Zomba Australia and its managing director, Scott Murphy. Murphy pre\\i- ously was managing director of Mash- room subsidian,\" Mushi-oom Distribu- tion Services (MDS). In a joint statement May 1, the two labels announced that: • Zomba Records Australia (in- cluding the Jive and Volcano labels) will be distributed beginning July 1 by BFM Distribution, FMG's joint-vien- ture distribution company with BMG Australia. Zomba Australia is cur- rently distributed by Sony Music Entertainment Sony will continue to manufacture for Zomba Australia. • An extension of Pinnacle Records' distribution agreement with Mush- room U.K. for the U.K. and Ireland has been made. Pinnacle is a Zomba affiliate. ■ Zomba Recording Corp., the U.S. affiliate of Zomba Records Australia, has agreed to a \"first look\" arrange- ment at releasing a number of FMCJ's Australian artists in the U.S. and Canada. Zomba's Australian operations were set up in early 1999 by Murphy, four months after Festival owner News Corp. — which had a 49% share in Mushroom — bought out the remaining stake from label founder Michael Gudinski. On April 7, 1999, Festival brought an interlocutory injunction against Murphy and Zomba, claiming Murphy had taken 13 MDS staffers with him to the new label. According to court papers. Mushroom also wanted com- pensation for I0.SS of income it would have received from Britney Spears' (Coiit iinied mi imge Majors Collaborate To Succeed In German Pop Compilations Market BY WOLFGANG SPAHR HAMBURG— The heat generated in Germany's album compilations mar- ket is pushing smaller companies and indies into the shade, as the majors pool their resources and capitalize on the power of advertising on TV The majors have entered new al- liances with each other to assemble the best and most recent repertoire for such compilations as \"Bravo Hits,\" \"Viva Hits,\" \"Platinum,\" \"Formula One,\" and \"Chart Mix.\" As a result, retailers currently are carrying more than 300 differ- ent compilations. Products included in this trend include the compila- tions produced by such large retail- ers as Karstadt and Metro, as well as the indies. Media (Control's Top 20 Compila- tion chart lists only two indies: Koch with \"Pokemon — Schnapp Sie Dir AUe\" (Pokimon— Ciotta Catch 'Em All) and edel music with \"Gute Zeit- en Vol. 23\" (Good Times). More than 809t of the compilations offered are double-CDs, with 40 tracks selling for around $20. Successful joint-venture projects include \"Bravo Hits\" (Warner, EMI, Universal, Virgin, Polymcdia); \"Platin\" (Platin) (Warner, EMI, Uni- versal, Virgin); \"Chartmix\" (Warn- er, EMI, Universal, Sony); \"Viva Hits\" (Warner, EMI, Universal, Vir- 'It is not true that compilations cannibalize the singles market' - THOMAS SCHENK - gin); \"Viva Club Rotation\" (Warner, EMI); and \"Mystera\" (Mystery) (Warner, Universal, Polymedia). Although many consumers have lost track of the vast number of TV compilations, the market is still growing. Last year, volume sales of compilations increased 6.1%, to 43.8 million units, with retailers expect- ing this trend to continue. According to figures released by the Federal Assn. of the Phono- graphic Industry, CDs advertised on TV accounted for more than $475 million of Germany's total record industry annual turnover of $2.9 bil- lion. However, a new problem for the compilations market takes the form of illegally copied CDs, particularly in schools. According to industry estimates, there are more than 3..5 million CD burners in German households, and illegal copying will result in a loss to the industry of $100 million this year. Warner Special Marketing man- aging director Thomas Schenk esti- mates that the 1.2 million units sold of the late.st volume of \"Bravo Hits\" could have been 100,000 more had it not been for illegal discs offered at schools for $5 a copy. Even so, this has not prevented \"Bravo Hits\" from becoming the world's most success- ful compilation series, with total sales of more than 30 million. Another problem afflicting TV compilations in Germany is the broadcasters' decision to hike adver- tising costs by more than 30%. Con- sequently, marketers have been seeking alliances with broadcasters, which then present the CDs as part of their own station advertising. Commenting on these problems, BMG Ariola Media managing direc- tor Vera Epp-Winter says, \"At the moment, we can only offset rising media costs by entering new cre- ative alliances with media partners and by constantly optimizing our media schedules. We are trying to tie in the financial resources of external partners and sponsors from the classic con.sumer goods industry. We will be increasingly focusing on efficient use of the superb promotion and marketing tools in the Internet/online markets (Continued on page 153) Sony Expects Music Business To Stay Flat Income, Revenue Decreased In Fiscal 1999; Piracy, Pricing Called Factors BY BRIAN GARRITY NEW YOflk— Sony Corp. states that many of the factors contributing to declines in its music di\\Tsion's operat- ing income and re\\'enue for the past fis- cal j-ear also figure to weigh down its performance in the current fiscal j'ear.

In the U.S., expenses related to dig- ital media initiativ'es ai-e expected to negatively affect music's profitability, the company states. However, Sony says it expects to offset anticipated domestic declines with improved sales in Europe and Latin America and global cost reductions in areas like advertising expenses. \"The general view up to now has been that en- tertainment businesses have been a beneficial investment for Sony. However, earnings from entertainment operations have slumped for the past two years or so, owing both to the cost burden of goodwill and declining prof- itabDitj;\" wrote Salomon Smith Barney analyst Masami Fujino in a note to investors following the earnings an- nouncement Fiscal year operating income for music decreased 22.4% to 28.4 billion yen ($268 million) from 36.5 billion yen ($344 million) last year, while music revenue decreased 6.8% to 707 billion yen ($6.7 billion) from 759 billion yen ($7.1 Mlion). The company blames the weakness in its performance, in part, on the yen's appreciation against the dollar. Sony says that during the year the yen was on average 25% higher against the dol- lar at 110.6 yen ($1.04). The value of dollar-denominated earnings for Japanese exporters like Sony decrease when the value of the yen is higher. SONY On a local currency basis, which ex- cludes exchange issues, overall music sales increased approximately 3% dur- ing the fiscal yeaj; and oix!rating in- come decreased approximately 14% compared with the prevkxis year, Sony says. Sony Music Entertainment Inc., the U.S. -based operation, reports higher sales but a decrease in profit due to expenses in- curred in building its digital media strategy. The decline also reflects the fact that Sony booked revenue from a direct -marketing license contract fee in the previous year that did not recur in fiscal 1999. (Additional fig- ures were not disclosed.) Overall revenue outside of Asia was up for the year, despite decreased sales in Europe and Brazil. Hit albums during the year included Celine Dion's \"All The Way ... A Decade Of Song,\" which soM 15.4 mil- lion units worldwide during the reporting period; Ricky Martin's self- titled English-language album, which sold 14.4 million units; and Mariah Carey's \"Rainbow,\" which sold 7.1 million units, Sony says. Debut albums from Jennifer Lopez and Macy Gray sold 5.1 million units and 4.5 million units, respectively. In Japan, Sony Music Entertain- ment (Japan) Inc. and its subsidiaries report decreased revenue but im- proved profit performance due to higher album sales in Japan. 12 www.billboard.com BILLBOARD MAY 13, 2000 May, 2000 Dear Music Community, Net4Music is a leading portal for musicians on the Internet - a resource that will empower musicians by providing them with virtually iiranediate access to a variety of online music products and publishing services.

Embraces Atlantic Teens M2M Norwegians' Rise Fueled By Wnror Mirror' Video, Polcemon Single BY CARLA HAY NEW YORK— M2M Ls a rarity in the ongoing teen pop explosion. Not only do the members of M2M — 15-j'ear-old Marion Raven and 16-jiear-old Marit Larsen — write their own music and play their own instru- ments, they make up one of the few Norwegian pop acts to break through in the U.S. That breakthrough has come with \"Shades Of Purple,\" M2M's debut al- bum on Atlantic Records. The singing duo — i, whose name is derived from the members' first initials — has recently been gaining momentum for the album due to \\Tiluable T\\' e.\\posure on youth-oriented networks and i-adio support of M2M's current single, \"Mirror Mirror.\" Released March 7 in the U.S.. \"Shades Of Purple\" debuted at No. 28 on the Heatseekers chart in the March 25 issue. The album i-ose to the No. 1 pasition on that chart in the April 29 issue. \"Shades Of Purple\" attained Heatseekers Impact status when it jumped from No. 116 to No. 91 on The Billboard 200. This issue, the album is No. 102 on that chart. Meanwhile, \"Mir- ror Mirror\" has been ascending The Billboard Hot 100, where it stands this issue at No. 65. Awareness for M2M in the U.S. began to take shape last year with the release of the duo's first single, 'T)on't S^- You LuK Me,\" w+dch was featured hEAt SEKERS IMPACT on the \"Pokemon: The First Movie\" soundtrack and is also on \"Shades Of Purple.\" The song was a No. 5 hit on the Ifct 100 Singles Sales chart and reached No. 21 on The Billboard Hot 100. The duo's pleasantly upbeat pop music was inspired by the Beatles, .say Rawn and I^arsen. Adds guitarist Larsen, \"It's really important that people knon- that we worked really hard on this record and that we WTote or co-wrote all the songs.\" The duo — whose songs are co-published by Lissom Music and Warner/Chappell (ASCAP)— col- laborated on \"Shades Of Purple\" with a slew of co-writers and pro- ducers, including Max Martin (Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears), Matt Rowe (Spice Girls), and Rodney (Continued on page 149) Hatfield Shows Both Sides With 2 Bounder/Zoe Sets BY JIM BESSMAN NEW Y'ORK— Following her 1998 \"Bed,\" Juliana Hatfield has cut Vxo contrasting albums for Rounder Records' edgy imprint Zoe. iSoth \"Beautiful Crea- ture\" and \"Total System Failure\" are due May 16, singly and in a limited- edition three-pack that contains both albums, as well as a bonus disc with a screen sarer, a cover of the Police's \"Every Breath You Take,\" and a remix of \"When You Levied Me\" for \"Beautiful Creature.\" This deluxe package also features additional artwork and a letter from Hatfield. \"Beautiful Creature\" is a result of Hatfield's brief move to Los Ange- les after the release of \"Bed.\" Hat- field — who came to fame first as a member of Boston trio the Blake Babies before issuing solo indie releases — had a 1993 hit with \"My Sis- ter\" from her Mam- moth/Atlantic debut, \"Become What You Are.\" But media acclaim and attention made the naturally shy artist ELD uncomfortable, and when the label declined to release her album \"God's Foot,\" she went off on her own again. \"It was hke a big slap in the face from the gods, and it put me in my place as a human,\" says Hatfield, recalling the work that went into the unreleased project and the recogni- (Continued on page ISj) Artist-Owneil label Cropiuster Seeks Cammuiial Success BY JIM BESSMAN NEW YORK— Empowered by the \"Cropduster creed\" of 'All for one — and everyone for themsehes,\" the (we artists who make up the Bayonne, N.J.. indie label Cropduster Records embody a communal approach to the business of music. The roots/pop acts on the Crop- duster roster — Birdy, which is led by former Aquanettas drummer Steph- anie Seymour: former tabulaRASA and Winter Hours guitari.st Bob Pfer- ry; the Other 99; Julia Greenberg; and the Health & Happiness Show — also cooperatiwly own and operate the label. All are ba.sed in New York or New Jersey, and aceoi-ding to the Other 99 front man .Jeff Epstein, all are seasoned players \"without any delusions of grandeur.\" Some of them havie previously re- leased product on indie and major labels, Epstein adds. \"Everj'one has a horror story and wants to put out records on their own terms within a supportive struc- ture that we would create,\" he says. TabuIaRASA's 1994 debut album, \"Somewhere Out There,\" was the first release from Cropdustei: The label's name comes from the smoke-spewing, cropduster- like car owned by that band's guitarist, Chris FIjTin (cun'ently with the Other 99). But it vv^isn't until last year that GREENBERG Cropduster emerged as a fully func- tional label, with releases by all the current artist/owners, except the Other 99, vrfiose album is due in the fall. \"It turned into a lore-fest,\" says Greenberg. \"We all fit to- gether as a ros- ter musically and Ijersoreilitj'-ttise.\" But the joint vent- ure, she notes, helps minimize the costs of doing business that the individual acts vvTxikl have to assume, and it offers mutual benefits artistically. Cropduster has started an \"afiiliate progi'am\" in Friends of Cn^xfuster, or FOC. The program offers selected local artists the use of the Cropduster. com Web site for downloads and pur- chases of their self-released CDs. The first FOCs are lounge/pop band Green Roof- tops, English sing- er/songwriter and former Wirebirds front woman Amanda Thorpe, and country porn singer Miss Tam- EPSTCiN my Faye Starlite.

That's how we built our reputation,\" the singer recalls. And that reputation has served the band exceedingly well over the past two decades. With more than iX) million albums sokl worldwide over the course of the band's career, according to the label, Bon Jovi has been working like a baby band in getting the word out about its first album in five years, \"Crush.\" The group has already gone to an industry convention for grips and grins, conducted dozens of inter- views for international magazines, jetted to Germany to announce a world tour, and performed a major industry showcase for radio and retail May 4 in Chicago. The June 13 release is the band's first for the Lsland/Def Jam Music Group, the label that .subsumed Bon Jovi's longtime label. Mercury Records, in the Universal/ PolyGram merger. (The title comes out May 17 in Japan and Australia and May 29 in the rest of the world outside the U.S.) \"We actually started our market- ing plan months ago when the band went into the studio and people could watch them make the recoi'd via the Internet,\" says Island/Def .Jam se- nior director of product development Beth Tallman (Billboard, .Jan. 22). It helped spread the word among those at the label that the boys were back in tov\\-n. \"Seeing the band pei'form live Multiple GlAMAs Go To 'HoUwig,' 'Out' Artists Ndegeocello, Hentges NEW YORK— Me'shell Ndegeocello and her Mawrick opus \"Bitter\" dom- inated the fourth annual Gay/Les- bian American Music Awards (GLAMA) on April 26, garnering three awartis — including the top tro- phy, for album of the year.

Three-time GLAMA recipient Catie Curtis took home another this year for \"What's Tlie Matter'?.\" from her Rykodise recording \"A Crash Course In Roses.\" Curtis was previ- ously honored in 1996 and 1998. \"I've been to many awards ceremonies,\" she said, accepting her GLAMA for out song. \"But at GLAMA, I feel like I've found my musical home.\" Recently split Luscious Jack- son received the best pop perfor- mance GLAMA for \"Nervous Breakthrough.\" from their album \"Electric Honey\" (Capitol/Grand Royale).

BY LARRY FLICK NEW YORK— Carly Simon's first collection of original pop tunes in five years, \"The Bedroom Tapes,\" nearly didn't happen — thanks to a case of writer's block that had the famed artist briefly believing that her song- writing days might be over. \"It was a troubling time,\" she re- calls. \"But in the end I realized that all writers go through periods when words — or in my case, words and music — escape them.\" In 1997, however, Simon would rediscover her creative path partly via a letter that she wrote to George Gershwin — a letter that would be- come \"In Honor Of You (George),\" the elegant closer of \"The Bedroom Tapes,\" due in stores May 16 from Arista. \"The letter I wrote was more dir- ected at George than at Ira Gersh- win, because it was in the folds of the musical language that I was brought back to thinking that per- haps I had something to say — because I was passionate about it after all,\" she says. Simon also foimd herself reaching to music as a source of strength after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. \"When you are challenged with a serious disease, you have to struggle to get to the surface. If you let go, you can drift. I had to latch on to something in myself that was strong. It would be my music.\" From that point, she set up shop in her grown daughter Sally's bedroom, employing simple methods of engi- neering she learned from studio vet- erans Bobby Eichorn and Frank Garfi. The songs started to flow. \"It proved to be the mast incredi- ble, liberating way to make music,\" Simon says. \"I did almost everything alone, without any kind of outside interference. I could make mistakes over and over without fear I could experiment I could play. It allowed me to open my mind and rethink the way I'd be writing.\" The resulting collection is a feast not only for Simon loyalists but for fans of complex, richly detailed song- writing. Stylistically, it ranges from guitar-etched rock (\"Our Affair\") to piano-driven pop (\"So Many Stars\"), with an ample dose of Simon's won- derfully intimate lyrics — most notably the painfully honest yet utterly hopeful ballad \"Scars.\" \"It's a beautiful record,\" says Tom Corson, Arista senior VP of world- wide marketing. \"And it's a record that we're extremely proud to be a part of. We expect to be working this for some time to come.\" The set opens on Monday (8), when the single \"Big Dumb Guy\" ships to AC and triple-A radio. \"It's a quality track with a pointed sense of humor and a catchy hook,\" says Corson of the acoustic/pop strummer. The centerpiece of the marketing strategy for \"The Bedroom TYipes\" is an extensive run of television ap- pearances. \"The media has shown tremendous interest in this project,\" says Adam Lowenberg, director of artist devel- opment at the label. \"There's a large audience waiting for a great new Carly Simon record.\" At the top of Simon's television agenda is a four- part series of ap- pearances on \"Good Morning America,\" run- ning May 17-19. The first three segments will be culled from an SIMON interview con- ducted by Diane Sawyer at Simon's home in Martha's Vineyard, Mass. The final segment on May 19 will offer footage from a performance taped at New York's Bryant Park on May 16. At the show, Simon will do eight songs — four from \"The Bedroom Tapes\" and four of her classic tunes. Immediately after the perfor- mance, Simon will do an autograph signing at a Tower Records booth that will be set up in the park. \"We think it's safe to say that this will be the first in-store appearance held in a park,\" says Corson. \"It's completely appropriate to do .some- thing so unusual with Carly — who is such a unique and special artist.\" Beyond \"Good Morning America,\" Simon's slate of television appear- ances includes \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show,\" \"The View,\" and \"Late Show With David Letterman.\" A special with the Bravo nctwxirk is in the plan- ning stages, as are spots on \"20/20,\" \"QVC,\" A&E's \"Live By Request,\" \"Larry King Live,\" and the Oxygen network. Simon will also be a highly visible figure on the Internet in the coming weeks. The artist has committed to chats on the Barnes & Noble, Ama- zon, and Borders sites. Additionally, a Mother's Day promotion with iVil- lage.com is in the works. ar inus 9n lt ^^^■b u s n ( 3 S S BOXSCORE TOP 10 CONCERT GROSSES ARTISTISI Ver-ue DalflLs; liniu FYicelil AtHnianca CapdUtr PisDotsr mwnmntiiif COULDEEmUHD Zom Amphiifieaire.

Artists & Music BON JOVI (Coiitiinied fmm ixige 10) group's tenure at the label, he says he's glad the band stayed with what remains of Mercury. \"When other artists jumped ship and went over to Interscope, I didn't. I said, 'I'm gon- na stay right here and be the guy that has always been on Mercury until there is no more Mercury.' \" That loyalty is not something Lyor Cohen, president of Island/Def Jam, takes lightly. \"I feel like I have a fiduciary responsibility to erery one of our artists to do the best job, but for ,Jon Bon .Jovi to have decided to stay puLs even more pre.ssure on us.\" When the band, managed by Da- vid Munns and Paul Korzilius for Bon .lovi Management, reunited 18 months ago to begin working on its first album since \"The.se Days,\" .Jon Bon .Jo\\'i surprised his bandmatcs by walking in with 30 songs. He then spent the next year writing another SO .songs with band guitarist Richie Sambora. The band took its time preparing the album, \"waiting for the dust to settle from the merger,\" says Jon Bon .Imi, and getting m-er producer Bruce Fairbairn's death, \"Bruce and IpnHlucer) Bob Rock had agreed to co-produce the record. It was the first time they were ewr going to co- pro<iuce an album.\" Ultimatel.y, the band turned to relative newcomer Luke Ebbin, who has worked with Splendor. The album's centerpiece is \"The Ne.xt 100 Years,\" which starts out simply and swells into a Beatlesque \"A Day In The Life\" opus, replete with a 64-piece orchestra. Other highlights include \"Older,\" a fim song about getting better as one ages, and the ballad \"'Thank You For Loving Me,\" which .Jon Bon Jovi wrote after hearing Brad Pitt utter the words in the movie \"Meet Joe Black.\" \"IThe .song's] gonna be the wed- ding song of the next five years,\" says .Jon Bon .Jmi. \"It'll be a monster.\" First single \"It's My Life\" is al- ready off to a good start at hot AC, top 40, and rock radio. \"When we first started playing it, we didn't say who it was,\" says Steve King, PD for WHAM Montgomery, Ala. \"The phones just blew up . . .
