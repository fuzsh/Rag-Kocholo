        "text": "Three old associates of Bob Dylan died in July: folk singer Happy Traum, who was in the group that first recorded Blowin’ In The Wind; Bernice Johnson Reagon of The Freedom Singers, a black group who sang We Shall Overcome while linking arms with Dylan and others at the 1963 Newport Festival; and Mary Martin, the mover-and-shaker who brought The Band to Dylan. More on all three below.\n\nThe most tragic music story in July was that of Grammy-nominated gospel group The Nelons. Kelly Nelon Clark, her husband Jason Clark, and daughter Amber Nelon Kistler died in a plane crash, while flying to Seattle where they were going to join a cruise ship as performers. Another daughter, Autumn Nelon Streetman, was not on the flight. Four others died in the crash. The Nelons were inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nThe Four Top\n\nFor 16 years, Abdul “Duke” Fakir was the last surviving member of the hit-making Four Tops. Now he has left us at the age of 88. Fakir was the son of an immigrant from what is now Bangladesh and an African-American mother with Ethiopian heritage (or, as somebody quite demented might claim, a white mother. He founded the Four Tops, orignally the Four Aims, with singer Levi Stubbs in 1953, when he was 17 years old. He performed as a Four Top for more than 70 years, retiring only two days before his death.\n\nBack in 1953, he and Levi brought in Lawrence Payton and Renaldo “Obie” Benson, and the line-up would remain unchanged until 1997, when Payton died of cancer at the age of 59. Payton was followed by Benson in 2005 and Stubbs in 2008. Duke kept the show rolling with new members; in the end he even anointed his own successor so that the Four Tops franchise may survive him.\n\nBy the time the Four Tops came to Motown, they were already veterans. Working with the Holland-Dozier-Holland team (who were subject of a Songbook a couple of years ago) in particular, they scored a string of classic hits. In the late 1960s their sound became more mature under Norman Whitfield’s production, but though critically well-received it yielded no hits.\n\nCommercial success returned when the Four Tops moved to ABC-Dunhill, with hits like 1972’s Keeper Of The Castle and, the following year, Ain’t No Woman (Like the One I’ve Got). By 1976 the mainstream hits dried up again, which even a short sojourn to the Philly Soul scene couldn’t help, though they enjoyed a UK Top 3 hit with When She Was My Girl in 1981. They had a final big hit in the UK with 1988’s not great Loco In Acapulco, from the movie Buster.\n\nIn late December 1988, the Four Tops received an invitation to perform that song on BBC’s Top of the Pops, which forced them to cancel their flight home. That flight, Pan Am 103, exploded over Lockerbie in Scotland in a terrorist attack…\n\nThe White Blues Godfather\n\nFew people can claim to have had as much influence on British blues — and by that virtue on the development of rock music — as John Mayall, who has died at 90. Encouraged by Alexis Korner (one person who might claim greater influence), Mayall founded the Bluesbreakers in 1963. The band’s rotating roster of members included up-and-coming musicians such as Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood, who went on to form their own successful groups. Mayall himself was known for his distinctive slide guitar and bluesy vocals.\n\nThe featured song, 1964’s I’m Your Witchdoctor, has a line-up that includes Clapton on guitar, McVie on bass, and Hughie Flint (future half of McGuinness Flint) on drums, with Mayall on vocals and keyboards. It was produced by a pre-Led Zep Jimmy Page.\n\nDespite his influence and critical acclaim, Mayall never achieved commercial mainstream success, certainly not on the level of those whom he had mentored. Mayall was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nThe Queen of HiNRG\n\nIn 1984, Evelyn Thomas issued the anthem of HiNRG — the mid-’80s heir of disco — with the appropriately-titled High Energy. The song, a big hit in the UK and Europe, also soundtracked my 1984 (it features on Life In Vinyl 1984 Vol. 1). Follow-up singles Masquerade and Heartless were popular in the clubs, but had no great hit potential (Heartless is the better of the two).\n\nPrevious to High Energy, Chicago-born Thomas had enjoyed a couple of UK hits in the 1970s, reaching #26 in 1976 with Weak Spot, and just failing to reach the Top 40 with Doomsday. Both were popular on the Northern Soul scene.\n\nThe Stealers Wheel\n\nThe greatest success in the musical career of Joe Egan was the Stealers Wheel 1973 hit Stuck In The Middle With You, which he co-wrote with Gerry Rafferty. On the video, it is Egan miming to Rafferty’s vocal track, as the latter had by then left the band, temporarily. On the record, Egan does the harmonies and plays keyboard and, I think, rhythm guitar.\n\nEgan had played with his school friend Rafferty in various bands and as session musicians in the 1960s. They founded Stealers Wheel in 1972. The group lasted for two LPs, and split in 1975, before the release of their third album, Right Or Wrong. Since both were tied to complicated contracts, they were unable to release any solo recordings for three years.\n\nRafferty bounced back in 1978 with the mega-hit Baker Street. Egan couldn’t match that success, even though his 1979 solo debut, Out Of Nowhere, received very good reviews. The 1981 follow-up album, Map, received little attention and failed to sell well. Since Egan didn’t like being in the public eye anyway, he retired as a recording act.\n\nThe Golf Anthem Writer\n\nA second cousin of Kenny’s, Dave Loggins made a name for himself with his fine US #5 hit Please Come To Boston, later covered to great effect by Joan Baez (featured on Any Major American Road Trip Vol. 1). He had another hit in 1984 with Anne Murray, Nobody Loves Me Like You Do, though he didn’t write (it was also recorded the following year by Whitney Houston on her debut album).\n\nLoggins also wrote Three Dog Night’s 1973 hit single Pieces Of April, Morning Desire by Kenny Rogers and Juice Newton’s You Make Me Want To Make You Mine. He also wrote for acts like Tanya Tucker, Wynonna Judd, Reba McEntire, Billy Ray Cyrus, Alabama, Toby Keith, Don Williams and Crystal Gayle. His 1980 song Augusta, meanwhile, became the theme song of golf’s US Masters tournament.\n\nThe System Critic\n\nThe 1970s were politically tumultuous in West Germany, and among the critics of the system were the band Ton Steine Scherben, which was formed in West Berlin in 1970, led by singer Rio and French-born guitarist R.P.S. Lanrue (real name Ralph Peter Steitz), who has died at 74.\n\nThe band’s music drew from folk, rock, and blues influences, with a distinct anarchic rock edge which anticipated to advent of punk. Their lyrics were confrontational, with 1975’s Keine Macht für Niemand (No power for nobody) becoming an anthem for the anti-establishment movement.\n\nThat outspokenness brought TSS in frequent conflict with the authorities. In 1972, they were banned from performing in West Berlin after Reiser at a gig condemned police brutality.\n\nTon Steine Scherben split in 1985 after a series of internal conflicts. Lanrue continued to play on Reiser’s solo albums, but did not join any reunions until after the lead singer’s death in 1996.\n\nThe Hit Writer\n\nSome clever people will refer, with a knowing smile, to Gary Pucket’s 1968 hit Young Girl as a paedo anthem which cannot be countenanced today. They are fools. The lyrics make it clear that the singer is deliberately avoiding accusations of pederasty the moment he realises the subject of his affection is, in fact, underaged.\n\nThe man who wrote and produced the song, Jerry Fuller, has now died at the age of 85. Fuller had tried his luck at a recording career in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, broaching the Billboard Top 100 on four occasions (his peak was #63 with his 1959 version of Tennessee Waltz), and returned as a country singer in the late 1970s.\n\nBut it was as a songwriter and producer that he made his mark. Long before the chart-topping Young Girl, he had written several hits for Ricky Nelson — Travelin’ Man, A Wonder Like You, Young World, and It’s Up to You — and The Knickerbockers’ 1965 hit Lies. His song Show And Tell, originally recorded by Johnny Mathis (as featured on The Originals – Soul Vol. 2), became a soul hit in 1973 for Al Wilson.\n\nFuller also produced acts like Andy Williams, Mark Lindsay, The Peanut Butter Conspiracy, Betty Davis, Billy Joe Royal, Mac Davis, O.C. Smith, Johnny Mathis, George Clinton, George Clinton, Glen Campbell, Collin Raye, and more.\n\nThe Folk Pioneer\n\nAmong that first wave of the Greenwich Village folk scene in the early 1960s was Happy Traum. He played on the historic Broadside Ballads recording session in late 1962 alongside other folk musicians such as Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Phil Ochs, Gil Turner, Peter LaFarge and The Freedom Singers (see next entry).\n\nWith his group The New World Singers, Traum recorded the first versions of Dylan’s Blowin’ In The Wind (as part of the Broadside Ballads session) and Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right. He recorded a number of songs with Dylan, a few albums with his brother Artie, and several solo efforts.\n\nApart from recording, Traum also taught songwriting and guitar. From the late 1960s, he wrote several instructional books and articles, and taught workshops at folk festivals and colleges.\n\nThe Activist\n\nAnother folk pioneer left us, a day before Traum, in Bernice Johnson Reagon. Born in Albany, Georgia, in 1942, she studied music and became involved in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), where she began singing and writing songs for the civil rights struggle.\n\nAs mentioned in the entry for Happy Traum, she was a member of The Freedom Singers, who were founded as a touring group to sing at SNCC rallies (she was married to fellow member Cordell Reagon from 1963-67). The Freedom Singers became part of the pioneering folk movement of the early 1960s, famously singing We Shall Overcome while linking arms with Dylan, Joan Baez and Peter, Paul & Mary at the 1963 Newport Festival.\n\nIn 1971, Johnson Reagon co-founded the vocal group Sweet Honey In The Rock, which became renowned for its powerful harmonies and politically charged lyrics. In 2000 she founded the global music ensemble Voices Of The South, which brought together musicians from diverse cultures to promote understanding and collaboration.\n\nA PhD holder, Johnson Reagon was also a dedicated educator and academic, focusing on the relationship between music and social justice. She played a key role in preserving and documenting the music of the civil rights movement.\n\nThe Scout\n\nTalent scout, manager and record executive Mary Martin, who has died at 85, helped start the careers of the likes of Leonard Cohen, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Rodney Crowell and Vince Gill, but maybe her greatest single act in music history was to bring together Bob Dylan and The Band.\n\nMartin was in the audience at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival on the day Bob Dylan went electric, to widespread booing. Martin listened to it all, found it wanting, and decided that Dylan needed a good backing band. She knew a rock band called The Hawks, whom she virtually forced on an initially reluctant Dylan. The backing group renamed itself The Band, and it worked out pretty well for all concerned. The cat Dylan holds on the cover of his 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was Martin’s.\n\nIn 2001, Martin co-executive produced a tribute album of songs by Hank Williams, titled Timeless and featuring acts such as Dylan, Emmylou Harris, Mark Knopfler, Sheryl Crowe, Tom Petty, Lucinda Williams, Keith Richards, Keb’ Moe, Johnny Cash and others.\n\nThe Canadian-born Martin was a chain smoker with a tendency to colourful language who stood her ground in a male-dominated world, especially when it came to protecting artists against the dictates of profit.As always, this post is reproduced in illustrated PDF format in the package, which also includes my personal playlist of the featured tracks.

If so, then he’d be the third member to pass away in successive years, leaving only keyboardist Calum Malcolm behind. However, I could find no confirmation of Lou’s death…\n\nThe French Goddess\n\nIn the 1960s, Françoise Hardy was the dream woman for the discerning man, one whose sex appeal was predicated as much on her beauty as it was on her French coolness.\n\nHardy had the ethereal, sometimes melancholic voice of the chanteuse, but she cut her teeth in the ye-ye genre, the French pop of the early-to-mid 1960s. She also had some success across the border as a singer of German songs. As she grew out of all that, Hardy effortlessly merged chanson, pop and folk to create a stylish sound, which was accompanied by lyrics, many written by herself, that often were personal and reflective. As a female artist who explored serious themes that reflected the changing culture, Hardy was a trailblazer for her generation.\n\nThe Soul Songstress\n\nBeing of Cuban and Puerto Rican descent, Angela Bofill broke barriers as one of the first Latina women to record success in soul music. A talented singer-songwriter, Bofill scored hits with tracks like This Time I’ll Be Sweeter, I Try, Angel Of The Night, Tonight I Give In, and I Just Wanna Stop. She was also an accomplished jazz singer and composer.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007 she suffered strokes which required long rehabilitation processes, with benefit concerts held to assist Bofill with the bills.\n\nThe Hitwriter\n\nFor many people, Suspicious Minds is their favourite Elvis Presley song. The song was written and originally recorded by Mark James, who has died at 83. The story of Suspicious Minds is told in The Originals: Elvis Presley Vol. 2. Elvis later also recorded the James songs Always On My Mind (originally recorded by Brenda Lee, and a hit for Willie Nelson and for the Pet Shop Boys), Raised On A Rock, It’s Only Love, and Moody Blue, the title track of his final album.\n\nThe Texan, born as Francis Zambon, had his first taste of success with Hooked On A Feeling, a song first recorded and taken to #5 in the US pop charts by his childhood friend B.J. Thomas (later also a hit for Blue Swede). Hooked On A Feeling was inspired by James’ high school sweetheart Karen Taylor — who also inspired Suspicious Minds. James also wrote Brenda Lee’s hit Sunday Sunrise.\n\nThe Selecter\n\nAt the vanguard of the great ska revival of the late 1970s and early ’80s was Coventry’s The Selecter. The band’s co-lead singer Gaps Hendrickson has now died 73. In the band, Gaps tended to operate as second lead behind Pauline Black, but his energetic stage presence lifted the band’s live performances.\n\nThe Selecter split in 1982. Subsequent revivals created rival iterations, one led by Black, the other by guitarist and chief songwriter Neol Davis; Gaps joined Team Black, retiring only after he was diagnosed with cancer last year.\n\nThe Trumpeter\n\nLast week I was looking at the records which keyboard legend Greg Phillinganes had appeared on (yes, for a future Collection). Literally two hours later I had cause to look at the credits accumulated by session trumpeter Gary Grant — for this post, since he has died — and came across loads of records on which he and Phillinganes had played (at one point I double-checked that I wasn’t reading the latter’s list of credits).\n\nAmong those credits are Michael Jackson’s Don’t Stop Till You Get Enough, Thriller, Wanna Be Startin’ Something, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, and Brothers Johnson’s Stomp. Grant also played on one of my favourite late-’70s soul tracks, Cheryl Lynn’s You’re The One (featured on the Bernard Purdie Collection Vol. 2), and on dance classics like Donna Summer’s Bad Girls and Teena Marie’s Behind The Groove. He was part of the Earth, Wind & Fire horn section on the Faces and Raise albums, played on various Lionel Richie songs, including the gorgeous You Are, on Toto’s Rosanna (featured on Any Major Life in Vinyl 1982), on almost all tracks on Al Jarreau’s excellent eponymous 1983 album (including Boogie Down), on Michael McDonald’s Sweet Freedom, on Teddy Pendergrass’ Joy, and so much more.\n\nI could make a list of the most significant artists Grant played for, but that list would exceed a hundred names…\n\nThe Satirist\n\nFew people can make a career out of being a Jew in Texas, but Kinky Friedman achieved that in the 1970s with his provocatively named band The Texas Jewboys. Friedman’s countercultural songs were often satirical — much like those of his contemporary John Prine; both wrote songs titled Dear Abby — and referred to his Jewish background with titles like They Ain’t Makin’ Jews Like Jesus Anymore and Ride ’Em Jewboy. Friedman hated bigots, but as an equal opportunity offender, he also had ways of annoying the left, especially feminists.\n\nAside from music, Friedman was a writer of satirical mystery novels, and tried his hand at politics, running as an independent for Texas’ governorship in 2006, getting 12% of the vote, coming fourth out of six candidates.\n\nThe Producer\n\nAs June ended, news came of the death of producer Peter Collins at 73. Born in 1951 in Reading, England, Collins tried his hand at being a folk singer, releasing a debut album while still a teenager in 1970. Optimistically titled First Album, it was also the last, and Collins moved behind the scenes.\n\nIn the 1980s he became the producer of hits such as Musical Youth’s Pass The Dutchie; The Piranhas’ Tom Hark; Matchbox’s Rockabilly Rebel; The Belle Stars’ The Clapping Song; Nik Kershaw’s Wouldn’t It Be Good, I Won’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me, The Riddle, Don Quixote, and Wide Boy; The Lambretta’s Poison Ivy; Tracy Ullman’s Breakaway and They Don’t Know; Blancmange’s The Day Before You Came; Matt Bianco’s Half A Minute, Whose Side Are You On, and Sneaking Out The Back Door; Gary Moore & Phil Lynott’s Out In The Fields; Gary Moore’s Empty Rooms and Over The Hills And Far Away; and Alice Cooper’s Hey Stoopid. For Rush he produced the hit albums Power Windows and Hold Your Fire. Between 1992 and 2011 he co-produced six albums of the Indigo Girls.\n\nOther acts he produced for include Bon Jovi, Billy Squire, UK Subs, Shakin’ Stevens, Air Supply, Alvin Stardust, Queensrÿche, Freddie McGregor, Nanci Griffith, Tom Jones, Wax, Jane Wiedlin, The Cardigans, Voice Of The Beehive, Divinyls, Shawn Mullins, Heather Nova, Kenny Loggins, Lisa Loeb, Jewel, LeeAnn Rimes, Carbon Leaf, Brian Setzer Orchestra, Rick Astley, among others.\n\nThe Rap-Rocker\n\nI have dedicated a whole series to the concept of not feeling guilty about enjoying music, but there are some songs which I’d not easily volunteer to admit liking. So it takes the death — at the absurdly young age of 49 — of Shifty Shellshock of alt.rock band Crazy Town for me to publicly confess that I like their one big hit, 2001’s Butterfly. Spin called it a “nu metal power ballad”; I like that description.\n\nI recall watching the video at the time, and noting the singer’s abundance of tattoos, introducing me to the notion of sleeves before that was really a thing (though by today’s standards, Shifty was showing restraint). It certainly did nothing to inspire me to acquire a tat, but Shifty blazed a trail for illustrated men and women everywhere. And then there was all the metal attached to his face; I hope he took great care around magnets.\n\nBy all accounts, Shifty — known to Mother Shellshock as Seth Binzer — was a lovely kind of fellow who enjoyed playing practical jokes. His long struggles with addiction eventually killed him, via an accidental drug overdose.\n\nThe Golden Age Actress\n\nWith the death of Janis Paige at the age of 101, one of the last stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood has left us. Born on September 16, 1922, as Donna Mae Tjaden, she started appearing on stage at the age of 5 at amateur shows. After leaving school, she went to Hollywood as a singer and a pin-up model.\n\nPaige appeared in her first movie in 1944, and subsequently also performed on Broadway (including in the original cast of the 1954 musical The Pajama Game) and TV (starring in her own sitcom in 1955-56, It’s Always Jan). She released an album of standards in 1956, by virtue of which she finds inclusion in this post.\n\nHer last movie appearance was in 1994; her last TV role in 2001.As always, this post is reproduced in illustrated PDF format in the package, which also includes my personal playlist of the featured tracks.

Monday, July 2, 1956. Elvis turned up for his third and final recording session there to lay down the tracks for Hound Dog, the song’s eventual b-side, Don’t Be Cruel, and the ballad Any Way You Want Me.\n\nBy now, Elvis had become confident enough to take charge of the session, for all intents and purposes acting as the producer. He had decided which songs to record, and would run through as many takes as necessary for the perfect recording. Occasionally, when a backing musician would make a mistake, he would sing a note out of key or commit another error, forcing another take. In the seven-hour session, 31 takes of Hound Dog were recorded (and 28 of Don’t Be Cruel). Elvis listened to them all, narrowed down the choices. Eventually, he settled for Take 18 of Hound Dog (some sources say it was number 28, others yet suggest the final one).\n\nBefore the session, the story goes, RCA had procured the first recording of the Leiber/Stoller composition, Willie Mae “Big Mama” Thornton’s blues rendition from 1953, to know what their star was planning to record. Everybody was aghast: they thought it was horrible, and were unable to comprehend why Elvis would want to record that, as Gordon Stoker of the vocal backing group The Jordanaires later recalled. Stoker and the other puzzled people in the studio obviously did not watch TV.\n\nAlmost a month before the recording session, on June 5, Elvis had performed the song, hip-swivellingly, on The Milton Berle Show, more or less the way he was going to record it on July 2. DJ Fontana had already introduced the drum roll between the verses, and Scotty Moore the guitar solo. He performed the song again on TV the day before the recording session: the performance on The Steve Allen Show when, wearing a tuxedo, Presley had to sing the song to a bemused, top-hatted basset hound. Elvis was a good sport about it, at one point even laughing at the absurd set-up. He later recalled it as the most peculiar experience of his career — and that presumably includes all those bizarre movies! The Berle performance, seen by a reported 40 million people, had created a storm of protest by the guardians of morality at Elvis’ “vulgarity”. Could anybody really have been so oblivious as to regard Rainey’s record as a blueprint, as if Elvis had no idea what to do with the song?\n\nThe truth is that Elvis didn’t base his version on Big Mama Thornton at all. In fact, the song had crossed the tracks within weeks of Thornton’s record, with versions by country acts such as Eddie Hazelwood, Betsy Gay, Bob Wills, Jack Turner and Billy Starr. But it was a 1955 cover by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys which provided the template for Elvis’ interpretation. Elvis had seen the Italo-American band during his discouraging concert engagement in Vegas in April/May 1956. Having ascertained that Bell wouldn’t mind, Elvis quickly included their reworked Hound Dog in his setlist.\n\nElvis probably was aware of Thornton’s version, and perhaps heard some of the country covers that had been released; one source says Elvis was familiar with it already in 1953. But Elvis’ Hound Dog is entirely a cover of the Bellboys’ template, incorporating their sound and modified lyrics (“Cryin’ all the time” for Thornton’s “Snoopin” round my door”, “You ain’t never caught a rabbit, and you ain’t no friend of mine” for “You can wag your tail, but I ain’t gonna feed you no more” and so on). Happily Elvis dispensed with the lupine howls. What he produced was arguably the first ever punk song.\n\nBell and his band enjoyed a mostly undistinguished recording career, with only one real hit, Giddy Up A Ding Dong, which was much bigger in Europe than it was in the US, in 1956. Adapted lyrics notwithstanding, Bell received no writing credit for Elvis’ Hound Dog. The writing credit remained entirely with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who were still R&B-obsessed teenagers when in 1952 they were commissioned by the producer Johnny Otis to write a song for Big Mama Thornton. They did so in 15 minutes. Otis claimed co-authorship, and his co-credit appeared on the label of the Thornton single. Leiber & Stoller fought him in court, and won. Thornton’s recording became a #1 hit on the R&B charts in 1953. Her 12-bar blues inspired a plagiarised response song, which turned out to be the first ever record released by Sun Records, Sam Phillips’ label which would go on to discover Elvis.\n\nThree years after Thornton’s hit, Stoller honeymooned on board of the sinking Andrea Doria. His life was spared. Returning to New York, he was greeted at the pier by Leiber with the news that Hound Dog had become a smash hit. “Mama Thornton?” Stoller asked. “No, some white kid named Elvis Presley,” replied Leiber.\n\nThe songwriters, R&B purists both, resented Elvis’ version. When, inevitably, they were commissioned to write for Elvis a year later, for the Jailhouse Rock film, they were not particularly happy. As a form of revenge, Leiber wrote for Elvis to sing this line in the title track: “You’re the cutest little jailbird I ever did see.” The prison in Jailhouse Rock was not co-ed. When they finally met Elvis, the songwriters realised that Elvis was a kindred spirit who genuinely shared their love for R&B, and they became good friends. Stoller even appeared in the film, as a piano player.\n\nThere have been many cover versions of Hound Dog, drawing from both Thornton’s and Presley’s templates (but not from the country versions that came after the former and before the latter). The division is fairly predictably between those who in the lyrics are ejecting a freeloader and those who note in the titular canine an Elmer Fuddian rate of failure in hunting down rabbits.\n\nBlues aficionadoes like Eric Clapton will opt for the Big Mama original, with its coherent lyrics in which the term “hound dog” serves as a euphemism for something quite rude — “something like motherfucker”, according to Leiber. The Elvis fans tend to pay tribute to his doggerel version — and to Presley. In his live version John Lennon drawls “Elvis, I love ya”. The Rolling Stones in their horrible 1978 live version from Memphis, provide an example of when a tribute is exactly the opposite.\n\nJerry Lee Lewis borrows from Elvis’ sound but goes with Thornton’”s lyrics. Conversely, blues master Albert King‘s version is melodically closer to Thornton, but uses the Presley lyrics. And the Everly Brothers employ a martial beat.\n\nPat Boone, on an Elvis tribute album whose cover references the gold suit sleeve, croons to a pseudo baroque backing before shifting gear into what might be called an easy listening rock & roll groove which even by 1963 would have sounded hopelessly dated. At one point Patrick sings one of the aggressively ungrammatical lines of the Presley version, and then “corrects” it: “You have not never caught a rabbit and you aren’t no friend of mine.” One suspects that Boone did not cherish the song. Rockin’ Rocky Rockwell also betrayed no fondness for the song in what appears to be a mocking take on the Lawrence Welk Show in 1956. Chubby Checker‘s hound dog is — obviously — “twisting all the time”.\n\nIf the twisting and surfing versions provide a time capsule, then so might the 1977 version by the Puhdys, East Germany’s leading rock band at the time. One might imagine Erich Honecker and Leonid Brezhnev boogying along to it after a hard day of watching goose-stepping soldiers and interminable processions of tanks on the International Day of Glorious Proletarian Combine Harvester Soviet Friendship Parade.\n\nObviously Shakin’ Stevens did a version, and does well with a rough-vocaled uptempo boogie treatment, also from 1977. T. Rex‘s outtake came out only in 1993; I don’t know when it was recorded, but it regrettably defies all glam expectations as Bolan comes across all whiney folk-singer with Hound Dog”.\n\nSigue Sigue Sputnik did their version in 2001, performing it in the way their 1980s incarnation might have expected music to sound like in the year 2000, while Tom Jones‘ take sounds exactly as you’d think it would, Likewise both Jimi Hendrix versions sound as you might imagine them to, even if they are very different from one another (1969’s Hound Dog Blues features Traffic’s Chris Woods on sax).\n\nAmong the best re-imaging is, surprisingly, James Taylor‘s 2009 take. I rather like Betty Everett‘s soul cover (like Taylor’s, using Thornton lyrics) from 1964’s It’s In His Kiss LP, or the burning southern soul track by Ruby Andrews, whose invitation to “wag your tail” might mean exactly what we think it does. But the best version of Hound Dog is the one which Elvis Presley recorded that summer’s day in 1956 in New York, Take Number 18.\n\nAnd count the number of versions in which some barking, woofing or howling takes place — starting with the original.\n\n(This post has been recycled from June 2014)\n\nBig Mama Thornton (1953) • Billy Starr (1953) • Eddie Hazelwood (1953) • Betsy Gay (1953) • Jack Turner (1953) • Little Esther (Phillips, 1953) • Freddie Bell & the Bellboys (1956) • Elvis Presley (Milton Berle Show, June 5, 1956) • Elvis Presley (Steve Allen Show, July 1, 1956) • Elvis Presley (1956) • Rockin’ Rocky Rockwell (1956) • Gene Vincent and The Blue Caps (1956) • Jimmy Breedlove (1958) • Chubby Checker (1960) • Sammy Davis Jr (as part of a medley with ‘What’d I Say, 1961) • Don Lang & The Twisters (1962) • Â Pat Boone (1963) • Betty Everett (1964) • The Surfaris (1964) • Little Richard (1964) • Big Mama Thornton with Buddy Guy (1965) • The Easybeats (1966) • Chuck Jackson (1966) • Duffy’s Nucleus (1967) • Jimi Hendrix Experience (1967) • Jimi Hendrix (as Hound Dog Blues, 1969) • Albert King (1969) • Ruby Andrews (1972) • Conway Twitty (1972) • John Lennon (live 1972) • John Entwistle (1973) • Jerry Lee Lewis (1974) • Elvis Presley (live in Chicago, November 1976) • Puhdys (1977) • Shakin’ Stevens (1977) • The Rolling Stones (live in Memphis, 1978) • Sha-Na-Na (1978) • Scorpions (1978)• James Booker (1982) • Link Wray (1982) • Junior Wells (1983) • Tales Of Terror (1984) • Hugo Strasser und sein Tanzorchester (1978) • Lonnie Mack (as Hound Dog Man, with Stevie Ray Vaughan Man, 1985) • The Delmonas (1986) • Arthur Brown (1988) • Eric Clapton (1989) • Jeff Beck (1992) • Eddy Clearwater (1992) • Koko Taylor (1993) • T.Rex (released 1993) • Carl Perkins (1994) • Bryan Adams (1994) • Susan Tedeschi (1995) • Tom Jones (1999) • The Residents (2000) • Etta James (2000) • Status Quo (2002) • Sigue Sigue Sputnik (2002) • Robert Palmer (2003) • The Stray Cats (2004) • Macy Gray (2004) • James Taylor (2009)\n\nGET IT!\n\n(PW in comments)*\n\nMore Song Swarms\n\nThis month’s music deaths are listed in the actual month they left us. I wouldn’t be able to post the In Memoriam for May in the beginning of June, so I’ll cover the remaining deaths of May with those whom the Reaper will claim in June. But even without the stragglers, there are plenty of great stories to be told, involving a supporting cast as diverse as Bob Dylan, Albert Einstein and Walt Disney.\n\nI have debated with myself whether to include a write-up about punk legend and trailblazing producer Steve Albini. I’ve decided not to, in light of certain revelations about an aspect of his life. Of course, such a write-up would have generously noted his pioneering role in the hugely influential punk outfit Big Black, and his production of albums such as the Pixies’ Surfer Risa and Nirvana’s In Utero, though Albini saw himself as a facilitator rather than a producer. It would have noted his feats in record engineering, and his general iconoclasm and courageous integrity on many issues that gave him such a dedicated fan base. But then there are those revelations. So, having noted the above, I still feel unable to put up a photo of the man.\n\nThe Sax Legend\n\nIt is a bit unfair that David Sanborn, who has died at 79, is often written off as a smooth jazz merchant, because he was a serious jazz fusion musician — when he wasn’t making the kind of smooth jazz music that got a bad name for the dull non-excesses of the Kenny G types. But at his best, Sanborn made beautiful jazz, smooth or not. Take the featured song, Seduction, from his 1980 Hideway album. It’s not exactly free jazz, but it is a gorgeous tune, delivered well. Sanborn, it may be noted, himself didn’t like the concept of “smooth jazz”.\n\nSanborn became a name in fusion in the 1970s as a member of the Brecker Brothers band and with a series of solo albums and broke through in 1980 with Hideaway. By then, he had made his bones as a session man, having started out as a member of The Butterfield Blues Band.\n\nAs a session man, he played for — deep breath now — Stevie Wonder, James Brown (on Funky President), David Bowie (on the Young Americans album, including the title track), Bruce Springsteen (on Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out), The Rascals, B.B. King, Donny Hathaway, Todd Rundgren, Gil Evans, The Fabulous Rhinestones, O’Donel Levy (on Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky, which featured on the Me And Playboy mix), Miles Davis, Esther Phillips, Manhattan Transfer, James Taylor, Paul Simon, Michael Franks (including Monkey See-Monkey Do), Ron Carter, Hubert Laws, Bataan, Loudon Wainwright III, Cat Stevens, Elton John, Phoebe Snow, George Benson, Idris Muhammad, Maynard Ferguson, Bob James, Burt Bacharach, Alessi, Garland Jeffreys, Don McLean, Chaka Khan, JD Souther (on You’re Only Lonely), Linda Ronstadt, Carly Simon (on You Belong To Me), Dr John, Tim Curry (on I Do The Rock, which featured on A Life In Vinyl 1980), Nils Lofgren, John McLaughlin, Bonnie Raitt, Eagles, Steely Dan and many more…\n\nAnd that was just in the 1970s! Later, he played on tracks like Bill LaBounty’s wonderful Livin’ It Up (featured on Not Feeling Guilty Vol. 1), as well as for big hitters like Billy Joel, Aretha Franklin, The Rolling Stones, Kenny Loggins, The Bee Gees, Roger Waters, Bryan Ferry, Toto, Roberta Flack (on the lovely Oasis), Eric Clapton, Al Jarreau (on So Good, which featured on Any Major Soul 1988/89), Randy Crawford (on her superior version of Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door, which featured on Any Major Bob Dylan Songbook Vol. 3), and on the wonderful duets of Jarreau and Crawford on the Casino Lights album, which featured on mixes like Any Major Ashford & Simpson Songbook and Any Major Albums of 1982.\n\nThe Electric Light Keyboardist\n\nThe distinctive sound of the Electric Light Orchestra is usually attributed to Jeff Lynne, but its creation also owes much to Richard Tandy, who contributed group’s the characteristic keyboards and worked with Lynne to arrange the idiosyncratic strings in the studio recordings.\n\nTandy, who also played guitar, made his first contribution to a charting record through his old friend Bev Bevan, drummer of The Move, by contributing the harpsichord to the band’s UK #1 hit Blackberry Way. By 1970, The Move trio of Bevan, Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne, formed ELO as a side-project. After Wood decamped to form Wizzard, Tandy joined the band. With Lynne and Bevan, Tandy remained a constant member throughout the band’s hit-making career.\n\nBesides his own projects, Tandy also collaborated on various projects by Lynne.\n\nThe Disney Tunesmith\n\nSome of the finest songs from Disney films were written by the brothers Sherman. Now Richard M. Sherman has died at the age of 95, some 12 years after his long-estranged brother Robert. The sons of a well-known Tin Pan Alley songwriter are said to have produced more movie scores than any other songwriting team in history. Their scores and/or songs featured in films such as The Parent Trap, The Sword In The Stone, Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Bedknobs & Broomsticks, The Aristocats, Charlotte’s Web, The Slipper And The Rose, and more, as well ass many stage musical productions.\n\nThey won Oscars and Grammys for their Mary Poppins soundtrack, which included standards like A Spoonful Of Sugar, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, and Chim-Chim-Cheree, which won the Best Song Oscar. Their Sister Suffragette featured in the In Memoriam for January 2024 to mark the death of Glynis Johns. Apparently Feed The Birds was Walt Disney’s favourite song.\n\nBefore Disney, the Sherman brothers wrote pop hits such as Your Sixteen (Johnny Burnette, and later Ringo Starr) and Tall Paul (for Anette Funcicello). Their song It’s A Small World (After All), written for the 1964 World Fair in New York City, is reportedly the most publicly performed song of all time, by virtue of being played on rides in all Disney theme parks.\n\nBefore the songwriting, Richard Sherman was a US soldier in World Way II, and was among the first US troops to enter Dachau concentration camp.\n\nThe Hard Rock Pioneer\n\nWith the death of lead singer Doug Ingle, the classic line-up of Iron Butterfly is now gone (a sentence I have to write more often these days, as I will again twice a couple of entries down). Iron Butterfly were greatly influential on all hard rock music of the 1970s.\n\nTheir centre-piece was the interminable In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, which was written by Ingle in one night, while he was drunk on red wine. Drummer Ron Bushy wrote down the lyrics for Ingle to sing, but in his inebriated state, the singer slurred the words “in the Garden of Eden” as “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”. And thus one of rock’s more mystifying song titles was born.\n\nAfter Iron Butterfly split in 1971, Ingle had stints with the groups Stark Naked and Car Thieves, but he was no longer part of the Iron Butterfly when they reformed in 1974, or in subsequent reunions.\n\nThe Folk Influencer\n\nLast month we lost the last of The Limeliters in Alex Hassilev; this month the last of another influential folk trio passed away. “Spider” John Koerner was the leader, guitarist and a vocalist of the folk-blues trio Koerner, Ray & Glover.\n\nAs an 18-year-old in 1956, Koerner began to study aeronautical engineering but dropped that to make music. Instead he formed a folk band with Dave Ray and Tony Glover in Minneapolis, with whom the gifted songwriter became a pioneering figure in the folk born of the early 1960s. In Minneapolis, Koerner took a youngster under his wing who soon would make his mark in New York under the name of Bob Dylan. They sometimes performed as a duo, and Dylan remembered Koerner fondly in his autobiography.\n\nKoerner recorded three studio albums with Ray & Glover, as well as collaborations with others, and several solo sets. Folk experts rate Koerner’s influence on folk and guitar-playing highly, crediting him with being able to fuse folk and blues in an original way, rather than simply copying existing blues styles.\n\nThe Hit Drummer\n\nIn the mid-1940s, a man was stranded in a boat that had run out of gas. Luckily, a passing woman was able to help the hapless fellow to the shore, while he held her infant in his arms. The luckless sailor was Albert Einstein; the infant future rock drummer John Barbata.\n\nBarbata went on to have a bunch of hits as the drummer of The Turtles, including the classic Happy Together. The band was part of the Laurel Canyon scene (see Any Major Laurel Canyon), so when Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young fired drummer Dallas Taylor in 1970, Barbata was roped in. He played on eight of their albums, as well as on records by the individual members. Being with CSN&Y, Barbata turned down an offer to join the upcoming band Eagles.\n\nIn the interim, he joined Jefferson Airplane in 1972, and made the transition to Jefferson Starship. In between, he played sessions for the likes of Ry Cooder, JD Souther, John Sebastian, Judee Sill, The Everly Brothers, PF Sloan, Linda Ronstadt, Dave Mason, and (unreleased) Joni Mitchell.\n\nHis time with Jefferson Starship ended in 1978, when Barbata broke his neck, arm and jaw in 32 pieces in a car crash. With that, he retired from the music industry, though he still recorded and performed on the side.\n\nThe Machine Gun\n\nIn February we lost Wayne Kramer of the seminal proto-punk group MC5. Now drummer Dennis Thompson has died at 75 — which means that the classic MC5 line-up is now all gone.\n\nThompson, who joined the band in 1965, was known as “Machine Gun” for his ferocious drumming, which would come to influence the punk movement that followed in MC5’s trail, as well as metal drummers.\n\nThe Arranging Saxophonist\n\nHaving made his recording debut as a 22-year-old in 1949, jazz saxophonist Bill Holman’s career as a musician, composer and arranger spanned seven decades, during which he released his own albums and worked with some of the biggest names in jazz. And he arranged a number of pop hits as well.\n\nHis career as a sideman was most closely tied to Stan Kenton, but he also played with the likes of Chet Baker, Bud Shank, Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Tormé, Terry Gibbs, Maynard Ferguson, Art Pepper, Shorty Rogers, Buddy Bregman, and others.\n\nHe also arranged and/or composed for many of them, as well as for Count Basie, Gerry Mulligan, Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Louie Bellson, Sarah Vaughn, Anita O’Day, Peggy Lee, Carmen McRae, Buddy Rich, Zoot Sims, and others.\n\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, Holman also did arrangements, usually alongside Bones Howe and Bob Alcivar, for pop acts, especially several hits for The 5th Dimension, but also including the likes of The Monkees, The Association (Never My Love, Windy), The Sandpipers (Come Saturday Morning), and Seals & Croft. From the 1990s, he also arranged for Natalie Cole, Diane Schuur, Tony Bennett and Michael Bublé, among others.\n\nHolman was involved in many Grammy-winning recordings, though he was personally awarded “only” three, out of 16 nominations.\n\nThe Yodeller\n\nIn the pop interregnum between Elvis’ conscription and the rise of The Beatles, Frank Ifield was one of the biggest stars in the UK, with his trademark yodel which punctuated his easy listening country fare. He peaked in 1962/63, when in the space of a year he scored five consecutive Top 5 hits, four of them hitting #1 — I Remember You (also a US #5), Lovesick Blues, Wayward Wind, and Confessin’. He’d reach the Top 10 one more time in 1964; by 1966 his time on the charts was over, other than a novelty dance remix of his song She Taught Me How To Yodel, renamed The Yodeling Song, in 1991.\n\nBorn in England, his Australian family had returned home in 1948, when Frank was 11. He grew up on a farm, listening to hillbilly music, while milking cows. Having recorded as few minor hits in Australia, he moved to England in 1959, returning home only in 1986.\n\nThe Vocal Coach\n\nShe released only three studio albums, but her work was mostly behind the scenes. Peggi Blu was best-known as an award-winning vocal coach, most visibly on American Idol, and as the 1986 winner of the TV talent show Star Search.\n\nBlu did a lot of backing vocals for some big names, including Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Esther Phillips, Elkie Brooks, Stephanie Mills, The Weather Girls, Quincy Jones, Tracy Chapman (on Freedom Now), The Manhattans, Kylie Minogue, Leonard Cohen, Aaron Neville, Young M.C., among others. She also was one of several backing singers on the Irene Cara hit Fame, alongside Luther Vandross.\n\nBlu released three albums between 1980 and 2002. Her 1987 set Blu Blowin’ was a very good collection which merited greater success than it achieved.As always, this post is reproduced in illustrated PDF format in the package, which also includes my personal playlist of the featured tracks.

He has had a long career, and hasn’t always been the most universally admired singer. But for about ten years, between 1973 and 1983, he had a run of producing excellent songs (amid a few duds, take a bow of shame, Only The Good Die Young). I regard 1977’s The Stranger as a minor masterpiece, and Turnstiles (1976), 52nd Street (1978) and An Innocent Man (1983) are superb albums. The other two efforts were more patchy, though both had great moments, too.\n\nAnd his Songs In The Attic, released in 1981, is a perfect live album (though it is not a record of a single concert). According to the linernotes, Joel’s aim with the album was to recreate improved versions of songs which he thought had been inadequately produced on the studio albums. He succeeded in that aim on every song.\n\nAfter 1983 Joel still produced the odd gem (Baby Grand, his duet with Ray Charles was one of them), but the magic was gone. And then came the horrible We Didn’t Start The Fire, a hit so big that it came to define his career, at least in part. Even Billy Joel thinks the song is a pile of crap.\n\nStrangely, it seems difficult to cover Billy Joel, and few singers bothered to do so in the 1980s and ’90s. Some people have done so well, but good covers of his best-known songs are scarce. Look at the tracklisting and see what’s missing: The Stranger, My Life, It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me, You May Be Right, All For Leyna, Allentown, Pressure, Tell Her About It, Leave A Tender Moment Alone, An Innocent Man, And So It Goes, Baby Grand…\n\nSay Goodbye To Hollywood has been covered by Ronnie Spector and the E-Street Band (it featured on the Roy Bittan Collection). It’s an okay cover. Bette Midler in 1978 gave it a jaunty vibe, thus totally misreading the song. Either failed to make the cut here.\n\nAlso missing is Uptown Girl, which has been covered by many acts — including Westlife, who had a megahit with it — but by none I’ve heard did so well. I don’t mind that; it’s not a song I particularly like.\n\nPiano Man sneaks into the mix with a good Spanish version; I know of no particularly good English version. I thought maybe one of Billy Joel’s duets with Elton John on their live tours might do. They don’t.\n\nLikewise, Just The Way You Are tends to be covered in disagreeable easy listening mode. Barry White had a hit with a soulified cover of the song, but I don’t like his self-conscious vocals on it. Just The Way You Are would have failed to appear here too but for the saving grace that is Isaac Hayes. Of course, Ike turns it into a long jam with a long spoken intro.\n\nIndeed, the best interpretations here tend to be by soul acts. The Three Degrees take Stop In Nevada, a lesser known Billy Joel song from 1973’s Piano Man album, and turn it into a quite different number. Zhané turn the doo wop of The Longest Tine (from An Innocent Man) into a slow-burning ’90s R&B groove.\n\nThe Manhattans take all the fake gospel out of Everybody Has A Dream (originally on The Stranger) and show why it is really a soul song.\n\nMargie Joseph’s cover of She’s Got A Way — the earliest cover in this collection, from 1974 — starts off like a straight cover, but soon she makes it her own song. Produced by Arif Mardin, listen to the backing singers, who include Cissy Houston and fellow Sweet Inspirations Myrna Smith and Sylvia Shemwell, Gwen Guthrie and Judy Clay (who was also Shemwell’ sister). The drummer is Bernard Purdie (see the Bernard Collection Vol. 1 and Vol. 2); on guitar are Cornell Dupree and Hugh McCracken, and the distinct keyboards are by Richard Tee.\n\nAnother old-school soul singer appears here with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Billy Griffin succeeded Smokey Robinson as lead singer of The Miracles (it’s his lead on hit like Love Machine). He was also the co-producer of Take That’s debut album.\n\nThe Songbook ends with a song performed by the man himself, recorded live at Carnegie Hall on June 3, 1977. Souvenir, originally on 1974’s Streetlife Serenade, comes from a terrific live set released with 2008’s “legacy edition” of The Stranger.\n\nAnd my favourite Billy Joel song? Summer, Highland Falls — preferably the live version from Songs In The Attic.\n\nAs ever, the mix is timed to fit on a standard CD-R, and includes home-pressured covers and the text above in an illustrated PDF.
