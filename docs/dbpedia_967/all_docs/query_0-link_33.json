        "text": "GATEWAY is the seventh mini-album released by ASTRO. “Knock” was used as the promotional track. The album sold over 115,000 copies.\n\nReleased: May 4, 2020\n\n1. Knock (널 찾아가)\n\n2. When You Call My Name (내 이름을 부를 때)\n\n3. SOMEBODY LIKE\n\n4. We Still\n\n5. 12 Hours (12시간)\n\n6. Lights On (빛이 돼줄게)\n\nThe mini starts with its promotional track, much like the group’s last mini. Knock isn’t as boring as “BLUE FLAME”, but it is a continuation of the group’s more mainstream, generic sound. It has a darker quality to it, which lends itself well to the more emotional tinge of the melody, however it doesn’t necessarily hit the moments as strongly as I want it to. The verses are largely forgettable and while the chorus has a stronger hook, it is stunted by the music’s flattening quality. I don’t really like the messy and noisy quality of the arrangement. Not terrible, but not their best still.\n\nWhen You Call My Name is a total contrast to the intensity of the last song. While it still some of the EDM elements found in the last song, mostly in its chorus, the song is a return to the group’s cuter bubblegum pop sound. Unfortunately, the overall song just isn’t that strong. I feel like it would be better on the visual front, but the song itself just has forgettable verses and a clunky chorus that really lacks momentum.\n\nWith a bit more punch to it, SOMEBODY LIKE comes swinging in. I actually enjoy the verses to this song, but I don’t really find much appeal in the pre-chorus. The chorus is better though. It takes some more contemporary elements, but still brings a strong enough hook. It’s a bit off a weaker version of some of their funkier songs, but it’s a solid entry anyways.\n\nOpening with a piano, We Still isn’t much different from the last two songs, but it is the mini’s best song up to this point just because of its soaring chorus. I wish the chorus was catchier, but the general delivery is pretty solid. I also like that it isn’t really bogged down by its “title hook” like the other tracks on here. A sweeter song anyways.\n\nOf course as expected from most idol group mini albums, we get a slower tune. 12 Hours starts off sounding like it will be a ballad, but it eventually gains a bit of bounce and becomes a coffeehouse pop song. Of course, this one just goes over my head. It isn’t a bad song per se, just it isn’t my cup of tea and comes off rather forgettable. It does have some sweeter moments though.\n\nStarting with a calmer edge, Lights On soon blasts with its stomping arrangement and rap-powered verse. I want to like this song a lot more, but it sounds like a messier version of “Knock”. It has a hard-hitting, in-your-face arrangement, but falters in its chorus because the melody is just never able to settle onto the beat. It feels like these two areas don’t work totally in sync with one another and creates too much chaos.\n\nOverall: This is their weakest release to date for me. I wasn’t too interested in their last one, but at least it had a song here or there that really pulled me in. GATEWAY struggles to really find its moment for me. The songs for the most part just sound rather generic, but don’t make up for it in their quality. Instead, they are a bit overwhelmed by the many elements thrown in.\n\nC\n\nMagic is the fifth album released by Jolin Tsai. After the lacklustre performance of her last album, Jolin switched to Sony Music. The album proved immensely popular, with many of the songs performing amazingly on the charts and eventually becoming signature tracks. On the year-end HITFM Radio charts, “Say Love You”, “See My 72 Transformations” and “Prague Square” all peaked at #3, #24 and #65 respectively.\n\nReleased: March 6, 2003\n\n1. Say Love You (說愛你)\n\n2. See My 72 Transformations (看我72變)\n\n3. Fake Confession (假面的告白)\n\n4. Slave Ship (奴隸船)\n\n5. Prague Square (布拉格廣場)\n\n6. Be You for a Day (做一天的你)\n\n7. Prove It\n\n8. Smell of Popcorn (爆米花的味道)\n\n9. Rope on a Vest (馬甲上的繩索)\n\n10. Good Thing (好東西)\n\n11. Spirit of the Knight (騎士精神)\n\nThe album starts with a signature Jolin song, written by Jay Chou. Say Love You is a pretty cute pop track, but has some really great moments throughout. The verses open slowly before swinging into a quickly sung section that ups the energy. The pre-chorus returns to that laid back pace, but soon gets into the catchy chorus. The melody doesn’t have one hard-hitting hook, but it spreads some soft hooks throughout, keeping the song interesting. This is all done over a light pop/rock arrangement with some bubblegum pop flare. It’s not in-your-face, but relaxed and quite catchy.\n\nWhere things really pick up is with See My 72 Transformations. While Jolin had dance tracks before, this is her first one that really took off. It’s the catchiest song on the album, but probably the cheesiest. It features some aggressive and odd vocal additions tied with some strange synths, however, this over-the-top edge helps to make the song fun. Powered by a rocking guitar riff, the chorus is especially strong stellar and the hooks never let down.\n\nThe sudden switch into Fake Confession is a bit of an odd one since it’s a pretty dramatic sounding ballad. The verses are pretty dull though as the melody just drags along and Jolin’s sweet vocals don’t have enough pull to really keep this part engaging. The chorus is a bit better, bringing a bit more tension into the melody. Unfortunately, the song only gets interesting 2/3’s into the song when the arrangement changes up, bringing a more intense quality. Not bad, but not particularly strong either.\n\nDespite its name, Slave Ship is yet another ballad. I actually prefer this one to the last one because it reminds me more of the C-Pop ballads from the 90’s with their eerie synths. Unfortunately, this song isn’t that strong either. I like soft ballads, but Jolin’s voice just isn’t dynamic enough for me to really get captured in the feeling of the song.\n\nI’m thankful we are finally out of the ballad territory because the second of the Jay Chou songs is one of the album’s highlights and features him. Prague Square brings an eerie quality, while mixing pop and hip-hop into one. The verses are mostly filled with rapping, but the energy ties in nicely with the European edge of the music. The chorus is where Jolin comes in, with a dragged out and slithering melody. It’s not particularly catchy, but the general vibe of the song is really fun to get into.\n\nI’m not sure if I could take another ballad. Be You for a Day is the best of the ballads up to this point though. It has the same weaknesses, opening with a more drawn out and soft delivery that doesn’t do much for me. The chorus has a better melody though and it lends itself well to the more rock ballad backing the song gets in its second half. It’s not particularly impressive, but a decent tune.\n\nFinally getting an upbeat tune, Prove It is a disappointment. The song tries to be a hard hitting dance/R&B tune, but it just feels messy on all fronts. The song has a clunky beat that just doesn’t do the music justice, while the melody tries to be cool but ends up being just as clunky. The hooks are weak and Jolin’s voice just doesn’t carry enough power to carry the song as her adlibs are messy.\n\nI much prefer Smell of Popcorn, which comes with disco-inspired track with some 90’s house elements to keep in a bit more contemporary. It’s not the strongest on the hooks, but I really love the overall sound and vibe of the song even if it sounds a bit outdated for even 2003. The flashy synths tied with the steady beat help to keep the energy flowing. Jolin’s voice also works much better here, floating over the slick arrangement.\n\nThe album’s final ballad comes in the form of Rope on a Vest. A darker tinged track, the song has a more dynamic quality and is reminiscent of “Fake Confession”s more emotional sound, but taking on a music box and classical quality. I really like the song’s more forward pulling energy, but the song just doesn’t work with Jolin’s voice.\n\nI don’t mind Good Thing, even if it is a bit of a generic, happy pop song. It at least works with Jolin’s voice more and it isn’t offensive in anyway. The 90’s bubblegum pop beat is a bit outdated and feels more suited for her first four albums though. It’s the kind of song that isn’t bad, but won’t have a lasting impact in the long run.\n\nThe last song on the album is the Jay-penned Spirit of the Knight. It follows a more mythical hip-hop sound, opting for something similar to “Prague Square”. This time we don’t have Jay and instead get Jolin rapping. It’s actually a really cool thing to hear and she isn’t too bad at it either. I’m not the biggest fan of the pre-chorus, but the rest of the song is pretty strong.\n\nOverall: This is a decent album, but a bit of a disappointment. As the singles from the album are pretty strong for the most part, I was expecting something a bit stronger overall. It’s not bad though, but it certainly has its fair share of weaker tracks that I don’t like. The ballads in particular were a bit of a blur and hard to get through and “Prove It” is just terrible. Luckily, the Jay-penned tracks were all strong and there were some tracks that stand out. This is still her strongest album up to this point.\n\nB\n\nThe Only is the third mini-album released by THE BOYZ. “No Air” was used as the promotional track. The mini-album showcased a huge jump in sales, selling over 146,000 copies.\n\nReleased: November 29, 2018\n\n1. Breath to Breath\n\n2. No Air\n\n3. Only ONE\n\n4. Lucid Dream (자각몽)\n\n5. 36.5° (Melting Heart)\n\n6. 4EVER\n\nOpening with a strange intro, Breath to Breath is alright. It starts with a lighter feel before bringing in a blast of synths. After, things move into No Air, the main promotional track. I would say it’s the group’s most contemporary and mainstream sounding promo track up to this point, bringing in some strong Billboard Top 100 elements into it. It features a drop instead of a fleshed out chorus, but it isn’t so bad. I just wish it tried to push harder since the music it isn’t the most exciting I’ve heard before. The verses are strong, but lack a distinct quality that helps them stand out as well. A decent enough song though.\n\nGetting into Only ONE, this is another mainstream sounding song, but I think it has the same feel as the last song. Some things it does better like the energized melody, but it falters on the drop and leaves little long lasting impact. It’s not a bad song though, but lacking something that stands out in the long run.\n\nBringing something a bit more mid-tempo, Lucid Dream is decent enough with its bouncy piano and beat. I like that we finally get a more fleshed out chorus here and its falsetto delivery works with the mood of the song, but I never feel totally invested in these kinds of songs with their coffee house vibes. It has a bit more push to it that helps keep it more interesting than most though.\n\nThe last song at least had some energy to it, but 36.5° (Melting Heart) is on the slower side of things, which just makes it almost painfully dull. The beat is lethargic and has no pace to it and makes the whole song just drag along. The rap is the most interesting part, but even that doesn’t save the song. I do like the song’s jazzier moments, but the melody doesn’t quite fit.\n\nWhile I like 4EVER a bit more than the last song since its EDM elements help to bring some more energized moments, the song suffers the same problem as the last one. The beat is just too slow and lethargic, really dragging out the sound. Everything would have been better if it was paced a bit faster.\n\nOverall: This was a pretty disappointing mini-album for me, especially since their last release was really great. The songs are all pretty mainstream, but they lack some really long lasting elements. The slower songs are especially boring and among their most dull B-sides.\n\nC+\n\n30. DRIPPIN – Nostalgia [Boyager]\n\nOne of the most exciting debuts of the year, Woollim’s newest boy band came out with a great tune. Nostalgia does take some more nostlagic elements of prior boy bands with its explosive EXO-like chorus but still keeps it up-to-date in its slick choruses.\n\n29. SuperM – One (Monster & Infinity) [Super One]\n\nI genuinely enjoyed “Jopping” from 2019, but I was baffled with One (Monster & Infinity) at first. Combining two songs into one is a fun idea, but I find the verses to be a bit bare. The magic really happens in its commanding chorus, where the harmonies are fleshed out and really bring out the magic of the melody.\n\n28. OH MY GIRL – Nonstop (살짝 설렜어) [NONSTOP]\n\nI was really happy to see that OH MY GIRL had such a great year, although I was initially disappointed with the change in sound they made. Still, Nonstop really grew on me. It’s tropical house elements are a bit 2017, but its happy and vibrant energy is what carries the song. It’s catchy, joyful and was much needed for 2020.\n\n27. Sunmi – pporappippam (보라빛 밤) [pporappippam]\n\nSunmi’s music seems so cohesive but still retains enough differences in each individual song that it helps to really flourish her sound. pporappippam feels like a combination of “Siren” and “Heroine”, powered by its chugging guitar and retro synths. It’s totally Sunmi.\n\n26. KEEMBO – Scandalous [Scandalous]\n\nOne of the most underrated acts of 2020, KEEMBO is a duo comprising of former SPICA members. Both known for the vocal abilities, it sounds like the perfect combination, especially considering they are backed by Sweetune. Scandalous is their most uptempo offering, hitting it with the flashy synths, but still bringing an almost indie vibe.\n\n25. MAMAMOO – WANNA BE MYSELF [WANNA BE MYSELF]\n\nFor some reason, my favourite songs from MAMAMOO every year seem to be their extra releases. WANNA BE MYSELF stands out because of its disco-inspired backdrop. Packing some dramatic strings, light synths and groovy bass, the song’s melody pushes and pulls in the right places.\n\n24. ITZY – WANNABE [IT’z ME]\n\nOne of the biggest 4th generation groups, ITZY continued their bratty pop sound with WANNABE. The verses power along, bringing some fun transitions that really showcase the group’s style. However, the chorus hits hard on the more melodic side of things, recalling what made “Dalla Dalla” so great.\n\n23. Younha – Dark Cloud (먹구름) [UNSTABLE MINDSET]\n\nReleased right at the beginning of 2020, Dark Cloud was overshadowed by its B-side, “Winter Flower”, which featured BTS member RM. I much prefer Dark Cloud because it feels totally in line with Younha’s sound. An emotion pop/rock ballad that showcases her vocals, this song only progressively more and more powerful.\n\n22. ATEEZ – Answer [TREASURE EPILOGUE : Action To Answer]\n\nATEEZ has yet to become a group I stan, but I still look out for their releases. Answer especially grew on me a lot. Although I already enjoyed it when it was released, the song’s soaring chorus is just so easy to get wrapped into. Tied with the boy band’s usual hard-hitting raps, the song goes full out.\n\n21. IZ*ONE – Fiesta [BLOOM*IZ]\n\nWith IZ*ONE releasing so many different songs for 2020, it was Fiesta that has still remained my favourite of the year’s releases. Starting off in a classic and elegant style, the song gradually opens up, heightening in speed and intensity before launching into its slick chorus. It’s not the catchiest melody, but the overall package is exhilarating.\n\nLet me… is the first mini-album released by Sowelu. There were two versions released, each with a special song as track #4. The mini peaked at #37 on the charts and sold over 4,000 copies.\n\nReleased: August 24, 2011\n\n1. I want U to…\n\n2. Let ME Lead U\n\n3. WOMAN\n\n4. Diamond / One more kiss\n\n5. Endless Summer\n\n6. Kimi no Inai Sekai (君のいない世界; A World Without You)\n\nThe mini opens with I want U to…, which is a pop/EDM song that is pretty standard for this time. I can’t say it’s all that great as it sounds a bit outdated at this point and doesn’t really have any strikingly redeeming factors. It’s definitely a change up from Sowelu’s usual R&B sound and she has only done this style a few times in the past. I just wish it was more interesting as the best part of the song is the guest rapper. It’s just lackluster.\n\nI much prefer Let ME Lead U, which still retains a powering pop sound and sounds more like a Lady Gaga track. It’s stomping beat and sensual vocals sound more like an evolution of Sowelu’s music than the last track. With that said, the overall delivery is just subpar. Only the chorus has a strong opening melody line, while everything else that surrounds it is just treading water. A solid track, but nothing particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe first slow song comes in the form of WOMAN, but even then it takes a more mid-tempo, acoustic approach. I think it’s a nice change up and it’s a good song to really hear Sowelu’s voice. The verses are unfortunately quite dull, but the pre-chorus does help to bring a bit more life to things. The chorus isn’t bad, but it’s just odd. The English is an interesting choice, but the melody just doesn’t put hard enough.\n\nThe first of the special tracks is Diamond, which follows similarly in sound to “Let ME Lead U”. Unfortunately, this one is more drab. It has a commanding sound to it, but it just doesn’t hit it on the melody. Everything just comes off particularly flat and doesn’t feel that polished. Just another flat track for me.\n\nThe second of the special tracks is One more kiss, which is a light-hearted pop/R&B track. Up to this point, it’s the strongest of the tracks just because it has a more fleshed out arrangement and a decent melody. The verses a bit dull, but the song does flow quite nicely in the chorus. I do wish the melody didn’t have Sowelu singing in falsetto though as it sounds a bit off on the higher notes. Still, this is a solid track.\n\nEndless Summer is probably the first song I actually like. It has a summery pop sound, but still fits with the rest of the mini due to its usage of synths. The verses are cute, but the song definitely gets its energy in the chorus. The hook is quite catchy and it works with the flashy synths. I only wish the song took it a step up and really hit it harder here because it could really push that energy harder.\n\nEnding things off is Kimi no Inai Sekai, which is the only full-fledged ballad, albeit with some light R&B elements. Unfortunately, it just isn’t that interesting in general. The verses are boring, lacking any vitalization in its arrangement. The chorus also suffers from this as the melody relies on a weak beat and just droplets of synths. I’m sure this would have been better with a stronger accompaniment.\n\nOverall: This is a pretty weak release for me and her worse since her third album. I can say that part of it is the uptempo tracks just sound outdated, employing the late 00’s and early 10’s dance/pop elements, while the slower songs were boring. Maybe more R&B would’ve been better.\n\nC\n\nBreaking Sensation is the second mini-album released by SF9. “Easy Love” was used as the promotional track. The mini sold over 28,000 copies, being their lowest selling to date.\n\nReleased: April 18, 2017\n\n1. Intro; Around Farewell (Intro; 이별 즈음에)\n\n2. Easy Love (쉽다)\n\n3. Watch Out\n\n4. Hide and Seek (머리카락 보일라)\n\n5. Fall Down (이러다가 울겠어)\n\n6. Why (왜 이래)\n\nIntro; Around Farewell starts things off with a hip-hop inspired opener. Not really my cup of tea and I feel it doesn’t quite flow well into the next track all that well, but it does have some energy and hype to it.\n\nEasy Love is easily one of my favourite tracks from SF9. The song is a change up from their more hip-hop inspired and high energy promo tracks and brings something more streamlined and pop. The verses are solid enough, bringing some more emotionally tinged vocals and rapping before gradually heightening in intensity and power. The chorus is the true highlight, hitting it hard with its melodic hooks while also interchanging the energy with some of the chant-like lines. It’s a great song.\n\nThat hip-hop inspired sound returns in full force with Watch Out, which is especially evident in its beat and over-the-top style. My favourite part of the song is actually the softer points where the song takes a rest and focuses more on the vocals than the energy. It’s not a bad song overall though and there is a lot of silliness to keep the other parts interesting. I could actually see this as a promoted track even if it’s not my cup of tea.\n\nI like the uptempo and light R&B style of Hide and Seek a bit more. The song really treads along with its funky beat and piano-focused arrangement. The song feels a bit left field for the group, but its bright edge really stands out. The rap-line is also able to inject their own power into the song without the song suffering from transitions or a halt of energy. It’s not the catchiest tune and yet it has a fun energy to it.\n\nAnd yet another change up in sound, Fall Down doesn’t quite have the same uptempo energy the last three songs had and always feels on the edge of uptempo and midtempo. With that said, it’s a solid track. Its slinky R&B style works well with highlighting the guys’ vocals and the melody just slithers along the arrangement’s mid-00’s vibe.\n\nOf course things would end with a slower tune. Why is your usual light-pop/R&B sound that feels fitting for a coffeehouse. Despite R&B being my favourite genre, these kinds of songs can be hit or miss. This isn’t a bad example of this style, but it just doesn’t do all that much for me. It has a nice beat and a few strong moments like in its bridge, but it is just lacking in a stand out hook.\n\nOverall: This is another great mini from SF9. There was a lot of variety in sound on this mini, which I wasn’t expecting. Despite the last song not being all that strong, the rest of the mini is really solid and “Easy Love” still remains one of their best promo tracks.\n\nA\n\nAct.2 Narcissus is the second mini-album released by gugudan. “A Girl Like Me” was used as the promotional track and the release brought an image and sound change. the mini sold over 29,000 copies, being their best selling release.\n\nReleased: February 27, 2017\n\n1. Rainbow\n\n2. A Girl Like Me (나 같은 애)\n\n3. Hate You (미워지려 해)\n\n4. One Step Closer (거리)\n\n5. Make a Wish (소원들어주기)\n\n6. A Girl Like Me (inst.)\n\nRainbow brings some change with this bright, stomping number. It has some retro vibes in its arrangement and reminds me of some of CLC’s older material since it has a really poppy edge to it as well. I feel like it has a lot of potential as with a stronger melody it would hit it out of the park. It’s a fun tune and a solid opener anyways.\n\nThen things swing right into A Girl Like Me, a total departure from the cuter, mystical edge of “Wonderland”. Instead, we get a stomping pop tune, that pulls and pushes with its verses before bringing in a commanding chorus. The sung hooks aren’t the catchiest but work wonderfully when tied with the sassy-driven spoken lines. It just feels so fleshed, especially tied with the funky arrangement.\n\nCan’t say I’m totally into Hate You though. It goes for a bratty pop sound that is also reminiscent of that cuter-pop driven sound of the mid-10’s. This one tries to change things up a bit by bringing some more odd transitions, like for its rap, dance break and most notably when it goes into its chorus. I just wish the song was more interesting in general because despite all these fun factors, the melody is lacking.\n\nI much prefer the laidback, R&B vibes of One Step Closer. It sounds like your usual light pop/R&B coffeehouse style, but at least the arrangement has a steady beat that doesn’t get too sleepy and the synths help to bring a bit more colour to the music in the chorus. The melody isn’t particularly catchy, but the general vibe is quite enjoyable.\n\nMake a Wish is the mini’s ballad and it goes for a softer sound. Unfortunately, the verses of this song are just boring. Very little stands out. The chorus is a bit better as the percussion comes in and the harmonies help to fill out the vocal performance. However, the song only becomes interesting in its second half when the music really takes a step up.\n\nOverall: This mini isn’t as strong their debut one despite the better promo track. The first two tracks are good, but the mini falters on the other three album tracks. They just don’t interest me all that much unfortunately.\n\nB\n\n40. NATURE – Girls (어린애) [NATURE WORLD: CODE M]\n\nOne of the stranger releases of 2020, NATURE came back with something completely different to their last year’s strange tune. Girls for a darker and more haunting quality, employing straight-laced vocals and piercing synths to deliver a pounding tune that has continuously brought me back.\n\n39. LOONA – So What [[#]]\n\nThe first of two LOONA songs, So What brought a change from the more ethereal “Butterfly” of 2019. Instead, we get a hard hitting and rather messy tune that sees the song bouncing all over the place. It always feels as though it is building into something before crashing into its gorgeous bridge.\n\n38. VERIVERY – Lay Back [FACE ME]\n\nI was hoping for VERIVERY to continue their new-jack-swing influenced music into 2020, but instead the group started the year with this funk-inspired tune. That’s not horrible too since I love the beat and it is still stronger than the two promo songs after. Lay Back‘s stomping beat and sharp vocals help to mature the group’s sound while still retaining a strong melody.\n\n37. YooA – Bon voyage (숲의 아이) [Bon Voyage]\n\nWith OH MY GIRL’s gradual rise as a top girl group, 2020 also saw the group’s first major solo release (albeit somewhat controversial). Bon voyage isn’t what I was expecting from YooA, bringing a more euphoric and dreamy quality. It doesn’t have a charged chorus, focusing on its steady beat and gorgeous layered synths and vocals.\n\n36. Cosmic Girls – BUTTERFLY [Neverland]\n\nWhile Cosmic Girls’ full output in 2020 was a bit weak in comparison to the last few years, BUTTERFLY brings a lighter vibe to the group’s sound. It doesn’t really have that ethereal, cosmic quality that has been a staple in their sound, but goes full on in its swirling synths and simple hooks.\n\n35. ONEUS – A Song Written Easily [IN ITS TIME]\n\nWhen I first heard this song, I wasn’t really expecting much and felt it was a bit dated due to its tropical-house backing. With that said, I’ve really grown to enjoy A Song Written Easily. The song takes on a more emotional tinge and the boys’ really put the right amount of emotion into it. The melody is no slouch either and despite the song going into a drop, I feel like it matches the intensity the song is trying to bring.\n\n34. Rocket Punch – BOUNCY [RED PUNCH]\n\nRocket Punch had a more active year in 2020. While I didn’t really enjoy “JUICY” all that much, BOUNCY is an absolute juggernaut of a song that never lets down. It’s over-the-top melody and theatrics are supported by its boisterous arrangement. It’s a hot mess, but the perfect kind.\n\n33. LOONA – Why Not? [[12:00]]\n\nA bit more polarizing in its sound, Why Not? is another strange tune from the group. Opening with its rap-focused verse before building tension in its pre-chorus, the song then launches into its drop-focused chorus. Despite it being a bit odd, the song goes for a light-hearted and fun vibe that keeps it engaging and unpredictable.\n\n32. A.C.E – Stand by you (편지를 써) [Stand by you]\n\nA.C.E hasn’t really released all that many ballads, but the true stand out in their discography is this calming, emotional number. The verses are pretty gentle, not really employing much music nor vocal display. Instead, all the magic happens in Stand by you‘s pop/rock backed arrangement which highlights the gorgeous melody.\n\n31. TWICE – CRY FOR ME [CRY FOR ME]\n\nDespite not having a music video, CRY FOR ME was a promoted song in the final month of 2020. Unlike the strange “MORE & MORE” nor the exhilarating “I CAN’T STOP ME”, this tune takes a darker approach, lurching back and forth with its strange beat and piercing melody. Its hooks are easy to sink in, allowing the girls to showcase a different side of their sound."
