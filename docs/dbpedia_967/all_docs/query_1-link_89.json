        "text": "Image via Complex Original\n\nUmi\n\nIf you like: Mereba, Emotional Oranges\n\nListen to these songs first: “Remember Me,” “say im ur luv”\n\n“Remember Me” begins with the chilling and commanding voice of Boris Karloff in 1963’s The Terror. The tenderness of love, and the terror often attached to its fleeting nature, is beautifully captured on the track. It succeeds at its mission, a memorable foundation indeed. Years later, Umi’s mighty introduction in 2018 remains a fresh listen every time. In 2022, the 23-year-old released her first full project, Forest in the City—a solid collection that felt like self-realization on wax. Songs like “wish that i could” explore love in hiding, which the video later attributes to queer identity depicted in sweet freedom. Even if you aren’t familiar with the name yet, it’s highly probable you’ve heard her voice. UMI is just getting started and feels poised for greatness. —Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nCoco Jones\n\nFor fans of: Jazmine Sullivan\n\nListen to these songs first: “ICU,” “Caliber,” “Crazy For Me”\n\nCoco Jones has come a long way from Disney channel movies and childhood stardom. The 25-year-old singer’s voice sounds like something from the 1980s, a beautiful fusion of modern neo-soul and blues dancing with each other over soothing instrumentation. Her 2022 track “ICU” is a reflection of that; on the track, Jones works between alto and mezzo-soprano, touching the lower octaves on the song’s bridge while still able to reach high notes on the hook. Jones’ vocal range is exemplified on her latest EP, What I Didn’t Tell You, and demonstrates all of the different notes the singer can hit. While Jones is still acting, playing Hilary Banks on Peacock’s Bel-Air, her skills behind the mic deserve the same attention as her talent in front of the camera. —Jordan Rose\n\nFLO\n\nFor fans of: 3LW, Dream\n\nListen to these songs first “Cardboard Box,” “Immature”\n\nGirl groups are making a comeback. In 2019, British girl group FLO formed and signed a deal with Island Records. The group, consisting of Jorja Douglas, Stella Quaresma, and Renée Downer, broke through in 2022 with their single “Cardboard Box,” a catchy tune that flexed their affinity for sharp and compatible harmonies. The song, which was also a big hit on TikTok, was included on their debut project The Lead, alongside other bubbling singles like “Immature.” Since then, the trio’s popularity has only continued to rise; they won the Brit Award for Rising Star this year and are gearing up to embark on a North American tour in March. These girls are already proving they are unstoppable. —Jessica McKinney\n\nDestin Conrad\n\nFor Fans of: Kehlani, Frank Ocean\n\nListen to these songs first: “Unpredictable,” “On 10,” “In The Air”\n\nThe warm breeze of Tampa air flows through Destin Conrad’s music as the Florida-born, LA-based singer has been steadily paving a lane for himself in R&B since 2019. Like his mentor, Kehlani, Conrad can make even the most bitter of emotions sound smooth. “Left no room to guarantee so I fantasize/Replayed a moment in my head every night/Don’t feel like how I felt before, what you do to me?” he sings in “On 10.” With some tracks reminiscent of Frank Ocean’s Nostalgia, Ultra era, like his song “Unpredictable” featuring Kiana Ledé, Conrad closed out 2022 on a high note with his impressive project, Satin. The project sounds like it has dance music inspirations mixed with traditional R&B—a space Conrad thrives in. —Jordan Rose\n\nIdman\n\nIf you like: Serpentwithfeet, Miguel\n\nListen to these songs first: “Hate,” “Look At What I’m Doing To You”\n\nIdman exists as a new-age R&B renegade. Blissfully ironic across her releases, she’s able to address societal topics in songs like “Look At What I’m Doing To You” which, beyond its enchanting composition, depicts the Black and Brown experience and the strength in the Somali diaspora. Her sometimes melancholic tone reflects a yearning for more, whether in a relationship or in humanity. It heightens her artistic proposition, aptly articulating the severity of the topics she touches on. Her aesthetic reflects a sense of playfulness with her concepts as she takes an avant-garde approach to her music videos. Consistent in both her musical and visual output, Idman has all the makings of a generational R&B talent. —Nicolas-Tyrell Scott\n\nJordan Ward\n\nFor Fans of: Smino\n\nListen to these songs first: “Cherimoya,” “White Crocs,” “Lil Baby Crush”\n\nThe best kind of music takes you on a trip through the vehicle of an artist’s voice, and Jordan Ward makes it feel like you’re driving extra slow through a familiar place as he describes every detail of your surroundings. That journey is taken on a few of his songs, but on none more so than the recently released “Cherimoya” off his upcoming album Forward. The St. Louis native’s storytelling ability has also helped him cross paths with fellow wordsmiths Smino and JID, who he will be opening for through February and March on their tour. Bringing words to life through music is a special talent, which is why you should be paying attention to Ward. —Jordan Rose\n\nOjerime\n\nFor fans of: SZA, Summer Walker\n\nListen to these songs first: “Give It Up 2 Me” “Keep It Lo”\n\nSouth London singer Ojerime is another one making moves in the R&B space. Her sound is an ode to the seductiveness of ‘90s R&B, but she stays connected to her British roots by making her accent shine through in every song. In March 2020, she dropped her debut mixtape, B4 I Breakdown, which describes her experience with depression and other mental health issues. Some of her best songs such as “Give It Up 2 Me,” “Alarming,” and “Keep It Lo,” are equally cathartic and boast her laid-back energy on wax. —Jessica McKinney\n\nKenyon Dixon\n\nFor fans of: Frank Ocean, SiR\n\nListen to these songs first: “Switch,” “Get High, Get By”\n\nKenyon Dixon has been around for a while, dropping projects in 2015 and 2017, but the Watts, California native broke through in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the world was at a standstill. During the “shelter in place” policy, Dixon curated a weekly concert series called “Friday Night Live” on YouTube, which garnered attention from both fans and R&B legends like Brandy. The same year, the singer capitalized on the attention by releasing “Switch,” a soulful single anchored by piano keys. Over the last year, Dixon has continued to establish himself as a standout voice in the space, dropping his 2022 project Closer. The project, which features the standout tracks, “Marvin Gaye,” “Here,” and “Get High, Get By,” boasts Dixon’s melodic flows and soulful vocal range. He clearly draws inspiration from other legends before him while still honoring his own creativity. —Jessica McKinney\n\nTempest\n\nIf you like: SZA, Ambré\n\nListen to these songs first: “So Gone,” “Young Playa Footage,” “Lemon Pepper Wet”\n\nCalifornia-based Tempest invites listeners into her most intimate thoughts with her heart on her sleeve. Like many of Tempest’s songs, “Young Playa Footage,” an early release from the singer, is apt in its vulnerability. Beyond the age-old focus on heartbreak and relationships is a bluntness that traverses across releases such as “Agua” and “Lemon Pepper Wet.” With a rich, distinct tone, the artist shrugs off every emotion and insight, and bathes in her revelations, owning them—flaws and all. That detail makes her releases to date authentic and able to translate to a new generation that can see through the gimmicks. Sonically, Tempest exists in a whimsically led brand of R&B, her productions feeling playful and boundless adding a cathartic dynamic to her discography. —Nicolas-Tyrell Scott\n\nEbony Riley\n\nFor fans of:\n\nListen to these songs first: “Deuce Deuce,” “Draws,” “Why”\n\nOne of Interscope Records’ latest signees, Ebony Riley already has the confidence and passion of a seasoned veteran. The singer recently released her debut self-titled EP at the top of 2023, and it already shows promise, from her commanding attention on the project’s intro, “Open,” to spinning a sample of “Love Come Down” with ease on “Draws.” Riley was even able to hold her own with vocal heavyweight James Fauntleroy on their song “Why.” These bold decisions on her first and only publicly released project thus far show how much Riley believes in herself and that self-assuredness becomes contagious in her music. —Jordan Rose\n\nLaya\n\nFor Fans of: Doja Cat, Doechii\n\nListen to these songs first: “Sock It 2 Me,” “Crazy Down,” “Sailor Moon”\n\nR&B does not need to have a specific look or sound, especially in 2023 as genres continue to melt into others, and Laya represents all of the places rhythm and blues could go in this new decade. The Staten Island singer’s bag is deep, and she can touch classic R&B sounds on tracks like “Crazy Down” while tapping into more upbeat energy on other records like “Sock It 2 Me.” Laya taps into the same left-of-center aesthetics as Doja Cat or Doechii, but she adds her own flair to her visuals to make her unique. The real testament to Laya’s abilities is how her vocals always carry her, regardless of what the production is behind them. It just sounds like Laya is always having fun, which makes her music even more enjoyable. —Jordan Rose\n\nRosemarie\n\nIf you like: Kehlani, Mahalia\n\nListen to these songs first: “Crossed,” “Vision”\n\nAs Rosemarie has grown as an artist since 2018, the graceful aspects of her voice have become more pronounced, quickly igniting a hypnotic appeal to listeners worldwide. Packed with modern colloquialisms, Rosemarie is blunt and wistful, reminiscent of singers like Mary J. Blige and Kehlani. Often, piano-laced songs like “Henny Talk” cut through the often formulaic approach to modern R&B songs. Rosemarie not only documents her lack of consistency in relationships and flawed perception of self at times, she also uses these experiences to hold herself accountable. “Confessional” is a strong example of her ability to take ownership whilst using the booth to heal in real time. —Nicolas-Tyrell Scott\n\nRini\n\nIf you like: SiR, Omar Apollo\n\nListen to these songs first: “Red Lights,” “Out of the Blue”\n\nRini is smooth and comfortable in his artistic skin. Consistent in delivery, he doesn’t color too much outside of his comfort zone, but sometimes that’s fine when the lines you live within draw out a star. The Filipino-Australian artist knows what he does well—as he sings on unexpected love and intimacy in ballad form, it feels directed toward you and you alone. He has been continually ascending for years now but still has room left to grow in recognition. At the end of last year, he released his sophomore album and went on a US tour to solidify himself as a star on the rise with Constellations. It included standouts like “Red Lights” with Wale and “Over Some Wine” with a fellow artist to watch Maeta. —Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nIyla\n\nFor fans of: Snoh Aalegra\n\nListen to these songs first: “Lost Me” “Impala”\n\nLos Angeles native Iyla popped up on the scene about four years ago, and since then she has been putting in the work and pumping out some of the sweetest-sounding music. Her honey-drenched vocals on songs like “Bad Side” and “Flowers” will easily persuade listeners to check out more of her catalog. Not to mention, Iyla has consistently created avant-garde music videos to accompany her singles, which have garner more than a few million views on YouTube in years past. What makes Iyla stand out the most besides her porcelain skin or red hair is her affinity for working with some of the most veteran artists in the hip-hop community, including Method Man on “Cash Rules” and Benny the Butcher on “Lost Me.” It won’t be long before Iyla becomes every rapper’s go-to vocalist for their choruses. —Jessica McKinney\n\nThuy\n\nFor fans of: Kehlani, Jhene Aiko\n\nListen to these songs first: “U Should Feel Special,” “Girls Like Me Don’t Cry,” “In My Head”\n\nThuy’s storytelling abilities and buttery vocals are in perfect union with one another. The Bay area singer wears her emotions on her sleeve and flaunts them with pride on her records, most notably on the title track for her latest project, Girls Like Me Don’t Cry. In it, she doesn’t shy away from singing about her sorrow, but she also highlights how she’s grown from her lowest moments. Thuy has come a long way since her SoundCloud days in 2015. Even back then, her songs are relatable because she’s not afraid to feel her emotions fully, and that bravery radiates through her lush voice. Thuy put in the emotional and vocal growth to reach this point, and it feels like she’s just getting started. —Jordan Rose\n\nMaeta\n\nIf you like: Ambré, Victoria Monet\n\nListen to these songs first: “Toxic,” “Bitch Don’t Be Mad,” “Teen Scene”\n\nSigned to Roc Nation in 2021 and aided by the likes of Pharrell, Maeta is poised for greatness if for none other than the star power behind the aforementioned entities alone, then for the sheer power that bounces off speakers that play her tunes. She’s covered a lot of ground already, clearly not looking to be confined, having worked on collaborations with everyone from Thundercat and Vic Mensa to Buddy. The Indiana native’s 2021 release, Habits, feels like a tease, clocking in at under half an hour. But the singer’s next EP is expected to release soon and will likely solidify her as one to bet on in the space. —Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nTone Stith\n\nFor fans of: Chris Brown, Ty Dolla $ign\n\nListen to these songs first: “FWM,” “Do I Ever,” “Take It There”\n\nHailing from New Jersey, Tone Stith began his career as a successful songwriter, penning hits like 2015’s “Liquor” and “Make Love” for Chris Brown. After finding success as a songwriter, Stith began pursuing his own singing career, appearing on songs for independent artists like Von. In 2017, he then released his debut album, Can We Talk, including standout songs like “Oh My Gosh” and “Get It Right” which blended his smooth vocals with hip-hop-influenced beats. Over the last three years, Tone Stith has released consistent bodies of work that feature some of the biggest artists in rap and R&B, including Quavo (“Take It There”), Chris Brown (“Do I Ever”), and H.E.R. (“When You Love Someone”). But Tone Stith should not be defined by his high profile collaborators. He is a strong, contemporary artist in his own right who is progressively paving his own way in the industry. —Jessica McKinney\n\nYaya Bey\n\nIf you like: Kelsey Lu, Emily King\n\nListen to these songs first: “you up?,” “september 13th”\n\nI don’t know who is listening to this song and rejecting the sender. The New York native’s latest release is a commandeering of the truly overplayed “you up?” text that then ends with a melodic, hilarious and hearty uttering of “That dick is golden’’ on loop followed by laughter. It’s the perfect introduction to Yaya Bey’s work thus far—fun, experimental, and cathartic. On songs like “Meet Me in Brooklyn” she interlaces reggae riddims into her playful love note whilst on Remember Your North Star’s “Intro” she unravels a free flow of thoughts consolidated in tender notes. It’s her best album yet, a cementing of the lane she was carving for herself on 2021’s EP The Things I Can’t Take With Me. The daughter of the late veteran rapper Grand Daddy I.U is effortlessly cool. —Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo\n\nKirby\n\nIf you like: Ari Lennox, Ravyn Lenae\n\nListen to these songs first: “Penny,” “Try,” “Velvet”\n\nPossessing a respectable command of her tender and pure runs, Kirby has clearly studied the R&B arena, imparting the technicalities of harnessing vocals and using her instrument to empower a generation of listeners. Instantly authentic in songs such as “Try” and “Wish I Loved,” Kirby follows a lineage of R&B titans and contemporaries (such as Ari Lennox, Nina Simone, and Minnie Riperton) who blend the genre with the texture found in jazz and soul. Kirby’s EP Sis. exudes opulence. “Don’t Leave Your Girl,” in particular, provides the perfect balance of live instrumental and formidable vocal delivery. As she develops and taps into the softer sides of her vocals, it’s exciting to watch her grow over time. —Nicolas-Tyrell Scott\n\nNija\n\nIf you like: August Alsina, Aaliyah\n\nListen to these songs first: “Not One Of Them,” “Ease My Mind,” “Rare”\n\nBoth a product of her time and intentional in her storytelling, singer-songwriter Nija Charles is the complete package. Working with producer Jack Ro on her debut project, Don’t Say I Didn’t Warn You, Nija was quickly able to augment an endearing R&B and drill-infused universe. But Nija’s real asset lies in her penmanship. Having already harnessed the skill to aid Summer Walker and Beyoncé as a songwriter, she can now dissect her own experiences with a fluidity and precision that allows audiences to explore Nija’s romantic experiences with her, learning and evolving in the process. Reminiscent of Aaliyah in elements of her visual direction, Nija creates her aesthetic appeal. Standout “Ease My Mind” feels audacious, sultry, and cinematic, rendering Nija as an enticing act on the ascent. —Nicolas-Tyrell Scott"
