        "text": "Some time ago, I was chatting with a friend of mine about BeForU as he is familiar with the group. To get straight to the point, we have different tastes in music (not saying he didn’t like BeForU at all, he only likes certain members). And it made me start thinking of what I gravitate to in terms of Japanese music.\n\nMy friend’s position on vocal types is basically extremely cutesy voices don’t go well with him. Instead, he tends to like singers who 1) can stay on pitch (he claims that artists like Hitomi Yaida and Ayumi Hamasaki can’t stay on pitch well) and 2) he likes artists that have relatively deep voices (such as Yoma Komatsu from BeForU‘s original line up and Miwa Yoshida from Dreams Come True). I’ll get to the reason for why I said “relatively” in a moment.\n\nNow just to state it, I AGREE with him to a certain extent. This is because, from my experience with finding new music, cutesy is more marketable in Japan. And “cute” isn’t always what I’m looking for. Now, when I say cute, to me it means being higher up in their range. Also, the way I see it, it’s when the singer sounds younger than they’re supposed to be. Listen to Riyu Kosaka’s “3D♥HEART” for example (it’s one of the few songs by her that I dislike so much).\n\nI’m not going to say that I am an expert as I am not bombarded by a large variety of groups or soloists everyday (as a foreigner, I tend to lurk around youtube to find new artists to listen to). But in my experience, cute is just something you have to sift through to get what you actually like (in my friend’s case, something a little more deep[vocally]).\n\n(I managed to find an english sub of Yousei Teikoku‘s “Wahrheit” for you all).\n\nEven here, in a group with an edgy sound, Yui’s (the singer’s) voice can tend to be “cute” or “very sweet”. To me, I find it to be incredibly interesting to have such a voice with “gothic” style music –they themselves are advertised as gothic with album titles such as “GOTHIC LOLITA PROPERGANDA” (2007) and “Gothic Loilta Doctrine” (2009). It adds to the challenge of conveying an emotion (which is clarified by the general sound of the music. In Yousei Tekoku’s case, the emotions are dark and heavy).\n\nNow, back to the whole “cute” thing. I really do get where my friend is coming from. There is only so much bubbly, pink, upbeat-ness I can take before I want to claw my ears off. That being said, when it comes to artist who have cute voices (such as Riyu Kosaka from BeForU), the accompaniment that goes along with their singing can be a saving grace. For example, with “Wahrheit”, the overall aggressive sound of the track makes up for Yui’s somewhat “cute” voice.\n\nWhen I want my fix for deeper voices, I tend to turn to Mari Mizuno from Paris Match (a jazz group) or Mika Nakashima (contemporary music, somewhat experimental at times) and also, Misia (primarily R&B, and she has an expansive vocal range from very deep to very high). They don’t have the kind of bubblegum pop of sweet voices as some other singers in Japan, but their voices are great. For example, check out Paris Match’s “Summer Breeze”, Mika Nakashima’s “Over Load” and Misia’s “Wasurenai Hibi”.\n\nI do realize that the vast majority of artists/lead singers of groups I tend to listen to are female. What can I say, I like the sound of women’s voices. Don’t ask me why this is the case. Because I have no idea to be completely honest.\n\nThe purpose of this whole rant isn’t necessarily to completely trash some of the cuter voices in Japan. I actually don’t mind them too much. Looking at my music collection, I have more than my fair share of voices I consider “cute”. I’ll spare you details so this entry can be relatively short. And with that said, I think I’ll end my rant here.\n\nHitomi Yaida… before I go on, I have to write about her voice. She has this vibrato (vibration of the voice)… and it gives off the warmth of a normal vibrato but at times… to put it nicely, she sounds very dissonant (where two or more notes clash with each other is one example). Now for some people (like a friend of mine), this tendency for Yaida to vibrate her voice in a dissonant way makes them absolutely hate her. I personally find this vibrato to be somewhat unique. Only somewhat unique because Shiina Ringo (another singer that people tend to hate on) has a similar voice (but not exactly). And I’ve reviewed something of Shiina Ringo’s before .\n\nIn any case, I like voices like Shiina Ringo’s and Hitomi Yaida’s because I feel they allow more rawness to come from their voice. They don’t hold it back. Though, in all honesty, that vibrato makes it seem that they can’t hold a note’s pitch for long. That being said, let’s get started on this review.\n\nThis album was released on October 25th, 2000.\n\nFor all tracks, except track 9, Yaida composed everything. Now, this doesn’t mean that she arranged everything (as the two are very different skills. Composition usually refers to writing melodies and choosing chord progressions. Arranging usually refers to choosing the instruments used, and there may be some new music written by an arranger). But, being able to compose your own songs is awesome to me.\n\n1) How? <U.K. Mix> [PV LINK]\n\nFor the first track to start off with dissonance in the electric guitar? It’s not unheard of, but isn’t necessarily common either. For me, it foreshadows Yaida’s vocal tendency to be dissonant when she riffs with her vibrato (so there. I warned you TWICE). Soon the electric guitar switches to acoustic. It has a slight peppy sound, but its mellow enough to not surprise or overwhelm the listener. In terms of composition, its really solid. Lots of harmonious sound. For the arrangement, I find it interesting how there is electric guitar blended with acoustic. Not saying that she’s the only artist who does this. But for me, it is a bit confusing to hear electric guitar go straight to acoustic. It makes me feel like the accompaniment has been hollowed out a bit. This could also be because there are just no dissonant chords to create tension and then release with their resolution. Besides that Yaida’s voice is actually pretty tame in this song.\n\n2) Everything Is In Our mind\n\nIt starts off in dreamy like with bells, but they’re quick to disappear. And wait a second. What’s this? Once the second verse starts, this song reminds me of Michael Jackson’s “Black or White”. No seriously, this doesn’t happen with me often, thinking of American songs listening to Japanese music. But, 1. There are only a limited number of chord progressions or rhythms one can use in music. Its just the combination of other things that make a song sound unique. 2. Maybe Yaida happened to be inspired by it. Who knows. That’s all I’ll say on the matter. Anywhoo, here is where you start hearing Yaida’s vibrato at the end of long held notes. Again, her voice is rather tame here as well. And also like in “How?”, there is a lack of dissonance which makes it seem like everything is ok and peppy, which is ok… as long as she doesn’t keep doing that.\n\n3) B’coz I Love You [PV LINK]\n\nThe song starts off right away and finally, there is some tension and release in the form of 7th chords (there’s actually a lot of them). YAY! There’s the sound of an organ used as the keyboard instrument. The music after the chorus has drums added, giving the song a fuller sound. And in this song, is where I feel you start really getting that vibrato where it seems she can’t hold a note. This is one of those songs that go by quickly, if you really get into it. I really like the song when it modulates (changes key). Originally I thought it was a direct modulation (where there is no preparation for the key change) but with the sheet music, I now realize it does have a preparatory chord (I’ll do an analysis of this song eventually as I like it a lot).\n\n4) Your Kiss\n\nThere’s such a drastic change between the previous track and this one. “Your Kiss” is a lot calmer and the tempo is slower than the previous track. Now I wouldn’t call this a ballad, but its pretty close. Yaida’s voice doesn’t use the vibrato here, so this may be one of those songs that people who can’t tolerate her vibrato would be able to listen to. But it’s not the most memorable song on the album either, which would only bore some people. The arrangement is sparse during the verses but is fuller with drums in the choruses. There are more complex chords used in the later part of the verses and the pre-chorus, giving the melody a bit more to work with harmonically.\n\n5) My Sweet Darlin’ [PV LINK]\n\nAnd then we move back into a peppy track. This track features a large chunk of English (first verse, last chorus and of course the “Darlin’, Darlin’ in the chorus) where it’s actually pronounced pretty clearly. In any case, it’s obviously a love song (which can be inferred by the English) that’s somewhat bittersweet and I find it interesting just how uplifting it seems. Though, that’s not the most unique thing, but it is what it is. The melody is extremely catchy, being the catchiest of the entire album, even in the verses (but obviously, the choruses are the catchiest). In this song you get a bit of the troublesome vibrato.\n\n6) Girl’s Talk\n\nWe’re back with the distorted guitars at the beginning. Yaida’s vocals are kind of like yelling in the chorus, which to me is an off putting thing (at least for Yaida since shes not in a genre of music that requires her to yell. Maybe if it wasn’t a pop-rock sound…). The arrangement is very action packed, with many things going on throughout the chorus. The vocal melody isn’t extremely catchy and there’s little to remember about this song.\n\n7) Moshimo no Uta\n\nThis is the most playful song on the album. It also has some of the most obnoxious singing of the whole album. Yaida’s voice sounds distant (could be a vocal effect) and it seems like she’s belting out a bit too much. It’s almost like she’s yell-singing at me. And it’s frustrating. Also, there’s little tension throughout the song to catch my interest. The only thing I find nice about this song is the violin in the back (and it does sometimes shine like in between the choruses and at the end). But that’s just about it. I almost always skip over this song.\n\n8) Nee [PV LINK]\n\nFrom the get-go, this song sounds different from the previous track. It starts off with very low strings then breaks out into drums. Soon the piano enters with a guitar (or it could be a synth honestly) with reverse reverb (basically playing a sound backwards with an echo. Though honestly I could be wrong and it could be a different effect. But for now, I’ll call it a reverse reverb). Then finally, you get Yaida’s voice but honestly, it doesn’t take too long. I like the little introduction because it cleanses the ears in a way from all the silliness. Overall, it’s a very calm song. There is some tension, especially in the bridge (around 2:19) and it is very much appreciated by me, since I feel as if Yaida doesn’t have enough tension in her songs. In this song, you get a little of her vibrato, but I don’t think it’s enough to “ruin” the song.\n\n9) Osaka Jinnta\n\nHere we go. The one song that Yaida did not write. It’s an instrumental track that starts off with beeping to signify that this song isn’t going to sound like the previous (in my opinion, of course). It’s very action packed and seems like a song that might do well in an action sequence in a movie, just saying. It uses two electric guitars at some points. It’s an ok track, and it leads into the next track pretty well, even though this track ends abruptly. It’s a little over a minute in length, which is ok by me but I tend to skip this song anyway, because I’m not a fan of interludes.\n\n10) I Like <U.K. Mix>\n\nIt starts off with guitar (I’ve heard this before but the origin is eluding me, which may be a good thing). The energy of the song is pretty peppy and very upbeat, perhaps using the feel of “Osaka Jinnta” to propel into this track (see interludes aren’t bad, I just don’t like them). I really do enjoy the energy and the sound of the piano around 1:13. The vocal melody of “I like” is the most memorable part of this song, and it does get stuck in my head. The chord progressions are a little more colorful, which makes me happy.\n\n11) Nothing\n\nStarts off with a little piano pattern and drums. The vocal melody is surprisingly catchy, as is the whole song. It was a bit abrupt going from a very peppy song to this more laidback arrangement. But around 1:40, it starts to pick up with electric guitar and after a short pause, it kind of explodes into a more active arrangement. It makes Yaida’s voice sound more powerful, as if she’s singing about something that requires a stronger accompaniment to convey her message (this may be the case. My Japanese isn’t very good so I can’t tell you if it is the case). About 3 minutes in, it gets really exciting with a powerful electric guitar ascent at 3:48. It does calm down after that, to the original arrangement (with added electric guitar), but this song really does catch my interest, and I feel “Nothing” is a great end to this album.\n\nPros\n\n– Comfortable singing range (even though it may not seem that way, this to the people who think she can’t hold a note)\n\n– A variety of styles (not just folksy or not just pop-rockish)\n\n– Songs are polished.\n\nCons\n\n– Some songs just aren’t catchy\n\n– Some songs with the yelling… its annoying\n\n– Little tension and release leaves more to be desired\n\n(and…) Gift/curse\n\n– vibrato (makes her memorable, but not necessarily in a good way!)\n\nScore:\n\nVocals: 4\n\nComposition: 3\n\nArrangement: 4\n\nConstruction: 3\n\nTOTAL: 14/20. Not bad for a first album, but does need some help.\n\nOverall:\n\nAs you can tell, I really wanted more tension and release from Yaida. I’m not a fan when chords just go nicely together with little to no issues (to be technical… no use of non-chord tones or no use of colorful chords that build on basic triads like add9 chords or more commonly 7th chords). And also, to me her voice is bearable in this album, though others may disagree with me with good reason (that vibrato). There are very truly catchy songs, as I don’t think it’s a pop style that is supposed to be expressed. I think it’s more of a folksy pop or even pop-rock (not saying that the songs couldn’t be more memorable). But for a first album, it actually is pretty solid.\n\nI’m not too sure what to review next, but I’ll figure out something. Thank you for reading all of this review!"
