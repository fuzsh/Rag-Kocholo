Total sales in 199.N, however, were up only l. i r < to S21.3 million, due to an 18* drop in singles sales, to 1 10.4 million. While singles sales have suffered a dramatic decline, label executives say that they are not worried be- cause they do not consider singles a NEWS ANALYSIS profit center. In fact, one of the main reason singles sales are down is be- cause more labels have not been making radio hits available commer- cially in the singles configuration, in an attempt to spur greater album sales. Retailers, however, bemoan the downsizing of the singles mar- ket liecause they enjoy high margins on the configuration.

Heralded as the first long-range associa- tion between a major music publisher and talent agency, the Chrysalis/CAA ties are likely to soon realize three or four deals that are now in \"various stages of finalization,\" EC Plans Action Over Copyright Exemptions In U.S. This story was prepared by Jeff Clark-Meads in London, KenStewart in Dublin, and Bill Holland in Wash- ington, D.C. A spokesman for the U.S. trade rep- resentative (USTR) in Washington, D.C, confirmed Jan. 6 that the Euro- pean Commission (EC) has notified the USTR that it intends to file a trade complaint alleging that non-American composers and songwriters will suffer huge losses in licensing income due to a new U.S. law that gives \"homestyle\" music licensing exemptions to many restaurants, taverns, and retail shops across the U.S. ASCAP, BMI, the National Music- Publishers' Assn., and other U.S. groups that lost the two-year fight on Capitol Hill last fall to have the con- troversial provision stricken from the Copyright Extension Act say that they, too, will lose millions in royalty income and have gone on the record as still opposing the exemption (Billboard, Dec. 6, 1998). The USTR official said that once the complaint is filed this month, the U.S. will follow World Trade Organization (WTO) procedures that begin with a 60-day-minimum bilateral consultation between the parties and then shift to a three-judge arbitration proceeding if the matter isn't resolved. If the U.S. loses its hearing before the arbitration panel — with arguments (Continued on page 79) nt, although he 3. says Leeds Levy, president of Chrysalis Music. Both companies are based in Los Angeles. Although the likelihood is that Chrysalis Music will tap mostly newer or developing writers, Levy says established talents could be part of the arrangement, although he concedes that talent of this type usually has its songwriting relation- ships set. \"We've got two offers out on established acts,\" he notes. He says there is a strong element of \"flexi- bility\" in the CAA ar- rangement. \"The busi- ness of an independent publisher is flexibility. Whatever we come up with [that relates to CAA] we'd share with them.\" For example, Levy says, if a writer agreeing to a co-publishing deal with Chrysalis has his or her own publishing setup, Chrysalis would be that writer's re- publisher but would still share its co-pub- lishing earnings with CAA, just as it would in an administration arrangement \"The deal requires no special publishing company to be formed by CAA, yet their position with us is the same with regard to ASCAP, BMI, SESAC income or royalties from any other source,\" Levy says. \"In this regard, we consider ourselves married, joined at the hip.\" It is Chrysalis, however, that will shell out advances in co-publishing and exploit mate- rial even if it is part of an administration deal. For its part, CAA is obligated to give Chrysalis Music first refusai on rights to any talent that has publishing available in one form or another; CAA can shop the writer elsewhere if Chrysalis passes. It is with such \"flexibility\" in mind that Levy says he is not restricted from having a publishing relationship with other talent agencies, although he clearly sees the CAA association as the object of his focus in this area. Levy says, for example, that if acts he signs to Chrysalis Music are looking for a talent agency, he would \"out of courtesy bring it to CAA's attention.\" \"In fact,\" he says, \"we recently brought a musical property, that we have grand rights to, to CAA's theatrical division.\" The property, in a \"developing\" stage, is a show based on the music of Paul Anka. Another musical stage project in development is \"Paris\" by Malcolm McLaren. (Chrysalis Music itself has a 50% interest in Air-Edel, a leading theatrical agency in the U.K.) Levy says the seeds of its CAA re- lationship were sown in 1997 at Country Music Week in Nashville, where Chrysalis Music has opened an office. \"I met with Tom Ross, head of music at CAA for 20 years before his recent depar- ture [he has been replaced by Rob Light]. We started kibitzing about people we knew in common in the entertainment business. Maybe, I suggested to him, we could come (Continued on page 79) Legendary Collaboration. With a four-song EP pairing legendary musicians Joey Ramone and Ronnie Spector due this month from the U.K.'s Creation Records, Specter's annual Christmas party was the place to be. Held in December at the New York club Life, the event included Spector duets with her old friend Keith Richards on \"Run, Run, Rudolph\" and \"Be My Baby\" and another duet with Ramone, as well as a set by Spector and her touring band. Spector is set to record her Creation solo debut in spring of 1999. Shown at the party, from left, are Ramone. Spector, and Richards. Pete Jones Eets Expanded Me At BMG BY DON JEFFREY SAN DIEGO— BMG Entertainment's pro- motion of Peter Jones to president/CEO of BMG Distribution and Associated Labels (Bill- boardft/i/efin, Jan. 6) comes at a time when ■ BMG has set an aggres- sive sales goal — an 18% I share of the current albums sold. In 1998, according to SoundScan, jones BMG's North American current album share was 14.4%, its highest in six years. Strauss Zelnick, president/CEO of BMG Entertainment says sales in North Amer- ica have increased 41.4% during the past four years and operating income has grown from \"a loss to a significant profit.\" BMG Distribution's annual sales are more than $1 billion. Jones' promotion, announced during the company's annual convention, held the week of Jan. 4 here, gives him authority over some of the company's labels for the first time. \"BMG Distribution has always been and continues to be a company that is intimate- ly involved with and supportive of its labels,\" says Jones. \"This new responsibility for me is just an extension of what I love to do, and I hope to achieve even more success for this wonderful group of companies.\" Jones has been given oversight of three BMG label ventures — Loud Records, Rob- bins Entertainment, and CMC Interna- tional — but executives indicate that other affiliated labels could come under his purview later. Jones, who has been president of BMG Distribution for 1 1 years, now also has oversight of BMG Special Products, the catalog development arm of BMG Enter- tainment that includes the newly formed reissue label Buddha Records. Special Products and Associated Labels had pre- viously reported to Zelnick, to whom Jones reports.

[-Commerce Tops Industry Agendas For 106th Congress BY BILL HOLLAND WASHINGTON, D.C.— Although the myriad issues surrounding electronic commerce will be debated by the record- ing industry and federal lawmakers dur- ing the 106th Congress, which convened Jan. 6, few legislative issues thus far are on the agenda of industry groups for 1999. Performing right groups and music publishers will also be working to imple- ment the changes brought about by the 1998 passage of the copyright-extension bill and U.S. ratification of the World Intellectual Property Organisation treaties. \"We don't have a proactive legislative agenda,\" says Hilary Rosen, president/ CEO of the Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA). \"We have a lot of work to do [in the private sector] in the tech- nology and music-marketing areas, but the big thing on Capitol Hill is the over- all E-commerce policy and privacy and liability and commercial practices. And we'll be involved.\" Adds Rosen, \"I think we may see some debates over privacy issues. We may see some [debate] over consumer-credit kinds of issues and E-commerce com- mercial liability — you know, like if I were selling music online, and somebody's computer crashes. Those kinds of issues will probably be discussed. I'm not sure how many specific legislative proposals we'll see. We don't have a list of 'needs.' \" COPYRIGHT PROTECTION Officials at ASCAP, BMI, and the National Music Publishers' Assn. also say their groups have not yet outlined any legislative agenda for the first session of Congress, but, like the RIAA, they will be monitoring hearings on E-commerce to make sure copyright protections for their members aren't impaired. \"You can bet there'll be some group trying to get something for free,\" says Fred Cannon, Brill's VP of government relations. The groups also have to continue major private-sector fence-patching with their European counterparts. Societies across Europe are angered by an amendment to the U.S. copyright-extension bill that gives restaurants, taverns, and some retail outlets an exemption from paying royalty fees to play so-called background music (Billboard, Oct 31, 1998). TRADE COMPLAINT A spokesman for the U.S. trade repre- sentative (USTR) said Jan. 6 that the European Commission has notified the USTR that it intends to initiate a trade complaint about the loss of general licensing income in the U.S. that the amendment could spur, affecting Euro- pean collection societies and their song- writers (see story, page 5).

The introduction of the single European currency, the euro, has removed one level of complication from the task of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) when evaluating how- much music sales here are worth. IFPI presents its world sales data in terms of U.S. dollars. Historically, this has meant converting each of Europe's national currencies into dol- lars. Now, however, only the euro will Indie Unrest Spurs Eves' VSDA Exit BY EILEEN FITZPATRICK LOS ANGELES— The search is on for a replacement for Video Software Dealers Assn. (VSDA) president Jef- frey Eves, who submitted his resig- nation Jan. 4 in the wake of growing dissatisfaction among independent retailers (BillboanUfa/fenn, Jan. 5). Eves will remain at the trade orga- nization until April 1, and an execu- tive search committee is expected to be in place this week to find a suc- cessor, according to VSDA chairman Mark Vrieling. Eves was appointed as VSDA's first president in 1994 and was given a five-year contract by the board in 1996. Financial terms of the depar- ture settlement were not disclosed. \"Jeff wasn't getting the support of the membership, and it became im- possible for him to do his job,\" says Vrieling. \"He realized he had done all he could.\" The VSDA board, which is made up of 10 elected members from the independent retail sector and eight appointed members from major chains, accepted Eves' resignation during a Jan. 4 conference call.

WMI took a 50% share of China in 1994; it has now bought the remain- der from label founder/chairman Derek Green for an undisclosed sum. According to a WMI statement, Warner Music U.K will now assume responsibility for China's current roster — including (in the U.K.) Mor- cheeba, Rialto, and the Levellers — and catalog, \"with a view to incorpo- rating China into the current Warner Music U.K. structure with WEA Records and East West Records.\" Manfred Zumkeller, president of Warner Music Europe, says, \"By acquiring the label, we will in the future be able to market and promote those artists signed to China Records from within our own structure.\" Green founded China Records in 1984, prior to which he served as senior VP and U.

During the same period, the volume for so-called open DVD players likely topped 400,000 units, which means upstart Divx accounted for better than a 20% share. Divx's quick start has been antici- pated (Picture This, Billboard, Dec. 26, 1998), but then so had the positive results for DVD. As expected, the DVD Video Group (DVG) announced at the International Consumer Elec- tronics Show, held Jan. 7-10 in Las Vegas, that a total of 1 million play- ers were purchased by consumers last year from the 1.4 million shipped to retailers. It's further proof that \"DVD Video is the fastest-growing new packaged media format in history,\" according to the DVG announcement The trade group estimates that hardware sales will double to 2 million in 1999, aided by a steady decline in prices.

Not only does this provide ready comparisons between the states; it hugely reduces the distortion of the figures produced by exchange-rate fluctuations. An IFPI spokesman notes, \"The big advantage for us is that four of the world's top 10 record markets are now using the euro — Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.\" He adds that IFPI will no longer work with any of the national currencies in the 1 1 participating states on the basis that \"they're only denominations of the euro.\" All future IFPI figures for the territories will be expressed only in euros and dollars. The euro became a real financial entity Jan. 1, when 11 EU nations irrevocably tied together the ex- change rates of their national cur- rencies (Billboard, Aug. 8, Sept. 19, and Oct. 17, 1998). Record stores across the European continent are now gearing up to price goods in both national currencies and in euros.

Jerry Blair, senior VP of the Columbia Records Group, will over- see C2's promotional efforts, with Columbia execs handling key mar- keting and A&R duties. \"We have a lot of great artists and music signed to this label,\" Blair says of the imprint's formation. \"C2 pro- vides us a better opportunity to expose them. Ideally, this will prevent a great recording from slipping through the cracks.\" The C2 staff consists of a coast-to- coast promotion team of 12, helmed by head of promotion Dennis Reese, recently VP of promotion at the Work Group. Among the other key appointments is Geordie Gillespie to VP of promo- tion. He was previously VP of alter- native promotion at the Work Group. Many C2 staffers are reassigned Columbia staffers. Blair expects to make additional staff appointments to the imprint in the coming months. Produced by Walter Afanasieff, the Mclntyre single went to radio in late December, and it's already the most-requested track on WXKS (Kiss 108) Boston. \"Stay The Same\" is the title track of an album due March 2. It will also appear on Columbia's forthcoming soundtrack to \"Dawson's Creek.\" C2 singles due for radio release this month are \"All 'Bout The Money\" by Meja and \"Level On The Inside\" by Dovetail Joint. Albums will be issued over the next two months. Subsequent single releases include \"Life's A Bitch\" by Shooter and \"Helpless\" by D Generation; both are set for February. Additional artists and projects will be announced at a later date. C2's roster will continually evolve, and the decision to release a particu- lar Columbia Records Group artist through C2 will be made on a project- by-project basis. LARRY FLICK CRTG Amends CanCon Rules BY LARRY LeBLANC TORONTO— An amendment altering Canadian-content (Can- Con) requirements took effect Jan. 3, despite a request by the Canadian Assn. of Broadcasters (CAB) to the Canadian Radio-tele- vision and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a delay in increasing the domestic music quotas for commercial radio. The CRTC amended the 1986 Radio Regulations on Dee. 17, 1998. Except as otherwise provided by condition of license, commercial stations in Canada must now ensure that at least 35% (up from 30%) of the popular music selec- tions they broadcast fits Canadian- content rules. The CAB had lobbied for unspecified percentage incentives and the modification of content qualifications, arguing that such measures could lead to increased exposure of new Canadian-gener- ated music. However, there had been stiff opposition to any tinker- ing. Gary Slaight, president/CEO of Standard Radio Inc., who is spearheading the broadcaster group's efforts to create incentives and reconfigure criteria, remains optimistic about changes, however. \"The CRTC declined to give us a delay but said they were open to reviewing both [criteria] and new music incentives,\" he says. 8 BILLBOARD JANUARY 16. 1999 Billboard & Fox Television would like to thank the hosts, performers, presenters, winners, The MGM Grand Hotel, The Hard Rock Hotel, and all the wonderful people working behind the scenes for making this year's show a huge success.

New Site Raises Webcast Issues Studio Scene Consolidates Nashville Sees 2 Big Mergers BY DAN DALEY NASHVILLE— The recording stu- dio landscape here — overbuilt dur- ing country music's boom years of 1990-94 and stretched thin by stat- ic rates, competition from personal recording, and spiraling equipment costs — has begun to experience a forecasted consolidation. In late December 1998, two sig- nificant mergers occurred: Emer- ald Recording, the No. 1 country music studio of 1997-98, according to Billboard's Production Credits chart — concluded negotiations to purchase the assets of one of Nashville's other top facilities, Mas- terfonics, which entered Chapter 1 1 bankruptcy protection in Janu- ary 1998. Simultaneously, two-room studio Seventeen Grand Recording an- nounced that it had acquired the technology and business assets of Love Shack Studios, a facility owned by songwriter/publisher Vern Dant The two transactions reflect what many consider to be an inevitable reaction to a studio base under considerable pressure. Since the mid-\"90s, Nashville has grown from a country music hub to a glob- al powerhouse with an estimated 300 facilities that cater to a wide range of music, film, broadcast, and multimedia clients. Among those studios are new world-class facilities like Ocean Way Nashville, Masterfonics' Tracking Room, Starstruck Entertainment, and East Iris Studios; established\" mainstream studios such as Mas- terfonics' mastering rooms, Em- erald, Music Mill, Sound Emporium, and Sound Stage; and an increasing number of personal studios owned by artists, publishers, producers, and label heads, including a full-ser- 'We're building a bridge between broadcast and the record industry' vice home facility recently built by Virgin Records Nashville president Scott Hendricks. While many entrepreneurs built new studios or expanded existing ones, Emerald focused on growth through such ancillary markets as broadcast Milan Bogdan, who once part- nered with former Masterfonics owner Glenn Meadows at that facil- ity and is now GM at Emerald, says, \"Studio rates [in Nashville] simply didn't justify participating in a technology 'arms race.'

However, in its larger context, the service also frames some of the chal- lenges ahead for rights organizations and trade groups making an effort to license Webcasters and collect mechanical royalties online. SHOUTcast, which lets users stream audio in the MP3 format, is free for \"general nonprofit use\" but charges $299 per server for a com- mercial license. At press time, there were more than 200 \"stations\" Webcasting everything from electronica to dirty jokes to stations featuring the music of one or two artists (Billboard- Bulletin, Jan. 5). Other companies, such as Talk- NetRadio.com, are also initiating programs designed to accommodate individual Webcasters. The TalkNet site, which is currently registering users, will let them broadcast for free to a set number of people. A similar service, Destiny Broadcast Network (www.radiodestiny.com), launched a few months ago. Destiny, which requires a proprietary streaming technology, had 12 stations stream- ing at press time. \"Our goal is to do for would-be DJs what free home pages do for would- be publishers,\" says Nullsoft direc- tor of online strategies Rob Lord. \"All you need is a WinAmp, and you're in the streaming business.\" WinAmp is Nullsoft's popular desktop MP3 player, which can be downloaded from Nullsoft's Web site. Most stations listed at the SHOUT- cast site can accommodate no more than 32 simultaneous listeners. ASCAP senior VP of new media Marc Morgenstern says the per- forming right society has begun dis- cussions with Nullsoft and is assess- ing the situation. As with other rights organizations, ASCAP already has several classes of Webcasting licenses in place. Its lowest-end license costs $250 a year. Asked whether ASCAP might help develop a new class of license for these nonprofessional Webcasters, Mor- genstern says, \"We need to get a lot more information first but we have a very open mind toward figuring out something that fairly reflects the use SINGER WRIGHT director of music and talent/pro- gramming at MTV Networks Latin America.

As John Parres, author of digital technologies Web site the Geek Report, points out, determining exactly how many people are ulti- mately hearing these Webcasts can be tricky. \"It's sort of a pyramid distribution scheme,\" says Parres. \"The first computer may have the ability to send out about 30 streams, but maybe 20 of those streams are picked up by 20 other computers that can send out 20 streams each.\" Additionally, SHOUTcast Webcast- ers may be held accountable by the Recording Industry Assn. of America BY CARLA HAY NEW YORK— The executive editor of Spin magazine, Craig Marks, filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit Jan. 4 against rock singer Marilyn Manson and several Manson associates over a Nov. 23, 1998, incident in which Marks was allegedlv assaulted (Bill- board, Dee. 12, 1998). The lawsuit — filed in New York Supreme Court, County of New York — also names as defendants Interscope Records and Nothing Records, the labels associated with Manson; Aaron Dilks and Steve Miller, identified as Manson body- guards; and Doe Agency, which employs the bodyguards (Bill- boardBulletin, Jan. 7). Marks claims that he was threat- ened by Manson and physically attacked by the two bodyguards. He is seeking a maximum of $4 million in compensatory damages from each defendant and a minimum of $20 mil- lion each in punitive damages for, among other things, false imprison- ment and emotional distress. In court documents, Marks states that he believes the incident happened because Manson was upset about not being featured on the cover of Spin.

EXECUTIVE TURNTA Spin Editor Sues Manson Labels, Others Named In Multimillion-Dollar Suit 10 BILLBOARD JANUARY 1 6. 1 999 Artists usic POP-ROCK'R&B'RAP«DANCE-COUNTRY«LATIN'CLASSICAL«JAZZ«PRO AUDIO Tuvan 'Throat Singer 3 Meets U.S. Roots Acts On WB Set BY JIM BESSMAN NEW YORK— Country music from two widely separated but surprising- ly related cultures comes together Tuesday (12) when Warner Bros, releases \"Back Tuva Future\" by Tuvan throat singer Kungar-ol Ondar. The cross-cultural undertaking was co-produced by David Hoffner and Jim Ed Norman. It mixes the preternatural]}' simultaneous multi- note vocalizing of traditional singers from the remote Central Asian, southern Siberian republic with sim- ilarly rootsy American country mu- sic styles. Ondar is joined by guest artists in- cluding Willie Nelson, Randy Scruggs, and Bill Miller, as well as by the late Nobel Prize-winning physi- cist and Tuva enthusiast Richard Feynman. The disc, which ends with a lengthy hidden track explaining the music and Ondar's vocal techniques, is also marked by extensive techno wizardry from Hoffner. There are several types of throat- singing, which is also known as over- tone or harmonic singing. Ondar, who won UNESCO's first International Festival of Throat-Singing in 1992, specializes in the sygyt (suh-gut) whistle-like style, which splits the vocal line into distinct melodic and drone threads. But he can sing as many as four notes at once and accom- panies himself on doshpiduur (Tuvan banjo) and khinrms (Tuvan jaw harp). Ondar has two previous U.S. al- bums — \"Echoes Of Tuva\" and \"Genghis Blues,\" with San Francisco bluesman/fellow throat-singing cham- pion Paul \"Earthquake\" Pena; both were released on TuvaMuch Records. The seeds for the new album's novel fusion were planted some 10 years ago when Hoffner, a former keyboardist for Michael Martin Mur- phey and frequent sideman in ses- sions produced by Warner/Reprise Nashville president Norman, hap- pened upon a PBS special on Feyn- man, the adventurous physicist who died in 1988 and whose achievements included solving the mystery of the space shuttle Challenger disaster. \"I was casually watching, and they mentioned he had an interest in Tuva and played a bit of throat-singing, and I popped off the couch,\" says Hoffner. After eventually obtaining a few Tuvan music CDs, he gave one to Emmylou Harris, for whom he was doing session work. Harris mentioned the music in interviews, copies of which were even- tually forwarded to Ralph Leighton, author of \"Tuva Or Bust!— Richard Feynman's Last Journey.\" Leighton, associate producer of \"Back Tuva Future,\" was a friend of Feyn- man's, a fellow drummer, and geography buff. He is founder of the Pasadena, Calif. - based Friends of Tuva, a clearinghouse for all things Tuva; having met Ondar in Tuva in 1991, he acts informally as his manager. Hoffner recalls that after he struck up a phone friendship with Leighton, Leighton sent Ondar and Pena to perform in Nashville during Ondar's next U.S. trip, in 1995. While there, Hoffner recorded Ondar's vocals, and in his studio electronical- ly created a dance tune around them. He later played this for Norman, who was, coincidentally, another Feyn- man fan eager to work with Ondar. That tune, \"Tuva Groove,\" is now the lead track on \"Back Tuva Fu- ture\" and is based on an ancient Tu- van folk song. As Norman notes, though, Ondar's lyrics for it relate to Feynman, whom Ondar knew about and whose chants and hand drums, via 20-year-old recordings made with Leighton, were slowed slightly and bridged into the track via Hoffner's specially composed chord structures. \"Richard Feynman discovered Tuva, not only for America but for the whole world,\" says Ondar, by way of a translator. \"And Friends of Tuva put his dreams into reality. All Tuvan people are grateful for that.\" Feynman, in fact, had dreamed of going to Tuva for the last decade of his life, but researching the Challenger explosion and cancer got in the way. \"If s like he finally got to go to Tuva and play with the Tuvans,\" says Hoff- ner of Feynman's posthumous contri- butions to \"Tuva Groove\" and several other \"Back Tuva Future\" tracks. Ondar returned to Nashville in June 1997, and Hoffner again sampled his traditional vocals and subject mat- ter, then built album tracks around them — always minding the idiosyn- crasies of throat-singing and Ondar's preferred keys of \"between D and E- flat\" and \"just south of G-flat\" Norman then called in guest musi- cians, including American Indian singer Miller, who recorded \"Two Lands, One Tribe\" with Ondar. The song is based on an ancient Tuvan melody and American Indian chants and features Miller playing wood- land flute. \"It's believed Tuva may have been where Native American tribes passed through from Siberia to North America,\" says Leighton. \"At least there are cultural similarities in the beating of large drums and shaman chants — and the idea that everything has a spirit.\" Norman notes, too, that since the project was to meld Tuvan traditional music with American sounds, blue- grass was an obvious genre of choice — hence the presence of Scruggs and mandolinist Sam Bush on the ancient Tuvan folk song \"Good Horses.\" Nelson's participation came about when the producers thought of his interest in cowboys and the plight of the American farmer. \"Tuva's land has been divided, and the Soviet farm collectives there were disastrous,\" says Norman. \"So there was the farming connection [with Nel- son], and the Tuvan people have been horsemen for 2,000 years.\" Nel- son recites the English lyrics of \"Where Has My Country Gone?,\" a lament about the effects of collectivized farms. MARKETING CHALLENGE But there is also a rap tune on \"Back Tuva Future\" — \"Kargyraa Rap,\" which alternates Ondar's Tuvan tongue-twisters with Feyn- man's storytelling — prompting Nor- man to report his marketing depart- ment's initial dismay with the project. \"There's bluegrass one minute, disco the next, so from a marketing perspective it's a difficult thing,\" says Norman. \"So the focus is on the singer and his art form of throat- singing and all that can be done with it in the context of American music.\" Consequently, there will be a dance mix for \"Tuva Groove\" and possibly \"Kargyaa Rap,\" designed to generate club play. Chris Palmer, VP of progressive music for Warner Bros. Nashville, ac- knowledges that the album \"won't be an easy one to work,\" but says that the presence of Feynman, along with the stellar guest musicians, ensures at least \"a worthwhile media story.\" The label also is targeting eclectic noncommercial radio. \"We think sta- tions like WXPN in Philadelphia, KCRW in Los Angeles, and KERA in Dallas can play tracks like \"Good Hors- es,' 'Where Has My Country Gone?,' and even \"Tuva Groove,' \" says Palmer. Indeed, Bruce Warren, PD of WXPN and producer of its \"World Cafe\" syndicated show, describes \"Tuva Groove\" as \"Tuvan techno.\" \"It's an exquisitely produced al- bum that will surprise a lot of people who may not be familiar with this kind of music,\" adds Warren. Palmer expects to work both ma- jor retail accounts and the smaller ones that make up the Coalition of Independent Music Stores. Randi Mayrent, world music buyer for the Borders chain, says that the album is \"by far the most accessible that I've heard in this genre\" but questions whether it can reach a mainstream audience. That question may have been answered, however; in June 1997, Ondar, who was in Nashville re- cording vocals for the album, visited the Grand Ole Opry and performed the opening of \"Two Lands, One Tribe\" followed by the medley of throat-singing styles that he record- ed on Ellipsis Arts' 1996 CD/book \"Deep In The Heart Of Tuva— Cow- boy Music From The Wild East\" Norman recalls Ondar's emergence on the Opry stage in full traditional Tuvan regalia and the audience's rapt attention: \"A lot of people thought it was bizarre, but I thought it made sense because Ondar's just singing country music from another country about the same things: love and the land, sweethearts, and one of his favorite subjects is horses, so it's both cowboys and Indians, with a nomadic lifestyle similar to Native Americans.\" \"It's the same as Tuvan music,\" says Ondar of American country mu- sic, \"and a special experience for any musician to perform at the Opry with the [legends] of country music.\" Billboard's 1 998 Year End Issue A special double issue featuring the top rankings in every category of music and video charts for 1 998.

The act, signed to Epic U.K. by managing director Hob Stringer, is in the U.S. supporting 'N Sync on the first leg of its world tour, which started in late December and runs until Jan 17. With a look and sound that appeals directly to a teen audience and younger, B'Witched has become a sales and media sensation in the U.K., forming part of a wave of young pop that includes such acts as Innocent/Virgin's Billie or WEA's Cleopatra. B'Witched's denim \"uniform\" and energetic, unique dancing style has picked it out from the pack, as has its sound, which member Keavy Lynch describes as \"Irish hip-hop/pop.\" Flutes, fiddles, and drum'n'bass rhythms mesh with strong hooks, producing a rare mix in the pop world. \"We never wanted it to be about drum'n'bass or pop music,\" says Lynch, the twin sister of Edele in the band and sister of Shane from Irish superstars Boyzone. Their image is their own cre- ation, says band member Sinead O'C'aroll, noting. \"When the record company talked to us, they were never heading for a certain age group.\" Adds Keavy Lynch, \"Our music and style has progressed, but they never changed us in ourselves. This is who we are.\" Their young image belies their ages: Lindsay Armaou is 18, Edele and Keavy Lynch have just turned 19, and 0 ; Caroll is 20. Says Armaou, \"The image por- Snakefarm Turns To Traditional Folk Songs For Debut Set On RCA BY MICHAEL PAOLETTA NEW YORK— Since 1984, Anna Domino has released four albums, two EPs, and a \"greatest hits\" col- lection (1996's \"Favorite Songs From The Twilight Years\") on the Belgian label Les Disques du Crepuscule. On Feb. 16, Domino enters a new phase in her career with the Kneeling Ele- phant/RCA Records release of \"Songs From My Funeral.\" Domino, along with her life/music partner Michel Delory, is now using the moniker Snakefarm. And \"Songs From My Funeral\" finds the pair exploring traditional folk songs — albeit in Domino style. \"This project started out as an exercise,\" explains Domino. \"1 want- ed to make music with a heavy drum 'n'hass feel. It's something I always wanted to do, but my melody-driven and verbose music didn't take kind- ly to such things. But these tradi- tional songs did.\" Steeped in Sneaker Pimps-style industrial-strength beats, songs like \"St. James,\" \"Banks Of The Ohio,\" \"Laredo,\" and \"Rising Sun\" bask in Delory's downtempo, lounge-ready rhythms and Domino's wicked vocal delivery. (The group's songs are pub- lished by Light of Dav, administered by Bug.) \"The traditional songs Anna and Michel have chosen deal with death and dying. That said. I see Snake- farm like a Portishead-meets-Nick Caw,\" says Marc Geiger, co-owner/ co-CEO of Encino, Calif.-based Kneeling Elephant, an A&R and marketing outlet. Geiger became aware of Snake- farm when an artist he manages — Matt Johnson (aka The The)— gave him Snakefarm's demo tape. He re- members finding the music funky, ultra cool, and trip-hoppy. \"I immediately thought of groups like Esthero, Massive Attack, and Morcheeba. Basically, it was a no brainer. I knew I wanted to sign them,\" says the executive, who signed Frank Black, Skinny Puppy, and the Jesus & Mary Chain when he was at American Recordings and signed the Pixies and the Sugar- cubes when he was at L. A. -based Triad Artists. Because of Kneeling Elephant's P&D deal with RCA, \"Songs From My Funeral\" has already been li- censed to BMG Australia and BMG Italy.

'N Sync will return to the studio early this year to work on its new album, which the group hopes will come out in August. Says group member Lance Bass, \"We want to start early [on the record] because we have an arena tour in March, April, and May. 'N Sync's Justin Timbcrlake adds, \"We've been working on songs on the road. We will be working with many of the same writers and producers, although we are talking to some new ones also. We have a process when we record. We write a bunch of songs, throw them all in a pit, and then pick and choose the ones we like the best. It will be a nice mix of ballads and party songs. We just want to have fun.\" Natalie Imbruglia, who is writ- ing her follow-up to \"Left Of The Middle,\" says she expects the new effort to be \"more focused. I'd like to use just one producer who can fulfill that for me instead of a lot. The ballads will still be there, but there'll be other stuff. I might funk it up a bit\" . . .

BOULEY II LOS ANGELES— As Janita eyes the Feb. 23 release of her epony- mous 550 Music debut, she can't help but feel like she's outlining the script for a Cinderella-like movie. Two years ago, on the heels of three successful albums in her native Finland, the 18-year-old pop ingenue bid goodbye to a growing career and loving family and hopped on a plane for New York with her beau. Upon landing, they asked the cab driver for advice on where to live in the city, and he recommended the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. She now lives there. Once settled, Janita dove into the music scene, making the necessary connections for an American record deal. One day, producer Jimmy Doug- lass happened to be in the same room as Janita; after hearing one of her tracks, \"Getting Over,\" he felt compelled to introduce himself. A few months later, on April Fool's Day, Janita got a call from Michael Kaplan, senior VP of A&R at 550 Music; he made her an offer. It's a story a screenwriter would love, but it was forged in hard work for this now 20-year-old industry veteran. \"I was working very hard in Fin- land, hut I wanted more,\" Janita recalls. \"Leaving was a gamble. But it all worked out so well. Even I can't believe it.\" Janita's self-titled 550 Music debut is not a compilation or rehash of previ- ously released songs. Kaplan insisted upon fresh material, teaming her with several pro- janita ducers, including Tyrese Jones and Douglass. \"I haven't been this excited about an act since I signed Ginuwine,\" Kaplan says. \"I was intimately SNAKEFARM TURNS TO TRADITIONAL FOLK SONGS FOR DEBUT SET ON RCA (Continued from previous page) servicing advance copies of the CD to independent and major music re- tailers, the label is targeting art gal- leries, coffee shops, hair salons, and boutiques. As for radio, O'Sullivan finds it encouraging that \"NPR stations are already playing the record.\" For street-level promotion, RCA has aligned itself with tastemaking New York-based Giant Step Records for a two-month period this past fall to assist in setting the stage for Snakefarm. Giant Step made sure the set's first single, the promotional-only \"St. James,\" released Sept. 14 — with re- mixes by Gus Gus, Hypnogaja, John Tejada, and Skylab — was serviced to influential club DJs.

She definitely has her following. And from what I can tell, they won't be disappointed with Snakefarm. In fact, this project has the potential to bring new fans into the Domino camp.\" While the seeds for Snakefarm — managed by Los Angeles-based Queenpin Management and booked by Kneeling Elephant — were plant- ed t hree years ago, the idea of rein- terpreting a standard was not for- eign to Domino. She injected new life into Tennessee Ernie Ford's \"Sixteen Tons\" on her 1984 EP, \"Rythm.\" Domino was born in Tokyo and raised in Ann Arbor, Mich.; Flo- rence, Italy; Ottawa; and New York. Delory was born and raised in Ottignes, Belgium. These days, they call Borrego Springs, Calif., home. Originally, Snakefarm w T as to be a non-touring act. \"Too many ma- chines,\" Domino has said in the past, referring to the act's reliance on technology. Apparently, though, she's had a change of mind. \"Oh, we'll be touring,\" says the singer. \"The band will consist of [bassist] Paul Dugan and [guitarist) Stephen Ulrich, Michel, and myself. And the more I think about all the possibilities, the more excited I get.\" She continues, \"My job truly is fun, and this music [on the new al- bum] is such great stuff to dig into. Rhythm is so liberating. In fact, it's hilarious.\" involved in the A&R process. The pairing of Jimmy with Janita's longtime collaborator, Tomi Sach- ary, was incredible, because their sensibilities really complement each other. Tyrese, who is from the Boyz II Men camp, is also a natur- al choice for this project.\" What Janita, Kaplan, and the producers at hand created is an album steeped in soulful vocal sophistication that is beyond the young artist's years. How did Jani- ta get so funky? \"In Finland, I listened to soul music exclusively — people like Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, and Stevie Wonder,\" she says. \"When I came to New York, I knew I had to be a part of that sound, that expe- rience.\" Janita is quick to dismiss the genre-defining labels musicians face in this country. \"Music should be — and through- out the world usually is — a diverse medium,\" she says. \"People should, and do, listen to a variety of things. In this country, I have found the labeling is important only to people behind the scenes. The fans, the public, they want a variety of sounds.\" Kaplan agrees, adding that he \"wouldn't characterize this as R&B. It's sophisticated urban pop, or 'SUP' as I call it.\" While good fortune has helped Janita's career up to this point, the artist and the label aren't leaving anything else to chance. Janita will spend much of the first quarter of '99 trekking across the U.S. visit- ing radio and retail. Janita is managed by Larry Mazer at Entertainment Services Unlimited, and she is booked by Creative Artists Agency. amusement business ROXSCORE TOP 10 CONCERT GROSSES ARTIST(S) Venue DjWs) Gnu Attendance Ticket Priced] Capacity CELIHI DION ANDRE-PHILIPPE GAGNON Molsun Centre Dec 7-8.

To date, all three singles (\"C'est La Vie,\" \"Rollercoaster,\" and the current offering) have been No. Vb here, and they have also topped charts in Australia and New Zealand. To date, the global album sales — excluding North America — total 1.1 million, according to the label. In continental Europe, where B*Witched will be doing promotion in the first quarter, the act has notched gold album status (30,000 units sold) in Belgium, and 14,000 have sold in Italy. But Sony U.K. is reserving its firepower for the U.S. in the early months of 1999. Brian Yates, VP of international for Sony Music U.K., says support on the 'N Sync tour is the perfect vehicle for breaking the act in the world's largest market. However, the major is not relying on that alone and is also organizing a tie-in with Hello Kitty and the Fetish cosmetics brand. B'Witched posters will be dis- played in the windows of Hello Kit- ty's 125 free-standing stores, most- ly based in malls. Some 115,000 three-track B'Witched cassettes will be given away with purchases. \"It's encouraging that they've got a teen audience. We've always dealt with 1 1 - to 1 6-year-olds when marketing music,\" explains Yates. \"With this we're also looking at the 'tweenie' market,\" he adds, refer- ring to the 5- to 11-year-old and below age group. \"Those tweenies are becoming fashion conscious much earlier than we realize.\" The co-promotion deal with Fetish involves B'Witched appear- ing on point-of-sale material and cross-promotion of the music and the product. As in its European and Aus- tralasian promo jaunts, the act will target shopping malls on days when it plays U.S. locations. Trucks will visit the location in advance of the act's appearance and distribute B'Witched-branded cosmetics. Epic U.K.'s Stringer is keen to see whether \"C'est La Vie\" sticks at U.S. radio. \"With acts like the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, there's more radio formats to take on this kind of record,\" he says. Andrew Jave, PD/music director of WEOW Key West, Fla., agrees. \"They have a freshness that radio needs right now, but they're also in the pocket of current trends,\" he savs. B'Witched is managed by Tommy Jay Smith and Kim Glover of International Management. Smith says he saw the act in Dublin two years ago before it had a label or management deal. \"What was there was very raw, but they had written their own songs and rou- tines,\" he says. \"They had styled themselves. More to the point, they had huge ambition and drive.\" Mark Wood, singles product manager at the Our Price chain, says the act has a good chance of consolidating its position in the U.K. market. \"I think they're in for a good year,\" he says, noting the act's appeal to a new generation. \"The Spice Girls and All Saints are perhaps becoming a bit distant from the very young kids,\" Wood says. \"They're becoming more sophisticated — married to foot- ballers, pregnant, etc., and I see B'Witched as being their natural heirs. They're very much an upcoming 'just won the talent show' sort of band, and kids really like them.\" The appeal is broader than just kids, says Wood, whose chain has 250 stores and some 15% of the U.K. retail market, according to the British Phonographic Industry. (Continued on next imge) Ex-Strangler Has 2nd Solo Set Cornwell's 'Black Hair' Due From Velvet BY DAVID RICHARDS SILVKi: SPRING, Mil.— On Feb. 23, former Stranglers guitarist/ vocalist Hugh Cornwell issues his second U.S. solo collection, \"Black Hair,\" on Velvel Records. \"Black Hair\" is a reconfigura- tion of his fourth U.K. solo album, \"Guilty,\" which was released in 1997 on Snapper Records and received critical acclaim in Europe and the U.K. The U.S. version (reti- tled after one of that set's standout tracks) cop drops one track (\"Five Miles High\") and adds two brand- new cuts: the stunning ballad \"Jesus Will Weep\" and the rock- edged \"Not Hungry Enough.\" Cornwell left the Stranglers in 1990. By that time, the band had become a British institution. They released their debut album four months before the Sex Pistols and survived the U.K. pop scene for the next 13 years, racking up more than 30 chart hits. In the U.S., the band had its biggest hit with the modern rock staple \"Always The Sun,\" from the album \"Dreamtime.\" Cornwell left the Stranglers in 1990, much to the disappointment of many of the band's fans. \"The new album is a chance for me to come clean from all the bag- gage, the rumors, and innuendo I accumulated while with the Stran- glers,\" Cornwell says. After spending the '90s on a variety of pro- ell jects, including several solo albums and working on music for several U.K. televi- sion shows, Cornwell, who is man- aged by David Fagence, decided to go hack on the road with a four- piece I land last year. \"The album's producer, Laurie Latham, wanted to get me back to a rockier sound, using real drums, playing guitar,\" he says. \"1 really liked what came out of it.\" (Continued on next />iigi>) THE DEMON FAMILY ALBUM Demon is actively seeking masters and catalogue from existing established acts, for all territories world-wide Elvis Costello Nick Lowe Ai Green Marc Bolan & T Rex Crazy Cajun Hi Records Brunswick Records Orbison Records To see the full picture, contact Pete Macklin at Demon 6 The Green Richmond Surrey TW9 1PL Tel: +44 (0)181 948 0011 Fax: +44 (0)181 948 1698 or see him in person at MIDEM, stand no 09.08 Teh 0033 4929 98091 Demon is represented in the USA by John Umax III Fax: 001 615 356 4666 THE BIGGEST AND BEST DEMON CATALOGUE TO DATE IS OUT NOW BILLBOARD JANUARY 16, 1999 15 When the show hits the road, the music industry turns to the premier reference guide...The International Talent & Touring Directory.

Then in April I'll come back with a full band. I look forward to playing all sorts of stuff — my solo work and plenty of Stranglers.\" Cornwell will come to the States with built-in recognition, not only from his first solo album, 1988's \"Wolf\" (which was released on Vir- gin), but also from the large and rabid fan base the Stranglers still have. Last year saw the release of the Stranglers tribute album, \"No More Heroes\" (Elevator Music Records), and the band is a peren- nial fixture on '80s compilations, most recently on Rhino's forthcom- ing \"Post Punk Chronicles\" set. And, Cornwell notes, the Inter- net has allowed him to keep those fans informed of his new work. \"My Web site was listed as one of the world's top 1,000 music sites. The sheer amount of E-mail and posting it gets is amazing.\" Velvel plans to work the album via a multifaceted World Wide Web presence, an extensive street-level marketing campaign that includes a series of shows, and radio/retail visits. \"I realized the other day I've been recording for 20 years now, so it will be nice to tour the U.S. and look back,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I am ready to move for- ward. I think this record does a lit- tle bit of both for me.\" BEWITCHED (Continued from premous page) \"There's obviously a lot of people buying these records; they can't just be from that young age group. There just aren't enough of them. So they're obviously appealing to several different age groups.\" As for breaking in the U.S., the band members are determined to continue with their diligence. Their visibility will be aided by 30-second commercial running in movie the- aters showing \"Babe: Pig In The City\" and \"Prince Of Egypt.\" There will be a half-hour special on the Disney Channel in February. They've also been actively pro- moting the project in malls across Europe and the U.S., which has been hugely successful. Says Armaou, \"We had one in-store promo in Australia in a mall, and 6,000 people turned up, and we were going, 'Are you sure there's no one going on after us?' \" Assistance in preparing this story teas provided by Tom Ferguson in London. AND I- I I S< BY CATHERINE APPLEFELD OLSON Top THIS: After Sony Classical's \"Titanic\" plowed through virtually every existing sales record, and several weeks passed when you couldn't think of breaking into the top of The Billboard 200 unless you were a soundtrack, it's hard to imagine that 1999 could top the year gone by for soundtracks. Then again, that's what most of us have been saying every year for some time now. Let this soundtracks writer go on the record to say that 1999 will be yet another watershed year for the business of film music, albeit — we hope — with more discretion about which soundtracks get released and a cooling of the soundtrack-artist bidding wars, which were going through the roof at the end of 1998. The good news for labels large and small is that soundtracks (final- ly) are no longer considered poor stepchildren to films. And if a record company hits pay dirt during that ultra-limited window in which a soundtrack can break, soundtracks can be excellent profit centers. The bad news is that some studios and labels are still gun-shy about taking chances with soundtrack music, instead competing for a handful of artists. This process brings budgets and IOUs to levels that some independent labels with great ideas simply can't handle. It's too early to say whether the crop of first-look distribution deals — such as Mira- max's arrangement with Capitol and Universal comrades Jersey Films/ Jersey Records' pact with MCA — are helping or hurting the situation. Perhaps in 1999 the powers that be will seek to expand the soundtracks' gene pool a little bit After all, where was Marcy Playground before Jay Karris decided to put \"Sex & Candy\" on Mammoth/Capitol Records' excellent little \"Hurricane Streets\" soundtrack? Of course, big names usually sell, and judging by the biggest sound- tracks of 1998, the more the merrier was definitely the case. R&B/hip- hop-driven soundtracks continued to prove that they can sell big, regard- less of the niche nature of some of the films from which they're culled. Witness Interscope's red-hot \"Bulworth.\" Country artists also claimed a big share of the film-music scene, particularly with the success of Capitol's \"Hope Floats.\" But it was the turbo-charged pop and rock soundtracks — Warner SunsefReprise's \"City Of Angels,\" Columbia's \"Armageddon,\" and Epic's \"Godzilla\" among them — that led the way with loads of star power and killer singles. TV soundtracks came into their own in 1998, as did soundtrack sequels. This is despite the fact that both concepts hare generally had only luke- warm success. On the TV side, one of the more inventive and targeted soundtracks is American/Columbia's \"Chef Aid: The South Park Album.\" The number of TV soundtracks released last year was staggering. Same goes for \"soundtracks\" to computer games and other peripher- als, such as books. Although Virgin should be commended for trying something a bit different, the flat sales of its soundtracks to the cult video games \"Myst\" and \"Riven\" should be enough of a warning light for labels to keep their eyes on the silver screen, not the computer screen, for the near term. Sequels fared a little better, particularly given that motion pictures continue to pack more music cues than can be accommodated on one album and that the race to secure album rights often isn't completed by the original soundtrack's release date. The \"Boogie Nights\" follow- up is an excellent example of a sequel done right — as are Maverick Records' \"The Wedding Singer, Vol. 2\" and Mercury's sequel to \"The Full Monty.\" DreamWorks Records' decision not to string out its \"Prince Of Egypt\" albums, but rather release three soundtracks at the same time, seems to be faring well for that label. One exciting trend that picked up steam in 1998 and should continue this year is that of a single artist or act contributing all of the music to a given film. Current film music darling Shudder To Think had a two- play last year with its Velvel Records soundtrack to \"High Art\" and Epic's \"First Love, Last Rites.\" (For the latter film, the band called on a string of collaborators, including Billy (\"organ. Liz Phair, Nina Pers- son, and Robin Zander.) Public Enemy returned to the scene to do all of the non-score music for Spike Lee's \"He Got Game,\" released by Def Jam Records and less well-received than we think it should have been. The Red Elvises wrote and performed all the songs in Palm Pic- tures' \"Six-String Samurai,\" and director Richard Linklater called on Austin, Texas, act the Bad Livers to write a good chunk of the music for \"The Newton Boys,\" released by Sony Music Soundtrax. On the industry front, there were few state-of-the-business confer- ences that didn't at least include discussion of soundtracks. Film music even got a conference of its own in the Sound of Film industry panels and showcases created by New York-based KnitMedia. Here's to anoth- er powerful year in soundtracks. 16 BILLBOARD JANUARY 16, 1999 BILLBOARDS H E ATS E E K E R S, ALBUM CHART THIS WEEK LAST WEEK WKS, ON CHART COMPILED FROM A NATKNMAL SAMPLE OF RETAIL STORE, MASS MERCHANT, AND SQUQdSCan* INTERNET SALES REPORTS COLLECTED, COMPILED.

L.A.- based rapper Defari Is the newest member ot the Lik- wit Crew, which includes King T, Tha Alkaholiks, and Xzibit. But Defari, whose real name is Duane Johnson, isn't a typical rap artist: He's also a history teacher at Inglewood (Calif.) High School. His debut album, \"Focused Daily\" (Black Label/Tommy Boy), is due Feb. 9, and the video for \"Likwit Con- nection\" has been played on the Box and BET. Even with his budding hip-hop career, Defari says that for now, he's not giving up his day job. He notes, \"Even though I have two [col- lege] degrees ... so what? Once you get out of class, people are still struggling, a homeless man still needs money, and my rent is due.\" Brown developed her craft singing at nightclubs and restaurants in her native Iowa. After moving to Nashville in 1994, she signed a deal with Arista/ Nashville, which released her debut album, \"Tour Of My Heart\" in 1998. Her \"I Won't Lie\" single has made inroads on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, peaking at No. 58. The video has been in medi- um rotation on CMT. Brown could be considered some- one who's suffered for her art ... lit- erally. During the video shoot for \"I Won't Lie,\" her hair caught on fire. Luckily, she wasn't seriously injured, and we can hope that the only burning up Brown will do from now on is on the charts.
