        "text": "Miguel is always reinventing himself. He evolved from R&B hitmaker on his debut record “All I Want is You” to trippy experiments on “Kaleidascope Dream”, and it all culminates in one ball of gratification on “Wildheart,” his third release. The album teems with sexuality, introspection and self-reliance. His self-assured style is polished from his thematic fashion on tour to his heart-wrenching melodies. He’s authentic, believable and talented in a way that makes clear some are truly born with it.\n\nAhead of his show at Denver’s Ogden Theatre on Aug. 18, we spoke to Miguel about sexuality, life and fear.\n\nAre you satisfied with the way the audience is responding to the new material from “Wildheart” while on tour?\n\nYeah. The majority of what we’re performing is the new album and the response is insane. It’s a really good feeling because it’s a very different album than the last album and even more different from the one before it. You never know how the fans are going to embrace it right away or if it will take time to grow on them. It’s been a tremendous pleasure watching people really fall in love with the music.\n\n“Kaleidascope Dream” is way different than “Wildheart.” It feels like you broke out of a shell or a need to prove yourself.\n\nAny feeling that I had to do anything to satisfy someone else, I let that go. I don’t know if that makes any sense, but it was more that I didn’t want to feel like I was so serious all the time. I needed to convey that I’m an artist and a creative person and not just some R&B guy which is what a lot of people think based on my ethnicity and where I started. A lot of people kind of automatically go there because of the success of “Adorn.” That’s the song that people most know from me. In an effort to transcend that, I was a lot more conscious of doing things that defied those notions. I’m just doing whatever I want and allowing people to figure it out for themselves.\n\nIt’s interesting that the songs on “Wildheart” are so easily accessible. It’s easy to love each track different and feels existential at the same time.\n\nI mean, every song is just the wave. You gotta swim out to it and wait for it to hit you. I can’t say that there’s any clear cut or methodical process in the creative process. You just get in the studio and make yourself available to the idea and do your best to amplify it. I don’t know, there is a lot of sexuality in my music so I guess that’s kind of existential. I’m a very sexual person but there are some introspective moments as well. The first line on the album is “don’t ever sell yourself short,” but then there’s songs like “flesh” like, how do you dream and lose yourself in the journey called life or in a sexual space with a person. The song “leaves” is about change and how life evolves sometimes without warning. I think people look at the color of my skin and assume, which we do as human beings, certain things about me but when you kind of really take a listen, what my fans love the most is that they is a real dynamic that shows the layers of my personality.\n\nYou returned home to L.A. to write and record “Wildheart,” which is clear in the song choices and thems like “NWA” and “leaves.” How important was it to you to return to your roots for this third album?\n\nThe entire album I did at home in L.A. So it was really cool that somehow the attitude and the pace and the energy of my city became the backdrop of the album simply by being there. Which is kind of a subconscious thing but when you’re in the middle of it, it’s hard to not become a part of you. I wanted that very much for that album. For you too feel where I’m from and get a sense of where my roots are. I think life is really about staying true to what you already know. I think we’re kind of born with this sense of what we want when we’re young and somehow, sometimes, oftentimes, our circumstances our people around us, their personalities, can deter us from what we wanted in the beginning. We start to alter what we want based on what is supposed to be possible to us and that’s where shit gets really twisted because you start forgetting your own voice and the sound of your own voice and you start moving on a path that’s different from where you started. Life is all about getting back to that voice, one that’s your intuition, it’s who you are before all of the bullshit, it’s getting back to that. The more time that we spend figuring out who am I, what do I believe in? What is happiness to me, what is success to me, what is love to me, when we define ourselves we can make decision from a much deeper place.\n\nDo you think you’ve found parts of yourself to have evolved in the making of “Wildheart?”\n\nIn this place where I am now I’m more proud of who I am and my unique things and experiences and circumstances that brought me to this place. When we celebrate the things that make us different, . We’re less likely to pay attention to other’s definitions, no longer trying to conform to other people’s ideas. When you’re able to appreciate someone else and you’re giving off that energy, you automatically put people in a place where they can reciprocate that good energy."
