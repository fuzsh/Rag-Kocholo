        "text": "Introducing Risa Kumon, the multi-talented musician and media personality making waves in the world of R&B, Soul, and Jazz. Hailing from the culturally rich city of Sasebo, Nagasaki, Risa's musical journey began at a young age with piano lessons. Despite suffering from a bout of measles that temporarily took her eyesight as a child, Risa's love for music never diminished. She found solace in the sounds of legendary artists like Lauryn Hill, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, and Jazz artists her father would listen to.\n\nNow based in Tokyo, Risa's musical career has been soaring with the release of a Jazz EP, Christmas covers project, numerous collaborations, and an album with Roro. She continues to captivate audiences with her newest single \"FREE,\" which has already hit the top of the music charts in both Japan and the USA. The music video for \"FREE\" has also been officially selected for three film festivals around the world. But Risa's musical gifts go beyond the stage as she interviews famous musicians and entertainers on her multilingual radio shows.\n\nRisa's mission has always been to connect with her audience through her music, bridging cultural and linguistic barriers with her unique blend of sounds and voices. Get ready to discover the rising star that is Risa Kumon!\n\n1. When did you first develop a passion for your craft and what led you to pursue it as a career?\n\nMusic has been a constant in my life since I was a young age. My parents have told me that even before I started playing the piano at the age of 3, I had a love for music. Even in preschool, I was involved in musical activities and it seems like music has always been a part of my life. It brings me immense joy and I feel that it's a path that I was meant to walk.\n\n2. I came across information indicating that you sing in multiple languages. Could you specify which languages you are able to sing in?\n\nI mainly sing in English and Japanese, but I have also sung in Italian, Spanish, Hawaiian, and Okinawan language. I am versatile in my musical abilities and enjoy exploring different styles and languages to broaden my musical horizons.\n\n3. I've noticed that you often incorporate images of Japanese culture in your music, pictures, and videos, and it's clear that you have a deep appreciation and connection to your Japanese heritage. Would you mind sharing what specifically draws you to Japanese culture and inspires you to incorporate it into your creative work?\n\nBy embracing my heritage and showcasing the beauty of Japan through my art, I am not only honoring where I come from but also spreading a message of self-love and cultural pride. I believe that every individual has a unique story to tell and I am using my platform to share the rich history, traditions and vibrant spirit of Japan with the world. My aim is to inspire others to embrace their own roots and to showcase the diversity and beauty of our world.\n\n4. Given your deep appreciation and connection to Japanese culture, I'm curious to know your opinion on the best place to visit in Japan. In your view, which city or region in Japan would you recommend as a must-see destination for someone interested in experiencing the country's culture firsthand?\n\nWow, Japan is such a beautiful and culturally rich country, how do I even choose the best places to visit?! But if I had to pick, my top three are Kyushu, Okinawa, and Kyoto. Kyushu is just pure magic, with its breathtaking nature, hot springs, delicious food, and fresh air. Trust me, it's worth the trip just for that. And then there's Okinawa, where the beaches are so stunning, the sky is always painted in the most gorgeous colors, and the people are just so relaxed and carefree. I lived there once and it's a place I'll always hold dear in my heart. Last but not least, Kyoto. It's a city steeped in tradition, with its beautiful buildings, rich history, and an overall atmosphere that transports you back in time. But at the same time, it's so modern and forward-thinking. It truly is a magical place that strikes the perfect balance between the old and the new. Now, I know most people flock to Tokyo or Osaka, and don't get me wrong, those cities are amazing in their own right. But for me, it's these three that truly capture the essence of Japan and all its beauty.\n\n5. How has your experience been as a bilingual artist performing in both Japanese and English?\n\nAs a bilingual artist, I have had the privilege of reaching a wider audience through my ability to perform in both Japanese and English. This has allowed me to connect with fans from different cultural backgrounds and share my art with them in a language they are comfortable with. However, it also comes with its challenges as I have to constantly switch between the two languages, not just in my performances but also in my daily communication. It requires a lot of mental effort and discipline, but the reward of being able to connect with people from all over the world through my music makes it all worth it. Overall, it has been a unique and fulfilling experience.\n\n6. What do you think of the current Asian music scene?\n\nThe current Asian music scene is a beautiful symphony of diverse cultures and artistic expression. It's a celebration of the unique musical heritage of the region, where talented musicians are fearlessly showcasing their individuality and cultural roots to the world. No longer do they feel the need to mimic or conform to Western standards, but instead they are confidently paving their own path and elevating the Asian music scene to new heights.\n\nThis is a time of great creative energy and artistic freedom, where the beauty and diversity of Asian music is being showcased to the world with each country contributing its own unique flavor and style. From the traditional folk music of rural areas to the contemporary pop sounds of the cities, the Asian music scene is a true testament to the rich cultural tapestry of the region.\n\nWith the rise of streaming services and the internet, it has never been easier for the world to discover and enjoy the vast array of musical styles and genres that can be found across Asia. This is truly an exciting time for Asian music and its fans, as artists continue to push the boundaries and create new and innovative sounds that are capturing the hearts and minds of audiences everywhere.\n\n7. Why do you think there aren't a bunch of Asian artist blowing up in America?\n\nI believe that one of the main reasons why Asian artists may face challenges in making a big impact in America is due to language and cultural differences. However, I don't think this should hold them back. In fact, I believe that these differences are what make their music unique and special.\n\nEach Asian artist has their own experiences and perspectives, which is reflected in their music. While their style may not appeal to everyone, there will always be people who appreciate their work. Rather than seeing these differences as limitations, I think it's important to celebrate and embrace the diversity that Asian artists bring to the table.\n\nAs an Asian person myself, I am proud to see more representation and recognition for Asian artists in the mainstream music industry. By following their passions and staying true to themselves, they inspire us all to do the same and to never give up on our dreams. I believe that the love and appreciation for Japanese culture and its art can also extend to the music created by Asian artists.\n\nSo let's embrace the differences and allow the beauty and passion of their music to reach and inspire those who are ready to listen, including myself. As an avid music lover, I am always open to discovering new artists and sounds that may challenge my own perspectives and broaden my horizons.\n\n8. As an asian artist, what do you want to show to the world?\n\nAs an asian artist, I am driven to share with the world the brilliant beauty that exists in our culture, music, and world. I believe that as Japanese people, we often become so focused on what lies beyond our shores that we forget to cherish the extraordinary splendor that surrounds us. However, I am determined to use my art as a platform to inspire others to see the magnificence not just in Japan, but throughout Asia, and to encourage them to appreciate the rich tapestry of life that unfolds in front of us every day.\n\n9. Do you consider yourself a J-POP artist?\n\nI don't consider myself J-POP, but I do believe that the beauty of creativity lies in the ability to explore and push boundaries. My musical journey has led me to embrace various genres, including R&B, Soul, Jazz, POP and more, but that's not where it ends. I see every song as a canvas, an opportunity to showcase my artistry and express myself in the most authentic and dynamic way possible. While I have yet to delve into J-pop, I remain open to the endless possibilities of where my musical passions may take me. Who knows? Maybe one day, I'll grace the J-pop scene with my unique sound and inspire others to embrace their own creative journey without any limitations.\n\n10. Who are some Japanese individuals that have inspired you throughout your life? It could be someone you looked up to during your formative years or someone who continues to inspire you today.\n\nGrowing up, I was inspired by several Japanese individuals who made a significant impact in their respective fields. Firstly, I was deeply moved by the music of Joe Hisaishi, who is known for composing the iconic scores for Studio Ghibli films directed by Hayao Miyazaki. His masterful blend of classical and electronic music has created a distinct and unforgettable sound that has captured the hearts of many around the world. Along with the music, the imaginative storytelling and unique visuals in Miyazaki's films like \"Kiki's delivery service\" and \"Porco Rosso\" have also had a profound influence on my creativity and passion for storytelling.\n\nAnother Japanese artist who influenced me was Misia, a singer who had a significant impact on the Japanese and Asian music scenes. With her soulful voice and new sound, she changed the J-pop and R&B genres in Japan, breaking barriers and paving the way for other artists. To this day, her style and powerful voice continues to inspire new generations of artist.\n\nThese individuals, and many others, have not only left an indelible mark on the world of music and film, but have also served as an inspiration to countless people around the world who have been touched by their work.\n\n11. What steps do you take to stay connected with your fans, both in Japan and abroad?\n\nMaintaining a strong connection with my supporters is my top priority! I want to be accessible and interactive with my audience, and I achieve this by utilizing various methods. One of my main ways of connecting is through social media platforms. I keep active on both Japanese and English platforms to reach a wide audience and share my music, updates, and behind-the-scenes moments in a language they are comfortable with.\n\nI also take part in international radio shows, which give me the chance to directly engage and share my music on a global scale. Building a tight-knit community with my supporters is crucial for me, and I'm always on the lookout for new and creative ways to connect with them.\n\n12. Can you tell us about your bilingual radio shows and what inspired you to start them?\n\nAs a radio host, I host three shows: R2 Radio, Risa's Select, and Trendy Pickups by Risa & Roro. R2 Radio is a global program that features interviews with guests from the entertainment industry, and it focuses on music, art, culture, and trends. It is available to an international audience with subtitles in both Japanese and English. On the other hand, Trendy Pickups is more Japanese-centric, with a touch of English, and it is broadcast from Tokyo's popular commercial radio station, Interfm89.7mhz. Meanwhile, Risa's Select is a personally curated program that covers a variety of topics.\n\nI started these shows with my partner, Rolandis \"Roro\" Ramsey because we wanted to offer a unique perspective on arts, culture, and entertainment from our perspectives. I believe that these topics play an important role in our lives and I wanted to share my love for them with the world. By offering a variety of shows with different styles and contents, I aim to bring fresh and engaging content to my audience. You can find more information about these shows on my website at r2radiojp.com!\n\n13. What inspired the video for your single \"Free\"?\n\nThe music video for 'Free' is a creative representation of my vision for true freedom. The concept explores the idea of connection beyond dimensions, as I delve into themes of creation, the meaning of existence, and the search for a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. With my Japanese heritage in mind, I sought to incorporate symbols that reflect the beauty and wonder of Japan, including the majestic Mt. Fuji and the iconic red dress, which is the color of the red dot in the Japanese flag. My goal with this video was to create an immersive experience for the viewer, allowing them to interpret and create their own unique story and meaning through the visual journey. I believe that art should not only entertain, but also inspire and provoke thought, and that is what I aim to achieve with this music video for 'Free'.\n\n14. Any final words or thoughts to share with your fans and supporters?\n\nPlease check out my latest single \"FREE\" if you haven't already gotten a chance. It's a groovy R&B track that I hope will bring a smile to your face. And here's some exciting news for all my vinyl collectors out there: on Record Store Day (4-22-2023), the official 7-inch single for \"FREE\" will be available in record stores all across Japan and other places around the world! This year, \"FREE\" has been added to the list of vinyl coming out from Japan at \"RECORD STORE DAY JAPAN 2023\", which is a festival of analog records on April 22. So, mark your calendars, and don't miss the chance to add this limited-edition vinyl to your collection.\n\nLastly, I want to thank you all for your support and love. My message to my listeners is to always believe in themselves and never give up on their dreams. No matter what challenges they may face, they have the power to make a positive impact on the world. I also want to encourage them to embrace their individuality and celebrate the unique qualities that make them who they are. If my music can bring a little bit of joy into someone's day, then I consider my job done.\n\nMusic video | Streaming | Website\n\nInstagram: @RisaKumon\n\nFB: @RisaKumonofficial\n\nTW: @RisaKumon"
