        "text": "In reaction to the thread about H.E.R. where people complain about the blandness of stars like John Legend and Alicia Keyes, I created this thread to highlight some of the better (IMHO of course ) R&B tracks and artists I ran into in the last 5 years.\n\nPersonally I think R&B is on it's way up again, I notice a lot of the newer, more leftfield R&B and hiphop artists put more real instruments and a bit of funk in their tunes and it makes for better music IMO. Although still quite hard work, I found it much easier to find fun, interesting new music in the last few years than in the 20 years before.\n\nSome of the tunes I post here feature rap as well as singing, but are still fun and funky. Hope you will enjoy some of them and let me know what you think.\n\nJazmine Sullivan - Pick Up Your Feelings (Official Acoustic Live Video): Jazmine Sullivan - Pick U...ive Video). She's been around for a while, but this performance is another one that I keep returning to. Impeccable singing and gorgeous guitar playing. Great lyrics as well.\n\nLucky Daye - How Much Can A Heart Take (Audio) ft. Yebba Lucky Daye - How Much Can... ft. Yebba. This is one of his latest, together with the great Yebba. This one has been on repeat for months in my home. Love the groove, the singing, the production, the 'weird' ending, all of it actually. Lucky has a few more song I like a lot, like \"Roll Some Mo'\" (gorgeous video!) and\n\nJoyce Wrice- \"On One\" Ft. Freddie Gibbs (Official Music Video): https://www.youtube.com/w...LMxnDuQCJg. This tune is very \"end of the 90's\" sounding. Although it pretty slick/commercial, it has a great groove, great production and a very catchy chorus. Freddie is great too in the rap segment. The song makes me feel like summertimes and happiness.\n\nKali Uchis - After The Storm ft. Tyler, The Creator, Bootsy Collins: https://www.youtube.com/w...f5zD7ZSNpQ. This is one of my absolute favorites, so catchy and so well produced. I play this one over and over again and still don't get enough if it. Great message too! And it has a little Bootsy in there. I love everything about it. Plus the video is amazing.\n\nThe Internet - Girl (Official Video) ft. KAYTRANADA https://www.youtube.com/w...mY8mG4_3j4. One of the older ones in this list, but still very good and I still listen to it regularly.\n\nSnoh Aalegra - Whoa: https://www.youtube.com/w...zRh6Eon5DQ. Not as funky perhaps as some of the others, a bit more modern sounding production, but I still love it. This song calms my spirit. There is a great (longer) remix with Pharrell Williams which is my favorite version of this song.\n\nCommon - What Do You Say (Move It Baby) ft. PJ (Official Music Video) Common - What Do You Say ...sic Video). Of course Common is hardly a newcomer (and is a hiphop artist), but PJ's singing gives it that catchy hook. Plus that bassline is funky as hell. The drumbeat chugs on nicely. Great tune just to vibe to IMO.\n\nMac Miller - Dang! (feat. Anderson .Paak) [Official Music Video] Mac Miller - Dang! (feat....sic Video]. \"Anderson .Paak is a cheat code\" I once read in a YT comment and IMO this is absolutely true. Such a talented musician/singer/performer! This tune with the deceased Mac Miller is just so chill and vibey and summery. I missed it when it came out but since I found it haven't stopped playing this track. Fun video too!\n\nI could go on for a while, but I will leave it at this selection.\n\nRIP Prince: thank U 4 a funky Time..."
