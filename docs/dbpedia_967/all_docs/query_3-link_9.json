        "text": "Humans experience multiple forms of vocality not only through encounters with each other but also with other animals (e.g. the crying wolf), and in moving through natural environments (e.g. the howling wind). Music likewise affords varied opportunities to experience and express ourselves as vocalizing beings, giving rise to complex relationships between speaking, singing and playing musical instruments. This piece considers the built-in percussiveness of the piano against the aesthetic prestige of lyricism-that is, 'songfulness'-as it encodes ableist choreographies on the part of the pianist. Disabled performers whose embodied relationships to their instrument transgress the corporeal biases of piano performance and pedagogy thus defy the aesthetic limits of normative lyricism: by foregrounding interstitial gesture, and multi-sensory expression, they envoice a new aesthetic that I call 'disabled songfulness'. Their pianistic voices, I argue, reach beyond stage and studio, refusing containment within the sensory hierarchies out of which music is often made. In piano pedagogy, performance and reception, discourses associated with achieving a singing tone normalize tonal beauty. A great deal of the work for pianists in the performing traditions that prize cantabile style, and the discourses that support it, lies in resisting the instrument's percussive KeywordS disability lyricism percussiveness piano technique resistance normalization embodiment aesthetics\n\nThe uncontrollability of the pop body has been a persistent feature since its early days. From 'All shook up' in the United States (1956) and Johnny Kidd and the Pirates' 'Shaking all over' (1960) in Britain, songs about uncontrollable neurological tremors, as physical symptoms conflating the ecstasy of sexual attraction and of dance, are heard from rock and roll on--and are themselves prefigured in the pleasure and fear of the transcendent body in the jazz and dance musics of the first half of the 20th century as well. There are identifiable and powerful links between popular music and the damaged, imperfect, deviant, extraordinary body or voice, which can be, and surprisingly often is, a disabled body or voice; these links have been overlooked in much critical writing about popular music. The purpose of this special edition of Popular Music, then, the articles in which come from a call for papers I put out in 2006, is to explore the common cultural and social territory of popular music and disability, which has been a hitherto neglected topic. This edition of the journal is situated at a nexus of disciplinary or sub-disciplinary concerns: disability studies, popular music studies (including musicology), cultural studies, performance studies, gender studies, and theory. It is intended as a timely musical contribution to the critical dialogue of recent years around disability culture, as one corrective to popular music studies¿ relative silence here.\n\nby Kelsie Acton, Caroline Howarth and Mieko Ouchi The aesthetics of accessibility, where considerations of access shape both the creation and presentation of a production, are a driving force in Canadian Deaf and disability theatre (Canada Council, 2012). In this article, we reflect on sound, music, access and audism in Songs My Mother Never Sung Me a bilingual American Sign Language (ASL) and sung English chamber opera written and composed by Dave Clarke and produced by Concrete Theatre at the SOUND OFF: A Deaf Theatre Festival in 2019. This fictionalized memoir is based on Clarke’s experience as a CODA (Child of Deaf Adult) and explores the complex relationship of a hearing boy and his Deaf mom. In this piece music and sound are not only aural elements, but are also tactile vibration, visual projection, and rhythmic ASL. This convergence of the senses expands conceptions of sound and music to comment on the inequality of Deaf and hearing access in the world beyond theatre production as audience position and ASL comprehension gave audiences differing access to the tactile vibration and ASL.\n\nOne of our basic needs as human beings is to be connected with each other. We want to be heard and understood. Our bodies are capable of producing a great variety of different vocal sounds for our communication. However, we have countless unspoken norms in our culture about who can use their voices, in what kind of situations, and in what ways. These norms are usually based on the skills and abilities of a \" normal body \". They are maintained by the conventions of listening that focus on the vocal sounds and skills. This is especially the case what comes to singing. The nonnormative voices and bodies are easily left outside the realm of aesthetic expression. In this article, I discuss these issues from the somaesthetic and pragmatist point of view using a deaf popular music singer as my example.\n\nMusic composition for the deaf is considered with a view to broadening the understanding of composition in general by regarding musical perception as a whole-body experience, i.e., a &#39;sense ensemble&#39; involving all the senses in its creation and appreciation. This line of inquiry is grounded on the following arguments, derived from embodied cognition and neuroscientific research: 1) music is fundamentally a whole-body, physical experience, 2) the senses work collaboratively in the perception of music (cross-modality) and 3) the cognitive apparatus for experiencing music is developed from infancy into adulthood through specifically human relationships (intersubjectivity/social cognition). A compositional study was devised to test a cross-modal harmonic and intersubjective approach to music through an interactive performance that involved no spoken or written language. Qualitative assessment of this cross-modal, intersubjective experience was to be drawn through feedback from p..."
