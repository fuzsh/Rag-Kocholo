Let your passion guide you as you create music that touches hearts and leaves a lasting impression.\n\nTai Andrews\n\nlet’s dive deeper.\n\nWhat is R&B?\n\nR&B, or Rhythm and Blues, is a genre deeply rooted in African American music traditions. It combines elements of gospel, jazz, and blues. For artists like Summer Walker, SZA, and Giveon, R&B provides a rich musical canvas.\n\nR&B is characterized by:\n\nEmotional Singing: Artists convey deep emotions through their vocals, making it a genre that thrives on passion and vulnerability.\n\nIrresistible Beats: R&B’s rhythms make you want to move, giving it a distinct groove.\n\nCatchy Melodies: Memorable and sultry melodies are a hallmark of contemporary R&B.\n\nR&B has evolved into various styles, from soul and funk to disco, neo-soul, and contemporary R&B. Legendary figures like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and Michael Jackson have paved the way for modern stars like Bruno Mars, Beyoncé and The Weeknd.\n\nToday’s talents such as SZA, Summer Walker, Giveon, Khalid, Bryson Tiller, Lucky Daye, and Snoh Aalegra continue to shape the genre with fresh approaches.\n\nAt its core, R&B explores themes of love, heartbreak, and relationships. It’s a universal language that touches the soul and makes you feel good, as Marvin Gaye once sang.\n\nInstant Cheat Sheet: Premade R&B Beats\n\nEver find yourself staring at an empty sheet of paper, with nothing but a blank canvas and a blank mind? If you’re a songwriter who struggles with writer’s block, pre-made beats can be your secret weapon to unlock creativity and ignite your musical spark.\n\nPre-made beats act like springboards for your songwriting journey, providing a solid rhythm and vibe to guide your creative flow.\n\nInstead of getting overwhelmed by creating a beat from scratch, you can focus on the heart of your song – the lyrics, melodies, and emotions you want to express. Using these can help you learn how to write an RnB song.\n\nTo learn how to use instrumental R&B beats to make a great song, check out this article: How to Use R&B Instrumental Beats to Make a Song at Home.\n\nHere are some of my beats you should check out:\n\nYou can download free versions of my beats, or purchase a license to use them commericial via the player below.\n\nHow to Write an R&B Song: The Basics\n\nR&B Song Structure and Music\n\nThe Verse – Telling the Story\n\nThe Verse – Where the Story Starts\n\nThink of the verse in an R&B song as the beginning of a story. It’s usually a short part with a consistent melody and rhythm.\n\nThis is where the singer gets creative. They use comparisons, clever wordplay, and colorful descriptions to make the story interesting. It’s like a canvas where they paint their feelings and experiences for you to hear.\n\nMetaphors help express complex emotions, wordplay adds a fun twist, and descriptive words make you feel like you’re part of the story. The verse is where the singer connects with you, setting the stage for what comes next in the chorus. It’s the start of the story and the journey of emotions.\n\nUsing Sza as an example again. SZA’s verses in “Good Days” are a masterclass in R&B storytelling. The lyrics are introspective and contemplative, touching on themes of self-discovery and personal growth.\n\nLines like “I still wanna try, still believe in good days” convey a sense of hope and resilience, a common thread in modern R&B songs.\n\nThe Pre-Chorus – Build Anticipation\n\nThe pre-chorus is an optional section that comes before the chorus. It’s usually a short part that transitions from the verse to the chorus, building anticipation and excitement for the main hook.\n\nThe pre-chorus can use different chords, melodies, and rhythms than the verse and chorus, creating contrast and tension. It can also introduce a new lyrical idea or theme, setting up the chorus.\n\nFor example, in “No Guidance” by Chris Brown and Drake, the pre-chorus features a catchy melody and a clever wordplay on the word “guidance”, leading to the chorus that expresses their confidence and charisma.\n\nThe Chorus – The Heart of the Song\n\nThe chorus is the emotional core of your song, repeating several times to create a lasting impact. It usually consists of four to eight lines, each with a different melody and rhythm compared to the verse.\n\nIn “Say My Name” by Destiny’s Child, the use of repetition and contrast ensures a memorable and emotional chorus.\n\nSay my name, say my name\n\nIf no one is around you, say “Baby, I love you”\n\nIf you ain’t runnin’ game\n\nSay my name, say my name\n\nYou actin’ kinda shady, ain’t callin’ me baby\n\nWhy the sudden change?\n\nSay My Name, Destiny’s Child\n\nThe chorus in “Girls Need Love” is where Summer Walker’s emotive vocals take center stage. With lines like “Girls can’t never say they want it, girls can’t never say how,” the chorus encapsulates the song’s message of desire and the importance of open communication in relationships.\n\nThe repetition and Summer Walker’s evocative delivery make it the emotional core of the song, resonating with listeners who can relate to its themes.\n\nThe Bridge – Adding Variety and Tension\n\nThe bridge introduces variety and tension into your song. It typically appears after the second or third chorus and differs significantly from the verse and chorus in terms of melody, rhythm, and chord progression.\n\nThe bridge can be used to change the mood, perspective, or direction of your song, adding a twist or a surprise. It can also be used to heighten the emotion, drama, or climax of your song, leading to the final chorus.\n\nFor example, in “Halo” by Beyoncé, the bridge features a key change and a soaring vocal, creating a powerful and uplifting moment.\n\nThe Outro – Making a Lasting Impression\n\nThe outro is your song’s conclusion, wrapping up the message and leaving a lasting impact. It can repeat the chorus, offer a variation of the intro, or introduce a new section.\n\nFor instance, in “I Will Always Love You” by Whitney Houston, the outro repeats the chorus with a more powerful vocal, fading out with a long and powerful note, creating a dramatic and emotional ending.\n\nMelody: The Soul of an R&B Song\n\nWhat’s the secret to making an R&B song stand out and stay in your memory? It’s the tune. Imagine the tune as the heartbeat of the song, the part that lingers in your mind even after the music has faded away.\n\nThe tune sets the mood for the entire song, like the background in a painting that creates the overall feeling. When the tune is catchy and stays with you, it’s like a pleasant memory that’s not easy to forget.\n\nSo, when you come across a fantastic tune in an R&B song, it’s akin to the joy you feel when you hear your favorite song. It remains with you long after the music has ended. That’s what makes R&B music so unforgettable and special.\n\nChords: Adding Depth and Emotion\n\nR&B songs use special chords to add depth and emotion to the music.\n\nThe following table summarizes these chord elements:\n\nScales: Crafting a Unique Character\n\nR&B melodies draw from specific scales that give the music its unique character. Here are some essential scales:\n\nDorian Mode: This scale adds a soulful and jazzy touch to the song, creating a distinctive R&B sound.\n\nMixolydian Mode: It infuses a bluesy and groovy feel, contributing to the genre’s unique groove.\n\nBlues Scale: This scale brings deep emotions into R&B music, connecting with listeners on a profound level.\n\nProgression: Creativity and Unpredictability\n\nR&B progressions are known for their creativity and unpredictability. Here’s how they achieve this:\n\nSmooth Transitions: Chords flow seamlessly from one to the next, creating a melodic and connected feel.\n\nSurprising Chord Choices: R&B often uses unexpected chords, adding excitement and freshness to the music.\n\nReimagined Classics: Musicians in R&B put their twist on classic chord patterns, like the ii-V-I progression, combining familiarity with innovation.\n\nHow to Write an R&B Chorus\n\nCrafting a catchy R&B chorus is essential for any songwriter or producer. In this concise guide, we’ll explore the essential steps to create an unforgettable R&B chorus, drawing from my extensive experience in beat production and songwriting.\n\nStep 1: Repetition for Catchiness\n\nRepetition is a fundamental technique in R&B music. It’s the secret sauce that makes a chorus memorable. For instance, in Usher’s “Yeah!”, he repeats “yeah” three times, creating an effective hook. To make your R&B chorus catchy:\n\nRepeat Key Words or Phrases: Choose a central word or phrase from your song and use repetition in the chorus to make it memorable.\n\nStep 2: The Art of Rhyming\n\nRhyming is essential for a smooth and harmonious R&B chorus. In Alicia Keys’ “No One,” words like “one,” “done,” and “sun” are rhymed to perfection. To add rhythm and flow to your chorus:\n\nIdentify Rhyming Words: Find words in your lyrics that naturally rhyme, enhancing the musical quality of your chorus.\n\nStep 3: Embrace Simplicity\n\nSimplicity often works best in R&B music. Keep your chorus straightforward and relatable. Remember, less is more when crafting a memorable chorus:\n\nKeep It Simple: Use clear and impactful language that resonates with your audience, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\nHow to Write an R&B Verse\n\nCreating a great R&B verse is important. Here’s how to do it with simple tips:\n\nStick to the Theme: Make sure your verse fits with what your song is about. Don’t talk about unrelated things; it confuses people. For example: Good Verse: “We danced all night under the city lights, your smile shining bright, everything feels right.” This is good because it fits the love theme and creates a nice picture. Bad Verse: “I went to the store, bought more, the sky was blue, tied my shoe, my dog barked, people walked through, I forgot my line, it’s all askew.” This verse is bad because it talks about unrelated things and is confusing.\n\nGet Their Attention: Start your verse with a catchy line. It’s like a hook that grabs your listeners.\n\nPaint Pictures: Use words that help people imagine what’s happening in your verse.\n\nUse Cool Words: Try comparing things in a neat way or using words that have more than one meaning. It makes your verse more interesting.\n\nMake It Flow: Each line should fit well with the one before and after. Your verse should tell a clear story or message.\n\nShare Your Feelings: Put your own experiences and emotions into your verse. It makes your music relatable and real.\n\nKeep Improving: Don’t be afraid to change and make your verse better. Sometimes, the best lines come after a few tries.\n\nBy following these simple steps and looking at the examples, you can write verses that connect with your audience and make your R&B song shine.\n\nHow to Write an R&B Bridge\n\nCreating a strong R&B bridge is important to keep your audience engaged. Here are easy steps to make a powerful bridge:\n\nChange It Up: Make the bridge different from the rest of the song. Use a unique melody, rhythm, or instruments to grab attention.\n\nBuild Tension: Create excitement with your lyrics, melodies, or chords. The bridge should get listeners excited for the final chorus.\n\nMake It Emotional: Focus on the main emotion of your song in the bridge. Talk about a feeling or experience that matches the song’s message.\n\nAdd Vocal Flair: Try vocal techniques like harmonies, ad-libs, or vocal runs to bring emotion to the bridge.\n\nHow to Write an R&B Outro\n\nA memorable R&B outro leaves a strong impression. Here’s how to create a great outro:\n\nWrap It Up: Summarize your song’s main message or theme in the outro. Make sure your listeners understand what the song is about.\n\nShow Emotion: Focus on the song’s main feeling in the outro. You can do this with your singing style or instruments.\n\nFade Out Smoothly: Gradually lower the volume of the music to give your song a nice ending.\n\nFinal Chorus Twist: Consider going back to the final chorus but with a new twist in your singing or music.\n\nRepeat Hooks: Repeating a catchy phrase from your song in the outro makes it more memorable.\n\nInstrumental Outros: If your song is mainly music, use the outro to show off your musical skills with a cool instrumental solo.\n\nHow to Write an R&B Song: Capturing the Feel\n\nStep 1: Feel the Emotion\n\nImmerse yourself in the emotions of your R&B song. Think about your personal experiences or universal feelings that can connect with your audience.\n\nStep 2: Choose the Right Scale\n\nPick an R&B scale that fits the mood of your song. You can go for the Dorian, Mixolydian, or blues scale to give your song that soulful touch.\n\nStep 3: Add Rich Chords\n\nUse R&B chords and extensions to add depth and richness to your music. Try major 7th, minor 7th, and other extended chords to create that R&B flavor.\n\nStep 4: Create Harmonic Progressions\n\nExperiment with R&B progressions to establish the foundation of your song. Smooth voice leading and unexpected chord changes can make your song stand out.\n\nStep 5: Craft Soulful Melodies\n\nCreate melodies that showcase your vocal style and emotion. Use techniques like melisma and vocal runs to add that R&B flair.\n\nStep 6: Write Authentic Lyrics\n\nCompose lyrics that reflect R&B themes like love, heartbreak, and self-reflection. Use imagery and storytelling to connect with your audience.\n\nStep 7: Blend R&B with Modern Production\n\nCombine traditional R&B elements with modern production techniques to create a contemporary sound. Experiment with electronic textures, effects, and innovative rhythms to give your song a fresh twist.\n\nHow to Write R&B Lyrics\n\nWords to Use in an R&B Song\n\nR&B lyrics often use a special vocabulary that sets the tone for the genre’s soulful and heartfelt vibe. Here are some popular words and phrases that are commonly used in R&B music and why they add depth and authenticity to your lyrics:\n\nMetaphors and Similes: R&B songwriters often use metaphors and similes to compare their emotions and experiences to natural elements or everyday objects. For instance, “Love is like a warm summer breeze” or “My heart is a broken record” are classic metaphors that evoke the intensity of love and the pain of heartbreak.\n\nPhonological Devices: R&B lyrics often utilize phonological devices, such as alliteration (the repetition of consonant sounds) and assonance (the repetition of vowel sounds), to create a smooth and melodic flow.\n\nImagery and Sensory Details: R&B lyrics often paint vivid pictures in the listener’s mind by using imagery and sensory details. For instance, describing the “taste of your lips, a sweet summer kiss” or “the scent of your perfume, a lingering bliss” allows the listener to connect with the story on a deeper level.\n\nIdioms and Slang: R&B music has its own unique slang and idioms that add a touch of authenticity and relatability. For example, phrases like “feeling down but you’re the sunshine after the rain” or “so smitten, I can’t help but put a ring on it” are common in R&B lyrics and instantly connect with listeners who share the same experiences.\n\nMusical Terms and References: Subtle references to musical terms or concepts can add depth and credibility to your R&B lyrics. For instance, using phrases like “funky groove” or “sweet harmonies” subtly showcases your knowledge of the genre and enhances the overall R&B vibe of your song.\n\nCrafting a Compelling Story\n\nR&B songs often tell relatable stories that resonate with listeners. Here are some tips for crafting a compelling narrative in your R&B lyrics:\n\nStructure and Pacing: R&B songs typically follow a clear structure, often with verses, bridges, and a chorus. The verses tell the story, the bridges provide emotional depth, and the chorus summarizes the main theme.\n\nRelateability: The story should be something that others can understand or connect with. Think about universal emotions or experiences that people can relate to, such as love, loss, or the challenges of life.\n\nCharacter Development: If your song has characters, develop them in a way that makes them relatable and believable. Show their thoughts, feelings, and actions so that listeners can connect with them on an emotional level.\n\nVivid Storytelling: Use vivid imagery and descriptive language to paint a picture in the listener’s mind. Use sensory details, such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures, to immerse the listener in the story.\n\nExample: In Mary J. Blige’s “Real Love,” she tells a story of a woman facing the ups and downs of a relationship. It’s relatable because many people have been through similar experiences.\n\nBy following these simple tips and using examples, you can create R&B lyrics that express your feelings and tell stories people can connect with. Keep it real and let your creativity flow.\n\nHow To Improve Your R&B Songwriting\n\nPlay Some R&B\n\nTo get inspired to write your own R&B songs, listen to some of the greats!
