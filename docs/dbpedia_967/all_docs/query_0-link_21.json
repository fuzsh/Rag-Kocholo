        "text": "I'm very happy to say our chart has 300 records again! I'm also glad to provide you with more album descriptions (there will be twenty this time) and, naturally, a genre and a label next to every album. I always want this chart to be a discovery service for you. I don't want to repeat what everyone has. Many of these \"must haves\" aren't really good, anyway.\n\nA propos: don't look for Beyonce's album. I find the latest release from the artist, who used to put her records in our TOP 10s, unlistenable. I don't know what happened there.\n\nIt's not all what we've prepared for you when it comes to year-end posts! Our EP chart, music awards and more will be posted next week! And sorry for being so late. We've been having problems with our social media access and we've only come back to Twitter after a week.\n\nSaying this, you can now also follow me on Post https://post.news/mavoyofficial\n\nand Mastodon.https://mastodon.online/@MavoyOfficial\n\n20 SAY SHE SHE – PRISM\n\nThe most surprising debut of the year, the three girls from America, cultivating traditions of 00s R&B and neo-soul. This record is very well-produced and creatively eclectic.\n\nhttps://saysheshe.bandcamp.com/album/prism\n\n19 DANGER MOUSE AND BLACK THOUGHT – CHEAT CODES\n\nI’ve enjoyed solo records put out by Black Thought in last few years – while anticipating new Roots album, apparently scheduled to be released next year. But I think his collaboration with Danger Mouse is probably the best one yet, not only thanks to great guest appareances from likes of Michael Kiwanuka, A$AP Rocky and even the amazing post-humous cameo from MF DOOM himself.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/0rEbmIQjHTKzKraH4UqiDy\n\n18 BRIAN ENO – FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE\n\nThe master of ambient released what could be one of the best records in his discography, at the same dystopian and definitely looking for the light in the sky. This reflective albums makes particularly great use of guest vocals by his daughter Daria, but Brian is also using his own vocals for the first time in a while.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1fsGRseH9xCUSiO1MDSB7W\n\n17 KLAUS SCHULZE – DEUS ARRAKIS\n\nI wasn’t an expect of Klaus Schulze music, but the release of the film Dune got me into Dune-themed albums, including his 1979 record titled Dune. Schulze passed away in 2021, but before his death he returned to the planet of sand in this collection of his final recordings, that could be indeed a soundtrack to Dune film – they also recall Blade Runner.\n\nhttps://klausschulze.bandcamp.com/album/deus-arrakis\n\n16 SHARON VAN ETTEN – WE’VE BEEN GOING ABOUT IT ALL WRONG\n\nI honestly think the best song released by Sharon Van Etten this year wasn’t included in the standard edition of her album and it only surfaced on its deluxe edition released in autumn. I’m talking, naturally, about Portra. We’ve Been Going is still a worthy follow-up to Remind Me Tomorrow, even if I think it’s not as strong.\n\nhttps://sharonvanetten.bandcamp.com/\n\n15 LITTLE SIMZ – NO THANK YOU\n\nSimilarly to Sharon, I don’t necessarily think that No Thank You is as amazing as its predecessor, which is still one of the best rap albums released this past few years. I don’t like maybe two songs on it, but the rest makes it up for it, confirming amazing songwriting skills of Simz. I’m also happy to just include this surprising release here, unlike way too many websites who published their lists too early.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/57263zG8Md6XZ9lBUPPYCm\n\n14 TOTALLY ENORMOUS EXTINCT DINOSAURS – WHEN THE LIGHTS GO\n\nThe last album released by Orlando before this record was published in 2012. While some were wondering if the producer was retired, TEED released a couple solo releases, an EP and now, finally, an album, featuring some of his best tracks, like Crosswalk, Blood In The Snow and Be With You. It’s the best dancefloor album of the year.\n\nhttps://totallyenormousextinctdinosaurs.bandcamp.com/album/when-the-lights-go\n\n13 NICK CAVE AND WARREN ELLIS – TWO SCORES: DAHMER MONSTER AND BLONDE\n\nIn a way, this was the year of Nick Cave, again, thanks to his brilliant conversation book Faith, Hope & Carnage, which I’ve already read and I believe it’s a masterpiece. But obviously, without diminishing the role that Warren Ellis has in composing the music, Cave is also a co-creator of film scores for two projects this year – Blonde and Dahmer Monster (I didn’t intend to watch this series, but I heard the soundtrack).\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/0iWf4fEHwkLXSHoHunjwtt\n\nhttps://invada.bandcamp.com/album/blonde-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-film\n\n12 FATHER JOHN MISTY – CHLOE AND THE NEXT 20TH CENTURY\n\nJosh Tillman, the songwriter mostly accociated with folk and folk rock music continued his interest in jazz music with his new release. From his friends, Lana Del Rey fits particularly well with this type of sound, it’s no wonder than Lana makes a guest appearance on this album. However, even more lyrical, less cynical Father John didn’t abandon his folk influences – the song Q4 is wonderfully Rubber Soul-like.\n\nhttps://fatherjohnmisty.bandcamp.com/album/chlo-and-the-next-20th-century\n\n11 YUMI ZOUMA – PRESENT TENSE\n\nI love Yumi Zouma and I loved the album Truth Or Consequences especially. Present Tense is a great sequel for it. The band cancelled their Polish performance this year, but I’ll be doing a lot to get them here again.\n\nhttps://yumizouma.bandcamp.com/album/present-tense\n\n10 KELLY LEE OWENS – LP.8\n\nWhen this record was released, I noticed some longtime Kelly’s fans were suddenly complaining that her music was becoming too experimental for their tastes. I think it’s a natural progression for th2e producer who made her first steps in music by collaborating with Jon Hopkins and Daniel Avery. Now, even still working with the same artists, Owens is extraordinary in her own right.\n\nhttps://kellyleeowens.bandcamp.com/album/lp-8\n\n9 JO YEONG-WOOK & THE SOUNDTRACKINGS – DECISION TO LEAVE\n\nMy greatest theatrical experience of the year was definitely seeing my first „big screen” Park Chan-Wook film – Decision To Leave, a superb crime thriller with the elements of melodrama. I was particularly fascinated by the score of the film, especially the love theme (which I now know it’s titled „The See Of Love”). Jo worked with Park before, including on the score for the film The Handmaiden, which opened me to the world of Korean director’s artistry.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/3ep6t8uikJ5Ge4o1bgvF0X\n\n8 BEAR MCCRARY & HOWARD SHORE – LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RINGS OF POWER\n\nDespite awful negative troll campaign, The Rings Of Power series debuted rather succesfully, being the best Tolkien -related media released since the original Peter Jackson trilogy. (Don’t even start me on the abomination The Hobbit was). A large of part of its success is the remarkable score, released in eight episode soundtracks. While Howard Shore was unavailable to score the entire series, he still took time to compose the captivating main theme. The rest was composed by Bear McCrary, mostly known for video games before, but he’s really shining here, it’s surprisingly great, monumental, dramatic, scary, and sometimes purely beautiful and ethereal score.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/4zZuch6tto3R0TMzcAn0oc\n\n7 BJÖRK – FOSSORA\n\nUndeservedly underappreciated in other year-end charts, Björk’s latest is a collection of stunning songs, featuring guest apperances from serpentwithfeet and her daughter. Icelanding artist made also a memorable appearance in Robert Eggers’ brilliant Viking epic The Northman.\n\nhttps://bjork.bandcamp.com/album/fossora\n\n6 RAVEENA – ASHA’S AWAKENING\n\nA case of the album with misleading singles – Rush, that eventually grew on me, doesn’t really represent moodier rest of the record. I definitely enjoyed the second half of AA more, particularly the last track which is quite unusual idea – it’s fourteen minutes long meditation tape, recited by Raveena, which I only heard once, but it was an interesting experience. It’s also worth mentioning that the album is also featuring legendary disco/soul artist, Indian singer Asha Puthli.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/2q0yeivzk1b2UUdtHf8mcC\n\n5 BEACH HOUSE – ONCE TWICE MELODY\n\nWhen Beach House announced that their new record would be released in fourt parts, I was unconvinced. And yet I included first songs from it in our songs of 2021 chart and now I can absolutely say that Once Twice Melody is a great album, adding many great songs to the band discography. I can’t for sure say it’s better as an entire record than 7, but I haven’t listened to either in some time.\n\nhttps://beachhouse.bandcamp.com/album/once-twice-melody\n\n4 WEYES BLOOD – AND IN THE DARKNESS, HEARTS AGLOW\n\nAs you can see, comparing the albums with its predecessors is a theme this year, but Titanic Rising is currenly one of my most played albums of all time (!), so only time will tell about And In The Darkness… It’s definitely less of a crossover, pop album than TR, but the lyrics and melodies are both incredible and all three singles, especially God Turn Me Into Flower are among the best songs of the year.\n\nhttps://weyesblood.bandcamp.com/album/and-in-the-darkness-hearts-aglow\n\n3 SAULT – ALBUMS RELEASED IN 2022\n\nSAULT’s jump into the world of classical music confused critics early this year. Myself, I enjoyed the surprise a lot and I was even happier with the entire package of few more albums released as a free download, before debuting on streaming, in November. There’s something for everyone here, 11 is probably most what people associate with „SAULT” but we also have bossa nova, gospel (with guest appearances from Little Simz and Michael Kiwanuka), a sequel to AIR, and even more guitar-heavy album titled Today & Tomorrow (with some songs being close to… punk). It’s the most exciting young project in the world right now.\n\nhttps://saultglobal.bandcamp.com/\n\n2 THE SMILE – A LIGHT FOR ATTRACTING ATTENTION\n\nOur most played album of the year, great collaboration between two members of Radiohead and Tom Skinner (ex-Sons Of Kemet), teased by their Glastonbury performance in 2021. It’s a great experimental, jazz/rock/electronic release, with all three members taking equally important part in the composition. It’s also very prolific band, the musicians composed enough material to release a second album already, so I won’t be surprised if they’ll appear here next year as well.\n\nhttps://thesmile.bandcamp.com/album/a-light-for-attracting-attention\n\n1 CHARLOTTE ADIGERY & BOLIS PUPUL – TOPICAL DANCER\n\nIt would be easy to give #1 to The Smile, especially since Radiohead are still awaiting this achievement, but I think it’s too early. In the meantime, I wanna honor the great songwriter and vocalist Charlotte Adigery, whom I follow since her Wwater days. After a couple of fantastic solo releases, a debut album is a collaboration with fellow Belgian producer Bolis Pupul. These songs are just amazing, mixing intelligent social commentary and reflections of everyday’s life of Black artist in modern world with very catchy instrumentals. Some of the songs were co-produced by Soulwax."
