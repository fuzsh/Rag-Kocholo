        "text": "EXCAVATED SHELLAC\n\nAN ALTERNATE HISTORY OF THE WORLD'S MUSIC (Dust 2 Digital)\n\nThe first time I was overcome with \"antiquarian lust\" for 78 rpm shellac discs was about 30 years ago, in a bookstore in Portland, Oregon. In the record room, they had a whole section devoted to 78s. I started looking through the neatly categorized albums, seeing Ambrose, Basie, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, and thought for a moment I was about to embark on a new area of collecting. Then it occurred to me, all the things I recognized I already had on much more convenient formats, like LP & CD. A friend gave me an album of General Records called VOODOO, recorded in Haiti in the 1940s. So I kept my eyes open for a 78 player, but when I saw one I liked I was in rural England or India and too far from home to think about lugging the mechanism and its giant horn back. The last temptation was again in a bookstore: Serendipity in Berkeley. Browsing on a regular visit I found boxes full of 78s on a table. Now here was something: Coleman Hawkins, early Monk, Lester Young, Billie Holiday. This time I was definitely going to get started. Sorry, said Peter (the owner), Elliot Schwartz has first refusal. This goldmine had belonged to local jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason and after its short-lived stay with Elliot (who died of cancer soon after) I don't know where it went. But in time the shellac past is returning in other formats, like this rich 4-\"disc\" set from Excavated Shellac. It's another triumphant assemblage by Jonathan Ward who gave us Opika Pende: Africa at 78. And again it has a beautifully designed, legible package, crammed with ephemera, photos and graphic goodies. In the 1980s the Heritage label revived some music from the 1920s, particularly featuring West Africa. From 1996 there was a series of a dozen CDs called \"The Secret Museum of Mankind\" on the Yazoo label which brought back 78s from different areas. In 2006-8 Savannahphone issued a couple of early retrospectives of Nigerian music, and Buda Musique gave us a compilation of African popular music from 1926-52. Most recently El Sur Records in Tokyo gave us Highlife and Early Congo compilations. My interest in these is because they contain rare African 78s. When it comes to \"world music\" I am as ignorant as the next fellow. I like African music and music of the Black Diaspora. I also like gypsy music, and some music from the Indian subcontinent, but I am oblivious to Irish, Scots or Breton fiddle or bagpipe music (even though it's \"in my blood\"), because generally the four-square rhythms don't engage me. Speaking, obliquely, of Northumbrian small pipes, which were played by Thomas Bewick in the late eighteenth century, there's a tune he would have known here: \"The Keel Row,\" which I will sing for you if you buy me a pint (For two pints, I will also sing \"Bobby Shaftoe\"; for three pints I promise to stop). It's a 1929 recording by legendary Northumbrian piper Tom Clough. There are few artists I know on Excavated Shellac, like San Salvador from the Congo and Salim Abdullah of Tanzania, but it's mostly new to me. The liner notes, which are thorough and document every track in depth, point out the superiority of the recordings on the local Mzuri label as Abdullah's track, \"Kwaherini (goodbye)\" demonstrates. Abdullah, who formed the Cuban Marimba Band, is justly celebrated and this track is not on the LP which came out in 2019 from Domino Sound, so it's a treat. Similarly the banjo track from Nyasaland (Malawi) is the unique known copy of this recording on the Federal label. The great pioneer Hugh Tracey was making inroads into the territory on behalf of Gallo, looking for such acts. Federal, probably run by Indians, had their records pressed in Bombay! Surprises to my ears are \"Riak-Riak\" by Toba Batak Ensemble from Sumatra and Vassyl Yemetz's \"Z Ukrainskyce Stepiw\" from Ukraine.\n\nThis is not the kind of disc you put on and listen to all the way though, as it doesn't seem to be sequenced thematically and some of it is harsh. Before the introduction of microphones in late 1920s recordings tended to be loud. But the seemingly odd juxtapositions work occasionally. A sequence of tracks from India, Iran, Uzbekistan, Malaysia and Albania flows nicely. The Malay fiddler would be at home in the Urals we suspect.\n\nWard admits his collection, like his blog, also called Excavated Shellac, is only a building block and not a definitive canon. There were so many hundreds of thousands of shellac discs released and while most vanished, many still turn up. So if he has found one disc by say, Valentin Eugenio, a folk singer from the Philippines, it's good but not necessarily the best of the dozen sides he recorded in 1931. We just don't know. We do know that popular songs like \"All by yourself in the moonlight\" by Whispering Jack Smith have not worn well a century later. And if it had not been for black musicians, we'd still be dancing the foxtrot.\n\nThe album ends with a Cuban son: the timeless elegance of the sublime \"Son la dos, China (It's two o'clock, my china)\" by Sexteto Habanero. [Footnote: \"China\" is also cockney slang for mate, as in China plate!] It stops abruptly as if to say we could keep on playing for ever... or put another way, once more from the top.\n\nDEBEN BHATTACHARYA\n\nPARIS TO CALCUTTA: MEN AND MUSIC ON THE DESERT ROAD (Sublime Frequencies SF112CD)\n\nThis 4-CD set and hardback book chronicles a journey made in 1955 when Deben Bhattacharya drove from Europe to his home in India, stopping along the way to record local musicians. Reversing the journey of filmmaker Tony Gatlif's masterpiece Latcho Drom, it shows a kaleidoscopic picture of the Bedouin, gypsies, and other lesser-heard musicians along the route. In 1958 Bhattacharya made an LP compilation (necessarily compressed) from his recordings, but this is the first time the full tapes have been released. In an interview with Guitarist magazine in 1993 Frank Zappa cited that 13-track LP, Music on the Desert Road (Angel Records), with having a huge influence on him. Robert Millis, the man behind Indian Talking Machine, edited the release. Sublime Frequencies, along with Dust-to-Digital, are making considerate and considerable contributions to the preservation of lost treasures of ethnomusicology for future generations.\n\nDeben was a Bengali poet who learned English, Hindi and Sanskrit. He went to England, not for a degree, but to pursue his musical education. He subsequently wrote books about the gypsies and the Bauls, wandering \"madmen\" singers of Bengal. He promoted Purna Das Baul and the Langa clan of Rajasthan in concert. He was an expert on Indian classical music and in London recorded local Indian performers and sold the recordings to the BBC. With a little capital advanced by EMI for future recordings, his tape recorder and an old Bedford van, he set off overland for home, planning to record Muslim and Hindu music on the way. The driver was a young architect he knew who wanted to go to Chandigarh to meet his hero Le Corbusier (Not surprisingly when they arrived the architect was in ecstasy while Deben was appalled by the Western suburban orderliness of the place and how un-Indian it is). The van was both a home on the road and furthermore the battery could power the reel-to-reel deck. The last disc of recordings in West Bengal are truly lovely.\n\nOutstanding moments are the tar solo by Shapoore Delshadi, recorded in Tehran. Another Iranian, Eskandare Ebrahimi also rips out a stunning improvisation on his setar. Staying in the former British Consulate building in Meshed, Iran, Bhattacharya set up his equipment:\n\n\"I had no idea that we would be spending any time in Meshed. But I had got used to changing my plans according to the whims of the road. What else could I do since my mission was to seek for people who improvised music? It always happened that way. If I arrived with letters of introduction, plans, time tables and so on, nothing else would happen. No one would come, not even a braying donkey! Whereas, if I simply arrived, in would come processions of musicians with drums, cymbals, strings, flutes, songs and dances. And as I pushed my battered little microphone right inside their mouths, their songs and dances reverberated through my veins. They sang not only for me but also for the moment which became alive, charged with sound. They improvised and if you were sympathetic, a sharer of sorrow, they expected you to improvise too.\"\n\nIn his career, Deben released over 80 albums of folk music. This distillation gives a taste of the young man embarking on his remarkable journey.\n\n·\n\nREAL WORLD 25 (RealWorld)\n\nIt been 25 years since Peter Gabriel launched RealWorld records, a few years after he helped bring off the first WOMAD (World of Music Arts and Dance) festival in 1982. He found an old mill in a quiet English country village and converted it into a state-of-the-art recording studio and invited artists to tarry longer after their WOMAD performance to record for his new label. Now a 3-CD set has been issued to celebrate this monumental achievement. WOMAD itself released a couple of excellent compilation albums, as well as Remmy Ongalla's Nalilia Mwana and Sema, which are long overdue for reissue. Gabriel used his rock-star status to promote world music and it was to his credit that Youssou Ndour and Papa Wemba reached wider audiences, despite what happened to their music as a result. The first release on RealWorld was his own Grammy-winning soundtrack to the film, The Last Temptation of Christ, called Passion, which was followed up by a truly fantastic LP, Passion Sources, that included the raw material he had used to create the music for Scorsese's film. More Ongalla albums followed on RealWorld as his international status was confirmed. RealWorld also found Toto La Momposina in Colombia and Orquesta Revé in Cuba. Not that they were lost, but we didn't know about them. One rainy Xmas eve I was looking for action in Yucatan, Mexico and found a bar with a live band. They were a marimba group and pretty good. I saw another gringo and engaged him in conversation: he told me he was an A&R guy for RealWorld, so we had a great evening comparing notes over cervezas. RealWorld had a great knack of bringing out the best in artists: they recorded a superb album of Hukwe Zawose, the mbira master from Tanzania who also recorded on Triple Earth. When we thought Rochereau had passed his prime (after the departure of Mbilia Bel), he cut a live album in the Box studio which though short was really sweet. Sheila Chandra's \"Ever so lonely\" was another haunting tune captured in the moment in that Wiltshire village. The list is eclectic and inclusive. I am not sure the 3-CD set works that well, I know some of the tracks really well while some are quite jarring, so I tend to jump about, but if you don't know the depth of the label it is truly impressive. To my mind there's one RealWorld album that sums up their philosophy and also stands far above all the others (certainly in rotation) and that is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's Mustt Mustt, with its heavier-than-osmium Massive Attack remix of the title track. This brought producer Michael Brook into the mix, and it spun off in all directions, bringing Qawwali fans to the London dub sounds of Adrian Sherwood and hipper clubbers to the pure strains of Sufi devotional music. Nusrat embodied the spirit of RealWorld with an almost anything goes approach to musical collaboration, yet he always remained true to his self, confident his voice could take it all in stride. More pure Qawwali albums followed and more remixes but Mustt Mustt is the mountain peak.\n\nBJÖRK IN CONCERT\n\nSHORELINE AMPHITHEATRE, MOUNTAIN VIEW 19 May 2007\n\nWhen I put on Björk's new album VOLTA last week, I could tell her concert was going to be a return to her tribal punk roots. She has come a long way since the Sugarcubes and reinvents herself constantly, but stays on the edge of performance art and musical exploration. We missed her tour with the symphony orchestra, Inuit chorus and harpist, as the tickets had sold out in a flash, but when the Duchess got wind of a new tour she had her connections working on the necessary digital synapses to get us tickets. The minus side included paying a 40% service charge to those Nazi pimps Clear Channel so we ended up with $100 tickets that still put us 200 yards from the stage at the impossible Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View. The plus side was a fantastic show that went off flawlessly & had us bopping about in the chilly Bay night air.\n\nShoreline is built on the site of a dump and to get there you drive round and round (past Google HQ!) and end up in a dusty field far from the venue. It is one of the reasons the San Francisco Bay is no longer the largest in the world, having been filled in with garbage over the past century. Famously, during a Steve Winwood concert, a fan's cigarette butt set fire to the methane that seeps from the dump and the place nearly burned down. The opening act was going on and on so everyone could find their spot. Any other crowd would have rioted and booed this crap outta there, but the warbling harpist got polite applause which only encouraged her. She had a wispy girly voice and a wispy girly band. Looking around we could see the crescent moon rising in the night sky with Venus burning brightly below it.\n\nAs I predicted Björk came out with the opening cut of the new album, \"Earth Intruders,\" an Oompa-Loompa groove with a jagged percussion beat on two-tone African cowbell and primal thundering synth bass lines. The stage was dimly lit like an aquarium but you could make out three keyboard/computer players, a drummer, and a ten-piece brass section comprised of Icelandic ladies, dressed in flimsy pastel gowns. Each of them had an orange flag attached to her back, so as they moved and grooved the flags bobbed about like dayglo fish. It was reminiscent of the samurai cavalry in Kurosawa films: no doubt Björk is an admirer of Emi Wada, Kurosawa's costumer. Behind them were huge pastel banners with fish and toads on them. Despite the largeness of the stage it was packed with equipment, monitors and gizmos and giant television screens that showed what at first looked like computer games.\n\nBjörk ran through four songs from her new album. Mercifully she did not do the ill-conceived song about the lady suicide bomber (not what you want to think about in a crowd of 12,000), and she also did not bring \"Anthony\" (of Anthony & the Johnsons) who sings duets with her on the new albums, effectively ruining it as a listening experience. What was she thinking? Yes she has a strange voice, with her thick accented english, and an odd manner of phrasing, but that is her charm. Anthony is a drippy almost creepy crooner of the Pat Boone junior league that makes you tear the album off.\n\nIt's said that Konono Number 1 is on the new album. There is a bit of ragged cowbell in \"Earth Intruders,\" but no electric likembes I could hear. In fact this is one of her strategies. She mixes four sonic elements: percussion, a tape loop or samples, a keyboard that may be another synthesizer, and a fourth element that could be a guest with a kora, harpsichord, gamelan, or Chinese pipa. On this tour a ten-piece brass section was the fourth component. But the brass band was mixed as one sound which was a shame as I wanted to hear all the individual horns. They were really fine in unison and once or twice the trumpets got to do a little improvisation. It was a tightly choreographed set so there really wasn't a lot of the spontaneity or interaction you expect in a live show, nevertheless it was a treat. The volume was massive and when she went into \"Pagan Poetry,\" the crowd erupted. There were a lot of lost Middle Earth people wandering about in silly costumes and they stopped long enough to jump up and down for this rallying cry. But then they went back to wandering the aisles lost and consuming $10 beers. There was so much pot smoke in the air it looked like fog in the light show laser beams.\n\nAfter each song Björk would say \"sink yew\" and curtsey, and then she tried on a \"mooshas grassyass\" which got quite a laugh. There was no banter which was too bad, just a black-out followed by the video games on the big screen and then the rhythm track of the next number would kick in. Gradually you realised the video game was a computer screen that was generating the sound through physical manipulation. You would see the hands & fingers of one of the musicians touching the green screen and he would manipulate the syn-waves physically. I don't know what this instrument is, some kind of clever interface, but it was fascinating to see him distort and bend the rhythms, & Björk was too far off to really see what she was doing unless she was flailing her arms and feet in her unique way, signalling that she never learned how to dance.\n\ncel-phone snap by the Duchess\n\nMy references are probably out of date but I recalled the experiments Brian Eno was doing with Cluster in the 70s, Pere Ubu came to mind, and of course Massive Attack. My favourite song on the new album is \"Wanderlust.\" She saved that for late in the set by when you could hear the nuances in the brass and the others were not overhyped so there was a little space in the wall of sound. Björk recycles fragments of her past tunes and some of her melodies, so you think you know a song but it has been reconstructed. \"Wanderlust\" has a lyrical vocal line, the brass swells poetically with contrapuntal phrasing as the insistent fragmented samples (little furry creatures pawing gravel) sets up a rhythmic contrast.\n\nBjörk is up to six albums and is off on a leisurely world tour. I didn't like her last outing, Medulla, and I am glad she has gone back to the sound of her successes from Post, Vespertine, and Homogenic. I didn't take notes but it was not a roster of hits by any means. The Duchess found the set list on a tour blog. She did \"Aeroplane\" from her first solo album DEBUT. From POST she did \"Army of me,\" \"Hyperballad\" and the sublime \"All is full of love.\" HOMOGENIC provided \"Pluto,\" \"Five years,\" and \"Unravel\" and VESPERTINE got short shrift with only \"Pagan poetry.\" On \"I miss you\" Einar Orn got to show off some chops with a great jazz trumpet solo.\n\nOne of the band, keyboardist Jonas Sen, has a tour blog which contains insight into the music from the stage. Apparently they had not rehearsed two of the tunes, \"Aeroplane\" and \"Mother Heroic,\" which they tried out just one hour before the show. From our side of the stage, it already had a finished sheen.\n\nThe encore was also carefully planned. She performed \"Oceania,\" the song that she had written for the Athens Olympics. I remember waiting through all the crap of the opening ceremony to hear it and the minute she started singing the asshole announcers on the TV network started talking about the number of yards in her costume, and the number of extras in the piece, etc. It was a mix of tango and cha cha rhythms and a great departure. She ended with the other militaristic number from VOLTA, \"Declare independence.\" There was a hint of Mark Smith of the Fall in her delivery of this song. It ended with a bang and a flourish and flames shooting into the sky, burning off the methane in the landfill dump below the stage.\n\nSOUND OF THE WORLD (Wrasse Records 169)\n\nI am so sick of compilations. To me most compilations seem like the province of newbies. The compiler cherry-picks the obvious greatest hits from a genre and then spits them out as a definitive look at African blues, Malian blues, Latin dance favourites, Best of Slick Salsa, Best of Sloppy Salsa, or whatever. I listen to those that come my way, and even review them in print, but I usually know all the good songs and am not particularly intrigued by the obscure cuts. Therefore it was a great pleasure to get SOUND OF THE WORLD, a double-disc set put together by BBC radio DJ Charlie Gillett. Charlie is in a good position as he not only gets EVERYTHING but even gets to hear stuff not available to us mortals. For example he recently got invited to Russia to judge a music festival and some of his discoveries from that trip provide the most interesting moments on this new set. Of course being a DJ is not that easy. I mean you don't need any actual musical ability, though it helps. Mainly you need an ear to pick out what's new and original and then to find the cut that is going to click. I have DJ friends who only try the \"side one track one\" approach. If that doesn't set their foot tapping, they forget it. \"Wow, what's that great song?\" they ask me. \"It's the second cut on the B side,\" I tell them. So it's work, and often you dismiss an album because there's only one good song then are glad when it shows up on a compilation and wonder if you should have tried harder. But life's too short to be listening to mediocre albums over and over trying to find the good bits in them.\n\nThe first disc kicks off with Daby Balde from Senegal. Not a familiar name but this cut will have you looking for the album INTRODUCING DABY BALDE (on Riverboat records) to see what else is on there. Next up is Bulgaria and the first of the \"gee I didn't know those white people had so much soul\" moments. Actually it's Boris Iliev's clarinet that sets this apart, and the vocal by Sissy Atanassova is great, reminding you of those other gypsies, the ones that appear in Bollywood production numbers! OK cue the video on this one! But track three, \"Geo\" by Ivan Kupala from Russia, is the first that makes you grab a pen and say I have to write this down-- RADIO NAGRA-- must try to find this album (try http://www.soyuz.ru).\n\nI know many of you will disagree but I thought Amadou and Mariam were crap in concert with their French rock band and though Amadou plays a good R&B guitar, Mariam's vocals were shrill and the din was awful. Every time the djembe player stepped forward the trap drummer decided to outdo him. I liked their previous two albums, but I didn't keep their Manu Chao-produced album DIMANCHE A BAMAKO. However the best cut from it, \"Coulibaly,\" is on here. It is followed by the first one you are going to either love or hate, Camille, a French singer who wants to be Bjork but settles for Jacqueline Brel. I hit the forward button. The next one starts like Miles Davis' \"Elevator to the gallows\" and I am thinking we are in for some more weird French time-warp crap, but then an arhythmic drum comes in with some dubby bass and I know Mr Gillett has been clubbing in France & it is, well, kinda interesting. There's a hip hop feeling to it but the best part is the stretch between the jazz trumpet of Ludovic Venu and the Wolof vocals of Jean Gomis (a relative of Rudy?). The group is called, inexplicably, Meï Teï Shô. Streets of Laredo ranchería is up next with a Canadian woman of Mexican extraction named Llasa. I imagine if you caught her act, you might dig this. On the other hand if she appeared on Sabado Gigante she might get the hook. Now I am getting an itchy trigger-finger and zip forward to Darko Rundek & Cargo Orkestar with a good cut from RUKE (on Piranha) which I enjoyed. (I went looking to see if I had reviewed it and found I had rubbished last year's Charlie Gillett compilation, so things are definitely looking up!) After some bad rap from Nairobi Yetu (at least it's in Kiswahili), the first disc mellows out with State of Benghal vs Paban das Baul, followed by the first encounter between Ali Farka Toure and kora player Toumani Diabate and then the jazzy reggae of Anzacs DJ Fitchie and Joe Dukie, who give us \"Midnight Marauders,\" with a solid horn chorus. (The Duchess found it boring and asked me to take it off.)\n\nDisc two starts with Issa Bagayogo, top of the pile where he belongs. Brazilian flava-of-da-month Seu Jorge pops up for a moment with his squeaky cuica accompaniment. On the recommendation of two different people I watched The Life Aquatic with Steve Zizou to see Seu Jorge. He was awful (David Bowie covers? Forget it!) and the movie really stank, or sank. The first thing that catches me by surprise is Shukar Collective. I didn't know you could actually imitate Lee Perry! But this second disc gets very slack and I venture could have been left out entirely. True, there's Youssou Ndour, but we all have that album EGYPT as it's the best thing he's done in decades. Ana Salazar from Spain does the \"Ay-yi-yi-yi\" chorus which you can hear at any soccer match. (Though recently at a forgettable Premiership game in England I noted that \"Guantanamera\" has become the most popular melody for fans to co-opt.) By the time we get to Japanese horns doing \"Jingle bells\" (Tokyo-chutie-iki's \"Otome sankabi\") I feel like I am wasting my time. I hate the shotgun approach: pack the CD with lots of stuff and someone's bound to like some of it. The consumer isn't fooled by the offer of \"buy one get one free.\" Quality not quantity is what we want. The last cut by Think of One is a Belgian-Morrocan collaboration with another big nod to Jamaica. It's a good ending, but the most interesting stuff on here is by the Russian artists Gillett has discovered. Someone might consider a Best of Russian New Wave or whatever and ask him to compile it and open up another frontier to us music fans.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS\n\nOCORA BOX SET (C561061/67 Harmonia Mundi 28X7)\n\nOne of the great archives of world music is OCORA, the French national radio. I treasure my OCORA African vinyl and have tried to fill in the blanks as the albums have come out on CD. I have a poet-friend who was kept sane during his years of study at Harvard by the pygmy music of Central Africa on OCORA LPs (that he later went round the bend is not a logical manifestation of his listening to so much tribal music, but we did spend many happy evenings together exploring our collections).\n\nNow there's a sampler box set (originally issued in separate volumes a decade ago) and, apart from the box set collectors who like to buy in bulk, there's a lot to engage you in the seven discs, boiled down from over 300 album releases. Volume one is the Arabic diaspora, starting in Algeria and moving East (most befitting) to Iran. Familiar acts on here are the Gnaoua of Essouira, Morocco and Talip Ozkan of Turkey.\n\nVolume two, South Asia, presents the Indian subcontinent, and from Ravi Shankar to Nusrat it moves faultlessly in a wonderfully sequenced hour of mellow evening music. There's singing from Lakshmi Shankar and some less-well-known classical musicians who are up to the level of the masters.\n\nVolume three is East Asia (China, Korea, Japan), an area I only know from film soundtracks. However I can't say I have ever seen any Korean films. But track 6, by South Korea's Ensemble Jong Nong Ak Ohô, reminded me of the clucking and scratching of avant-garde German guitarist Hans Reichel. The instruments are gomungo and chango (not the Cuban god!). Far out, indeed!\n\nVolume 4, Southeast Asia, has the strangest stuff on it, as well as the familiar gamelan which, for many of us, was our first encounter with music of the rest of the world, thanks to the Nonesuch Explorer series. I once read a critique of world music that said it was marketed to jaded Westerners who were seeking the thrill of something new, but the newness and strangeness of Vietnamese and Burmese music is what makes it inaccessible to me. I don't think I'll ever get used to it, and I seek the comfort of the familiar gamelan tones of Indonesia. There is a big surprise on this album and it's the closing track \"In the current of the Mekong\" from Laos which sounds like a rocking Cajun two-step. The liner notes call it a bamboo mouth-organ -- the khaen, related to the sheng in China -- it sure is jamming!\n\nFor me, Volume 5 (Africa) is the greatest repository of OCORA's riches. Here they charted vast unknown areas of Africa (remember that Hugh Tracey was making his recording trips by truck from his base in South Africa, so he didn't get to Francophone West Africa). OCORA started about a decade later but they were thorough. Their albums also contained booklets with photos and detailed notes. Masques Dan, Ceremonie des Bobe, Polyphonie Mongo -- so many remarkable moments in these discs! We start with Lobi celebration music from Burkina Faso, recorded in 1961: growly, gravelly, wonderous. Musique Gbaya is great meditation music; I also discovered it's great driving music. The African selections have also been released on a single CD as C560065. While it's a great introduction to African traditional music, it has the usual limitations of time. To really get inside these pieces you need the whole length of the album, especially the ritualistic or ceremonial pieces that were already cut down from day-long recordings. This even affects more contemporary music.\n\nOne of my all-time favourites is OCORA C559007, \"Musiques Urbains à Kinshasa,\" recorded in November 1978 and released in 1987. It never came out on LP, but the double cassette release is two hours long, while the same four selections are chopped to 73 minutes to fit on the single CD. On the sampler, the track by Tout-Puissant Likembe Konono is only 6 mins and 20 seconds; on the CD it is 26 mins and 50 seconds, while it clocks in at 29'30 on the cassette! What is so compelling about this particular release is its modernity. Here are traditional thumb-piano bands who have made contact mikes out of copper foil and wire, and built amplifiers with scavenged car batteries to generate a raw and ragged sound that is also loud! By recontextualizing their music, these musicians who have migrated from the bush to the burbs have made it vital once more.\n\nVolume 6, Europe, seems to betray a hint of Gallic bias. The bagpipe piece comes from France and there's a Belgian polka. No Celtic music is represented unless someone wants to make a wild connection with Fado. The longest and most outstanding piece here is the \"Song of the Innkeeper's Wife\" by Taraf de Clejani, a Roumanian gypsy group. I have heard this same piece done by Taraf de Haiduks. There's a horsehair string on the fiddle which, when played briskly, sounds like something ripping. This segues into an uptempo ballad and the music shifts about in movements as different tempos and instruments are featured. After some laments with accordion from Russia, we hear from the master of the Greek bouzouki, followed by the startling triple-reed launedda from Sardinia that requires circular breathing to play. There's no Corsican polyphony, probably to bolster the liner notes' wild claim that polyphonic music originated in the heart of Paris at Notre Dame. (In all likelihood the liner notes are hard to read, at first, being translated perhaps by a machine which, to them, imparts a haphazard personality. Imbued with such difficulties we nevertheless blunder on.) A Spanish bulería and Portuguese fado round things off nicely showing white folks can have soul (though you might argue that 8 centuries of Arab & African blood made them mestizos)!\n\nLast up, Volume 7, takes in Latin America. A different place from the one we know from our favourite familiar Colombian and Brasilian recordings. However there's some weird and wonderful stuff here: like the scene where a wild bull meets a market truck on a jungle track. Actually it's a rare recording made by a tribe of Asurini do Xingu whose rituals are unknown to anthropologists, but they know how to work a tape recorder! It sounds like African horn music too. The instruments are low-pitched tule clarinets and flutes made from reeds and their rhythmic propulsiveness blends in with the insect sounds. This is a must-find (on OCORA 560084). Cuba is so thoroughly documented you know right away what's going on. It's the Family Miranda doing a popular song from the 1940s by Compay Segundo. The other central American tracks have a familiarity in their rhythms and instruments, but overall this OCORA box brings to light some gems in their vast catalogue and is well worthy delving into."
