        "text": "During Winter Break I spent some time updating my Spotify for the New Year, and when going through my playlists I realized how much appreciation I have for the genre of R&B. Rhythm & Blues has a special place in my heart; it truly has the ability to make the listener just stop and think about similar experiences they might have had to a scene being described in a song or imagine themselves in the position of the singer to truly empathize with the message of the piece. R&B is unique in the sense that it isn’t meant to be incredibly intricate with musicality. Because of this simplicity, the main focus of R&B shifts towards making the listener tune into the lyrics and have a thought-provoking and nostalgic listening experience. I truly think I could listen to R&B beats at anytime anywhere for a retrospective and reminiscent experience.\n\nLet’s get started with the basics. The genre of R&B first originated in the 1940s when it replaced the term “race music” as it became the marketing name for African American music. To this day, a lot of mainstream R&B artists are African American and various R&B songs still preserve the culture of traditional African American styles, such as swing and jazzy blues, while also adding modern characteristics. The most popular recent example I can think of is within SZA’s new album, SOS (listening to it on repeat right now). At the end of Open Arms (feat. Travis Scott) she included a segment of traditional West African music featuring the Kora (a stringed instrument with features of the lute and the harp).\n\nDespite R&B being one of my favorite genres of music, I actually only discovered it recently, within the past two years. However, once I connected with this genre, I fully immersed myself into exploring it more through various artists and playlists. Some of my personal favorite R&B songs include Get You by Daniel Caesar (feat. Kali Uchis), Trust by Brent Faiyaz, and Love Songs by Kaash Paige. All three of these songs have mellow background music and are centered around the artist describing how another person in their life has impacted them in an everchanging way, which almost every listener can relate to in some capacity.\n\nHere is a starter R&B Playlist by Spotify if you’re interested in exploring the genre more: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4SBhb3fqCJd?si=b1dde4c5ae0943b4"
