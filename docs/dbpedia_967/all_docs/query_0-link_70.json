        "text": "OUT NOW, ‘Starfruit’ is the long-awaited fifth album from LA-trio Moonchild (Amber Navran, Andris Mattson, and Max Bryk).

Working with a stellar line-up of US and UK female vocalists – including CeCe Peniston, Chantay Savage, Carleen Anderson, Donna Gardier and Incognito’s Joy Rose – they cover a wide range of styles from Latin to disco, soulful house to soul-jazz. “Refreshed” is a 2CD collection of remixes together with new recordings like “Get Down Saturday Night”, a new take on an Eighties club favourite, with a powerful soul vocal from Chantay Savage, and Rod Temperton’s “Love X Love” featuring Izzy Chase, with a Latin-flavoured mix by Incognito.\n\nAmong the most streamed Full Flava recordings are “September”, also featuring Chantay Savage, remixed by Sunlight Square; “You Are The Universe” featuring CeCe Peniston, remixed by Michele Chiavarini; “Was That All It Was”, a disco era favourite featuring Carleen Anderson, given the soulful house treatment by Micky More and Andy Tee; and the Stevie Wonder composition “Betcha Wouldn’t Hurt Me”, with Donna Gardier on vocals. Blue Lab Beats bring a soul-jazz twist to “Stories”, featuring Carleen Anderson.\n\n​\n\nhttp://www.domerecords.co.uk/\n\nIt’s been often said that you can’t keep a good woman down, but that rarely sounds as sweet or empowering as when it comes from the lips of singer Leela James. She gives us her testimony about love lost and resilience found on the single “Break My Soul” featuring Mumu Fresh.\n\n​\n\nOver sparse piano and a steady drum beat, Leela gives life to the despair shared by many women after breaking up with someone not worthy of their tears. “That’s what happens when the love goes cold / You feel like you gon’ lose your soul,” she sings with her patented soul-drenched rasp. She recognizes that those feelings are temporary, however, and lets the one who hurt know that, “You can’t take my crown no way / Oh, you'll never break my soul.\" Yes, queen! Mumu Fresh comes through with a hot 16 that adds an exclamation mark to Leela’s message, proclaiming, \"I’m a whole vibe even when I'm somber.”\n\n​\n\nThe visual for “Break My Soul” is a simple affair, but it perfectly shows the strength and resilience of women. Leela walks without breaking her stride through the city. Meanwhile, we see a woman dancing in an open field and near a railroad showing grace, beauty and strength with each movement. Finally, Leela and Mumu look over a city skyline while sharing some sister talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\n“Break My Soul” is the latest single from Leela James’ newest album See Me. It follows the singles “Complicated,” “Put It On Me” and “You’re The One.” If you haven’t added this album to your collection yet, you might want to get on it before you’re left without a banging autumn playlist.\n\n​\n\nhttps://LeelaJames.lnk.to/SeeMeID\n\nMichele Chiavarini remodels the title track of Jarrod Lawson’s Be The Change album into a glorious Mediterranean-flavoured soulful house anthem, with Graeme Flowers adding some stellar work on flugelhorn. The sun-drenched mix enhances the positive, uplifting message of Jarrod’s lyrics, inspired as they are by the words of Mahatma Gandhi: “You must be the change you wish to see in the world”.\n\nOver the past 30 years Michele has worked on several hundred recordings by such artists as Donna Summer (his Billboard Dance chart #1 remix of Hot Stuff), Diana Ross, Soul II Soul, Seal and Simply Red. In the world of house music he has few peers, whether as a producer, remixer or session musician on productions by leading DJs and dance artists, including Dave Lee, David Morales, DJ Spen and Josh Milan.\n\nPortland-based singer-pianist Jarrod debuted at #2 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Albums chart with Be The Change, his second album. The former Jazz FM Soul Artist of the Year is preparing to resume live dates later this year in the US and Europe.\n\n“I’m an artist first but a radio host as well. There are few artists that I can honestly say you can pick any song from their project and it’ll be good – Jarrod is in the elite group. He’s a can’t-go-wrong artist. One of the keepers of the flame” –\n\nWill Downing, host of radio show The Wind Down\n\n1. Michele Chiavarini Remix\n\n2. Michele Chiavarini Remix Edit\n\n3. Michele Chiavarini Remix Instrumental\n\nRelease: May 21, 2021\n\nDOME 583D\n\nCONTACT: Santosh Robinson\n\nsantosh@domerecords.co.uk\n\nOn March 3, 2021, Reel People drop a digitally remastered version of the remix package for single You Used To Hold Me So Tight, taken from landmark Noughties album Second Guess. The event is part of wider release activity today, Reel People also making available a digitally remastered version of the Second Guess album, as well as digital updates of the eight other single releases that originally accompanied and followed it, including Can’t Stop and The Light. The move comes some 18 years after Second Guess’ full mainstream release via Defected and marks a welcome return for the seminal LP – a boundary-pushing mix of beats, jazzed-out house, sultry rim-soul and sweet songcraft - to its first home on Papa Records. It also coincides with the release of exciting new material from the collective, spearheaded by core trio Oli Lazarus, Mike Patto and Toni Economides, this spring. Reel People will shortly unveil fresh three-track EP Hearts Collide, building on the success late last year of single I Never Knew (featuring Speech) and follow-up EP Dancing On The Moon – the outfit’s first new material in over a decade. Undoubtedly, Reel People are building serious momentum for 2021.\n\nThe remastered single release of You Used To Hold Me So Tight, out today, includes remixes by Phil Asher and Dr Packer.\n\n​\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/YUTHMST2021RM\n\n​\n\nAnderson .Paak and Timbaland have teamed up to deliver the brand new single, “JEWELZ.”\n\n​\n\nClocking in at just under three minutes, the funk-laden track is a feel-good offering that hears .Paak singing and rapping in a pitched-up voice. The single’s sunny disposition reflects the confident lyricism used by the GRAMMY winner where he sings, “I ain’t even put my jewels on/I ain’t even play my latest, greatest song/Had to make or break ’cause that ‘lectric made to go.”\n\n​\n\nSpeaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music, .Paak named Timbaland as one of his inspirations as a producer. “…[I]t’s really dope to see someone like Timbaland that comes out of that era and that can still get the keyboard and mash out a beat right there on the spot. You know what I’m saying? A lot of dudes can’t do that no more,” he said. He continued, “‘JEWELZ’ was amazing, man. Timbaland came through, he had a bunch of ideas, he brought his son through and before we even got in the session, we was just chopping it up, having conversations and I think that’s how pretty much the song had came about. With “I ain’t even put my jewels on,” we were talking, me, him and his son about something, and I think his son had said it. Like, “We didn’t even start it yet or I ain’t get my sh-t out yet.” And I was like, “Yo, that’s it. I ain’t even put my jewels on yet. We didn’t even start yet. We just warming up.” You know what I’m saying? And Timbaland got in there.”\n\n​\n\nSinger-songwriter-keyboardist Jarrod Lawson emerged seemingly out of nowhere, at the age of 37, with a self-produced debut album that took the world of soul and jazz by storm.\n\nWithin a whirlwind couple of years the former stonemason and piano tuner from Portland, Oregon played sold-out shows at London’s Ronnie Scott’s Club and Jazz Cafe, headlined the London Shepherds Bush Empire, performed at the London Jazz Festival, Love Supreme and North Sea Jazz festivals and powered his way into the Dutch Top 40 album chart. He has since performed at Billboard Live in Tokyo, in\n\nMelbourne, at Indonesia’s Java Jazz festival and at leading jazz venues across the United States,\n\nDescribing him as the “blue eyed soul boy of jazz”, the London Evening Standard wrote: “It’s not just\n\nLawson’s wide ranging tenor and ability to swing, scat and groove that has made him the biggest soul-jazz sensation in years. It’s the way he’s bringing spirituality back to a genre that had lost its depth”.\n\nLawson is now back, with his long-awaited second album “Be The Change” – on 2LP vinyl in a gatefold package with full lyrics - accompanied by a talented band that benefits from the rhythmic presence of Grammy-nominated percussionist Sammy Figueroa, whose playing in a lengthy career has graced dozens of albums from artists as diverse as Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins and Quincy Jones to Hall & Oates, Chic and Carole King.\n\nLawson’s trademark layered harmonies and vocal phrasing, his jazz fusion arrangements and his stunning keyboard skills are in evidence throughout the album, notably on title track “Be The Change”, “Universal Chord” and “How Long”. On the beautiful, intimate “I’ll Be Your Radio” he is joined by Moonchild’s Amber Navran on vocals and flute and her fellow members of the Los Angeles alternative R&B trio who contribute clarinet and flugelhorn, and on the smouldering torch song “Love Isn’t Always Enough” Max Ribner’s\n\ntrumpet and flugel provide the perfect mood-setting accompaniment.\n\nLawson grew up surrounded by music. His father ran a recording studio in the family’s Redwood City,\n\nCalifornia home. After moving to Portland he studied music and was a member of his college chamber choir and jazz ensemble. His near obsession with the piano blossomed when he was only 13 as he\n\nstudied the masters from Chopin to Oscar Peterson, Ravel to Errol Garner, as well as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell and, of course, the artists who have influenced him the most - Donny Hathaway and Stevie\n\nWonder. Whether he sings and plays jazz, funk or rock ultimately “everything he touches turns to soul”, as one critic wrote.\n\nFollowing the release of his debut album he received an Artist of the Year award from the UK’s Jazz FM and was runner up for Album of the Year at tastemaker DJ Gilles Peterson’s Worldwide Awards"
