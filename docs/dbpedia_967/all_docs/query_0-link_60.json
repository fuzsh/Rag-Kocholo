        "text": "Can I Hold You? Lover is the fourth album released by A-Mei. Although it is listed as her fifth, the last release was a live album and not a studio album. The album was another huge success for the singer, with the title track peaking within the top 20 songs of 1999 in Taiwan.\n\nReleased: June 8, 1999\n\n1. Can I Hold You? (我可以抱你嗎)\n\n2. When I Secretly Started Thinking of You (當我開始偷偷地想你)\n\n3. Love, What’s Rare? (愛 什麼稀罕)\n\n4. Want to See You So Much (好想見你)\n\n5. No Regrets (無悔)\n\n6. Goodnight, Goodbye\n\n7. Don’t Sprinkle Salt on the Wound (別在傷口灑鹽)\n\n8. Three Days, Three Nights (三天三夜)\n\n9. Run Away From Love (離愛出走)\n\n10. Give Me Feelings (給我感覺)\n\n11. Don’t Care About Him (不在乎他)\n\n12. Sunrise (日出)\n\nThe album opens with the title track. Can I Hold You? is a pretty soft, acoustically driven pop song. While the verses are calming, the song does get a bit more punch in its arrangement when the pre-chorus comes in. It’s not a song that really sets things on fire as its arrangement stays pretty relaxed throughout its entirety besides the jazzier instrumental break. It’s still a pretty song that has a great melody that really carries things. It’s a pretty solid start.\n\nI’m surprised things didn’t open with When I Secretly Started Thinking of You since it is more upbeat. This one, we get some pop/rock attitude and it is great. The verses are slithering with their acoustic riffs, but when that chorus comes blasting in, things really stand out. It’s catchy, swift and does its job. It only gets better as the song goes on.\n\nIf rock is your liking then Love, What’s Rare? goes even harder down this route and we really get A-mei in her element. The song, especially the verses, have so much attitude but there are still some sufficient hooks to keep things interesting. The chorus is really fun. It’s not the catchiest tune, but I really love how A-mei’s voice echoes here. She really works well with this kind of genre.\n\nI find the transition into Want to See You So Much to be a bit weird since this is a jazzier ballad that’s sung in Japanese. The Chinese version, Don’t Care About Him, is found later on the album. There are only a few slight differences between the two versions in terms of arrangement, but I always find the Japanese version to be the stronger of the two. The lyrics flow more smoothly. It’s not the strongest ballad, but there is a nice simplicity to it that helps it stand out.\n\nAt this point, No Regrets feels the most reminiscent of the songs from A-mei’s first two albums. The song has a more synthed up arrangement that opens with a softer delivery. I love how the song starts as A-mei’s voice is really pretty during the verses. Like your usual 90’s ballad though, the chorus is where the magic happens. It’s an emotionally-tinged song and while it isn’t among her best ballads, it’s still a pretty one.\n\nGoodnight, Goodbye is one of my favourite songs from A-mei. It is dark pop tune that has some latin-elements. I love the lyrical content as it talks about all the girls that A-mei’s partner has been meeting and she calls their names too. It works really well with the song’s more intense delivery. The verses are quite calm, but the chorus really lets things rip. It’s really catchy.\n\nAnd then the album gets to my favourite A-mei song ever. Don’t Sprinkle Salt on the Wound is a classic piano ballad from A-mei, but it feels a bit more updated compared to the ones on her previous albums. Much like the last song, the lyrical content stands out to me on this one as it talks about not rushing getting over a breakup. The song’s highlight is once again the chorus where its more dramatic pop/rock arrangement helps to give it a different kind of emotional edge. Great!\n\nOnce again popping in with a strange transition, Three Days, Three Nights is a beach pop/rock tune. While the rest of the album has a bit more a serious tone, this one brings something really bright and summery. It’s a bit weird, but it’s not a terrible song though. It’s a bit funny. The chorus is pretty much just cheering/yelling, which is a bit annoying after a while, but the song does have some fun moments, especially it’s “bababa” hooks.\n\nThen we get a super serious ballad with Run Away From Love. I really like this ballad and it’s one of A-mei’s darkest songs in terms of tone. The verses aren’t bad, but a tad forgettable. Things only really start to get good when the R&B-influenced pre-chorus comes in and set things up for the song’s more dramatic chorus to bust in. I wish the song played a little more with harmonies to really round out the melody in the chorus and make it flourish. But besides that, it’s a solid ballad.\n\nI’m surprised why Give Me Feelings wasn’t put right after “Three Days, Three Nights” because it goes for a fun, summery pop sound. It sticks out like a sore thumb here and feels more suited for her first two albums. Still, it’s a pretty fun song regardless of the cohesiveness. The chorus is bright and feels very reminiscent of the 90’s bubblegum pop sound from the time. A-mei also hits some great notes here and there.\n\nYeah, I’m not sure what to think of Sunrise. It tries to do something a bit different. It still keeps a brighter energy to it, which ties it in with “Give Me Feelings”, but it has a stranger, more laid back arrangement. It also relies on a terrible hook “bala bon” that gets really annoying to listen to. There are some really fun points like the chorus and its melody, but then it gets overshadowed by its horrible hook.\n\nOverall: This is the return of A-mei with quality work. The album is less cohesive than her first two, but at least there are some really strong songs on here compared to her last album which faltered a bit in its overall delivery. I do wish the songs were rearranged to flow a little better as some transitions are really jarring, but I did enjoy the majority of the songs.\n\nA\n\nHolding Hands is the third album released by A-mei Zhang. The album was yet another success for the singer, although it didn’t quite hit the same strides as her first two. This album did showcase a decline in the quality of A-mei’s vocals largely due to excessive touring.\n\nReleased: October 3, 1998\n\n1. Are You Ready\n\n2. Don’t Lie to Me (不要騙我)\n\n3. Dream of the Titanic (夢見鐵達尼)\n\n4. Lonely Bowling (寂寞保齡球)\n\n5. Surrender to Love (對愛投降)\n\n6. High High High\n\n7. Blue Sky (藍天)\n\n8. Holding Hands (牽手)\n\n9. Open your eyes\n\n10. After Knowing, After Realizing (後知後覺)\n\nThe album opens with a punch. Unlike her first two albums which started with ballads, we get things started with a pop/rock tune. A-mei’s gritty vocals do well in Are You Ready and her voice really works great in this style of song. I don’t think it’s the catchiest tune and it relies more on the energy and power, but it does have its moments and I like how cool it comes off. The last minute changes things up with a chant-like finish and we get to hear A-mei riffing it up.\n\nAnother change up in sounds comes with Don’t Lie to Me. Up to this point, A-Mei hadn’t released an R&B tune but this one goes full in. It goes a more midtempo route and is very reminiscent of 90’s R&B. I didn’t like this song at first, but it has become a favourite for me. It has a catchy melody that has A-mei playing over the background vocals. We hear a more reserved A-mei and her voice is just so versatile that she can pull this one off as well. There is a random rap that comes up later on, but it doesn’t detract from the song.\n\nI liked this experimenting of sounds, so it’s a bit unfortunate that Dream of the Titanic brings us back to the standard ballad side of things. A-mei does own these kinds of song, but it feels more fitting of her debut or second album. It has a pretty melody and does the usual build-up into a powerful end chorus, but the verses are a bit dull. It’s a solid tune, but she’s done this before and better.\n\nReturning to the experimentation. Lonely Bowling has a weird name and is an even weirder song. It goes the reggae route, which I wasn’t expecting. It reminds me a little of some of the songs from her last album as it brings some attitude to the album. The chorus isn’t particularly catchy and depends on a weird hook, but it still all comes together rather nicely. While things go reggae, it blends in some rock and odd synths to give it a bit more punch.\n\nSurrender to Love is another ballad. A lot of A-mei’s ballads from the 90’s bring a similar vibe. The arrangements are done in a way to give an almost “longing” feel to the music and this one does the same. While it is another standard Mandopop ballad, I do enjoy this one more than the last. The verses have a more traditional Chinese edge to them and while the chorus sort of rids itself of this, the melody does pack a punch.\n\nI like that we return with some more pop in the form of High High High. This is a bright pop tune. The verses are interesting because they have a bit of a latin spin and while the chorus goes full on pop, it doesn’t lose its positive touch. I do wish the latin elements were present throughout the whole song because it packs a bit more punch. The chorus is catchy, although the music is a little lacking here. It’s still a fun tune.\n\nBlue Sky is a piano ballad and it’s a nice one at that. I feel like this is the strongest ballad on the album because it really helps to set up a mood. It also lacks the more outdated sounds of the other ballads and is a bit more contemporary. The melody doesn’t sink in as easily, but there is a simplicity that is quite charming. It also feels like a template for some of her later ballads.\n\nThe title track is an upbeat acoustic pop song. Holding Hands actually reminds me of Hanson’s “Mmmbop”. Unfortunately, it’s not as catchy. I do like the energy it brings, but A-mei feels like she is on the edge of her voice, while the melody doesn’t quite hit the spot in terms of memorability. It has its charm, but it is actually my least favourite of the songs at this point.\n\nOpens Your Eyes brings back the ballads, but with something darker. I actually really enjoy how this song opens and its focus on A-mei and the piano. I wish it kept this throughout because it would bring a more emotional edge that is needed. The song does gain a bit of power later on due to the percussion and it comes across as more generic then. It’s a pretty song, but had potential to be more.\n\nWe end things on a more interesting note. After Knowing, After Realizing has a bit of a gospel edge to it and this helps set it apart from the other slower tunes. I mean that is until it goes more midtempo with the inclusion of guitar and beat. It is like a weird blend of things and I’m not sure what to think. It’s a weird song, but it’s surprisingly charming and I like the playing around with sounds.\n\nOverall: This is an alright album. Considering how great her first two albums (especially her second), this is a bit of a disappointment. I like that she tried to experiment with her sound and those songs were generally the ones that stood out the most. She can do ballads wonderfully, but a lot of these just weren’t up to par to the ones she did before and many came off pretty standard sounding even for her and blended into each other.\n\nB+\n\nBad Boy is the second album released by A-mei Zhang. The album proved to be an even bigger success than her debut and many of the songs on the album are still regarded as classics. It was so popular that it eventually became the best selling album in Taiwan, with over 1.3 million copies sold.\n\nReleased: October 7, 1997\n\n1. Can’t Cry (哭不出來)\n\n2. Whenever I Think About You (一想到你呀)\n\n3. Lonely Tequila (孤單 Tequila)\n\n4. Dancing Alone (一個人跳舞)\n\n5. Listen to the Sea (聽海)\n\n6. Bad Boy\n\n7. Sweet Words (甜言蜜語)\n\n8. Lover? Enemy? (情人?敵人?)\n\n9. Love, Not Too Early or Too Late is Better (愛,不太早不太晚,剛好)\n\n10. Loved You (愛過你)\n\nIt’s a bit of a surprise that the album starts with Can’t Cry, which is a ballad. Although she did it with her debut, this one is a bit different because it is more of a slow builder. The song starts off pretty gentle with just A-mei, a piano and light synths. The chorus is definitely the highlight as the melody does a great job showing off A-mei’s soaring vocals. The song only really starts picking up after the second bridge where A-mei hits a huge note before slamming into the final chorus. It’s exhilarating and a strong start.\n\nWhenever I Think About You is my favourite song on the album. It’s the first upbeat song but it has this carefree nature about it that I absolutely love. Not to mention that it is really catchy. The music itself is a bit oldschool, but I think it still holds up rather well because the stomping beat and funky guitar really give it some great energy. With that said, I love how fun the song sounds and it is the kind that is easy to sing along to.\n\nLonely Tequila is a bit off an odd song as it has a jazzier aspect to it. The synths and saxophone here make the song sound totally 90’s, but it still does a great job of bringing a more mature style. The beginning is nice, but it isn’t as interesting as the second half the song where the song becomes more dramatic and intense and fits the lyrics that delve into needing someone. This song fits perfectly with the raspy quality of A-mei’s vocals and it is another stellar tune.\n\nDancing Alone continues the jazzier sound, but brings something a little more upbeat. I love the funky bass and it sounds great in this sexier number. I think one thing I love about the songs on this album is that A-mei’s voice is just so versatile and her vocal abilities allow her to really take over a song even if she doesn’t belt it out. This song isn’t as strong as the other songs, but I still love it because it has a great 80’s vibe going on and it is still really catchy.\n\nListen to the Sea is probably the album’s biggest song and one of A-mei’s signature hits. This one is a bit like the first song on the album because it starts off pretty gentle. The chorus is once again the highlight with its soaring notes and does a great job of matching with the heartbreaking lyrics. A-mei’s voice sounds especially great here as well.\n\nThe title track, Bad Boy, is a fun latin-inspired upbeat pop tune. I wasn’t a big fan of this song when I first heard it, but it has grown on me tremendously. The guitar tied with the pounding beat and A-mei’s raspy vocals is a really great fusion. The hooks are a bit repetitive, but it still works out nicely and it is easy to get stuck in your head. With that said, I actually love the verses more. Solid tune.\n\nAt first, I found Sweet Words to be boring because it focuses a lot on just A-mei and an acoustic guitar. However, the song is really beautiful and A-mei’s voice when that opening chorus line comes in is absolutely stunning. I also love the music as the percussion gives subtle, but much needed boosts of power while piano and guitar seem to play off of each other. It’s not one of her usual power ballads, but it still works wonderfully.\n\nSpeaking of power ballads, Lover? Enemy? comes storming in. This is a dark and dramatic ballad, but it shows A-mei’s versatility and how she can handle all different kinds of songs. With that said, whereas the last song is more timeless in its sound, I find the music to this one totally stuck in the 90’s with its synths. With that said, I love it and it is a favourite of mine. A-mei’s voice is at her most powerful and the music does a great job of really helping her voice soar.\n\nLove, Not Too Early or Too Late is Better is my least favourite song on the album. It is an upbeat song with a pop melody, while the music is a weird mix of pop and rock. It’s not a bad song per se, just weaker than everything else on here. It is relatively catchy, but it just doesn’t have the same attitude or hooks the other upbeat songs have nor does it have the emotional power. With that said, there are some really great parts to it like the bridge. A good song, but just outdone.\n\nFinishing the album on a powerful note, I Loved You is probably the most “Mandopop” sounding ballad on here as the melody reminds me of other songs that were released around this time. It has a really powerful accompaniment and I do like the energy that it brings, but I wish the melody stood out a bit more. With so many strong ballads on this album, it sort of sits in the shadow. It has its charms though.\n\nOverall: This is one of my favourite albums, if not my favourite. I love almost every song and the first eight songs are all strong while still giving a variety of sounds. While some of the songs are a bit outdated in the music, I find the melodies to be timeless and A-mei’s voice really helps keep the songs really engaging. Back in the day, I only liked a few songs from this album and would have ranked her first album higher, but this is definitely an album that is both cohesive, but full of individual hits.\n\nA+\n\nOften regarded as the “Pride of Taiwan”, A-mei debuted in 1996 and pretty much achieved overnight success. Her powerful voice tied in with her charismatic performances and classic songs allowed her to gain instant popularity, which she has been able to retain the last 20 years. Sisters is her debut album.\n\nReleased: December 13, 1996\n\n1. You Didn’t Want Anything (原來你什麼都不要)\n\n2. Sister (姊妹)\n\n3. Released (解脫)\n\n4. Impulse (衝動)\n\n5. Sea-foam Blue Tears (水藍色眼淚)\n\n6. Cut Love (剪愛)\n\n7. Betrayal (背叛)\n\n8. Love Until You Can’t Receive (愛到不能收)\n\n9. Seriously (認真)\n\n10. I’m a Dreamer on Air (空中的夢想家)\n\nProbably the biggest hit from the album and the song that has remained a classic since its release, You Didn’t Want Anything is a gorgeous piano ballad with some slight gospel elements to it. I think the most interesting thing about this song is that it feels slightly different from your usual Mandopop ballad of today. Utilizing A-mei’s powerful voice, the song just builds and builds and each section adds a little bit more instrumental backing before it finally explodes in the end and really allows A-mei to belt it out. Her voice sounds great here and she easily channels the emotion that the song needs. It’s just such a powerful track and it’s no surprise it is still popular today.\n\nThe title track is a nice change from the more dramatic opener. Here, with something a little more upbeat and lighthearted. To be honest, Sisters definitely comes off a bit more outdated than the last, but what I love most about this one is that it features a lot more Taiwanese Aborigine elements and really helps to give a sense of A-mei’s background. The bits of chanting surprisingly work with the more upbeat sound of the music and its heavy percussion. It’s a touching song in a way.\n\nOf course, we swing right back into the ballad one with Released. More laidback than the last two songs, this one focuses a lot more on the guitar and is definitely more melancholic. I quite like it, but the song is definitely not as exciting and as it goes on, it can get a bit dull. I do like that A-mei tries to spices things up with some riffs and runs around the end of the song. It’s a decent song.\n\nImpulse finally gets us up and dancing as it gives us a funky dance-pop tune where A-mei tries to edge it up a bit. I quite like the verses as they are definitely something sexy and one of the first glimpses of these kinds of songs from her. The chorus is still catchy and her voice is great, but I do find the chorus can get a bit grating at times as there is a part where it pushes her to sing a note in her head voice and it comes off like a squeak. The electric guitar refrain for the instrumental break really helps bring things back up though. It’s a cool song.\n\nMy favourite song from the album is actually Sea-foam Blue Tears. Not released as a promotional song, this is definitely one of the strongest songs from A-mei. A heavy focus on the acoustic guitar, I love how edgy it sounds. That and the emotion that she sings really echoes through here. She is able to inject the melody the needed amount of edge and emotion. The chorus is a bit different as it gives something with a touch of funk in its music, but it’s a nice touch that helps keep the energy up with the song. This is just a stellar tune.\n\nCut Love is one of the more traditional ballads on the album. It is very reminiscent of the types of songs that came out in the 90’s in Taiwan. The focus is largely on the piano, especially in the quieter verses, which are meant to show a contrast to the more hook heavy chorus. The chorus here does a great job of highlighting how strong A-mei vocals are, especially when the song starts to have the heavier percussion and electric guitar for the last one. I don’t think it’s the strongest ballad, but it is quite nice.\n\nBetrayal is a really cool song with its stronger R&B elements. I think it has similar qualities to that of Impulse, but instead we are given something a bit more laidback and I’m happy with that. However, the odd thing with this song is the odd transition from the prechorus to the chorus. It’s quite unpredictable as things comes off a little poppier in the chorus. However, I really enjoy the melody and it reminds me a bit of early 00’s J-Pop. Definitely one of the more fun songs despite being a bit outdated.\n\nLove Until You Can’t Receive is a really interesting ballad. It’s much more toned down and slower than the other songs. It starts off really ethereal and while the chorus does continue that with the music, I do find it all comes off a bit more emotional in this section. Her voice just really works so well here and I like how dramatic the whole song comes off.\n\nSeriously also continues the more dramatic ballad sound of the last song. However, I don’t think one comes off as emotional as that one did. It’s much more your standard Mandopop sound of the 90’s. The chorus is really explosive and I quite like it, but I do find the song to be one of the weaker songs on the album (it’s still good) as the melody doesn’t come across as memorable as other songs and it drags on a bit as it progresses. It really does show off A-Mei voice really well though.\n\nEnding the album is I’m a Dreamer on Air. This was actually released before the album and was a promotional song for the UFO Radio Station in Taiwan, which is why there is a weird line where she says UFO. With that said, the song itself is really good. It’s a bit more dreamy than the rest of the album, but it still fits in well. I think the highlight is that the melody is quite solid and comes off really sincere. There is a certain charm to it and A-mei’s vocals just carry the song really well. Great!\n\nOverall: This is one of my favourite C-Pop albums and one of the strongest I’ve heard. While there are definitely some stronger tracks, all the songs could potentially be singles. I quite like how there is a lot of variety and A-mei is able to bounce back and forth from ballads to midtempo pieces to something a bit more upbeat. Her voice really helps to bring the album up a notch and she shows her versatility.\n\nA+"
