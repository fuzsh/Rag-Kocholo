        "text": "Description\n\nG. Love & Special Sauce is an alternative hip hop band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are known for their unique, “sloppy”, and “laid back” blues sound that encompasses classic R&B. The band features Garrett Dutton, better known as G. Love, Jeffrey Clemens on drums, and Jim Prescott on bass. The “Yeah, It’s That Easy” CD reflects a very relaxed and laid back band. While the music isn’t quite as tight as some bands because of this, the sloppy blues, groove, hip-hop all works so well together. The end result are songs with more soul than most pop-soul acts these days. The drums keep the pace moving. The harmonica adds a nice touch to the band’s laid back blues sound. The up-right bass is also just right. The single releases from this album were “Stepping Stones” & “I-76”.\n\nTracks\n\n1 Stepping Stones2 I-763 Lay Down The Law4 Slipped Away (The Ballad Of Lauretha Vaird)5 You Shall See6 Take You There7 Willow Tree8 Yeah, It’s That Easy9 Recipe10 200 Years11 Making Amends12 Pull The Wool13 When We Meet Again"
