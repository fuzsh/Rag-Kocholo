True to her style, the song features ukelele as her backdrop along with brass instruments to mimic the original. The original is by far better, but Ayano brings something very cute to the tune with her slightly husky voice and the arrangement. She's had better, but this is a very cute cover. Pick this one up AND the original if you can find it.</P></td></tr></table>\n\n<table><tr align=\"top\"><td><b>\"<a href=\"http://pelikanol.phenominet.com/melodybomb/shibasaki-kou_ikutsuka-no-sora.mp3\">Ikutsuka no Sora</a>\"\n\n<i>Shibasaki Kou</i></b>\n\n[2004.01.14] [160 kbps] [6.70 mb]\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY>This is Shibasaki Kou's second 'official' single, although technically, this would be third release -- last year, she scored an unexpected smash hit with her song \"Tsuki no Shizuku,\" a powerful song for the movie <i>Yomigaeri</i>, but released it under the moniker RUI (the name of a singer in the movie, played by herself). This second single (theme song to yet another movie! -- <i>Chakushin Ari</i>) would officially be the follow-up to this her first single two years ago, and follows in the same vein as \"Tsuki no Shizuku.\" The song has a very quiet, demure feel to it, while at the same time the song delivers a very epic, grand feel to it with its mystical melody. A bit disappointing at the lack of variety, but for an actress-gone-singer who can actually sing <i>well</i>, there are little complaints.</p></td><td><img src=\"http://irev.net/mink/shibasaki_ikutsuka.jpg\" alt=\"ikutsuka no sora\"></td></tr></table>\n\n<table><tr align=\"top\"><td><img src=\"http://irev.net/mink/bonbon_voyage.jpg\" alt=\"bon voyage!\"></td><td><b>\"<a href=\"http://mink.sparklesystemsix.com/bon-bon-blanco_bonvoyage.mp3\">BON VOYAGE!</a>\"\n\n<i>BON-BON BLANCO</i></b>\n\n[2004.01.15] [192 kbps]\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This girl group is not your typical girly pop unit: the girls specialize in Latin-flavored beats. There is only one lead singer, while the others provide back-up while playing other instruments like the congo drums or even the maracas. To top it off, vocalist Anna has one heckuva a voice that's a lot stronger than most of the thin, cutesy voices you hear too much nowadays. \"BON VOYAGE!\" is the theme to the popular <i>One Piece</i> anime series, and it's a very happy, uptempo song.</p></td></tr></table>\n\n<table><tr align=\"top\"><td><b>\"<a href=\"http://mink.sparklesystemsix.com/koda-kumi_crazy4u.mp3\">CRAZY 4 U</a>\"\n\n<i>Koda Kumi</i></b>\n\n[2004.01.15] [192 kbps] [5.74 mb]\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Kumi's 10th single is her typical R&B-pop fare, if of a bit better quality than her past, mediocre singles. The dance/pop/R&B artist who got her overdue big break after singing the theme song to the popular Final Fantasy X-2 game, this song is the opening to the anime series <i>Gilgamesh</i>. \"CRAZY 4 U\" is nothing groundbreaking in terms of her typical music -- in fact, it sounds like yet another rehash of her previous songs, but it's not bad; you just feel like you've already heard it before. The chorus is expectedly catchy, and pop fans should find some comfort in this entire single, not just this track [the b-side is also quite good... for a Kumi song].</p></td><td><img src=\"http://irev.net/mink/koda_crazy4u.jpg\" alt=\"CRAZY 4 U\"></td></tr></table>\n\n<table><tr align=\"top\"><td><img src=\"http://irev.net/mink/kinki_ganbaru.jpg\" alt=\"ne, ganbaru yo.\"></td><td><b>\"<a href=\"http://pelikanol.phenominet.com/melodybomb/kinki-kids_ne-ganbaru-yo.mp3\">Ne, Ganbaru yo.</a>\"\n\n<i>KinKi Kids</i></b>\n\n[2004.01.15] [192 kbps] [5.98 mb]\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">KinKi Kids is the extremely popular duo under Johnny's, notorious for cranking out one boyband after another of prepubscent teens. Like SMAP, however, KinKi Kids is on the older end of the spectrum and still manage to hold up their end nicely, what with singing and acting on the side in dramas or musicals. Doumoto Tsuyoshi and Doumoto Koichi (no relation) also have another reputation to uphold: the boys hold the world record for the most #1 singles. Written by music gurus Dreams Come True, the song is pleasantly mellow, accompanied by a symphony and brass, giving it a very \"Sunday afternoon\" type of feel. KinKi fans should also pick it up for the 2 versions of karaoke tracks -- one without Koichi, the other without Tsuyoshi.</p></td></tr></table>\n\n<table><tr align=\"top\"><td><b>\"<a href=\"http://pelikanol.phenominet.com/melodybomb/kiroro_mou-sukoshi.mp3\">Mou Sukoshi</a>\"\n\n<i>Kiroro</i></b>\n\n[2004.01.21] [128 kbps] [4.10 mb]\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">After a relatively quiet year, Kiroro releases their first single of 2004. This piano/vocals team of Tamashiro Chiharu (vocals) and Kinjo Ayano (piano) gently stepped into the music scene in 1998 with their extremely popular single, \"Nagai Aida,\" and have since established a reputation for their poignantly melodic songs. [They have also garnered comparisons to another piano duo by the name of Hana*Hana.] This sweet love ballad hardly strays from their usual formula, and you can take that one of two ways: charmingly sweet, or yet another tiresome bore.</p></td><td><img src=\"http://irev.net/mink/kiroro_sukoshi.jpg\" alt=\"mou sukoshi\"></td></tr></table>\n\n<table><tr align=\"top\"><td><img src=\"http://irev.net/mink/goto_paintgold.jpg\" alt=\"2 paint it gold\"></td><td><b>\"<a href=\"http://mink.kawaii.nu/goto-maki_paint-it-gold.mp3\">Paint It Gold</a>\"\n\n<i>Goto Maki</i></b>\n\n[2004.01.28] [192 kbps] [6.01 mb]\n\nThe title track off her second album <i>2 Paint It Gold</i>, what idol pop singer Goto Maki lacks in terms of cover art, she makes up in the quality of the album. The record is a smattered variety of pop, from the upbeat pop fare of \"Daite yo! PLEASE GO ON\" or \"Scramble,\" the softer R&B song \"Himitsu,\" or even the uncharacteristic simple piano ballad, \"Namida no Hoshi.\" This track, however, is a look back at 70s synth pop. Unearthing a rather demanding tone rarely seen in her lyrics, the song is upbeat, dramatic, and well-executed. Sucker for this genre? Give it a spin.</p></td></tr></table>\n\n***\n\n<lj-cut text=\"And for next time...?\">\n\n<b>The last of the January releases...</b>\n\n<i>Please request TWO maximum.

This means that in order to get the files off this site, you will need to download Netpumper.\n\nThose of you who aren't familiar with Netpumper, it's similar to download programs like GetRight or Download Accelerator, but unlike those, this one is also specific to these Anti-Leech protected files [you can also use it in place of GetRight or whatnot too]. And yes, it's free. :P The app is about 3 MB to download, and I do know a couple of other mp3 sites use this too. Sorry for the hassle of making you guys download it if you don't have it already, but that will be the only way to access files.\n\nYes, there is spyware. HOWEVER, it's not as bad as you think [at least personally, it hasn't been] and you can easily uninstall it with little programs like Ad-Aware or Spybot.\n\n( For Netpumper newbies: how to grab the files (although you don't really need an explanation)Collapse )\n\nAlso, I am in need of yet another host. I'm not able to host files on ayomedia.com anymore, and I don't want all the traffic directed at kawaii.nu, so if anyone has free space to offer so I can upload about 4 or 5 mp3s for about a week and then delete them [in typical melodyBOMB rotation], I'd be extremely grateful and VERY appreciative. If anyone could help me out, I'd really appreciate it -- just drop me a comment or a line on meltingnoise.\n\nThe update will be posted [chock full of new releases!] once I find a second host! Much thanks!\n\nAlso, if you have any Netpumper-related questions, please drop a comment as well!\n\n-- mink"
