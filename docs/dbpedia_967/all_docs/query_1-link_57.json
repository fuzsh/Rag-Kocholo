        "text": "The universal language of music has united generations of lovers since the beginning of time. Falling in and out of love, grasping at unrequited love, mourning love lost and succumbing to deep love are central to the human experience. Love peels back emotions, incorporating complex feelings that come across powerfully in the common language of music. With endless love songs to describe matters of the heart, the top love songs according to music lovers of all ages connect the past with the present.\n\nTop Love Songs\n\nLove stories in the form of songs translate feelings that spoken words can’t. From mainstream pop music to R&B, soul, jazz, country and rock ballads, this list spans types of love, as well as genres, languages and generations. While mainstream popular songs dominate the collective consciousness, there are many relatable and well-known love songs that fly just under-the-radar, and this list also covers those.\n\nClassics like Etta James’ “At Last,” Tony Bennett’s “For Once in My Life,” or Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” are all familiar, universal songs, bringing a certain nostalgia understood across generations. Movie soundtracks in the 90s, once a vehicle for discovering new music before streaming took over, housed popular love songs like Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On” from the iconic 1997 film, Titanic, whereas Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You,” is synonymous with the 1992 romance thriller blockbuster, The Bodyguard, starring Kevin Costner and Houston. With the rise in popularity of neo-soul, R&B and electronic music in the early and mid 2000s, this curated list includes songs from Amy Winehouse, SWV, Jill Scott, Frank Ocean and Outkast. As it turns out, the 1960s were a sweet spot for love songs, too, with emotional ballads from Frank Sinatra, Sam Cooke, Minnie Ripperton and Stevie Wonder.\n\n50. \"Unforgettable\" by Nat King Cole (1951)\n\nNat King Cole’s voice has permeated generations for nearly 100 years. A jazz vocalist, pianist and actor with over 100 chart-topping songs including the reworked version of “Unforgettable” featuring his daughter, Natalie, Cole remains a voice of love.\n\n49. \"Sweet Love\" by Anita Baker (1986)\n\nR&B singer and songwriter Anita Baker has a song for everyone. “Sweet Love” from Baker’s second album, Rapture, was an instant success and won her a Grammy for Best R&B song in 1987. “Sweet Love” starts out with sweeping drum booms and piano as her voice drops in like an angel. The emotion of Baker’s vocal delivery speaks love into existence which is why this song is one of the greatest of all time.\n\n48. \"Unchained Melody\" by The Righteous Brothers (1965)\n\nBill Medley and Bobby Hatfield weren’t brothers but their musical chemistry was undeniable, timeless and defined much of the 1960’s “blue eyed soul” genre that originated in Southern California. Originally written in 1955 by Alex North and Hy Zaret, \"Unchained Melody,\" appeared as the music for the prison film, Unchained, becoming a music standard with over 1,500 recordings in multiple languages.\n\n47. \"By Your Side\" by Sade (2000)\n\nEnglish band, Sade, fronted by Nigerian-born British singer Sade Adu’s smooth vocal and visual presence has been the soundtrack to love stories since the 1980s. Sade’s music changed the course of contemporary soul music with its unique sound and storytelling. “By Your Side” was released as the lead single on Sade’s Lovers Rock album in both the United States and in the United Kingdom and went on to garner a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 2001.\n\n46. “Cigarettes & Coffee” by Otis Redding (1966)\n\nThe title of Otis Redding’s soul song “Cigarettes & Coffee,” might not be an obvious love song, but upon a deeper dive, the sultry sound, pace and lyrics emanate a feeling of a love language many can identity with – quality time. The words are sweet and take you back to a time – before social media and supercomputers in the pocket–where just being in the same room with your love was enough to make the heart full. “People, I say it's so early in the morning / it's a quarter 'til three / we're sittin' here talkin' over cigarettes and drinking coffee / now lord / and I'll like to show you, well I've known nothing, but good old joy since I met you, darling / honey, since I've met you, baby, yeah.”\n\n45. \"I Will Always Love You\" by Whitney Houston (1992)\n\nWhitney Houston took the world by storm when she came onto the scene with a powerful voice that incorporated gospel singing style into popular music. In addition to her work as a global superstar singer selling over 220 million records worldwide, Houston was an actress and film producer who was mourned the world over when she died in 2012. “I Will Always Love You,” written by Dolly Parton, will go down in history as the theme song for the 1992 romance thriller, The Bodyguard, starring Kevin Costner and Houston.\n\n44. “At Last” by Etta James (1960)\n\nPerhaps one of the most requested wedding songs, Etta James’ “At Last” tells the story of love found. “At last, my love has come along / the lonely days are over / and life is like a song.” One of the most famous jazz standards, originally written in 1941 for musical Sun Valley Serenade, “At Last,” was made extremely popular through James’ sultry rendition, and has also been recorded by Celine Dion and Beyoncé.\n\n43. \"Let's Stay Together\" by Al Green (1972)\n\nAl Green’s unmatched falsetto takes soul music to another level. Green’s “Let’s Stay Together” departed from much of his music commenting on political and social activities of the 1970s and turned to love. Recorded in Memphis as the lead track from Green’s Let’s Stay Together album, the title song is a joyful ride to true love that makes you “feel so brand new.”\n\n42. \"My Heart Will Go On\" by Céline Dion (1997)\n\nRecorded for the iconic late 90s film, Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, “My Heart Will Go On” is considered Dion’s signature song and one the best selling songs in music history telling the story that love is never lost, even in death.\n\n41. \"Como fue\" by Beny Moré (1968)\n\nCuban singer, songwriter and the eldest of 18 children, Beny Moré was a leader in son cubano – a style of music that leaned heavily on improvisation, making his sound unique. “Como fue” is entirely in Spanish and even if you don’t speak the language, the feeling of the song is universally rooted in deep love. The lyrics translate beautifully making “Como fue” one of the best love songs of all time.\n\n40. \"I Just Called To Say I Love You\" by Stevie Wonder (1984)\n\nWhat would a best love songs of all time list be without the imitable Stevie Wonder? The multitalented Wonder wrote, produced and performed “I Just Called To Say I Love You,” the lead single from the 1987 film, The Woman in Red. A heartfelt song literally about not calling for any other reason than to say “I love you,” feel good hits like this are rare and timeless.\n\n39. “I Love You” by Faith Evans (2001)\n\nAt the age of 20, R&B singer Faith Evans got into the music business and throughout the 1990s and 2000s remained a voice of the time. The song “I Love You” was originally written for Jennifer Lopez's second studio album, J.Lo (2001), but ended up on Faithfully, Evans’ third album. The lyrics say it all in this heartfelt R&B ballad with a very simple beat. “I love you (I love you) / I want you (I want you) / You're the one that I live for / And I can't take it anymore (anymore) / I love you (I love you) / I need you (and I need you) / What can I do to make you see / You're the only one for me.”\n\n38. “Reasons” by Earth, Wind & Fire (1975)\n\nChicago’s fantastic funk assemblage of Earth, Wind & Fire was known for fusing genres like jazz, soul and even disco with their signature funk sound, and the timeless song “Reasons” is no exception. A heavily and ironically requested wedding dance-floor jam, “Reasons,” is a love ballad about a one-night stand that went from lust to dust in hours.\n\n37. \"You Are So Beautiful\" by Joe Cocker (1974)\n\nLove songs aren’t always about romantic love. The song “You Are So Beautiful,” originally written by musical savant Billy Preston, was inspired by his actress mother, and the deep love and beauty he saw in her. Recorded later by English singer Joe Cocker at a slower pace, the new version of Preston’s song became Cocker's highest-charting song in the United States, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n36. \"Somethin' Stupid\" by Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra (1966)\n\nFrank Sinatra and daughter Nancy deliver this duet with unmatched melodies and the sort of calmness that love can sometimes bring. The almost country-esque wobble of the strumming guitar and drum patterns contrasted with a cinematic string section feel almost embarrassingly romantic, like young love.\n\n35. \"What You Won't Do For Love\" by Bobby Caldwell\n\nThe soulful nature of Caldwell’s “What You Won’t Do For Love” crosses generations with pop cover by legendary Tupac Shakur under the title “Do For Love,” and numerous samples in popular songs that came after it. Caldwell’s vocal timbre is matched with a horn section and loving bass-lines that more deeply tell the story of what. Caldwell “won’t do for love.”\n\n34. “Endless Love” by Lionel Richie & Diana Ross (1981)\n\nA strong duet from two of the boldest singers of our time, Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, “Endless Love,” is a call and response ballad of everlasting love. The song released by Motown records became a nominated instant hit as the theme song for the film Endless Love starring Brooke Shields.\n\n33. \"Can't Help Falling In Love\" by Elvis Presley (1961)\n\nBased on the melody from a popular 1784 French love song, and written for the 1961 film, Blue Hawaii, “Can’t Help Falling In Love,” sung by Elvis Presley is an extremely smooth and heartfelt piece of music, crosses generations with truthful and timeless lyrics. “Like a river flows / surely to the sea / darling so it goes, some things are meant to be.”\n\n32. \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" by Hank Williams (1949)\n\nThis beautiful country ballad is so sad that its relatable to anyone who has lost love and gained a hole in their heart. An under-the-radar song, many discovered this lonely hit via popular 1993 rags-to-riches movie, The Beverly Hillbillies.\n\n31. “Crazy” by Patsy Cline (1961)\n\nA country standard and Patsy Cline’s most popular song, “Crazy,” written by Willie Nelson, is a ballad dedicated to the tangled emotions of love. One of the first women to shine in her genre, Cline was one of the early singers to cross into pop music territory from country music.\n\n30. \"My Cherie Amor\" by Stevie Wonder (1969)\n\nThe funky, soulful Stevie Wonder originally wrote a kernel of the song “My Cherie Amor” in just one hour about a girlfriend he’d met at the Michigan School for the Blind in Lansing, Michigan in 1966. The mixture of English and a slight nod to French makes this love song dreamy and somewhat adventurous.\n\n29. “My Girl” by The Temptations (1965)\n\nThe sixties really gave us a lot and “My Girl” by The Temptations is no exception. The reference to “sunshine on a cloudy day” breathes life into the seasons of love in this upbeat jam. A classic from the Motown era, “My Girl” became the five-man band’s signature song.\n\n28. \"The Way You Look Tonight\" by Tony Bennett (1997)\n\nA classic making its first appearance in the 1930s with Fred Astaire, “The Way You Look Tonight” is a love song that has stood the test of time with renditions by Tony Bennett, Billy Holiday and Sir Elton John. This romantic standard is the perfect way to compliment the special person in your life when words won’t do.\n\n27. \"What The World Needs Now Is Love\" by Burt Bacharach (1965)\n\nBurt Bacharach, one of the most influential songwriters and composers in modern music history delivers the timeless message of love for one another through the political and social realities of the 1960s making “What The World Needs Now Is Love\" a staple in community building and a reminder of humanity. Bacharach received three Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, six Grammy Awards, an Primetime Emmy Award and over 1,000 artists have recorded his songs.\n\n26. \"Loving You\" by Minnie Ripperton (1965)\n\nThe soft, nature-influenced song “Loving You” by Minnie Ripperton is a quintessential proclamation of love. With its delicate lyrics, springtime bird chirping and vocal layers shifting between soulful riffs and high notes, Ripperton’s range spans the complexities of romance.\n\n25. \"Me and Mrs. Jones\" by Billy Paul (1972)\n\nSoul singer Billy Paul lays it all on the line with “Me and Mrs. Jones,” a song about a secret affair with his lover. A go-to slow jam since the 1970s, this song reflects the realities humans deal with when it comes to lust.\n\n24. “Easy” by The Commodores (1977)\n\nQuintessential funk and soul band The Commodores, known for their songs “Brickhouse” and “Three Times A Lady,” made it big with “Easy,” a hit that elevated the supergroup to rockstar status. “Easy,” a slow song about a breakup written by Lionel Richie, laces feelings of relief (“I’m easy like Sunday morning”) with freedom-inducing electric guitar riffs and sensible, multidimensional background vocals.\n\n24. “Always Be My Baby” by Mariah Carey (1995)\n\n“Always Be My Baby” is a minimal R&B love song from Mariah Carey – the unofficial queen of Christmas. The playful nature of this song speaks to Carey’s signature songwriting style – creative, loving well-arranged, and in this case unconditional: “We were as one, babe / For a moment in time / And it seemed everlasting / That you would always be mine / Now you want to be free / So I'm lettin' you fly / 'Cause I know in my heart babe / Our love will never die.”\n\n23. \"With Or Without You\" by U2 (1987)\n\nU2’s classic sound was pivotal in popular music in the 1980s and into the 2000s and “With Or Without You” is one of those songs that lives in the mainstream memory bank. A song about waiting patiently for a lover while witnessing their own self-destruction uncovers the side of love that requires work.\n\n22. \"U Got it Bad\" by Usher (2001)\n\nUsher not only had the voice of the 2000s, but the dance moves to tell the whole story of R&B during that era. \"U Got it Bad,\" is about hanging on to every last word of your lover, missing them when one day goes by, and feeling so deeply for your person that’s all you can think about. The song’s video which aired during MTV primetime, featured TLC’s late Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas alongside Usher showing the dynamics a couple goes through when they’ve “got it bad.”\n\n21. \"Missing You\" by John Waite (1984)\n\nEnglish musician John Waite struck gold with “Missing You,” a hit single that topped charts and was subsequently featured in iconic films Selena (1997) and Warm Bodies (2013), the video game, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the TV series Miami Vice. The song is in the distorted 1980s soft rock soul style and emotes a sad yet uplifting quality.\n\n20. \"How Do I Live\" by Leann Rimes\n\nWith emotional and vocal stamina akin to an elder, “How Do I Live” was recorded by 14-year-old Leann Rimes, setting her career on an upward trajectory. “How Do I Live” was released by Leann Rimes on the same day in 1997 as singer Trisha Yearwood released a similar version of the song. Both country singers of different generations and styles, unaware that they’d recorded the same song, will go down in history as a study in music marketing with Rimes’ take of the song positioned as Contemporary and Yearwood’s rendition pitched as the Country version.\n\n19. \"If I Ain’t Got You\" by Alicia Keys (2003)\n\nAlicia Keys took the world by storm as a new voice in R&B when she dropped \"If I Ain't Got You” and hasn’t left the mainstream cannon ever since. This ballad speaks to the importance of human connection over things as Keys sings: “Some people want it all / But I don't want nothin' at all / If it ain't you, baby / If I ain't got you, baby / Some people want diamond rings / Some just want everything / But everything means nothin' / If I ain't got you, yeah.”\n\n18. \"Just You 'N' Me\" by Chicago (1973)\n\nA fan favorite of many who grew up in the 1960s, Chicago’s “simple and free” song, \"Just You 'N' Me,\" maintains a version of funk rock relatable to the masses, laced with danceable rhythms and an incredible horn and woodwind sections. The song, written after a lovers spat, tells the story of getting back to the basics of love without distraction – partner to partner.\n\n17. “Weak” by SWV (1992)\n\nThis song needs no introduction as it does it all on its own: “Time after time after time I try to hide it / Your love is strong it keeps on holding on.” Sisters with Voices known as SWV, was a 1990s trio with a unique look, sound and groove to their music and the song “Weak” stands the test of time with lyrics that speak to anyone who has ever had a deep crush or been madly in love.\n\n16. \"Sultan Qalbam\" by Ahmed Zahir (1970)\n\nAfghan singer, songwriter and composer Ahmed Zahir sings this love song “Sultan Qalbam\" in Dari, the Afghan dialect of Farsi (Persian). While the translation to English will never be completely accurate, parts of \"Sultan Qalbam\" poetically speak of love in a globally relatable manner: “I will make paper from flower leaves / I will send you a sweet letter / I will write the secret of my love / O new flower, after greetings, I love you.”\n\n15. “Brown Sugar” by D’Angelo (1995)\n\nFor some time, people thought D’Angelo’s “Brown Sugar” was about his then girlfriend, Angie Stone, but as it turns out, the song was about his love... of marijuana. Not all love is romantic love and D’Angelo expresses this in his ambiguously sexy hit, “Brown Sugar.”\n\n14. “Tell Him” by Lauryn Hill (1998)\n\nIn another twist of love, the very last song on Lauryn Hill’s classic and quintessential album, The Miseducation of Lauyrn Hill, is the gorgeous dedication to what many think is Jesus Christ in “Tell Him.” While the song is not explicitly about Hill’s religious beliefs, to some it could sound like the song is about a man (“Tell him I need him/ tell him I love him”), the biblical references are laced throughout the song. Hill’s beautifully soulful voice brings out emotions that only a deep dedication to a person or a core belief could.\n\n13. \"Take My Breath Away (Love Theme From Top Gun)” by Berlin (1986)\n\nMade for the hit 1986 movie, Top Gun, starring Tom Cruise, Berlin’s \"Take My Breath Away” is everything a movie’s love theme song should be – dreamy, romantic and highly catchy. The song unsurprisingly won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song right before the six-person group broke up.\n\n12. \"La-La Means I Love You\" by The Delfonics (1968)\n\nThe Philadelphia soul trio The Delfonics had a signature sound, and \"La-La Means I Love You\" showcased it well, complete with incredible harmonies, strong string sections and a mid-tempo groove. \"La-La Means I Love You\" is a love song that is unsure of itself as the lyrics attempt to convince a woman this man is the one for her: “If I ever saw a girl / That I needed in this world / You are the one for me (One for me) / Let me hold you in my arms / Girl, and thrill you with my charms / I'm sure you will see (You will see) / The things I am sayin' are true / And the way I explain them to you / Listen to me.”\n\n11. \"Some Unholy War\" by Amy Winehouse (2006)\n\nAn under-the-radar song by the late great British soul powerhouse, Amy Winehouse, “Some Unholy War,” speaks to her commitment to love, even through a fictitious war. “If my man was fighting some unholy war / I would be behind him / Straight, shook up beside him / With strength he didn't know / It's you I'm fighting for.” This song was premiered onstage at Glasontbury in 2008.\n\n10. \"Best Part (feat. H.E.R.) by Daniel Cesar & H.E.R.\n\nTwo R&B stars with unconventional rises to fame came together to create “Best Part,” a rendition of D’Angelo’s “Untitled (How Does It Feel).” A delicate guitar played by H.E.R. with Daniel Cesar’s deep voice coming in nicely tells the dual story of young love: “If life is a movie, you’re the best part.”\n\n9. \"Bring It On Home To Me\" by Sam Cooke (1968)\n\nOne of the most versatile soul singers of all time, Sam Cooke, brings deep emotion to music through his ability to oscillate between disparate music genres and styles. \"Bring It On Home To Me\" is a call-and-response love song with Lou Rawls on backup vocals as Cooke longs for his lover to come back home.\n\n8. “Say Yes” by Floetry (2003)\n\nNeo-soul duo Marsha Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart crossed over from the U.K. and into mainstream music with Grammy-nominated “Say Yes,” a sensual, honest soul song about keeping it simple in love by saying “yes.” “All you gotta do is say yes/ Don't deny what you feel / Let me undress you baby, open up your mind just rest / I'm about to let you know, you make me so.”\n\n7. “Protoype” by Outkast (2004)\n\nDriven by simple guitar riffs and Andre3000’s smooth voice, Outkast’s “Prototype” isn’t your typical love song but it should be. The duo masterfully weaves in funk, soul, and incredible songwriting to speak to the birth of love in the form of a rare prototype.\n\n6. “Just Like Heaven” by The Cure (1987)\n\nThe Cure, a quintessential 1980s band created a sound recognizable across generations, social cliques and oceans. The British rock band’s “Just Like Heaven” is a love song about “hyperventilating – kissing and fainting to the floor,” casting no shadow on adventure, fun and letting go.\n\n5. \"I Want To Know What Love Is\" by Foreigner (1984)\n\nLooking back at his past relationships, Foreigner’s lead guitarist Mick Jones, wrote this song wanting to know what a healthy, viable love looked like – a therapy session to and for himself. By the time the song was written, recorded, and released, its relatable subject matter topped the charts, making it Foreigner’s number-one song.\n\n4. “Tell Me” by Groove Theory (1995)\n\nThe debut single from the R&B duo, Groove Theory, “Tell Me” is a head-nodding love song about finding love at the right time as an independent woman. Fronted by the generously soulful singer, Amel Larrieux, Groove Theory found its niche at the intersection of mainstream and underground.\n\n3. \"He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat)\" by Jill Scott (2000)\n\nJill Scott is powerful, candid and curious in her writing and performance. In \"He Loves Me (Lyzel in E Flat),\" Scott recounts the ways her partner loves her in the most descriptive and intricate details and settings. The song sounds and feels like love.\n\n2. \"Thinkin Bout You\" by Frank Ocean (2012)\n\nFrank Ocean came on the scene with his debut album, channel ORANGE, with lead single “Thinking Bout You,” and suddenly love music encompassed new genres that he uniquely stylized with hints of R&B, experiential soul, and hip hop. The internet has a lifetime of memes about “Thinkin Bout You’s” intro lyrics: “A tornado flew around my room before you came / Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in / Southern California, much like Arizona / My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when / I'm thinkin' 'bout you.”\n\n1. “All I Do” by Tami Terrell (1966)\n\nMotown singer Tami Terrell put her own soulful spin on Stevie Wonder’s “All I Do (Is Think About You)” and released the song “All I Do” in 1966. Terrel’s signature sound was explosive and forever shaped the future of love songs.\n\nBottom Line"
