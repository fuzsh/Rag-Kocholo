For Japanese popular culture, see Japanese popular culture.\n\nJ-pop (ジェーポップ, jēpoppu) (often stylized in all caps; an abbreviated form of \"Japanese popular music\"), natively also known simply as pops (ポップス, poppusu), is the name for a form of popular music that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional music of Japan, and significantly in 1960s pop and rock music. J-pop replaced kayōkyoku (\"Lyric Singing Music\"), a term for Japanese popular music from the 1920s to the 1980s in the Japanese music scene.[2]\n\nQuick Facts Stylistic origins, Cultural origins ...\n\nClose\n\nJapanese rock bands such as Happy End fused the Beatles and Beach Boys-style rock with Japanese music in the 1960s–1970s.[3] J-pop was further defined by new wave and crossover fusion acts of the late 1970s, such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Southern All Stars.[4] Popular styles of Japanese pop music include city pop and technopop during the 1970s–1980s, and J-Euro (such as Namie Amuro)[5] and Shibuya-kei during the 1990s–2000s."
