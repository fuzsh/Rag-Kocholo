Misia's song 'Lágrima' is a poignant exploration of unrequited love and the deep emotional turmoil it brings. The lyrics are steeped in sorrow and longing, capturing the essence of fado, a traditional Portuguese music genre known for its melancholic and soulful nature. Misia, a renowned fado singer, uses her powerful voice to convey the depth of her despair and the intensity of her emotions.

The song begins with the singer expressing her pain and sorrow, stating that she goes to bed full of grief and wakes up with even more. This cyclical nature of her suffering highlights the inescapable nature of her heartache. The repeated mention of 'penas' (sorrows) emphasizes the weight of her emotional burden. The singer's love for the person is so profound that it has become an intrinsic part of her being, as she mentions that this way of loving has stayed in her chest.

As the song progresses, the singer reveals her inner conflict. She claims not to want the person she loves, yet she dreams of them every night. This contradiction underscores the complexity of her feelings, where her mind and heart are at odds. The mention of a 'castigo' (punishment) within her suggests that her love is both a source of joy and torment. The imagery of extending her shawl on the ground and falling asleep conveys a sense of resignation and surrender to her fate.

In the final verses, the singer contemplates death as a release from her suffering. She imagines that if she knew her death would make the person she loves cry, she would find joy in that act. This morbid yet tender sentiment encapsulates the depth of her love and the extent of her despair. The song 'Lágrima' is a powerful testament to the pain of unrequited love and the emotional scars it leaves behind, beautifully rendered through Misia's evocative performance.
