        "text": "So, this was something I discovered by accident.\n\nIt appears that in 1814, Charlotte of Wales, daughter of the future George IV, was quite interested in marrying Frederick, Prince of Prussia, son of Prince Louis Charles of Prussia and his wife Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (who would later marry Ernest Augustus I of Hanover), however, the marriage plans were interrupted when Frederick suddenly married Luise of Anhalt-Bernburg\n\nMy query is, what would've changed had instead of becoming engaged to Alexius, Frederick and Charlotte had indeed married. Otl, Charlotte died in childbirth, and Fred had two sons with his with. Let's assume that Charlotte successfully delivers a reasonably healthy baby boy, in 1815, that prevents some of the later succession issues I imagine.\n\nWhat sort of role could Frederick have as the second in line's husband? He was quite the military man otl, would he look to pursue a similar career here?\n\nWhat would their marriage do for relations between Britain and Prussia?\n\nEdited\n\nBut yes, consequences?\n\n@DrakeRlugia did a TL a few years ago on such a premise. It was called Europe's Hope or something. It was (alongside his TL Prince of the Peace and SpaceOddity's Now Blooms the Tudor Rose) really good, although it never made it into the 1820s IIRC.\n\nFor one it butterflies the Coburg rise to prominence (THANK GOD) - since Leopold would remain a penniless younger son of a post-stamp sized duchy in Europe whose one sister had a disastrous marriage with a Russian grand duke and who himself had had an affair (reportedly) with either/both Joséphine and Hortense de Beauharnais.\n\nAs to Anglo-Prussian relations, I'm not sure. Fritz was the nephew and the first cousin of successive Prussian kings, and his personal fortune was Schönhausen Palace. But I have a feeling the whole state of affairs would depend on how often he goes to Berlin. AFAIK during their marriage Leopold never visited Coburg once, whether HRH Prince Fritz treats Berlin the same IDK. I could be getting muddled with the TL about Charlotte mentioned above, but FWIII wanted some or other assurances about his nephew's future (like income and a place to live) that George IV was reluctant to give and the king of Prussia regarded it as an insult.\n\n@DrakeRlugia did a TL a few years ago on such a premise.

I do think Parliament would give him a reasonable allowance should he marry the second in line to the throne, I do think as well that they'd be staying at either Buckingham, or St James, no?\n\nOh that's quite interesting, not heard of that, but could be something to consider.

They wouldn't be at Buck House since that was Queen Charlotte's private home, and St. James' was mostly given over to grease and fervour lodgings and was only used for the royal levées and receiving ambassadors in the reign of George III.\n\nCan't remember who was at Kensington, but I think it was reserved for lesser members (the Gloucesters, the Kents, the spinster sisters of George IV) of the royal family. Parliament's not exactly going to be willing to shell out the dough to fix Kensington up to be the home of an heiress. Claremont/Camelford/Cliveden had the benefit that Charlotte could move in as is, no fixing up required. Kensington hadn't had a monarch/heir to the throne since Anne was duchess of Cumberland IIRC\n\nCan't remember who was at Kensington, but I think it was reserved for lesser members (the Gloucesters, the Kents, the spinster sisters of George IV) of the royal family.

OTL she was her father's only child, and was only aged 18 months when he died. That rewrites any number of royal genealogies. In particular, Kaiser Wilhelm II is never born - at least not the one we know. If there is a Prussian marriage in the next generation, it would be to a daughter of Charlotte, and have different children.\n\nIf Charlotte's son goes on to have sons of his own, GB gets a line of Hohenzollern Kings. Anglo-Prussian relations should be good, but OTL they were quite reasonable anyway until the naval race started up. That may be less likely. Could well produce a family pact of some kind \"You be the general and I'll be the Admiral\".\n\nLong shot. Could the Danish heiress who OTL married the future Christian IX, perhaps marry a Hohenzollern instead? That would probably mean no war in 1864.\n\nMajor changes.\n\nThere may well be no Victoria.

I don't think anyone would be looking for a union of crowns.\n\nAnd would this prevent Christian inheriting Denmark?\n\nMuch more probable. The Russians might not be keen on a close relative of the King of England ruling there, but OTOH his relations with Prussia were good, and France wd be little concerned either way. So a Hohenzollern succession in Denmark is quite possible."
