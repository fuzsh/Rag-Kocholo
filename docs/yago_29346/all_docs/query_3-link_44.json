        "text": "Born at Buckingham Palace on 18th March 1848, Princess Louise was the sixth child and fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The timing of Louise’s birth coincided with political revolutions, which had swept through Europe and Britain, starting on 12th January 1848 and ending on 4th October 1849, by which time over fifty countries had been affected! Due to this, Queen Victoria believed Louise would grow up to be troublesome and “something peculiar”. These superstitions led Victoria to remain cautious of her Louise’s actions throughout the rest of her life.\n\nThe princess was baptised in the Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace, on 13th May 1848. She was given the names Louisa Caroline Alberta, although she was known by everyone as ‘Louise’ and nicknamed ‘Loosy’ by her close family. Louise’s godparents included: Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen; and Princess Augusta, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nLike her siblings, Louise was brought up with the strict programme of education devised by her father, Prince Albert and Baron Stockmar. As well as formal studies, she was taught practical tasks, such as cooking, cleaning, gardening, shopkeeping and carpentry; but from a young age it was clear that her talents lay with art. As daughter of the Queen, it was impossible for the Princess to pursue an artistic career. However, Victoria allowed Louise to attend art school and be tutored by sculptor, Mary Thornycroft, who had been commissioned by Victoria and Albert on several occasions. In 1863, Louise was also allowed to attend the National Art Training School, now known as The Royal College of Art.\n\nOut of all her siblings, Louise perhaps had one of the strongest personalities. She was intelligent, talented in almost everything she did, with her wit and good nature always keeping the royal household and staff entertained. Her inquisitive nature helped her to become a favourite of her fathers, also gaining her the nickname ‘Little Miss Why’. Along with art, one of her main talents was dancing. In her journal, Queen Victoria wrote that Louise “danced the sword dance with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters”. However, her popularity amongst her parents caused much resentment from her sister, Princess Helena, who was equally as talented but had been overshadowed by Louise’s charm.\n\nThe princess’s life dramatically changed after the death of Prince Albert in December 1861. With Princess Helena too upset to help, Louise was asked to aid Princess Alice with the Queens official papers and duties. With all joy removed from the royal palaces, life had become too repetitive and mundane for the lively princess. For her seventeenth birthday, Louise requested the ballroom to be reopened for a debutante dance but the Queen was quick to say no, leaving Louise bitterly disappointed.\n\nAfter Princess Alice and Princess Helena left home to get married, Princess Louise succeeded the role of her mothers unofficial secretary. Originally Victoria was cautious about giving her the role, believing Louise to be too indiscreet, but she later wrote that “She is (and who would some years ago have thought it?) a clever dear girl with a fine strong character, unselfish and affectionate.”\n\nOut of all eight if her siblings, Louise was closest to her youngest brother, Prince Leopold, who suffered haemophilia. In March 1866 Lieutenant Walter George Stirling, was hired as Leopold’s tutor. He attended various family outings, parties and dinners. Leopold thrived under his care until he was abruptly dismissed just four months later without any explanation. Over a year later, more rumours spread that Stirling has actually got Louise pregnant. While researching about the Princess, Louise’s biographer, Lucinda Hawksley was left confused to be told that all of Louise’s private documents are banned from the public, again with no explanation. Despite no hardcore evidence, Lucinda noted how Louise’s fashion taste changed dramatically during 1866 and she made little to no public appearances until February 1867. The same month, Louise’s older brother, Prince Albert Edward and his wife Alexandra named their first daughter Louise, possibly as a way to consolidate the princess after giving up her own child.\n\nIt is believed the child was Henry Locock, who was adopted by Frederick Locock, son of Queen Victoria’s gynaecologist, Sir Charles Locock, in late 1866. According to the Lococks, Louise visited Henry all through his childhood. As Lucinda Hawksley discovered, Princess Louise was known to love spending time at her country home of Dornden in Kent, which was coincidentally right next door to a house owned by Charles Locock. You can learn more about the possible scandal in my blog ‘Did Princess Louise have an illegitimate son?’\n\nOver time, Louise became fed up with court live. Her duties which were little more than minor secretarial tasks, such as writing letters on the queen’s behalf; dealing with political correspondence; and providing the queen with company. Eventually Louise started to undertake more public duties and, in 1867, opened the new North Eastern Hospital for Children.\n\nAlthough Louise was considered the most beautiful and elegance of Victoria’s daughters, her liberal and feminist views were a cause for concern and prompted the Queen to start looking for a husband. However, like with her other children, Victoria wanted a match that suited her just as much as it did Louise. Many suitors were suggested, including: Princess Alexandras brother, the Crown Prince of Denmark; Prince Albert of Prussia; and William, Prince of Orange, although his extravagant Parisian lifestyle cohabiting with his lover quickly caused him to be removed from the equation.\n\nDespite all the suggestions, Louise decided not to marry a prince, leading Queen Victoria to look at possible aristocratic suitors. At first, Louise wasn’t convinced when Victoria suggested John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, however her feelings soon changed when she met John at one of Gladstones famous breakfasts. Louise’s older brother, Prince Albert Edward, was highly against the match and believed it too political. Despite her sons views, Victoria viewed Louise’s choice as a positive, saying it would “be for Louise’s happiness and for the peace and quiet of the family” she also agreed it would bring “new blood” into the family. Louise became engaged to John Campbell on 3rd October 1870, at Balmoral and they married at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21st March 1871. You can read more in ‘The wedding of Princess Louise and John Campbell’.\n\nThe couple settled at Rosneath House in Dumbartonshire, where Louise was able to continue her charitable work and a few months after her wedding became the president of the Ladies Work Society. In a letter to John before the wedding, Victoria wrote that Louise was “barren”, unfortunately the Queen was right and the couple never had any children.\n\nUpon their return to Britain, Queen Victoria allocated the couple permanent apartments at Kensington Palace, with the hope of keeping the two together but it was too late. Louise resumed public duties in Britain, and Lorne continued his political career. Despite the Victorias attempts to keep them under one roof, they often lived separately, possibly as a result of Johns homosexuality.\n\nIn 1878, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli nominated John to be Canada’s Governor General. On 15th November 1878, the couple left Liverpooland arrived in Canada for the inauguration at Halifax on 25th November. Louise became the first royal to take up residence in Rideau Hall, the Queen’s official royal residence in Ottawa. As viceregal consort, she used her position to support the arts and higher education and the cause of female equality. Louise developed an interest in sleighing and skating. However on 14th February 1880, the royal couple were part of a bad sleighing accident and both parties were lucky to escape with minor injuries. One doctor said “it was a wonder her skull was not fractured”. The severity of the accident was played down in both Canadian and British newspapers as the couple didn’t want to worry the Queen.\n\nAlthough there is no hardcore evidence, it is believed that Louise had a long term affair with famous sculptor, Joseph Edgar Boehm, who had died at Louise’s art studio while being intimate with the Princess. Louise also had rumoured affairs with: Arthur Bigge, later Lord Stamfordham (the queen’s private secretary); fellow artist, Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. In the 1880s, Louise also became close to her brother-in-law, Prince Henry of Battenberg. She had always had a difficult relationship with Beatrice and Helena, which was made to her sisters Helena and Beatrice and worse by her jealousy over of their happy marriages.\n\nUnlike many members of the royal family, Louise was determined to be seen as an ordinary person. When travelling abroad, she often used the alias “Mrs Campbell” so that she could blend in. She was also known for her charity towards servants. On one occasion, the butler approached her and requested permission to dismiss the second footman, who was late getting out of bed. When she advised that the footman be given an alarm clock, the butler informed her that he already had one. She then went so far as to suggest a bed that would throw him out at a specified time, but she was told this was not feasible. Finally, she suggested that he might be ill, and when checked, he was found to have tuberculosis.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Victoria, Louise became part of her brother, the new King Edward VII’s, court. She gained an interest in physical fitness and when criticised responded by saying: “Never mind, I’ll outlive you all.”\n\nSpending most of her time at Kent House on the Isle of Wight, which had given to her in her mothers will, Louise frequently visited Scotland with her husband, who was by this time the Duke of Argyll. She remained a keen artist, creating famous sculptures, including the one of Queen Victoria outside Kensington Palace.\n\nFrom 1911, Louise dedicated much of her time to looking after her husband as his health declined and the two became closer than ever. In spring 1914 Louise stayed at Kensington Palace while her husband remained on the Isle of Wight. He developed bronchial problems followed by double pneumonia. Louise was summoned on 28th April 1914, and he later died on 2nd May. Following his death, Louise had a nervous breakdown and suffered from intense loneliness, writing to a friend shortly afterwards: “My loneliness without the Duke is quite terrible. I wonder what he does now!”\n\nLouise spent her last years at Kensington Palace, occupying rooms next to her sister Princess Beatrice. She made occasional public appearances with the royal family although this was rare. Her health soon began to deteriorate and her public became little to none. In 1935, she greeted her nephew, King George V, and his wife, Queen Mary, at Kensington Town Hall during their Silver Jubilee celebrations; but last public appearance occurred in 1937, at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition.\n\nBy the time King George VI ascended the throne, Louise had become too ill to move around, and was confined to Kensington Palace, affectionately called the “Auntie Palace” by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She developed neuritis in her arm, inflammation of the nerves between the ribs, fainting fits, and sciatica. The Princess occupied herself by drafting prayers and continued with her art.\n\nPrincess Louise died at Kensington Palace on the morning of 3rd December 1939 at the age of 91, wearing the wedding veil she had worn almost seventy years earlier. Following a simple funeral, she was cremated on 8th December 1939. Her ashes were placed in the Royal Vault at St. George’s Chapel on 12th December 1939 and later moved to the Royal Burial Ground, at Frogmore, Windsor, on 13th March 1940.\n\n©️Queen.Victoria.Roses 2024\n\nI hope you have enjoyed today’s blog.
