        "text": "Princess Louise\n\nThe Wikipedia writeup follows...\n\n\"The Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, (Louise Caroline Alberta; 18 March 1848 – 3 December 1939) was a member of the British Royal Family, the sixth child and fourth daughter of Queen Victoria. She served as Canadian Viceregal Consort, when her husband, then the Marquess of Lorne, was the Governor General of Canada. During her time in Canada, unlike her popular husband, she evinced considerable boredom with life in the colonies.\n\nPrincess Louise was born on 18 March 1848 at Buckingham Palace, London. Her mother was the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, a grandchild of King George III through his fourth son, Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent. Her father was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. As a daughter of the sovereign, Princess Louise was styled Her Royal Highness from birth. She was christened in the Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace by John Bird Sumner, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 13 May 1848. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (for whom Prince Albert stood proxy), The Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom Queen Adelaide stood proxy), and The Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (for whom The Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy).\n\nLouise was educated by a governess at Windsor Castle and later attended the Kensington National Art Training School when she was 20.\n\nHer mother, the Queen, wished for her daughter to marry and a hunt began for a suitable husband. The Princess of Wales (later Queen Alexandra) proposed her own brother, Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark as a possible candidate, but the Queen firmly opposed another Danish marriage that could annoy Prussia (see Second War of Schleswig for details of the conflict between the two countries). Louise's eldest sister the Crown Princess of Prussia, proposed her own candidate, the tall and rich Prince Albrecht of Prussia, her husband's cousin. However, he was reluctant to settle in England as requested. Victoria then proposed the idea that Louise marry a member of the British nobility. The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), disapproved of this idea (in most of Europe it would have been out of the question at that time for a sovereign's daughter to marry a non-mediatized noble).\n\nEventually a suitable candidate was chosen, the Marquess of Lorne, heir to the title of Duke of Argyll. The Marquess's parents were known to the Queen, and they approved of the proposed union. The Marquess was also a Member of Parliament at this time. Princess Louise married the Marquess of Lorne on 21 March 1871 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nIn 1878, the Marquess was offered the position of Governor General of Canada. On 14 November 1878, Lord Lorne and Princess Louise departed from Liverpool Harbour on the long journey to Canada. Princess Louise extensively toured the country, as well as visiting the neighbouring United States.\n\nPrincess Louise was the most attractive of her sisters. Her artistic talents were also more than polite accomplishments. Her ability in the arts, for what it may have been worth, matched or exceeded those of many subsequent members of the Royal Family. She was an accomplished writer, sculptor and artist. She painted in both oils and watercolors. A door she painted with sprigs of apple blossoms can still be seen in the Monck wing corridor at Rideau Hall. The enduringly popular Marquess of Lorne gave the name Regina (Latin for Queen) to the capital of the North-West Territories (after 1905 of the province of Saskatchewan), and both the district of Alberta in the Northwest Territories (later the province of Alberta) and Lake Louise in that district in her honor. Although she was often unwell, she was reputed to be a compassionate woman who, during an epidemic of scarlet fever, reportedly personally nursed the sick.\n\nOn 14 February 1880, she was seriously injured when the viceregal sleigh overturned on the streets of Ottawa, Ontario, an incident which provoked the anger of her mother, the Queen. Louise, though she made a full recovery, \"was not the most popular chatelaine that Rideau Hall had known; her boredom with the capital was the subject of public comment\" and she returned to England, leaving Lord Lorne to discharge their Vice-Regal duties alone for another two years. What was perhaps not widely known at the time, however, was there had been warnings of attempts on her life by Fenians and it may not have been entirely invidious at the time for her to retreat from Canada to England. Lord Lorne of course remained and attended to his duty to the end of the Lornes' five-year term.\n\nPrincess Louise visited the Toronto General Hospital on three documented occasions: 10th September 1879 and 13th September 1883, accompanied by Lord Lorne, and 29th May 1880 accompanied by H.R.H. Prince Leopold. On each of these occasions she simply signed the hospital's Visitor Register as \"Louise\". These visits, along with her caring for members of the Rideau Hall household who had contracted Scarlet fever, when the maids refused, illustrated the Princess's concern for health and medicine.\n\nOn 24 April 1900, the 8th Duke of Argyll died, and the Marquess of Lorne became the 9th Duke of Argyll, and Louise, the Duchess of Argyll.\n\nThe Duke died in 1914 from pneumonia. Princess Louise, now a widow, spent World War I visiting Canadian Army units coming to fight in France. She survived until the beginning of World War II, dying on 3 December 1939 at Kensington Palace, when she was ninety-one years old. At her own request, her body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in North London and her ashes were buried at Royal Cemetery at Frogmore, where her parents are also buried.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Argyll did not have any children. According to one scholar, the Princess was sterile as the result of a teenage bout with meningitis. In various biographies, however, there has been much discussion over the Duke's sexuality. It is certain that he preferred the company of men to that of his wife and that he and Princess Louise were often separated for long periods of time ostensibly for reasons of temperament.\"\n\nPrincess Louise, Duchess of Argyll - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe Mystery of Princess Louise, Queen Victoria's daughter, secret love and Royal sex scandal | Mail Online\n\nQueen Victoria's ravishing daughter, a secret love and a sex scandal the Royal Family's STILL trying to cover up\n\n​\n\nMysteries about Princess Louise revealed in new biography\n\n♦ She allegedly gave birth before she was married and hid her pregnancy\n\n♦ Comes nine years after Nick Locock claimed he was her great-grandson\n\n♦ Court rejected plans to exhume body of Henry Lock to prove his royal ties\n\n​\n\nEvery few years, some (usually) deluded soul tries to persuade the newspapers or the courts that he’s a direct descendant of some dead member of the Royal Family or other — invariably from the wrong side of the blanket. Little wonder, then, that no one paid much attention when Nick Locock took to the law in 2004. Once and for all, he said, he wanted to prove that he was the great-grandson of Princess Louise, the most beautiful — and least conventional — of Queen Victoria’s five daughters. His claim seemed unlikely, to say the least. If the as yet unmarried princess had indeed given birth secretly to his grandfather, Henry, he was asking us to believe that Queen Victoria — the moral guardian of her era — had colluded to wipe the record clean.\n\nBut Locock, a retired racing commentator from Hampshire, was so convinced that he wanted the court’s permission to retrieve a sample of Henry’s DNA. This would have involved drilling a hole in his grandfather’s coffin at the Locock family vault in Sevenoaks, Kent, and removing a sample of bone. After that, Nick maintained, Henry’s DNA could conceivably be compared with an existing DNA sample from one of Queen Victoria’s granddaughters. The courts, however, turned down his application, citing ‘the sanctity of Christian burial’.\n\nAnd there it all rested, until author Lucinda Hawksley began working on a biography of the lovely Louise — a woman so far ahead of her time that she became a respected sculptor and campaigner for women’s rights. Like all researchers into the Royal Family, Hawksley applied to visit the royal archives at Windsor. To her surprise, she was told that Princess Louise’s files were ‘closed’ to the public. Next, she tried several times to get access to the archives of Louise’s husband’s family — the Argylls — at Inveraray, Scotland, but again she was firmly rebuffed. Stranger still, she ran against the same brick wall when she asked to see papers connected to people Louise had known — from fellow artists to servants and friends. And Hawksley wasn’t the only one who wondered what was going on. The archivists she approached at the National Gallery, the Royal Academy and the Victoria & Albert Museum, as well as at various overseas collections in Malta, Bermuda and Canada, were frankly bemused to discover that all the papers she’d requested had been ‘removed’ to Windsor.\n\nBy then, Hawksley was all the more determined to get to the bottom of this most tantalising of royal mysteries. Why, she wanted to know, had the detailed records of the most popular of Victoria’s daughters been locked away in the archives? What was it about her that was deemed too scandalous or dangerous to be revealed? And, at 18, when she flowered into the type of curvaceous, regular-featured, blue-eyed beauty most admired by Victorian men, she was indeed noticed. But was she also seduced?\n\nLieutenant Walter George Stirling, of the Horse Artillery, had been hired in March 1866 as the latest tutor for her delicate younger brother, Leopold, who was a haemophiliac. An important addition to the Royal Household, Stirling also joined various family outings, parties and dinners. Leopold blossomed under his care, and there was certainly no sign that Victoria was anything but pleased with the handsome young officer. Louise, meanwhile, was spending a great deal of time with both her brother and his tutor. So it came as a shock when Stirling was abruptly dismissed from his post just four months later.\n\n→ continue reading via the link.\n\n↓ Princess Louise (1848-1939)\n\nAttachments\n\nPrincess Louise, Duchess of Argyll (1848-1939).jpg"
