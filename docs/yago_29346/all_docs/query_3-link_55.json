Her father assumed the title of Grand Duke of Mecklenburg on 18 June 1815. Duchess Frederica was the niece of her future mother-in-law, Queen Charlotte (formerly Duchess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz).\n\nFirst marriage\n\nDuchess Frederica married firstly His Royal Highness Prince Louis Charles of Prussia (called Prince Ludwig, 5 November 1773-23 December 1796), the younger son of Frederick William II of Prussia, on 26 December 1793, at the Royal Palace, Berlin. This marriage was dissolved in 1796\n\nSecond marriage\n\nShe then married His Serene Highness Frederick William, Prince of Solms-Braunfels (22 October 1770-13 April 1814) on 10 December 1798 at Berlin.\n\nThird marriage\n\nFourteen months after her second husband's death, she was married for a third time on 29 May 1815 at the parish church of Neustrelitz, Germany, and again on 29 August 1815 at Carlton House, London to His Royal Highness The Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland.\n\nThe marriage was bitterly opposed by Queen Charlotte, who would refuse to receive her daughter in law/niece, and who died unreconciled to her in 1818.\n\nQueen of Hanover\n\nThe Duchess of Cumberland became Queen of Hanover upon the ascension of her third husband to the Hanoverian throne on 20 June 1837.

(Ernest Augustus I Hanover was born on 5 Jun 1771 in Buckingham House, London, England, died on 18 Nov 1851 in Hanover, Niedersachsen, Germany and was buried in Herrenhausen Gardens, Hanover, Niedersachesen, Germany.)\n\nFrederica next married Prince Friedrich Ludwig Karl on 26 Dec 1793 in Berlin, Brandenburg, Prussia. (Prince Friedrich Ludwig Karl was born on 5 Nov 1773 in Potsdam, Brandenburg, Prussia and died on 28 Dec 1796 in Berlin, Brandenburg, Prussia.)\n\nFrederica next married Frederick William, Prince of Solms-Braunfels on 10 Oct 1798 in Berlin, Brandenburg, Prussia. (Frederick William, Prince of Solms-Braunfels was born on 22 Oct 1770 and died on 13 Apr 1814.)"
