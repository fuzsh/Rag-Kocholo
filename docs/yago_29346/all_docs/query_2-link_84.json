Louise visited the French quarters at Tilsit in 1807, hoping to obtain better conditions for Prussia. She didn't succeed, but it was said that this was only because her husband broke in impatiently on her conversation with the emperor before the latter gave in. It is certain that her fearless encounter with the emperor impressed many and added to her popularity.\n\nIn 1809 she returned to Berlin. but she was serioulsly ill in the summer of 1809. In June, 1810 she fell ill again and she died on July 19th 1810 in the arms of her husband, only 34 years old.

Their meeting took place at the house of Justice Commisioner Ernst Ludwig Siehr in Tilsit, where Napoleon lived during the peace negotiations. Luise had expected to meet a monster but she met a highly intelligent man who chatted pleasantly. She asked him for a measured approach to the peace terms and he answered her vaguely. After he asked her how the Prussians could be so careless as to attack him she answered \"The frame of Frederick the Great deceived us about our means\".
