        "text": "She is not very well known, no big movies have been made about her, yet she has been given a sort of sacred status in old Prussia. Why?\n\nIn the history books, she is known as Louise Augusta Wilhelmina Amalia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Through her marriage to King Frederick William III of Prussia, she became Queen of Prussia.\n\nYouth\n\nLouise, born in Hanover on March 10, 1776, was the daughter of Grand Duke Charles II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Frederika Caroline Louise of Hessen-Darmstadt.\n\nIn 1793, Louise and her sister went to court to meet the sons of Frederick William II of Prussia. Crown Prince Frederik Willem was deeply impressed by her beauty and her good character. He therefore asked her to marry her and they married on December 24, 1793. It became a big family celebration because his brother Louis married Louise’s sister Frederika the same day.\n\nFamily\n\nIt was a happy and together they had ten children:\n\nDaughter – 1794 – stillborn\n\nPrince Friedric Wilhelm (1795-1861)\n\nmarried Princess Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria (1801–1873)\n\nPrince Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig (1797-1888)\n\nmarried Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n\nPrincess Friederike LuiseCharlotte Wilhelmine (1798-1860)\n\nmarried Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, had issue including the future Alexander II of Russia\n\nPrincess Friederike – died in childhood\n\nPrince Friedrich Karl Alexander (1801-1883)\n\nmarried Princess Marie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n\nPrincess Friederike Wilhelmine Alexandrine (1803-1892)\n\nmarried Paul Friedrich, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nPrince Friedrich Jules Ferdinand Leopold (1804-1806)\n\nPrincess Luise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie (1808-1870)\n\nmarried Prince Frederick of the Netherlands\n\nPrince Friedrich HeinrichAlbrecht (1809-1872)\n\nmarried Princess Marianne of the Netherlands. Married secondly to Rosalie von Rauch, Countess of Hohenau\n\nNapoleon\n\nAs Queen of Prussia, she received a lot of respect and affection from the other royalties in Europe. She had little interest in politics, but was especially loved by her courageous action against Emperor Napoleon I of France at the negotiations in Tilsit of 1807 where her husband and Tsar Alexander I of Russia were also present.\n\nShe met the French Emperor during a personal interview after the defeat of Prussia in the Battle of Jena. Napoleon Bonaparte reportedly stated later that he had been very impressed with her appearance and that he would have met her conditions if the conversation had taken fifteen more minutes… The meeting was interrupted by her impatient husband.\n\nDying young\n\nLouise died after a sick-bed of a few weeks on July 19, 1810 in the summer residence in the arms of her husband. She was only 34. She was buried in the mausoleum, a design by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, in the park near Charlottenburg Palace on December 23, 1810. She had first been buried in the Dom of Berlin on 30 July 1810.\n\nWant to see more pictures of Queen Louise? Have a look at my Pinterest board:"
