Clauses in Emperor Wilhelm's will stipulated the successor of Prince Louis Ferdinand must marry equal or be born of an equal marriage. This disbarred Friedrich as his marriage was considered unequal. Although Friedrich accepted this at the time of his marriage, both he and his younger brother (who also married unequally) filed a suit in the German Courts claiming discrimination against them on the basis of their marriage was unconstitutional. They eventually lost the case when in 1998 the Federal Court of Justice overturned the rulings of two lower courts. The two brothers took their case to the Federal Constitutional Court, and on 22 March 2004 obtained a ruling overturning the decisions of the Federal Court of Justice in 1998.

The report is on page 3 of the Newspaper. 11.9 Prince Albrecht of Prussia 1809 1872 Rosalie von Rauch 1820 1879 Rosalie was created Countess von Hohenau on 28 May 1853.\n\nAn interesting Web Page regarding Prince Albrecht and Rosalie von Rauch 11.91 Princess Charlotte of Prussia 1831 1855 Duke Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen 1826 1914 See 29.31 - A brief report on the wedding of George and Charlotte.\n\nCharlotte died either during childbirth or a day after giving birth to her son who himself only lived for one day.\n\nCharlotte's mother, born Princess Marianne of the Netherlands bought the Villa Sommariva (on Lake Como) in 1843 and gave it as a wedding present in 1850 to Princess Charlotte on her marriage to Duke Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen. The Villa Sommariva was renamed Villa Carlotta in memory of Charlotte. 11.92 Prince Albrecht of Prussia 1837 1906 Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg 1854 1898 See 30.911 - Albrecht was Prince Regent of Brunswick 1885 to 1906, and was succeeded as Prince Regent by Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg-Schwerin 11.921 Prince Friedrich Heinrich of Prussia 1874 1940 Prince Friedrich Heinrich in 1907 was reported to be in disgrace due to being addicted to certain practices of a perverse character (don't ask me what pratices).\n\nIt was further reported in 1910 that Friedrich Heinrich had become a monk. 11.922 Prince Joachim Albrecht of Prussia 1876 1939 Marie Blich-Sulzer 1872 1919 The intended marriage of Joachim Albrecht to Marie Blich-Sulzer made headlines in 1906.\n\nAs a result of the intended marriage, Joachim Albrecht was ordered by his second cousin the Kaiser to join a field force in German South-West Africa. Also Joachim's father Prince Albrecht of Prussia had changed his will so that Joachim only inherited £750,000 instead of £1,500,000 on the death of Albrecht in 1906.\n\nIt was reported in 1908 that Joachim Albrecht continued his liaison with Marie in defiance of the Kaiser (Wilhelm II of Prussia) and as a consequence he was dismissed from the army.\n\nIf this wasn't enough scandal, Marie Blich-Sulzer went through a sham (but legal) marriage on 9 May 1906 with Baron Victor Julius von Liebenberg in a Lambeth (London) registry office. Baron von Liebenberg was to be paid for the marriage with a planned divorce to follow afterwards, apparently Marie left her new husband as soon as she came out of the registry office. This sham marriage was to enable Marie to be ennobled hoping this would pave the way for her to marry Prince Joachim.\n\nMarriage registration of Marie Sulzer and Baron Victor Julius von Liebenberg.\n\nJoachim Albrecht and Marie were finally married on 3 September 1919 (according to AN ONLINE GOTHA) but Marie died shortly afterwards on 9 November 1919.\n\nIt was reported that Prince Joachim Albrecht had died mysteriously at his home the day after secret police had visited it. 11.922 Prince Joachim Albrecht of Prussia 1876 1939 Karoline Kornelia Stockhammer 1891 1952 11.923 Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia 1880 1925 Princess Agathe von Ratibor und Corvey, Princess zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst 1888 1960 See 32.8323 11.9231 Princess Marie Therese of Prussia 1911 2005 Rudolf Hug 1885 1972 11.9232 Princess Luise Henriette of Prussia 1912 1973 Wilhelm Schmalz 1901 1983 11.9233 Princess Marianne Cecilie of Prussia 1913 1983 Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld 1905 1942 Wilhelm was killed in action Gor, Russia 11.9234 Princess Elisabeth Auguste of Prussia 1919 1961 Heinz Mees 1918 1994 11.93 Princess Elisabeth of Prussia 1840 1840 11.94 Princess Alexandrine \"Addy\" of Prussia 1842 1906 Duke Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Schwerin 1827 1879 See 23.113 11.95 Count Wilhelm von Hohenau 1854 1930 Baroness Laura Saurma von der Jeltsch 1857 1884 11.95 Count Wilhelm von Hohenau 1854 1930 Princess Margarethe zu Hohenlohe-Oehringen 1865 1940 See 22.323J 11.951 Countess Maria Elisabeth von Hohenau 1879 1956 Count Eberhard von Matuschka 1870 1920 11.952 Countess Marie Rosalie von Hohenau 1880 1966 11.953 Countess Maria Viktoria von Hohenau 1889 1934 Baron Hans Karl von Dörnberg 1875 1924 Baron Hans Karl von Dörnberg was secondly married to Princess Imma of Erbach-Schönberg 11.954 Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Hohenau 1890 1918 Friedrich was killed in action in Darewet, Russia"
