        "text": "Queen Victoria in an engraving, ca. 1838 (Grand Ladies Site)\n\nLondon, Sunday, November 24 — Since the year 1761, when, on the 8th of July, King George III announced at a meeting of his Privy Council his intended marriage with the Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz [1], no meeting of that distinguished and important body has excited so much of public interest as that which was held yesterday at Buckingham Palace, and at which Her Majesty [2] signified her intention to contract a marriage with His Royal Highness Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. For some days, rumours as to the object of the meeting of the Privy Council had been publicly circulated [3], and, in consequence, before twelve o’clock, numbers of well-dressed persons, among whom were a large number of females, began congregating themselves in St. James’s Park, in the vicinity of the palace.\n\nAbout half-past twelve o’clock, a guard of honour, accompanied by a band of the Coldstream Guards, entered the gates of the palace and took up a position on the lawn in front of the grand entrance. A body of police of the A division, under the direction of Inspector Russell, about the same time took charge of the gates and kept a clear passage for the carriages as they arrived. By that time the assemblage had increased to several hundreds, among whom the surmises and anticipations as to the interesting object of the meeting were most gratifying and amusing to those who heard them.\n\nA colorful version of the famous image of Queen Victoria wearing Queen Adelaide’s Fringe Tiara at the Drury Lane Theater, 1838 (Grand Ladies Site)\n\nAt one o’clock the Yeoman, Exons, and Gentleman Porters took their respective stations in front of and under the Grand Portico, and shortly afterwards the members of the Privy Council began to arrive. The first in attendance was the Earl of Albemarle (the Master of the Horse) [4], who was closely followed by Lord Burghersh [5], His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge [6], the Duke of Devonshire [7], Sir George Cockburn [8], Viscount Melbourne [9], the Archbishop of Canterbury [10], Sir George Grey, Bt. [11], Lord Brougham [12], the Lord Chancellor [13], the Duke of Norfolk [14], the Lord President of the Council [15], Lord Monteagle [16], the Duke of Wellington [17], the Speaker of the House of Commons [18], Lord Langdale [19], the Marquess of Salisbury [20], Lord Minto [21], Dr. Lushington [22], Sir Edward Knatchbull, Bt. [23], Lord Hill [24], the Bishop of London [25], the Marquess of Normanby [26], the Earl of Jersey [27], the Hon. T.P. Courtenay [28], Lord Holland [29], Lord Lyndhurst [30], Mr. Macauley [31], the Hon. Henry Pierrepont [32], Sir John Cam Hobhouse, Bt. [33], the Duke of Montrose [34], the Marquess of Anglesey [35], Sir William Alexander [36], the Earl of Surrey [37], the Earl of Erroll [38], Mr. Planta [39], Lord Durham [40], Lord John Russell [41], the Chancellor of the Exchequer [42], Viscount Beresford [43], Lord Ellenborough [44], Sir Edward Hyde East, Bt. [45], the Earl of Ripon [46], Sir Brook Taylor [47], the Earl Howe [48], Viscount Castlereagh [49], Lord Bexley [50], Lord Wharncliffe [51], Sir Robert Adair [52], Lord Abinger [53], Mr. William Ellice [54], Mr. William Peel [55], Sir Robert Peel, Bt. [56], Mr. Justice Bosanquet [57], Lord Cowley [58], Lord Hatherton [59], Mr. Henry Goulburn [60], Sir Henry Hardinge [61], the Earl of Tankerville [62], Lord Chief Justice Tindal [63], the Hon. Thomas Erskine [64], Sir Gore Ouseley, Bt. [65], Lord Ashburton [66], Lord Wynford [67], Lord Amherst [68], Lord Denman [69], etc., etc., to between 80 and 90 of the members of the Council, the last of whom (Lord Denman) entered as nearly as possible as the clock struck two.\n\nAlfred Edward Chalon’s 1838 portrait of Victoria (Grand Ladies Site)\n\nBy that time the concourse of persons drawn to the scene by the fineness of the day and the novelty of the occasion had amounted to upwards of 2000, who lined the drive both from Constitution Hill and the stable yard. The reception experienced by the members of Her Majesty’s Government from the assembled multitude was most flattering to their feelings, although a few hisses were heard in the distance, the utterers of which appeared to be persons of the lowest grades. Lord Melbourne, who was nearly the last that quitted the palace, was loudly cheered by the majority of those present. Mr. Goulburn, Mr. Wilson Croker [70], and others of that party, were allowed to pass almost unnoticed. The “Hero of Waterloo,” who, though apparently in good spirits, yet looked very pale and wan from his recent illness, was most enthusiastically cheered both on his entering and leaving the palace, and Sir Robert Peel also came in for a share of the good feeling of a small portion of the assemblage, as did also His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge.\n\nAbout twenty minutes to three o’clock, the whole council broke up, and within a very short time afterwards the whole of the members had quitted the palace, Lord Melbourne being nearly the last. The crowd then began gradually to disperse; but just as the clock had struck three, Her Majesty’s carriage, drawn by four of the Queen’s horses, and followed by two other of Her Majesty’s carriages, drawn by four post horses, entered the quadrangle, and drew up at the grand entrance, while at the same time an escort of the 14th Royal Hussars took up a position on either side of the outside of the Marble Arch entrance to the palace [71], from which it became evident to the assemblage that Her Majesty intended taking her departure for Windsor. A large portion of the crowd accordingly remained to witness the departure of Her Majesty, who quitted the palace at precisely twenty-five minutes past three o’clock. Her Majesty, we rejoice to state, appeared in remarkably good health and spirits, and returned the spontaneous congratulations of the assemblage with her accustomed condescension. During her progress up Constitution Hill, Hyde Park, Kensington, Hammersmith, etc., the Queen was loudly cheered by the persons who lined the sides of the road.\n\nA later illustration of a young Queen Victoria (Grand Ladies Site)\n\nWe observed among the crowd a certain noble marquess who has lately parted from the Whigs, and a baronet of some celebrity in East Indian affairs, who were signaling the populace as to what parties they should cheer or groan. These two gentlemen appeared to enjoy the fun amazingly, and remained on the ground till the last carriage had left the palace.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. King George III of Great Britain and Ireland (1738-1820) was in love with Lady Sarah Lennox, sister of the Duke of Richmond, but following his sudden succession to the throne at the age of 22, he contracted a marriage with Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1744-1818) instead. After he announced his intention to marry at the privy council meeting, a contingent from England traveled to Germany to fetch their queen-to-be. George and Charlotte met on their wedding day, September 8, 1761. They were married until her death in 1818 and had 15 children together.\n\n2. Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (1819-1901), who was twenty years old at the time. She had already been on the British throne for two years. Her popularity had recently taken a serious hit, following the scandal surrounding the death of Lady Flora Hastings.\n\n3. Rumors were circulating for a good reason: Victoria had proposed to her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1819-1861) more than a month before, on October 15, 1839, at Windsor Castle. This newspaper report gets his title and style slightly wrong; Albert was a serene highness until a few days before his wedding, when he was made a British subject and elevated to the position of royal highness.\n\n4. William Keppel, 4th Earl of Albemarle (1772-1849) was a Whig politician who served as Master of the Horse to both King William IV and Queen Victoria. He traveled with Queen Victoria in the gold state coach on the way to Westminster Abbey for her coronation in 1838. He is an ancestor of both the Duchess of Cornwall and Sarah, Duchess of York.\n\n5. John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland (1784-1859) was styled as Lord Burghersh until he succeeded his father as Earl of Westmorland in 1841. He was a decorated military officer, politician, and composer. His sister was Sarah Villiers, Countess of Jersey, a famous social hostess (and daughter-in-law, of the infamous mistress of King George IV).\n\n6. Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge (1774-1850) was the tenth child of King George III and Queen Charlotte, which means that he was also Queen Victoria’s uncle. Through his younger daughter, Princess Mary Adelaide, he was the grandfather of Queen Mary.\n\n7. William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire (1790-1858), known as the “Bachelor Duke,” served two terms as Lord Chamberlain of the Household in the 1820s and early 1830s. He commissioned the unusual Devonshire Parure (which you can read more about in my recent article!).\n\n8. Sir George Cockburn, 10th Bt. (1772-1853) was a decorated naval officer who was eventually named Admiral of the Fleet. He is probably best remembered as one of the military commanders who captured Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812 and directed the burning of numerous buildings, including the White House.\n\n9. William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne (1779-1848) was Prime Minister at the time of this privy council meeting. He was perhaps the most important adviser and confidant of Queen Victoria until her marriage in 1840. There has been persistent speculation about the nature of their relationship, something played up in the recent ITV series, where he is played by Rufus Sewell.\n\n10. William Howley (1766-1848) served as Archbishop of Canterbury from 1828 until 1848. He was one of the people who informed Queen Victoria that she had succeeded to the throne in the early hours of June 20, 1837. He presided over the coronations of both Victoria and her predecessor, King William IV.\n\n11. Sir George Grey, 2nd Bt. (1799-1882) was a Whig politician who served three times as Home Secretary during Victoria’s reign. He was the nephew of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey who served as Prime Minister from 1830 until 1834.\n\n12. Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux (1778-1868) was a Scottish politician, lawyer, designer, writer, and scientist. He served as Lord Chancellor from 1830 until 1834, but he is perhaps better known for his role in the abolition of slavery in Britain. He also served as a chief adviser to Queen Caroline, the estranged wife of King George IV. The brougham, a carriage that he designed, bears his name. He was also an early investor in the French seaside resort of Cannes.\n\n13. Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham (1781-1851), then Baron Cottenham, was Lord Chancellor in November 1839. He also served a second term in the office during Victoria’s reign.\n\n14. Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk (1765-1842) inherited the Norfolk dukedom from a cousin in 1815. Through his ex-wife, Lady Elizabeth Belasyse (later Lady Lucan), he was connected to Lord Melbourne; she was Melbourne’s first cousin.\n\n15. Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne (1780-1863) was Lord President of the Council in November 1839. The Lord President is the fourth of the Great Officers of State, following the Lord High Stewart (an ad hoc office that is now filled only for a coronation), the Lord Chancellor, and the Lord High Treasurer (which is now filled by a committee, not a single person).\n\n16. Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon (1790-1866) had recently been elevated to the peerage after the end of his tenure as Chancellor of the Exchequer, which ended in August 1839. His second daughter, the Hon. Mary Alicia Pery Spring Rice, was one of Queen Victoria’s maids of honour during this period.\n\n17. Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), hero of the Battle of Waterloo, was one of the most popular and influential British figures of the nineteenth century. Following the end of his military career, he became an important Tory politician, serving as Prime Minister for both King George IV and King William IV. Victoria and Albert later named their third son, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, after Wellington, who served as the prince’s godfather.\n\n18. Charles Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Viscount Eversley (1794-1888) was the new Speaker of the House of Commons, having taken up the position in the spring of 1839. He remained in the role until 1857, when he was made Governor of the Isle of Wight.\n\n19. Henry Bickersteth, 1st Baron Langdale (1783-1851) was Master of the Rolls from 1836 until his death in 1851. His major legacy is an important reform of public record keeping in Britain.\n\n20. James Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury (1791-1868) was a Tory politician who later served as the Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. He was the father of one prime minister (the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury) and the grandfather of another (Arthur Balfour).\n\n21. Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 2nd Earl of Minto (1782-1859) was First Lord of the Admiralty in November 1839. His daughter, Lady Frances, was the second wife of one of Queen Victoria’s later prime ministers, Lord John Russell.\n\n22. Dr. Stephen Lushington (1782-1873) was a Whig politician who championed anti-slavery legislation while serving in parliament. Like Lord Brougham (see note #12) he was one of Queen Caroline’s lawyers. He became judge of the High Court of Admiralty in 1838.\n\n23. Sir Edward Knatchbull, 9th Baronet (1781-1849) was a Whig politician who served as both Paymaster of the Forces and Paymaster General.

In November 1839, he was Home Secretary, following a tenure as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was also a published novelist.\n\n27. George Child Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey (1773-1859) was a Tory politician and royal courtier. He served as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King George IV. He was twice Master of the Horse to Queen Victoria. He also had family links to some of the other members of the Privy Council.

In the battle between King George IV and Queen Caroline, he was firmly in the anti-Caroline camp, a stance that damaged his popularity. His first wife, Lady Caroline Villiers, was the sister of the 5th Earl of Jersey (see note #27). After a scandalous elopement with Lady Charlotte Cadogan, Charlotte’s brother challenged him to a duel on Wimbledon Common; both walked away unscathed.
