        "text": "On 2 January 1861, Frederick William IV of Prussia died and his\n\nbrother William (in German: Wilhelm) ascended the throne as\n\nWilliam I of Prussia.\n\nThis important event marked a total change in his life as he wasn't\n\nexpected to reign over Prussia.\n\nFamily\n\nWilliam Frederick Louis of Prussia (Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig\n\nvon Preussen) was born on 22 March 1797 in the Kronprinzenpalais\n\nin Berlin.\n\nHis parents were Prince Frederick William and Louise of\n\nMecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nHis paternal grandparents were King Frederick William II of Prussia\n\nand Frederica of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nHis maternal grandparents were Charles II Grand Duke of\n\nMecklengburg- Strelitz and Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nWilliam (Wilhelm) was thus a member of the royal house of\n\nHohenzollern.\n\nHe would have several siblings but one sister Charlotte, became\n\nEmpress of Russia.\n\nEarly life\n\nIn 1797, his father Frederick William III became King of Prussia.\n\nWilliam was educated from 1801 till 1809 by Johann Friedrich\n\nGottlieb Delbrück.\n\nMilitary Career\n\nAt the age of 12 his father appointed William as officer in the\n\nPrussian army.\n\nIn 1806 they saw the defeat of Prussia by France and the end of\n\nthe Holy Roman Empire.\n\nWilliam fought against Napoleon Bonaparte of France during the\n\npart of the Napoleonic Wars. He was a very brave soldier. He was\n\nmade captain and won the Iron Cross. He had a long-standing\n\nantipathy towards the French.\n\nIn 1815 he was promoted o major and commanded a battalion of\n\nthe 1st. Garderegiment. He fought under Gebhard Leberecht von\n\nBlücher at the Battles of Ligny and Waterloo. More about von\n\nBlucher on this link.\n\nIn 1817 William accompanied his sister Charlotte to Russia.\n\nShe became Empress Alexandra Feodorovna.\n\nLove and Marriage\n\nIn 1826 William was forced to abandon a relationship with Polish\n\nnoblewoman Elisa Radziwill.\n\nOn 11 June 1829 William married Princess Augusta, the daughter\n\nof Grand Duke Karl Friedrich of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Their\n\nmarriage was stable but not a very happy one.\n\nDuty\n\nIn 1840 his elder brother became King of Prussia. However he\n\nhad no children, so William was given the title Prince von Preussen.\n\nIn 1854 the prince was raised to the rank of field marshal and he\n\nwas made governor of the federal fortress of Mainz.\n\nIn 1857 Frederick William VI had a stroke and he became mentally\n\ndisabled for the rest of his life.\n\nIn January 1858 William became Prince Regent for his brother.\n\nReign\n\nIn July 1861, a student from Leipzig attempted to assassinate William\n\nbut he only was lightly injured.\n\nOn 18 October 1861 his coronation took place at the Schlosskirche of\n\nKönigsberg.\n\nIn 1862 the Landtag refused an increase in the military budget needed\n\nto pay for the already implemented reform of the army. William first\n\nconsidered abdicating, but his son, the Crown Prince advised strongly\n\nagainst it. Then William appointed Otto von Bismarck to the Office of\n\nMinister President in order to force through the proposals.\n\nIn 1864 the Second Schleswig War against Denmark broke out and in\n\n1866 the Austro-Prussian War. William wanted to march on to Vienna\n\nand annex Austria but Bismarck and Crown Prince Frederic advised\n\nhim not to do so.\n\nIn 1867 the North German Confederation was created as a federation\n\nand William wanted to become Kaiser von Deutschland (Emperor of\n\nGermany) as he feared that the North German Confederation would\n\novershadow his own title as King of Prussia.\n\nOn 18 January 1871, the day of the foundation of the Empire, William\n\nbecame German Emperor.\n\nIn 1872 he arbitrated a boundary dispute between Great Britain and\n\nthe United States, deciding in favour of the USA.\n\nOn 11 May 1878, a plumber named Emil Max Hödel failed in an\n\nassassination attempt on William in Berlin.\n\nOn 2 June 1878 another assassination attempt took place by\n\nKarl Nobiling. William was severely wounded but he survived this\n\nattack.\n\nOn 18 September 1883 a new assassination attempt failed. However\n\ndespite these attacks William and his wife were very popular especially\n\nin their later years. They were considered as the personification of the\n\n\"old Prussia\".\n\nDeutsches Eck\n\nWhere the Mosel river joins the Rhine in Koblenz there is an\n\nimpressive Equestrian Statue for Emperor William I of Germany.\n\nSource pictures: Wikipedia\n\nown picture of the Deutsches Eck in Koblenz\n\nWho is who? de Liedekerke family!\n\nOnly a few noble families are intertwined with the history of a country.
