        "text": "I want to say that we can rule out Savoy due to religion. Stolberg-Gedern doesn't seem to have been anything more than a princess and wouldn't be important enough to attract a match with the Prince of Wales. Württemberg is likely already promised to a Russian match.\n\nAugusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt had delicate lungs and might not appreciate British weather. Caroline of Nassau-Usingen is a grand-daughter of George II so I wouldn't be surprised if she were considered. Juliane of Hesse-Philippsthal seems like an interesting woman. Certainly she appears to have been more competent than George IV himself. If you can get Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt from the match with her cousin, the crown prince of Hesse. Then George might very well be pleased with her. I suspect the man needs a beautiful and fairly agreeable wife to be happy domestically. As well as someone to keep him from straying too far with mistresses.\n\nSavoy - not gonna happen due to various acts of Parliament.\n\nStolberg-Gedern, Salm-Kyrburg and Hohenlohe-Langenburg are all too minor principaliies for them get any serious consideration.\n\nAs to the remainder:\n\nJuliane of Hesse-Philippsthal - don't know much about her\n\nLuise of Hesse-Darmstadt: only married her cousin because his first fiancé, Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg ditched him to marry the Russian grand duke. So, if we prevent that, there's no real reason she can't become princess of Wales (that I know of anyway).\n\nKaroline of Nassau-Üsingen: again, besides Nassau-Üsingen (as well as Hesse-Philippsthal) perhaps being too small a player to make an alliance worthwhile, I can't see an impediment. @Titania's Rose she wasn't George II's granddaughter (different branch of the house of Nassau - namely Nassau-Weilburg - descended from him).\n\nAuguste Wilhelmine only married Maximilian I after his older brother's only son died. His marriage to a Saxon princess had never been close, but after their son's death it fell apart completely IIRC. So, prevent little Karl Friedrich August of Zweibrucken from dying and you can maybe see it happening.\n\nFriederike of Württemberg: Not sure how set in stone the marriage between her and the prince of Oldenburg was, so it might still fly. I think I read somewhere that the duchess of Württemberg wanted one of her daughters to become princess of Wales, but her husband/Prussian uncle wasn't in favour of it.\n\nA candidate missing who I think is beautiful, fairly agreeable, and competent, and she was considered OTL, but George III preferred his niece: Luise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (OTL queen of Prussia). If George III had been a little more persuaded, (Queen Charlotte was quite vocal about her niece's candidacy, unlike her other niece that later became duchess of Cumberland, who she despised as having loose morals and a bad match for poor Ernest), and the prince of Prussia (FWIII) had wed elsewhere, his mother wanted him to marry Amalie of Baden (twin sister to Maximilian I of Bavaria's second wife), but he told her that he and Amalie would only ever be friends, we could see George IV marrying Napoleon's beautiful enemy.\n\nAnother one who might work is Amalie of Baden. OTL, she was considered for Clarence and then Kent, but negotiations were stopped when the duke of Teschen displayed some interest in wedding her. Unfortunately, the Empress died around the same time, and Franz II considered marrying her, and by the time Franz had made up his mind, Teschen had lost interest. Franz then tried to foist her on Kent again, but the English duke refused to take the emperor's \"cast-offs\" (as he termed it). And so, she never married.\n\nSorry to bump this but this topic has been on my head recently and I though bumping a recent thread would be easier than making a new one. What do you all think about Princess Luisa Wilhelmina of Orange-Nassau (28 November 1770)? As the daughter of the Stadtholder of the Netherlands she seems to be one of the highest ranking potentials I can find. Britain and the Netherlands were traditional allies and the two were cousins, both descending from George II, so on paper the marriage seemed perfect. OTL Luisa married Karl Georg August, Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, a match arranged as a way for the Oranges to show their appreciation for the Prince's father Karl Wilhelm's divisive role in the Prussian intervention in 1787 that restored the Stadtholder to power. Considering that the Prince was physically and mentally disabled the marriage was quite a waste. So lets say the Oranges make a different marriage with the Brunswicks (the Hereditary Prince of Orange and perhaps Caroline of Brunswick?) or don't feel the need to make a match, leaving Luisa single. Could she become Princess of Wales in this scenario and would this be a better and more fruitful relationship than that of George IV's OTL marriage?\n\nSorry to bump this but this topic has been on my head recently and I though bumping a recent thread would be easier than making a new one.

It might take some doing to get Parliament/the royal family to stomach a Dutch match (although George III's daughter Mary was considered for either Willem VI or his brother, Prince Frederik). It sounds like a decent match - but I'm not sure how plausible it would be\n\nAs far as the state of the marriage goes, everything depends on when it happens. If somebody can (a) get to the prince in mid-1783 before he meets Maria Fitzherbert and (b) arrange it so he thinks the marriage is his idea, it will be rock-solid. He won't be faithful to her, but he won't be antagonistic either and will probably manage to have more than one child with her.\n\nIf it happens a few years later and they yank him directly out of a relationship or unrecognized marriage with a woman he loves and force him into a marriage with a stranger (the first time Parliament relieved his debts in 1787 might be an occasion for this) things might actually be worse than they were with Caroline, if that's at all possible. The one positive is you wouldn't have a royal mistress giving \"advice\" to the royal bride."
