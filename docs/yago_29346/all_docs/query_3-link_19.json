        "text": "If Alexander have Poland before ATL 1812? Obviously.\n\nBut ATL 1812 would not look exactly the same. Alexander may be forced to accept battle close to the border.\n\nInteresting idea. Actually, two interesting ideas. üòú Now, can you explain (I‚Äôm really curious):\n\nFirst, how that transfer of Poland prior to 1812 happens? IIRC, the Poles more or less liberated themselves from Prussia during the Uprising of 1806 and their troops participated on the French side against the Russians in campaign of 1807. Probably it would be slightly too much even for Nappy to throw them under the bus at Tilsit. I do not think that a different marriage of Alexander would fundamentally change his position toward Napoleon and Prussia was his ‚Äúnatural‚Äù ally. Neither I‚Äôm sure that Louise was a decisive factor in Prussian anti-Napoleonic position that resulted in the war of the fourth coalition (without which it is even less clear how the transfer would happen).\n\nSecond, why do you think that in 1812 the Russian strategy would be ultimately defined by a geography instead of the numbers? They did not stop to defend Lithuania, Belorussia and even Smolensk. What can be seriously different with the early Russian Poland is a list of the issues which led to the confrontation. Militarization of the Duchy was one of two items on which Nappy refused to negotiate (second was increased French military presence in East Prussia). So in an absence of that factor we may have (IMO) two basic scenarios:\n\n1. Nappy and Alexander agree upon the Tariff and Oldenburg issues. French increased military presence in Prussia may not be as important as in OTL because due to the border configuration it would be much more difficult to launch a big-scale attack on Russia. Of course, Alexander may be emboldened enough to start offensive into Prussia. More than one scenario is possible from this point.\n\n2. Nappy uses Prussian territory as a concentration area for the offensive, expecting cooperation from the Russian-held Polish territories. His army is smaller (minus OTL Polish troops) and has a longer distance to march. The first is an advantage the second is not. üòú\n\nDuring Napoleonic Wars Poles fought on Russian side too, and throwing Poles under bus would be nothing new for Nappy (see Haiti). IOTL Poles also felt betrayed in 1807, because Kingdom of Poland was not restored.\n\nAnd for the border battle-Alexander, for political reasons, could not completly abandon his new kingdom and would thus accept battle somewhere in Poland. Still, even if Alex is crushed, Nappy needs to chase him deep into Russia then anyway, with the same logistic problems.\n\nDifferent Poles: those fighting on the Russian side had been Russian subjects and when they served in the army, they did not form national units. Different situation: during the uprising the Prussian Poles formed national units (3 divisions, IIRC) and some kind of a national government. While Nappy was regularly throwing his troops under the bus, Haiti is hardly a good example: most of the expedition died from yellow fever. Here is a completely different situation: the Poles liberated a big chunk of the Polish territory on their own and while their pro-French sympathies had been quite clear I‚Äôm not sure if there were some serious pro-Russian sentiments. Then, on a purely strategic level, Nappy was interested in creation of a vassal state located between Prussia and Russia. Giving this territory to Alexander would be a gift not warranted by any preceding history of their relations or any realistic expectations regarding future friendship and it would also deprive Nappy of a big part of the strategic gain in the war.\n\nThe Poles may felt betrayed but that feeling did not prevent them from raising an army which was probably out of proportion to their economic and demographic abilities and to fight quite enthusiastically in Spain and in 1812.\n\nNow, regarding alt-1812, the numeric disparity of the forces at the start of campaign made a battle on the early stage suicidal. The whole Barclay‚Äôs schema of a deep retreat was based upon an idea of preserving existing Russian army. If it is crushed close to the border, the logistics is indeed there but the Russian army is not. Nappy may not get peace but he can operate in Russia with the impunity. At least the contemporaries (Barclay, Kutuzov and lesser figures) considered preservation of the army a higher priority than defending any geographic point. As for Alexander, his role in 1812 was quite limited: he was asked politely to abandon his initial idea regarding fight at Drissa and then persuaded to leave the army. His requests for a battle were ignored (as soon as we find the good position, we‚Äôll surely fight but so far we could not find any...)."
