        "text": "(This is my first timeline, so please, any criticism is welcome! Sorry for the rough start!)\n\nHRH Princess Charlotte of Wales and her husband, HSH Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, by William Thomas Fry, 1816 or 1817. ​\n\nNovember 5, 1817, 12:03 a.m: After a heated debate with the other doctors and all but barging into the delivery room, Dr. John Sims, with the use of forceps, delivered of Princess Charlotte of Wales ‘a large and handsome boy, said to resemble the royal family’. After a minute described by the midwife as 'painfully long and silent', the child finally began to cry. After a few days of a worrisome fever, Princess Charlotte was reported hale and hearty and recovering well. She and her husband, Leopold, decided the child would be named George after his grandfather and great-grandfather the King [1].\n\nIn Italy, Charlotte’s mother Caroline rejoices at the birth of a grandson -even though it took her a letter from her daughter’s husband to find out [2]-, and is sure that her descendants will sit comfortably on the British throne in the foreseeable future. Upon this realization, she shows more common sense than she’s previously shown and breaks away from her servant and rumored lover, Bartolomeo Pergami [3], writing to him that ‘any scandal brought upon her would sit poorly upon her poor Lotte [Charlotte] and ruin her chances’.\n\nDespite the birth of a son to his highly popular daughter and son-in-law, the Prince Regent [4] isn’t held in too high of a regard in his country. His spending on the Brighton Pavilion, the typhus epidemic in Scotland [5] and his affair with the married Marchioness of Hertford [6] have made him unpopular, and the birth of a grandson has people focusing more on that George’s reign than his, something the pompous Regent is not a fan of. The line of succession seems fairly assured now, but rumors are going out: the Prince Regent, realizing his daughter and grandson could not inherit Hanover [7], had sent out his youngest brother Adolphus [8] to find wives for his brothers, William and Edward Augustus [9], to produce sons and keep the crown within the family [10]. Reasonable, right? However, it’s being reported that the Prince Regent has also given Adolphus another mission: to find a new future Queen for England (aka a new wife for George).\n\nAs the year draws to the close, people are left looking forward to the christening of their new prince, and wondering what exactly his grandfather and namesake is planning to do...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------​\n\n[1] I mean really, what other name was this kid going to have? Don’t worry, his middle names are at least a little interesting.\n\n[2] OTL, Charlotte heard of her daughter’s death in childbirth from a passing courtier as George IV hadn’t bothered to send anyone to tell her about their child’s death, so it’s not too much of a stretch that he wouldn’t tell her about their grandchild being born. He’s sketchy in any timeline.\n\n[3] After she was more or less forced into exile by her husband, Caroline moved to Italy where \"she employed Bartolomeo Pergami as a servant. Pergami soon became Caroline's closest companion, and it was widely assumed that they were lovers\". In 1817, she moved to \"Villa Caprile near Pesaro. Pergami's mother, brother and daughter, but not his wife, joined Caroline's household\"\n\n[4] Future George IV\n\n[5] The exact dates of the epidemic on 1817 are unknown, but it didn’t seem unreasonable for people to still be angry about it if it wasn’t still going on in November of that year.\n\n[6] Isabella Anne Seymour-Conway, Marchioness of Hertford (1759 – 12 April 1834)\n\n[7] Hanover was the Electorate and later kingdom held by the British kings from George I to William IV OTL; due to a male-only succession law, when Victoria succeeded to the throne, it passed to Ernest Augustus, The Duke of Cumberland. TTL, when Charlotte inherits, it will in theory pass to George IV’s next living male relative, his younger brother Frederick, the Duke of York and Albany.\n\n[8] OTL Duke of Cambridge and grandfather to Queen Mary of Teck, wife of George VI.\n\n[9] OTL William IV and The Duke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria, respectively.\n\n[10] Frederick, the Duke of York and Albany, and his wife Princess Friederike of Prussia had been married in 1791, but “after three years, it had become apparent that the Duke and Duchess of York would have no issue” (Mary Beacock Fryer, Arthur Bousfield & Garry Toffoli: Lives of the Princesses of Wales (1984)), so it’s reasonable to assume that William and Edward are gonna need to step up and take one for the weirdly anti-marriage House of Hanover team.\n\nPortrait of HRH William, the Duke of Clarence and St. Andrews, and Princess Adelheid of Saxe-Meiningen by Sir David Wilkie\n\n​\n\nOn February 10, 1818, the young Prince George was baptised by the Most Revered and Right Honorable Archbishop of Canterbury in the drawing room of Claremont House [1] and was given the names ‘George Leopold Frederick Alexander’ for his grandfather and great-grandfather, father, and two godfathers. His godparents were his grandfather the Prince Regent; HM Queen Charlotte [2]; Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia (represented by HRH The Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh); Alexander I of Russia [3] (represented by HRH The Duke of York); Auguste, the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld [4]; and Queen Catherine Pavlovna of Wurttemberg [5] (represented by HRH The Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh). Three days later in the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace, Leopold is officially made His Royal Highness Leopold, The Duke of Kendal [6], in -according to the Letters Patent- ‘honour of the birth of his son with the Princess Charlotte, beloved only daughter of the Prince Regent’. Likewise, his son is now HRH Prince George of Kendal by royal decree, even though it is noted that he is not made a prince of the United Kingdom at the time.\n\nEveryone is pleased to see this continuation of what Queen Charlotte describes in a letter to her daughter Charlotte (Queen Dowager of Wurttemberg) [7] of ‘proper bloodlines’, as all of Europe has been shaken by the death of Charles XIII of Sweden five days before and the succession of his adoptive son Charles XIV, better known as Jean Bernadotte, a French general and former intimate of Napoleon [8].\n\nTwo days after the christening, Richard Rush, the new ambassador from the United States [9], is officially presented to the court, and comes bearing a gift for the Kendals: a set of ‘American’ foxhound puppies, descended from the breeding dogs of George Washington. Charlotte, in a moment of humor, names the dogs ‘Monroe’ and ‘Kortright’ (the surname of the United States president and the maiden name of his wife). The young couple immediately take to Mr. Rush, who declares in a letter to his president that he sees “our relations with our former masters improving greatly under the instillation of such a mistress”. In London, the Royal Coburg Hall [10] is raised in honor of the birth of Prince George in May, and it’s opening performance of ‘The Merry Wives of Windsor’ is attended by Charlotte and Leopold to great acclaim; Leopold later takes full patronage of the theatre and calls it one of his ‘dearest and most close held projects’.\n\nAnnouncing that he has done his duty to his brothers and found them wives, Adolphus, the Duke of Cambridge marries his second cousin Princess Auguste of Hesse-Kassel on May 8th in Kassel, followed by another ceremony on June 1st at Buckingham Palace.\n\nTwo months later, on July 11, the entire royal family, including the Kendals (as Charlotte, Leopold, and baby George are now known) is in attendance at the double wedding of William, the Duke of Clarence and St. Andrews, to Princess Adelheid of Saxe-Meiningen and Edward Augustus, the Duke of Kent and Strathearn, to Princess Viktoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in the drawing room of Kew Palace [11]. Only four years older than her new niece Charlotte, Adelheid makes a great impression on the family with her ‘amiable and easy going charm’; she even makes a scandal by warmly welcoming her husband’s nine illegitimate children into her home, a move that wins her full approval from Charlotte, who loves her Fitzclarence cousins well [12]. There is no need for friend-making between Charlotte and her new aunt Viktoria, however; as the sister of Charlotte’s husband Leopold, Charlotte has been writing to Viktoria for two years now and feels she knows her well. There are rumors that she and Leopold were the ones to set the widowed Viktoria up with Edward (they’re totally true) [13]. Charlotte is devastated when her new aunts leave with their husbands to set up homes in Hanover, where the living is cheaper, but resigns herself to the promise of visits and weekly letters.\n\nOnly a week after the wedding, there is another royal announcement: Her Royal Highness Charlotte, The Duchess of Kendal, is pregnant with her second child.\n\n(It is noted at this time that the Prince still has his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, traveling through Germany with his wife to 'make new alliances', though noticed that he was ordered only to stop and visit with families with unmarried daughters).\n\nIn August, elections for Parliament are held; the Tories continue to hold power, despite losing a few seats, and Lord Liverpool keeps his government intact. The Prince Regent, a devoted Whig and known friend of Charles Fox [14], is devastated; Charlotte, a fellow devoted Whig, is upset to say the least, and Leopold, of a more conservative view [15], is cautiously optimistic. Within weeks of the election, it is noted that the Lord Liverpool has paid a visit to Claremont House and has been invited back for tea by Princess Charlotte. It is also noted that the Prince Regent is not happy about this little tête-à-tête, particularly as it is rumored that Ambassador Rush was also present as this meeting (he wasn’t). A few weeks after the election, the Prince Regent cautiously approaches Liverpool about saving money - by cutting the allowance of the Kendals and his wife Caroline. (Caroline hasn’t been involved in the elections or anything at this point, he just figures he might as well go all in). Jenkinson, noted for his ‘smooth dealings’ with the Prince Regent, keeps his answer short and sweet: we will not cut the allowance of the most popular people in the kingdom while they are expecting their second baby - who, by the way, is your grandchild. The Prince Regent slinks away to be comforted in the arms of the Marchioness of Hertford, and the Kendals continue on with their allowance.\n\nLeopold becomes particularly popular by taking up the patronage of the Royal Humane Society, as well as beginning work to find work and homes for soldiers of the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic wars, and funding care and residences for the soldiers too wounded to work. Likewise, Charlotte takes up charities devoted to war widows and orphans, and creates the Princess Charlotte School, devoted to educating young girls in embroidery and womens’ arts in order to help them find work to support themselves and their families. She later hires the top student of the first graduating class, a Miss Mary Gillray, to serve as governess to her children.\n\nShortly after, it is announced that Auguste, the Duchess of Cambridge, will be hiring a student from Princess Charlotte's school as a governess for her household as well; she is pregnant and everyone is ecstatic.\n\nOn October 20, Richard Rush helps create the Treaty of 1818, which establishes the boundary between the U.S. and British North America from the Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains, creating the Northwest Angle. The treaty marks the United Kingdom's last permanent major loss of territory in the United States and the United States' only permanent significant cession of North American territory to a foreign power; all in all, it’s a win for both parties [16]. Charlotte herself writes to congratulate Rush on his treaty, stating “I should so like with all my heart to know the Americans as friends and allies, as I admire their spirit and industriousness, and pray this treaty will give me an opportunity to do so in the future”. Jenkinson returns for tea at Claremont at least once a month, and privately reports to a friend that he finds Charlotte to be “the best of women” and her husband to be “entirely English in his outlook, and as good a man to be had as one could wish for”. His words about the Prince Regent -who continues to push cutting everyone’s allowances while sinking money into the pit that is Brighton Pavillion- are not fit for repetition.\n\nQueen Charlotte, after a long and lately sad life, dies on November 17 [17] sitting in an armchair of her sitting room at Kew Palace, holding the hands of her son the Prince Regent and her grandson-in-law Prince Leopold (Prince Charlotte, so close to her due date, had been banned from travel). She is buried in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor two weeks later, to the mourning of the country; her husband, deaf, blind, and insane, is not informed of her death. Her jewels were specifically left to Princess Charlotte, though they were claimed by the Prince Regent for ‘safekeeping’ until his daughter was well enough to come and claim them.\n\nIn a sadly ironic twist, the Court Circular announces the pregnancies of HRH The Duchess of Clarence and St. Andrews and the HRH The Duchess of Kent at the same time as it announces the death of their long-serving queen.\n\nOn December 3 at 5:01 in the afternoon, Charlotte officially does her duty to the country -with a lot less drama and danger this time around- and delivers a second son, whom she and Leopold decide to name William for his great-uncle, the Duke of Clarence and St. Andrews. The entire country rejoices: they now have a pretty, happy, charming heiress with a handsome, happy, charming husband and two handsome healthy little princes to secure the succession nicely (the Prince Regent is entirely forgotten in this equation by literally almost everyone, as the whole country is doing their best to forget him at this point). On the same day, Illinois is admitted to the union as the 21st state of the Union; Richard Rush is pleased to report to Charlotte and Leopold that the new capital city of the new state -in a sign of friendship- has been named ‘Williamsfield’ [18] by the populace, in honor of the prince sharing their ‘birthday’.\n\nThe year draws to the close with rumours that the Duke and Duchess of Kendal are building up a party of followers -led by Jenkinson and Rush- swirling through the court. They deny it, of course, but one cannot ignore the fact that many of the government are starting to support Princess Charlotte over her father, some secretly, some not so secretly. Everyone is waiting for Charlotte to come and claim her jewels from her father, who swears that yes, he still has them and they are totally safe, and why are you asking about it. Charlotte and Leopold’s popularity continues to grow, there's a new alliance with the United States, and there are expected to be another three royal babies by spring. It’s an interesting time for Britain.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------​\n\n[1] Claremont was the country home in Surrey bought for Charlotte and Leopold by Parliament upon their marriage in 1816.\n\n[2] Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the wife of George III (who, being insane by this point, obviously isn’t going to be a godparent) and thus great-grandmother to baby George.\n\n[3] A controversial choice for the time, but the Russians helped the British beat Napoleon not too long before, and Leopold made his contribution to the war by serving in the army of his dear buddy, you guessed it, Alexander I. He was also a quasi-relative as his younger brother Grand Duke Konstantin was married to Leopold’s sister Julianne (even though they’d been separated for seventeen years at this point).\n\n[4] Mother of Leopold and the OTL grandmother / matchmaker of Victoria and Albert.\n\n[5] Queen of Wurttemberg, conveniently sister to George’s godfather Alexander I, and the matchmaker of Charlotte and Leopold. Her husband was also a first cousin of Charlotte through their mothers, so she’s another quasi-relative.\n\n[6] The OTL plan was to make Leopold the Duke of Kendal, but Charlotte died before this could happen. After the christening of his son and the future King of Great Britain seemed like a good time to get it done.\n\n[7] Weirdly enough also the stepmother-in-law to Catherine Pavlovna, and godmother to Princess Charlotte (there clearly weren’t a lot of names to pick from in the Hanover family). After her husband’s death, Charlotte continued living in Wurttemberg (who could blame her) until her death in 1828.\n\n[8] This is 100% OTL; Jean was elected to be the successor to the king in 1810 by the Riksdag of the Estates in Örebro. Fun fact, he was married to the first love of Napoleon, Desiree Clary. Pay attention to them, they’re coming back.\n\n[9] One of President James Madison’s best friends, Rush had started out as the Comptroller of the Treasury, before becoming the youngest Attorney General to take office and acting as the Secretary of State while John Quincy Adams was in Europe. During his time as acting Secretary of State, Rush concluded the Rush-Bagot Convention, demilitarizing the Canadian boundary on the Great Lakes. He served as Minister to Britain for eight years OTL and was extremely popular for his “gentlemanly ways”.\n\n[10] The Royal Coburg Hall was the original name of what has become the Old Vic Theatre OTL.\n\n[11] They were set to be married at Windsor, but while traveling from London to Windsor, Queen Charlotte “decided to spend a few days at the Dutch House, but since she was ill with dropsy she was unable to continue her journey and the wedding occurred in the drawing room of the Dutch House”.\n\n[12] OTL Adelheid did completely accept her husband’s nine illegitimate children, born of his longtime liaison with actress Dorothea Jordan (they had ten children but one son died in 1817). Charlotte’s relationship with them is unknown but she was said to have developed an affection for William’s oldest son, George Fitzclarence, before her marriage, so she clearly knew them fairly well and since she was a good person, I’m assuming she loved her cousins.\n\n[13] OTL Leopold set up Viktoria and Edward, so it’s not too much of a stretch that he’d bring his beloved Charlotte into the scheme.\n\n[14] Charles James Fox (January 24, 1749 - September 13, 1806), a Whig politician and his notedly notorious and scandalous private life. An intimate of the Prince Regent and the famous Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, Fox was famed for his ‘rakishness’, drinking, and gambling, and eventually married a former mistress of the Prince Regent.\n\n[15] Leopold was know for being a ‘liberal conservative’, it’s reasonable to believe he would have been more of a fan of Jenkinson than Fox.\n\n[16] This is the OTL Treaty of 1818, which did set the boundaries of British Canada and the northern United States at the 49th parallel north.\n\n[17] At the time of her death, Charlotte was the longest serving British consort in history, with a reign of 57 years and 70 days. She is currently the second longest serving consort in history, after HRH The Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n[18] Obviously this is OTL Springfield, Illinois. It was only seven years old at this point, so I figured it wouldn’t be too much drama to change it; not to mention everyone is trying to play nice now and it’s a smart political move, given Charlotte’s stated affection for the States."
