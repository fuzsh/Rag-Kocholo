        "text": "Queen Charlotte of France, born Princess Charlotte of Prussia (13 July, 1797-9 October, 1871) was Queen of France as Wife of Charles X from her marriage in 1819 to her death in 1871.\n\nPrincess of Prussia[]\n\nQueen Charlotte was born as Princess Friederike Luise Charlotte Wilhelmine of Prussia, at the Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin on 13 July 1798. She was the eldest surviving daughter and fourth child of Frederick William III, King of Prussia, and Duchess Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and a sister of Frederick William IV and of William I, King of Prussia. She was known as Charlotte, a name popular in the Prussian royal family, and nicknamed Lottchen by her family.\n\nThe princess's childhood was marked by the Napoleonic Wars and she was raised under difficult financial conditions. Her father was a kind, religious man but a weak and indecisive ruler who, following military defeats in 1806, lost half of his kingdom. Charlotte's mother, admired for her beauty, intellect, and charm, was considered more decisive than her husband. When the Prussians were defeated at the battle of Jena, Louise fled to Königsberg, taking her children with her, Charlotte then being eight years old. In East Prussia, they were given protection by Tsar Alexander I. \"My daughter Charlotte is reserved and concentrated, but like her father, her seemingly cold appearance conceals the beating of her hot compassionate heart\", wrote Queen Louise about her daughter. On 27 October 1806, Berlin fell under Napoleon’s control and Charlotte grew up in war-torn Memel, Prussia. In December 1809, Queen Louise finally returned to Berlin with her children, but after a few months, became ill and died of typhus at the age of 34, shortly after Charlotte’s twelfth birthday. As the eldest daughter, Charlotte was now the most senior lady at the court and had to undertake her mother’s duties. For the rest of her life, Charlotte treasured her mother’s memory.\n\nMarriage Prospects[]\n\nCharlotte was originally supposed to marry the second in line to the Russian Throne, Grand Duke Nicholas Pavlovich. On a visit to Berlin in 1814, the two fell in love and everyone thought they were bound to marry. The two families had planned to have the two marry each other but from his visit in 1814 to their planned wedding in 1817 the two grew further and further apart. Nicholas soon refused to see Charlotte, describing her as ugly and bold for a women. Charlotte, heartbroken refused to marry Nicholas after that and the marriage prospect never happened\n\nIn March of 1817, Charlotte was sent to Austria in attempts for her to marry the heir to the Austrian Throne, Archduke Franz Karl. She originally liked him but the Archduke had a certain disgust for the woman so the proposal was removed.\n\nA year later, she was sent to Spain and planned to marry the King, Ferdinand VIII. The King was 13 years older than Charlotte but fell in love with her. Charlotte on the other hand left 2 days after meeting the King. She described him Frail, Old, Wrinkle Filled, Creepy, and needy.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nAs tensions between France and Prussia grew, Princess Charlotte was sent to France to mediate the situation. King Frederick offered the hand of his daughter to the French King if it meant that both sides would end each others hostilities and keep peace. King Charles X agreed, only if he met and loved Charlotte. When Charlotte arrived, she fell in love with France and Charles. Charles did not feel the same for the first few days but soon fell more in love with her than the other way around. Charles and Charlotte both agreed and the two were married 2 months later on May 9th, 1819. The marriage ceremony was attended by over 3,000 and both populations thought this was an extremely joyful moment, even with the tense situation in Europe. Despite their marriage being purely for politics, they had a very happy marriage, something quite surprising for the time.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nCharlotte was tall, thin, had a small head, and a pronounced brow. She had an air of regal majesty. Her quick, light walk was graceful. Her voice was hoarse, but she spoke rapidly and with decision.\n\nQueen Charlotte was an avid reader and enjoyed music. Her favorite writer was the Russian Lermontov. She was kind and liked privacy and simplicity. She dressed elegantly, with a decided preference for light colors, and collected beautiful jewels. Alexandra loved dancing and was particularly skillful at the mazurka, enjoying court balls until dawn. Neither arrogant nor frivolous, Charlotte was not without intelligence and had an excellent memory; her reading was quite extensive; her judgment of men sure, slightly ironical. However, she took no active interest in politics and fulfilled the role of being a queen consort, rather than being active in the public sphere. She loved her family very dearly and even developed facial tics, a common trait that ran in the royal German-Russian-British family in many branches.\n\nQueen of France[]\n\nCharlotte became Queen upon her marriage to her Husband in 1819. Charles, already coronated had a second coronation to honor his wife on July 10th, 1820, exactly 4 years after his own. Charlotte enjoyed her Husbands good cause at court, but had no interest in politics beside that in her own home country. She found the French court similar to that of Prussia, but her Husband had more more to bear then her father or brothers.\n\nIn 1822, Prussia and France went to war. Charlotte, afraid went to the families estate at Chambord instead of at the main court in Versailles. Charlotte proved her loyalty to the French People but some, mostly politicians and nobles had a despise for her. Some believed Charlotte as a spy for Prussia, attempting to bring down France. On June 20th 1825, the pregnant Queen was forced into her home as members of the Nobility attempted to storm the palace and kill the queen. Charles raced home and arrived 2 days later to find his queen in ill health, and the nobles at court in cheer. He had the nobles shot, and had Alexandra move to Portugal along with the rest of the Family. After the end of the Rhine war, Charlotte returned to France and Europe was at peace. Charlotte began once again her normal trips to Prussia along with her Husband 7 years later.\n\nBy 1829 Charles and Charlotte had 8 children whom they raised with great care. Through out their 51 year long Charles and Charlotte always remained in fidelity, and were always deeply in love. Charlotte was frail and towards the end of her life became very thin, and looked as if ill even though she reportedly wasn't. Charlotte\n\nWhile on a visit to Portugal, the queen fell ill and was unable to travel back to France. The King visited her 4 different times in a month before leaving back to France for his duties. Just as he left on his 7th trip, the Queen was reported to have peacefully died on the 9th of October in 1871, age seventy-three. Her final words were reported to have been: \"I will wait for you my dear.\"\n\nHer body was then transported back to France and her 6 day funeral began. Charlotte was buried in the garden of the private chapel at Versailles. She would be joined by her husband 24 years later.\n\nChildren[]\n\nWith Charles X, Charlotte had 8 children between 1820-1829."
