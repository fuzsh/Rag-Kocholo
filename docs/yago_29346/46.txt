Louise of Mecklenburg 1776-1810

Louise, or also spelled Luise, was in full Louise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

Louise's Family

Louise was the third daughter of Duke (German: Herzog) Karl Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt.

Louise would become the mother of five princes and three princesses.

Louise's Life

Louise was born on March 10, 1776 at Hanover, Germany, where at the time her father was governor.

Her mother died in 1782.

In 1785, Louise's father relocated his family to Darmstadt, where Louise's grandmother took care of her.

From 1792 to 1793, Louise lived with her oldest sister Charlotte, the Duchess of Hildburghausen.

On July 14, 1792, Louise attended the coronation of Francis II at Frankfurt.

On December 24, 1793, Louise married the crown prince, the later King Frederick William III of Prussia.

In 1797, Frederick became king, and hence, Louise became Queen of Prussia.

Upon outbreak of the War of the Fourth Coalition, Louise accompanied her husband to Naumburg, and, after the Battle of Jena, to Königsberg (Kaliningrad or Królewiec) and Memel (Klaipeda.)

Most famous was her meeting with Napoleon at Tilsit on July 6, 1807, which did not render the results Louise had hoped for. And yes, Louise was a head taller than the French emperor. But then again, who wasn't.

In 1808, Louise left Konigsberg and went to visit the imperial family at Petersburg, Russia, returning on December 23, 1809, to Berlin.

In 1810 she visited her father. While staying at the summer palace of Hohenzieritz, she took ill with a chest fever and died suddenly on July 19, 1910.

On July 27, 1810, Louise's body was brought to Berlin where she rests at the mausoleum of the Charlottenburg Castle. Her husband was buried next to her in 1840.

Louise's Character and Personality

Louise was loved and adored by pretty much everybody, rich and poor, because of her openness, kindness, and her always well-disposed nature. And yes, beauty helped.

Due to the influence of his wife, Frederick is said to have been occasionally able to perform above his otherwise average capacity.
