        "text": "A few days before Christmas in 2020, Vogue published this story, dedicated to one of Slim Aarons’s most beloved photos, “Christmas Swim.” It’s a snap of his wife in 1954, sunning herself in a pool sprouting a Christmas tree, with a view of the Hollywood sign beyond—in other words, a quintessentially Aarons image. At a glance, the shot may seem like just another deliciously frivolous moment Aarons immortalized with a click of his camera. But in reality, the scene was far more precisely orchestrated. Through an interview with Aarons’s daughter, Mary, we paint a picture of how the image came to be.\n\nEach year, come this season, a certain Slim Aarons photo makes the rounds on Instagram. It features a bathing beauty floating in a pool, bobbing alongside metallic holiday ornaments. Behind her, three children play with the floating, shining orbs. And because it’s not Slim Aarons unless there’s an element of lavish frivolity, a Christmas tree emerges from the water, festooned with swags of aluminum-foil-colored tinsel and metallic bows. The tree is inexplicably anchored to the bottom of the pool, and at the highest point of the tree is a Christmas star, glinting in the California sun. Off in the distance is the Hollywood sign. It’s titled “Christmas Swim.”\n\n“The other day I was on Instagram and saw a comment saying, ‘That’s not Katy Perry. That’s Rita Aarons!’” says Mary Aarons, daughter of Rita (the subject of “Christmas Swim”) and Slim. “I shared the mix-up with my mother. She’s 90 years old and she’s with it, but she has zero social media knowledge and understanding. She always asks where am I seeing all this and who are these people who know about it. And I tell her, ‘You are sort of like an Instagram star.’”\n\nInstagram is a funny place, a platform for anonymous individuals to launch themselves into the public eye and for the already famous to maintain their renown. On the gram, you get what you give, and so it’s peculiar for the app to have had such an impact on a nonuser. Slim wasn’t alive to see the invention of Instagram, and he doesn’t have an estate managing an official account, and yet Instagram has played a significant role in his legacy. Through Instagram, Slim’s photos are distributed, circulated, and double-tapped by users all over the world. Your next Slim Aarons photo is likely just a few scrolls away.\n\nBorn as George Allen Aarons in 1916 in New York City (his six-foot-four frame and lanky build earned him the nickname Slim), he started fiddling around with a camera while enlisted in the United States Army. He worked as a photographer at West Point military academy and later as a combat photographer following and documenting the horrors of World War II across Northern Africa and Europe. After the war, Slim vowed to walk on the sunnier side of the street, opting to photograph girls not guns, bikinis instead of bombs. As to what caught his eye and what he would deem worthy subject matter, Slim famously said it best himself: “Attractive people doing attractive things in attractive places.”\n\nOn assignment for Life, Town & Country, or Holiday Magazine—from the 1950s and well into the 1970s—Slim would ping-pong across the globe to cities only fashionable at a certain time of the year: Palm Springs, Verbier, Marbella. Those holiday playgrounds where the old-monied set clinked Champagne glasses with oligarchs of modern industry and pretty young things with Hollywood stars in their eyes. Slim photographed swank après-ski scenes in Squaw Valley and the photogenic patrons at Il Pellicano, but more than that, he was granted rarified access into private spaces of those whose fame was their fortune or for whom entitlement was a birthright—C.Z. Guest, Babe Paley, Princess Caroline of Monaco, Countess Dolores von Furstenberg.\n\nFew details are known about the festive photo, one of Slim’s most iconic, but Mary offers some context: “It was a hired house and hired kids, and my mom’s big recollections were that it was a really cold, really dirty pool and that because they wanted everything to line up just right (and obviously it was her husband taking the picture), he made her stay in there a really long time,” says Mary. “She was freezing and mad. It looks idyllic now, but to get it just right in a cold and dirty pool took a while.”\n\nMary estimates the photo session might have taken an hour or an hour and a half. “He didn’t use lights, and I would guess—I’m not great at perspectives but I’m looking at it now because I put it out every Christmas—he’s standing on the diving board or a ladder at the other end of the pool.”\n\n“I’m not that old,” Mary jokingly asserts when asked about people thinking she was one of the kids in the picture. “I came around a couple of years later.” Who they are remains a mystery, as does the location of the house. Mary, who lovingly keeps up with all the latest discoveries relating to her father, tells me there’s a big debate on the exact address of the house. Though Los Angeles was a city Slim and his wife spent a bit of time in, the house was not one they ever occupied—simply a set that offered a marvelous view of the Hollywood sign. “A lot of people think it’s Baldwin Hills,” says Mary. “Somewhere, somebody does know where that house is. It doesn’t look like the kind of house that would still be there now. It’s probably been razed. But it works. It was a beautiful picture.”\n\nRita served as muse several times for her husband, and when she wasn’t the subject of the photo, she helped add to the just-so-happened-glamour of Slim’s mise-en-scènes. “If you look at a beach scene or a pool scene or a party, and there’s somebody in a red bathing suit or a red sweater who has their back to you, that’s probably her—there to add color,” explains Mary.\n\nAfter my conversation with Slim’s daughter, who tells me she’s just hours into her Christmas holiday which she will spend cozy at home in Gloucester, Massachusetts, surrounded by snow and a fire, she speaks with her mother for more details about her photogenic but unpleasant Christmas swim. Her memories play out like a sepia-tinged highlights reel of Hollywood’s golden age.\n\nRita recalls staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel when the photo was taken. She remembers the hotel filled with stars who all partied together, including Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn was always really kind to her—she needed a friend, she says. She and Slim went to the set of The Seven Year Itch and Marilyn offered to lend her car to the couple. Rita remembers caroling in Beverly Hills with Bette Davis and her husband Gary Merrill. New Year’s Eve was spent with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. She helped actor Van Johnson find a church to go to…but by mistake steered him to wrong the denomination. And Rita guesses the pool boy set up the tree in the pool.\n\nToday, Rita lives near her daughter in an apartment in an assisted living community. In her bathroom, she hangs her late husband’s famous photos, some starring her. Says Mary, “Sometimes I ask her, ‘Do your friends ever wonder who this lady is, why you have these photographs?’ I don’t think many of them have had their pictures in the New York Times. It’s sort of her little secret. If she’s in Vogue, she won’t be able to tell her dinner mates. She’s like, ‘Don’t tell anybody, don’t make a fuss!’”\n\nRita’s low-key way is one she shared with her husband. According to those who worked with him and knew him best, Slim knew his place as a documentarian, a chronicler—albeit, at times, one skilled in artful interventions. “Slim was an anthropologist with his camera,” says photographer Douglas Friedman. “He documented an entire era.” Though he was a genuine companion to the likes of Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart, his way of life was much more modest. In 1953, the photographer purchased a charming 1782 clapboard farmhouse in Katonah, New York. That was his Xanadu, a place he would return to after traversing the most glamorous corners of the earth, and where he would enjoy a quiet life with Rita and Mary. A Vanity Fair article from 2003 describes entering the home and being “greeted by an American flag and, at Christmastime, by a cardboard pinup of Charlie Brown.” The writer also cited in Slim a “weakness for needlepoint cushions.”\n\nSlim was a man of three worlds: the one he memorialized in his preppy-colored photos containing princes and polo players, the one he would make for his family in Katonah, and the one he was born into—which few know anything about. In the 2016 documentary Slim Aarons: The High Life, Mary and Rita reveal a surprising truth that was kept from them all their lives. Upon Slim’s death, a relative brought to light the fact that Slim was born to a poor, Jewish, Yiddish-speaking immigrant family in the Lower East Side. His mother suffered from a mental illness and was institutionalized, and his younger brother would tragically take his own life. It was a bleak reality that Slim scrubbed from accounts of his own childhood; he claimed to grow up an orphan in New Hampshire. To those who loved Slim, this revelation was not a happy one. Not because Slim painted a partly fictional picture of his youth, but because of the loneliness it must have instilled in him. Slim would always feel he was on the outside looking in, though, with his camera, he was productive not defeated, transforming his vantage point into one that the world could marvel at.\n\nMary tells me she brings out “Christmas Swim” each year—part of her holiday decorations. She’s delighted that the photo is cherished by so many. “My dad’s also sort of an Instagram star. He died in 2006—he would be 104 right now—but if he were alive, and if we tried to explain this to him, how his pictures have a life all over the world, by all sorts of demographics, it would be beyond,” says Mary. “And the fact that people don’t pay for it—anybody can look at his pictures. That’s what would get him—where’d they get the rights to use that?”\n\n“But it’s just pretty amazing,” says Mary of the photo. “It’s what—65 years old or so? And it’s sort of timeless. It could be Katy Perry lying in a pool, other than the fact that it would be a much fancier house and a much fancier tree.”"
