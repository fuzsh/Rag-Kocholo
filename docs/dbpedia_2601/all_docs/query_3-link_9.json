        "text": "If you have any $1 bills in your wallet or under your couch, you might want to think twice before using them.\n\nThis is because currency collectors in the U.S. are willing to pay up to $150,000 for some versions of the dollar bill with a particular printing error.\n\nAccording to Wealthynickel.com, some dollar bills printed in 2014 and 2016 feature a mistake from the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing that could make them worth $150,000 by collectors.\n\nHere's everything you need to know:\n\nHow many of these $1 bills are in circulation\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, a total of 6.4 million banknotes were printed with the error in 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe federal bank in New York issued one batch while the second was issued in Washington D.C., though the bills could be anywhere in the world at this point.\n\nU.S. & World\n\nNews from around the country and around the globe\n\nHow to identify if your $1 bill is worth thousands\n\nAccording to WealthyNickel, here’s what to look for:\n\nThe Series date located on the far right of the photograph of George Washington must read “Series 2013”\n\nThe bill has a “B” Federal Reserve Seal above the serial number located to the right of Washington's photo\n\nThe serial number ends with a star (★) and fall between B00000001★ – B00250000★ or B03200001★-B09600000★\n\nIf your bill has these characteristics, you must now find the the other one from the matching pair with the same serial number.\n\nHow many matching $1 pairs have been found\n\nTo date, only nine pairs with matching serial numbers have been found, meaning millions are still in circulation.\n\nA matching pair can reach between $20,000 and $150,000 depending on the condition, according to WealthyNickel.\n\nIf you believe you have a matching bill, you should take it to a local coin shop to inspect and appraise it.\n\nWhy are they worth so much"
