The images produced were in different locations, at different times, and in different historical moments.\n\nInevitably, items in the collections reflect the approaches to research at the time when they were produced and attitudes of those who created them. Users should be aware that some of the representations of people or cultures are offensive by today's standards and that others were also controversial at the time of their creation.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz Limited Edition Collection\n\nEvery journey brings us home\n\nMoleskine celebrates a story that moves us to look beyond ourselves to find the answers within. The Wizard of Oz Limited Edition Collection consists of 4 charming and nostalgic notebooks, each one referring to a different chapter from this classic children's tale by L. Frank Baum. From the Cowardly Lion to the Deadly Poppy Field, the Magic Art of the Great Humbug and the Search for the Wicked Witch, join Dorothy and friends as they move towards the Emerald City and the answers they all seek.\n\nEach notebook in the collection has a tactile printed canvas cover featuring original artwork by W. W. Denslow, alongside a quote from the relevant chapter on the back. The iconic illustrations continue on the endpapers inside, on a set of themed stickers and on the paperband b-side, which features an \"I am reading. Do not disturb\" sign to cut out and make.\n\nEmbark on your own journey of self-discovery on the pages of these 4 collectible The Wizard of Oz Limited Edition Notebooks.\n\nWe created the leather jacket under our license with the Ministry of Defence. It is in the style of the flight jacket worn by RAF pilots during the Second World War. The jacket features official MoD insignia including their crest on the sleeve and the Pilots’ Wings Brevet on the chest.\n\nIn order to make the jacket unique, we sought to line the jacket with a design which would help to anchor the jacket in era of WWII. We felt the silk escape maps from the War provided an appropriate inspiration for the lining. The Schaffhausen Airey Neave escape map was well-suited to the design for the lining given its history, the high level of detail and the clearly marked route to help Allied forces make a safe journey to neutral Switzerland.\n\nAs the jacket lining could only include a section of the map, we also provided the customer with a reproduction of the map in its entirety. - Jennifer Darling"
