        "text": "A Date with Destiny\n\nToday marks the anniversary of three transformative technologies. On August 12, 1877, Thomas Edison discovered the phonograph. When the device was unveiled later that year, the public’s amazement was followed by universal acclaim for Edison. Another giant leap occurred on August 12, 1981, when the IBM PC was introduced, which led to the mass adoption of personal computers. And on this day in 1851, Isaac Singer patented his sewing machine, the first to allow continuous and curved stitching.\n\nY’all Ready for This?\n\nAugust is National Make-a-Will Month, and as any fan of the show Succession will tell you, if you don’t have your legacy in place—or you have plans, but they’re not documented, signed, and notarized—you’re asking for trouble. Here are a few estate planning tips from Britannica Money.\n\nWills aren’t just for the rich\n\nYou’ve no doubt heard stories of celebrities and public figures who died without a valid will in place—Prince, Aretha Franklin, and even Abraham Lincoln—but anyone with assets or loved ones should have a legally binding will. These days, unless you have a complex estate, you don’t even need a lawyer (sorry, Abe); there are inexpensive services and even free templates online that can help you create it.\n\nEstate planning 101\n\nA will is only one step in the estate planning process. To be fully prepared, make sure you have named beneficiaries on all your accounts, designate a trusted friend or relative to hold power of attorney, name a health care proxy, and decide whether you need a living will. If your estate is large or complex, talk to your attorney about setting up and deciding between a revocable or irrevocable trust. And if you need help getting started, download the Britannica Money estate planning checklist [PDF].\n\nDon’t forget the pets\n\nIn most countries, you can’t bequeath assets directly to an animal (as was demonstrated in 2019 with designer Karl Lagerfeld’s cat, Choupette). What you can do, however, is create a pet trust, which stipulates how to care for your pets when you die or become unable to care for them. But don’t assume an over-the-top wish will go unchallenged. When “Queen of Mean” Leona Helmsley cut two of her grandchildren out of her will—but left a $12 million pet trust for her beloved Maltese, Trouble—a judge changed the benefit after a challenge was brought by family members."
