        "text": "Learners demonstrate what they “can do” consistently in each mode and at each sub-level, in numerous situations throughout the learning process. Learners may be at different levels for different modes (Interpretive, Interpersonal, Presentational) or skills (reading, listening, writing, speaking, signing).\n\nCan-Do Statements are NOT a checklist of tasks to be demonstrated once and checked off\n\nIt is not sufficient for learners to show evidence of performance in just one specific situation; the indicators and examples at each sublevel illustrate how learners might demonstrate skills in each mode of communication through a wide variety of evidence.\n\nCan-Do Statements describe what learners can independently do at each sublevel and help pave the way to higher levels. Higher level skills and functions (e.g., using timeframes, understanding complex texts) need to be introduced at lower sublevels and built upon in order to have independent control of those skills and functions at higher sublevels.\n\nCan-Do Statements are NOT a limitation of what to learn or teach\n\nCan-Do Statements do not show what to learn or teach at each sublevel; the descriptors show the skills and functions that can be done with full control at that sublevel. Learners should work with authentic texts and real-life scenarios at all levels and sublevels and set goals for how to progress to the next higher level.\n\nThe examples include topics that expand across the proficiency continuum, from familiar (daily life, personal experiences, classroom or researched topics) to concrete to abstract. Learners and educators are encouraged to customize the “I can . . .” examples in order to fit the content and context of the learning and the targeted proficiency level.\n\nThe sets of examples are NOT a prescribed curriculum\n\nThe Can-Do Statements include examples of communicative performance to adapt or modify for local curricula; they are not intended to provide ready-made lessons. The examples provided do not claim to be exhaustive or specific to a level of schooling.\n\nLearners and educators use the statements for self-evaluation to become more aware of what they know and can do in the target language. By using statements aligned to the proficiency scale, educators can more easily create rubrics that enable learners to chart their progress.\n\nThe Can-Do statements are NOT used as an instrument for determining a letter or number grade\n\nGrowth in acquiring a language is measured over time when tasks are integrated into performance assessments and evaluated using rubrics based on the ACTFL proficiency descriptors."
