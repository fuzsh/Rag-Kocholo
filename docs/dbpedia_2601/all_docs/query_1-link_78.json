        "text": "The first women's soccer national championship was awarded to North Carolina in 1982, for its 2-0 win over Central Florida.\n\nSince that inaugural NCAA DI women's soccer national championship, 11 teams have finished the season at the top of the sport. The 2023 season ended with Florida State moving into second place with its fourth national championship in school history and its second in the past three years.\n\nRANKINGS: Stay update to the with the latest women's soccer rankings\n\nLet's take a look at the eight teams that have won at least two titles.\n\nWomen's college soccer history: Programs with the most national championships\n\n1. North Carolina — 21\n\nChampionships: 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012\n\nThere is no questioning the fact that North Carolina has been absolutely dominant in women's soccer. The Tar Heels haven't notched a national championship win since 2012, but have been national runners-up three times since 2018. They have 21 titles overall, all under coach Anson Dorrance, who retired before the 2024 season. That's over 50 percent of all DI NCAA women's soccer national championships ever played. North Carolina's 1992 national championship was the highest-scoring title game in the history of the sport, ending in a 9-1 victory over Duke.\n\n2. Florida State — 4\n\nChampionships: 2014, 2018, 2021, 2023\n\nAfter coming close twice as national runners-up in 2007 and 2013, the Seminoles finally captured their elusive national title in 2014. A mere four years later, they captured No. 2, taking down North Carolina—our winningest team on the list — 1-0 in the Women's College Cup. The Seminoles won against BYU with a 4-3 victory in penalties in 2021. They secured their fourth national championship in 2024 with a 5-1 win over Stanford.\n\nHISTORY: Women's soccer teams with the most consecutive home wins\n\n3 (tie). Stanford — 3\n\nChampionships: 2011, 2017, 2019\n\nBoth Stanford's women's and men's soccer teams won national championships in the 2017 season. The Cardinal had an almost perfect season, finishing at 23-1-0 with their 3-1 victory over UCLA. The Cardinal had another monster season just two years later, finishing 24-1-0 and defeating the winningest team in women's soccer championship history (North Carolina) for its third title. Stanford's other national championship came in 2011 with another almost perfect final record (25-0-1) with a 1-0 win over Duke.\n\n3 (tie). Notre Dame — 3\n\nChampionships: 1995, 2004, 2010\n\nAll three of Notre Dame's women's soccer national championships are pretty spread out. The Fighting Irish's 2010 victory was a seemingly simple 1-0 final over Stanford. The other two weren't so easy. During the 1995 championship, Notre Dame went into three overtime periods before beating out Portland 1-0 for the title. In the 2004 game, the Fighting Irish went into double overtime with UCLA, finally winning 1-1 on penalty kicks.\n\n4 (tie). Santa Clara — 2\n\nChampionships: 2001, 2020\n\nIn 2001, Santa Clara raised its first Women's College Cup trophy defeating North Carolina, 1-0. Almost two decades later, the Broncos reclaimed victory against upsetting No. 1 Florida State winning 1-1 on penalty kicks.\n\n4 (tie). Southern California — 2\n\nChampionships: 2007, 2016\n\nAfter winning their first national championship in 2007, the Trojans would wait nine years to relive that glory. The second national championship came in 2016 with a 3-1 win over West Virginia. The first goal was scored in the second minute of the game, with two more following in the second half.\n\n4 (tie). UCLA — 2\n\nChampionships: 2013, 2022\n\nThe Bruins first won the national title in 2013 with a 1-0 OT win against Florida State. Nine years later, they dramatically topped North Carolina, earning a 3-2 win in OT.\n\n4 (tie). Portland — 2\n\nChampionships: 2002, 2005\n\nPortland is the third women's soccer program tied for two national championships. Their 2002 championship took two extra time periods to win, but the Pilots came out with a 2-1 victory over Santa Clara. In 2005, UCLA fell to Portland 4-0 in the title game.\n\nSHOP CHAMPIONSHIP GEAR: Buy 2023 official Florida State women's soccer College Cup gear\n\nWomen's college soccer: Complete history of the championship match\n\nHere's the complete list of women's college soccer national champions:\n\nYear Team (Record) Score Runner-Up Site 2023 Florida State (22-0-1) 5-1 Stanford Cary, N.C. 2022 UCLA (22-2-1) 3-2 (ot) North Carolina Cary, N.C. 2021 Florida State (22-1-2) 0-0 (2ot, pk) BYU Santa Clara, Calif. 2020 Santa Clara (10-1-1) 1-1 (2ot, pk) Florida State Cary, N.C. 2019 Stanford (24-1-0) 0-0 (2ot, pk) North Carolina San Jose, Calif. 2018 Florida State (20-4-3) 1-0 North Carolina Cary, N.C. 2017 Stanford (23-1-0) 3-2 UCLA Orlando, Fla. 2016 Southern California (19-4-2) 3-1 West Virginia San Jose, Calif. 2015 Penn State (22-3-2) 1-0 Duke Cary, N.C. 2014 Florida State (23-1-1) 1-0 Virginia Boca Raton, Fla. 2013 UCLA (22-1-3) 1-0 (OT) Florida State Cary, N.C. 2012 North Carolina (15-5-3) 4-1 Penn State San Diego, Calif. 2011 Stanford (25-0-1) 1-0 Duke Kennesaw, Ga. 2010 Notre Dame (21-2-2) 1-0 Stanford Cary, N.C. 2009 North Carolina (23-3-1) 1-0 Stanford Texas A&M 2008 North Carolina (25-1-2) 2-1 Notre Dame Cary, N.C. 2007 Southern California (20-3-2) 2-0 Florida State Texas A&M 2006 North Carolina (27-1) 2-1 Notre Dame Cary, N.C. 2005 Portland (23-0-2) 4-0 UCLA Texas A&M 2004 *Notre Dame (25-1-1) 1-1 (2 ot, pk) UCLA Cary, N.C. 2003 North Carolina (27-0) 6-0 Connecticut Cary, N.C. 2002 Portland (20-4-2) 2-1 (2 ot) Santa Clara Austin, Texas 2001 Santa Clara (23-2) 1-0 North Carolina SMU 2000 North Carolina (21-3) 2-1 UCLA San Jose State 1999 North Carolina (24-2) 2-0 Notre Dame San Jose State 1998 Florida (26-1) 1-0 North Carolina UNC Greensboro 1997 North Carolina (27-0-1) 2-0 Connecticut UNC Greensboro 1996 North Carolina (25-1) 1-0 (2 ot) Notre Dame Santa Clara 1995 Notre Dame (21-2-2) 1-0 (3 ot) Portland North Carolina 1994 North Carolina (25-1-1) 5-0 Notre Dame Portland 1993 North Carolina (23-0) 6-0 George Mason North Carolina 1992 North Carolina (25-0) 9-1 Duke North Carolina 1991 North Carolina (25-0) 3-1 Wisconsin North Carolina 1990 North Carolina (24-0) 6-0 Connecticut North Carolina 1989 North Carolina (24-0-1) 2-0 Colorado College North Carolina State 1988 North Carolina (18-0-3) 4-1 North Carolina State North Carolina 1987 North Carolina (23-0-1) 1-0 Massachusetts Massachusetts 1986 North Carolina (24-0-1) 2-0 Colorado College George Mason 1985 George Mason (18-2-1) 2-0 North Carolina George Mason 1984 North Carolina (24-0-1) 2-0 Connecticut North Carolina 1983 North Carolina (19-1) 4-0 George Mason UCF 1982 North Carolina (19-2) 2-0 UCF UCF\n\n*Declared champion on the basis of penalty kicks."
