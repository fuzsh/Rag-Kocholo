        "text": "Image Date Photographer Location Technique Owner Notes 1846 or 1847 Nicholas H. Shepherd Springfield, Illinois Daguerreotype, quarter plate[2] Library of Congress This daguerreotype is the earliest confirmed photographic image of Abraham Lincoln. It was reportedly made in 1846 by Nicholas H. Shepherd shortly after Lincoln was elected to the United States House of Representatives. Shepherd's Daguerreotype Miniature Gallery, which he advertised in the Sangamo Journal, was located in Springfield over the drug store of J. Brookie. Shepherd also studied law at the law office of Lincoln and Herndon.[3] October 27, 1854 Johan Carl Frederic Polycarpus Von Schneidau[4] Chicago, Illinois Gelatin silver print of a presumed lost daguerreotype[5] The second earliest known photograph of Lincoln. From a photograph owned originally by George Schneider, former editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, the most influential anti-slavery German newspaper of the West. Mr. Schneider first met Mr. Lincoln in 1853, in Springfield. \"He was already a man necessary to know\", says Mr. Schneider. In 1854 Mr. Lincoln was in Chicago, and Isaac N. Arnold invited Mr. Schneider to dine with Mr. Lincoln. After dinner, as the gentlemen were going down town, they stopped at an itinerant photograph gallery, and Mr. Lincoln had this picture taken for Mr. Schneider.[6] February 28, 1857 Alexander Hessler Chicago, Illinois[7] Gelatin silver print from the lost original negative\n\nI have a letter from Mr. Hesler stating that [Lincoln] came in and made arrangements for the sitting, so that the members of the bar could get prints. Lincoln said at the time that he did not know why the boys wanted such a homely face. Joseph Medill went with Mr. Lincoln to have the picture taken. He says that the photographer insisted on smoothing down Lincoln's hair, but Lincoln did not like the result, and ran his fingers through it before sitting.\n\n— H. W. Fay of DeKalb, Illinois, original owner of the photo[8]\n\nLincoln immediately prior to his Senate nomination. The original negative was burned in the Great Chicago Fire.[8] May 27, 1857 Amon T. Joslin Danville, Illinois Ambrotype[9] Lincoln Financial Foundation Collection, Allen County Public Library Although some historians have dated this photograph during the court session of November 13, 1859, and others have placed it as early as 1853, most authorities now believe it was taken on May 27, 1857. The photographer Amon T. Joslin owned \"Joslin's Gallery\" located on the second floor of a building adjoining the Woodbury Drug Store, in Danville, IL. This was one of Lincoln's favorite stopping places in Vermilion County, Illinois, while he was a traveling lawyer. Joslin photographed Abraham Lincoln twice at this sitting. Lincoln kept one copy and gave the other to his friend, Thomas J. Hilyard, deputy sheriff of Vermilion County. Today, one original resides in the Illinois State Historical Library.[10] 1858 Roderick M. Cole Peoria, Illinois Daguerreotype (?)[11] Benjamin Shapell Family Manuscript Foundation\n\n... the Photo you have of Abraham Lincoln is a copy of a Daguerreotype, that I made in my gallery in this city [Peoria] during the Lincoln and Douglas campaign. I invited him to my gallery to give me a sitting ... and when I had my plate ready, he said to me, 'I cannot see why all you artists want a likeness of me unless it is because I am the homeliest man in the State of Illinois.'\"\n\n— R.M. Cole, July 3, 1905, letter to David McCulloch[12]\n\nLincoln liked this image and often signed photographic prints for admirers. In fact, in 1861, he even gave a copy to his stepmother. The image was extensively employed on campaign ribbons in the 1860 Presidential campaign, and Lincoln \"often signed photographic prints for visitors.\"[12]\n\n1858 (?) unknown unknown Tintype[13] National Lincoln Museum (Old Ford's Theatre)[14] This is the only extant original tintype of Lincoln[14] 1858 (?) Ohio (?) Photographic copy of a lost daguerreotype[15] Anthony L. Maresh collection A Civil War soldier from Parma, Ohio, was the original owner of this portrait, published in the Cleveland Plain Dealer on February 12, 1942, from a print in the Anthony L. Maresh collection. Possibly it is a photographic copy of one of two daguerreotypes, both now lost, taken in Ohio.[15] 1858 (?) Springfield, Illinois Photographic copy unknown In 1858, Lincoln squared off against Stephen Douglas for Illinois' Senate seat. The battle sparked seven heated debates on slavery. Here, supporters gather outside Lincoln's Springfield home. Lincoln is the tall, white figure by the doorway.[16] May 7, 1858 Abraham M. Byers Beardstown, Illinois[17] Ambrotype University of Nebraska Formerly in the Lincoln Monument collection at Springfield, Illinois. Mr. Lincoln wore a linen coat on the occasion. The picture is regarded as a good likeness of him as he appeared during the Lincoln Douglas campaign.[18] May 25, 1858 Samuel G. Alschuler Urbana, Illinois[19] Library of Congress\n\nAt the time I was [a young] clerk of the circuit court, and was about as well acquainted with Mr. Lincoln as with most of the forty-odd lawyers who practiced law in the circuit ... On the opening day of court, which was always an interesting occasion, largely because we were curious to see what attorneys from a distance were in attendance ... I observed that Mr. Lincoln was among them; and as I looked in his direction, he arose from his seat, and came forward and gave me a cordial hand-shake, accompanying the action with words of congratulation on my election. I mention this fact because the conduct of Mr. Lincoln was so in contrast with that of the other members of the bar that it touched me deeply, and made me, ever afterwards, his steadfast friend.\"\n\n— C. F. Gunther of Chicago, circa 1896 Letter[20]\n\nOne morning I was in the gallery of Mr. Alschuler, when Mr. Lincoln came into the room and said he had been informed that he (Alschuler) wished him to sit for a picture. Alschuler said he had sent such a message to Mr. Lincoln, but he could not take the picture in that coat (referring to a linen duster in which Mr. Lincoln was clad), and asked if he had not a dark coat in which he could sit. Mr. Lincoln said he had not; that this was the only coat he had brought with him from his home. Alschuler said he could wear his coat, and gave it to Mr. Lincoln, who pulled off the duster and put on the artist's coat. Alschuler was a very short man, with short arms, but with a body nearly as large as the body of Mr. Lincoln. The arms of the latter extended through the sleeves of the coat of Alschuler a quarter of a yard, making him quite ludicrous, at which he (Lincoln) laughed immoderately, and sat down for the picture to be taken with an effort at being sober enough for the occasion. The lips in the picture show this.\"\n\n— Mr. J. O. Cunningham, present when the picture was taken[20]\n\nJuly 18, 1858 Preston Butler[21] Springfield, Illinois Gelatin silver print of a lost carbon enlargement of the lost ambrotype This image was presumably taken by Preston Butler the day after Lincoln delivered a speech in Springfield in which Lincoln urges that slavery be placed on the course of \"ultimate extinction\". He attacks Stephen Douglas and defends himself by stating that he supports the principles of equality put forth in the Declaration of Independence. This speech preceded his debates with Douglas.[22] August 26, 1858 T. P. Pearson[23] Macomb, Illinois Ambrotype\n\nMr. Magie happened to remain over night at Macomb, at the same hotel with Mr. Lincoln, and the next morning took a walk about town, and upon Mr. Magie's invitation they stepped into Mr. Pierson's establishment, and the ambrotype of which this is a copy was the result. Mr. Lincoln, upon entering, looked at the camera as though he was unfamiliar with such an instrument, and then remarked: 'Well, do you want to take a shot at me with this thing?' He was shown to a glass, where he was told to 'fix up,' but declined, saying it would not be much of a likeness if he fixed up any. The old neighbors and acquaintances of Mr. Lincoln in Illinois, upon seeing this picture, are apt to exclaim: 'There! that's the best likeness of Mr. Lincoln that I ever saw!' The dress he wore in this picture is the same in which he made his famous canvass with Senator Douglas.\"\n\n— J. C. Power, custodian of the Lincoln monument in Springfield[24]\n\nSeptember 26, 1858 attributed to Christopher S. German[25] Springfield, Illinois unknown Chicago History Museum\n\nIn 1858 Lincoln and Douglas had a series of joint debates in this State, and this city was one place of meeting. Mr. Lincoln's step-mother was making her home with my father and mother at that time. Mr. Lincoln stopped at our house, and as he was going away my mother said to him: \"Uncle Abe, I want a picture of you.\" He replied, \"Well, Harriet, when I get home I will have one taken for you and send it to you.\" Soon after, mother received the photograph, which she still has, already framed, from Springfield, Illinois, with a letter from Mr. Lincoln, in which he said, \"This is not a very good-looking picture, but it's the best that could be produced from the poor subject.\" He also said that he had it taken solely for my mother.\"\n\n— Mr. K. N. Chapman of Charleston, Illinois, great-grandson of Sarah Bush Lincoln[26]\n\nOctober 1, 1858 Calvin Jackson[27] Pittsfield, Illinois Ambrotype Library of Congress On the afternoon of Friday, October 1, 1858, Lincoln had a luncheon at the home of his attorney friend, Daniel H. Gilmer in Pittsfield, Illinois. Lincoln then headed across the street to the town square, where he spoke for two hours. Following the address, Lincoln, at the request of Gilmer, went to the portable canvas photo gallery of Calvin Jackson on the northeast corner of the square and sat for two ambrotype poses. The photos were soon processed, but one was not finished, probably because it had been overexposed. Lincoln requested that copies of the other be delivered to two Pittsfield friends the following day.[28] October 11, 1858 William Judkins Thomson[29] Monmouth, Illinois National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution This ambrotype was taken two days before the next to last debate with Douglas in Quincy, Illinois.[30] 1859 (?) unknown Springfield, Illinois unknown unknown Photograph, of unknown origin, shows Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois, probably in 1859.[31] October 4, 1859 Samuel M. Fassett[32] Chicago, Illinois Photograph Negative destroyed in Great Chicago Fire[33] Lincoln sat for this portrait at the gallery of Cooke and Fassett in Chicago. Cooke wrote in 1865 \"Mrs. Lincoln pronounced [it] the best likeness she had ever seen of her husband.\"[33] February 27, 1860 Mathew Brady[34] New York, New York Carte-de-visite printed by Brady's gallery from a lost copy negative of a retouched original print Library of Congress Mathew Brady's first photograph of Lincoln, on the day of the Cooper Union speech. Over the following weeks, newspapers and magazines gave full accounts of the event, noting the high spirits of the crowd and the stirring rhetoric of the speaker. Artists for Harper's Weekly converted Brady's photograph to a full-page woodcut portrait to illustrate their story of Lincoln's triumph, and in October 1860, Leslie's Weekly used the same image to illustrate a story about the election. Brady himself sold many carte-de-visite photographs of the Illinois politician who had captured the eye of the nation. Brady remembered that he drew Lincoln's collar up high to improve his appearance; subsequent versions of this famous portrait also show that artists smoothed Lincoln's hair, smoothed facial lines and straightened his subject's \"roving\" left eye. After Lincoln secured the Republican nomination and the presidency, he gave credit to his Cooper Union speech and this portrait, saying, \"Brady and the Cooper Institute made me President.\"[35] 1860 (Spring or Summer) unknown Illinois (?) unknown Contemporary albumen print believed to be the only surviving likeness printed from the lost original negative made by an unknown photographer, probably in Springfield or Chicago, during the spring or summer of 1860.[36] May 9, 1860 Edward A. Barnwell Decatur, Illinois Positive printed on glass from a lost original negative or ambrotype[37] Decatur Public Library Abraham Lincoln was in Decatur to attend the Illinois State Republican Convention. Local photographer Edward A. Barnwell wanted to take a picture of \"the biggest man\" at the convention and invited Lincoln to his People's Ambrotype Gallery at 24 North Water Street to pose for this portrait. The next day, after Richard Oglesby introduced the \"Rail Splitter\", convention delegates unanimously endorsed Lincoln for President. On May 18 the National Republican Convention meeting in Chicago nominated him as the party's candidate.[38] May 20, 1860 William Marsh[39] Springfield, Illinois Gelatin silver print copy from the original ambrotype Library of Congress Presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois, two days after he won his party's nomination.[40] William Marsh[41] Salt print from glass negative[42] Metropolitan Museum of Art One of five photographs taken by William Marsh for Marcus Lawrence Ward. Although many in the East had read Lincoln's impassioned speeches, few had actually seen the Representative from Illinois.[40] June 3, 1860 Alexander Hesler[43] Photograph Library of Congress Hesler took a total of four portraits at this sitting. Lincoln's law partner William Herndon wrote of this picture: \"There is the peculiar curve of the lower lip, the lone mole on the right cheek, and a pose of the head so essentially Lincolnian; no other artist has ever caught it.\"[44] Alexander Hesler[45] Museum of Fine Arts, Boston When Lincoln saw this photograph, along with his side view portrait from the same sitting, he remarked \"That looks better and expresses me better than any I have ever seen; if it pleases the people I am satisfied.\"[46] Alexander Hesler[47] Library of Congress Lincoln and a Chicago reporter were looking at what is believed to this photo at Lincoln's home shortly after his nomination for president, when he observed \"That picture gives a very fair representation of my homely face.\"[48] June 1860[49] unknown Halftone print, from an albumen print from the lost original negative.[50] unknown In the summer of 1860 Mr. M. C. Tuttle, a photographer of St. Paul, wrote to Mr. Lincoln, requesting that he have a negative taken and sent to him for local use in the campaign. The request was granted, but the negative was broken in transit. On learning of the accident, Mr. Lincoln sat again, and with the second negative he sent a jocular note wherein he referred to the fact, disclosed by the picture, that in the interval he had \"got a new coat\". A few copies of the picture were made by Mr. Tuttle, and distributed among the Republican editors of the State.[51] 1860 (summer) William Seavey[52] Photograph After this single print was made, the negative was lost when a fire destroyed the photographer's gallery.[53] 1860 (spring or summer)[54] unknown Contemporary albumen print believed to be the only surviving likeness printed from the lost original negative[55] Library of Congress A study of Lincoln's powerful physique, this full-length photograph as taken for use by sculptor Henry Kirke Brown, and was found among his effects in 1931.[56] 1860 (spring or summer)[57] William Shaw Chicago or Springfield, Illinois Albumen print from a lost contemporary negative Chicago Sun-Times Archives This image has been heavily retouched at some point.

All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husbands to vote for you and then you would be President.\" and the president-elect responded \"As to the whiskers have never worn any do you not think people would call it a silly affection if I were to begin it now?\" Regardless, the next time he visited his barber William Florville, he announced \"Billy, let's give them a chance to grow.\"[66] By the time he began his inaugural journey by train from Illinois to Washington, D.C., he had a full beard.

Alexander Gardner[120] Gelatin silver print of a lost period print of the multiple-image stereographic pose[121] This photograph of Lincoln was made when the burden of the presidency had taken its toll. President Lincoln visited Gardner's studio one Sunday in February 1865, the final year of the Civil War, accompanied by the American portraitist Matthew Wilson. Wilson had been commissioned to paint the president's portrait, but because Lincoln could spare so little time to pose, the artist needed recent photographs to work from. The pictures served their purpose, but the resulting painting- a traditional, formal, bust-length portrait in an oval format—is not particularly distinguished and hardly remembered today. Gardner's surprisingly candid photographs have proven more enduring, even though they were not originally intended to stand alone as works of art.[122] Alexander Gardner[123] Only surviving print from a glass negative that was accidentally cracked during processing and thrown away[124] National Portrait Gallery According to Frank Goodyear, the National Portrait Gallery's photo curator, \"This is the last formal portrait of Abraham Lincoln before his assassination.

The inauguration is a couple of weeks away; he can understand that the war is coming to an end; and here he permits, for one of the first times during his presidency, a hint of better days tomorrow.\"[124] March 4, 1865 Alexander Gardner 1 photographic print: albumen silver Library of Congress Cropped portion of Lincoln delivering his second inaugural address, which is the only known photograph of the event.
