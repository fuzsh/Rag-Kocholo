        "text": "The Law Library employs an online reservation system for non-law school UCLA/UC Students to obtain access to the Law Library. Further details are below.\n\nNote to UCLA faculty teaching or supervising UCLA students who need ongoing access to the Law Library's materials for research or assignments: read our \"Exemption Handout\" for information about obtaining a temporary exemption to this policy for these students.\n\nPOLICIES & PROCEDURES:\n\nNon-law UCLA and other UC students must present a current BruinCard (or current student photo ID from their home institution) and make a reservation for a study space for Law Library access (details follow).\n\nAccess to the Law Library for non-law UCLA/UC students is limited to a small number of users per day, controlled by a reservation system. These users can reserve a space for same day usage starting at 11:59pm the prior evening (subject to availability). Reservations must be made using a ucla.edu email address (or uci.edu, ucr.edu, etc.). Spaces are available for three separate entry times per day. Reservation holders may use the Law Library any time after the reserved entry time for that day until the Library closes. The Law Library Guard will ask to see a current BruinCard or current UC student photo ID and will verify your reservation in our system before you will be admitted.\n\nUsers with reservations may exit the library and return on the same day, but should be prepared to show their photo ID for reservation verification when re-entering.\n\nLaw Library access may be canceled by a Law Library Supervisor whenever necessary to ensure useful access to the facility for UCLA Law School community. Additionally, access to users outside of the Law School may be further restricted or unavailable during Law School finals or other high use times at the discretion of Law Library Administration.\n\nAny reservation holder who is found in an area reserved for the UCLA Law School Community,* who is found violating any other Library policy, or who is disruptive in any way, will have their access revoked and must leave the Library immediately.\n\n*NOTE: Access to the Library does not include access to areas designated for the exclusive use of UCLA Law Students, Faculty, and Staff, such as the Tower Reading Room, Conference Rooms, and the After Hours Reading Room.\n\nMembers of the Bar in good standing can access the law library by presenting a current state bar membership card and official photo ID.\n\nAlthough the Hugh & Hazel Darling Law Library welcomes attorneys, the primary mission of the law library is to support the teaching and research activities of the UCLA School of Law. Because of limited funds and increasing prices, the law library no longer subscribes to print versions of most materials available to our faculty and students through their Lexis and Westlaw accounts. Because of contract restrictions, the law library is unable to provide attorneys with Lexis and Westlaw access.\n\nAttorneys are encouraged to email lawpatrons@law.ucla.edu before visiting the law library to confirm that we have the resources that you need. Please allow one business day for a response. For additional details on the law library’s services for attorneys and the availability of commonly used resources, please read our Law Library Services for Attorneys handout.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nAccess to the Federal Depository Collection by the general public is an exception to the Law Library’s Access Policy. This exception is made in order to provide access to government information. Access to the Federal Depository Collection entitles members of the public to use those publications received through the Federal Depository Library Program only; it does not entitle the visitor to use the Law Library’s general collections, services, or physical space. Once the user has completed their use of the federal depository documents, they are required to leave the Law Library promptly. Please note that the Law Library receives only a very small portion of federal depository materials.\n\nApplication for Access to the Federal Depository Collection\n\nAdvance reservations are recommended for members of the public to ensure access to the Federal Depository Collection. Because of our limited selection of depository materials and/or staffing availability, we cannot guarantee access to the needed materials unless prior arrangements have been made. Users can request reservation sessions by emailing govdocs@law.ucla.edu or by calling (310) 825-3166. Be sure to include the following information: your name, contact information (phone number or email address), and a description of the federal depository materials you are requesting to access (with titles and call numbers if possible).\n\nRequestors will receive a response within two business days. Federal Depository users with an immediate need may contact the library at (310) 825-3166 for assistance and will be accommodated as staff is available.\n\nProcedures for Use of Depository Collection\n\nCheck in with the guard at the Library’s entrance at the appointed time. Visitors must present a government issued photo ID.\n\nThe guard will escort the visitor to the Reference Reading Room where the requested document will be paged. The visitor will be required to work in the Reference Reading Room for the duration of the appointment.\n\nUpon completion of the use of the federal depository documents, the visitor will be required to leave the Law Library promptly.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: During Law School Final exams, or other periods of heavy Library use by the UCLA Law School community, the access policy may change and access to the Law Library may not be available. See the Law Library Access Policy above for more general information about access to the Law Library.\n\nThe UCLA Hugh & Hazel Darling Law Library is the primary place of study and research for the UCLA Law School community; thus, a quiet environment must be maintained. Recognizing that non-UCLA Law School users may have legitimate needs to use the Library's collection or academic services, the Law Library allows a limited number of users who are not UCLA Law School users (as specified by our Access Policy listed above) to use the Library at any one time. Access to the Law Library, however, does not grant users access to all Library services or to all areas of the Library. While in the Law Library, users who are not members of the UCLA Law School community are expected to abide by the following policies:\n\nUsers must present photo identification each time they enter the Library (and non-Law UCLA/UC students must have their study space reservation verified by the Library Guard for entry).\n\nA quiet study environment must be maintained in the Library. Any behavior that disrupts an environment that is conducive to study will not be permitted.\n\nIn accordance with UCLA campus policy, sound on cell/mobile devices must be turned off when entering the Library. As a courtesy to others, please hold all mobile phone conversations outside of the library.\n\nNo food is allowed in the Library. The Library Guard or the CSO on duty will ask users to remove or throw out any food found in the Library. Beverages are allowed in the Library, but only in the sealable, reusable containers. Beverages in disposable containers are strictly prohibited.\n\nSpecified areas of the Library, including the Tower (Fourth Floor) Reading Room and the Conference Rooms are for UCLA Law student use only.\n\nUnacceptable behaviors for all users include, but are not limited to (see additional rules below below for more information):\n\nDeliberate misuse of materials or equipment that interferes with or prevents timely access to resources or equipment by other users or staff;\n\nViolation of University policies, including policies on computer and network use, cell phone use, electronic communications and harassment;\n\nVandalism, theft or defacement of library materials or other property.\n\nUsers found violating any of the policies listed above, will be asked to leave the Law Library. Violations of Library or University policies on more than one occasion, or one-time egregious violations, are grounds for having Law Library privileges revoked. Violations of California state or Federal law will be handled appropriately.\n\nAny refusal to comply with requests made by representatives of the Law Library (including Library and Law School Staff, Library Guards, Campus Security Officers or Campus Police) in the enforcement of Library policies may be grounds for permanent revocation of Law Library use privileges. For students, violations of Law Library policies may also be referred to the appropriate Dean of Students for further action."
