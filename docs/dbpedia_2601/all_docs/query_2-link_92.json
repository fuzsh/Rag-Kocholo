        "text": "Florida State University’s summer graduates were reminded of the enduring values of resiliency, decisiveness and treating others with dignity and respect during commencement ceremonies on Friday, Aug. 2, at the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center.\n\nThe ceremonies featured addresses from former FSU quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward and Citizens Property Insurance CEO Timothy M. Cerio, who shared wisdom and inspiration with the new graduates.\n\nMore than 2,800 graduates earned a degree this summer, including 1,693 bachelor’s degrees, 882 master’s/specialist degrees, 187 doctoral degrees, 3 Juris doctor degrees, 66 Juris master’s degrees, and 3 LLMs. Nearly 1,900 students participated in the ceremonies.\n\nDOCTORAL HOODING PHOTO GALLERY\n\nThe day began with a doctoral hooding ceremony at 9 a.m., where doctoral candidates were recognized for their academic achievements.\n\nFSU President Richard McCullough presided over all three ceremonies. He congratulated the graduates and their families on reaching this significant milestone.\n\n“As you leave Florida State, I want to remind each of you that you will always be a Seminole,” McCullough told the graduates. “We want you to consider this campus your home, and I would like to encourage you to stay in touch.”\n\nAt the doctoral ceremony, he encouraged the graduates to stay resilient and to not be afraid to lean on family and friends for support.\n\nHe shared some of his own struggles while working toward his Ph.D. in organic chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. He said it wasn’t easy, but with hard work, perseverance and the support of mentors, he won the top research award for his class.\n\n“Your resilience is to not be taken lightly,” McCullough said. “It is a long road to get to where you are today with a Ph.D. It will serve you well in life.”\n\nMcCullough continued: “As the new torchbearers of our great university, I urge you all to embrace your esteemed role as highly respected scholars and leaders. You are actively shaping the future of industries, academia, the arts and scholarly achievements in society.”\n\nCOMMENCEMENT PHOTO GALLERY\n\nAt the 2 p.m. ceremony, which celebrated graduates from the Dedman College of Hospitality, Jim Moran College of Entrepreneurship, College of Applied Studies, FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, College of Social Sciences & Public Policy, College of Business, College of Music, and College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences, Ward spoke about the importance of preparation and drew from his experiences as a student-athlete at FSU.\n\nA legendary figure in FSU Athletics, Ward led the Seminole football team to its first national championship in 1993, led FSU’s basketball team to the brink of the Final Four and later had a successful career in the NBA.\n\n“Preparation is the foundation upon which success is built,” Ward told the graduates. “It is the result of hard work, dedication and attention to detail. Your commitment to thorough preparation has equipped you with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the challenges that lie ahead.”\n\nWard reflected on his own pivotal moment after winning the national championship, when he faced a tough decision between pursuing a career in the NFL or continuing with basketball. He emphasized the importance of being decisive and prepared to live with the consequences of one’s choices.\n\n“I know some of you are facing a similar decision right now,” he said. “Just trust that God has placed your decision in your heart, and He will work it out as you move forward. You see, I made a decision, and I moved in faith.”\n\nHe stressed the importance of surrounding oneself with the right people.\n\n“Your support system can help you navigate through the decision-making process as well as challenge you to achieve your goals,” he said. “I encourage you to seek great relationships. The great relationships you have in your life can help you achieve more of your long-term goals.”\n\nWard, who has dedicated his post-athletic career to coaching and mentoring and led Tallahassee’s Florida High basketball team to a state championship in 2022, also spoke about his current endeavors. He and his wife are planning to build a $55 million youth and family sports, education, arts and wellness campus in Tallahassee.\n\n“We made the decision knowing it may take us 10 years or 20 years to complete this project. But with our team, we are preparing for our future by being the best stewards of the resources today,” he said. “Your daily choices should be in alignment with your future goals. This is what keeps you from erring off the path to successful accomplishments.”\n\nHe concluded by urging the graduates to “be decisive and prepare for tomorrow by being your best today.”\n\nAt the 7 p.m. ceremony, Cerio addressed graduates from the College of Medicine, College of Motion Picture Arts, College of Fine Arts, College of Communication & Information, College of Law, College of Nursing, College of Criminology & Criminal Justice, College of Social Work, and College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nCerio, who has had a distinguished career in both private practice and public service, highlighted the significance of civil discourse in today’s society and shared personal anecdotes to inspire the graduates as they embark on their future endeavors.\n\nCerio, who serves on the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System of Florida, humorously recounted a teasing conversation with his daughter, Grace, who was among the graduates, saying, “I only asked her if she’d mind if I sat up here on the dais to see her walk across the stage. With a smile, she said sarcastically: ‘Sure, Dad. I mean, I’m the one who’s graduating, but let’s see if you can find a way to make it all about you.’ We both laughed, but now that she’s realized I’m tonight’s commencement speaker, I’d like to take a moment to say to her – yes, Grace, I can, in fact, make it all about me.” The audience laughed at the good-natured family ribbing and applauded both proud father and graduate.\n\nCerio, who has served as general counsel to the governor of Florida and as a member of the Florida Constitution Revision Commission and the Judicial Nominating Committee, praised FSU’s recent accomplishments, noting its rise in national rankings and the increasing value of an FSU degree.\n\n“It’s getting harder and harder to get into Florida State. It’s a little scary if you’re an applicant, but for all of you, that means your degrees are becoming more and more valuable,” he said.\n\nThe core of Cerio’s speech centered around the importance of civil discourse, a topic he passionately believes is critical for the future of the country. He commended President McCullough for his leadership and his handling of a challenging free speech issue on campus, which highlighted the importance of engaging in civil dialogue.\n\n“Rick was a model of a diplomatic leader, and he deescalated the situation by explaining to these groups that they certainly had the freedom to disagree, but they should do so adhering to the principles of civil discourse as they exercised their right to free speech,” Cerio said.\n\nHe emphasized that the ability to engage in civil discourse is essential not only in academia but also in everyday interactions and professional settings.\n\n“Your words, even if you express disagreement, can be disarming, and deescalating, and build relationships, and contribute to a solid personal and professional reputation, or they can set a situation on absolute fire and harm your reputation,” Cerio told the graduates.\n\nHe also reflected on the broader implications of civil discourse for society and warned against the dangers of vilifying those with differing opinions.\n\n“We head down a dark and dangerous path when we begin to believe that those who hold opinions different than ours are inherently worth less as individuals than those who share our opinions and ideals,” he said. “History is replete with examples of countries who strayed down this path, and their citizens paid a terrible price.”"
