        "text": "August 17, 2024\n\nThis is it. The Race of All Races. Where it all began.\n\nIn 1983, 45 tough-minded runners braved 100 miles of high-altitude, extreme Rocky Mountain terrain — starting at 10,200 feet, climbing to 12,600 feet and running into global endurance history. Today, the Life Time Leadville Trail 100 RUN presented by La Sportiva is one of the oldest, most storied endurance running events in the world — with not one, but two climbs on the crux of the course: Hope Pass (12,600 feet). Every year, a select handful of gritty, gutsy and determined runners make the pilgrimage to Cloud City to Race Across the Sky and take their shot at etching their name among the Leadville Legendary. The red carpet awaits.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe “Race Across the Sky” was first held in 1983 and was created by Ken Chlouber, a local miner who wanted to bring attention to the town of Leadville after the closure of the Climax Mine. It has since become one of the most iconic ultramarathons in the world. Over the years, the Leadville Trail 100 Run has attracted top athletes from around the globe as they come to Leadville for the ultimate test of Grit, Guts and Determination, on their quest for the coveted silver and gold beltbuckle.\n\nWATCH\n\nIn 2023, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the legendary Leadville Trail 100 Run. Join us as we dive into the heart of this iconic race, bridging the gap between its storied history and the present, all through the incredible journeys of four dedicated runners at the 2023 event.\n\nRace Across the Sky Expo\n\nHead to downtown Leadville for the free, outdoor, open-to-the-public Race Across the Sky Expo. While you check-in and pick up your swag bag, you can give your friends and family a taste of that Cloud City magic. From free swag and bike demos to live podcasts and beer tents, the Expo offers the perfect complement to two of the most prestigious endurance events on the planet.\n\nCOURSE\n\nThe LT100 Run course is a brutal out-and-back ultramarathon that will push even the toughest runners to their limits.The course starts and finishes in Leadville, but the true challenge is the rugged and unrelenting terrain along the way. The course includes steep climbs of Powerline, high-altitude passes like Sugarloaf, and technical terrain on the Colorado Trail, all amounting to over 18,000 feet of elevation gain. The course reaches a peak elevation of 12,600 feet above sea level on the crux of the course, Hope Pass, where runners will gasp for breath and question their sanity. The LT100 Run race course is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are up to the challenge, it is an unforgettable experience.\n\n2024 EVENT SCHEDULE:\n\nTHURSDAY, AUGUST 15th 2024\n\n5:00 pm – LT100 Legacy Foundation Hope Pass Dinner + Benefit\n\nFor 200 guests, we’ll roll out the Red Carpet for a night of celebration with food, live music, special guests, and libations. 100% of the proceeds for ticket sales go to benefit the Leadville Trail 100 Legacy Foundation and the Life Time Foundation.\n\nSignup for the Benefit Dinner\n\n7:00pm-8:00pm – Premiere of Ultra – The Long Run Documentary – Episode II The Leadville Trail 100\n\nLocation: The historic Tabor Opera House\n\nAn exploration of ultramarathons, the runners who attempt them, and the philosophy of going into the deep end.
