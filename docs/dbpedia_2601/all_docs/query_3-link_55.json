        "text": "Have you ever thought about your own thoughts or questioned your mental processes?\n\nDo you sometimes take time to clarify your values in a moment of doubt or uncertainty?\n\nIf you answered “yes,” you are no stranger to self-reflection and introspection (terms that will be used more or less interchangeably in this article), an important psychological exercise that can help you grow, develop your mind, and extract value from your mistakes.\n\nRead on if you’d like to learn the meaning of self-reflection and introspection, reasons why it’s important, and tools and techniques for practicing it yourself.\n\nBefore you continue, we thought you might like to download our three Self-Compassion Exercises for free. These detailed, science-based exercises will not only help you increase the compassion and kindness you show yourself but will also give you the tools to help your clients, students, or employees show more compassion to themselves.\n\nWhat Is Introspection? A Definition\n\nIntrospection can be practiced both as an informal reflection process and a formal experimental approach, and the two have different definitions. Still, both processes can be undertaken by anyone with curiosity and determination (Cherry, 2016).\n\nThe informal reflection process can be defined as examining one’s own internal thoughts and feelings and reflecting on what they mean. The process can be focused on either one’s current mental experience or mental experiences from the very recent past.\n\nThe formal experimental technique is a more objective and standardized version of this, in which people train themselves to carefully analyze the contents of their own thoughts in a way that’s as unbiased as possible.\n\nThe original idea of introspection was developed by Wilhelm Wundt in the late 1800s (McLeod, 2008). Wundt focused on three areas of mental functioning: thoughts, images, and feelings. Wundt’s work eventually led to the current work on perceptual processes and the establishment of the field of cognitive psychology.\n\nWhat Is the Importance of Introspection?\n\nSo, why is introspection important?\n\nResearchers have shown that we think more than 50,000 thoughts per day, of which more than half are negative and more than 90% are just repeats from the day before (Wood, 2013).\n\nIf you don’t make the time and effort to refocus your mind on the positive through introspection, you won’t give yourself the opportunity to grow and develop.\n\nEnhancing our ability to understand ourselves and our motivations and to learn more about our own values helps us take the power away from the distractions of our modern, fast-paced lives and instead refocus on fulfillment (Wood, 2013).\n\nThe importance of doing it right\n\nReflecting on ourselves and our environments is a healthy and adaptive practice, but it should be undertaken with some care—there is, in fact, a wrong way to do it.\n\nWhen your focus on introspection has morphed from a dedication to an obsession, you have taken it too far. In fact, those who take self-reflection too far can end up feeling more stressed, depressed, and anxious than ever (Eurich, 2017).\n\nIn addition, it is all too easy for us to fool ourselves into thinking we have found some deep insight that may or may not be accurate. We are surprisingly good at coming up with rational explanations for the irrational behaviors we engage in (Dahl, 2017).\n\nTo help stay on the right path with your self-reflection, consider asking more “what” questions than “why” questions. “Why” questions can highlight our limitations and stir up negative emotions, while “what” questions help keep us curious and positive about the future (Eurich, 2017).\n\nWith this important point in mind, let’s move on to the questions, exercises, and worksheets that you can use to work on your own self-reflection.\n\n70 Self-Reflective Questions to Ask Yourself\n\nThere are nearly endless questions, prompts, and ideas you can use to take a self-reflection break. Some of these can be asked, answered, and addressed every day, while others may best be saved for occasional self-reflection.\n\nRead through the following three lists to get some ideas for introspective questions. Answering them can take you from feeling like you don’t understand yourself to knowing yourself like the back of your hand.\n\nThese 10 questions are great ways to jumpstart self-reflection (Woronko, n.d.):\n\nAm I using my time wisely?\n\nAm I taking anything for granted?\n\nAm I employing a healthy perspective?\n\nAm I living true to myself?\n\nAm I waking up in the morning ready to take on the day?\n\nAm I thinking negative thoughts before I fall asleep?\n\nAm I putting enough effort into my relationships?\n\nAm I taking care of myself physically?\n\nAm I letting matters that are out of my control stress me out?\n\nAm I achieving the goals that I’ve set for myself?\n\nThe following 30 questions are questions you can ask yourself every day to get to know yourself better (William, n.d.):\n\nWho am I, really?\n\nWhat worries me most about the future?\n\nIf this were the last day of my life, would I have the same plans for today?\n\nWhat am I really scared of?\n\nAm I holding on to something I need to let go of?\n\nIf not now, then when?\n\nWhat matters most in my life?\n\nWhat am I doing about the things that matter most in my life?\n\nWhy do I matter?\n\nHave I done anything lately that’s worth remembering?\n\nHave I made someone smile today?\n\nWhat have I given up on?\n\nWhen did I last push the boundaries of my comfort zone?\n\nIf I had to instill one piece of advice in a newborn baby, what advice would I give?\n\nWhat small act of kindness was I once shown that I will never forget?\n\nHow will I live, knowing I will die?\n\nWhat do I need to change about myself?\n\nIs it more important to love or be loved?\n\nHow many of my friends would I trust with my life?\n\nWho has had the greatest impact on my life?\n\nWould I break the law to save a loved one?\n\nWould I steal to feed a starving child?\n\nWhat do I want most in life?\n\nWhat is life asking of me?\n\nWhich is worse: failing or never trying?\n\nIf I try to fail and succeed, what have I done?\n\nWhat’s the one thing I’d like others to remember about me at the end of my life?\n\nDoes it really matter what others think about me?\n\nTo what degree have I actually controlled the course of my life?\n\nWhen all is said and done, what will I have said more than I’ve done?\n\nFinally, the following 30 prompts and questions are great ways to put your journal to use (Tartakovsky, 2014):\n\nMy favorite way to spend the day is . . .\n\nIf I could talk to my teenage self, the one thing I would say is . . .\n\nThe two moments I’ll never forget in my life are . . .

They’re simple and easy to do, but they can familiarize you with the process for more in-depth reflection in the future.\n\nSelf-Examination Exercise 1\n\nConsider whether or not you tend to analyze people or diagnose their problems for them without their encouragement or request.\n\nOften when we hold information that has helped us to make sense of the world, we want to share it. This information, when unprompted and delivered to another person, sometimes doesn’t feel so good. They may feel like you are telling them that something about them is wrong, something that they might not necessarily agree with.\n\nRemind yourself that this information needs to be asked for and not prescribed by you, no matter how valid it feels to pass it on (Bates, 2012).\n\nSelf-Examination Exercise 2\n\nThis is a good exercise if you tend to expend a lot of energy trying to understand what upsets you about another person’s actions. You may also spend a lot of energy thinking of ways to address that person about what upsets you.\n\nNot only does this burn a lot of your energy, but it also can have an unintended effect on the person who has upset you. When you place a clear emphasis or focus on what is wrong when speaking with someone, it implies that you are dissatisfied and unhappy.\n\nUsually, the issue you have is not something that is making you terribly unhappy, just an annoyance or irritation, so this doom and gloom is not the message you want to deliver. It’s just a single issue that needs attention, but it can seem much bigger and more pervasive to the person you are planning to discuss it with.\n\nTry to remind yourself that this problem, no matter how valid an issue it is or how important it is to you, is not the whole of your feelings. When you deliver this information, remember that a person who loves you does not want to be the cause of your unhappiness—do not make them feel an unnecessary amount of pain as a result of the unhappiness they’ve caused you.\n\nKeep your focus on the big picture when you bring up issues, or you risk turning a small issue into a much broader problem (Bates, 2012).\n\nDownload 3 Free Self-Compassion Exercises (PDF)\n\nThese detailed, science-based exercises will equip you to help others create a kinder and more nurturing relationship with themselves.\n\nDownload PDF\n\nSelf-Examination Exercise 3\n\nDo you frequently interrupt people or constantly think of your own stories to share while they are talking? If you’re like a lot of social people, the answer is probably yes.\n\nIn order to relate to others, we have to share a little bit of ourselves with them—your stories can help you establish common ground with others or make you closer with them. However, if you’re only focused on sharing your stories, it can distract you from the greater purpose of a conversation.\n\nIn our eagerness to relate, please, entertain, and share, we often remove ourselves from the present, reducing our ability to be sensitive and engaged listeners. Even if we spend our whole lives trying to be good listeners, sometimes we slip out of practice in empathizing or identifying with the person we’re talking to, or we lose an opportunity to comfort or entertain the other person.\n\nNext time you have a conversation with a loved one and you find yourself thinking ahead of them, take a moment to pause and truly listen. Don’t think about how you can personally identify with what they are talking about, and don’t search your memory bank for a relevant story of your own—just listen.\n\nIt’s a rewarding experience to truly soak in what another person is saying, both for you and the other person (Bates, 2012).\n\nSelf-Examination Exercise 4\n\nSometimes when we work very hard to do good things, we get to a level of comfort with that fact, and we begin to talk about it to others. That can be a great thing in that it allows us to own our efforts and our actions and, with that, acknowledge our goodness to ourselves.\n\nBut for this exercise, consider how you might feel if you were to do things that are good, but only for your own knowledge. The next time you do something really wonderful, try keeping that wonderful thing to yourself and not sharing it with anyone.\n\nOften when a person is good and loving, they don’t have to tell anyone; it’s a truth that shines from every angle of their person. As an experiment, keep some knowledge to yourself, as a gift to you (Bates, 2012).\n\nSelf-Examination Exercise 5\n\nFor this exercise, you need only to do one thing: Consider what you don’t know.\n\nWhen we get to a place of comfort in our skin and in the world, we tend to lose the ability to see things from a different perspective. Things make sense to us in our own point of view, so what’s left to know?\n\nEverything, it turns out.\n\nBy this, we mean to try and remind yourself of these facts: You cannot know or understand everything, and you are not the judge of what is right for another person.\n\nYou can neither read minds nor know what the future holds. You can only exist in one moment at a time, and you are changing every day.\n\nTrust that sometimes others know themselves and their lives better than you ever could. Listen with the awareness that you might learn something new.\n\nBe open to the fact that you might one day feel totally different about something that you believe to be fixed—and that includes your sticking points, the “unchangeables” you thought were forever set in stone. Let what you don’t know and can’t know be a comfort rather than something to fear, because it means that anything is possible (Bates, 2012).\n\nOnce you have found your footing with these self-examination exercises, the following introspective exercises are a great next step.\n\nAffirmations\n\nCreating affirmations is a helpful way to clear your mind and put things in perspective. Affirmations can be defined as positive phrases or statements used to challenge negative or unhelpful thoughts.\n\nFor this exercise, write a list of at least 50 affirmations. They should address what you want to embrace, improve, and achieve in your life.\n\nFollow these instructions when composing and practicing your affirmations:\n\nWrite the affirmations in the present tense and be sure to use the word “I” throughout the affirmations;\n\nFocus on the things that are occurring now that will lead to your future success. You may have negative thoughts pop up, but do your best to let go of the negative thoughts and replace them with positive thinking;\n\nRepeat your affirmations aloud to help reprogram your mind with more positive thoughts.\n\nFollowing these steps can help you open yourself up to the positive in your life and take steps that will lead you to the future you want (Holothink, n.d.).\n\nSubconscious Mind Exercise\n\nIn this exercise, you will dive into your subconscious. Don’t worry, it’s not as painful or scary as it sounds!\n\nYour subconscious mind is where your self-image is stored. All of your attitudes, experiences, beliefs, and values are stored deep in your subconscious, driving your behavior and forming the core of who you are.\n\nWe don’t often take time to think about ourselves on this level. So in this exercise, take some time and put a concerted effort into thinking about your attitudes, experiences, beliefs, and values. It may take a few sessions of self-reflection to really uncover your core beliefs, but it’s worth the effort it takes to learn about yourself.\n\nReflecting on this core component of yourself will help you gain greater self-awareness. Much like meditation, it will help you achieve a new, higher level of consciousness, and it may just help you find valuable information and answers about yourself and your beliefs (Holothink, n.d.).\n\nVisualization Exercise\n\nThis exercise offers you an opportunity to put your creativity to use.\n\nCreate a box, a vision board, or some other medium to store and display who you are and what your hopes and dreams are for the future. You can create or decorate your box or board however you’d like. Use whatever you feel represents yourself and what’s important to you.\n\nPlace pictures, words, drawings, poems, or small items of personal significance on your board or in your box. The more details you include, the better.\n\nThe end result is a visual representation of yourself and what you love. Come back to the box or board when you’re having a dilemma or trying to figure out the best course of action, and draw from this visual representation of yourself to help you make decisions (Holothink, n.d.).\n\nFor this exercise, feel free to put your imagination to good use—the sky’s the limit when it comes to visualization.\n\nQuestions About Yourself\n\nThis exercise is simple, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. All you need to do is ask yourself some questions.\n\nAsk yourself questions about yourself. Write down the questions, then write down your answers to the questions. Ask yourself about your past, present, and future, and compose answers to the questions that are positive, insightful, and motivating to you.\n\nDon’t worry about coming up with the “right” answers—there aren’t any right answers, and your answers will likely change over time. And be as creative as you’d like with the questions and answers since no one else needs to answer or read them but you.\n\nBe sure to structure your questions to include details about your hopes and dreams. The more detailed your questions and answers, the more opportunity you have to dig into some valuable self-reflection (Holothink, n.d.).\n\nWrite and Reflect\n\nJournaling is great for many reasons, and it can be used in several applications for introspection.\n\nFor this exercise, get a journal, diary, or notebook with plenty of pages to write in.\n\nEvery day, write down three things in your journal:\n\nAt least one positive thing that happened to or around you today;\n\nA question for yourself (you can use one of the questions from the previous exercise, a question from the lists we covered earlier, or something entirely new), but don’t answer it yet;\n\nA reflection on the question you wrote the previous day for yourself and an answer to it.\n\nFollowing these steps, you will write only the first two components on the first day but will write three components every day thereafter (Holothink, n.d.).\n\nWorld’s Largest Positive Psychology Resource\n\nThe Positive Psychology Toolkit© is a groundbreaking practitioner resource containing over 500 science-based exercises, activities, interventions, questionnaires, and assessments created by experts using the latest positive psychology research.\n\nUpdated monthly. 100% Science-based.\n\n“The best positive psychology resource out there!”\n\n— Emiliya Zhivotovskaya, Flourishing Center CEO\n\n4 Self-Reflection Worksheets and Tools\n\nIn addition to the questions, prompts, writing ideas, and exercises included above, here are some worksheets and tools that can help get you started with introspection.\n\nSelf-Awareness Worksheet\n\nThis worksheet is a treasure trove of exercises and ideas to help you think about yourself, including your talents, qualities, values, and perceptions.\n\nThe point of this worksheet is to help you know and understand:\n\nYour beliefs and principles;\n\nWhat you value and what is important to you;\n\nWhat motivates you;\n\nYour own emotions;\n\nYour thinking patterns;\n\nYour tendencies to react to certain situations;\n\nWhat you want out of life.\n\nThere are several sections to this worksheet, each of which has its own set of questions and prompts:\n\n– Talents\n\nWhat are your greatest talents or skills?\n\nWhich of your talents or skills gives you the greatest sense of pride or satisfaction?\n\n– Traits/Qualities\n\nWhat are your five greatest strengths?\n\nWhat do you feel are your two biggest weaknesses?\n\nWhat qualities or traits do you most admire in others?\n\n– Values\n\nWhat are ten things that are really important to you?\n\nWhat are the three most important things to you?\n\nWhat are the values that you hold nearest to your heart?\n\n– Perception\n\nHow is the “public you” different from the “private you”?\n\nWhat do you want people to think and say about you?\n\nIs it more important to be liked by others or to be yourself? Why?\n\n– Accomplishments\n\nWhat three things are you most proud of in your life to date?\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve in life?\n\nIf you could accomplish only one thing before you died, what would it be?\n\n– Reflection\n\nWhat is something that represents you (e.g., song, animal, flower, poem, symbol, jewelry, etc.)? Why?\n\nWhat three things would you like to change most about yourself?\n\nList three things that you are.\n\n– Finish the Sentence\n\nIn the final section, you will be shown several prompts to complete:\n\nI do my best when . . .\n\nI struggle when . . .\n\nI am comfortable when . . .\n\nI feel stress when . . .\n\nI am courageous when . . .\n\nOne of the most important things I learned was . . .\n\nI missed a great opportunity when . . .\n\nOne of my favorite memories is . . .\n\nMy toughest decisions involve . . .\n\nBeing myself is hard because . . .\n\nI can be myself when . . .\n\nI wish I were more . . .\n\nI wish I could . . .\n\nI wish I would regularly . . .\n\nI wish I had . . .\n\nI wish I knew . . .\n\nI wish I felt . . .\n\nI wish I saw . . .\n\nI wish I thought . . .\n\nLife should be about . . .\n\nI am going to make my life about . . .\n\nOnce you finish this worksheet, you should have plenty of insight into who you really are and what is most important to you. Use your answers to inform your decisions about what goals you choose to strive toward, what you would like to do in the future, and what moves to make next.\n\nYou can view, download, or print this worksheet for yourself.\n\nIntrospective Reflection Questions\n\nThe average human has more than 50,000 thoughts per day; more than half of them are negative, and more than 90% are just a repetition from the day before (Wood, 2013).\n\nThis means refocusing your mind on positive thoughts through introspection is essential for personal ascendance and growth. Most people take the end of the year as an opportunity to reflect on the past and set goals for the following year. However, reflections and introspection are critical at any point in time and enable your clients to grow.\n\nWilhelm Wundt developed the concept of introspection in the late 1800s (McLeod, 2008). According to him, introspection is focused on thoughts, images, and feelings. Introspective questions are often used in the field of cognitive psychology.\n\nUnderstanding your clients allows you to learn more about their values, internal thoughts, and feelings. Furthermore, it takes the focus away from fast-paced lives and allows your client to be in the present moment and refocus on fulfillment (Wood, 2013).\n\nBesides asking your client reflective questions, another tip is to practice active listening. Being able to stay entirely in the present moment without interruption or projecting your own story onto someone is key to helping your clients flourish. When the urge to share your story arises, pause and take the time to listen.\n\nTool 1: Persona\n\nBefore moving on to the empathy map below, first create a “persona,” or a clear character representation of your actual self, your ideal self, and your “ought” self (Kos, n.d.).\n\nIn order to create this persona, you will need to thoroughly analyze who you are, who you want to become, and what the social expectations connected to your feelings and behaviors are like in different situations.\n\nAnswering questions like the following can help you define these three important selves:\n\nWhy do I want to become [enter a characteristic important to you]? Who in my life was or is like that?\n\nWho would I be proud if I were [enter a characteristic important to you]? Why?\n\nHow are my feelings in certain situations connected with my actual, ideal, and ought self?\n\nAm I pushing myself to be something I’m actually not?\n\nAm I being something I’m not just because others expect it of me?\n\nUse your answers to these questions to help you get an idea of who you are, who you want to be, and who you feel you ought to be. Once this preparation has been completed, move on to creating an empathy map.\n\nTool 2: Empathy Map\n\nAn empathy map can help you engage in a valuable and informative process of self-reflection, using all of your senses to help you identify your needs and the disconnections between what you say and what you do (Kos, n.d.). Don’t worry—we all have a disconnect between what we say and what we do.\n\nThis exercise can help you figure out where you have these disconnects and how you can best address them to become the person you want to be.\n\nTo create your empathy map, simply draw four quadrants on a piece of paper. Each quadrant represents a different aspect of yourself:\n\nSeeing;\n\nDoing;\n\nThinking;\n\nFeeling.\n\nNext, consider a situation that evokes a specific strong emotion in you, like having a fight with your spouse or significant other. In each quadrant, write down the relevant aspects of each perspective.\n\nFor example, for the fight scenario, you could write down something like the following:\n\nSeeing: What are some of the things you saw during the situation?\n\nDoing: What actions did you do and which behaviors did you notice in yourself? What is the behavioral pattern you can identify?\n\nThinking: What were you thinking in that situation? What does this tell you about your beliefs?\n\nFeeling: What emotions were you feeling? Why? Which past situation do they most remind you of?\n\nOn the backside of your piece of paper, on another piece of paper, or next to your four quadrants, create a fifth section. Here, you will write down your insights and ideas based on your empathy map.\n\nThe following questions can help you with the self-reflection process while you’re working on your map:\n\nHow is the situation connected to your fears and hopes? What are your fears? What are your hopes? Which of your needs are met or not met in that situation?\n\nWhat was the environment in which you encountered the situation? What do you remember from the environment? How did you find yourself in that environment and why? What was your sight focused on?\n\nWhat hurts you most in the situation or makes you feel good about the situation?\n\nWhat was the feedback you gathered from your environment or other people?\n\nWhat are all the positives about the situation? What can you learn about yourself, others, and the world by experiencing that kind of a situation?\n\nDo your best to avoid falling prey to cognitive distortions or reinforcing negative feelings while answering these questions. Go deep, and identify why you feel like you do. Observe, but don’t judge (Kos, n.d.).\n\nTool 3: Life Satisfaction Chart\n\nA life satisfaction chart is a great way to assess how well you are meeting your goals and furthering your hopes for the future. You can complete this chart periodically to track your progress toward your goals and see what needs to be revised, improved, reduced, or eliminated to help you strive toward them.\n\nDraw a scale from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied) horizontally, and list the following ten areas of life vertically:\n\nYou;\n\nHealth;\n\nRelationships;\n\nMoney;\n\nCareer;\n\nEmotions;\n\nCompetencies;\n\nFun;\n\nSpirituality;\n\nTechnology.\n\nAssess your satisfaction in each of the 10 areas using the scale you created.\n\nNext, take a second look at all the areas where you are only somewhat satisfied (where you used a rating between 4 and 7). It can be hard to effectively reflect when you don’t have a clear idea of whether you are satisfied with a specific area or not.\n\nGo back through these “somewhat satisfied” areas and rate your satisfaction again, but use only ratings between 1 and 3 or 8 and 10. Limiting your options to either “very satisfied” or “not very satisfied” will help you to make a more decisive judgment about your satisfaction in each area.\n\nHighlight every section rated with a 1, 2, or 3 with red, and highlight every section rated with an 8, 9, or 10 with green. Finally, for all ten areas of life, ask yourself, Why did you rate each area how you did? What would make you change your rating?\n\nRepeat this exercise as often as you’d like to help you keep track of your satisfaction with the way your life is going (Kos, n.d.).\n\n17 Exercises To Foster Self-Acceptance and Compassion\n\nHelp your clients develop a kinder, more accepting relationship with themselves using these 17 Self-Compassion Exercises [PDF] that promote self-care and self-compassion.\n\nCreated by Experts. 100% Science-based.\n\nThe 3 Best Books on Self-Reflection and Introspection\n\nThere are many books out there on self-reflection, self-awareness, and introspection, but we recommend the books below as resources to help you start your journey.\n\n1. Question Your Life: Naikan Self-Reflection and the Transformation of Our Stories – Gregg Krech\n\nThis book will introduce the reader to Naikan, a method of quiet self-reflection that originated in Japan.\n\nLike the physical bags we carry when we go on a journey, our hearts and our minds only have so much room—but instead of carrying luggage, they carry stories. Some stories inform our lives and help us understand ourselves, while others don’t serve a purpose and can weigh us down.\n\nIn this book, Krech will guide the reader through several powerful examples of people who had an important change of heart or mind as a result of quiet self-reflection, including a woman who hated her mother, a man estranged from his father, a pregnant woman hit by a train, a couple who was struggling with their marriage, and a rabbi who neglected his shoes.\n\nRead this book to open yourself up to seeing the world differently, and finding a better path forward.\n\nYou can find it on Amazon.\n\n2. Being Present: A Book of Daily Reflections – David Kundtz\n\nThis simple book will help the reader create a life that is more peaceful, rewarding, and awakened.\n\nBeing present can be defined as:\n\nPaying full attention to what is going on right now;\n\nStaying in the moment;\n\nObserving what is, without criticism or judgment;\n\nHaving a balanced concern for things exactly as they are;\n\nAccepting whatever experience one is having;\n\nHaving an awake participation in ongoing life.\n\nYou can use this book as a reminder to be more present through every season of the year and every season of life. The book draws inspiration from poets, scientists, spiritual teachers, children, butterflies, and big cities, and teaches you to accept each day as one full of possibilities and potential surprises.\n\nYou can find it on Amazon.\n\n3. 52 Weeks of Self Reflection – Erika R. Dawkins\n\nThis simple but powerful book will guide the reader through a full year of self-reflection through writing. Each week, the book will introduce you to a new topic that you will either reflect on immediately or incorporate into your life and reflect on at the end of the week.\n\nYou can use this book to guide you through self-reflection. No matter your goal, this guidebook will help you clear your head, see the world from a new perspective, and build a greater understanding of yourself.\n\nYou can find it on Amazon.\n\nA Take-Home Message\n\nIn this piece, we defined introspection, described the importance of self-reflection (especially healthy self-reflection), and provided many example exercises, activities, and worksheets for you to enhance your understanding of yourself.\n\nKeep in mind that self-reflection is an intensely personal process. If you find other activities that work better for you, feel free to focus on those—but we’d love for you to come back here and share with us what works.\n\nDo you have any other techniques for self-reflection that you like to use? How important do you think introspection is for the average person, or for yourself? Let us know in the comments."
