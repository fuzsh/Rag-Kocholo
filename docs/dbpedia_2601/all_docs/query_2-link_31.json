        "text": "The Morning News:\n\nYour paintings seem to suspend time, but the distance isn’t cold. What is it about the bird’s-eye view that you enjoy perceiving?\n\nYvonne Jacquette:\n\nCuriosity about how perspective reveals man-made structures and their relationship to “nature.” I like how the canvas plane is like the picture plane.\n\nTMN:\n\nWhat do you admire in a good architect?\n\nYJ:\n\nSurprises, beautiful proportions, meanings for human life.\n\nTMN:\n\nWhat are your favorite aspects of airports?\n\nYJ:\n\nFavorite aspects of airports exist only in small airports. Larger airports are full of unsettling chaos, including terrible food.\n\nTMN:\n\nWhat’s the last piece of art you saw, by another artist, that disoriented or confused you?\n\nYJ:\n\nAstrid Bowlby’s “Sneaky Peanuts,” a panel, eight inches square, with white cat hair and bubble gum attached in swirls.\n\nTMN:\n\nWhat is a typical work day like?\n\nYJ:\n\nA typical work day once a pastel study is made: blowing up image, questioning every mark.\n\nTMN:\n\nAfter you’ve painted a place, which do you remember better, the original place or the painting?\n\nYJ:\n\nThe painting erases the memory of the place."
