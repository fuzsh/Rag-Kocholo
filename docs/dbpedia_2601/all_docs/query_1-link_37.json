        "text": "In 2021, the global average life expectancy was just over 70 years. This is an astonishing fact – because just two hundred years ago, it was less than half.\n\nThis was the case for all world regions: in 1800, no region had a life expectancy higher than 40 years.\n\nThe average life expectancy has risen steadily and significantly across all regions.1\n\nThis extraordinary rise is the result of a wide range of advances in health – in nutrition, clean water, sanitation, neonatal healthcare, antibiotics, vaccines, and other technologies and public health efforts – and improvements in living standards, economic growth, and poverty reduction.\n\nIn this article, we cover this in more detail:\n\nTwice as long – life expectancy around the world\n\nLife expectancy has doubled over the last two centuries around the world. How has this happened?\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nPeriod life expectancy is a metric that summarizes death rates across all age groups in one particular year.\n\nFor a given year, it represents the average lifespan for a hypothetical group of people, if they experienced the same age-specific death rates throughout their whole lives as the age-specific death rates seen in that particular year.\n\nThis data is compiled from three sources: the United Nations’ World Population Prospects (UN WPP), Zijdeman et al. (2015)2, and Riley (2005)3. For data points before 1950, we use Human Mortality Database data4 combined with Zijdeman (2015). From 1950 onwards, we use UN WPP data. For pre-1950 data on world regions and the world as a whole, we use estimates from Riley (2005).\n\nRiley (2005)3 compiles life expectancy estimates from hundreds of historical sources and calculates the average of estimates that met an acceptable quality threshold, such as having estimates for entire nations or regions. Less historical data is available from the pre-health transition period in countries – this is especially the case for Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the former Soviet Union.\n\nZijdeman et al. (2015)2 compiles data from various sources: the OECD.Stat database library, the United Nations World Population Prospects Database (UN WPP), the Human Mortality Database (HMD), the Montevideo-Oxford Latin American Economic History Database (MOxLAD), and Gapminder. In some cases, regional databases are used, such as Wrigley et al. (1997)5 for life expectancy in England in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries; the ONS for Australia; Kannisto et al. (1999)6 for Finland; and data from the Estonian Interuniversity Population Research Centre for Estonia.\n\nThe UN WPP estimates life expectancy in various countries using data on mortality rates. In poorer countries, where death registration data is often lacking, the underlying data often comes from national household surveys, which are then used to estimate mortality rates and life expectancy.\n\nIn 2021, Nigeria's life expectancy was thirty years lower than Japan’s.\n\nThis striking fact reflects the wide differences in life expectancy between countries, which you can see on the map.\n\nThese wide differences are also reflected within countries. Countries with a lower average life expectancy also tend to have wider variations in lifespans.7\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nPeriod life expectancy is a metric that summarizes death rates across all age groups in one particular year.\n\nFor a given year, it represents the average lifespan for a hypothetical group of people, if they experienced the same age-specific death rates throughout their whole lives as the age-specific death rates seen in that particular year.\n\nThis data is compiled from two sources: the Human Mortality Database (HMD)4 and the United Nations World Population Prospects Database (UN WPP). For data points before 1950, we use HMD data. From 1950 onwards, we use UN WPP data.\n\nThe Human Mortality Database prioritizes uniformity in methods and is limited to specific countries and periods where high-quality mortality data is available nationally.\n\nThe UN WPP estimates life expectancy in various countries through various methods, using data on mortality rates. In poorer countries, where death registration data is often lacking, the underlying data often comes from national household surveys, which are then used to estimate mortality rates and life expectancy.\n\nIt’s a common misconception that life expectancy has only increased because of declines in child mortality.\n\nThis is part of what happened. Child mortality used to be high and contributed significantly to short lifespans in the past, and it has declined greatly over time.\n\nBut, especially in recent decades, child mortality declines have contributed much less to increasing life expectancy8, and large declines in mortality are seen across all age groups.\n\nYou can see this in the chart. It shows the total life expectancy for people who have already survived to older ages.\n\nFor example, 15-year-olds in 1816 in France had a life expectancy of 58 years. By 2021, the life expectancy of 15-year-olds increased to 83.\n\nThese gains are also seen at older ages: someone who was 65 years old in 1816 would have a life expectancy of 76 years. By 2021, their life expectancy would be 86 years.\n\nIn this article, we cover this in more detail:\n\nIt’s not just about child mortality, life expectancy increased at all ages\n\nIt’s often argued that life expectancy across the world has only increased because child mortality has fallen. But this is untrue. The data shows that life expectancy has increased at all ages.\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nPeriod life expectancy is a metric that summarizes death rates across all age groups in one particular year.\n\nFor a given year, it represents the average lifespan for a hypothetical group of people, if they experienced the same age-specific death rates throughout their whole lives as the age-specific death rates seen in that particular year.\n\nThis data is compiled from three sources: the United Nations’ World Population Prospects (UN WPP), Zijdeman et al.

In poorer countries, where death registration data is often lacking, the underlying data often comes from national household surveys, which are then used to estimate mortality rates and life expectancy.\n\nAcross the world, women tend to live longer than men.\n\nBut the gender gap varies between countries and is not constant over time, as you can see in the chart.\n\nFor example, the gap spiked in some countries during the World Wars.\n\nBut wars are only one of many reasons for the sex gap in life expectancy, which arises from a range of causes at different ages.9\n\nThe gap begins at birth: newborn boys have a higher death rate than newborn girls, as they’re more vulnerable to diseases.10\n\nIt continues in youth, when boys have a higher death rate than girls, typically due to violence and accidents. It’s sustained at older ages when men have higher death rates than women from chronic health conditions, which are partly due to higher rates of smoking, alcohol, and drug use.11\n\nThe chart shows how the sex gap in life expectancy widened gradually over the twentieth century, largely because of the rise in smoking, especially among men.12 Since then, it has been narrowing again in many but not all countries.13\n\nIn this article, we cover this in more detail:\n\nWhy do women live longer than men?\n\nWomen tend to live longer than men in all countries — but the sex gap in life expectancy is not a constant.\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nPeriod life expectancy is a metric that summarizes death rates across all age groups in one particular year.\n\nFor a given year, it represents the average lifespan for a hypothetical group of people, if they experienced the same age-specific death rates throughout their whole lives as the age-specific death rates seen in that particular year.\n\nThis data is compiled from two sources: the Human Mortality Database (HMD)4 and the United Nations World Population Prospects Database (UN WPP).

In poorer countries, where death registration data is often lacking, the underlying data often comes from national household surveys, which are then used to estimate mortality rates and life expectancy.\n\nThe chart shows which country had the highest recorded female life expectancy in each year. It comes from a study by Jim Oeppen and James W Vaupel.14\n\nThe first dot shows Sweden’s life expectancy of 46 in 1840, the highest of any country that year. Over time, the record was pushed higher and higher.\n\nBut is there a limit to life expectancy?\n\nIn 1928, an American statistician, Louis Dublin, used mortality data to predict the longest possible life expectancy that could be achieved. Life expectancy in the US was 57 years at the time, and his answer for the maximum was 64.8 years.15 Because he lacked data from New Zealand, he was unaware that the limit had already been broken there.\n\nThe horizontal lines on the chart show many predictions of the maximum limit of life expectancy. As you can see, the predictions have been broken again and again.\n\nRather than slowing down, record life expectancy has risen steadily over time, by around one year every four years. By 2021, Hong Kong had the highest life expectancy of 88 years.\n\nThe authors, Oeppen and Vaupel, explain that improvements in life expectancy shouldn’t be thought of as the result of one-off breakthroughs but instead “a regular stream of continuing progress”.\n\nIn this article, we cover this in more detail:\n\nThe rise of maximum life expectancy\n\nPredictions of a maximum limit of life expectancy have been broken again and again.\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nPeriod life expectancy is a metric that summarizes death rates across all age groups in one particular year.\n\nFor a given year, it represents the average lifespan for a hypothetical group of people, if they experienced the same age-specific death rates throughout their whole lives as the age-specific death rates seen in that particular year.\n\nThe chart comes from a 2002 study by Jim Oeppen and James W Vaupel.14\n\nRecords from recent years have been added to the chart.\n\nAn interactive version of this chart can be found online."
