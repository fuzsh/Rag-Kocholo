        "text": "On a Sunday morning in early November, as Robert Hammond was taking one of his last official walks along the High Line, the urban park he helped develop 14 years ago, he was approached by a tall, well-dressed man who seemed to recognize him.\n\n“You are the creator of this?” asked the man, who introduced himself as Philip Letts and explained that he was working on a development project in Bogotá, Colombia. “May I bother you for a photograph?”\n\nAfter a quick photo, Mr. Letts asked Mr. Hammond for his card, and continued on his stroll.\n\nA reporter asked Mr. Hammond if this kind of thing happens a lot. “It happens,” he said with a slightly embarrassed shrug, quickly deflecting to the next subject.\n\nIn February, Mr. Hammond, 44, president and executive director of Friends of the High Line, a nonprofit organization he was the co-founder of in 1999 with Joshua David, announced he would depart at year’s end, now just a few weeks away. In January, he plans to go to Rishikesh, India, for a three-month meditation retreat.\n\nHe does not have a next act. “Everyone keeps asking me, and I don’t have a plan,” Mr. Hammond said.\n\nIn 1999, Mr. Hammond met Mr. David at a community board meeting on the future of the High Line and discovered a shared interest in preserving it. The two put together a pie-in-the-sky organization to reclaim the space of the abandoned elevated railway. One wag described their endeavor as “two guys and a logo.”\n\nThey connected with kindred spirits via Yahoo eGroups and embarked on an odyssey through the complexities of railroad and zoning laws, economic feasibility studies, public and private fund-raising and, finally, a complex and extensive construction project. The first segment of the High Line opened in June 2009.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
