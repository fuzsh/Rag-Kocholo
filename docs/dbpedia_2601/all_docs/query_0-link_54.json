        "text": "Left to right: Duke Ellington (1954), Miles Davis (1955), Louis Armstrong (1955). Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn the fall of 2019, I profiled my jazz LP collection (see October / November blogs) and in the summer of 2022, my jazz CD collection (see May / June / July blogs).\n\n​Hence, it is only logical and reasonable that I do the same for my music book collection: 709 books strong, with 441 jazz books and 268 non-jazz books (pop, rock, Broadway, other).\n\nHere I present the jazz books, the first of which I purchased in 1965, and the bulk of them I acquired during the 1970–2000 time frame. My acquisition strategy, I hasten to add, was not based on any predetermined notion that focused on, for example, a specific jazz artist or style. Nope, if it was a jazz book, I bought it, pure and simple.\n\nTo convey a sense of my overall jazz collection, I list books below in several categories. For the most part, these books center on the life and music of the titular artist, as opposed to a period in jazz (like the ’30s) or a specific sub genre (like hard bop) or a region in jazz (like Kansas City).\n\nWhat three artists topped the most-books list?\n\nDuke Ellington 15\n\nMiles Davis 13\n\nLouis Armstrong 11\n\n​Not much of a surprise there. But how about those artists who played the instrument most symbolic of jazz—the saxophone?\n\n​Alto/Soprano Saxophone\n\nTenor Saxophone\n\nWomen in Jazz"
