        "meta_description": "King of Coke: Living the High Life: Directed by Chris Lent. With Felix Carapaica, Will Clubb, Liam Seamus Murphy, Alexander Plouffe. This is the true-crime story of the multimillion-dollar yuppie drug ring run by a then, twenty-six year old Larry Lavin and two of his classmates. In the high-flying 1980's, Larry Lavin was a clean-cut, Ivy-League-educated dentist living the good life in suburban Philadelphia. But, what his upper crust neighbours didn't know was that Lavin led a double life - one that would finally be exposed by a shocking narcotics investigation. Awash in sex, drugs and money, Lavin oversaw a cocaine conglomerate, buying and selling enough white powder to anesthetize thirteen Eastern seaboard states ... until the FBI cracked the ring. How was he able to create such a well-oiled network? And what brought about his untimely downfall?",
