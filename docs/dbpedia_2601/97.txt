Objectives

The Miller High Life Facebook page aims to show fans that Miller High Life isn't just a productâ€”it's a way of life. Strategically we treat High Life as a lifestyle brand with stunning, editorial-style photography and substantive content. And it's working. The High Life Facebook page has more fans with more passion for the brand than ever before.

Strategy and Execution

Our Facebook page shows our fans what it means to live the High Life. Highlighting the timeless value in our posts reminds our drinkers they're part of something bigger. The grit in our photos keeps the brand grounded in reality and accessible to everyone.

As a result, we've grown our fan base to 5x its size from 2013. And we've doubled our viral rate while increasing post performance 82%. The High Life brand transcends the product and the beer category completely. For our fans, Miller High Life is life itself.
