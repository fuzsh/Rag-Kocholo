        "text": "By BRETT MARTEL\n\nAP Sports Writer\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) – The Hornets have agreed in principle to deal Chris Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers for guard Eric Gordon, forward Al-Farouq Aminu, center Chris Kaman and a first-round draft choice, people familiar with negotiations said.\n\nESPN, citing anonymous sources, first reported the trade, which also involves New Orleans sending two future second-round draft picks to the Clippers.\n\nCommissioner David Stern approved the trade on behalf of the league-owned team, people told The Associated Press Wednesday on condition of anonymity because the NBA had not ratified the deal.\n\nThe 26-year-old Paul is a four-time All-Star who averaged 18.7 points and 9.8 assists last season, his sixth in the NBA. His move to the Clippers means he’ll now be able to make alley-oop lobs to a young star famous for dunking over a car. That would be forward Blake Griffin, who averaged 22.5 points and 12.1 rebounds last season, his first in the NBA.\n\nThe Hornets, meanwhile, get a prolific young shooting guard in Gordon, who turns 23 on Christmas Day and averaged 22.3 points last season. The 6-foot-9 Aminu is a second-year pro who averaged 5.6 points and 3.3 rebounds as a rookie.\n\nThe 7-foot Kaman, 29, is an eight-year veteran who averaged 12.4 points and seven rebounds last season."
