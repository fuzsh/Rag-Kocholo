        "text": "On Dec. 8 in 2011, then NBA Commissioner David Stern vetoed a three-team trade that would have sent Chris Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIt would have paired CP3 with Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles but it also had a lot of other moving parts. As per multiple reports at that time, here's a look at the players involved (excluding future draft picks) in the full deal between the Lakers, New Orleans Hornets and the Houston Rockets.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: PG Chris Paul (from Hornets)\n\nNew Orleans Hornets: F Lamar Odom (from Lakers), SG Kevin Martin (from Rockets), PF Luis Scola (from Rockets), PG Goran Dragic (from Rockets)\n\nHouston Rockets: PF Pau Gasol (from Lakers)\n\nDespite the public reaction to the decision, Stern was within his capacity to deny the trade as the league owned a majority stake in the Hornets. Years later, after he had stepped down as the NBA's Commissioner, Stern clarified and explained his decision.\n\n“I'm going to correct your language: What 'cancelation'? The GM [Dell Demps] was not authorized to make that trade,” Stern told Brian Berger on the Sports Business Radio Road Show. “And acting on behalf of owners, we decided not to make it. I was an owner rep. There was nothing to 'void.' It just never got made.\"\n\nA few days later, Paul was traded to the LA Clippers for Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu, Chris Kaman and the Timberwolves’ unprotected pick in 2012. That deal combined him with Blake Griffin in Los Angeles, thus, giving birth to 'Lob City'.\n\nAt the end of that ensuing lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, the Hornets were bought by the late Tom Benson, who was also the owner of the NFL's New Orleans Saints.\n\nOther notable events on Dec. 8\n\nIn 1961, Wilt Chamberlain scored 78 points – then the second-highest scoring performance in an NBA game. It came in a triple-overtime 151-147 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. 45 years later, Kobe Bryant surpassed this points tally when he exploded for 81 points against the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIn 1998, the NBA announced that the ensuing All-Star Weekend including the 49th Annual NBA All-Star Game scheduled for February 14 at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, would be cancelled. This was the first time that the annual event had been cancelled, which was due to a labour dispute between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association.\n\nIn 1999, Charles Barkley's career unofficially came to an end. It all occurred in Philadelphia when he attempted to block a shot by the Sixers’ Tyrone Hill. He tore the left quadriceps tendon away from the kneecap in the first quarter of Houston’s 83-73 loss to the 76ers. He would play a few token minutes in the final game of the season, against the Vancouver Grizzlies, which would then officially be the final game of his career.\n\nIn 2000, Shaquille O'Neal missed all of his 11 free-throw attempts against the Seattle SuperSonics. In doing so, he broke a 40-year-old record, previously held by Wilt Chamberlain (10), for the most free throw attempts without a make in a game.\n\nIn 2011, the 161-day lockout between the NBA and the NBPA that began on July 1st, 2011, officially ended. Free agency, trades and training camps began the next day.\n\nIn 2019, Anthony Davis records the fourth 50-point game of his career. In a 142-125 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, he finished with numbers of 50 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four steals.\n\nRecent game-winning buzzer-beaters on Dec. 8\n\nBlake Griffin vs. Phoenix Suns in 2014\n\nAndrew Bogut vs. Indiana Pacers in 2010\n\nDerek Fisher vs. LA Clippers in 2010\n\nThe views on this page do not necessarily represent the views of the NBA or its clubs."
