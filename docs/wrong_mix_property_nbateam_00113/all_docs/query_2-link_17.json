        "text": "Chris Kaman is headed back to Los Angeles, this time with the Lakers.\n\nThe 7-foot free agent center who spent the first eight years of his career with the Clippers said Monday on Twitter that he had agreed to join the Lakers. The deal is reportedly for one year at $3.2 million.\n\n\"I am going to be going back to LA and it's to play for the Lakers!\" Kaman wrote. \"I am excited about this move and can't wait to play!\"\n\nLakers general manager Mitch Kupchak later issued a statement through the team saying Los Angeles has been negotiating with Kaman and intends to sign him.\n\nIt will be Kaman's second consecutive season on a one-year contract. He had an $8 million deal to be the starter in Dallas last season but spent more than half of every game on coach Rick Carlisle's bench.\n\nHe spent the previous season with New Orleans after he was part of the trade that sent Chris Paul to the Clippers.\n\nCAVALIERS: Owner Dan Gilbert wondered what other moves general manager Chris Grant had in mind to improve Cleveland this summer.\n\nHe knows now.\n\nThe Cavs hosted free agent center Andrew Bynum on Monday. The 7-foot Bynum, who didn't play one game for Philadelphia last season because of a knee injury, met with team officials at Cleveland Clinic Courts, the club's suburban facility.\n\nOn Sunday, Gilbert went on Twitter to applaud the team's acquisition of free agent forward Earl Clark and guard Jarrett Jack, who both agreed to terms on deals with Cleveland last week. On his page, Gilbert wrote: \"I am more than excited about @TeamEarlClark & @JarrettJack03 joining the @cavs! Two team players that flat-out make us better. What's next CG?\"\n\nGrant is hoping to land a big man, and with Dwight Howard signing with Houston, the 25-year-old Bynum is the most attractive center on the market. The Cavs want to first make sure Bynum is healthy before offering him a deal.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks are also reportedly interested in Bynum after not getting Howard.\n\n76ERS: Adam Aron stepped down as team CEO and been replaced by former Madison Square Garden Sports president Scott O'Neil.\n\nAron will remain on the team's board of directors and said he has increased his ownership stake in the franchise. Aron was part of the ownership group that bought the franchise in 2011.\n\nWARRIORS: A person with knowledge of the deal says the team and Marreese Speights have reached an agreement on a free agent contract."
