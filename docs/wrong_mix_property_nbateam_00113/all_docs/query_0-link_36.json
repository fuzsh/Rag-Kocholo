        "text": "David Stern wants to set the record straight and point the blame elsewhere.\n\nOne of the biggest blemishes on the former NBA commissioner’s resume is a trade that didn’t happen. Five years and one day ago, it appeared Chris Paul was headed from the then-New Orleans Hornets to the Los Angeles Lakers in a three-way trade that also included the Houston Rockets.\n\nPaul was set to go to the Lakers; Pau Gasol to the Rockets; and Lamar Odom, Kevin Martin, Goran Dragic, Luis Scola and a first-round draft pick (from Houston via the Knicks) to the Hornets.\n\nThere were multiple media reports at the time saying the deal was done. That was until Stern, acting as the league-owned Hornets’ principal decision-maker, vetoed the trade.\n\nBut now Stern, 74, is breaking out some semantics to try to diminish his role in what many perceived as an overly weighty thumb on the scales that foiled the Lakers, a team that won 57 games the season prior and was a year removed from back-to-back titles.\n\n“I’m going to correct your language: What ‘cancellation’?” Stern said this week in an interview with Sports Business Radio. “The GM [Dell Demps] was not authorized to make that trade. And acting on behalf of owners, we decided not to make it. I was an owner rep. There was nothing to ‘void.’ it just never got made.\n\n“When you’re the commissioner and you have two teams that are ticked off at you, as in the Lakers and Houston, and the GMs without wanting to be attributed, spend their time trashing you, the wrong impression can be granted. It was one of the few times I decided to just go radio silent and let it play out, and I got killed. So, the answer is: There was never a trade. It was never approved by me as the owner rep.”\n\nStern, who stepped down as commissioner in 2014 after 30 years on the job, did not deny being the one who killed the deal, just the timing of the murder. And that’s still an issue, considering the trade the Hornets eventually made: sending Paul to the Clippers for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu and a first-round pick from Minnesota.\n\nWhile Stern can blame the Rockets’ and Lakers’ whisper campaign, taking a worse deal on behalf of the New Orleans franchise is what ultimately tarnished Stern’s role in the trade and his legacy."
