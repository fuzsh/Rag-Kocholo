        "text": "NEW ORLEANS – David West had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Jeff Bower picked up his first coaching win in the New Orleans Hornets’ 110-102 victory over the Clippers on Tuesday night.\n\nWith Chris Paul out, point guards Darren Collison and Bobby Brown scored 12 apiece and combined for 11 assists as New Orleans snapped a three-game losing streak. Devin Brown had 16 points.\n\nAl Thornton scored 30 points and former Hornets guard Baron Davis had 23 for the Clippers, who have lost four of five.\n\nBower moved to the sideline while keeping his general manager role when Byron Scott was fired on Thursday.\n\nPeja Stojakovic scored 15 points for New Orleans, hitting six free throws down the stretch to seal the win.\n\nRookie reserve Marcus Thornton added 12 points and Emeka Okafor grabbed 14 rebounds.\n\nChris Kaman scored 17 points for the Clippers, Rasual Butler had 12 and Steve Novak 10. Marcus Camby finished with 14 rebounds.\n\nThe Hornets enjoyed their largest lead at 95-79 when Marcus Thornton hit a pair of 3-pointers early in the fourth quarter. The Clippers called timeout after the second one, then began to chip away at the deficit.\n\nThornton scored two quick baskets on strong inside moves, the second as he was fouled. He and Davis combined for back-to-back driving layups later to pull the Clippers to 97-88.\n\nAfter West’s free throws, Davis, who was 7-of-21 shooting, hit his first 3 in eight tries.\n\nThe Hornets finally stalled the Clippers’ momentum when West tipped in James Posey’s driving dunk attempt as it rattled out with 2:15 to go. West then added a jumper to make it 103-91.\n\nNew Orleans outrebounded the Clippers 51-36 and outscored them at the foul line, 28-17."
