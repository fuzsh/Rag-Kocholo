        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â€” Steve Blake is coming back to the Trail Blazers.\n\nA person with knowledge of the deal who cannot comment until it is formally announced confirmed Thursday that the free agent point guard has signed a two-year deal with Portland. The agreement was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nThe contract is worth a reported $4.2 million with a player option for the second year.\n\nBlake has had two previous stints with the Blazers, most recently from 2007-09, becoming a fan favorite before going on to play for the Lakers, Clippers and Golden State Warriors.\n\nBlake has averaged 6.9 points, 4.0 assists and 2.2 rebounds over an 11-year NBA career. Last season he averaged 6.9 points and 5.6 assists, splitting the season between the Lakers and Warriors.\n\nThe Trail Blazers can use Blake to help back up All-Star guard Damian Lillard. Mo Williams, who was first off the bench last season, is a free agent this summer and has reportedly talked to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nBlake also has a relationship with center Chris Kaman, who agreed to terms with the Blazers last week. Kaman, who signed a 2-year deal worth a reported $9.8 million, will back up starting center Robin Lopez.\n\nBlake's wife, Kristen, posted a photo of Blake and Kaman together while on the Lakers to Twitter, writing: \"Steve Blake and Chris Kaman, together forever. #Portlandia.\"\n\nThe Blazers used their midlevel exception to sign Kaman and their biannual exception to sign Blake.\n\nBlake signed with the Blazers as a free agent in 2005 then was traded the next season to the Milwaukee Bucks. He signed with Portland again in 2007 before being traded to the Clippers in 2010.\n\nBlake's best season came in 2008-09 with Portland, when he started and averaged a career-high 11.0 points.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
