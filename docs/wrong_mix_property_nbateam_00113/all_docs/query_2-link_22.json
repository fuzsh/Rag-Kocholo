        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. >> The question amused Chris Kaman, prompting him to laugh loudly.\n\nHow would he compare his current stint with the Portland Trail Blazers to his lone season last year with the Lakers?\n\n“I wouldn’t,” Kaman said in an interview with Los Angeles News Group. “They’re completely opposite.”\n\nKaman said those words as he put on his Trail Blazers uniform. Soon, Kaman would start at center in Monday night’s game against the Lakers at Moda Center, while Joel Freeland (right shoulder) and Robin Lopez (right hand) remained sidelined with injuries.\n\nWith the Lakers last season, Kaman averaged 10.4 points in 18.9 minutes, albeit in only 39 games after quickly becoming a casualty of Mike D’Antoni’s preference for perimeter-oriented players.\n\n“I can point fingers all day long. But it was my choice where I went,” said Kaman, who joined the Lakers in 2013 on a one-year deal worth $3.2 million. “I made the call and thought it would work. I don’t think that Mike D’Antoni purposely tried to screw anybody over. It’s just the way he wants to play people.”\n\nKaman signed a two-year, $9.8 million contract with Portland this offseason. He has averaged 9.7 points on 49.3 percent shooting in 18.8 minutes, primarily as a backup center. Kaman said he remained interested in staying with the Lakers, but they prioritized pursuing LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony.\n\n“Mitch (Kupchak) took forever trying to wait for Carmelo,” said Kaman, referring to the Lakers’ general manager. “I think that was (executive) Jimmy Buss. They lost a lot of opportunities personally by waiting that long. They lost a bunch of guys that went the other way. My guess is Jimmy said we want to wait for those guys so they can try to make a run at it.”\n\nComing home\n\nPortland reserve guard Steve Blake still views his four-year career with the Lakers in high regard despite the team trading him last season to the Golden State Warriors for Kent Bazemore and MarShon Brooks. Blake monitors the Lakers and has kept in touch with Kobe Bryant.\n\n“It was great, the experience to play with one of the best players to play the game and one of the best competitors I played with,” Blake told L.A. News Group about Bryant. “That’s the way I like to play. More than that, we became friends.”\n\nBlake said he “absolutely” had interest in signing with the Lakers as a free agent this offseason. He reported the Lakers talked at the beginning of free agency, though they stayed in a holding pattern because of James and Anthony.\n\n“As soon as the Blazers made me an offer, I took it pretty quickly,” Blake said. “There were a lot of questions for the Lakers to answer before they could get around to someone like me. I wasn’t the first option. A lot of those things didn’t clear themselves up until it was too late.”"
