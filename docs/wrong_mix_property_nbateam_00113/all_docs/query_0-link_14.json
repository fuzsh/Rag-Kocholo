        "text": "In between sips of whipped cream that he said tastes like liquid butter, Lakers center Chris Kaman sat by his locker stall processing something even more unsettling.\n\nWhy has Kaman, the Lakers’ consolation prize this offseason in the unsuccessful Dwight Howard sweepstakes, stuffed the box score this season with a string of non-appearances?\n\n“I’ve been asked that a hundred times and I honestly can’t answer that question without telling you a lie,” Kaman said. “I have no clue.”\n\nThe Lakers (14-22) enter Friday’s game against the Clippers (25-13) at Staples Center with a flood of injuries. But those ailments to Kobe Bryant (fractured left foot), Steve Nash (nerve issues in back), Steve Blake (hyperextended right elbow), Jordan Farmar (torn left hamstring) and Xavier Henry (bone bruise in right knee) have only opened playing time for the Lakers’ backcourt.\n\nEven in a season where the Lakers have fielded 20 different starting lineups, Kaman has only appeared in four of those combinations. His 8.1 points and 5.7 rebounds per game don’t quite match up to the 10-year veteran’s career averages (11.6 points, 7.6 rebounds in 28.4 minutes). But considering Kaman’s 17.4 minutes through 19 of the Lakers’ 36 games, he’s played remarkably efficient through the circumstances.\n\n“When I get my chance, I do my thing. I think I’m pretty decent when I get in there,” Kaman said. “I just haven’t gotten in there a lot.”\n\nHis appearance in the Lakers’ loss Thursday to Houston marked his first appearance in five games, and mostly entailed helping with the so-called Hack-a-Dwight strategy that involves intentionally fouling Howard in hopes of gaining extra possessions and winning the game.\n\nThat’s partly why Kaman downplayed matching up against the Clippers, whom he played for seven seasons (2003-10) before being traded to New Orleans in the Chris Paul deal.\n\n“I’m kind of past that point now,” Kaman said. “The first couple years when I left it was kind of fun, but they have a whole new team, new coaching staff, everybody in there. I don’t know anybody anymore.”\n\nKaman also doesn’t know if he will play.\n\n“He could,” Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni said. “We’ll look at it. We’ll try everything.”\n\nKaman didn’t envision this when he signed with the Lakers last offseason for one year at the mini mid-level exception at $3.2 million. Does he have second thoughts?\n\n“That’s really not fair for me to say that right now or ever,” Kaman told this newspaper. “The Lakers have been good to me and they gave me an opportunity I might not have had otherwise. I’m blessed and happy to have the opportunity whether I play or I don’t. I know I can help the team. But it’s ultimately not my decision on whether I play or not.”\n\nD’Antoni decides that, obviously.\n\n“I don’t really have conversations with him. Nothing has come up,” Kaman said in another quiet moment. “He’s a good guy. He’s been straight with me when we talk. I just haven’t had a lot of conversations with him.”\n\nD’Antoni sympathizes with Kaman’s diminished role. D’Antoni often argues Kaman’s become the casualty of a loaded frontcourt where the coach shows preference for floor spacers (the recently waived Shawne Williams, second-round draft pick Ryan Kelly) and solid interior defenders (Jordan Hill, Robert Sacre).\n\n“Sometimes I think people just say stuff to make it work,” Kaman said when relayed of D’Antoni’s thought process. “Sometimes things don’t work out the way you anticipate.”\n\nThe Lakers touted Kaman as a worthy second choice behind Howard after he left this offseason for the Houston Rockets. Though he lacks Howard’s defensive presence, Kaman’s offensive versatility appeared a more suitable match for Pau Gasol. His facilitating role last season became less effective because of Howard’s limitations in the post. The Lakers were also familiar with Kaman, whose seven years with the Clippers included a career-high 18.5 points and 9.6 rebounds in the 2009-10 season that helped him earn his lone All-Star appearance.\n\nThat formula worked during the preseason before staying sidelined for almost a week because of an intestinal illness during the Lakers’ exhibition trip to China. Kaman returned for the Lakers’ first 12 games, averaging 8.3 points and 5.3 rebounds until back spasms kept him out for three weeks.\n\nKaman’s role only expanded recently when Gasol missed three games because of an upper respiratory issue. Kaman started in two of those games, averaging 14.5 points and 13 rebounds. But he played only 10 minutes during Gasol’s absence against Philadelphia last week and posted four points and three rebounds.\n\n“I just try to play. When it’s my turn, it’s my turn,” Kaman said. “When I sit, I just try to be positive and try to be professional about it.”"
