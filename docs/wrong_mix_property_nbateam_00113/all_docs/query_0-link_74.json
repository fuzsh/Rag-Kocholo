        "text": "As the noon Thursday NBA trade deadline ticked closer, the Lakers continued to build their identity for this first season under Mike Brown.\n\nThey struggled again from 3-point range, but they defended well enough again when it mattered.\n\nAnd behind the one-two punch of Kobe Bryant and Andrew Bynum, even though neither was at his best, the Lakers rallied from five points down in the final 53 seconds to beat the New Orleans Hornets, 107-101, in overtime on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Lakers came from five points down late in games to beat Boston on Sunday and Memphis on Tuesday. Fighting fatigue from that double-overtime victory in Memphis, the Lakers were slow early and fell down by 17 points before rallying to a 70-70 tie entering the fourth quarter in New Orleans.\n\nBryant played 52 minutes in Memphis and 49 more in New Orleans. He hit three free throws with 19 seconds left in regulation to forge a tie and scored the Lakers’ first five points of overtime. He finished with 33 points and five assists.\n\nBynum scuffled early in the game while Pau Gasol led the offense, but Bynum still finished with 25 points on 10-of-17 shooting, 18 rebounds and four assists.\n\nMetta World Peace shook off two previous misses to nail a 3-pointer with 4:03 left off Bryant’ s pass to help the Lakers’ rally. Bryant came up way short on a 3-pointer with 2:21 left and the Lakers down, 91-88, and then Bynum missed a difficult fading bank shot after Chris Kaman’s basket at the other end. But the Lakers’ defense held well enough.\n\nDerek Fisher hit the go-ahead shot in overtime, followed by a steal and fast-break score from World Peace for a 102-99 lead with 40 seconds left in overtime. The Hornets’ woeful season continued with ex-Laker Trevor Ariza missing several key shots late and shooting 4 for 13 from the field overall, and they dropped to 10-32.\n\nIt was the first time the Lakers had played overtime games on back-to-back days since Nov. 3-4, 2009.\n\nSteve Blake played 18 minutes and had three points on 1-of-4 shooting from the field, though he made several of his typical little plays to help the Lakers’ cause. Jamal Crawford, cited by multiple reports as part of a proposed deal that would send Blake to Portland and Minnesota’s Michael Beasley to the Lakers, did not play for Portland in New York on Wednesday night."
