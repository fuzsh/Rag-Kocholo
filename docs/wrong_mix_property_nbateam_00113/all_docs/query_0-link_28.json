        "text": "It's the Rockets' seventh game in ten days. I can't even play 7 pickup games in 10 days, much less full 48-minute affairs (plus two overtimes). Of course, these guys get paid lots of money (as in, tens of dollars!) to keep in shape and play a game that involves placing a ball in a hoop. Sometimes I really wish I was 6-9. And athletic. And in shape. And coordinated. Okay, depression over.\n\nIt's back to .500 for the good guys, and tonight marks their first chance to rise above that number. In their way are the New Orleans Hornets, who have had one of the quietest offseasons in recent memory. Seriously, their offseason moves were more boring than the National Championship game played in...New Orleans! I know, I'm so smart.\n\nAs of this writing, the Hornets are 3-10 and playing against Memphis, so at least the Rockets will have a little more rest than their opponents.\n\nAnd just think: the Hornets were this close to having a lineup that consisted of Dragic, Martin, Ariza, Landry, and Scola. Yeah, that almost happened. Then they would be really close to the ever-elusive all-white lineup. I'm going to see it one day, I tell you!*\n\n*SB Nation and The Dream Shake do not endorse the all-white lineup due to potential backlash from politically correct groups. All views (crazy or otherwise) are those of the writer, who is crazy and is admitting it right now by actually writing this disclaimer.\n\nTip is at 7pm CST.\n\nMatchups after the jump.\n\nMatchups:\n\nPG: Kyle Lowry vs. Jarrett Jack:\n\nThat's two games in a row where Lowry hasn't looked All-Universe. Time to trade him.\n\nJack is averaging 16/7/4. That's pretty darn good, but poor guy is probably just a holdover for the Hornets. Seems like a nice guy.\n\nAdvantage: Rockets\n\nSG: Kevin Martin vs. Marco Belinelli:\n\nYou know what I hate hearing about upcoming opponents? That they've been shooting poorly. Weird, but as a Rockets fan I've been conditioned to expect them to have amazing bounceback games against us. Belinelli goes 5-7 from deep tonight. Count on it.\n\nThis is hilarious:\n\nvia www.angelfire.com\n\nThat is all.\n\nAdvantage: Rockets\n\nSF: Chandler Parsons vs. Trevor Ariza:\n\nOkay, so...Tip Dunk Eddy?\n\nAgainst Handles?\n\nShould be...interesting.\n\nAdvantage: Hornets\n\nPF: Luis Scola vs. Carl Landry:\n\nLandry comes off the bench, but he's really the power forward here.\n\nI've never made a real choice when it comes to Luis Landry matchups, but tonight I'll say it's Scola's.\n\nAdvantage: Rockets\n\nC: Samuel Dalembert vs. Emeka Okafor:\n\nIt's only even because Okafor always has career games against us. I don't think he will tonight, but respect has to be earned, and Okafor has done that.\n\nThough Dalembert is like, good.\n\nAdvantage: Even\n\n---\n\nBench:\n\nHornets: Jason Smith, Chris Kaman, Greivis Vasquez, Al-Farouq Aminu, DaJuan Summers, Gustavo Ayon\n\nRockets: Goran Dragic, Chase Budinger, Jordan Hill, Patrick Patterson, Courtney Lee\n\nAdvantage: Even\n\nInjuries/Inactives:\n\nHornets: Eric Gordon out\n\nRockets: Jordan Hill out (flu)\n\nPrediction: Rockets 99-88\n\nMake sure you get in on TCWHRO (we have to figure out another way to say that)'s fantasy basketball game. Details here. Just make your predictions in the comments, and maybe explain how you came to that conclusion so we have something to talk about.\n\nHornets vs Rockets coverage"
