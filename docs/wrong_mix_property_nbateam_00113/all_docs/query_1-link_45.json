        "text": "The New Orleans Pelicans have high hopes for the 2024-25 NBA season. They were among the teams who recently made a huge splash in the offseason by trading for Atlanta Hawks point guard Dejounte Murray. With Murray in the fold, the Pels now have a formidable foursome of Murray, CJ McCollum, Brandon Ingram, and Zion Williamson.\n\nBut another player who could make a big impact on the court next season is incoming NBA sophomore Jordan Hawkins, who could make a leap in his second year as a pro, especially if he manages to improve on an important area (h/t Jim Eichenhofer of The New Orleans Pelicans Podcast).\n\nJordan Hawkins on a primary focus for him entering his second #NBA season: “The defensive end. That’s what held me back a lot of times last year, not being able to guard. This year my big focus is being able to guard guards, wings, and trying to get bigger.”\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans’ Jordan Hawkins can surprise more people in Year 2\n\nHawkins appeared in 67 games for the Pelicans in his rookie season and averaged 7.8 points, 2.2 rebounds, and an assist. He also normed just 0.3 steals and 0.1 blocks per outing. The Pelicans were one of the best defensive teams in the league last season as evidenced by their 112.0 points allowed per 100 possessions (adjusted) — sixth-best in the NBA overall.\n\nDrafted 14th overall in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft by the Pelicans out of the UConn Huskies program, Hawkins has always been known more as a scorer than a defensive asset. But there is definitely lots of time for him to develop into a much better two-way player, as the Pelicans look to take a big leap in the next season.\n\nFor More NBA, WNBA, and College Basketball Content:"
