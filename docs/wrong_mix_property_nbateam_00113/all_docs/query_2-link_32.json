Sam Cassell has taken a very good team and with his leadership and shooting ability, and huge personality, Sam has made the Clippers great.

However, what is encouraging is that everyone is still fighting like we’re playing in a Game 7. This weekend we beat Atlanta on a Trenton Hassell … Read more\n\nSince anyone reading this blog is somewhat computer savy I have to tell you about the good laugh that KG and I shared today in practice. We’re sitting there shooting free-throws like we always do after an intense practice session where Eddie, KG, Blount, Reed and I really go at each other in drills. The … Read more\n\nThe season is coming to an end and while all of us are very disappointed that we’re not going to the playoffs, I’ve seen some real positives lately from the team.
