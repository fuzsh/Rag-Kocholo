        "text": "After making a run to get a playoff spot in the regular season, the New Orleans Pelicans are now fighting to stay afloat, thanks to a Play-In Tournament 110-106 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. But for head coach Willie Green, there’s something wrong with how the game was officiated for them.\n\nWith the regular season done, NOLA faced off against LeBron James and the Lakers in the first game of the Play-In Tournament. The NBA’s all-time leading scorer led the Purple and Gold with 23 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists. D’Angelo Russell made 21 points on 45 percent shooting from deep, while Anthony Davis added 20 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nThe Pelicans saw Zion Williamson went off for 40 points on 63 percent shooting from the field, 11 rebounds, and five assists. He was also the only New Orleans player to score more than 13 points as the offense mainly ran through Williamson.\n\nThe loss knocked New Orleans down to an upcoming match against the Sacramento Kings, with the winner facing the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Lakers are scheduled to go up against Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets in the first round of this year’s playoffs.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans Coach Willie Green Reveals Problem In Loss to Los Angeles Lakers\n\nAfter the game, NOLA coach Willie Green spoke to the media and revealed his one big problem during the match. In a tweet posted by Pelicans Film Room on X:\n\nThis season, the Lakers are tied at first with the Orland Magic when it comes to free throw attempts per game at 24.4. The Pelicans, on the other hand, are in ninth place with 22.7 free throw attempts per contest. During the game itself, the Lakers enjoyed more trips to the charity stripe at 29, as compared to NOLA’s 15.\n\nWhether Green’s claim is true or not, the Pelicans will have to go through the longer route of winning against the Kings to make the playoffs. In any case, it’s going to be an uphill battle for them, especially with Williamson going through an injury.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
