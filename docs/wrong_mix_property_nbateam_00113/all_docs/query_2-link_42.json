        "text": "Thursday's NBA Draft features one of the weakest center crops in recent years with only one player, Central Michigan's 7-foot, 255-pound Chris Kaman, considered a first-round lock.\n\nThat's rather amazing if you look at three super-sized what-ifs that could have changed the focus of many teams.\n\nFirst, the Chinese government could have told 2002 No. 1 pick Yao Ming he would need to wait at least a year before making himself available. Second, Western Kentucky's Chris Marcus could have avoided foot and ankle injuries that now put his future in question. And third, 7-5, 303-pound Russian Pavel Podkolzine, who wowed scouts with impressive workouts in the last month, could have decided to remain in the draft instead of returning to Metis Varese (Italy) for another season after recently being diagnosed with acromegaly, the now-treatable pituitary condition that helped lead to the early death of professional wrestler Andre the Giant.\n\nEach likely would have been taken in the lottery, and possibly all would have gone in the top-10. But now, there's just Kaman, the Mid-American Conference Player of the Year after averaging 22.4 points, 12 rebounds and 3.2 blocks as a junior. He looks to be a servicable talent that may never develop into an all-star.\n\nAmong the remaining big men, teenagers Malick Badiane of Langen (Germany), Zaur Pachulia of Ulker (Turkey), James Lang (Central Park Christian High School in Alabama) and Kendrick Perkins (Ozen High School in Texas) could get selected in the first round by an established team hoping to add frontcourt depth. However, none of them appear to be ready to start or contribute much as rookies.\n\nMarcus and 7-6, 262-pound Serbian Slavko Vranes could intrigue a club like the Los Angeles Lakers or San Antonio Spurs to give Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan, respectively, large bodies to bang against in practice. However, Marcus only recently was cleared by doctors to jog, and Vranes has an unrefined offensive game - he averaged 3.8 points in his best season overseas - and needs to add upper-body strength."
