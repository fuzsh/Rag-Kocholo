        "text": "The New Orleans Hornets, Phoenix Suns and Minnesota Timberwolves have agreed to a multiplayer trade sending 7-foot center Robin Lopez and forward Hakim Warrick from Phoenix to New Orleans, while moving forward Wesley Johnson and a first-round draft pick from Minnesota to Phoenix, a person familiar with the deal said.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because it hasn’t been announced pending the completion of some routine logistical matters.\n\nThe deal also sends guard Jerome Dyson and retiring center Brad Miller’s $5.1 million contract from New Orleans to Minnesota, allowing the Timberwolves to clear space under the NBA’s salary cap as they pursue free agents. Minnesota also will receive two second-round draft picks from New Orleans, while the Hornets will receive cash.\n\nMinnesota general manager David Kahn declined to confirm the deal when asked about it on a conference call, saying only that he is “not allowed to comment on anything that hasn’t been consummated.”\n\nThe acquisition of Lopez fills a need at center for the Hornets, who traded away Emeka Okafor and let Chris Kaman go in free agency.\n\nLopez has been an off-and-on starter in the NBA and was a reserve for all 64games in which he appeared last season, averaging 5.4 points, 3.3 rebounds and 0.7 blocks in 14 minutes a game.\n\nFoye joins the Jazz\n\nThe Utah Jazz have agreed to terms with former Clippers guard Randy Foye.\n\nGeneral manager Kevin O’Connor announced the deal, which was pending the outcome of a physical. Terms were not released.\n\nFoye has averaged 11.6 points, 3.2 assists and 2.4 rebounds in a six-year career that has included stints with Minnesota, Washington and the Clippers. Foye played in 65 games with the Clippers last season, starting 48. He averaged 11.0 points, 2.2 assists and 2.1 rebounds.\n\nAlso …\n\nPhoenix re-signed guard Shannon Brown to a two-year deal. Brown averaged 11 points and 2.7 rebounds in a career-high 23.7 minutes per game last season. … Cleveland acquired point guard Jeremy Pargo, a second-round draft pick in 2014, and cash considerations from the Memphis in exchange for guard-forward D.J. Kennedy. … Minnesota finalized the signing of 23-year-old Russian guard Alexey Shved."
