        "text": "Many people are bringing up trade partners for CP3 and are neglecting to mention the Clippers. The thing is, the reason they are considered an up and coming team is for their young talent and their cap room. Well those are the two most important things for a CP3 deal. People will say CP3 might prefer other places but it does not matter because its a trade. Now they may not part with Blake Griffin, but a package of Eric Gordon and Chris Kaman for Chris Paul and the terrible contract of Emeka Okafor would be very appealing to New Orleans. Baron would then be shipped somewhere; NY or CHA Think about it:\n\nHornets: (with trade have great financial position)\n\npg: collison\n\nsg: gordon, thornton\n\nsf: posey, stojackavic, pondexter\n\npf: west, brackins\n\nc: kaman\n\nClippers:\n\npg: paul, bledsoe\n\nsg: foye, warren\n\nsf: gomes, aminu\n\npf: griffin, smith\n\nc: okafor, jordan\n\nnow the clipper line-up looks suspect but imagine the duo of cp3 and griffin, along with young guys like aminu, bledsoe, and jordan. plus, they could package those guys for another big name or just use the cap space from a baron trade to bring in a big name.\n\non paper but as we all know especially you since it looks like you a clipper fan they fail to put it together year after year. CP3 will look at a team with past winning experience as well along with talent. you mention it won’t matter then why did the raptors not s&t bosh to the cavs instead of the heat? because in the end the players decide not the owners. Major Minus for clippers-DONALD STERLING IS YOUR OWNER. sorry to burst your happy moment but its true and Griffen hasn’t played a single game.\n\ncp3 has 2 years left on his deal…\n\nand who cares about sterling if its a trade.\n\nlastly, without a good pg, u cant have much success in the nba. therefore, kaman is expenable for a star pg. and gordon is good but not untouchable. also, u have to give to get.\n\nhe will get his wish and get traded to one of the teams he wants to go to. U actually think they would trade him to a team that isnt a contender?or that doesnt have another star?no.The Hornets management will look at whats best for them as well.\n\nHe want’s another star on the team, and Griffin could be that guy, but he is far from it at this point. The Magic would be the best suitor at this point for CP3, he would make Dwight Howard so much better that it’s almost ridiculous to think about. They could seriously be contenders to not just get to the Finals, but WIN…\n\nand take all their young talent and Picks and watch Paul abandon them once his contract is over…\n\nIf Paul wants Out…then he’ll have to wait for it…when he’s a Free Agent he can pick and choose where he plays…If he want’s to be some other guys butt buddy then , no one can stop him…\n\nBut If a Team really wants Paul…all they have to do is Offer a Young “star” some other young pieces, a high Lottery pick and possible a huge expiring Contract…they’ll also have to take on abad contract like Peja or Okefor or Both….\n\nTeams that have the combo of young players and Huge expiring deals are the real leaders of the Paul trade race…Blazers have Miller,Bayless, Rudy And Oden or Camby to offer…they would include pick and they’d remain a contender post trade…\n\nNets have Harris, Favors and 1st round pick to offer…Lee would be in that deal too…Hornets should and would hope on that…\n\nPotential All Star Pg/Great Shooting Sg with better size than Thornton and a potential Stud in Favors and Future Pick…."
