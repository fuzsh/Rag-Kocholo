        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks made two significant moves on Wednesday, the first day NBA teams could officially sign free agents.\n\nThey acquired former UCLA guard Darren Collison in a trade with the Pacers and signed former Clippers and New Orleans center Chris Kaman. They made room in their salary cap for Kaman by using their $8.3 million amnesty clause on center Brendon Haywood.\n\nSources told ESPN.com the Mavericks agreed to acquire Collison and swingman Dahntay Jones in a sign-and-trade deal that will send free-agent center Ian Mahinmi to the Pacers to serve as a backup for Roy Hibbert.\n\nBoth Collison and Kaman will be playing on expiring contracts next season. Collison, who could fill the starting point guard spot vacated by Jason Kidd and sixth man Jason Terry, has one year left on his contract at $2.3 million. Kaman agreed to terms on a one-year deal worth $8 million.\n\nJones, a defensive specialist who was involved in feisty scraps with the Mavericks while playing with Denver and Indiana in recent seasons, also is entering the final year of his contract at $2.9 million.\n\nKaman averaged 13.1 points and 7.7 rebounds in 47 games with the Hornets last season. He played the first eight seasons of his career with the Clippers and was an All-Star in 2010. His career has been slowed by nagging injuries.\n\nKnicks acquire Camby, will keep Lin\n\nThe Houston Rockets traded center Marcus Camby to the New York Knicks for guard Toney Douglas, centers Josh Harrelson and Jerome Jordan and future second-round picks.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, when the NBA’s moratorium on trades ended, Houston dealt point guard Kyle Lowry to Toronto for a future first-round lottery pick and forward Gary Forbes.\n\nThe Rockets have been collecting draft picks for a potential package to entice Orlando to send All-Star center Dwight Howard their way. The Lowry deal was in place several days ago, and the Camby deal was agreed to on Monday.\n\nThe 38-year-old Camby will return to New York, where he played from 1998-2002. Yahoo Sports reported that Camby’s deal was for three years and $13.2 million. He should be a valuable backup at center to Tyson Chandler, last season’s NBA Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nThe Knights also made it clear Jeremy Lin will be staying in New York. Coach Mike Woodson repeated that Lin will “absolutely” be back next season and will enter training camp as the starter at his position, even with the Knicks agreeing to a deal with veteran Jason Kidd.\n\nLin had agreed to sign an offer sheet with the Houston Rockets for about $28 million over four years. The Knicks have said all along they planned to match any offer for their restricted free agent, and Woodson said the Knicks “never once” blinked at knowing they would have to pay that figure. Lin took to his Twitter page Wednesday to deny a report that he was unhappy with the Knicks for not signing him right away.\n\nDuncan era still going strong\n\nThe Tim Duncan era isn’t over yet in San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs announced that they had re-signed Duncan, bringing back the 36-year-old forward for at least a 16th season. Terms were not disclosed, though Yahoo Sports cited anonymous sources in reporting it was a three-year, $36 million deal.\n\nThe first overall pick in the 1997 draft, Duncan in 15 seasons has led the Spurs to nine division titles and the playoffs every year, including four NBA titles. The Spurs are 830-352 in the regular season during his tenure, the highest winning percentage over any 15-year span in NBA history. Duncan has two league MVP awards to go along with three NBA Finals MVP honors.\n\nDuncan, a 13-time All-Star, has averaged 20.3 points, 11.3 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.22 blocks per game over his career.\n\nWarriors trade Wright in 3-team deal\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are getting more for Dorell Wright after all – pending some last-minute paperwork, of course. The Warriors agreed to send Wright to the Philadelphia 76ers in a three-team trade that will net guard Jarrett Jack from the Hornets, two people familiar with the decision said.\n\nThe sources said the Hornets will receive the 76ers’ draft rights to Edin Bavcic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in a salary-slashing move that also clears space in a crowded backcourt. Bavcic, acquired by Philadelphia in a trade with Toronto in 2006, is expected to remain in Europe next season.\n\nLewis expects to enjoy the Heat\n\nRashard Lewis has already thought plenty about what it could mean to share the court with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Ray Allen. In short, he knows defenses could be a bit confounded.\n\nLewis and Allen signed their free-agent deals with the NBA champion Miami Heat, with talk immediately turning to how the new faces – both 3-point threats – could extend opponents who might find themselves focusing defensively on James, Wade and Bosh.\n\n“You’ve got to double-team LeBron. You have to double-team Dwyane Wade. You’ve got to double-team Chris Bosh. And then you think they’re going to leave Ray Allen open?” Lewis said, flanked by Heat president Pat Riley and coach Erik Spoelstra at his introductory news conference.\n\n“They’ve got to leave somebody open. So I have to go a million jumpers tonight and be ready to knock them down.”\n\nCrawford makes it official\n\nJamal Crawford is moving down the West Coast to join the Clippers. The team said the free-agent guard signed a deal as expected.\n\nCrawford averaged 13.9 points, 3.2 assists and 2.0 rebounds in 60 games in his lone season with Portland. He shot 38 percent from the field, 31 percent from 3-point range and led the NBA in free-throw shooting at 93 percent, a weakness for the Clippers last season. Crawford was the league’s sixth man of the year in 2009-10 with Atlanta.\n\nAround the league\n\nBlazers: General manager Neil Olshey said the team will match any offers for French swingman Nicolas Batum. Olshey’s comments came after speculation the team might be working on a sign-and-trade with Minnesota, which was interested in the restricted free agent. Olshey said he believes Batum has more value than what Minnesota would be able to offer. … Portland also announced it had signed Spanish forward Victor Claver, who was the 22nd overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Blazers. He comes to Portland after six seasons with Valencia in the Spanish ACB League.\n\nThunder: Oklahoma City signed undrafted free agent Hollis Thompson and center Hasheem Thabeet.\n\nKings: Sacramento signed power forward Jason Thompson to a new contract. Thompson was a restricted free agent.\n\nPistons: Kyle Singler signed a multiyear contract after spending last season playing in Spain.\n\nCavaliers: Cleveland signed forward Luke Harangody, 24, to a $1.1 million contract for next season. Knicks acquire Camby, will keep Lin"
