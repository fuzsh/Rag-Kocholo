        "text": "While basketball fans continually argue over which NBA players are overrated, overpaid or both, a professor of economics at Southern Utah University has designed an algorithm to help put some questions to rest.\n\nDavid Berri, author of the 2005 book entitled \"The Wages of Wins,\" created a statistical method called \"Wins Produced\" to find out for sure which players earn their contracts every year and which ones don't. Berri told CNBC.com that NBA players are paid for high scoring, so more points equal a higher salary. But \"Wins Produced\" takes into account other important statistics that contribute to winning -- such as shots taken, rebounds, turnovers and fouls. The method resembles the \"Wins Above Replacement (WAR)\" method used by Sabermetric baseball analysts.\n\n\"Wins in basketball are primarily about a team's ability to get and keep possession of the ball and then turning those possessions into points,\" Berri told CNBC.com in an email. \"In 2011-12, NBA teams paid $1.9 billion for 990 regular season wins. This means that the cost per win was $1.946 million. Given the cost of each win and knowing both how many victories each player produced and his salary allows us to see which players were overpaid.\"\n\nUsing data from DraftExpress.com and basketball analyst Patricia Bender, Berri compiled a list of the 10 most overpaid players in the NBA this season. Here is Berri's list, including how much he says they're overpaid, which in some cases is actually more than their total salary due to a negative \"Wins Produced\" rating:\n\n1. Rashard Lewis, Washington Wizards (overpaid by $21,167,231)\n\n2. Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers (overpaid by $19,693,258)\n\n3. Antawn Jamison, Cleveland Cavaliers (overpaid by $17,402,350)\n\n4. Amar'e Stoudemire, New York Knicks (overpaid by $14,918,309 )\n\n5. Chris Kaman, New Orleans Hornets (overpaid by $14,613,480)\n\n6. Mehmet Okur, Brooklyn Nets (overpaid by $12,988,657)\n\n7. Corey Maggette, Charlotte Bobcats (overpaid by $12,862,248)\n\n8. Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas Mavericks (overpaid by $12,851,295)\n\n9. Deron Williams, Brooklyn Nets (overpaid by $12,784,867)\n\n10. Tyrus Thomas, Charlotte Bobcats (overpaid by $12,459,225)\n\nOn Monday, Forbes.com released its annual list of the world's highest paid athletes. The Miami Heat's LeBron James came in fourth behind Floyd Mayweather Jr., Manny Pacquiao and Tiger Woods. James earned $53 million last year, ranking first among 13 NBA players on the list. Kobe Bryant was sixth among all athletes after earning $52.3 million. Forbes.com said that all NBA players had 20 percent salary cuts in 2011 due to the NBA lockout.\n\nWho do you think are the most overpaid players in the NBA? Leave your comments below."
