        "text": "EL SEGUNDO – There will be a little less of Chris Kaman tonight when the Clippers’ starting center returns, after missing the past two games.\n\nKaman came down with the flu, and a trip home to Michigan during the four-day All-Star break did not help improve his condition. Kaman subsequently came down with bronchitis to add to his flu-weakened body. The episode caused him to lose 13 pounds, and he was unable to play last Tuesday against Phoenix or Saturday afternoon against Golden State.\n\nHowever, Kaman was back at practice Sunday, picking up a basketball for the first time in nearly 10 days.\n\nRusty?\n\n“He missed his first eight shots,” Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy said. “But then he started getting into the groove. But it’s going to be a little bit of time.”\n\nDunleavy chided the reports that he read on the Internet and heard on sports-talk radio that questioned whether Kaman – or any player – should miss a game for what the Clippers’ training staff described as “flu-like symptoms.” Dunleavy said that description allows that the more graphic aspects of the illness – vomiting and diarrhea, don’t have to be mentioned.\n\nSINGLETON SOLID\n\nThe past three games are the first stretch of games that second-year forward James Singleton has logged double-figure minutes on the court. Should he continue his energetic, low-mistake play in games and show the same effort in practice, it is likely that Dunleavy will find a regular spot for him in the rotation.\n\nOf all the players available off the bench, Singleton is the liveliest rebounder, an area in which the Clippers have dropped off significantly from last season. Singleton snagged a season-high eight rebounds in 13 minutes in the victory Saturday at Golden State.\n\nAs a rookie last season, Singleton had six games in which he grabbed at least 10 rebounds. But the effort has not been there on a regular basis in practice, which is where Dunleavy predicates playing time.\n\n“We’ve been telling him all along that we love his energy and the things he brings into the game,” Dunleavy said. “We’ve talked to James about doing what you do, don’t try to do more than what you can do, and that’s going to help us.”\n\nDunleavy’s review of the game against the Warriors revealed that Singleton extended six offensive possessions, five with rebounds and one with a backcourt steal.\n\n“Until it’s consistent, I’m not going to think like that,” Singleton said, when asked if he thought he had wedged his way into the rotation. “I’m just going to do what the team needs me to do when I get the chance to get out there, and continue to work on improving my game.”\n\nTHREE AILING\n\nGuards Sam Cassell (abdominal strain) and Cuttino Mobley (strained groin muscle) did not practice Sunday. Nor did forward Tim Thomas (back spasms). All probably will play tonight. Cassell’s latest injury has affected his performance considerably. He is 5 of 28 from the field in the past four games.\n\nJOHNSON FUNERAL SET\n\nFuneral services for former NBA great and Clippers assistant coach Dennis Johnson will be conducted Friday at 1p.m., at City of Refuge, 14527 San Pedro Dr., in Gardena. Internment will be at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes."
