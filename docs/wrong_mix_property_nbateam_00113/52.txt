NBA: Kaman sprains ankle, as L.A. loses 14th straight against

New Orleans.

Add center Chris Kaman to the injury list for the Clippers.

Kaman played less than eight minutes the Clippers’ 101-82 loss Tuesday to the New Orleans Hornets after spraining his ankle.

He joins guards Eric Gordon and Randy Foye on the Clippers’ wounded list. Gordon, the Clippers leading scorer, missed his first game since hurting his left shoulder against Utah on Saturday night. Foye missed his sixth straight game with a sore left hamstring.

New Orleans created 25 turnovers that led to 35 points. Chris Paul and David West each had three steals.

“You can’t expect to win at home or on the road when you have that many turnovers, so we’ve got to do a much better job of valuing the possession of the ball,” Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro said.

Kaman’s injury allowed 2010 first-round pick Al-Farouq Aminu to get extended time, and he was one of the bright spots Tuesday for the Clippers. Aminu finished with a team-high 20 points.

Ryan Gomes added 11 points for the Clippers, while Blake Griffin and Rasual Butler each had 10.

Aminu, a reserve forward who came into the game averaging 2.7 points, had 16 through three quarters, helping the Clippers claw back after they’d fallen down by 13 early in the second half.

After Griffin’s three-point play on a reverse jam, Aminu added a fastbreak layup and 3-pointer from the corner, then Griffin scored inside again during a 12-2 run that cut it to 63-60 late in the third quarter.

Jason Smith’s jumper ended the run and the Clippers’ momentum. Ariza’s third 3 helped New Orleans score the last seven points of the quarter.

Willie Green scored 19 points and Jarryd Bayless added 15, helping the Hornets improved to a franchise-best 7-0 start.
