As far as most of the locally produced series and TV movies are further distributed and broadcast mainly inside the CIS territories, we picked up the most interesting and original projects with those script-ideas that have international appeal and may further travel abroad to Europe, Asia or the North America both as readymade product or formats. Besides there are a lot of full-length features recently launched into production in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and other CIS territories that for sure may have not only successful international distribution but also be the award winners and nominees of different interna- tional film festivals. From the other hand the CIS television industry currently is one of the biggest world consumers of TV-formats. And the quantity of newly launched format-based TV shows in Ukraine and Russia is the best evidence of this statement. De- spite large portion of information on the new movies, shows and series you’ll also find the detailed report on the recent distribution deals with the CIS-partners. While preparing this issue we decided to pay special attention to the film in- dustry state support in such former USSR countries as Azerbaijan, Ar- menia, Belorussia, Georgia, Kazakh- stan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Uzbekistan, Ukraine and Tajikistan. And we can for sure say that despite some cons in each of the state funding systems, the majority of the CIS countries has succeed to establish national film production support mechanisms. Most of them has adopted experience of Europe and are trying to focus not only on production, but on co-production instead. Also you will find our exclusive interview with creative director of the Kazakh media holding Khabar Agency JSC Erzhan Suleimenov, who told about the peculiarities of TV content production in Kazakhstan, broadcasters’ cooperation with producers as well as the role of the government in Kazakhstan TV market development and upcom- ing launch of digital terrestrial television. And one more thing we’d like to remind you. Plan- ning you business calendar for 2012 do not forget to book time to visit the major event for television and media professionals in the CIS region - KIEV MEDIA WEEK 2012, September 11-14, 2012. Organized by Media Resources Management company, this unique media industry project, one and only of a kind in the CIS and Central and Eastern Europe is a one stop destination for five international media trade events.
