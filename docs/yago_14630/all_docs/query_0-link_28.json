I am unwilling to impinge on T. C. F.’s review of: Never Take No For An Answer, which appears in this issue; but it would please me to record that this is one of the most delightful films I have seen for a long time. This film, so simple, so full of light and laughter proves the truth that simplicity is the best policy and that stories are more important than stars. The little orphan boy, Vittorio Manunta, who plays the part of Pepino, out-shines most of the film stars who glitter in the false skies of many film studios. This is a happy film (no sex, no sadism, no pseudo-tough-guy stuff) which radiates the happiness and objectivity of St. Francis of Assisi. I could not help contrasting it with Rossellini’s recent film in which he kills the true St. Francis and makes him a sort of playboy of the Western World. Paul Gallico has dedicated his book, “The Small Miracle’’ (from which the film was made) to. “St. Francis, a Man among Saints”; but in no sense of the word did he set out to write about St. Francis. He just desired to tell a story. He has told his story so well, that among other lovely things, it conveys the spirit of St. Francis with greater integrity than some pagan biographers. The same may be said of the film. Paul Gallico has the true story-teller’s gift of revealing the romance and the adventure of ordinary things and ordinary people. Let us hope that his other stories, “The Snow Goose”, “The Lonely”, “Jennie”, will be made into films. Editor. 4 Catholic Film Personalities By GABRIEL FALLON No. l F. J. McCORMICK The Actor the Cinema Missed F. J. McCormick will possibly go down in history as the actor the Cinema missed. His appearance as Shell in Odd Man Out made it clear to the discerning that a great artist of the screen was about to command world audiences. Yet even as we listened to the plaudits of that performance death’s bailiffs were knocking at the door. Within a few weeks of the Irish premiere F. J. McCormick was a stricken man. A short while after, those who knew him learned with shock-dulled understanding that one of the greatest actors the Abbey Theatre ever produced had said farewell to life’s fitful fever. The Man and the Actor What the cinema missed in F. J. McCormick it will never know. But those of us who knew the man and the actor can make a shrewd assessment. It was not for nothing that studio personnel used to drop the task in hand and crowd on to the set whenever this likeable Irishman was in action before British cameras. For most of his career F. J. (or Peter, as we called him, for his name was Peter Judge) worked in what is known as “intimate” theatre. He came of a school of acting which combined the finer aspects of Moscow Art technique with that of Antoine’s Theatre Libre. His subtle type of playing, which eschewed everything that was either broad or flamboyant, was particularly suited to cinema technique. So too was his method of character building which always began from somewhere inside him and unfolded itself in superficial detail only when it had passed the test of inner conviction. While as much might be said for any of his Abbey Theatre colleagues, F. J. McCormick had this quality in a marked degree. There were occasions on which his character acting appeared to have a strange cataleptic quality, occasions on which it seemed as if the actor were possessed by the character. This was particularly noticeable in such a portrayal as his Joxer Daly in “Juno and the Paycock” (a part in some respects allied to Shell in Odd Man Out). I was privileged to be on the stage with him night after night for hundreds of performances and to watch the details of this amazing creation. They say that Coquelin in “Tartuffe” would stand wholly silent for minutes together and yet be acting, almost speaking, copiously and lucidly. I never really understood how that could happen until I watched McCormick’s Joxer and observed the thoughts of his character’s mind reacting to the current stage situation, as they played on the actor’s face as on an instrument, conveying to the audience almost in mesmeric fashion more than the author could have put in fifty lines. Amazing Versatility His versatility was amazing. When F. J. McCormick joined the Abbey, that theatre was a repertory theatre in every sense of the term. A different play every week. This weekly system meant that parts had to be played ad nutum, so to speak. For the small part actor the system was sufficiently strenuous but on the leading player it imposed a continuous strain. One thinks of Coquelin, eating his way slowly, as it is said, into a part in the first weeks he played it, working down into the character’s soul through his own first tentative expression of it. Not for F. J. McCormick the Coquelin i. way. The exigencies of repertory saw to it that his creations came from the soul out, and that they came — had to come — at speed. Lear, Oedipus, Joxer Daly, Burgoyne in “The Devil’s Disciple”, Tanner in “Man and Superman”, George in “The White- headed Boy” — one could go on and on filling pages with the record. On November 27th, 1928, Lady 5 Gregory wrote in her diary. “ ‘Lear’ last night wonderful. McCormick magnificent — there is no other word — all through.” Yet this magnificent Lear was played under many difficulties : difficulties of health — he was far from well at the time ; difficulties of interpretation — it was being presented by a young and enthusiastic guest- producer just back from Germany with a head full of “expressionism”, some fixed ideas about Shakespeare, and a (ft scissors which raced through the text in a manner best expressed in the cutting of “Pray you, undo this button : thank you, sir,1’ from the dying speech of the king. McCormick was worried ; and indeed he had every reason to be. Yet when the night came he was, in spite of nerves and text-mutilation, every inch a Lear — regal, tragic and in the mad scene unsurpassable. When one thinks of the coddling circumstances under which most of the great English actors have played their Lears — the concessions made to their taste ahd fancies, the rehearsals arranged to suit their moods, the stage managers running to their every need, the company shifting their paces to suit the great man’s whim — one thinks again of McCormick and Lady Gregory’s comment. Well might she say “Magnificent!” 9 The Artist F. J. McCormick was a charming unassuming person. Though a professional actor, he was strangely lacking in the flamboyant attributes of the profession. Of medium height, just tall enough for tragedy with keen intelligent well-set and expressive eyes ; a nose slightly aquiline ; a broad, high forehead topping the mobile face, the whole crowned with high-brushed, thick-curling, nut-brown hair; even with this marked equipment of the player, he might, by virtue of his unassuming manner and his severity of dress, have passed in the catalogue of casual glance as a schoolmaster or a bank manager. Yet something in the movement of his sensitive, delicate, white hands would have cried out the artist in him. The Catholic F. J. McCormick was an exemplary Catholic. His attitude to his work was always measured by the yardstick of his Catholic philosophy. There were times when his super-sensitiveness led him into situations in which we, his Catholic colleagues, did not wholly agree with him, but we never doubted his honesty of purpose, nor could we withhold our admiration for his moral courage. Other things being, equal, it was McCormick’s Catholicism that gave him such an insight into the human heart in the creation of his characters. Like other great artists he saw life in relation to an unimaginable beauty and perfection, and for him the desire for that beauty and perfection was the most human of all desires. When he died his newlv-found colleagues in the British film industry paid generous tribute to the man and the actor. Siobhan McKenna’s Tribute I think, however, that one of the finest tributes paid to him (for it embodies a clear picture of the man), was that broadcast by Siobhan McKenna. Since Siobhan herself is known to many film-goers (though they have not yet seen her in the fullness of her ability) 1 quote from it here : “During my schooldays, I sometimes visited Dublin when home on vacation. Invariably that meant a visit to the Abbey Theatre. Consequently I was already an ardent fan of F. J. McCormick when I myself joined the Abbey Company about four years ago. I first saw Peter Judge, however, from a seat in the stalls in the practically empty auditorium during the rehearsal hours. I forget what the play was, but Peter was sitting in a chair on the stage, dressed like — like anyone else, in a greyish frieze coat, a muffler — but looking very different from anyone else. There was that mop of hair, so very thick and inclined to curl, growing from a remarkable brow. It wasn’t quite eleven, so Peter was drinking tea — he was very fond' of his cup of tea. He had a script which he seemed to be talking over with Frank Dermody. “Peter has reminded different people of all sorts of varying professions. Some who met him in the street thought he looked like a lawyer, others a school-teacher, a bank official or a civil servant. I always thought of him as a scholar. He generally wore spectacles 'at the reading of a play and at the first few rehearsals. There was that deep concentration about the brow and eyes, a thoughtful tightening or pursing of the lips at such times, which betokened the specialist and the student. “All this must make you see an unaccustomed and severe picture of your F. J. — or at least a very serious one. Well, that was my first impression of Peter. I was very much in awe of him and, temporarily at least, I had almost forgotten the great comedy roles I had seen him play and thought of him far more as the actor who had played King Lear so magnificently — a part unfortunately which I did not see him do. “There were many things to learn from Peter about my work on the stage — humility, hard work, attention to detail, timing of comedy — but his outstanding gift was his interest and love of all people. Standing in the wings waiting for a cue one night Peter said to me, ‘I often wonder what the people out front think I’m really like — I’m afraid they must think me an awful scoundrel altogether’. Checking up, most of the parts he played when analysed were scoundrels and knaves of the deepest dye — yet the audience loved Fluther, and Rabbit Hamil, Harold Mahony, Joxer and Jimmy Shields. Why ? The answer is simple, Peter had loved them himself. I remember a wonderful remark of Peter’s about some little Jewish children who lived near him. He was commenting on their great beauty and he said : ‘You know, Siobhan, when I see this little lad, I always think that Jesus looked just like him when He was a little boy.’ “F. J. McCormick is an inexhaustible subject — but time is short so I shall end up by telling you a little story about the film world. When they offer you a poor script, they try to make up for it by quoting names of Big Stars to play opposite you. Somehow, it doesn’t work with me, they forget that I have played with one of the greatest actors in the world on the Abbey stage. My big regret is that I never made a film with F. J. — I only brushed shoulders with him in Hungry Hill, but wherever I go, I shall bring his memory and teachings with me.” So spoke Siobhan McKenna in the memorial broadcast on F. J. McCormick. It would be impertinence on my part to sav more. Visual Aids Conference A most successful two-day Conference on Visual Aids was held at Brighton College in November last. Great credit is reflected on the far-seeing Headmaster and his Staff who, in collaboration with G.B. Instructional Ltd., organised in term time and amid considerable obstructions a comprehensive exhibition and series of lectures and film shows. Nearly two hundred delegates, teachers and others, attended the Conference. Among these were representatives from Beaumont College, Brighton Xaverian College, Wimbledon College and various convent schools in the district. J. Arthur Rank, Esq., opened the Conference and, among other things, emphasised the need for research into the best ways of using films for children, whether as entertainment or as educational aids. He said that efforts were being made to try to produce films for children more cheaply than had hitherto been the case. Among the talks given, one of the most stimulating was the first, by Mr. Hubert Butler, Headmaster of Huyton Hall School, Atnbleside. He insisted on the use of the film in school and out of it and said that films helped youngsters to other mediums : they read novels after seeing films ; they were interested in other lands after seeing geographical films ; they learnt true history after seeing “historical” films. He mentioned the merits of such films as Tawny Pipit and Captains Courageous. Mr. Butler then showed two most interesting films made by his school, one a comedy acted by the boys, the other, the beginnings of what is intended to be a visual record of the school. Some delightful scenes of an expedition will be of interest to pupils in the future who will be able to add 7 their own contribution to the school film record. G. J. Cons stressed the need for teachers to take an interest in educational film production. The Rev. A. J. Watts, Diocesan Adviser in Religious Education for Oxford gave a very stimulating and entertaining lecture on home-made visual aids. Using a number of “gadgets” which he had himself devised, he showed how even abstruse 'doctrinal subjects can be assisted by a judicious use of visual charts, etc. Dr. Watts had very little good to say about films on religious subjects. He insisted that films used for instruction should be not only artistically good but accurate. Miss Mary Field gave an informative talk on the recent development in Children’s Entertainment Films. Having described the work of the Rank subsidised venture which came to an end last year as an adventure, she said that “episode 2” was now about to begin with the Children’s Film Foundation (of which she is the chief director and producer). She said that all the research which they had accumulated in the five years since the venture first began would be of the greatest use in producing films for the future. Children’s films are to be considered as informal education, in contrast to the formal education which is received in the classroom. It was no part of the policy of children’s films to give moral instruction : that is the proper function of the home circle ; but properly made children’s films can give moral education by example. Children want the “best” films in both senses and it is the hope of the Children’s Film Foundation to be able to provide them. One of the most interesting and useful sessions of the Conference was a “Brains Trust” on religious films. The team was composed of Rev. C. K. Brown (Headmaster of Woolpit School), Rev. J. A. V. Burke (C.F.I.j, R. N. F. Evans, Esq. (Religious Films Ltd.), Rev. A. J. Watts and Rev. E. Youdell (Associate Secretary, World Council of Christian Education). The Chairman was the Headmaster of Brighton College and the questions centred mainly round the point as to whether commercial enterprise was the most suitable for the purpose of religious film exploitation. A large selection of films was shown concurrently at the Blessed Sacrament Convent, Brighton, and the Large Hall, Brighton College. Among the films shown on behalf of the C.F.I. were Vatican , Crucifers To Walsingham, Safe In His Own Home, Legend of Norfolk and Triptych. A supply of film strips was also available for inspection. Practical demonstrations of various methods of showing films in school- rooms were given. Mr. Bartram, visual aids officer of Kent County Council, spoke from a large experience on the many problems which beset the teacher who makes use of film in education. He was emphatic in pleading for the use of rear-projection units in classroom work. Daylight projection, he said, is both cheaper, better for discipline and healthier. It is not essential to have back projection for daylight screening but the screen has to be small and the picture without too much detail. Many projectors and accessories were on view. These were shown by G.B. Equipments Ltd., Stableford Screens Ltd., and other manufacturers. The G.B. 609 was the projector used during the conference and was much admired by the teachers. A new G.B. tape recorder with a playing time of one hour excited much interest.

User and Enthusiast A film which will interest those who want a Catholic support for an entertainment programme is There Was a Laud, running for 20 minutes, monochrome, consisting of a compilation of Polish news reel shots. The film was made for the benefit of the Polish exiles in this country and reminds us of the terrible sacrifices which these gallant people have made in the cause of liberty and true democracy. The film is available in both 35mm. and 16mm. A share of the hiring charge goes to support Polish charities. A biographical film which has not had the public interest it deserves is The Man in White (not to be confused with the British comedy Man in the White Suit), which tells the story of Henri Durant, the founder of the International Red Cross. It stars Jean Louis Barrault, Bernard Blier and Helene Perdriere. It runs for 90 minutes. Much of the sound track is dubbed in English. Those who like a broad, Lancashire type of comedy will probably find The Cure for Love to their taste. It runs for 98 minutes and stars Robert Donat as an army sergeant on leave trying to disentangle his prospective matrimonial affairs. Odette is probably too well known to need much introduction. It is now available on 16mm., but is, obviously, too harrowing for anything but adult audiences. Seven Days to Noon, too, is now ready for the 16mm fans. Its story of an atomic physicist who, as a result of religious scruples, threatens to destroy London, is one of the most gripping thrillers ever made. An amusing version of Golgol’s famous Russian comedv is The Inspector General, with Danny Kaye, rather surprisingly, in the title role. It runs for 101 minutes. Another comedv is the endearing tale of a six foot white rabbit, Harvey, with James Stewart and Josephine Hull. It runs for 104 minutes. A film for the youngsters as well as their parents is The Magnet (80 minutes), about a boy whose efforts to return a magnet which he has unfairly taken from a smaller boy lead him into all manner of surprising consequences. It stars Kay' Walsh, Stephen Murray and young William Fox. A comedy-drama involving the amateur detective efforts of Rosamund John and Derrick de Marney is She Shall Have Murder (90 minutes).

Section) 157 VICTORIA STREET LONDON, S.W.1 9 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING The Annual General Meeting of the Catholic Film Institute was held at the Challoner Club, London, S.W.3, on December 5th. Mgr. T. Croft-Fraser was in the Chair. After the Honorary Secretary and Honorary Treasurer had read their reports, various interventions were made from the floor before the Reports were adopted. Mr. John Gell said that in view of the need of publicity for the aims and objects of the C.F.I., would it not be a good thing to ask the Catholic Press to give more space to the work of the Institute. The Honorary Secretary said that, indeed, it would be most valuable but that the Catholic Press was so short of space that unless stories had some sensational quality about them they were liable to be by-passed. He was anxious that any idea that Focus was competing with the Catholic Press should be dissipated. The Catholic Film Institute concerns itself to working in collaboration with any publication which helped to fulfil the w'ishes of Pius XI about promoting good motion pictures. Mr. Gell said that publicity in the cinema trade Press would be useful, to which the answer, again, was that any publicity w'hich the Institute could get would be valuable so long as it was constructive. At the moment the C.F.I. is quite unable to pa}' for publicity. Father H. A. C. Connell asked how interest in the doings of the C.F.I. might best be stimulated. It was replied that the clergy were the greatest potential source of publicity but that many priests were too busy to undertake further efforts on behalf of the Institute. Gratitude was expressed to the many priests who make a special effort to sell Focus and tell their people about it. It was suggested that Focus might become more comprehensive in its appeal by covering Television and Radio. The Hon. Secretary replied that this would be a good idea but involved expense to begin with which at the moment it was not possible to envisage. However, he mentioned that a discussion was in progress with the B.B.C. and a group of well-known Catholic personalities with the object of setting up a Religious Television Service and it might well be that Focus could take advantage of the situation and devote a page or two to covering television programmes of Catholic interest. Mr. Arthur Leslie suggested that in order to get funds, more film programmes should be arranged. In reply it was said that only shortage of voluntary staff prevented this and other similar methods of propaganda being a regular feature of C.F.I. work. However, a special effort would have to be made in the New Year to make sure that such shows were forthcoming. In reply to a suggestion from the priest in charge of the Swansea Film Group, the Hon. Secretary said that they would be most grateful for any financial assistance from the regional groups. So far no attempt had been made to try to bring any pressure to bear upon the provincial groups because it was felt that the C.F.I. in London should exercise only a co-ordinating function but needless to sav, if any of the local groups, who specialise in arranging film shows, would care to organise a “benefit” on behalf of the C.F.I. Secretariat, such help would be most gratefully received.

Producer: Samuel Goldwyn. Director: Mark Robson. Distrib- utors: R.K.O. Radio Pictures. Certificate-. U. Category-. B. Running time : ioi minutes. The chief interest of this film lies in its actuality. It shows the reactions of the members of a normal American family to the war in Korea : the same sort of thing must be happening in scores of American homes today. This being so, I regret that it is not a better picture. Sentimentality has been laid on too thick : a large amount of time is spent meeting or saying goodbye to various members of the family at railway stations, accompanied by the usual hugs of welcome or farewell ; there is a great deal of unnecessary kissing and some of the love-making, though quite harmless, is too protracted. The stars do not shine particularly bright (it is high time Mr. Farley Granger gave up playing his brother-in-law parts), but there is some good work by Robert Keith and Mildred Dunnock as the parents of the two young men who go off to fight, and a delightful study by Martin Milner of a boy soldier old enough to be called up, but not to be served with beer at a public bar. I am slightly mystified about the title : presumably every woman would prefer her men-folk to remain at home instead of joining up, but surely no woman would want them to hold back. Presumably one is intended to understand it in the sense of everyone wanting them to return safelv. T. C. F. ENCORE The stills below are from ENCORE, which was re- viewed by T.C.E. in last issue oj FOCUS. Nigel Patrick is called on to adopt the guise of a barman II THE LIGHT TOUCH Starring: Stewart Granger, Pier Angeli, George Sanders. Producer: Pandro S. Berman. Director: Richard Brooks. Distributors: M. - G. - M. Certificate : A. Category: A. Running time: 107 minutes. 9 There is not much of the light touch about this film. It is marked with the heavy fist of cynicism. Not even good cynicism. It is Shaw without Shaw’s brilliance and originality. As a story — a sort of derivative of The Comedy Of Errors — it is interesting enough ; it is lively and pictorially well-told ; it has its seconds of mild suspense and self-conscious wit ; the acting of Stewart Granger, Pier Angeli and George Sanders with his restful, cultured individual voice give it prestige ; but as a whole it lacks character. Any fool can play the mocker. This film is stiff with mockery. Love, marriage, truth, art, honour, all come under the scoffers’ lash; so much so that I have no doubt that those chaps who have a grudge against life will lap it up with avidity. In short, the story is about a painting which Stewart Granger steals for George Sanders, his partner in crime. Granger double-crosses Sander.-, and then goes in for all sorts of weird and wicked exploitations. He exploits the heart and the art of Pier Angeli, he gets her to make copies of the original painting, which is supposed to be lost, and endeavours to sell them as originals to fellows who think they know all about art. But, Pier Angeli is not the little innocent angel that Granger believes her to be. She out- wits him — beautifully. How ? It is not my business to tell you that. As a concession (perhaps to Catholic taste ?) bad boy Granger makes good ; he contacts a priest through the confessional aiid the beautiful oil- painting by the renaissance artist Benetti is restored to its rightful place on the altar of a church in Taormina.

Rome and Assisi are two places which every Catholic loves if he has visited them and longs to see if he has not. What, therefore, could delight a Catholic heart more than a film which was actually shot in both those places and, what is more, in their chief monuments, the Basilica of St. Francis and its adjoining friary (commonly known as the Sacro Convento) in Assisi and the Basilica of St. Peter and the Vatican Palace in Rome ? Incidentally the fact that the Vatican authorities co-operated so wholeheartedly in the making of it must be to us Catholics its greatest recommendation. Simple and Touching I say its greatest, for it has recommendations of all sorts. The story is a simple and touching one of a little orphan boy in Assisi who wishes to take his sick donkey to be cured at the tomb of St. Francis. When permission is refused him he sets off to Rome with the hope of obtaining it from the Pope himself. The tale will be familiar to all readers of Paul Gallico’s book, “The Little Miracle”, on which the film is based. The photography is superb, whether in the scenes of the two cities or in the Umbrian country, amid the olives; so much so that the present reviewer, to whom they are as familiar as is London to a Londoner* suffered acute nostalgia when he saw them. The little 'boy, Vittorio Manunta, is utterly charming and the rest of the cast good (except possibly for those members of it who impersonate priests somewhat unconvincingly). A word of compliment should be paid to that 13 Fr. Damico (Denis O'Dea) reasons with Pepino who wants to take his donkey to the tomb of St. Francis 14 unconscious but delightful actress, Violetta the donkey. Enchanting Scenes Memories of enchanting scenes linger : the Basilica of St. Francis seen through an archway in a blaze of sunlight ; glimpses of Giotto’s immortal frescoes in the upper church ; the trusting love on a child’s face as he prays for his sick cat which he, more lucky than our hero, has managed to smuggle to St. Francis’ tomb; the hero himself led by a friar through the cloisters and courtyards of the Sacro Convento to Father Guardian’s cell ; or dodging a custodian behind an immense piece of statuary in one of the Vatican galleries; or singing an old Italian song as he drives his donkey-cart along an Umbrian road — these and a thousand other pictures crowd the memory and make one long to see the film again and yet again. But attempts at description are useless. Go, with your whole family of whatever age and with all your friends, and see for yourself one of the most beautiful pictures ever screened ; so amazingly beautiful, first and foremost, because it is so utterlv Catholic. T. C. F. WESTWARD THE WOMEN Starring: Robert Taylor, Denise Darcel, Henry Nakamura and Leonore Lonergan. An M.-G.-M. Picture. Director: William Wellman. Certificate : U . Category: B. Running time : no minutes. America was the scene, not a century ago, of many barbaric and primitive expeditions, undertaken to open up and develop vast tracts of land. Not the least primitive was the astonishing pilgimage in which 150 women made the 2,000 mile trek from Chicago to California to offer themselves as wives to the men who had built up successful ranches in the fruitful Californian valleys. Most of the journey was made on foot, through difficult country, over mountain ranges, in peril of Redskins, across arid deserts. They were guided by a tough, experienced scout, Buck Wyatt, whose main preoccupation was to keep the fifteen men who assist him from fraternising with the women. Eventually the men desert the party leaving only Buck and a Japanese cook to lead the women. Buck forces them to learn to shoot, to deal with cattle, to haul their heavy waggons over the grim Death Valley. Two thirds of the women survive to help build up the families of California. The film is in the tradition of the pioneering, rough, covered-waggon stories. It is different in that we have not before seen women toughened up and treated like mules. Making allowance for the exaggeration which the director indulges in to point his narrative, the film evidently contains enough of truth to cause us to reflect with admiration on the heroic qualities of the men and women who so recently founded the outposts of that vast nation which now makes a boast of its modernity and concern for civilisation. The photography, as always in Western films, is grand and the acting, on a large and showy scale, is in keeping with the spirit of the pioneering story. Robert Taylor is successful in suggesting the crude but trustworthy character of the scout and the women, of all types and sizes, adequatelv surround him. V. MY FAVOURITE SPY Starring: Bob Hope, Hedy Lamarr. Producer: Paul Jones. Director: Norman Z. McLeod. A Para- mount Picture. Certificate : U . Category : C. Running time : 93 minutes. Provided that you are a Bob Hope fan you will revel in his latest adventures, when under police orders he impersonates a ruthless assassin and international spy. Needless to say he outwits all his opponents and ends by marrying the glamorous adventuress who, having done her best to get him killed, falls madly in love with him. I thought that Francis L. Sullivan was miscast as one of the gang of villains. T. C. F. 15 ANOTHER MAN’S POISON Starring: Bette Davis, Gary Merrill, Emlyn Williams, with Anthony Steel, Reginald Beckwith, Edna Morris, Barbara Murray. Producer: Daniel M. Angel. Director: Irving Rapper. Distributors: Eros Films Ltd. ^ Certificate: A. Category: A. Running time : 90 minutes approx. This is an unpleasant film, but quite harmless because of its melodramatic absurdity. It is a tale of a pre-naturally callous women who has just poisoned her criminal husband secretly returned to her after an absence of time. The dead man’s confederate comes a few hours after the murder and, after a series of counter threats between the man and the woman, a common instinct for safety makes for their disposal of the bod\\r and his impersonation of the victim. The two of them sulk and threaten and hate for the rest of the allotted time, which ends when the persistent officiousness of a veterinary surgeon sets in motion a certain action which will bring the corpse to light. The husband’s supplanter dies in precisely the same way — by poison. The wife dies after fainting and being given the flask of poison in the attempt to revive her. She dies in a paroxysm of hysterical laughter. So you see the wicked do not flourish. That point is made, even if not well made. But it is a tale of treachery of more than one kind, of violence and of deceit. It is an education in elocution to hear Bette Davis speak her lines. She was repeatedly referred to as a woman of the greatest attraction, yet she courageously allowed herself to be ^ made up in a way which made that hard to believe — for a more vile and less attractive female I’ve never seen in films. Which goes to show what a capable actress she is. The principal man too went doggedlv on with his sullen menacing part, having been given not a \" single opportunity for charm or attractiveness. It was a relief to find that one of the principals, our own Emlyn Williams, had a part to play which was thoroughly human. With his deft touch he made the most of what humour there was. A waste of good actors, and the better they played their parts the more absurd the whole thing appeared. Don’t waste time on it. X. NIGHT WAS OUR FRIEND Starring: Elizabeth Sellars, Michael Gough, Ronald Howard and Marie Ney. Director: Michael Anderson. Distributors: Monarch Films. Certificate: A. Category: B. Running time: 60 minutes approx . This is what is known in the trade as a “quickie”. It was made on a slender budget in a very short time. I can never understand why such a film has to be also so often incompetently made. In the present case there is a welcome sign of some intelligence and care being given both by the director and the players to what is intended primarily as a programme filler. The story is of a husband, presumed dead, turning up to find his wife in love with a young doctor. The husband has become demented as a result of his experiences in thy jungle and eventually commits suicide after his wife has made an attempt to kill him to prevent his incarceration in a criminal asylum. Morally, of course, the story is indefensible, and one wonders to what extent audiences are likely to be impressed by the muddled thinking which moves the characters in their attitude to life and death, marriage and fidelity. Elizabeth Sellars shows promise of future film success as the wife; Michael Gough tends to overplay as the demented husband; Ronald Howard, in the role of the doctor, shows a growing power as an actor, and Marie Ney moves through the film with her accustomed air of royal competence as the wife’s mother. V. 16 This film will serve to introduce most English cinema-goers to the works of an American novelist who died in 1900 at the age of twenty-nine years with an output of twelve volumes, but whose success derived from one novel, the source of the present film. Stephen Crane, born in New Jersey in 1871, was engaged as correspondent for the “New York Journal” in the Graeco- Turkish war of 1897 and in the Spanish- American war as a result of writing The Red Badge of Courage, a story about the American Civil War. When he wrote it he could have known nothing of war from personal experience. Nevertheless, the novel succeeds in isolating and defining in an uncannily accurate manner the reactions of a young farm boy as a recruit in the Northern Army in the Civil War. He is afraid of being afraid. He loses his nerve and runs away in the heat of battle, then regains it again and leads a successful charge, bearing the flag which he has seized from the hands of the fallen colour-bearer. Its Merits The merit of the film is that it persuades us to accept as human and recognisable beings the characters in the story. They are individual persons, not types, and by the end of the film we feel we know them intimately. There are some moments of acute observation which the camera under- lines for us. The death of The Tall Soldier ; the gesture by which The Boy allows the enemy flag to flutter over its dying bearer before carrying his THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE Starring: Audie Murphy, Bill Maudlin, Douglas Dick and John Dierkes.

Running time: 69 minutes. own colours to victory ; the queer tricks of light by which distant enemy soldiers are seen as unreal phantoms until proximity makes them both real and exaggeratedly monstrous. Yet the film is not a long one and ironically enough, in spite of its excellence as a film, is causing its distributors some difficulties in placing it. It is not long enough for a first feature : it is too good for a second ! It is absurd to suppose that a film, any more than a novel, must conform to a pre-determined length before it can be successful or stand a chance at the box-office. How long is a good film ? How many words in a first-class novel ? This is an illustration of the pernicious effects of the mechanical gearing of film distribution upon artistic freedom in the cinema. Its Integrity John Huston, who produced and directed the film and wrote the screen- play, is one of the major personalities in the American cinema. To him must go the major share of praise for a beautifully executed film, though one may be allowed the lifting of an eyebrow to hear him, in the introductory commentary, speak as if the author took part in the campaign. He gives us an insight into the mind of the ordinary soldier, his bewilderment at the seemingly formless battle arrangements; his amazement to learn that other men were fighting elsewhere with equal rights to think of themselves as at the core of the battle ; his secret fears, his lack of resentment when he finds that his foe is also human and speaks the same language. 17 therefore his brother; the film would, presumably, have us understand that the men from Rome or London or Vladivostok are also brothers, though the}' do not speak the same language. This is the lesson which the cinema could and should more often teach. The players, all new names to me, bring a sincerity and conviction to their parts and help to make this a film to be looked for and asked for as something worth taking trouble to see ; good for its cinematic qualities as for its thought-provoking impact. V. WEEK-END WITH FATHER Starring: Van Heflin, Patricia Neal and Gigi Perreau. Producer: Ted Richmond. Director: Douglas Sirk. A Universal-International Picture. G.F.D. Release. Certi- ficate : U. Category : C. Running time : 83 ' minutes. Things tend to get tense, complicated and boisterously bewildering when a young and attractive widow (Patricia Neal) blessed ( ?) with a couple of uncontrollable young sons and a very obedient dog, makes a match with a widower of 36 (Van Heflin), who is endowed with two sophisticated daughters and another very obedient dog. Things tend to get tense, I say, and they do. And you can guess the kind of complications that arise. Will her sons approve of their new dad ? They do not. And the girls like their new mum ? Not at all. For you must know that they are very noisy modern and precocious children who must have their say in the twangiest of trans- Atlantic twangs. We only hope that these children will not be the models of our youth who see them. Gigi Perreau, as the girl of “eleven just”, acts until a deal of accomplishment, with all the airs and graces of a mature woman of 35. She has none of the glucose sweetness of the child star, but she is cute enough and to spare. The dogs, on the other hand, are paragons of virtuous behaviour. You will shed no tears during this film, either of pathos or of mirth, for there is nothing pathetic here, nor is the laughter ribald enough. But I think you will be gently amused at this comedy and you should like it. It is as true as a picture of the ordinary soldier, one supposes, as of all soldiers that have ever gone fearfully into battle ; of the men who fought under Alexander, under Caesar, under Henry V at Agincourt, under Wellington, Haig, Montgomery or Eisenhower. Its Impact Perhaps it is too easy for the man from Texas to learn that the man from Ohio talks the same language and is G. 18 THE HOUSE IN THE SQUARE Starring: Tyrone Power, Ann Blyth, Michael Rennie, Dennis Price, with Beatrice Campbell, Ray- mond Huntley, Kathleen Byron and Irene Browne. Director: Roy Baker. A 20th Century-Fox Film. Certificate : U . Category : B. Running time: 91 minutes. Based on John Balderston’s play, “Berkeley Square”, this film version is a long way away from the charming fantasy which Leslie Howard brought so appealingly to the screen in 1933. We are now in the Atomic Age and Peter Standisli is an American scientist who, having read the diaries of his eighteenth century ancestor who lived in Berkeley Square in 1784, wishes himself back in that leisurely and civilised age. A thunderbolt conveniently deposits him in technicolored eighteenth-century costume on the doorstep of a house that is expecting him to arrive from America in 1784. Once back in the past, Peter proceeds to act very stupidly by talking of events that have not yet happened and so gets a reputation for diabolical dabblings. He is being taken to a lunatic asylum when another convenient thunderbolt returns him to the 20tli century and a conviction that the present age is a more comfortable one in which to live. The film lacks subtlety and is rendered absurd by the precocious mixture of the theological and scientific cliche which is trotted out to justify the passage back to a technicolored past from a monochrome present. To play tricks like confusing Dr. Johnson with modern epigrams and frightening Joshua Reynolds with prophecies about his uupainted pictures smacks of the fourth-form amateur thriller and can hardly be tolerated as serious cinema. Mark Twain’s “Yankee at King Arthur’s Court” is accepted because it is frankly farcical. The House in the Square, on the other hand, is pretentious nonsense. The principal players are unevenly matched. Tyrone Power as Peter repeats his well-known fancy dress role. Ann Blyth tried to look as if she believed in her part as the only eighteenth century character who can accept electric light as natural. Raymond Huntley plays an unsympathetic part with a conviction which even extended to a burst into Latin when he thinks that Peter is from the devil. Beatrice Campbell, Dennis Price and Irene Browne try but fail to make the best of unbelievable characters in fancy dress. How rarely, incidentally, do British actors wear period costume with conviction ! Irish and French players, on the other hand, - carry it as to the manner born. There V is probably some interesting theorv connected with social history under- lying this fact. V. LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE Starring: Ruth Roman, Richard Todd, Mercedes McCambridge, Zachary Scott. Producer: Henry Blanke. Director: King Vidor. Distrib- utors: Warner Brothers. Certificate: A. Category: A. Running time: 90 minutes. In Texas a man was tried twice over for murdering his wife and eventually freed because the jury could not agree. A girl who falls in love with him afterwards has a feeling that he is innocent, but is not always quite sure. And she means to find out. The film begins well in a leisurely- way. The scenery' is interesting and unusual. I didn’t know what was going to happen next and settled down quietly for an hour or so’s recreation. But before the end the picture dissolves into conventional cinema. The background begins to look bogus. In an atmosphere of expensive hospitality Ruth Roman and Richard Todd look more and more like Margaret Lockwood and Franchot Tone. And melodrama sets in. I spotted the murderer in good - time and then lost interest. V There is a priest who appears from time to time, going about his pastoral duties. And in spite of usually relying on horse transport when other people have cars, he is on the spot before the murderer dies, remarking, in the matter of fact way we do : “So that was all right”. Q- 19 THE RAGING TIDE Starring: Shelley Winters, Richard Conte, Charles Bickford. Director: George Sherman. Universal International Picture. Certificate: A. Category: B. Running time: 82 minutes. There is more excitement in the title of this film than in the story, the major portion of which takes place on the water front, and not at sea as might be expected. After a stock opening shot of one racketeer murdering another, the murderer, Bruno Felkin (Richard Conte) fails to make an alibi of his girl friend and finds the only exit from San Francisco open to him is by stowing away on a trawler. The owner is having trouble with his son about fishing, and on being discovered and allowed to remain aboard, F'elkin thrashes the son Carl, ropes him into his particular racket, mixing crookedness with humanity in quite a likeable way. However, his girl friend (Shelley Winters) falls for Carl and Felkin, torn between framing Carl for the murder and friendship for Carl’s father, eventually jumps into the sea to save Carl and is himself drowned. Richard Conte is a good enough actor to carry the story through convincingly. He is well supported bv two character parts played by Charles Bickford and John McIntyre. But the film never rises very high. It is good entertainment without many thrills and with some attractive human patches. M. LULLABY ON BROADWAY Starring: Doris Day, Gene Nelson and Billy de Wolfe. Producers: Warner Brothers. Director: David Butler. Certificate : U . Running time : 90 minutes. This film is a re-hash but it is still interesting to notice the tricks Hollywood uses to give grandeur and romance to the trivial and commonplace. A picture of a liner is flashed on to the screen and by the association of ideas the subsequent sequences give the illusion that everything takes place on the high seas. Again, an upright piano is pushed into a room and hey, presto ! you are in the audition rooms of a famous Broadway producer. This film is mainly valuable to learn how to obtain the best effects from the smallest outlay, should you start making films yourself. The energetic Doris Day keeps the film moving at a great pace and Billy de Wolfe supplies the pathos and humour. Most of the time, you feel you are at a variety show and apart from a suggestive routine dance or two, the music, the songs and the dances are easy on the eye and ear and unobjectionable. O. MEET ME AFTER THE SHOW Starring: Betty Grable and Macdonald Carey, with Rory Calhoun and Eddie Albert. Director: Richard Sale. A 20th Century-Fox Film. Certificate : U . Category : A . Running time : 87 minutes. Of all the formulas used in film shows the most difficult to vary must be the back-stage story. It has to be a really good piece of work to rouse any enthusiasm 011 my part and in the present case I was not impressed. It has some interesting dance photography ; it also has some suggestive sequences in which, for a change, the unclothed male form is exploited. Betty Grable is jealous when she learns that her husband’s new show is being financed by a glamorous red-head. She pretends to have lost her memory and proposes to marry another admirer. In his efforts to circumvent this the husband is hit on the head bv his now-repentant wife and he loses his memory. I only wish I could, in my turn, lose my memory, at least as far as this film is concerned. Doubtless I shall. The cavalier attitude to the bond of marriage manifested by most of the characters in the story will not escape the notice of those who think that films have an influence on the public. Or is this to take the film too seriously ? V. 20 CONTINENTAL FILMS THREE TELEGRAMS Starring: Gerard Gervais, Pierrette, Henry Cremieux, Olivier Hussenot and Jacques Parride. Director: Henry Decoin. Distributors: Film Traders Ltd. Certificate : U . Category : C. Running time : 82 minutes. Among the films which have held their places in the memory most tenaciously it will often be found that they have had certain characteristics in common : a simple plot, a brief passage of time during which the story is worked out, logical development and uncomplicated characters and a simple treatment of the whole film. So, for example, Odd Man Out, Brief Encounter, Bicycle Thieves, Morning Departure and Strange Interlude. Though there may have been faults of structure and a straining of credibility, such blemishes are overlooked in the satisfaction generated by a compact composition. Though Three Telegrams is by no means among the greatest of French films, it is certainly one of the most enjoyable and that precisely because it shares the qualities which I have mentioned. Nothing could be simpler than the story of a new boy at the telegraph office who is sent out late one afternoon to deliver three telegrams, one addressed to a Very Important Person. The boy is knocked down by a lorry and loses his satchel and its contents. The rest of the film consists of the next two hours or so during which every kind of adventure overtakes him before he recovers his telegrams. The children of the Rue Mouffetard and their parents, the local schoolmaster, the Superintendent of Police, the Fire Station, to say nothing of the inevitable Greek Chorus to be found assisting at any Parisian “incident”, all take a part in the comedy. There are many delightful asides at the expense of the average Parisian worker and civil servant. There is social comment directed at the parents whose children are able to wander around aimlessly getting into scrapes : an intriguing performance here by little Pierrette Simonet as a precocious boy - hunting girl. The saucy uninhibited remarks of the bystanders remind us that we are in France though no one, I hope, could be seriously offended. The children act splendidly, even the small part players, and I am sure that many a family audience will enjoy this light-hearted and beautifully photographed film. V. MISS JULIE C Starring: Anita Bjorlt, Ulf Palme and Anders Henrikson Director: Alf Sjoberg. Distributors: British Lion. Certificate-. A. Category : A . Running time : go minutes approx . It distresses me to note that the critics whom I regard with greatest veneration have given unqualified approval to this film. It distresses me because I cannot see where I have gone wrong. To me it is a mixture of superb photograph}’, masterly crowd direction, imaginative use of flashback, incomprehensible plot and the most self-conscious and stagy acting I have seen on the screen in a long while. Perhaps I am paying too little attention to the influence of August Strinberg, the psychopathological Swedish author whose play this is. He was a writer whose satirical and cynical work made him very unpopular with the Swedish people and his outrageous attacks on the Christian religion in the series of stories of married life brought him to court to answer a charge of blasphemy. A confirmed misogynist, he projects into his novels and plays his hatred of women and his contempt for marriage. In Miss Julie we are confronted with a typical gathering of his perverted and neurotic characters. Julie, the daughter of a Count flirts with a manservant and allows him to seduce her. Coming to her senses, she tells r of her unhappy childhood in which a '■ perverted mother caused her to be treated as a boy and taught to hate all men-folk. The manservant, too, tells of his miserable youth and then, having declared his love for her, insists that their union is impossible and hands her the ■ razor with which she cuts her throat. This monstrous film is to some extent redeemed by the beauty of the camera work and the charm of the children who play the flashback sequences, but I can find nothing to commend in the acting of Ulf Palme as the manservant nor, indeed, in the acting of the other male players. Anita Bjork, as Julie, is appealing but the variations of expression and mood are beyond her powers at present. Directed by the man who made Frenzy, this film is, in spite of its Festival Award, hardly the stuff on which national reputations for film artistry can be sustained. V. DOCUMENTARIES THE GLASGOW ORPHEUS CHOIR Producer and Director: George Hoellering. Distributors: Film Traders Ltd. Certificate : U . Category: C. Running time: 20 minutes approx. A delightful film both visually and aurally, we are told that it is “the first in a series which will bring the Orpheus Choir to the screen singing their best-known and loved songs”. George Hoellering took the occasion to film this choir before it disbanded after more than fifty years of first-class musical achievement. This is an excellent example of the cinema doing a service to posterity by letting us both hear and see this famous choir. Sir Hugh Roberton, the genial conductor and creator of the Choir is seen in action and heard introducing some of his pieces. A film to be seen and enjoyed again and again. We look forward to others like it. V. VISIT TO PICASSO Script, Commentary and Direction by Paul Haeserts. Distributors: Film Traders Ltd. Certificate : U . Category: B.

Here is an example of a film which should do much to resolve the often uninformed discussion about one of the world’s leading avant-garde painters. One has the privilege of seeing Picasso actually at work before our eyes, executing a number of designs in white paint on a sheet of glass so placed that the camera sees the work in progress without interruption. The film provides a survey of the artist’s work in many fields and styles : realist, surrealist, cubist, abstract and romantic. The camera may even be said to aid the viewer in understanding something of the significance of some of the more difficult pieces for the consecutive and rhythmic treatment underlines points which casual examination might be said sometimes to overlook. Certainly a film to be seen if you want to talk intelligently about Picasso. V. C.F.I. NOTES 16mm. Section Meeting In our last issue the date of this meeting was incorrectly given.

BOOK REVIEW 23 The Film in Education* Plato looked askance even at diagrams in mathematics, considering them as hindrances to the acquisition of pure eternal truths. What would he think of this latest pandering to sense — knowledge — moving diagrams ? His 0 pupil, Aristotle, would be more sympathetic, seeing in the film that image which accompanies all our knowledge. But the image is not knowledge and the film, like the image, is simply an aid to knowledge. It should not be a substitute for thinking, but rather what Plato would call the “occasion of thought”. The acquiring of knowledge is never easy. The A.B.C. will always have to be learnt, as well as weights and measures, poetry, etc., and the film can do little to sweeten these pills. There may be' even danger in the facile presentation of information rendered possible by the film. The author himself says : “The mind soaks up subject matter on the screen as effortlessly as a sponge soaks up water,” and the cynic might be inclined to add, “and can be squeezed out just as easily — possibly by the next film seen.” Even granted the important role of films in the spread of information, information is not education ; for one thing, a synthesis has still to be made of the information acquired. Mr. Buchanan is an enthusiast for the use of films in education and takes as self- evident their benefits, without dallying on the questions of what is knowledge and what is education. He is, however, aware of the limitations of the film in the field of education, stating that : “Film can strengthen present teaching methods; it cannot supersede them.” He also quotes with approval Mr. Kitson-Clark (an enthusiast for the use ) of films in university education), who gives this sobering caveat to those who may be tempted to see in film- education an open-sesame to effortless knowledge : “Film must never become an easy means of providing shoddy mass education. Gain in one faculty may mean loss in another. University students must still know how to * The Film in Education. By Dr. Andrew Buchanan. (Phoenix House Ltd.; price 25s.) acquire knowledge by reading difficult, and sometimes dull, books. The power to approach reality through words must never be lost.” The book itself presents a wealth of information on every aspect of the educational film, and although it is of necessity technical in part, the author reveals himself as a text-book educationalist as well as a film educationalist and one is never left in doubt as to his meaning. The field already covered by instructional films is revealed as vast and the book gives details of films made for different professions as well as classroom films ; information which will be of immense value to those wishing to make use of these films. For example, the Scientific Film Association and the Royal Society of Medicine undertook cataloguing work in 1946: 1,200 films were indexed, 800 viewed, and a summary of their contents recorded. About five thousand organisations, he tells us, use the Central Film Library in this country, and in 1947 it despatched 92,868 films. The range also of educational films is impressive, from treatment of The Beginnings of History to The French U (an explanation of the movements of the mouth needed to pronounce this most elusive of French vowels). But Mr. Buchanan does not simply list the different types of instructional films, he puts a steady hand on their merits and weaknesses, as when he criticises biblical films as tending to remove religion from today, instead of presenting it as a living reality — “the futility of bringing stained glass windows to life”. A compact history is given of educational films in Great Britain (going back as far as 1896) as well as a survey of what has been accomplished in foreign countries. In fact, an interesting film might be made of the struggles of the documentary enthusiasts in this country who had to operate outside cinemas after the Cinematograph Act of 1927, plying their trade in village halls, in clubs and in vans at street corners. The War, of course, gave a great boost to instructional films, and we are all familiar with the propaganda film which was a regular feature of wartime cinema shows — showing us how to fillet a kipper or capture a Nazi spy — but I am sure that few people know, for example, that in the U.S. armies abroad alone, over 10,500,000 hours of the soldiers’ time were spent each month in seeing War Department training films. U.N.E.S.C.O. now assists the free flow of films, film personnel and film information across national boundaries and there seems the fair possibility of the creation of an adequate international film library under its aegis. The book rightly pays great attention to the role of the teacher in film- education and the necessity of incorporating him or her in the actual work of production. If schools are to get the maximum benefit from educational films, the teachers must observe the directions on the bottle. They must themselves learn how to use the films. Mr. Floyd F. Brooker, Chief of the Visual F.ducation Section of the I'.S. Department of Education lays down some basic rules : (1) Selecting the film in terms of a given unit of subject matter. 1 2) Previewing the film and preparing the lesson which includes it. (3) Preparing the class for the showing of the film. (4) Showing the film. (5) Examining the class for the knowledge derived from the film and the reactions to it. The book gives valuable hints to the teacher who may be called upon to project a film, such as the size of the screen in relation to the hall, the amount of projector light required, how to improve acoustics, etc. The class- room film also presents an excellent opportunity to the teacher to educate the children in film appreciation itself. Enthusiastic as one may be about the educational film, I hope the day is still far off when we shall have acquired the I'.S.S.R. approach to the cinema, where, we are told : “Going to the cinema is regarded more as a cultural experience than an evening’s entertainment. The audience stares at the screen as if attending an important lecture. Its attention seldom wanders.” It makes one think of Stalin’s words : “The cinema in the hands of the Soviet Power represents a great force.” The author recounts how he himself made films for showing to Arabian tribes, the majority of whom had never seen motor vehicles nor the sea and who thought that aeroplanes were real birds. The interesting point is that the films were fully understood by these people. We see what a great force educational films can be and what a danger if run by the wrong people. While enjoying the book and marvelling at the author’s extensive knowledge of his subject, not everyone will go as far as he in enthusiasm for educational films, nor, I think, will many be found to agree with him when he says : “I believe it (the film) will eventually prove itself it be the great educator of the world.” I have a strong suspicion that the student of 1991 will still be cramming from his text-book the night before his exams. Fr. Thaddeus Kidd, O.P'.M. Letter To The Editor Triptych and Art Films Sir, The remarks of “P. R.”. with reference to the film Triptych, are very interesting, but he is evidently unaware that this is by no means the first film to treat of the works of the great masters. There are a number of such films and the names of Luciano Emmer and Enrico Gras deserve to be remembered for having opened up this new field for the cinema. Giotto, the brothers Van Eyck, Memling, Rubens, have all been introduced to the cinema- goer in film analyses similar to that of Triptych. Emmer himself has given us fiims on the frescoes at Assisi, Guiliano Betti has given us a film on Botticelli, as well as Raphael’s Descent from the Cross. Sculpture, too, has been the subject of film treatment : the magnificent Images Gothiqucs of Maurice Cloche and Jean-B'ran^ois Noel’s Lcs Gisants are no less interesting than the camera examinations of the painters. An article in the “International Film Review”, No. 5-6, gives other titles of art films and observes that these works are “milestones along this new road of filming works of art. It is one in which sacred art can find a lesson and a hope.” Yours faithfully, J. A. V.

If I could relate to you some of my adventures and experiences in the larger film world you would not only be astonished, but it would, I think, be as plain to you as it is to me that I was being led by God.” If, in the years to come, some heroic journalist writes the history of The Catholic Film Institute in this country, it will be as plain to you as it is to us that the Institute was led by God. It is true to say that but for the Grace of God it could not have overcome the many obstacles that beset its path . Mr. Arthur Rank has been able to do so much good for the cinema because he is a man of faith and a man of means. The Catholic Film Institute in this country has abundant faith, but — quite literally — it has no funds. The strain of carrying on without means is becoming unendurable. I am taking it upon myself in this editorial to play the beggar, by asking all our readers who believe that films can minister to the faith to help us in our needs. A small present of a few shillings from our friends and patrons would be most welcome in this our hour of need. “The man,” wrote Archbishop Roberts in the International Film Review, “who knows that the cinema of the Christian can become a Christian cinema, that Hollywood itself, under Christian pressure, has done some real good and avoided much evil — such a man will put all he has into fetching through the screen, God’s unsullied gifts to the bodies, minds and hearts of his children.’’ Editor, 28 Our President Sees a Never Take No For An Answer ’ Cardinal Griffin, President of the Catholic Film Institute, attends preview of the film \"Never Take No for an Answer” < Through the courtesy of Independent Film Distributors Ltd., the British distributors of the film, the Catholic Film Institute, were recently able to arrange a special showing of the new film, Never Take No For An Answer, at the private cinema of British Lion in Wardour Street. The film was attended by His Eminence Cardinal Griffin, His Grace the Archbishop of Birmingham, and Bishop Craven, Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster. Also present were Mgr. Morrogh Bernard, Vicar-General of Westminster, Mgr. Croft-Fraser, Chairman of the C.F.I., Mgr. D. M. Worlock, Private Secretary to His Eminence, and Father Gordon Wheeler, University of London Catholic Chaplain.

Croft-Fraser, Mr. Anthony Havelock Allan, Producer of Never Take No For An Answer, and Bishop Craven. 29 HOLLYWOOD IN FOCUS New Religious Film Looms Faithful to Scripture • By William H. Mooring, Because they believe the public is waiting for a great religious film “and there is none as great as the life of Christ”, the brothers Nassour, Edward and William, have decided to produce John Farrow’s “Son of Man”, with Mr. Farrow in charge of story and direction. Edward Nassour, who with his brother William has produced a number of films and built a complete movie studio in Hollywood which later sold to K.T.T.V. one of Hollywood’s major television broadcasters, for $2,500,000, is American born of Lebanese Catholic lineage. The family for several generations has been non-Catliolic and Edward Nassour is a Presbyterian. He recognises, however, that the story of Christ, as written by John Farrow, is the scriptural story of God in the Divine Person of His Son. “As far as I am concerned,” Edward Nassour told me, “The Son of Man is in preliminary production right now. It will take some time to complete, but work will go on without interruption until it is done.” Interesting Plans Plans to film this great story are particularly interesting because they involve an entirely new concept of production as well as a newly patented process of cinematography. _ I am not at liberty to go into details. V The process, in any case, is so highly technical that many would not understand how the new method is applied. Roughly, however, the concept rests upon artistic and impressionistic, rather than realistic backgrounds. The technical system under which colour, form and music are to be blended, provides that the massive backgrounds and the intimate, personal action, may Tidings Motion Picture Editor be filmed separately and later brought together in perfect perspective. The hundreds of background scenes are now being designed by an artist. The cast will be assembled later and the results finally combined. I am told that while Son of Man, in Technicolor, will be visually impressive, emphasis will be laid upon mood and harmony rather than the kind of spectacle favoured in Hollywood’s earlier biblical films. Specially arranged music will serve an important purpose. Nothing ornate will be attempted ; nor will the impressionistic back- grounds reflect modern trends. Costumes will be traditional in line although idealised in colouring. The story, highlighted by outstanding episodes in the earthly Mission of Our Lord, will be integrated by means of a powerful narrative spoken by “The Voice”. This, incidentally, will not be the voice of Sir Laurence Olivier or some other well known actor. Both John Farrow and Edward Nassour contemplate using an unknown man, preferably an unidentified member of the religious, to portray Christ. The intention, I am told, is to stick to scripture and tradition for the story material and to apply artistic imagination only to the technical problems of screening it. catholic , DIVISIONS Equipment • Films- Strips- Catalogues The DAWN TRUST STUDIO — AYLESBURY 30 Catholic Film Shows Some Points To Be Noted The number of parishes which are now showing films as a matter of course is increasing. Some use the film as an addition to the social life of the parish ; some take advantage of a special event in the local life to arrange for a film to be shown ; others think of the film show as a source of income for the parish funds. Which- ever category you may belong to, there are one or two words of warning we would like to address to you. To begin with, there are not enough films of purely Catholic interest to allow of a regular programme of such films. This lack is, we hope, a matter of time. In the meantime there are a large number of films from other sources, both entertainment and instructive, which may usefully be booked by the Catholic film society. Elementary, But . . . One other point which, we hope, will not be taken amiss by the majority of projectionists who are expert at their job ; films can easily be ruined by faulty projection and by failing to keep the projector clean, particularly the gate where fragments of hot wax are likely to coagulate and badly score the film which is being run through. Needless to sav, a sound film must on no account be run through a silent projector. This sounds elementary, but there are a surprising number of people who seem to have tried the experiment ! Another thing : though it is not at all difficult to learn to operate a projector, it does require some tuition. It is not fair to the other users of film to have broken sprocket-holes and torn film to be repaired because someone has been jiggering about with a machine he is unaccustomed to. We remember a convent which had been the recipient of a film projector as a present ; the good nuns ordered some films from us and in answer to our enquiry as to competent projectionists gaily replied : “Oh, we’ll read the directions on the book and work it ourselves!” A fact which we think needs some underlining is that though a film may be suitable both morally and artistically f for adults and, from a Catholic point of view, be most acceptable, that does not mean that it is satisfactory for children to see. In our view there are not many films which we would care to recommend for children. Still less would we be responsible for children viewing some of the films which are ordered by our clients for parish shows. That is not to say that such films are improper; simply that they are adult. Sometimes people write to us and say that such and such a film was not very good for children. They had not previously told us the composition of their audience, so we could hardly be blamed for the fact that children found them incomprehensible. Your Audience For example, we do not consider that Monsieur Vincent, excellent though it is, is suitable for children of a young age. Still less are films like Open City, Four Steps in the Clouds, To Live in Peace, San Francisco, Brief Encounter, Keys of the Kingdom, The Last Chance, The Search, good as they are, suitable for children to see. Even Visitation and Pilgrimage to Fatima , and Crucifers to Walsingham, though we have shown them to audiences of children, require careful verbal introduction in order that they may be understood. So, when you are arranging for a film show, give a thought to the composition of your audience. It may 1 be that you will have to book films that will appeal to family audiences only rather than films that are more thought- provoking. Also, do not be misled into thinking that comic films are all appreciated by youngsters. Will Hay, Abbott and Costello and the Marx Brothers may be funny enough for the little ones ; on the other hand they may not. So find out something about the 31 films you order before you let yourself in for a disappointing evening. A final point : do please allow plenty of time when booking your films. It is not really fair to expect us to be able to secure a film (which may be much in demand) inside a week ! It is also worth noting that our staff, voluntary and paid, do not come to the office on Saturdays and Sundays and that we observe the holydays of obligation ! 16mm. Releases An unusual British, village comedy- drama that should appeal to those who like the English countryside is Ha’penny Breeze (72 minutes), the story of a couple of ex-Service men who transform a derelict village into a yachting centre. The film itself was made under exceptionally difficult conditions by three young men who were determined to succeed in spite of the Wardour Street Jeremiahs. Their adventures would make an interesting script. An American stage-Irish story of the stealing of the Blarney Stone (made before the Scots thought of a similar escapade in Westminster Abbey : any possible connection?) is Top 0’ The Morning. It is light, fantastic, has Bing Crosby, Ann Blyth, Barry Fitzgerald and Eileen Crowe and lasts for 100 minutes. Drama is served with The Browning Version (90 minutes), with an excellent performance from Michael Redgrave as elderly schoolmaster whose self-respect is restored by the touching gift of an understanding schoolboy. Fourteen Hours (92 minutes) is a gripping psychological drama of a young man’s long-delayed decision to jump from a New York sky-scraper. It is suitable only for adult audiences and is interesting rather as a sidelight on what we are to believe is typical American ballyhoo than for any entertainment value as such. Highly Dangerous (88 minutes) shows us ^ Margaret Lockwood as a “bug expert” sent behind the Iron Curtain to bring back a specimen of disease-carrying insects. It is no more far-fetched than a hundred other similar tales and has some hair-raising moments and a really funny ending. The Flame and the Arrow (88 minutes) is also a hair-raiser, set in medieval times, with Burt Lancaster performing breathless circus tricks on roof tops. A long way after the novel by Rider Haggard comes M.-G.-M.’s version in glorious colour of King Solomon’s Mines (102 minutes). It has one of the most breath-taking animal stampedes ever. It also has Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. A first-class musical is Annie Get Your Gun (107 minutes), with Betty Hutton and Howard Keel. It is, in the opinion of many, better than the stage version. It tells of a girl sharpshooter’s deposing of the male champion whom she eventually marries.

Producer: S. P. Eagle. Director: John Huston. Distrib- utors: Independent Film Distrib- utors. Romulus-Horizon Produc- tion. Certificate : U. Category : A. Running time: 103 minutes. Possibly A Great Film The big guns are at work on this film. First, it is from the novel of the same name bv C. S. Forester; then the director of photography is Jack Cardiff and music of Allan Gray is played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Together with the excellent work of Mr. Bogart and Miss Hepburn they certainly give a good film, possibly a great film. It is a story of courage and endurance in scenes of natural grandeur with technicolor at its best. Set in German East Africa in 1914, the action begins with the impact of war upon some English Methodist missionaries, a brother and sister. The brother, a painfully refeened Robert Morley, dies after the destruction of his mission by the Germans. High Adventure His slightly American sister, Katharine Hepburn, is befriended by the captain and sole hand of the “African Queen”, whom she persuades against all his ideas of commonsense to make a course down the rapids into a lake dominated by a German man of war. Her persistent ingeniousness and missish dictatorial manner combine 'What is the meaning of this? How dare you?” British Missionary confronts German Officer Germans set fire to native settlement 33 in overcoming his very reasonable objections to making his steamer, loaded with explosives, an amateurish torpedo, for the time when it will encounter the German vessel. The old “African Queen” has to shoot horribly dangerous-looking rapids and pass under gunfire from a powerful German fort. Marvellous repairs have to be executed. Crocodiles, hippopotami, locusts, leeches, reeds and mud have to be encountered. And in the midst of this rosary of courage the at first rather censorious missionary woman and the hard-boiled seaman naturally, and perhaps a little skittishly, fall in love. A Heroic Story The wild scenery and the purely incidental introduction of animal life give an air of verisimilitude. The slow spatter of rain on the foliage preceding the tropical downpour which releases the mud-bound “African Queen” before she is carried on into the lake, is an example of the film doing in a matter of seconds what it would take minutes to describe. The film is possibly marred by one or two scenes of clowning to raise a laugh. For example, when in the nick of time the German man of war is sunk and the crew are swimming about, the lieutenant in the water salutes the captain when addressing him. It is such irrelevant concessions to comedy which provide the assonance in what was obviously meant to be a great film. Anyway, it is an heroic story well acted, and Katharine Hepburn goes well beyond B. in her gamut of emotions and Bogart is tough without being brutal. X.

A Warner Brothers Picture. Certificate-. A. Category-. A. Running time : ioo minutes approx. Ill Lost Week-end Ray Milland showed us something of the tortures of the confirmed alcoholic. James Cagney treats us to a ringside view of the torture suffered by those who manage to keep off liquor. Apparently nothing and nobody can help you. You have to have reached the stage where you ■“hear angel’s feathers” then you are more scared of death than you are of life and so drill yourself into a liking for soft drinks by keeping a bottle half full of ‘‘conscience tester” in your locker. Good Character Study Whatever the moral and theological limitations of this attitude to a serious personal problem, the film is packed full of incident and character study of the kind inseparable from a Cagney story. His restless, pugnacious, cocky personality is allowed every opportunity to exploit itself in this tale of a newspaper man who wins back his position at the top by dogged persistence after a period of inebriation and is then commanded by the boss to reform his nephew and heir, now on the bottle and mixed up with a gang of crooks. Needless to say, Jimmy does it after a large dose of punching, weeping, face - slapping and other necessary adjuncts to this type of film. Good Dialogue Cagney plays well within the somewhat narrow limits of his style. James Gleason repeats a performance he has often given us as a maudlin, emotional, loyal, “buddy”; this time he is a reformed drunk who helps Cagney on the right way. Raymond Massey gives one of the best studies in the film as the self-confident, arrogant, newspaper proprietor who wishes to leave his “empire” to someone of his own blood. The dialogue is snappy and intelligent if somewhat over smart. I liked the reference to Cagney as a “retired drunk”. Not a film for the family, but an interesting and entertaining piece for those who like their drink neat. V. THE RACKET Starring: Robert Mitchum, Lizabeth Scott, Robert Ryan, with William ( Talman, Ray Collins. Producer: Edmund Grainger. Director: John Cromwell. Distributors: R.K.O. Radio. Certificate: A. Category: A. Running time: 89 minutes. Instead of making notes about this film I only needed to underline words and phrases in the synopsis. They are as follows : crime syndicate, gangsters, racketeer, gunmen, political candidate, crime commission investigators, murder, proposed for the judgeship, the election. This is the sort of picture about gangsters and political corruption which was turned out every week in 1933 or thereabouts, though there was perhaps more emphasis on violence in those days. Crime never pays on the screen, of course; but it doesn’t do so badly at the box office apparently. Q. DOUBLE DYNAMITE Starring: Frank Sinatra, Jane Russell, Groucho Marx. Producer: Irving Cummings Junior. Director: Irving Cummings. Certificate : U . Category : C. Running time : 81 minutes. Frank Sinatra and Groucho Marx have all sorts of incredible and f entertaining adventures in which Jane Russell gets mixed ' up. After innumerable complications and misunderstandings everything comes all right and Frank duly marries Jane, with Groucho as best man. There is an unexpected and amusing little twist at the end. Quite good as light entertainment. T. C. F. 35 MR. DENNING DRIVES NORTH Starring: John Mills, Phyllis Calvert, with Sam Wanamaker, Herbert Lom, Bernard Lee, Wilfrid Hyde White. Producers: Anthony Kimmins and Stephen Mitchell. Director: Anthony Kimmins. Distributors: British Lion. Certificate: A. Category ; B. ™ Running time : 93 minutes. I am always prejudiced in favour of a film which is not content to be merely true to type. And this one has the additional advantage of a cast which includes Raymond Huntley and Freda Jackson, as well as the actors mentioned above, while the director is Anthony Kimmins, the playwright and Naval broadcaster. Accurately Drawn It is with regret therefore that I have to record that I was a little disappointed at first. But if a picture has to be uneven, it is all to the good that it should improve as it goes along. And we seem to get to know and be interested in the aircraft designer, who lives in constant and prolonged fear of being accused of murder, and his charming and devoted wife. I cannot pretend that I liked their daughter and his American suitor, but they are drawn accurately from life. It is quite a long time since some of us have seen Phyllis Calvert and she now appears as the mother of a grown-up (well, almost) daughter. Wilfrid Hyde White is in a more proletarian part than usual, a somewhat ghoulish cemetery attendant whose gramophone plays “I do like to be beside the seaside” as he goes about his work. (‘‘Mackabree, I call it,” as the waitress said.) Michael Shepley skilfully elicits laughs as the chairman 9 of a bench of magistrates. When I see a film I am usually one of the first to laugh when people are not meant to. This time others started to laugh before I did. And then it became apparent that "
