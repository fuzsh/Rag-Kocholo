All the records of growing dogs during a 10-year-period were screened to record the cause of trauma, the age and sex of the animal, the bone involved, the type and location of the fracture, the status of fixation, alignment, maintenance of fixation and fracture healing. The results were analysed and comparisons were made between growing dogs with normal and osteopenic bones. Among the 310 cases of fractures recorded, the bones were osteopenic in 91 cases (29%). Minor trauma was the principal cause of fracture in dogs with osteopenia (25%), and indigenous breeds were most commonly affected (38%). Fractures in dogs with osteopenic bones were most commonly recorded in the age group of 2-4 months (53%), whereas fractures in normal dogs were almost equally distributed between 2 and 8 months of age. Male dogs were affected significantly more often in both groups. In osteopenic bones, most fractures were recorded in the femur (56%), and they were distributed equally along the length of the bone. Whereas in normal bones, fractures were almost equally distributed in radius/ulna, femur and tibia, and were more often recorded at the middle and distal third of long bones. Oblique fractures were most common in both groups; however, comminuted fractures were more frequent in normal bones, whereas incomplete fractures were more common in osteopenic bones. Ninety-nine fracture cases treated with IM pinning (66 normal, 33 osteopenic) were evaluated for the status of fracture reduction and healing. In a majority of the cases (61%) with osteopenic bones, the diameter of the pin was relatively smaller than the diameter of the medullary cavity (<70-75%), whereas in 68% of the cases in normal bones the pin diameter was optimum. The status of fracture fixing was satisfactory to good in significantly more\n\nGeneralized approach for using unbiased symmetric metrics with negative values: normalized mean bias factor and normalized mean absolute error factor\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nUnbiased symmetric metrics provide a useful measure to quickly compare two datasets, with similar interpretations for both under and overestimations.

The aim of this review was to assess the impact of a vegetarian diet on indices of skeletal integrity to address specifically whether vegetarians have a normal bone mass. Analysis of existing literature, through a combination of observational, clinical and intervention studies were assessed in relation to bone health for the following: lacto-ovo-vegetarian and vegan diets versus omnivorous, predominantly meat diets, consumption of animal versus vegetable protein, and fruit and vegetable consumption. Mechanisms of action for a dietary \"component\" effect were examined and other potential dietary differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians were also explored. Key findings included: (i) no differences in bone health indices between lacto-ovo-vegetarians and omnivores; (ii) conflicting data for protein effects on bone with high protein consumption (particularly without supporting calcium/alkali intakes) and low protein intake (particularly with respect to vegan diets) being detrimental to the skeleton; (iii) growing support for a beneficial effect of fruit and vegetable intake on bone, with mechanisms of action currently remaining unclarified. The impact of a \"vegetarian\" diet on bone health is a hugely complex area since: 1) components of the diet (such as calcium, protein, alkali, vitamin K, phytoestrogens) may be varied; 2) key lifestyle factors which are important to bone (such as physical activity) may be different; 3) the tools available for assessing consumption of food are relatively weak. However, from data available and given the limitations stipulated above, \"vegetarians\" do certainly appear to have \"normal\" bone mass. What remains our challenge is to determine what components of a vegetarian diet are of particular benefit to bone, at what levels and under\n\nAssessment of bone turnover markers and bone mineral density in normal short boys.\n\nPubMed\n\nGayretli Aydin, Zeynep GÃ¶kÃ§e; Bideci, Aysun; Emeksiz, Hamdi C; Ãelik, Nurullah; DÃ¶Äer, Esra; Bukan, Neslihan; Yildiz, UmmÃ¼gÃ¼lsÃ¼m; Camurdan, Orhun M; Cinaz, Peyami\n\n2015-11-01\n\nTo investigate whether there is a change in bone turnover-related biochemical markers and bone mineral density of children with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) in the prepubertal period. We measured serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathormone, 25-OH vitamin D, osteocalcin, osteoprotogerin and urinary deoxypyridinoline levels (D-pyd), and bone mineral density (BMD) in 31 prepubertal boys with CDGP. These children were compared with 22 prepubertal boys with familial short stature (FSS) and 27 normal prepubertal boys. Urinary D-pyd was significantly high in CDGP group as compared to control group (p=0.010). Volumetric BMD did not significantly differ between CDGP, FSS, and control groups (p=0.450). Volumetric BMD and urinary D-pyd levels of FSS and control groups were similar. Mean or median levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathormone, and osteoprotegerin did not significantly differ between CDGP, FSS, and control groups. Our data suggest that prepubertal boys with CDPG have normal bone turnover. However, their significantly higher urinary D-pyd levels relative to those of FSS and control groups might be an indicator of later development of osteoporosis. Therefore, long-term follow-up studies monitoring bone mineral status of prepubertal boys with CDPG from prepuberty to adulthood are needed to better understand bone metabolism of these patients.\n\nEldecalcitol normalizes bone turnover markers regardless of their pre-treatment levels.\n\nPubMed\n\nShiraki, Masataka; Saito, Hitoshi; Matsumoto, Toshio\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThree-year treatment with eldecalcitol has been shown to improve lumbar and total hip bone mineral density (BMD), decrease bone turnover markers, and lower the incidences of vertebral and wrist fractures in patients with osteoporosis more than with treatment with alfacalcidol under vitamin D repletion. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a risk of eldecalcitol causing severely suppressed bone turnover in osteoporosis patients with low pre-treatment levels of bone turnover markers. Post-hoc analysis was conducted on the data from a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator, clinical trial of eldecalcitol versus alfacalcidol under vitamin D repletion conducted in Japan. Enrolled patients with baseline measurements of bone turnover markers were stratified into tertiles according to their pre-treatment levels of serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide, or urinary collagen-N-telopeptide. Eldecalcitol treatment rapidly reduced bone turnover markers, and kept them within the normal range. However, in the patients whose baseline values for bone turnover were low, eldecalcitol treatment did not further reduce bone turnover markers during the 3-year treatment period. Further long-term observation may be required to reach the conclusion. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV NUMBER: NCT00144456. Eldecalcitol normalizes, but does not overly suppress, bone turnover regardless of baseline levels of bone turnover markers. Thus, it is unlikely that eldecalcitol treatment will increase the risk of severely suppressed bone turnover and therefore deterioration of bone quality, at least for a treatment duration of 3 years.\n\nCharacteristics of bone turnover in the long bone metaphysis fractured patients with normal or low Bone Mineral Density (BMD).\n\nPubMed\n\nWÃ¶lfl, Christoph; SchweppenhÃ¤user, Daniela; GÃ¼hring, Thorsten; Takur, Caner; HÃ¶ner, Bernd; Kneser, Ulrich; GrÃ¼tzner, Paul Alfred; Kolios, Leila\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe incidence of osteoporotic fractures increases as our population ages. Until now, the exact biochemical processes that occur during the healing of metaphyseal fractures remain unclear. Diagnostic instruments that allow a dynamic insight into the fracture healing process are as yet unavailable. In the present matched pair analysis, we study the time course of the osteoanabolic markers bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and transforming growth factor Î²1 (TGFÎ²1), as well as the osteocatabolic markers crosslinked C-telopeptide of type-I-collagen (Î²-CTX) and serum band 5 tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5b), during the healing of fractures that have a low level of bone mineral density (BMD) compared with fractures that have a normal BMD. Between March 2007 and February 2009, 30 patients aged older than 50 years who suffered a metaphyseal fracture were included in our study. BMDs were verified by dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXEA) scans. The levels of BTMs were examined over an 8-week period. Osteoanabolic BAP levels in those with low levels of BMD were significantly different from the BAP levels in those with normal BMD. BAP levels in the former group increased constantly, whereas the latter group showed an initial strong decrease in BAP followed by slowly rising values. Osteocatabolic Î²-CTX increased in the bone of the normal BMD group constantly, whereas these levels decreased significantly in the bone of the group with low BMD from the first week. TRAP5b was significantly reduced in the low level BMD group. With this work, we conduct first insights into the molecular biology of the fracture healing process in patients with low levels of BMD that explains the mechanism of its fracture healing. The results may be one reason for the reduced healing qualities in bones with low BMD.\n\nHardness of the subchondral bone of the patella in the normal state, in chondromalacia, and in osteoarthrosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBjÃ¶rkstrÃ¶m, S; Goldie, I F\n\n1982-06-01\n\nThe hardness of bone is its property of withstanding the impact of a penetrating agent. It has been found that articular degenerative changes in, for example, the tibia (knee) are combined with a decrease in the hardness of the subchondral bone. In this investigation the hardness of subchondral bone in chondromalacia and osteoarthrosis of the patella has been analysed and compared with normal subchondral bone. Using an indentation method originally described by Brinell the hardness of the subchondral bone was evaluated in 7 normal patellae, in 20 with chondromalacia and in 33 with osteoarthrosis. A microscopic and microradiographic study of the subchondral bone was carried out simultaneously. Hardness was lowest in the normal material. The mean hardness value beneath the degenerated cartilage differed only slightly from that of the normal material, but the variation of values was increased. The hardness in bone in the chondromalacia area was lower than the hardness in bone covered by surrounding normal cartilage. The mean hardness value in bone beneath normal parts of cartilage in specimens with chondromalacia was higher than the mean hardness value of the normal material. In the microscopic and microradiographic examination it became evident that there was a relationship between trabecular structure and subchondral bone hardness; high values: coarse and solid structure; low values: slender and less regular structure.\n\nHigh-Dose Î±-Tocopherol Supplementation Does Not Induce Bone Loss in Normal Rats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKasai, Shunji; Ito, Akemi; Shindo, Kaori; Toyoshi, Tohru; Bando, Masahiro\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOxidative stress affects bone turnover. Preventative effects of antioxidants such as vitamin E on reduced bone mineral density and fractures associated with aging, osteoporosis, and smoking have been examined in animals and humans. The effects of vitamin E (Î±-tocopherol; Î±T) on bone health have yielded conflicting and inconclusive results from animal studies. In this study, to determine the bone effects of Î±T, we investigated the in vivo effects of Î±T on the bone mineral density, bone mass, bone microstructure, bone resorption, and osteogenesis through peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) measurements, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analyses, and bone histomorphometry of lumbar vertebrae and femurs in normal female Wistar rats fed diets containing Î±T in different quantities (0, 30, 120, or 600 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks. To validate our hypotheses regarding bone changes, we examined ovariectomized rats as an osteoporosis model and control sham-operated rats in parallel. As expected, ovariectomized rats had reduced bone mineral density in lumbar vertebrae and the distal metaphyses of their femurs, reduced bone mass and deteriorated microstructure of cancellous bones in the vertebral body and distal femur metaphyses, and reduced bone mass due to resorption-dominant enhanced bone turnover in secondary cancellous bones in these sites. In comparison, Î±T administered to normal rats, even at the highest dose, did not induce reduced bone mineral density of lumbar vertebrae and femurs or a reduced bone mass or fragile microstructure of cancellous bones of the vertebral body and distal femur metaphyses. Instead, Î±T-fed rats showed a tendency for an osteogenesis-dominant bone mass increase in secondary cancellous bones in the vertebral body, in which active bone remodeling occurs. Thus, Î±T consumption may have beneficial effects on bone health.

L.\n\n1973-07-01\n\nMice were exposed to 850 or 975 rad of whole-body radiation; three hr later mice were given normal human bone marrow, infectious mononucleosis bone marrow, or cells from malignant blood diseases. The surviving mice were killed at day 9 and the spleen nodules were counted. Some mice were also given antihuman antilymphocytic serum (ALS). In mice exposed to 975 rad, the highest survival was observed in mice grafted with infectious mononucleosis bone marrow, while none of the animals grafted with cells from malignant blood diseases survived 9 days. In mice exposed to 850 rad, grafting of normal or infectious mononucleosismoreÂ Â» bone marrow markedly decreased the survival.

As a major reason for normal bone remodeling is the removal of fatigue microcracks, advances in our understanding of this process may inform approaches to enhance fracture healing. Increasing evidence now indicates that physiological bone remodeling occurs in close proximity to blood vessels and that these vessels carry perivascular stem cells that differentiate into osteoblasts. Similarly, fracture healing is critically dependent on the ingrowth of blood vessels not only for a nutrient supply but also for the influx of osteoblasts. A number of animal and human studies have now shown the potential benefit of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in enhancing bone repair. However, as in other tissues, the question of whether these cells improve fracture healing directly by differentiating into osteoblasts or indirectly by secreting paracrine factors that recruit blood vessels and the accompanying perivascular stem cells remains a major unresolved issue. Moreover, CD34+ cells, which are enriched for endothelial/hematopoietic cells, have also shown efficacy in various bone repair models, at least in part due to the induction of angiogenesis and recruitment of host progenitor cells. Thus, mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal stem/progenitor cells are attractive options for bone repair. It is possible that they contribute directly to bone repair, but it is also likely that they express paracrine factors in the appropriate amounts and combinations that promote and sustain the healing process.\n\nModeling absolute differences in life expectancy with a censored skew-normal regression approach\n\nPubMed Central\n\nClough-Gorr, Kerri; Zwahlen, Marcel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nParameter estimates from commonly used multivariable parametric survival regression models do not directly quantify differences in years of life expectancy. Gaussian linear regression models give results in terms of absolute mean differences, but are not appropriate in modeling life expectancy, because in many situations time to death has a negative skewed distribution. A regression approach using a skew-normal distribution would be an alternative to parametric survival models in the modeling of life expectancy, because parameter estimates can be interpreted in terms of survival time differences while allowing for skewness of the distribution. In this paper we show how to use the skew-normal regression so that censored and left-truncated observations are accounted for. With this we model differences in life expectancy using data from the Swiss National Cohort Study and from official life expectancy estimates and compare the results with those derived from commonly used survival regression models. We conclude that a censored skew-normal survival regression approach for left-truncated observations can be used to model differences in life expectancy across covariates of interest.

We found that cortical BD appeared to improve at 1Â year and normalize at 2Â years in all tested patients. Our previous study demonstrated that cortical BD in children and adolescents with untreated hyperthyroidism was significantly decreased as compared to age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. The present report evaluated whether attainment of euthyroidism by medical antithyroid treatment was able to improve or normalize cortical BD in these patients. Anthropometrics and three-dimensional CT bone measurements including cross-sectional area (CSA), cortical bone area (CBA) and cortical BD at midshaft of the femur (cortical bone), and CSA and BD of L(1) to L(3) vertebrae (cancellous bone) in 15 children and adolescents after 1- and 2-year treatments with antithyroid medication were reviewed and compared to their pretreatment results. All patients were euthyroid at 1 and 2Â years after medical antithyroid treatment. After adjusting for age, height, weight and Tanner stage, a significant increase in cortical BD in all patients (15/15) was found after 1Â year of treatment (Pâ<â0.001). Normalization of cortical BD was demonstrated in all tested patients (10/15) after 2Â years. There were no significant changes in the other cancellous or cortical bone parameters. Cortical BD was improved at 1Â year and normalized at 2Â years in hyperthyroid patients rendered euthyroid with antithyroid medication.\n\nA fundamental study of cryoablation on normal bone: diagnostic imaging and histopathology.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshimoto, Yuta; Azuma, Kazuo; Miya, Atsushi; Makino, Eiichi; Nakamoto, Hidekazu; Abe, Nobutaka; Kaburagi, Masashi; Ueda, Hisaki; Kuroda, Kohei; Tsuka, Takeshi; Sugiyama, Akihiko; Imagawa, Tomohiro; Murahata, Yusuke; Itoh, Norihiko; Osaki, Tomohiro; Shimizu, Tadashi; Okamoto, Yoshiharu\n\n2014-10-01\n\nCryoablation is a minimally invasive cancer treatment. In this study, the effects of cryoablation on normal rabbit bone were evaluated using imaging and histopathological examinations. Cryoablation was performed using a Cryo-Hit (Galil Medical, Yokneam, Israel). Under anesthesia, one cryoablation needle was inserted at the center of the femur (day 0). To create an ice ball (2 x 3 cm), two 10-min freeze cycles were performed, separated by a 5-min thaw cycle. During cryoablation, changes in the bone and regional tissue were monitored using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI scans, computed tomography (CT) scans, and collections from the femur (for histopathological evaluation) were performed on days 7, 14, 28, and 56. In terms of the all rabbits' general conditions, we did not observe lameness, decreased appetite, or any other side effects during the experimental periods. Histopathological evaluations of the femur were performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. MRI indicated inflammation around the ice ball on day 7. Subsequently, the area of inflammation gradually decreased from days 14 to 56. In the histopathological examination, necrosis of bone marrow cells and endosteum were observed from days 7 to 56. No regeneration of bone marrow cells was observed during the experimental period. On the other hand, cryoablation did not influence osteoblasts. Furthermore, there was no pathologic fracture during the experimental period. Our results suggest that cryoablation does not induce severe adverse effects on normal bone, and therefore has potential as a therapeutic option for bone tumors, including metastatic tumors to bone.

Dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging of the thoracolumbar spine was performed in 71 patients. The maximum percentage of enhancement (Emax), enhancement slope, and enhancement washout were determined from bone marrow enhancement time curves (ETCs). The bone marrow signal intensity on T1-weighted spin-echo MR images was qualitatively classified into three grade categories. Quantitative ETC values were correlated with patient age and bone marrow fat content grade. Statistical analysis included mean t test comparison, analysis of variance, and regression analysis of the correlations between age and quantitative MR parameters. Emax, slope, and washout varied widely among the patients. Emax values were obtained within 1 minute after contrast material injection and ranged from 0% to 430%. Emax values were significantly higher in patients younger than 40 years than in those aged 40 years or older (P <.001). These values decreased with increasing age in a logarithmic relationship (r = 0.71). Emax values decreased as fat content increased, but some overlap among the fat content grades was noted. Analysis of variance revealed that Emax was significantly related to age (younger than 40 years vs 40 years or older) (P <.001) and fat content grade (P <.001) but not significantly related to sex. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging patterns of normal spinal bone marrow are dependent mainly on patient age and fat content.\n\nThe effects of twelve weeks of bed rest on bone histology, biochemical markers of bone turnover, and calcium homeostasis in eleven normal subjects\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZerwekh, J. E.; Ruml, L. A.; Gottschalk, F.; Pak, C. Y.; Blomqvist, C. G. (Principal Investigator)\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThis study was undertaken to examine the effects of 12 weeks of skeletal unloading on parameters of calcium homeostasis, calcitropic hormones, bone histology, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in 11 normal subjects (9 men, 2 women; 34 +/- 11 years of age). Following an ambulatory control evaluation, all subjects underwent 12 weeks of bed rest. An additional metabolic evaluation was performed after 12 days of reambulation. Bone mineral density declined at the spine (-2.9%, p = 0.092) and at the hip (-3.8%, p = 0.002 for the trochanter). Bed rest prompted a rapid, sustained, significant increase in urinary calcium and phosphorus as well as a significant increase in serum calcium. Urinary calcium increased from a pre-bed rest value of 5.3 mmol/day to values as high as 73 mmol/day during bed rest. Immunoreactive parathyroid hormone and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D declined significantly during bed rest, although the mean values remained within normal limits. Significant changes in bone histology included a suppression of osteoblastic surface for cancellous bone (3.1 +/- 1.3% to 1.9 +/- 1.5%, p = 0.0142) and increased bone resorption for both cancellous and cortical bone. Cortical eroded surface increased from 3.5 +/- 1.1% to 7.3 +/- 4.0% (p = 0.018) as did active osteoclastic surface (0.2 +/- 0.3% to 0.7 +/- 0.7%, p = 0.021). Cancellous eroded surface increased from 2.1 +/- 1.1% to 4.7 +/- 2.2% (p = 0.002), while mean active osteoclastic surface doubled (0.2 +/- 0.2% to 0.4 +/- 0.3%, p = 0.020). Serum biochemical markers of bone formation (osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and type I procollagen extension peptide) did not change significantly during bed rest. Urinary biochemical markers of bone resorption (hydroxyproline, deoxypyridinoline, and N-telopeptide of type I collagen) as well as a serum marker of bone resorption (type I collagen carboxytelopeptide) all demonstrated significant increases during bed rest which declined toward normal\n\nAge-related changes in bone biochemical markers and their relationship with bone mineral density in normal Chinese women.\n\nPubMed\n\nPi, Yin-Zhen; Wu, Xian-Ping; Liu, Shi-Ping; Luo, Xiang-Hang; Cao, Xing-Zhi; Xie, Hui; Liao, Er-Yuan\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMeasurements of bone biochemical markers are increasingly being used to evaluate the state of bone turnover in the management of bone metabolic diseases, especially osteoporosis. However, changes in the bone turnover rate vary with age. The aim of this study was to establish the laboratory reference range of serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (sBAP), serum type I collagen cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide (sCTx), and urine CTx (uCTx), based on values from 665 healthy Chinese women aged 20-80 years. We measured the levels of sBAP, sCTx, serum alkaline phosphatase (sALP), and uCTx and evaluated the age-related changes and their relationship with bone mineral density (BMD) in the anteroposterior (AP) lumbar spine, hip, and left forearm. We found significant correlations between biochemical markers and age, with coefficients of determination (R (2)) of 0.358 for sBAP, 0.126 for sCTx, 0.125 for uCTx, and 0.336 for sALP. The net changes in different biochemical markers were inversely correlated with the rates of BMD loss in the AP lumbar spine. After correction for age, body weight, and height, the levels of the markers had significant negative correlations with the BMD of the AP lumbar spine, femoral neck, and ultradistal forearm. All four biochemical markers had the highest negative correlation with BMD of the AP lumbar spine (partial correlation coefficients of -0.366, -0.296, -0.290, and -0.258 for sBAP, sCTx, uCTx, and sALP, respectively). The mean and SD values of these markers in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with normal BMD values were used as the normal reference ranges. The reference ranges of sBAP, sCTx, and uCTx for pre- vs postmenopausal women were 17.3 +/- 6.23 vs 18.9 +/- 7.52 U/l, 3.18 +/- 1.49 vs 3.23 +/- 1.57 nmol/l, and 15.5 +/- 11.4 vs 16.2 +/- 12.4 nM bone collagen equivalents/mM urinary creatinine, respectively.

In premenopausal women, aged 25-50 years, multiple regression analysis of regional bone density on age, height, and weight showed a small significant decrease in total bone density (less than 0.01) but no significant change in other regions of the skeleton. In postmenopausal women there were highly significant decreases in all regions of the skeleton (p less than 0.001), and bone density in these areas decreased as a logarithmic function of years since menopause. Based on multiple regression analyses, themoreÂ Â» decrease in spine density and total bone calcium was 2.5-3.0 times greater in the 25 years after menopause than the 25 years before menopause. The largest change, however, occurred in the first five years after menopause. During this time the estimated annual change in spine density and total bone calcium was about 10 times greater than that in the premenopausal period. These results demonstrate the important effect of the menopause in determining bone mass in later life.Â«Â less\n\nBone mineral density and correlation factor analysis in normal Taiwanese children.\n\nPubMed\n\nShu, San-Ging\n\n2007-01-01\n\nOur aim was to establish reference data and linear regression equations for lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) in normal Taiwanese children. Several influencing factors of lumbar BMD were investigated. Two hundred fifty-seven healthy children were recruited from schools, 136 boys and 121 girls, aged 4-18 years were enrolled on a voluntary basis with written consent. Their height, weight, blood pressure, puberty stage, bone age and lumbar BMD (L2-4) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were measured. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and stepwise regression tests. All measurements increased with age. Prior to age 8, there was no gender difference. Parameters such as height, weight, and bone age (BA) in girls surpassed boys between ages 8-13 without statistical significance (p> or =0.05). This was reversed subsequently after age 14 in height (p<0.05). BMD difference had the same trend but was not statistically significant either. The influencing power of puberty stage and bone age over BMD was almost equal to or higher than that of height and weight. All the other factors correlated with BMD to variable powers.

Since the use of F-NaF PET/CT has been increasing, it is important to accurately assess the images and be aware of normal distribution and major artifacts. In this pictorial review article, we will describe the normal uptake patterns of F-NaF in the bone tissues, particularly in complex structures, as well as its physiologic soft tissue distribution and certain artifacts seen on F-NaF PET/CT images.\n\nFirst-trimester nasal bone length in a normal Latin American population.\n\nPubMed\n\nCasasbuenas, Alexandra; Wong, Amy E; Sepulveda, Waldo\n\n2009-02-01\n\nTo report normative data of nasal bone length (NBL) in first-trimester singleton fetuses in a normal cohort of Latin American women. NBL was measured during routine first-trimester sonographic examination in 1040 singleton fetuses from an unselected population. NBL increased linearly with advancing gestational age (GA) [NBL (mm) = - 1.10 + 0.03 x GA (days), R(2) = 0.21; p < 0.001]. Similarly, there was a linear relationship between the NBL and crown-lump length (CRL) [NBL (mm) = 0.41 + 0.02 x CRL (mm), R(2) = 0.27; p < 0.001]. The NBLs at the 50th percentile in our population were 1.5, 1.7, and 1.9 mm at 11, 12, and 13 weeks of gestation, respectively. Whereas categorizing a nasal bone as absent or present can be subjective because of variations in echogenicity due to technique and equipment, measurement of NBL is a more objective approach to nasal bone assessment in screening for aneuploidy. Measurement of NBL in the first trimester is feasible and can be easily obtained at the time of nuchal translucency assessment. The normative data we report can provide a reference for defining nasal bone hypoplasia in the first trimester in the Latin American population.

Addressing this issue, we investigated the biaxial normal strength behavior and the underlying failure mechanisms for human trabecular bone displaying a wide range of bone volume fraction (0.06â0.34) and elastic anisotropy. Micro-computer tomography (CT)-based nonlinear finite element analysis was used to simulate biaxial failure in 15 specimens (5âmm cubes), spanning the complete biaxial normal stress failure space in the axial-transverse plane. The specimens, treated as approximately transversely isotropic, were loaded in the principal material orientation. We found that the biaxial stress yield surface was well characterized by the superposition of two ellipsesâone each for yield failure in the longitudinal and transverse loading directionsâand the size, shape, and orientation of which depended on bone volume fraction and elastic anisotropy. However, when normalized by the uniaxial tensile and compressive strengths in the longitudinal and transverse directions, all of which depended on bone volume fraction, microarchitecture, and mechanical anisotropy, the resulting normalized biaxial strength behavior was well described by a single pair of (longitudinal and transverse) ellipses, with little interspecimen variation. Taken together, these results indicate that the role of bone volume fraction, microarchitecture, and mechanical anisotropy is mostly accounted for in determining the uniaxial strength behavior and the effect of these parameters on the axial-transverse biaxial normal strength behavior per se is minor.

PHEX binds to the DMP1-ASARM-motif to form a trimeric-complex with Î±5Î²3-integrin on the osteocyte surface and this suppresses FGF23 expression. ASARM-peptide disruption of this complex increases FGF23 expression. We used a 4.2 kDa peptide (SPR4) that binds to ASARM-peptide and ASARM-motif to study DMP1-PHEX interactions and to assess SPR4 for treating inherited hypophosphatemic rickets. Design Subcutaneously transplanted osmotic pumps were used to infuse SPR4-peptide or vehicle into wild-type mice (WT) and HYP-mice for 4 weeks. Results Asymmetrically distributed mineralization defects occurred with WT-SPR4 femurs. Specifically, SPR4 induced negative effects on trabecular bone and increased bone volume and mineralization in cortical-bone. Markedly increased sclerostin and reduced active Î²-catenin occurred with HYP mice. SPR4-infusion suppressed sclerostin and increased active Î²-catenin in WT and HYP mice and improved HYP-mice trabecular mineralization defects but not cortical mineralization defects. Conclusions SPR4-peptide has bimodal activity and acts by: (1) preventing DMP1 binding to PHEX and (2) sequestering an inhibitor of DMP1-PHEX binding, ASARM-peptide. In PHEX defective HYP-mice the second pathway predominates. Although SPR4-peptide improved trabecular calcification defects, decreased sclerostin and increased active Î²-catenin it did not correct HYP-mice cortical mineralization defects on a normal phosphate diet. Thus, for inherited hypophosphatemic rickets patients on a normal phosphate diet, SPR4-peptide is not a useful therapeutic.

Serum BALP activity will correlate with absolute tumor burden in dogs with OSA. This study included 96 client-owned dogs with appendicular OSA. In canine OSA cell lines, the expression and membranous release of BALP was evaluated in vitro. The correlation between serum BALP activity and radiographic primary tumor size was evaluated in OSA-bearing dogs. In dogs developing visceral OSA metastases, serial changes in serum BALP activities were evaluated in relation to progression of macroscopic metastases, and visceral metastatic OSA cells were evaluated for BALP expression. In vitro, BALP expression was not associated with either tumorigenic or metastatic phenotype, rather the quantity of membranous BALP released was proportional with cell density. In dogs devoid of macroscopic metastases, there was a positive correlation between serum BALP activity and absolute primary tumor size. In dogs with progressive OSA metastases, serum BALP activity increased and coincided with the development of macroscopic metastases. OSA cells derived from visceral metastatic lesions retained BALP expression. Tumor burden is a determinant of serum BALP activity in dogs with appendicular OSA. The association between increased pretreatment BALP activity and negative clinical prognosis may simply be attributed to greater initial tumor burden, and consequently more advanced tumor stage.

Stronger lifters were defined as those having a Wilks score greater than 410, whereas those in the weaker group had a Wilks score less than 370. Each powerlifter was assessed for 37 anthropometric dimensions by International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) level II and III accredited anthropometrists. Because all powerlifters were highly mesomorphic and possessed large girths and bone breadths, both in absolute terms and when expressed as Phantom-Z scores compared through the Phantom, relatively few significant anthropometric differences were observed. However, stronger lifters had significantly greater muscle mass and larger muscular girths in absolute terms as well as greater Brugsch Index (chest girth/height) and \"Phantom\"-normalized muscle mass, upper arm, chest, and forearm girths. In terms of the segment lengths and bone breadths, the only significant difference was that stronger lifters had a significantly shorter lower leg than weaker lifters. Because the majority of the significant differences were for muscle mass and muscular girths, it would appear likely that these differences contributed to the stronger lifters' superior performance. Powerlifters may therefore need to devote some of their training to the development of greater levels of muscular hypertrophy if they wish to continue to improve their performance. To better understand the anthropometric determinants of muscular strength, future research should recruit larger samples (particularly of elite lifters) and follow these subjects prospectively.\n\nRac1 Dosage Is Crucial for Normal Endochondral Bone Growth.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuzuki, Dai; Bush, Jason R; Bryce, Dawn-Marie; Kamijo, Ryutaro; Beier, Frank\n\n2017-10-01\n\nRac1, a member of the small Rho GTPase family, plays multiple cellular roles. Studies of mice conditionally lacking Rac1 have revealed essential roles for Rac1 in various tissues, including cartilage and limb mesenchyme, where Rac1 loss produces dwarfism and long bone shortening. To gain further insight into the role of Rac1 in skeletal development, we have used transgenic mouse lines to express a constitutively active (ca) Rac1 mutant protein in a Cre recombinase-dependent manner. Overexpression of caRac1 in limb bud mesenchyme or chondrocytes leads to reduced body weight and shorter bones compared with control mice. Histological analysis of growth plates showed that caRac1;Col2-Cre mice displayed ectopic hypertrophic chondrocytes in the proliferative zone and enlarged hypertrophic zones. These mice also displayed a reduced proportion of proliferatingÂ cellÂ nuclear antigen-positive cells in the proliferative zone and nuclear Î²-catenin localization in the ectopic hypertrophic chondrocytes. Importantly, overexpression of caRac1 partially rescued the phenotypes of Rac1fl/fl;Col2-Cre and Rac1fl/fl;Prx1-Cre conditional knockout mice, including body weight, bone length, and growth plate disorganization. These results suggest that tight regulation of Rac1 activity is necessary for normal cartilage development.

The inability to correct for signal mixing represents a major limitation on the use of these datasets for subsequent analyses, such as discerning deletion types or detecting driver aberrations. We describe the BACOM2.0 method with enhanced accuracy and functionality to normalize copy number signals, detect deletion types, estimate tumor purity, quantify true copy numbers, and calculate average-ploidy value. While BACOM has been validated and used with promising results, subsequent BACOM analysis of the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset found that the estimated average tumor purity was lower than expected. In this report, we first show that this lowered estimate of tumor purity is the combined result of imprecise signal normalization and parameter estimation. Then, we describe effective allele-specific absolute normalization and quantification methods that can enhance BACOM applications in many biological contexts while in the presence of various confounders. Finally, we discuss the advantages of BACOM in relation to alternative approaches. Here we detail this revised computational approach, BACOM2.0, and validate its performance in real and simulated datasets.\n\nIn vivo competitive studies between normal and common gamma chain-defective bone marrow cells: implications for gene therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nOtsu, M; Sugamura, K; Candotti, F\n\n2000-09-20\n\nCorrective gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is being investigated as therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) and it is hoped that selective advantage of gene-corrected HSCs will help in achieving full immune reconstitution after treatment. Lines of evidence from the results of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with XSCID support this hypothesis that, however, has not been rigorously tested in an experimental system. We studied the competition kinetics between normal and XSCID bone marrow (BM) cells using a murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) model. For easy chimerism determination, we used genetic marking with retrovirus-mediated expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We found that XSCID BM cells were able to compete with normal BM cells for engraftment of myeloid lineages in a dose-dependent manner, whereas we observed selective repopulation of T, B, and NK cells deriving from normal BM cells. This was true despite the evidence of competitive engraftment of XSCID lineage marker-negative/c-Kit-positive (Lin-/c-Kit+) cells in the bone marrow of treated animals. From these results we extrapolate that genetic correction of XSCID HSCs will result in selective advantage of gene-corrected lymphoid lineages with consequent restoration of lymphocyte populations and high probability of clinical benefit.\n\nStimulation of Mucosal Mast Cell Growth in Normal and Nude Rat Bone Marrow Cultures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaig, David M.; McMenamin, Christine; Gunneberg, Christian; Woodbury, Richard; Jarrett, Ellen E. E.\n\n1983-07-01\n\nMast cells with the morphological and biochemical properties of mucosal mast cells (MMC) appear and proliferate to form the predominant cell type in rat bone marrow cultures stimulated with factors from antigen- or mitogen-activated lymphocytes. Conditioned media causing a selective proliferation of MMC were derived from mesenteric lymph node cells of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-infected rats restimulated in vitro with specific antigen or from normal or infected rat mesenteric lymph node cells stimulated with concanavalin A. MMC growth factor is not produced by T-cell-depleted mesenteric lymph node cells or by the mesenteric lymph node cells of athymic rats. By contrast, MMC precursors are present in the bone marrow of athymic rats and are normally receptive to the growth factor produced by the lymphocytes of thymus-intact rats. The thymus dependence of MMC hyperplasia is thus based on the requirement of a thymus-independent precursor for a T-cell-derived growth promoter.\n\nNormal Collagen and Bone Production by Gene-targeted Human Osteogenesis Imperfecta iPSCs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDeyle, David R; Khan, Iram F; Ren, Gaoying; Wang, Pei-Rong; Kho, Jordan; Schwarze, Ulrike; Russell, David W\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOsteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by dominant mutations in the type I collagen genes. In principle, the skeletal abnormalities of OI could be treated by transplantation of patient-specific, bone-forming cells that no longer express the mutant gene. Here, we develop this approach by isolating mesenchymal cells from OI patients, inactivating their mutant collagen genes by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene targeting, and deriving induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that were expanded and differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs). Gene-targeted iMSCs produced normal collagen and formed bone in vivo, but were less senescent and proliferated more than bone-derived MSCs. To generate iPSCs that would be more appropriate for clinical use, the reprogramming and selectable marker transgenes were removed by Cre recombinase. These results demonstrate that the combination of gene targeting and iPSC derivation can be used to produce potentially therapeutic cells from patients with genetic disease.

There was no significant difference between the nBUA measurements obtained for 14 bovine femoral trabecular bone samples by using the bidirectional and the conventional transverse transmission techniques. The nBUA measured by using the two transverse transmission techniques showed strong positive correlations of r = 0.87 to 0.88 with the apparent bone density, consistent with the behavior in human trabecular bone invitro. We expect that the new method can be usefully applied for improved accuracy and precision in clinical measurements.\n\nExperiment K305: Quantitative analysis of selected bone parameters. Supplement 2: Bone elongation rate and bone mass in metaphysis of long bones\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJee, W. S. S.; Kimmel, D. B.; Smith, C.; Dell, R. B.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe proximal humeral metaphysis of rats from time periods recovery plus zero days (R+0), recovery plus six days (R+6), and recovery plus twenty nine days (R+29) was analyzed. The volume of calcified cartilage and bone in flight and synchronous controls was reduced in groups R+0 and R+6, but was normal in group R+29. The number of functional bone cells (osteoblasts and osteoclasts) was decreased in proportion to the amount of bone in the early groups, and was normal in the last group. The fatty marrow volume was increased only in flight animals of groups R+0 and R+6, but was normal in the R+29 group. Accumulation of excess fatty marrow was seen only in flight animals. The decreased amount of bone and calcified cartilage is believed to be the result of a temporarily slowed or arrested production of calcified cartilage as a substrate for bone formation. This would have resulted from slowed bone elongation during flight and synchronous control conditions. Bone elongation returned to normal by twenty nine days after return.\n\nPeripheral absolute threshold spectral sensitivity in retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMassof, R W; Johnson, M A; Finkelstein, D\n\n1981-01-01\n\nDark-adapted spectral sensitivities were measured in the peripheral retinas of 38 patients diagnosed as having typical retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and in 3 normal volunteers. The patients included those having autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Results were analysed by comparisons with the CIE standard scotopic spectral visibility function and with Judd's modification of the photopic spectral visibility function, with consideration of contributions from changes in spectral transmission of preretinal media. The data show 3 general patterns. One group of patients had absolute threshold spectral sensitivities that were fit by Judd's photopic visibility curve. Absolute threshold spectral sensitivities for a second group of patients were fit by a normal scotopic spectral visibility curve. The third group of patients had absolute threshold spectral sensitivities that were fit by a combination of scotopic and photopic spectral visibility curves. The autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance were represented in each group of patients. These data indicate that RP patients have normal rod and/or cone spectral sensitivities, and support the subclassification of patients described previously by Massof and Finkelstein.

During the initial stages of a clinical trial in Malawi, the authors noted an unexpectedly high number of infants with absolute neutrophil counts that would be classifiable as neutropenic using the National Institutes of Health's Division of AIDS toxicity tables. The authors argue that the relevant Division of AIDS table does not take into account the available evidence of low absolute neutrophil counts in African infants and that a systematic collection of data from many African settings might help establish the absolute neutrophil count cutpoints to be used for defining neutropenia in African populations.\n\nBisphosphonates Improve Trabecular Bone Mass and Normalize Cortical Thickness in Ovariectomized, Osteoblast Connexin43 Deficient Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWatkins, Marcus P.; Norris, Jin Yi; Grimston, Susan K.; Zhang, Xiaowen; Phipps, Roger J.; Ebetino, Frank H.; Civitelli, Roberto\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe gap junction protein, connexin43 (Cx43) controls both bone formation and osteoclastogenesis via osteoblasts and/or osteocytes. Cx43 has also been proposed to mediate an anti-apoptotic effect of bisphosphonates, potent inhibitors of bone resorption. We studied whether bisphosphonates are effective in protecting mice with a conditional Cx43 gene deletion in osteoblasts and osteocytes (cKO) from the consequences of ovariectomy on bone mass and strength. Ovariectomy resulted in rapid loss of trabecular bone followed by a slight recovery in wild type (WT) mice, and a similar degree of trabecular bone loss, albeit slightly delayed, occurred in cKO mice. Treatment with either risedronate (20Âµg/kg) or alendronate (40Âµg/kg) prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss in both genotypes. In basal conditions, bones of cKO mice have larger marrow area, higher endocortical osteoclast number, and lower cortical thickness and strength relative to WT. Ovariectomy increased endocortical osteoclast number in WT but not in cKO mice. Both bisphosphonates prevented these increases in WT mice, and normalized endocortical osteoclast number, cortical thickness and bone strength in cKO mice. Thus, lack of osteoblast/osteocyte Cx43 does not alter bisphosphonate action on bone mass and strength in estrogen deficiency. These results support the notion that one of the main functions of Cx43 in cortical bone is to restrain osteoblast and/or osteocytes from inducing osteoclastogenesis at the endocortical surface.

S.; Mcmullin, D.; Judge, D. L.; Korde, R.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nNew developments in transmission grating and photodiode technology now make it possible to realize spectrometers in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral region (wavelengths less than 1000 A) which are expected to be virtually constant in their diffraction and detector properties. Time dependent effects associated with reflection gratings are eliminated through the use of free standing transmission gratings. These gratings together with recently developed and highly stable EUV photodiodes have been utilized to construct a highly stable normal incidence spectrophotometer to monitor the variability and absolute intensity of the solar 304 A line. Owing to its low weight and compactness, such a spectrometer will be a valuable tool for providing absolute solar irradiance throughout the EUV. This novel instrument will also be useful for cross-calibrating other EUV flight instruments and will be flown on a series of Hitchhiker Shuttle Flights and on SOHO. A preliminary version of this instrument has been fabricated and characterized, and the results are described.\n\nLow Bone Density\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

D.; Gould, K. G.; Vailas, A. C.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nMeasurement of bone turnover in conditions such as osteoporosis has been limited by the need for invasive iliac bone biopsy to reliably determine parameters of bone metabolism. Recent advances in the area of serum and urinary markers of bone metabolism have raised the possibility for noninvasive measurements; however, little nonhuman primate data exist for these parameters. The purpose of this experiment was to define the normal range and variability of several of the newer noninvasive bone markers which are currently under investigation in humans. The primary intent was to determine age and gender variability, as well as provide some normative data for future experiments in nonhuman primates. Twenty-four rhesus macaques were divided into equal groups of male and female according to the following age groupings: 3 years, 5-10 years, 15-20 years, and > 25 years. Urine was collected three times daily for a four-day period and measured for several markers of bone turnoverm including pyridinoline (PYD), deoxypyrodinoline (DPD), hydroxyproline, and creatinine. Bone mineral density measurements of the lumbar spine were performed at the beginning and end of the study period. Serum was also obtained at the time of bone densitometry for measurement of osteocalcin levels by radioimmunoassay. There were no significant differences in bone mineral density, urine PYD, or urine DPD based on gender. Bone density was lowest in the youngest animals, peaked in the 15-20-year group, but again decreased in the oldest animals. The osteocalcin, PYD, and DPD levels followed an inversely related pattern to bone density. The most important result was the relative age insensitivity of the ratio of PYD:DPD in monkeys up to age 20 years. Since bone density changes take months or years to become measurable and iliac biopsies are invasive, the PYD/DPD marker ratio may have important implications for rapid noninvasive measurement of the effects of potential treatments for osteoporosis in the non\n\nExcessive Vitamin E Intake Does Not Cause Bone Loss in Male or Ovariectomized Female Mice Fed Normal or High-Fat Diets.\n\nPubMed\n\nIkegami, Hiroko; Kawawa, Rie; Ichi, Ikuyo; Ishikawa, Tomoko; Koike, Taisuke; Aoki, Yoshinori; Fujiwara, Yoko\n\n2017-10-01\n\nBackground: Animal studies on the effects of vitamin E on bone health have yielded conflicting and inconclusive results, and to our knowledge, no studies have addressed the effect of vitamin E on bone in animals consuming a high-fat diet (HFD). Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of excessive vitamin E on bone metabolism in normal male mice and ovariectomized female mice fed a normal diet (ND) or HFD. Methods: In the first 2 experiments, 7-wk-old male mice were fed an ND (16% energy from fat) containing 75 (control), 0 (vitamin E-free), or 1000 (high vitamin E) mg vitamin E/kg (experiment 1) or an HFD (46% energy from fat) containing 0, 200, 500, or 1000 mg vitamin E/kg (experiment 2) for 18 wk. In the third experiment, 7-wk-old sham-operated or ovariectomized female mice were fed the ND (75 mg vitamin E/kg) or HFD containing 0 or 1000 mg vitamin E/kg for 8 wk. At the end of the feeding period, blood and femurs were collected to measure bone turnover markers and analyze histology and microcomputed tomography. Results: In experiments 1 and 2, vitamin E intake had no effect on plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, or bone formation, resorption, or volume in femurs in mice fed the ND or HFDs. In experiment 3, bone volume was significantly reduced (85%) in ovariectomized mice compared with that in sham-operated mice ( P < 0.05), but it did not differ among mice fed the 3 diets. Plasma ALP and TRAP activities and bone formation and resorption in femur were similar among ovariectomized mice fed the HFD containing 0 or 1000 mg vitamin E/kg. Conclusions: The results suggest that excess vitamin E intake does not cause bone loss in normal male mice or in ovariectomized or sham-operated female mice, regardless of dietary fat content.

The aim of the investigation was to study the ability of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of patients with leukemia to maintain normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. MSCs were obtained from the bone marrow of 14 patients with acute lymphoblastic (ALL), 25 with myeloid (AML), and 15 with chronic myeloid (CML) leukemia. As a control, MSCs from 22 healthy donors were used. The incidence of cobblestone area forming cells (CAFC 7-8 d) in the bone marrow of healthy donor cultivated on the supportive layer of patients MSCs was measured. The ability of MSCs from AML and ALL patients at the moment of diagnosis to maintain normal CAFC was significantly decreased when compared to donors. After chemotherapy, the restoration of ALL patients' MSCs functions was slower than that of AML. CML MSCs maintained CAFC better than donors' at the moment of diagnosis and this ability increased with treatment. The ability of patients' MSCs to maintain normal hematopoietic progenitor cells was shown to change in comparison with MSCs from healthy donors and depended on nosology. During treatment, the functional capacity of patients' MSCs had been partially restored. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Aiming to reveal these mitochondrial differences, we came across the issue on how to normalize such comparisons and decided to focus on the absolute number of mitochondria. To this end, fluorescently stained mitochondria were quantified by flow cytometry. For rat liver mitochondria, this approach resulted in mitochondrial protein contents comparable to earlier reports using alternative methods. We determined similar protein contents for rat liver, heart and kidney mitochondria. In contrast, however, lower protein contents were determined for rat brain mitochondria and for mitochondria from the rat hepatocellular carcinoma cell line McA 7777. This result challenges mitochondrial comparisons that rely on equal protein amounts as a typical normalization method. Exemplarily, we therefore compared the activity and susceptibility toward inhibition of complex II of rat liver and hepatocellular carcinoma mitochondria and obtained significant discrepancies by either normalizing to protein amount or to absolute mitochondrial number. Importantly, the latter normalization, in contrast to the former, demonstrated a lower complex II activity and higher susceptibility toward inhibition in hepatocellular carcinoma mitochondria compared to liver mitochondria. These findings demonstrate that solely normalizing to protein amount may obscure essential molecular differences between mitochondrial populations.

Abundant FCCIA was found in 83% of normal human sera but in only 20% of sera from untreated patients with different hemopoietic disorders and in 32% of treated leukemic patients. It is suggested that FCCIA may be involved in regulation of the bone marrow microenvironment an that it varies in normal individuals and in patients with different diseases.\n\nSurvival and characteristics of murine leukaemic and normal stem cells after hyperthermia: a murine model for human bone marrow purging.\n\nPubMed\n\nGidÃ¡li, J; SzamosvÃ¶lgyi, S; FehÃ©r, I; KovÃ¡cs, P\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe effect of hyperthermia in vitro on the survival and leukaemogenic effectiveness of WEHI 3-B cells and on the survival and transplantation efficiency of bone marrow cells was compared in a murine model system. Normal murine clonogenic haemopoietic cells (day 9 CFU-S and CFU-GM) proved to be significantly less sensitive to 42.5 degrees C hyperthermia (Do values: 54.3 and 41.1 min, respectively) than leukaemic clonogenic cells (CFU-L) derived from suspension culture or from bone marrow of leukaemic mice (Do: 17.8 min). Exposure for 120 min to 42.5 degrees C reduced the surviving fraction of CFU-L to 0.002 and that of CFU-S to 0.2. If comparable graft sizes were transplanted from normal or heat exposed bone marrow, 60-day survival of supralethally irradiated mice was similar. Surviving WEHI 3-B cells were capable of inducing leukaemia in vivo. The two log difference in the surviving fraction of CFU-L and CFU-S after 120 min exposure to 42.5 degrees C suggests that hyperthermia ex vivo may be a suitable purging method for autologous bone marrow transplantation.\n\nElectronic Absolute Cartesian Autocollimator\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLeviton, Douglas B.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAn electronic absolute Cartesian autocollimator performs the same basic optical function as does a conventional all-optical or a conventional electronic autocollimator but differs in the nature of its optical target and the manner in which the position of the image of the target is measured. The term absolute in the name of this apparatus reflects the nature of the position measurement, which, unlike in a conventional electronic autocollimator, is based absolutely on the position of the image rather than on an assumed proportionality between the position and the levels of processed analog electronic signals. The term Cartesian in the name of this apparatus reflects the nature of its optical target. Figure 1 depicts the electronic functional blocks of an electronic absolute Cartesian autocollimator along with its basic optical layout, which is the same as that of a conventional autocollimator. Referring first to the optical layout and functions only, this or any autocollimator is used to measure the compound angular deviation of a flat datum mirror with respect to the optical axis of the autocollimator itself. The optical components include an illuminated target, a beam splitter, an objective or collimating lens, and a viewer or detector (described in more detail below) at a viewing plane. The target and the viewing planes are focal planes of the lens. Target light reflected by the datum mirror is imaged on the viewing plane at unit magnification by the collimating lens. If the normal to the datum mirror is parallel to the optical axis of the autocollimator, then the target image is centered on the viewing plane. Any angular deviation of the normal from the optical axis manifests itself as a lateral displacement of the target image from the center. The magnitude of the displacement is proportional to the focal length and to the magnitude (assumed to be small) of the angular deviation. The direction of the displacement is perpendicular to the axis about which the\n\nSerum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and bone turnover markers in Palestinian postmenopausal osteoporosis and normal women.\n\nPubMed\n\nKharroubi, Akram; Saba, Elias; Smoom, Riham; Bader, Khaldoun; Darwish, Hisham\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThis study evaluated the association of vitamin D and bone markers with the development osteoporosis in Palestinian postmenopausal women. Even though vitamin D deficiency was very high for the recruited subjects, it was not associated with osteoporosis except for bones of the hip. Age and obesity were the strongest determining factors of the disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of bone mineral density (BMD) with serum vitamin D levels, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, obesity, and bone turnover markers in Palestinian postmenopausal women. Three hundred eighty-two postmenopausal women (â¥45Â years) were recruited from various women clinics for BMD assessment (131 women had osteoporosis and 251 were normal and served as controls). Blood samples were obtained for serum calcium, PTH, 25(OH)D, bone formation (N-terminal propeptide (PINP)), and bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX1)) markers. Women with osteoporosis had statistically significant lower mean weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and serum calcium (pÂ <Â 0.05) compared to controls. No significant differences were detected between the mean values of bone turnover markers (CTX and PINP), 25(OH)D, and PTH of the two groups. Women with vitamin D deficiency (severe and insufficiency) represented 85.9% of the study subjects. Multiple and logistic regression showed that age and BMI significantly affected BMD and vitamin D had a significant association with BMD only at the lumbar spine. BMI was positively correlated with BMD and PTH but negatively correlated with vitamin D. Logistic regression showed that the odds ratio (OR) for having osteoporosis decreased with increasing BMI (overweight ORÂ =Â 0.11, pÂ =Â 0.053; obese ORÂ =Â 0.05, pÂ =Â 0.007). There was no direct correlation between BMD and PTH, bone turnover markers, and vitamin D except at the lumbar spine. A negative correlation between BMD and age and a positive correlation with BMI were\n\nBone apatite composition of necrotic trabecular bone in the femoral head of immature piglets.\n\nPubMed\n\nAruwajoye, Olumide O; Kim, Harry K W; Aswath, Pranesh B\n\n2015-04-01\n\nIschemic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (IOFH) can lead to excessive resorption of the trabecular bone and collapse of the femoral head as a structure. A well-known mineral component to trabecular bone is hydroxyapatite, which can be present in many forms due to ionic substitution, thus altering chemical composition. Unfortunately, very little is known about the chemical changes to bone apatite following IOFH. We hypothesized that the apatite composition changes in necrotic bone possibly contribute to increased osteoclast resorption and structural collapse of the femoral head. The purpose of this study was to assess the macroscopic and local phosphate composition of actively resorbed necrotic trabecular bone to isolate differences between areas of increased osteoclast resorption and normal bone formation. A piglet model of IOFH was used. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), histology, X-ray absorbance near edge structure (XANES), and Raman spectroscopy were performed on femoral heads to characterize normal and necrotic trabecular bone. Backscattered SEM, micro-computed tomography and histology showed deformity and active resorption of necrotic bone compared to normal. XANES and Raman spectroscopy obtained from actively resorbed necrotic bone and normal bone showed increased carbonate-to-phosphate content in the necrotic bone. The changes in the apatite composition due to carbonate substitution may play a role in the increased resorption of necrotic bone due to its increase in solubility. Indeed, a better understanding of the apatite composition of necrotic bone could shed light on osteoclast activity and potentially improve therapeutic treatments that target excessive resorption of bone.\n\nSmpd3 Expression in both Chondrocytes and Osteoblasts Is Required for Normal Endochondral Bone Development\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Jingjing; Manickam, Garthiga; Ray, Seemun; Oh, Chun-do; Yasuda, Hideyo; Moffatt, Pierre\n\n2016-01-01\n\nSphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), a lipid-metabolizing enzyme present in bone and cartilage, has been identified to be a key regulator of skeletal development. A homozygous loss-of-function mutation called fragilitas ossium (fro) in the Smpd3 gene causes poor bone and cartilage mineralization resulting in severe congenital skeletal deformities. Here we show that Smpd3 expression in ATDC5 chondrogenic cells is downregulated by parathyroid hormone-related peptide through transcription factor SOX9. Furthermore, we show that transgenic expression of Smpd3 in the chondrocytes of fro/fro mice corrects the cartilage but not the bone abnormalities. Additionally, we report the generation of Smpd3flox/flox mice for the tissue-specific inactivation of Smpd3 using the Cre-loxP system. We found that the skeletal phenotype in Smpd3flox/flox; Osx-Cre mice, in which the Smpd3 gene is ablated in both late-stage chondrocytes and osteoblasts, closely mimics the skeletal phenotype in fro/fro mice. On the other hand, Smpd3flox/flox; Col2a1-Cre mice, in which the Smpd3 gene is knocked out in chondrocytes only, recapitulate the fro/fro mouse cartilage phenotype. This work demonstrates that Smpd3 expression in both chondrocytes and osteoblasts is required for normal endochondral bone development.

Measurements were made using the /sup 125/I photon absorptiometric method at five pairs of contralateral sites with the arm in the prone position: the midshafts of the right and left radii and ulnae, the distal metaphyses of the right and left radii and ulnae, and the distal diaphyses of the right and left third proximal phalanges. Most subjects were from a group who had abnormally high body burdens of /sup 226/Ra. A large fractionmoreÂ Â» of radium intake to the body is deposited in the skeleton and these subjects were studied to determine if irradiation of bone by radium alpha particles affected the BMC. There was no relation of BMC to radiation dose, although for high doses there were depressions in BMC when scanning across osteolytic lesions. The data here are for subjects who had /sup 226/Ra body burdens less than 100 nCi plus persons who were unexposed to radium. Body burdens of 100 nCi /sup 226/Ra cause no radiographic skeletal abnormalities. This and the absence of a correlation between BMC and radiation dose indicated that our radium-exposed subjects had normal skeletons.Â«Â less\n\nExtended flow cytometry characterization of normal bone marrow progenitor cells by simultaneous detection of aldehyde dehydrogenase and early hematopoietic antigens: implication for erythroid differentiation studies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMirabelli, Peppino; Di Noto, Rosa; Lo Pardo, Catia; Morabito, Paolo; Abate, Giovanna; Gorrese, Marisa; Raia, Maddalena; Pascariello, Caterina; Scalia, Giulia; Gemei, Marica; Mariotti, Elisabetta; Del Vecchio, Luigi\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a cytosolic enzyme highly expressed in hematopoietic precursors from cord blood and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood, as well as in bone marrow from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. As regards human normal bone marrow, detailed characterization of ALDH+ cells has been addressed by one single study (Gentry et al, 2007). The goal of our work was to provide new information about the dissection of normal bone marrow progenitor cells based upon the simultaneous detection by flow cytometry of ALDH and early hematopoietic antigens, with particular attention to the expression of ALDH on erythroid precursors. To this aim, we used three kinds of approach: i) multidimensional analytical flow cytometry, detecting ALDH and early hematopoietic antigens in normal bone marrow; ii) fluorescence activated cell sorting of distinct subpopulations of progenitor cells, followed by in vitro induction of erythroid differentiation; iii) detection of ALDH+ cellular subsets in bone marrow from pure red cell aplasia patients. Results In normal bone marrow, we identified three populations of cells, namely ALDH+CD34+, ALDH-CD34+ and ALDH+CD34- (median percentages were 0.52, 0.53 and 0.57, respectively). As compared to ALDH-CD34+ cells, ALDH+CD34+ cells expressed the phenotypic profile of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, with brighter expression of CD117 and CD133, accompanied by lower display of CD38 and CD45RA. Of interest, ALDH+CD34- population disclosed a straightforward erythroid commitment, on the basis of three orders of evidences. First of all, ALDH+CD34- cells showed a CD71bright, CD105+, CD45- phenotype. Secondly, induction of differentiation experiments evidenced a clear-cut expression of glycophorin A (CD235a). Finally, ALDH+CD34- precursors were not detectable in patients with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA).

When trying to determine the reason why bone loss occurs during spaceflight, one must remember that all these other changes in physiology and metabolism may also have impact on the skeletal system. For bone, however, the role of normal weight bearing is a major concern and we have found no adequate substitute for weight bearing which can prevent bone loss. During the study of this problem, we have learned a great deal about bone physiology and increased our knowledge about how normal bone is formed and maintained. Presently, we do not have adequate ground based models which can mimic the tissue loss that occurs in spaceflight but this condition closely resembles the bone loss seen with osteoporosis. Although a normal bone structure will respond to application of mechanical force and weight bearing by forming new bone, a weakened osteoporotic bone may have a tendency to fracture. The study of the skeletal system during weightless conditions will eventually produce preventative measures and form a basis for protecting the crew during long term space flight. The added benefit from these studies will be methods to treat bone loss conditions which occur here on earth.\n\nSpace flight and bone formation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDoty, St B.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nMajor physiological changes which occur during spaceflight include bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular and immune response alterations.

Lumbar spine (LS) measurements are not currently part of the FRAX formulation but are used widely in clinical practice, and this creates confusion when there is spine-hip discordance. Our objective was to develop a hybrid 10-year absolute fracture risk assessment system in which nonvertebral (NV) fracture risk was assessed from the FN and clinical vertebral (V) fracture risk was assessed from the LS. We identified 37,032 women age 45 years and older undergoing baseline FN and LS dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; 1990-2005) from a population database that contains all clinical DXA results for the Province of Manitoba, Canada. Results were linked to longitudinal health service records for physician billings and hospitalizations to identify nontrauma vertebral and nonvertebral fracture codes after bone mineral density (BMD) testing. The population was randomly divided into equal-sized derivation and validation cohorts. Using the derivation cohort, three fracture risk prediction systems were created from Cox proportional hazards models (adjusted for age and multiple FRAX risk factors): FN to predict combined all fractures, FN to predict nonvertebral fractures, and LS to predict vertebral (without nonvertebral) fractures. The hybrid system was the sum of nonvertebral risk from the FN model and vertebral risk from the LS model. The FN and hybrid systems were both strongly predictive of overall fracture risk (p <â.001). In the validation cohort, ROC analysis showed marginally better performance of the hybrid system versus the FN system for overall fracture prediction (p =â.24) and significantly better performance for vertebral fracture prediction (p <â.001). In a discordance subgroup with FN and LS T-score differences greater than 1 SD, there was a significant\n\nEVALUATION OF CALCIUM 47 IN NORMAL MAN AND ITS USE IN THE EVALUATION OF BONE HEALING FOLLOWING RADIATION THERAPY IN METASTATIC DESEASE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBrady, L.W.; Croll, M.N.; Stanton, L.\n\n1962-02-01\n\nIt was concluded that radioactlve Ca/sup 47/ is an isotope suitable for the study of calcium metabolism in the body. It is easily traced by external counting technics. Local uptake measurements as well as ratios over various areas of the skeleton can be determined, thus yielding useful diagnostic information. It is a safe agent for use. It is possible to differentiate normal bone from areas of diseased bone using it. It is not useful for scintiscanning. It is grossly applicable in the evaluation of effects of radiation therapy to local metastatic lesions in bone. These observations support the fact thatmoreÂ Â» bone- seeking isotopes may well be useful as diagnostic agents for the evaluation of subradiographic metastases.

A secondary objective was to compare microstructural and strength parameters between men with normal, low, and osteoporosis-range areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Seventy-eight healthy male volunteers (mean age 62.4Â Â±Â 7.8Â years, range 50-84Â years) were recruited. The participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) of the ultra-distal radius and tibia. From the HR-pQCT images, volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical and trabecular bone microstructure were evaluated, and bone strength and cortical load fraction (Ct.LF) were estimated using micro-finite element analysis (Î¼FEA). Age was more strongly correlated with bone microstructure than other risk factors. Age had significant positive correlations with cortical porosity at both ultra-distal radius and tibia ( r Â =Â 0.36, p Â =Â 0.001, and r Â =Â 0.47, p Â <Â 0.001, respectively). At the tibia, age was negatively correlated with cortical BMD, whereas it was positively correlated with trabecular BMD. In Î¼FEA, age was negatively correlated with Ct.LF, although not with bone strength. Compared with men with normal aBMD, men with low or osteoporosis-range aBMD had significantly poor trabecular bone microstructure and lower bone strength at the both sites, while there was no significant difference in cortical bone. Cortical bone microstructure was negatively affected by aging, and there was a suggestion that the influence of aging may be particularly important at the weight-bearing sites.\n\nAnalysis of bone protein and mineral composition in bone disease using synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiller, Lisa M.; Hamerman, David; Chance, Mark R.; Carlson, Cathy S.\n\n1999-10-01\n\nInfrared (IR) microspectroscopy is an analytical technique that is highly sensitive to the chemical components in bone. The brightness of a synchrotron source permits the examination of individual regions of bone in situ at a spatial resolution superior to that of a conventional infrared source. At Beamlines U10B and U2B at the National Synchrotron Light Source, we are examining the role of bone chemical composition in bone disease. In osteoarthritis (OA), it has been demonstrated that the bone underlying the joint cartilage (subchondral bone) becomes thickened prior to cartilage breakdown. Using synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy, we have examined the chemical composition of the subchondral bone in histologically normal and OA monkeys. Results demonstrate that the subchondral bone of OA monkeys is significantly more mineralized than the normal bone, primarily due to an increase in carbonate concentration in the OA bone. High resolution analysis indicates that differences in carbonate content are uniform throughout the subchondral bone region, suggesting that high subchondral bone carbonate may be a marker for OA. Conversely, increases in phosphate content are more pronounced in the region near the marrow space, suggesting that, as the subchondral bone thickens, the bone also becomes more mineralized. Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by a reduction in bone mass and a skeleton that is more susceptible to fracture. To date, it is unclear whether bone remodeled after the onset of osteoporosis differs in chemical composition from older bone. Using fluorescence-assisted infrared microspectroscopy, we are comparing the composition of monkey bone remodeled at various time points after the onset of osteoporosis (induced by ovariectomy). We find that the chemical composition of bone remodeled one year after ovariectomy and one year prior to necropsy is similar to normal bone. On the other hand, bone remodeled two years after ovariectomy is less mature, indicated\n\nReduced vertebral bone density in hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPietschmann, F.; Breslau, N. A.; Pak, C. Y.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nDual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and single-photon absorptiometry were used to determine bone density at the lumbar spine and radial shaft in 62 patients with absorptive hypercalciuria, 27 patients with fasting hypercalciuria, and 31 nonhypercalciuric stone formers. Lumbar bone density was significantly lower in patients with absorptive (-10%) as well as in those with fasting hypercalciuria (-12%), with 74 and 92% of patients displaying values below the normal mean, whereas only 48% of the nonhypercalciuric stone formers had bone density values below the normal mean. In contrast, radial bone density was similar in all three groups of renal stone formers investigated. The comparison of urinary chemistry in patients with absorptive hypercalciuria and low normal bone density compared to those with high normal bone density showed a significantly increased 24 h urinary calcium excretion on random diet and a trend toward a higher 24 h urinary uric acid excretion and a higher body mass index in patients with low normal bone density. Moreover, among the patients with absorptive hypercalciuria we found a statistically significant correlation between the spinal bone density and the 24 h sodium and sulfate excretion and the urinary pH. These results gave evidence for an additional role of environmental factors (sodium and animal proteins) in the pathogenesis of bone loss in absorptive hypercalciuria. In conclusion, our data suggest an osteopenia of trabecular-rich bone tissues in patients with fasting and absorptive hypercalciurias.\n\nRadiographic absorptiometry method in measurement of localized alveolar bone density changes.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuhl, E D; Nummikoski, P V\n\n2000-03-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to measure the accuracy and precision of a radiographic absorptiometry method by using an occlusal density reference wedge in quantification of localized alveolar bone density changes. Twenty-two volunteer subjects had baseline and follow-up radiographs taken of mandibular premolar-molar regions with an occlusal density reference wedge in both films and added bone chips in the baseline films. The absolute bone equivalent densities were calculated in the areas that contained bone chips from the baseline and follow-up radiographs. The differences in densities described the masses of the added bone chips that were then compared with the true masses by using regression analysis. The correlation between the estimated and true bone-chip masses ranged from R = 0.82 to 0.94, depending on the background bone density. There was an average 22% overestimation of the mass of the bone chips when they were in low-density background, and up to 69% overestimation when in high-density background. The precision error of the method, which was calculated from duplicate bone density measurements of non-changing areas in both films, was 4.5%. The accuracy of the intraoral radiographic absorptiometry method is low when used for absolute quantification of bone density. However, the precision of the method is good and the correlation is linear, indicating that the method can be used for serial assessment of bone density changes at individual sites.\n\nWhat Is Breast in the Bone?\n\nPubMed\n\nShemanko, Carrie S; Cong, Yingying; Forsyth, Amanda\n\n2016-10-22\n\nThe normal developmental program that prolactin generates in the mammary gland is usurped in the cancerous process and can be used out of its normal cellular context at a site of secondary metastasis. Prolactin is a pleiotropic peptide hormone and cytokine that is secreted from the pituitary gland, as well as from normal and cancerous breast cells. Experimental and epidemiologic data suggest that prolactin is associated with mammary gland development, and also the increased risk of breast tumors and metastatic disease in postmenopausal women. Breast cancer spreads to the bone in approximately 70% of cases with advanced breast cancer. Despite treatment, new bone metastases will still occur in 30%-50% of patients. Only 20% of patients with bone metastases survive five years after the diagnosis of bone metastasis. The breast cancer cells in the bone microenvironment release soluble factors that engage osteoclasts and/or osteoblasts and result in bone breakdown. The breakdown of the bone matrix, in turn, enhances the proliferation of the cancer cells, creating a vicious cycle. Recently, it was shown that prolactin accelerated the breast cancer cell-mediated osteoclast differentiation and bone breakdown by the regulation of breast cancer-secreted proteins. Interestingly, prolactin has the potential to affect multiple proteins that are involved in both breast development and likely bone metastasis, as well. Prolactin has normal bone homeostatic roles and, combined with the natural \"recycling\" of proteins in different tissues that can be used for breast development and function, or in bone function, increases the impact of prolactin signaling in breast cancer bone metastases. Thus, this review will focus on the role of prolactin in breast development, bone homeostasis and in breast cancer to bone metastases, covering the molecular aspects of the vicious cycle.\n\nA single injection of the anabolic bone agent, parathyroid hormone-collagen binding domain (PTH-CBD), results in sustained increases in bone mineral density for up to 12 months in normal female mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nPonnapakkam, Tulasi; Katikaneni, Ranjitha; Suda, Hirofumi; Miyata, Shigeru; Matsushita, Osamu; Sakon, Joshua; Gensure, Robert C\n\n2012-09-01\n\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) is the most effective osteoporosis treatment, but it is only effective if administered by daily injections. We fused PTH(1-33) to a collagen binding domain (PTH-CBD) to extend its activity, and have shown an anabolic bone effect with monthly dosing. We tested the duration of action of this compound with different routes of administration. Normal young C57BL/6J mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of PTH-CBD (320 Î¼g/kg). PTH-CBD treated mice showed a 22.2 % increase in bone mineral density (BMD) at 6 months and 12.8 % increase at 12 months. When administered by subcutaneous injection, PTH-CBD again caused increases in BMD, 15.2 % at 6 months and 14.3 % at 12 months. Radiolabeled PTH-CBD was concentrated in bone and skin after either route of administration. We further investigated skin effects of PTH-CBD, and histological analysis revealed an apparent increase in anagen VI hair follicles. A single dose of PTH-CBD caused sustained increases in BMD by >10 % for 1 year in normal mice, regardless of the route of administration, thus showing promise as a potential osteoporosis therapy.\n\nGrowth hormone and bone health.\n\nPubMed\n\nBex, Marie; Bouillon, Roger\n\n2003-01-01\n\nGrowth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I have major effects on growth plate chondrocytes and all bone cells. Untreated childhood-onset GH deficiency (GHD) markedly impairs linear growth as well as three-dimensional bone size. Adult peak bone mass is therefore about 50% that of adults with normal height. This is mainly an effect on bone volume, whereas true bone mineral density (BMD; g/cm(3)) is virtually normal, as demonstrated in a large cohort of untreated Russian adults with childhood-onset GHD. The prevalence of fractures in these untreated childhood-onset GHD adults was, however, markedly and significantly increased in comparison with normal Russian adults. This clearly indicates that bone mass and bone size matter more than true bone density. Adequate treatment with GH can largely correct bone size and in several studies also bone mass, but it usually requires more than 5 years of continuous treatment. Adult-onset GHD decreases bone turnover and results in a mild deficit, generally between -0.5 and -1.0 z-score, in bone mineral content and BMD of the lumbar spine, radius and femoral neck. Cross-sectional surveys and the KIMS data suggest an increased incidence of fractures. GH replacement therapy increases bone turnover. The three controlled studies with follow-up periods of 18 and 24 months demonstrated a modest increase in BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck in male adults with adult-onset GHD, whereas no significant changes in BMD were observed in women. GHD, whether childhood- or adult-onset, impairs bone mass and strength. Appropriate substitution therapy can largely correct these deficiencies if given over a prolonged period.
