        "text": "Part 1:\n\nTwo movies by Gianni Di Gregorio\n\nPranzo di Ferragosto (“Mid-August Lunch”)\n\n(2008) Shot in his own apartment in Rome’s Trastevere neighborhood. He chose for his stars people he already knew, some good friends and some acquaintances who had never acted before. Good choices, Gianni! They are all “naturals,” and he uses their real first names as their “movie” names, including his disreputable-looking friend Viking, who seems to know where to get the freshest food when stores are closed, as long as he has his scooter to take him around Rome. Fabulous Valeria De Franciscis, who at the age of ninety-three, plays his mother Valeria, is a brilliant mix of charm, vanity, and manipulation as she rules with a velvet glove. Gianni’s real life props, a glass of white wine and a cigarette, feature in every scene, as an antidote for his comical and veiled exasperation.\n\nIt’s 2008, and Gianni and his mamma can’t pay their condo fees and can’t see a way out of their situation…until the condo administrator comes to the door with an offer they can’t refuse…take his mamma, Marina, and his aunt, Maria, for Ferragosto, the August 15th celebration at the peak of Italy’s vacation time and the hottest time of the year. Within minutes, his best friend and family doctor, Marcellino, shows up at the door with an urgent request that Gianni take his mother Grazia as well, since Marcellino has suddenly been called in to cover a night shift at the hospital. Now the characters are assembled, the scene is set, and the action, such as it is, is underway. The food is great too, and watching Gianni cook while managing his ubiquitous glasses of wine and cigarettes is impressive. He is a wonderful character, full of generosity, gentle irony, and quiet desperation. It’s all nuanced, and funny, and touching, as he and these ancient ladies (mainly) ad lib their way into your heart.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UWz_ojMzto&t=3s\n\nGianni e le donne (“The Salt of Life”)\n\nMade in 2011, although not truly a sequel to Pranzo di Ferragosto, is loosely one. Gianni Di Gregorio is once again the semi-autobiographical main character who writes, directs, and stars in this wry take on the mid-life crisis of a sixty-year-old Italian man. There’s more of a mix of professional and non-professional actors this time. The film is more polished than Pranzo di Ferragosto, but retains the same balance of humor, melancholy, and gentle irony, and at the center of it all, the generous, kind, and self-effacing Gianni. His movie mother, Valeria De Franciscis, once again takes center stage, but has managed to expand her talents for manipulation, guilt-tripping, and self-centeredness, while at the same time saying everything “in the nicest possible way.” And she now lives in a beautifully landscaped condominium complex (which Gianni, of course, can’t afford) and she spends her days hosting card parties al fresco, and drinking cases of expensive champagne with her argumentative and creaky girlfriends.\n\nThis time around, Gianni lets us have more of a view into his “real” life. We see that he is married to an attractive, confident woman, but their life together, though affectionate, has the familiar tone of a long-term marriage when the “shine” has worn off. In the movie, his daughter is played by his own daughter, his daughter and her boyfriend live with him as in real life, and his little black dog is played by his own little black dog. And his crisis of confidence in the movie, which is mostly about having become invisible to women, is also his own real-life crisis. (In an Interview with Gianni Di Gregorio which I recently read, he said, “You can’t go to your wife and say: women just don’t see me anymore. I have done it – my wife just laughed.”)\n\nGianni’s out of shape, middle-aged friend Alfonso (who plays the condo administrator in the earlier movie), claims to have succeeded in having affairs with sexy, young women, and pressures Gianni to follow his lead. But Gianni is truly a gentleman, and his several unsuccessful attempts with a parade of beautiful young women, though awkward and funny, also leave us with some of the ache we know he is feeling. He will never be the daring, dashing person he longs to be, and he knows it. But as it turns out, he can still dream!\n\nThese are two really delightful movies, and I’ve watched them more than once…real Italians, beautiful Rome, a story both comic and poignant at the same time, and the real, the lovable Gianni Di Gregorio. Watch these in sequence, and find them on Kanopy, or on DVD from CLAMS when we are up and running again.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb0wG-1Mjw\n\nPosted May 14, 2020\n\nPart 2:\n\nMovies starring celebrated Italian actor Marguerita Buy\n\nMia Madre (“My Mother”)\n\nIt’s a brilliant blend of warmth, charm and many emotions. Middle-aged social-realist film director Marguerita (played by Margherita Buy) tries to maintain control as her beloved mother Ada is dying, and ridiculously inept American actor Barry Huggins (John Turturro) is arriving to star in her latest film. She has recently broken up with her live-in boyfriend, Vittorio, one of her actors, who tells her that there is a reason relationships are so difficult for her. No one can do anything well enough for her. She tells her actors and her staff that they are totally incompetent, waving her arms, shouting “cut”, while giving them vague instructions which leave them looking completely bewildered. In other words, for Marguerita, “Il meglio è nemico del bel bene” (the perfect is the enemy of the good). And now she has Barry on her hands, with his protestations of having worked with Stanley Kubrick on multiple occasions, and his hysterical temper tantrums. In one fantastic scene, Marguerita and Barry have a shouting match in front of the whole crew in the middle of a scene, and if you don’t yet know the meaning of the word “stronzo,” you will have figured it out by the end of the scene.\n\nWhile she tries to spend as much time with her mother, a retired teacher of classics who is much loved and almost revered by her former students, Marguerita struggles with her guilt, and is torn between all her roles, including being a responsible mother to her lovely and loving teenage daughter Livia. Some of the most touching scenes are between Livia and her dying grandmother, who gently corrects and encourages Livia with her Latin, as the bond between them deepens. Although Marguerita is divorced, she and her former husband are attentive parents, and have put aside whatever differences they had in order to give Livia a secure relationship within her family.\n\nNanni Moretti, acclaimed director of this and many other movies, plays Marguerita’s gentle, loving brother. His understated acting, which reveals his profoundly compassionate nature, is central to his relationship with the other characters. They are both devoted to their mother, who entirely deserves their devotion. Giovanni has given up his job in order to do whatever can be done, as Ada lays dying in the hospital, and he fills in for Margherita without doing anything which ought to make her feel guilty. But her own guilt, anxiety, fear and denial show up in her dreams, which blend so much with her waking life that it is sometimes unclear what is dream and what is not. She is a person on her way to an understanding of herself, and of the way she has lived her life, including her effect on others. It is impossible not to like Marguerita and to feel empathy for her, and indeed for all the characters in this beautiful and insightful story. Even Barry Huggins (Turturro) turns out to be unexpectedly endearing!\n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/6cRTHncxnjMhttps://youtu.be/6cRTHncxnjM\n\nViaggio Sola (“A Five Star Life”)\n\n(2013) If your dream is to luxuriate in Five Star hotels in exotic locations, while being waited on hand and foot by obsequious attendants, well then, this one’s for you! Hotel inspector Irene (Marguerita Buy) is what is known in hotel circles as a Mystery Guest, unknown to Five Star hotel managers and staff until check-out time, when she reveals herself and passes judgement. From the moment she opens her laptop, pulls on her white gloves, and starts checking off her list, she is a consummate professional. But part of her job is to make sure that guests are treated well no matter who they are. You can just feel Irene’s satisfaction as she castigates a manager for his staff’s snubs of a young newlywed couple who are unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the unspoken rules…oh dear, they wore terrycloth “bathrobes” to the pool, not the correct “pool” robes!\n\nWhen back at home base in Italy, Irene’s most important relationships are with her harried musician sister and musician brother-in-law, her two young nieces, and her best friend and former lover, Andrea (dishy, award winning movie star Stefano Accorsi). Now she finds her sister constantly resentful and angry at her for her lack of commitment, and her seemingly selfish unattached lifestyle, so there is conflict there, and Irene seems confused by the state of affairs. Andrea has now gotten a young woman pregnant, and is confused about what should happen, so he is less available to Irene than he had been, though their relationship is still warm and loving. But these people she loves don’t hesitate to let her know what they think is lacking in her chosen lifestyle. And then a chance meeting at an elegant Berlin hotel with writer Kate Sherman (English actor Lesley Manville in a fascinating cameo), makes her re-examine her life through the lens of intimacy. The fallout from this encounter rattles her, and we can’t help but wonder whether she will find more satisfaction in following the path others point her toward or whether she will continue on the path she now follows. But don’t worry…all will be revealed!\n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/V8NKaij96Zo\n\nNot for me, but perhaps for you:\n\nI Giorni Dell’abbandono (“The Days of Abandonment”)\n\n(2018) Although Margherita Buy is brilliant in this movie, the melodrama is so over the top that for my personal tastes, I found it almost unwatchable. Many of you will know the story from Elena Ferrante’s book of the same name. Unsuspecting wife Olga, is dumped by her weak, cowardly, self-absorbed husband Mario (Luca Zingaretti of “Inspector Montalbano” fame) for one of his sexy, young students, leaving her alone with their two children. This may be one of the uglier movie breakups I’ve seen. Swinging from rage to despair and back to rage, Olga loses all sense of self-respect and dignity, and descends into a truly bleak and dark emotional abyss, from which she eventually claws her way back. It was hard for me to take this movie very seriously. Margherita Buy is a great actress, and her gift for subtlety, which I admire so much, was nowhere to be found in this her most recent movie, though many of her other dramatic skills are fully on display. (This one is for lovers of sensational high melodrama!)\n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/VYnU-9mz31A\n\nGiorni e nuvole (“Days and Clouds”)\n\n(2007) This story of a marriage and the influence of sudden financial loss on a couple’s way of life has moments of great beauty as well as tremendous emotional pain for the protagonists. Filmed in the industrial seaport city of Genoa on the Ligurian coast, this is not a movie in which the glorious beauty of Italy will soften the story’s realism. Genoa has its own presence, which seems rather utilitarian and cold because of the angles from which it is photographed.\n\nElsa (Margherita Buy) and her husband Michele (Antonio Albanese) are a well-off middle aged couple living in a beautiful apartment, full of valuable art and antiques. Their 20 year old daughter Alice runs an intimate restaurant along with her former boyfriend, and is now living with her new man. But she is close with her parents, and makes frequent appearances at their home. Elsa, in the movie’s opening scene, is showing a slide presentation of an ancient ceiling fresco she is uncovering and restoring, which is well-received by the board of professors who will grant her a higher degree in her field. She joins her young colleagues at the site of the restoration, and it is clear how moved she is by the work, how intuitive she is, and how important this part of her life, this sublime art, is to her. To celebrate her successful completion of her degree, Michele has presented her with an expensive gift and has made her a sumptuous surprise party, filling their large apartment with guests, and even a live band.But Michele has been waiting for Elsa to complete her degree before revealing the sobering truth to her. He has been betrayed by his best friend, the co-owner of his company, and has been unemployed for the past two months, pretending to be at work while hiding out on his boat. Everything must go, their home, their boat, their entire lifestyle must be drastically reduced. Elsa must take low-skill jobs which curtail her restoration project, and Michele must find something, anything, that will bring in money and perhaps lift him from depression and despair. This movie is the story of a couple’s love, and how difficult financial circumstances challenge this love and take it almost to the point of no return. Director Silvio Soldini is responsible for some amazing direction of these fine actors. Some of the minor roles are filled by his “ensemble” actors from previous films (including “Pane e Tulipani,” one of my favorite movies).\n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/V8NKaij96Zo\n\nPosted May 21, 2020\n\nPart 3:\n\nSophia, Marcello, and Vittorio\n\nThe magnificent Sophia Loren is showcased in these movies in the full range of her talents, her ability to convincingly portray deep emotion, her versatility, her tremendous allure, and her unforgettable beauty. During her long career, she has appeared in ninety-eight films, co-starring in seventeen with Marcello Mastroianni. Among many international awards she has received, Sophia Loren also won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her harrowing role in “Two Women” (1960), also directed by Vittorio De Sica. It was the first Oscar ever given for a performance in a “foreign language” film.\n\nMarcello Mastroianni, considered the greatest and most prolific of Italian movie actors, was a great foil for Sophia Loren’s performances, with his sometimes urbane, sometimes romantic, yet often bumbling characterizations. Although he is perhaps most well-known for his breakout roles in Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” and later in “8 ½,” his talent for comedy is without doubt. His roles in “Ieri, Oggi, e Domani” and “Marriage Italian Style,” as well as earlier roles including his homicidal nobleman with the memorable “tic” in “Divorce Italian Style” (also highly recommended and available through CLAMS), are prime examples. If you like silly sex romps, Marcello is very funny in “Casanova 70,” available on Kanopy.\n\nVittorio De Sica was an actor, and a renowned filmmaker of the Neo-realist movement, with award-winning films such as “The Bicycle Thieves” and “Umberto D” to his credit. The thirty-five films he directed crossed over into diverse genres, including “Commedia all’italiana,” of which “Ieri, Oggi, e Domani” is a good illustration. De Sica was a matinee idol beginning with “talkies,” and appeared in one hundred and sixty two movies over the course of his long career. Sophia Loren was his favorite actress to direct.\n\nIeri, Oggi e Domani (“Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow”)\n\n(1963) “Ieri, Oggi, e Domani” is the type of film known as an “anthology,” composed of three separate stories and based in three of the great Italian cities. Each segment is named for the main female character, played by Sophia Loren. She co-stars with Marcello Mastroianni here, in a range of comic roles.\n\n“Adelina” (Naples), is based on the true story of Concetta Muccardi, a street vendor of black market cigarettes who, as a way of keeping out of prison, had nineteen pregnancies resulting in seven live births. Adelina (played by Sophia) is busted frequently by the carabinieri at her tiny stall in a working class district of Naples. But she has found a way to stay out of jail…a loophole in Italian law at the time said that a woman could not be jailed if she was pregnant and for six months following the birth of the child. Adelina now has had seven children in eight years and her poor out-of-work husband Carmine (Marcello) is exhausted. He is too tired to contribute to the “production” of more children. One of the classic comic scenes involves a misunderstanding with their family doctor, who incorrectly assumes they want to find a way to not have more children, when for Adelina, the opposite is true. Now that Carmine says he’s not up for it, Adelina must make a choice: get impregnated by family friend Pasquale, or go to prison. The way the entire community rallies around Adelina, Carmine, and their children is wonderful…Neapolitans at their best!\n\n“Anna” (Milan) is the wife of a wealthy industrialist, and spends her days in charitable meetings, and other amusements of the super-rich. In an opening scene of remarkable detachment, we are inside a Rolls Royce convertible, watching Milan pass by, as the unseen driver, (we see only her hands on the steering wheel), Anna (played by Sophia Loren), recites a catalog of what she will be doing for the day. As it turns out, it includes picking up her lover, Renzo (Marcello), along a street where he has parked his small, inexpensive vehicle. This is the shortest of the three stories, for the very reason that their relationship is not much, or even nothing, really. Anna is playing a role. It’s as if she is a caricature of a woman having a passionate, illicit relationship. The question eventually arises, though…does she care more for her Rolls Royce, or for her lover?\n\nMatrimonio all’italiana (“Marriage Italian Style”)\n\n(1964) One of the many adaptations of a popular play “Filumena Marturano,”written at the end of World War II by Eduardo De Filippo, “Marriage Italian Style” is the most famous retelling of the story. Although De Sica uses flashback techniques in this movie, he doesn’t over-use them in the way many directors have done. The first flashback scene is to a brothel during a WWII air raid at Naples. While patrons and the “women of the house” are fleeing to the shelters in a state of disarray, the debonair businessman Domenico, “Don Dummi,” (pronounced Doo’mee), nonchalantly adjusting his clothes, is the last to leave. He hears a noise and finds terrified seventeen-year-old Filumena cowering in a cupboard as bombs explode nearby. We never learn for sure why her hair is cropped; we just know that she is too ashamed and frightened to leave and so she remains, clinging to Domenico, her innocent eyes pleading.\n\nIn the next scene, two years later, Filumena has transformed herself into a self-confident, redheaded “bombshell” in her own right, and tells Domenico that she now has the best room in the “house.” And it is from here that their relationship, which lasts twenty-two years, begins. She loves him, and he plays at loving her, but she has to keep her regular clients until the time when he finally makes her his full-time mistress. He continues to take off on trips for months at a time, indulging himself in relationships with a string of women. (Honestly, don’t you think Sophia Loren would be enough for anyone!?)\n\nIn time, Domenico moves Filumena into his family home as unpaid housekeeper and bedpan wielder for his truly repulsive mother. (She’s so appalling that she’s funny, and thankfully only plays a “cameo” role). Filumena is used and humiliated as the years pass, and she is now in charge of the family bakery business, which allows Dummi to take off for parts unknown whenever he feels like it, while she wears herself out slaving for him. But he eventually goes too far, at which point the real drama begins. We are now back to the very first scene in the movie, where Filumena is being carried into the house by neighbors, apparently at death’s door. She has a secret she has been keeping for years, and she will eventually have her way, no matter what. You can count on it.\n\nNo one can portray contempt like Sophia Loren; her expressive face, her body language, the way she uses her clothing, her language itself, are all redolent of it as she turns her fury on the contemptible “Dummi.” And yet in following scenes, she is the embodiment of dignity, courage, and self-sacrifice. All her talents aside, though, this is absolutely great direction on the part of De Sica, and at the end of the movie, it would not be inappropriate to stand and applaud.\n\nBelow is the Italian (with English subtitles) movie trailer. It was surprising not to find an American one, since the movie was very popular here at the time of its release. Colorful language you wouldn’t find in an American movie trailer in 1964!\n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/qZ2DQ8Vc1Sk\n\nPart 4:\n\nA masterpiece: Cinema Paradiso\n\n(1989) Just after the end of WWll in the village of Giancaldo on the Island of Sicily there lives a little boy, Salvatore, nicknamed Totò, who falls in love with “the movies.” This is the story of his lifelong enchantment with cinema, as a small child (Salvatore Cascio), as a love-struck adolescent (Marco Leonardi), and as a successful, though lost, middle-aged filmmaker (Jacques Perrin) who finds himself once again. It is also the story of a town’s people, and how their lives are inextricably linked to a building called Cinema Paradiso, where they bellow with laughter, shout each other down, make love, and shed copious tears in a way that is quintessentially Italian.\n\nCinema Paradiso, an Italian/French co-production, is an Italian movie nevertheless, in the Italian language, and with English subtitles in the version you will most likely see. Two of the lead actors are French (Philippe Noiret and Jacques Perrin) and their lines are dubbed in Italian, although the dubbing is so well done, you’re not likely to notice it. This wonderful, perfect movie, written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, won a string of awards from Cannes to Hollywood, garnering the 1989 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The musical score by the brilliant and prolific composer Ennio Morricone (with son Andrea) is so beautiful and so memorable, it will give you an “earworm”…one that you won’t really mind.\n\nThe movie begins with a serene view from a window on the coast of Sicily. An anxious, elderly woman is trying to reach her grown son by telephone. The wealthy and successful middle-aged filmmaker Salvatore Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) arrives late in the evening to his grand apartment in Rome and learns of the message his mother has left. His old friend Alfredo has died; the funeral will be held the following day in Giancaldo, Salvatore’s hometown which he has not returned to in thirty years. The director masterfully uses flashback as a narrative technique to lead us back to the eight-year-old Totò as he emerges from the rubble of war and becomes a young man. One of the curious things about the movie is that there seems to be no attempt to show any continuity of physical resemblance between the three actors playing Salvatore (Totò), and yet it works.\n\nTotò is perhaps the most beguiling child you may ever see in a movie. He has such a mobile face, full of laughter, mischief, and at times sadness, though it passes quickly for him, as he is on to the next exciting or funny thing. His father is missing in action on the Russian front, and his mother’s emotions swing from angry to grief-stricken. In time, the family learns that the handsome young husband and father has indeed died, leaving behind his image in a couple of photographs. Toto’s true father figure becomes Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), the childless, middle-aged projectionist at the small village movie theater which, apart from the church, is the central gathering place for the people of Giancaldo. Alfredo’s passion for the movies is young Totò’s as well, and the little boy teases and torments the older man until he finally gives in, training the child in the magic of the projection booth. A deep affection between them grows as they face adversity together\n\nOne scene beautifully dissolves into another and reveals the teen-aged Totò (Marco Leonardi), and the now blind Alfredo. They rely on each other, and their relationship becomes even closer and more mature. A new theme of romantic love (unrequited, then requited, and then lost) enters the frame as Totò, holding his first amateur movie camera, observes through his lens the arrival of the luminous, refined, and self-contained Elena (Agnese Nano). Their relationship of only six months thrusts him into the next stage of his life, since he has now become acquainted with great joy and deep pain. When he returns for Alfredo’s funeral, we see that the pain of loss has left its imprint on him even as a middle-aged man. It continues to direct the way in which he lives his life until, in the final scene (one of the most beautiful and memorable in movie history), Salvatore is opened once more to an experience of joy.\n\nThis movie is available on DVD at the Provincetown Public Library or through other affiliated CLAMS libraries.\n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/stLekU5BnbI\n\nPart 5:\n\nAnother masterpiece: Il Postino (“The Postman”)\n\nCritically acclaimed winner of numerous international awards, including Massimo Troisi for best actor, Philippe Noiret (of Cinema Paradiso) for best supporting actor, and Michael Radford for best director, there is no question that Il Postino is one of the best-loved of all Italian movies.\n\nThe story asks the question, “What would happen if fictional character Mario Ruopolo (Massimo Troisi), a dissatisfied and ill-educated fisherman living on a small island near Naples, and the world-famous, very real Chilean Nobel Prize-winning poet and lover Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret) were to meet and form a friendship?” The answer is, “This beautiful film.”\n\nIn reality, although Neruda never came to Italy, he did spend time in Europe when he was exiled from Chile during its repressive right-wing regimes. In Il Postino, set in 1950 when the secular left-wing Italian Communist Party was popular and influential, themes of social justice resonate, and so Neruda is a hero to many. Not only that, though a rather dumpy middle-aged man, he is wildly attractive to women as a result of his personal magnetism and romantic/erotic love poems (check out “The Captain’s Verses”). In the local theater on his island home, Mario watches in fascination as newsreel-style footage shows huge crowds at the train station in Rome cheering the arrival of Pablo Neruda and his lovely third wife Mathilde (Anna Bonaiuto). The Italian government welcomes and supports them, but to placate the Chilean government, Neruda has agreed to live in exile on a small island mountaintop. And of course, it is Mario’s island.\n\nMario is a sensitive and gentle soul, humble and soft-spoken. His father is a fisherman, disappointed that his son has neither the will nor the skill to fish successfully. When Mario sees a sign on the door of the post office advertising a temporary part-time job for anyone owning a bicycle, he hesitantly walks in and applies. Here he meets the “Telegrapher” (Renato Scarpa) who hires him as a postman with only one customer: Pablo Neruda. Most of his mail is from women, as Mario and the Telegrapher note while sorting the great man’s letters at the post office in a very funny, though understated, scene. Every day, Mario now rides his bicycle up the mountain road to hand deliver Neruda’s mail, and we see him in a series of long shots which are almost too beautiful to be real. But that’s the Italian coast…and it is real.\n\nTo create the stunning backdrop and perfect atmosphere, director Michael Radford chose the island of Procida in the Bay of Naples to re-create a 1950s waterfront town scape, and Pollara on the Island of Salina in the Aeolian Islands off Sicily for the breathtaking mountain vistas and dramatic beaches. (Perhaps it’s only coincidental that the active volcano, location for Rossellini’s classic of Italian neo-realism, Stromboli, filmed in 1950, looms in the distance.)\n\nDuring his mail deliveries, in spite of Mario’s shyness and insecurity, his curiosity, longing for a different way of life, and newly-formed desire to become a poet give him the courage to approach Pablo Neruda. Mario lingers in the doorway until he is noticed, and attempts to engage the poet as much as he can, given his limited resources versus Neruda’s almost limitless power with words. Through generosity and perhaps some boredom on the part of Neruda, and innocence and persistence on the part of Mario, a touching friendship grows between the two men.\n\nOne day the postman sees, through the open door, Neruda and his wife Mathilde dancing a graceful and passionate tango, their eyes locked on one another’s. Mario is mesmerized by this scene, and stores it in his memory as a vision he recalls later in the film. The scene wakes him up to the possibility of love, which soon appears to his modest, simple self in the form of the beautiful, provocative Beatrice Russo (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), just arrived from Sicily to work in her aunt’s bar on the waterfront. As they play a game of table football, Beatrice’s languorous and almost hostile sensuality, and Mario’s look of wonder and painful longing play off each other in one of the movie’s best-known scenes. Mario has lost his heart, but how can this simple, self-deprecating man win the love of this desirable woman, especially under the eye of her forceful guardian, Donna Rosa (Linda Moretti, one of the great comic figures of the movie)? The answer turns out to be poetry, specifically metàforo (metaphor) as revealed to him by his friend Neruda in a beautiful scene on a beach. There is gentleness and reverence even in the way Mario holds and caresses his postman’s cap as they talk. His hand’s gestures are typically and expressively Neapolitan, yet so graceful and poetic.\n\nWhen Neruda eventually returns to Chile, we see that his politics of social justice have awakened in Mario a sense of outrage at the oppression of the islanders by a powerful, off-island, perhaps even Mafia-protected politician. The people are lied to and exploited, so Mario finds his courage in a wonderful scene where he fearlessly confronts the smooth-talking, oily politician. As the rest of the story unfolds, Mario’s poetic nature and his yearning for justice continue to develop, as does his love for Beatrice, and his love for his mentor and friend, the great poet Neruda.\n\nMassimo Troisi (Mario) was not only a well-loved stage comedian and comic actor, but also a screenwriter who came across the story, adapted it, and believed that Il Postino had to be made at whatever cost. He was sure that Michael Radford was the one to direct it. Troisi threw himself heart and soul into the project, and the result is this wonderful jewel of a movie. The film’s score, composed by Luis Enríquez Bacalov, won the Academy Award for Best Music (Original Dramatic Score). Director Michael Radford first approached the famous composer of the score for Cinema Paradiso, Ennio Morricone. Radford wanted the music to feel “discreet” but Morricone declined the job saying, “I don’t do discreet.” What composer Bacalov gives us in this score is a simplicity and sweetness that touches the heart, in the same way that the movie itself does.\n\nIf you are someone who likes to watch the director’s audio commentary, this DVD includes that as well. There is a back story to the making of this film which is incredibly moving. But please, watch the entire movie first!\n\nThis movie is available on DVD at the Provincetown Public Library or through other affiliated CLAMS libraries.\n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/yIy6tHyuVdM\n\nPart 6:Croce e Delizia (“An Almost Ordinary Summer”)\n\nGeneral release 2019. Though not really a “film aficionado,” I did happen to snag the very last ticket at the Provincetown Film Festival a couple of years ago for this terrific movie, disappointing my husband, who had to stay home with a book. But how could I help it? This movie is Italian, a comedy and romance, and stars Alessandro Gassmann, a major crush of mine (una cotta grande?). It was so entertaining I wanted to share it, and so I had some adventures due to my meagre language skills, eventually negotiating the purchase of a DVD from a long-suffering Italian vendor. You, on the other hand, won’t have to go to extreme measures to see An Almost Ordinary Summer. Just go to your CLAMS account and get in the “Hold” queue.\n\nThe Premise:\n\nIn this funny and touching movie, a working-class widower, broken-hearted and panic-stricken after his wife’s death, meets an aristocratic art dealer at a hospital in Rome while they are both awaiting colonoscopy results. Opposites attract, and the two men fall in love, leading to all kind of family complications and confrontations.\n\nThe movie begins a year and a half into their relationship, during three weeks in the summer leading up to the secretly planned wedding between these two paterfamilias of the Castelvecchio and Petagna families. Carlo and family are on their way to a “vacation rental” on the coast south of Rome, ready for a good time. In fact, they arrive with their inflatable “banana boat” at the Castelvecchio estate, where they will be housed at the family’s surprisingly rustic “guesthouse.” Toni and Carlo have hatched a plan to get the families together so that they can share the news of their engagement and their impending nuptials. Toni doesn’t foresee any problems clouding his horizon (he’s far too self-centered), but Carlo is a wreck and for good reason. Introducing and blending their wildly different families and their clash of values will be a real project, which immediately seems doomed to failure.\n\nTwo Complicated Families:\n\nLa Famiglia Castelvecchio:\n\nis led by father Toni (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), and includes:\n\nhis free-wheeling sister Ida;\n\nher boyfriend, loopy stoner Gianlucone;\n\nToni’s laissez-faire Parisian television-star daughter Olivia;\n\nher appealing and studious young daughter, Elodie;\n\nthe neurotic Penelope (Jasmine Trinca), pre-school principal and daughter of Toni;\n\nand Giulietta, Vogue correspondent, former partner of Toni for thirty years and Penelope’s mother.\n\nLa Famiglia Petagna: is led by Carlo (Alessandro Gassmann), widowed husband of Ornella, and includes:\n\nchildren of Ornella and Carlo:\n\neldest son, hot-headed Sandro (Filippo Scicchitano);\n\nand much younger son, wistful pre-teen, Diego;\n\nSandro’s jealous, ear-splitting though adorable pregnant wife, Carolina;\n\nand their young son.\n\nMost of the scenes are shot in the coastal town of Gaeta and the surrounding area, seventy-five miles south of Rome, where villas of the wealthy perch on wild promontories overlooking pristine beaches. It’s the good life for the Castelvecchio family. Rich, cultured, intelligent, sophisticated, aristocratic….and most definitely snobs. Carlo and eldest son Sandro of the Petagna family are working-class fishermen. Their family is loud, emotional, and conservative: they are soccer fanatics for their home team (Lazio), and have their own set of prejudices though, regarding the privileged classes.\n\nIt doesn’t take long for the two eldest children, Penelope Castelvecchio and Sandro Petagna to come to an agreement that they will do whatever it takes to derail the wedding plans. Penelope is deeply resentful of her father. Toni has been the most self-centered and benignly negligent father imaginable. He often confuses his two daughters (from different mothers), while Carlo has never been anything less than a loving husband and attentive father. So while Sandro also wants to stop the wedding, he suffers over the pain he knows it will cause his father. Penelope drives this plan, and her ineptitude is hilarious. The other Castelvecchios don’t seem to care one way or another about which way the relationship goes, keeping themselves mostly busy passing joints around the swimming pool and tormenting Sandro’s wife Carolina with their snarky questions. Penelope enlists her mother, Giulietta, to come and support her, which adds even more complications. Giulietta has her own resentments toward Toni, who cheated on her frequently with both sexes, and by the way, failed to marry her. Things are not looking great for the wedding of Carlo and Toni, especially since the selfish Toni will have to take a good, hard look at himself if he doesn’t want to blow up his own wedding.\n\nThe English title of the movie, An Almost Ordinary Summer, has nothing whatsoever to do with the original Italian title, Croce e Delizia, which translates as Curse and Blessing, echoing the great duet of the same name from the opera La Traviata. Castelvecchio’s eldest daughter Penelope uses these words to describe her father Toni as “more Curse than Blessing.” Here’s where I get to heap praise on actress Jasmine Trinca (Penelope). Even among a superb ensemble of actors, she plays by far the most complex character in the movie, with the greatest emotional range and with the most memorable lines. Even if you’ve never had a panic attack of your very own, you will recognize how vivid and realistic Trinca’s portrayal really is. And she’s also funny!\n\nEnjoy this entertaining, funny movie. The audience at the Provincetown Film Festival couldn’t stop laughing!\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/analmostordinarysummer/3776416\n\nPart 7:\n\nIl Commissario Montalbano (”Detective Montalbano”)\n\n1999-present—Montalbano and the Coroner’s Cannoli\n\nThe Italians seem to really like television detective/crime series, and there are quite a few that are available on DVD with English subtitles….Inspector Vivaldi, Inspector Nardone, Inspector Coliandro, and even Donna (“Lady”) Detective. Also Inspector Manara, The Bastards of Pizzofalcone, and the Italian remake of Nero Wolfe, all of which will be covered here soon. But most popular, and longest running by far is the Detective Montalbano series, scripted from a seemingly endless well of stories by noted Sicilian author Andrea Camilleri. As I count, Camilleri, who died last year at the age of ninety-three, wrote twenty-seven novels as well as a multitude of short stories featuring Commissario Salvo Montalbano. The popularity of this character even spawned a prequel series, Young Montalbano.\n\nThe locations for Camilleri’s imaginary towns of Vigata and Montelusa are a patchwork of several coastal towns and the surrounding country within the southernmost tip of the Island of Sicily. Many of the scenes seem to be filmed early in the morning before the residents are abroad, as there is often an eerie emptiness to the bleached out streets of Ragusa that makes a dramatic backdrop for the action. It’s a strange kind of beauty. The location of Montalbano’s apartment, meant to be the imaginary Marinella, an area of the imaginary Vigata, is actually a beachfront neighborhood in the beautiful town of Punta Secca, complete with lighthouse. Many of the episodes begin with Salvo’s morning swim, and sometimes he finds things we’d rather not find at the beach! The various towns used for the film locations have greatly increased their income from tourism due to the popularity of the series, and the residents seem to welcome “Montalbano’s pilgrims.”\n\nThe Detective Montalbano series has been running for twenty years, with the same lead actor and, for the most part, the same supporting actors, which in itself is completely amazing. They seem so real, partly because they are extremely gifted actors, and partly because we have watched them age over the years in real time. Salvo Montalbano (Luca Zingaretti) is an interesting mix of character traits. He is ever faithful to his long-distance girlfriend Livia, and sees her only intermittently, since she lives far to the north in Genoa. And yet, if she phones him at an inconvenient time (in other words, when he is hungry), he has no problem making up some sad excuse to cheat on her with several cannoli. There have been three actresses who have filled the role of Livia over the years, and in some seasons we only get to hear her voice at the other end of the phone. Though Salvo is a “real tough guy,” he is often at the receiving end of one of Livia’s well-deserved tongue-lashings, from which he emerges both chastened and bewildered (and hungry). He’s a hot-head (though rarely out of control), deeply intelligent, intuitive, and a man of integrity, compassionate, likable, and with great personal charm. But he does, on occasion, display childish self-absorption when it comes to his obsession with food. When his friend Calògero, owner of his favorite local seafood eatery tells him that he will be retiring, Montalbano’s mouth drops open and he responds, “But what about me?” Adding richness and complexity to his character are various dream sequences where, as is often the way with dreams, his deepest fears and his truest desires are revealed.\n\nSalvo’s close friend, and second in command, “Mimi” Augello (Cesare Bocci) is a world-class ladies’ man who too often can’t control his impulses, even becoming entangled with suspects while Salvo does his best to mitigate the risk. Augello is competitive and can be resentful of Montalbano’s authority, which leads him into troubling situations. Detective Fazio (Peppino Mazzotto) is analytical, efficient, loyal, and always has Montalbano’s back. He’s the youngest member of the team, and very appealing. Officer Catarella (Angelo Russo) is the comic relief in each episode. He is a complete bumbler, confusing names, walking into doors, sometimes falling on his face, and can usually be found in a state of hysteria somewhere around the police station. Eventually, he is sent on a computer course and turns out, to his colleagues’ astonishment, to be a computer genius. Though he now has become a useful member of the team, his talent for physical comedy is still front and center.\n\nMany of the crimes Montalbano and his team investigate are fairly dark and brutal. Often the stories revolve around Mafia killings by the Cuffaro and Sinagra families (it is Sicily, after all), as well as sexual violence, so be forewarned. This won’t bother most true aficionados of crime dramas. I’m not one, so if you are more interested in the characters and their relationships, there is also plenty here to sink your teeth into. And well mixed in are scenes that are truly absurd and very funny, leaving Montalbano with a look of stupefaction on his face.\n\nThat director Alberto Sironi, who died in 2019, chose true Sicilians to fill all the secondary roles and those of the extras adds a dimension of verisimilitude unlike what we see in most television series. He had to convince the producers, who feared that Italian viewers would not understand the Sicilian dialect, to allow him to spend months visiting Sicily’s regional theaters to choose the actors. They are really, really good and provide the flavor of the region which would not have been served by “Italian” actors.\n\nYou can order all of Andrea Camilleri’s books, the Detective Montalbano DVD series, and Young Montalbano through CLAMS (clamsnet.org). In addition, you can stream the first 28 of the 37 episodes of Detective Montalbano on Hoopla, available to Massachusetts residents with a Boston Public Library free ecard.

It is, on the other hand, terrifically entertaining, loaded with humor, replete with engaging mysteries, sexy (in a PG-13 sort of way), touchingly sentimental, and with an extremely likeable main character, the “dazzling” Luca Manara (it says so on the DVD cover!).\n\nInspector Manara is a spinoff of a detective series called Una Famiglia in Giallo (A Family in Yellow) which aired for one season of only six episodes on RAI (the national public broadcasting station of Italy). Unfortunately, it’s impossible to find any of those episodes with English subtitles. In the next to last episode of Giallo, actor Guido Caprino appears, and playing only a secondary role, steals the show. He must have “dazzled” the producers to such a degree that they decided to feature him in a new series, Inspector Manara, retaining most of the excellent supporting cast of Una Familglia in Giallo in their previous roles. And fortunately for us, the entire twenty-four episodes of Manara are available with English subtitles on DVD.\n\nLuca Manara (Guido Caprino) is a Sicilian police detective who was recently stationed at his thrilling dream assignment in Milan, but has just been transferred to a small town in Southern Tuscany due to some troublesome behavior on the job (“I didn’t know she was the Chief’s wife!”). He rides a motorcycle, wears a bomber jacket, loves jazz and plays saxophone (though badly), and sports facial hair in the manner of his idol, Frank Zappa; the officers at the tiny police station are flabbergasted by his announcement that he’s their new chief. But he wins them over immediately, introducing himself as “Luca”, and roaring off on his motorcycle to solve a murder case within the first few minutes of his arrival.\n\nThough a bit goofy and clueless, Luca is irresistible to women; so his Achilles heel, not surprisingly, is women. They can’t keep away from him, and he doesn’t try very hard to keep away from them. If a baby (girl) is crying, all he has to do is pick her up and she’s smiling again. Old ladies tell him he’s so handsome, and ask if he’s an angel! Though he has lots of flings, it’s all pretty innocent. He’s basically a nice, unattached guy who doesn’t mean any harm. He has some adventures with the glamorous, redheaded, and always available coroner, Ginevra (Jane Alexander), among several others, but things get complicated with the arrival of Luca’s new Inspector Lara Rubino (Roberta Giarrusso). The two were classmates in their student days at the Police Academy, and though the attraction between them is immediately obvious to everyone, she has a low opinion of him thanks to some objectionable behavior while they were students. She hints at it, he can’t remember what he could have done, and since they have to work together so closely, their rocky and romantic relationship is threaded through all twenty-four episodes.\n\nThe supporting cast is wonderful. Since he’s always hoping to be called back to the excitement of Milan, Luca has taken up temporary residence in a rural guesthouse. The widowed owner Ada (Daniela Morozzi) becomes a friend and confidant, while providing a much-needed dose ofmothering along with wake up calls and late night card games. Although she has tremendous affection for Luca, she feels free to give him a piece of her mind when she thinks he deserves it: “You know, you suck with women, you really do!” (Even so, without condescension, Luca shows great respect for the deep intelligence and intuition of his female colleagues.) Lara also gets plenty of mothering and sage advice from her Aunt Caterina (Valeria Valeri), a warm, kind woman, who knows everyone in the community and often provides key information which aids in solving the current mystery. At the station, Sardi (Lucia Ocone) and Toscani (Augusto Fornari) are married officers. He’s usually frantic because she wants to get pregnant and harasses him for pro-creational sex. Officers Quattroni, Barbagallo, and Buttafuoco keep us laughing. And Manara tries as much as possible to avoid annoying phone calls from his adoring mother and two older sisters in Sicily. Before hanging up, he sometimes adds sotto voce, “and don’t call me Bubù!”\n\nUnlike most crime series, there is not a great deal of violence. Usually the murder victim is discovered in the first scene of each episode perhaps by a servant or family member; the victim has been hit on the head, or poisoned, or stabbed but in most of the episodes nothing too graphic or gory has happened. The rest of the show is about solving the mystery and about the relationships between the characters. It seems unusual, also, that the murderers are seldom hard-boiled killers. Frequently, they are victims of extenuating circumstances, and we see that Luca regards them with compassion. Surprisingly, he has very little ego. In one episode, when the solution to a crime finally strikes him, he says, “Montalbano would have caught that immediately!” Though he characteristically instructs his staff to “Look alive!” (“Occhio vivo!”), he’s mostly a laid back boss. He relies on his intuition, on the skill of his coworkers, and on his frequently unorthodox methods and unauthorized investigations which cause him continual trouble with his ridiculous and emotional superior, Superintendent Casadio. Luca is physically fearless, takes tremendous risks, often fails to have backup, and in a way seems to be an alter ego for actor Guido Caprino, who is extremely athletic and performs many of his own stunts. Series scriptwriter Daniele Falleri claims that “Manara is a hero in spite of himself!”\n\nThe word “beautiful” may appropriately be applied to the film locations of this series. The Museo Civico in the town of Trevignano Romano on Lago Bracciano near Rome does duty as the police station for the series. Otherwise, most of the locations are in the Maremma, a coastal region of Southern Tuscany which features Il Parco Regionale della Maremma, much like our own Cape Cod National Seashore. Unlike the Montalbano series’ imaginary town of Vigata, the fictional home of Inspector Manara, though also a patchwork of several real towns, is never named. But we can vicariously enjoy the beauty of Grosetto, Orbetello, and stunning Monte Argentario in the twelve episodes of Season One, and another twelve episodes of Series Two.\n\nFull disclosure: I have binge-watched this series (twice). You can order both series through clamsnet.org with your CLAMS library card.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YyUgA-DdNtQ\n\nPart 9:\n\nPane e Tulipani (“Bread and Tulips”)\n\n2001.

But just because movies by the Great Italian Filmmakers I was exposed to in my younger days at “art film houses” were often extremely disturbing to me for various reasons, that’s no reason you shouldn’t enjoy them. So, to be fair, I thought I’d do a post with links to trailers which embody the spirit of classic Italian film genres, and if you are a lover of Italian film, you’re probably already way ahead of me!\n\nAll film titles below in bold italics are available on DVD with your CLAMS library card.\n\nNeorealism, the “Golden Age” of Italian film, was birthed by the horrors of WW II and its aftermath, and is characterized by themes of poverty, suffering and despair among the poor and working classes. Often non-professional actors were used, as in Visconti’s La Terra Trema, which concerns the hardships of post-war Sicilian fishing families. Some major proponents of the movement were:\n\nVittorio De Sica, Bicycle Thieves (1948), Umberto D\n\nhttps://youtu.be/H2P4xo9kmPM\n\nRoberto Rossellini, Rome Open City (1945), Paisan, and others.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/c1P1JRSJT6Q\n\nLuchino Visconti, La Terra Trema (1948). (One of the famous kisses excised by the priest in Cinema Paradiso comes from this film. You’ll be seeing more of Visconti and his later sumptuous “period” films in a future post.)\n\nPart 11:\n\nFour Documentaries\n\nSpettacolo Available on Kanopy, Hoopla, and CLAMS\n\n(2017) The beautiful medieval hill town of Monticchiello in Tuscany and its Teatro Povero (Poor Theater) is the subject of the wondrous documentary, Spettacolo (translation: “Show”). In the 1960s, the residents of Monticchiello began practicing what they called “autodramma,” culminating in an annual performance in the main piazza at the height of the summer season. Though the film was made by two Americans, Jeff Malmberg and Chris Shellen, they remain invisible throughout the production; the feel of the documentary is entirely Italian.\n\nThe story centers on the townspeople of Monticchiello, and the man, Andrea Cresti, who through an organic process has led and directed them and their annual play for fifty years. Their defining moment as a people came toward the end of World War II, when the entire village was within a hair’s breadth of being summarily executed, and this story is one of the earliest they tell as a play, and the one which has compelled them to continue to tell the real stories of their lives. The villagers meet and engage in lively, in-depth debates during the fall and winter of the year, as they focus intently on the critical task of choosing and revealing what is closest to them. What’s most important to them is that the subject will honestly reflect what is impacting their lives at that moment in time. They have already been through several years of recession, though the rich seem to get richer, buying up farmhouses and homes in the town and surrounding areas for vacation homes, and further destabilizing the incomes of the residents. So the villagers play out the resulting emotions through their roles in the year’s production of the Teatro Povero. It’s a deeply interesting, human story, and will be especially so for aficionados of theater.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/l7oITFo7rHg\n\nBarolo Boys: The Story of a Revolution\n\nOn Kanopy and Hoopla\n\n(2014) A lighter tone here, as we hear the story of the Barolo Boys (one, Chiara Boschis, was actually a “girl”) as they upended centuries of tradition during the 1980s in an effort to strengthen and modernize the making of the great wine, Barolo, in the Langhe region of the Piedmonte in Northern Italy. Introduced by chef Joe Bastianich, (hearty son of the fabulous chef Lidia Bastianich of television’s “Lidia’s Kitchen”) the film builds on interviews with the now aging winemakers (primarily in Italian with English subtitles) as they describe the radical techniques they used, which included selecting, cutting, and leaving almost half of the grape harvest on the ground in order to intensify the flavors of the remaining grapes. This waste was deplored by the traditional winemakers of the region, but it certainly made a name for the Barolo Boys, who caused a huge boom in the popularity and name recognition of Barolo. They even toured America promoting their versions of Barolo, and even for a while had their own soccer team!\n\nEven so, there is still controversy regarding whether what they did was better or worse for Barolo. Nevertheless, they were extremely influential. The vineyards, fields, and towns in the Langhe provide a great background to this story, and final scenes on the dizzying slopes of coastal vineyards in the Cinque Terre region are quite beautiful. Laughing, singing Italians, great wine, friendly conflict, camaraderie, marching bands straggling through vineyards…there’s a lot of fun and a lot to like about this documentary.\n\nhttp://www.baroloboysthemovie.com/index_eng.html\n\nFisherman’s Conversations (2014) Hoopla\n\nThis beautiful 2014 film was made by young Italian filmmaker Chiara Bove Makiedo, in memory of her Croatian grandfather, a fisherman (by choice) of Hvar, the island where she summered for a good part of her life. Her grandfather had a career as a judge, and even as an ambassador to the UN, but chose fishing as his final career.\n\nHvar is a Croatian Island in the Adriatic Sea, sharing a maritime border not far from Italy, and the Italian language is one of those spoken in Croatia. The filmmaker captures the startling contrasts between the lives of fishing families, and the “modern party tourism” which promotes the decadent “Carpe Diem” parties and threatens to overwhelm the island’s traditional lifestyle. As clubbers stumble back to their rooms at 4:30 am, drunk and high through broken bottles and other signs of the night’s partying, the fishermen pass them in the streets heading for their boats and the morning’s fishing. Three generations of the Bibic family use only their hands and the simplest cast nets, fishing from a family boat built in 1902, a style known as “tramata.” Their summer catch remains on the island, supplying the many restaurants as well as year round residents of Hvar. They fish in the way men have been fishing for thousands of years off these islands, their nakedness as they dive to set their nets so innocent-seeming when contrasted with the decadence of the “Carpe Diem” parties.\n\nDuring the winter, the local “dragger” fishermen sell ninety percent of their catch to the Italians. But all of the fishermen, and family members, no matter what style of fishing they favor, hang out together in the winter. They celebrate life’s events and struggle to conserve their way of life as best they can while tourism and nightlife are elbowing out their traditional values and ways of being. For some who watch Fishermen’s Conversations, the documentary will resonate with the feeling of Provincetown and other fishing communities we know of which are wrestling with the question of how to survive.\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/100425333?dnt=1&app_id=122963\n\nFuocoammare (“Fire at Sea”)\n\nAvailable with your CLAMS card\n\n(2017) This extraordinary award-winning documentary by veteran filmmaker Gianfranco Rosi concerns the European refugee crisis and the residents of the island of Lampedusa, temporary landfall for the migrants from Africa and the Middle East on a treacherous and often fatal voyage. Though Lampedusa was at one time mainly a quiet island of Sicilian fishing families, its location, closer to the African coast than to Sicily, makes it a destination for the smugglers who carry desperate men, women, and children, under the most horrifying conditions, to a safer shore.\n\nRosi turns his lens on a handful of residents of Lampedusa, and their ordinary day to day lives, which nevertheless at times intersect with the plight of the refugees. A seemingly carefree twelve-year-old boy, Samuele Pucillo, who roams the desolate island with a friend and a slingshot hoping to bag small birds, suffers from a new-found anxiety, and learns compassion. He is treated by his family doctor Pietro Bartoli, the only doctor on the island, who also must examine each and every refugee who makes landfall and even the bodies of those who die en route or are washed ashore from sunken vessels or life rafts. It is a daunting and horrifying task, and this compassionate man, though seemingly calm, is haunted by what he has seen. He deeply believes, “It is the duty of every human being to help these people.”\n\nThe film takes the viewer through the process the migrants endure from the moment when the boats make contact with the Coast Guard station on Lampedusa. This includes an unsuccessful search and rescue as well as a successful one. Even the successful ones, though, come at a great cost to the refugees. Although this is not an easy film to watch for many of us, I have added it to this blog post because I believe everyone should see it. And in spite of this great human tragedy, the courage and determination of the refugees as well as the compassion of Dr. Pietro Bartoli and others on Lampedusa make this movie ultimately life-affirming in a huge way. The prime minister of Italy considered this documentary, winner of multiple awards, of such importance that he distributed copies to the twenty-seven heads of state of the European Union.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JaYhHFiOaag\n\nIn Zeffirelli’s film, the notorious courtesan Violetta Valéry is played by incandescent soprano Teresa Stratas, a true star whose astounding operatic talents are matched by her physical beauty and her superb skills as an actor. As the tragic Violetta, she is absolute perfection; tiny and delicate, it’s not impossible to believe she is terminally ill with tuberculosis, or as it was romantically and accurately called at the time, consumption. She claims to live only for a life of pleasure. Her extravagant lifestyle and parties, funded by a string of wealthy lovers, supports that claim. But, of course, there is much more to her. Poet Alfredo Germont, who has adored her from a distance for the past year, appears at her party and sings a toast (“brindisi”) to her. His devotion touches her heart and she falls deeply in love with him. Alfredo is played by the brilliant tenor Plácido Domingo, “recognized as one of the finest and most influential singing actors in the history of opera.” From the first scene of the film, you understand that their relationship will end tragically, so there are no spoilers here. Unlike the usual flow from the beginning of Act One until the curtain falls, Zeffirelli has structured the film as a flashback to happier times, as Violetta now faces her lonely death. I think it is a very effective device in this context.\n\nIn Act Two, Violetta decides to abandon the gaiety and debauchery of Paris to live a simpler life at her country estate, with Alfredo. Their three-month idyll ends abruptly when Alfredo’s father appears and convinces the sensitive and compassionate Violetta that she must give up her great love in order to protect Alfredo’s sister, whose engagement will be terminated if the shame of Violetta and Alfredo’s liaison becomes publicly known. Her renunciation scene is exquisitely heartrending, and every time I have watched her suffering, it’s had the same effect on me. The times we are living through in 2020 are surely enough to make a stone weep. So if you feel great, fat tears rolling down your cheeks at the end of Act Two, Scene One, be grateful for some moments of catharsis. God knows, we all need it.\n\nAlthough there is no official trailer to be found online, here are a couple of videos which I hope will give you a feel for the production. They are odd ones, I must say, but not the oddest ones from this film which are available on the internet! Well, you’ll see what I mean. When watching the full film, make sure to turn on the English subtitles which, though not as good as they could be, are still helpful. Zeffirelli’s La Traviata is available on DVD through CLAMS or any other library system to which you belong.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NUV41qb94vI\n\nhttps://youtu.be/R6Jilp_EFCI"
