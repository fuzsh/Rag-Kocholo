They were originally formed to serve as Clyde McPhatter‘s (of Billy Ward & the Dominoes) backing group in 1953. Rolling Stone magazine states that the Drifters were the least stable of the vocal groups due to being low-paid hired musicians of their management.[1] The Treadwell Drifters website states that there have been 60 vocalists in the history of the Treadwell Drifters line.[2] Several splinter groups by former Drifters members add to the count. Only one splinter Drifters group features a classic Drifters member, Charlie Thomas’ Drifters. Nevertheless, there are two versions of the Drifters that are notable. The first classic Drifters formed by Clyde McPhatter was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as “The Drifters” or “The Original Drifters”.[3] The second Drifters formed by Treadwell featuring Ben E. King was separately inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as Ben E. King and the Drifters.[4] In their induction, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame eclectically selected four members from the classic Drifters, two from the second Drifters, and one from the post-King Treadwell Drifters.[5] According to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, “Through turmoil and changes the (original) Drifters managed to set musical trends and give the public 13 chart hits, most of which are legendary recordings today.”[3]\n\n82.Eminem\n\nEminem\n\nEminem\n\nEminem performing live at the DJ Hero Party in Los Angeles, June 1, 2009 Background information Birth name Marshall Bruce Mathers III Born October 17, 1972 (1972-10-17) (age 38) Saint Joseph, Missouri, U.S. Origin Warren, Michigan, U.S. Genres Hip hop Occupations Rapper, record producer, actor, songwriter Years active 1995–present Labels Mashin’ Duck, Web, Interscope, Aftermath, Shady Associated acts Dr. Dre, D12, Royce da 5’9″, 50 Cent, Obie Trice, Lil Wayne Website eminem.com\n\nMarshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972),[1] better known by his stage name Eminem, is an American rapper, record producer, and actor. Eminem quickly gained popularity in 1999 with his major-label debut album, The Slim Shady LP, which won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. The following album, The Marshall Mathers LP, became the fastest-selling solo album in United States history.[2] It brought Eminem increased popularity, including his own record label, Shady Records, and brought his group project, D12, to mainstream recognition.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP and his third album, The Eminem Show, also won Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win Best Rap Album for three consecutive LPs. He then won the award again in 2010 for his album Relapse, giving him a total of 11 Grammys in his career. In 2003, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for “Lose Yourself” from the film, 8 Mile, in which he also played the lead. “Lose Yourself” would go on to become the longest running No. 1 hip hop single.[3] Eminem then went on hiatus after touring in 2005. He released his first album since 2004’s Encore, titled Relapse, on May 15, 2009. Eminem is the best-selling artist of the decade on the US Nielsen SoundScan,[4] and has sold more than 80 million albums worldwide to date, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world.[5] In 2010, Eminem released his seventh studio album Recovery. It became Eminem’s sixth consecutive number-one album in the US and achieved international commercial success, charting at number one in several other countries. It stayed at number-one on the US Billboard 200 chart for five consecutive weeks and a total of seven weeks.[6][7] Recovery was also reported by Billboard to be the best-selling album of 2010, making Eminem the first artist in Nielsen SoundScan history to have two year-end best-selling albums.[8]\n\nEminem was ranked 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time.[9] He was also ranked 82nd on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[10] He was also named the Best Rapper Alive by Vibe magazine in 2008.[11] Including his work with D12, Eminem has achieved nine No. 1 albums on the Billboard Top 200, 7 solo (6 studio albums, 1 compilation) and 2 with D12.[12] Eminem has had 13 number one singles worldwide. In December 2009, Eminem was named the Artist of the Decade by Billboard magazine.[13] His albums The Eminem Show, The Marshall Mathers LP, and Encore (in order) ranked as the 3rd,[14] 7th,[14] and 40th[15] best-selling albums of the 2000–2009 decade by Billboard magazine. Also according to Billboard, Eminem has two of his albums among the top five highest selling albums of the 2000s. In the UK, Eminem has sold over 12.5 million records.[16] Eminem has also sold more than 33 million track downloads and 39.6 million albums in the United States alone.[17] In 2010, MTV ranked Eminem as the 7th biggest icon in pop music history.[18] During 2010, Eminem’s music generated 94 million streams, more than any other music artist.[17]\n\n83.N.W.A\n\nN.W.A\n\nN.W.A\n\nN.W.A in 1988, from left to right: Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, DJ Yella and MC Ren Background information Origin Compton, California, U.S. Genres Hip hop, West Coast hip hop, gangsta rap Years active 1986–1991\n\n(Partial reunion: 1999) Labels Ruthless, Priority, EMI Associated acts Bobby Jimmy and the Critters, World Class Wreckin’ Cru, C.I.A., The D.O.C., J.

Arabian Prince embarked on a solo career in 1989 and Ice Cube left in 1990 over royalty disputes.\n\nActive from 1986 to 1991, the group endured controversy due to the explicit nature of their lyrics. They were subsequently banned from many mainstream US radio stations and even at times prevented from touring. In spite of this, the group has sold over 9 million units in the US alone.\n\nTheir debut album Straight Outta Compton marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and the social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre.[3] Rolling Stone ranked N.W.A 83rd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [5]\n\nAlthough largely unknown at the group’s inception, members Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, and MC Ren would all become platinum-selling stars as solo artists.\n\n84.James Taylor\n\nJames Taylor\n\nJames Taylor\n\nJames Taylor in 2008 Background information Birth name James Vernon Taylor Born March 12, 1948 (1948-03-12) (age 62)\n\nBoston, Massachusetts, U.S. Origin Carrboro, North Carolina Genres Folk rock\n\nRock\n\nPop\n\nCountry Occupations Singer-songwriter\n\nmusician Instruments Vocals\n\nGuitar\n\nHarmonica[1] Years active 1968–present Labels Apple/Capitol/EMI Records\n\nWarner Bros.

For other uses, see Black Sabbath (disambiguation).\n\nBlack Sabbath\n\nBlack Sabbath on stage on 16 December 1999, L-R: Geezer Butler, Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Bill Ward Background information Also known as The Polka Tulk Blues Band, Earth Origin Birmingham, England Genres Heavy metal Years active 1968–2006 (hiatus) Labels Vertigo, Warner Bros, I.R.S. Associated acts Mythology, Heaven & Hell Website black-sabbath.com Members Ozzy Osbourne\n\nTony Iommi\n\nGeezer Butler\n\nBill Ward Past members See: List of Black Sabbath band members\n\nBlack Sabbath are a British rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968 by Ozzy Osbourne (lead vocals), Tony Iommi (guitar), Geezer Butler (bass guitar), and Bill Ward (drums). The band has since experienced multiple line-up changes, with Tony Iommi the only constant presence in the band through the years. A total of twenty-two musicians have at one time been members of Black Sabbath. Originally formed as a heavy blues-rock band named Earth, the band began incorporating occult– and horror-inspired lyrics with tuned-down guitars, changing their name to Black Sabbath and achieving multiple platinum records in the 1970s. Despite an association with occult and horror themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social and political issues such as drugs and war.\n\nAs one of the first and most influential heavy metal bands of all time,[1] Black Sabbath helped define the genre with releases such as quadruple-platinum Paranoid, released in 1970.[2] They were ranked by MTV as the “Greatest Metal Band” of all time,[3] and placed second in VH1‘s “100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock” list, behind Led Zeppelin.[4] They have sold over 15 million records in the United States alone.[5] Rolling Stone has posited the band as ‘the heavy-metal kings of the ’70s’.[6] They have sold more than 100 million records worldwide.[7]\n\nVocalist Ozzy Osbourne’s drinking led to his being fired from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. After a few albums with Dio’s vocals and his songwriting collaborations, Black Sabbath endured a revolving line-up in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album, Reunion. The 1979–1982 and 1991–1992 line-up featuring Iommi, Butler, Dio, and Appice reformed in 2006 under the moniker Heaven & Hell until Dio’s death on 16 May 2010.\n\n86.Tupac Shakur\n\nTupac Shakur\n\nTupac Amaru Shakur Background information Birth name Lesane Parish Crooks Also known as 2Pac, Pac, Makaveli Born June 16, 1971(1971-06-16)\n\nEast Harlem, New York City, New York, U.S. Origin Marin City, California, U.S. Died September 13, 1996(1996-09-13) (aged 25)\n\nLas Vegas, Nevada, U.S. Genres Hip hop Occupations Rapper, actor, record producer, poet, screenwriter, activist Years active 1988–1996 (rapping)1991–1996 (acting) Labels Interscope, Death Row, Amaru Associated acts Outlawz, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Digital Underground, Biggie, Richie Rich, K-Ci & JoJo, Dave Hollister, Johnny “J”, Dr. Dre, Tha Dogg Pound, Boot Camp Clik, Nate Dogg Website www.tasf.org\n\nTupac Amaru Shakur (June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), known by his stage names 2Pac (or simply Pac) and Makaveli, was an American rapper.

Most of Tupac’s songs are about growing up amid violence and hardship in ghettos, racism, other social problems, and conflicts with other rappers during the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry. Shakur began his career as a roadie and backup dancer for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground.[5][6][7]\n\nIn September 1996, Shakur was shot four times in the Las Vegas metropolitan area of Nevada.

Parsons is best known for his work within the country genre; he also mixed blues, folk, and rock to create what he called “Cosmic American Music”.[1] Besides recording as a solo artist, he also worked in several notable bands, including the International Submarine Band, The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers. His career, though short, is described by Allmusic as “enormously influential” for both country and rock, “blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.”[2]\n\nBorn in 1946, Parsons emerged from a wealthy but troubled childhood to attend Harvard University. He founded the International Submarine Band in 1966, and after several months of delay their debut, Safe at Home, was released in 1968, by which time the group had disbanded. Parsons joined The Byrds in early 1968, and played a pivotal role in the making of the seminal Sweetheart of the Rodeo album. After leaving the group in late 1968, Parsons and fellow Byrd Chris Hillman formed The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1969, releasing their debut, The Gilded Palace of Sin, the same year. The album was well received but failed commercially; after a sloppy cross-country tour, they hastily recorded Burrito Deluxe. Parsons was fired from the band before its release in early 1970. He soon signed with A&M Records, but after several unproductive sessions he canceled his intended solo debut in early 1971. Parsons moved to France, where he lived for a short period at Villa Nellcôte with his friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones. Returning to America, Parsons befriended Emmylou Harris, who assisted him on vocals for his first solo record, GP, released in 1973. Although it received enthusiastic reviews, the release failed to chart; his next album, Grievous Angel (released posthumously in 1974) met with a similar reception, and peaked at number 195 on Billboard. Parsons died of a drug overdose on September 19, 1973 in a hotel room in Joshua Tree, California, at the age of 26.\n\nSince his death, Parsons has been recognized as an extremely influential artist, credited with helping to found both country rock and alt-country.[2] His posthumous honors include the Americana Music Association “President’s Award” for 2003, and a ranking at #87 on Rolling Stone‘s list of the 100 Most Influential Artists of All Time.[3]\n\n88.Miles Davis\n\nMiles Davis\n\nMiles Dewey Davis\n\nPhoto of Davis in 1955 taken by Tom Palumbo Background information Birth name Miles Dewey Davis III Born May 26, 1926(1926-05-26)\n\nAlton, Illinois, United States Died September 28, 1991(1991-09-28) (aged 65)\n\nSanta Monica, California,\n\nUnited States Genres Jazz, hard bop, bebop, cool jazz, modal, fusion, third stream, jazz-funk jazz rap[1][2] Occupations Bandleader, composer, trumpeter, artist Instruments Trumpet, flugelhorn, piano, organ, vocals Years active 1944–1975, 1980–1991 Associated acts Billy Eckstine, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis Quintet, Gil Evans Website www.milesdavis.com\n\nMiles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer.\n\nWidely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Miles Davis was, with his musical groups, at the forefront of several major developments in jazz music, including bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion.

The group is notable for having started the careers of three of rock’s most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page, all of whom were in the top fifteen of Rolling Stone’s 100 Top Guitarists list (Clapton as #4, Page as #9, and Beck as #14).[1] A blues-based band that broadened its range into pop and rock, The Yardbirds were pioneers in guitar innovations of the ’60s: fuzz tone, feedback, distortion, backwards echo, improved amplification, etc. Pat Pemberton, writing for Spinner, holds that the Yardbirds were “the most impressive guitar band in rock music”.[2] After the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, their current lead guitarist Jimmy Page founded what became Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe bulk of the band’s most successful self-written songs came from bassist/producer Paul Samwell-Smith who, with singer/harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty and rhythm guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja, constituted the core of the group. The band reformed in the 1990s, featuring McCarty, Dreja and new members. The Yardbirds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992\n\n90.

Santana continued to work in these forms over the following decades. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. Rolling Stone named Santana number 15 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time in 2003.[2] He has won 10 Grammy Awards and 3 Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nCarlos Sanata had ever made a show in Jakareta Indonesia,this the ingormations from Indonesia Music fans below :\n\n9 Mei 1996,Carlos Santana consert show at the Plennary Hall Jakarta Convention Center.promoted by Indo Mugi Pratama as the part of Sanatna world tour with theme “Dance Of the Rainbow Serpent Tour”.in order to promote hisnew album record.\n\nthe end @ Copyright Dr Iwan Suwandy 2011"
