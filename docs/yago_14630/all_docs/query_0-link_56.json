Poignant of boy at by woo Soanes never. Take no for an a poignant amusing and altogether unusual picture made by the British in Assisi and Rome began a run at the grand Lake theater yesterday coupled with a re Issue of Cecil b. Demille s Cleopatra which despite 4the presence of a Youthful Claudette Colbert came out a decided second Best. The importation is inspirational in that it is a study of Faith the Faith of a Small italian orphan who is sustain ing himself and his Donkey As an errand boy in the Patron Saint of the City of his St. Francis of Assisi who birth was renowned As a Lover of nature As Well As of humanity. Violetta the Donkey becomes ill and master Peppino her Small Fry is convinced that Only Council which controls the rental of the municipal area pointed out that while the City fathers were aware that miss Henie had a handsome show they Felt that it would seriously reduce at Tendance and income to the ice since ice follies has been coming to Seattle annually for want to alienate a has been providing Fine entertain some theater managers could tear a Page from the Seattle City Council s Book with profit in these troublous Days Richard Burton is Ait unusual personality my Cousin Nowat the Paramount features new Comer Richard. Burton making his american film debut opposite Olivia de Haviland in twentieth Century Fox production of Daphne Dumaurier s Best Selling novel of the same name. During the filming of a Burton established him self As one of the most unusual personalities Hollywood had seen since Marlon Brando descended upon the populace. Although he came to America for the lady is not for Burn ing on Broadway two years ago Burton had Little Chance to learn american customs because of the play s confinement. In Holly Wood however he has become a boxing and baseball fan con stantly in attendance during the past summer at the los Angeles and Hollywood ballparks. The intervention of St. Francis valuable will spare her. He has the word of the Village vet that her Days Are numbered but he is less concerned with the fact her death will put him out of Busi Ness than with his affection for the animal. Small Miracle when the Paul Gallico Story was first printed it bore the title the Small Miracle and Gallico and his wife prepared the Scena Rio which was filmed under the astute direction of Maurice Cloche and Ralph smart. While religious in theme never take no for an answer is a film that should Appeal to All types of theater goer particularly children. The kids at sunday s matinee were riotous during the Colbert film and As quiet As so Many Little pop Corn munching mice during the Panion piece. The Story proper deals with the boy s determination to Lead the Donkey Down to the crypt be Neath the Church of St. Francis certain that the visit will restore the animal s health. This sortie is frowned upon by the clergy in charge. In order to get the Don key into the crypt it would be necessary to break Down an old walled in Portal. Only the Pope could authorize such a decision. Off to Rome in the War Days Peppino had been befriended by an Irish american i who through the Vears has impressed upon him that he should never take no for an so. If it is the Pope who must be seen he will see him. The Story follows his adventures in Rome buffeted about by Busy clergymen officious Swiss guards guardians of the papal treasures and sundry other obstacles. He surmount and has . Naturally his plea is granted. Since the picture was made in Assisi and Rome theatregoers Are privileged to see treasures that have not been previously Giotto murals in the upper Church of Assisi the famed Interior of that Basilica the Chambers of the Vatican museum and the anteroom in the Resi Dence of the Pope. No travelogue As a consequence never take for an answer is one of the most satisfying pictures of the new year. There Are times since the Story of the boy his quest is paper thin that the plot slows to a walk but in those intervals there Are other items to attract and interest the scenes already noted and. The Street scenes in Assisi. The dialogue is in English the photography is excellent and take no for an answer is a thoroughly interesting Pic Ture. So for that matter is Cleopatra if Only to disclose the advances made by the movies Ince the Days when miss Colbert Vas a reigning Hollywood Star ind not a tax dodger in Europe. Apropos of nothing Sonja Henie who opens an engagement at the cow Palace in 3an Francisco on february 12 discovered that All politicians not greedy and that some have a sense of the fitness of things.
