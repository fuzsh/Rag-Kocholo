The most obvious person is Fredric Nachbaur, the director of Fordham University Press, who has shepherded this volume through to completion with such grace and insight. And always John Paul Russo for his intellectual breadth and depth and for his sage advice, and Dona DeSanctis for her knowledge and commitment to things Italian-American. At this point in my life, I find myself looking back to some very early influences in my development: my eighth-grade teacher at St. Joseph Academy, Sister Mary Ellen, whose depth of learning was as remarkable as her encouragement of me, a very shy, reticent child. The Sisters Mary David, Chrysostom, Mary Francis, and Paula Holdman and Professors Mary Brady and Janine Marzi at the College of Mt. St. Vincent modeled an intellectual life for women to follow. Their unabashed rooting for our success encouraged imitation. My grandmother, mother, and godmother were three strong and loving women who always had my best interests at heart. How could they not have shaped me in ways that I am still discovering? Finally, my husband, Birge, who has always supported me in my intellectual interests. His own wide reading has stimulated mine. carol bonomo albright In the summer of 2008, when Carol and I first spoke about collaborating on this project, time shifted a bit and an eerie but affectionate presence stood between us: Sister Matthew. She introduced both history and geography into our curriculum. After the books made their way down the aisles, I flipped through each one. ‘‘Where are the stories about girls?’’ I asked. Sister Matthew fluffed the side of her habit, laughed, and said, ‘‘You’ll have to write them.’’ The scholars and writers whose articles, essays, and histories are included in American Woman, Italian Style contributed their time, intellectual passion, xi\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$ACK\n\n11-17-10 14:42:34\n\nPS\n\nPAGE xi\n\nxii Acknowledgments\n\nand interest to make this volume possible.

We again approached Fordham University Press, with which we had developed a strong working relationship. Our first anthology focused on fiction, poetry, and memoir. A second volume, this time about Italian-American women, shouted out for attention. As we perused past articles published in the journal,1 what struck us was that, from out of the more often than not difficult beginnings of poverty, Italian-American women demonstrated a strength, inventiveness, persistence, and ingenuity that was formidable. Hands down they had trailblazed a stunning path for current and future generations of immigrant women. We believed that the research, articles, and essays deserved a showcase. From Italian Americana’s very inception in 1974, articles about ItalianAmerican women as well as poems and memoirs penned by women, and book reviews about such major authors as Helen Barolini and Daniela Gioseffi, graced the journal’s pages. Through the 1970s and ’80s we published short stories written by women. By the 1990s, the number of women’s stories in our pages exploded. Furthermore, in the public sphere critics discussed and wrote about Italian-American women’s writings; their literature was taken seriously. So was their history. We asked ourselves: Why not publish the best articles about women in a second Best of ‘‘Italian Americana’’ volume? Our enthusiasm supported our hunch that such a book would be welcomed not only by scholars interested in Italian Americans but also by those interested in cross-cultural studies, history, immigration studies, sociology, and gender studies as well as the everyday person and more recent immigrants. In reviewing the thirty-five-year history of Italian Americana, we chose a broad range of articles with an eye to many disciplines. At times we asked 1\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:07\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 1\n\n2 Carol Bonomo Albright and Christine Palamidessi Moore\n\nauthors to update their articles or to submit only the section of an article which dealt with Italian-American women. Then we divided the topics into four sections: Italian-American women’s education, work, and home life; literature; art, music, and film; and studies about Italian-American women. The anthology formed an appropriate reflection of an ethnic woman’s progression into American culture—in this case, the Italian-American woman’s. With that in mind, we started our book by looking at the interior life, if you will, of elderly adult children of immigrants. For six months in 1990, working as a participant-observer, psychologist Elizabeth Messina interviewed nine Italian-American women, ranging in age from seventy-two to ninety. She asked questions about, and then analyzed the women’s relationship with, their family members, their work, courtship, and sexual and marital experiences. The article is striking for the interviewees’ honesty and their occasional acceptance of their harsh lives as well as the bitterness of their hostility. The subjects’ repressed anger sometimes led to revenge exercised in sexual withdrawal and psychological torture. Given the small sampling, it is difficult to know how widespread such reactions might be within the larger population. More research will be needed to determine whether Messina’s data was particular to her interviewees and/or if other immigrant cultures might reveal similar responses. Migration necessitates a psychological dislocation as well as a physical uprooting. Though not often discussed, emotional ramifications for the children and grandchildren of immigrants are significant. Temple University professor Mary Ann Mannino argues that second- and third-generation Americans seek therapeutic treatment for depression and anxieties that relate to ancestral immigration. She uses two Italian-American literary texts—Blue Italian and Umbertina—along with her own psychological studies to explore the immigration trauma in assimilated granddaughters. The article raises questions about loss and the absorbed pain of immigration that mark mother–daughter relationships. Such loss makes expressions of love difficult and, therefore, threatens the strong self-esteem necessary for establishing independence. This article can act as a springboard to contrast its finding with other ethnicities of the same period and as a comparison to America’s evernew wave of immigrants; on a personal level, it can act as a vehicle for compassion for both one’s ancestors and the current generation grappling with such issues. Nathalie Cooke’s article about Mary di Michele’s poetry echoes similar generational losses and the psychological impact of migration— though in her later poetry di Michele moves beyond personal reflections to\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:07\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 2\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nconcern herself with larger issues of social justice. Both Rose De Angelis’s article and Blossom Kirschenbaum’s essay on Mary Caponegro’s writings focus on the consequences of immigrant trauma. Lorett Treese’s article on mothers’ clubs in New York City in the 1930s and ’40s gives us a different perspective on the lives of women as they make the transition from Italian mothers to Italian-American women. Some of the women had both the leisure time and interest in joining together to expand their social and intellectual lives. After first outlining a woman’s role in the family structure of southern Italy, Treese chronicles a New York City mothers’ club’s activities. Although Treese refers to the Mezzogiorno culture, she notes that Rosa Cavalleri, who had been denied all but the most rudimentary education in northern Italy, demonstrated the same values as women from the south: their common culture was stronger than regional differences might suggest. The club’s outings created possibilities and opened doors, whether symbolic or real, that affected how the women could create new lifestyles for themselves and their families. The women visited, for example, the New York Times, Fordham University’s library, and Rockefeller Center. The clubs served other functions as well: the social activities addressed isolation and rising intergenerational conflicts. The women expressed themselves by writing and producing plays; the presentation of folk songs and dances allowed the mothers to celebrate their roots with their children; and the clubs provided women with leadership qualities to exercise their talents. By the 1950s, the membership in one New York City club decreased greatly and by the 1960s it shut its doors. But perhaps this brief reign was a mark of its success: The women no longer needed such a movement to engage in a larger world. Educational opportunities in America allowed women to claim rich personal lives and, in some cases, careers outside the home. An article by University of Genoa professor Maria Parrino examines the educational struggle as seen in the memoirs of four women: Rosa Cavalleri, Bruna Pieracci, Grace Spinelli, and Clara Grillo—all of whom belonged to the Great Migration of people entering the United States from 1876 to 1924. What makes the study noteworthy is that the geographic scope expands beyond the usual urban areas. Grillo challenged her father’s old-country values about a woman’s place by leaving his house and working her way through high school. This action is contrary to the widely held stereotype of Italian-American women’s silence. Cavalleri worked as a washerwoman and attended an\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:08\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 3\n\n4 Carol Bonomo Albright and Christine Palamidessi Moore\n\nafter-work-hours Catholic school where she learned to read and write English. Many of the actions immigrant Rosa took, not only in the realm of education—such as her decision to leave her first, abusive husband—again belies the notion of passive Italian women. Many who have had an immigrant Italian grandmother can testify to the inaccuracy of this stereotype. And in describing Italian-American women’s actions during unionization, Maxine Seller refers to Edwin Fenton’s Immigrants and Unions study in which he states that by 1919 some of the Italian women in the garment union ‘‘proved to be exceedingly energetic and bellicose, as the police roles showed.’’ According to Fenton, union leaders recognized the relationship between subservience in the family and on the job and worked to radicalize women at work and equalize their positions at home. Spinelli, a Sicilian immigrant, became a New York City social worker; her education was guided by a generous teacher who promoted cultural pluralism and provided her with a sense of public recognition. For Pieracci, her Iowan family highly valued learning. These resilient women’s dreams were realized in America because they pursued education in a system that embraced individual freedom, despite the same system’s attempted homogenization of their ethnic culture. The article questions the commonly held assumption that Italian Americans were uninterested in education. Exploring the roles that economics and outsider feelings played in limiting access to educational opportunities might prove fruitful areas for research. The custom of a family’s contributing their pay to put the most promising male through professional school is another important subject for research: Did they do the same for the females? A number of articles in American Woman, Italian Style, such as Parrino’s, and those by Messina, Vecchio, Gambino, and Reich, suggest the richness of still unstudied gender exchanges and encounters with institutions, employers, and fellow workers. Continuing with the theme of education is Christina Bevilacqua’s interview with Sandra (Mortola) Gilbert. A distinguished feminist critic, Professor Gilbert makes the point that her mother was a ‘‘little bitter’’ about having attended normal school, and not college. The need for a family’s adult child’s paycheck was often an overriding consideration, especially if the adult child was female. Family resources for higher education often favored the male child. Other topics in this interview encompass Gilbert’s scholarly works (the landmark The Madwoman in the Attic, among others),\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:08\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 4\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nher poetry and memoir (in which she speaks about secrets and silence), and her critical works on women’s issues and issues of identity. Another article focusing on issues of identity is Professor Paul Levitt’s perspective on the character Lucy Mancini in The Godfather. He states that Lucy Mancini transcends the mores of the old country and embraces the modern world. An additional point he makes is that the English meaning of mancini, left-handed, is a metaphor for the outsider. The feeling of being an outsider, from being estranged from two worlds, is a thread that runs through ethnic literatures. Mari Tomasi’s novel Like Lesser Gods was published in 1949, preceding Mario Puzo’s The Godfather by twenty years. The novel posits a gradual approach toward assimilation over generations as a way of easing the conflict about being an outsider. We asked author Alfred Rosa to present the section of his article regarding Tomasi’s insights about the Vermont Italian-American stonecutters as well as Rose Basile Green’s assessment of Tomasi’s work. Carole Brown Knuth’s article, ‘‘Transformation in the Verbal Art of Clementina Todesco,’’ discusses the preservation of oral folktales. In 1941, Todesco’s daughter, Bruna, wrote down her mother’s stories. Nearly thirtyfive years later these folk stories were rediscovered at the Wayne State University Archives. The material resulted in the first ethnographic study of a storyteller from Italy, Italian Folktales in America: The Verbal Art of an Immigrant Woman by Elizabeth Mathias and Richard Raspa. The work sheds light on what might have remained elusive: the oral tradition of Italian women. Jumping from folktales to crime fiction, Professor Blossom Kirschenbaum in ‘‘Simona Griffo, Detective Hero: A Series of ‘Troublems’ ’’ applauds the feminist detective genre (this article might well inspire study of present-day author Lisa Scottoline’s detective novels) that has reconceived a woman, in this case an immigrant woman, as hero at the center of the story. Simona Griffo, a character of novelist Camilla T. Crespi, is a transplanted Italian working for a small New York City advertising agency. On the side she investigates murders. Her Italian identity is built up by a zest for food, espresso, and a spouting off of random Italian expressions when she is excited. Professor Edvige Giunta’s article, ‘‘Writing Life, Writing History: Italian-American Women and the Memoir,’’ belies cliche´s about italianicity. The large number of memoirs written in the 1990s asserts the power of the Italian-American woman as an intellectual voice. The memoirs expose what many Italian-American families and communities would rather leave unsaid.\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:08\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 5\n\n6 Carol Bonomo Albright and Christine Palamidessi Moore\n\nThe writers possess a visceral attachment to family and culture and contradictorily express anger, violence, and sorrow toward the same. Giunta argues that the contradiction peels back a noteworthy realization that stresses the importance of a self-conscious understanding of the power of memory. In ‘‘Breaking the Silence: Interview with Tina De Rosa,’’ Los Angeles Times reporter Lisa A. Meyer in 1999 succeeded in getting the reclusive novelist of the classic Italian-American novel Paper Fish to talk about her work. An ethnic woman from working-class Chicago, De Rosa was in no way an easy subject to interview. She rebuffed feminist, Italian-American, metaphorical, and political pegging of her work. She insisted that what happened to the characters in her novel was literal and not symbolic. ‘‘My purpose in writing is to hold on to people and places before they disappear,’’ she explained. In an essay written toward the end of the 1990s, Richard Gambino, one of the founders of Italian Americana, responds to critics of the Italian-American family and offers insights into an authentic understanding of the relations between the sexes. He talks about the complementary roles of men and women. Using statistics, Gambino shows that Italian-American women who are under twenty-five and over forty-five have the highest percentage ranking in the workforce among all U.S. ancestry groups. During the childbearing years, the percentage of Italian-American women working is much lower. He argues that the statistics suggest cultural norms that differ from mainstream employment practices and child-rearing priorities. Whether Gambino’s view will hold in the twenty-first century remains to be seen, especially when we consider William Egelman’s findings in ‘‘Traditional Roles and Modern Work Patterns of Italian American Women in New York City’’ and in his demographic analysis of Italian Americans in 2000. Egelman, a professor of sociology at Iona College, reinforces the idea that when ethnic contacts remain high, traditional roles persist, but if ethnic contacts are weakened, traditional gender roles may change. Additionally, Egelman notes that data from the year 2000 shows that Italian Americans relocate as often as Americans. This may be due to their current high levels of education and professional employment, which goes along with increased mobility. Data from Diane Vecchio’s article implies that Italian-American women struggle to straddle both traditional and workforce roles: they ‘‘juggle.’’ In ‘‘Connecting Spheres: Women’s Work and Women’s Lives in Milwaukee’s Italian Third Ward,’’ she fleshes out the ‘‘juggling’’ role further in her study\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:08\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 6\n\nIntroduction 7\n\non the status of Italian-American women’s lives by focusing on one Milwaukee ward in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Based on research and interviews, Vecchio presents a lively roster of entrepreneurial women who founded businesses, which they often operated initially in their homes. Simultaneously the women took care of the children and family. The womenowned retail stores—groceries, bakeries, butcheries, and tailoring shops— were means for a family’s upward mobility and depended on the support of the immigrant community and the cooperation of daughters and granddaughters. While younger Italian women contributed to family income by working in factories, the mothers and grandmothers ran their own businesses and took care of the children. In his memoir, Immigrant’s Return, Angelo Pellegrini describes a similar practice in Italy, ‘‘where . . . grandmothers [were] spinning, weaving, and tending children for their daughters . . . ’’2 as the young mothers worked in the fields. To ensure success, the women’s ingenuity and persistence, undertaken within Italian cultural values, adapted to American circumstances. Again it remains to be seen whether such accommodations can be retained in the light of disappearing ethnic neighborhoods. Grandmothers may be unavailable due to either their working outside the home or living far from their married children. Plus the demands of new professions require more than a nine-to-five work day. New adaptations will make for a fruitful future study. Not all women followed traditional life and work patterns. Though few in number, some children of immigrants performed on an international stage. Born in 1897, Rosa Ponselle became an acclaimed opera singer, not only at the Metropolitan Opera House, but in foreign capitals, winning accolades from the likes of Luciano Pavarotti. Of her, Pavarotti said, ‘‘Vocally [there was] . . . no one like her . . . interpretively she helped set the style for modern dramatic singing.’’ Ponselle reached the heights of stardom in an unusual fashion: by starting her singing career in vaudeville. From a poor immigrant family of nine children, Concetta Scaravaglione became a noted sculptor despite her widowed mother and brothers wanting her to become a stenographer. Having seen Scaravaglione’s talent, a dedicated teacher convinced Scaravaglione’s family to send her to art school, where she began to feel a tension between the expectations of her family’s traditionally held gender roles and her desire to devote herself to her art. She went on to teach at Vassar, received the Prix de Rome award from the American Academy in Rome, and was elected to be one of thirty members comprising the New York Society of Women Artists. Scaravaglione’s grandniece Carol Scarvalone Kushner is working on a biography of her greataunt. We encourage this most fruitful endeavor.

Modotti, an immigrant from Udine, evolved from actress, to artist model, to celebrated photographer and social activist. Touched on in several articles is the question of what is an ItalianAmerican woman. We view ethnicity partly as a dynamic inner process that Bonomo Albright explored in ‘‘Definitions of Womanhood: Class, Acculturation, and Feminism,’’ which appeared in Helen Barolini’s The Dream Book (1985). The immigrant generation, having few encounters with the host country, retains trust and love for its original culture; the next generation, coming into contact with the new country through school and work, experiences conflict over the differing values of its home culture and the new country; the following generation tries to resolve these conflicts and develop an individual identity; and succeeding generations put to rest such conflicts, combining an individuation integrated with their heritage and their personal goals. None of these stages of ethnicity, of course, evolves in any kind of straight path. Variations exist, but such a construct gives form to what so many Italian-American women experience. It allows for Italian-American women not to be in lockstep as to where they are on the continuum. We offer here one definition—including both descent and consent—which readers might want to debate and modify. An Italian-American woman resides in the Americas and is one who has been raised with Italian cultural values and with an ancestor who was Italian, or, if she is the immigrant, she was an Italian national. An Italian-American woman chooses to continue some of those cultural values, whether consciously or not (often, as Messina’s article suggests, the seeds of such values take root without, at times, our consciously knowing it). While we use the above definition, which better suits our purposes, we recognize that historians and sociologists refer to all the descendants of Italian immigrants as ‘‘Italian Americans’’ and we respect this definition. In her article on the writings of avant-garde writer Mary Caponegro, Professor Blossom Kirschenbaum places Caponegro’s work into the dynamic school of ethnic writing, in which ethnicity undergoes alterations over the generations. In discussing Caponegro’s unique style, the author states that ‘‘yearnings of mind and body, rather than naturalistic characterization focus Mary Caponegro’s fictions.’’ The films of contemporary filmmaker Nancy Savoca opens a myriad of issues about the lives of Italian-American women that demand further study.\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:09\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 8\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nIn her appreciation of Savoca’s work, Professor Jacqueline Reich of Trinity College discusses Savoca’s artistic insights regarding the lack of communication between men and women, rituals of male and female bonding, and the often suffocating constraints imposed by socially prescribed rules of proper masculine and feminine conduct. The films discussed are True Love, Dogfight, and Household Saints. Sociological research and demographic studies confirm the themes of some articles included in American Woman, Italian Style. Egelman uses statistical information from official documents and analyzes the implications of the findings. For example, Egelman’s analysis of Italian-American women’s evolution from the private to the public sphere in ‘‘Traditional Roles and Modern Work Patterns of Italian-American Women in New York City’’ comments on that city in the first quarter of the twentieth century and finds that the societal changes of a modern metropolis freed women, to some extent, from traditional parental constraints. The urban work pattern pushed women into a middle-class milieu, where there was increased demand for typists, stenographers, salespersons, and other ‘‘women’s jobs.’’ Italian-American women made dramatic strides in employment from 1980 to 1990. A key variable related to their employment was education. In a mere decade, college graduate rates doubled to 15.2 percent, according to the statistics cited by Egelman. This gain translated into another doubling of Italian-American women’s participation in executive and managerial categories in the same decade. There is a lot to recommend about Italian-American women’s synthesis in the workforce and American Woman, Italian Style chronicles the changes. By the time of the 2000 Census, writes Egelman in his analysis of that federal document, the percentage of Italian-American women who were college graduates again nearly doubled in a ten-year period. The climb in education superseded that of the American population as a whole. This, in turn, increased Italian-American women’s high representation in professional status careers as auditors, lawyers, accountants, physicians, and surgeons. The percentage of Italian-American women active in these fields exceeded that of the general population, as did their income. Economic and class identity changes also affected marriage patterns and the rates of intermarriage with non-Italian men, particularly Jewish men, write William Egelman, William Gratzer, and Michael D’Angelo in their article, ‘‘Italian-Jewish Intermarriage: The Italian-American Spouse.’’ It remains to be seen if other distinct changes will occur in the next generation of Italian-American women, how women who are the product of ‘‘mixed’’\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:09\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 9\n\n10 Carol Bonomo Albright and Christine Palamidessi Moore\n\nethnic marriages will identify themselves and their children, and how the definition of the Italian-American family may change. No essay on Italian-American women’s lives would be complete without mention of food, central as it is to Italian-American culture. In 1998, professor Donna Gabaccia, author of We Are What We Eat: Ethnic Food and the Making of Americans and guest editor of a two-part series of Italian Americana, wrote, ‘‘Food and cooking are powerful expressions of our ties to the past and to our current identity.’’ Six essays on food from Gabaccia’s original series constitute a subsection of sorts in American Woman, Italian Style. This subsection includes an essay by University of Denver professor Carol Helstosky, who wrote Pizza: A Global History and Garlic and Oil: Food and Politics in Italy. Both Helstosky and Gabaccia focus on the complex connections among food, cookbooks, and Italian-American life and identity. Their articles explore how Italian immigrant kitchens differed from those of other Americans, other immigrants, and other Italians; and what Italian cookbooks published in America, as compared with community cookbooks, reveal about assimilation, the importance of regionalism when studying Italian Americans through food, culinary attitudes, and fast-food Italian style. Helstosky’s analysis of a 1930s Little Italy cookbook is followed by Gabaccia’s overview of a wider variety of immigrant kitchens with particular attention paid to ‘‘community’’ cookbooks. Compared to other immigrant groups’ well-documented recipe collections, which were often bilingual, very few examples of Italian-American cookbooks were found by scholars. In the Italian immigrant culture, Gabaccia posits that recipes were handed down orally and rarely penetrated outside their enclave. But Americans were interested in Italian food. In the 1920s, for example, non–ItalianAmerican households followed inauthentic recipes for spaghetti sauce that contained Worcestershire sauce and horseradish but no garlic. Next, authors of commercial, community, and self-published cookbooks reflect on their decision to write about immigrant kitchens. Catherine Tripalin Murray writes how she came to know her grandmother as she collected recipes and reviewed her family’s roots. Cassandra Vivian offers insights into the financial and creative choices that contribute to successful cookbook publication as well as to her family’s reluctance to alter culinary tradition. Rose De Angelis departs from this approach to food in favor of examining its metaphoric significance in fiction and memoir. In Helen Barolini’s ‘‘Greener Grass’’ and Umbertina, Louise DeSalvo’s memoir Vertigo, and Louisa Ermelino’s Sisters Mallone, food is seen to complicate aspects of self-identity. Notably, it can be linked with sex when a desire to be devoured exists;\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:09\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 10\n\nIntroduction 11\n\ncan suggest an inner emptiness; can mark the intersection between excess satiety and a hunger for new tastes; and can signal daughter–mother resentments. The final section in the collection may be of special interest to scholars— although we think all readers will discover a wealth of information. In addition to a retrospective of scholarly literature, the final section points to resources for future research. Donna Gabaccia’s article acts as a comprehensive overview, ranging from the 1970s to the early 1990s, of topics of interest to Italian Americans. A few of the issues examined by Gabaccia, director of the Immigration History and Research Center at the University of Minnesota, are female wage-earning, family responsibilities, mother–daughter ties, the centrality of kin networks, community and neighborhood, educational attainment, Americanization and settlement houses, social lives, and family interactions as presented in film, fiction, and popular culture. Many of the studies she cites are multiethnic in their considerations. Professor Gabaccia discusses a number of directions Italian-American women’s studies can move toward from these beginnings. Next, Maxine Seller reports on Arno Press’s 1975 thirty-nine volume series, ‘‘Italian American Experience.’’ In the section of her article that we present, Seller generally praises the Press’s array of materials but laments that the series does not devote one of the thirty-nine volumes exclusively to women. Despite this neglect, she states that ‘‘the careful reader can uncover a wealth of information on Italian women scattered throughout.’’ Seller, who reports on Protestant Evangelicalism, rejects old negative stereotypes by referring to a 1941 Omaha study of Italian Americans that presents a more varied and accurate picture of Italian-American women’s work lives, their role in unions, and their position in the home. Seller refers to community histories that shed light on women’s charitable, educational, and social activities outside the home. She notes that some of the most useful information about Italian-American women is presented in novels: Jo Pagano’s Golden Wedding (1943) and Garibaldi LaPolla’s Fire in the Flesh (1931). In the former, Marietta initiates many important decisions, such as to leave the coal mines; in the latter, Agnes is an independent, and frankly sexual, woman, who does not limit herself to a traditional lifestyle. Our final selection is by Betty Boyd Caroli, who points to resources available for further study. For example, the Annual Report of the American immigration commissioner breaks down northern and southern Italian women, after 1910, by age and marital status, literacy, financial condition and travel arrangements. On the other hand, Italian documents define\n\n................. 17952$\n\nINTR\n\n11-17-10 14:43:09\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 11\n\n12 Carol Bonomo Albright and Christine Palamidessi Moore\n\nwomen’s status in the society which they left, citing occupations of immigrant women. While we await future studies, one thing is certain: Italian-American women have demonstrated much persistence, resilience, and ingenuity in the multicultural milieu that is America. Over the course of approximately a century, beginning in the 1880s with the Mass Migration, Italian-American women moved from lives of poverty and want into the forefront of very public, very professional lives. They wrote of their experiences in fiction and recorded their lives in memoir. They sought deeper understandings of themselves by looking back to their ancestors’ lives. In a country offering new opportunities, they used their inventiveness and strength. As a group, they can be celebrated for their dedication to family, and ultimately to education and self-expression. In this volume, our hope is that Italian-American women will reflect on the meaning of their journey in the new world while newer immigrant women will reflect on the experiences of those who came before them. In so doing, they may understand the commonality of women’s lives while retaining their own unique culture. We look forward to the further development of women in ways not yet imagined. Notes 1.

The experience proved to be both rich and rewarding. The thematic content of the life stories of these women, who had lived all of their childhood and adulthood in Little Italy, New York, emerged and unfolded spontaneously during our meetings. Our discussions centered on what these women remembered, thought, and felt about their relationships with their families of origin as well as their remembered work, courtship, sexual, and marital experiences. The selection of topics arose from the group’s evolving relationship with me over time and the dynamics of that process. As I listened to the women at the Mott Street Senior Center, where the interviews took place, it appeared that none of them had been educated in their families of origin to put their feelings into words. Yet, in their interactions in the group, their fluency in the language of feelings and their skill in communicating those feelings to one another were striking. Their statements were powerful, particularly with regard to their mature acceptance of their harsh lives, as well as for how hostile they felt about the many deprivations they had suffered. Their stories are the source of a rich psychological narrative that gives insight into the intrapsychic and interpersonal dynamics of these women. This narrative describes their struggle to make lives for themselves within the parameters of their social class and the sexual, legal, and religious mores set for them by tradition. The participants were nine women then residing in Little Italy and ranging in age from seventy-two to ninety. All except two women were widowed. The participants had all been born into large families, ranging in size 15\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:30\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 15\n\n16 Elizabeth G. Messina\n\nfrom seven to sixteen children, who immigrated to New York. Most of the immigrants came from Naples and Sicily. Of the nine women, two completed high school; two, the third grade; and five, the eighth grade. All of the women worked outside the home intermittently while they were married and raising families. Their children moved out of Little Italy and reside in the suburbs and other boroughs of New York. The narrative histories of these women and the themes that emerged from the data of my observations and interviews will be used to discuss some of the significant features of their psychological lives. These themes were developed by identifying recurring topics and patterns in the data. Theme 1: Work was the center of our experiences. Our parents worked hard, and we learned to work hard in order to survive. Theme 2: Our parents’ marriages worked because there were no other options open to them. Theme 3: When we were growing up, emotional sexual intimacy in our parents’ marital relationship was hidden from view and surrounded by secrecy. Theme 4: We had our own ways of handling our problems with our husbands but we paid dearly for those solutions psychologically. Theme 5: Looking back, we are not too happy with our lives, but we did the best we could with what we had.\n\nI shall present each theme with some quotes from the women with my own comments and analysis that may also reference other relevant psychological studies.\n\nTheme 1 Work was the center of our experiences. Our parents worked hard and we learned to work hard in order to survive. Heroic sacrifice and hard work by parents to ensure their children’s survival was an outstanding characteristic of each woman’s descriptions of her childhood. An ethic of heroic suffering and personal sacrifice dominated the expectations of how one fulfilled family obligations, which, as we will see shortly, began at a very early age. Parental example taught the values of hard work, self-deprivation, and the assumption of multiple social responsibilities. In the words of Anna, a seventy-eight-year-old woman: Parents were so good to the child. They got up at five in the freezing cold to go to work. . . .\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:30\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 16\n\nNarratives of Nine Italian-American Women 17 My father was happy just to have children [seven boys and two girls]. He used to say, ‘‘I’m rich in blood.’’ He was so proud of his children and he worked hard to take care of us. He worked for the city. . . . He was up at five every morning. He used to sweat in the summer and freeze in the winter. . . . He loved his family. My father just gloated when he saw the family together. He worked hard to take care of the family. My parents had no complaints. My mother worked hard. Our house was always clean. She was a devoted mother. She cooked, cleaned, pressed shirts, didn’t go anyplace. Pleasure, her pleasure was a big family—that made everything!\n\n(In this and all subsequent quotations from the various participants, the added emphasis in italics is mine.) As these narratives suggest, parents’ and children’s fulfillment was derived from their role in meeting family responsibilities rather than through fulfillment of one’s personal desires or needs. Another elderly narrator reflected: I was a year old when I came here. We lived on Grand Street across from Ferrara’s Bakery. My mother had sixteen children—nine boys, six girls, a set of twins. . . . My father’s mother had twenty boys and one girl. What a regiment! My father was good looking, handsome and hardworking. He made nineteen dollars as a longshoreman and he painted apartments on the side. He had to do something to support all those babies he made! . . . My mother made her own bread, cooked. . . . She worked very hard; we were such a big family. Do ya know what it’s like to cook for such a family?!\n\nIn a world where the family’s status is derived by ‘‘signs of family wellbeing which emanates from the household’’ (Femminella and Quadagno 1976, 63) one sees in these narratives that the woman’s role was central to securing this status. Like, the windows! Why did everyone’s windows have to be clean? A lot of people were judged by their window from the outside. People could tell by looking at your windows if you were keeping up with your house inside.\n\nA woman’s power in the domestic sphere inhered from the fact that her work was vital to the survival of the family and the community (Anderson and Zinner 1988). The women seemed to identify with their mothers as the centers of the household. Girls were prepared at young ages to assume and endure many tasks and household responsibilities that prepared them for\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:31\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 17\n\n18 Elizabeth G. Messina\n\ntheir lives of hard work. The strong bond of identification that the girls developed with their mothers not only strengthened their sense of competence but also at times became so complete that they barely acknowledged their own intense industry. When I came home from school and saw the work that needed to be done I wanted to cry, but I got over it. I used to go shopping and take care of the younger kids for my mother. My mother had twelve kids, only nine survived. Some died young. . . . We had no tub and no hot water. We had to boil the water to wash the clothes. I used to hate doing that. We lived, we were happy, we had food! My mother used to sew coats in the house. By the time I was six years old, I was making coats too. They didn’t have a big salary. We appreciated it—their hard work.\n\nThere is some indirect evidence from cross-cultural studies (Weisner and Gallimore 1977; Werner 1979; Whiting and Child 1953) that sibling caretaking is an important source of support, stability, and continuity for children who grow up in large families. It might be inferred from the women’s narratives and from the evidence of studies (Werner and Smith 1982) that the assumption of responsibilities as a sibling caretaker may have contributed to the girls’ development of a sense of competence, responsibility, and a form of autonomy so extreme—due to the impossibility of their childhood needs being met—that it precluded the possibility of developing an adult interdependent relationship with their spouses. The narratives also suggest that as children, these girls learned to become cooperative and obedient and to intuitively repress any need that might go beyond the parents’ conception of their needs. This included repression of not only their emotional needs but also their desire for education and occupational mobility. The welfare of the family and the maintenance of its cohesion superseded individual fulfillment. I studied shorthand and typing in high school. I wanted a job as a secretary. My mother said no, you have to go to work with your two older sisters. It was a paper factory down there on Spring Street. . . . My mother didn’t know it, but she sent me to my husband! I met my future husband at work. My boss [foreman] married me.\n\nThe family’s survival was dependent upon the labor of all its members; the girls had to leave school to work and contribute to the support of the family. Not only was parental control of the girls maintained through strict discipline, but the girls searched for and found reasons to support their parents’ actions.\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:31\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 18\n\nNarratives of Nine Italian-American Women 19 I helped my mother with everything. She was a very hard-working woman; you’ll never find a woman like her. We had to work, or else! If I said anything it was, bing, right across the face. I don’t mind working. When you work, you look younger. . . . My parents always worked the feasts in the streets to make an extra dollar. I remember the San Gennaro feast in 1929. I was ten. My parents let me work with them. ‘‘You’re a working woman now,’’ they told me. . . . By the time I was fifteen, I left school to make ladies’ gloves, drapes and curtains in the factory.\n\nThe intensity of these work activities may have also served as a powerful coping tool that enabled the women to develop some immunity to the psychological stresses they endured as children. The research of Gal and Lazarus (1975) suggests that ‘‘activity’’ promotes a sense of mastery and control in addition to discharging energy generated by stressful life situations. The narratives suggest that the harshness and emotional isolation of daily life was soothed, particularly for the women, by their connection to the extended collective network of women in their apartment buildings and neighborhood. Through the mutual support and cooperation of neighbors, many daily burdens were eased. Yeah, I remember those days. No tub, no hot water, but you could visit without calling. Today you have to call first. Neighbors were neighbors then. Doors were always open. . . . We’d say, ‘‘I’m goin’ shoppin’, want me to pick something up for ya?’’ You didn’t have to lock your doors. We looked out for each other.\n\nCross-cultural studies indicate that regardless of social class and culture, a mother’s warmth and emotional stability toward her children is greater when there are more adults around to assist in their care (Werner and Smith, 1982). These women’s narratives suggest that mothering was embedded within an extensive network of kin and non-kin relations, thus softening the effects of deprivation in their lives. These women’s narratives also indicate that parental affection, combined with strong parental control as well as the presence of an extended network of kin and friends, contributed to the development and maintenance of family stability and cohesiveness. This family cohesiveness, in turn, appeared to be conducive to the development of what Antonovsky (1979) calls a psychological ‘‘sense of coherence,’’ a feeling of confidence and trust in the predictability of one’s environment and that things will work out as reasonably as can be expected.\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:31\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 19\n\n20 Elizabeth G. Messina\n\nIt is clear from the narratives that the women perceived their parents’ hard work as a deep expression of parental love for them as children. However, parents preoccupied with providing material resources for their children’s survival may have little time or emotional resources available to provide consistent emotional interactions with the children. Emotionally armored at young ages to forbear and accept the hardships of life, these women learned not to burden their parents with many of their feelings or problems. One way in which they won parental love was by being both competent and controlled, emotionally and sexually. In times of stress, children who have been unable to elicit emotionally responsive behavior from adults are prone to continue these patterns into adulthood. As we shall see later in this article, these patterns will affect their attachment behavior with their spouses.\n\nTheme 2 Our parents’ marriages worked because there were no other options open to them. The women’s attitudes toward marriage appear to represent those of the feudal society from which they and their parents had emigrated. It is similar in form to that of the European peasant family. In the hierarchy of that family structure, husbands and wives were workmates bound together to ensure the family’s survival. Similarly, the marriages of these women as well as those of their parents appear to have been based on a mutual system of obligations with little or no expectation of emotional intimacy and sexual fulfillment. We married at our own level. This is very important to a successful marriage. Marriages were successful because they had to be. . . . In those days men didn’t have the time or money to fool around. . . . Those marriages years ago were solid. [My parents] were matched. My cousin introduced them. A short romance. You got married; that was it. You didn’t have to be in love. Everything was in the home. Divorces were shameful.\n\nHistorically in the European peasant family structure, the more immediate practical considerations of taking on the roles of wife and mother through marriage had ascendancy over considerations of emotional or sexual intimacy in the marital relationship. The narratives suggest that some marriages were pragmatically arranged and essential to survival: My father was in the war and arranged my marriage to a man I never loved. Non avevo amore. [I wasn’t in love.] We were poor and not in love but we married right away. There wasn’t anyone better at the time.\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:31\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 20\n\nNarratives of Nine Italian-American Women 21\n\nTheme 3 When we were growing up, emotional and sexual intimacy in our parents’ marital relationships was hidden from our view and surrounded by secrecy. Romantic expectations of emotional fulfillment in the marital relationship were not aspired to and, therefore, not cultivated (Poster 1980). The picture that emerges in the women’s narratives of parental marital relations suggests that gestures of physical affection between the parents in front of the children, as well as verbal expressions of emotional or sexual desire, was strictly taboo. I never once saw my father kiss my mother. We always joked that Mom had eighteen children and had never been kissed! . . . No, everything was hidden; we were ashamed. We never seen them, so discreet, no kisses. God forbid, you cursed.\n\nsub-theme Because sexual activity was never spoken of openly in our homes, we had few, if any, opportunities to develop our knowledge of sexual and emotional intimacy. It was so backwards; it wasn’t funny. They had all those kids. They were ashamed to talk to us. They fed you, they sheltered you, but they didn’t talk. We were so green; we didn’t know about marriage. . . . Everything was a secret. No curse words, no sex. How could you enjoy sex? Everything was a mystery. . . . Everything was private. Not even the word pregnant was used. [Instead] they’d say ‘‘in the family way.’’ They were strict that way.\n\nThe taboos in the family surrounding talk about sex appeared to generate in the children a collective fear, and ignorance, of even the most elementary physiological facts of the sex act, pregnancy, and birth: My mother never talked about nothin’. . . . In those days you had your babies at home. You know we believed her [my mother] when she told us: the midwife brings the babies. My mother would say: ‘‘Now go upstairs to your Aunt Fran’s. Rosa Maria [the midwife] is coming and she’s going to bring us another baby.’’ I’d see Rosa Maria comin’ up the stairs with a suitcase and remember thinking to myself, ‘‘But how can a baby fit in such a small bag?’’ But I believed my mother when she told me that Rosa Maria brings the babies to the house. . . . We didn’t know anything [about sex]. . . . Where\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:32\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 21\n\n22 Elizabeth G. Messina were you going to learn? . . . We didn’t know how the children were made! . . . Every two years I had a child. Can you imagine my husband wanted twelve! . . . only one son died.\n\nThe narrators reflect their mothers’ view of sex; the mothers transmitted to their daughters the idea that sex is primarily a matter of procreative duty rather than fun or pleasure. The birds and the bees? No, you never discuss sex with your mother . . . the subject was closed. Never spoke about it. Having babies was her duty!\n\nSexual repression of a woman’s impulses prior to marriage was the norm: only marriage legalized and sanctified her sexuality. The woman who engaged in any independent sexual activity outside of marriage was considered a whore. Consequently, southern Italian culture encouraged women to emulate the feminine ideal of the Madonna in her roles as virgin and mother (Warner 1976). The Madonna’s most outstanding quality is her asexuality. She became a mother without becoming a wife (Parsons 1969). The Virgin’s renunciation of sexuality infuses maternity with a repudiation of erotic impulses and, as such, a woman’s culturally proscribed satisfaction was to be derived primarily from her nurturing, caretaking, and servicing roles. In this context, woman’s sexual fulfillment is not a consideration. It appears that the women internalized their mothers’ cultural ideal of the asexual Virgin in their roles as wives and mothers. The narratives suggest that the women internalized implicit parental prohibition of all sexual activity outside of marriage. The wish to not incur parental disapproval and disappointment was an internally powerful psychological force that motivated women to inhibit and repress their instinctual life. Two women’s comments, below, exemplify this desire to avoid parental disapproval or disappointment. The only reason we didn’t have sex before we got married is because we didn’t want to hurt our parents. They were so good and worked so hard; how could we hurt them? Oh, no! You never talked to your mother about any of this. I was no kid when I got married; I was twenty-eight. Like I said, I never did nothin’, like having sex, before I got married, because I didn’t want to hurt my parents. And, it’s a good thing I didn’t do it before. Look how fast I got caught. In one month I was pregnant. Imagine if I had done it . . . . Men had a lot of respect for the women they dated in those days. They wouldn’t try anything.\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:32\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 22\n\nNarratives of Nine Italian-American Women 23\n\nMothers appeared to be unable to discuss any aspect of their daughter’s sexuality with them. Even the onset of menstruation appeared to be experienced by many of the women as an abrupt and puzzling event that aroused feelings of danger, anxiety, and shame. We never told our mothers when we first got our period. I remember I was at the San Gennaro feast; I didn’t know what ‘‘it’’ was. I was bleeding. I went home and told my mother: ‘‘Ma, I’m bleedin’ from the bottom.’’ She got red in the face and started yelling, ‘‘Which boy touched you; tell me who it is; I’ll kill him!’’ I kept cryin’ and tellin’ her, ‘‘But Ma, no one touched me!’’ Finally, she listened and stopped yellin’ but she couldn’t talk about ‘‘it.’’ I was only ten and a half years old. She sent me next door and told me to talk to my aunt. Aunt Josie got a diaper and showed me how to fold it. In those days there was no Kotex. She told me to be sure to keep clean, to change it every few hours and wash it real good and put a clean one on so I don’t smell. ‘‘Everybody bleeds.’’ That’s all my mother said when I had my first menstruation. . . . I remember the clean sheets were torn into strips. We rinsed them in cold water. We never talked about it.\n\nThe contingencies of biological necessity, interwoven with sexual taboos, appeared to create a shame-generated system of internalized rules and boundaries that governed everyday life inside and outside the home. It used to be when we were young, everyone was always watching us. People talked and whispered if they saw you with a boy. You were never free no matter where you were. Even at work you couldn’t talk to a man. They were always warning us about boys: ‘‘If you let them touch you, you’ll be given a beating!’’ Don’t lift up your dress or go with boys; that’s all my mother said.\n\nNot surprisingly, the women carried into their marriage relationships the norms learned in the parental home. The parents’ perceptions of natural instinctual life were consciously and unconsciously carried into the relationship with the woman’s marital partner. The narratives reveal that these women were well acquainted with the duties, and very few of the pleasures, of conjugal relations. As a result of the excessive sexual repression required of these women prior to marriage and the imperative that they bear many children in marriage, many of them became mothers without ever experiencing orgasmic and sexual pleasure.\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:32\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 23\n\n24 Elizabeth G. Messina Sensations? Who had sensations? You were always worried you’re going to get pregnant. Who could enjoy? After we had the change of life, we were free, but then we’re too tired to do it! You work, you come home, you cook, who wanted to? Thank God I had a man who didn’t bother me too much!\n\nThis attitude toward sexual relations is strikingly similar to that of the peasant women interviewed by Ann Cornelisen (1977) in Lucania, Italy. They, too, perceived sexual relations with their husbands as ‘‘something necessary, as duty, as trial, but not passion’’ (20). Women didn’t know a climax. Always kids between them, in the bed, outside the bed. They [the couples] were caught [meaning, ‘‘they became pregnant’’] so fast they used to sneak it. Then it was all over!\n\nDespite the religious and legal prohibition against abortion, the narratives reveal that abortions were an alternative if a husband arranged or agreed to it. Abortions were performed by midwives and physicians under circumstances that threatened the women’s lives. Several of the narratives illustrated this. I had an abortion. My husband didn’t want it [the baby]. He couldn’t afford it. He arranged it; he sent me to a doctor on the West Side. He scraped it. Thank God, I had no problems! Everything went nice! My mother had this preservative. . . . It worked if you didn’t want to keep a child . . . but my husband wouldn’t let me use it. I was pregnant every fifteen months! . . . I asked the doctor what I could do to slow things down. He told me to divide the beds, sleep apart. Eventually, I refused my husband all the time. You know it was illegal, but there was the midwife. People in the neighborhood knew about her. My sister had it [an abortion] done and she hemorrhaged badly. She went to the hospital emergency room for help. She told them she fell. You had to be careful; they were always checking up. Detectives came into the emergency room and questioned her, but she stuck to her story; she didn’t squeal . . . but the poison needle almost killed her.\n\nIt seems reasonable to suggest that the psychological conflicts engendered by the experiences described thus far resulted in marriages that were built on attachments that were so unconsciously and intrinsically conflicted, there\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:33\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 24\n\nNarratives of Nine Italian-American Women 25\n\nwas little opportunity for the marital pair to develop sexually or emotionally fulfilling relationships.\n\nTheme 4 We had our own ways of handling our problems with our husbands, but we paid dearly for those solutions psychologically. Because of the early link between affection and dependency, subsequent attachments often reflect the child’s developmental history of love and affection (Parsons 1969). The study of the socioemotional development of infants (Ainsworth 1969, 1979; Ainsworth et al. 1978; Bowlby 1958, 1969) suggests that an individual’s early attachment relationships provide a working model of the world that lays the foundation for future interpersonal interactions. Thus the adult attachment acts as a continuation of the attachment system begun in infancy. The quality of this early attachment enables the adult to establish a variety of relationships across the life span. A child whose attachment figure is responsive and caring during periods of distress, and lovingly administers to the infant’s physical demands, may provide the infant with a working model of trust and safety. Thus far the narratives have suggested that in the women’s families of origin, their parents’ resources were directed toward meeting the child’s and the family’s survival requirements as well as restricting the availability of parental resources for the cultivation of the child’s inner emotional life. While basic needs for physical care and affection appear to have been met, the women’s early adaptation required that they not endanger their parents emotional equilibrium. They learned not to express any feelings of inadequacy or discomfort. In a desire to maintain a positive regard for the parents—on whom their survival depended—they learned to deny the reality of many of their childhood desires and feelings. Unacceptable feelings, including aggression related to longings (sexual and emotional), rejections, and deprivations, were subjected to an enforced silence, practiced by their parents and probably their parents before them. This pattern of enforced silence and nonverbalized emotions was replicated later in marital relationships. Many of the women traced their husbands’ inability to be emotionally intimate, loving, and affectionate to developmental deficits suffered by their husbands in their families of origin. The women theorize that their husbands’ parents had too many children and too little time to be openly affectionate with all of them. So, they reasoned, parents chose not to be openly affectionate with any of them.\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:33\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 25\n\n26 Elizabeth G. Messina Years ago our parents had no time for us. That’s the way they [our husbands] were raised. . . . Yeah, they had thirteen, eighteen children. Who are they going to kiss first? They probably figured it was better not to kiss any of them. Someone would always be left out.\n\nWhile the flood of disappointment that the women felt about their husbands was put into words in the narratives, they describe marriages that were dominated by emotional silence, sexual confusion, and unnamable feelings. As they viewed it, their husbands were not educated to express feelings verbally. This subsequently interfered with their ability to put feelings into words in their marriages: You know what the problem is, it’s a shame really. He never shows affection. If I came over to my husband and put my hand on his shoulder or touched his face just to show him my feelings, it always meant ‘‘the bed.’’ He doesn’t know how to show love or appreciation. You know what it’s like; you don’t exist in the house. You’d think once in a while he’d compliment me on a good meal, no! You sit down at the table and he never says, ‘‘Maria, what a good meal!’’ or, ‘‘You did a great job!’’ No, you know what he says when I tell him that once in a while he could tell me he likes something? He says, ‘‘You see the dish empty; that’s the compliment! You don’t see the chef coming out asking the customers to thank him. The empty dish says it all. It’s the best compliment you can give a cook.’’\n\nThe interactional patterns of the husband are such that feelings and thoughts are not put into language. From his perspective, his wife should understand from his actions that the meal was satisfying; words are unnecessary. The husband is incapable of perceiving the uniqueness of his wife’s needs apart from his own. This precludes the possibility that this conflict can be resolved. As a result of early childhood deficits, both husband and wife were locked into separate, psychological prisons, leaving them illequipped to meet each other’s needs in a maturationally progressive manner. Not surprisingly, the women did not recognize how their own unmet maturational needs may have contributed to an emotionally disappointing marital experience. From a psychoanalytic perspective (Kirman, 1989), people who marry are looking for an idealized version of their parent, but they usually find a version of the parent they actually had. Their marital disappointments notwithstanding, it appears that many of the women developed strong attachments to their spouses. Bowlby (1969,\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:33\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 26\n\nNarratives of Nine Italian-American Women 27\n\n1980) suggests that in the heterosexual bond, a person may be seeking the kind of security one experienced as a child with one’s parents. These women provided ‘‘care’’ for their marital partners through learned behaviors that mirrored their life experiences and replicated their early experiences with their caretakers as children. The women were left with a working model of the world (derived from their interactions with their attachment figures) in which individuals do not recognize or respond to most of their emotional needs. As in their interactions with their parents, nurturing and food-giving behaviors appeared to have dominated their interactions with their husband and children. Such patterns suggest that needs are to be gratified and met through non-verbal action-oriented behavior When this becomes a working model in which needs are to be anticipated and met by the caregiver without putting one’s needs into words, then conflict and disappointment are most likely to ensue. For some women, another source of marital conflict is the incorporation of the double standard into the marriage relationship, contributing to the maintenance of a power imbalance in which women are required to take major responsibility for preserving the marriage bond and managing the risks of the husband’s sexual infidelity and emotional abandonment. The husband’s legendary right to be unfaithful is experienced by the woman as a source of deep humiliation and betrayal. I was young and I believed a man. It is only with experience that I realize how things really are. ‘‘Tutti sono traditori!’’ [They are all traitors!] Men, before they marry, treat women like a god; everything is nice; they are affectionate and say nice words. When they marry, everything changes. Non sono fidele, sono traditori! [They’re unfaithful; they’re traitors!] You know what ‘‘va’ fa’ in culo’’ means? [‘‘Up yours!’’] That’s what we told our husbands without saying it if they bothered us.\n\nThe incorporation of a double standard into the relationship can lead to a marital pattern in which the wish for revenge becomes greater than the hope of being loved. When a person suffers repeated humiliations and is unable to influence or change the situation, that person and those around her suffer the weight of accumulated repressed anger. Recent studies (Leiblum, 1988; Rosen, 1988) have found that the emotional life of couples shapes their sexual life. These studies show that depression and anger are particularly devastating to erotic desires. What appears to be a loss of desire had often been found to be a disguised form of anger or part of a power\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:34\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 27\n\n28 Elizabeth G. Messina\n\nstruggle. Repressed rage creates hatred and fantasies of revenge which can interfere with keeping alive loving feelings. A wife may conceal her own wish for revenge on her husband by torturing him psychologically in her withdrawal from him sexually. The acting out of revenge can become a substitute for experiencing the grief and loss that both partners feel when their emotional needs remain unmet. In this context, the wish for revenge expressed indirectly throughout the narratives may be viewed as a desperate attempt to compensate for the emotionally wounding experiences created in the marriage.\n\nTheme 5 Looking back, we are not too happy with our lives but we did the best we could with what we had. As many of the women looked back on their domestic and working lives they seemed to be seeing with new eyes just how demanding their roles were, particularly when they compared their lives to those of women today. How did we do it in those days? No help from nobody. One in the stomach, one trailing behind, one climbing the stairs; we shopped, cooked and cleaned like that! Today they got everything: window washers, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers; and, they’re always tired!\n\nSome of the women even seemed to be acknowledging the oppressiveness of their lives and of roles not freely chosen. Years ago, how did we do it? What did we know? What did our mothers know? I cooked on Sunday after my husband died for my daughter and grandchildren. Now I cook for my brother and I hate it. Can you explain that? I get disgusted and tired. I don’t even like to cook for myself. How we did it, went to work, went shopping, bring stuff up to the house before we went to work!\n\nThe narratives suggest that marriage was often a source of inescapable suffering that provided little opportunity for the development of love and affection. In the words of one woman: If you write a book, tell everyone, ‘‘Only have two children. La Sacra Famiglia [The Holy Family]! Matrimony is made for children. It has no other use, no other purpose.’’ My parents lived in misery. I lived in misery. I would have liked to go to school, but there was no opportunity!\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:34\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 28\n\nNarratives of Nine Italian-American Women 29 . . . Today I would divorce. Before marriage, there is love and affection. After marriage, maledizione [damn it all]! If a woman isn’t perfect, the man makes her miserable. No, today I would divorce. Should I suffer and be miserable or suffer and be free? What do you think?\n\nSome of the women seemed, psychologically, able to rise above the constriction of their life experiences and express an appreciation for the greater sexual freedom of women today. Today virgins are out of style! If they’re still virgins, they shouldn’t be. Believe me. I’m Catholic, but you should try it first to see if you like it . . . You don’t know a man until you sleep with him. I knew my husband for seven years before we married, but I didn’t know him [sexually] until the night of our wedding. Finally, women have liberta` [freedom]! I’m old, but if I were young, I’d do as I feel. Il Dio ha creao il sesso, perche, no usare? Si non usare, e studpida! [God created sex, why not enjoy it? If you don’t, you’re stupid!]\n\nThese nine women of Mott Street appear to have developed a resourcefulness and inner strength early in life that enabled them to meet the challenges of raising families while working and managing households in a culture that granted them little opportunity to develop as sovereign individuals. Their sense of power seems rooted in their awareness that they did not survive their experiences by chance alone: they developed a sense of selfcompetence and pragmatism through the early assumption of family responsibilities. This helped them build the high level of tolerance and emotional self-control necessary for survival. They earned their psychological hardiness by enduring the many adversities of their childhood and adult lives. They were courageous and strong women who fulfilled their familial duties with a sense of purpose and commitment. They identified with the strength of their mothers as ‘‘centers of households’’ but also expressed discontent with their traditional marriage roles. The psychological accommodations that were necessary for survival over the centuries required that many parts of the ‘‘self ’’ remain hidden and undeveloped. While their ability to be strong, pragmatic and self-sacrificing enabled them to survive, they were prevented from experiencing and coming to terms with many of their emotional desires, vulnerabilities and sexual needs in relationships. Like the participants of this study, we all carry, in the words of Alice Miller (1984), ‘‘bits of our unmastered past’’ into our adulthoods. I would add that we also carry within us, consciously and unconsciously, bits of the\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH1\n\n11-17-10 14:43:34\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 29\n\n30 Elizabeth G. Messina\n\nunmastered pasts of our parents and grandparents. If there is a lesson to be learned from the narratives of the lives of these women it is this: through making the unmastered past conscious, we become free psychologically to meet the developmental challenges of integrating aspects of our feminine identity which have been split and dissociated for centuries.

Their play was entitled Why, It’s Mother. In the first scene, leading lady Mrs. Passarella ruefully hears her grown daughters inform her they’re going out again—this time to a conference. ‘‘What’s that you mean, conference?’’ Mrs. Passarella asks. ‘‘Oh, dear, it would be so difficult to make you understand,’’ daughter Amelia replies. ‘‘Besides, you wouldn’t be interested.’’\n\nYet in the course of the play, Mrs. Passarella is transformed. Her English vastly improves, she begins subscribing to Reader’s Digest and Good Housekeeping, and she cooks wholesome American meals that cure her husband’s hypertension. She learns first aid and takes up interior decorating. Her previously neglectful family is delighted—once they get over their shock. What miracle creates this thoroughly modern woman with just a trace of an Italian accent? One thing the play lacks is subtlety. The credit all goes to Mrs. Passarella’s recent membership in her local Italian Mothers’ Club.1 The establishment of Italian Mothers’ Clubs was a short-lived twentiethcentury phenomenon. These clubs filled a need for many first-generation Italian immigrant women. The structure and mores of the Italian family isolated these women both from each other and from their American neighbors. They had little idea how to use the resources open to them in America and their ignorance tended to distance them from their own children. Many recognized something lacking and lamented their loneliness but did little about it themselves.

The gifts are symbols that her family loves her and respects her role in the family structure, but this does nothing to alleviate her isolation or bring a friend to the door.2 Various United States institutions intent on Americanizing immigrants attempted to reach out to women and children. The Italian Mothers’ Clubs established in New York in the 1930s and 1940s were examples of this trend. Many of these clubs were organized by Elba Farabegoli, an energetic second-generation Italian woman. The clubs touched off a brief period of synergy in which Italian women used the clubs both to learn American customs and to preserve their own culture while they willingly made the transition from Italian women living in America to Italian-American women. The activities of the various clubs offer insight into the nature and mentality of immigrant women in general as well as the specific experience of first-generation Italian immigrant women. They show ‘‘why it’s mother’’ who had a particularly tough time adapting to a new world. To understand the development of Italian Mothers’ Clubs, one must understand a woman’s role in the family structure of southern Italy. Virtually every historian who has studied the subject agrees that the Italian family was the only meaningful social institution in the Mezzogiorno culture from which most southern Italian immigrants came. A village was just a place, a government could rise or fall, but the family was constant.3 Italian families were nuclear families headed by the father or eldest male. One’s family also included one’s in-laws, other nuclear families to whom one was related by marriage. Among these people, there was solidarity; there was little more than distrust for anyone else. Mezzogiorno Italians felt no concept of community, because the family met all one’s social needs. Private associations with those outside the family were not encouraged and the American concept of friendship was unknown.4 Relationships with those unrelated by blood or marriage could only be formed through comparaggio or godparenthood. A person became a godparent through a ritualized series of steps that might have little to do with the actual baptism of a child. A godparent was considered technically a member of one’s family and therefore within the charmed circle of people one could trust.5 A girl born into a Mezzogiorno family quickly learned she had little importance as an individual. Her father and brothers had authority over her; her mother took precedence. From a very early age, she would be separated from the opposite sex and all her actions would be closely supervised. Her\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH2\n\n11-17-10 14:43:33\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 33\n\n34 Lorett Treese\n\nmother would carefully train her to become a future wife and mother herself. She would be taught that a wife’s faithfulness, loyalty, and obedience to her husband were of prime importance. However, she would be kept ignorant of even the most basic information about sex; that was for her husband to teach her. She was considered well educated if she knew her society’s rules and behaved accordingly. Her family would arrange her marriage to a bachelor who could further the family’s interests. Of course, she had no say in the matter, as a well-brought-up girl could hardly be expected to know any men in her village.6 Historians dealing with the Italian family also generally agree that Mezzogiorno culture was ‘‘patriarchal.’’ They disagree as to exactly what this means. Leonard Covello and Joseph Lopreato both contended that the family was not strictly patriarchal and did allow wives some say in family decision-making. Richard Gambino wrote that while the father was the ‘‘head’’ of the family, the mother was its ‘‘center.’’ Lydio Tomasi suggested that the family was ‘‘father-dominated’’ but also ‘‘mother-oriented’’ in that a wife implemented and therefore interpreted her husband’s wishes. In a more psychological study, Andrew Rolle wrote that the Italian mother reacted by courting her children’s loyalty and creating a family structure he described as ‘‘neurotic.’’ Feminists have recently criticized all these historians on the grounds that they never fully examined or analyzed the Italian woman’s point of view.7 How women felt about the Italian family structure, particularly once they left the Mezzogiorno and could view it in perspective, can be interpreted from some of their own statements. Doris Weatherfield studied immigrant women from various cultures and found that women from virtually every ethnic group were making negative comments about marriage in the period between 1840 and 1930. She wrote that by the 1930s, first-generation Italian women sometimes expressed an interest in visiting Italy, but never in returning to live in the Mezzogiorno. One Italian woman mentioned that in Italy, ‘‘the woman she works like the jackass.’’8 A female social worker named Marie Hall Ets recorded the autobiographical anecdotes of a loquacious Italian immigrant named Rosa. Although Rosa was from northern Italy, she followed Italian tradition by being consistently loyal to both her husbands. Her first husband beat and terrorized both her and their children, but her second husband was a much more affectionate and caring man. Even so, she felt better off when he died. As a widow, she said, she had ‘‘no man to scold me and make me do this and stop me to do that . . . I have it like heaven—I’m my own boss.’’9\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH2\n\n11-17-10 14:43:33\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 34\n\n‘‘Why, It’s Mother’’: The Italian Mothers’ Clubs of New York 35\n\nClearly, an Italian upbringing and an Italian marriage that created another Italian family did not give a woman much room for personal growth. In Italy, this was the norm and might have gone unnoticed. In America it led to feelings of discontent and perhaps desire for change even among women who enjoyed their roles of wife and mother. Family historians agree that besides cooking, housework, and child care, an Italian wife’s duties extended to managing the family finances and arranging marriages for the children. Once Italian immigrants came to America, women were quickly divested of their ability to arrange marriages. Single men formed the first groups of Italian immigrants. While their own families in Italy may have supplied their brides, those brides were less able to perform the same service for their offspring. Although Italians preferred to settle among people from their own ancestral villages or regions, women no longer had a lifelong knowledge of all the eligible marriage candidates and were less equipped to pick spouses for their children.10 Today, we might consider a woman’s management of the household finances an important task that would give her considerable control over the family. However, while Italian women purchased household necessities and managed the budget, whether their authority extended to making major decisions regarding family resources is questionable. When Rosa’s second husband wanted to invest the bulk of their savings in what Rosa considered a dubious venture, she tearfully protested, but she also handed over the cash. Rosa might have been the family bookkeeper but her husband was the CFO.11 In general, first-generation Italian women worked hard, with lots of responsibility, but they had little real authority over their families. Yet Italians themselves respected a woman’s role and usually described it in somewhat romantic terms. Even Elba Farabegoli stated, ‘‘The mother is the family’s inspiration and guide.’’12 Historian Richard Alba described Italian immigrants as ‘‘more greenhorn than most.’’ They isolated themselves from the larger society and settled in Little Italies that shielded them for a time from American customs and mores. These Little Italies were themselves separated into blocks and tenements peopled by Italians from the same village or region. Historians use the term campanilismo to describe this settlement pattern. In Italian campanile means bell tower. The familiar sound of a village church bell could only be heard by those in the immediate area. Campanilismo refers to an extreme provincialism in one’s trend of thought. In America, campanilismo isolated\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH2\n\n11-17-10 14:43:34\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 35\n\n36 Lorett Treese\n\npeople with the same manners and mores not only from Americans but from other Italians as well.13 Rosa described Italian clannishness when she said, ‘‘The people from Toscana, they’re not good like the people from Lombardia. But they’re not bad like the people from Sicilia.’’14 New York attracted the greatest number of Italian immigrants and served as a point from which many departed to other places in America. New York had several Little Italies, each one a hodgepodge of clustered people trying to reproduce the atmosphere of their village at home. In 1919, Robert Foerster described the Italians of New York as ‘‘unschooled, scattered, mobile [and] sundered by regional rivalries.’’ About ten years later, social worker Caroline Ware studied Greenwich Village. She found that blocks no longer consistently housed people from a single province but that Italians still retained their suspicions of those from other regions.15 Like other immigrant groups, Italians established mutual aid associations and fraternal organizations to provide uninsured workers in hazardous occupations with health and death benefits. These grew into lodges that offered a variety of entertainments. In establishing the organizations, Italian immigrants seemed to be following the lead of other ethnic groups in America. Yet such associations had also existed in the more industrialized north of Italy as well as the agricultural south. Their members generally included the village elite who used them to extend the resources of family and kinship networks.16 Italians managed to infuse even these organizations with campanilismo. The organizations were frequently named after the patron saint of a particular town and membership might be limited to those who had been born there. More ‘‘broadly based’’ organizations might be open to immigrants from a single region or province. In 1910, between one and two thousand such organizations existed, depending on who was doing the counting. In her study of Greenwich Village, Ware commented that no single person in New York could name all the Italian organizations in the city, though one newspaper was then making attempts to compile a list.17 Other ethnic groups consolidated their various associations under umbrella organizations. Italians tried to do the same thing, especially once World War I gave them a more nationalistic point of view. Italian umbrella organizations such as the Sons of Italy were founded, but the spirit of campanilismo lingered among Italians and prevented their umbrella organizations from ever being very effective. At the beginning of the 1930s, Ware found that membership in Italian associations in general was declining.18\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH2\n\n11-17-10 14:43:34\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 36\n\n‘‘Why, It’s Mother’’: The Italian Mothers’ Clubs of New York 37\n\nThis brief interest in forming organizations had almost no effect on Italian women. In Italy, women had been welcome to serve food at association benefits but had acted more as spectators than participants at functions. In America women at first were banned from fraternal organizations. When they were allowed to become members (for the purpose of acquiring insurance), their participation was limited and did nothing to take them out of the house or give them opportunities to expand their horizons.19 One American experience that might have changed the lives of Italian women was their need to earn a wage. Their husbands’ work was often seasonal in nature and rarely brought in enough money to support a family. Necessity forced Italian wives into the workplace. Italian women sometimes earned wages that accounted for nearly half of the family income. But their status as wage earners failed to change their role in the family structure, eliminate their isolation, or Americanize them very much. In Italy a wife did not work outside the home, and in America, Italians did not admit it when she did. Neither husbands nor wives themselves defined what women did as ‘‘work.’’ Their status as wage earners was always considered a temporary situation. Virginia Yans-McLaughlin, who studied this phenomenon, called it evidence of ‘‘continuing paternal control’’ of the male over the Italian family.20 As a result, Italian women never took much advantage of the opportunity to band together in labor unions. In 1919, Julia Poyntz, education director of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union, wrote that Italian women were still ‘‘suffering from that age long seclusion of women in the home.’’ Despite their work experience, Ware added, ‘‘Many of the older Italian women virtually never left their own blocks or went farther from their homes than to the market and to church.’’21 But within the home itself, things were changing. While Italian parents tried to retain the culture of the Mezzogiorno in an urban setting, their children were being influenced by American schools. According to Foerster in 1919, American schools acted as ‘‘a powerful instrument for adaptation’’ that Italian parents lacked. At school, children were exposed to American concepts of democracy and individualism plus different mores of courtship and marriage, all drawing them emotionally away from Old World ways.22 This created what historians and sociologists have termed intergenerational conflict, a trend that has generally been studied from the point of view of the second generation. Nothing has been written about the reaction of isolated Italian mothers and what they might have experienced as their children became increasingly American. However, the author of Why, It’s\n\n................. 17952$\n\n$CH2\n\n11-17-10 14:43:34\n\nPS\n\nPAGE 37\n\n38 Lorett Treese\n\nMother was an Italian woman who had lived through the pain of this very experience. In the play, Mrs. Passarella’s daughters depart to pursue their activities, leaving their mother alone with a pile of mending. As she sighs and stares at it, an offstage narrator describes her feelings. Somehow of late, she had been feeling like an outsider in her own home. Her husband and children seem to belong to another world . . . a world which is just outside her door.\n\nThat ‘‘world’’ might as easily have been another planet. The first-generation Italian woman had no vehicle to take her there.23 Various American institutions, intent on their own purposes, would provide such a vehicle for Italian women. And Italian women, increasingly dissatisfied with their isolation and their subordinate roles, would be ready to take advantage of the opportunities they offered. In the 1890s, settlement houses began appearing in the urban slums. Social workers ‘‘settled’’ among immigrants both to teach and to learn from them. They offered educational opportunities that could help Americanize immigrants. Americans had long considered themselves individuals, and social workers reached out to women and children as fellow individuals, something women and children had not experienced in the typical Italian family.24 Caroline Ware described a movement to get women out of their houses and into clubs. She alluded to the existence of Italian Mothers’ Clubs in New York by 1930. Many women were receptive to joining such organizations. In Chicago, in an earlier period, one social worker asked Rosa to encourage other women in her neighborhood to join a mothers’ club. Rosa commented, ‘‘Those women didn’t know what it was, but they wanted to come anyway.’’25 In a study of Italian Mothers’ Clubs founded in Chicago during the twentieth century, Mary Ellen Batinich described an evolution in the control of these clubs which she linked to the transformation of Italian immigrant women in the same period. Italian women in the first decade of the twentieth century came to club meetings but were merely passive attendees. By the 1930s, they were planning their own activities, sometimes to the chagrin of social workers. During the 1940s, membership declined as a broader perspective among Italian women made them ready to take their places in American organizations such as the PTA.26 Many Italian Mo"
