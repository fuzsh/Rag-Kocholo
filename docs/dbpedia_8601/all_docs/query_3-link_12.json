        "text": "Anitta, Funk Generation – Brazil’s reigning superstar didn’t get to the top by sucking, so of course she puts out competent+ albums. Formally, the most interesting thing about her latest is that only one of the 15 songs passes the three minute mark, which means its assembly line funk doesn’t have time to get stale. But as great as this may sound in the club, in a more reflective listening place it’s hard to distinguish her from the competition. Where Billie and Olivia and even the boring-to-me Taylor manage to assert an artistic identity within the pop machine, Anitta is merely its product. Music as fast food. But, of course, there are reasons fast food is popular, and as with that addictive junk, the producers here have figured out a ruthlessly efficient formula to worm their way into your ear, even the ear of cynical reviewer. That’s where those short tunes come in again. Finding a beat or a vocal hook or something to grab you, Anitta and the producers ride it hard and fast, and then move on before you can get bored or think too deeply about it. If it doesn’t have the cultural heft of Motown, that’s probably more because I’m oldish. Why can’t the kids have their fun, too? Grade: B\n\nLuiza Brina, Prece – She tried expanding the more austere sounds of Tão Tá without much success on Tenho Saudade Mas Já Passou, but on her latest she finds the right balance between her quieter early music and the bigger sound she’s been reaching for. The secret is she doesn’t move as far away from the traditionalist mode as she fills it out, even with the occasional modern touch. She’s stronger in this vein than she is in a middle of the road MPB sound. Her details pop, and the polyrhythmic beds of percussion give the music an engaging flow. The album emerged from ten years of writing non-religious ‘prayers’ that helped her connect with something spiritual without the institutional or theological baggage of organized religion. The music’s yearning, hopeful, contemplative aura drives home that theme even when lyrics are hard to find. Grade: B+\n\nCarne Doce, Cererê – With touring and collective recording derailed by Covid, the excellent Interior did not serve as the launch it could have, so the first album in four years feels like a possible new start. Salma Jô’s and Macloys Aquino’s pandemic duo projects hinted and new directions that the band might head. Instead they went right back to the sounds they started exploring with Tônus. After the excellent Salma e Mac release Voo Livre, that turn was disappointing. Maybe their songwriting well was running dry. No one can keep it up forever, and four excellent albums of Brazilian indie rock (plus Voo Livre) would be a heckuva legacy. But once I’d absorbed the disappointment, I heard the band that has grabbed my ears this past decade like few others. It does sag in the second half, but the band plays and Jô sings as well as they ever have, which is a key part of why the band has done so well. Peak? No. Entering a phase of diminishing marginal returns? Time will tell. But for now, they still are worth my ear time. Listen and buy here. Grade: B+\n\nCéu, Novela – With help from producer Adrian Younge and a cameo from Ladybug Mecca, Céu starts this album as strong as she’s ever been. The lush R&B moves that follow give her voice, which continues the warmer singing of the previous two albums, a slick, funky context in which to shine. But neither Young nor Céu can keep it up for a whole album. The strong, more straightforward North American rhythms overwhelm her vocals. Both artists have good ideas, but also struggle to keep them sharp over a whole album. In other words, Céu is back to the not bad that has marked her career with the exception of those two 2021 albums. Great lead track, however. Listen here. Grade: C\n\nDuda Beat, Tara e Tal – Leads off with the purest disco she’s done—that whomp whomp is so deliciously retro—and continues apace for six more tracks with the slow incorporation of more modern sounds. But the folky guitar strum on “por aí mozão” knocks the album right out of its groove, followed by the rocky “NiGHT MARé”, which is even worse. Closes with three that could have been a gentle landing after the first seven, but instead come across as wobbly attempts to recover momentum. On that first half, however, she’s never been better. Listen here. Grade: B-\n\nVerônica Ferriani, Cochico no Silêncio Vira Barulho, Irmã – For the best album of her career, Ferriani surrounds herself with women to reflect upon womanhood while refracting through the life-altering event of having kids. Where family often slows down the working life as those time-and-attention sponges we call kids take over, Ferriani springs off the change to lift her art to a level it’s never reached. In forty-eight minutes split over two discs—or, really, ‘discs’ since this is a streaming world and I’m not even sure how to buy the physical I so want—Ferriani ponders the imbalance of parenthood that so many women experience, highs blunted and lows deepened by the different expectations and workloads women face when kids enter the picture without losing sight of what’s good amid the sometimes bad. The album cover captures the tension brilliantly with a barely-holding-it-together Ferrarini holding a frying pan with a cavaquinho handle: her new life in miniature. Musically, she leans more into samba than is her MPB norm. Those sambas balance both traditional and modern to ground her lyrical ideas, much like the parenting she’s learning to navigate in a society that tears women in both those directions. The ambition is welcome. Motherhood hasn’t been mental freeze at all for Ferriani. Listen here. Grade: A-\n\nJosyara, Mandinga Multiplicação – Josyara Canta Timbalada – Scaling back the band approach of ÀdeusdarÁ, Josyara returns to the guitar/voice strengths of Mansa Fúria in this tribute to Carlinhos Brown’s Timbalada. Six potent songs in 13 minutes, this EP gets tradition right (as Brazilian artists so often do) not by replicating, but by revivifying. Leading off with “Ralé—the opening couplet declares Jesus a Palestinian—she makes clear that this music is not merely of the past. Nor are the struggles against oppression by black and brown people “U-Maracá” documents. Even the four love songs that close out the EP sound more alive than recycled. But as nice as the songs are, it’s that voice and, especially, guitar, which she plays as rhythmically as the percussion-heavy band she’s covering, that deliver them. If, like me, you found the good ÀdeusdarÁ disappointing after the top-notch Mansa Fúria, the good news here is that she’s back in that peak form. Grade: A-\n\nJuçara Marçal, DEB RMX – On paper, a remix album sounds promising in these postmodern times: the endless recycling of consumption and experience as music is revisited and reinterpreted to find new life in a new context. And, sure enough, there’s some interesting stuff here, but it doesn’t add up to much as an album. Kiko Dinucci’s production unified the tracks on Delta Estácio Blues, where here producers send the music in all kinds of different directions that sounds like a radio station run by a confused programmer. Theoretically, the diversity is interesting, but as a listening experience it agitates more than enlightens no matter how enjoyable many of the parts are. Grade: C\n\nArthur Melo, Mirantes Emocionais – Pandemic over, he works with a band again, which in some ways is a shame. His introspective singing really takes off when accompanied solely by his guitar. But his songwriting remains solid despite the different context. The first track is a mess, but skip it and hear an album nearly as consistent as Adeus. The disco touches—I guess Bala Desejo ignited a pop disco moment there (although some of these moves recall Carne Doce, who were doing it earlier)—are a surprise, but pulled off well enough. It boggles my mind that Sessa’s not bad wallpaper can garner 85,000 monthly listens on that service while Melo’s similar, but much more engaging, tunes can’t break 3,000. Maybe we should change that. Listen here. Grade: B\n\nFabiano do Nascimento and Sam Gendel, The Room – The first and likely not last album of the year from the increasingly prolific guitarist covers familiar ground even in its chosen collaborator, but that’s not a bad thing. The simplicity of the instrumentation lets Nascimento and Gendel shine without burying their playing in goop, and while there’s always an undercurrent of easy listening threatening to pull Nascimento’s music down, here his command of his instrument is so on point that he resists that pull strongly enough. I’m churlish enough to wish that Tiki Pasillas had joined them on percussion to give the music an added kick and maybe lift it to the level of Dança dos Tempos, but when a great guitarist wants to sit back and show off without getting showy, I’m not going to complain. Listen and buy here. Grade B+\n\nTomentosa Tez, JAHZZ – Guitarist/singer Vitor Cozilos Vitor from Fortaleza has released six interesting experimental albums. Here on his seventh he fully connects. Helps that he has some actual songs to play off against. The nod to convention makes the weird noises hit deeper. When the music shifts to waves of sound, a tune pops up to help center things and keep you from nodding off. Spare instrumentation creates a big sense of space, but the distortion reverbing through the arrangements keeps it from feeling empty. The Mateus Fazeno Rock cameo misfires, but everything else is clicks, and the album gains strengths as it goes on, peaking with an Ornette Coleman cover that sounds nothing like the original, which you know Coleman would appreciate. Listen and buy here. Grade: A-\n\nVarious Artists, funk.BR – São Paulo (NTS) – Along with sertanejo, funk is the sound of modern day Brazil. But it’s very much a singles game. So label NTS rounds up some of their favorite stuff from São Paulo in a bid to break international the way reggaeton has. And break it may. With raps blending in with the rhythms, verbal meaning seems irrelevant as dance musics make the language barrier less formidable these days. Beats are universal, right? (No, but that’s a longer discussion.) Unlike so much Brazilian stuff, this compilation has garnered some Anglophone attention. But my, perhaps, unqualified, ears have a hard time hearing exactly why. Soundalike tracks tend to blend together into an indistinguishable rush of beats, squiggles, bleeps and raps. When I concentrate hard, I can hear the appeal, but as music for my day this aggravates more than it excites or challenges my ears. Maybe I’m not on the right drugs or at the right party (caffeine and home alone if you are wondering), but I find my attention wandering or just annoyed even if I can hear how someone might make more of this stuff. Grade: B-\n\nAndré Abujamra, Duzoutruz (Vol. 1) – Musician, comedian, musical comedian, er comedic musician, Abujamra is probably best known for his early work with Os Mulheres Negras (where he partnered with Maurício Pereira) and his film score work. He’s also had a long, wandering solo career. Here he covers some beloved songs while adding his own spins to their sounds, mainly effectively dinky instrumentation (funny without being overbearing) and touches of the Arabic music from his family roots (percussion and bits of drone). Where I know the originals, these versions don’t make me want forget them, but as he ranges over styles and years of Brazilian musics he doesn’t make me want to rush to them either. Listen here. Grade: B\n\nRodrigo Brandão and Sun Ra Arkestra, Outros Espaço – Brandão’s transtition from rapper to spoken word artist threatened to hide his creativity behind the language barrier. But working here with the Sun Ra Arkestra, and many of the usual Brazilian avant suspects, Brandão brews up a potent batch of mind-altering sounds. I suspect credit goes to the Sun Ra Arkestra. Brandão worked with the others on his solo debut, which never left the ground, but this one blasts off. Helps that Brandão embraces the title theme to drench his voice in spacey echo, adding sonic interest to words I don’t understand. (Once again, the usual sources failed to turn up lyrics.) But this one is all mood, flow, odd sounds and textures, and engaging weirdness. Listen here. Grade: B+\n\nCéu, Um Gosto de Sol – I avoided reviewing her for awhile because I didn’t really like her music, so when I finally get around to expressing that dislike, she then turns around and releases a couple of decent albums in 2021. The first remade her earlier songs in acoustic manner. Here she covers other artists. Once again the secret is personality: to my ears she has it now in a way she did not. She’s singing looser and with more warmth. She sounds like she’s having fun. She covers the Beastie Boys from their Brazilian period (a terrific version of “I Don’t Know”). She takes on classics like “Bim Bom” and, um, “Feelings”. So, ok, it’s not a perfect album. Listen here. Grade: B.\n\nThiago França, Bodiado – KD VCS was an accidental pandemic commentary that nailed the sense of isolation in those early months of lockdown. Bodiado is a pandemic product. Recorded at home by himself, it’s actually more spirited than the forlorn KD VCS. Here França explores solitude as play. Recording, overdubbing, cutting, and mixing, he turns himself into a small, convivial party. But it is touched with melancholy because that’s the time we’re in, and as those sonic cocktails unfold one after the other, a sadness seeps into the edges because even a good party can’t escape that these days. Listen and buy here. Grade: B+\n\nBatuqueiros e Sua Gente with Douglas Germano Partido Alto – Partido altos are a samba subgenre that emerged in the early 20th century as modern met tradition. One of the hallmarks of the music is the mixture of choral and solo singing in a call and response manner. The style was given new life in the 1970s among aesthetic (not political!) conservatives who deployed it against the cultural miscegenation of MPB and paved the way for pagoda samba in the 1980s. Here Germano teams with samba band Batuqueiros e Sua Gente for a lively revival that avoids sanctimony or timidity. Less frantic than the terrific Escumalha, Germano and the band serve up fast-paced sambas for dancing, singing and embracing life. I wish I could find the lyrics, which continue Germano’s attack on Brazil’s bad politics, but the music more than compensates for that lack. Listen here. Grade: A-\n\nDon L, Roteiro pra Aīnouz (Vol. 2) – The second part of his reverse semi-autobiographical screenplay from Fortaleza-born, São Paulo-working rapper Don L (a.k.a. Gabriel Linhares da Rocha). Only it’s less about him than his world. The first half of this record bristles with violence, but not the real life crime stories you might expect in hip hop. It’s about politics. The second track, “Vila Rica” (“Rich Village”) recounts resistance against colonizers, only it’s really about Bolsonaro’s Christofascist political movement. Don L knows his enemies: not just Bolsonaro, but the wealthy who pull his strings (“investors of misery”) and the police they deploy against his opponents. The first half of this album imagines and wishes for revolution against those who would return Brazil to its repressive colonial or military past. The album turns more personal toward the end, but that political framing remains the focus of the whole. Of course, all of that is only apparent to me through bad browser translations, so I’m left aching to understand better how the words work. All of which means the music itself is a blessing. With production that’s funky, hard and full of gloriously abrasive sounds, you don’t need to know the words. But when you read those translations along with the music you get a sense of how verbal and instrumental content cohere into something dynamic. Even behind the langauge barrier, this one sounds special. Listen here. Grade: A-\n\nAlessandra Leão, Acesa – Like Romulo Fróes, percussionist/singer Leão is both a professional musician and an amateur scholar/historian, a traditionalist who understands ways of art die if they aren’t made anew for the present. So, while looking backward, she performs in the now and imagines where the musics she loves might go. As on her terrific trio of 2015 EPs, Leão and her collaborator Caê Rolfson dive into modern sounds even as they draw upon older worlds from Brazil’s northeast. Hard regional rhythms combine with synthesizers that harshen the party without ending it. You’ve heard of retrofuturism? How about some futuristic traditionalism? (The album is accompanied by a musically democratic video series where she explores the roots of this music in the lives of Brazilians.) Listen here. Grade: A-\n\nFlora Matos, Flora de Controle – Without much flash, Matos has emerged as one of Brazilian hip hop’s most consistent performers. She hasn’t released a Bluesman or Batuk Freak or Gano Pelo Bang, but she chugs away releasing solid album after solid album. Her latest initially sounds a little bland, the tracks too samey. But as they sink in details emerge—some background percussion or a string of vowels she raps—that color and decorate the songs. Streaming-era brevity (10 tracks in 23 minutes, two of which are remixes) makes it hard for the languid flow to build up much momentum, but maybe that’s the point. Plus, one of those remixes might be the best thing on the album. Listen here. Grade: B\n\nFabiano do Nascimento, Ykytu – You always hear in your biases. Love or hate, it’s hard to get past them. So when Nascimento’s latest kicked off, I was sad he was back into new age territory. But then that picking, those lines, the riffs started pushing through the shiny, tasteful, genteel surface. It’s not just that he has chops; it’s that he knows how to use them. His technical displays make musical sense. Not that the too shiny, too tasteful, too genteel disappeared, but I learned to tolerate it and hear the beauty he was aiming for and gets closer to than my biases want to allow. I’m betting he’ll never equal Dança dos Tempos, but he’s showing enough facility and smarts to be more than a one album wonder. Listen and buy here. Grade: B-\n\nMariá Portugal, Erosão – Jazz? Artsong? Avant-post-samba? Call it what you want. After 20+ years on the Brazilian music scene and playing on some of the best albums of the period, drummer Portugal has earned the right to cross whatever borders she wants. And here she does. Portugal, who completed this album before emigrating to Germany (temporarily?), has played with DonaZica/Iara Rennó, Quartabê, Ava Rocha and Elza Soares where she’s established her bona fides not only as a drummer but as one of the leading musicians reinterpreting Brazilian traditions for the future. This is no sidewoman throwaway project: the drummer gets some because she knows how to give some. The mix of song, jazzy passages and electronic trickery coheres into a difficult, sometimes austere beauty that moves from funky and serene and glitchy effortlessly. Two brief tracks aside, the album’s songs unfold slowly and unpredictably. Where you might expect a drummer to go for straighter, rhythm driven music, Portugal just as often uses percussion to ornament the other instruments as to keep time or drive the music. The pace risks static at time, but Portugal and her collaborators maintain the tension needed to propel things forward. As with her Quartabê bandmates Maria Beraldo and Joana Queiroz, Portugal has made some of her most compelling music here as a solo artist. An album where the strengths keep emerging as you immerse and listen more carefully. Listen here. Buy here. Grade: A\n\nCéu, Acústico – Certified Céu skeptic that I am, I didn’t see much sense in devoting ear time to this rerecording of songs for an acoustic session. Turns out, my problem with her came down to that affectless pose, because when she sings like a human being here, my resistance melted away. By abandoning the ice queen moves, she brings the vocal intimacy these tracks need and, for the first time to my ears, sounds like an artist worthy of attention. Grade: B\n\nÍndio da Cuica, Malandro 5 Estrelas – After 50 years on the Brazilian music scene, the septuagenarian multi-instrumentalist sideman makes a solo debut. Here he sings, plays guitar, cavaquinho, berimbau, and, of course, the cuica, a squeaky drum that’s one of those sounds newcomers to Brazilian music perk up and ask, “What’s that?” With the help of Gabriel de Aquino and Paulinho Bicolor, Cuica gathers ten tracks of rousing samba for a sound that’s classic but not dated. He sings love songs to his wife of 35 years, celebrates Brazilian music and Afro-Brazilian culture. If he’s a five star rascal, as the title says, he seems the playful, not the mean-spirited, kind. Up music for down times. Listen and buy here. Grade: B+\n\nKiko Dinucci, VHS – One-track EP exploring riffs and sounds. Dinucci’s tried similar experiments (Abismu and FILIPINAs), and this is better than those bombs, but he’s not the kind of virtuoso who impresses you with 20 minutes of solo guitar. He’s the kind who brings a group alive with his chunking and coloring and commentary. Try Metá Metá’s Gira if you want him in top experimental form. Listen and buy here. Grade: C\n\nRomulo Fróes, Aquele Nenhum/Ó Nóis – One album, twice presented. The first version is Fróes and solo acoustic guitar singing the songs straight. Second is the same songs turned into noise via samples, etc. The lyrical connection between the two might be obvious if I knew the Portuguese, but as I don’t they seem like two completely different albums with the songs sounding nothing alike. (A different running order doesn’t make comparison easy, either.) Basically it splits his art—making traditional Brazilian songcraft present in world where avant sonics are pop commonplace—in two. Brazil has its fair share of scholar-musicians, people who supplement the day gig with occasional albums, but Fróes is a musician-scholar. He may not formally teach or research, but each album is a investigation into his, and his generation’s, relationship with the legacy of Brazil’s national musics in a globalized world. Here, those explorations are sometimes a bit too academic for their own good. By splitting the construction/deconstruction so sharply, he loses some of the delightful tension that springs his art. “Elza Aqui” is the test case. Compare the single version from 2019, which combines both parts, to the two versions on these album which split them. All are good. But in moving from the first to the later two versions, you can see the master manipulating the strings, which usually remain hidden. Of course complaining he doesn’t equal Barulho Feio–Rei Vadio–O Meu Nome é Qualquer Um is a bit like complaining the Beatles never equaled Rubber Soul–Revolver–Sgt. Pepper’s or Public Enemy It Takes a Nation of Millions–Fear of a Black Planet–Apocalypse ’91. This is still strong music. The songs disc isn’t immediate, but the tunes sink in. The noise disc, ten minutes longer than the songs one despite being the same tracks, is smart enough to sample memorable noises, especially the opening bit from Rei Vadio. The collage even begin to cohere into something approaching a groove. So if the construct/deconstruct duality in these two albums tends to get stuck at merely interesting, it’s genuinely interesting. And it’s merely interesting for a major artist. These discs may not convince the world that I and his too small claque of believers are right that he’s one of the top musicians working in the world today, but they still add to the evidence that he is. (These two stream separately, but conceptually, they are one album, hence one grade. And, as usual, he gives the stuff away for free.) Grade: B+\n\nGraveola, In Silence – Six years since their last one with plenty of solo albums and the departure of founding member Luiz Gabriel Lopes in between, I’d figured they were gone for good. But they jump back in with an EP that returns to their strengths, even if it doesn’t surpass their peaks, with the solid songs and strong arrangements that were their hallmark. Lopes still contributes to this pre-pandemic recording, which gives hope that his departure may not be permanent, because what this modest return to form mainly does is remind that, mostly, they are better off together. Grade: B-\n\nGabriella Lima, Bálsamo – São Paulo singer moves to Paris to stretch herself culturally and artistically for a few months before returning home to start her career. But after settling in perhaps for good, she finally records the album she planned to make when she returned home. Mixing her MPB with plenty of pop and international flourishes and smart enough to front load the beaty stuff so you don’t notice too much as the momentum and quality drop as the album goes along, she’s also wise enough not to wear out her ideas with nine songs coming in well under four minutes each. The 27-minute running time doesn’t hurt either. Fun and done. See, streaming isn’t all bad for for albums. Grade: B\n\nMãeana, Mãeana (2015) and Mãeana2 – Ana Cláudia Lomelino Gonçalves, the former lead singer of Tono and daughter-in-law of Gilberto Gil, debuted as a solo artist with a collection of unrecorded Caetano Veloso and Adriana Calcanhotto songs. But she still managed to imprint her personality on the songs. Her cool, but not affectless, vocals drift across dreamy, but not lazy, arrangements, and of course those songwriters help her avoid generic. For her sophomore studio album, she teamed with husband Bem Gil. The songs, from various sources, aren’t as striking as on the debut, but Mãeana is in strong form as she explores motherhood—that’s her and Gil’s kids on the cover—and womanhood. More mystical than dreamy, she puts over the straighter songs with a subtle, warm directness that belies the cool tones. Grades: Mãeana, B; Mãeana2, B\n\nMarisa Monte, Portas – Although Monte’s first solo album in ten years leads with a couple of weaker tracks, it’s just another example of one of the most gifted musicians in the world doing what she has for 30 years with enough variation to make you enjoy the new iteration. Her performing persona, undiminished voice and melodic preferences are so strong and, despite the camouflage her subtlety provides, sui generis, that it’s undeniably her from the opening notes. You could complain about the lack of ambition if you wished, and it’s definitely not the best album to start with her. But listen to “Déjà Vu” or “Medo do Perigo” or “Praia Vermelha” or “Elegante Amanhecer” and you may wonder if you need to get to those better albums so quickly after all. Grade: A-\n\nIara Rennó, Pra te Abraçar – From the most difficult album of her career to the easiest, Rennó goes unusually quiet and straight for this pandemic inspired project. Pra te Abraçar, which translates “to hug you” and is subtitled Canções Isolamento (isolation songs), is both six roughly 15 minute video concerts with Rennó solo or accompanied (sometimes in person, sometimes virtually) over 30 tracks and a 12-song album that culls from the video sessions without distilling them. The album is fine, and a big improvement over the previous release. But it leaves out several of the stronger songs and lacks the visual interactions that enliven this music. The video performances are terrific. Brazilian campfire music as my friend Blair put it. Yet despite the relative quiet, they capture Rennó’s scorching charisma superbly. Rennó strums her guitar and sings with the assuredness that comes from 25 years of performing professionally as she welcomes fellow musicians to make a community amidst the Covid isolation. She sings about love and touch and nature and all the things that make life good even in the midst of the horrors of the past year and a half. Tops are the performances with her mom, Alzira E. There’s something really sweet about two generations of notable artists making good music together. For Anglophones, she sends out a message from her Covid-ravaged country: “Wash your hands, wash your hands, use your mask, be brave/Wash your hands, wash your hands, stay home, be safe.” Simple, even simplistic words. No doubt they’d sound silly if you hadn’t been there. But in a world where we haven’t been honest about the biological and psychological consequences of the still ongoing pandemic, it’s a rallying cry against populists putting economics ahead of human lives. Grades: album, B; video series (here), A-\n\nQuarantine, voluntary or otherwise, offers a time to find new adventures in confined spaces. I offered some suggestions on exploring Brazilian music through classic albums here, but this blog is mainly devoted to newer stuff, so of course I’m going to make suggestions there, too. Where the classic albums were pretty obvious, this list is more idiosyncratic because current music isn’t canonical (yet), plus I actually know it better than the classic stuff and feel freer to range off the beaten path. That I limited it to only three Clube da Encruza related albums is a testament to my willpower. So ten current albums in historical order (and, yes, I really should have a Sepultura album, but I don’t know them well enough to pick):\n\nSuba, São Paulo Confessions (1999) – Mitar Subotic was Serbian ex-pat who became a producing phenom in Brazil where he merged his adopted homeland’s musics with international dance trends. Those dance music trends sound somewhat dated here on his final album, but it’s still an intoxicating mix of old and new, as well as a harbinger of the international community rediscovering Brazilian music this millennium. Tragically he died a few days after the release of this album when his studio caught fire and he tried to rescue recordings before they were destroyed. If you like try: Bebel Gilberto, Tanto Tempo; Smoke City, Flying Away, Céu, Céu.\n\nTribalistas, Tribalistas (2002)– The rare supergroup that works, Tribalistas brought together the talents of Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes. As wonderful as the last two are, the real star is Monte, who might be the finest Brazilian musician since the country’s ’60s/’70s heyday. Light and playful in the best Brazilian tradition, strong melodies are swept along by mellifluous percussion that grounds music that threatens to float away. At the center is Monte’s clear, seductive voice oozing smarts and warmth. Tops is “Já Sei Namorar”, which is in the competition for the best song of the ’00s. As in worldwide, not just Brazil. If you like try: Tribalistas, Tribalistas (2017); Marisa Monte, Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor de Rosa e Carvão (called Rose and Charcoal in English-language markets), Marisa Monte, Barulhinho Bom.\n\nDonaZica, Composição (2003) – Formed by Anelis Assumpção (daughter of Itamar), Iara Rennó (daughter of Carlos Rennó and Alzira Espíndola) and Andreia Dias (daughter of overly strict evangelical Christians), DonaZica was an all too brief blazing glory of Brazilian music. Their debut is a riot of pleasure, confidence and fun, with dense, ear-tickling arrangements and playful, tag-team vocals as they decorate samba with all kinds of modern touches. All three women went on to notable solo careers, while many of the instrumentalists—notably guitarist Gustavo Ruiz in his work with his sister Tulipa—made a mark, too. One of the best four or five Brazilian albums I’ve heard this millennium. If you like try: Iara Rennó, Macunaíma Ópera Tupi; Anelis Assumpção, Taurina.\n\nKarol Conká, Batuk Freak (2013) – As with rock music, hip hop was not a natural graft onto Brazilian styles, but a culture as deeply musical as Brazil did figure out how to cannibalize it for domestic use. Frenetic and funky, Nave’s production provides an ideal environment for Conká’s charismatic rapping. His harsh samples and sounds create the kind of deep dive your ears can get lost in as hooks, bleeps and blaps are pushed to the point of annoyance without actually getting there. Yet the dazzling production never overwhelms Conká, who remains the star. If you like try: Lurdez da Luz, Gano Pelo Bang; Black Alien, O Ano do Macaco – Babylon by Gus, Vol. 1.\n\nElza Soares, A Mulher do Fim do Mundo (2015) – A famed MPB singer with a made-for-dramatization biography, Soares had basically been retired for a decade before the then-septuagenarian made this shocking, brilliant comeback album. Teaming with São Paulo’s Clube da Encruza collective (see the next two entries), she released this striking avant-samba album unlike anything in her more commercially friendly catalog. Combining punky metallic guitar with carnival rhythms run through a blender, the music abrades and cleanses, while Soares’ voice, its technical virtuosity worn down by age, gasps, yelps and groans with life. If you like try: Elza Soares, Deus é Mulher; Juçara Marçal, Encarnado.\n\nRomulo Fróes, Rei Vadio: A Canções de Nelson Cavaquinho (2016) – Connecting past with present is how a tradition stays alive, and tribute albums are a key way Brazilian musicians both honor the past while not being trapped by it. But few of such albums both honor and reinvent with the chutzpah of this triumph. Fróes, as one of the leaders of the Clube da Encruza collective, had been revitalizing samba for more than a decade. Like his compatriots, he loved Brazil’s traditions, but knew the world had changed. No gentle, lounge-worthy performances for him. Samba was music of the poor, the dispossessed, the street. Samba was a means of transgression as surely as the odd sounds of free jazz or punk guitar distortions that he tinged his music with. Back-to-back Fróes’ versions with Cavaquinho’s and the genius of both shines through. Fróes doesn’t just cover them, but deconstructs and reworks to show their continued vitality. A monumental record, as daring and successful as anything I put on that classic album list. If you like try: Romulo Fróes, Barulho Feio; Romulo Fróes & César Lacerda, O Meu Nome É Qualquer Um; Rodrigo Campos, Bahia Fantástica.\n\nMetá Metá, MM3 (2016) – Kiko Dinucci, Thiago França and Juçara Marçal, with crucial support from Marcelo Cabral and Sérgio Machado, work up some of the finest racket in Brazilian music. Dinucci’s punk-metal samba guitar, França’s wailing sax, Marçal’s moaning roar atop Cabral’s and Machado’s rumbling rhythms steamrolls the listener. Over three superb albums, a solid live set and a pretty damn good dance score, Metá Metá has carved out a path combining rock energy with samba and Afro-Brazilian styles that has little parallel (or at least successful parallel) in Brazilian music. Where so much manguebit was stiff and conservative, Metá Metá is fluid and dynamic. On their most adventurous album, Dinucci paints the background with waves of distorted riffs while França and Marçal hold center stage and the rhythm section propels everything along. If you like try: Metá Metá, Metá Metá; Metá Metá, Metal Metal; Kiko Dinucci, Cortes Curtos; Passo Torto, Thiago França.\n\nCarne Doce, Tônus (2018) – Brazil has certainly figured out rock better than America figured out samba, but that doesn’t mean the country’s musical culture has produced much that rivals the anglophone world’s output. Much Brazilian rock that I’ve heard tends to fall into the competent more than the inspired, but Goiânia’s Carne Doce is a definite exception. Drawing upon classic rock’s chops approach, the band works up a ferocious if smartly subtle virtuosity that shows off their instrumental prowess without ignoring the songs. Indeed, over three albums, the songwriting just gets better as the chops are even more smartly deployed to get the tunes across. As they get quieter with each album, their music smolders more, and vocalist Salma Jô matures into a pretty ace singer. While sounding nothing like them, the band reminds me of classic Fleetwood Mac in their ability to mix instrumental dexterity with quality songwriting. If you like try: Carne Doce, Princesa.\n\nDona Onete, Flor da Lua (2018) – Upon retirement from an academic career, Onete pursued her first love—singing—that her first husband had forbidden her from taking up. A regular gig at a local club turned into a recording deal, in which the septuagenarian adapted regional carimbó styles (from Northern Brazil) by spicing up the normally staid lyrics with love and lust. This live set draws from her first two albums and lets her soak up the adoration of an enthusiastic crowd as a crack band livens up the already lively arrangements. She’s having a blast. You will, too. If you like, try: Feitiço Caboclo, Banzeiro.\n\nBaco Exu do Blues, Bluesman (2018) – This Bahian rapper emerged seemingly from nowhere—he had been around a few years—to produce the titanic Esú only to follow it up a year later with this even better album. Baco is one of the few Brazilian artists where not knowing Portuguese really frustrates, because even with lousy browser translation, his brilliance shines through as he wrestles with black identity in a nation whose racist legacy rivals the United States. But even as the full impact of the words evade, the music, developed with a host of producers, gets across, and his volcanic flow—explosive and liquid—pours out emotion that can’t be trapped behind a language barrier. Drawing deeply on Brazilian musics, he fashions a hip hop that sounds of its place rather than an import from abroad. If you like try: Baco Exu do Blues, Esú; Baco Exu do Blues, Não tem Bacanal na Quarentena; Leo Gandelman ft. Baco Exu do Blues, Hip Hop Machine #6."
