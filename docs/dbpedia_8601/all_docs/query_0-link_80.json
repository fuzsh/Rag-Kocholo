He is also a wonderful percussionist and has won the hearts of many by combining various genres, such as reggae, R&B, funk, soul music, and Latin music, to produce his songs.\n\nBackground & Early Career\n\nHe learned several percussion instruments in his childhood, and as a teenager, he began collaborating with other musicians. In the 1980s, he worked with various prominent musicians, including Joao Gilberto, Luis Caldas, Djavan, and Caetano Veloso.\n\nBands & Solo Career\n\nIn the 1980s, he began to teach his hometown people basic percussion arrangements and patterns.
