        "text": "In Explore ðŸŒŸ\n\nPreston North End FC\n\nLast night I was at Preston North End FCâ€™s stadium to watch Burnley.\n\nIâ€™ve got to say that there was a magnificent tributeâ€¦Firstly with a one minute silence for the Queen, which was very moving; then the British opera singer, Russell Watson, sang â€˜God save the Kingâ€™, The crowd joined in.\n\nAgain, it was very moving.\n\nThere was also a 1 minute applause during the game for a 19yo PNE fan, Alex Tyson, that recently lost his life.\n\nWe dominated the game, but just came away with a point, after the 1-1 draw.\n\n5,500 Clarets made the journey for this derby game.\n\n#RIPQueenElizabethII\n\n#GodsavetheKing\n\n#UTC\n\nLeaving Gate 9, the nearest train station is the Autodromo Station (CPTM Line 9 - Esmeralda).\n\nThe station was built by CPTM to attend the Autodromo de Interlagos and its surroundings. Inaugurated on October 17, 2007, the station was the first to have integrated administration between CPTM and Metro. It is also the first to be delivered as part of the plan to transform the lines of the CPTM into surface subway, which consists of less waiting time on the platform and more comfort in the compositions, among other aspects.\n\nThe Autodromo Station is also close to the Pinheiros River Cycleway Entrance, with access to the Vitorino Goulart da Silva Bridge.\n\n21:00 - 22:45\n\nWaiting for them. They are not late. Five minutes to go.\n\nArctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Matt Helders (drums, vocals), Jamie Cook (guitar, keyboards) and Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.\n\nThey have released six studio albums: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009), Suck It and See (2011), AM (2013), and Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018), as well as one live album, At the Apollo (2008). Their debut album is the fastest-selling debut album by a band in UK chart history, and in 2013, Rolling Stone ranked it the 30th-greatest debut album.\n\nThe band has won seven Brit Awards â€“ winning both Best British Group and Best British Album three times, and have been nominated for five Grammy Awards. They also won the Mercury Prize in 2006 for their debut album, in addition to receiving nominations in 2007, 2013 and 2018. The band have headlined at the Glastonbury Festival twice, in 2007 and again in 2013.\n\nArctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed.\n\nThis is Luc at 19. Every year on the day before their birthdays I make a portait of my boys. Luc turns 19 today. This year's portrait is a little surreal with colour. Because the past year has felt a little surreal. It seems a little surreal to Tracy and I that our little blond headed baby is now legally an adult. We've been seeing him mature both physically and mentally over the last year as his adolescent behaviours fade and the adult has been slowly emerging. Luc has faced some challenges as well this year. He's done so bravely and has managed to control and overcome some of his fears. Emotionally he's opening up to us a little more... learning that it is OK to be vulnerable. We are proud of the steps he has taken, hopeful for his future, despite that the worry and the wonder we felt on the day he was born have never faded. Happy birthday son, and welcome to adulthood.\n\nOptical snoot on White Lightning Ultra 600 up and camera right with an orange gel and framing shutters to get the shape just right on his face.

He's also co-founder of \"On the tip of the toes\", a fund raising organization who's mission is to \"change the lives of young people aged 14 to 39 who are living with cancer by offering them an opportunity to participate in a therapeutic adventure expedition\".\n\nIn 2018, Mario climbed Mount Everest to plant a photo of is 19yo daughter, killer in a tragic accident a few years before. He also climbed several other summits around the world in preparation for that ultimate climb.\n\nI had the opportunity to cycle with him over 109km (68 miles) last Friday, and what a charming personality!\n\nI took this portrait during the evening dinner, after our ride.\n\nSigma 56mm 1.4 (on Fuji X-E4)\n\nSame-sex marriage in Brazil has been legal since 16 May 2013, following a National Justice Council decision, which orders notaries of every state to perform same-sex marriages.\n\nSame-sex unions had already been legally recognized since 2004. Following a ruling of the Supreme Court of Brazil, so-called stable unions (Portuguese: uniÃ£o estÃ¡vel) had been available for same-sex couples since May 2011. These unions were granted most of the rights of marriages, including adoption, welfare benefits, pension, inheritance tax, income tax, social security, health benefits, immigration, joint property ownership, hospital and prison visitation, IVF and surrogacy. This decision paved the way for future legislation on same-sex matrimonial rights. Before the nationwide legislation, the states of Alagoas, Bahia, CearÃ¡, EspÃ­rito Santo, the Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, ParaÃ­ba, ParanÃ¡, PiauÃ­, RondÃ´nia, Santa Catarina, SÃ£o Paulo, and Sergipe, as well as the city of Santa Rita do SapucaÃ­ (MG), had already allowed same-sex marriages and several unions were converted into full marriages by state judges. In Rio de Janeiro, same-sex couples could also marry but only if local judges agreed with their request.\n\nAccording to Ibope, support for same-sex couples having the same rights as different-sex couples in Brazil in 2017 was 49%, with 38% opposing. Support was higher among women, young people, people with higher educational levels and Brazilians living in the South region of the country.\n\nThe 2017 AmericasBarometer showed that 52% of Brazilians supported same-sex marriage.\n\n***\n\nSame-sex marriage (also known as gay marriage or marriage equality) is the marriage of two persons of the same sex or gender, entered into in a civil or religious ceremony.\n\nAs of 2 April 2019, same-sex marriage is legally performed and recognized (nationwide or in some jurisdictions) in:\n\nLegal status of same-sex unions:\n\nPerformed\n\nArgentina\n\nAustralia\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nBrazil\n\nCanada\n\nColombia\n\nCosta Rica*\n\nDenmark\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nIceland\n\nIreland\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nMexico*\n\nNetherlands*\n\nNew Zealand*\n\nNorway\n\nPortugal\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nTaiwan*\n\nUnited Kingdom*\n\nUnited States*\n\nUruguay\n\nRecognized\n\nArmenia*\n\nEstonia\n\nIsrael\n\nAlmost 80,000 people.\n\n31ÂºC (fall).\n\nSam Smith transforms Lolla into a romantic karaoke with a show more at ease than the first coming I attended at the Rock in Rio festival.\n\nThe audiences of the music festivals in Brazil are enormous.\n\nThis is for 80,000 people a day at the car racetrack (Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix).\n\nHe got the audience singing dramatic ballads like 'I'm Not the Only One', 'Stay With Me' and 'Too Good at Goodbyes'.\n\n\"The audiences in Brazil are the best in the world.Thank you all. I'll be back whenever you want me,\" he warns, still in the beginning.\n\nClose to the railing.\n\nThe thrill of seeing an idol a few feet away takes effort and dedication. You have to get there early, give yourself to the toilet and eat the bite. \"It's good to come here when you're a small person, you can not see well from far away, but nothing replaces that proximity, the sound is better, the only problem is when you have a crane in front of you, but this year, fortunately they took away.\"\n\nTribalists have a huge presentation at Lollapalooza.\n\nTribalistas give the impression of having the most fervent fans of the festival.\n\n***\n\nAlbum: Velha InfÃ¢ncia\n\nComposers: Marisa Monte E Arnaldo Antunes\n\nyou are like this,\n\na dream for me,\n\nand when i don't see you.\n\ni think of you,\n\nfrom sunrise,\n\nuntil i lay my head.\n\ni like you.\n\ni like to stay with you..\n\nmy laughter is so happy with you.\n\nmy best friend is my love.\n\nand we sing,\n\nand we dance\n\nand we never tire.\n\nof being kids,\n\nwe play,\n\nin our old childhood.\n\nyour eyes are my bright light.\n\nthey guide me within the darkness.\n\nyour feet open my path.\n\ni follow them and never feel alone.\n\nyou are like this,\n\na dream for me,\n\ni want to fill you with kisses.\n\ni think of you,\n\nfrom the sunrise,\n\ntill i lay my head.\n\ni like you\n\ni like to stay with you\n\nmy laughter is so happy with you\n\nmy best friend is my love\n\nwe sing,\n\nwe dance,\n\nand we never tire.\n\nof being kids,\n\nwe play\n\nin our old childhood.\n\nyour eyes are my bright light,\n\nthey guide me within the darkness.\n\nyour feet open my path.\n\ni follow them and never feel alone.\n\nyou are like this,a dream for me,you are like this.\n\nyou are like this,a dream for me,you are like this\n\nI took this photo in November 1971 in Frankfurt Bahnhof. I had just arrived and would be stationed in Germany for the next 15 months, I think the camera I took picture with was a 35mm Konica (hard to remember) A few months later I bought a Pentax Spotomatic which had great glass (all those old lenses were good I think)\n\nI havn't found the negative to this photo so I photographed the 42 year old print with my Sony RX100 using a tripod and self timer and natural light filtered . The print is faded and some of the glossy shows. I'll try looking for negative again, as I like the history of the photograph...You can see the old trains on the right. They were dull green in color at that time..US soldiers are in the Bahnhof on the left. One is standing, the other sitting. I think the soldier in the center is a German soldier, but it is hard to tell from the print...\n\nI think I was only in Germany a day or two when I took this shot. At 19yo I was awestruck by the sights and sounds of a beautiful foreign country.\n\n.I did some post work: toned down the brightness, and tweaked the contrast and added a sepia filter to represent that time period better..(.I'll try to find the negative, or take a better picture of the 42 year old print ).. Hope you like the history of the picture...The 15 months I served there in our Army was a great experience for me."
