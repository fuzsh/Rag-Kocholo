        "text": "The Royal Medal of the Lion is not connected with the Order of the Lion. The Medal is bestowed at the discretion of hih Prince Ermias Sahle-Selassie and is for loyal and faithful service to his person. As a result, the medal is not within the gift of the Crown Council, but rather is a decoration awarded by Prince Ermias personally. His authority to issue medals stems from his function as de facto guardian of the Crown (President of the Crown Council).The medal is bestowed on individuals of any nationality, sex or religion.\n\nThe Medal is of polished silver in the traditional circular style, 35mm in diameter, and depicts on the obverse the Imperial Lion surmounted by the first letter of Prince Ermias’ name in Amharic, and above that the Prince’s Crown. The legend “For Faithful and Good Service” appears in Ge‘ez around the top of the design, and the word “Ethiopia” in Amharic at the base.\n\nThe riband, suspended from a horizontal bar affixed atop the medal, is predominantly black with borders in the Ethiopian tricolour, arranged, from the outside, in red, green and yellow bands.\n\nRecipients may use the post-nominal initials RML."
