        "text": "Anders founded the Ågrenska Centre in Gothenburg over 20 years ago, and was a pioneer in empowering children, teenagers and adults with rare diseases and disabilities by providing unique programs to support them and their families. The values and spirit of the work of the Centre is also reflected in EPF’s development as an organisation and in December EPF held a major conference in Agrenska on patient involvement under the patronage of the EU Swedish Presidency.\n\nAnders also started Eesti Ågrenska, an Estonian counterpart to the Swedish Ågrenska. He is a board member of EURORDIS, an umbrella representative organisation focusing on rare diseases and also sits on the Social Welfare Board Advisory Council, Board of Directors for Disability Research in western Sweden, and the reference group for Parents Empowerment.\n\nUpon acceptance of his award, Anders said “it is with tremendous honour that I accept this award. This medal symbolizes my true commitment to the field of disability and patients”."
