        "text": "The Royal Rangers program utilizes a variety of awards and insignia to represent the various accomplishments of leaders and boys in the program. Some awards may be earned by both leaders and boys, while others may only be earned by one or the other. Each award carries specific requirements and is displayed in a specific manner on the uniform or awards vest. The information below provides details on the types of awards available in Royal Rangers and the manner in which each is used in the program.\n\nAll awards used in Royal Rangers may be classified into one of the following five categories: Advancement Awards, Service Awards, Honorary Awards, Training Awards, and Special Awards.\n\nAdvancement Awards\n\nAdvancement Awards recognize boys for their accomplishments achieved through the Royal Rangers advancement system. Each age group features a unique system of requirements & recognition referred to as an advancement trail. Boys are recognized for meeting certain requirements by receiving awards representing a series of advancement steps. All advancement steps are represented by a patch worn on the awards vest or on the right sleeve of the uniform. Advancement steps representing annual milestone accomplishments are also represented by a medal, ribbon, and neck medallion.\n\nThe award insignia for most advancement awards may be ordered directly from our online store.
