        "text": "Renowned astrophysicist and cosmologist, Martin Rees (Lord Rees of Ludlow, OM Kt HonFREng FRS), has been named this year’s recipient of the world’s oldest and most prestigious scientific award.\n\nThe Royal Society’s Copley Medal, awarded for sustained, outstanding achievements in any field of science, was first awarded in 1731. Previous recipients have included Louis Pasteur, Dorothy Hodgkin, Albert Einstein, and Charles Darwin.\n\nLord Rees, a Fellow and former President of the Royal Society, and the UK’s current Astronomer Royal, is one of the most distinguished theoretical astrophysicists of his generation and was chosen for his many and varied conceptual breakthroughs over several decades, with influence spreading far beyond the specialist academic community.\n\nAccepting the Medal, Lord Rees, who has authored or co-authored more than 500 research papers and 11 books, said: “It is of course deeply gratifying to have my lifetime efforts recognised by award of the Copley medal.\n\n“But I’ve had enough experience of prize juries to realise the substantial arbitrariness and luck in all such awards! I've been especially fortunate to have injected fruitful ideas into the interpretation of new data in several areas of astronomy, and to have collaborated with many colleagues at different phases of my career. I would acknowledge especially (in alphabetical order), Mitch Begelman, Roger Blandford, Andy Fabian, Peter Meszaros, and Simon White.”\n\nLord Rees’ contributions have led to significant advances in domains ranging from galaxy formation to cosmic jets, black holes, gamma ray bursts as well as more speculative aspects of cosmology – in particular, whether we live in a multiverse – and the prospect of detecting extra-terrestrial life.\n\nHe is among 25 2023 Royal Society Medal and Award winners. Others include Sir Patrick Vallance KCB FMedSci FRS and Professor Sir Christopher John MacRae Whitty KCB FMedSci FRS who jointly receive the Royal Medal (Applied) for their pivotal role in ensuring that the UK’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic benefited from the best science and evidence, Professor Hagan Bayley FRS from the University of Oxford who receives the Buchanan Medal for founding the hugely successful company, Oxford Nanopore Technology, and Professor Catherine Noakes OBE FREng who receives the Gabor Medal for her pioneering contributions to infection risk modelling and her exceptional leadership in the field through groundbreaking research and a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nThis year’s Africa Prize is awarded to Professor Kelly Chibale, from the University of Cape Town, for exceptional leadership and groundbreaking work in drug discovery for African endemic diseases. The Rising Star Africa Prize is awarded to Dr Wade Petersen, also from the University of Cape Town, for his research into new methods for the construction of molecules relevant to drug discovery using visible light as a source of energy.\n\nSir Adrian Smith, President of the Royal Society said, “On behalf of the Royal Society, I offer my congratulations to all the 2023 recipients of Medals and Awards. The breadth and scope of scientific knowledge and experience reflected in this year’s nominations is nothing short of phenomenal. I am very proud to celebrate such outstanding scientific contributions from so many different specialisms around the world.”\n\nThe full list of 2023 winners\n\nPremier Awards\n\nCopley Medal\n\nThe Lord Rees of Ludlow OM Kt HonFREng FRS, University of Cambridge for being arguably the most distinguished theoretical astrophysicist of his generation, responsible for numerous and varied conceptual breakthroughs, with influence spreading far beyond the specialist academic community.\n\nBakerian Medal and Lecture\n\nProfessor Michele Dougherty CBE FRS, Imperial College London for her scientific
