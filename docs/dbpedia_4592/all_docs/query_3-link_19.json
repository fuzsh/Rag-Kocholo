        "text": "Sir John Cadogan, former president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, today received the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Royal Medal from HRH Prince Philip at a ceremony at the society's home in the Scottish capital.\n\nThe Royal Society of Edinburgh is Scotland's national academy of science and letters. The society's Royal Medals have been awarded annually since their institution by the Queen in 2000, to individuals who have achieved distinction in categories including the life sciences and business. Sir John Cadogan was awarded his medal for \"his outstanding contribution to organic chemistry.\"\n\nThe former president was born in Pembrey, Carmarthenshire. His speciality being organic chemistry, he did his first research at King's College London under Donald Hey.\n\nHe spent a significant proportion of his academic career in Scotland, as Purdie Professor of Chemistry at the University of St Andrews and Forbes Professor at the University of Edinburgh. He was later appointed Chief Scientist at the BP Research Centre and then Director of Research at BP. He held this position for 11 years from 1981 to 1992, during which time he oversaw the growth of investment in research from $60 million to $400 million, with a return of billions to shareholders.\n\nSir John was president of the Royal Society of Chemistry from 1982 to 1984. He has received the society's Meldola and Corday Morgan Medals and was awarded the Lord Lewis Prize in 2010.\n\nHe has also been Director General of the UK Research Councils and is a Founding Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales, of which he is currently its inaugural president."
