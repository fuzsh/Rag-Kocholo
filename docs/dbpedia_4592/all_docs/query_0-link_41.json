Dr. Schuster was the recipient of the Chancellor's Award, University System of Georgia–1998; the American Chemical Society A C. Cope Scholar Award, Paul Flory-IBM Fellowship, and the ACS Herty Medal. Dr. Schuster's research interests include oxidative damage to DNA. The loss of an electron (oxidation) of duplex DNA results in the formation of a nucleobase radical cation (electron “hole”) that is subsequently consumed in chemical reactions that often lead to mutations. We have found that nucleobase damage need not occur at the site of the initial oxidation. Radical cations in DNA can migrate long distances (hundreds of Å) by a reversible hopping process before being trapped irreversibly by reaction with H2O and O2. A defining characteristic of this process is the preferential reaction at guanine. We showed that the reactions of nucleobase radical cations in DNA are determined by the specific sequence of bases that comprise the oligonucleotides. In particular, Dr. Schuster's team observes that under certain circumstances oxidative reactions occurs at thymines despite the fact that it has a high oxidation potential. The consequences and mechanism of this reaction are under active investigation.\n\nDr. Bassam Shakhashiri is the first holder of the William T.

Dr. Mills has been an author or coauthor on more than 90 papers in professional journals on drug design, synthetic organic chemistry and the biology of medicinally active substances. He has been an inventor or coinventor on eighty U.S. patents covering an array of drug candidates and synthetic methods. He is a member of the Organic Chemistry and Medicinal Chemistry Sections of the American Chemical Society, AAAS and Sigma Xi.\n\nDr. Jennifer Schomaker is an Assistant Professor within the Chemistry Department at The University of Wisconsin. Research in the Schomaker group is driven by the need for more efficient methods to transform simple hydrocarbons into more complex building blocks for synthesis. Our program will encompass new catalyst development and optimization, elucidation of reaction mechanisms and applications of new methodologies to the synthesis of natural products and other useful molecules. Particular emphasis will be placed on the design of catalysts that can utilize inexpensive greenhouse gases for useful organic transformations. The potential applications of our new catalysts to industrially important transformations will also be explored. Projects in our group are designed to offer students the ability to gain skills that will serve them well throughout their scientific careers, whether in an academic, government or industrial setting. These include standard techniques for the synthesis of organic and organometallic compounds, the handling and manipulation of air-sensitive materials, mechanistic and kinetic studies, advanced NMR techniques, basic computational chemistry, total synthesis and training in scientific writing and presentation skills.\n\nDr. Siddhartha Shenoy is a Senior Research Chemist at DuPont Central Research and Development. He received his B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Virginia in 2001. He then moved to California to work on his Ph.D. under the direction of Professor Keith Woerpel at the University of California, Irvine. Dr. Shenoy's graduate work was focused in the areas of synthetic methodology development and physical organic chemistry, namely in the mechanistic study of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity in the reactions of heteroatom-stabilized carbocations. Upon completion of his Ph.D. in 2006, Dr. Shenoy joined the laboratory of Professor Julius Rebek as a Skaggs Postdoctoral Associate at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. During his time in the Rebek group, Dr. Shenoy developed a novel organocatalytic system that mimicked the function of terpene cyclase enzymes. Dr. Shenoy joined DuPont Central Research and Development in 2008.\n\nDr. David Tellers received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from Professor Robert G. Bergman at U.C. Berkeley in 2001 and subsequently joined Merck where he has had the opportunity to support programs across the pharmaceutical development paradigm, from initial discovery to commercial launch. He started at Merck in the Chemical Engineering Department and focused on the optimization of organic reactions through kinetic analysis. He then transitioned to Process Research where he assisted in the creation of a chemocatalysis group and worked on synthetic route development for clinical candidates. He is currently a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry where he is working on the development of oligonucleotide therapeutics.\n\nDr. Samuel Thomas is currently an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at Tufts University. He received his B.S. (2000) from the University of Rochester, and his PhD (2006) from MIT. Dr. Thomas was an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellow (Harvard University) from 2006-2009. The Thomas lab takes an interdisciplinary approach to design and synthesis of organic materials. They combine synthesis, physical organic chemistry, photophysics, and electrostatics. Research includes (1) Electrostatically responsive materials that undergo a change in properties upon exposure to a stimulus such as changing the sign of charge upon contact electrification. Since a consistent theory that predicts how a material will charge upon contact with another material does not exist, they are developing rules to guide the design of materials for next-generation antistatic materials, label-free chemical detection, and chemically- or photochemically-triggered electrostatic actuators. (2) Development of conjugated materials that are highly amplifying optical sensing materials where mobile excited states can transfer their energy (or be quenched) by electron, hole, or energy acceptors throughout the polymer backbone. The output for sensing applications of these materials is either fluorescence quenching or energy transfer, both of which have large background signal. The Thomas group is designing “materials amplification” from mobile excitons with dark-field sensing by using small amounts of reactive quenching traps and prequenched materials that radiate by coupling to plasmons upon binding. (3) Development of multifunctional polymers that bear ligands that bind specifically to targeted surfaces and thus serve as inhibitors with larger binding constants than their monomeric counterparts. Their research focuses on polymers that combine ligands for binding selectively to a surface with other useful functions and also take advantage of recent developments in controlled polymerization techniques to exert greater control over the distribution of functional moieties. Applications of such materials includes singlet oxygen photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy and thermally responsive materials for selective precipitation.\n\nDr. Holden Thorp has been an undergraduate student, a chemistry professor, a planetarium director, an inventor and entrepreneur, as well as a dean, at Carolina. He graduated with honors, won teaching awards, chaired a powerhouse chemistry department, developed technology for electronic DNA chips, founded spin-off companies, and succeeded as an administrator. As the 10th chancellor, Dr. Thorp draws from those experiences in leading Carolina, one of the world's great research universities. A North Carolina native, Dr. Thorp grew up in Fayetteville in a family steeped in UNC traditions dating to the 1800s. When he graduated from Terry Sanford High School, only one college was on his application list — Carolina, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in 1986. Attending a world-class research university—where research and teaching are done by the same people—allowed him to work in chemistry labs with top faculty and inspired him to become a professor. He pursued that dream at the California Institute of Technology, where he earned a doctorate in chemistry in 1989, and at Yale University for postgraduate work. After teaching a year at NC State, he returned in 1993 to UNC, where he was dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and chair of the chemistry department before becoming chancellor in 2008. Dr. Thorp is a member of President Obama's National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. As a result, the University hosted the council's first national forum in Chapel Hill. He coauthored “Engines of Innovation—The Entrepreneurial University in the 21st Century,” a UNC Press book that makes the case for the pivotal role of research universities as agents of societal change. Royalties support innovation at UNC. Dr. Thorp serves on the U.S. Manufacturing Competitiveness Initiative for the Council on Competitiveness. He has published 130 scholarly articles on the electronic properties of DNA and RNA and cofounded Viamet Pharmaceutials in Morrisville, which is developing drugs for fungal infections and prostate cancer. The chancellor also is a member of a national Commission on Higher Education Attainment, which was created by the six presidentially based higher education associations to chart a course for greatly improving college retention and attainment and, in turn, restore the nation's higher education preeminence.\n\nDr. Jake Yeston joined the staff at Science in 2004, where he is now a senior editor, handling peer review for original research manuscripts submitted in chemistry and overlapping segments of applied physics and biochemistry. He earned an AB in chemistry from Harvard University in 1996 and a PhD in chemistry from the University of California-Berkeley in 2001, working jointly under Bob Bergman and Brad Moore on flash kinetics studies of transition metal carbonyl reactions, followed by post-doctoral research in ultrafast infrared spectroscopy at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics (Garching, Germany) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD)."
