Serving politicians are ineligible for the award.â\n\nIt was first awarded in 1900 to Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan USN, arguably the maritime equivalent of Clausewitz, and has been awardedÂ thirty-four times since, including to Winston Churchill in 1950, Baroness Thatcher in 2000 and Henry Kissinger in 2015."
