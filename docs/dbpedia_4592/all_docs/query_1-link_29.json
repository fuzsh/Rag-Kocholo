        "text": "2023George ApostolopoulosProfessor George Apostolopoulos from National Technical University of Athens-Greece is receiving the Honorary Membership Award in recognition for his outstanding, life-long support to the EAGE and the geoscience community. His\n\ntechnical contributions to the field of exploration and engineering geophysics are numerous and comprise the analysis of hundreds of geophysical datasets collected mostly in the Mediterranean area for a variety of relevant projects. Dr. Apostolopoulos has also mentored numerous highly skilled young professionals in industry, academia, and government. He is extremely active in scientific and professional societies and is a recognized pillar of the Balkan Geophysical Society and of the NSG Division of EAGE, which he chaired in 2016-2017. 2022Gijs O. VermeerGijs J. O. Vermeer is a modest geophysicist whose influence on the design of seismic surveys has been outstanding for over three decades. He is the preeminent authority. His first peer-review publication was the book Seismic Wavefield Sampling, published by the SEG in 1990. It provided a firm theoretical basis and practical recommendations for optimum seismic data acquisition, with its main thrust on spatial sampling. Gijs then proceeded to publish scientific papers on further developments in seismic survey design. In February 2001, defying the conventional order of scientific progression, he obtained a PhD at Delft University of Technology, with a dissertation entitled Fundamentals of 3-D Seismic Survey Design. A commercial version of the thesis was published in October 2002 as the SEG book 3-D Seismic Survey Design, a second, much thicker, edition of which was published in 2012. The now well-known concepts of cross-spread geometry, symmetric sampling and offset-vector tiles were formulated by Gijs, who continues to publish new insights in this field. His work has covered land, marine and seabed surveys and has been the principal guide for seismic survey design all over the world. Gijs Vermeer has never received a significant award from the EAGE or the SEG. EAGE is delighted to present Dr. Gijs J. O. Vermeer with both the 2022 Desiderius Erasmus Award and Honorary Membership 2021John ArthurJohn Arthur is a Chartered Geologist, who has specialised in the application of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics projects since 1965. John pioneered the assessment of marine geological hazards, especially shallow gas, with high resolution, digital multichannel seismic data in the North Sea. He directed major European geophysical programmes for Nirex Nuclear Waste Repository sites at Dounreay and Sellafield; the Trans-Manche Link – the final definitive coast-to coast sub-seabed evaluation – for the Channel Tunnel; and the BP/Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Crude Oil Pipeline in Turkey. John’s career began at Wimpey Laboratories in 1963 and progressed to Fairfield Aquatronics Limited. In 1982 John established the consulting company “Arthur and Associates” which evolved to “Top Hole Site Studies Limited”. John has promoted geophysics for a huge range of civil engineering projects all over the world. In 1974 he became a member of the EAGE and was one of the main drivers to establish the Environmental and Engineering Geophysics community within the association. With success! Due to his perseverance, John became one of the architects of EAGE’s Near-Surface Geoscience Division in 2001, which he guided as Chairman from 2010-2012. The way John invested his keen mind for EAGE, especially for the “Near Surface” community, has been outstanding. John Arthur receives Honorary Membership of EAGE in recognition of his services to EAGE’s Near Surface Geosciences and for his pioneering achievements in near-surface geophysics for more than half a century. 2020Gladys GonzalezGladys Gonzalez is nominated for Honorary Membership of EAGE for her outstanding achievements as a geoscientist and for her even more impressive and important leadership achievements in EAGE, particularly as President-Elect and President, 2012-2014. Gladys was the first female President of EAGE. As President, she took some bold but necessary decisions, creating a much-improved relationship between the EAGE Board and the EAGE office. She started a reorganization that resulted in a clearer description of the roles of both the Board of EAGE and the Board of Directors running the EAGE office. It was a huge task, requiring great courage, which she accomplished with tremendous compassion, professionalism, dedication and strength. In addition, her vision for the Association resulted in initiatives like Vision 2020, the Women in Geoscience community and the Young Professionals community. Because of her professional achievements and great accomplishments during her presidency, Gladys Gonzalez deserves to EAGE’s recognition with the 2020 Honorary Membership Award. 2019Snežana KomatinaIn her long and varied career, Snežana Komatina has demonstrated tireless effort in promoting geosciences to local scientific public and bridging the gap between local and international societies. She has been an inspiring mentor and teacher in Serbia with an outstanding record of publication and engagement with students, the industry and the wider public. 2018Mohammed AlfarajFor Mohammed Alfaraj, for his highly distinguished research in applied geophysics, his leadership in exploration and multidisciplinary field development, and for his loyal and devoted service to the international scientific community, including SEG, SPE, IEEE, AAPG, WPC, MEOS, and especially EAGE.\n\nMohammed Alfaraj obtained a BS degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1983, and Master’s and PhD degrees in Geophysics both from Colorado School of Mines in 1987 and 1993, respectively.\n\nHe has made numerous important contributions in many geophysical fields, including dip moveout, vertical seismic processing, borehole geophysics, wavelet determination for quantitative seismic interpretation, resolution, diffraction imaging, and passive seismic monitoring. He also holds three US patents, with more pending.\n\nHe is a skilled manager who, for a decade, led research for Saudi Aramco’s Geophysical R&D, including high risk, high reward topics. He later became Exploration Principal Professional, 2009-2016. He was elected President of the Dhahran Geoscience Society (DGS) for the 1997-1998 term, and received the Saudi Aramco 2004 Intellectual Property Award and the 2007 Achievement Award.\n\nHis selfless service to EAGE has been outstanding: Associate Editor of Geophysical Prospecting (GP) since 2005; organization of research workshops, including the Sub-Salt Imaging Workshop in Cairo, 2009 and the Borehole Geophysics Workshop 2011; Guest Editor for a special 2012 GP issue on borehole geophysics, and a Special Editor for a 2014 GP issue titled “VSP and Microseismicity Frontiers”. As an editor and reviewer, his depth and breadth of experience and his meticulous, diligent work are very greatly valued. In 2013 he was elected Vice-President of EAGE and served with distinction as President, 2015-2016. 2018Ian F. JonesFor Ian F. Jones for his highly distinguished research in applied seismology, especially in velocity model building, migration, imaging and inversion; for his dedication to the teaching of geophysics and the training of geophysicists; and for his service to the EAGE.\n\nIan F. Jones received a joint honours BSc in Physics with Geology from the University of Manchester, UK, in 1977, an MSc in Seismology from the University of Western Ontario, Canada, and a PhD in Geophysical Signal Processing from the University of British Columbia, Canada.\n\nAfter working for Inverse Theory & Applications Inc. in Canada for two years, he joined CGG, where for 15 years he was involved in R&D in the London and Paris offices, latterly as manager of the depth imaging research group. Since 2000 he has been with ION GX Technology, as a Senior Geophysical Advisor in their London office.\n\nIan is very famous for his research, but he is just as famous for his powers of explanation and his ability to convey complex ideas in a non-mathematical way. His tutorials in First Break and his EAGE text book “An Introduction to: Velocity Model Building” are outstanding examples of this ability. He inspires many geophysicists with his willingness to share his knowledge and understanding, and those who have worked with him consider it a great privilege. Since 1998 he has organized numerous workshops and courses for EAGE, SPG and SEG and, since 2009, he has been an Associate Editor for both Geophysics and Geophysical Prospecting. He is as much esteemed in academia as he is in industry and was a member of the External Advisory Board for Imperial College’s MSC course in Petroleum Geophysics, 2012-2015, and is now a member of the External Advisory Board for University of Leeds MSc Geophysics, 2016-present. In 2016 he was made Honorary ‘Chief’ of the Igbo Peoples, Nigeria, 2016, for educational charitable works helping to teach science in a Nigerian school at a senior level. 2018Aldo VesnaverFor Aldo Vesnaver for his highly distinguished written and oral scientific contributions in applied geophysics and for his extensive service to the geophysical community, especially SEG and EAGE.\n\nAldo Vesnaver received a Master’s Degree in Physics in 1983 and a PhD in Geophysics in 1990, both from the University of Trieste (Italy).\n\nHe was a Research Scientist at OGS, Italy, with various assignments, 1983-2001: including seismic analyst, Team Leader and Vice-Director of Department. He worked for Saudi Aramco, 2001-2006, as Geophysical Specialist in R&D, and returned to OGS, 2006-2015, as Research Manager. He currently holds two positions: Faculty member of the ESFM PhD Consortium among the University of Trieste, OGS and the International Centre of Theoretical Physics (ICTP) of Miramare, and KADOC Chair Professor at the Khalifa University Petroleum Institute, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\n\nHis 96 scientific contributions include the calculation of phase and frequency without unwrapping, time-lapse tomography, geophysical inversion, and using irregular and staggered grids in seismic tomography. He has been Editor-in-Chief, Guest Editor and Associate Editor of Geophysical Prospecting. As Chairman, 2009-201, and member, 2004-2007, of the EAGE Research Committee, he organized numerous workshops on a great variety of topics; he has continued this valuable work, including a workshop on Unconventional Resources, 2014, and Full Waveform Inversion, 2017. He was a member of the EAGE Awards Committee, 2005-2010. He has also been active in SEG, who presented him with the Lifetime Member Award in 2009, and in Italy, where he was Co-founder and later President of the Italian EAGE-SEG section. In all these activities, Aldo’s enthusiasm, commitment and ability to get people to cooperate has attracted many young professionals to the world of geophysics. 2017Satinder ChopraAfter MSc (1976) and MPhil (1978) degrees from Himachal Pradesh University, India, Satinder Chopra learned his trade as a processing and interpretation geophysicist with ONGC in India before moving to Scott Pickford in Calgary in 1998. Here, he led the introduction and demonstration of coherence cube processing as a means of visualising, with amazing resolution, geological structure in 3D seismic data. The success of this project set his direction and his name has become synonymous with a string of developments in seismic attributes: and not just their estimation but also in their interpretation in the context of hydrocarbon detection and play analysis, and in their communication to the industry through a series of practical workflows, case studies and publications.\n\nSatinder left Scott Pickford in 2004 and, after a brief spell at Paradigm in Calgary, joined Arcis Seismic Solutions, now a subsidiary of TGS-NOPEC, in 2004 as Manager and then Chief Geophysicist of Reservoir Services. While in managerial positions, Satinder has followed his research interests relentlessly and has made major contributions in curvature analysis, impedance inversion, AVO analysis and VSP data processing; all in the pursuit of improved interpretation of 3D seismic data for structure and reservoir properties such as porosity, saturation and fractures.\n\nSatinder is a born communicator. While respecting his rigorous background in physics, with books for Indian maths students, Satinder has generated some 170 journal publications (18 in First Break) and over 200 conference presentations (5 in EAGE conferences), as well as a total of 8 books with a ninth in preparation. He has been a Distinguished Lecturer for CSEG and AAPG/SEG, and an e-Lecturer for EAGE in 2014-15. Satinder has been unstinting in his time and support for associations in India, the USA, Europe and Canada, and has served CSEG especially on several committees and as editor of the CSEG Recorder. He has won a number of best paper and best poster awards and was made Honorary Member of CSEG in 2014. The Awards Committee has no hesitation in recommending the award of EAGE Honorary Membership to Satinder Chopra. 2016Olivier DubruleThe epithet, “Lies, damned lies and statistics” could never be applied to Olivier Dubrule’s geostatistics; rather the contrary because rigorous application of geostatistics enabled clearer understanding of uncertainty and its incorporation into sub-surface risk management through the integration of this primarily mathematical discipline with geological knowledge and rules. This was rigorously articulated in Olivier’s thirty or so papers in geostatistics and earth modelling and was recognised by his employer Total in a career that took him to vice-president in charge of Total’s Worldwide Geosciences and university relations, and to his current position as Visiting Professor of Petroleum Geostatistics at Imperial College, London.\n\nOlivier’s career has spanned both technical achievement and a great commitment to education and communication. Motivated by a desire to share knowledge he has been an organiser, convenor, chairman and contributor to almost countless conferences and workshops for both EAGE and its sister organisations, including AAPG, SPE and SEG. Olivier served as a DISC instructor for geostatistics; he authored the AAPG course notes on geostatistics that have become a standard reference, and he co-edited a thematic set of Petroleum Geostatistics that appeared in Petroleum Geoscience.\n\nOlivier has made significant contributions to the association, having been EAGE president 2004-2005 and the EAGE representative and Board member of IPTC Ltd. He has served on the EAGE awards committee as well as the editorial board of Petroleum Geoscience. For these and many other contributions to professional and university communities, and for his excellent technical achievements, we recommend the award of Honorary Membership to Olivier Dubrule. 2016Lars SønnelandAn applied mathematician by background, Lars Sønneland spent just three years in academic research before joining the Geophysical Company of Norway (Geco) in 1974. The move clearly suited him and his employer because he has stayed with Geco through all its metamorphoses, recently retiring from Schlumberger after 41 years to become a consultant advisor to the Stavanger-based research group that he created and nurtured. Although Lars had early significant contributions in seismic acquisition, including a notable paper on dual streamer wavefield separation, it was his brainchild of Charisma, the first truly interactive commercial workstation capable of supporting 3D seismic interpretation, that set his future path. In a career spanning over 40 years, Lars has focused on developing ideas and applications for generating and interpreting 3D seismic attributes, whether from towed marine seismic, seabed seismic, borehole seismic or time-lapse seismic. His emphasis has been to integrate seismic interpretation with stratigraphic modelling, geological process modelling, reservoir simulation, geomechanics and microseismics.\n\nAlthough the output from the Stavanger research group that Lars led was focused towards commercial application, Lars has a significant publication record, including many patents, a good number of peer-reviewed articles and a large body of expanded abstracts presented at both SEG and EAGE annual meetings. He has been a tireless supporter of EAGE conferences and workshops and has contributed to the steering committees of several Norwegian scientific bodies. Lars’s technical work has been recognised with many best paper and best technology awards, and he has served on university review boards in Norway, Switzerland and Scotland. For his technical, university and association contributions over a lifetime of achievements in exploration and production, we recommend the award of Honorary Membership to Lars Sønneland. 2015Neil GoultyNeil Goulty, emeritus professor of applied geophysics at UK’s Durham University, has held continuous EAGE membership since 1980. His services to EAGE, to his students, to his university, to industry, and to academia amply merit the award of Honorary Membership. Apart from a brief spell at CalTech, his career has been based in the UK but his reputation is international, enhanced by the large number of both undergraduates and graduate students that have been influenced by him. He is a rigorous teacher of time series analysis, a knowledgeable researcher in seismic geomechanics and geology, a hard-working and dedicated supporter of EAGE journals (two periods as editor of First Break and a continuing editorial board member for Petroleum Geoscience), and an excellent author with an exemplary command of English. Neil has made important original research contributions in earth strain, coal seismology, cross-well seismic, seismic data processing, polygonal faulting, and geopressure – including recent leadership of a substantial consortium in this subject at Durham.\n\nNeil served as Publications Officer on the EAGE Board for two full terms ending in 2013, and he continues to support Petroleum Geoscience as both author and EBM. Neil’s professionalism, sound reasoning, good advice and dedication to the Association were amply evident during his period on the Board. Neil would often go beyond the call of duty to resolve an issue, such as travelling to a recalcitrant external publishing house in the midst of his teaching obligations to negotiate contract terms for an EAGE journal. His commitment to EAGE over the years has been second to none and there is ample evidence of the high esteem in which he is held by students and academic staff alike at Durham. EAGE is delighted to award Prof. Neil Goulty with Honorary Membership. 2015Richard OgilvyAfter a master’s degree in applied geophysics, Richard Ogilvy immediately went into engineering geology. He gained practical exposure to all the potential field techniques as a mineral geophysicist in Australia before joining the British Geological Survey, where he became project leader for aerial and ground electromagnetic, self-potential, induced polarization (IP), and transient EM surveys. At BGS he contributed significantly to 3D resistivity modelling, TEM and IP tomographic instrumentation and processing, and still found enough time to gain a PhD from Leicester. Richard’s career has covered both research and application of potential field technology in almost every area of near-surface geoscience, notably including the characterization of rock masses for the UK nuclear waste repository. He has published prolifically and developed a substantial international reputation.\n\nRichard rose to senior management in BGS and represented the UK in the Environmental & Engineering Geophysics Society, where he was a member of the executive board and editor-in-chief of EJEEG, the forerunner of Near Surface Geophysics. Richard was instrumental in the smooth merger of the society with EAGE, which he joined in 2002 and served on the EAGE Research Committee. He has some 40 papers and extended abstracts with EAGE journals, including a First Break article with Andrew McBarnet, and is a frequent contributor to the annual meeting. At BGS, he has collaborated widely as a principal investigator and co-supervised 10 PhD students at several UK universities. Richard has brought much innovation to near-surface geoscience including: a new capacitive resistivity imaging system; TEM modelling codes; 2D spectral IP inversion, 3D resistivity inversion; novel resistivity tomography techniques, and new self-potential tomography software. In recognition of a lifetime of research contributions to near surface geophysics and support for the Association and its growing near-surface community, EAGE awards Honorary Membership to Dr Richard Ogilvy. 2014Andrew McBarnetAs the former Editor of First Break, Andrew McBarnet has worked tirelessly on behalf of EAGE and its journals for an unbroken span of nearly 31 years, a record that may never be equalled. He has been with First Break from the very first issue, published in January 1983, starting as Associate Editor when the journal was published by Blackwell Scientific Publications. Brought in-house and nurtured, First Break has grown from 38 black-and-white pages per issue to EAGE’s full-colour flagship journal, published in English, Spanish and Russian, and distributed to all members with a circulation approaching 24,000. Andrew developed First Break through a gradual process of innovative expansion and restyling. Throughout his editorship Andrew’s professionalism has ensured that the journal’s content has been readable, interesting and informative. He is one of those rare professional journalists with the right knowledge and expertise for the job, impressing all who know him by his dedication and the way he applies himself with “dynamism, pride and joy”. Andrew typically compiled, edited, or even rewrote the EAGE news; he assembled all the industry news and features at his own initiative, and invited many contributions to the Special Topics using his extensive knowledge of the industry. In addition to First Break, Andrew edited the annual Recruitment Special and, until recently, all of the EAGE regional newsletters. He was very actively involved with EAGE’s book “Reflections on the First 50 Years”. For his outstanding services to EAGE and its communications to the geoscientific community we are delighted to award Andrew with Honorary Membership. 2014Jacob FokkemaProfessor Jacob Fokkema, one-time professor at the Free University of Amsterdam and former Rector Magnificus at Delft University of Technology, is an exceptionally worthy recipient of Honorary Membership, both for his highly significant technical contributions over 35 years of research, and for his organizational and editorial work for EAGE. Jacob is widely recognized and respected among his peers for his uniquely excellent science, and for the creativity of the students fortunate enough to have earned their degrees under his direction. He has made a number of fundamental contributions to exploration geophysics, ranging from his 1979 proof of Rayleigh’s 1907 conjecture on wave scattering, essential for understanding reflections at irregular interfaces, through his 1990’s theory of acoustic reciprocity as the scientific basis for geophysical data analysis, now central to the subject, to his recent novel work on the attenuation of seismic multiples. He has authored or co-authored over 70 peer-reviewed papers, many published in EAGE journals, contributed over 60 papers to the EAGE annual conference, and has written a textbook on applications of reciprocity in seismic exploration. Jacob’s reciprocity result provided the foundation for seismic and electromagnetic interferometry, methods that have been enhanced by other researchers and are becoming widely used in the industry. He has supervised the research of a least 40 PhD students and numerous MSc students, many of whom have gone on to become leaders in their respective fields in academia, industry and government. During his period as Rector Magnificus of Delft University, Jacob was instrumental in establishing the IDEA-League international masters’ programme linking the universities of Delft, Aachen and ETH Zurich, and he continues to edit the Journal of Seismic Exploration. 2013Roger Arthur ClarkDr Roger Clark is a seismologist who has worked on a broad range of problems of interest to both academia and industry. In his early work he used global earthquakes to image the deep mantle. He produced one of the first images of lithospheric structure beneath the British Isles using surface waves. He has also had a distinguished career in ‘forensic’ seismology, using seismic methods to monitor nuclear explosions. Working with glaciologists, Dr Clark has applied reflection seismic methods to imaging ice-sheets using both GPR and seismic data. He has used a range of geophysical methods in environmental geophysics applications, including exploration for cave systems. In the area of exploration seismology, Dr Clark is best known for his pioneering work on attenuation and ‘Q’ estimation. Dr Clark has made great technical contributions to the benefit of society. In addition, for more than sixteen years, he has led the Leeds University MSc course in Exploration Geophysics, while maintaining undergraduate teaching, PhD supervision, consultancy work and pursuing his personal research. Dr Clark started teaching at Leeds in 1982 and became director of the MSc course in 1996. Since then, he has guided the course to its place as the premier applied geophysics course in the UK, attracting upwards of 20 students per year, mainly supported by private or industry funding. Thus, for his scientific research, his contributions to society at large, his huge impact on geoscience education and his long-term support of the EAGE and its values, it is our great privilege to award Dr Roger Clark Honorary Membership of EAGE. 2012Robert MitchumRobert (Bob) Mitchum is awarded the Honorary Membership of EAGE on the basis of his monumental contribution to stratigraphic thinking over the past 50 years. In conjunction with Peter Vail and his colleagues and armed with Exxon’s worldwide database, Bob Mitchum has helped to develop and foster the fundamental concepts of sequence stratigraphy and the global controls thereon. Fortunately he has published and taught very extensively and thus has shared widely their work with the worldwide geoscience community at large. In doing so, he has changed forever the way that we as working geologists think.\n\nSequence stratigraphy is undoubtedly one of the principal areas of growth in geological thinking over the last half century, aided by the now widespread availability of good quality reflection seismic. Bob Mitchum has given us a clear insight into this aspect of our science and we are immensely grateful to him for doing so. 2012Paul F. WorthingtonPaul F. Worthington is awarded the Honorary Membership of EAGE on the grounds of his excellent and unique contribution to our science over a long period and for his very considerable services to EAGE. His technical interests have included near-surface geophysics and more recently, petrophysics, where he has focused on understanding and characterising the controls on fluid fluxes in the subsurface. In his current role as a consultant his main interests are integrated studies for reservoir characterisation and management, reserves estimation and equity redetermination.\n\nPaul has published widely and is recognised globally for his technical expertise and is in great demand as a speaker, reviewer, chairman, editor and consultant. His contribution to EAGE has also been immense, as a member of some 40 years standing and as a founder and co-editor of Petroleum Geoscience since its birth in 1995. He has been responsible for reservoir engineering, fluid flow and petrophysical papers. As such he has helped materially in achieving the present high profile that Petroleum Geoscience now enjoys. 2011Phil ChristiePhil has held a variety of technical and managerial positions in Schlumberger, and more recently, Western Geco. His research interests are many and have included coal-bed mapping, borehole seismic, sub-basalt imaging and 4D seismic. He is an enthusiastic and tireless worker in propagating the science and in building interfaces between academia and industry. Phil’s EAGE contribution has been stellar. Since joining EAGE in 1979 he has always been a very active member. He has been chairman of the EAGE Oil and Gas Geoscience Division, at the same time as acting as a Co-Editor and now Editor-in-Chief of Petroleum Geoscience. In 2008 Phil became President of EAGE and was always a very active Board member, dedicating all his time to travelling around the world representing EAGE. More recently, Phil has driven the revision to our Association’s Constitution and the By-Laws. Phil embodies everything that EAGE seeks to be and is a superb ambassador for the Association. 2011Tijmen Jan MoserTijmen’s main technical contribution for the society is reflected in his insight and vision for solving real practical seismic propagation challenges. His later focus on ray theory calculations continues to impact many EAGE members as well as worldwide, as reflected in two Loránd Eötvös Awards in 2007 and 2010 for outstanding papers. He is particularly dedicated to the cause of EAGE as a professional society and contributes countless hours to uplifting the standard of our journal Geophysical Prospecting, both as reviewer as well as Editor-in-Chief. His relentless work on the Journal standard is reflected in more than doubling of its impact factor reaching a unique, all time high of 1.772 in 2009. 2010Bill Dragoset 2010Geoff King 2010Markku Peltoniemi 2010Peter Duncan 2010Werner Liebl 2009Etienne RobeinEtienne Robein has contributed considerably to the activities of EAGE over the last ten years and more, in a variety of roles, including those of President, Chairman of the EAGE Research Committee, and member of the Awards Committee. In all these and other tasks he has applied his wisdom, knowledge and diligence.\n\nHis contributions as a scientist are very highly regarded, for example his acclaimed book on Seismic Imaging, published by EAGE. 2009Mike BaconMike Bacon has provided supremely valuable voluntary service to EAGE over a considerable number of years. He was appointed as the Associate Editor of First Break for Geophysics in 1994, and served continuously in that capacity until the end of 2004 when he became Publications Officer and Chairman of the First Break Editorial Board. He retired from those positions at the London Annual EAGE Conference in June 2007 after more than 13 years service. During his tenure, First Break evolved into the slick production we have today, combining the function of being the Association’s magazine with readable technical articles.\n\nAs a practising geophysicist, Mike has authored two outstanding textbooks as well as many scientific papers of the highest quality. 2008Jim CainIn recognition of their dedicated work on the creation, development and public release of the European Petroleum Survey Group database of coordinate systems, thereby conferring an incalculable benefit on the geoscience community at large. The work required a deep understanding of the complexities of geographic and projected coordinate systems in use worldwide, and an immense amount of painstaking work to compile an authoritative database documenting all such systems in use in the petroleum industry. The database is the only accessible and authoritative source of information on geodetic datums and projections in use round the world. It is vital to all aspects of geoscientific work. 2008Roger LottIn recognition of their dedicated work on the creation, development and public release of the European Petroleum Survey Group database of coordinate systems, thereby conferring an incalculable benefit on the geoscience community at large. The work required a deep understanding of the complexities of geographic and projected coordinate systems in use worldwide, and an immense amount of painstaking work to compile an authoritative database documenting all such systems in use in the petroleum industry.

It is vital to all aspects of geoscientific work. 2008Roel NicolaiIn recognition of their dedicated work on the creation, development and public release of the European Petroleum Survey Group database of coordinate systems, thereby conferring an incalculable benefit on the geoscience community at large. The work required a deep understanding of the complexities of geographic and projected coordinate systems in use worldwide, and an immense amount of painstaking work to compile an authoritative database documenting all such systems in use in the petroleum industry. The database is the only accessible and authoritative source of information on geodetic datums and projections in use round the world. It is vital to all aspects of geoscientific work. 2008Bjørn Ursin(with Desiderius Erasmus Award)\n\nBjørn Ursin has been at the forefront of geophysical research, education and geo-industry for more than 30 years. His unique style, and innovative and consistent approaches to geophysics have resulted in new insights and supported technological breakthroughs for seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation. These achievements have not only shaped geophysical technology but more importantly inspired geophysicists to a new way of thinking and to a deeper understanding of geophysics. His background from industry has ensured that his academic activities are well grounded and relevant to exploration geophysics. Bjørn has authored or co-authored over 100 papers in international journals. He has always actively searched for international cooperation and has served EAGE as Editor-in-Chief of Geophysical Prospecting as well as in several committees over the years. 2007Dragi StefanovicIn recognition of his important activity in the development of education in geophysics and in the promotion of national and international cooperation within our science and Association. In particular, his presidency of the EAEG and his role in organizing the EAEG Conferences in Zagreb in 1977 and in Belgrade 1987 have made a significant contribution to the success of the EAGE in the new Europe. 2007Sven Treitel(with Desiderius Erasmus Award)\n\nIn recognition of his pioneering work in the field of signal processing and filter theory. He was among the earliest geophysicists to recognise and to make full use of digital computers in seismic data processing. A field where Sven Treitel has played a crucial role is the development of seismic deconvolution techniques, deconvolution being among the most significant and helpful developments in seismic data processing, extending even into such processes as synthetic seismograms and pseudovelocity log generation.\n\nHis papers in Geophysical Prospecting on digital filtering and inversion are among the most widely referenced in the industry. His works on inverse theory, on wave theory and all its applications to finite difference “wave equation” migration, and on a whole sequence of other seismic issues have greatly influenced the way we conduct our daily work as geoscientists. 2006Augustinus Berkhout(with Desiderius Erasmus Award)\n\nIn recognition of his innovative and unified approach to a wide range of seismic issues, resulting in several technological breakthroughs for our industry. As a leading academic and as a pragmatic pioneer in the field of hydrocarbon exploration and production, he has listened and responded to the industry’s needs, thus creating a situation that has introduced new opportunities in both industry and academia – as manifested by the major projects that he has led, such as the Delphi Consortium.\n\nHis many technical contributions, including those in the field of wave propagation in complex media and as applied to dynamic and static seismic problems have had a distinctly major impact in the industry. 2006Edward SzaraniecIn recognition of a long list of excellent contributions that encompass electrical, electromagnetic, magneto-telluric, and seismic methods in both theory and application to mineral and groundwater exploration and to civil engineering. In particular, his synthesis of basic concepts in both electromagnetic and elastic wave propagation theory constitute a major achievement that has led to novel insights in both fields, particularly from the viewpoint of numerical modelling of EM as well as seismic phenomena. 2005Alfred FrashericIn recognition of his extensive and very active contribution to the geoscience community in Albania and internationally for more than forty years, as manifested in a huge number of scientific papers, books and monographs including works in geothermal, electrical and electromagnetic methods for ore deposits and petroleum, in hydrology and environmental issues among others, his participation in the Geothermal Atlas of Europe, Geothermal Energy in Europe, his major role as an educator and his active participation in the responsibilities and in furthering the aims of geoscience associations in Eastern Europe. 2005Tamás BodokyIn recognition of a long string of highly valuable services to the Association, including his instrumental role in the creation of the new EAGE in the mid 1990’s, his vital input as a member of the EAGE-PACE Foundation Board, his contribution to the success of the EAGE in the new Europe, his role as President of EAEG, his work in EAGE committees, as an organiser of the EAEG Conference in Budapest in 1985 and as a crucial supporter of many other conferences in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine, as a key person behind the production of a book on Loránd Eötvös works, in addition to several other activities beside his many valuable works in geophysics, works that well merited his appointment as the Director of the Eötvös Loránd Geophysical Institute of Hungary in 1994. 2005Roy WhiteIn recognition of his outstanding achievements that have profoundly influenced both the industry at large and academia. A scientist par excellence, his innovative approach to the application of signal theory to seismic data and wavelet estimation together with his statistical concepts have been fundamental in the crucial problem of matching the seismic to the well data, in deconvolution and in other valuable applications in addition to his other works in petrophysics, AVO, reservoir geophysics, accuracy of Q and other disciplines which have been adopted by the industry in various forms. His services to the Association in committees and in editorial capacity have been characterised by his usual efficiency and dedication. 2004Anthony SpencerIn recognition of the key part he played in the establishment of the European Association of Petroleum Geologists (with its consequent incorporation into the EAGE), in the establishment and success of Petroleum Geoscience, in reinforcing the geological input into First Break, for his many editorial roles and for his other valuable services to the Association. 2004Donald H. GriffithsIn recognition of his immensely valuable services to the geoscience community over more than fifty years, as one of the initial supporting members of the Association and as the founder and principal mentor of the sub-Department of Geophysics at the University of Birmingham. This was one of the earliest centres of geophysical learning in Britain and has to date produced around 400 post-graduates, some of whom have played and continue to play major roles in the petroleum industry, others in mineralogy and in such fields of the near-surface as hydrogeology, engineering and archaeology, in Europe and throughout the world. His technical contributions range from being one of the early researchers into palæomagnetism of sedimentary rocks and the nature of the Earth’s magnetic field to co-authoring a popular and highly valued text book in geophysics and from working in marine geophysics and large-scale land seismology, in pursuit of problems in global tectonics, to the development of some of the first practical electrical tomography systems. 2003Jan Joost NooteboomIn recognition of his valuable services to the Association over a long period of time. Jan Joost Nooteboom served as a Technical Programme Officer,Vice-President and President of EAEG. He played a crucial role in the EAEG’s “opening to the East” – his pleasant and modest personality helping greatly in fostering the relationships with the geo-communities of the former Soviet Block Countries. He contributed a great deal to the successes in the merger of EAEG and EAPG and in establishing a close relationship between SEG and EAEG. 2003Gerd ZunckeIn recognition of his contribution to the Association, in particular for his 10-year chairmanship of the EAGE-PACE Foundation (Programme for Association and Cooperation in Earth Sciences). Under this successful programme hundreds of geoscientists from Central and Eastern Europe have been able to attend our annual event to present their work and many local geoscience events have been sponsored. 2003Leon ThomsenIn recognition of his outstanding and fundamental contribution to seismic anisotropy which marked a milestone in our ability to handle the phenomenon in a practical manner in a wide range of geophysical applications while providing the bases and firm directions for further advances in this respect, and for his services to the Association. 2003Peter Hubral(with Desiderius Erasmus Award)\n\nIn recognition of his many outstanding contributions to geophysics, including the introduction of image ray concepts, his work on true amplitude, on propagation in layered media and on reflection surfaces in conjunction with structural configurations, all of which have had far reaching consequences on the approach to imaging the earth, and for his services to the Association. 2002Vlastislav CervenyFor his lifelong dedication to advancing seismic ray theory and the tremendous impact his work had on seismic modeling, imaging and inversion. 2002Virgil BardanIn recognition of his scientific and technical advancement of Data Processing related to sampling, inversion and attenuation of multidimensional seismic data and his dedicated advice given to the Society. 2001J.-C.

Koefoed 1963B.Baars 1958A. van Weelden 2023Tao YangDr. Tao Yang, a senior specialist in reservoir technology in Equinor and a member of the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences, is proudly recognized by this year’s Alfred Wegener Award. Dr. Yang is an industry expert with an excellent track record in petroleum and energy technology innovation and implementation while integrating geoscience, data science and engineering. Dr. Yang has made outstanding technical contributions in PVT and fluid characterization, gas-based improved oil recovery, digital innovation on real-time fluid identification, low carbon innovation in CCS and hydrogen value chain. Meanwhile he has tirelessly served the community through EAGE, SPE and SPWLA. He is thus the most deserving of the Alfred Wegener award. 2022Matthew David JacksonMatthew David Jackson is recognized for his outstanding contribution to petroleum and reservoir engineering, including the ongoing transition to a lowcarbon energy future. Dr. Jackson has advanced the fundamental understanding of physical flow and transport processes in porous geological media. That is critical to address a broad range of long-standing problems in geosciences and engineering — whether to understand flow in rocks that host groundwater, act as source rocks and carrier beds formetals and metal transport, or serve as reservoir targets for subsurface energy and carbon storage. Matthew is notably recognized for his work at the interface of multiphase fluid flow with a detailed geological characterization of rock architecture. This approach has also resulted in a fundamental change in understanding of magma storage and movement in the Earth’s crust. In addition, Matthew founded and currently leads the NORMS Laboratory for Reservoir Physics — a facility for measuring and modeling a range of reservoir properties relevant to flow and transport in the subsurface using intact rock samples and at elevated temperature and pressure conditions. 2021Maša ProdanovićProfessor Maša Prodanović is a talented applied mathematician turned scientist and engineer, currently an Associate Professor of the University of Texas at Austin, where she leads an active and highly successful research group. She is a worthy winner of the Alfred Wegener Award: like Wegener himself, she is a scientist of considerable imagination, unafraid to pursue new ideas. She has made many seminal contributions to our understanding of flow in porous media. She has applied rigorous concepts in image analysis and topology to quantify pore structure and fluid displacement, making pioneering contributions to the level set method. More recently, she has studied complex pore systems, including carbonates, through multi-scale analysis combined with sophisticated rock classification. This work has been extended to shales with studies of nano-scale flow. She continues to pursue innovative ideas, one example being her recent work on grain boundary wetting. But it is not just in academic achievements that she stands out. She has established the digital rocks portal which provides a huge service to the community through hosting images and other results, allowing a free exchange of ideas and data. In addition, she is an inspiring teacher and mentor to students at UT and beyond. Professor Maša Prodanović receives the Alfred Wegener Award for her outstanding work on porous media and her dedication to geosystems engineering. 2020No recipient selected 2019No recipient selected 2018Tiziana VanorioAssistant Professor in the Geophysics Department at Stanford University, Tiziana Vanorio is recognized internationally for her expertise on the quantitative link between geophysical measurements and rock properties. Her highly innovative and cutting-edge research focuses on the geophysical characterization of the effect of rock-fluid interactions on rock properties, integrating laboratory measurements with imaging techniques. She conceived an original laboratory approach to track experimentally the dynamic coupling between rock properties and reactive transport, complementing simultaneous measurements of physical and chemical quantities with time-lapse, multi-scale imaging techniques. This approach has already been used for applications such as CO2 injection, diagenesis and catagenesis, providing very valuable data. More recently, Tiziana started to use 3D-printing to link digital and experimental rock physics.\n\nTiziana has published 39 peer-reviewed articles including one in Science, 10 book chapters and 60 conference papers. She was the recipient of a European Marie Curie Fellowship in 2002 and received a NSF Career Award in 2015. Tiziana is also strongly dedicated to science education, teaching courses and supervising students. In particular, she created a virtual rock physics laboratory to help students become familiar with the operation of laboratory set-ups outside teaching hours. This virtual laboratory provides interactive and 3D-animated renderings of the instruments and their operation for rock properties measurement. For this innovative teaching, Tiziana is the recipient of the 2014 SPE Innovative Teaching award. For her innovative scientific and technical contributions EAGE is delighted to present Tiziana Vanorio with the 2018 Alfred Wegener Award. 2017Sebastian GeigerSebastian Geiger’s background from Freiburg (geology), Oregon State University (hydrogeology), Australia National University (mathematics) and ETH Zürich (computational geology) brings huge experience, so it is not surprising that he already heads the Carbonate Reservoir Group at Heriot-Watt University, Scotland, co-directs the International Centre for Carbonate Reservoirs in Edinburgh, and is Computer Modelling Group Foundation Chair in Carbonate Reservoir Simulation. Sebastian is an outstanding contributor to petroleum and reservoir engineering in both academia and industry. He has advanced fundamental understanding of multi-phase, multi-rate processes in hydrocarbon and hydrothermal reservoirs, and of methods to represent them efficiently in reservoir simulations. A major achievement, with Stephan Matthai, has been the development of Complex Systems Modelling Platform code that uses an unstructured mesh to model realistic media, especially fracture systems, to simulate fluid flow and reactive chemical transport, and impact oil recovery from Middle East fractured carbonates. His 2004 paper in Geofluids represents a tour-de-force for its numerical sophistication and geological insight, defining characteristics of Sebastian’s research. Known for his open, accessible teaching and supervision (25 current PhD students and post-docs, and 44 MSc students in the past 5 years), Sebastian excels in both teaching and research. Active in EAGE, SPE and Interpore, he is Associate Editor for Transport in Porous Media and Co-Editor of Petroleum Geoscience. To date, he has published 62 peer-reviewed articles and 55 conference papers, including 33 publications in Petroleum Geoscience, First Break and EAGE conferences. He is a member of the EAGE Oil and Gas Divisional and Reserves committees. His scientific leadership is reinforced by core values that set the highest ethical standards for young geoscientists and engineers. For his ground-breaking contributions Sebastian Geiger fully merits the 2017 Wegener award. 2016Kenneth PetersKenneth Peters has had a long career in petroleum geochemistry, having worked in academia, government labs and both the oil company and service company sides of industry. He is one of the pre-eminent contributors to his discipline and is an established expert in source rock characterisation and analytical pyrolysis. With colleagues, he has published The Biomarker Guide, a classic reference work that defines the role that biomarkers play both in petroleum exploration and in understanding geological history and processes. Biomarkers help to genetically correlate petroleum samples and to interpret thermal maturity and the extent of biodegradation, and the guide documents most of the world’s known petroleum systems. Dr. Peters was one of the first, in 1999, to publish a study that integrated sequence stratigraphy with petroleum chemistry, a discipline that, at the time, was not fully embraced by geologists. As asserted in a letter of support, Ken Peters’ research “contributed greatly to transforming organic geochemistry from a ‘nichescience’ into a leading field in the geosciences.” More recently, he has been involved in the numerical modelling of sedimentary basins and their petroleum systems in collaboration with Stanford University. Dr. Peters has published extensively, co-authoring two Nature articles and has received best paper awards as well as the Alfred Treibs Medal of the Geochemical Society and the AAPG Honorary Member Award. Ken is an Honorary Teaching Fellow at the University of Aberdeen, one of Schlumberger’s NeXT instructors, a Fellow of the Geochemical Society, a member of EAGE, AAPG, GSA and ACS and a Consulting Professor at Stanford University, where he co-leads the Basin and Petroleum System Modeling Industrial Affiliates Program. For his groundbreaking contributions to petroleum geochemistry Dr Peters receives the 2016 Wegener Award. 2015Johannes WendebourgAlfred Wegener proposed continental drift before the age of 50 and Dr Johannes Wendebourg has made a similar, early impact on modelling sedimentary processes, petroleum systems and basins, in both academia and industry. In his PhD research at Stanford, he was a significant contributor to John Harbaugh’s team developing simulation codes for dynamic, quasi-3D, geological process modelling of sediment transport, deposition and fluid migration. Joining IFP as a geological engineer, he used basin modelling to estimate reserves in the Paris Basin for the French government and collaborated with industry in basins world-wide. As manager for basin modelling he partnered with Total, Statoil and BP in developing basin modelling algorithms, workflows and uncertainty analyses. With Shell in Rijswijk, Dr Wendebourg managed non-seismic research, covering geochemistry, basin modelling, petrophysics and potential methods including controlled-source EM. After assignments in Rijswijk and Houston, he moved to Total as head of petroleum evaluation where his expertise impacts on research planning, training, and petroleum systems evaluation throughout the Total group. Johannes has contributed fundamentally new workflows for petroleum prediction and risk assessment on real data, with important achievements in understanding parameter sensitivity and uncertainty in modelling petroleum systems, hydrocarbon exploration and reserves estimation. Despite his managerial duties, Dr Wendebourg lectures both for Total and as external professor for the IFP school, ENSPM. He frequently shares his deep insights with papers at AAPG Hedberg Conferences, SPE, PESGB and, of course, the EAGE annual meeting. Johannes is an associate editor of Marine Petroleum Geology and a member of the German GeoforschungsZentrum scientific committee. He also serves as an external examiner on PhD thesis committees. For service to both the science and practice of basin modelling and for his extra-curricular support to universities, journals and professional societies, EAGE grants the Alfred Wegener Award to Dr Johannes Wendebourg. 2014John R. UnderhillProfessor John Underhill fully deserves the Alfred Wegener Award for his outstanding contribution to the development of seismic interpretation methods that help us to understand how sedimentary basins form and evolve, and their application to the search for hydrocarbons. As a geologist with enormous expertise in structural and stratigraphical analysis, and in sedimentology, John has built a deserved reputation for innovative basin analysis, and finding new solutions to established problems. Of particular note are his contributions to revealing the development of the Triassic basin in the northern North Sea, with its potential as a new hydrocarbon play, and his compelling argument for salt withdrawal as the origin of the Sole Pit crater in the southern North Sea, previously thought to be an impact structure. Another area of John’s interdisciplinary geo-research that has received widespread attention has been an assessment of the geological, geomorphological and geophysical evidence for relocating Odysseus’ homeland, ancient Ithaca. His communication skills are renowned, whether with the media (as with the ancient Ithaca narrative) or with industry, or with academia. John has been recognised as a distinguished lecturer by the AAPG, the Geological Society of London and, not least, the European Association of Petroleum Geoscientists. He has also provided outstanding service to a broad geological community, including the UK Parliamentary Group for Earth Sciences, and as President of EAGE in 2011-12. John was recently appointed to the newly created Shell Chair of Exploration Geoscience at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, where he is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He continues to serve both EAGE and GSL as a co-editor of the journal Petroleum Geoscience which, due in no small measure to his unstinting efforts, enjoys record impact factor, record subscriptions and global readership. 2013No recipient selected 2012Wojciech GóreckiIn recognition of his outstanding achievements over four decades of academic research and organisational activity in the field of petroleum geology and exploration in Poland and his innovations in renewable geothermal energy. Professor Gorecki’s long and distinguished career has been characterised by diversity and multidisciplinarity. This has embraced hydrocarbon exploration in different challenging settings in Poland, including tight Rotliegendes gas and Lower Palaeozoic shale gas, as well as in the exploitation of geothermal aquifers. While much of this research has centred on Poland, he has also worked overseas, including Libya and China, where he has fostered interdisciplinary research teamwork and professional cooperation within the petroleum industry. In addition to mentoring and teaching successive generations of research students he has published very extensively and has contributed to more than 150 papers, books and monographs, along with six geothermal atlases; his work has been recognised by awards both at home and abroad. His approach and ideas have done much to aid the introduction of modern geoscientific methods and practices in Poland and he has been involved in creating strong and friendly links with many petroleum and geoscientific institutions worldwide. He has also played a key role in the Polish Geosynoptics Society (GEOS), an organisation affiliated to EAGE and has encouraged Polish participation in EAGE events. EAGE is pleased to be able to honour such an innovative geoscientist. 2011Henning OmreIn recognition of his exceptional achievements in the field of geostatistics, and his involvement in the application of innovative geostatistical techniques to the progression and development of petroleum reservoir modelling. Early in his career, Henning was involved with the development and spread of object-based reservoir modelling, in particular for fluviodeltaic reservoirs, such as the Brent Formation in the North Sea. He went on to make a highly significant contribution to the quantification of uncertainty associated with reservoir modelling, using a Bayesian approach to kriging. Latterly, he has been extensively involved in the application of stochastic inversion techniques to lithofacies modelling. His work has been published extensively and recognised internationally.\n\nCurrently Professor of Statistics at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway, he has worked in many places worldwide from Australia and the USA to China. He has been involved with Joint Industry projects with major oil companies; and his enthusiastic and charismatic approach has been integral in the education of his many research students. 2010Francois RoureIn recognition of his outstanding contribution to the understanding of thrust belts and foreland basins, and to the effects of tectonism on fluid movement. His work has been an excellent example of EAGE’s goal of a multidisciplinary approach to the study of rocks and their fluids.\n\nFrom his early highly original and innovative work based on deep seismic imaging of the deep structure of the Alps, the Apennines and the circum-Mediterranean, he has extended his field of interest and expertise to most other major structural provinces worldwide. In addition he has developed a particular interest in the relationship between tectonics, basin development and fluid movement. He has published very extensively.\n\nHe has forged strong bonds throughout both academia and industry over the past 30 years, and has served very extensively indeed on numerous technical committees and consortia, both in France and internationally, funded variously by governments or oil companies. He has served as an AAPG Distinguished Lecturer. 2009Carlo DoglioniCarlo Doglioni specialises in structural geology, plate tectonics, crustal structure, subduction and volcanism, focusing on the circum-Mediterranean region. He has had a distinguished career in academia and research since 1981, at several universities in Italy, as well as being a visiting researcher at Basel, Oxford and Rice Universities. In addition to winning awards in Italy, his widely published research has been recognised internationally. In 1994 & 2005 he was AAPG Distinguished Lecturer and in 2004 he received the Spendiarov Award from the Russian Academy of Sciences. 2008No recipient selected 2007Jonny HesthammerIn recognition of his achievements as an educator in rekindling student enthusiasm for the geological, geophysical and reservoir technology aspects of oil and gas operations, and as a researcher focusing on the use of electromagnetic and seismic data for hydrocarbon detection. 2006No recipient selected 2005Patrick CorbettIn recognition of his fundamental role in integrating the various geoscience and geo-engineering disciplines, particularly sedimentology, reservoir geology, well testing, petrophysics and reservoir engineering and for his very significant contributions in the study of depositional environments, flow patterns and permeabilities and the use of statistical methods in reservoir studies and characterisation. 2004Andrew HurstFor his valuable and prolific contributions in the fields of sedimentology and petroleum geology, particularly in sediment distribution in deep-water basins, allocyclic and autocyclic controls on sedimentation, mineral stability as a provenance indicator, heavy minerals in sandstones and their use in lithostratigraphy, risk analysis and economic evaluations, sensitivity of engineering parameters to geological characteristics and related fields. 2003Emiliano MuttiFor his worldwide contribution to sedimentary dynamics of turbidites and their reservoir characterization during the last half century. His pioneering work has had a significant impact on petroleum geosciences. His broad international outlook and his attachment to the human values and “natural” geology are highly appreciated by all communities who have worked jointly with him. 2002No recipient selected 2001*K.J. WeberIn recognition of his numerous and outstanding contributions in his various roles at Shell, as a Professor at Delft and Associate Professor at ENSPM (IFP), at Heriot Watt and Imperial College, at TNO (Delft) and ITC. His efforts in bringing different disciplines together with practical solutions to very complex problems (e.g. the layer cake/ jigsaw/labyrinth classification for reservoirs) have been extremely valuable.\n\n* As from June 2001, all award titles will refer to the year in which they are presented to the winners, and no longer to the year in which the winning poster/paper was presented. 2000No recipient selected 1999K. GlennieFor lifetime achievements in closely integrating Sedimentology and Petroleum Geology and indirectly spurring the welfare of the UK and Scotland. 1998B.M. DurandIn recognition of his contribution to the integration of Organic Geochemistry as an essential tool in Basin Assessment, and of his contribution to the integration of Petroleum Geosciences and Engineering for Reservoir Characterization. 2022David G. QuirkAnd co-authors John R. Underhill, Jon G. Gluyas, Hamish A.M. Wilson, Matthew J. Howe, and Sean Anderson\n\nFor the paper “The North Sea through the energy transition” First Break, Volume 39, Issue 4, Apr 2021, p. 31 – 43\n\nThe energy transition has started. While traditional petroleum exploration and production will become increasingly difficult, the offshore region around the UK, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands offers many opportunities for companies prepared to embrace low-carbon energy and related activities. We present 19 ideas for new sustainable business. If climate commitments are to be met, the scale of the transformation will be immense. Assuming the economics of floating technologies improve, we envisage the majority of the North Sea (>100,000km2) to be repurposed for renewable power and related activities. In order to fully unlock the future value in wind, solar and ocean energies, as well as in subsurface storage, companies and governments will need to work together to create an integrated energy system. 2021Kees W. RuttenAnd co-authors Daan Den Hartog Jager and Geert-Jan Vis\n\nFor the paper ‘Unconformity mapping in the Schoonebeek oil field, the Netherlands’, published in First Break, Vol. 38, November 2020.\n\nThis is an impressive paper on the oldest oil field in the Netherlands (date of discovery 1943, development started by Shell (NAM) in 1947), with STOIIP (stock tank oil initially in place) of 1000 MMbbl. The field straddles the border between the Netherlands and Germany, where it is known under the name of Emlichheim. The field was shut-in in 1996. It was then redeveloped with horizontal wells and steam injection, and oil production resumed in 2011. The authors used seismic data acquired prior to the redevelopment in 2005, which became publicly available in 2010. They applied unconformity mapping techniques to three unconformities to clarify the stratigraphic relationships of the Early Cretaceous reservoir to its underlying and overlying successions, by providing a view that is unbroken by faults and that honours the erosional gaps of the three unconformities. The unconformities document the local subsidence, uplift, erosion and infill in great detail, enabling precise identification of likely remaining reserves. 2020Ian F. JonesFor the paper ‘Tutorial: the mechanics of waveform inversion‘, published in First Break, Vol. 37, No. 5, May 2019, pp. 31–43.\n\nFull waveform inversion (FWI) methods are becoming widely used to provide high resolution velocity models for use in migrating data from complex regions, and constraining impedance inversions. This paper is pitched perfectly and appeals to a range of readers, from students entering FWI and wanting to understand the basics, to industry professionals looking for a clear discussion of the subject. The detailed explanation of how each step of the FWI process is carried out is particularly helpful. The excellent list of references provided allows readers to delve further into the subject. Ian Jones’ paper provides an exceptionally well explained overview of the FWI method, and is already being used widely as a go-to reference on the subject. 2019Anders DraegeFor the paper ‘A new concept – fluid substitution by integrating rock physics and machine learning‘, published in First Break, Vol. 36, No. 4, April 2018.\n\nThis paper presents a new and patented concept for fluid substitution that can be integrated with machine learning to provide robust and simple fluid substitution with accuracy approximately equal to or better than Gassmann theory. The method is called ‘Rock physics Fluid Substitution’ (ROFS); a stepwise workflow is provided. For high porosity rocks, where the Gassmann assumptions are met, ROFS gives very similar results. For intermediate to low porosity rocks, ROFS gives more realistic fluid effects. The method can be applied to both siliciclastic rocks and carbonates. By using a rock physics model for carbonates, the new method can account for the effect of microstructure variations such as pore shape variations and cracks when performing fluid substitution. 2018Kim SengerAnd co-authors John Millett, Sverre Planke, Kei Ogata, Christian Haug Eide, Marte Festoy, Olivier Galland and Dougal A. Jerram\n\nFor their paper ‘Effects of igneous intrusions on the petroleum system: a review‘ published in First Break, Vol. 35, No. 6, June 2017, pp. 47–56.\n\nIn their excellent review paper, Senger and his co-authors give a global overview of the many types ofigneous intrusions, their geophysical signatures, and the numerous ways in which they can influence the entire petroleum system, including charge, migration, reservoir compartmentalization, trapping and sealing. All the individual petroleum system elements may be affected, positively or negatively, by igneous activity, as highlighted by case studies from different volcanic basins, conveniently brought together in a single table. The authors use both geological and geophysical concepts and provide a very well explained and well referenced overview to a general audience. 2017Ahmed OuenesAnd co-authors Y. Kiche, L. Ouhib, R. Smaoui, M. Paryani, S. Poludasu, A. Bachir and D. Balogh\n\nFor their paper ‘Efficient development of unconventional reservoirs using 3G workflows – Breaking the silos to achieve true integration with multi-disciplinary software‘, published in First Break, Vol. 34, No. 5, May 2016, pp. 109–116.\n\nUnconventional reservoirs challenge conventional workflows for characterisation and target selection since a sweetspot must not only have high hydrocarbon content but it must also enable high producibility. Producibility is enhanced by hydraulic fracture, so the third ‘g’ of geomechanics joins the existing two of geology and geophysics. Ahmed Ouenes and co-authors persuasively assert that their multi-disciplinary, integrated workflows can deliver significant savings over geometrically drilled completions. The authors demonstrate their approach on real case studies that bring together geology, geophysics and geomechanics, where stress and fracture modelling are integrated with seismic inversion-derived elastic properties and facies, to address the heterogeneity that challenges the economic development of unconventional reservoirs. The paper provides an excellent set of case-study examples and promotes practical aspects of geoscience applied to complex characterization and development projects. 2016Andrew J. CavanaghAnd co-authors R. Stuart Haszeldine and Bamshad Nazarian\n\nFor their paper ‘The Sleipner CO2 storage site: using a basin model to understand reservoir simulations of plume dynamics‘, published in First Break, Vol. 33, No. 6, June 2015, pp. 61–68.\n\nThe Sleipner carbon capture and storage project has two decades of data and experience of geological carbon storage (GCS). This important paper integrates geophysics, geology, petrophysics and flow simulation to obtain a new insight into the controls on CO2 movement in the subsurface and the best approach to model it. Under gravity-dominated drainage, Cavanagh et al. show that Darcy flow modelling, applied for the first decade of Sleipner monitoring, gives a poor match to the fluid distribution inferred from 4D seismic. Instead, they propose a capillary percolation model, better suited to the drainage displacement of the wetting brine by injected CO2, under near hydrostatic conditions. With this\n\nmodel, a significantly better match is obtained to the interpreted plume dynamics. Furthermore, the new approach is better able to address CO2 dissolution and suggests that, within decades, dissolution will make a significant contribution to storage. This significant paper generates a new flow simulation benchmark and will guide our thinking on GCS for years to come. 2015Gwilym J. LynnAnd co-authors A. Christian Ellis, Jonathan Brain, Richard Parker, Gerd-Jan Lörtzer and Sophie Michelet\n\nFor their paper ‘Gannet F field – Unexpected fluid flow between reservoirs identified from time-lapse seismic data‘, published in First Break, Vol. 32, No. 4, April 2014, pp. 53–59.\n\nIn this comprehensive, well presented case study, the authors have integrated time-lapse (4D) seismic data with high-resolution inversions, well data and geological modelling to constrain both static and dynamic flow models in the Gannet F field. The 4D data have revealed unexpected fluid flow between reservoir units, and have observed sweep in units without well penetrations, thereby constraining fluid distributions in space at discrete snapshots in time. The integrated interpretation has improved predictions of sand extent and reservoir quality and has identified undeveloped crestal volumes in southern reservoir units as future targets. 2014Mai Westphal StephensenAnd co-authors Michael Larsen, Gregers Dam and Tomas Hansen\n\nFor their paper ‘The Glenlivet gas discovery – an integrated exploration history‘, published in First Break, Vol. 31, No. 7, July 2013, pp. 51–63.\n\nThe authors present a comprehensive case study showing the importance of careful integration of geological, petrophysical and geophysical data to de-risk an amplitude-supported stratigraphic play on the Glenlivet Prospect. The initial prospect definition was based on regional seismic mapping and evaluation of existing data from offset wells. The detailed analysis included petrophysical interpretation, porosity modelling, fluid substitution, and AVO modelling. The results were compared with seismic and attribute maps of the Vaila Formation in the Glenlivet area. Based on the integrated evaluation, a combined geological and geophysical risking of the identified prospect was performed, leading to the successful exploration well in 2009. The authors reviewed the prognosed and post-well results and investigated reasons for the observed deviations. The successful case study is important in that it may lead to further development of the West of Shetland gas basin. 2013Caroline E. GillAnd co-authors Alberto Miotto, Mariano Floricich, Richard Rogers, R. David Potter, Josef Harwijanto and Peter Townsley\n\nFor their paper ‘The Nelson full field model: using iterative quantitative improvements from the initial framework to the final history match‘, published in First Break, Vol. 30, No. 9, September 2012, pp. 43–53.\n\nThe authors present a powerful methodology for building and updating constrained reservoir models. Their method incorporates various datatypes, including well data, 4D seismic surveys and production history, into reservoir models by updating structural framework, macrofacies and petrophysical properties, while managing all datatypes within an integrated workflow. The authors demonstrate their technique with a complex, channelized reservoir in the Nelson field in the UK North Sea, with implications for production optimization in many other depleting NW European fields. 2012Kurtis WikelFor his paper ‘Geomechanics: Bridging the Gap from Geophysics to Engineering in Unconventional Reservoirs‘, published in First Break, Vol. 29, No. 10, October 2011, pp. 71–81.\n\nThis paper argues that a geomechanics approach to tracking the stresses in the subsurface caused by drilling and hydraulic fracture operations in the production of unconventional tight gas and oil and gas shale reservoirs pays major dividends and should be more seriously considered in the geosciences community. The paper presents many topics of interest. Firstly, it is a very clear presentation of geomechanical concepts. This is excellent in the frame of a journal such as First Break, which will be read by people from very different technical horizons. Secondly, it discusses the impact of a geomechanical approach in the optimization of hydraulic fracturing in non-conventional reservoirs, which is also a very timely topic. And thirdly, it promotes a multidisciplinary approach, which is very topical for an EAGE publication. In all, a very good paper to introduce this recently redefined EAGE award. 2011Ashley FrancisIn recognition of his very substantial, original and diverse contribution to seismic inversion and geostatistics, and to the quantifying of uncertainty and risk. He has been a major influence for the widespread adoption of stochastic inversion technology in practical reservoir characterisation work. His extensive publications – especially his two papers in First Break – and lectures have helped considerably to publicise and also to demystify stochastic modelling, and to move it into the realm of an everyday tool in geological modelling. Thanks to the successful launch of his company Earthworks, he has successfully developed high speed stochastic inversion software to allow the rapid commercial application of the technique. Ashley Francis’s other technical contributions, and his active participation in conferences define him as a geoscientist who has made a very major contribution to geoscience over more than two decades. 2010Panos KelamisIn recognition of his research in the complex area of land multiple estimation and removal, which has resulted in an impressive series of model-based and data-driven algorithms currently widely applied within the E&P industry.

Krawczy\n\nFor their paper “Cable reverberations during wireline distributed acoustic sensing measurements: their nature and methods for elimination” published in Geophysical Prospecting, Volume 69, Issue 5, May 2021, p. 1034 – 1054.\n\nThe application of distributed acoustic sensing in borehole measurements allows for the use of fibre optic cables to measure strain. This is more efficient in terms of time and costs compared with the deploying of conventional borehole seismometers. Nevertheless, one known drawback for temporary deployment is represented by the freely hanging wireline cable slapping and ringing inside the casing, which introduces additional coherent coupling noise to the data. The present study proposes an explanation for the mechanism of noise generation and draws an analogy with similar wave propagation processes and phenomena, such as ghost waves in marine seismics. This observation allows to derive a ringing noise filter function, to study its behaviour and to consider known effects of the gauge length filter. After examining existing methods aimed at eliminating ringing noise and results of their application, we propose a two‐step approach: (1) developing a denoising method based on a matching pursuit decomposition with Gabor atoms and (2) subtracting the noise model for imaging improvement. The matching pursuit method focuses on decomposing the original input signal into a weighted sum of Gabor functions. Analysing Gabor atoms properties for frequency, amplitude and position in time provides the opportunity to distinguish parts of the original signal denoting noise caused by the vibrating cable. The matching pursuit decomposition applied to the distributed acoustic sensing‐vertical seismic profiling data at the geothermal test site Groß Schönebeck provides a versatile processing instrument for noise suppression. 2021Callum WalterAnd co-authors Alexander Braun and Georgia Fotopoulos\n\nFor their paper ‘High-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle aeromagnetic surveys for mineral exploration targets’, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 68, January 2020.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aeromagnetic surveys provide a cost-effective bridge between traditional low-coverage high-resolution terrestrial surveys and high-coverage low-resolution manned airborne surveys in the same area. At 35 m elevation, the UAV survey provided data at 1 m intervals along the line and 25 m line spacing, yielding a much higher resolution magnetic anomaly map than the manned airborne magnetic survey. An additional 45 m UAV survey allowed the first vertical derivative to be calculated, yielding even higher resolution and leading to a new gold discovery. This new technology provides a dramatic breakthrough in the acquisition of magnetic data. 2020Tor Arne JohansenAnd co-authors Bent Ole Ruud, Ronny Tømmerbakke and Kristian Jensen\n\nFor their paper ‘Seismic on floating ice: data acquisition versus flexural wave noise‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 67, No.3, March 2019.\n\nSeismic surveying in the Arctic must honor restrictions that forbid disturbing or harming wildlife and causing permanent footprints. The choice of measurement acquisition parameters must strike a balance between optimum data quality and environmental constraints. Seismic data acquired on floating ice are hampered by pervasive noise due to ice vibrations related to highly dispersive ice flexural waves generated by the seismic source. The authors conducted detailed and difficult experiments on floating ice in van Mijenfjorden in Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic to analyse the impact of flexural waves recorded with various seismic receivers and sources deployed both on top of the ice and in the water below. Measurements indicate that flexural waves are severely damped at 5 m or deeper below the ice, while hydrophone data suffer less from these vibrations compared with data recorded on the ice. The authors communicate their experience with great clarity and provide outstanding supportive illustrations. They conclude that seismic mapping of deep seismic horizons seems to be best achieved using 25-m long geophone strings and an airgun source. For shallow targets, the use of hydrophones in combination with detonating cord is an appropriate solution. 2019Jiri MlsAnd co-author Tomas Fischer\n\nFor their paper ‘A new mathematical model of asymmetric hydraulic fracture growth‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 66, 2018.\n\nThe paper presents a mathematical model of asymmetric hydrofracture growth based on relations between the solid-phase stress and the fracture hydraulics. For a single fracture and single injection point, the model has three parameters: the hydraulic conductivities of the two fracture wings and the normalised stress gradient. It predicts the positions of the fracture tips as functions of time. The model is applied to a set of microseismic event locations that occurred during and after an injection process at the Canyon Sands gas field in West Texas. Two methods are proposed to delineate the fracture tips from the set of microseismic events, making it possible to determine the model parameters and check the agreement between the model prediction and the measured data. Comparison of the measured and modelled growth of fracture wings supports both the assumption of non-zero stress gradient and the existence of post-injection unilateral growth. 2018Ehsan Zabini NaeiniAnd co-authors James Gunning and Roy White\n\nFor their paper ‘Well tie for broadband seismic data‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 65, No. 2, March 2017, pp 503-522.\n\nBroadband seismic data present a fundamental problem for wavelet estimation from well logs: the well logs are too short to allow accurate estimation of the long-period content of the data. In this very clear paper, Naeini and his co-authors present a robust solution to the wavelet estimation problem for well tie to broadband seismic data using three distinctive techniques: parametric constant phase, frequency-domain least squares with multi-tapering, and Bayesian time domain with broadband priors. Using a case study from the North West Shelf, Australia, they demonstrate the performance of the three techniques and propose cross-validation as a powerful consistency test of the estimated wavelet across a survey at different well locations. 2017Nicolas HummelAnd co-author S. A. Shapiro\n\nFor their paper ‘Back front of seismicity induced by non-linear pore pressure diffusion‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 64, No. 1, January 2016, pp. 170-191.\n\nDiffusion of a pore-pressure perturbation from a borehole fluid-injection source triggers microseismic events whose spatio-temporal evolution is interpretable in terms of the diffusivity and hence permeability of the rock mass. The seismicity continues after injection ceases and there is a ‘back front’ corresponding to the distance from the injection point that seismicity terminates at a given time after fluid injection ceases. In the case of hydraulic fracturing, permeability becomes strongly pressure dependent and anisotropic, and the diffusion is no longer linear. Hummel and Shapiro extend our understanding of the effect of fluid injection, including hydraulic fracturing and geothermal injection, on the distribution of induced seismicity in space and time. Comparing simulations with measured data, the authors show that the spatio-temporal characteristics of the event clouds can reveal a non-linear dependence of permeability on pressure, allowing the diffusivity tensor to be estimated, with economic benefit. The back front is a particularly strong diagnostic of non-linear diffusion in the rock mass. 2016Joost van der NeutAnd co-author Kees Wapenaar\n\nFor their paper ‘Point-spread functions for interferometric imaging‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 63, No. 5, October 2015, pp. 1033–1049.\n\nJoost van der Neut and Kees Wapenaar propose an original, quantitative analysis of point-spread functions in interferometric redatuming, in which acquisition (sources and/or receivers) are moved to a deeper level by building virtual reflection data. The authors show how this could be achieved by cross-correlation or multidimensional deconvolution. Other possible strategies, based on Marchenko redatuming, could also be chosen. This article presents theory and examples to estimate the spreading feature when examining redatumed data, which may suffer from distortions in the image domain, due to internal multiple reflections in the overburden. The point-spread functions can be utilised for diagnostic purposes in the image domain and, potentially, for the removal of multiplerelated artefacts. The approach can also be applied to other acquisition designs. The paper represents a major step towards the application of interferometric imaging by providing quantitative tools to evaluate and improve the quality of images from virtual reflection data. 2015Laurence J. NorthAnd co-author Angus I. Best\n\nFor their paper ‘Anomalous electrical resistivity anisotropy in clean reservoir sandstones‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 62, No. 6, November 2014, pp. 1315-1326.\n\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of resistivity anisotropy in real rocks, noted by Conrad Schlumberger in 1920, through an elegant combination of laboratory measurements and numerical modelling. The authors report novel laboratory measurements of the full electrical resistivity tensor in reservoir-analogue, quartzose sandstones with clay contents less than 1.5%. The findings suggest that resistivity anisotropy is the norm, even in clean sandstones that are often considered isotropic. The laboratory results are supported by grain compaction modelling. The authors suggest that such anisotropy may be related to deposition and compaction processes in clastic rocks, which could also affect fluid flow, and they discuss the potential impact on formation evaluation from log data, as well as the interpretation of remote sensing methods such as controlled source electromagnetics. 2014Klaus HelbigFor his paper ‘Review paper: What Kelvin might have written about Elasticity‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 61, No. 1, January 2013, pp. 1-20.\n\nHelbig succeeds in using a review paper to generate fresh insights, new clarity and innovative ideas, worthy of the Eötvös award, thanks to his analysis of a fascinating piece of scientific history. He recounts the main points of the ground-breaking analysis of the elastic tensor, made by William Thomson (later Baron Kelvin of Largs) in 1856, in his “XXI, Elements of a Mathematical Theory of Elasticity, Part 1, on Stresses and Strains,” and analyses why the paper elicited no reaction for 125 years. Helbig speculates on what might have been in Kelvin’s mind for a second part, and how the theory of elasticity might then have developed, accepting Kelvin’s eigensystem. Helbig’s paper provides a clear glossary for interpreting Kelvin’s tensor notation in the light of classical elasticity as we know it, and suggests the main points that could be still of great benefit in separating material properties from geometry, and especially in describing anisotropic symmetries. Helbig uses Kelvin’s formalism to link tensor structure to symmetry class and to identify a new symmetry class, the diclinic, fitting logically between monoclinic and triclinic classes, as earlier proposed by Muir and then by Helbig himself. This review is an outstanding contribution to Geophysical Prospecting and to elastodynamics in general. 2013Michael S. KingAnd co-authors William S. Pettitt, Jonathan R. Haycox and R. Paul Young\n\nFor their paper ‘Acoustic emissions associated with the formation of fracture sets in sandstone under polyaxial stress conditions‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 60, No. 1, January 2012, pp. 93–102.\n\nThe authors report results of laboratory experiments to measure the acoustic emission and ultrasonic response of a rock volume subjected to controlled stress and damage conditions. Their achievement in developing a technique for creating true triaxial conditions on rock samples and monitoring fracture growth from acoustic transmissions and emissions is highly commendable. Using moment tensor analysis, the authors interpret the mechanisms governing onset and development of microcracks as they coalesce into a fracture propagating deep into the sample. The methodology has potential for understanding and monitoring field-scale rock failure processes in petroleum, geothermal and CO2 reservoirs and around critical engineered structures within mines and underground nuclear-waste facilities. 2012Leiv-J. GeliusAnd co-author Endrias Asgedom\n\nFor their paper ‘Diffraction-limited imaging and beyond – the concept of super resolution‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 59, No. 3, May 2011, pp. 400–421.\n\nThis paper provides a framework for understanding and analysing both diffraction-limited imaging as well as super resolution. The authors demonstrate that point-diffracted data can apparently be super resolved by making use of null-space solutions. Moreover, two scatterers with strong interaction could still be super resolved. The authors also analyse the effect of noise and the signal frequency bandwidth on the resolving power, putting in evidence the limits and the advantages of this technique. While mentioning that the super resolution technique is not able to form complete and reliable images of the subsurface, the authors assert that separating diffractions from reflections and identifying a local target region (for example, diffractions associated with local faults), may have the potential to add more details to the big picture. The authors bring the reader to understand clearly difficult concepts while maintaining a high level of a paper, which is not only scientifically correct but that finally indicates the road ahead for seismic exploration. 2011J.B. JoubertAnd co-author V. Maïtan\n\nFor their paper ‘Borehole image logs for turbidite facies identification: core calibration and outcrop analogues‘, published in First Break, 2010, No. 6, pp. 55-66.\n\nIn exploration, appraisal, and development of hydrocarbon fields, the understanding of the sedimentary model requires increasingly sophisticated techniques and analysis to interpret the geometry, facies, and petrophysical properties of the reservoirs. The objective is to understand the reservoir flow properties for making optimum decisions during field development. For this purpose, the use of high resolution image logs provided by service companies has become essential in sedimentary interpretation. When they are correctly calibrated against known facies, image logs can replace coring operations, which are time-consuming, expensive, and limited in the depth interval sampled. Recent examples of application have proved highly successful for exploration wells. Now mature fields can be reinterpreted in the light of the new understanding gained, enabling development plans to be revised with enhanced recovery methods. As a result of the success of this approach, image-based facies interpretation is now included in the standard procedure for evaluation of data from exploration, appraisal, and development wells. 2010Federico CellaAnd co-authors Maurizio Fedi and Giovanni Florio\n\nFor their paper ‘Toward a full multiscale approach to interpret potential fields‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, 2010, pp. 543-557.\n\nA multi-scale analysis can highlight the edges of buried bodies by the derivatives of their potential field and, based on these constraints, improve the estimation of their depth and shape. A major advantage of this method is its ability to decouple the components due to shallow or local bodies from those regional or deeper ones. The validation by synthetic data highlights the application of this new method to field data from Southern Italy. 2010Vladimir GlogovskyAnd co-authors Evgeny Landa, Sergey Langman and Tijmen Jan Moser\n\nFor their paper ‘Validating the velocity model: the Hamburg score‘, published in First Break, Vol. 27, No. 3, p. 77-85.\n\nRarely does a paper address critically what does not work, especially for methods that are widely accepted or even standard for the industry. Glogovsky et al. have critically reviewed basic concepts of seismic imaging and highlighted major limits in velocity model building and in the subsequent depth imaging. The clarity and classy humour of their style made it a brilliant example of scientific communication of advanced topics to non-specialist geoscientists. 2009Pierre GouedardAnd co-authors L.

The optimum migration is found as a weighted stack of images obtained for a range of velocity models. The paper provides an original analysis of stationary phase construction in the velocity model domain and opens the door to a new family of automatic pre-stack time imaging procedures. 2006Eusebio StucchiAnd co-authors Alfredo Mazzotti and Simonetta Ciuffi\n\nFor their paper ‘Seismic preprocessing and amplitude cross-calibration for a time-lapse amplitude study on seismic data from the Oseberg reservoir‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 53, No. 2.\n\nThe paper presents an outstanding work on the analysis and reliability of time lapse pre-stack seismic amplitudes, a topic of prime importance for reservoir monitoring. The analysis encompasses careful true-amplitude processing of each vintage, original procedures for amplitude cross-calibration and robust estimation of AVO attributes. The paper provides many useful figures for the representation and analysis of pre-stack amplitudes. 2005Claudio BagainiAnd co-author Everhard Muijzert\n\nFor their paper ‘Calibration of cross-line components for sea-bed 4C acquisition systems‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 52, No. 4, pp. 341-349.\n\nThis is a very original piece of work on a topic of critical importance at a time when new seismic acquisition technologies are crucial to improving our understanding of the subsurface for better recovery of hydrocarbon reserves. The paper is very clearly written, provides a comprehensive analysis of coupling issues in multicomponent recording and offers solutions that are successfully applied to a real case. 2004Solomon AssefaAnd co-authors Clive McCann and Jeremy Sothcott\n\nFor their paper entitled ‘Velocities of compressional and shear waves in limestones‘, published in Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 51, No. 1.\n\nThis is an original piece of work in petrophysics and gives a new insight into our understanding of the elastic properties of limestones. The study is very relevant as it comes at a time when the industry is applying increasingly more amplitude-based seismic studies to carbonate reservoirs and when considering that carbonate reservoirs contain at least half of the"
