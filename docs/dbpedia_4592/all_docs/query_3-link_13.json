        "text": "UCLA professor Terence Tao has been selected by the Royal Society to receive the 2014 Royal Medal for physical sciences for his “many deep and varied contributions to mathematics.”\n\nThe Royal Society, based in London and founded in 1660, is the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence. The organization awards three Royal Medals each year in the physical, biological and applied sciences.\n\nThe awards, also known as Queen’s Medals, will be presented Dec. 1.\n\nTao, who holds the James and Carol Collins Chair in the UCLA College, has earned many other prestigious honors, including the National Science Foundation’s Alan T. Waterman Award, the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences’ Crafoord Prize. He also has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, selected as a MacArthur fellow, and named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Australian Academy of Sciences.\n\n► Related video: Tao wins the Fields Medal\n\n► Related video: Tao’s lecture on structure and randomness in prime numbers\n\nPrevious coverage of Terence Tao"
