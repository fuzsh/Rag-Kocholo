Any member of staff can nominate an individual staff member or team for these awards.\n\nNominations were considered at the Faculty level and then put forward to the awards panel.

David set up a pioneering distance learning MSc programme within the division of Medical Sciences that brings together a Faculty of more than 60 leading International experts and a group of UCL Education colleagues.

She is continually improving and seeks out opportunities for innovation, introducing new ways of teaching and helping the students get the most from their time at UCL.\n\nElisabete is described by her colleagues as “inspired by a student-led ethos that listens to their needs and aspirations to foster an enhanced student experience.\"\n\nPriti Parikh, Senior Lecturer, Department of Civil, Environmetal & Geomatic Engineering\n\nPriti has made a ground breaking contribution to engineering and development teaching in her department and as such a contribution to the student experience in the Engineering. Priti facilitated over 100 students to engage with international organisations through volunteer placements at UCL and has forged a partnership with Royal Academy of Engineers which will now see students working closely with entrepreneurs in Africa on funded placements.\n\nHer passion for education is noted by both colleagues and students and she was recently selected to be part of the exhibition profiles 24 women from across UCL who inspire those around them. She is described as \"changing the world using engineering\".\n\nJane Rendell, Professor, The Bartlett School of Architecture\n\nJane has been awarded for her long-term work on ethics in built environment teaching, research and professional practice and her department believes she is a real star! Jane’s pioneering ethical inquiry inspires reflexive, supportive, creative education of the future built environment practitioners and it is precisely this sort of unsung, but vital work that merits recognition with a UCL Education Award.\n\nTim Beasley-Murray, Senior Lecturer, Office Vice Provost (Education & Student Affairs) and School of Slavonic and East European Studies\n\nTim is being awarded for his outstanding work and leadership on the Global Citizenship Programme. From 2013 to 2017, the programme has grown from a pilot involving 100 students to seeing 800 students each year, a true highlight of the UCL academic year. Tim is now leading a second key project relating to UCL’s Education Strategy, the Introductory Programme. Tim’s enthusiasm and intellectual rigour have contributed hugely to the success of these innovative programmes.\n\nLizzie Vinton, Assessment Regulations and Governance Manager, Academic Services\n\nSince Joining UCL in 2015, Lizzie has led a project to reform UCL’s disparate academic regulations into a single, clear set of regulations which are easy to navigate and fair for students. Thanks to Lizzie, UCL now has in place a regulatory regime that is unified and an easily accessible Academic Manual with everything in one place, clear and precise regulatory language. UCL’s now vastly improved Extenuating Circumstances (EC) policy is worth singling out as a highlight. Lizzie’s work is recognised nationally and it is clear that she has bought about a transformation to the student experience.\n\nTeam awards\n\nUCL Public International Law Pro Bono Project\n\nKimberley Trapp, Alex Mills, Luis Viveros, Chris O'Meara, Ed Robinson and Niko Pavlopoulos, Academics, students and research participants, Laws.\n\nEstablished to provide LLM and PhD students the opportunity to work, individually and collaboratively and to make a positive contribution to the world, the UCL Public International Law Pro Bono Project is being awarded for its engagement in cutting edge legal research.\n\nThe project, which offers advice to assist leading international organisations in addressing some of the world’s most pressing and difficult challenges has proven exceedingly successful in a short period of time. The impact and value to the students and staff involved, and also to external stakeholders, has exceeded expectations and truly embodies UCL’s ethos of London’s global university.\n\nCentre for Teaching and Learning in Economics\n\nAwarded for their efforts to encourage cultural change, the Centre for Learning and Teaching in Economics was set up in 2015 to foster a greater teaching ethos and to encourage greater interaction with research-based education. The team developed a holistic approach and included Faculty, students and the professional services team, where they developed a series of initiatives and innovations to embed active research across all modules. This will be rolled out from fully from 2018/19. The Centre is truly revolutionising the way economist’s education and are educated.\n\nBSc in Biomedical Sciences\n\nProfessor Leslie Dale, Dr Tom Hawkins, Dr Pam Houston, Dr Margaret Mayston, Dr Julie Pitcher, Mrs Nidhi Rathod, Dr Richard Tunwell, Professor Talvinder Sihra, Division of Biosciences\n\nThe team has been commended for providing a “stellar example” of teamwork required to create an exceptional interdisciplinary degree with fantastic student experience on the BSc in Biomedical Sciences. However, getting to this point wasn’t easy. The team has done outstanding work in collaborating to create a series processes to ensure a world-class programme. This degree programme is now the flagship degree programme and has been recognised externally. The team has demonstrated excellence in a wide range of ways, including their thoughtful approach to organisation, academic integrity and responsiveness to student experience."
