        "text": "01 of 14\n\nPrincess Anne Is an Olympian\n\nFor Princess Anne, the Olympics are very much a family passion. An accomplished equestrian and member of the British eventing team, she became the first-ever member of the British royal family to compete in the Olympics in 1976 during the Montreal Games. She rode one of the Queen's horses, named Goodwill, during the competition.\n\nThe Princess Royal stayed involved with the Games, becoming a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1988.\n\n02 of 14\n\n...and Zara Tindall Earned a Silver Medal\n\nPrincess Anne passed on her love of horses to her daughter, Zara. She competed in individual and team eventing in the late aughts and early 2010s, winning an individual gold medal at the 2006 World Championships and a silver medal at the 2012 Olympics on her horse High Kingdom. In a sweet moment, her mom presented her with her silver medal in 2012.\n\n03 of 14\n\nZara's Dad, Mark Phillips, Won Gold\n\nIt's no wonder Zara went on to such successes on horseback: her dad is an equestrian too. Princess Anne's ex-husband, Captain Mark Phillips, has two Olympic medals — a gold and a silver — both won in the team three-day event competition. The first was in 1972 in Munich and the second in 1988 in Seoul.\n\n04 of 14\n\nWilliam, Kate and Harry Welcomed the Olympic Flame to the Palace\n\nPrince William, Kate Middleton and Prince Harry — all sporting \"Team G.B.\" polo shirts — were on hand to welcome the Olympic flame to Buckingham Palace just ahead of the 2012 Games in London.\n\n05 of 14\n\nPrince William and Princess Kate Gave Us Their Cutest PDA\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales aren't known for their public displays of affection, so when they had a sweet moment at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, it was almost as celebratory an occasion as a gold medal win. At the end of a cycling race, in which Team Great Britain was victorious, William wrapped Kate up in an excited hug.\n\n06 of 14\n\nPrincess Charlene of Monaco Competed\n\nBefore she was a royal, Princess Charlene, the wife of Prince Albert of Monaco, was an Olympic swimmer for her home country of South Africa. She competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics in the 4x100m medley relay, coming in fifth place.\n\nThat's not her only Olympic connection: at the 2006 Olympics in Turin, Italy, she and Albert made their debut as a couple. The pair married five years later in 2011.\n\n07 of 14\n\n...and So Did Prince Albert of Monaco!\n\nLike his wife, Prince Albert of Monaco is also an Olympic athlete. He competed in bobsledding at the Winter Olympics five times from 1988 to 2002, with a best finish of 25th in 1988 in the two-man event.\n\n08 of 14\n\nPrince Albert and Princess Charlene Carried the Olympic Flame\n\nAs the Olympic flame made its way to Paris for the 2024 Summer Games, the former Olympian couple took part in the relay. On June 18, Princess Charlene and Prince Albert wore matching shirts as they held the torch together.\n\n09 of 14\n\nPrincess Cristina of Spain Sailed in the Games\n\nThe sister of King Felipe of Spain, Infanta Cristina competed in the Seoul Olympics in 1988 as a member of Spain's sailing team. In later years, she became better known for her involvement in a corruption trial, which saw her and her husband investigated for fraud and tax evasion. She was acquitted of all charges in February 2017, though later stripped of her royal title.\n\n10 of 14\n\nKing Harald of Norway Is an Olympian\n\nAnother royal Olympic sailor is King Harald of Norway, who competed in three different Olympic Games — 1964 in Tokyo, 1968 in Mexico City and 1972 in Munich — before he inherited the throne. In 1964, he was given the honor of being Norway's flag bearer during the opening ceremonies. The Olympic spirit seems to run in his family: Harald's father, King Olav, won a gold medal in sailing at the 1928 Olympics. When the Olympics came to Norway in 1994, in Lillehammer, Harald officially opened the Games during the opening ceremony.\n\n11 of 14\n\nKing Constantine of Greece Also Earned Gold\n\nKing Constantine of Greece (as crown prince) competed in sailing at the 1960 Olympics and won gold in the Dragon class. He was a member of the International Olympic Committee from 1963 to 1974, after which he was an honorary member.\n\n12 of 14\n\nKing Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden Met at the Olympics\n\nQueen Silvia, who grew up in Germany and Brazil, first met King Carl Gustaf, then the crown prince of Sweden, at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Carl Gustaf was there to represent the Swedish delegation while his wife-to-be, then known as Silvia Sommerlath, was working as a host and interpreter for a few very important guests, including the future monarch. He later said that he asked her to have dinner the day they met and that the couple \"just clicked.\" Four years after their initial meeting at the Olympics, they got engaged in March 1976. Since their wedding, they've attended many Olympic Games together.\n\n13 of 14\n\nAs Did King Frederik and Queen Mary of Denmark\n\nKing Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia aren't the only royal couple with an Olympic beginning to their love story.\n\nAt the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, then-Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark met Mary Donaldson at a bar called the Slip Inn. The future queen consort was working in advertising and had no idea that the man she was talking to at the bar was in fact the heir to the Danish throne. Someone came up to her later that evening and said, \"Do you know who these people are?\"\n\nTheir romance continued from there, and they eventually wed in 2004. They've stayed true to the roots of their relationship, attending many Olympic Games since 2004. King Frederik, who acceded to the throne in January 2024, was even inducted into the International Olympic Committee in 2009.\n\n14 of 14\n\nQueen Elizabeth Made a Memorable Appearance at the London Games\n\nWhen London hosted the Olympics in 2012, an appearance from Queen Elizabeth seemed inevitable. However, no one imagined that it would have been quite as epic as it turned out to be.\n\nIn a video broadcast during the opening ceremony, the Queen was escorted through Buckingham Palace by none other than James Bond, played by Daniel Craig, and a couple of corgis, then taken by helicopter to the Olympic Stadium. Stunt actors dressed up as the pair parachuted into the venue, and then Queen Elizabeth made her grand entrance to cheers.\n\nAngela Kelly, the late Queen’s trusted dresser and close confidant, later revealed that the royal \"was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately\" to take part in the skit.\n\n\"I asked then if she would like a speaking part,\" Kelly recalled in her book. \"Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: 'Of course, I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me.' \""
