The Medal is conferred upon civilians and non-commissioned military personnel. Although the Medal is related to the Royal Victorian Order, it differs in appearance and in the way it is worn.\n\nRecipients are permitted to use the post-nominal R.V.M. Names of the recipients are published in the The Canada Gazette."
