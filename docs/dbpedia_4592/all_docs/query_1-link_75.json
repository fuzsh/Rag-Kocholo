The successful prosecution, exposure and removal of these individuals from the U.S. represented one of the most successful counterintelligence operations in modern U.S. history.\n\nIn 2009, Walter Myers, a former State Department official, pleaded guilty in connection with a nearly 30-year conspiracy to provide classified information to Cuban intelligence agents and was later sentenced to life imprisonment. His wife, Gwendolyn Myers, also pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 81 months imprisonment.\n\nThe Department of Justice has prevented U.S. military and strategic technologies from falling into the wrong hands. In recent years, the Department has increased its multi-agency efforts to counter the ever-growing threat posed by the illegal foreign acquisition of controlled U.S. military and strategic technologies. These efforts have resulted in hundreds of investigations, indictments and arrests, as well numerous successful extraditions and the disruption of major international procurement networks, particularly those seeking U.S. munitions and sensitive technology for Iran and China. In recent years, roughly a third of the major export and embargo-related criminal prosecutions have involved the attempted transfer of controlled U.S. technology to Iran or China.\n\nIn February 2015, Mozaffar Khazaee, 60, formerly of Manchester, Connecticut, pleaded guilty violating the Arms Export Control Act, in connection with his efforts to send to Iran sensitive, proprietary, trade secret and export controlled material relating to military jet engines for the U.S. Air Force’s F35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the F-22 Raptor program, which he had stolen from defense contractors where he had previously been employed.\n\nIn October 2014, Dmitry Ustinov of Russia was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for conspiring to export high-tech military technology to Russia.\n\nIn October 2014, Robbins & Myers Belgium S.A., pleaded guilty to violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Export Administration Regulations for exporting drilling equipment to Syria.\n\nIn September 2014, Harold Rinko of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty to conspiring to illegally export laboratory equipment, including items used to detect chemical warfare agents, from the United States to Syria.\n\nIn July 2014, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico to violating the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) by scheming illegally to export defense articles with military application to the People’s Republic of China.\n\nIn 2012, a Canadian subsidiary of a major U.S. defense contractor pleaded guilty to criminal charges for exporting U.S.-origin military software to China for use in the development of China’s first modern military attack helicopter.\n\nIn October 2012, the Department disrupted a Russian procurement network in the United States that was illegally exporting U.S. microelectronics to Russian military and intelligence agencies.\n\nIn July 2012, the Department disrupted an international network conspiring to illegally export to Iran U.S.-origin materials for the construction of gas centrifuges to enrich uranium.\n\nIn 2011, Department efforts disrupted a network procuring U.S. components for illegal export to Iran, many of which later ended up in Improvised Explosive Devices in Iraq.\n\nThe Department of Justice has continued to identify and disrupt Narco-terrorist networks. Since 2009, the Department has continued to combat drug trafficking by those who use the profits to fund terrorist activities with a particular focus in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nExamples include:\n\nIn November 2013, DEA and foreign counterparts arrested Dino Bouterse, a citizen of Suriname, charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to Hezbollah. Hezbollah has long been connected to drug trafficking and money laundering. Bouterse is also the son of the current President of Suriname and was also previously charged with cocaine importation into the United States and brandishing a rocket launcher. Bouterse used his position to assist individuals he believed were members of Hezbollah. In exchange for a multimillion-dollar pay-off, Bouterse agreed to allow large numbers of purported Hezbollah operatives to use Suriname as a permanent base for, among other things, attacks on American targets. In furtherance of his efforts to assist Hezbollah, Bouterse supplied a false Surinamese passport for the purpose of making clandestine travel easier, including travel to the United States; began determining which heavy weapons he might provide to Hezbollah; and indicated how Hezbollah operatives, supplied with a Surinamese cover story, might enter the United States.\n\nIn April 2013, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) led an operation targeting Guinea Bissau's top military official, Antonio Indjai, and four of his co-conspirators. This criminal network conspired to provide aid to FARC by storing FARC-owned cocaine in West Africa and conspired to provide surface-to-air missiles to protect FARC cocaine processing operations in Colombia against U.S. military forces.\n\nIn addition to their trafficking ring, Indjai was also one of the main leaders in the April 2012 coup d'etat in Guinea Bissau. DEA's operation led to their arrests in a West African country and they will face justice in the United States.\n\nDEA's global presence allowed us to infiltrate a major international criminal group led by a former U.S. military member who oversaw a contract murder-for-hire network. Each of the three individuals arrested September 2012 and transferred to the United States had military experience either here or abroad. In addition to the murder-for-hire contract work they oversaw, these individuals conspired to: import cocaine into the United States; conspired to murder a DEA agent and a person assisting a law enforcement agent; conspired to kill a person to prevent communications to law enforcement agents; conspired to possess a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence; and conspired to distribute cocaine on board an aircraft.\n\nIn December 2009, three al Qaeda associates were arrested in Ghana for conspiracy to commit acts of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. This arrest marked the first time that associates of al Qaeda were charged with narco-terrorism offenses.\n\nThe Department leads the Afghanistan Threat Finance Center, an interagency effort to identify, disrupt and interdict the sources of funding for insurgent and terrorist organizations operating in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Department conducted a successful investigation that led to the arrest, extradition and conviction of Viktor Bout – one of the world's most notorious arms traffickers – for conspiring to sell weapons, including surface-to-air missile systems and armor piercing rocket launchers, to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated terrorist organization.\n\nLast Updated: March 2015\n\nReturn to Top\n\nProtecting the American People from Violent and Other Crimes\n\nViolent crime rates have steadily declined in the last five years as the Department has successfully prosecuted national, international gangs and traditional organized crime groups. The Department has aggressively pursued fighting traditional organized crime groups like La Cosa Nostra (LCN) while addressing evolving and emerging threats – from street gangs to transnational organized crime groups – which continue to pose significant threats to the safety and security of our communities.\n\nIn May 2013, the Department announced that three members of the Los Zetas Cartel – Julian Zapata Espinoza, aka “Piolin,” Ruben Dario Venegas Rivera, aka “Catracho,” and Jose Ismael Nava Villagran, aka “Cacho,” – pleaded guilty to the murder of ICE Special Agent Jaime Zapata and the attempted murder of ICE Special Agent Victor Avila in Mexico. A fourth co-conspirator, Los Zetas member Francisco Carbajal Flores, aka “Dalmata,” pleaded guilty to racketeering charges and as an accessory after the fact to the murder and attempted murder of the ICE agents.\n\nOn July 7, 2014, a six-month trial in Camden, New Jersey culminated in the conviction of Nicodemo S. Scarfo, a member of the Lucchese crime family of La Cosa Nostra (LCN) and Salvatore Pelullo, an associate of the Lucchese and Philadelphia LCN families. They were convicted of all the counts against them, including racketeering conspiracy and related offenses, as well as securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud, extortion, money laundering and obstruction of justice. Two other defendants, William and John Maxwell, were also convicted for their role in taking over a Texas corporation so the LCN members and their cohorts could steal from the company and make lavish personal purchases.\n\nSince the beginning of 2011, EOIR's Immigration Fraud Prevention Program has referred for investigation or provided support to federal and state authorities in dozens of civil and criminal cases involving the unauthorized practice of law, also known as notario fraud. In June 2011, the department, along with federal partners, launched the National Initiative to Combat Immigration Services Scams. The department has since convened a NotarioTask Force, which includes representatives from across the agency and meets to take action against notario fraud.\n\nOn April 24, 2014, the Department announced that Arturo Gallegos Castrellon, a/k/a “Benny,” was sentenced to life in prison following his conviction after trial for racketeering conspiracy, murder in aid of racketeering, and narcotics trafficking. Castrellon and 34 others were indicted in March 2011, having been charged as members and associates of Barrio Azteca, a violent, Juarez, Mexico transnational gang. The defendants were charged with RICO crimes related to murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to murder persons in a foreign country, narcotics trafficking, trafficking in stolen vehicles, kidnaping, obstruction of justice and money laundering. Castrellon and others were charged with the March 13, 2010 murder in Juarez, Mexico of U.S. Consulate employee Leslie Enriquez, her husband Arthur Redelfs, and Jorge Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another U.S. Consulate employee. All three were ambushed and shot to death after leaving a child’s birthday party. Of the 35 defendants charged, 26 were convicted, one committed suicide before the conclusion of his trial, and six are awaiting extradition. U.S. law enforcement officials are actively seeking to apprehend the two remaining fugitives in this case, including Eduardo Ravelo, an FBI Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitive.\n\nThroughout 2013 and 2014, the Department targeted the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas (ABT) with a series of indictments, including a 36-defendant indictment in late 2013. The ABT was a powerful, race-based Texas state-wide organization operating inside and outside state and federal prisons throughout the State of Texas and the United States. Through assault, murder and other acts of violence, ABT protected its criminal money-making enterprises, including narcotics trafficking, identity theft, counterfeiting, and check fraud, and also enforced internal discipline. These efforts culminated in the conviction of 73 ABT members and associates, on charges ranging from racketeering conspiracy, murder in aid of racketeering, narcotics trafficking, assault in aid of racketeering, firearms offenses, and obstruction of justice. This investigation and prosecution was extremely successful, convicting every high ranking member of the ABT and all but dismantling the entire criminal network.\n\nDepartment prosecutors have vigorously prosecuted the most notorious national and international violent gangs operating in U.S. cities and along the Southwest border, including:\n\nMS-13 in North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, Washington, D.C., Texas, New York and California;\n\nBloods in Nevada, Virginia and Tennessee;\n\nLatin Kings in Illinois, Texas, Maryland, North Carolina and Indiana.\n\nThe Department has successfully arrested and prosecuted large numbers of dangerous fugitives.\n\nSince 2009, the Department has:\n\nArrested 33 fugitives that have been featured on the USMS 15 Most Wanted list.\n\nArrested 930,050 fugitives and cleared 1,272,738 felony warrants.\n\nArrested 27,774 homicide suspects.\n\nArrested 29,012 gang members.\n\nDirected 22 targeted anti-gang initiatives that led to the arrest of 4,207 gang members.\n\nArrested 4,670 international and foreign fugitives.\n\nExtradited 5,532 fugitives to face justice.\n\nArrested 86,490 fugitive sex offenders, closing 113,024 sex offender warrants.\n\nInitiated 19,541 Adam Walsh Act investigations.\n\nRecovered 586 missing children in coordination with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and made 477 arrests in connection with those arrests.\n\nThe Department is working to hold accountable those responsible for the Deepwater Horizon Disaster. The Department is committed to holding accountable those who violated the law in connection with the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history.\n\nIn November 2012, the department reached the largest criminal resolution in U.S. history with BP. BP pleaded guilty to 11 felony manslaughter charges, environmental crimes, and obstruction of Congress and was sentenced to pay $4 billion in criminal fines and penalties.\n\nIn January 2013, Transocean Deepwater Inc. agreed to plead guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and paid a total of $1.4 billion in civil and criminal fines and penalties, for its conduct in relation to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, including a record-setting $1 billion to resolve Clean Water Act civil claims. Under the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act), eighty percent of the civil penalty received will be used to fund projects in and for the Gulf states for the environmental and economic benefit of the region.\n\nIn February 2012, the department announced an agreement with MOEX under, which MOEX paid $70 million in civil penalties to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Water Act and spent $20 million to facilitate land acquisition projects in several Gulf States to preserve and protect in perpetuity habitat and resources important to water quality.\n\nTestimony is complete in the first and second phases of the civil trial against BP and other defendants. On September 4, 2014, the court ruled on the issues tried in phase one and concluded – among other things – that gross negligence and willful misconduct by BPXP resulted in the explosion and blowout at Macondo Well and Deepwater Horizon, as well as the discharge of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. On January 15, 2015, the court ruled on phase 2 and found that 3.19 million barrels of oil flowed into the Guld of Mexico. These two rulings established the maximum possible pentalty that the court can assess against BPXP or Anadarko.\n\nThe next phase of trial—to determine a Clean Water Act civil penalty against Defendants BP and Anadarko—began on January 20 and concluded on February 2, 2015. Post-trial submissions to the court are scheduled to be completed by the end of April 2015.\n\nThe Department is using innovative law enforcement strategies to prosecute cyber and intellectual property crime. The Department has advanced the fight against intellectual property crime, which threatens the global economy and stifles innovation and creativity, as well as global cyber threats, which can disrupt critical infrastructure such as the power grid, nuclear power plants, financial and banking institutions, transportation systems and vital communication systems. Cybercrime also plays a key role in the theft of classified, personal identification information, and valuable intellectual property. The Department’s notable efforts include:\n\nDismantling an Extremely Damaging Botnet and Prosecuting its Administrator: In 2014, the Department led a multi-national effort to disrupt the Gameover Zeus Botnet – a global network of infected victim computers used by cyber criminals to steal millions of dollars from businesses and consumers – and unsealed criminal charges in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Omaha, Nebraska, against Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, a Russian national who served as an administrator of the botnet. In a related action, U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials worked together to seize computer servers central to the malicious software or “malware” known as Cryptolocker, a form of “ransomware” that encrypts the files on victims’ computers until they pay a ransom. The Department obtained court authorization for the FBI to provide victim information to Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) around the world and to private industry partners in a position to assist victims in ridding their computers of the Gameover Zeus malware.\n\nCreating Cybersecurity Unit: In the fall of 2014, the Criminal Division created the Cybersecurity Unit within the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section. The new unit will strive to ensure that cyber security legislation is shaped to most effectively protect our nation’s computer networks and individual victims from cyber attacks, engage in extensive outreach to facilitate cooperative relationships with our private sector, and serve as the central hub for expert advice and legal guidance regarding the criminal electronic surveillance statutes for both U.S. and international law enforcement conducting complex cyber investigations to ensure that the powerful law enforcement tools are effectively used to bring the perpetrators to justice while also protecting the privacy of every day Americans partners.\n\nProtecting the Military Supply Chain through Prosecution of an Importer of Counterfeit Parts: In 2014, the Department announced that Peter Picone, 41, of Methuen, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty in federal court in Connecticut to importing thousands of counterfeit integrated circuits from China and Hong Kong and then reselling them to U.S. customers, including contractors supplying them to the U.S. Navy for use in nuclear submarines. According to court filings, from 2007 through 2012, Picone conspired with his suppliers in China and Hong Kong to sell millions of dollars’ worth of integrated circuits bearing the counterfeit marks of approximately 35 major electronics manufacturers, including Motorola, Xilinx, and National Semiconductor. Federal agents searched Picone’s business and residence on April 24, 2012, and recovered 12,960 counterfeit integrated circuits.\n\nProsecuting the Ringleaders of a Major Point-of-Sale Hacking Scheme: In 2013, the Department completed the successful prosecutions of Adrian-Tiberiu Oprea, 29, of Constanta, Romania, and Iulian Dolan, 28, of Craiova, Romania, who were sentenced to serve 15 years and seven years in prison, respectively, for orchestrating an international, multimillion-dollar scheme to remotely hack into and steal payment card data from hundreds of U.S. merchants’ computers. The defendants and their co-conspirators hacked into several hundred U.S. merchants’ point-of-sale systems (the computers that process transactions when a customer uses a credit card for payment), including 250 Subway restaurant franchises. They stole payment card data belonging to more than 100,000 U.S. cardholders, causing losses of at least $17.5 million in unauthorized charges and remediation expenses. The case marked the first-ever extradition in a cybercrime case under the new extradition treaty with Romania.\n\nDisrupting and Prosecuting One of the Leading Online Copyright Piracy Enterprises: Federal law enforcement combined novel investigative techniques and superior advocacy skills to disrupt and prosecute the IMAGiNE group, the most far-reaching, prolific, and profitable groups illegally distributing copyrighted material on the Internet. IMAGiNE was responsible for the dissemination of up to 40 percent of the English-language content available for illegal download – in all, tens of thousands of copies of hundreds of new motion picture releases. The prosecution secured guilty pleas from the five leading members of the group and sentences ranging from 23 to 60 months. According to industry experts, the takedown of the IMAGiNE group produced an immediate and widespread disruption in illegal film-theft activity.\n\nThe Department has provided unprecedented support for state and local law enforcement partners. From 2009 to 2012, the Department provided $3.6 billion in Justice Assistance Grant funding, including $2 billion through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This critical funding supports states, local governments and tribes in meeting their most pressing criminal justice needs. Over the last four years, the Department’s efforts have helped create and save close to 8,000 law enforcement jobs. For example:\n\nThe 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act helped the Department support more than 1,000 law enforcement agencies throughout the country, awarding nearly $1 billion to fund the hiring of more than 3,800 new officers. The 2009 program also allowed awarded agencies to retain 881 positions that were in jeopardy of being cut.\n\nThe 2010 appropriation for COPS Hiring Grants funded 1,177 new law enforcement officer positions for a three-year grant term, plus saved 211 jobs nearly lost to cuts. In September 2011, the COPS Office awarded $243 million for nearly 1,021 law enforcement officer positions.\n\nIn June of 2012, COPS awarded $111 million to fund 600 new law enforcement positions, plus save an additional 200 positions in jeopardy of being cut. And in response to the Administration’s goal of providing new career opportunities for men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, the COPS Office required that all new hires funded through the 2012 Hiring Program must be recent military veterans.\n\nTo date, the COPS Office has funded the addition of more than 126,000 community policing officers across the country.\n\nIn September of 2013, the COPS Office awarded $127 million in CHP grants to 266 law enforcement agencies to hire and/or rehire 955 full-time career law enforcement officers. Under the 2011 and 2012 program, the COPS Office provided nearly $60 million in hiring funds to agencies that identified the need for school-based policing. In FY2013, 144 grantees committed to deploying 370 SRO positions through school-based policing.\n\nIn September of 2014, the COPS Office awarded $123 million in CHP grants to 215 law enforcement agencies to hire or rehire 944 full-time career law enforcement officers. Under the CHP 2014 program the COPS Office added the topic area of Trust Problems to assist with addressing issues of fairness and impartiality, transparency problems, respect problems, and other trust-related problems.\n\nIn October of 2014 the COPS Office awarded just over $6 million in CAMP grant funds to 10 state law enforcement agencies. The COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Program (CAMP) was designed to advance public safety by providing funding directly to state law enforcement agencies to investigate illicit activities related to the manu¬facture and distribution of methamphetamine.\n\nThe Department has shared more than $1.2 billion in forfeited assets and proceeds with state and local law enforcement agencies and distributed more than $880 million to claimants and victims of crime.\n\nThe Department has revamped and streamlined the process for tribes to apply for funding through the Coordinated Tribal Assistance Solicitation (CTAS). From FY 2009 through 2013, the Department has awarded 1,158 CTAS grants to hundreds of American Indian and Alaskan Native communities totaling more than $525 million.\n\nThe Department has supported public safety partnerships that maximize resources and adopt evidence-based practices that are backed by data and research. Through the Smart Policing Initiative, the Office of Justice Programs’ Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) funds innovative collaborations between law enforcement agencies and research institutions in 32 cities.\n\nThe COPS Office has convened national leaders and experts around a wide range of critical law enforcement topics, including relationships between labor and management, body-worn cameras, policing the new economy and the implementation of procedural justice and values-based policing. The Office has also convened leaders around efforts to strengthen relationships between law enforcement and communities of color. This convening function represents a powerful way to quickly assemble leading practitioners and thinkers to help identify crucial issues and make recommendations to the profession.\n\nThe COPS Office Training Program on Fair and Impartial Policing has been provided to over 250 agencies across the nation. This training focuses on the presence of implicit biases linked to ethnicity and race, gender, social class, sexual orientation, religion, body shape, age, and so forth. The training makes personnel aware of their unconscious biases and gives them the skills to activate controlled responses to counteract them. Understanding how human biases can impact officers’ behavior and learning the skills to recognize biases and override their impact is critical to safe, effective, and just policing.\n\nThe Department has made an unprecedented commitment to ensuring officer safety. In response to a rise in deadly assaults on our nation’s law enforcement officers, the Department has dedicated funding resources, training and research to protecting those who protect our communities. These efforts have led to increased vigilance and training, helping to decrease officer fatalities by approximately 25 percent since 2011. For example:\n\nAs law enforcement officer deaths spiked in 2010, the Department provided more than $25 million to law enforcement agencies to purchase more than 88,000 bullet-resistant vests. Since 1999, the BVP program has reimbursed more than 13,000 jurisdictions, a total of $277 million in federal funds for the purchase of over one million vests (1,084,081 as of October 17, 2012). In 2012, body armor saved the lives of at least 33 law enforcement and corrections officers. At least 13 of those life-saving vests had been purchased, in part, with BVP funds,\n\nDeveloped as part of the Attorney General’s law enforcement officer safety initiative, the VALOR program provides critical training and technical assistance to law enforcement on preventing violence against officers—and ensuring officer resilience and survivability following violent encounters. Since the program’s inception in 2010, VALOR has trained more than 8,800 law enforcement professionals and disseminated more than 8,000 Officer Safety toolkits.\n\nIn 2011, the Department initiated the national Officer Safety and Wellness (OSW) Group. The OSW Group brings together law enforcement leaders and criminal justice practitioners to share their broad perspectives on improving officer safety and wellness. The OSW Group continues to meet and discuss best practices and develop recommendations on a range of safety and wellness issues which are disseminated to the field, and both the COPS Office and BJA have produced related reports and resources which are available on their websites.\n\nThe Department has included officer assistance and support provisions in consent decrees seeking police department reform in New Orleans, Albuquerque and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Department is supporting effective prisoner reentry and reinvestment programs.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2013, the Department awarded $62 million Second Chance Act grants to help incarcerated adults and youth rejoin their communities and become productive, law abiding citizens. These grants to state, tribal and local governments and non-profit organizations support reentry strategies that include not only evidence-based corrections and supervision strategies, but also employment assistance, housing, mentoring, substance abuse treatment, family programming and other services designed to reduce recidivism. They also support important research.\n\nFor example, a RAND Corporation’s analysis of correctional education research found that employment after release was 13 percent higher among prisoners who participated in either academic or vocational education programs than among those who did not. Those who participated in vocational training were 28 percent more likely to be employed after release from prison than those who did not receive such training.\n\nThe 20 federal agencies of the Federal Interagency Reentry Council, created by the Attorney General in 2011, continue to find concrete ways to remove employment and other barriers to successful reentry. Over the last year, agencies have worked together to assist children of incarcerated parents, improve access to education, employment, housing and health care, and reduce the collateral consequences of a criminal record.\n\nFor example, the “National Inventory of the Collateral Consequences of Conviction” website, launched with Department support, identifies about 35,000 statutes and regulations that impose collateral consequences, or additional punishments, on people convicted of crimes. The website allows searching by state, consequence type, triggering offense category and a number of other salient characteristics. In a related effort, the Attorney General asked Reentry Council agencies to review their regulations with an eye to how and where certain barriers can be eliminated or tailored without compromising public safety. The Department undertook this analysis as well, and as part of his “Smart on Crime” initiative, the Attorney General issued a memorandum directing all Department of Justice components to take collateral consequences into account when proposing any new regulation or guidance.\n\nUnder the banner of Justice Reinvestment, the Justice Department is helping to bring about criminal justice system reforms by reducing corrections spending and reinvesting in public safety strategies. In late January 2014, the BJA-funded Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI) State Assessment Report will be released. The report is the result of a public-private partnership with the Pew Charitable Trusts, and describes the progress, challenges, and preliminary outcomes of 17 JRI states from 2010 to summer 2013. This report demonstrates that while it is too early to assess the full impact of justice reinvestment reforms, states have enacted policies that hold promise in reducing prison populations or averting future growth, generating savings while enhancing public safety. In addition to population changes, justice reinvestment has encouraged states to undergo a cultural shift toward greater collaboration, using data to drive decision-making and increased use of evidence-based practices.\n\nLast Updated: March 2015\n\nReturn to Top\n\nProtecting Taxpayer Dollars and Consumers Against Financial Fraud While Ensuring Competitive Markets\n\nThe Department has investigated and held accountable those responsible for financial fraud. In 2009, President Obama created the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to hold accountable those who helped bring about the last financial crisis. Since its formation:\n\nTask Force members have charged a record number of mortgage fraud-related cases, trained more than 100,000 professionals responsible for awarding and overseeing Recovery Act funds, and held regional summits around the country to discuss strategies, resources and initiatives, as well as to meet with communities most affected by the financial crisis.\n\nIn 2012, as part of the Task Force, the Attorney General launched the Consumer Protection Working Group, consisting of federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local partners, to confront and combat, through prosecution and education, consumer-related fraud, including schemes targeting vulnerable populations, such as the unemployed, those in need of payday loans, and the elderly. The working group also focuses on scams that exploit those in search of government grants and other federal assistance through telemarketing and use of third-party payment processors, which also can threaten the safety and soundness of our financial institutions, as well as active-duty military and veterans.\n\nIn addition, the Department plays a leadership role in the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (“RMBS”) Working Group of the Task Force. This Working Group has secured three record-breaking settlements in the last two years. The settlements with Bank of America for $16.65 billion, Citigroup for $7 billion, and JPMorgan for $13 billion resolved federal and state civil claims against these institutions relating to the packaging, marketing, sale and issuance of RMBS. In addition to penalties, the settlements require significant consumer relief commitments that will assist homeowners.\n\nIn FY 2014, the Department announced a series of settlements in financial fraud cases relating to mortgage origination and/or servicing practices of three large lenders – U.S. Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Metlife Bank, and SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. These four settlements resulted in recoveries of over $1.9 billion to resolve federal and, in the latter matter, state claims. In addition, the Department has filed suit against Wells Fargo Bank and Kurt Lofrano, a bank Vice President, for engaging in faulty underwriting. The financial practices of these institutions caused significant losses for a Federal Housing Administration insurance fund.\n\nIn February 2015, the Department announced a $1.375 billion settlement with Standard & Poor’s. The groundbreaking, largest-of-its kind agreement resolved the Department’s 2013 lawsuit against S&P, along with parallel lawsuits filed by 19 states and the District of Columbia. Each of the lawsuits alleged that investors incurred substantial losses on Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities and Collateralized Debt Obligations, financial instruments that were at the heart of the financial crisis, for which S&P issued inflated ratings. Other allegations asserted that S&P falsely represented that its ratings were objective, independent and uninfluenced by S&P’s business relationships with the investment banks that issued the securities.\n\nOn October 24, 2012, the Department filed a $1 billion civil mortgage fraud lawsuit against Bank of America Corporation and its predecessors Countrywide Financial Corporation and Countrywide Home Loans Inc. for engaging in a scheme to defraud the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), causing more than $1 billion in losses and countless foreclosures. The case was tried to a jury in September and October of 2013. The jury found for the United States, entering its verdict on November 15, 2013. On July 30, 2014, after extensive post-trial briefing, the Court assessed a $1.2 billion civil penalty against the defendant companies under the Financial Institutions Reforms, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) and a $1 million FIRREA civil penalty against Rebecca Mairone, the Chief Operating Officer of the bank’s Full Spectrum Lending division. The bank is expected to appeal the decision.\n\nIn criminal matters, members of the Task Force have, in the past three years alone, prosecuted and secured convictions of dozens of corporate and individual defendants involved in securities fraud and related investment fraud, mortgage fraud and Ponzi schemes. These include, among others, the following:\n\nLloyds Banking Group plc, which entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice on July 28, 2014 to pay an $86 million penalty for manipulation of submissions for the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a leading global benchmark interest rate.\n\nRBS Securities Japan Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS) that engages in investment banking operations with its principal place of business in Tokyo, Japan, which, on January 6, 2014, was sentenced to pay a $50 million fine for its role in manipulating the Japanese Yen LIBOR. In addition, RBS plc, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based parent company of RBS Securities Japan, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government requiring RBS plc to pay an additional $100 million penalty.\n\nCoöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. (Rabobank), which entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice on October 29, 2013 to pay a $325 million penalty to resolve violations arising from Rabobank's submissions for LIBOR and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor). A criminal information was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA). The information charged Rabobank with wire fraud for its role in manipulating LIBOR and Euribor. In addition to the $325 million penalty, the DPA required the bank to admit and accept responsibility for its misconduct as described in an extensive statement of facts and required Rabobank's cooperation with the Justice Department in its ongoing investigation. Together with approximately $740 million in criminal and regulatory penalties imposed by other agencies in actions arising out of the same conduct by Rabobank, the Justice Department's $325 million criminal penalty brought the total amount to be paid by Rabobank to more than $1 billion.\n\nFormer Rabobank Japanese Yen derivatives trader, Takayuki Yagami, who pleaded guilty on June 10, 2014 for his role in a conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud by manipulating Rabobank’s Yen LIBOR submissions to benefit his trading positions.\n\nTwo Rabobank derivative traders, Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti, who, on October 16, 2014, were charged in a superseding indictment for their alleged roles in a scheme to manipulate the U.S. Dollar and Yen LIBOR. Additionally, former traders Tetsuya Motomura, Paul Thompson and Paul Robson, were charged in a prior indictment. Robson pled guilty to one count of the indictment on August 18, 2014.\n\nUBS Securities Japan Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS AG, which was sentenced on September 18, 2013 for its role in manipulating LIBOR. UBS Securities Japan pleaded guilty on Dec. 19, 2012, to one count of engaging in a scheme to defraud counterparties to interest rate derivative trades by secretly manipulating LIBOR benchmark interest rates, and agreed, in connection with that plea, to pay a $100 million fine. In addition, UBS AG, the Zurich-based parent company of UBS Securities Japan, agreed, as part of a non-prosecution agreement, to pay an additional $400 million penalty, to admit and accept responsibility for its misconduct as set forth in an extensive statement of facts, and to continue cooperating with the Justice Department in its ongoing investigation. Together with approximately $1 billion in regulatory penalties and disgorgement, the Justice Department's criminal penalties brought the total amount of the resolution to more than $1.5 billion.\n\nTwo former derivatives brokers and a former cash broker employed by London-based brokerage firm ICAP, who were criminally charged on September 25, 2013. Darrell Read, who resides in New Zealand, and Daniel Wilkinson and Colin Goodman, both of England, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of wire fraud in a criminal complaint in Manhattan federal court alleging that the three defendants executed a sustained and systematic scheme to move Japanese Yen LIBOR in a direction favorable to the trading positions of their trading desk's largest client, a senior trader at UBS AG in Tokyo.\n\nDon Langford, the former senior vice president and chief credit officer of TierOne Bank, and James A. Laphen, the former president and chief operating officer, who pled guilty in September 2014 and December 2014, respectively, to defrauding TierOne’s shareholders and submitting false statements to TierOne’s regulators about the bank’s loan portfolio and other assets. In addition, Gilbert G. Lundstrom, TierOne’s former CEO, was indicted in December 2014 for his role in the fraud.\n\nTerry Kretz, the former chief executive officer of Hanover Financial, LLC (Hanover), who, in August 2014, was sentenced to 168 months in prison, and was ordered to both forfeit and pay restitution of $14.7 million following his guilty plea for his role in orchestrating a Ponzi scheme to defraud investors. In addition, two co-defendants, Daryl Bornstein, a former salesman for Hanover, and Robert Haley, the former Hanover chief financial officer, were also convicted, and sentenced in January 2014 to 60 months and 70 months in prison, respectively.\n\nConvergEx Group, LLC, an institutional brokerage firm, which, in December 2013, agreed to pay $18 million, forfeit $12 million, and pay $12.7 million in restitution, for inflating commissions that were charged to customers when executing the orders, and then forging trading confirms and data to conceal the extent of the inflated commissions.\n\nJonathan Daspin, the head trader at CGM Limited, and Thomas Lekargeren, a sales trader at a ConvergEx broker-dealer subsidiary, who pleaded guilty in December 2013 for their roles in the ConvergEx fraud described above.\n\nArthroCare Corporation, a medical device manufacturer, which entered into an agreement with the Department to pay a $30 million penalty for engaging in a $750 million accounting fraud to manipulate the company’s revenue and earnings as reported to investors. In addition, Michael Baker, ArthroCare’s former chief executive officer, and Michael Gluk, ArthroCare’s former chief financial officer, were convicted in June 2014 after a jury trial, and were sentenced in August 2014, to 20 years’ imprisonment and 10 years’ imprisonment, respectively.\n\nFormer UBS AG executives, Peter Ghavami, Gary Heinz and Michael Welty, who, on July 24, 2013, were sentenced to serve time in prison for their participation in frauds related to bidding for contracts for the investment of municipal bond proceeds and other municipal finance contracts. Ghavami was sentenced to serve 18 months in prison and to pay a $1 million criminal fine; Heinz was sentenced to serve 27 months in prison and to pay a $400,000 criminal fine; and Welty was sentenced to serve 16 months in prison and to pay a $300,000 criminal fine.\n\nScott N. Powers, the former CEO of Arizona-based mortgage loan originator American Mortgage Specialists Inc. (AMS), and David McMaster, a former officer of AMS, who, on June 28, 2013, were sentenced to serve 96 and 188 months in prison, respectively, for their roles in a $28 million scheme to defraud North Dakota-based BNC National Bank.\n\nThe CEO of Axius Inc. Roland Kaufmann, who was sentenced on June 14, 2013 to serve 16 months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of $450,000 for his role in a conspiracy to bribe purported stock brokers and manipulate the Axius stock.\n\nTop executives at Virginia's Bank of the Commonwealth, including CEO and Board Chairman Edward Woodard, who were convicted on May 24, 2013 for masking non-performing assets at the bank for their personal benefit. This long-running scheme contributed to the failure of the bank in 2011, which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated would cost the FDIC deposit-insurance fund approximately $268 million.\n\nGlen Alan Ward, a 12-year federal fugitive, who pleaded guilty on April 8, 2013 to aggravated identity theft and bankruptcy fraud in connection with leading a nearly 15-year foreclosure-rescue scam where he collected more than $1.2 million from more than 800 distressed homeowners and fraudulently postponed foreclosure sales for those homeowners.Rajat Gupta, chairman of an international consulting firm and member of the boards of directors at Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, who was sentenced on October 24, 2012 to two years in prison for participating in an insider trading scheme in which he provided confidential information about Goldman Sachs to his business partner and friend, Raj Rajaratnam.\n\nShawn L.

The Department of Justice has made ensuring a level playing field for all qualified borrowers – regardless of race, national origin, or other protected class status – a top priority. In 2010, the Fair Lending Unit was created in the Civil Rights Division to focus on these issues. Since then, the Department has filed or resolved 35 lending matters, including matters protecting the rights of servicemembers, and the settlements in these matters provide for approximately $1.2 billion in monetary relief for individual borrowers and impacted communities.\n\nIn February 2015, the Department filed its first settlement of a case involving allegations of reverse redlining against two Charlotte-area buy here, pay here dealerships and their owner for intentionally targeting African-American customers for unfair and predatory credit practices in the financing of used car purchases.\n\nIn June 2014, the Department filed the largest credit card discrimination settlement in history to resolve allegations that Synchrony Bank, formerly known as GE Capital Retail Bank, discriminated on the basis of national origin by excluding Hispanic borrowers from two of its credit card debt repayment programs. The Department’s investigation was conducted jointly with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The settlement provides $169 million in relief to approximately 108,000 borrowers in the form of monetary payments and the reduction, or complete waiver, of borrowers’ credit card balances.\n\nIn December 2013, the Department announced the government’s largest-ever auto discrimination settlement with Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank to resolve allegations that the lender discriminated against African-American, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander borrowers by charging them higher interest rates on auto loans as compared to white borrowers. The Department’s investigation was conducted jointly with the CFPB. Pursuant to the settlement, Ally will pay $80 million to minority victims of discrimination and an $18 million civil monetary penalty to the CFPB. Ally also must refund discriminatory overcharges to borrowers for the next three years unless it significantly reduces disparities in unjustified interest rate markups.\n\nIn July 2012, the Department filed the second-largest fair lending settlement in its history to resolve allegations that Wells Fargo Bank, the largest residential home mortgage originator in the United States, engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its mortgage lending from 2004 through 2009. The settlement provides at least $184.3million in compensation for borrowers who were steered into subprime mortgages or who paid higher fees and rates than white borrowers because of their race or national origin. Wells Fargo will also provide $50 million in direct down payment assistance to borrowers in communities around the country where the Department identified large numbers of discrimination victims and which were hard hit by the housing crisis. As of February 2015, 98 percent of the settlement fund has been distributed to affected borrowers.\n\nIn March 2012, the Department played a major role in securing the largest joint federal-state settlement ever - $25 billion – against the nation’s five largest mortgage servicers for robo-signing and other mortgage servicing abuses through substantial financial penalties and extensive consumer relief.\n\nIn December 2011, the Department announced the largest-ever fair lending settlement - $335 million - with Countrywide Financial Corporation to resolve allegations that Countrywide and its subsidiaries engaged in a widespread pattern or practice of discrimination against more than 200,000 qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers in mortgage lending from 2004 through 2008. As of February 2015, 91 percent of the settlement fund has been distributed to affected borrowers.\n\nThe process of victim identification, location, and compensation in the Department’s fair lending resolutions is ongoing. Still, individual borrowers already have received checks for over 90 percent of the $550 million in fair lending settlements between 2011 and 2013.\n\nThe Department has vigorously enforced the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). The SCRA serves to postpone, suspend, terminate or reduce the amount of certain civil obligations so that members of the armed forces can focus their full attention on their military or professional responsibilities without adverse consequences for themselves or their families. Since May 2011, the Department has reached eight settlements with mortgage servicers for foreclosing on servicemembers in violation of the SCRA, including settlements with the five largest mortgage servicers in conjunction with the National Mortgage Settlement. In most circumstances under these settlements, servicemembers who were foreclosed on in violation of the law will receive a minimum of $125,000 plus compensation for lost equity. We expect the National Mortgage Settlement for illegal foreclosures and illegal interest rates under the SCRA will provide approximately $200 million in relief for servicemembers, and in January 2015, the Department announced that mortgage servicers were distributing $123 million to 952 servicemembers for non-judicial foreclosures that violated the SCRA. In May 2014, the Department announced the government’s first SCRA case involving student loans -- a $60 million settlement with Sallie Mae for unlawfully failing to reduce the interest rate on servicemembers’ pre-service student loans to 6%. This decree was entered by the court on September 29, 2014.\n\nThe Department launched innovative programs to stop fraud in the residential mortgage-backed securities market. In 2012, the Attorney General launched the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) Working Group to maximize the impact of parallel efforts between federal and state law enforcement agencies to focus on fraud in the packaging and sale of RMBS offerings. This working group collaborates on future and current investigations, pools resources and streamlines processes to ensure that when misconduct occurs, justice is sought for the victims. So far, RMBS Working Group members have announced several law enforcement actions including:\n\nOn February 3, 2015, the Department of Justice announced a $1.375 billion settlement agreement with the rating agency Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC to resolve allegations that S&P had engaged in a scheme to defraud investors in structured financial products known as Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). The agreement resolves the department’s 2013 lawsuit against S&P, along with the suits of 19 states and the District of Columbia. Each of the lawsuits allege that investors incurred substantial losses on RMBS and CDOs for which S&P issued inflated ratings that misrepresented the securities’ true credit risks. Other allegations assert that S&P falsely represented that its ratings were objective, independent and uninfluenced by S&P’s business relationships with the investment banks that issued the securities.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, the Department of Justice announced a $16.65 billion settlement with Bank of America Corporation – the largest civil settlement with a single entity in American history – to resolve federal and state claims against Bank of America and its former and current subsidiaries, including Countrywide Financial Corporation and Merrill Lynch. As part of this global resolution, the bank agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) – the largest FIRREA penalty ever – and provide billions of dollars of relief to struggling homeowners, including funds that will help defray tax liability as a result of mortgage modification, forbearance or forgiveness.\n\nIn July 2014, the Department reached a $7 billion settlement with Citigroup Inc. to resolve federal and state civil claims related to Citigroup’s conduct in the packaging, securitization, marketing, sale and issuance of RMBS between 2006 and 2007. The resolution included a $4 billion civil penalty – the largest penalty to date under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) – and requires Citigroup to provide relief to underwater homeowners, distressed borrowers, and affected communities.\n\nOn November 19, 2013, the Justice Department secured a record $13 billion global settlement with JPMorgan - the largest settlement with a single entity in American history – to resolve federal and state civil claims arising out of the packaging, marketing, sale and issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual prior to Jan. 1, 2009. As part of the settlement, JPMorgan acknowledged it made serious misrepresentations to the public - including the investing public - about numerous RMBS transactions. The resolution also requires JPMorgan to provide much needed relief to underwater homeowners and potential homebuyers, including those in distressed areas of the country.\n\nIn August 2013, the Justice Department, as part of the ongoing work of the RMBS Working Group, filed a civil lawsuit against Bank of America Corporation and certain of its affiliates (BOA) for defrauding investors in connection with the sale of more than $850 million of RMBS. The complaint alleges BOA lied to investors about the relative riskiness of the mortgage loans backing the RMBS, made false statements after intentionally not performing proper due diligence and filled the securitization with a disproportionate amount of risky mortgages originated through third party mortgage brokers.\n\nIn November 2012, Working Group Co-Chair, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a Martin Act complaint against Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and its affiliates for making fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions to promote the sale of RMBS to investors.\n\nAlso in November 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a RMBS Working Group partner, charged J.P. Morgan Securities LLC with misleading investors in offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities.\n\nAt the same time, the SEC also announced charges against Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC with misleading investors in offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities. SEC Acting Director of Enforcement George Canellos is an RMBS Working Group Co-Chair.\n\nBoth JP Morgan and Credit Suisse agreed to settlements with the SEC in which they will pay more than $400 million combined, and the SEC plans to distribute the money to harmed investors.\n\nIn October 2012, New York Attorney General Schneiderman filed a Martin Act lawsuit against J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (formerly known as Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.), JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., and EMC Mortgage LLC (formerly known as EMC Mortgage Corporation) for making fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions to promote the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities to investors.\n\nThe Department has successfully prosecuted international cartels and domestic collusion conspiracies: The Department has prosecuted corporations and individuals engaged in price fixing, bid rigging, market and customer allocation, and other fraud that hurts the American consumer. Since January 2009, 365 criminal cases have been filed and more than $4.9 billion in criminal fines have been obtained. In the period 2010-2014, the average prison sentence in division cases was 25 months, up from 20 months in the period 2000-2009. Charges were brought in a variety of important industries, including financial services, auto parts, liquid crystal display (LCD), air transportation, real estate, coastal shipping and environmental services. Results include:\n\nAs a result of the Antitrust Division’s ongoing investigation into price fixing and bid rigging in the auto parts industry, to date, 32 corporations and 48 executives have been charged resulting in more than $2.4 billion in criminal fines–including the second and third largest criminal fines ever and landmark prison sentences against the culpable executives.\n\nAfter a successful conviction of Taiwan-based AU Optronics, its Houston-based subsidiary, and former top executives for their involvement in a price-fixing conspiracy involving LCD panels, for the first time ever, a jury determined that the conspirators’ gain from their illegal conduct was at least $500 million, raising the potential fine for each company above the statutory maximum of $100 million. AU Optronics was sentenced to pay a $500 million fine, matching the largest fine ever imposed against a company for violating the U.S. antitrust laws. On July 10, 2014, the Ninth Circuit affirmed these convictions along with the $500 million fine.\n\nThe division’s ongoing investigation into the municipal bond industry to date has resulted in charges against 20 former industry executives, and nearly $750 million in restitution, penalties and disgorgement to federal and state agencies was obtained through settlements with UBS, Wachovia Bank, JP Morgan Chase, GE Funding Capital, and Bank of America. To date, 17 financial services executives and one corporation have been convicted, including three former UBS executives who were convicted at trial for their roles in conspiracies involving investment contracts for the proceeds of municipal bonds.\n\nAs part of the division’s commitment to combat financial fraud, the investigation of collusion in the U.S. real estate market has resulted in charges against 100 individuals and three companies engaged in collusive schemes aimed at eliminating competition at real estate foreclosure auctions. Following a four-week trial, the Division obtained convictions against Andrew B. Katakis and Donald M. Parker March 11, 2014.\n\nAdditional efforts to root out financial fraud have led to charges against 16 individuals and five companies as part of an ongoing investigation into bid rigging and fraud related to municipal tax lien auctions in New Jersey. To date, 12 individuals and three companies have pleaded guilty.\n\nThe division’s ongoing investigation into conspiratorial conduct in the market for coastal water freight transportation services has resulted in three companies and six individuals pleading guilty or being convicted at trial and $46 million in criminal fines. The individuals who pleaded guilty were sentenced to jail terms ranging from seven months to five years, the longest sentence ever imposed for a single count violation of the Sherman Act. Trial against a seventh individual is scheduled for January 2015.\n\nIn the LIBOR (London InterBank Offered Rate)/Euribor investigation, the Division, in conjunction with the Criminal Division, obtained a conviction against Rabobank, which agreed to pay $325 million in criminal penalties, and, more recently, a conviction against Lloyds Banking Group plc, which agreed to pay $86 million in criminal penalties The Division also filed criminal charges against eight former traders and three former brokers for their roles in manipulating LIBOR and/or Euribor benchmark interest rates. In all, the Division has obtained $561 million in criminal fines and penalties in this ongoing investigation, and the total global criminal and regulatory fines, penalties, and disgorgement obtained by enforcement authorities is over $4 billion. The broader investigation relating to LIBOR and other benchmark rates has required, and has greatly benefited from, a diligent and wide-ranging cooperative effort among various enforcement agencies both in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe Antitrust Division achieved its first successfully litigated extradition on an antitrust charge. Romano Pisciotti, an Italian national and a former manager of Parker ITR S.r.l.’s Oil & Gas Business Unit, a rubber hose manufacturer, was arrested in Germany and was extradited on April 3, 2014, for participating in a conspiracy to rig bids, fix prices and allocate market shares of marine hose sold in the United States and elsewhere. He pleaded guilty to a one-count felony indictment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Ft. Lauderdale and was sentenced to serve two years in prison and to pay a $50,000 criminal fine.\n\nJohn Bennett, a Canadian national, was extradited from Canada on November 14, 2014 on a charge of participating in a conspiracy to pay kickbacks and commit fraud at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-designated Superfund site Federal Creosote, located in Manville, New Jersey. He was also charged with a related count for major fraud against the United States related to contracts obtained at site. Bennett was the former Chief Executive Officer with Bennett Environmental Inc., a Canadian-based company that treated and disposed of contaminated soil. According to the indictment, Bennett provided kickbacks to Gordon McDonald, the project manager at the Federal Creosote site, in order to influence the award of sub-contracts at the site and inflate the prices charged to the EPA by the prime contractor. McDonald, a former project manager for a prime contractor at both Federal Creosote and Diamond Alkali, in Newark, was convicted of engaging in separate bid-rigging, kickback and fraud conspiracies with three subcontractors in return for kickbacks of more than $1.5 million. He was also convicted of engaging in an international money laundering scheme, major fraud against the United States, committing two tax violations and obstruction of justice. On March 3, 2014, McDonald, was sentenced to serve the longest prison sentence ever imposed involving an antitrust crime ­­-- 14 years in prison -- for participating in multiple bid-rigging, fraud and kickback schemes.\n\nThe Department has prevented anticompetitive mergers and preserved market competition: Since 2009, the Department has challenged 80 anticompetitive mergers, including transactions in the consumer goods, transportation, technology, and telecommunications industries, and challenged 29 civil non-merger matters, focusing on contracting practices that reduced competition in industries such as health care, credit card network services, e-books and high-tech employment. Notable merger cases and issues include:\n\nRequiring US Airways and American Airlines to divest facilities at seven key airports to enhance system-wide competition and settle the department's merger challenge. Divestitures at airports in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and near Washington, D.C., open the door for competition resulting in more choices and more competitive airfares for consumers.\n\nSuing to challenge Bazaarvoice's consummated acquisition of PowerReviews, a transaction that combined the dominant commercial supplier of ratings and reviews platforms in the United States with its closest rival—the court found that the merger was likely to extinguish price competition and substantially diminish the pace of innovation in that market. A settlement requiring Bazaarvoice to divest the assets it acquired from PowerReviews and adhere to other requirements to fully restore competition is pending with the court.\n\nRequiring ConAgra Foods, Cargill, CHS, and Horizon Milling to divest four competitively significant flour mills to Miller Milling in order to proceed with the formation of Ardent Mills, a flour milling joint venture, preserving flour milling competition in four regions of the country encompassing large cities such as Los Angeles, Dallas, Minneapolis, and the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area.\n\nInforming the parties that the Antitrust Division would file a lawsuit seeking to block the planned acquisition by Louisiana-Pacific of Ainsworth Lumber, preserving competition in the market for the production of oriented strand board sold to customers in the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest regions of the United States.\n\nRequiring Anheuser-Busch InBev and Grupo Modelo to divest Modelo's entire U.S. business – including licenses of Model brand beers, its most advanced brewery, Piedras Negras, its interest in Crown Imports LLC and other assets – to Constellation Brands Inc., in order to go forward with their merger. The remedy maintains competition in the beer industry nationwide.\n\nBlocking the H&R Block Inc./TaxACT deal—the Antitrust Division's first merger case litigated to judgment successfully since 2003.\n\nSuing to block AT&T Inc.'s proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA Inc.—the companies ultimately abandoned the proposed deal, resulting in a victory for consumers.\n\nRequiring structural and/or behavioral conditions on transactions, such as Ticketmaster/LiveNation, Google/ITA, International Paper/Temple-Inland, and Comcast/NBCU, remedying the competitive harm to consumers while allowing the companies to proceed with their transactions in a way that did not threaten competition.\n\nObtaining full relief in the UTC/Goodrich merger, the largest aircraft industry merger ever. This case featured close coordination with the European Commission.\n\nRequiring Humana and Arcadian Management Services to divest Arcadian's Medicare Advantage health insurance plans in 51 counties across Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. The divestitures preserve competition so that Medicare beneficiaries, primarily senior citizens, benefit from lower prices, better quality, and more innovative products for their health care needs.\n\nChallenging a tour bus joint venture, Twin America, formed by two companies that had competed head-to-head in the provision of \"hop-on, hop-off\" bus tour services in New York City.\n\nNotable civil, non-merger cases and issues include:\n\nLawsuit against American Express, MasterCard and Visa, challenging their rules restricting price competition. The department reached a settlement with Visa and MasterCard, and trial against American Express began on July 7.\n\nJoint policy statement with the Federal Trade Commission issued in April 2014 makes clear that properly designed threat information sharing is not likely to raise antitrust concerns and can help secure the nation's networks of information and resources. The policy statement is designed to reduce uncertainty for those who want to share information to prevent and combat cyberattacks.\n\nLawsuit and resulting settlement reached with eBay that prevents the company from entering into or maintaining agreements with other companies restraining employee recruitment and hiring, substantially the settlement as those reached with Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, and Pixar in September 2010, and with Lucasfilm in December 2010.\n\nLawsuit and a three-week trial, after which a court found that Apple Inc. violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by conspiring to raise e-book prices and end e-book retailers' freedom to compete on price. The department's remedy requires Apple to modify its agreements with five publishers – Hachette Book Group (USA), HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Simon & Schuster Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and Holtzbrinck Publishers, LLC (which does business as Macmillan)–provides for a court-appointed external monitor, includes anti-retaliatory provisions to protect publishers and prohibits Apple from engaging in future anticompetitive conduct.\n\nSettlement reached with five book publishers–Hachette Book Group (USA), HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Simon & Schuster Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and Holtzbrinck Publishers LLC (which does business as Macmillan)–for conspiring to end e-book retailers' freedom to compete on price, take control of pricing from e-book retailers and substantially increase the prices that consumers pay for e-books.\n\nLawsuit and resulting settlement with United Regional Health Care System—the first case brought by the Department since 1999 challenging a monopolist with engaging in traditional anticompetitive unilateral conduct.\n\nSettlement with Morgan Stanley that requires it to pay $4.8 million for violating the antitrust laws by entering into an agreement with KeySpan Corporation that restrained competition in the New York City electricity capacity market.\n\nThe Department has established the most effective strike force in history to protect Medicare money: In 2009, the Attorney General and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary announced the creation of the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) and renewed their commitment to fighting health care fraud as a Cabinet-level priority at both Departments.\n\nSince announcing HEAT in May 2009, the Medicare Fraud Strike Forces have conducted seven nationwide takedowns resulting in charges against almost 700 individuals with schemes involving nearly $2.2 billion in fraudulent billings. Strike Force operations since their inception in 2007 have charged more than 2,000 defendants who collectively have falsely billed the Medicare program for more than $6 billion.\n\nThe Department has returned historic amounts of taxpayer dollars through the False Claims Act. Since 2009, the Department has recovered more than $23.7 billion from False Claims Act cases, with more than $15.2 billion of those recoveries from cases involving fraud against federal health care programs. False Claims Act recoveries return losses to the federal agency that was defrauded, replenishing federal funds, and send a message to potential scammers that ultimately they will be required to pay up to three times the amount of their fraud. Total recoveries since January of 2009 are more than half of the recoveries obtained since Congress amended the False Claims Act 28 years ago to strengthen the statute. Results of these efforts include:\n\nIn FY 2014, the Department reported recoveries of $5.69 billion under the False Claims Act - the largest annual recovery of its type in history. In fiscal year 2014, the department recovered an unprecedented $3.1 billion from banks and other financial institutions involved in making false claims for federally insured mortgages and loans. False claims against federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid accounted for another $2.3 billion. These amounts reflect federal losses only. In many of these cases, the department was instrumental in recovering additional billions of dollars for consumers and state treasuries.\n\nThe number of qui tam suits filed in FY 2014 2014 exceeded 700 for the second year in a row. This nearly doubles the number since 2009, when 433 such matters were filed with the Department. In FY 2014, nearly $3 billion was recovered as a result of whistleblower suits, and since 2009, the Department’s total recoveries in such suits have climbed to more than $15.9 billion.\n\nIn August 2014, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP), a manufacturer and vendor of information technology products and services, agreed to pay $32.5 million to resolve allegations that it overcharged the U.S. Postal Service for products between October 2001 and December 2010; Community Health Systems Inc., the nation’s largest operator of acute care hospitals, agreed to pay $98.15 million to resolve multiple lawsuits alleging that the company knowingly billed government health care programs for inpatient services that should have been billed as outpatient or observation services; McKesson Corporation agreed to pay $18 million to resolve allegations that it improperly set temperature monitors used in shipping vaccines under its contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the United States intervened against defendants in two whistleblower lawsuits alleging Evercare Hospice and Palliative Care submitted false claims for the Medicare hospice benefit.\n\nIn September 2014, Shire Pharmaceuticals LLC agreed to pay $56.5 million to resolve allegations that it improperly marketed and promoted several drugs it manufactures and sells.\n\nIn October 2014: Extendicare Health Services Inc. and its subsidiary Progressive Step Corporation agreed to pay $38 million to the United States and eight states to resolve allegations that it billed Medicare and Medicaid for materially substandard nursing services, resulting in the largest failure-of-care settlement with a chain-wide skilled nursing facility in the department’s history; the Boeing Company, an aerospace and defense industry giant, paid $23 million to resolve allegations that it submitted false claims for labor charges on maintenance contracts with the U.S. Air Force; DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc., one of the nation’s leading dialysis services providers, agreed to pay $350 million to resolve claims that it paid kickbacks to induce the referral of patients to its dialysis clinics; Dignity Health agreed to pay the United States $37 million to settle allegations that 13 of its hospitals knowingly submitted false claims to Medicare and TRICARE. Dignity, formerly known as Catholic Healthcare West, is one of the five largest hospital systems in the nation with 39 hospitals in three states.\n\nIn November 2014, CareAll Management LLC and its affiliated entities agreed to pay $25 million plus interest to the United States and the state of Tennessee to resolve allegations that it submitted false and upcoded home healthcare billings to the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\nIn December 2014, Supreme Foodservice GmbH and Supreme Foodservice FZE pleaded guilty to major fraud against the United States and paid a criminal fine of $288.36 million, in connection with a contract to provide food and water to the U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan. Supreme Group B.V. and several of its subsidiaries also agreed to pay an additional $146 million to resolve a related civil lawsuit, as well as two separate civil matters, alleging false billings to the Department of Defense.\n\nIn January 2015, Daiichi Sankyo Inc., a global pharmaceutical company with its U.S. headquarters in New Jersey, paid $39 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by paying kickbacks to induce physicians to prescribe Daiichi drugs, including Azor, Benicar, Tribenzor and Welchol. In February 2015, Community Health Systems Professional Services Corporation and three affiliated New Mexico hospitals paid $75 million to settle allegations that they violated the False Claims Act by making illegal donations to county governments which were used to fund the state share of Medicaid payments to the hospitals.\n\nAmong the largest recoveries in the history of the False Claims Act have been those against companies alleged to have promoted pharmaceuticals for treatment of certain illnesses that had not been approved by the FDA. These include:\n\nIn 2012, a record $3 billion False Claims Act recovery and Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act criminal fine from global health care giant, GlaxoSmithKline, to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from allegations that it unlawfully promoted the prescription drugs Paxil, Wellbutin, Advair, Lamictal, Zofran, Imitrex, Lotronex, Flovent, and Valtrex; and reported false prices;\n\nIn 2013, a $2.2 billion recovery and Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act criminal fine from global health care giant, Johnson & Johnson, to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from allegations that it unlawfully promoted the prescription drugs Risperdal, Invega, and Natrecor for uses not approved as safe and effective by the FDA.\n\nThe Department has vigorously protected the health, safety, and economic security of American consumers. Operating through the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch, the Department protects vulnerable consumers from unsafe food and medical products and from fraud and abuse, including financial fraud and telemarketing fraud. It also defends the programs and initiatives of the major consumer protection agencies when they are challenged by regulated industry. Examples of recent successes include:\n\nOn January 27, 2015, Juan Alejandro Rodriguez Cuya was sentenced to 210 months in prison for his operation of Angeluz Florida Corporation in Miami and call centers in Peru that lied to and threatened Spanish-speaking victims into paying fraudulent settlements for nonexistent debts. According to evidence presented at trial, Rodriguez Cuya’s employees in Peru used Internet-based telephone calls to Spanish-speaking victims in the United States, threatened lawsuits, arrest, deportation"
