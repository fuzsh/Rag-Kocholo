        "text": "Percy Scott Worthington [also known as Sir Percy Worthington] was born in Crumpshall, near Manchester, England on 31 January 1864. His father, Thomas Worthington (1826-1909) was an architect, as was brother, John Hubert Worthington (1886-1963), his son, Thomas Shirley Scott Worthington (1900-81) and his cousin, Thomas Locke Worthington.\n\nAfter studying at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, P.S. Worthington was articled to his father in Manchester during which time he studied at Manchester School of Art. He then moved to London where he worked as an assistant to John MacVicar Anderson (1886-1963). He also attended University College London and the Royal Academy Schools in London. He then returned to Manchester where, in 1889 [or 1891 - sources differ], he was made a partner in his father's firm, which became Thomas Worthington & Son. Following the death of Worthington senior, P.S. Worthington continued the practice with his brother, John Hubert Worthington as Thomas Worthington & Sons. Later, his son, Thomas Shirley Scott Worthington, also joined the partnership.\n\nPhotographs and a ground-floor plan of 'Barrows Green', near Kendal, oak chairs, and a hall fireplace designed by Worthington are featured in 'The Studio Yearbook of Decorative Art' 1908 (illustrations B74, B, B75, B107, B108, B115, B121, B129). Between 1889-1921 Worthington exhibited at the Royal Academy in London, the Scottish Royal Academy in Edinburgh, and at Manchester City Art Gallery.\n\nHe was elected an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA) in 1890, and a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (FRIBA) in 1906. He was the recipient of the RIBA Silver Medal (Essays) in 1889, the Donaldson Medal from University College, and the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1930. He was appointed a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission in 1925 and in 1935 was knighted for services to architecture. He was also President of the Manchester Society of Architects.\n\nIn addition to his work as an architect, Worthington also designed furniture and fireplaces.\n\nHe died in Gorsey Brow in Mobberley, Cheshire, England, on 15 July 1939."
