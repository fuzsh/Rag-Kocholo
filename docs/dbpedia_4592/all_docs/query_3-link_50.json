The medal, awarded by The Princess Royal at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, acknowledges Andrew’s outstanding contributions to advancing health data science in Scotland and internationally.\n\nThe award is in recognition for Andrew’s efforts leading to the creation of Health Data Research UK, for which he serves as inaugural Director, and the creation of the UK’s Health Innovation Gateway, which has catalysed the trustworthy use of health data for both patient and public benefit. This resource is proving invaluable in, amongst other things, the fight against Covid-19 with real-time reporting to CMO Advisory Groups and SAGE.\n\nThe UK has a rich heritage in scientific discovery and health research. It is an honour to be recognised by the RSE for my small part in how we use health data to create new knowledge.\n\nProfessor Andrew MorrisDirector at Health Data Research UK and Vice Principal for Data Science at The University of Edinburgh\n\nCongratulations Andrew, and to all the RSE winners who were presented with their medals!\n\nFurther information\n\nRead more from Royal Society of Edinburgh’s website\n\nRead Health Data Research UK's announcement"
