With her flair for cleaning and proper etiquette, she has risen through the ranks of the glorious five-star Regency Grand Hotel to become the esteemed Head Maid. But just as her life reaches a pinnacle state of perfection, her world is turned upside down when J.D. Grimthorpe, the world-renowned mystery author, drops dead—very dead—on the hotel’s tea room floor.\n\nWhen Detective Stark, Molly’s old foe, investigates the author’s unexpected demise, it becomes clear that this death was murder most foul. Suspects abound, and everyone wants to know who killed J.D. Grimthorpe? Was it Lily, the new Maid-in-Training? Or was it Serena, the author’s secretary? Could Mr. Preston, the hotel’s beloved doorman, be hiding something? And is Molly really as innocent as she seems?\n\nAs the case threatens the hotel’s pristine reputation, Molly knows she alone holds the key to unlocking the killer’s identity. But that key is buried deep in her past—because long ago, she knew J.D. Grimthorpe. Molly begins to comb her memory for clues, revisiting her childhood and the mysterious Grimthorpe mansion where she and her dearly departed Gran once worked side by side. With the entire hotel under investigation, Molly must solve the mystery post-haste. If there’s one thing Molly knows for sure, it’s that dirty secrets don’t stay buried forever…\n\nReview:\n\nMolly Gray is now the Head Maid at the Regency Grand Hotel. At an event at the hotel, the famous author J.D. Grimthorpe drops dead, leaving the hotel staff as the prime suspects. However, Molly keeps it a secret that she knew Grimthorpe as a child. To figure out who the killer is, Molly revisits memories of visiting the Grimthorpe mansion with her Gran as a child.\n\nI was so glad to revisit Molly in this story. She’s a unique character who doesn’t understand many social cues, so she’s viewed as “different” by many people she encounters. Despite this, she perseveres and works to solve the murders that occur at the hotel. It was nice to see some of Molly’s memories with Gran, but I would have liked to see the story stay more in the present mystery. The murder mystery was suspenseful, with an ending I didn’t expect.\n\nI hope we get to revisit Molly Gray in the future.\n\nThank you Penguin Random House Canada for sending me a copy of this book!\n\nContent warnings: addiction, alcoholism, poisoning, death, theft\n\nOther books in the series:\n\nThe Maid (Molly the Maid #1)\n\nHave you read The Mystery Guest?

Instead, an earthquake traps her inside a bakery with its impossibly rude and insufferably handsome owner and head baker. They already have a history: she’s always smiled, he’s always scowled. Where better to finally get to know each other than amid the disaster? Then again, they have no choice. Besides, it could have its sweet, undeniable, and unpredictable perks.\n\nJasmine Guillory’s Drop, Cover, and Hold On is part of The Improbable Meet-Cute, irresistibly romantic stories about finding love when and where you least expect it. They can be read or listened to in one sitting. Let’s make a date of it.\n\nReview:\n\nOn Valentine’s Day, Daisy Murray ends up trapped in her favourite bakery after an earthquake. The problem is that she’s trapped with the owner of the bakery who clearly hates her. Daisy had even decided not to come to the bakery anymore because of the dirty looks he would give her, but she wanted to give it one last shot on Valentine’s Day. However, as they talk and snack on her favourite treats, she realizes that maybe she misunderstood his feelings.\n\nThis was the most extreme grumpy/sunshine story I’ve read. Daisy was super bubbly and happy, and Harris was scowling at Daisy all the time. It wasn’t clear why he was acting angry all the time when he really liked Daisy. There wasn’t an explanation for why he scowled all the time. The romance also escalated very quickly at the end once they knew they liked each other, which seemed unrealistic, since they hadn’t even spoken to each other until a few minutes before.\n\nDrop, Cover, and Hold On had potential to be a good story but didn’t seem realistic.\n\nContent warnings: earthquake\n\nOther books in the series:\n\nThe Exception to the Rule (The Improbable Meet-Cute #1)\n\nWorst Wingman Ever (The Improbable Meet-Cute #2)\n\nRosie and the Dreamboat (The Improbable Meet-Cute #3)\n\nWith Any Luck (The Improbable Meet-Cute #5)\n\nRoyal Valentine (The Improbable Meet-Cute #6)\n\nHave you read Drop, Cover, and Hold On?

Readers will be immersed in a series of 15 poems called “Love is” I through XV, with 15 additional poems that sit between them, threading the eye of the needle that we call love, with topics that seem to successively build on one another and chronicle the different phases of this intangible marvel that rules our lives. These poems · “We Start Here”\n\n· “Stay With Me”\n\n· “Wondering”\n\n· “Beautiful Things”\n\n· “Limitless”\n\nFor seekers, artists, lovers, moon-gazers, anyone that dares to glimpse the beating heart within, this collection is a goldmine of inspiration and magical fairy dust. On Audible\n\nDiary of an Artist in Love is an intimate new audiobook of prose poetry best listened to with headphones on and eyes closed. The Muse Frequency presents listeners with a calming and ethereal meditation on love. Throughout this profoundly serene and uplifting experience, the artist and sound designer gently coax us into a meditative state using Solfeggio frequencies and by communicating in the most direct possible way through a sacred one-on-one conversation.\n\nOriginally inspired by the work of diarist Anaïs Nin, The Muse Frequency aims to design an audio experience that feels confessional and personal. At the heart of it all, this wholly unique project creates intimate experiences meant for one listener, where they can close their eyes, shut out the rest of the world and drift off to beautiful places.\n\nSound Design for Audiobook by Sébastien Nouat\n\nReview:\n\nDiary of an Artist in Love is a collection of poems about love. There are 30 poems, with 15 of them called “Love Is” alternating between the other poems.\n\nThe audiobook is beautiful. It is in an ASMR style, with relaxing, meditative music playing along with the narrator. The auditory experience is unlike any other audiobook I’ve heard.\n\nI highly recommend Diary of an Artist in Love for poetry lovers.\n\nThank you The Muse Frequency and Book Influencers for providing a copy of this audiobook.\n\nHave you read Diary of an Artist in Love?

Miller\n\nGenre: Mystery, Contemporary, Cozy Mystery\n\nPublisher: Simon and Schuster\n\nSource: Publisher via NetGalley\n\nFormat: Ebook\n\nRelease Date: January 10, 2024\n\nRating: ★★★★★\n\nGoodreads Synopsis:\n\nIn this irresistible and thrilling debut novel, a former antique hunter investigates a suspicious death at an isolated English manor, embroiling her back in the dangerous world of tracking stolen artifacts.\n\nWhat antique would you kill for?\n\nFreya Lockwood is shocked when she learns that Arthur Crockleford, antiques dealer and her estranged mentor, has died under mysterious circumstances. She has spent the last twenty years avoiding her quaint English hometown, but when she receives a letter from Arthur asking her to investigate—sent just days before his death—Freya has no choice but to return to a life she had sworn to leave behind.\n\nJoining forces with her eccentric Aunt Carole, Freya follows clues and her instincts to an old manor house for an advertised antiques enthusiast’s weekend. But not all is as it seems. It’s clear to Freya that the antiques are all just poor reproductions and her fellow guests are secretive and menacing. What is going on at this estate and how was Arthur involved? More importantly, can Freya and Carole discover the truth before the killer strikes again?\n\nReview:\n\nWhen Freya Lockwood’s former mentor, Arthur Crockleford, dies under mysterious circumstances, she returns to her hometown. She has avoided her hometown for the past twenty years, when she had a falling out with Arthur and gave up her dream of hunting for antiques. When she returns to her aunt’s home where she grew up, Freya discovers that Arthur left a letter for her saying that his death was not accidental and he asks her to investigate. Freya and her Aunt Carole follow Arthur’s clues to an antique enthusiast’s weekend getaway, where only Freya can find the truth behind Arthur’s death.\n\nI didn’t know anything about antiques or the business of antique forgery before reading this book, so it was fascinating to read about. It was a dangerous world with murders happening over reproduced antiques or pieces of art, and lots of money behind the business. The ending of the story suggests that this is the beginning of a series, so I’m excited to see what adventure Freya goes on next!\n\nThe Antique Hunter’s Guide to Murder is an entertaining cozy mystery!\n\nThank you Simon and Schuster Canada for sending me a copy of this book!\n\nContent warnings: death, fire, gun violence\n\nHave you read The Antique Hunter’s Guide to Murder?

Getting locked inside a flotation tank is so Rosie. Enter a firefighter hero determined to pry this luckless pearl out of her high-tech shell. All Rosie has to go on is a dreamy voice and a flirty sense of humor. Remain calm, Rosie. This could be what you’ve been waiting for. Is this the man she’s waited for her whole life?\n\nReview:\n\nRosie Whittaker takes her sister to a spa for Galentine’s Day for some pampering. When they go in the brand new flotation tanks, Rosie gets stuck inside. The fire department has to be called in to rescue her, and Rosie listens to the attractive voice of one firefighter as he tries to rescue her.\n\nThis novella was quite short, at just around 40 pages, but it felt like it dragged on. Most of the story was spent with Rosie in the tank, speaking to the firefighter, and not much was happening. The way that Rosie was trapped in the tank was also making me feel claustrophobic, so it didn’t feel like a particularly romantic setting.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t enjoy this romance novella.\n\nContent warning: claustrophobia\n\nOther books in the series:\n\nThe Exception to the Rule (The Improbable Meet-Cute #1)\n\nWorst Wingman Ever (The Improbable Meet-Cute #2)\n\nDrop, Cover, and Hold On (The Improbable Meet-Cute #4)\n\nWith Any Luck (The Improbable Meet-Cute #5)\n\nRoyal Valentine (The Improbable Meet-Cute #6)\n\nHave you read Rosie and the Dreamboat?

Would you be Anne Boleyn, who literally lost her head? Would you be the subject of rumor and scandal like Catherine Howard? Or would you get away and survive like Anna of Cleves?\n\nMeet them and Henry’s other queens–each bound for divorce or death–in this epic and thrilling novel that reads like fantasy but really happened. Watch spellbound as each of these women attempts to survive their unpredictable king as he grows more and more obsessed with producing a male heir. And discover how the power-hungry court fanned the flames of Henry’s passions . . . and his most horrible impulses.\n\nWhether you’re a huge fan of all things Tudor or new to this jaw-dropping saga, you won’t be able to get the unique voices of Henry and his wives–all brought to life by seven award-winning and bestselling authors–out of your head.\n\nThis is an intimate look at the royals during one of the most treacherous times in history. Who will you root for and who will you love to hate?\n\nReview:\n\nThis book is a collection of stories about the six wives of King Henry VIII. Each short story about one of the wives was also accompanied by a passage from Henry’s perspective.\n\nI liked that each story told the wives stories from different times in their lives. Some of them told how they became his wife, while others showed the women at the end of their lives. Each story was told from the perspective of the wives, so they can finally let their story be heard.\n\nFatal Throne is a great story for fans of Henry VIII’s wives!\n\nContent warnings: death, adultery, miscarriage\n\nHave you read Fatal Throne?

Me? I grew up with postcards from my parents.\n\nWhen ten-year-old Lina Gao steps off the plane in Los Angeles, it’s her first time in America and the first time seeing her parents and her little sister in five years! She’s been waiting for this moment every day while she lived with her grandmother in Beijing, getting teased by kids at school who called her “left behind girl.” Finally, her parents are ready for her to join their fabulous life in America! Except, it’s not exactly like in the postcards:\n\n1. School’s a lot harder than she thought. When she mispronounces some words in English on the first day, she decides she simply won’t talk. Ever again.\n\n2. Her chatty little sister has no problem with English. And seems to do everything better than Lina, including knowing exactly the way to her parents’ hearts.\n\n3. They live in an apartment, not a house like in Mom’s letters, and they owe a lot of back rent from the pandemic. And Mom’s plan to pay it back sounds more like a hobby than a moneymaker.\n\nAs she reckons with her hurt, Lina tries to keep a lid on her feelings, both at home and at school. When her teacher starts facing challenges for her latest book selection, a book that deeply resonates with Lina, it will take all of Lina’s courage and resilience to get over her fear and choose a future where she’s finally seen.\n\nReview:\n\nTen-year-old Lina Gao lives with her grandmother in Beijing, since her parents and younger sister moved to the U.S. five years ago. Lina has always felt like she was left behind while her parents have a wonderful life without her. When her mom finally says Lina can join them, their life isn’t what she expected. Lina has trouble speaking English in class and gets embarrassed and teased by classmates. Her parents are struggling to make enough money to pay for their back rent from the pandemic. And Lina is missing her grandmother who is now alone in Beijing. The librarian introduces Lina to some graphic novels so that she can finally see herself represented in stories, which gives Lina the confidence to make changes in her life.\n\nThis was such a powerful middle grade story. There were many parts that brought tears to my eyes. Lina struggled with being bullied because she couldn’t speak English perfectly. She experienced racism from children and adults. Her parents were really struggling with money, and Lina was doing her best to help them make ends meet. Lila also had to deal with her favourite book being banned because it had a similar immigrant experience to hers, but she was strong and confident and fought it. I wish a book like this was around when I was a kid, because it would have allowed me to understand my friends’ experiences with immigration.\n\nFinally Seen is an important story! The sequel, Finally Heard, comes out on February 27.\n\nContent warnings: death of grandparent, abuse, cancer, racism, bullying\n\nHave you read Finally Seen?

She saw the magic in his darkness.\n\nWren Southerland’s reckless use of magic has cost her everything: she’s been dismissed from the Queen’s Guard and separated from her best friend–the girl she loves. So when a letter arrives from a reclusive lord, asking Wren to come to his estate, Colwick Hall, to cure his servant from a mysterious illness, she seizes her chance to redeem herself.\n\nThe mansion is crumbling, icy winds haunt the caved-in halls, and her eccentric host forbids her from leaving her room after dark. Worse, Wren’s patient isn’t a servant at all but Hal Cavendish, the infamous Reaper of Vesria and her kingdom’s sworn enemy. Hal also came to Colwick Hall for redemption, but the secrets in the estate may lead to both of their deaths.\n\nWith sinister forces at work, Wren and Hal realize they’ll have to join together if they have any hope of saving their kingdoms. But as Wren circles closer to the nefarious truth behind Hal’s illness, they realize they have no escape from the monsters within the mansion. All they have is each other, and a startling desire that could be their downfall.\n\nLove makes monsters of us all\n\nReview:\n\nWren Southerland is a healer, but her empathy for a prisoner leads her to heal him, allowing him to escape. She’s dismissed from her position and separated from her best friend. When she receives a letter from Lord Lowry from a neutral country, she decides to go help him. Lowry wants Wren to heal one of his servants, who is the latest to come down with a mysterious illness. However, when she arrives there, she discovers that the servant is actually Hal Cavendish, her country’s enemy. Wren’s morals mean she must heal Hal, and they discover that they actually have the same goal for peace in their countries. Wren and Hal have to work together to discover the truth behind the illness at Lowry’s manor and how to save their countries from war.\n\nThis was a great fantasy! There was great worldbuilding, with some people having magic. Since Wren’s magic was healing, there were a lot of medical scenes. Some of these scenes involved surgery, which became quite gruesome at the end. However, the ending was so perfect, it made it all worth.\n\nDown Comes the Night is a thrilling fantasy!\n\nThank you Wednesday Books for sending me a copy of this book.\n\nContent warnings: death of parents, death, poisoning, surgery, blood, eye surgery\n\nHave you read Down Comes the Night?
