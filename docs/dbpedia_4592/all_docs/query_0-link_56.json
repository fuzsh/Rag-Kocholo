        "text": "Honors\n\nBrandy Schillace, Ph.D.\n\nSaturday, November 16, 2024\n\nBrandy Schillace, Ph.D., is a celebrated author, historian, and medical humanities scholar. Her work has been widely recognized for its interdisciplinary approach, blending science, history, and storytelling to explore the human experience of medicine and mortality.\n\nHer recent novel, The Framed Women of Ardemore House (Hanover Square Press), showcases her ability to craft compelling narratives that blend contemporary mystery with historical intrigue. The book follows the story of Jo Jones, a neurodivergent, hyperlexic book editor and divorced New Yorker transplanted into the English countryside. After losing her job, her mother, and her marriage all in one year, she couldn’t be happier to take possession of a possibly haunted (and clearly unwanted) family estate in North Yorkshire. But when the body of the moody town groundskeeper turns up on her rug with three bullets in his back, Jo finds herself in potential danger—and she’s also a potential suspect. At the same time, a peculiar family portrait vanishes from a secret room in the manor, bearing a strange connection to both the dead body and Jo’s mysterious family history.\n\nSchillace's meticulous research and vivid prose bring the novel's world to life, immersing readers in the atmospheric setting and the complex inner lives of her characters. The novel has been praised for its feminist themes, exploration of the psychological toll of oppression, gripping plot twists, and powerful representation of a neurodiverse main character.\n\nThe Framed Women of Ardemore House has garnered critical acclaim. Library Journal has named it a Recommended Read for Autism Acceptance Month, while The Washington Post notes that “The book is more than just a mystery: It’s an autistic woman’s journey of self-discovery.” The Wall Street Journal writes, “It’s a delight to spend quality time with the more-than-capable Josephine Jones,” and Publisher’s Weekly exclaims that “Schillace, who’s autistic herself, draws a marvelously believable heroine in Jo, and sets her up with an expertly constructed mystery. Readers will be hungry for a sequel.”\n\nDr. Schillace is also the author of several acclaimed non-fiction books. Her nonfiction work showcases her unique ability to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences. Her nonfiction work includes Mr. Humble and Dr. Butcher (Simon & Schuster), which was described as “Delightfully macabre” by The New York Times, “Fascinating” by The Wall Street Journal, and “Spirited and breezily provocative” by The Washington Post. She is also the author of Death's Summer Coat (Pegasus Books) and Clockwork Futures (Pegasus Books).\n\nAs a medical historian, Dr. Schillace has made significant contributions to the field, shedding light on the social, cultural, and political aspects of medicine throughout history. Her work has been supported by grants from prestigious institutions such as the Arthur P. Sloan Foundation for Science Communication and the Ohio Arts Council. As a Research and Public Engagement Fellow at the Dittrick Museum, she played an integral role when the museum received an NEH grant to create an interactive exhibit highlighting the evolution of medicine in America.\n\nDr. Schillace's work has been featured in numerous publications, including Scientific American, Wired, The Huffington Post, Undark, CrimeReads, and The Wall Street Journal. She has also been interviewed by The Washington Post and The New York Times. Additionally, she has appeared on television shows such as \"Mysteries at the Museum\" with Don Wildman and \"The Unbelievable\" with Dan Aykroyd.\n\nIn addition to her writing and research, Dr. Schillace holds a Ph.D. and has been a dedicated educator and mentor. Truly interdisciplinary, she has held positions in English literature and History departments and worked for a decade for a medical anthropology journal. Previously an assistant professor at Winona State University, she later taught at Case Western Reserve University, where she inspired students to explore the intersections of science, history, and the humanities. Brandy is presently the Editor-in-Chief of BMJ's Medical Humanities, where she continues to work for accessibility and social justice.\n\nFor her outstanding contributions to literature and the medical humanities, Brandy Schillace, Ph.D., is the recipient of the 2024 Royden B. Davis, S.J., Distinguished Author Award. Her work continues to enrich our understanding of the human experience and the role of medicine in shaping our lives and societies.\n\nSponsor the Event and Receive Tickets\n\nPurchase Tickets\n\nDistinguished Author Award Sponsors\n\nThis event is made possible through the generosity of our sponsors."
