        "text": "Kimber here. Letting you know The ‘Ole Curmudgeon is being her curmudgeonly self today. Again. Still. Ya see, we just saw this post somewhere about “50 Most Popular Fantasy Books of the Last 3 years.” Or some such Tom Foolery.\n\nThe ‘Ole Curmudgeon: “Three years? Seriously? That’s not even a bat of the eye lash. Especially for those of us who were on a first-name basis with Moses. And eye-witnesses to the Parting of the Red Sea. Sheesh.”\n\nWell. You know Mom.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nLetters to Children\n\nC.S. Lewis (1996)\n\nEditors: Lyle W. Dorsett and Marjorie Lamp Mead\n\nvia: Library\n\nGenre: Non-fiction\n\nPages: 115\n\nMom and I are humungous C.S. Lewis fans. Far as we’re concerned, if C.S. Lewis books were an Olympic sport, they’d bring home the gold. Both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nNow, you may know Lewis from The Chronicles of Narnia. Probably his best-known and most beloved work. But he wrote like, a ton of other stuff, too. Some of our other faves include Mere Christianity. The Great Divorce. The Problem of Pain. The Screwtape Letters. Surprised by Joy. And his autobiography, Till We Have Faces. Lewis notes that altho Till We was not a commercial success, it’s his favorite work.\n\nIndeed, we’ve read pretty much everything “Jack” ever published. Except this here puppy. Missed this one. But we found it the other day in the Book Place. Sitting on a shelf. Calling our name. Diving in, this book actually surprised us. Here’s why:\n\nIn his life, Lewis received thousands of letters from young fans who were eager for more of his bestselling Narnia books and their author. This book is a collection of many of his responses to those letters, in which he shares his feelings about writing, school, animals, and of course, Narnia. Lewis writes to the children – as he wrote for them – with understanding and respect, proving why he remains one of the most beloved children’s authors of all time.\n\nRare, Remarkable\n\nLetters to Children offers a rare, luminous glimpse into the heart and mind of a remarkably eloquent and equally gracious genius. There’s so much wit and warmth in Lewis’s letters to young readers. In fact, Lewis carried on a loquacious correspondence with many of his young correspondents for years, even into their adulthood. The sheer volume of his correspondence is astounding. Ditto the amount of wit and whimsy in each letter. It’s remarkable.\n\nLithe and limber, Lewis’s letters brim with warmth and vitality. They’re perhaps as surprising as they are charming.\n\nOffering advice to a young correspondent, Lewis writes:\n\nAlways try to use the language so as to make quite clear what you mean and make sure your sentence couldn’t mean anything else.\n\nAlways prefer the plain direct word to the long, vague one. Don’t implement promises, but keep them.\n\nNever use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do. If you mean “More people died” don’t say “Mortality rose.”\n\nWrite On!\n\nThere’s more. But our personal favorite on Lewis’s list is:\n\nIn writing. Don’t use adjectives which merely tell us how you want us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of telling us a thing was “terrible,” describe it so that we’ll be terrified. Don’t say it was “delightful”: make us say “delightful” when we’ve read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers “Please will you do my job for me.”\n\nWrite on, dude.\n\nC.S. Lewis also writes about his health issues, the weather, gardens, and so on. He reads and responds to every letter received personally – in long hand. (Note to young whipper-snappers: That’s called “pen and ink.” Before computers.) Lewis’s responses are soaked in kindness and encouragement. He shows an unflagging interest in each of his young correspondents’ lives, their families, schools, and writing endeavors, often offering encouragement per the last.\n\nMore?\n\nWhen his correspondents ask for more Narnia a stories, Lewis gently explains, “I’m afraid the Narnian series has come to an end.” He urges them to write their own stories.\n\nWe love that!\n\n“It is a funny thing that all the children who have written to me see at once who Aslan is, and grown-ups never do” writes Lewis in the final letter in this tome, typed the day before he died in 1963.\n\nKimber: Good thing we’re not grown-ups, huh Mom?\n\nHave you read C.S. Lewis?\n\nWhat’s your fave Lewis book?\n\nKimber: Mom! Mom! Come quick!\n\nHer Royal Momness: What’s up Kimster? Earthquake? Fire? Flood? The imminent demise of doggie treats?\n\nKimber: ‘Course not. I just gotta tell ya about my new best bud, Petunia.\n\nMom: Petunia?\n\nKimber: Yeah. She’s furry and fluffy and she’s the star of the show in this new book for the little’uns, Blink and Glow.\n\nMom: Blink and Glow? By Raven Howell?\n\nKimber: That’s it! Mom, you’re a genius.\n\nMom: I thought that book was about two kids, Leo and Lilly. They catch fireflies, a salamander, and a Luna moth. For their classroom show and tell. The critters dim in captivity and grandma gently explains that they need to be free to live happily and shine bright.\n\nSilly Mom!\n\nMeanwhile, Back at the Ranch…\n\nWell. To cut to the chase, so to speak, Lilly and Leo think long and hard about what their grandma said as the lights of their trapped firefly and salamander begin to fade. It was fun to catch and jar them. But should the kids keep them?\n\nThis is a short, sweet story about loving and respecting nature and taking care of the environment. Bite-sized sentences are short and easy to digest and won’t strain young attention spans.\n\nDelightful!\n\nBesides a delightful story that’s both entertaining and educational, the text is complemented by vibrant illustrations. With bright, bold colors, the illustrations are top-notch. They’re gorgeous and dynamic, suggesting motion and fluidity.\n\nBeautifully written, skillfully illustrated and briskly paced, Blink and Glow will make a welcome addition to any school or home library. It would also make an excellent read-aloud or bedtime story.\n\nBonus points:\n\nStep-by-step instructions for making your own firefly sun-catchers are included!\n\nKimber: Leo and Lilly aren’t alone in their adventures in their natural world. An unnamed little white dog is supervising. Just so ya know, okay? I named her Petunia. She’s my new best bud.\n\nMom: Why Petunia?\n\nKimber: Cuz Her Royal Magnificence, Queen of the Universe and World’s Most Amazingly Brilliant and Super Gorgeous Canine was already taken. By me.\n\nSilly Mom.\n\nOur Rating: 4.5\n\n***\n\nAdditional Info on Blink and Glow:\n\nAmazon\n\nGood Reads\n\nBarnes and Noble"
