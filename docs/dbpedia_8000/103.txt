DeadMau5

Producer Joel Zimmerman – or Deadmau5 to most of us – went from self-releasing records in his native Ontario to become one of the world’s most in-demand artists, and Proper Productions was there during the transformative years to help take him from club-show DJ to arena-selling superstar.

Working closely with the artist, management, agents and record label for six years, Proper Productions assembled and project-managed a world class team to design and build increasingly impressive levels of live production, including expansive LED screens, video mapping, and the standout cube that became the signature of the Deadmau5 set. Tapping into its network of production suppliers worldwide meant Proper could truly take this show on the road, ensuring the highest production values at Deadmau5 dates on every continent.

Seminal moments included a huge filmed-for-DVD show at London’s Earls Court, a sold-out hometown show at Toronto’s Rogers Centre (the first for a solo electronic artist), and a spectacular live event to launch the Nokia Lumia smartphone with a 4D light show and 120m high projection on Millbank Tower in central London.
