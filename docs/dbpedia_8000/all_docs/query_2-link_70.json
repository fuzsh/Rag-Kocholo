        "text": "One of the most fabulous things about Europe is that the continent reveals numerous charming, under-the-radar second cities. Often as fascinating and colourful as Europe’s capitals, their more manageable size makes them the perfect post-pandemic destination for a swift dose of cosmopolitan discovery. In issue 38 of The Cultured Traveller, we champion second cities and explore the streets of THESSALONIKI, ROTTERDAM and MELBOURNE, all of which exude their own unique characters and delight visitors with their untold gastronomic and cultural pleasures. The globetrotting team also checks-out WARSAW’S FOOD SCENE; explores the natural treasures of the Southeast Asian island of LANGKAWI; road-tests a sumptuous hotel suite that boasts astonishing views of ISTANBUL; sits down with celebrated Italian street artist MILLO, and rounds-up this year's SUMMER FASHION STAPLES, that will work equally well in the Greek islands or on the Cornish coast."
