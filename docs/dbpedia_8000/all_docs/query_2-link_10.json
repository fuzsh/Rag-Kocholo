        "text": "TORONTO -- Deadmau5 has scurried past yet another milestone -- the Canadian electronic-music star has landed on the cover of Rolling Stone.\n\nThe Niagara Falls, Ont., native headlines an upcoming issue of the venerable music mag focusing on the \"DJs who rule the world.\"\n\nDeadmau5, whose real name is Joel Zimmerman, is pictured in his trademark yellow mouse helmet and a blue T-shirt.\n\nIn a preview of the story posted on Rolling Stone's website, the reliably outspoken Zimmerman criticizes fellow electronic stars including David Guetta and renews his feud with Madonna.\n\nThe two had exchanged words after Zimmerman took offence to an apparent drug reference made by Madonna onstage at the Ultra Music Festival in March.\n\nThough the spat was eventually settled, Zimmerman says of the Material Girl in Rolling Stone: \"If you're going to come into my world, at least do it with a little more dignity.\"\n\nThe Grammy-nominated DJ/producer will release a new EP, \"The Veldt,\" on Monday. The release features collaborations with stoner-rap veterans Cypress Hill and vocalist Chris James."
