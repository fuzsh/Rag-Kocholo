        "meta_description": "Take a listen to today's episode; Che had the most beautiful opportunity to speak, laugh and cry with international producer and professional DJ Cozmic Cat. Â At the beginning of the pandemic, DJ Coz lost most of her work and her eighteen-year-old dog KALI passed away. The pandemic challenged her on every level, identity, passion and livelihood. She unplugged entirely from social media and gave herself a time out from the world until her Partner and opportunity pulled her out of a depressive funk. She needed space to grieve the loss of so many things and then rebuild. She also knew that she needed help to process the changes and the losses. Coz began to reach out to DJ's close to home and internationally, Â slowly exploring and experimenting; she refused to become irrelevant. And it was an opportunity from Pride Toronto that inspired her to create a mission to live stream, reconnect to her audience, and grow a new audience. She felt inspired to produce new music and expand into the podcast space producing shows for other Creators. Her path has never been a straight line, she has always had to carve out space for herself, and the pandemic didn't change that; it just showed her a depth and loss that she had not experienced before, but she met it with ingenuity, perseverance and hope. So take a listen and see if her story relates to your experience going through the pandemic. Then, share the episode and tell us what you think.",

She is a trained therapist for individual therapy and a group facilitator in multiple areas of psychotherapy such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, Attachment-Based Therapy and Trauma Treatment. In this conversation, Savinna shares her story of strength as she experiences the loss of her partner during the pandemic.

When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers\"- Thich Nhat Hanh.\n\nIn today's episode, Che spoke to award-winning writer-producer-director and passionate storyteller/activist Alison Duke. Alison is committed to telling stories of resistance and change. Alison Duke has made life telling the stories of others, she rarely talks about herself but in this conversation, Che had a chance to discover some of the motivations behind this great Canadian Filmmaker, Storyteller and Producer. Recently, she co-wrote and co-produced the television documentary Mr. Jane and Finch (19) directed by Ngardy Conteh George which garnered two 2020 Canadian Screen Awards: the Donald Britain Award for Best Social/Political Documentary and Best Writing for a Documentary. During the same timeframe, she directed Cool Black North (19) a two-hour television documentary special for CityTV/Rogers about the unique and vibrant Canadian Black Community and its role in our countryâs contemporary identity.\n\nAlison discusses her unique path into documentary filmmaking and the relationship between starting off as an athlete and evolving into a filmmaker. She was even inducted into the University of Windsor Sports Hall of Fame in 2009 for the sport of basketball. She got her start directing and producing documentaries with the hip hop cult classic, Raisinâ Kane: a rapumentary (00). From there she worked as a segment producer and field director on syndicated factual and lifestyle shows. Eventually, she made her way to social issue docs; A Deathly Silence (03). She also collaborates with other filmmakers as a producer; Andrew Niskerâs Garbage: The Revolution Stars at Home (07), Dany Chiassonâs My Joan of Arc (08) and Thomas Allen Harrisâs Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photography and the Emergence of a People. Inspired by Ava Duvernay, #metoo and the reality that opportunities for women behind the camera in Canada are long overdue, Alison hired five Black female Canadian directors to helm short films for the Akua Benjamin Legacy Project (16) which celebrates the legacies of Canadian-based black activists Dudley Laws, Charles Roach, Rosie Douglas, Marlene Green and Len and Gwen Johnson. And now Alison is more focused on fictional storytelling and movie making. And for the record, Che and Alison are third cousins, they met in their late teens. Take a listen to the conversation, tell us what you think and share the podcast.\n\nIn todays' episode, Che has a conversation with the renowned novelist Katherine Govier. Katherine has published eleven novels, three short story collections and two anthologies of travel writing. She has won the City of Toronto Book Award and the Engel/Findlay Award for a writer in mid-career. She is a Distinguished Alumna of The University of Alberta, one of York Universityâs âFamous Fiftyâ alumni, and has been recognized by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association for Excellence in the Arts. In 2019 she was inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada. Katherine loves to write about women, artists and adventurers. Ten years ago Katherine founded the acclaimed program The Shoe Project in Toronto, she knew that newcomer women had stories to tell but were often not included in the Canadian conversation. She began a round table conversation with twelve women newcomers from five continents from three simple statements, âthe shoes I left behindâ, âthe shoes I wore to cross the borderâ and âthe shoes I dreamed I would wear in my new life.â She has built chapters in Vancouver, Canmore, Calgary, Antigonish, and Halifax. Her newest book is a continuation of the story of Katsushika Oi, the daughter of the great Japanese printmaker Hokusai.

He is a licensed Jungian analyst in private practice in Washington, D.C. He served as Executive Director of the Jung Educational Center in Houston, Texas, for many years and was Executive Director of the Jung Society of Washington until 2019, and he now serves on the JSW Board of Directors. Che and Dr. Hollis discuss how to find meaning in the pandemic and the profound questions that this transformational time can offer us in finding understanding and uncovering our truest identity. We are meaning-seeking beings according to Dr. Hollis, much of our human distress is from disconnection and a misunderstanding of what is meaningful to us. He is fond of the Carl Jung quote \"The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it\". In the conversation, they explore healing, dreaming and how to discover our truest nature. Sometimes we have to recover our childhood experiences and the adaptations that take us away from our essential selves and even lead to burnout. Dr. Hollis posits that sleep and dreams are essential to processing our daily life and experience. He believes that nature wastes nothing, dreams are complex and not always literal but an internal processing system that explores the inner psyche. The question we should ask ourselves, he says is what is life trying to express through me in this important and transformational period.\n\nPlease take a listen, subscribe, rate and review us on any of the platforms you listen to and share the episode with a friend.

He has just released his first memoir, All the Rage: A Partial Memoir in Two Acts and a Prologue. He had resisted writing a memoir for a long time. Still, he seemed to be doing the work of compiling a memoir organically as he told the story of friends lost to the AIDS crisis of the early nineteen nineties on world Aid's Day in social media every year. He had files and files of pictures and stories of a generation of forgotten people and the friends that looked after each other. Brad also shared his early love for reading and how writing became a refuge from his life of rejection, poverty and abuse. He spoke of his experience of boredom and the benefit monotony offers our imagination.\n\nBrad discusses his early life and his internal knowledge about the value of caring for himself even if amid abuse; he knew that he needed to offer himself compassion and self-care; he knew that his survival depended on it. Brad discusses his inner knowing that he did not have to stay in the life he was born into was not the life he had to live. He started to write a young age and wrote his first play at 17; the theatre and the gay community became a safe and inspiring haven for him, and writing became a formidable outlet for his anger. He discusses the power of anger and the desire to use it constructively to let it out but not hurt yourself or other people. For Brad, anger became a muse of sorts for seeing and writing what was there but could not be said, and the theatre became a place to cultivate that ability to see and share what was unspoken in our society. The theatre never rejected him; instead, it was a place of education and freedom, he was able to be himself. His anger has become fuel for sharing the invisible stories, always exploring vulnerability, sexuality, morality and inequities in their many forms. He has always been someone who can be alone for long stretches, so the pandemic had not changed that; however, before the pandemic, he developed a relationship with a neighbour by the name of Shirley. And as their friendship developed over five years, so her decline due to Alzheimer's, they became more bonded, and he committed to caring for her in this time in her life. He never imagined this type of connection and yet is essential to his life now. This relationship has fueled his belief that the cure for loneliness and depression is giving a part of yourself away through caring so that someone else can have comfort. Please take a listen to one of the most compelling playwrights of our time. Please share the show, tell us what you think, and check out Brads's new book All the Rage: A Partial Memoir in Two Acts and a Prologue., which comes out on May 2021.\n\nConnect with Che at https://coachchemarville.com/\n\nChe spoke to Alpine Speed Racer Benjamin Alexander; after a successful ten-year career as an international DJ and stints in finance and tech, this Engineer followed curiosity.
