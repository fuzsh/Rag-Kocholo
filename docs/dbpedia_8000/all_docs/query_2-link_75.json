        "text": "Striking a balance between detuned synthesizers and entangled melodies EP single and album cut “Daisy Garden” deals with the pains of aging from a personal point of view. “I wrote ‘Daisy Garden’ about my Grandmother’s struggle, outward and inward, with the decline in her mental state,” says Schram. Director Blake McWilliam illustrates touches on these challenges in the new video for “Daisy Garden”. Hide Like A Secret EP, which includes the track “Daisy Garden”, is available to purchase now on iTunes. A portion of the sales will be donated to the Alzheimer’s Society of Canada via Boom Charity.\n\nTAKEN FROM LATEST EP, HIDE LIKE A SECRET, OUT NOW\n\nMay was quite a month for the Canadian band who’ve just put the wraps on a European tour through Germany and the UK – They enjoyed support from Clash, NME, Indie Shuffle, Q and Artrocker amongst many others and plan to return to UK shores in the autumn when they’ll announce details on their upcoming full-length album.\n\n“A propulsive display of robust slickness” – 8/10 This is Fake DIY\n\n“A satisfying, organised chaos” – VICE\n\n“New cats Ninetails specialise in precision guitar-pop” – NME\n\nAfter a spring which saw them tipped by Vice, NME, Clash and This is Fake DIY, Ninetails return with ‘Slept and Did Not Sleep’, the much anticipated follow up to their ‘Ghost Ride the Whip’ EP. Combining hyperrealistic pop with sleek maximalist production, the Liverpool four piece explore euphoria, lamentation and lucidity on this song cycle melodrama. Throughout, moody minimalism and loop-based composition provide an Eno-like back drop for vocals inspired by sunshine pop, r’n’b and dramatic choral harmony.\n\nEarlier in the year Ninetails were included in NME’s scene report of their home city and a performance at Sound City in May prompted Clash Magazine to tag them as an “Up Coming Hype Band” whilst Vice highlighted them in their ‘Ones to Watch’ list. Prior to these accolades, they’d shared stages with Alt-J, Errors and Tall Ships. The band have also been included in Simon Raymonde’s list of favourites in 2012.\n\nThe band will release ‘Slept and Did Not Sleep’ through Superstar Destroyer Records on the 26th of November as a pay-what-you-feel download. A visually cohesive CD package and very limited number of ‘uniquely chopped and screwed’ cassette tapes of the EP will also be available. Two videos will accompany the release, as well as an EP launch in Liverpool and the band’s first London Show on the 29th of November at the Bull and Gate in Kentish Town.\n\nUndoubtedly, this is an exciting time for Ninetails who have already made plans to release again early into the new year.\n\nLooking for something to so this Diamond Jubilee Bank Holiday Weekend?\n\nIf you are in Newcastle Gateshead Quayside there is a musical extravagance.\n\nwww.evolutionfestival.co.uk\n\nDizzee Rascal, Deadmau5, Maximo Park, Noah & The Whale plus many more confirmed for the North East music spectacular\n\nA host of outstanding music talent across 2 days\n\nNo work on Tuesday (thanks Queen) so…\n\nthe perfect weekend to party\n\n‘The biggest bargain of the summer’ NME\n\n‘The UK’s model City Festival’ Clash\n\nEvolution Festival returns to the North East on the Diamond Jubilee Bank Holiday weekend with a stellar line up of the most influential and exciting names in popular music. Evolution attracts 28,000 people per day to the Quayside, delivering an outstanding bill of contemporary live acts and dj’s at an unbeatable price. And the 2012 line up is the best one yet!\n\n2012 is the ‘Return Of The Rascal” headlining the main stage on Sunday is the irrepressible Dizzee Rascal. The ultimate showman whose pop sensibilities seamlessly fuse Grime, House and Hip-hop Dizzee Rascal ensures rapturous responses from audience and arrives with a sack load of number 1 hits including Dance Wiv Me, Bonkers, Holiday and Dirtee Disco.\n\nNot the first dead rodent to be found on the Quayside but certainly the biggest, famed for his notorious live shows, the mighty Deadmau5 brings the biggest production ever to Evolution with his jaw dropping audio visual spectacular. His set up will no doubt light up the Quayside for a perfect finale to the weekend. With an epic mix of EDM Deadmau5 is a genuine global star and this is his only North of England show this year.\n\nThe North East’s favourite sons Maximo Park will grace the stage as very special guests in support of Dizzee. Having blazed a trail around the Globe representing all that is good and infectious about the North East we are stoked to have them at Evolution and with the band currently ensconced in the Studio working on their new album we look forward to giving the boys a HUGE hometown welcome as they hit the stage for one of their legendary, incendiary live shows.\n\nNoah & The Whale delivered the hugely critically and commercially successful ‘Last Night On Earth’ album last year and are undoubtedly one of the best live bands in the country as their recent sell out UK tour demonstrated. Variously described as anti-folk, nu-folk and folk-pop (a confusing multitude of pigeonholes) alongside like-minded souls such as Laura Marling and Emmy the Great. Both of whom were part-time members of the band at various points.\n\nRizzle Kicks have been the undisputed breakout act of the past 6 months seemingly coming from nowhere to top radio playlist and the charts and injecting some fun into proceedings wherever they perform. Rizzle Kicks are destined for superstardom in 2012 and their set will be one of the feel good moments of the festival.\n\nWhilst touring with the Arctic Monkeys with The Rascals, Miles Kane developed\n\na strong friendship with front man Alex Turner. They shared a love of the same musical influences, such as Nick Cave. The pair began to play together backstage, and soon began writing new tracks. They realized that there was a future in their songwriting partnership, and the Last Shadow Puppets were born. Since his work with Turner Kane has shone with his solo material and his debut album has won millions of plaudits.\n\nWith artist such as Devlin, Benjamin Francis Leftwich, Band Of Skulls, Spector and Jessie Ware amongst other confirmations on the main stage, Evolution 2012’s line up takes on monstrous proportions.\n\nThe Ballast Hills this year will be home of some of the most pioneering electronic music and all tastes are catered for with a truly amazing and eclectic bill across both days. DJ sets from DJ Fresh, SBTRKT, Jack Beats, Toddla T, Maya Jane Coles and a live set from Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs are certain to have the Evolution crowd partying into the night.\n\nEvolution promoter Jim Mawdsley comments ‘We are very proud to bring such a strong and progressive line up to NewcastleGateshead for this years Evolution Festival. We look forward to partying with you all in June’.\n\nEvolution festival continues to bring the best artists to the North East to perform in front of the UK’s most rapturous festival audience. At £25 for a day ticket or £35 for the weekend, Evolution continues its tradition of providing an amazing show for an unbeatable price.\n\nAlongside hosting some of the biggest acts on the planet Evolution will once again introduce the crowd to a wealth of emerging local talent on the third stage – partnered with Generator the UK’s leading Music Development Agency this stage gives local talent a chance to get their foot on the ladder and play to the biggest crowd of their careers to date\n\nFor Hi Res Artist Pics / Biogs / Logos please visit: http://www.wearesoundproof.com/press.html\n\nFULL LINE UP\n\nSunday 3 June\n\nSpillers Wharf\n\nDizzee Rascal\n\nPlus very special guests\n\nMaximo Park\n\nMiles Kane\n\nDevlin\n\nBenjamin Francis Leftwich\n\nDog Is Dead\n\nLulu James\n\nTheme Park\n\nThe Lake Poets\n\nBallast Hills\n\nTurbulence & Metropolis present\n\nDJ sets from…\n\nDJ Fresh\n\nJack Beats\n\nShy FX\n\nFriction\n\nToddla T\n\nDot Rotten\n\nCitizen\n\nCodename:Tyrone\n\nMonday 4 June\n\nSpillers Wharf\n\nDeadmau5\n\nNoah & The Whale\n\nRizzle Kicks\n\nBand Of Skulls\n\nHere We Go Magic\n\nSpector\n\nJessie Ware\n\nThe Milk\n\nMausi\n\nBallast Hills\n\nWax:On presents\n\nDJ sets from…\n\nSBTRKT\n\nTotally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (live)\n\nMaya Jane Coles\n\nEats Everything\n\nJackmaster\n\nPeople Get Real\n\nMike Jones\n\nWhilst the outdoor Bank Holiday Weekend extravaganza is the pinnacle of the Evolution programme we still have much more to announce – including the Evolution Emerging programme, Music Futures and the Jumpin Hot Club programme of shows that will be wrapped around Gateshead venues.\n\nEVOLUTION FESTIVAL Online Links:\n\nWebsite: http://www.evolutionfestival.co.uk\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/#!/EvolutionFest\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/evofest"
