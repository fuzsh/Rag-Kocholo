        "text": "Deadmau5, original name Joel Thomas Zimmerman, (born January 5, 1981, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada), Canadian electronic dance music (EDM) producer and performer who was at the forefront of the revitalization of that genre in the late 2000s.\n\nZimmerman took piano lessons as a child and grew up with a keen interest in video games and computers. As a teenager he started making music with old computer chips, and he co-produced a dance music program at a Niagara Falls radio station. He then became a composer for a stock music company. In 2002 Zimmerman became known as the “dead mouse guy” after telling people in an Internet chat room that he had found a dead mouse in his computer; he then began using the shortened name Deadmau5 as his chat room username. He released his debut full-length album, Get Scraped, under the name Deadmau5 through the San Francisco-based ZOOLOOK records in 2005. His second album, Vexillology (2006), featured a glitchy sound inspired by 8-bit video games and an approach reminiscent of 1990s electronica.\n\nIn 2007 Zimmerman started his own record label, mau5trap records, and in 2008 he won his first Juno Award for dance recording of the year for “All U Ever Want,” a collaboration with Billy Newton-Davis. That year, Deadmau5 broke into the mainstream with Random Album Title, a collection that helped establish his signature dance floor-friendly sound. Random Album Title featured the singles “Faxing Berlin” and “I Remember,” both of which performed well on Billboard’s dance charts, and the album won dance recording of the year at the 2009 Juno Awards. Later albums included For Lack of a Better Name (2009), the Grammy-nominated 4x4=12 (2010), and >album title goes here< (2012). Album Title Goes Here topped the Billboard dance/electronic albums chart and earned Deadmau5 his second Grammy nomination.\n\nIn 2013 Zimmerman and mau5trap partnered with Astralwerks, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. The double album while(1<2) (2014) featured 25 songs and was nearly two and a half hours in length. It reached number one on Billboard’s dance/electronic albums chart and earned Deadmau5 another Grammy nomination.\n\nZimmerman’s Deadmau5 stage persona was easily identifiable by the oversized “mau5head” mask that he wore while performing. In 2013 Zimmerman attempted to trademark his Deadmau5 logo in the United States, but that claim was blocked by the Walt Disney Company the following year. Disney argued that the Deadmau5 logo too closely resembled its classic Mickey Mouse silhouette and asserted that the Deadmau5 logo would damage its business around the world. The two parties reached a settlement in June 2015.\n\nOn May 27, 2016, \"Snowcone\", the first single from Zimmerman in nearly two years, was released as a digital download. This track was later revealed to be the first single from his next album. On November 4, 2016, Zimmerman announced his next album, W:/2016ALBUM/, which was released on December 2, 2016, digitally, with a Vinyl and CD release on February 17, and March 17, 2017, respectively.\n\nOn January 7, 2017, Zimmerman announced a compilation of his earlier work ranging from the years of 1998 to 2007 on Twitter, titled Stuff i used to do. Zimmerman also stated that the compilation would release in February of that year. On February 24, 2017, Zimmerman released a limited version of Stuff i used to do on WeTransfer. The edition, available until March 3, featured only 13 tracks, instead of 16 for the full album. Some of the tracks include \"Messages From Nowhere\", \"HaxPigMeow\" (originally titled 'Get In the Pig Meowingtons'), \"Long Walk Off a Short Pier\", and an alternative mix of \"Creep\" from while(1<2). The album was officially released on mau5trap a week later, on March 3, 2017.\n\nOn March 25, 2017, Zimmerman began a tour with his new \"Cube 2.1\" stage set entitled \"Lots of shows in a row\" to promote the release of W:/2016ALBUM. Zimmerman toured around North America for two months, before touring the rest of the world from June 3, 2017, and Canada from October 6, 2017, with the tour concluding on October 31, 2017.\n\nOn August 25, 2017, Zimmerman released a stand-alone single entitled \"Legendary\", featuring guest vocals from rapper Shotty Horroh. A music video for the song was released on mau5trap's YouTube channel on September 11, 2017.\n\nIn September 2017, Zimmerman confirmed his next album is \"on the way\"."
