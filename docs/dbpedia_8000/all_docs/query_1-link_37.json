        "text": "About this lesson\n\nIn this technical chat for studio lovers, Deadmau5 dispels myths on mastering, talks through his experimentation, plug-ins he uses, idiosyncrasies, the DeadMu5 original sounds (DeadMau5 Pluck), analog synth routing, envelope use (Serum) and cut-offs.\n\nDeadmau5, original name Joel Thomas Zimmerman, (born January 5, 1981, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian electronic dance music (EDM) producer and performer who was at the forefront of the revitalization of that genre in the 2000s. Best known for giant dance music hits like “Ghosts ‘n’ Stuff,” “Strobe” and “I Remember,” Deadmau5 has tried his hand at everything from progressive house to warm atmospherics to the minimal end of the electronic spectrum. He started his own label Mau5trap in 2007.\n\nSubscribe to his channel Mau5 Freaks here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsIr75JRCxNy5Yaxp6WNoEw\n\nFollow Us on Instagram. Like Us on Facebook.
