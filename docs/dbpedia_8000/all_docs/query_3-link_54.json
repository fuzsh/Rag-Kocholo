        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Canadian electronic producer Deadmau5 has been the recipient of plenty of plaudits lately, with three Juno nods and another trio of nominations heading into Sunday's Grammy Awards.\n\nThe only downside? Now the Niagara Falls, Ont., native (nee Joel Zimmerman) has to actually attend the shows, and he admits he has mixed feelings about prize galas.\n\n\"Do you like talking to strangers? Dealing with weird (things)?\" he asked rhetorically during a recent interview when asked about his feelings toward the award circuit.\n\n\"Some people find it fun. I find it interesting because it gives me this massive audience to do this funny (stuff),\" added Zimmerman, who strolls red carpets with his signature mouse helmet fixed atop his head, and who was photographed on the 2009 Grammys crimson carpet with a T-shirt reading \"No pictures.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old is scheduled to perform at Sunday's gala in an all-star tribute to electronic music alongside Foo Fighters, David Guetta, Lil Wayne and Chris Brown. The salute will take place just outside the Staples Center in a large white tent.\n\nHis nominations include a nod for best dance album for 2010's \"4x4\n\n12,\" which has been certified platinum in Canada. But he laments how long it's been since he's had the chance to make new music, given that he spent most of the past year on a marquee tour that included a massive show at Toronto's cavernous Rogers Centre.\n\n\"Last year was the year of the tour -- you know, not much music-making actually happened,\" he said.\n\n\"It's all just been about the show and progressing the show up to the Rogers Centre point, which is more or less the pinnacle of that version of the show. And now we're in the stages of ripping it all apart and coming up with some next big thing.\"\n\nHe says he's now having a studio built in Toronto, so soon he'll have the chance to stay put and begin work on new music.\n\n\"I can finally have a room that's controlled and I won't have to fly off to Kuwait or London or L.A. to get a record done,\" he said.\n\n\"I can hang out at home. Do music. That's it.\"\n\nBut the awards show circuit doesn't end after the Grammys -- the Juno Awards will be handed out April 1 in Ottawa and Deadmau5 is scheduled to perform."
