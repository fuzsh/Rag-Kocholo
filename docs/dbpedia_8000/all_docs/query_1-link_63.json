I'd love to do a soundtrack to a movie. I don't even want any credit, I just want to do it for my own personal satisfaction. Because, you know, aside from being a club conductor/electronic music maker guy, I'm also very keen on sound design and transparent recordings. .... \"(from ResidentAdvisor interview by Todd L. Burns)\n\nIpse dixit: \"............You're more likely to be successful if you can stand behind everything involved with your work. You don't want to be like (Jersey Shore cast member and DJ) Pauly D, standing there fist pumping on stage while some kid in Norway is writing and producing all of your music for you. That's just cheap, and no one respects that. If you can't do it all then you're just not going to stand out. \" (from Guitar Center interview )\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJoel Thomas Zimmerman (born January 5, 1981), better known by his stage name deadmau5 (pronounced \"dead mouse\"), is a Canadian progressive-house music producer and performer from Toronto, Ontario.\n\nZimmerman produces a variety of styles within the house genre and sometimes other forms of electronic dance music.

According to Zimmerman's father, he said that it smelled like burnt wire and had a strange odor. Zimmerman started to dismantle his computer and happened to find a dead mouse. Zimmerman then became known as the \"dead mouse guy\" among friends. Joel tried to change his name to \"Deadmouse\" in the chat room, but it was too long, so he shortened it to \"deadmau5\", which is a form of leet In an interview with CBC Television, he mentioned that when he started making music, he went by the name \"deadmau5\". Joel created the original logo while learning how to use some 3D modelling software The \"mau5head\" appears in many different colors and designs, and has been shown on the cover of most of Zimmerman's albums, with the exceptions of At Play and Vexillology. He was given the idea to wear a headdress based on the logo by one of his friends, Jay Gordon of the industrial metal band Orgy. In an interview with CBC Television, Zimmerman said that he wants his logo to be an \"icon\". Fans often attend Deadmau5 concerts sporting their own copy of the mau5head.\n\nHe created \"deadmau5.com\" and began uploading songs to SectionZ and producing under the alias \"deadmau5\" in 2002 (sourse Wikipedia)\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCanadian native Joel Zimmerman, more commonly known asdeadmau5 (pronounced \"dead mouse\"), didn't set out to become a groundbreaking electronic artist. He just made some music and it happened to change the game and pop culture as we know it.\n\nUp to this point, his career stands earmarked by a series of firsts and shattered records. At the 54th annual Grammy Awards in 2012, he gave a monumental performance as part of the prestigious ceremony's first-ever telecast celebrating electronic music. He's also the first electronic artist in history to grace the cover of Rolling Stone. His sold out show at Toronto's Rogers Centre, documented on the MEOWINGTONS HAX 2k11 DVD, and London’s Earl’s Court, documented on the deadmau5 live @ earl’s court DVD, made him the first Canadian artist as well as the first electronic artist to headline both venues.\n\nDeadmau5 dropped three critically acclaimed albums: 4×4=12, For Lack Of A Better Name and Random Album Titleand seen international chart success with singles \"Sofi Needs A Ladder,\" \"Ghosts 'n' Stuff\" and \"I Remember.\" In addition, he's notched multiple JUNO Awards and received three Grammy Award nominations.\n\nHe also performed at the 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards as part of its first ever telecast performance highlighting electronic music. His fan base speaks the loudest though. He's garnered over 6.5 million fans on his Facebook page and over 1.3 million followers on Twitter. Plus, deadmau5 remains an impressive concert draw, headlining the biggest festivals in North America Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Sonar, Virgin Mobile FreeFest, Ultra Music Festival and Electric Daisy Carnival.\n\nHe was the first Canadian and electronic artist to sell out Rogers Centre in Toronto. He also broke a record held by Rage Against the Machine for most consecutive shows at the Roseland Ballroom in NYC with a staggering six nights at the iconic venue. He adorned the cover of Rolling Stone's summer double issue in 2012, another first for an EDM artist.
