        "text": "Besides artists who already have profiles at the Canadian Music Blog, popularity of the maple blazers listed below intensified in 2015. Some have been at it for a little while and others completely broke through during the year.\n\nAlessia Cara\n\nBrampton, Ontario’s Alessia Cara (short for Caracciolo) is an R&B singer of Italian descent. She gained popularity at 18 years of age with hit single “Here” which lyrically is about those who secretly hate parties and musically follows a vibe originally done by Isaac Hayes, later used by Portishead and Tricky. The song eventually went multiplatinum in Canada and made the Top 10 in the United States. Alessia had been at it for a while posting covers on YouTube. She signed a deal with Def Jam Recordings and released an EP and full length album. Cara performed at a number of high profile American chat shows and was brought on stage by Taylor Swift at the final concert of her 1989 tour.\n\nFrancesco Yates\n\nDue to his natural talent, Toronto’s Francesco Yates was signed by Atlantic Records when he was only 16. He broke out three years later with “Better To Be Loved”, a Top 40 hit in 2015. Though a non-Top 40 hit in Canada (it peaked at #42), “Sugar” by German house music maker Robin Schulz featuring Francesco’s vocals topped the charts or peaked at #2/#3 in several European countries as well as Australia. It was a big hit in Germany, France, Austria, Italy, Belgium, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland.\n\nJess Moskaluke\n\nFrom the humble town of Langenburg, Saskatchewan, country artist Jess Moskaluke took the field by storm, a realm heavily dominated these days by Americans and men. As a Canadian female soloist, she scored the first gold single since Shania Twain, won the CCMA female artist of the year award thrice, had her LP Light Up the Night nominated for album of the year, and landed two Top 10 Billboard country radio hits in 2015: “Kiss Me Quiet” and collaboration with Paul Brandt “I’m an Open Road”. In 2017, her mini album Kiss Me Quiet won the JUNO Award for Country Album of the Year.\n\nShawn Hook\n\nA native of the rural area of South Slocan, British Columbia, Shawn Hook scored a couple of minor hits circa his debut album Cosmonaut and the Girl in 2012. With things ending for record label EMI, Shawn was scooped up by Universal and generated tremendous buzz with hit “Million Ways” which he co-wrote with Grammy winning songwriter Victoria Horn. Followup “Sound of Your Heart” continued generating steam through much of the year and catapulted Shawn Hook to platinum status. He released second album Analog Love in 2015. Shawn scored a second platinum single in 2017 with Vanessa Hudgens: “Reminding Me”.\n\nThe Weeknd\n\nThe Torontonian’s brand of alt-RnB managed to break through by his combining three indie albums into one package, Trilogy, in 2012. It attained double platinum sales in Canada, with track “Wicked Games” nesting itself just outside the Top 40. The Weeknd’s feature in Drake’s “Crew Love” became a Top 40 hit in Britain. He signed with Universal Republic, but followup album Kiss Land did not do as well as hoped, and a team of ace writers and producers were called in to slick things up for his next album, including Sweden’s Max Martin. The strategy that paid off was having him team up with American singer Ariana Grande. “Love Me Harder” became a Top 10 hit in both Canada and The United States. Strategy #2 was having him do a song featured in a Hollywood blockbuster. “Earned It” from the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack became a multiplatinum single. With that, The Weeknd was a hit internationally. Album Beauty Behind the Madness, one of the year’s top sellers, placed not one but two songs at the summit of the charts: “Can’t Feel My Face” and “The Hills”. In 2016, The Weeknd released album Starboy. The title track topped the charts.\n\nYoan\n\nWinner of The Voice 2014, baritone country singer Yoan (Garneau) of Ferme-Neuve, Quebec, released his debut eponymous album in 2015. The bilingual work topped the albums charts and struck platinum sales. The album features collaborations with Alberta’s Brett Kissel and Yoan’s coach from The Voice, Isabelle Boulay. It was the second biggest 2015 album on the Billboard year-end albums chart and won a Canadian Country Music Association award.\n\nMore…\n\nMontreal potpourri artist Bernard Adamus went gold with his 2009 debut album Brun, and his third, Sorel Soviet So What, topped the Billboard albums chart in 2015. Thunder Bay folktronica artist Coleman Hell scored platinum single “2 Heads”. He will be releasing an album through Sony’s Columbia Records in 2016. Calgary’s Jocelyn Alice went gold with “Jackpot” and signed a deal with Sony affiliate Disruptor Records. An album is expected in 2016. Mont-Laurier, Quebec’s Kevin Bazinet, winner of The Voice 2015, launched his debut album and scored a Billboard Hot 100 hit. Halifax’s Ria Mae got snatched up by Sony and went gold with single “Clothes Off”. At the tender age of 19, Toronto’s Scott Helman landed his first gold single with “Bungalow”.\n\nAndee\n\nHailing from Quebec City suburbs; touring Asia as member of all-girl group Akasha; performing with Lionel Richie and finishing in the Top 5 of talent show Star Académie; drawing comparisons to Adele; featured on double platinum and platinum compilation albums; appearing in the bilingual versions of Hedley’s “Kiss You Inside Out” and Shawn Desman’s “Dum Da Dum”; getting signed by Universal Music Canada; teaming with Simple Plan songwriter and producer Sébastien Lefebvre; launching her career in English; contributing track “We Are Gold” to the CBC’s coverage of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi; seeing her formal debut single, “Never Gone” reach the Billboard Canadian Hot 100’s Top 40; touring with Demi Lovato; and co-writing “Sorries” with Pink; Andrée-Anne Leclerc, now known as Andee, is all set for an illustrious career.\n\nA Tribe Called Red\n\nThis Ottawa trio created new genre of music “powwow step” by combining modern electronic dance music with Aboriginal chants and drumming. With a passionate, growing fan base and popularity on the club circuit, the group’s second album Nation II Nation saw its renown skyrocket. A Tribe Called Red declined entry into the JUNO Aboriginal Album department for 2014 taking the risk of going straight for mainstream category Breakthrough Group of the Year, normally heavily dominated by White popular rock bands. Needless to say, the group won.\n\nCrystal Shawanda\n\nC rystal Shawanda was born in the Wikwemikong Native Reservation which is situated on Manitoulin Island (Lake Huron, southwest of Sudbury). She is of proud Ojibwa heritage. Signed in 2007 to RCA/Sony (Nashville), she launched a career in country music. Her debut album Dawn of a New Day entered the Billboard U.S. Top Country Albums chart at #16 becoming the highest charted album by a full-blooded Canadian First Nations country artist in the Nielsen SoundScan era. The album landed four songs on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. Crystal’s album Just Like You won a JUNO Award. In 2014, she switched genres releasing a stunning blues album, The Whole World’s Got the Blues.\n\nKiesza\n\nCalgary’s Kiesza topped the UK Singles chart before most Canadians had heard of her. Retro 90s dance charmer “Hideaway” eventually hit platinum in Canada helped in part by a concept music video of bustin’ moves on Brooklyn streets, shot in one take. “Giant In My Heart” and an EP quickly followed, and by the end of the year, Kiesza’s debut album Sound of a Woman, hit record shops. Live performances of dancing while singing without running out of breath on Letterman, the MMVAs, and other spectacles anchored her credibility.\n\nMAGIC!\n\nAfter songs he produced won Grammy awards in the U.S., Canada’s Nasri Atweh (of production duo The Messengers) formed reggae pop band MAGIC! with his Toronto buddies. Debut single “Rude” became the biggest Canadian song of 2014 globally. It was discovered first in Australia and climbed the charts to #3 before most Canadians knew they had a new band. “Rude” topped the charts in both the U.K. and U.S. At home, it was certified multiplatinum and became only the 3rd song from a home-grown artist to spend over a year on the Hot 100. With the release of the band’s debut album, two further songs made the weekly Top 40. Album Primary Colours followed in 2016 which spawned further hits for the group.\n\nSerge Fiori\n\nIn the 1970s, Serge Fiori was lead singer of multiplatinum progressive rock band Harmonium. After the band split in 1978, he teamed up with Richard Séguin on an album. In the 80s he began writing songs for other artists, most notably Diane Dufresne and Nanette Workman and released his own solo album in 1986. He also penned the theme song for internationally renowned Canadian comedy production Just For Laughs. In the 90s, Serge began scoring movie soundtracks and also dabbled in new age music. In 2014 he made a huge comeback releasing a self-titled LP that struck platinum and placed a track in the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. It was voted Album of the Year via a poll conducted by the CBC.\n\nShawn Mendes\n\nThis breakout sparkly-eyed teen sensation from Pickering, ON posted a six-second video on Vine that turned him into a household name. He won Ryan Seacrest’s (American DJ) Best Cover Song competition and was signed to Island Records. Shawn’s debut single, “Life of the Party,” reached #1 on iTunes on the night of June 25-26 and became a Top 10 hit on the Canadian Hot 100. In the United States, Shawn became the youngest artist to debut in the top 25 with a first song on the Billboard Hot 100. With millions of Twitter followers, a 2015 tour with American superstar Taylor Swift, and a debut LP that topped the album charts and spawned further hit singles, he is on his way to a big career. In 2016, Shawn released second album Illuminate with further global hit songs. He performed at a number of international awards shows.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nRegarded by many as one of the world’s most talented voice musicians, Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq has worked with Iceland’s Björk. She hails from Cambridge Bay, NU and released her 4th album in 2014, Animism, chock full of eclectic instrumentation. The critically acclaimed album nabbed the Polaris Music Prize given to the year’s most artistic work. Her mesmerizing performance at the gala, given in conjunction with scrolling names of missing and murdered Aboriginal women, brought down the house. Tanya is a multiple JUNO nominee.\n\nLily C.\n\nOpting to dabble in the realm of adult contemporary / easy listening which offers us music that is delicate, sweet, light, and fun is new Toronto singer-songwriter Lily C. (the C stands for Cheng). Lily began her musical career on a trip to east Asia undertaken to get in touch with her ancestral roots. She began writing and performing her songs drawing large audiences, released an independent album, Perfect Moment, and worked as a DJ and TV host. When ill health struck her family, she returned to Canada in 2007 touring Ontario and writing new songs. In 2012, Lily released her first album in Canada, Reaching for Sunlight, which was featured on the CBC. “Take Your Shoes Off” was the most popular track while “I Am a Bee” was named by The Canadian Music Blog as one of the ten best songs of 2012.\n\nJohnny Reid\n\nJohnny is a naturalized Canadian adult contemporary singer originally from Scotland. He has won several JUNO awards. Although he has scored a number of hit singles on the country charts, he has done best in terms of sales in the albums department. All of his last 5 LPs have been certified platinum or better. His first album, Another Day, Another Dime came out in 1997. He began receiving attention with his second self-titled work with radio airplay. It was his third album, Born to Roll, in 2005 and lead single “You Still Own Me” (later covered by Emerson Drive) where things took off. Reid released Fire It Up in 2012, three of its tracks making an appearance on the Canadian Hot 100. The album itself went platinum making it one of the most successful Canadian albums of the year. 2015 album What Love Is All About debuted at #3 on the Billboard charts.\n\nMassari\n\nTrilingual Massari is a very talented Canadian R&B singer from Ottawa known for his culturally rich sound. His debut, JUNO-nominated, self-titled 2006 album was certified gold and spawned several hit singles including “Be Easy”. But before that Massari had started out in the early years of the new millennium releasing singles. “Spitfire” was aired on radio stations in Ottawa. Massari’s songs have been popular internationally many recorded under local record label CP Records. In 2012, Massari released new single “Brand New Day” which came within a hair’s breadth of the Top 40 (#41 on the Canadian Hot 100). Massari has collaborated with label mates Belly and Mia Martina.\n\nLes Trois Accords\n\nDrummondville, Québec’s alternative rock band Les Trois Accords have scored a number of big hit singles; to date eight have appeared in CKOI’s year-end Top 50. They have been nominated for 19 Félix awards winning 4 of them and been nominated for a JUNO twice. The band has always emphasized art over logic adding dashes of humour and idiosyncrasy bordering on the absurd. Their debut studio LP was released in 2003 and then re-released as Gros mammouth album turbo the following year with 2 bonus tracks. It was a platinum album. In 2005 it was nominated for a JUNO and won the Félix for Best-Selling Album of the Year, the band being named Group of the Year. Les Trois Accords’ second album went gold and won the Félix for Rock Album of the Year. Their fourth album secured their second JUNO nomination in 2010. The band released its fifth studio album, J’aime ta grand-mère, in 2012. It pays tribute to some indie and garage rock, punk, and British new wave. As well, country legend Renée Martel makes an appearance on one of the tracks. The album’s title track made the weekly Canadian Hot 100 at the end of December. Album Joie d’etre gai followed in 2015.\n\nElisapie\n\nThe northern third of Québec is known as Nunavik, 90% of whose inhabitants are Inuit living in some 14 villages around the coast. The second northernmost of these is Salluit, on the Sugluk Inlet, with a population of about 1,350 and apparently rapidly growing. It is not accessible by road, only by air. This is where Canadian recording artist Elisapie Isaac grew up. Her mother was Inuk and father from Newfoundland. Adopted at birth, she was raised by an Inuit family and was no doubt enriched by learning this beautiful culture. She is now based in Montréal. The press has commented that, although from the icy north, she has a voice and a stage presence that succeeds in melting the hearts of her audience. Elisapie first appeared in a duo with Alain Auger called Taima whose self-titled (and only) album won the JUNO for Aboriginal Recording of the Year in 2005. Her solo debut, trilingual, jazzy folk album, There Will Be Stars, was released in 2009 and sold 25,000 copies which was enough to attract attention south of the border. For her second work, Travelling Love, in 2012, Elisapie decided to move to a more pop/rock sound while retaining some of her folk roots. Track “The Love You Gave” was named by iTunes as “single of the week”.\n\nKarl Wolf\n\nKarl is a naturalized Canadian (originally from Lebanon) based in Montreal. He sings, composes, and produces as well. He began his musical odyssey as backup singer for Felix award winning band Dubmatique and then went on as the new lead singer for popular band Sky. His debut solo album Face Behind the Face was released in 2006 and 3 subsequent LPs came out thereafter, including 2012’s Finally Free. He has been nominated for 3 JUNO awards. Thus far, his greatest success has been in the singles department. He has scored 4 gold songs, and his 2008 reworking of Toto’s “Africa” was certified triple platinum. In 2012, Karl Wolf’s “Mash It Up” was the 94th biggest hit of the year.\n\nBelly\n\nBelly is the stage name of Palestine-born rapper Ahmed Balshe and is taken from the word rebellious. He was signed onto Ottawa-based record label Capital Prophet Records (which later relocated to Toronto and became known as CP Records). Belly’s debut album, The Revolution, released in 2007, won the JUNO award for Rap Recording of the Year and achieved Gold Certification. The best-known track from the album was “Pressure”. This was a double-album centered on humanistic themes. Disc 1 was titled “The People” and Disc 2, “The System”. Like most rappers, Belly has collaborated with singers, most notably Danny Fernandes, The Weeknd, and Josh Ramsay (Marianas Trench). He is a supportive fan of the Ottawa Senators.\n\nDerek Miller\n\nDerek is a blues guitarist singer-songwriter from the largest First Nation in Canada, Six Nations of the Grand River (Ontario) which consists of Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora. After getting into music in his teens, his profile was heightened when he toured with Buffy Sainte-Marie in the late 1990s. He was offered a deal with Winnipeg’s Arbor Records and released his debut album, Music is the Medicine, in 2002. The track “Lovesick Blues” won the JUNO for Aboriginal Recording of the Year. The Dirty Looks followed, winning for him his second JUNO in 2008. Derek Miller was invited to perform alongside Eva Avila and Nikki Yanofsky during the Closing Ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver. He released his third album that year, Double Trouble.\n\nEmmalyn Estrada\n\nEmmalyn is the younger sister of British Columbia Filipina-Canadian R&B star Elise Estrada. When she was 17, she won a singing contest hosted by Vancouver radio station The Beat 94.5 FM and released the single “Get Down” two months later. This was nominated by the CRMA (Canadian Radio Music Awards) in the Dance / Urban / Rhythmic category. In October, she relocated to Los Angeles and teamed up with record producer Chris Stokes of label TUG (The Ultimate Group). Single “Don’t Make Me Let You Go” followed. She returned to Vancouver in 2011 to perform at several festivals and has joined Adam H’s new record label XOXO Entertainment with her sister Elise. She became one of five members of American-British-Canadian girl group GRL which scored a couple of international hits in 2014 before disbanding in 2015 following the death of member Simone Battle.\n\nK.Maro\n\nBorn Cyril Kamar in Lebanon, K.Maro relocated to Montreal when he was 11. He is a rapper / singer-songwriter who performs in both English and French, occasionally throwing in some Arabic. K.Maro is also a producer and has his own record label, K.Pone.Inc. He started out in a successful Québec rap duo called LMDS (Les Messagers du Son) in the late 1990s. Debuting in 2002 as a soloist, he has already released several albums which have seen international success, most notably in Europe. Three of his singles have made the year-end Top 50 charts in Québec: “Femme Like You” (#8 of 2004), “Let’s Go” (#38 of 2007), and “Music” (#30 of 2010). He has collaborated with several artists including Belly and Corneille. K.Maro has opened a clothing line called Balbec, named after the town where he was born.\n\nMarc Hervieux\n\nSimply put, Marc Hervieux, graduate of the Montréal Conservatory of Music, is now one of the most popular Canadian opera singers in the world. He has performed in such countries as Russia, Israel, the United States, Spain, France, China, and South Korea. He was invited to put on a private concert in honour of the king of Sweden. Having a natural attraction for a wide variety of musical styles, Marc has also collaborated – onstage or on CD – with several Canadian popular recording artists including Ginette Reno, Sylvain Cossette, Isabelle Boulay, and Patsy Gallant. Three of Marc’s albums have received Gold Certification in Canada: Apres Nous contains both classic and original French songs; A Napoli is dedicated to Neopolitan songs from Italy; and Le Premier Noël, an album of mostly French traditional Christmas songs. His Tenor Arias won the 2010 Felix Award for classical vocal album of the year.\n\nStef Lang\n\nStef Lang, a Canadian of proud Eurasian heritage (German-Filipina), was born in Nanaimo BC, but grew up in Ladysmith (also on Vancouver Island). At 17, she relocated to Vancouver to pursue a career in music. She won a contest in 2006 by local radio station The Beat FM and was offered a four-song record deal with producers Mike James (Kelly Rowland) and Troy Samson (Kreesha Turner, Snoop Dogg). In the space of four years, Lang had written over 250 songs and released a couple of EPs. She was eventually signed by Nettwerk and released a digital album in 2010. Besides having an amazing voice and composing her own songs, Stef Lang learned both piano and guitar; she has all the ingredients for a credible superstar. Thus far, her best-known songs are “Mr. Immature” and “Slave 2 Love”. In 2012, she released the new single “Paper Doll” from EP Fighting Mirrors which received radio airply. She was featured on 2 tracks off Delerium’s album Music Box Opera and released her second LP Self, followed by extended play works.\n\nJapan had Speed and Stereopony, France L5, Italy Lollipop, Britain The Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Bananarama, the U.S. Destiny’s Child, The Runaways, The Go-Go’s, and The Bangles. How about Canada?\n\nCanada has had a surprising number of all-female acts over the years. Many of these were indie bands or outside of the pop/rock umbrella. There were a few, however, that enjoyed radio hits, were honoured at the JUNOS, scored gold records, and achieved some international success.\n\nMost prefer to note the distinction between girl groups and female rock bands. Girl groups and boy groups simply sing and harmonize together with others writing their songs and playing musical instruments for them. Female rock bands, in contrast, write their own songs and play their own instruments. Canada has had examples of both over the years.\n\nWhen such acts hit the mainstream, they tend to become extremely popular, so one may wonder why there weren’t more of them. We have seen that, since the early 90s, few male soloist superstars have emerged unless they did something outside of mainstream rock and roll. They have preferred, instead, to form rock bands. Canadian women, in contrast, have usually preferred to go solo. Part of the answer lies in understanding the differences in Canadian male and female culture, values, and attitudes. Rather than going into this, let’s take a look at some of the Canadian all-female acts. We will not include female duos but those groups consisting of three or more members.\n\nIndie all-female acts include Cub, Magneta Lane, Fifth Column, Maow (sometimes called Meow), Jale, Ladies of the Canyon, The Organ, Plumtree, and Pony Up. The Be Good Tanyas, The Wailin’ Jennys, and The Good Lovelies were fairly successful folk/country bands. Below are mini-profiles of some of the better-known pop/rock groups.\n\nKittie\n\nThis is a four-member JUNO-nominated female heavy metal group from London, ON that formed in 1996. They have, since then, released six studio albums and have had success in the United States and Britain. The band’s debut album Spit went GOLD in the United States, as their song “Brackish” became a hit in heavy metal circles. Kittie formed when two members met during an extracurricular gymnastics class. The band is still active and released its sixth studio album I’ve Failed You in August 2011.\n\nSugar Jones\n\nThis R&B girl group was assembled via Popstars, a televised reality series that was a precursor to Canadian Idol. Five members were selected out of thousands of applicants. In 2001, the group released a platinum album, scored the huge hit “Days Like That,” a cover of Fierce’s song, and were nominated for two JUNOs the following year. The five disbanded and three members have released material as soloists, the most prolific of which is Julie Crochetière.\n\nLillix\n\nThis pop/rock band began as Tigerlily during high school in Cranbrook, BC. In 2001, Lillix was signed by Maverick Records, releasing debut album Falling Uphill two years later. Three singles were released including a cover of The Romantics’ “What I Like About You” which was featured in the Freaky Friday and 13 Going on 30 soundtracks. They received two JUNO nominations in 2004. After their second album Inside the Hollow and single “Sweet Temptation”, Maverick Records folded and two members left the band. The group reformed with added male members and is no longer an all-female group.\n\nLiveonRelease\n\nThis short-lived pop/punk band from Vancouver enjoyed the hit single “I’m Afraid of Britney Spears” which appeared on the Dude, Where’s My Car? soundtrack. They released albums in 2002 and 2003 before disbanding. Lead vocalist Colette Trudeau is Métis. Lead guitarist Brittin Karroll has written songs with Bif Naked. The two other members of the band were Foxx Herst (bass) and Leah Emmott (drums). The band’s name comes from basketball jargon.\n\nShaye\n\nThis was a trio of high-profile Canadian female recording artists from Atlantic Canada: Kim Stockwood, Damhnait Doyle, and Tara MacLean. The group was not as successful as the individual artists’ solo careers; however, Shaye’s song “Happy Baby” received a JUNO nomination in 2004 for Single of the Year. They released two albums before calling it quits. Doyle is now with the indie band The Heartbroken. Stockwood is still active as a soloist, releasing the album Back to the Water in March 2011. MacLean released studio album Wake in 2008.\n\nTuuli\n\nVocalist/guitarist Jenny MacIsaac, guitarist Jen Blackwood, bassist Claire Blake, and drummer Naomi Langworthy formed this Toronto-based pop/punk band in 1995. They toured both sides of the 49th parallel to packed houses and were interviewed by VH1. Their only album, Here We Go (Warner), came out in 2002. MuchMusic began showcasing the MV for “Who’s the Fool Now?” but it was “It’s Over” that became a #4 hit in Canada. “Summer Song” was their third single. They toured for the next two years but dropped off the map after that, sadly.\n\nWest End Girls\n\nThis was a beloved Vancouver-based early-90s teenage trio consisting of Camille Henderson (daughter of Chilliwack frontman Bill Henderson), Aimee MacKenzie, and Silvana Petrozzi. The West End is a ritzy area of downtown Vancouver. Their debut (self-titled) album was released in 1991 and spawned two Top 40 singles and two Top 10 hits: “Not Like Kissing You” (which made the year-end Top 100) and “I Want U Back” (cover of the Jackson 5 song). The album was certified GOLD and The West End Girls received a JUNO nomination for Most Promising New Group of the Year. They toured with Roxette. First Petrozzi then Henderson left the band in 1992 and were replaced by Janele Woodley and Celia-Louise Martin respectively. The new lineup released their second album We Belong Together in 1993. “R U Sexin Me” and “Pure” received JUNO nominations. As their sophomore album did not sell as well as their first, the group broke up in 1994.\n\nMORE…\n\nMad June Caveboy The Courtneys The Beaches\n\nIn the Autumn, I was walking along in the Collingwood neighbourhood of Vancouver. A young Chinese-Canadian woman beside me suddenly gasped and pointed to a street lined with trees. The sky was completely blue. The sight of the leaves glistening in the sun was spectacular. They were green, chartreuse, yellow, orange, vermillion, red, burgundy, and purple. The year 2011 in sound was similar to that sight; there was a diversity of musical styles being created. Moreover, there were a number of new faces this year, and Canadian artists of Asian descent are on the rise which is very encouraging. Is Canada going to take on a leadership role in the western world in this regard?\n\nCanadians of West Asian descent who enjoyed hits this year included Kristina Maria. Her “Let’s Play” was the 64th biggest song of the year. Karl Wolf is another name. This year he teamed up with Kardinal Offishall in the song “Ghetto Love” which was 67th.\n\nA Canadian of South Asian heritage was Anjulie whose parents immigrated from Guyana, South America. “Brand New Chick” was a platinum single and the 52nd most popular song of the year. Raghav’s “Fire” went gold and was 94th.\n\nAnother positive element of 2011 was a burgeoning of Canadian dance music, a genre the output of which has seen Canada historically lag behind other countries. We are becoming masters of the genre, and artists like Dragonette, Deadmau5, Kristina Maria, Mia Martina, and Alfa Rococo are spinning some delicious tunes that make sitting still impossible.\n\nInterestingly, the biggest albums of the year were Christmas albums: Michael Bublé’s jazzy Christmas (7x Platinum) and Justin Bieber’s R&B-ish Under the Mistletoe (3x Platinum). This was true both domestically and internationally. Besides those two, the other best-selling Canadian albums globally were rapper Drake’s Take Care, Avril Lavigne’s pop-oriented Goodbye Lullaby, Justin Bieber’s Never Say Never: the Remixes, and Nickelback’s heavy metal release Here and Now.\n\nThe most successful Canadian artist internationally in terms of a hit single was Avril Lavigne whose “What the Hell” was the highest-charting Canadian single. This includes the world’s three largest markets for music: the United States, Japan (where it was 10th of the year), and Britain. In the world’s most populous nation, China, it was 11th. It was also the most successful Canadian single in Australia. Domestically, there was much more going on in terms of hit singles.\n\nInternational Success of Avril Lavigne’s “What the Hell” in 2011:\n\nYear-End Chart Weekly Chart Peak Rank Among Canadian Singles Canada 63 6 U.K. n/a 16 1 U.S. 62 1 Japan 10 1 China 11 1 Australia 48 1\n\nTop Singles of the Year\n\nThe highest charting song entirely by a Canadian artist was the aforementioned “What the Hell” by Avril Lavigne, which peaked at #8 on the weekly singles chart and was the 63rd biggest song of 2011. “Hello”, a collaborative effort by Toronto synth-pop group Dragonette and Martin Solveig of Paris, France, enjoyed the highest position partially by a Canadian artist on the Top 100 singles of 2011 (#11) and was the most successful in terms of sales, achieving double-platinum digital download status.\n\nThe biggest song of 2011 entirely by a Canadian artist was “Alone Again” by Alyssa Reid (#24). This was a reworking of Heart’s song “Alone”. In terms of an original song entirely by a Canadian performer, honours would go to Fefe Dobson for her “Stutterin'” which was the 45th biggest song of the year.\n\nSimple Plan’s “Jet Lag”, which featured U.K. singer Natasha Bedingfield, was 37th and was certified platinum. They also recorded a French version of the song which featured Québec’s Marie-Mai. Romanian Edward Maya’s song “Stereo Love”, which featured New Brunswick’s Mia Martina, was 34th. And Barbados’ Rihanna was at #32 with “What’s My Name” a song that featured Drake.\n\nOther platinum digital downloads besides those mentioned above were “Brand New Chick” by Guyanese-Canadian Anjulie, “Electric” by Portuguese-Canadian Shawn Desman, Hedley’s “Invincible”, Nickelback’s “When We Stand Together”, and Marianas Trench’s “Haven’t Had Enough”.\n\nOnly 2 songs involving Canadian artists made the Top 10 on the British weekly charts this year, both being collaborations between Drake and Rihanna: “What’s My Name” (#1) and “Take Care” (#9). The most successful song entirely by a Canadian artist in the U.K. was “What the Hell” by Avril Lavigne (#16).\n\nThings were similar south of the border. “What’s My Name” was the 20th biggest song of the year in the United States. Avril Lavigne’s “What the Hell” was the most successful song there that was not a collaboration between a Canadian and an international artist. It was 62nd of the year.\n\nThe biggest Canadian song in Japan – the world’s 2nd largest market for music after the U.S. – was Avril Lavigne’s “What the Hell” which was the 10th most popular song of the year there.\n\nAccording to Montreal’s CKOI FM 96.9, the five most popular Francophone songs of the year were as follows:\n\n1. Vincent Vallières’ “On va s’aimer encore” (#4)\n\n2. Marie-Mai’s “Comme avant” (#15)\n\n3. William Deslauriers’ “Je lève mon verre” (#35)\n\n4. Clément Jacques’ “Ariane” (#37)\n\n5. David Jalbert’s “P’tit homme” (#43)\n\nTen songs were nominated for single of the year at the Félix gala held in October. These are listed below with the winner being Vincent Vallières’ “On va s’aimer encore”.\n\n10 Felix-Nominated Songs\n\n“Météore”, Alfa Rococo\n\n“Fruits défendus”, Brigitte Boisjoli\n\n“J’taime pas, j’t’adore”, Nicola Ciccone\n\n“Près de toi”, Martin Deschamps\n\n“Jusqu’au bout”, Éric Lapointe\n\n“Elle s’appelait Serge”, Les Trois Accords\n\n“Comme avant”, Marie-Mai\n\n“Toujours de nous”, Mario Pelchat\n\n“Je repars”, David Usher, Marie-Mai\n\n“On va s’aimer encore”, Vincent Vallières\n\nThe biggest song of the year in Canada this year was from Britain’s Adele—”Rolling in the Deep”.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the JUNO awards in April next year will award in terms of singles, given that there are so many collaborations with foreign artists, covers, and partial covers.\n\nBelow is a table of the most successful singles in 2011, all having at least one of the following characteristics:\n\na) Was on the Billboard Canadian Top 100 singles of 2011 chart\n\nb) Peaked in the Top 20 on the weekly Billboard Canadian Hot 100 singles chart during 2011\n\nc) Was awarded gold / platinum certification (singles on the Top 100 of 2010 or that peaked on the weekly charts of 2010 receiving certification this year are not included)\n\nNote: Most of the Top 20 songs that did not make the Top 100 of 2011 appeared late in the year and will most likely appear on the Top 100 of 2012 chart next year. Foreign artists (with whom Canadians collaborated) are in blue.\n\n2011 Singles Comprehensive Chart\n\nSong Artist 2011 WP C Hello Martin Solveig, Dragonette 11 8 2xP Alone Again Alyssa Reid 24 11 G What’s My Name?

G\n\nTop Albums of the Year\n\nThere were an astounding number of albums released this year. With a sharp decline in record sales over the past few years, it is a huge honour just to score a gold album these days, something that was pretty much guaranteed for an album with a radio hit in years past. By the end of the year, 8 albums released in 2011 received gold certifications, 2 platinum, and 3 multi-platinum.\n\nThe most successful albums of the year by Canadian artists were Christmas albums. Michael Bublé’s Christmas was certified 7x platinum and Justin Bieber’s Under the Mistletoe 3x platinum. Nickelback’s Here and Now was a double-platinum release. The best-selling Francophone album was Maxime Landry’s L’avenir entre nous (platinum). At the October Félix gala, most popular album accolades went to Ginette Reno for La musique en moi. Hedley’s Storms was certified platinum at the end of the year.\n\nAll albums mentioned above (with the exception of L’avenir entre nous) made it to #1 on the weekly albums chart. Additionally were City and Colour’s Little Hell, Justin Bieber’s Never Say Never: the Remixes, and Drake’s Take Care.\n\nThe biggest album of the year in Canada was 21 by Britain’s Adele which was certified diamond, the first studio album to do so since Céline Dion’s These Are Special Times 4 years ago.\n\nBelow is a table of all albums released in 2011 with at least one of the following characteristics:\n\na) Was awarded gold / platinum certification\n\nb) Was on the Billboard Canadian Top 50 albums of 2011 chart\n\nc) Peaked in the Top 5 on the Billboard Canadian weekly albums chart during 2011\n\nWe will continue updating new levels of certification for these 2011 albums through 2012.\n\n2011 Albums Comprehensive Chart\n\nAlbum Artist C 2011 WP Christmas Michael Buble 8xP 16 1 Under the Mistletoe Justin Bieber 3xP 36 1 Here and Now Nickelback 2xP 1 Little Hell City and Colour P 40 1 Storms Hedley P 2 Metals Feist P 2 L’avenir entre nous Maxime Landry P Mixmania2 (Various Artists) G 46 4 L’existoire Richard Desjardins G 49 2 Better Be Home Soon George Canyon G Undercover Me 2 Jann Arden G Dans le silence de la nuit André Gagnon G Ever After Marianas Trench P Noel Nadja G The Truth Is… Theory of a Deadman G C’est un monde Fred Pellerin G A Napoli Marc Hervieux G La vie a deux Jean-Francois Breau & Marie-Eve Janvier G Les grands espaces Isabelle Boulay G La musique en moi Ginette Reno P 26 1 Never Say Never: The Remixes Justin Bieber 33 1 Americana II Roch Voisine 44 3 Take Care Drake 2xP 1 Seul au piano Pierre La Pointe 2 Goodbye Lullaby Avril Lavigne 2 Get Your Heart On Simple Plan 2 The Truth Is… Theory of a Deadman 2 Siberia Lights G 3 Collider Sam Roberts Band 3 Michigan Left Arkells 5 Blonde Coeur de Pirate 5 Que Du Vent Les Cowboys Fringants 5 Je Suis Marie-Elaine Thibert 5 Lights of Endangered Matthew Good 5 Everything’s Going My Way Nadja 5\n\nNew Artists in 2011\n\nThough a song by Toronto’s Neverest barely scraped into the Top 30 on the weekly charts, its long stay, helped by a popular music video, pushed it into the year-end Top 100; “About Us” was 89th of the year. JRDN is Ralph Jordan Croucher who grew up in both Halifax and Toronto. His “Like Magic” was the 80th biggest song of the year. Like The Stereos, Chilliwack, BC’s These Kids Wear Crowns were discovered on MuchMusic’s “disBand” program. Their cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” was 95th of the year.\n\nAnother Chilliwack rock band, Pardon My Striptease, made it to #20 with their song “Pray (For LJ)” about lead singer Andrew Putt’s one-year-old daughter who was in the hospital battling brain cancer. The band challenged Nickelback to match donations to the Children’s Hospital if their song surpassed Nickelback’s “When We Stand Together” on the iTunes chart. Nickelback announced it would honour the challenge and would donate $50,000 to the hospital.\n\nWhat follows are mini-profiles on the biggest newcomers of 2011.\n\nAnjulie\n\nWe have completed a major profile on Anjulie which is HERE.\n\nBrigitte Boisjoli\n\nBeautiful Brigitte is from Drummondville, QC and, in 2009, she finished 3rd in reality television series Star Académie, the same year that Maxime Landry won the singing competition. She led a very athletic life, participating, among other sports, in bungee jumping, parachuting, and kickboxing. As a teen, she participated in musicals. After her success in Star Academy, she released her debut album in 2011, Fruits defendus. Her work was recognized by the Felix awards as she was nominated in several categories. She ended up winning Best New Artist of the Year. Brigitte released a Patsy Cline tribute album in 2015 which went gold.\n\nVictoria Duffield\n\nThis diligent and multi-talented singer from Abbotsford, BC was a finalist on the third season of talent search YTV program The Next Star. By the age of seven, she was singing and dancing in local competitions. She began an acting career appearing in such shows as Cold Squad, Smallville, and Supernatural. After her success in The Next Star, Ryan Stewart (who has worked with Carly Rae Jepsen and Suzie McNeil) co-wrote the song “Shut Up and Dance” with her. It was picked up by radio stations across the country at the end of 2011 and climbed up to #12 on the weekly singles chart going platinum. A version with an added French part featuring Lukay was released in Quebec. Victoria released her debut album in 2012 named after her Platinum single. Tracks “Feel” and “Break My Heart” both made the Top 40 on the Canadian Hot 100. In 2014, Victoria released her second album, Accelerate and went on tour with The Backstreet Boys.\n\nKristina Maria\n\nWe have completed a major profile on Kristina Maria which is HERE.\n\nMia Martina\n\nFrom a small village of 500 people—Saint Ignace, NB—arose one Mia Martina who, after relocating to Ottawa for university, was discovered and asked to sing backup for Danny Fernandes and Belly.

In 2014, Fred released album Plus tard qu’on pense.\n\nNadja\n\nIf you search the net with this, you may find references to a Canadian doom metal band. The Nadja that we are talking about could not be farther away from such pursuits. She is an R&B singer (reminiscent of soul music from the 50s and 60s) from Saint-Félicien, Québec, and already has two gold albums under her belt.

She attracted the attention of famous singer Mario Pelchat who signed her with his label.

She received two JUNO nominations. 604 Records in Vancouver signed her next, and she wrote the song “Call Me Maybe”. At the end of 2011, the song was picked up by mainstream radio and began climbing up the charts. In 2012, it topped the charts and became the best-selling domestic Canadian single in history. Carly was signed by Justin Bieber’s management team. The song was released internationally, topping the charts around the world and became the best-selling song of the year on iTunes.

Jepsen won 3 JUNO awards in 2013 wherein “Call Me Maybe” was named Song of the Year and Kiss Album of the Year. Critically acclaimed album Emotion with gold single “I Really Like You” came out in 2015.\n\nDragonette\n\nThis Toronto synth-pop outfit consists of singer-songwriter Martina Sorbara, drummer Joel Stouffer, and bassist Dan Kurtz. The latter was responsible for producing Feist’s first (independent) album. Feeling that Canada was not the best place to launch their careers, they relocated to electronic-dance friendly Britain to record their debut album in 2007. While there, they backed up New Order, Basement Jaxx, and the Sugarbabes. Dragonette scored its own Top 30 hit in 2009 called “Pick up the Phone”. “Hello”, on which they collaborated with France’s electronic music disc jockey and producer Martin Solveig, finished the year 2011 as the 11th biggest song of the year in Canada and received the highest certification for a digital downloadable single—double platinum. “Hello” stayed on the charts for over 40 weeks. In 2012, their biggest hit was “Let It Go” which peaked at #23 on the weekly chart and was the 73rd biggest song of the year.\n\nRichard Desjardins\n\nRichard has been around a long time. He was born in 1948 in Rouyn, QC. In addition to his music career, he has directed several films and has also scored music for cinematic productions and documentaries. He debuted musically in 1981 in conjunction with the group Abbittibbi. His albums have sold well, 1990’s Tu m’aimes-tu being his first platinum-certified disc. 1998’s Boom Boom went gold. And, in 2011, his L’existoire was a gold album. Desjardins is an environmental activist especially in terms of speaking out against overactive deforestation.\n\nCoeur de Pirate\n\nOne of the Francophone performers to make some inroads into English Canada is Béatrice Martin who operates under the stage name Cœur de Pirate. She has been playing piano since she was 3. Her (self-titled) debut came out in 2009, was certified platinum, and was nominated for Francophone Album of the Year at the JUNOs. As she became a big name in Europe, she won the Félix for Québec artist having the most success outside the province. Her second album, Blonde, was released in 2011, debuting at #5 on the albums chart. Her work was acknowledged by the CBC’s Q radio show who named it as the 12th best album of 2011, a notch ahead of Adele’s 21. It was nominated for Francophone Album of the Year at the 2012 JUNOs. Coeur de Pirate released biliingual album Roses in 2015 and made the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time with single “Carry On”/”Oublie Moi”.\n\nCity and Colour\n\nCity and Colour is not a band but an individual from St. Catharines, ON named Dallas Green, Dallas being a city and Green being a colour. He was previously the lead singer of the band Alexisonfire and now plays a style of melodic indie rock. His released his first album, Sometimes, under his moniker in 2005. Both it and his second album were certified platinum. In 2011, Little Hell, was his third and went platinum in early 2012. He has not yet fared as well in the singles department; however, his song “Waiting” peaked at #32 on the weekly singles chart in early 2008. In 2014 Dallas teamed with American artist Pink in duo You + Me and released a folk album. Album If I Should Go Before You reached #1 in 2015.\n\nGeorge Canyon\n\nGeorge is one of the more popular Canadian country artists. He grew up in Nova Scotia but relocated to High River, Alberta. He held many interesting jobs to support his dream of becoming a professional singer. He worked as a law enforcement officer and a slaughterhouse beef inspector. Ironwolf was his first album, released in 1996. 2004’s One Good Friend, his third, secured his breakthrough, going gold and winning Country Recording of the Year at the JUNOs. His followup release, Somebody Wrote Love, reaped the same award. His second gold album came out in 2011, Better Be Home Soon.\n\nAfter the Vancouver Olympics, which saw Stephan Moccio and Nikki Yanofsky’s “I Believe” top the charts and become the 33rd biggest song of the year in Canada, many Canadian artists began collaborating with others to produce hit singles.\n\nCollaborations\n\nMontreal’s A-Trak joined American Armand Van Helden to form the house duo Duck Sauce. They churned out “Barbara Streisand” which became a number 3 hit in the U.K. Somali-Canadian K’naan teamed up with British band Keane as well as a supergroup of Canadian artists to record a charity single for Haiti. We will get to K’naan in a bit.\n\nJustin Bieber allowed American rapper Ludacris to appear in his song “Baby”, a Top 5 hit in Canada, the U.K., and U.S. His “Eenie Meenie” was recorded with Jamaican-American Sean Kingston. The song made the Top 10 in Britain. Both songs made the Billboard year-end Top 100 chart. Bieber’s solo performance in “Somebody to Love” was a Top 10 hit at home.\n\nDrake only had one Top 10 hit in Canada, “Find Your Love” which was the 32nd biggest song of the year in the U.S. (highest position for a Canadian artist). “Over” was another solo hit for him. “Forever” included contributions from Americans Kanye West, Lil Wayne and Eminem. Drake was featured in two songs from other artists: Lil Wayne’s “Right Above It” and Timbaland’s “Say Something”. All these songs by or featuring Drake make the Billboard Top 100 year-end chart in the U.S. He was also featured in the song “What’s My Name” with Barbados’ Rihanna, a #2 hit in Britain.\n\nCalgary’s twin sisters Tegan & Sara collaborated with Dutch musician Tiesto on the song “Feel It In My Bones” which made the year-end Top 100 in Canada.\n\nBiggest Hits\n\nThe biggest Canadian song of the year was Hedley’s “Perfect” which finished in 18th spot. Two versions of “Wavin’ Flag”, one by the artist himself, K’naan, and a reworked version performed by Young Artists for Haiti came next (#21 and #19 respectively). The latter won the JUNO for song of the year in 2011. At #31, was Michael Buble’s “Haven’t Met You Yet”. Aforementioned Nikki Yanofsky’s “I Believe” was 33rd, and new Toronto band Down with Webster’s “Your Man” was 37th.\n\nFrench-language hits this year included Les Trois Accords’ “Dans mon corps”, Marie-Mai’s “Deja loin”, William Deslauriers’ “Recommencer tout à zéro”, and Dumas’ “Le bonheur”.\n\nThree albums released this year were certified double-platinum: Johnny Reid’s A Place Called Love, Justin Bieber’s My World 2.0, and kd Lang’s Recollection. The album of the year JUNO went to The Arcade Fire’s The Suburbs with Karwa’s Les chemins de verre winning the JUNO for Francophone album of the year.\n\nNewcomers\n\nBesides the above-mentioned Nikki Yanofsky, Down with Webster, K’naan, Tegan & Sara, and Duck Sauce, there were a few additional artists who rose to prominence this year, whether they had been around for a few years already or released a successful debut. Around since 2004, The Arcade Fire, without any hit singles to speak of, rose to prominence in terms of awards, not only in Canada but around the world. Deadmau5, around nearly as long, scored his first platinum album, giving his credibility as a leader of Canadian dance music. Quebec dance duo Alfa Rococo released their second album this year which was very popular. Brand new singer Bobby Bazini scored a platinum debut album. Star Academie winner Maxime Landry did twice as well this year with his first album, released at the end of 2009. The JUNO for best new artist went to Meaghan Smith with Vancouver indie band Said the Whale winning best new group.\n\nK’naan\n\nWhile most African Americans are several-generation U.S. citizens, K’naan was actually born in Africa (Somalia) and immigrated to Canada. He lived through the Somali Civil War in Mogadishu. His father left Somalia for the U.S. and sent his son rap records which he savoured. When he was 13, K’naan, his siblings, and mother left Africa for New York to visit relatives before settling in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rexdale. During his teen years he began to practice rapping himself.\n\nIn 1999, Canadian promoter Sol Guy helped K’naan secure a speaking engagement before the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. He criticized the organization for its failure in aiding Somalia. In the audience was Senegalese singer Youssou N’Dour who was so impressed that he invited him to contribute to his 2001 album Building Bridges.\n\nEventually, Canadian producer Jarvis Church agreed to produce K’naan’s debut album The Dusty Foot Philosopher in 2005 which won a Juno. The man’s breakthrough, however, came this year, not with a rap piece but the pop song “Wavin’ Flag”. It made it to #2 on the charts in Canada and Britain. The song was chosen as theme song for the FIFA World Cup in South Africa and was recorded in many languages.\n\nLater, “Wavin’ Flag” was rerecorded by a supergroup of Canadian artists as a charity single to raise funds for Haiti in the aftermath of its earthquake. Besides K’naan, Young Artists for Haiti included soloists Nelly Furtado, Sam Roberts, Avril Lavigne, Pierre Bouvier (of Simple Plan), Tyler Connolly (of Theory of a Deadman), Kardinal Offishall, Jully Black, LIGHTS, Deryck Whibley (of Sum 41), Serena Ryder, Jacob Hoggard (of Hedley), Emily Haines (of Metric), Hawksley Workman, Drake, Chin Injeti, Ima, Pierre Lapointe, Elisapie Isaac, Esthero, Corb Lund, Fefe Dobson, Nikki Yanofsky, Matt Mays, Justin Nozuka and Justin Bieber.\n\nPerforming the chorus were Arkells, Lamar Ashe, Broken Social Scene, Torquil Campbell, Canadian Tenors, Aion Clarke, City and Colour, Tom Cochrane, Jim Cuddy, Jim Creeggan, Kathleen Edwards, Dave Faber, Jessie Farrell, Colin James, Pat Kordyback, Brandon Lehti, Colin MacDonald, Jay Malinowski, Stacey McKitrick, Suzie McNeil, Stephan Moccio, Kevin Parent, Josh Ramsay, Red 1, Hayley Sales, James Shaw and Shiloh.\n\nThis version of “Wavin’ Flag”, produced by Bob Ezrin, topped the singles chart and won the JUNO for song of the year. The music video can be seen HERE.\n\nK’naan also teamed up with British superstars Keane. Keane released an album in 2004 called Hopes and Fears which was certified 9x Platinum in Britain thanks to Top 5 hits “Everybody’s Changing” and “Somewhere Only We Know”. In 2010, K’naan was featured in a couple of songs for the band’s Night Train EP, including “Stop for a Minute” which became an international hit.\n\nIn 2012, K’Naan teamed up with Nelly Furtado releasing “Is Anybody Out There” which topped the charts in New Zealand and was the 52nd biggest hit of the year in Canada; his “Hurt Me Tomorrow” was 70th.\n\nMaxime Landry\n\nThe best-selling Francophone album in 2010 was from 2009 Star Academie winner Maxime Landry. His album Vox Pop, released in December, 2009, was certified double-platinum. He is from Saint-Gédéon-de-Beauce, Quebec, which is near the border with the U.S. State of Maine. There is not much info on the web about him, but, from what we gather, he was born in 1987 and started out learning the guitar. He participated in a number of music competitions before entering Star Academie.\n\nDeadmau5\n\nThis is not in reality a band but an individual named Joel Thomas Zimmerman, born in 1981 in Niagara Falls. He released his debut album in 2006 and has been leading the way in making Canadian dance/house music from Toronto. The correct pronunciation of his stage name is not “dead mau five” but “dead mouse”. He often performs wearing a “mau5head” costume. He attracts large dance crowds to his performances. His album 4×4=12 was certified platinum. In 2012, four deadmau5 singles made the Canadian Hot 100, the most successful of which was “The Veldt” (#24); it was the 75th biggest hit of the year.

He took a liking to the music of Johnny Cash but developed an interest in soul music after watching a documentary about Otis Redding. Bazini began writing lyrics and then melodies and, encouraged by his grandmother, he began composing music. When he was 18, he performed at a local music festival which caught the attention of a local deejay who was also a drummer. The two began working together and a song was sent to a promoter in Montreal who introduced Bobby to a record label. He was signed very quickly.\n\nBobby’s debut album, Better in Time, was released in 2010 and his song “I Wonder”, which peaked on the Quebec charts at #3, helped the album reach platinum certification in Canada. His sophomore album, 2014’s Where I Belong also struck platinum as well. In 2016, he released Summer Is Gone which spawned cross-Canada radio single “C’est La Vie”.\n\nMeaghan Smith\n\nAfter her songs appeared in the 2009 film 500 Days of Summer, Meaghan’s independent album The Cricket’s Orchestra was picked up by Warner Music and distributed in Canada this year. At the JUNO gala in 2011, she won the award for new artist of the year. Meaghan is from London, Ontario. Album Have a Heart in 2014 combined vintage and modern pop.\n\nNikki Yanofsky\n\nAs the whole world tuned in to watch the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, expecting to see a superstar like Celine Dion perform the national anthem, there was some surprise awaiting them. Celine was pregnant and it was decided that the tone of the games needed to be set by a fresh, youthful face. 16-year-old jazz-pop singer-songwriter Nikki Yanofsky of Montreal shone on stage like a Rudolph leading the country into the hearts of the world. The citizens of her hometown of Montreal were floored. The principal of her high school is reported to have said, “I gasped when I saw her on TV in that red dress and those red shoes – and then I cried, she was so spectacular.”\n\nYanofsky’s song “I Beleive” was a quadruple-platinum single and her album Nikki eventually struck platinum. Album Little Secret in 2014 was produced by American heavyweight Quincy Jones and new music in 2016 by Wyclef Jean.\n\nTegan & Sara\n\nThis indie duo of identical twin sisters who compose, sing, and play both the guitar and piano debuted back in 1999. Their last three albums have gone gold as they have a large underground following. They hit the mainstream this year when they teamed up with Dutch musician Tiesto and released the new wave single “Feel It In My Bones” which made the Top 100 of 2010 chart. In 2012, their popularity skyrocketed as they collaborated with house American DJ Morgan Page in “Body Work”, a Top 40 single, while “Closer” reached #21 on the Canadian Hot 100. They released a new album in 2013, Heartthrob and scored subsequent hit singles. For the album, the duo won 3 JUNO Awards in 2014.\n\nArcade Fire\n\nThe art rock band from Montreal has been around since 2004. This year, they released their third album called The Suburbs. It won the album of the year award at The Canadian JUNOs, American Grammys, and the United Kingdom’s BRIT award for Best International Album. At the end of 2011, the album was certified double-platinum in Canada. The seven-member band plays an assortment of instruments including piano, keyboard, guitar, drums, bass guitar, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, glockenspiel, French horn, accordion, harp, mandolin, and hurdy-gurdy. In 2013 the title track of their album Reflektor became their first Top 40 hit peaking on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 at #20. The group released album Everything Now in 2017.\n\nDown with Webster\n\nLike the Arcade Fire, this is a large band, consisting of several members and hail from Toronto. They perform rap music. Down with Webster signed a record deal in 2009 after a self-released album two years earlier. They released a gold EP which spawned two big hits. “Your Man” and “Whoa Is Me” both made the Top 100 of 2010 and were certified platinum digital downloads.

He became known as an actor first, however, playing the character Jimmy Brooks on the television series Degrassi: The Next Generation. His recording career was launched when he was signed by American rapper Lil Wayne’s company. He released an EP first (in 2009) and his debut (platinum) album, Thank Me Later, was released the following year. Drake often collaborates with other artists in his recorded singles. “Headlines” is his only gold-certified single. “Best I Ever Had” made the year-end Top 100 in 2009; “Find Your Love” and “Over” did in 2010, when he won two JUNO awards, including one for best new artist. In 2011, he recorded hits with Barbados’ Rihanna and Trinidadian-American Nicki Minaj. That year he released his second full-length studio album, Take Care, with contributions by Chantal Kreviazuk, among others. Nothing Was the Same followed in 2013. Drake’s father is African American and his mother is Jewish Canadian. Drake released two albums in 2015, one a collaboration with U.S. artist Future and his own entitled If You’re Reading This, It’s Too Late. With album Views in 2016, track “One Dance” became his first #1 hit.\n\nStereos\n\nEdmonton is not known for churning out popular rock bands. But all that changed with the advent of The Stereos who have a gold album under their belt and have managed three year-end Top 100 singles: “Summer Girl” (#35, 2009), “Throw Ya Hands Up” (#85, 2009), and “Turn It Up” (#80, 2010). The first two were double-platinum digital downloads and the latter platinum. The Stereos are led by Pat Kordyback. They formed in 2008 under the moniker Stand By Me, changed it to Turn It Up, and finally settled on The Stereos. They rose to prominence by performing on MuchMusic show disBAND and were judged by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Universal Music Canada signed them immediately. After their gold debut album in 2009, they released a second album the following year.\n\nLIGHTS\n\nLIGHTS is a female recording artist and synthesizer virtuoso. She was born in Timmins, Ontario but moved around during her childhood, living in Jamaica, The Philippines, and Vancouver, before settling in Toronto in her teens. In 2006, she got a job with Sony/ATV Music Publishing and composed music for television. Her talents led to a record deal with Sire / Warner Music and her song “Drive My Soul” became a Top 20 hit and the 70th biggest song of the year 2008. Before she even released her debut album, she received the JUNO award for best new artist. The Listening came out in 2009 and was certified gold. Her second album, Siberia, came out in 2011 and was certified gold in 2012. A departure from her more poppy-sounding debut, Siberia showcased a more creative electronic rock sound and drew critical acclaim.
