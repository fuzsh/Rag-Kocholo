        "text": "TORONTO - Canadian dance producer Deadmau5 says he's resolved his conflict with Toronto play \"Deadmouse: The Musical\" after he issued a cease-and-desist notice.\n\nThe production was set to run from July 1-12 during the Toronto Fringe Festival, until Deadmau5 issued a notice alleging intellectual property violations.\n\nThe six-time Grammy nominee, whose real name is Joel Zimmerman, posted the notice on Twitter, then over the ensuing hours argued with fans sympathetic to the light-hearted production.\n\nFinally he posted that the situation was resolved, because the musical had added a disclaimer noting that it was a parody.\n\nThe website for \"Deadmouse: The Musical\" also now includes a note stating that it was neither written nor endorsed by Deadmau5, but instead made \"out of love of house music culture.\"\n\nAccording to the website, the musical is \"Ratatouille\" meets \"Book of Mormon\" and follows the story of a mouse who \"wants to be a house DJ but is discriminated against for being a mouse.\""
