        "text": "Deadmau5 AKA Joel Thomas Zimmerman is an Electronic DJ and music producer. Zimmerman produces a variety of styles within the progressive house genre and sometimes other forms of electronic music. Known for his signature mouse mask, the DJ is known for his electric live performances and continued innovation of the genre.\n\nZimmerman has received six Grammy Award nominations for his work. He has worked with other DJs and producers, such as Kaskade, MC Flipside, Rob Swire and Wolfgang Gartner. On a number of releases, he has partnered with Melleefresh. Zimmerman is also very well known to have occasional and sometimes hilarious Twitter rampages, some of which landed him in hot water. Deadmau5 was in his time, one of the highest paid electronic music producers in the world and is the founder and owner of Mau5trap, Zimmerman's own music label. Heâ€™s even a playable character in DJ Hero 2, a game released in 2010. Truly the Mau5 is an iconic figure in the electronic music scene.\n\nAfter an on again off again stint, Zimmerman became engaged to famed tattoo artist and television personality Kat Von D in December 2012, but unfortunately the couple called it quits in 2013. Though Zimmerman has since found love, marrying Kelly Feldoni, he has yet to have children.\n\nThe Canadian-born musician purchased this property for $5 million. Complete with 4 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms and 118 acres of land. Other features include a home theater and Deadmau5's home studio. Other amenities include a gourmet chef kitchen, 6 fireplaces and a professionally landscaped salt water pool.\n\nAs one of the highest paid entertainers Zimmerman has earned a net worth of $53 Million over his 20 year career. Having taken an indefinite leave of absence in 2018, citing mental health and personal issues, the world renown musician as certainly earned a break.\n\n43,909 views"
