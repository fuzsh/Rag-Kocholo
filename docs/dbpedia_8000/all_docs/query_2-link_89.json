        "text": "Ever since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11, a wave of cancellations and closures have rocked the Canadian arts and entertainment world. Now, as the crisis shows no sign of weakening, and with public gatherings being discouraged if not banned outright, cultural institutions have begun laying off staff.\n\nAfter cancelling all upcoming public events on its campus, on March 19 the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity in Alberta announced it would move into an “essential services” footing for the next few months and temporarily lay off some of its staff. “With little public activity now on campus,” a statement posted online read, “we have made the very difficult decision to move to a temporary layoff of some staff to help Banff Centre weather the economic and health crisis that is engulfing the world.”\n\nThe Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra has temporarily laid off its entire orchestra, after initially suspending performances until March 31. On March 18, layoff notices were issued to all 67 orchestra members as well as 30 members of the WSO’s administrative staff. The layoff is effective March 29. At Centennial Concert Hall, where the WSO performs, all events and rehearsals are cancelled or postponed until April 15.\n\n​The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry has cancelled its June 8 readings by the prize’s yet-to-be-announced shortlisted writers, along with the awards dinner on June 9 in Toronto. The Griffin shortlist will be made public on April 7; the winners, on May 19.\n\nThe Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame has postponed the 2020 induction celebration of Kim Mitchell and Pye Dubois to September, as part of the new dates for the postponed Canadian Music Week. As well, the posthumous honouring of inductee Ron Hynes that was to happen at the now-cancelled East Coast Music Awards in St. John’s has been put off for now.\n\nIn more positive news, Luminato Festival Toronto is still scheduled for June 11 to 28. The downtown performing arts event originally came about as a way to draw tourists back to post-SARS Toronto. According to a statement on the festival’s website, the 2020 programming will be revealed “as soon as we believe we can see the likely effect of COVID-19 on our plans.”\n\nMuseums forced to close doors at busiest time of year\n\nOpinion: Artists will need our help after this coronavirus nightmare\n\nScuttled arts and cultural happenings are worldwide in scope. France’s prestigious Cannes Film Festival, cinema’s biggest and most famous annual gathering, has postponed the mid-May event. Organizers of the annual A-list affair on the French Riviera said they are considering moving the festival to the end of June or the beginning of July. \"As soon as the development of the French and international health situation will allow us to assess the real possibility, we will make our decision known,” the festival said in a statement.\n\nOn March 18, organizers of the iconic British music festival Glastonbury announced news of an “enforced fallow year\" for the annual summer event held in the county of Somerset. The festival was planned for June 24-28, with headliners including Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, Kendrick Lamar, Diana Ross, Lana Del Rey and Pet Shop Boys. Canadian performers included Caribou and Rufus Wainwright.\n\nBack in Canada, on March 18, Toronto-based Canadian Stage announced the cancellation of a number of upcoming productions, even the popular summer-long Shakespeare in High Park event.\n\nThe National Arts Centre in Ottawa has cancelled all it performances and events until April 5, a move that nixes everything from Toddler Tuesdays to a touring production of Cats.\n\nToronto’s Harbourfront Centre, an arts and cultural complex of 30 venues, is shut down.\n\nIn Quebec, all large indoor gatherings are banned, causing the Place des Arts, home to the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, to suspend its shows until further notice.\n\nThis year’s Lionel Gelber Prize Ceremony and Lecture, set for March 30 at Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, has been postponed until fall owing to travel restrictions related to the pandemic. The winners of the $15,000 literary prize for the world’s best non-fiction book in English on foreign affairs are Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes for The Light that Failed: A Reckoning.\n\nFollowing the British Columbia government’s directive to temporarily cancel gatherings of 250 people or more, all major events at Vancouver’s B.C. Place have been put on hold “until further notice.” On March 17, the Rolling Stones postponed its summer No Filter tour that included a stop at the stadium venue. Instead of offering refunds, tour promoters AEG Presents and Concerts West advised fans to \"hold onto their tickets and await further information.”\n\nAlberta has shut down large gatherings as part of its “aggressive” COVID-19 strategy. Edmonton Opera’s performances of Candide are no more. Calgary’s Studio Bell, home of the National Music Centre, is closed to the public until further notice.\n\nAnd on it goes, with institutions closing and events falling like dominoes. Mind you, The World Championship Domino Tournament, for more than four decades held in Andalusia, Alabama, is set to go ahead as planned on July 10 and 11.\n\nHere’s a look at what else has been happening in the arts world.\n\nPop music\n\nDays after announcing all Juno Week activities would go ahead as planned in Saskatoon, the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences cancelled all Juno events, including the televised ceremony night at SaskTel Centre. The stunning declaration came as no surprise to a music industry already rocked by the cancellation last week of the annual South by Southwest music festival and conference in Austin, Texas.\n\nPearl Jam suspended its Gigaton tour, set to kick off March 18 at Toronto’s Scotiabank Arena. Upcoming spring shows by the Seattle grunge-rock icons in Ottawa, Quebec City and Hamilton have also been postponed.\n\nThere will be more of that kind of bad news to come. On March 12, North American mega-promoters Live Nation and AEG issued a joint statement: “At this time, we collectively recommend large scale events through the end of March be postponed.\"\n\nFollowing that announcement, Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour was suspended from March 26 through May 2, 2020. Canadian dates affected: Toronto (March 28-29) and Montreal (April 2-3). The health of the Rocket Man icon himself would seem to be at risk, given that he recently postponed two shows in New Zealand due to a bout with pneumonia.\n\nThe remaining concerts on Celine Dion’s Courage World Tour have been postponed, shutting down April arena shows in Vancouver, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Winnipeg.\n\nOn March 16, Canadian Music Week, a major annual music industry event of conferences, award presentations, public speakers and artist showcases in Toronto, was postponed to September, from May 19 to 23. The Canadian Folk Music Awards, in partnership with Music PEI, announced the cancellation of its events, scheduled for April 3 and 4 in Charlottetown. The East Coast Music Awards, set to run April 29 to May 3 in St. John’s, won’t happen this year. Actor-comedian Mary Walsh was to host the April 30 awards show at Mile One Centre.\n\nB.C. rocker Matthew Good postponed Ontario shows in London, Kitchener, Ottawa and Hamilton. Eight-time Juno winners Good Brothers, not related to Matthew, have shifted a dozen spring shows in Ontario (including Royal Canadian Legions in Elora and Port Elgin) to October. A pair of Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons concerts at Ontario’s Casino Rama scheduled for March 21 and 22 have been postponed.\n\nToronto’s leading folk music venue, Hugh’s Room Live, had previously said it was searching for a new venue, with its lease set to expire on March 31. On Monday, the supper club announced it would postpone all its programming “until the COVID-19 pandemic wanes.” Shows affected include a March 28 appearance by the Sometimes When We Touch singer Dan Hill.\n\nThe Jazz Bistro in Toronto has closed its doors indefinitely.\n\nCaesars Windsor has closed temporarily, shutting down upcoming concerts by Ice Cube, Pitbull, REO Speedwagon and Jason Derulo. Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara temporarily closed all casino and resort operations as a “precautionary measure.”\n\nVancouver-based singer-songwriter Dan Mangan postponed all dates in March and April of his 10th anniversary tour of his debut album, Nice, Nice, Very Nice. On March 13, he played a short set of songs at an empty Danforth Music Hall in Toronto and taped the performance for a YouTube stream.\n\nThe Alberta balladeer Jann Arden did something similar on Monday, with an informal mini-concert – “I showered,” she told her online audience – on Facebook. Arden’s upcoming national tour is still set to happen, beginning May 7 at Mile One Centre in St. John’s.\n\nCanadian musicians have been affected by postponements elsewhere. Carly Rae Jepsen, Jessie Reyez, Dan Snaith, Deadmau5 and Grammy winner Daniel Caesar were all booked to perform at the two-weekend Coachella festival in the California desert, now postponed from April to October. Toronto-based indie-pop darlings Alvvays were set to play a profile-raising concert this past weekend with the Strokes in Los Angeles. The show was postponed.\n\nAvril Lavigne cancelled the Asian and European legs of her Head Above Water Tour. American promoter Beaver Productions postponed 15 arena shows scheduled for the remainder of March and into April in the United States by the Canadian crooner Michael Bublé.\n\nThe SOCAN Awards, an annual event that celebrates achievements in songwriting, composing and music publishing, will no longer take place on March 30 in Toronto.\n\nToronto-based outfit Classic Albums Live, which offers live note-for-note performances of iconic rock LPs, postponed 20 upcoming concerts, including a presentation of Tom Petty’s Damn the Torpedoes at Toronto’s Roy Thomson Hall on March 28.\n\nBut, in what should be seen as a surprising development given his shaky health, 81-year-old troubadour Gordon Lightfoot plans to make good on his upcoming April concert commitments in Ottawa, Montreal and his hometown of Orillia, Ont. The Carefree Highway singer suffers from a chronic inflammation of the sinuses and recently returned to the road after a layoff caused by a leg injury.\n\nClassical music\n\nLast week, in response to social-distancing mandates in the state of Washington, the Seattle Symphony announced it would rebroadcast earlier performances of fan-favourite symphonies and livestream new performances through March. The initiative is welcome news to classical music audiences, battered by countless cancellations caused by COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nThe Toronto Symphony Orchestra called off its three Pictures at an Exhibition concerts with Armenian-American pianist Sergei Babayan. With the abandonment of its Evening Epic fundraiser event at the Carlu on March 26, the TSO will be hit where it hurts.
