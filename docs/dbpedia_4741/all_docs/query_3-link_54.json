        "text": "Plot\n\nKancherla Gopanna's uncles, Akkanna and Madanna are ministers in Golconda ruled by Tanisha. Ramadasu marries Akkanna's daughter Kamala. In Bhadrachalam, Gopanna meets Kabir, a Rama devotee who renames him Ramadasu. Impressed by his selfless service, Tanisha appoints Ramadasu as the Tehsildar, the tax collector of Bhadrachalam. Ramadasu spends the tax money to build a temple for Rama. The letter he sends explaining this does not reach the Tanisha, due to a plot hatched by the Dharmakarta. A furious Tanish has Ramadasu imprisoned, but on the day of his hanging, Lord Rama and Lakshmana appear in disguise before Tanisha, and pay him the amount due from Ramadasu. Tanisha realizes his folly and rushes to save Ramadasu from the gallows."
