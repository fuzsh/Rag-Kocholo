        "text": "India has a long history of religious activists using laws, some dating back to the 1860s, to block publications and works of art that they find objectionable. On the other side of the fence, writers, academics and artists perceive this movement as a threat to freedom of speech and artistic expression, which the Law, politicians, the publishing industry, universities and civil society seem unable or unwilling to defend. This article explores the latest wave of citizen-censorship in India, described by one writer as India’s ‘Ice Age for scholarship’. It looks at the main players, places these events in context, describes some of the drivers and looks gloomily at the future of free speech in India."
