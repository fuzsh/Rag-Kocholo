        "text": "Plot\n\nPalnadu's Chief Minister Brahmanaidu (N. T. Rama Rao) and his wife Ithamba (Anjali Devi) are blessed with a baby boy after many years. They name the child Balachandra and on the naming ceremony the entire capital city Gurajala was filled with joy. King Nalagamaraju (Gummadi) himself visited along with his brother Narasimharaju (Rajanala) and their stepmother Vidhyala Devi (Hemalatha). But unfortunately, according to the child's horoscope, the astrologers predict that he would create a huge destruction of war in Palnadu. So, Brahmanaidu orders his henchmen to kill the child, but the child was protected by Brahmanaidu's brother-in-law Kannamma Naidu (Mikkilineni), who secretly raised him up.\n\nAt the same time, Palnadu saw flash floods. Progressive-minded Brahmanaidu allows Scheduled Caste people Harijans entry into temples and appoints a Harijan, Kannama Dasu (Prabhakar Reddy) as his commander & chief. This irks the upper caste people's head Gopamantri (K. V. S. Sarma), so he decides to take revenge against Brahmanaidu, for which he uses a powerful woman, Nayakuralu Nagamma (Bhanumathi Ramakrishna). Nagamma has an edict that she can rule the kingdom for 3 days, which was given by king Anuguraju. Using the edict, Nagamma creates a lot of destruction within the kingdom and also corrupts King Nalagamaraju's mind, due to which Brahmanaidu has to leave his position.\n\nOn hearing this, Raja Maata Vidyaladevi also decides to leave the kingdom, she asks Nalagamaraju to divide the kingdom and give the share to his son Malidevadulu (M. Balaiah). So, Macharla has been given to Malideva. Malideva & Vidhyala Devi along with her brother Kommaraju (Mukkamala) leave to Macharla. Years roll by, under Brahmanaidu's guidance, Macharla develops as another progressive capital which hurts Nagamma. Here she plans to grab the Macharla kingdom by creating a conspiracy. She performs Nalagamaraju's daughter Peerindevi's (Vasanthi) marriage with Kommaraju's son Alaraju (Kanta Rao). Next day after the marriage ceremony, Nagamma incites Malideva for a rooster fight (Kodi Pandalu) on the condition that whoever loses the gamble must leave the kingdom and live incognito for seven years. Nagamma cheats to win and Malideva has to leave his kingdom."
