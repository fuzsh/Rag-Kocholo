        "text": "Pawan Kalyan’s estranged wife, Renu Desai got married once again recently and is also trying to make a career for herself. The former actress is busy on Television and recently also signed for a film. Even though she is leading an independent life, she is still struggling to come out of the shadow of Pawan Kalyan.\n\nRenu Desai signed a social program titled ‘Matti Manushulu’ in which Renu Desai plays the host and she will be visiting the families of poor farmers and will know their problems. The aim of this program is to bring to the notice of the people and the governments about the problems of the farmers.\n\nAlso Read – Double Ismart Ticket Hikes: A Bold Move?\n\nBut then, this program is being telecast on Sakshi TV and that did not go well with Pawan Kalyan fans. They are accusing her of joining hands with Pawan Kalyan’s Political Rivals and are worried that she will be used as a pawn to target Pawan Kalyan personally and Politically going further. Pawan Kalyan fans are hurling choicest abuses on Renu.\n\nHowever, this seems to be totally unfair because Renu Desai is now divorced and is leading an independent life. She need not take decisions with a concern for Pawan Kalyan’s Life or Profession. Pawan Kalyan fans are blinded by the love on their matinee idol and can not see the reality that she is no longer connect to the Janasenani in anyways."
