        "text": "Vaikuntam was born in Boorugupally, Karimnagar, Andhra Pradesh. His father used to run a grocery shop.\n\nHe studied at the College of Fine Arts and Architecture at Hyderabad and Painting and Printmaking, Faculty of Fine Arts, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (On a Lalit Kala Academy Fellowship from Andhra Pradesh). He was under the tutelage of K. G. Subramanian at Baroda.\n\nThe love for women in his paintings can be traced back to his childhood fascination by the impersonations of women characters by the male artists of the theatre groups performing in his village.\n\nCareerVaikuntam paints colorful and elaborately dressed Telangana region men and seductive women. His muse is the sensuous and voluptuous women of Telengana with their omnipresent vermilion bindis, draped in colourful sarees that highlight their dusky skin.\n\nThe stylisation of a painting are a perfect foil to Indian classical dance as the figures seem to dance, as if following their creator in a statuesque movement, reminiscent of temple friezes. He uses the brightest of reds and yellows. The simple women become larger than life as they fill the small format of his paintings draped in bright Sircilla saris.\n\n“ I like using rich primary colours, which give a sense of character and depth to my paintings. Like reds and saffron and even orange, because these are essentially Indian colours. I don’t like using colours that are mix of two, because they are not natural, they don’t exist in surroundings around us, in our everyday life. – T. Vaikuntam ”\n\nHe also worked as art director for the film, Daasi, which received a national award. He also worked on Maa Bhoomi, Matti Manushulu and film was made based on story as Rangula Kala, which displayed the range of his work as young upcoming painter.\n\nWikipedia\n\nIn 1906, Marc traveled with his elder brother Paul, a Byzantine expert, to Saloniki, Mount Athos, and various other Greek locations. A few years later in 1910, Marc developed an important friendship with the artist August Macke.\n\nIn 1911 Marc founded the Der Blaue Reiter journal, which became the center of an artist circle with Macke, Wassily Kandinsky, and others who decided to split off from the Neue Künstlervereinigung (New artist’s association) movement.\n\nMarc showed several of his works in the first Der Blaue Reiter exhibition at the Thannhauser Galleries in Munich between December 1911 and January 1912. The apex of the German expressionist movement, the exhibit also showed in Berlin, Köln, Hagen, and Frankfurt. In 1912, Marc met Robert Delaunay, whose use of color and futurist method was a major influence on Marc’s work. Fascinated by futurism and cubism, Marc created art increasingly stark and abstract in nature.\n\nAfter mobilization of the German Army during World War I, the government identified notable artists to be withdrawn from combat to protect them. Marc was on the list, but before orders for reassignment could reach him, he was struck in the head and killed instantly in 1916 by a shell splinter during the Battle of Verdun.\n\nWikipedia\n\nKarel Appel studied at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam during the German Occupation from 1940 to 1943 and met there the young painter Corneille and, some years later, Constant; they became close friends for years. His parents opposed his choice to become an artist, leading him to leave home; this was also necessary because he needed to hide from the German police so that he would not be picked up and sent to Germany to work in the weapon industry. Appel had his first show in Groningen in 1946. In 1949 he participated with the other Cobra artists in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; this generated a huge scandal and many objections in the press and public. He was influenced by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and the French brute-art artist Jean Dubuffet. In 1947 he started sculpting with all kinds of used materials (in the technique of assemblage) and painted them in bright colors: white, red, yellow, blue and black. He joined the Experimentele Groep in Holland together with the young Dutch painters Anton Rooskens, Theo Wolvecamp and Jan Nieuwenhuys. Later the Belgian writer Hugo Claus joined the group.\n\nWikipedia\n\nKim MacConnel (born in 1946 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) is an American artist who works with painting, sculpture, and mixed media-collage/fabric. MacConnel is a seminal figure in the Pattern and Decoration movement of the seventies, but overall MacConnel’s oeuvre has surpassed being categorized.[1] MacConnel received his BA, with honors, from the University of California, San Diego in 1969 and his MFA, also with honors, in 1972.\n\nMacConnel had a lot of trouble starting out as an artist due to the fact that he had to come up against the minimalism of the time in the 1970s. During the Minimalist movement, artists weren’t interested in color or even painting for the most part; MacConnel’s art just wasn’t accepted as serious. It also had partly to do with his material, instead of painting on stretched canvas, MacConnel instead painted on fabric and bed sheets, which he would tear apart and sew back together again. It wasn’t until MacConnel was in an exhibition in Germany that his art became recognized.\n\nIt wasn’t really until a German collector who wrote a news letter for German collectors saw the work in a show that I was in Germany and was over come by it. He thought it was really brilliant for some reason. And that’s when a contingent of Europeans really started looking at what we were trying to do. Particularly in my case, what I was trying to do. And found that it resonated in that area for them as a new avenue into the future, really, of what art making might be. So it was revolutionary in some ways in terms of, like, the status quo.\n\nWikipedia\n\nTobey was the youngest of four children born to George Tobey, a carpenter and house builder, and Emma Cleveland Tobey—his mother was over 40 when Tobey was born. The Tobeys were devout Congregationalists. Tobey’s father carved animals of red stone and sometimes drew animals for the young Tobey to cut out with scissors. In 1893, his family settled in Chicago.[2] As a youth, Tobey studied art for a brief period at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1906 to 1908, but like the others of the Northwest School, Tobey was mostly self-taught.\n\nIn 1911, he moved to New York where he worked as a fashion illustrator for McCall’s magazine and made some money as a portraitist. His first one-man show was held at Knoedler & Company, in lower Manhattan, New York City, in 1917.\n\nIn 1918, Tobey came in contact with New York portrait artist and Bahá’í Juliet Thompson (also an associate of Khalil Gibran) and posed for her. During the session Tobey read some Bahá’í literature and accepted an invitation to Green Acre where he converted.[3] In the following years, Tobey delved into works of Arabian literature and teachings of East Asian philosophy and with his conversion led him to explore the representation of the spiritual in art.\n\nWikipedia\n\nPaul Jackson Pollock (January 28, 1912 – August 11, 1956), known as Jackson Pollock, was an influential American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement. During his lifetime, Pollock enjoyed considerable fame and notoriety. He was regarded as a mostly reclusive artist. He had a volatile personality, and struggled with alcoholism for most of his life. In 1945, he married the artist Lee Krasner, who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy.[4]\n\nPollock died at the age of 44 in an alcohol-related car accident. In December 1956, the year of his death, he was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, and a larger more comprehensive exhibition there in 1967. More recently, in 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.\n\nWikipedia\n\nRenata Bernal was born in Munich, Germany in 1937, and moved to New York city with her mother at the age of 13.\n\nShe attended the Cooper Union in New York City, graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the San Francisco Art Institute, and earned a Masters in Art Education from Brown University. She has exhibited in New York City, San Francisco, Providence (RI), and in numerous cities in upstate New York. She has also taught art to both adults and children through the Robertson Museum in New York.\n\nWhile a student at the San Francisco Art Institute, Renata studied lithography and etching with Nathan Oliveira. As a student, she also worked with ink drawing and woodcuts. Throughout the 1950’s and 1960’s, she worked with oil paints and was drawn to their luminosity and color.\n\nIn the late 1960’s Bernal began working with acrylic airbrush (“air gun”) on canvas. The air brush allowed her to produce, with acrylic paint, the same feeling of luminosity that she had grown to love about oil paintings. Over the following decades this was the primary medium that she used for her large abstract pieces, although she continued to work in other media and styles: pastel and charcoal portraits in the 1970’s and 1980’s, and ink drawings in the 1990’s.\n\nBernal’s geometric shapes and linear patterns suggest organic or cosmic themes. Whether in primary colors, pastel shades, or monochromatic tones, her works show a bold and finely-tuned sense of color, line and form. Many of her paintings have been exhibited only in a few select locations because of their monumental scale.\n\nRenata is currently retired in upstate New York, where she continues to enjoy practicing her artwork, writing poetry, and participating in her local Unitarian Universalist congregation.\n\nRenata Bernal.com\n\nGeorge Byron Browne was born in 1907 in Yonkers, New York. He later dropped the name “George,” although his name occasionally appears as George-Byron Browne or George B. Browne. He attended the National Academy of Design in New York City from 1924 to 1928. In 1927, he began experimenting with abstract art and eventually destroyed all of his previous representational works. Most noted was the prize winning still-life canvas that he destroyed after the piece won the Hallgarten Prize as a protest to antiquated academia, which disallowed for the “modern movement.”\n\nThroughout his life, Browne was a champion for abstract art. In the 1930’s, Browne worked for the WPA’s mural division, completing some of the first abstract murals in the country for Studio D at radio station WNYC, the U.S. Passport office in Rockefeller Center, the Chronic Disease Hospital, the Williamsburg Housing Project, and the 1939 World’s Fair. In the 1940’s, he picketed the Museum of Modern art in New York protesting their lack of acknowledgment of American Abstract artists. Browne married Rosalind Benglesdorf in 1940, a painter and writer, who also spoke out in defense of abstract art and was a member of the American Abstract Artists along with her husband.\n\nByron Browne was a leader of the American Avante Garde art movement in the 1930’s and 40’s along with Bolotowsky, Greene, Gorky, and de Kooning. These artists helped pave the way for America, New York in particular, to be seen as a center for art innovation after decades of France being the art center of the world.\n\nHe was given over 60 solo exhibitions from 1933 to 1970. Byron Browne was an instructor of painting at the Arts Student League from 1948 to 1959 and taught Advanced Painting at New York University from 1959 until his untimely death in 1961. The Arts Student League later designated a scholarship in his name.\n\nSullivangoss\n\nKline’s best known abstract expressionist paintings are in black and white. Kline re-introduced color into his paintings around 1955, though he used color more consistently after 1959. Kline’s paintings are deceptively subtle. While generally his paintings have a dynamic, spontaneous and dramatic impact, Kline often closely referred to his compositional drawings. Kline carefully rendered many of his most complex pictures from studies. There seem to be references to Japanese calligraphy in Kline’s black and white paintings, although he always denied that connection. Bridges, tunnels, buildings, engines, railroads and other architectural and industrial icons are often suggested as imagery informing Kline’s work.\n\nKline’s most recognizable method/style derives from a suggestion made to him by his friend Willem De Kooning. In 1948, de Kooning suggested to an artistically frustrated Kline to bring in a sketch and project it with a Bell Opticon opaque projector he had at his studio.\n\nKlee has been variously associated with Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism, and Abstraction, but his pictures are difficult to classify. He generally worked in isolation from his peers, and interpreted new art trends in his own way. He was inventive in his methods and technique. Klee worked in many different media—oil paint, watercolor, ink, pastel, etching, and others. He often combined them into one work. He used canvas, burlap, muslin, linen, gauze, cardboard, metal foils, fabric, wallpaper, and newsprint.[54] Klee employed spray paint, knife application, stamping, glazing, and impasto, and mixed media such as oil with watercolor, water color with pen and India ink, and oil with tempera.[55]\n\nHe was a natural draftsman, and through long experimentation developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses a great variety of color palettes from nearly monochromatic to highly polychromatic. His works often have a fragile child-like quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms as well as letters, numbers, and arrows, and combined them with figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or musical notation. The later works are distinguished by spidery hieroglyph-like symbols. Rainer Maria Rilke wrote about Klee in 1921, “Even if you hadn’t told me he plays the violin, I would have guessed that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music.”[12]\n\nPamela Kort observed: “Klee’s 1933 drawings present their beholder with an unparalleled opportunity to glimpse a central aspect of his aesthetics that has remained largely unappreciated: his lifelong concern with the possibilities of parody and wit. Herein lies their real significance, particularly for an audience unaware that Klee’s art has political dimensions.”\n\nWikipedia\n\nHofmann was born in Weißenburg, Bavaria on March 21, 1880 the son of Theodor and Franziska Hofmann. At age six he moved to Munich. It was here that his father took up a job with the government. Starting at a young age, he gravitated towards science and mathematics. At age sixteen, he started work with the Bavarian government as assistant to the director of Public Works. Through this, Hofmann was further able to develop his knowledge of mathematics. He went on to develop and patent devices such as the electromagnetic comptometer, a radar device for ships at sea, a sensitized light bulb, and a portable freezer unit for military use. Even with such great abilities in science and mathematics, Hofmann started to take great interest in creative studies, starting educational art training after the death of his father.[1] In 1932 he immigrated to the United States, where he resided until the end of his life.\n\nWikipedia\n\nDonald Sultan (born 1951 in Asheville, North Carolina) is an American artist, known for large-scale still life paintings executed with bold contrasts of bright color and deep black forms, tight, nearly abstract compositions, and unorthodox media.\n\nAfter earning his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Masters from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Sultan moved to New York City in 1975 to pursue his career.\n\nHis first solo exhibition was mounted in 1977, and Sultan has since risen to prominence, with his work featured in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nIn addition to his paintings, Sultan has had success as a printmaker and sculptor. He collaborated with David Mamet on his book, Bar Mitzvah."
