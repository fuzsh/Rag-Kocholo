        "text": "The Cinema of India, consisting of motion pictures made by the Indian film industry, has had a large effect on world cinema since the second half of the 20th century.[8][9] Indian cinema is made up of various film industries, each producing films in different languages, including Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Punjabi, Bhojpuri and others.\n\nMajor centres of film production across the country include Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Kochi, Bangalore, Bhubaneswar-Cuttack, and Guwahati.[details 1] For a number of years, the Indian film industry has ranked first in the world in terms of annual film output.[29] In 2022, Indian cinema earned â‚¹15,000 crore ($1.9 billion) at the box-office.[6] Ramoji Film City located in Hyderabad is certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest film studio complex in the world measuring over 1,666 acres (674 ha).[30]\n\nIndian cinema is composed of multilingual and multi-ethnic film art. The term 'Bollywood', often mistakenly used to refer to Indian cinema as a whole, is only the Hindi-language segment, with Indian cinema being an umbrella term that includes various film industries, each offering films in diverse languages and styles.\n\nIn 2021, Telugu cinema emerged as the largest film industry in India in terms of box office.[31][32] In 2022, Hindi cinema represented 33% of box office revenue, followed by Telugu representing 20%, Tamil representing 16%, Kannada representing 8%, and Malayalam representing 6%.[33][34] Other prominent film industries are Marathi, Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, Bhojpuri, and Odia cinema.[33][34] As of 2022, the combined revenue of South Indian film industries has surpassed that of the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry (Bollywood).[35][36] As of 2022, Telugu cinema leads Indian cinema with 23.3 crore (233 million) tickets sold, followed by Tamil cinema with 20.5 crore (205 million) and Hindi cinema with 18.9 crore (189 million).[37][33]"
