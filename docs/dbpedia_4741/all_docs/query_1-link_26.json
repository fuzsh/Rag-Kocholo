        "text": "Vaikuntam was born in Boorugupally, Karimnagar, Andhra Pradesh. His father used to run a grocery shop.\n\nHe studied at the College of Fine Arts and Architecture at Hyderabad and Painting and Printmaking, Faculty of Fine Arts, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (On a Lalit Kala Academy Fellowship from Andhra Pradesh). He was under the tutelage of K. G. Subramanian at Baroda.\n\nThe love for women in his paintings can be traced back to his childhood fascination by the impersonations of women characters by the male artists of the theatre groups performing in his village.\n\nCareerVaikuntam paints colorful and elaborately dressed Telangana region men and seductive women. His muse is the sensuous and voluptuous women of Telengana with their omnipresent vermilion bindis, draped in colourful sarees that highlight their dusky skin.\n\nThe stylisation of a painting are a perfect foil to Indian classical dance as the figures seem to dance, as if following their creator in a statuesque movement, reminiscent of temple friezes. He uses the brightest of reds and yellows. The simple women become larger than life as they fill the small format of his paintings draped in bright Sircilla saris.\n\n“ I like using rich primary colours, which give a sense of character and depth to my paintings. Like reds and saffron and even orange, because these are essentially Indian colours. I don’t like using colours that are mix of two, because they are not natural, they don’t exist in surroundings around us, in our everyday life. – T. Vaikuntam ”\n\nHe also worked as art director for the film, Daasi, which received a national award. He also worked on Maa Bhoomi, Matti Manushulu and film was made based on story as Rangula Kala, which displayed the range of his work as young upcoming painter.\n\nWikipedia\n\nKim MacConnel (born in 1946 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) is an American artist who works with painting, sculpture, and mixed media-collage/fabric. MacConnel is a seminal figure in the Pattern and Decoration movement of the seventies, but overall MacConnel’s oeuvre has surpassed being categorized.[1] MacConnel received his BA, with honors, from the University of California, San Diego in 1969 and his MFA, also with honors, in 1972.\n\nMacConnel had a lot of trouble starting out as an artist due to the fact that he had to come up against the minimalism of the time in the 1970s. During the Minimalist movement, artists weren’t interested in color or even painting for the most part; MacConnel’s art just wasn’t accepted as serious. It also had partly to do with his material, instead of painting on stretched canvas, MacConnel instead painted on fabric and bed sheets, which he would tear apart and sew back together again. It wasn’t until MacConnel was in an exhibition in Germany that his art became recognized.\n\nIt wasn’t really until a German collector who wrote a news letter for German collectors saw the work in a show that I was in Germany and was over come by it. He thought it was really brilliant for some reason. And that’s when a contingent of Europeans really started looking at what we were trying to do. Particularly in my case, what I was trying to do. And found that it resonated in that area for them as a new avenue into the future, really, of what art making might be. So it was revolutionary in some ways in terms of, like, the status quo.\n\nWikipedia\n\nKline’s best known abstract expressionist paintings are in black and white. Kline re-introduced color into his paintings around 1955, though he used color more consistently after 1959. Kline’s paintings are deceptively subtle. While generally his paintings have a dynamic, spontaneous and dramatic impact, Kline often closely referred to his compositional drawings. Kline carefully rendered many of his most complex pictures from studies. There seem to be references to Japanese calligraphy in Kline’s black and white paintings, although he always denied that connection. Bridges, tunnels, buildings, engines, railroads and other architectural and industrial icons are often suggested as imagery informing Kline’s work.\n\nKline’s most recognizable method/style derives from a suggestion made to him by his friend Willem De Kooning. In 1948, de Kooning suggested to an artistically frustrated Kline to bring in a sketch and project it with a Bell Opticon opaque projector he had at his studio.\n\nFrank Shepard Fairey (born February 15, 1970) is an American contemporary artist, graphic designer, and illustrator who emerged from the skateboarding[1] scene. He first became known for his “André the Giant Has a Posse” (…OBEY…) sticker campaign, in which he appropriated images from the comedic supermarket tabloid Weekly World News. His work became more widely known in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, specifically his Barack Obama “Hope” poster. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston calls him one of today’s best known and most influential street artists.[2] His work is included in the collections at The Smithsonian, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.[3][4]\n\nWikipedia\n\nDonald Sultan (born 1951 in Asheville, North Carolina) is an American artist, known for large-scale still life paintings executed with bold contrasts of bright color and deep black forms, tight, nearly abstract compositions, and unorthodox media.\n\nAfter earning his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Masters from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Sultan moved to New York City in 1975 to pursue his career.\n\nHis first solo exhibition was mounted in 1977, and Sultan has since risen to prominence, with his work featured in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nIn addition to his paintings, Sultan has had success as a printmaker and sculptor. He collaborated with David Mamet on his book, Bar Mitzvah.\n\nIn the autumn of 1923, Rothko found work in New York’s garment district and took up residence on the Upper West Side. While visiting a friend at the Art Students League of New York, he saw students sketching a model. According to Rothko, this was the beginning of his life as an artist. Even his self-described “beginning” at the Art Students League of New York was not whole-hearted commitment; two months after he returned to Portland to visit his family, he joined a theater group run by Clark Gable’s wife, Josephine Dillon. Whatever his dramatic ability may have been, he looked nothing like the successful actors of the day, and professional acting seemed an improbable career.\n\nReturning to New York, Rothko briefly enrolled in the New School of Design, where one of his instructors was the artist Arshile Gorky. This was probably his first encounter with a member of the “avant-garde”. That autumn, he took courses at the Art Students League of New York taught by still-life artist Max Weber, a fellow Russian Jew. It was due to Weber that Rothko began to see art as a tool of emotional and religious expression, and Rothko’s paintings from this era reveal a Weberian influence.\n\nWikipedia"
