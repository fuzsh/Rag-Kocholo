Ramu (NTR) opposes and mobilizes the villagers to fight against him. Padma (Jayaprada) who is the Daughter of Forest officer (Jaggayya) loves him. One tribal lady Chilakamma (Jayasudha) also loves Ramu as a brother. Nagabhushanam takes the help of Jaggu (Sridhar) to send Ramu away from the forest. Later half of the film reveals that Ramu is in fact a Forest officer .. in a secret mission to investigate the case of Forest affairs. In climax, all the criminals were punished.\n\nCrew :\n\nOn Screen : NTR, Jayaprada, Jayasudha, Kongara Jaggayya, Sridhar, Nagabhushanam, Kaikala Satyanarayana,Raja Babu,Pandari Bai,Gummadi Venkateswara Rao,Rama Prabha Rohini.\n\nOff Screen : K.

Banner : Satya Chitra; Producers : M.satyanarayana, Arumilli Suryanarayana\n\nTrivia :\n\nTotal Period of Shooting : 35 days (Mudumalai forest).\n\n100 Days Celebrations- Apsara Theatre, Eluru Road, Vijayawada (Chief Guest : Dileep Kumar, Bollywood Actor)\n\n200 Days Celebrations – Taj Coromandal Hotel, Madras (Now Chennai) : Chief Guest : Raj Kapoor\n\nInspired by Gandhadha Gudi (Kannada Movie), Sholay (Hindi Movie);\n\nAdavi Ramudu collections were 4 crores (This is equals to 500 crores of todays estimation of cost). It runs daily 5 shows in Kanaka Mahal Theatre, Nellore to meet the traffic. It runs like 208 days in that particular theatre.\n\nThe film had run for 365 days in 4 centers.\n\nOne of the member of Censor Board was Malati Chandur, Noted Writer\n\nMany people benefited from the phenomenal success of this film, the first being its\n\ndirector K.Raghavendra Rao. Though he got noticed with his first movie (Babu, 1975) itself, it was this film that catapulted him into the league of super directors. 1977 was a dream come true for NTR.\n\nWith two sensational hits- Yamagola being the other- in just six months, NTR became the primus inter pares (first among equals) of Telugu cinema.\n\nBoth the female leads – Jayapradha and Jayasudha got a huge break with this movie and from then on they went on to become top stars ending the two way domination of Vanishree and Manjula.\n\nAdavi Ramudu was shown for 254 days in Kakinada—Devi 70mm a/c 134 days+ Lakshmi 120 days.Adavi Ramudu was houseful for 47 days at Venkatesa 70mm, the then biggest theater in A.P. Its gross collection of 13,56,000 was twice the amount of the previous single theater record collection.\n\nJayasudha & Jayaprada were escaped accident by narrowly while doing a scene they were sitting on elephants. Junior artistes were practicing a Dappu scene right then, and the elephants got panicked by the noise and threw down them with their trunks. Another one was a chase scene by the villans to the heroins who are on a horse cart. The cart’s axle broke and both of them were injured and were forced to rest for a couple of days\n\nThere were only three Government Guesthouses in Madumalai forest, and the producers could not accommodate the 300 plus cast and crew in that dense forest.So the producers took carpenters, molders, painters, etc. to the forest, worked for fifty days to build new guesthouses and took special permission for electricity in the middle of the forest. The nearest town/ airport was 250 km away from the forest, and for every small thing, they had to go all the way to Mysore. Thus, they used to get all of a day’s needs each morning from Mysore.\n\nGross collections in some prominent centers: Hyderabad-13,56,000 (Venkatesa70mm); Visakapatnam-13,94,429.5 (366 days); Tirupati 3,35,513.10 (100 days); Kurnool-3,02,058.10 (Anand only); Kakinada-7,00,000 (total run);\n\nAll Time Super Hit Songs : Aarasukoboyi Paaresukunnanu,Ammathodu Abbathodu Neethodu,Kuku Kuku Kokilamma Pelliki Konantha Pandiri,Manishai Puttinavadu Kaaradu Matti Bomma..Krushi Vunte Manushulu Rushulautaru”.\n\nEnd of Retro@28th April : Adavi Ramudu\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
