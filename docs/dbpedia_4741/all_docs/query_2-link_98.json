        "text": "Divya Bharti's (born 25 February 1974, died 5 April 1993) real name was Divya Om Prakash Bharti. Her mother's name was Meeta and father was Om Prakash. She was married to Sajid Nadiadwala, a Hindi film producer from 1992 until her death.\n\nShe recieved a FilmFare Award (1992) for Fresh New Face. She starred in 18 films. She made her debut at the age of 16 in a South Indian film called Bobbili Raja (1990) made by Gopal B. This movie was dubbed in Hindi as Rampur ka Raja.\n\nHer Hindi films included [[Deewana],Vishwatma,Shola Aur Shabnam and Dil Ka Kya Kasoor.\n\nThe actress slipped and fell from the window-sill of her husband's fifth floor flat at Tulsi Apartments in Versova (Mumbai) early on the morning of April 5. Apparently, she was drunk. Many believe she was murdered because she knew too much.\n\nShe was well loved for her childlike behaviour and the almost angelic quality of her face.\n\nPlenty of histrionics followed her death. Her husband was admitted to Copper Hospital after he collapsed on hearing of her death. He fainted again after lighting her funeral pyre. Her father suffered a mild heart attack after he heard of her death.\n\nSajid Nadiadwala is suspected to have underworld links and has come under the scanner several times. In 2005 he was fighting allegations of underworld links once again after his film ‘Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega’ was listed as one of the films financed by Abu Salem. He is a close friend of the controversial Salman Khan.\n\nNadiadwala is also a distant cousin of actress Tabu. After Divya's death a romance developed between the two and at one point she was seriously contemplating marrying him.\n\nNadiadwala is now married to Warda Khan and the couple have a son called Shubhaan.\n\nAbout 500 people attended the funeral of the then youngest heroine of the silver screen, including Anil Kapoor, Amrish Puri, Raj Babbar, Yash Chopra, Jimmy Nirula, Sudhakar Bokade, Mukesh Duggal, Raza murad, Vikas Anand, Ram Mohan, Javed Khan, Raj Kanwar, Nitin Manmohan and Pehlaj Nehlani, maker of her first hit, Shola aur Shabnam.\n\nA large number of film personalities, including Hema Malini, Karishma Kapoor, Sangeeta Bijlani, Chandni, Manisha Koirala and Asha Parekh, offered condolences to the bereaved family members at their residence."
