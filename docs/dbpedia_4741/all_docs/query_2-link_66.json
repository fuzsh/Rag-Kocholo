        "text": "I am a Maharashtrian currently staying in Mumbai, and I have been watching Telugu films in Telugu for a long time. In 2016, I watched my first Telugu film in theatre and ever since I have watched multiple Telugu and other South Indian language films in their original languages in theatres in Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad too (watched AVPL on Sankranti morning there). PVR has usually been my choice of theatre to watch these films, primarily because they almost always have subtitles and the theatres are generally well maintained.\n\nBut things have taken a turn for the worse. I had thought of watching Saripodhaa Sanivaaram in theatres but PVR/INOX hasn't even opened the bookings outside the South Indian states. Apparently they don't release South Indian language movies with a gap of less than 8 weeks between theatrical and OTT release, outside the South Indian states; and I'm wondering if that applies for this film too.\n\nThe last South Indian film I watched in its original language in a PVR was Jailer. I couldn't watch Kalki in Telugu because my friends don't know the language. The experience of watching a couple of other South Indian language films in other theatres was downright bad.\n\nFor someone like me who only watches South Indian films in theatres, Hyderabad seems to be the best option with the range of theatres it has, from Prasads to RTC X Roads theatres to other popular single screens across the city to independent or upcoming multiplexes like AMB, AAA etc. As a Telugu movie lover it gives me huge FOMO. I guess the only thing left to do is to move to Hyderabad."
