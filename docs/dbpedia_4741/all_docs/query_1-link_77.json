        "text": "Narses in English dictionary\n\nMeanings and definitions of \"Narses\"\n\nproper\n\na male given name of historical usage\n\nmore\n\nSample sentences with \"Narses\"\n\nDeclension Stem\n\nThe Goths holding Rome capitulated and, at the Battle of Mons Lactarius in October 553, Narses defeated Teias and the last remnants of the Gothic army in Italy.\n\nThe death of Narses along with the failure to stop the Persians damaged the prestige of Phocas' military regime.\n\nIn 568, Narses was removed from his position as prefect of Italia.\n\nTeia, the new Ostrogothic king, gathered the remnants of the Ostrogothic army and marched to relieve the siege, but in October 552 Narses ambushed him at Mons Lactarius (modern Monti Lattari) in Campania, near Mount Vesuvius and Nuceria Alfaterna.\n\nDon't say anything without knowing the matter, Narsing.\n\nA further cause of the Lombard migration into Italy may have been an invitation from Narses.\n\nThe two had allied against Phocas, with Narses gathering his forces in Edessa, while waiting for Sassanid reinforcements.\n\nThey attempted to invade the rest of the Marzpanate of Armenia later in the year but were defeated by Aratius and Narses.\n\nBloody John wrote back in downright refusal â€” he would take orders from Narses alone.\n\nDissension in the Roman chain of command exacerbated the situation, as John and Justin refused to move without orders from Narses.\n\nOstrogothic power in Italy was eliminated, but according to Roman historian Procopius of Caesarea, Narses allowed the Ostrogothic population and their Rugian allies to live peacefully in Italy under Roman sovereignty.\n\nMany lives would have been saved and much treasure spared if we had only trusted to our Narses.\n\nNarses was to take more than a year to reach Italy after his appointment, as his entire army made a long march along the coast of the Adriatic Sea.\n\nThey were aided by Khosrau's use of a pretender claiming to be Maurice's son, and by the revolt against Phocas led by the Roman general Narses.\n\nHowever, the general Narses, who rose against Phocas in Mesopotamia, exploited these rumours: he produced a false Theodosius, and claimed to be fighting in his name.\n\nCasca decides Narses must finally be brought to justice.\n\nIn 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of Blarathon.\n\nAlthough Narses had no military experience, he proved surprisingly adept.\n\nMatti Manushulu is a 1990 Telugu drama film written and directed by B. Narsing Rao starring Archana.\n\nIn the aftermath of this disaster, Narses was recalled, and Belisarius confirmed as supreme commander with absolute authority for Italy.\n\nConstantius promptly attacked Narses, and after suffering minor setbacks defeated and killed Narses at the Battle of Narasara.\n\nMeanwhile Belisarius kept his patience and even managed to persuade Narses to join him in the siege of Urbino.\n\nJustinian's envoy on this occasion was Narses, the Court Chamberlain.\n\nAuthors"
