Autograph Letter Signed (\"Rayleigh\"), 2 1/4 pp, 12mo (conjoined leaves), [London], February 6, 1895, on personal stationery, [to the scientific correspondent Henry Currie Mariller,] pale toning and a little soiled at folds. Mentioning experiments on argon, the discovery of which Rayleigh published later that year, in 1895, and which later earned him the Nobel Prize. In part: \" I am now getting to work at the Roy[al] Inst[itute], I shall be setting up duplicates of my connecting[?] apparatus for separation of argon. In a week or two I hope this will be at work & I should be happy to show it to you .\" \"Few discoveries have been as dramatic as the discovery of argon in the atmosphere by Lord Rayleigh and William Ramsay ... by the beginning of 1894 Rayleigh was convinced that the atmosphere contained a new, and hitherto unknown, constituent...The final announcement was made at a meeting of the Royal Society at University College, London, on 31 January 1895, less than a week after Lord Kelvin in his presidential address to the Royal Society had referred to the discovery of the new constituent as the greatest scientific event of the year...\" ( DNB ).",
