        "text": "John William Strutt Lord Rayleigh\n\nBorn: 12 Nov 1842 in Langford Grove (near Maldon), Essex, England\n\nDied: 30 June 1919 in Terling Place, Witham, Essex, England\n\nShow birthplace location\n\nPrevious (Chronologically) Next Biographies Index Previous (Alphabetically) Next Welcome page\n\nJohn William Strutt suffered from poor health and his schooling at Eton and Harrow was disrupted and for four years he had a private tutor. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1861, graduating in 1864.\n\nHis first paper in 1865 was on Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. He worked on propogation of sound and, while on an excursion to Egypt taken for health reasons, Strutt wrote Treatise on Sound (1870-1). In 1879 he wrote a paper on travelling waves, this theory has now developed into the theory of solitons. His theory of scattering (1871) was the first correct explanation of why the sky is blue.\n\nIn 1873 he succeeded to the title of Baron Rayleigh. From 1879 to 84 he was the second Cavendish professor of experimental physics at Cambridge succeeding Maxwell. Then in 1884 he became secretary of the Royal Society. Rayleigh discovered the inert gas argon in 1895, work which earned him a Nobel Prize, in 1904.\n\nHe was awarded the De Morgan Medal of the London Mathematical Society in 1890 and was president of the Royal Society between 1905 and 1908. He became chancellor of Cambridge University in 1908.\n\nReferences (8 books/articles)\n\nReferences elsewhere in this archive:\n\nJohn W Strutt (Rayleigh) was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1873.
