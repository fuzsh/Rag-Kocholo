        "text": "Read more&colon; “The nature of nothingness“\n\nNOBLE gases are so called because, like the nobility, they do nothing. You might also call them rare gases, because they are so rare on Earth as to be nearly non-existent. The one exception is argon, which we inhale as 1 per cent of every breath, though it has no effect on our bodies whatsoever. Helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radioactive radon are odourless, tasteless, practically non-reactive wisps of unconnected atoms. In this material universe, they amount to just about nothing at all.\n\nAnd yet… it would be hard to make a case that any other group of elements has had a greater impact on our understanding of the universe. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution needs an Earth many millions of years old in order for it to have had time to work. Yet the Bible placed a limit on Earth’s age at a mere 6000 years. How was this argument resolved? The answer was helium, which is generated in rocks containing uranium and thorium.\n\nWhen these elements undergo radioactive decay they release alpha particles, which are really just helium nuclei that easily pick up electrons to create the gas. In 1906, armed with this idea and the rate of production of alpha particles by uranium, thorium and their decay products, Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy dated several rocks at up to 500 million years; the Earth would have to be at least that old. (Later work with lead isotopes pinned down the age to around 4.5 billion years.) Not only did Rutherford and Soddy create the concept of…"
