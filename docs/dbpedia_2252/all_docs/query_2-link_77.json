        "text": "Nothing sculpts sexy muscle quite like boxing. Top model Lais Ribeiro shows off a few key moves from boxing hot spot Aerospace NYC. The studio is known for its tough, transformative classes—like the new boxing-inspired AeroPower. Cycle through the circuit below, featuring total-body conditioning moves from the studio, four times. Rest 30 seconds between sets.\n\nCardio Burst\n\nJump rope for 2 minutes. Use a weighted rope for an extra challenge ($25, AerospaceNYC.com).\n\nUpper-Body Burn\n\nStand with left foot forward, on ball of right foot, fists at chin. Extend left fist forward, then snap it back. Continue for 1 minute. Switch sides and repeat for 1 minute.\n\nCardio Burst\n\nJump rope for 2 minutes.\n\nLower-Body Blast\n\nHold a 3-pound dumbbell in each hand. Jump left foot as far as possible to left, pumping arms for balance as you go. Repeat to right. Continue for 2 minutes.\n\n6 Boxing Tips\n\nPunch Line: \"Orthodox position\" is the ready stance for throwing left-handed jabs. To get in it: Position left foxot forward, right heel up, hands at chin height with elbows out.\n\nCrop It: Coordination and power begin with your core, says trainer Michael Olajide Jr., cofounder of Aerospace NYC. To strengthen yours, start abs moves slowly (like, one-crunch-every-two-seconds slowly), gradually increasing speed.\n\nTime Out: A double-ended bag is connected to both the floor and ceiling. Why it rocks: It teaches you proper timing for delivering punches while improving your reflexes.\n\nStep Lively: Use a light (3- to 5-pound) weight for high reps of strength moves on non-boxing days—you'll up muscle endurance, so you can go harder and last longer in the ring.\n\nUp You Go: \"Think of your wrists as motors when you're jumping rope,\" Olajide Jr. says. \"Fast wrists mean fast jumps.\" To recruit more core muscles, flex your abs with each jump.\n\nPower Pose: To maximize the recovery intervals in a boxing workout, stay on your feet. Standing or walking during downtime helps your heart pump oxygen to muscles.\n\nAbove: To recruit more core muscles, flex your abs with each jump. Bodysuit, $325; Baja-East.com.
