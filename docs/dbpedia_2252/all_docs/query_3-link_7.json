        "text": "Karlie saying she's 6'1\" in the public eye is surely an understatement. Everyone knows she is at least 6'2\". I've seen her out and about in NYC and she towers over guys considered very tall. She is a giant. I think she is shaving inches from her height because she is still dealing with that young woman insecurity complex (who wouldn't if you're in the public eye and taller than all the other girls?).\n\nKarlie is tall, gargantuan even, especially when you see her in person she is very impressive but she is actually a solid 6'1\", she is not 6'2\" and never will be.\n\nPeople forget that 6'2\" is over 188cm.\n\nThat is 8 cm taller than models like Magda Fraçkowiak and Lais Ribeiro who are both 180cm and trust when I tell you, Karlie is not 8cm taller than either of them.\n\nWhat happens is, people just start adding centimetres and inches here and there and suddenly models are 3 inches taller on paper than they are in real life, which is exactly what happened to the likes of Tiiu and Oluchi. Suddenly they're 190cm tall!\n\nIt's exaggeration.\n\nKarlie is the same height as Frida and Kirsi. She's also a good 2-3cm shorter than Marikka Juhler.\n\nIf Karlie is \"at least\" 6'2\", Marikka is hovering around 190-192cm!\n\nHogwash\n\nWith the trend leaning towards taller girls I can only imagine the norm for runway height being 6'0 or more within the next few years. Especially when people realize there is a major over saturation of girls who don't really have what it takes, and only a several hundred or so girls are destined for promising careers.\n\nI actually think there was more of a trend toward taller girls in the early-mid 2000s.\n\nYou had giants like Michelle Buswell, Tiiu, Hana S, Diana Gärtner, Jade Parfitt, Erin O'Connor, Oluchi, Adina Fohlin and Jaquetta Wheeler waltzing around.\n\nTaking into account there were less girls overall I think the percentage of taller girls was greater and you had designers who were happy using them consistently like Tom Ford, Galliano and Gaultier.\n\nRight now there are not too many who are taller than 6 foot against those who aren't but I like the fact that the tall girls are still getting booked.\n\nI think the tallest one now, who is getting runway work at least, is Marikka.\n\nOops, I know this thread is about the shorties\n\nWell I'm guilty of it, I used to say Irina K was 6'2\" and actually believed it until she herself told me she was 6'.\n\nI've seen people say things like \"Kirsi is rumoured to be 6'3\"\n\nAnd then it all starts......Kirsi becomes 6'3\" which means so does Frida Gustavsson because we all know they're the same height...and on and on it goes.\n\nBarbara is no taller than 5'7\" and Juliana I'd say is 'around' 5'9\" although I believe she's 5'9.5\" because I know she's only a few cm shorter than Daria Strokous (definitely not 2 inches) difference.\n\nYou'd think that with Kate Moss breaking down barriers & showing that girls not meeting the \"height requirement\" didn't mean she couldn't (figuratively) stand shoulder to shoulder with the tall girls . In the process carving out an ENVIABLE career & becoming an ICON\n\nPersonally, I think the industry should be a little more inclusive towards some of these girls as most these shorties are some of the MOST stunning & interesting looking girls currently out there & editorially can be are real powerhouses\n\nYou'd think that with Kate Moss breaking down barriers & showing that girls not meeting the \"height requirement\" didn't mean she couldn't (figuratively) stand shoulder to shoulder with the tall girls .

Although I think there's something quite special about the shorter girls compared to models 5'9\"-5'11\" etc which is the height bracket that MOST of the models fit into, and that's that the shorter models that are out there are successful.\n\nIf you think about the number of girls who are under 5'8\", there are so few and the ones that there are, have pretty solid careers which I don't doubt has something to do with the fact that they are unique.\n\nLook at Bianca Balti, Cara D, Laetitia Casta, Sasha Pivovarova and Barbara....all shorties with significantly successful careers.\n\nYou were talking a little about your height, not thinking that you were going to do shows, do you think right now it’s easier for a model who is shorter to get her foot in the door?\n\nKRISTINE: I actually think so, though when I go to castings they always tell me I’m too short, so I guess the height is actually pretty important for the industry but maybe they’ll make an exception. I mean, Kate Moss she’s not that tall and she got very far!\n\nmodels.com\n\nI’m about 5’7”, which is really small compared to the other girls. When they have castings for the shows, I feel like E.T. because I’m very different. My body is different. My face is different. My body is very small—when I try on clothes, they fall off… It can be very difficult for me, sometimes, when you’re doing castings all day, every day, by the end of the day, you feel less confident. Even though Inez has given me a lot of confidence, I’m still not that confident. I know that people think I’m beautiful, but when I look at my face, I’m not very nice to myself. I think a lot of women are like that. When I see other girls, I always think that they’re better than me. Maybe one day I'll be super confident, but in the meantime, no. I always appreciated my eyebrows, though.\n\nLoulou Robert\n\nintothegloss.com\n\nI feel for girls who are under the 5'7\" mark, like Kristine. Instantly, you are noticeable less bookable to allllll the other girls there. It must be weird to be a room full of girls 5'10\" and up while you are like 4-6 inches shorter than everyone in there. I think its not realistic to expect to have a good runway career while being short. But I think its possible to have a good print career, if you can build up the hype without the same type of exposure girls get from the runway.\n\n.....I think its not realistic to expect to have a good runway career while being short. But I think its possible to have a good print career, if you can build up the hype without the same type of exposure girls get from the runway.\n\nI like that. I agree..\n\nIt is not realistic, which is why I think the shorties that there are, are infact so successful. Their 'disadvantage' if you will, is exploited and it, at least in my opinion, gives them much more appeal.\n\nWould Kate Moss be as successful as she is if she was 5'9\" or 5'10\"?\n\nI honestly don't think so. I think that her shorter height has contributed significantly to her success."
