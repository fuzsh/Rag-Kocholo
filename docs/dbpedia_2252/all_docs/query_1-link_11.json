        "text": "Charline said on 11/May/23\n\nRob, is 5'11-6'0 more prototypical height nowadays in the 3rd decade of 21st century for female fashion model than 5'9-5'10,\n\nsince 180-183 is very tall and clearly tall but not too much like 6'1-6'2 are. What do you think?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nYou see a greater proportion of models within 5ft 10-6ft range nowadays.\n\nIrem said on 6/Aug/22\n\nHello Rob\n\nHow tall do you think Victoria De Angelis is? Some sites say she is 5â4, and others say 5â6. But then, again, I do get confused when she is sitting next to her band mates\n\nEditor Rob\n\nCompared to band-mates, would have said 5ft 4 at most\n\nDavid Tang said on 6/Jun/22\n\nhow tall do you think oluchi onweangba is rob?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nClick Here - she claimed 5ft 11\n\nmodelfan said on 16/Nov/21\n\nHello Rob,\n\nHow tall do you think Paloma Elsesser is? She looks a flat 5'6 to me, every time I see her on the runway.\n\nAlso curious what you think about new-gen model heights. Mika Schneider, Anok Yai and Maty Fall, perhaps :P\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI have not kept up with new models, but Paloma's agency height seems too high. From briefly looking, I can see 5ft 6 as a more believable height for her.\n\nsashapivorarovafan said on 9/Jul/21\n\nHello Rob, I'd like to know. Do you think Sasha Pivovarova could be 5'7-5'8 instead of 5'9?\n\nAlso what do you think was her height during her modeling days?\n\nThanks in advance for the answer!\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI would have said at least 5ft 8 for Sasha\n\nfollowmeriver said on 24/Mar/21\n\nThank you for the reply. Do you have any idea about Shalom Harlow's weight in the 90s please?\n\nEditor Rob\n\ncould have been close to 140\n\nfollowmeriver said on 21/Mar/21\n\nHello Rob, I found this pic. Amber Valletta is listed as 5ft8 1/2, how tall do you think Shalom and Kirsty are based on this pic? Amber and Kirsty are in flats and Shalom's wearing boots. I think Kirsty doesn't look much taller than Amber to be an alleged 5'11 Click Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nshe can look 5ft 10-10.5 that moment\n\nfollowmeriver said on 11/Mar/21\n\nHello Rob, do you think Shalom Harlow and Kirsty Hume are legit 5'11?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nwould have thought Hume could look weaker 5ft 11\n\nShoepergirl said on 17/Feb/21\n\nNot to out anyone, but I have a feeling Alexina Graham is 190cm. Sheâs heaps taller than Coco Rocha and her sister in an Instagram post said âyouâre 6â4!!!â\n\nModels have to lie lower than their real height if theyâre too tall. I have a friend at 186 and she lies that sheâs 180...\n\nVitto said on 13/Oct/19\n\nRob, and do you guys think almost 5'11 (5'10 7/8) basically 180m is an ideal height for a female model to start a career in modelling?\n\nVitto said on 7/Oct/19\n\nRob, what about Italian model Vittoria Ceretti? Do you think she is 5'9? Not sure about the 5'9.25 Google gives her. Here she is with Kaia Gerber (yellow dress).\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nLooks like she'd be no more than 5ft 9\n\nVitto said on 5/Oct/19\n\nRob, how tall do you think British model Edie Campbell is? I like her, I think she could be added to the site however I think she is not the full 5'10 as Google says. Here she is with Cara Delevingne (the blonder one), I think she is just a bit taller and here she was past her age of growing.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nIt's not impossible she is close to that mark, I think she generally looks over 5ft 9 from what I've seen, but I haven't looked *that* much at her.\n\nLatinMix said on 1/Oct/19\n\n@al001\n\nKortagarena looks like 6'1 with the 6'2.5 Nicholas Hoult\n\n6'0 - 6'1.5 max height for Jon Kortagarena is correct\n\n*Click Here*\n\nJeanbabe said on 18/Aug/19\n\nWhat do guys think about i-hua wuâs height (maybelline model)?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nHer 5ft 10 model height doesn't seem too hard to buy\n\nal001 said on 3/Aug/19\n\nIf he does get listed, Jon Kortajarena is not 6'2.\n\nHe's more like 6'0-6'1.\n\nWith 6'0 Luke Evans:\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nWith 6'1-6'1.5 Kris Wu:\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nMiss Sandy Cowell said on 27/Jun/19\n\n@ Matttttttthew - How very thoughtful of you to go to all that trouble! ðð\n\nMatttttttttthew said on 26/Jun/19\n\nResponding to Mary Anne's May 5, 2019 \"ask\" :\n\n1-carmen kass: 5'10\" flat....1.78 m ....NOT 1.79 m\n\n2-stella tennant: 5'11 and 1/2 - 6'0\" (she looks 6'0\" (1.83 m) to me...)\n\n3-natasha poly: 5'9\" - 5'9.5\" (she's definitely NOT 5'10\" (1.78 m)....)\n\n4-mariacarla boscono: 5'8\" (often listed as 5'10\" - but she's often the shortest model on the runway in any given show....)\n\n5-freja beha erichsen: 5'10.5\" - 5'11\" (listed during career as 1.78....looks taller....)\n\n6-kristen mcmenamy: a weak 5'10\"\n\n7-shalom harlow: 5'11 1/4\" - 6'0\"\n\n8-caroline trentini: 6'0.5 (1.84 m) - she's NOT 5'11\" - she confirmed 6'0.5\" in Brazilian interviews...\n\n9-grace elizabeth: 5'9-5'9.5\"\n\n10-vlada roslykova: 5'9.5\"\n\n11-snejana onopka: 5'9\" (1.75)\n\n12-sasha pivovarova: 5'7\" - 5'7.5\"\n\n13-yasmeen ghauri: 5'10.5 (my guess....)\n\n14-karen mulder: 5'9.5 - 5'10\"\n\n15-daniela pestova: 5'11\"\n\n16-brandi quinones: 5'9.5\"\n\n17-esther canadas: 5'8.5\" (notoriously listed at 5'10\" - which is laughable)\n\n18-alexina graham: looks like a flat, even 5'11\" (1.80) to me...could be 6'0\"\n\n19-hana soukupova: 6'0.5 - 6'1\"\n\n20-daria werbowy: MOST DEFINITELY 5'11\" flat (1.80) - not a cm over 1.80\n\n21-jessica stam: 5'10\" - 5'10.5 (probably 1.79....)\n\n22-raquel zimmermann: 5'10.5 (1.79) flat\n\n23-carmen dellâorefice: listed anywhere between 5'9\" and 5'11\" - looks like a strong 5'10\"\n\n24-kim alexis: a weak 5'9\" (1.75)\n\n25-imaan hammam: 5'10.5\" (1.79)\n\n26-vittoria ceretti: 5'8.5 - 5'9\"\n\n27-adut akech: looks 5'9\" to me....\n\n28-liya kebede: 5'8\" (same as Karen Elson...)\n\n29-lily donaldson: 5'8\" (notoriously listed at 5'10\"....which is off-base....)\n\n30-renee simonsen: 5'9.5\"-5'10\" (the Danes are tall...and Danish models are often prototypical fashion model height....)\n\nMaryAnne said on 5/May/19\n\nplease add these models robs\n\n1-carmen kass\n\n2-stella tennant\n\n3-natasha poly\n\n4-mariacarla boscono\n\n5-freja beha erichsen\n\n6-kristen mcmenamy\n\n7-shalom harlow\n\n8-caroline trentinj\n\n9-grace elizabeth\n\n10-vlada roslykova\n\n11-snejana onopka\n\n12-sasha pivovarova\n\n13-yasmeen ghauri\n\n14-karen mulder\n\n15-daniela pestova\n\n16-brandi quinones\n\n17-esther canadas\n\n18-alexina graham\n\n19-hana soukupova\n\n20-daria werbowy\n\n21-jessica stam\n\n22-raquel zimmermann\n\n23-carmen dellâorefice\n\n24-kim alexis\n\n25-imaan hammam\n\n26-vittoria ceretti\n\n27-adut akech\n\n28-liya kebede\n\n29-lily donaldson\n\n30-renee simonsen\n\nOliver said on 3/Dec/18\n\nRob,if you have time,could you take a look at Maria Borges,Ming Xi,and Monika Jagaciak? They are famous models and worth adding to this site.\n\nThank you.\n\nBigfern194-192cm said on 22/Nov/18\n\nRob, Can you look into Tyson Ballou. He is widely considered the most successful male model of all time and if you look at him it would come as no surprise. Looks very tall. Listed between 6,1 and 6,2 he is consistently taller than other 6,2 listed male models and towers the 5,10-5,11 women he works with. I personally think he is in the 6,2.5-6,3.5 range.\n\nHijoputamos said on 17/Sep/18\n\nLegend Scott Barnhill, anyone?\n\nDifferent compcards 6ft1 186 188 6ft2...\n\nManuel Santiago said on 14/Sep/18\n\nHow tall would you say Rafael miller (@rafmiller) is. Heâs listed as 187.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nIf you look at him with another model Jaed who gets called 6ft 1 or 2, he doesn't seem like he'd be as tall as 187cm himself...though I've not really seen enough to say if he was 184-5\n\nOliver said on 19/Aug/18\n\nClick Here\n\nRob,if Dr.mike is 6'3,how tall would be his partner(Jennifer Lahmers)?\n\nThank you.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nMight be somewhere in 5ft 5 range, though the grass can always throw heights off a bit.\n\nOliver said on 17/Aug/18\n\nRob,can you please take time to add Monika Jagaciak and Hana Soukuopova.\n\nThank you.\n\nMaryAnne said on 13/Aug/18\n\nRob. i insist trish goff :) i will appreciate it\n\nMaryAnne said on 25/Jul/18\n\nRob can you bring back trish goff and add more models thnx\n\nMaryAnne said on 12/Jul/18\n\nRob i remember model trish goff had a page but suddenly disappeared. Can you bring her page back?\n\nOliver said on 8/Jul/18\n\nClick Here\n\nHi,Rob.\n\nHow much do you think this girl could weigh if she is 5ft 9ish?\n\nShe is listed at 51kg by her agency but that seems too low for such a tall stature.\n\nThanks alot.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nMore towards 54kg than 51 I'd have thought.\n\ngil said on 17/Apr/18\n\nCan you add Gia Carangi and Kaia Gerber?\n\nMaryAnne said on 24/Jan/18\n\nModels that must be added:\n\n1-Hana Soukupova\n\n2-Carmen Kass\n\n3-Mariacarla Boscono\n\n4-Caroline Trentini\n\n5-Caroline Winberg\n\n6-Sasha Pivovarova\n\n7-Daria Werbowy\n\n8-Jessica Stam\n\n9-Carmen Dell'orefice\n\n10-Grace Elizabeth\n\n11-Vittoria Ceretti\n\n12-Liya Kebede\n\n13-Adwoa Aboah\n\n14-Imaan Hammam\n\n15-Elise Crombez\n\n16-Raquel Zimmermann\n\n17-Freja Beha Erichsen\n\n18-Hilary Rhoda\n\n19-Lily Donaldson\n\n20-Kim Alexis\n\nMaryAnne said on 21/Jan/18\n\nRob, can you add Adwoa Aboah model of the 2017? she looks shorter than other models?\n\nMaryAnne said on 17/Jan/18\n\nCould you add Gia Carangi? She as 5'7 but listed 5'8 in that it was the minimum height for modelling.\n\nMaryAnne said on 29/Dec/17\n\nAny idea of 90's taller models like Shalom Harlow,Stella Tennant and Kirsty Hume? Are they 5'11 equally?\n\nShane said on 17/Dec/17\n\nTo Allie - Jade Parfitt is 6'1.5\" (187cm) and Erin is just over 6' (184cm). Sometimes Erin appears taller but that'll just be shoes, posture and the angle of the photo but Jade is definitely taller.\n\nAllie said on 16/Dec/17\n\nHi Rob! How tall do you think Hana Soukupova looking at the pics I've shown? I think she can look 6'1-1.55 but she is very close in height with German model Julia Stegner whom you have at 6'0.5.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nhow much over 6ft I'm not sure on yet.\n\nMaryAnne said on 13/Dec/17\n\nThoughts about Georgia Fowler? Is she really that short with a height that almost equals to that of Sara's?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nnot that familiar yet with her.\n\nAllie said on 3/Dec/17\n\nMaryAnne - 5'9-10.\n\nMaryAnne said on 2/Dec/17\n\nWhat are your thoughts about Natasha Poly?\n\nAllie said on 30/Nov/17\n\nHi Rob! Sorry to bug but I have two questions!\n\n1. I know Erin O'Connor and Jade Parfitt have said that they're both said they're 6'1 but sometimes each can usually look taller or shorter than the other. Is this likely because of things like posture and the fact that they're likely both so close in height?\n\n2. Do you think Hana Soukupova looks 6'1.5?\n\nIn flats she is barley shorter than Karolina whose wearing heels that likely add 3 inches!\n\nClick Here\n\nHere she is in flat sandals with supposedly 6'5 Sam Talbot in sneakers, so he's probably 6'6.\n\nClick Here\n\nIf she was standing straight I'd bet that she come up to his eyebrow level.\n\nClick Here\n\nWith Malin Akerman whose wearing platforms!\n\nClick Here\n\nWith Lindsay Ellingson.\n\nClick Here\n\nI know 6'2 is too much because she is shorter than Tiiu Kiuk who is said to be 6'2 herself. Fashion people have said she's rumored to be 6'1.5.\n\nMaryAnne said on 22/Nov/17\n\nyeah nick bateman needs a page asap\n\nJon said on 2/Sep/17\n\nAndres Velencoso at 6'2 is often doubted, assumed to be 6'4 but he does look 6'2, maybe 6'3 next to 6'1.5\" kortajarena in this pics but shoes not visible.\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nIf Andres is 6'4 it would extend the height range of ideal model height by an inch or two since he is one of the top male models in the world.\n\nVegril said on 11/Jul/17\n\nOh cmon height is important but height is not everything ots about looks and your persnality guys those who have short are alao can do modeling height doesnt matter if u have pasaionate no can stop u\n\nPeter175 said on 16/Jun/17\n\nI wish you'd make a page for Nick Bateman.\n\nHe's like the king of instagram and tons of people want to know what his height is. I think 189 range is probably the best fit. Lot taller than a guy like O'Pry\n\nJosh said on 1/Jun/17\n\nGandy,\n\nyeah I agree. His profile on models.com now says \"6'1\". I guess he and Ballou are 6'1, but 6'2 is thought of as the best height. I think they downgrade taller guys to 6'2 and while 6'1 is thought of as \"good enough\", sometimes they'll upgrade those guys an inch to 6'2. I guess that's the ideal height for a male model.\n\nAllie said on 27/May/17\n\nThe tallest I've ever seen a female model listed at was 6'1.5/187 cm. I've never actually seen anything higher unless it was like an athlete or something who was signed on where they had to tell the truth.\n\nFor males, I think it was 6'5.\n\nKm said on 15/Apr/17\n\nRob how tall do you think runway coach j alexander from antm is? He's listed 6'5 but I'd say he's about 6'2, 6'3.\n\nGandy said on 15/Apr/17\n\nClick Here\n\nPietro Boselli with model Isabelle Daza who is listed at 5'7\". Both are barefoot (as seen at 1:44). I'm really struggling to see Pietro Boselli at anything more than 6'0\" in this video.\n\n@Josh\n\nit's very likely he's just 186cm. I see no reason why they would downgrade somebody unless they're 6'3\"+ at which point they're considered too tall to be ideal. I believe Tyson Ballou is a similar case because in some old catwalk videos he's listed as 185cm but probably got upgraded to 6'2\" at some point after he rose to fame.\n\nJay said on 13/Apr/17\n\nRob here's a italian model name Eva Riccobono. She's listed at 5'10 (1.78) but looks taller about maybe 5'11 (1.80) what do you think?\n\nArthur John said on 15/Mar/17\n\n@Rob What's your Guess on Simon Nessman? Henrique gives me the impression of a solid 187\n\nEditor Rob\n\nunfortunately don't have much knowledge on Simon.\n\nJosh said on 12/Mar/17\n\nAnyone have guesses on Chad White?\n\nListed at 6'2, but only 186 cm on models.com\n\nSeen inseam lengths and suit sizes at both 32 and 34 and R and L, lol.\n\nAny chance he could be only 6'1?\n\nGandy said on 6/Mar/17\n\nI think Pietro Boselli is just 6'0\". After looking at him more, he rarely gives the impression of having a big height advantage over other guys like you would expect from a proper 6'1\". He's hard to peg down though because of the lack of verifiable heights to compare him to.\n\nAdemaro said on 9/Feb/17\n\nLucky Blue Smith is a strong 6'3\n\nHijopotamus said on 7/Feb/17\n\nTrumpeven...you are right, between 5'11\" and 6'2\" was the requierement agencies set in principle with exceptions if you are extremely handsome or unique.\n\nClothes fit best if you are that height and you have to look good in the runway. For print you can be any height tho'.\n\nAlso you need the bone structure and the body. You can be the perfect height but you have wide hips or a fat looking face or a very wide neck for example.\n\nIt also depends on the designer. Vivienne Westwood likes big muscle guys and Dior shows always had super skinny androgynous guys.\n\nTrumpEvenLiedAboutHisHeight said on 3/Feb/17\n\nA friend of mine is 6ft3 aspiring model, really good looking but he gets rejected when they realise how tall 6ft3 actually looks like. He pretty much does everything possible to look 6ft2 in order to get work. Male models need to be between 5ft11 and 6ft2, but a lot of models add an inch or use their morning heights, which is the reason my friend gets the response that he does after agencies see him. They estimate him at 6ft4 when he doesn't even scrape that in the morning. A strong 6ft/6ft1 is ideal for this industry.\n\nfabrizio said on 27/Jan/17\n\nRob what do you think of mariano di vaio?5'11'?or 6?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nfabrizio, certainly not above 6ft\n\nJellybean said on 18/Jan/17\n\nHow tall is Binx Walton?\n\nGandy said on 9/Jan/17\n\nDo you think Pietro Boselli is a legit 6'1 like he's listed?

In pictures alone for some reason I would not guess over 6'0 flat. Also, Julia Stegner's very close in height with Karlie too. Weird though.. Doutzen looks almost as tall as her. Anyone's thoughts on Hana's height? I swear she's 6'2. Also, Tiiu claims 6'2 but gets listed as 6'0 flat so I won't be surprised.

I never said anything to the contrary. The point I was trying to make is that the image the designers and photographers have in their heads when they think of women who are \"5-11\" is in reality closer to 5-10 (in terms of what their true height is). That is because, as Rob acknowledged in one of my comments below, the typical discrepancy between a model's listing and their true height is around an inch. This minor fudging is engrained in the perception of height in the modeling industry, as it is in the rest of society. What it comes down to is whether you believe that people generally imagine and estimate other people's heights as being around an inch greater than what they actually are. (I do, and Rob appears to as well.) If you do, then to ascertain what the preferred actual height is in the modeling industry, you would need to subtract 0.75-1.0 inches from the preferred height listing. Of course there are exceptions, cases where the model is actually his/her listed height (if not taller), but in general I think this is the case.\n\nAllie said on 13/Jan/16\n\nSportsheight, I don't think it's a matter of real height. From my limited knowledge when a designer requests a crop of 5'11 models, they go by what the agencies and agents claim that the model is as well unless the model is a fave or as they say \"muse\" of the designer's more then likely not gonna have a general guess of what the models real height is. So after they call the model to come to a casting that's when everything is revealed. When they try on the sample sizes it's gonna be pretty obvious if the model has lied about their height or measurements.\n\nBut alas that's your opinion and that's my breakdown on it. Designers seem to want taller nowadays. I just looked at several models who signed on with IMG and given 5'10 on google. Literally all of them are listed as 5'10.5 on IMG. Though I do think the possibility of them imagining someone shorter but not too short could come into play. In terms of proportions, designers seem to want female models with short torsos and long legs. While males it's more open I guess. As long as they're skinny and everything looks proportionate then they use them. But as it's gets taller you realize that it kind of starts to looks awkward. Like Karlie for example. Good lord her smaller torso and super long legs look to long tbh. And Toni Garrn, well she's got a long torso and her legs are obviously long but it's that long legs for her height imo. Case in point, 5'11-6'0 Lais Ribeiro somehow has a long torso and long legs and I've seen comments of people saying that while it's natural it's sometimes looks creepy. I've also seen male models who were at least 6'3-6'4 on runways and Idk. It just an inch or two but it didn't have that much an impact as say the ideal 6'2 models.\n\nNot that anything's wrong with that height but I can see why designers don't like too tall or too long and gangling. Wow this was a long comment sorry.\n\nSportsHeight said on 12/Jan/16\n\nWhen it comes to the \"ideal\" height for modeling (I think using the word \"perfect\" is rather silly), there are two different angles to consider: a.) the \"ideal\" listing that agencies want to be able to put on a model's profile; and b.) the actual/real/true height that is preferred within the industry. For women, the preferred listing seems to be between 5'10\"/5'10.5\"/5'11\" (give or take a half-inch). For men, it seems to be either 6'1.5\" and 6'2\" (again, give or take a half-inch). (This is going by the frequency with which you see these listing on models' profiles.) The question of what the actual preferred height is can be rather more difficult to determine. If we are to go by the assumption that models on average are roughly 0.75-1.0 inches shorter than their listed height, then it would follow that the most in-demand true heights would be in the high 5'9\" to low 5'10\" range for women, and in the high 6'0\" to low 6'1\" range for men. This is certainly a debatable point, as a number of models are actually listed under their real height, but generally I think when designers and photographers request a female model who's 5'11\" or a male one who's 6'2\", the image they have in their mind is usually of someone roughly an inch shorter than that.\n\nMaryAnne said on 11/Jan/16\n\nRob, Is Taylor Hill 1.76 cm or 177 cm according to her own claim? I am confused with what 176 meters really is. 5'9 1/2 or 5'9.25 (as you list)?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nit's very close to 176.5, so if you round up 177, round down 176...\n\nAllie said on 8/Jan/16\n\nRob, in this day and age do you think these are the perfect model heights? 5'11 for females and 6'2 for males give or take half an inch max.\n\nNow I know they say 5'10 is perfect for females, but I've googled a lot of the newest runway models for Victoria's Secret and many of them who also do high fashion are listed at 5'11 on most sites but some sources may say 5'10.5 or 5'11.5. Same with male models. I've some 6'2 models listed as 6'2.5 here and maybe 6'1.5 on another but 6'2 seems to be the most consistent listing. Also, half inches seem to be hated because they also round up and down and anything a tad bit above, like 181 is rounded down to 5'11 when converted. I really wish we all just used the metric system or one system though!\n\nEditor Rob\n\n5ft 10 or 11 I think and 6ft 2 range are probably the most desirable.\n\nSportsHeight said on 6/Jan/16\n\nRob, obviously the accuracy of height listings is all over the place when it comes to models, both male and female. It seems they can range as much as 2.5-3 inches away from their listing in either direction. In general, however, what would you estimate is the mean/median discrepancy between listing and reality? My guess would be around an inch shorter than listed, both for men and women.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nyes, probably 2cm range, because some are indeed listed a bit shorter by agencies, which kind of balances those who are listed 1-2 inches taller than they really are.\n\nMaryAnne said on 6/Jan/16\n\nI think Caroline Trentini's height is not what she claimed. I'd give her 180-182,184-185 is too much for her.Also, Freja Beha Erichsen(one of my fav) is listed 5'10 but she gives me the impression of 5'11 flat girl(i dont know why). Another claim by Sasha Pivovarova herself she said she's 5'7 I think that fits her because on the runway Frida G. towers over her.\n\nAllie said on 3/Jan/16\n\nMaryanne, Isabeli's a stunner but you're right! I'm thinking 174 maybe. She only looks a tad bit shorter than Izabel and she is around 5'9 with other models. Maryanne, what's your thoughts on Caroline Trentini? She's listed as 5'11 yet in an interview, she made a very big claim! She stated that she's actually 184-185 cm tall but her agency lies and says 5'11! I don't think she over a half inch over 5'11 though. She doesn't strike me as Karlie Kloss tall or even Ana Beatriz Barros tall tbh with other models.\n\nOn the topic of models, height isn't too much of a problem unless you're a girl whose 5'5 or 6'3 or a guy whose like 6'6 or 5'8. The measurements are what the agencies care more about, well typically for females. So if you fit the mold but you're 5'8 or 6'1 then they can let the inches slide.\n\nI've noticed though these measurements are only harsh for females. Male models seem to be much more looser. They're still trying to sell an image but it's not as strict for males as opposed to females. I think while 5'10 is preferable for female models, nowadays everyone wants their females to be 5'11. I've seen several models start off as 5'10 then magically become 5'11 overnight it seems. Even if it's clear they didn't grow.\n\nspainmen191cm said on 30/Dec/15\n\nRob, a model said to me on an online chat that the minimum height required for fashion models is 182cm in males and 172cm in females, and that there is not a limit in males but he said that he had never seen a model taller than 195cm and that could be the limit, so base on that, the range for a male model could be 6ft-6ft5, he also said that 6ft2 is considered the ideal\n\nEditor Rob\n\nyou might find it hard at over 6ft 5 to be a model so I can understand the upper limit being near 6ft 5 and the ideal being 6ft 1-2 might a common range for many of the models.\n\nFor runway I'm sure 5ft 10-11 is a preferable range for ladies.\n\nRicky said on 27/Dec/15\n\nRob,any chance bobby roache is 6ft1in range?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nnot really seen enough of him and others to tell, but if he is, he'd be another 2 inch 'adder'.\n\nRicky said on 25/Dec/15\n\nRob..how tall do you think (model bobby roache) in irrepleaceble beyonce video clip 2006?now his agency say 6ft2in.he is 17 years old on the clip.I need your comment.sory for my bad english\n\nEditor Rob\n\nhe actually claims 6ft 3 but I'm not sure if he looks that big.\n\nMaryAnne said on 20/Dec/15\n\nIsabeli Fontana and Izabel Goulart?

How short, I don't know exactly though I'm willing to bet weak 5'7 or a flat 5'7 as they list her as 5'9. Though she does look super short near the other 5'10-6'0 range models, So she could be shorter.\n\nAllie said on 14/Dec/15\n\nOn the topic of Lais, I still don't think she's over 6 ft. She's doesn't look much taller than Behati whose listed as 5'10 and 5'11, and with other models who are listed at 5'11 she doesn't look that much taller. Example here, they're all barefoot and Bheati's is on Lais's left, in the purple (I think) with white polka dots bikini, The beach picture may not be the best because I don't about the slant. But I think she may be 181 or 182 max.\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nIf you're wondering what heels they're wearing, google the British Invasion VSFS segments and the Birds Of Paradise Segments on Youtube.\n\nAlso, Monika I believe only claimed 5'11, though she could be 5'10 as that's what her agencies has her now but I believe this was when she was early in her career so she may have grown, or not, as some girls have reached their adult height by as early as 13 (Nicole Kidman did say she's been 179 cm since 13 if I remember!)\n\nMaryAnne said on 14/Dec/15\n\n@Allie thanks!!! Do you have any ideas on Anna Ewers?\n\nMaryAnne said on 13/Dec/15\n\nClick Here\n\nthe picture i mentioned\n\nAllie said on 12/Dec/15\n\nTough to say Mary, Ines and Daniela are in different stances, Ines' legs are farther apart but she's not really on her hip while Daniela looks like she's leaning on her hip and her legs looks a tad bent. Other pictures show that Daniela is leaning on her legs.\n\nThe thing is though MaryAnne, I've googled the other images, and if Stephane Seymour is the 5'9 she claims and was listed at, then I think Daniela may be 179 that got rounded up because Daniela does not look 2 solid inches taller than Stephanie. I think ines may be a legit 5'11, maybe a tad bit more like 181 but 6 ft is out of the question if you look at her with 5'10 Tyra Banks.. Daniela may be 179 but got rounded up.\n\nActually, I wouldn't be surprised if Daniela was closer like 179 cm. After all, you said Karen's old agency said she's 5'9.5 as you said, but now everywhere you go she gets listed as 5'10. It also seems to be that agencies like rounding up.\n\nMaryAnne said on 10/Dec/15\n\nRob and friends could you check out this Picture and tell your ideas?\n\nClick Here\n\nDaniela Pestova on the very left is said to be 5'11 and looks it with other models , Ines Rivero on the very right is also listed 5'11 but she looks taller than Daniela in this Picture. So, is Daniela shorter than 5'11 or is Ines taller like 183+? By the way Stephanie is 5'9 and Karen is 5'9.5 (one of her old agencies gave her this)\n\nMaryAnne said on 9/Dec/15\n\nCould you add Anna Ewers please? :)))\n\nspainmen191cm said on 6/Dec/15\n\nRob, when you say Francisco Lachowski is near 6ft 3 what height do you mean exactly in cm?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nin 190cm range\n\nAllie said on 5/Dec/15\n\nThanks Rob. :). I think I can see her being a strong 182.\n\nAnother one I've always wondered is Caroline Trentini, she once said in a interview that she's actually 6'0.5/184cm tall, but her agencies always put her down at 180. I've done some examining, and tbh she doesn't come across as almost as tall as Karlie. Nor does she give an impression of being overly tall, like okay, she's tall but almost 6'1 sounds like stretching it. I'd put her at a strong 5'11 (181) or 182, as she's taller than models who claim 5'10.5 by about an inch. No more then that.\n\nAllie said on 5/Dec/15\n\nActually, Oluchi's a tough one tbh, she's rumoured to be 6'1-2 in reality, and sometimes she looks it, but with some other models she clearly only looks 6 ft max.\n\nAllie said on 4/Dec/15\n\nRob, there's this model from Nigeria, Oluchi, she was always listed as 6 ft tall, but I don't know, she looked tall, but examining some pics of her, for some reason I feel like she's shorter, like Ana Beatriz Barros actually looks taller than her, or how Tyra Banks was close in height with her. But in other pics she looks at least 5'11-6'0 range. I just don't think Oluchi was ever a legit 6 footer. Your opinion Rob? I doubt she's under 5'11, but the 6 ft claims always seemed off/too much for me.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nfrom a quick look I can see her being near 6ft\n\nSportsHeight said on 3/Dec/15\n\nRob, doesn't it seem as if male models' neck measurements are chronically understated in order to fit industry standards? I feel like I see a lot of tall, filled-out models with similarly filled-out necks that get listed at 15/15.5\". Does that seem rather small for people above 6'0\", or is that normal?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nneck sizes is something I've not paid as much attention to. Mine is in the 15 inch range, I feel more comfortable with 15.5 inch collar though.\n\nIt would seem a strange figure to fudge though for models.\n\nspainmen191cm said on 1/Dec/15\n\nRob, the model Jon Kortajarena is nowdays in top 3 of best male models, he was also in a film with Colin Firth and he look 187-188 with him he has also been described 187 in some magazines, he is quite skinny how much do you think he weighs if he is around 6ft2?\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\ndoubt he is over 170 pounds\n\nsfs324 said on 1/Dec/15\n\nBenjamin Eidem is an interesting one. He's listed as 6'1 but is nowhere near that. Many people have commented on how short he is compared to other male models. I'd be surprised if he's anything over 178cm.\n\nspainmen191cm said on 30/Nov/15\n\nRob, what height do you think is the perfect one for modelling nowdays? For young models, men and women\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI'm not sure, but 5ft 10 and 6ft 2 might be ideal for some designers, while others may prefer slightly taller/shorter\n\nBooty said on 30/Nov/15\n\n@Rob how tall do you think Matthew Terry is, the model who starred in Calvin Klein's big Super Bowl commercial a couple years ago? He's listed by Ford as 6'1.5\", do you think he's that tall? And how much do you think he weighed in the CK commercial?\n\nOn Ellen (includes CK ad): Click Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI think he would clear over 6ft, how much I don't know exactly.\n\nAllie said on 28/Nov/15\n\n@Grizz, Ah okay then.\n\nAnyways, in this day and age, is 5'11 and 6'2-6'3 the perfect height for models? A lot of models who are already 5'9/5'10 are getting bumped up to 5'11 or close to it (females) and as for males, well I've seen several claim 6'3 and many agencies do taper out at 6'2-6'2.5 for them.\n\ngrizz said on 27/Nov/15\n\n@Allie,I've requested his height on that site numerous times along with a couple of other people,but with no luck\n\nMaryAnne said on 27/Nov/15\n\n@Allie , I think Lais is... She gives me the impression of a giant and she seems a few cms taller than Monika who might be the second tallest angels... Maria Borges who is not a VS angel was the tallest model among them this year (in my opinion)\n\nMaryAnne said on 26/Nov/15\n\nAnna Ewer's height is given somewhere like this :\n\nAnna Ewers. Height 5ft 7Â½in, bust 32in, waist 24in, hips 34in. Waist/height ratio: 0.34\n\nCliff said on 26/Nov/15\n\nWell Rob, one of the posters here on Celebheights brought this to my attention on the Emily Ratajkowski page - whom you have listed at 5ft6.\n\nShe is undoubtedly without question taller than Sara Sampaio. If the photo below is to go by, then Sara most certainly is under 5ft6 as she looks 5ft5.5 at best in this shot. Both ladies are wearing pretty much wearing the same size heel as seen clearly here. In fact, Sampaio is actually standing straighter in the photo. once we see how 5ft9-10 models tower over Sampaio, under 5ft6 is certainly possible and pretty undeniable.\n\nClick Here\n\nMaryAnne said on 26/Nov/15\n\nThere are so many models that I want to learn that what their actual height are.\n\nSuch as Anne Vyalitsyna, Anna Ewers,Anouck Lepere\n\nAllie said on 25/Nov/15\n\nWho do you guys think that s the Karlie/Karolina of the angels now? As in the tallest VS Angel out the others, as Karlie and Karolina were the tallest out all the other VS angels during their run.\n\nAlso Grizz, this is a model height general discussion. I think that should go on the height request? Also, I'd like Dominic Sherwood added. He did have to bend down a little just to kiss Taylor Swift so he'd have to be near 5'10 or above.\n\nSportsHeight said on 25/Nov/15\n\nRob, what percentage of female models do you think are 6'0\" and above, and what percentage of male models do you think are 6'3\" and above?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI actually haven't looked into that statistic much, but from general observation maybe close to 10% reach 6ft or above of 6ft 3 and over for Males.\n\nspainmen191cm said on 24/Nov/15\n\nRob, can you add the models Francisco Lachowski, or Andres Velencoso to the site?\n\nThere are a lot of female models on celebheights and only a few male models...\n\ngrizz said on 22/Nov/15\n\nSo,is this the right site to ask for Sean O'Pry's height? His 6'1 claim bugged me ever since the Blank Space music video\n\nCliff said on 22/Nov/15\n\nAgree with you Rob on Sara Sampaio. Perhaps she should be listed on here (eventually) as either a strong 5ft6 or a weak 5ft6.5. I doubt she's over this. She is pretty much the same size as Kate Moss.She kind of reminds me somewhat of Angelina Jolie, in that she appears tall when photographed alone. The only way you tell that she's average female height is when she stands next to other models.\n\nspainmen191cm said on 20/Nov/15\n\nRob,you had said that male models tend to be quite muscular but there are also quite skinny models for example how much do you think that weighs the model Francisco Lachowski? Who you said is around 6ft2-3\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\na guy near 6ft 3 like him might weigh 170 range\n\nCliff said on 19/Nov/15\n\nHey Rob, think it's time to add Sara Sampaio?\n\nI'm guessing she's 167-168m or possibly a strong 5ft6. \"Officially\" she's listed any where from 5f7.5 - 5ft8, but she's obviously under this.\n\nShe can photograph tall because she's very slim with long legs. But seeing her stand next to other models in the 5ft9-10 range, she's usually towered by them.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI'd struggle to see her sub 5ft 6, at times she can look anywhere in 5ft 6-7 range but 5ft 7-8 range seems too high\n\nAllie said on 18/Nov/15\n\nYeah I know what you mean. Sometimes if a model is a tad bit over say.. 5'9, or 176 cm tall, they get bumped up to 5'9.5 or get listed as a flat 5'9! Also, any model whose supposedly measured at 181 cm, becomes 5'11.5 or a flat 5'11. There's also imoerial or metric and most times agencies just give one measurment, either imperial or metric!\n\nI also wish they'd be more truthful as in both height and measurments. I mean, wouldn't a casting director get mad if a bunch of 5'8 girls who are all either size 0 or size 10 show up at his show even though most of their modeling cards will probably bill the models, between size 2-6 and around 5'9.5!\n\nAllie said on 18/Nov/15\n\nJust a quick question Rob, if a fashion model were to be listed as 5'11 on several agencies, but let's say two out of her.. say 5 agencies (as they get one for different capitals if I remember), list her as 5'11.5, which would you guess her real height to be? Close 6 ft (182-183) or 5'11 range (180-181)? Cause I've seen several models listed like this and although I've haven't checked what they claim on twitter or tumblr or in an interview, I'm curious to what you think would be the more likely height range if you were to guess.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nsome of the confusion might be in the way they take heights. One might be going with imperial, another metric. Or, maybe they just decide on a higher or lower listing! It's confusing...I keep hoping they got measured properly and listed at their truthful height.\n\nMaryAnne said on 17/Nov/15\n\nThank you Rob and Allie :))) I have been busy for these days but I'll join the discussions as much as possible :)) I enjoy your site Rob so much :))\n\nAllie said on 15/Nov/15\n\nYay thank you Rob! Anyways, I wouldn't guess Lais over 6'0. She's barely taller than Jac (look at the Angel Soul Cycle event) and not that much taller than Behati whose 5'10 range. Also, Jac iirc, mentioned on twitter about being 5'11 and going to concerts means being able to see so there's that."
