        "text": "It’s easy to get caught up in the hype of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. Tall, lithe, beautiful women parading around in expensive, colourful, often crystal-embellished underwear, certainly seems to garner people’s attention.\n\nThough, throughout it all, it can be difficult to imagine the models as relatable in any way. Their incredibly toned figures, smooth skin and perfectly curled tresses feel seemingly unobtainable to us mere mortals, however one fan has just noticed a trait on Lais Ribeiro that we’re sure most women can relate to.\n\nAs reported by Yahoo7 and Refinery29, an eagle-eyed fan spotted a few tiny stretch marks on Lais Ribeiro’s thigh, and the internet is rejoicing.\n\nGiven that we are so used to seeing overly photoshopped, and often unachievable standards of beauty, it’s refreshing to know that even the world’s most successful supermodels have stretch marks, just like the average woman.\n\nAs one commenter so eloquently put it, “I truly think that every natural mark or scar tells a story and makes human body even more beautiful and interesting!”\n\nAnother fan took to Twitter to say, “Lais Ribeiro has stretch marks and y’all have no idea how good it makes me feel about mine.”\n\nHere’s to body positivity and accepting ourselves just the way we are."
