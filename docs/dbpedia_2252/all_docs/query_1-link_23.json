        "text": "Nothing sculpts sexy muscle quite like boxing. Top model Lais Ribeiro shows off a few key moves from boxing hot spot Aerospace NYC. The studio is known for its tough, transformative classes—like the new boxing-inspired AeroPower. Cycle through the circuit below, featuring total-body conditioning moves from the studio, four times. Rest 30 seconds between sets.\n\nCardio Burst\n\nJump rope for 2 minutes. Use a weighted rope for an extra challenge ($25, AerospaceNYC.com).\n\nUpper-Body Burn\n\nStand with left foot forward, on ball of right foot, fists at chin.

Jump left foot as far as possible to left, pumping arms for balance as you go. Repeat to right. Continue for 2 minutes.\n\n6 Boxing Tips\n\nPunch Line: \"Orthodox position\" is the ready stance for throwing left-handed jabs. To get in it: Position left foxot forward, right heel up, hands at chin height with elbows out.\n\nCrop It: Coordination and power begin with your core, says trainer Michael Olajide Jr., cofounder of Aerospace NYC. To strengthen yours, start abs moves slowly (like, one-crunch-every-two-seconds slowly), gradually increasing speed.\n\nTime Out: A double-ended bag is connected to both the floor and ceiling. Why it rocks: It teaches you proper timing for delivering punches while improving your reflexes.\n\nStep Lively: Use a light (3- to 5-pound) weight for high reps of strength moves on non-boxing days—you'll up muscle endurance, so you can go harder and last longer in the ring.\n\nUp You Go: \"Think of your wrists as motors when you're jumping rope,\" Olajide Jr. says. \"Fast wrists mean fast jumps.\" To recruit more core muscles, flex your abs with each jump.\n\nPower Pose: To maximize the recovery intervals in a boxing workout, stay on your feet. Standing or walking during downtime helps your heart pump oxygen to muscles.\n\nAbove: To recruit more core muscles, flex your abs with each jump. Bodysuit, $325; Baja-East.com.
