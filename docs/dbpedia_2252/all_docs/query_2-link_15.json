        "text": "I really can't get behind the idea that Nicole Pollard is 184, which is shorter than me. If she say's she's 6'2 1/4\" I think she should at least be in the 186 category.\n\nI can understand because she said that on her tumblr but I just do not believe it even for a second.\n\nI've said it before, she's shorter than Karlie and if Nicole is 188.5cm (which is 6'2 1/4\") that'd make Karlie around 190.\n\nEven Jodie Kidd wasn't that tall and she's probably the tallest big runway model there ever was that I know of.\n\nBtw, these are models I had at the top of my head so can add/update as we go.\n\nCaroline Trentini is 182cm\n\nThis season's started so soon hopefully I'll see more pics and finale videos where I can better assess some more tall girls.\n\nJac is definitely around if not above the 6 foot mark, she and Karlie were the same height in the same shoes at Atelier Versace F/W 2012, she always towers over girls on the runway. Not to mention she was 5'10.5\" when she just started out at 14 so definitely logical that she grew 2.5\"-3\" inches from them to now.\n\nI know that would be wonderful and I think it sounds great however it just isn't so.\n\nIt is impossible that her and Karlie were the same height at Versace Fall 2012.\n\nThat Versace video does absolutely nothing to support that, you're looking at 2 girls facing different directions and \"walking\" past each other. That is not a good measure for comparison.\n\nKarlie and Jac standing next to each other will showcase exactly what their height difference is and I am telling you, it is not the same.\n\nTo say they're the same height is to say Jac is the same height as Frida. How many photos and videos cement the fact they are not?\n\nJac at 183 pushes Frida up to 188 pushing Marikka up to above 190.\n\nAlso, Jac is only a cm if that taller than Magdalena, if Magda is 6' then that pushes Irina K up to 186, even Irina knows she's not that tall\n\nI've met jourdan twice, im 6' and she was the same height as me so I believe her if she says she's 6'\n\nI would believe her however when I met Jourdan in 2011 and unless she's grown an inch since then in her 20s, I just can't believe that she's 6'.\n\nHer being 6' would make Toni Garrn 6'1, Karlie over 6'2\" and up and up and up we go...\n\nI'm convinced she's 181 max. Def not 183."
