        "text": "Maria Borges who was a worldwide Givenchy exclusive this season is listed as 5'11\" but honestly on the runway when she walked past Daniela Braga who is for sure 5'11\" she was at least an inch or an inch and a half taller. Same goes for Roberta Narciso also from Angola like Maria whose often listed as 5'11-5'11.5\" but there's no way she can be 5'11 and have legs like she does.\n\nMaria is 1,82m FOR SURE. I worked with her.\n\nMaria is 1,82m FOR SURE. I worked with her.\n\nAgree, Maria Borges is she's 5'11\". I'm an assistant to a photographer; we worked with her as well. (she's everything by the way. so stunning)\n\nKarlie Kloss must be 6ft or more. I once stood next to her at an event and she was towering over me (I'm 6ft myself!) and was way taller than the other girls there like Coco, Behati and was towering over male models too in her heels.\n\nKarlie is NOT 5'11\"\n\nThe supposedly 5'10.5\" (according to IMG Paris) Jac doesn't really seem half an inch taller than the 5'10 (according to Ford NY) Kremi when they walk by each other in the same shoes at 2:43. I feel like Jac was 5'10.5\" around the time she started and as a (still) growing girl, has probably hit the 5'11.5\" - 6 foot mark by now.\n\nMet Grace Mahary while I was wearing two inch heels (making me 6'3.5\" or 192 cm tall) and standing in front of her I barely even noticed much of a height difference and she was wearing flats, she's definitely 5'11 if not an inch more.\n\nGrace is tall but definitely not a 6 footer. That would put her up near Karlie territory which she most certainly isn't.\n\nA super tall model who hasn't yet been mentioned in this thread is Australian model Sarah Pauley.\n\nHere are a couple of images to showcase how tall she is.\n\nAt Toni Maticevski she was at least an inch taller than Nicole Pollard who herself is a giant.\n\nThis girl is huge.\n\nNext to 6' tall Alice Burdeau and backstage at the L'Oreal Runway 2 Instyle at LMFF 2013\n\nlucasdawson\n\nevent gallery Facebook\n\nAttachments\n\nThurley102.jpg\n\n420406_423727237724538_629902117_n.jpg\n\nI find it hard to believe Nicole Pollard is over 6'2\".\n\nIn the Fendi Fall 2013 finale she's a few centimetres shorter than Karlie so that would mean Karlie's pushing 6'3\".\n\nNot quite realistic. I think Nicole is a solid 6'1\" max as she's only about 4cm taller than Cat McNeil.\n\nI think at Fendi they all had different shoes, because on Nicole's tumblr she clearly states that she is 6'2 and 1/4 of an inch.\n\nI think at Fendi they all had different shoes, because on Nicole's tumblr she clearly states that she is 6'2 and 1/4 of an inch.\n\nThe shoes at Fendi were 'different' but the heel height was the same. She was 2 girls behind Karlie and Karlie was taller.\n\nAlso at DSquared2 Spring 2014 she was standing on the podium along from 6-foot Irina K and you'd be hard pressed to find over 2 inches of height between them. They looked exactly the same.\n\n6'2 and 1/4 inches is almost 189cm\n\nJust....no.\n\nThe shoes at Fendi were 'different' but the heel height was the same.
