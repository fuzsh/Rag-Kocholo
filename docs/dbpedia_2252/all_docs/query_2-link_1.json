And how much the different? Any clue?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nLais looks over an inch taller I'd have thought.\n\nkoshkoff said on 4/Jul/19\n\nLais is EXTREMELY TALL. Girl at my agency has worked with her, she is easily 6'0.5 if not 6'1, nearing Karlie's height.\n\nAlannah said on 20/Apr/19\n\n6ft 1/4in\n\nShe's taller than the other VS models.\n\nExpect Karlie\n\nOliver said on 21/Mar/19\n\nClick Here\n\nRob,this one may not be the best photo but how much difference do you see between Lais and Frida?\n\nThank you.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nThere's maybe 2 inch range in the photo, but yeah it's tricky because Lais might be a little further away that moment.\n\nMagda said on 17/Mar/19\n\nRob, do you think that Lais could be full 6 feet or a little taller?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI suppose it is possible, but 6ft 1? I just cannot see that high.\n\nJac said on 2/Feb/19\n\nLais with 180 cm Arlenis Sosa (at the third picture)\n\nClick Here\n\nJac said on 27/Jan/19\n\nI think she is 182-183 cm.\n\nHeight Observer said on 24/Jan/19\n\n@marg Frida is barefeet while Lais wear heels. Actually there's a picture of both of them when frida wear heals too and she towered lais tho. But I do believe that Lais is 182cm, she's definetely taller than Jourdan Dunn\n\nmarg said on 19/Nov/18\n\ni believe her 6`1 claim look at her with frida gustavsson look the same Click Here:\n\nmarg said on 19/Nov/18\n\ni believe her 6`1 claim look at her with frida gustavsson look the same\n\nSkinny_kid said on 30/Jul/18\n\n@Birch_girlie Julia Nobis is 6â0â in her bare feet like Lais Ribeiro.\n\nBirch_girlie said on 24/Mar/18\n\nLais is consistently noticeably taller than the other angels. There's a group shot they recently did and they were standing next to each other barefoot. She's taller than all of them by at least 2\". She is at least 5'11\" for sure. 6'0\" would not be a stretch.\n\nSmiles03 said on 6/Feb/18\n\nShe's 5'11\n\nAllie said on 8/Jan/18\n\nMy bad it was Elba Ramalho with Luciana and Lais.\n\nAllie said on 8/Jan/18\n\nI saw a picture of Lais with Luciana Gimenez and Juliana Paes and Luciana looked taller but yet an article tried saying Lais was 1.85 and Luciana was 1.81.\n\nAnyways I think Lais looks barely taller than Romee Strijd whose around 180-181 cm herself.\n\nAllie said on 24/Dec/17\n\nOops I meant 5'9.\n\nAllie said on 23/Dec/17\n\nLais is not 5'11. At the worst, 5'11.\n\nMistical said on 13/Dec/17\n\nI agree with Emily.She is by this math for true 1.75m, even that is generous.Only for basketball payers height cannot be faked.\n\nHeight Observer said on 3/Sep/17\n\n@Cathy I guess u can check how Lais towered the other models when they were jst announced as the new angel I guess, u can even search it at google. Also u may notice that a lot of tall models used to listed as 5\"11 with their agency like Frida Gustavsson which she even taller than Karlie Kloss, Jac Jagaciak, I believe she's just 1cm shorter than Toni Garrn, and yes so does Lais too. I think Rob is definetely correct tho, she even towered Jourdan Dunn which she claim she's 6'0.\n\n@bruh I dont think she's 6'0 tho, she's still shorter than Toni Garnn, and she got towered by Frida Gustavsson and Karlie Kloss\n\nbruh said on 21/Mar/17\n\n@Cathy she does tower over all the other VS Models what pics have you been looking at? She's like 2in taller than 5'10 adriana lima, towers over jenner, hadid, hosk, tookes, ect all 5'9' range girls. Just looking at the above pic her legs and arms are freakishly long. No way she falls under this listed height, she definitely clears 6 foot out of bed\n\nDustin said on 15/Jan/17\n\nConsidering Miranda Kerr is about 5'9\" and Lais Ribeiro is noticeably taller I'd say Lais is probably 5'11.5\" - 6'\n\nCathy said on 8/Jan/17\n\nI would guess she was 5'8 to 5'9 at the most.Judging from her proportions\n\nCathy said on 8/Jan/17\n\nI don't think she has the leg length to be 6 1. Most models are not 6'1 tall and she's not towering over anybody.You can't go by what the agency says. Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne added about 5-6 inches to their real heights.\n\nMitryriul said on 8/Jan/17\n\nAdriana Lima and Lais, the difference is giant in the video shows.\n\nClick Here\n\nAndrea said on 6/Jan/17\n\nHer boyfriend is a measured 6'7.75 guy...\n\nEmily said on 2/Jan/17\n\nWell every single picture I see her with her boyfriend Jared she looks at least 30-35 cm shorter than him and if we do the math acording Jared's height(2,08m) I give her 180 cm for tops. She may be even 178 or around.\n\nHere is a proof of my words. Lais is standing straight and Jared is not on his fully height :\n\nClick Here\n\nDon't get me wrong I adore and love Lais so so so much and till yesterday I'd say anything to prove She is 182-185 but seeing her with Jared convinced me.\n\nPlease check this picture out too.\n\nClick Here\n\nAnonymous said on 11/Dec/16\n\nIn Brazil she said she was 1.84.\n\nArch Stanton said on 13/Oct/16\n\n@Rob, crikey if she's almost 6ft how tall is her boyfriend Jared Homan? Click Here I see a 6 ft 10 listing for basketball. He might be 6 ft 9 as she has thicker soles there I think. Brazilian women really have the most beautiful skin, they always look good in skimpy clothing LOL.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nhe could look between 9-10 inches taller\n\nHeight Observer said on 16/Jun/16\n\n@ Allie, Hi Allie, i'm a big fan of lais & jac height, tbh, Jac is taller than Lais, and Romee. I think Lais 181/182 for legit while Jac is 182/183 and romee is 180cm at max.u could simply search all of their pictures together, dont forget to check tumblr to see the videos too,\n\nMathew Robinson (190 cm) said on 11/Mar/16\n\nCertainly not 6'1\" but I wonder is 6'0\" possible? Haven't seen enough on her to really say.\n\nAllie said on 23/Feb/16\n\nNo agency I've seen has her listed at anything over 180 cm/5'11. Only time she's listed taller is her claims. And the Victoria's Secret All Access Page/Meet the Angels.. well they either get the height info from their agencies or what the models claim their height.\n\nInsey said on 16/Feb/16\n\nShe's 6' at least. When a modelling agency says a girl is 5'11.5\", then that pretty much means she's 6'<.\n\nAllie said on 11/Feb/16\n\nI believe Lais is the tallest angel now. And the second tallest angel ever (after Karlie of course).\n\nAllie said on 7/Feb/16\n\nEveryone who thinks she's 6'1, this is her with the other angels, the brunette beside her is Jac, whose only 5'10-5'11 MAX. Because she's similar height to 5'10-10.5 Romee and 5'11 Kate. Lais heels look different in design though so she may have a heel advantage.\n\nClick Here\n\nHere is her again, with 5'10-11 Jac in sneakers. It might not be the best picture.\n\nClick Here\n\nAnd finally, here she is with her bf. He has a footwear advantage though. Sites may say 6'9 or 6'10 but he's actually measured at 6'7.75 without sneakers.\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nLais is just super skinny. She has long legs and a long torso. Which imo is kind of odd. But that's the way she is. That can add to the illusion. I already posted this info in the height request section, but I'm posting it here to debunk the claims of Lais being 6'1. The girl's 5'11.5 MAX. Because with the other angels who are listed as 5'10-5'10.5 or even 5'11 she barely edges them out. Even look at her with 5'10.5-11 Magda. Lais is barely taller than her. I'm not buying a full 6 ft or a little over for her unless it's in the morning.\n\nEzioAuditore711 said on 6/Feb/16\n\nJared was measured at 6'7.75 barefoot. He's NOT 6'9\".\n\nAllie said on 6/Feb/16\n\nWelp. Mystery solved. She's not 6'1. She 182 cm. she always looked too tall to be a flat 5'11. But looking st her with others mdoels 6'1 seemed to tall for her.\n\nAnd MaryAnne, I always had a feeling that she wasn't that tall.\n\nDev said on 5/Feb/16\n\nNo, she's definitely 6'1\". Have you seen her next to the other 5'10\" models. She towers over them! She needs an upgrade!\n\nKendall said on 5/Feb/16\n\nShe's definetly 6 foot but i don't buy the 6 foot 1 stuff\n\nAllie said on 3/Feb/16\n\nYay thank you Rob! When she claimed to be 6'1, I use to think she was at least 6'0.. But looking at her with her bf and other models she does look around 182 cm max. I guess if her basketball boyfriend really is 6'9' then she is 6'1 lol.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nwith her boyfriend, I think her 6ft 1 claim did seem a bit much to believe..."
