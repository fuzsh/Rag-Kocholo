        "text": "Crops are the main source of human food supply and among them, grains are more important, among cereals, corn (Zea mays L.) is an important crop due to its high grain and forage yield potential. The research experiment was conducted on maize to find out the effect of different sowing dates and plant density among three genotypes on the performance of maize, in the spring of the 2020 growing season in the Bagh-e-Zakhirah Research Farm of Takhar province Afghanistan. The experiment was laid out as a split-plot factorial in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Three planting dates (May 5, May 21, and June 5) as the main factor, three plant densities of 6.5, 8, and 10 plants/m2, and three genotypes, SC260, SC600, and SC302 were considered as sub-factors. All treatments sowing date, plant density, genotype, and only interaction effect of sowing date Ã— plant density showed significantly different effects (P< 0.01) on yield and yield components. The results of the present investigation revealed that the highest grain yield 6.99 ton/h was obtained from the sowing date (May 5) and plant density of 6.5 plants/m2 and the lowest grain yield 6.21 ton/h was obtained from the sowing date (June 5) and plant density of 10 plants/m2. In general, the results showed that the sowing on the 5th of May is superior to the 5th of June in terms of grain yield and yield components, and among the three corn genotypes, the SC260 genotype is more batter than the SC600 and SC302 genotypes under the environment condition. Therefore considering all results the first week of May as the sowing date and 65000 plants/h with SC260 genotype could be recommended to the maize grower for the most effective for producing maize.\n\nThis study was conducted during 2013-14 at Student Farm, Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Crop Production, Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (factorial) with three replications having net plot size 3x4m=(12m 2). The effect of three sowing dates 25 th October, 10 th November and 25 th November on three hybrid maize varieties Pioneer 1543, Syngenta 4841 and Monsanto DK-6142 was studied. Yield components and grain quality parameters such as plant height, number of cobs per plant, cob length, grains per cob, grain yield, protein, starch and oil content of maize varieties were significantly affected by different sowing dates. It was concluded from the finding of present research work that all quantity and quality traits were promising when the sowing was completed up to 25 th October. Further delay of the sowing had negative effects on the performance of quantity and quality of maize. Hybrid maize variety Pioneer 1543 was promising variety which gave the grain yield more than 8312 kg ha-1 .\n\nGenotypic yield potential of maize varieties is greatly affected by sowing dates. In order to investigate the effects of sowing dates and varieties on the grain yield of maize, the field experiment was carried out at research field of National Maize Research Program (NMRP), Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal from April 2009 to March 2010. Three varieties namely Rampur Composite, Arun-2 and Gaurav were sown at every week. The results of experiment showed that interaction effect of variety and sowing date on grain yield of maize was significant. Rampur Composite produced highest grain yield (6.1 t/ha) in August and lowest yield (2.6 t/ha) in May. Similarly Arun-2 produced highest yield (4.6 t/ha) in August and lowest yield (2.1 t/ha) in May. Gaurav produced highest grain yield (5.1 t/ha) in September followed by 4.9, 4.8 and 4.6 t/ha in February, July and August respectively and lowest yield (1.5 t/ha) in November. The sowing date was highly significant on grain production. The highest grain pro...\n\nA field experiment was conducted during Kharif 2012 to study the effect of different dates on yield attributes and yield of different maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids. The experiment consists of four dates of sowing (15th June, 25th June, 5th July and 15th July) in main plot and five maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids of different maturity groups namely, HQPM-1 (long), HM-4 (medium), HM-5 (long), HM-6 (early) and HM-7 (extra early) in sub plot was replicated thrice in split plot design. The 10 days advance, normal and 10 days delayed sowing from normal sowing date being at par recorded significantly higher cob length, cob girth, 100 grain weight, shelling per cent and grain yield/ha as compared to delayed sowing by 20 days from normal sowing date. Highest cob length was recorded in HM-4 (15.6 cm) followed by HQPM-1 (14.2 cm), HM-6 (13.4 cm), HM-7 (12.9 cm) and lowest in HM-5 (12.1 cm). Highest shelling per cent was recorded in HQPM-1 (67.8 %) followed by HM-6 (65.1 %), HM-4 (63.6 %), HM-7 (62.3 %) and lowest in case of HM-5 (58.5 %). Hybrid HM-5 recorded highest cob girth (4.3 cm), 100-grain weight (27.0 g), grain yield (7.64 t/ha) and highest nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium uptake in grains and straw.\n\nThis study was carried out at National Maize Research Program, Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal to evaluate the effect of sowing dates on growth and grain yield of maize inbred lines. Seven maize inbred lines namely NML-2, RML-17, RML-32, RML-4, RML-86, RML-95 and RML-96 were planted on three different dates i.e. September 02, September 12, September 22, 2015 during winter using randomized complete block design with two replications. The results of this study showed that the growth and yield traits were significantly affected by various planting dates. The inbred line RML-17 produced the highest grain yield where as NML-2 gave the lowest yield during winter season. The highest yield was obtained when inbred lines were planted on September 12 and the lowest yield on September 2. The planting from September 2 to September 12 increased the grain yield. The delay in planting i.e. September 22 decreased grain yield. Therefore September 12 planting was suitable for inbred lines to maximize grain yi...\n\nSowing dates and varieties affect the productivity of maize. A field experiment was conducted to find out the response of maize hybrids to sowing dates on growth and productivity of maize in spring season at Lamahi, Dang in 2019. The experiment was laid out in two factor factorial Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications. The treatment consisted of combination of three different sowing dates (February 1, February12 and February 23) and two maize varieties (Arun-2 i.e. OPV and hybrid Bioseed-9220).The result revealed that earlier planting on February 1 produced the highest yield (8265 Kg ha-1) which was significantly superior than latter planting of February 12(6099 kg ha-1)and February 23 (5934 kg ha-1).The higher yield in earlier planting was due to significantly higher no of kernel per ear, non-significant but higher number of cob per unit area, thousand grain weight. Similarly, Bioseed 9220 produced higher yield (7798 kg ha-1) compared to Arun-2 (5,734 kg ha-1). Th..."
