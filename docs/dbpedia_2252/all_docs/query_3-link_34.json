        "text": "Manipulating the transmission through valve structure composed of zero-index metamaterial\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Yongxing; Sun, Zhouzhou; Xu, Ping\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe propose a valve structure composed of zero-index metamaterial to manipulate the electromagnetic wave conveniently and effectively through regulating the phase of reflected waves. Both the structure and characteristics of zero-index metamaterial need not to be changed when manipulating the transmission, which maintains the stability of zero-index metamaterial. Moreover, the good performance of tuning the electromagnetic wave is not limited by the shape and size of our proposed structure. By using our proposed valve structure, we demonstrate the realization of the tunable curved anisotropic É-near-zero material waveguide with irregular shape, arbitrarily sized isotropic É-near-zero material waveguide with high transmittance and the curved isotropic impedance matched É-near-zero material waveguide without polarization limitations.\n\nHemodynamics of Pericardial Aortic Valves: Contemporary Stented versus Stentless Valves in a Matched Comparison\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHolinski, Sebastian; Zhigalov, Konstantin; Zielinski, Christina Barbara; Grubitzsch, Herko\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose: Hemodynamic performance of aortic valve bioprostheses is essential for reliable function and durability. So far, the supra-annularly implanted stentless Sorin Freedom Solo (SFS) demonstrated unsurpassed hemodynamic properties. As contemporary stented and externally mounted pericardial bioprostheses, like the Labcor Dokimos Plus (LDP), also improve hemodynamic performance, these types of valves were compared in this study. Methods: A total of 218 patients, who underwent aortic valve replacement with the LDP or the SFS, were matched retrospectively 1:1 on variables affecting hemodynamic measurements: implanted valve size, age, sex, and body surface area (BSA). With matching tolerance for valve size and gender of 0%, for age and BSA of 5%, 57 patient-pairs were yielded. Operative data, clinical, and hemodynamic outcome were analyzed. Results: Except for slightly higher left ventricular function and lower procedural times in the SFS group, preoperative, operative, and postoperative characteristics of patient-pairs did not differ significantly. Mean pressure gradients, effective orifice areas (EOAs), and indexed EOAs were comparable. Corresponding to valve sizes of 21, 23, 25, and 27 mm, the indexed EOAs of the LDP and SFS prostheses were 1.08 Â± 0.33, 0.92 Â± 0.19, 0.93 Â± 0.24, 0.99 Â± 0.13 cm2/m2 and 0.81 Â± 0.13, 0.92 Â± 0.28, 0.95 Â± 0.20, 1.04 Â± 0.27 cm2/m2, respectively. Conclusion: Contemporary stented and stentless pericardial bioprostheses showed excellent hemodynamic properties without significant differences in EOAs and indexed EOAs.

Prospective study. 6 MVD-affected dogs with no clinical signs and 67 dogs with MVD of differing severity (International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council [ISACHC] classification). The 6 dogs were used to determine the repeatability and reproducibility of the PISA method, and RF was then assessed in 67 dogs of various ISACHC classes. Mitral valve regurgitation was also assessed from the maximum area of regurgitant jet signal-to-left atrium area (ARJ/LAA) ratio determined via color Doppler echocardiographic mapping. Within- and between-day coefficients of variation of RF were 8% and 11%, respectively. Regurgitation fraction was significantly correlated with ISACHC classification and heart murmur grade and was higher in ISACHC class III dogs (mean +/- SD, 72.8 +/- 9.5%) than class II (57.9 +/- 20.1%) or I (40.7 +/- 19.2%) dogs. Regurgitation fraction and left atriumto-aorta ratio, fractional shortening, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, and ARJ/LAA ratio were significantly correlated. Results suggested that RF is a repeatable and reproducible variable for noninvasive quantitative evaluation of mitral valve regurgitation in awake dogs. Regurgitation fraction also correlated well with disease severity. It appears that this Doppler echocardiographic index may be useful in longitudinal studies of MVD in dogs.\n\nComparison of valvular resistance, stroke work loss, and Gorlin valve area for quantification of aortic stenosis. An in vitro study in a pulsatile aortic flow model.\n\nPubMed\n\nVoelker, W; Reul, H; Nienhaus, G; Stelzer, T; Schmitz, B; Steegers, A; Karsch, K R\n\n1995-02-15\n\nValvular resistance and stroke work loss have been proposed as alternative measures of stenotic valvular lesions that may be less flow dependent and, thus, superior over valve area calculations for the quantification of aortic stenosis. The present in vitro study was designed to compare the impacts of valvular resistance, stroke work loss, and Gorlin valve area as hemodynamic indexes of aortic stenosis. In a pulsatile aortic flow model, rigid stenotic orifices in varying sizes (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 cm2) and geometry were studied under different hemodynamic conditions. Ventricular and aortic pressures were measured to determine the mean systolic ventricular pressure (LVSPm) and the transstenotic pressure gradient (delta Pm). Transvalvular flow (Fm) was assessed with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Valvular resistance [VR = 1333.(delta Pm/Fm)] and stroke work loss [SWL = 100.(delta Pm/LVSPm)] were calculated and compared with aortic valve area [AVA = Fm/(50 square root of delta Pm)]. The measurements were performed for a large range of transvalvular flows. At low-flow states, flow augmentation (100-->200 mL/s) increased calculated valvular resistance between 21% (2.0 cm2 orifice) and 66% (0.5-cm2 orifice). Stroke work loss demonstrated an increase from 43% (2.0 cm2) to 100% (1.0 cm2). In contrast, Gorlin valve area revealed only a moderate change from 29% (2.0 cm2) to 5% (0.5 cm2). At physiological flow rates, increase in transvalvular flow (200-->300 mL/s) did not alter calculated Gorlin valve area, whereas valvular resistance and stroke work loss demonstrated a continuing increase. Our experimental results were adopted to interpret the results of three clinical studies in aortic stenosis. The flow-dependent increase of Gorlin valve area, which was found in the cited clinical studies, can be elucidated as true further opening of the stenotic valve but not as a calculation error due to the Gorlin formula. Within the physiological range of flow, calculated aortic valve\n\nRelationship of aortic annular eccentricity and paravalvular regurgitation post transcatheter aortic valve implantation with CoreValve.\n\nPubMed\n\nWong, Dennis T L; Bertaso, Angela G; Liew, Gary Y H; Thomson, Viji S; Cunnington, Michael S; Richardson, James D; Gooley, Robert; Lockwood, Siobhan; Meredith, Ian T; Worthley, Matthew I; Worthley, Stephen G\n\n2013-04-01\n\nSignificant paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PAR) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with negative clinical consequences. We hypothesize that increased eccentricity of the aortic annulus is associated with greater PAR. Patients with severe aortic stenosis underwent multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) before successful TAVI with the Medtronic CoreValve bioprosthesis. The smallest (D(min)) and largest (D(max)) orthogonal diameters in the basal ring of the aortic annulus were determined. We defined circularity of aortic annulus using the eccentricity index (1 - D(min)/D(max)). The primary endpoint was early occurrence of significant PAR, defined as > grade II PAR by postprocedural aortography. Eighty-four patients, mean age 83 Â± 4 years with a mean aortic valve area of 0.7 Â± 0.2 cmÂ² were included. Twenty patients had postprocedural PAR > grade II. Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, eccentricity index correlated with significant PAR (AUC = 0.834; P=.034). A retrospectively determined eccentricity index cut-off of >0.25 was related to significant PAR with a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 86%, and negative predictive value of 95% (P<.001). On univariate logistic regression, eccentricity index of >0.25 (P<.001) and device implantation depth (P=.015) correlated with significant PAR, while other parameters such as annular calcification and cover index did not. On multivariate analysis including only parameters with P<.1 on univariate analysis, eccentricity index >0.25 was the sole independent predictor of significant PAR. Eccentricity index is related to significant PAR after TAVI with Medtronic CoreValve. Further larger studies are required to determine the utility of this novel index in screening suitable patients for this procedure.\n\nDe Vega Annuloplasty for Functional Tricupsid Regurgitation: Concept of Tricuspid Valve Orifice Index to Optimize Tricuspid Valve Annular Reduction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHwang, Ho Young; Chang, Hyoung Woo; Jeong, Dong Seop\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe evaluated long-term results of De Vega annuloplasty measured by cylindrical sizers for functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) and analyzed the impact of measured annular size on the late recurrence of tricuspid valve regurgitation. Between 2001 and 2011, 177 patients (57.9Â±10.5 yr) underwent De Vega annuloplasty for FTR. Three cylindrical sizers (actual diameters of 29.5, 31.5, and 33.5 mm) were used to reproducibly reduce the tricuspid annulus. Long-term outcomes were evaluated and risk factor analyses for the recurrence of FTR â¥3+ were performed. Measured annular diameter indexed by patient's body surface area was included in the analyses as a possible risk factor. Operative mortality occurred in 8 patients (4.5%). Ten-year overall and cardiac death-free survivals were 80.5% and 90.8%, respectively. Five and 10-yr freedom rates from recurrent FTR were 96.5% and 93.1%, respectively. Cox proportional hazard model revealed that higher indexed annular size was the only risk factor for the recurrence of FTR (P=0.006). A minimal P value approach demonstrated that indexed annular diameter of 22.5 mm/m2 was a cut-off value predicting the recurrence of FTR. De Vega annuloplasty for FTR results in low rates of recurrent FTR in the long-term. Tricuspid annulus should be reduced appropriately considering patients' body size to prevent recurrent FTR.

Bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF) using a high-pressure balloon can be performed to facilitate VIV TAVR. We report data from 20 consecutive clinical cases in which BVF was successfully performed before or after VIV TAVR by inflation of a high-pressure balloon positioned across the valve ring during rapid ventricular pacing. Hemodynamic measurements and calculation of the valve effective orifice area were performed at baseline, immediately after VIV TAVR, and after BVF. BVF was successfully performed in 20 patients undergoing VIV TAVR with balloon-expandable (n=8) or self-expanding (n=12) transcatheter valves in Mitroflow, Carpentier-Edwards Perimount, Magna and Magna Ease, Biocor Epic and Biocor Epic Supra, and Mosaic surgical valves. Successful fracture was noted fluoroscopically when the waist of the balloon released and by a sudden drop in inflation pressure, often accompanied by an audible snap. BVF resulted in a reduction in the mean transvalvular gradient (from 20.5Â±7.4 to 6.7Â±3.7 mmâHg, P <0.001) and an increase in valve effective orifice area (from 1.0Â±0.4 to 1.8Â±0.6 cm 2 , P <0.001). No procedural complications were reported. BVF can be performed safely in small surgical valves to facilitate VIV TAVR with either balloon-expandable or self-expanding transcatheter valves and results in reduced residual transvalvular gradients and increased valve effective orifice area.

The study aim was to investigate the effects of chronic rheumatic valve disease on the diameters of the descending aorta (DA) and inferior vena cava (IVC). METHODS: A total of 88 patients with echocardiographically documented rheumatic valvular heart disease and 112 healthy controls were enrolled into the study. All patients underwent detailed echocardiographic examinations, while their height and body weight were recorded and adjusted to their body surface area. RESULTS: The most common involvement was mitral valve disease, followed by aortic valve disease and tricuspid valve disease. The mean diameter of the DA (indexed to BSA) was 1.79 Â± 0.49 cm for patients and 1.53 Â± 0.41 for controls (p <0.001). The mean diameter of the IVC (indexed to BSA) was 1.69 Â± 0.73 for patients and 1.38 Â± 0.35 cm for controls (p <0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between mitral valve mean gradient and IVC diameter (p = 0.01, r = 0.18). There were also strong associations between the mitral valve area and the diameters of the DA (p = 0.001, r = -0.239) and IVC (p <0.001, r = -0.246). CONCLUSION: Rheumatic valve disease, especially mitral stenosis, was closely related to remodeling of the great vessels.\n\nEffects of tranexamic acid on coagulation indexes of patients undergoing heart valve replacement surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Fei; Xu, Dong; Zhang, Kefeng; Zhang, Jian\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study aims to explore the effects of tranexamic acid on the coagulation indexes of patients undergoing heart valve replacement surgery under the condition of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). One hundred patients who conformed to the inclusive criteria were selected and divided into a tranexamic acid group and a non-tranexamic acid group. They all underwent heart valve replacement surgery under CPB. Patients in the tranexamic acid group were intravenously injected with 1 g of tranexamic acid (100 mL) at the time point after anesthesia induction and before skin incision and at the time point after the neutralization of heparin. Patients in the non-tranexamic acid group were given 100 mL of normal saline at corresponding time points, respectively. Then the coagulation indexes of the two groups were analyzed. The activated blood clotting time (ACT) of the two groups was within normal scope before CPB, while four coagulation indexes including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR), and fibrinogen (FIB) had significant increases after surgery; the PT and INR of the tranexamic acid group had a remarkable decline after surgery. All the findings suggest that the application of tranexamic acid in heart valve replacement surgery under CPB can effectively reduce intraoperative and postoperative blood loss.

However, to our knowledge, the durability of these prostheses is incompletely defined. To determine the midterm hemodynamic performance of balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valves. In this study, we analyzed core laboratory-generated data from echocardiograms of all patients enrolled in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) 1 Trial with successful TAVR or surgical AVR (SAVR) obtained preimplantation and at 7 days, 1 and 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years postimplantation. Patients from continued access observational studies were included for comparison. Successful implantation after randomization to TAVR vs SAVR (PARTNER 1A; TAVR, nâ=â321; SAVR, nâ=â313), TAVR vs medical treatment (PARTNER 1B; TAVR, nâ=â165), and continued access (TAVR, nâ=â1996). Five-year echocardiogram data were available for 424 patients after TAVR and 49 after SAVR. Death or reintervention for aortic valve structural indications, measured using aortic valve mean gradient, effective orifice area, Doppler velocity index, and evidence of hemodynamic deterioration by reintervention, adverse hemodynamics, or transvalvular regurgitation. Of 2795 included patients, the mean (SD) age was 84.5 (7.1) years, and 1313 (47.0%) were female. Population hemodynamic trends derived from nonlinear mixed-effects models showed small early favorable changes in the first few months post-TAVR, with a decrease of -2.9 mm Hg in aortic valve mean gradient, an increase of 0.028 in Doppler velocity index, and an increase of 0.09 cm2 in effective orifice area. There was relative stability at a median follow-up of 3.1 (maximum, 5) years. Moderate/severe transvalvular regurgitation was noted in 89 patients (3.7%) after TAVR and increased over time. Patients with SAVR showed no significant changes. In TAVR, death/reintervention was associated with lower ejection fraction, stroke volume\n\nAortic annulus and root characteristics in severe aortic stenosis due to bicuspid aortic valve and tricuspid aortic valves: implications for transcatheter aortic valve therapies.\n\nPubMed\n\nPhilip, Femi; Faza, Nadine Nadar; Schoenhagen, Paul; Desai, Milind Y; Tuzcu, E Murat; Svensson, Lars G; Kapadia, Samir R\n\n2015-08-01\n\nPatients with severe aortic stenosis due to BAV are excluded from transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to concern for asymmetric expansion and valve dysfunction. We sought to characterize the aortic root and annulus in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and tricuspid aortic valves (TAV). We identified patients with severe AS who underwent multi-detector computed tomographic (MDCT) imaging prior to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR, nâ=â200) for BAV and TAVR (nâ=â200) for TAV from 2010 to 2013. The presence of a BAV was confirmed on surgical and pathological review. Annulus measurements of the basal ring (short- and long-axis, area-derived diameter), coronary ostia height, sinus area (SA), sino-tubular junction area (STJ), calcification and eccentricity index (EI, 1-short axis/long axis) were made. Patients with TAV were older (78.8 years vs. 57.8 years, Pâ=â0.04) than those with BAV. The aortic annulus area (5.21âÂ±â2.1 cm(2) vs. 4.63âÂ±â2.0 cm(2) , Pâ=â0.0001), sinus of Valsalva diameter (3.7âÂ±â0.9 cm vs. 3.1âÂ±â0.1 cm, Pâ=â0.001) and ascending aorta diameter (3.5âÂ±â0.7 cm vs. 2.97âÂ±â0.6 cm, Pâ=â0.001) were significantly larger with BAV. Bicuspid aortic annuli were significantly less elliptical (EI, 1.24âÂ±â0.1 vs. 1.29âÂ±â0.1, Pâ=â0.006) and more circular (39% vs. 4%, Pâ<â0.001) compared to the TAV annulus. There was more eccentric annular calcification in BAV vs. TAV (68% vs. 32%, Pâ<â0.001). The mean distance from the aortic annulus to the left main coronary ostium was less than the right coronary ostium. Less than 10% of the BAV annuli would not fit a currently available valved stents. Bicuspid aortic valves have a larger annulus size, sinus of Valsalva and ascending aorta dimensions. In addition, the BAV aortic annuli appear circular and most will fit currently available commercial valved stents.

Y.; Wong, J.; Rodriguez, L.; Pu, M.; Vandervoort, P. M.; Thomas, J. D.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: The effective orifice area (EOA) of a prosthetic valve is superior to transvalvular gradients as a measure of valve function, but measurement of mitral prosthesis EOA has not been reliable. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro flow across St Jude valves was calculated by hemispheric proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) and segment-of-spheroid (SOS) methods. For steady and pulsatile conditions, PISA and SOS flows correlated with true flow, but SOS and not PISA underestimated flow. These principles were then used intraoperatively to calculate cardiac output and EOA of newly implanted St Jude mitral valves in 36 patients. Cardiac output by PISA agreed closely with thermodilution (r=0.91, Delta=-0.05+/-0.55 L/min), but SOS underestimated it (r=0.82, Delta=-1.33+/-0.73 L/min). Doppler EOAs correlated with Gorlin equation estimates (r=0.75 for PISA and r=0.68 for SOS, P<0.001) but were smaller than corresponding in vitro EOA estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Proximal flow convergence methods can calculate forward flow and estimate EOA of St Jude mitral valves, which may improve noninvasive assessment of prosthetic mitral valve obstruction.\n\nIntraoperative assessment of mitral valve area after mitral valve repair: comparison of different methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaslow, Andrew; Gemignani, Anthony; Singh, Arun; Mahmood, Feroze; Poppas, Athena\n\n2011-04-01\n\nIn the present study, 3 different methods to measure the mitral valve area (MVA) after mitral valve repair (MVRep) were studied. Data obtained immediately after repair were compared with postoperative data. The objective was to determine the feasibility and correlation between intraoperative and postoperative MVA data. A prospective study. A tertiary care medical center. Twenty-five elective adult surgical patients scheduled for MVRep. Echocardiographic data included MVAs obtained using the pressure half-time (PHT), 2-dimensional planimetry (2D-PLAN), and the continuity equation (CE). These data were obtained immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass and were compared with data obtained before hospital discharge (transthoracic echocardiogram 1) and 6 to 12 months after surgery (transthoracic echocardiogram 2). Intraoperative care was guided by hemodynamic goals designed to optimize cardiac function. The data show good agreement and correlation between MVA obtained with PHT and 2D-PLAN within and between each time period. MVA data obtained with the CE in the postoperative period were lower than and did not correlate or agree as well with other MVA data. The MVA recorded immediately after valve repair, using PHT, correlated and agreed with MVA data obtained in the postoperative period. These results contrast with previously published data and could highlight the impact of hemodynamic function during the assessment of MVA. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A dynamic, finite element model with time varying pressure was used in this study. Shell elements with linear elastic properties for the leaflet and root were used. Two different cases were analyzed: (1) normal leaflets inside a compliant root, and (2) normal leaflets inside a stiff root. A compliant aortic root contributes substantially to the smooth and symmetrical leaflet opening with minimal gradients. In contrast, the leaflet opening inside a stiff root is delayed, asymmetric, and wrinkled. However, this wrinkling is not associated with increased leaflet stresses. In compliant roots, the effective valve orifice area can substantially increase because of increased root pressure and transvalvular gradients. In stiff roots this effect is strikingly absent. A compliant aortic root contributes substantially to smooth and symmetrical leaflet opening with minimal gradients. The compliance also contributes much to the ability of the normal aortic valve to increase its effective valve orifice in response to physiologic demands of exercise. This effect is strikingly absent in stiff roots.\n\nSex differences in aortic valve calcification measured by multidetector computed tomography in aortic stenosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAggarwal, Shivani R; Clavel, Marie-Annick; Messika-Zeitoun, David; Cueff, Caroline; Malouf, Joseph; Araoz, Philip A; Mankad, Rekha; Michelena, Hector; Vahanian, Alec; Enriquez-Sarano, Maurice\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAortic valve calcification (AVC) is the intrinsic mechanism of valvular obstruction leading to aortic stenosis (AS) and is measurable by multidetector computed tomography. The link between sex and AS is controversial and that with AVC is unknown. We prospectively performed multidetector computed tomography in 665 patients with AS (aortic valve area, 1.05Â±0.35 cm(2); mean gradient, 39Â±19 mm Hg) to measure AVC and to assess the impact of sex on the AVC-AS severity link in men and women. AS severity was comparable between women and men (peak aortic jet velocity: 4.05Â±0.99 versus 3.93Â±0.91 m/s, P=0.11; aortic valve area index: 0.55Â±0.20 versus 0.56Â±0.18 cm(2)/m(2); P=0.46). Conversely, AVC load was lower in women versus men (1703Â±1321 versus 2694Â±1628 arbitrary units; P<0.0001) even after adjustment for their smaller body surface area or aortic annular area (both P<0.0001). Thus, odds of high-AVC load were much greater in men than in women (odds ratio, 5.07; P<0.0001). Although AVC showed good associations with hemodynamic AS severity in men and women (all r>0.67; P<0.0001), for any level of AS severity measured by peak aortic jet velocity or aortic valve area index, AVC load, absolute or indexed, was higher in men versus women (all Pâ¤0.01). In this large AS population, women incurred similar AS severity than men for lower AVC loads, even after indexing for their smaller body size. Hence, the relationship between valvular calcification process and AS severity differs in women and men, warranting further pathophysiological inquiry. For AS severity diagnostic purposes, interpretation of AVC load should be different in men and in women.\n\nAssociation of body mass index and visceral fat with aortic valve calcification and mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: the obesity paradox in severe aortic stenosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMancio, Jennifer; Fonseca, Paulo; Figueiredo, Bruno; Ferreira, Wilson; Carvalho, Monica; Ferreira, Nuno; Braga, Pedro; Rodrigues, Alberto; Barros, Antonio; Falcao-Pires, Ines; Leite-Moreira, Adelino; Ribeiro, Vasco Gama; Bettencourt, Nuno\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPrevious studies showed that metabolic syndrome is associated with aortic valve calcification (AVC) and poor outcomes in aortic stenosis (AS). However, if these associations change and how body fat impacts the prognosis of patients in late stage of the disease have been not yet explored. To determine the association of body mass index (BMI) and visceral fat with AVC and mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This was a prospective cohort of 170 severe AS patients referred to TAVR. We quantified AVC mass score and fat depots including epicardial adipose tissue, intrathoracic fat, and abdominal visceral (VAF) and subcutaneous fats by computed tomography. Fat depots were indexed to body surface area. All-cause and cardiovascular-related deaths after TAVR were recorded over a median follow-up of 1.2Â years. Higher AVC mass was independently associated with low BMI and low VAF. All-cause mortality risk increased with the decrease of BMI and increment of VAF. A stratified analysis by obesity showed that in non-obese, VAF was inversely associated with mortality, whereas in obese, high VAF was associated with higher mortality (p value for interactionÂ <Â 0.05). At long-term, hazard ratio [HR] with non-obese/low VAF was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-4.9; pÂ =Â 0.021) and HR with obese/high VAF was 2.5 (95% CI 1.1-5.8; pÂ =Â 0.031) compared with obese/low VAF patients. In AS patients submitted to TAVR, BMI and VAF were inversely associated with AVC. Pre-intervention assessment of VAF by computed tomography may provide a better discrimination of mortality than BMI alone.\n\nBioprosthetic Valve Fracture During Valve-in-valve TAVR: Bench to Bedside\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaxon, John T; Allen, Keith B; Cohen, David J\n\n2018-01-01\n\nValve-in-valve (VIV) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been established as a safe and effective means of treating failed surgical bioprosthetic valves (BPVs) in patients at high risk for complications related to reoperation. Patients who undergo VIV TAVR are at risk of patientâprosthesis mismatch, as the transcatheter heart valve (THV) is implanted within the ring of the existing BPV, limiting full expansion and reducing the maximum achievable effective orifice area of the THV. Importantly, patientâprosthesis mismatch and high residual transvalvular gradients are associated with reduced survival following VIV TAVR. Bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF) is as a novel technique to address this problem. During BPV, a non-compliant valvuloplasty balloon is positioned within the BPV frame, and a highpressure balloon inflation is performed to fracture the surgical sewing ring of the BPV. This allows for further expansion of the BPV as well as the implanted THV, thus increasing the maximum effective orifice area that can be achieved after VIV TAVR. This review focuses on the current evidence base for BVF to facilitate VIV TAVR, including initial bench testing, procedural technique, clinical experience and future directions.

We studied 969 consecutive bicuspid aortic valve patients (50Â±13 years; 87% men) with proximal aorta â¥4 cm, who also had a gated contrast-enhanced thoracic computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography. A ratio of ascending aortic area/height was calculated on tomography, and â¥10 cm 2 /m was considered abnormal, as previously reported. Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and cardiovascular death were recorded. Greater than or equal to III+ aortic regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis were seen in 37% and 10%, respectively. Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and right ventricular systolic pressure were 2Â±3 and 15Â±16 mm Hg, respectively. Abnormal ascending aortic area/height ratio was noted in 33%; 44% underwent ascending aortic surgery at 34 days. At 10.8 years (interquartile range, 9.6-12.3), 82 (9%) died (0.4% in-hospital postoperative mortality). On multivariable Cox survival analysis, ascending aortic area/height ratio (hazard ratio, 2; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.35) was associated with cardiovascular death, whereas aortic surgery (hazard ratio, 0.46; confidence interval, 0.26-0.80) was associated with improved survival (both P <0.01). Of the 405 patients with ascending aortic diameter of 4.5 to 5.5 cm, 64% had an abnormal ascending aortic area/height ratio, and 70% deaths occurred in patients with an abnormal ratio. In bicuspid aortic valve patients with dilated proximal ascending aorta, ascending aortic area/height ratio was independently associated with cardiovascular death.

The impact of AVC in different locations within the aortic valve complex is incompletely understood. This study analyzed 150 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR. Total AVC volume scores were calculated from contrast-enhanced multidetector row computed tomography imaging. AVC was divided by leaflet sector and region (Leaflet, Annulus, left ventricular outflow tract [LVOT]), and a combination of LVOT and Annulus (AnnulusLVOT). Asymmetry was assessed. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed with greater than or equal to mild PVR and PD as classification variables. Logistic regression was performed. Quantity of and asymmetry of AVC for all regions of the aortic valve complex predicted greater than or equal to mild PVR by receiver-operating characteristic analysis (area under the curve = 0.635 to 0.689), except Leaflet asymmetry. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis for PD was significant for quantity and asymmetry of AVC in all regions, with higher area under the curve values than for PVR (area under the curve = 0.648 to 0.741). On multivariable analysis, Leaflet and AnnulusLVOT calcification were independent predictors of both PVR and PD regardless of multidetector row computed tomography area cover index. Quantity and asymmetry of AVC in all regions of the aortic valve complex predict greater than or equal to mild PVR and performance of PD, with the exception of Leaflet asymmetry. Quantity of AnnulusLVOT and Leaflet calcification independently predict PVR and PD when taking into account multidetector row computed tomography area cover index.

This leads to a formula consistent with Newton's second law of motion. The form of the new equation is A = (7.5 X 10(-5)) SV FH2/Pd, where A, VS, FH and Pd are expressed in cm2, ml, s-1 and mmHg, respectively. Aortic valve areas computed with the new orifice equation are found to correlate with those computed by the Gorlin formula in conditions of resting haemodynamic states at a level of r = 0.86, SE = 0.25 cm2, N = 120. The results suggest that the new formula may be considered as an independent orifice equation having a similar domain of validity as the Gorlin formula. The new equation offers the possibility of deriving additional useful haemodynamic relationships through combination with established cardiological formulas and applying it in a noninvasive Doppler ultrasonic or echocardiographic context.\n\nCheck valve installation in pilot operated relief valve prevents reverse pressurization\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOswalt, L.\n\n1966-01-01\n\nTwo check valves prevent reverse flow through pilot-operated relief valves of differential area piston design.

The aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamic performance of the Portico and balloon-expandable SAPIEN XT valves in a case-matched study with echocardiographic core laboratory analysis. Twenty-two patients underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation with the Portico 23-mm valve and were matched for aortic annulus area and mean diameter measured by multidetector computed tomography, left ventricular ejection fraction, body surface area, and body mass index with 40 patients treated with the 23-mm SAPIEN XT. Mean aortic annulus diameters were 19.6Â±1.3mm by transthoracic echocardiography and 21.4Â±1.2mm by computed tomography, with no significant between-group differences. Doppler echocardiographic images were collected at baseline and at 1-month of follow-up and were analyzed in a central echocardiography core laboratory. There were no significant between-group differences in residual mean transaortic gradients (SAPIEN XT: 10.4Â±3.7mmHg; Portico: 9.8Â±1.1mmHg; P=.49) and effective orifice areas (SAPIEN XT: 1.36Â±0.27cm(2); Portico, 1.37Â±.29cm(2); P=.54). Rates of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (effective orifice area<0.65cm(2)/m(2)) were similar (SAPIEN XT: 13.5%; Portico: 10.0%; P=.56). No between-group differences were found in the occurrence of moderate-severe paravalvular leaks (5.0% vs 4.8% of SAPIEN XT and Portico respectively; P=.90). Transcatheter aortic valve implantation with the self-expanding Portico system yielded similar short-term hemodynamic performance compared with the balloon-expandable SAPIEN XT system for treating patients with severe aortic stenosis and small annuli. Further prospective studies with longer-term follow-up and in patients with larger aortic annuli are required.

The benefit of aortic valve replacement (AVR) among NFLG patients is controversial. We compared the impact of NFLG condition on preoperative left ventricular (LV) remodeling and myocardial fibrosis and postoperative remodeling and symptomatic benefit. Eighty-seven consecutive patients with reduced aortic valve area and normal stroke volume index undergoing AVR underwent echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, a 6-minute walk test, and measurement of natriuretic peptides before and 1 year after AVR. Myocardial fibrosis was assessed from magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were stratified as NFLG or normal-flow high-gradient. In total, 33 patients (38%) had NFLG. Before AVR, they were characterized by similar symptom burden but less severe AS measured by aortic valve area index (0.50Â±0.09 versus 0.40Â±0.08 cm 2 /m 2 ; P <0.0001), lower LV mass index (74Â±18 versus 90Â±26 g/m 2 ; P =0.01), but the same degree of myocardial fibrosis. After AVR, NFLG had a smaller reduction in LV mass index (-3Â±10 versus -Â±18 g/m 2 ; P <0.0001) and a smaller reduction in natriuretic peptides. Both groups experienced similar symptomatic improvement. Normal-flow high-gradient condition independently predicted change in LV mass index. Patients with NFLG had less severe AS and LV remodeling than patients with normal-flow high-gradient. Furthermore, NFLG patients experienced less reverse remodeling but the same symptomatic benefit.

The long-term performance of the SAPIEN TAVR is not well-described. Therefore, we examined the hemodynamic and valvular profile of the SAPIEN TAVR over 5 years. All patients receiving TAVR or SAVR with first post-implant (FPI) and 5-year echoes were analyzed for aortic valve (AV) peak velocity, AV mean gradient, AV area, peak left ventricular (LV) outflow tract and in-stent velocities, Doppler velocity index, aortic regurgitation (AR), LV mass index, stroke volume index, and cardiac index. The FPI and 5-year data were compared using a paired t test or McNemar's analyses. There were 86 TAVR and 48 SAVR patients with paired FPI and 5-year echocardiograms. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The AV area did not change significantly 5 years after TAVR (pÂ = 0.35). The AV mean gradient also remained stable: 11.5 Â± 5.4 mmÂ Hg at FPI to 11.0 Â± 6.3 mmÂ Hg at 5 years (pÂ = 0.41). In contrast, the peak AV and LV outflow tract velocities decreased (pÂ = 0.03 and pÂ = 0.008, respectively), as did in-stent velocity (pÂ =Â 0.015). Correspondingly, the TAVR Doppler velocity index was unchanged (pÂ = 0.07). Among TAVR patients, there was no change in total AR (pÂ = 0.40), transvalvular AR (pÂ = 0.37), or paravalvular AR (pÂ = 0.26). Stroke volume index and cardiac index remained stable (pÂ = 0.16 and pÂ = 0.25, respectively). However, there was a significant regression of LV mass index (pÂ < 0.0001). The longitudinal evaluation among SAVR patients revealed similar trends. There was a low rate of adverse events among TAVR and SAVR patients alive at 5 years. Longitudinal assessment of the PARTNER I trial (THE PARTNER TRIAL: Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER Valve Trial) demonstrates that valve performance and cardiac hemodynamics are stable after implantation\n\nLow Transvalvular Flow Rate PredictsÂ Mortality in Patients With Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis Following Aortic Valve Intervention.\n\nPubMed\n\nVamvakidou, Anastasia; Jin, Wenying; Danylenko, Oleksandr; Chahal, Navtej; Khattar, Rajdeep; Senior, Roxy\n\n2018-03-09\n\nThis study aimed to assess the value of low transvalvular flow rate (FR) for the prediction of mortality compared with low stroke volume index (SVi) in patients with low-gradient (mean gradient:Â <40 mmÂ Hg), low aortic valve area (<1 cm 2 ) aortic stenosis (AS) following aortic valve intervention. Transaortic FR defined as stroke volume/left ventricular ejection time is also a marker of flow; however, no data exist comparing the relative prognostic value of these 2 transvalvular flow markers in patients with low-gradient AS who had undergone valve intervention. We retrospectively followed prospectively assessed consecutive patients with low-gradient, low aortic valve area AS who underwent aortic valve intervention between 2010 and 2014 for all-cause mortality. Of the 218 patients with mean age 75 Â± 12 years, 102 (46.8%) had low stroke volume index (SVi) (<35 ml/m 2 ), 95 (43.6%) had low FR (<200 ml/s), and 58 (26.6%) had low left ventricular ejection fractionÂ <50%. The concordance between FR and SVi was 78.8% (pÂ < 0.005). Over a median follow-up of 46.8 Â± 21 months, 52 (23.9%) deaths occurred. Patients with low FR had significantly worse outcome compared with those with normal FR (pÂ < 0.005). In patients with low SVi, a low FR conferred a worse outcome than a normal FR (pÂ = 0.005), but FR status did not discriminate outcome in patients with normal SVi. By contrast, SVi did not discriminate survival either in patients with normal or low FR. Low FR was an independent predictor of mortality (pÂ = 0.013) after adjusting for age, clinical prognostic factors, European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II, dimensionless velocity index, left ventricular mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, time, type of aortic valve intervention, and SVi (pÂ = 0.59). In patients with low-gradient, low valve area aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve intervention, lowÂ FR, not low SVi, was an independent predictor of medium-term mortality\n\nPrior oral conditions in patients undergoing heart valve surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nSilvestre, Francisco-Javier; Gil-Raga, Irene; Martinez-Herrera, Mayte; Lauritano, Dorina; Silvestre-Rangil, Javier\n\n2017-11-01\n\nPatients scheduled for heart valve surgery should be free of any oral infectious disorders that might pose a risk in the postoperative period.

This study sought to determine the incidence, timing, and predictors of VHD in a large cohort of patients undergoing TAVR. This multicenter registry included 1,521 patients (48% male; 80 Â± 7 years of age) who underwent TAVR. Mean echocardiographic follow-up was 20 Â± 13 months (minimum: 6 months). Echocardiographic examinations were performed at discharge, at 6 to 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Annualized changes in mean gradient (mm Hg/year) were calculated by dividing the difference between the mean gradient at last follow-up and the gradient at discharge by the time between examinations. VHD was defined as a â¥10 mm Hg increase in transprosthetic mean gradient during follow-up compared with discharge assessment. The overall mean annualized rate of transprosthetic gradient progression during follow-up was 0.30 Â± 4.99 mm Hg/year. A total of 68 patients met criteria of VHD (incidence: 4.5% during follow-up). The absence of anticoagulation therapy at hospital discharge (p = 0.002), a valve-in-valve (TAVR in a surgical valve) procedure (p = 0.032), the use of a 23-mm valve (p = 0.016), and a greater body mass index (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of VHD. There was a mild but significant increase in transvalvular gradients over time after TAVR. The lack of anticoagulation therapy, a valve-in-valve procedure, a greater body mass index, and the use of a 23-mm transcatheter valve were associated with higher rates of VHD post-TAVR. Further prospective studies are required to determine whether a specific antithrombotic therapy post-TAVR may reduce the risk of VHD. Copyright Â© 2016 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Thirty-four were normal dogs and 79 dogs were affected by MMVD. Real-time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography mitral datasets were digitally recorded and analyzed using dedicated software. The following variables were obtained and compared between healthy dogs and dogs with MMVD at different stages: antero-posterior annulus diameter, anterolateral-posteromedial annulus diameter, commissural diameter, annulus height, annulus circumference, annulus area, anterior leaflet length, anterior leaflet area, posterior leaflet length, posterior leaflet area, non-planar angle, annulus sphericity index, tenting height, tenting area, tenting volume, the ratio of annulus height and commissural diameter. Dogs with MMVD had a more circular MV annulus compared to healthy dogs as demonstrated by an increased annulus sphericity index (p=0.0179). Affected dogs had a less saddle-shaped MV manifest as a decreased annulus height to commissural width ratio (p=0.0004). Tenting height (p<0.0001), area (p<0.0001), and volume (p<0.0001) were less in affected dogs. Real-time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography analysis demonstrated that dogs affected by MMVD had a more circular and less saddle-shaped MV annulus, as well as reduced tenting height area and volume, compared to healthy dogs. Multiple variables differed between dogs at different stages of MMVD. Diagnostic and prognostic utility of these variables, and the significance of these changes in the pathogenesis and natural history of MMVD, require further attention. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Retrospective review from a single facial plastic surgery center. We reviewed 40 consecutive patients evaluated for either sinusitis or nasal airway obstruction for which a CT scan was obtained at a single radiology institution. Thirty-six complete office records were examined for the presence of clinical internal valve narrowing and complaints of nasal obstruction. In total, 72 internal nasal valves were analyzed using axial plane CT and measurements were compared to clinical findings and presence of airway obstruction. Measured valve areas for clinically normal internal nasal valves averaged 0.47 cm(2) vs 0.28 cm(2) for clinically narrow valves, a decrease of 40.4%. In unobstructed nasal airways the valve area averaged 0.51 cm(2) vs 0.38 cm(2) in obstructed airways, a difference of 25.5%. A radiographically measured valve area of <0.30 cm(2) suggests clinical narrowing with a sensitivity of 71.4%, specificity of 88.9%, positive predictive value of 62.5%, and negative predictive value of 92.3%. Using standard axial CT imaging we describe an objective method of radiographically evaluating the nasal valve, demonstrating strong correlation with physical examination and patient complaint. Additionally, radiographic valve areas can be used to screen for clinically narrow nasal valves with good sensitivity and specificity, providing a novel straightforward method for nasal valve assessment.

These different design configurations of bi-leaflet mechanical heart valves model are created through the use of Computer-aided design (CAD) modelling and simulated using Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software. Design 1 is based on existing conventional bi-leaflet valve and design 2 based on modified bi-leaflet respectively. The flow pattern, velocity, vorticity and stress analysis have been done to justify the best design. Based on results, both of the designs show a Doppler velocity index of less than the allowable standard of 2.2 which is safe to be used as replacement of the human heart valve. However, design 2 shows that it has a lower possibility of cavitation issue which will lead to lower thrombosis and provide good central flow area of blood as compared to design 1.\n\nDevelopment of Mitral Stenosis After Mitral Valve Repair: Importance of Mitral Valve Area.\n\nPubMed\n\nChan, Kwan Leung; Chen, Shin-Yee; Mesana, Thierry; Lam, Buu Khanh\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe development of mitral stenosis (MS) is not uncommon after mitral valve (MV) repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR), but the significance of MS in this setting has not been defined. We prospectively studied 110 such patients who underwent supine bicycle exercise testing to assess intracardiac hemodynamics at rest and at peak exercise. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were measured at rest and after the exercise test. The patients also performed the 6-minute walk test and completed the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Follow-up was performed by a review of the medical record and telephone interview. Of 110 patients, 22 had MS defined by a mitral valve area (MVA) â¤ 1.5 cm 2 . The resting and peak exercise mitral gradients and pulmonary artery systolic pressure were significantly higher in patients with MS compared with patients with an MVA > 1.5 cm 2 . BNP levels at rest and after exercise were also higher in the patients with MS, who also had lower exercise capacity and worse perception of well-being in 3 domains (physical function, vitality, and social function) on the SF-36. MVA had higher specificity and positive predictive value in predicting outcome events compared with a mean gradient of 3 or 5Â mmÂ Hg. In patients who had MV repair for degenerative MR, an MVA â¤ 1.5 cm 2 occurs in about one-fifth of patients and is associated with adverse intracardiac hemodynamics, lower exercise capacity, and adverse outcomes.

Both solenoid type and latching type valves are considered. The study is divided into two principal areas: (1) preparation of a valve specification reflecting the requirements of the inlet system cyclic valves for the Pioneer Venus Probe mass spectrometer and the submittal of this specification to potential valve suppliers for their response and proposal; (2) preparation of a design layout of an optimum cyclic valve meeting all of the valve specification requirements.\n\nBicuspid aortic valve hemodynamics: a fluid-structure interaction study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChandra, Santanu; Seaman, Clara; Sucosky, Philippe\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThe bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital defect in which the aortic valve forms with two leaflets instead of three. While calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) also develops in the normal tricuspid aortic valve (TAV), its progression in the BAV is more rapid. Although studies have suggested a mechano-potential root for the disease, the native BAV hemodynamics remains largely unknown. This study aimed at characterizing BAV hemodynamics and quantifying the degree of wall-shear stress (WSS) abnormality on BAV leaflets. Fluid-structure interaction models validated with particle-image velocimetry were designed to predict the flow and leaflet dynamics in idealized TAV and BAV anatomies. Valvular function was quantified in terms of the effective orifice area. The regional leaflet WSS was characterized in terms of oscillatory shear index, temporal shear magnitude and temporal shear gradient. The predictions indicate the intrinsic degree of stenosis of the BAV anatomy, reveal drastic differences in shear stress magnitude and pulsatility on BAV and TAV leaflets and confirm the side- and site-specificity of the leaflet WSS. Given the ability of abnormal fluid shear stress to trigger valvular inflammation, these results support the existence of a mechano-etiology of CAVD in the BAV.\n\nPrevalence and Prognostic Significance of Right Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLindsay, Alistair C; Harron, Katie; Jabbour, Richard J; Kanyal, Ritesh; Snow, Thomas M; Sawhney, Paramvir; Alpendurada, Francisco; Roughton, Michael; Pennell, Dudley J; Duncan, Alison; Di Mario, Carlo; Davies, Simon W; Mohiaddin, Raad H; Moat, Neil E\n\n2016-07-01\n\nCardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide important structural information in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Although CMR is considered the standard of reference for measuring ventricular volumes and mass, the relationship between CMR findings of right ventricular (RV) function and outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation has not previously been reported. A total of 190 patients underwent 1.5 Tesla CMR before transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Steady-state free precession sequences were used for aortic valve planimetry and to assess ventricular volumes and mass. Semiautomated image analysis was performed by 2 specialist reviewers blinded to patient treatment. Patient follow-up was obtained from the Office of National Statistics mortality database. The median age was 81.0 (interquartile range, 74.9-85.5) years; 50.0% were women. Impaired RV function (RV ejection fraction â¤50%) was present in 45 (23.7%) patients. Patients with RV dysfunction had poorer left ventricular ejection fractions (42% versus 69%), higher indexed left ventricular end-systolic volumes (96 versus 40 mL), and greater indexed left ventricular mass (101 versus 85 g/m(2); P<0.01 for all) than those with normal RV function. Median follow-up was 850 days; 21 of 45 (46.7%) patients with RV dysfunction died, compared with 43 of 145 (29.7%) patients with normal RV function (P=0.035). After adjustment for significant baseline variables, both RV ejection fraction â¤50% (hazard ratio, 2.12; P=0.017) and indexed aortic valve area (hazard ratio, 4.16; P=0.025) were independently associated with survival. RV function, measured on preprocedural CMR, is an independent predictor of mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. CMR assessment of RV function may be important in the risk stratification of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

The study included 56 patients who underwent valve replacement due to rheumatic (n=32; 15 males; mean age 47+/-10 years) and degenerative (n=24; 13 males; mean age 55+/-12 years) HVD. Plasma and tissue total oxidative status (TOS) and total antioxidative capacity (TAC) levels were measured and OSI was calculated. Patients with degenerative HVD had significantly higher age, increased interventricular septum thickness, and higher frequency of aortic stenosis, whereas the incidence of mitral stenosis was higher in patients with rheumatic HVD (p<0.05). Plasma oxidative characteristics did not differ between the two HVD groups (p>0.05). Tissue TAC was significantly lower in patients with rheumatic HVD (p=0.027), whereas tissue TOS and OSI were similar between the two HVD groups (p>0.05). In bivariate analysis, plasma OSI did not show any correlation with clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic variables (p>0.05). Our data show that plasma and tissue OSI levels are similar in patients with rheumatic and degenerative HVD.\n\nOne-year outcomes after rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoung, Christopher; Laufer, GÃ¼nther; Kocher, Alfred; Solinas, Marco; Alamanni, Francesco; Polvani, Gianluca; Podesser, Bruno K; Aramendi, Jose Ignacio; Arribas, Jose; Bouchot, Olivier; Livi, Ugolino; Massetti, Massimo; Terp, Kim; Giot, Christophe; Glauber, Mattia\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe goals of rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement include facilitation of minimally invasive surgery and reduced aortic crossclamp time. We report the short-term outcomes of a series of 493 patients undergoing rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement with the EDWARDS INTUITY valve system (Edwards Lifesciences, LLC, Irvine, Calif). Assessing Standard oF Care and Clinical Outcomes UsiNg the EDWARDS INTUITY VAlve SysTem in a European multI-center, Active, pOst-market surveillaNce Study was a prospective, multicenter (nÂ =Â 26) European registry designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the valve system. During rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement, device technical success and crossclamp time were assessed. Procedural outcomes, hemodynamic performance, and various adverse events and clinical outcomes were evaluated up to 2Â years. Between 2012 and 2014, 493 of 517 enrolled patients successfully received implants with the study valve (95.4% technical success). Mean crossclamp times for 163 full sternotomies, 128 mini-upper sternotomies, and 36 right anterior thoracotomies isolated aortic valve replacements were 47.3, 52.0, and 73.3Â minutes, respectively. Mean follow-up was 1.8Â years, with 870 total patient-years of follow-up. Mean effective orifice area increased from 0.72 (baseline) to 1.88Â cm 2 , and mean pressure gradient decreased from 47.6 to 9.6Â mm Hg (1Â year). Mean effective orifice area index increased (0.39-1.01Â cm 2 /m 2 ), and 28 of 287 patients (9.8%) exhibited severe prosthesis-patient mismatch at 1Â year. After 1Â year, 68.1% and 21.7% of patients were in New York Heart Association class I and II, respectively. Freedom from death, major bleeding, major perivalvular leak, reoperation, and device explant at 1Â year were 0.935, 0.939, 0.976, 0.975, and 0.983, respectively. These results demonstrate commendable safety and performance of the test valve system over the short term in a broad European setting.

Besides balloon-post-dilatation, valve-in-valve (ViV) procedures can be taken into consideration to control this complication. Herein we present initial experience with use of the latest generation balloon-expandable Edwards Sapien 3Â® (S3) transcatheter heart valve (THV) for treatment of failing THVs. Between 01/2014 and 12/2014 three patients (two male, age: 71-80 y, log EUROScore I: 11.89 - 32.63) with failing THVs were refered to our institution for further treatment. THV approach with secondary implantation of an S3 was chosen after mutual agreement of the local interdisciplinary heart team at an interval of 533-1119 days from the index procedure. The performed procedures consisted of: S3 in Sapien XT, JenaValve and CoreValve. Successful transfemoral implantation with significant reduction of PVL was achieved in all cases. No intraprocedural complications occurred regarding placement of the S3 with a postprocedural effective orifice area (EOA) of 1.5-2.5 cm(2) and pressure gradients of max/mean 14/6-36/16 mmHg. 30-day mortality was 0%. At the latest follow-up of 90-530 days, all patients are alive and well with satisfactory THV function. Regarding VARC-2 criteria one major bleeding and one TIA was reported. In the instance of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation after TAVI, S3 ViV deployment is an excellent option to reduce residual regurgitation to none or mild. For further assertions concerning functional outcomes long-term results have to be awaited.\n\nDirect Comparison of the Edwards Intuity Elite and Sorin Perceval S Rapid Deployment Aortic Valves.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiakopoulos, Oliver J; Gerfer, Stephen; Weider, Simone; Rahmanian, Parwis; Zeriouh, Mohamed; Eghbalzadeh, Kaveh; Sabashnikov, Anton; Choi, Yeong-Hoon; Wippermann, Jens; Wahlers, Thorsten\n\n2018-01-01\n\nRapid deployment aortic valve replacement (RDAVR) has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement. This single-center study directly compared two commercially available rapid deployment valves with regard to clinical outcomes, valve-related complications, and hemodynamic performance. A total of consecutive 156 patients underwent RDAVR with the Intuity Elite (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA [Intuity group, nÂ = 117] or the Perceval S (Sorin Group Italia Srl, Saluggia, Italy [Perceval group, nÂ = 39]) between September 2012 and March 2016 at our institution. Perioperative data, including 30-day all-cause mortality, and echocardiographic measurements were assessed and retrospectively analyzed from our institutional database. Preoperative variables, including mean age (77 Â± 5 years), European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (6.8 Â± 2.1), and body mass index (27 Â± 5 kg/m 2 ), did not differ between groups. More male patients (60% versus 15%) with a higher body surface area (1.9 Â± 0.2 m 2 versus 1.7 Â± 0.2 m 2 ) and body weight (78 Â± 13 kg versus 71 Â± 15 kg) were in the Intuity group compared with the Perceval group, respectively (p < 0.05). Implanted RDAVR size (23.3 Â± 1.8 mm versus 23.4 Â± 1.5 mm), concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery (48% versus 33%), number of grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass, and aortic clamp time were comparable between the Intuity group and the Perceval group. Thirty-day mortality (Intuity 2.6% versus Perceval 5.1%) and valve-related complications (Intuity 12.0% versus Perceval 20.5%), including postoperative pacemaker implantation (Intuity 8.5% versus Perceval 12.8%), did not differ between groups.

We studied consecutive patients with a dilated aortic root (â¥4 cm) that underwent echocardiography and gated contrast-enhanced thoracic aortic computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography between 2003 and 2007. A ratio of aortic root area over height was calculated (cm 2 /m) on tomography, and a cutoff of 10 cm 2 /m was chosen as abnormal, on the basis of previous reports. All-cause death was recorded. The cohort comprised 771 patients (63 years [interquartile range, 53-71], 87% men, 85% hypertension, 51% hyperlipidemia, 56% smokers). Inherited aortopathies, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, and severe aortic stenosis were seen in 7%, 18%, and 2%, whereas 91% and 54% were on Î²-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, respectively. Aortic root area/height ratio was â¥10 cm 2 /m in 24%. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and right ventricular systolic pressure were 3.3Â±3 and 31Â±7 mmâHg, respectively. At 7.8 years (interquartile range, 6.6-8.9), 280 (36%) patients underwent aortic surgery (76% within 1 year) and 130 (17%) died (1% in-hospital postoperative mortality). A lower proportion of patients in the surgical (versus nonsurgical) group died (13% versus 19%, P<0.01).

Left heart dimensions were measured as well as mitral regurgitant jet area/left atrial area (JAR), early mitral filling velocity (Evel), extent of mitral valve prolapse in right and left views (ProlR, ProlL), Prol indexed to aortic diameter (ProlR:Ao, ProlL:Ao), presence of a flail leaflet (FlailR, FlailL), and mitral regurgitation vena contracta diameter (VCR, VCL) indexed to aortic diameter (VCR:Ao, VCL:Ao). Follow-up from referring veterinarians was obtained by questionnaire or telephone to determine survival times. Inter- and intra-observer agreement was evaluated with Bland-Altman plots and weighted Kappa analysis. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, logrank tests and Cox's proportional hazards. Logrank analysis showed VCL:Ao, VCR:Ao, FlailL, ProlR:Ao, ProlL:Ao, left ventricular internal dimension in diastole indexed to aortic diameter (LVIDD:Ao) >2.87, left atrium to aorta ratio (LA/Ao) >1.6, and Evel >1.4Â m/s were predictors of cardiac mortality. In a multivariable analysis, the independent predictors of cardiac mortality were Evel >1.4Â m/s [hazard ratio (HR) 5.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-10.3], FlailL (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.9), and ProlR:Ao (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3-6.3).

Those valves' leaflets enlarge with altered collagen fiber architecture, content, and cross-linking and biphasic changes (decreases, then increases) in extensibility during gestation. This study extends our analyses to right-sided valves, with additional compositional measurements for all valves. Valve leaflets were harvested from nonpregnant heifers and pregnant cows. Leaflet structure was characterized by leaflet dimensions, and ECM composition was determined using standard biochemical assays. Histological studies assessed changes in cellular and ECM components. Leaflet mechanical properties were assessed using equibiaxial mechanical testing. Collagen thermal stability and cross-linking were assessed using denaturation and hydrothermal isometric tension tests. Pulmonary and tricuspid leaflet areas increased during pregnancy by 35 and 55%, respectively. Leaflet thickness increased by 20% only in the pulmonary valve and largely in the fibrosa (30% thickening). Collagen crimp length was reduced in both the tricuspid (61%) and pulmonary (42%) valves, with loss of crimped area in the pulmonary valve. Thermomechanics showed decreased collagen thermal stability with surprisingly maintained cross-link maturity. The pulmonary leaflet exhibited the biphasic change in extensibility seen in left side valves, whereas the tricuspid leaflet mechanics remained largely unchanged throughout pregnancy. The tricuspid valve exhibits a remodeling response during pregnancy that is significantly diminished from the other three valves. All valves of the heart remodel in pregnancy in a manner distinct from cardiac pathology, with much similarity valve to valve, but with interesting valve-specific responses in the aortic and tricuspid valves.

The intelligent flow control valve may be used to stop the flow while repairs are made. Once repairs have been made, the valve may be removed or used as a control valve to meter the amount of flow from inside the pipe. With the addition of instrumentation, the valve may also be used as a variable area flow meter and flow controller programmed based upon flowing conditions. With robotic additions, the valve may be configured to crawl into a desired pipe location, anchor itself, and activate flow control or metering remotely.\n\nLeft ventricular mass regression after aortic valve replacement with the new Mitroflow 12A pericardial bioprosthesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-Bengochea, JosÃ©; Sierra, Juan; GonzÃ¡lez-Juanatey, JosÃ© R; Rubio, JosÃ©; Vega, Marino; FernÃ¡ndez, Angel L; SÃ¡nchez, Daniel\n\n2006-05-01\n\nThe study aim was to evaluate the durability of the new Mitroflow 12A pericardial bioprosthesis and to assess ventricular mass regression after aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with small valves.

A subset of 61 patients with preoperative stenosis was selected and submitted to conventional echo-Doppler assessment at a mean period of 11.1 months after surgery. Hospital mortality was 8.6%. At eight years of follow up, survival was 57.1%. Freedom from structural valve deterioration (SVD) was 86.5% per pt-yr. Mean gradients were significantly reduced postoperatively for each valve size (to 18 +/- 8 mmHg for 19-mm valves and 12 +/- 4 mmHg for 25-mm valves). The effective orifice area (EOA) was also increased significantly for all valve sizes (to 1.1 +/- 0.1 cm2 for 19-mm valves and 1.8 +/- 0.2 cm2 for 25-mm valves). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) decreased significantly, from 177 +/- 29 to 136 +/- 22 g/m2 for the 19-mm valve, and from 200 +/- 42 to 132 +/- 22 g/m2 for the 25-mm valve. The EOA index (EOAI) showed mismatch for the 19- and 21-mm valves (0.74 and 0.82 cm2/m2, respectively). The diagrammatic calculation between LVMI and relative wall thickness after surgery showed that 29.7% of patients achieved a normal pattern of remodeling (including 19- and 21-mm valves), despite various degrees of mismatch. The new Mitroflow 12A pericardial bioprosthesis showed an absence of mechanical failure after an eight-year follow up, with a satisfactory rate of SVD. Significant reductions in LVMI and improved ventricular geometry were observed, despite the small valve sizes implanted.\n\nBioprosthetic Valve Fracture to Facilitate Transcatheter Valve-in-Valve Implantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nAllen, Keith B; Chhatriwalla, Adnan K; Cohen, David J; Saxon, John T; Aggarwal, Sanjeev; Hart, Anthony; Baron, Suzanne; Davis, J Russell; Pak, Alex F; Dvir, Danny; Borkon, A Michael\n\n2017-11-01\n\nValve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement is less effective in small surgical bioprostheses. We evaluated the feasibility of bioprosthetic valve fracture with a high-pressure balloon to facilitate valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement. InÂ vitro bench testing on aortic tissue valves was performed on 19-mm and 21-mm Mitroflow (Sorin, Milan, Italy), Magna and Magna Ease (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA), Trifecta and Biocor Epic (St. Jude Medical, Minneapolis, MN), and Hancock II and Mosaic (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). High-pressure balloons Tru Dilation, Atlas Gold, and Dorado (C.R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ) were used to determine which valves could be fractured and at what pressure fracture occurred. Mitroflow, Magna, Magna Ease, Mosaic, and Biocor Epic surgical valves were successfully fractured using high-pressures balloon 1 mm larger than the labeled valve size whereas Trifecta and Hancock II surgical valves could not be fractured. Only the internal valve frame was fractured, and the sewing cuff was never disrupted. Manufacturer's rated burst pressures for balloons were exceeded, with fracture pressures ranging from 8 to 24 atmospheres depending on the surgical valve. Testing further demonstrated that fracture facilitated the expansion of previously constrained, underexpanded transcatheter valves (both balloon and self-expanding) to the manufacturer's recommended size. Bench testing demonstrates that the frame of most, but not all, bioprosthetic surgical aortic valves can be fractured using high-pressure balloons. The safety of bioprosthetic valve fracture to optimize valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement in small surgical valves requires further clinical investigation.

Patricia; Rosing, Douglas R.; Bakalov, Vladimir; Sachdev, Vandana; Bondy, Carolyn A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Congenital aortic valve fusion is associated with aortic dilation, aneurysm and rupture in girls and women with Turner syndrome (TS). Our objective was to characterize aortic valve structure in subjects with TS, and determine the prevalence of aortic dilation and valve dysfunction associated with different types of aortic valves. Methods and Results The aortic valve and thoracic aorta were characterized by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in 208 subjects with TS in an IRB-approved natural history study. Echocardiography was used to measure peak velocities across the aortic valve, and the degree of aortic regurgitation. Four distinct valve morphologies were identified: tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) 64%(n=133), partially fused aortic valve (PF) 12%(n=25), bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) 23%(n=47), and unicuspid aortic valve (UAV) 1%(n=3). Age and body surface area (BSA) were similar in the 4 valve morphology groups. There was a significant trend, independent of age, towards larger BSA-indexed ascending aortic diameters (AADi) with increasing valve fusion. AADi were (mean +/â SD) 16.9 +/â 3.3 mm/m2, 18.3 +/â 3.3 mm/m2, and 19.8 +/â 3.9 mm/m2 (p<0.0001) for TAV, PF and BAV+UAV respectively. PF, BAV, and UAV were significantly associated with mild aortic regurgitation and elevated peak velocities across the aortic valve. Conclusions Aortic valve abnormalities in TS occur with a spectrum of severity, and are associated with aortic root dilation across age groups. Partial fusion of the aortic valve, traditionally regarded as an acquired valve problem, had an equal age distribution and was associated with an increased AADi.

Management of functional tricuspid regurgitation at the time of subsequent pulmonary valve replacement remains controversial. Our aims were to (1) analyze tricuspid valve function after pulmonary valve replacement through midterm follow-up and (2) determine the benefits, if any, of concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty. Thirty-five patients with tetralogy of Fallot or congenital pulmonary stenosis were analyzed. All patients had been palliated in childhood by disrupting the pulmonary valve, and all patients had at least moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation at the time of subsequent pulmonary valve replacement. Preoperative and serial postoperative echocardiograms were analyzed. Pulmonary and tricuspid regurgitation, along with right ventricular dilation and dysfunction were scored as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). Right ventricular volume and area were also calculated. Comparisons were made between patients who underwent pulmonary valve replacement alone and those who underwent concomitant tricuspid valve annuloplasty. At 1 month after pulmonary valve replacement, there were significant reductions in pulmonary valve regurgitation (mean 3 vs 0.39, p < 0.0001), tricuspid valve regurgitation (mean 2.33 vs 1.3, p < 0.0001), and in right ventricular dilation, volume, and area. There was no difference in the degree of tricuspid regurgitation 1Â month postoperatively between patients who underwent concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty and those who underwent pulmonary valve replacement alone (mean 1.31 vs 1.29, pÂ = 0.81). However, at latest follow-up (mean 7.0 Â± 2.8 years), the degree of tricuspid regurgitation was significantly higher in the concomitant annuloplasty group (mean 1.87 vs 1.12, pÂ = 0.005). In patients with at least moderate tricuspid valve\n\nStatic Flow Characteristics of a Mass Flow Injecting Valve\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMattern, Duane; Paxson, Dan\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA sleeve valve is under development for ground-based forced response testing of air compression systems. This valve will be used to inject air and to impart momentum to the flow inside the first stage of a multi-stage compressor. The valve was designed to deliver a maximum mass flow of 0.22 lbm/s (0.1 kg/s) with a maximum valve throat area of 0.12 sq. in (80 sq. mm), a 100 psid (689 KPA) pressure difference across the valve and a 68 F, (20 C) air supply. It was assumed that the valve mass flow rate would be proportional to the valve orifice area. A static flow calibration revealed a nonlinear valve orifice area to mass flow relationship which limits the maximum flow rate that the valve can deliver. This nonlinearity was found to be caused by m"
