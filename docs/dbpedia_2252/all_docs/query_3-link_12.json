This is where I notice that in these pictures of her with Karolina Kurkova she is much shorter than 1.78, and she is lifting her head up a little bit, while Karolina is LOWERING her head.

Look at this Click Here Jimmy fallon is 182 cm and can pull of 183 alot ( probably because his heels is 0,25 inch more than most of his guests). Look at after 2 minutes she takes of her heels and he is in shoes. Lets say his shoes is 1,25 inches that makes him almost 185 cm and she is barefoot and still only looks 4 cm shorter. I know she isnt 181 cm but i mean after looking at that i cant really belive she is only 178. i think she could be 179 or fraction over that. What do you say? I cant believe how the average guess is 177 i mean there is zeeeeeero chanse of that.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nYes, the clip was mentioned in the past and she could seem closer to that 179cm mark, given her heel advantage.\n\nBradley said on 4/Oct/21\n\nStrong 5-10.\n\nClair said on 23/Sep/21\n\nGisele was clearly the tallest among the top angels.

Clearly her height is around 1.75 to 1.77 no more than that. To be exact I think 1.76\n\nClick Here\n\nAnd here is her next to 1.78 Carol Ribeiro, 1.80 Kurkova and Ana Beatriz, she looks short\n\nClick Here\n\nNatasha Jimenez said on 19/Jan/21\n\nHer listing 5'11 is hilarious. She is for sure shorter than that. I don't even believe that she is full 5'10, more like 5'9.5/177 cm. I have watched her on runways, and she is almost always shorter than other models for an inch. Also she is solid inch shorter than Karolina Kurkova (5'11). 5ft 9.\n\nKendall said on 9/Jan/21\n\nRob asks me a question, how tall is Gisele with these heels and no heels along with Jimmy Fallon? She always wears heels 10cm high.\n\nClick Here 2:01 with heels\n\n2:10 no heels\n\nEditor Rob\n\nin heels she could have been gaining close to 3.75 inches, as the difference from looking over an inch taller, maybe nearly 2 inches than Jimmy to then like 1.5 inches smaller is a big swing.\n\nAllie said on 5/Jan/21\n\n@Rob - I'm not sure when her agency started saying she was 179/180cm, but I found an agency called \"Option Model Agency\" where she was listed as being 179cm tall. Aside from that one article, I haven't found any source that describes her as being 1.77m, in fact, as early as 2001, Gisele was described as being 5'11, according to a segment on her done during the 2001 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show (if the video works, it starts at the 7:57 mark).\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI'm sure it must have come from somewhere, but yeah it's hard to look back that far and try to find agency stuff.\n\nAllie said on 4/Jan/21\n\nRob, I saw an older comment and found the 2000 article describing Gisele as being 1.77M!\n\nThe quote: \"The reason for this craze stands 1.77 meters tall and has smoldering blue eyes.\"\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nit might have been one of her earlier agency listings that old 177cm.\n\nClara said on 25/Dec/20\n\nRob, what do you think of the difference between Gisele and presenter Oprah Winfrey?\n\nClick Here 1:00 moment\n\nEditor Rob\n\nabout 5ft 10 in the clip\n\nunknown139 said on 29/Nov/20\n\nGisele is 5'10.5\" (1.79 m)\n\nClara said on 22/Nov/20\n\nRob asks me a question, do you think the difference between Gisele for Tyra and Adriana is only 1cm? Why does Gisele always seem to be much smaller, would the leaner physique be the reason?\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI thought Gisele looked over 5ft 10 there, Tyra looked quite tall too\n\nClara said on 18/Nov/20\n\nRob what do you think of the difference in height between Gisele and Heidi, I don't see much difference?\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nwithout knowing their footwear, they looked within an inch of each other, at times quite close\n\nJani said on 4/May/20\n\nNext to James Corden she looked like 177cm.\n\nanca said on 20/Apr/20\n\n1.75\n\n91-62-89\n\nanca said on 20/Apr/20\n\n1.75\n\n91-62-89\n\nNik Ashton said on 29/Mar/20\n\n@ Rob -Could she be under 5â10â?\n\n@ Hacker - How tall do you think Katy Perry is?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI am not convinced she is under that height\n\nManon said on 27/Mar/20\n\nIn this video at 16:55, she says that at 13 she was 1.78 and playing volleyball.\n\nClick Here\n\nPamela said on 27/Mar/20\n\nIn this video at 0:50 she says 5'11 \"Why do models lie their heights Rob? What would be the reason for that? She is already tall, 1.77 is for the catwalk model if that was the reason. If the company wants a model with 1.80 and the agency sends one with 1.77, is that right?\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI think some round up a bit, or tack on half inch in some cases.\n\nPamela said on 13/Mar/20\n\nIn my view Gisele was always shorter than Tyra Banks and Adriana Lima, both 1.78 and are very similar in height, Gisele always seemed shorter with both, that is, there is no way she can have 1.80 as she says . The lean and elongated appearance of the legs gives the impression of being even taller than it really is, here in Brazil it has always been described as 1.77. But in my point of view, she is between 1.75 and 1.76 because it is not only 1 centimeter different from her to Tyra, and even worse she with Karolina Kurkova, that even seeing that it is much smaller, she claims to have 1.80.\n\nHacker said on 2/Nov/19\n\nShorter than Adriana Lima barefoot.

Why do agencies lie too many times? When a company hires a model listed at 5'11\" and it is 5'9.5 \"they don't they claim false stature?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI don't understand at times why they add some height (or remove some).\n\nBut there may be a good proportion-level, like 5ft 10-11 would provide, which is why it's a desirable height to model.\n\nPamela said on 15/May/19\n\nGisele and Heidi Klum Reality Show\n\nClick Here\n\nMarry said on 26/Feb/19\n\nGisele and Isabeli\n\nClick Here\n\nCanson said on 23/Feb/19\n\nI think 5â10 is as high as she is\n\nJancys said on 22/Feb/19\n\nTall woman. 5ft 10 for sure.\n\nXuxa1 said on 4/Feb/19\n\nClick Here exact same shoes\n\nClick Here\n\nHey, Rob.

I was standing in the 1st class entryway one night when Gisele came on board. I'm 6'2\", without shoes. My shoes probably put my height at 6'3\". Gisele was a skinny little thing, mousy hair, nondescript jeans, simple blouse, and without makeup (as far as I could tell). She looked like a 4, if you're a guy that likes some butt and some curves up high. Her hair looked like she hadn't washed it for several days. I have to belief that she went to some effort to look NOT like Gisele, but I don't know. All I know is that I knew she was coming down the jet bridge, because I was told that we were holding the flight for her, and when she came into view, I thought \"wow, you're lucky that we're waiting for Gisele, or you wouldn't have made the flight\". As I was saying, I'm 6'2\", and when I look into a woman's eyes who is 5'11\", and she's wearing much in the way of heels, then we're pretty much eye-to-eye. If she's in flats, then there's just a bit of a difference in eye level. When Gisele got on the plane that night, she did not make eye contact with me, but I was looking her all over and when I was looking at her face and eyes, they were at the height I'd associate with a girl of average height. Given that she was slouched to some degree, I'll give her an extra 3-4 inches. If average height for a girl is around 5' 4\"-5\", that would put Gisele around 5'8. She IS NOT 5' 10\" -11\"!!! NO WAY!\n\nMary said on 13/Jan/18\n\nGisele, Ana Hickmann and Isabeli Fontana.

Yes, they could be around that length.\n\nPedro said on 3/Mar/16\n\nIsabeli fontana probably isn't very tall, she is like same height as alessandra, so between 174-176(and they both have the same claim of 177, but they dont have that height). She is very gorgeous, face and body, but could be considered model short since she can be under 5'9. But isabeli fontana doesnt look short even though she might be, because she has long legs, unlike ale, that looks short because of proportions, and 174 isnt short for women.\n\nNow izabel goulart seems very close in height with adriana, she is at least 176, and she is always consistently listed at 177 so i would guess 176.5-177 for her and 177-177.5 for adriana. Izabel goulart isn't model short like isabeli and ale are.\n\nI used to think izabel was same height as ale, but ale is a lot shorter than izabel, izabel is close to adriana's range, and ale's 177 claim is very false.\n\nTake a look at this: Click Here\n\nIzabel looks 3cm taller than 174 Alessandra and a little taller than helena christensen too(i dont know how tall helena is, maybe 5'9-5'9.25) and their heels are all equal.\n\nAllie said on 29/Feb/16\n\nMaybe she is. Either way, I do agree though. Adriana and Gisele are at least 177 cm.\n\nizabel well I've heard people say she's a little shorter so maybe 175 or 176. Do you know Iasbeli's height? She looks model short and people said that she's one of the shorter models.. Still beautiful none the less. Maybe she's one of those that looks short but is taller in person?\n\nPedro said on 28/Feb/16\n\nMaybe she is 177\n\nI saw this 177 listing but not in brazil, it was in an article in english, but i do understand that in the beginning of her carrier she was listed 177, so she might be close to that.\n\nShe is quite close to adri\n\nI just think she might be a stronger 5'10 than adri, because she isnt stated at177 as often as adriana is, she is more listed at 179, which doesnt look like it, but i think 178 strong is the best guess for her.\n\nYou should see gisele next to izabel goulart, (iza looks close in height with adriana but might be slightly shorter, if not same height)\n\nGisele is a tad taller than izabel and i believe izabel is 177-176.5(maybe a strong177-177.5 like adriana if iza and adri are same height).\n\nAllie said on 26/Feb/16\n\nA commentor from Brazil claimed a while back that she has heard Gisele being 177 cm all her life.. Any thoughts on this Pedro?\n\nPedro said on 23/Feb/16\n\nStrong 5ft10, like 178 for real, and maybe 177.5 at her low. While adriana is just a legit 5'10, but not as strong as gisele's 5ft10. Adriana is more like 177.5-177, maybe 178 sometimes.\n\nName said on 14/Jan/16\n\nShe is 5ft 10.\n\nAllie said on 10/Jan/16\n\nBriana are you sure that the person you know can actually guess height well? Otherwise Tom Brady's only 6'2 but I don't think he'll lose 2 inches by evening as he was measured at 6'4 range. :).\n\nGisele's 5'10 maybe a tad under or a tad over but nothing under or above that. And don't let her pics with Karlie fool you. Karlie's not the end all be all for judging someone's height. She's looks 5'10 with other models.\n\nJerome said on 8/Jan/16\n\n@Brianna Hughes if Gisele was 5'8 the WHOLE Hollywood would need a huge downgrade\n\nBrianna Hughes said on 8/Jan/16\n\nWell, i just met a friend of theirs (chef) and she says Giselle is exactly 5'8 barefoot. So, this coming from someone who has a real non-fahion-industry relationship with her sounds a bit more legit. I saw pics of them together\n\nAllie said on 5/Dec/15\n\n@Dat Eh, always been kind of keen on model's heights and some of my fave singers or actors. Plus I love a good debate :) or putting in my two cents.\n\nTunman said on 4/Dec/15\n\n5'10 is more reasonable.5'9.75 is the lowest arguable in my opinion.A good chance that Lima edges her but no more than a little fraction.\n\ndat said on 4/Dec/15\n\nAllie looks like you live here. your comments are everywhere :D .\n\nDmeyer said on 2/Dec/15\n\nThats whi leo looked 3cm taller she is just 178cm\n\nAllie said on 1/Dec/15\n\nI'm startng to think that 177 is possible, but with people like Jimmy or Tom she'd have to be at least 5'10 to pull off looking that tall next to them with a heel that doesn't look too big. I think she claims 5'11 because that's the height that's now desired in the fashion industry. Notice how before during the Cindy Crawford era, most claimed or were listed at 5'9-5'9.5 save for a few?\n\nNow a days models want to be taller. 5'10-5'10.5 models become 5'11, taller than 5'11 becomes 5'11, etc. I do agree with her very slender figure making her appear taller and she's could be closer to 5'9.5 or a strong 5'10. That's tall enough for modeling though.\n\ngrizz said on 1/Dec/15\n\n@Allie, it's possible that she's 177 cm in fact. Her very slender figure can fool anyone. That's still really tall, I don't know why she claims 5'11.\n\nJanet said on 12/Nov/15\n\nShe's definitely a solid 5'10. I don't know why she fibbed because she's already so tall\n\nAllie said on 8/Nov/15\n\nShe still tries saying claiming 5'11 even though KK destroyed her claim all those years ago.\n\nAllie said on 6/Oct/15\n\nRob, which agency if you remember said she was 179? Most of the agencies I see have her at the 180 cm she claims.\n\nEditor Rob\n\nI can't remember now, many agencies change heights as you probably know. Sometimes older heights can be found going back using the internet archive, but it is time consuming...\n\nAllie said on 3/Oct/15\n\nNo way is just 5'9. Look at her with Jimmy Fallon. Fallon's 182 himself, wearing shoes that make him around 6'0.75 range according to Rob, and Gisele's heels have no platform on them and she's at least an inch inches taller. No way that a 173-175 person could pull that off without a platform with a person who's around 6'0.75 with the shoes.\n\n5'10 for her.\n\nN28 said on 13/Aug/15\n\nGisele BÃ¼ndchen is maximum 5'9 and all those photos of her next to Karlie Kloss (whether she's slouching or stretching or dancing or whatever) confirms this. No matter what anyone says, seeing is believing. Karlie Kloss always wears the shortest heels in contrast to the other models and yet she is way taller than them all, especially Gisele, the latter always wearing chunky platform superheels.\n\nAllie said on 12/Aug/15\n\nNo Gisele is not 180. She's a true 5'10. The exact same height as Adriana. Karolina herself has stated that's she only 5'11.\n\nJan said on 11/Aug/15\n\nGisele does not need an upgrade she was never any taller than Adriana Lima. Legit 5'10. No more.\n\nMaryAnne said on 10/Aug/15\n\nClick Here\n\n;\n\nwith super tall Oluchi, 5'9 Heidi and 5'11 Daniela\n\nDaniel said on 28/Jul/15\n\nRob Gisele needs an upgrade. 180cm. Karolina Kurkova is modeling lie height. Karoline is a solid 6\".Toni Garrn must be 6\"1\n\nvegasBitch said on 25/Jul/15\n\nI believe she's 5'11\" at least. I saw her a few times at Whole Foods and she look like a beanpole, with a a rather horsy face. Very fit and photographs well, but arrogant. Like she's got something to prove.\n\nLovelife said on 25/Jul/15\n\nI just noticed that in the infamous picture taken in 2013 with Gisele standing next to Karlie and Karlie looks 3-4 inches taller than Gisele. Gisele was slouching her head! If Gisele stood straight like Karlie than Gisele was actually only 2-2.5 inches shorter than Karlie. You can see in another picture at that event on Google. 180cm for Gisele and 185cm for Karlie.\n\nben said on 25/Jul/15\n\nBob finally downgraded her. Legit 178cm.\n\nben said on 20/Jul/15\n\nKarlie Kloss legit 187cm in the morning\n\nGisele Bundchen legit 178cm in the morning\n\nGisele was measured 177cm when she was 16 years old so it made sense that she grew 1 cm after that\n\nJust said on 20/Jul/15\n\nRob, this is a pic with full body shot of Gisele and Karolina, back to back, in similar high heels. Even with Gisele standing straight and Karolina slouching, Karolina is still 2\" taller than Gisele. Click Here\n\nSo, either Gisele is not 5'10\"5 or Karolina needs an upgrade to 6', right?\n\nEditor Rob\n\ngenerally I think about 5ft 10 fits Gisele amongst most of the other models.\n\nMaryAnne said on 9/Jul/15\n\nMax 178 with Tom\n\nJust said on 25/Jun/15\n\nI think everybody agrees it's impossible for Gisele to be 5'10\"5 since she's definitely more than 1\" shorter than 5'11 Karolina.\n\nAnd the majority knows her real height (before she got famous) is 177 cm.\n\nBishop said on 24/Jun/15\n\n5'9\" is too low. 5'10\" flat is probably better.\n\nAllie said on 23/Jun/15\n\n5'9.75 is the lowest I'd go. Which is still 177cm.\n\nAllie said on 15/Jun/15\n\nActually, I was gonna say 5'9ish, but given how she and Adriana look dead on in height, I think 178cm. Also, given her pictures with Kurkova, Rob, do you think 178 is more likely closer in the very least?\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nClick Here\n\nJames said on 27/May/15\n\nShe can't be 179 according to pictures with Karolina Kurkova and Karlei Kloss; 175 is closer by.\n\nJust said on 20/May/15\n\nRob, there's barely any height difference between Karlie and Toni or Karlie and Ireland, but still you've listed them 1\"5 apart. And there's clearly a bigger height difference between Gisele and Karolina, but you've only listed them a half inch apart. Why?\n\nSkye said on 14/May/15\n\nMore like 175-177 given her pic with Kurkova.\n\nMaryAnne said on 12/May/15\n\ndowngrade her to 1.77\n\nJust said on 3/May/15\n\nBefore she got famous she was 1.77 m. After she got famous she's all of a sudden 5'11 on certain sites (just like Jennifer Lawrence). She's clearly about 2 inches shorter than Karolina Kurlova. So there's no way Gisele is 5'10\"5! If she is, then Karolina is at least 6' tall.\n\nlouise2002 said on 24/Apr/15\n\nshe can't be 180, she is over 176-177cm\n\nTunman said on 16/Apr/15\n\n@Panda\n\nBrady was in fact measured 6'4 3/8\" or 194 which was rounded down to 6'4\n\nYou're right however when saying measurements are performed in the morning\n\nI think he's just 193 (a further cm loss from mid morning to late evening)\n\nPanda said on 10/Mar/15\n\nHey Rob, how tall do you think Tom Brady is? I know he is listed as 6'4\" (193 cm) and the NFL tends to be pretty honest however since it was done in the morning there could be several heights he could be. I think Tom Brady (when measured) could be anywhere from as low as 6'3.5\" to as high as 6'4.25\" in the morning (assuming he loses 0.5 inch by the end of the day) Brady, imo, is anywhere between 6'3\" to 6'3.75\". How tall do you think Brady is? I'd say he's 6'3.5\" (192 cm).\n\nMaryAnne said on 8/Mar/15\n\nI Remember when Adriana Lima, Gisele and Karolina went to TRL, Gisele and Karolina both said that they were 5'11 but then they stayed back to back and Karolina was heigher...\n\nMaryAnne said on 2/Mar/15\n\nShe looks 1.77 next to Karolina. Just my opinion :)\n\njoe 193cm night said on 20/Feb/15\n\nhere she is a volleyball player from Brazil Jaqueline Carvalho listed in 186cm https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTU8DIBACQTeTLOhzdL2RgVa7h-s2-Al9Naj34POhDcmFVFb79W\n\nLaura said on 3/Feb/15\n\na solid 5'11\" out of bed.\n\nJust said on 1/Jan/15\n\nMore like 2 inches shy of 5'11 rather than 2 cms, since she's 2 inches shorter than 5'11 Karolina.\n\nBGee said on 26/Nov/14\n\nJust a cm or two shy of a full 5'11, and stunning all the same!\n\njames said on 21/Nov/14\n\nGisele next to Karolina Kurkova and Karlie Kloss doesnÂ´t look any taller than 1.76 or 1.77, so 5ft9.5. 5ft10.5 is too much.\n\nFern194cm-192cm said on 5/Nov/14\n\nAnyone who thinks she is 5,9 is not all there... If you watch her on Fallon she is barefoot and they are standing straight and he is in shoes (that give him at least an inch probably more though knowing Fallon) and so that would put him at least 6,0.5 and she was legit no more than 1-1.5 inches shorter. She is 5,10.5-5,11.\n\nAsia said on 20/Jul/14\n\nBingo! Her agency lists her at 5 11\" she's actually 5 9\" looks tall because she's so thin. I was surprised when I saw her because she's listed at 5 11\". Standing next to a true 5 11 girl like Kurkova shows she's not as tall as everyone thinks she is.\n\nJust said on 18/Jul/14\n\nWith quite similar heels 5'11 Karolina Kurkova is almost 2 inches taller than Gisele. Click Here Click Here So no way Gisele is 5'10\"5. Those pictures certainly destroy Gisele's 5'11 claim. She's 5'9\"5 max.\n\nDon't you agree that the evidence is quite convincing, Rob?\n\n176,2Tunman said on 19/May/14\n\nSeemed towered by 194 Brady despite probable heels advantage,she's rather 177-8\n\nKylie said on 1/May/14\n\nrob, please could you do a height mention of russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova ?\n\nshe's even actress from the hollywood film which called 'clash of the titan'.. And, she is a industry icon of the fashion world recently.\n\nNicole said on 18/Apr/14\n\nSo yeah, Gisele is definitely 177cm.\n\nNicole said on 18/Apr/14\n\nI'm 5'9.5 and I met Gisele in church in 2009 and I could've sworn she wasn't any taller than me.\n\nHannah said on 27/Jan/14\n\nI heard she was 177 cm (5'9.5\")\n\nSlaya said on 17/Jan/14\n\nHey Rob on the celebrity weight page its written that she was 72kg. do you know if it was after her pregnancy or if it was her normal weight before drop to 58kg ?\n\nEditor Rob\n\nyeah the quote was talking about her pregnancy and how she managed to go back down to that weight\n\nLiz said on 15/Jan/14\n\nDoes she tower Tom Brady??\n\ntroyCARSAN said on 11/Jan/14\n\nRob, please add a height page for the tall Brazilian model Ana Beatriz Barros.\n\nJust said on 15/Dec/13\n\nGisele is 5'9\"5 max. Especially in those pictures next to Karlie Kloss who towers over her. She never claimed 5'10\"5.\n\nJust said on 4/Dec/13\n\nKarlie is 6'1, so Gisele is 5'9.\n\nJan said on 30/Nov/13\n\nToni Garrn is actually listed at 6'0 to 6'1. So she towers DiCaprio. Gisele is 5'9.5\" or 5'10\" max.\n\nyoyo said on 15/Nov/13\n\nGisele is at least 5'10...Karlie Kloss just might be 6'4 or 6'3 1/2...she's a giantess!\n\nGeorge said on 11/Nov/13\n\nWeak 5'9\", strong 5'8\". Next to Karlie Kloss (a solid 6'1\") and both wearing the same heels Gisele was near to Karlie's nose\n\nstrange said on 1/Sep/13\n\nshe cant be taht height..look at her next to dicaprio. he was always taller than her.\n\nHowever, his new girlfriend, Toni Garnn actually seems a bit taller than him and is actually listed as shorter than BÃ¼ndchen (Garrn at 178)..\n\nso a bit of a contradiction\n\nOriginal said on 11/Apr/13\n\n5'9.75\" or a full 5'10\", not shorter.\n\nDeDe said on 28/Jan/13\n\nRob please could you do a height for Stephanie Seymour\n\nSinead Finn said on 21/Oct/12\n\nRob, pls do a height page for supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio.\n\nsteven said on 20/Oct/12\n\nShe can't be over 5 feet 9. She was at an event recently and next to the backdrop, Karlie Kloss (who is listed at 6 foot 1 but is taller than that), was at least 5 inches taller. Look at wireimage.com\n\nJess said on 4/Sep/12\n\nShe's no more than 5'10\". She's the exact same height as Adriana Lima maybe a hair shorter. She looks taller than she is because she has a lean figure with no hips and very shapely legs. So she looks very long and lean. But when you look at her next to the 5'11\" and taller models you can definitely see the difference."
