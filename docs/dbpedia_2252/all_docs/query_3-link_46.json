        "text": "One of my favorite pastimes as a beauty editor is to ask other people about their beauty routines, whether it's my best friends, a total stranger at Sephora (I'm nosy AF), or in this case, a supermodel. I absolutely love my job, but after years of being exposed to new products day in and day out, it can be easy to become jaded, and sometimes, I just need a little inspiration in the beauty department, especially when there's a brand-new year just around the corner.\n\nLike editors, models are also constantly surrounded by products galore, so I asked Brazilian supermodel Lais Ribeiro for the lowdown on her current roster of products. If you've also found yourself in a bit of a beauty rut lately, keep scrolling. Ribeiro's top beauty recommendations—from skin-smoothing pillowcases to the Rolls-Royce of ice rollers—are just below. Enjoy!\n\nRalph Lauren\n\nRalph's Club Elixir Spray\n\n\"My go-to fragrance is the Ralph Lauren Club Elixir. The scent has a very masculine aroma to it. I love how sleek and sophisticated it is. It’s the perfect scent to put in rotation that will elevate your evening.”\n\nNativa SPA\n\nQuinoa Firming Body Oil\n\n\"I’ve recently started using the Quinoa Firming Body Oil from Nativa Spa on a daily basis. Quinoa oil contains 30 times more omegas than coconut oil and leaves my skin so smooth after I use it. This oil is especially great during these colder winter months, as it gives deep hydration and is amazing for the skin barrier and overall skin firmness.”\n\nLaneige\n\nLip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C\n\n\"I’ve been using the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask for a while now, and it’s been the only product I’ve found that will keep my lips moisturized throughout the night.”\n\nHigherDose\n\nRed Light Face Mask\n\n\"The HigherDose Red Light Face Mask has been one of my favorite skincare investments. It’s very easy and simple to use. Red light therapy is great for your skin and body, and I love how it makes my skin glow after each use.”\n\nDr. Barbara Sturm\n\nAnti-Pollution Drops\n\n\"I’ve used many Dr. Barbara Sturm products, and the Anti-Pollution Drops have always been one of my favorites. It strengthens your skin and is good for protecting against pollution and anti-aging.”\n\nNativa Spa\n\nGua Sha Stone\n\n\"I use a gua sha stone from Nativa Spa, which I always pair with their oils. If you’re familiar with using the gua sha, you know how great it is for helping tone and lift skin. Investing in a quality stone can make a day-and-night difference.”\n\nTouch Me\n\n100% Natural Boar Bristle Body Brush\n\n\"I dry-brush my body daily with oils. It’s great for exfoliating the skin and for lymphatic drainage. It’s a simple yet effective practice to upgrade your self-care in the New Year.”\n\nEstée Lauder\n\nAdvanced Night Repair Concentrated Treatment Mask\n\n\"I love using the Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Mask. I’ve used it for many years, and it has also been a go-to when prepping for shoots. It helps smooth out fine lines and put light back into tired or stressed skin.”\n\nCharlotte Tilbury\n\nPillow Talk Beautifying Lip and Cheek Secrets Gift Set\n\n\"I love wearing the Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk lip color. I’m constantly having to restock from using it so much. The color goes well on my lips and complements my skin tone. It’s a timeless pink hue and a great staple for any makeup lover.”\n\nDr. Barbara Sturm\n\nDarker Skin Tones Face Cream\n\n\"I use Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Darker Skin Tones range. I love her products, especially the products formulated for dark skin. This face cream helps refine pores and leaves my skin super moisturized.”\n\nKitsch\n\nSatin Pillowcase\n\n\"These pillowcases give you more than just a comfortable night’s sleep. I’ve been able to see the difference in my skin and hair since using one. It helps with hair breakage and also helps keep your skin smooth.”\n\nPeter Thomas Roth\n\nWater Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Hydra-Gel Eye Patches\n\n\"I love using under-eye masks when traveling. I think they are so helpful for de-puffing the face and skin and also making it glowy.”\n\nThe Skinny Confidential\n\nHot Mess Ice Roller\n\n\"This ice roller is incredible. It is so refreshing on my face and wakes me up in the morning. Ice rolling your face helps with de-puffing and leaves your face looking more sculpted.”\n\nCosta Brazil\n\nSol Sunlight Body Oil\n\n\"I love this sustainable beauty line from Brazil. All products are made from ingredients from Amazon. The Sunlight Body Oil has such a warm, inviting aroma that smells like the forest itself.”\n\nNuFace\n\nMini Starter Kit\n\n\"I really like how quick and convenient this device is. It’s a great tool to sculpt your face and cheekbone area. We’re past the holiday season, but this still makes a great gift for someone looking to up their self-care game.”\n\nErin has been writing a mix of beauty and wellness content for Who What Wear for over four years. Prior to that, she spent two and half years writing for Byrdie. She now calls Santa Monica home but grew up in Minnetonka, Minnesota, and studied writing, rhetoric, and communication at University of Wisconsin, La Crosse. She studied abroad in Galway, Ireland, and spent a summer in L.A. interning with the Byrdie and Who What Wear family. After graduating from UW, she spent one year in San Francisco, where she worked as a writer for Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen before moving down to L.A. to begin her career as a beauty editor. She considers her day-to-day beauty aesthetic very low-maintenance and relies on staples like clear brow serum (from Kimiko!), Lawless's Lip Plumping Mask in Cherry Vanilla, and an eyelash curler. For special occasions or days when she's taking more meetings or has an event, she'll wear anything and everything from Charlotte Tilbury (the foundations are game-changing), some shimmer on her lids (Stila and Róen do it best), and a few coats of the best mascara-type product on earth, Surratt's Noir Lash Tint."
