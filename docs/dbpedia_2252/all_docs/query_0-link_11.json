        "text": "Maize and resistant starch enriched breads reduce postprandial glycemic responses in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrites, Carla M; Trigo, Maria J; CarrapiÃ§o, Belmira; AlviÃ±a, Marcela; Bessa, Rui J\n\n2011-04-01\n\nWhite wheat bread is a poor source of dietary fiber, typically containing less than 2%. A demand exists for the development of breads with starch that is slowly digestible or partially resistant to the digestive process. The utilization of maize flour and resistant starch is expected to reduce the release and absorption of glucose and, hence, lower the glycemic index of bread. This study was undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that a diet of maize bread, as produced and consumed in Portugal, would have beneficial metabolic effects on rats compared to white wheat bread. We also hypothesized that the effect of resistant starch on glycemic response could be altered by the use of different formulations and breadmaking processes for wheat and maize breads. Resistant starch (RS) was incorporated into formulations of breads at 20% of the inclusion rate of wheat and maize flours. Assays were conducted with male Wistar rats (n = 36), divided into four groups and fed either wheat bread, RS-wheat bread, maize bread, and RS-maize bread to evaluate feed intake, body weight gain, fecal pH, and postprandial blood glucose response (glycemic response). Blood triglycerides, total cholesterol concentrations, and liver weights were also determined. The maize bread group presented higher body weight gain and cholesterol level, lower fecal pH, and postprandial blood glucose response than the wheat bread group. The RS-wheat bread group showed significant reductions in feed intake, fecal pH, postprandial blood glucose response, and total cholesterol. The RS-maize group displayed significant reductions of body weight gain, fecal pH, and total cholesterol levels; however, for the glycemic response, only a reduction in fasting level was observed. These results suggest that maize bread has a lower glycemic index than wheat bread, and the magnitude of the effect of RS on glycemic response depends of type of bread.

Objective: We determined the effect of meals that varied in macronutrient composition on the glycemic response and determination of GI and GL values of a subsequent standard test food. Design: Twenty healthy participants underwent 6 test sessions within 12 wk. The subjects received each of 3 isocaloric breakfast meals (i.e., high carbohydrate, high fat, or high protein) on separate days in a random order, which was followed by a standard set of challenges (i.e., white bread and a glucose drink) that were tested on separate days in a random order 4 h thereafter. Each challenge provided 50 g available carbohydrate. Arterialized venous blood was sampled throughout the 2-h postchallenge period. GI, GL, and insulin index (II) values were calculated with the use of the incremental area under the curve (AUC i ) method, and serum lipids were determined with the use of standard assays. Results: The consumption of the high-protein breakfast before the white-bread challenge attenuated the rise in the postprandial serum glucose response ( P < 0.0001) and resulted in lower glucose AUC i ( P < 0.0001), GI ( P = 0.0096), and GL ( P = 0.0101) values than did the high-carbohydrate and high-fat breakfasts. The high-protein breakfast resulted in a lower insulin AUC i ( P = 0.0146) for white bread than did the high-fat breakfast and a lower II value ( P = 0.0285) than did the high-carbohydrate breakfast. The 3 breakfasts resulted in similar serum lipid responses to the white-bread challenge. Conclusions: These data indicate that the macronutrient composition of the prior meal influences the glycemic response and the determination of GI and GL values for white bread. Future studies are needed to determine whether the background food macronutrient composition influences mean dietary GI and GL values that are\n\nCr-enriched yeast: beyond fibers for the management of postprandial glycemic response to bread.\n\nPubMed\n\nYanni, Amalia E; Stamataki, Nikoleta; Stoupaki, Maria; Konstantopoulos, Panagiotis; Pateras, Irene; Tentolouris, Nikolaos; Perrea, Despoina; T Karathanos, Vaios\n\n2017-06-01\n\nEfforts regarding the amelioration of postprandial glycemic response to bread are mainly focused in the addition of soluble dietary fibers. The current study presents another approach which is based on the supplementation of flour with Cr-enriched yeast. Cr is known for its beneficial effects on improvement of glucose tolerance and enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Twelve normoglycemic subjects were provided with white bread (WB, reference food) or whole wheat bread with Cr-enriched yeast (WWCrB, rich in insoluble fibers) or white wheat bread with Cr-enriched yeast (WCrB, poor in fibers) or whole wheat-rye-barley bread enriched with oat beta glucans (BGB, rich in soluble fibers) with 1-week intervals in amounts that yielded 50Â g of available carbohydrates. Postprandial glucose, insulin and ghrelin responses as well as glycemic index (GI) were evaluated. Ingestion of WWCrB, WCrB and BGB elicited lower incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for 120-min glycemic response compared to WB (1033.02Â Â±Â 282.32, 701.69Â Â±Â 330.86 and 748.95Â Â±Â 185.42 vs 2070.87Â Â±Â 518.44Â mg/dLÂ min, respectively, PÂ <Â 0.05 for WCrB and BGB). The GI was calculated as 62.35Â Â±Â 11.78 for WWCrB, 34.22Â Â±Â 11.93 for WCrB and 37.90Â Â±Â 5.00 for BGB (PÂ <Â 0.05 vs WB, GIÂ =Â 100). iAUC for 120-min insulin response to BGB was significantly lower than WB (2780.04Â Â±Â 303.26 vs 3915.53Â Â±Â 490.57Â Î¼U/mLÂ min, PÂ <Â 0.05), while ghrelin remained suppressed for almost 120Â min after the consumption of WWCrB and BGB. Supplementation of flour with Cr-enriched yeast induces milder postprandial glycemic response to bread without the necessity of high fiber amounts, providing with another strategy for the management of glycemic control.\n\nLow-glycemic load decreases postprandial insulin and glucose and increases postprandial ghrelin in white but not black women.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrownley, Kimberly A; Heymen, Steve; Hinderliter, Alan L; Galanko, Joseph; Macintosh, Beth\n\n2012-07-01\n\nAlterations in appetite hormones favoring increased postprandial satiety have been implicated in both the glycemic control and potential weight-loss benefits of a low-glycemic diet. Racial differences exist in dietary glycemic load and appetite hormone concentrations. This study examined the impact of glycemic load on appetite hormones in 20 black women [10 normal weight, BMI = 22.8 Â± 1.42 (mean Â± SD); 10 obese, BMI = 35.1 Â± 2.77] and 20 white women (10 normal weight, BMI = 22.9 Â± 1.45; 10 obese, BMI = 34.3 Â± 2.77). Each woman completed two 4.5-d weight-maintenance, mixed-macronutrient, high-glycemic vs. low-glycemic load diets that concluded with a test meal of identical composition. Blood samples collected before and serially for 3 h after each test meal were assayed for plasma ghrelin and serum insulin and glucose concentrations. Compared with the high-glycemic load meal, the low-glycemic load meal was associated with lower insulin(AUC) (P = 0.02), glucose(AUC) (P = 0.01), and urge to eat ratings (P = 0.05) but with higher ghrelin(AUC) (P = 0.008). These results suggest the satiating effect of a low-glycemic load meal is not directly linked to enhanced postprandial suppression of ghrelin. Notably, these effects were significant among white but not black women, suggesting that black women may be less sensitive than white women to the glucoregulatory effects of a low-glycemic load. These findings add to a growing literature demonstrating racial differences in postprandial appetite hormone responses. If reproducible, these findings have implications for individualized diet prescription for the purposes of glucose or weight control in women.\n\nOrange pomace improves postprandial glycemic responses: an acute, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial in overweight men\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nOrange pomace (OP), a fiber-rich byproduct of juice production, has the potential for being formulated into a variety of food products. We hypothesized that OP would diminish postprandial glycemic responses to a high carbohydrate/fat breakfast and lunch. We conducted an acute, randomized, placebo-co...\n\nHigh Amylose White Rice Reduces Post-Prandial Glycemic Response but Not Appetite in Humans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZenel, Alison M.; Stewart, Maria L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe present study compared the effects of three rice cultivars on postprandial glycemic control and appetite. A single-blind, randomized, crossover clinical trial was performed with 18 healthy subjects, nine males and nine females. Three treatments were administered at three separate study visits: commercially available conventional white rice (short grain), specialty high amylose white rice 1 (Dixiebelle), and specialty high amylose white rice 2 (Rondo). Postprandial capillary blood glucose, venous blood glucose and insulin measurements, and appetite visual analog scale (VAS) surveys were done over the course of two hours. The capillary blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower for Rondo compared to short grain rice at 30 min, and for Dixiebelle and Rondo compared to short grain rice at 45, 60, and 120 min. Capillary blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) was significantly lower for Dixiebelle and Rondo compared to short grain rice. Subjects were significantly more hungry at 30 min after Dixiebelle intake than Rondo intake, but there were no other significant effects in appetite ratings. The present study determined that intake of high amylose rice with resistant starch (RS) can attenuate postprandial blood glucose and insulin response in comparison to short grain rice.

The jam containing the highest ratio of glucose showed a high GI, while that containing a high ratio of fructose, a jam made from polydextrose, showed a low GI. There was a high correlation (r=0.969, p=0.006) between the GI and the predicted GI calculated from the sugar composition of the jams. Moreover, the influence on postprandial blood glucose response after an intake of only 20 g of jam and one slice of bread with 20 g jam was measured in 8 healthy adults. The blood glucose level after an intake of 20 g of the high GI jam containing the high glucose ratio was higher than that of other jams at 15 min, but there was no significant difference after 30 min. Regardless of whether the GI was low or high, differences in the jams were not observed in the postprandial blood glucose level or the area under the curve after eating either one slice of bread (60 g) or one slice of bread with less than 20 g of jam.\n\nEffects of a beverage containing an enzymatically induced-viscosity dietary fiber, with or without fructose, on the postprandial glycemic response to a high glycemic index food in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nWolf, B W; Wolever, T M S; Lai, C S; Bolognesi, C; Radmard, R; Maharry, K S; Garleb, K A; Hertzler, S R; Firkins, J L\n\n2003-09-01\n\nDietary supplementation with guar gum or fructose has been reported to reduce the postprandial glycemic response to an oral glucose challenge. As a result of the poor palatability of most foods containing guar gum, a novel low-viscosity beverage with guar gum was developed that becomes viscous in vivo through an enzymatic induction. The primary study objective was to determine the effect of an amylase-induced viscosity (I-V) product, with or without supplemental fructose, on the postprandial glycemic response to a high glycemic index test meal in healthy nondiabetic subjects. The study was a four-treatment, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized block protocol. The study was performed at Glycaemic Index Testing, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A total of 30 healthy nondiabetic volunteers (13 male, 17 female, mean+/-s.e.m. age of 51+/-3 y and body mass index of 24.2+/-0.4 kg/m(2)) participated in the study. In the morning after an overnight fast, subjects participated in four 3-h meal glucose tolerance tests on separate occasions. The test meals contained 50 g of available carbohydrate from maltodextrin and white bread (control) or the same meal with either 5 g of guar gum (3.6 g galactomannan), 5 g of fructose, or 5 g of guar gum +5 g of fructose. Treatments containing guar gum had a reduced (P<0.01) baseline-adjusted peak glucose response and incremental area under the glucose curve. In contrast to previous studies, fructose increased (P<0.05) the baseline-adjusted peak glucose concentration. Guar gum incorporated into an amylase I-V product provided a means to stabilize blood glucose levels by reducing the early phase excursion and then by appropriately maintaining the later phase excursion in healthy nondiabetic humans.\n\nAcute effects of different dietary polysaccharides added in milk on food intake, postprandial appetite and glycemic responses in healthy young females.\n\nPubMed\n\nArshad, Muhammad Umair; Ishtiaq, Saima; Anjum, Faqir Muhammad; Saeed, Farhan; Chatha, Shahzad Ali Shahid; Imran, Ali\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn the present study we compared the postprandial glycemic and satiety responses of different dietary polysaccharides when added in milk (2% M.F.). The objective of this study was to evaluate different polysaccharides against postprandial glucose, appetite responses and food intake at subsequent meal. In a repeated measures design, 30 females (18-30 years) consumed 250âml milk 2% M.F. (control), or milk with carrageenan (2.5âg), guar gum (2.5âg) and alginate (2.5âg), followed by an ad libitum pizza meal after 120âmin. Alginate and guar gum addition resulted in lower caloric intake at subsequent pizza meal. The post-treatment (0-120âmin) glucose and average appetite were suppressed by alginate and guar gum (pâ<â0.0001), with more pronounced effect of guar gum. However, alginate resulted in lower blood glucose (pâ<â0.0001) compared with control and carrageenan during post-treatment. Alginate and guar gum added beverages would be beneficial in short-term regulation of postprandial glycemia and satiety.\n\nPostprandial glucose response to selected tropical fruits in normal glucose-tolerant Nigerians.\n\nPubMed\n\nEdo, A; Eregie, A; Adediran, O; Ohwovoriole, A; Ebengho, S\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe glycemic response to commonly eaten fruits in Nigeria has not been reported. Therefore, this study assessed the plasma glucose response to selected fruits in Nigeria. Ten normal glucose-tolerant subjects randomly consumed 50 g carbohydrate portions of three fruits: banana (Musa paradisiaca), pineapple (Ananus comosus), and pawpaw (Carica papaya), and a 50-g glucose load at 1-week intervals. Blood samples were collected in the fasting state and half-hourly over a 2-h period post-ingestion of the fruits or glucose. The samples were analyzed for plasma glucose concentrations. Plasma glucose responses were assessed by the peak plasma glucose concentration, maximum increase in plasma glucose, 2-h postprandial plasma glucose level, and incremental area under the glucose curve and glycemic index (GI). The results showed that the blood glucose response to these three fruits was similar in terms of their incremental areas under the glucose curve, maximum increase in plasma glucose, and glycemic indices (GIs). The 2-h postprandial plasma glucose level of banana was significantly higher than that of pineapple, P < 0.025. The mean Â± SEM GI values were as follows: pawpaw; 86 Â± 26.8%; banana, 75.1 Â± 21.8%; pineapple, 64.5 Â± 11.3%. The GI of glucose is taken as 100. The GI of pineapple was significantly lower than that of glucose (P < 0.05). Banana, pawpaw, and pineapple produced a similar postprandial glucose response. Measured portions of these fruits may be used as fruit exchanges with pineapple having the most favorable glycemic response.\n\nEffect of Processing on Postprandial Glycemic Response and Consumer Acceptability of Lentil-Containing Food Items.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamdath, D Dan; Wolever, Thomas M S; Siow, Yaw Chris; Ryland, Donna; Hawke, Aileen; Taylor, Carla; Zahradka, Peter; Aliani, Michel\n\n2018-05-11\n\nThe consumption of pulses is associated with many health benefits. This study assessed post-prandial blood glucose response (PPBG) and the acceptability of food items containing green lentils. In human trials we: (i) defined processing methods (boiling, pureeing, freezing, roasting, spray-drying) that preserve the PPBG-lowering feature of lentils; (ii) used an appropriate processing method to prepare lentil food items, and compared the PPBG and relative glycemic responses (RGR) of lentil and control foods; and (iii) conducted consumer acceptability of the lentil foods. Eight food items were formulated from either whole lentil puree (test) or instant potato (control). In separate PPBG studies, participants consumed fixed amounts of available carbohydrates from test foods, control foods, or a white bread standard. Finger prick blood samples were obtained at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after the first bite, analyzed for glucose, and used to calculate incremental area under the blood glucose response curve and RGR; glycemic index (GI) was measured only for processed lentils. Mean GI (Â± standard error of the mean) of processed lentils ranged from 25 Â± 3 (boiled) to 66 Â± 6 (spray-dried); the GI of spray-dried lentils was significantly ( p < 0.05) higher than boiled, pureed, or roasted lentil. Overall, lentil-based food items all elicited significantly lower RGR compared to potato-based items (40 Â± 3 vs. 73 Â± 3%; p < 0.001). Apricot chicken, chicken pot pie, and lemony parsley soup had the highest overall acceptability corresponding to \"like slightly\" to \"like moderately\". Processing influenced the PPBG of lentils, but food items formulated from lentil puree significantly attenuated PPBG. Formulation was associated with significant differences in sensory attributes.\n\nPostprandial walking is better for lowering the glycemic effect of dinner than pre-dinner exercise in type 2 diabetic individuals.\n\nPubMed\n\nColberg, Sheri R; Zarrabi, Lida; Bennington, Linda; Nakave, Abhijeet; Thomas Somma, C; Swain, David P; Sechrist, Scott R\n\n2009-07-01\n\nIn prior studies of exercise done before or after breakfast and lunch, postprandial activity generally reduces glycemia more than pre-meal. This study sought to examine the effects of exercise before or after an evening meal. Examined the differing effects of a single bout of pre- or postprandial moderate exercise or no exercise on the glycemic response to an evening (dinner) meal in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Community-dwelling participants tested at a research university in Virginia. Twelve men and women subjects (mean age of 61.4+/-2.7 years) with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and/or oral medications. Three trials conducted on separate days consisting of a rest day when subjects consumed a standardized dinner with a moderate glycemic effect and 2 exercise days when they undertook 20 minutes of self-paced treadmill walking immediately before or 15 to 20 minutes after eating. Blood samples taken every 30 minutes over a 4-hour period and later assayed for plasma glucose; from these data both absolute and relative changes in glucose levels were determined, as well as the total glucose area under the curve (AUC) of the 4-hour testing period. Initial samples were additionally assayed for glycated hemoglobin and lipid levels. Twenty minutes of self-paced walking done shortly after meal consumption resulted in lower plasma glucose levels at the end of exercise compared to values at the same time point when subjects had walked pre-dinner. Total glucose AUC over 4-hours was not significantly different among trials. Postprandial walking may be more effective at lowering the glycemic impact of the evening meal in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with pre-meal or no exercise and may be an effective means to blunt postprandial glycemic excursions.\n\nEffect of Processing on Postprandial Glycemic Response and Consumer Acceptability of Lentil-Containing Food Items\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWolever, Thomas M.

Nonetheless, it is hardly achieved in practice, which results in several diabetes-related complications. In this study we present a feedforward plus feedback blood glucose control system that considers the glycemic index of foods. It consists of a preprandial insulin bolus whose optimal bolus dose and timing are stated as a minimization problem, which is followed by a postprandial closed-loop control based on model predictive control. Simulation results show that, for a representative carbohydrate intake of 50 g, the present control system is able to maintain postprandial glycemia below 140 mg/dL while preventing postprandial hypoglycemia as well.\n\nHuman glycemic response and phenolic content of unsweetened cranberry juice.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, Ted; Singh, Ajay P; Vorsa, Nicholi; Goettl, Christopher D; Kittleson, Katrina M; Roe, Cindy M; Kastello, Gary M; Ragsdale, Frances R\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThis cross-sectional study determined the phenolic composition of an over-the-counter cranberry juice (CBJ) with high-performance liquid chromatography and examined the effects of low- and normal-calorie CBJ formulations on the postprandial glycemic response in healthy humans. The CBJ used in this study contained seven phenolic acids, with 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acid being the primary components, and 15 flavonol glycosides, with myricetin-3-galactoside and quercetin-3-galactoside being the most prevalent. CBJ proanthocyanidins consisted of three different tetramers and a heptamer, which were confirmed with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry analysis. Participants received one of the following six treatments: nothing (no water/beverage), water (480 mL), unsweetened low-calorie CBJ (38 Cal/480 mL), normal-calorie CBJ (280 Cal/480 mL), isocaloric normal calorie (high fructose corn syrup [HFCS]), or isocaloric low-calorie beverages. No significant differences in postprandial blood glucose or insulin were observed in the groups receiving nothing, water, or low-calorie treatments. In contrast, the ingestion of normal-calorie CBJ and normal-calorie control beverage resulted in significantly higher blood glucose concentrations 30 minutes postprandially, although the differences were no longer significant after 180 minutes. Plasma insulin of normal-calorie CBJ and control (HFCS) recipients was significantly higher 60 minutes postprandially, but not significantly different 120 minutes postprandially. CBJ ingestion did not affect heart rate or blood pressure. This study suggests that the consumption of a low-calorie CBJ rich in previously uncharacterized trimer and heptamer proanthocyanidins is associated with a favorable glycemic response and may be beneficial for persons with impaired glucose tolerance.\n\nImpact of improving postprandial glycemic control with intensifying insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nYacoub, Tamer\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWorldwide, many people with type 2 diabetes are not at recommended glycemic targets and remain at increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Reaching recommended glycemic targets requires normalizing both fasting and postprandial glucose (PPG). For some patients, this will require addition of a prandial insulin delivered by injection to control PPG excursions. Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests an association between postprandial hyperglycemia and cardiovascular disease, and thus, expert guidelines recommend that treatment for elevated PPG not be delayed. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that PPG makes the greatest contribution to HbA 1c in patients who are approaching, but have not yet reached HbA 1c <7.0%. Appropriately timed exposure of the liver to insulin is critical in suppressing hepatic glucose output (and therefore PPG levels) after a meal. Rapid-acting insulin analogs, with their faster onset and shorter duration of action, offer advantages over regular human insulin. Unfortunately, even with improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics, rapid-acting insulin analogs are still unable to fully reproduce the rapid release of insulin into the portal circulation and suppression of hepatic glucose output that occurs in the individual without diabetes after starting a meal. The next generation of rapid-acting insulin analogs will have an even more favorable pharmacokinetic profile that should allow patients to further improve glycemic control. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) represents another option for intensifying therapy and improving postprandial control in some patients, and studies have shown that the benefits are sustainable long-term. However, it is currently unclear which patients stand to benefit the most from the extra expense and complexity of a CSII regimen, and further studies are needed.\n\nPhysical Form of Dietary Fat Alters Postprandial Substrate Utilization and Glycemic Response in Healthy Chinese Men.\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, Sze-Yen; Peh, Elaine; Lau, Evelyn; Marangoni, Alejandro G; Henry, Christiani Jeyakumar\n\n2017-06-01\n\nBackground: Dietary fats elicit various physiological responses, with the physical form of fat reported to alter fat digestion and absorption. Objectives: The primary aims were to compare the effects of dietary fat in 2 physical forms (liquid and oleogel) and 2 degrees of saturation (saturated and polyunsaturated) on postprandial energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation, glycemia, and appetite. Methods: The study was a randomized, controlled crossover trial. Sixteen normal-weight, healthy Chinese men completed the study [mean Â± SD age: 28 Â± 6 y; body mass index (in kg/m 2 ): 22.9 Â± 3.1]. After an overnight fast, participants had their body weight measured and entered an indirect whole-room calorimeter (WRC). After baseline measurements, participants consumed orange juice and rice porridge alone (control), with 22.25 g coconut oil or sunflower oil or with 25 g coconut oleogel or sunflower oleogel in random order with a 5-d washout period between treatments. EE, substrate oxidation, capillary blood glucose, and appetite were measured over 195 min in a WRC. Participants completed a meal challenge to assess appetite. Test meals effects were compared by using repeated-measures ANOVA. Results: Fat saturation did not affect all study outcomes significantly. When data were pooled based on the physical form of dietary fat, EE did not differ. However, significantly higher carbohydrate oxidation ( P = 0.03) and a trend of lower fat oxidation ( P = 0.07) were found after the liquid oil than after the oleogel or control treatments. Postprandial capillary glucose was also significantly lower after the liquid oil than after the oleogel or control treatments ( P < 0.001). Appetite was not affected by the physical form and the saturation of dietary fats. Conclusions: The saturation of dietary fat did not affect postprandial glucose, EE, substrate oxidation, or appetite.

This study aimed to compare the effects of nateglinide and acarbose treatments on postprandial glycemic excursions in Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes. This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group study. One hundred three antihyperglycemic agent-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c range, 6.5-9.0%) were prospectively recruited from four hospitals in China. The intervention was nateglinide (120âmg three times a day) or acarbose (50âmg three times a day) therapy for 2 weeks. A continuous glucose monitoring system was used to calculate the incremental area under the curve of postprandial blood glucose (AUCpp), the incremental glucose peak (IGP), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions, SD of blood glucose, the mean of daily differences, and 24-h mean blood glucose (MBG). Subjects' serum glycated albumin and the plasma insulin levels were also analyzed. Both agents caused significant reductions on AUCpp and IGP. Similarly, both treatment groups showed significant improvements in the intra- and interday glycemic excursions, as well as the 24-h MBG and serum glycated albumin compared with baseline (P<0.001). However, neither of the agents produced a significantly better effect (P>0.05). Moreover, the nateglinide-treated group had significantly increased insulin levels at 30âmin and at 120âmin after a standard meal compared with baseline, whereas the acarbose-treated group decreased. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. The rates of hypoglycemic episodes were comparable in the two groups, and no severe hypoglycemic episode occurred in either group. Nateglinide and acarbose were comparably effective in reducing postprandial glycemic excursions in antihyperglycemic agent-naive Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes, possibly through different pathophysiological mechanisms.\n\nNateglinide and Acarbose Are Comparably Effective Reducers of Postprandial Glycemic Excursions in Chinese Antihyperglycemic AgentâNaive Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhou, Jian; Li, Hong; Zhang, Xiuzhen; Peng, Yongde; Mo, Yifei; Bao, Yuqian\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAbstract Background Recent studies have identified postprandial glycemic excursions as risk factors for diabetes complications.

Objectives: We tested whether pomegranate polyphenols could lower the glycemic response of a high-glycemic index food when consumed together and the mechanism by which this might occur. Design: We compared the acute effect of a pomegranate juice and a polyphenol-rich extract from pomegranate (supplement) on the bread-derived postprandial blood glucose concentration in 2 randomized, crossover, controlled studies (double-blinded for the supplements), each on 16 healthy volunteers. An additional randomized, crossover, controlled study on 16 volunteers consuming constituent fruit acids in a pH-balanced solution (same pH as pomegranate) and bread was conducted to determine any contributions to postprandial responses caused by acidic beverages. Results: As primary outcome, the incremental area under the curve for bread-derived blood glucose (-33.1% Â± 18.1%, P = 0.000005) and peak blood glucose (25.4% Â± 19.3%, P = 0.0004) were attenuated by pomegranate juice, compared with a control solution containing the equivalent amount of sugars. In contrast, the pomegranate supplement, or a solution containing the malic and citric acid components of the juice, was ineffective. The pomegranate polyphenol punicalagin was a very effective inhibitor of human Î±-amylase in vitro, comparable to the drug acarbose. Neither the pomegranate extract nor the individual component polyphenols inhibited 14 C-D-glucose transport across differentiated Caco-2/TC7 cell monolayers, but they inhibited uptake of 14 C-glucose into Xenopus oocytes expressing the human glucose transporter type 2. Further, some of the predicted pomegranate gut microbiota metabolites modulated 14 C-D-glucose and 14 C-deoxy-D-glucose uptake into hepatic HepG2 cells. Conclusions: These data indicate that pomegranate polyphenols, when present in a beverage but not in a supplement, can reduce the\n\nEffect of low glycemic index food and postprandial exercise on blood glucose level, oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity.\n\nPubMed\n\nKasuya, Noriaki; Ohta, Shoichiro; Takanami, Yoshikazu; Kawai, Yukari; Inoue, Yutaka; Murata, Isamu; Kanamoto, Ikuo\n\n2015-04-01\n\nLow glycemic index (GI) food and postprandial exercise are non-drug therapies for improving postprandial hyperglycemia. The present randomized, crossover study investigated the effect of low GI food combined with postprandial exercise on postprandial blood glucose level, oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity. A total of 13 healthy subjects were each used in four experiments: i) rice only (control), ii) salad prior to rice (LGI), iii) exercise following rice (EX) and iv) salad prior to rice and exercise following rice (MIX). The blood glucose level, oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity were then measured. At 60 min after the meal, the blood glucose level was observed to be increased in the MIX group compared with that in the LGI group. Furthermore, at 180 min, the antioxidant capacity was found to be reduced in the MIX group compared with those of the LGI and EX groups. These findings suggest that low GI food combined with postprandial exercise does not improve postprandial hyperglycemia. It may be necessary to establish optimal timing and intensity when combining low GI food with postprandial exercise to improve postprandial hyperglycemia.\n\nPostprandial glycemic response to orange juice and nondiet cola: is there a difference?\n\nPubMed\n\nSullivan, M J; Scott, R L\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the effects of unsweetened fruit juice and regular, decaffeinated soda on postprandial serum glucose levels in individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) when these liquids are ingested separately as part of mixed meals. Eighteen individuals with NIDDM consumed three test breakfasts calculated using the diabetic exchange meal-planning system. Foods were identical in each of the breakfasts except for foods in the fruit exchange. Carbohydrate-equivalent amounts of fresh orange slices, unsweetened orange juice, and regular, decaffeinated Coke were consumed in breakfasts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Serum glucose samples were drawn at fasting and 1, 2, and 3 hours postprandially. No difference was found in the postprandial serum glucose response when Coke versus orange juice was consumed in the breakfast. These findings question the appropriateness of using unsweetened fruit juices in routine meal planning for individuals with NIDDM.\n\nIncreased glycemic variability and decrease of the postprandial glucose contribution to HbA1c in obese subjects across the glycemic continuum from normal glycemia to first time diagnosed diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nFysekidis, Marinos; Cosson, Emmanuel; Banu, Isabela; Duteil, RÃ©gine; Cyrille, Chantal; Valensi, Paul\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe contribution of postprandial glycemia (PPG) to hyperglycemia has been shown to decrease as HbA1c increased in type 2 diabetic patients. This study aimed at examining, in a series of overweight/obese patients without known glycemic disorder, the contribution of PPG to a \"relative\" hyperglycemia (glucose valuesâ¥5.5 mmol/L) and the presence of glycemic variability according to HbA1c levels. Seventy overweight/obese inpatients (body mass index 35.2Â±6.8 kg/m2) without known glycemic disorder were included. Participants were classified according to an oral glucose tolerance test (according to the American Diabetes Association criteria) as patients with normoglycemia (n=33), with intermediate hyperglycemia (n=24) or diabetes (n=13). They were separated into HbA1c quartiles (Q1 to Q4). A 24 hour continuous glucose monitoring was used under a 1800 kcal diet and minimal physical activity. We assessed PPG contribution (3 hour period after each meal) to the \"relative\" 24 hour hyperglycemia (glucose values â¥5.5 mmol/L); the remaining time was considered as the fasting/post-absorptive period. HbA1c range was from 5.1% to 7.4% (32 to 57 mmol/mmol). From the lowest to the highest HbA1c quartile, the area under the curve (AUC) for the \"relative\" hyperglycemia presented a 17-fold increase for the fasting/post-absorptive (p<0.001) period and a 7-fold increase postprandially (p<0.001). The percent of PPG contribution to the \"relative\" hyperglycemia was calculated with the following formula [100Ã(postprandial 3 hour AUC-3 h AUC for a constant 5.5 mmol/L glycemia)/(total 24 h AUC-24 h AUC for constant 5. 5 mmol/L glycemia)] and decreased from Q1 to Q4 of HbA1c (81.2%, 66%, 65.8%, 57%; p<0.001). Increasing HbA1c quartiles were associated with higher daily mean blood glucose level (p<0.001) and higher levels of daily glucose variability indices, including mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (p<0.01). In overweight/obese patients, HbA1c was associated with lower PPG\n\nGlycemic Response to Black Beans and Chickpeas as Part of a Rice Meal: A Randomized Cross-Over Trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nWinham, Donna M; Hutchins, Andrea M; Thompson, Sharon V\n\n2017-10-04\n\nLegumes, such as black beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and chickpeas ( Cicer arietinum L.), have a low glycemic index, and may reduce the glycemic load of meals in which they are included. Although the low glycemic response of beans consumed alone has been documented, few studies have examined the glycemic response to traditional food combinations such as black beans and rice or chickpeas and rice. This randomized cross-over study examined the glycemic and insulinemic impact of 50 grams of available carbohydrate from three test meals: plain white rice (control), black beans with rice, and chickpeas with rice among healthy adult women ( n = 12, 18-65 years). Treatments were consumed on different mornings, a minimum of 7 days apart. Blood samples were collected at time 0 (fasting), and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min postprandial, and were subsequently analyzed for glucose and insulin concentrations. Glucose response based on the incremental area under the curve showed a significant difference by treatment ( p = 0.027). Changes in blood glucose concentrations were significantly different for the black bean meal and the chickpea meal in comparison to rice alone at 60 min ( p = 0.026 and p = 0.024), 90 min ( p = 0.001 and p = 0.012) and 120 min post prandial ( p = 0.024; black bean meal). Findings indicate that combinations of black beans and chickpeas with white rice improve glycemic response, providing evidence that has promising implications for dietary guidance to reduce postprandial glucose and related health risks through traditional food patterns.\n\nA Randomized Trial about Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load Improves Outcomes among Adults with Type 2 Diabetes\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMiller, Carla K.; Gutschall, Melissa\n\n2009-01-01\n\nGlycemic index (GI) represents the postprandial glucose response of carbohydrate foods, and glycemic load (GL) represents the quantity and quality of carbohydrate consumed. A diet lower in GI and GL may improve diabetes management.

We varied the wheat particle size to obtain fiber-rich breads with a high and low glycemic response and investigated the differences in postprandial glucose kinetics and metabolic response after their consumption. Ten healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized, crossover study, consuming 13 C-enriched breads with different structures; a control bread (CB) made from wheat flour combined with wheat bran, and a kernel bread (KB) where 85Â % of flour was substituted with broken wheat kernels. The structure of the breads was characterized extensively. The use of stable isotopes enabled calculation of glucose kinetics: rate of appearance of exogenous glucose, endogenous glucose production, and glucose clearance rate. Additionally, postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, incretins, cholecystokinin, and bile acids were analyzed. Despite the attempt to obtain a bread with a low glycemic response by replacing flour by broken kernels, the glycemic response and glucose kinetics were quite similar after consumption of CB and KB. Interestingly, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response was much lower after KB compared to CB (iAUC, PÂ <Â 0.005). A clear postprandial increase in plasma conjugated bile acids was observed after both meals. Substitution of 85Â % wheat flour by broken kernels in bread did not result in a difference in glucose response and kinetics, but in a pronounced difference in GLP-1 response. Thus, changing the processing conditions of wheat for baking bread can influence the metabolic response beyond glycemia and may therefore influence health.\n\nEffect of macronutrients and fiber on postprandial glycemic responses and meal glycemic index and glycemic load value determinations\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nIntroduction: Meal or dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) values from dietary questionnaires are calculated using GI values of individual foods and for GL after adjusting for serving size.

This paper takes the position that not enough valid scientific data are available to launch a public health campaign to disseminate such a recommendation. This paper explores the glycemic index and its validity and discusses the effect of postprandial glucose and insulin responses on food intake, obesity, type 1 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Presented herein are the reasons why it is premature to recommend that the general population avoid foods with a high glycemic index.\n\nPostprandial Glycemic and Insulinemic Responses to Common Breakfast Beverages Consumed with a Standard Meal in Adults Who Are Overweight and Obese.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Jia; Janle, Elsa; Campbell, Wayne W\n\n2017-01-04\n\nBreakfast beverages with different nutrient compositions may affect postprandial glycemic control differently. We assessed the effects of consuming (1) common breakfast beverages (water, sugar-sweetened coffee, reduced-energy orange juice (OJ), and low-fat milk (LFM)); and (2) fat-free, low-fat, and whole milk with breakfast on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses in adults who were overweight/obese. Forty-six subjects (33F/13M, body mass index: 32.5 Â± 0.7 kg/mÂ², age: 50 Â± 1 years, mean Â± SEMs) consumed a standard sandwich with one of the six beverages on separate mornings in randomized order. The test beverages (except water) each contained 12 g digestible carbohydrate. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured from blood obtained pre- and post-meal at 30-min intervals for 4 h and incremental areas under the curve (AUC) were computed. We found (1) among different beverage types, glucose AUC was higher for coffee versus water, OJ, and LFM. Insulin AUC was higher for coffee and LFM versus OJ and water; (2) Glucose AUCs were not different among water and milks while insulin AUC was higher for milks versus water. In conclusion, consumption of water, reduced-energy OJ, or milk (irrespective of fat content) with a meal may be preferable to consuming sugar-sweetened coffee for glucose control in middle-aged adults who are overweight and obese.\n\nPostprandial Glycemic and Insulinemic Responses to Common Breakfast Beverages Consumed with a Standard Meal in Adults Who Are Overweight and Obese\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Jia; Janle, Elsa; Campbell, Wayne W.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBreakfast beverages with different nutrient compositions may affect postprandial glycemic control differently.

Objective: We hypothesized that blended lentils, Î±-galactosidase, or both increase postprandial appetite and blood glucose responses vs. whole lentils. Methods: Men and women [n = 12; means Â± SDs body mass index (kg/m2): 23.3 Â± 3.1; aged 28 Â± 10 y] consumed breakfast meals containing whole (W), blended (B), or no lentils [control (C)], each with 3 Î±-galactosidase or placebo capsules in a randomized, crossover, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Between each test day there was a 3- to 5-d washout period. Results: Mixed-model ANOVA showed effects of meal on postprandial appetite and glucose (P = 0.0001â0.031). The B meal resulted in higher postprandial appetite ratings than did the W meal but not the C meal for hunger, desire to eat, and prospective consumption (Î = 0.4â0.5 points; P = 0.002â0.044). Postprandial glucose concentration was 4.5 mg/dL lower for the B meal than for the C meal (P < 0.0001) but did not differ from the W meal. There were no main effects of Î±-galactosidase, but there were meal Ã Î±-galactosidase interaction effects, with a greater postprandial desire to eat and lower postprandial fullness with the B meal than with the 2 other meals in the placebo condition but not in the Î±-galactosidase condition. Conclusions: Blending lentils increased appetite (â¼6%), but not glycemic response, compared with whole lentils, whereas Î±-galactosidase did not. Both B and W meals may be consumed (with or without an Î±-galactosidase supplement) with little impact on appetite, without increasing glycemic response.

Thirty male Sprague dawley rats were randomized into three groups: diet of bread with 0% amaranth (PA0, control), diet of bread with 10% amaranth (PA10) and bread diet with 20% amaranth (PA20) for determining the feed intake, weight gain, triglyceride, total cholesterol, VLDL-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, protein and postprandial glycemic response. Data were analyzed using a completely randomized with 10 replications analysis, using the comparison test of Tukey for biochemical parameters. Postprandial glycemic response was analyzed by the method of repeated measures over time. The daily intake and weight gain was not affected (P>0.05) in the groups with PA10 and PA20. The concentration of glucose, triglycerides and protein showed statistically significant differences (P>0.05) by the difference in content of amaranth diets.

During each period, horses received 80% DM of their concentrate as 1 of the 4 forms of a same batch of barley, whole grain, 2.5 mm ground, steam flaked, and pelleted. Hay was offered in 2 equal meals and concentrate in 2 unequal meals. The starch supply in the morning meal amounted 2.7 g starch/kg BW. At each period, mobile bag DM and starch disappearance was determined. Except for ground barley, each form of barley was 4 mm ground before being introduced in the bag. Nylon bags containing each substrate were intubated in the horse receiving the pelleted barley. Bags were collected in the cecum for 10 h postintubation. At each period, postprandial glycemia was measured on blood samples collected on the 4 horses via an indwelling jugular catheter just before the concentrate morning meal and for 8 h. No hay in the morning meal was given the day of the measurements. Whole blood glucose was analyzed with a portable blood glucose meter. Mobile bag prececal DM disappearance and starch disappearance depended (P < 0.01) on barley form. Prececal starch disappearance of whole barley was the lowest but no difference (P > 0.05) was detected among the 3 processed grains. No significant effect of barley form was found whatever the glycemic parameters. No significant correlation was reported between glycemic parameters and the amount of prececal mobile bag disappeared starch calculated as the starch intake in the morning meal by the mobile bag starch disappearance. To conclude, the whole form of barley exhibited the lowest prececal mobile bag starch disappearance whereas, in relationship with large individual variations, no significant variation has been shown in\n\nComparison of appetite responses to high- and low-glycemic index postexercise meals under matched insulinemia and fiber in type 1 diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nCampbell, Matthew D; Gonzalez, Javier T; Rumbold, Penny L S; Walker, Mark; Shaw, James A; Stevenson, Emma J; West, Daniel J\n\n2015-03-01\n\nPatients with type 1 diabetes face heightened risk of hypoglycemia after exercise. Subsequent overfeeding, as a preventative measure against hypoglycemia, negates the energy deficit after exercise. Patients are also required to reduce the insulin dose administered with postexercise foods to further combat hypoglycemia. However, the insulin dose is dictated solely by the carbohydrate content, even though postprandial glycemia is vastly influenced by glycemic index (GI). With a need to control the postexercise energy balance, appetite responses after meals differing in GI are of particular interest. We assessed the appetite response to low-glycemic index (LGI) and high-glycemic index (HGI) postexercise meals in type 1 diabetes patients. This assessment also offered us the opportunity to evaluate the influence of GI on appetite responses independently of insulinemia, which confounds findings in individuals without diabetes. Ten physically active men with type 1 diabetes completed 2 trials in a randomized crossover design. After 45 min of treadmill exercise at 70% of the peak oxygen uptake, participants consumed an LGI (GI â¼37) or HGI (GI â¼92) meal with a matched macronutrient composition, negligible fiber content, and standardized insulin-dose administration. The postprandial appetite response was determined for 180 min postmeal. During this time, circulating glucose, insulin, glucagon, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations and subjective appetite ratings were determined. The HGI meal produced an â¼60% greater postprandial glucose area under the curve (AUC) than did the LGI meal (P = 0.008). Insulin, glucagon, and GLP-1 did not significantly differ between trials (P > 0.05). The fullness AUC was â¼25% greater after the HGI meal than after the LGI meal (P < 0.001), whereas hunger sensations were â¼9% lower after the HGI meal than after the LGI meal (P = 0.001). Under conditions of matched insulinemia and fiber, an HGI postexercise meal suppresses\n\nEffect of Wheat Flour Noodles with Bombyx mori Powder on Glycemic Response in Healthy Subjects.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuk, Wanhee; Kim, JiEun; Kim, Do-Yeon; Lim, Hyunjung; Choue, Ryowon\n\n2016-09-01\n\nRecent trial results suggest that the consumption of a low glycemic index (GI) diet is beneficial in the prevention of high blood glucose levels. Identifying active hypoglycemic substances in ordinary foods could be a significant benefit to the management of blood glucose. It has been hypothesized that noodles with Bombyx mori powder are a low GI food. We evaluated GI and changes in postprandial glucose levels following consumption of those noodles and compared them with those following consumption of plain wheat flour noodles (control) and glucose (reference) in healthy subjects. Thirteen males (age: 34.2Â±4.5 years, body mass index: 23.2Â±1.1 kg/m 2 ) consumed 75 g carbohydrate portions of glucose and the 2 kinds of noodle after an overnight fast. Capillary blood was measured at time 0 (fasting), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min from the start of each food intake. The GI values were calculated by taking the ratio of the incremental area under the blood glucose response curve (IAUC) for the noodles and glucose. There was a significant difference in postprandial glucose concentrations at 30 and 45 min between the control noodles and the noodles with Bombyx mori powder: the IAUC and GI for the noodles with Bombyx mori powder were significantly lower than those for glucose and plain wheat flour noodles. The wheat flour noodles with Bombyx mori powder could help prevent an increase in postprandial glucose response and possibly provide an alternative to other carbohydrate staple foods for glycemic management.\n\nEffect of Wheat Flour Noodles with Bombyx mori Powder on Glycemic Response in Healthy Subjects\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSuk, Wanhee; Kim, JiEun; Kim, Do-Yeon; Lim, Hyunjung; Choue, Ryowon\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRecent trial results suggest that the consumption of a low glycemic index (GI) diet is beneficial in the prevention of high blood glucose levels.

The wheat flour noodles with Bombyx mori powder could help prevent an increase in postprandial glucose response and possibly provide an alternative to other carbohydrate staple foods for glycemic management. PMID:27752491\n\nPhysicochemical properties of beta-glucan in differently processed oat foods influence glycemic response.\n\nPubMed\n\nRegand, Alejandra; Tosh, Susan M; Wolever, Thomas M S; Wood, Peter J\n\n2009-10-14\n\nTo assess the effect of food processing on the capacity of oat beta-glucan to attenuate postprandial glycemia, isocaloric crisp bread, granola, porridge, and pasta containing 4 g of beta-glucan as well as control products with low beta-glucan content were prepared. The physicochemical properties (viscosity, peak molecular weight (M(p)), and concentration (C)) of beta-glucan in in-vitro-digestion extracts were evaluated, and fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations were measured in human subjects. Porridge and granola had the highest efficacy in attenuating the peak blood glucose response (PBGR) because of their high M(p) and viscosity. beta-Glucan depolymerization in bread and pasta reduced beta-glucan bioactivity. Pastas, known to have low glycemic responses, showed the lowest PBGR. The analyses of these products with previously reported data indicated that 73% of the bioactivity in reducing PBGR can be explained by M(p) x C. Characterizing the physicochemical properties of beta-glucan in bioactive foods aids functional food development.\n\nA diabetes-specific enteral formula improves glycemic variability in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlish, Carolyn J; Garvey, W Timothy; Maki, Kevin C; Sacks, Gordon S; Hustead, Deborah S; Hegazi, Refaat A; Mustad, Vikkie A\n\n2010-06-01\n\nWell-controlled studies have demonstrated that inpatient hyperglycemia is an indicator of poor clinical outcomes, but the use of diabetes-specific enteral formulas in hospitalized patients remains a topic of great debate. In two different protocols, postprandial glycemia and insulinemia were measured in 22 subjects with diabetes fed a diabetes-specific or standard formula (protocol 1). Continuous glucose monitoring was used to assess glucose levels in 12 enterally fed patients with diabetes receiving the standard formula followed by the diabetes-specific formula continuously for 5 days each (protocol 2). End points included postprandial glycemia and insulinemia, glycemic variability (mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE]), mean glucose, and insulin use. In the postprandial response protocol, the diabetes-specific formula resulted in lower positive areas under the postprandial curve (P < 0.001) and peak glucose (P < 0.001) and insulin (P = 0.017) levels. In the protocol using continuous glucose monitoring, glycemic variability (as measured by MAGE) was lower with continuous administration of the diabetes-specific than the standard formula (64.6 +/- 6.8 mg/dL vs. 110.6 +/-15.3 mg/dL, P = 0.003). Also, administration of the diabetes-specific formula resulted in lower mean glucose concentrations during feeding (171.1 +/- 16.1 vs. 202.1 +/- 17.4 mg/dL, P = 0.024) and insulin requirements (7.8 +/- 2.3 vs. 10.9 +/- 3.3 units/day, P = 0.039) than the standard formula. Relative to the standard formula, the diabetes-specific formula reduced postprandial glycemia, mean glucose, glycemic variability, and short-acting insulin requirements. These results suggest potential clinical usefulness of a diabetes-specific enteral formula for minimizing glycemic excursions in hospitalized patients.\n\nA Study Examining the Effect of a Short Bout of Postprandial Walking on the Glycemic Effect of a Meal: Type 1 Diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nHinojosa, Samantha L; Heiss, Cynthia J\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether 15Â minutes of postprandial walking has an effect on the glycemic response to a breakfast beverage in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Seven participants, aged 22.3 Â± 4.3Â years, with T1DM using intensive insulin therapy completed 2Â days of data collection. On day 1, participants measured baseline fasting blood glucose (BG) with a glucometer, consumed an 8-ounce BoostÂ® beverage (41Â grams carbohydrate), administered a bolus of insulin according to the carbohydrate load and fasting BG, and sat quietly, repeating BG measurements 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120Â minutes after consumption. On day 2, participants repeated the protocol, but walked 15Â minutes at 50% to 60% maximum heart rate immediately after beverage consumption. The difference between peak and baseline (peak - baseline) BG and incremental glucose area under the curve (iAUC) were lower in all but one participant on the walking compared to the sedentary day. Mean peak - baseline BG was significantly lower on the walking day compared to the sedentary day (6.4 Â± 1.2 vs 14.4 Â± 3.4Â mmol/L, respectively, p = 0.016) as was the iAUC, (241.1 Â± 155.8 vs 468.6 Â± 94.5Â mmol/L/120Â min, respectively, p = 0.031). Fifteen minutes of postprandial walking can blunt the spike in BG and overall glycemic response to a breakfast beverage in young adults with T1DM and may be an effective and realistic component in the management of T1DM.\n\nIn vitro and In vivo Postprandial Glycemic Activity of Citrus limetta Peel Flour.\n\nPubMed\n\nFlores-FernÃ¡ndez, JosÃ© Miguel; BarragÃ¡n-Ãlvarez, Carla Patricia; DÃ­az-MartÃ­nez, Nestor Emmanuel; Villanueva-RodrÃ­guez, Socorro; Padilla-Camberos, Eduardo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPrevious studies of Citrus spp. peel have shown hypoglycemic and antioxidant activities.

Continuous glucose monitoring was used to document the glycemic response. Participants were 14 people with type 2 diabetes on metformin only. On 4 consecutive days in March or July 2008, study participants consumed a fixed breakfast and one of two test meals (lunch) provided in random order. The two lunch types varied only in carbohydrate content; the protein, fat, fiber, and glycemic index were similar. They consumed no caloric food or beverages for 4 hours after each meal. Consuming double the carbohydrate content did not double the glycemic response variables, yet most were substantially different in glucose value (mg/dL) or minutes. General linear model analyses revealed substantial differences for peak glucose, change from baseline glucose to peak, time to return to preprandial glucose, 4-hour glucose area under the curve, and 4-hour mean glucose. Continuous glucose monitoring data provided a robust description of the glycemic response to the two meals. Such data can help improve postprandial glucose levels through more informed nutrition recommendations and synchronization of food intake, diabetes medication, and/or physical activity.

The current study followed a prospective, three-way, cross-over design. Twenty-four patients with T2DM consumed three ready-to-eat mixed meals, i.e., \"wild greens pie\" (meal 1), \"chicken burgers with boiled vegetables\" (meal 2) and \"vegetable moussaka\" (meal 3) and an oral glucose load, all providing 50Â g of carbohydrates. Venous blood was collected at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120Â min postprandial. Statistical analyses included repeated measures analysis of variance and calculations of the area under the glucose and insulin curves (AUC) for each one of the test meals and the oral glucose load. Patients consuming each one of the three mixed meals showed better postprandial glycemic responses compared to the oral glucose load (PÂ <Â 0.001). Furthermore, patients consuming meal 3 showed a better insulinemic response compared to the oral glucose load and meal 1, after 60 and 120Â min postprandial, respectively (PÂ <Â 0.05). In addition, the increase observed in HOMA-IR values from T0 to T120 was significantly lower for meal 3, compared to the oral glucose load (PÂ <Â 0.001). The three ready-to-eat mixed meals examined in the present study were found to elicit significantly lower glycemic responses compared to the oral glucose load in diabetic patients. The mixed meals examined in the present study could be proposed as effective, palatable and practical solutions for diabetics for glucose control.\n\nShort-term effects of a low glycemic index carob-containing snack on energy intake, satiety, and glycemic response in normal-weight, healthy adults: Results from two randomized trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nPapakonstantinou, Emilia; Orfanakos, Nickolaos; Farajian, Paul; Kapetanakou, Anastasia E; Makariti, Ifigenia P; Grivokostopoulos, Nikolaos; Ha, Marie-Ann; Skandamis, Panagiotis N\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe potential positive health effects of carob-containing snacks are largely unknown. Therefore, the aims of these studies were to determine the glycemic index (GI) of a carob snack compared with chocolate cookie containing equal amounts of available carbohydrates and to compare the effects of a carob versus chocolate cookie preload consumed as snack before a meal on (a) short-term satiety response measured by subsequent ad libitum meal intake, (b) subjective satiety as assessed by visual analog scales and (c) postprandial glycemic response. Ten healthy, normal-weight volunteers participated in GI investigation. Then, 50 healthy, normal-weight individuals consumed, crossover, in random order, the preloads as snack, with 1-wk washout period. Ad libitum meal (lunch and dessert) was offered. Capillary blood glucose samples were collected at baseline, 2Â h after breakfast, just before preload consumption, 2Â h after preload, 3Â h after preload, just before meal (lunch and dessert), 1Â h after meal, and 2Â h after meal consumption. The carob snack was a low GI food, whereas the chocolate cookie was a high GI food (40 versus 78, respectively, on glucose scale). Consumption of the carob preload decreased the glycemic response to a following meal and to the individual's feelings of hunger, desire to eat, preoccupation with food, and thirst between snack and meal, as assessed with the use of visual analog scales. Subsequently, participants consumed less amounts of food (g) and had lower total energy intake at mealtimes. The carob snack led to increased satiety, lower energy intake at meal, and decreased postmeal glycemic response possibly due to its low GI value. Identifying foods that promote satiety and decrease glycemic response without increasing the overall energy intake may offer advantages to body weight and glycemic control.

We aimed to assess the impact of GL on concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. Subjects/Methods We conducted a randomized, controlled crossover feeding trial in 84 overweight-obese and normal weight healthy individuals using two 28-day weight-maintaining high- and low-GL diets. Measures were fasting and post-prandial concentrations of insulin, glucose, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. 20 participants completed post-prandial testing by consuming a test breakfast at the end of each feeding period. We used paired t-tests for diet-component and linear mixed models for biomarker analyses. Results The 28-day low-GL diet led to 4% lower fasting concentrations of IGF-1 (10.6 ng/mL, p=0.04) and a 4% lower ratio of IGF-1/IGFBP-3 (0.24, p=0.01) compared to the high-GL diet. The low-GL test breakfast led to 43% and 27% lower mean post-prandial glucose and insulin responses, respectively; mean incremental areas under the curve for glucose and insulin, respectively, were 64.3Â±21.8 (mmol/L/240min) (p<0.01) and 2253Â±539 (Î¼U/mL/240min) (p<0.01) lower following the low- compared to the high-GL test meal. There was no effect of GL on mean HOMA-IR or on mean integrated post-prandial concentrations of glucose-adjusted insulin, IGF-1 or IGFBP-3. We did not observe modification of the dietary effect by adiposity. Conclusions Low-GL diets resulted in 43% and 27% lower post-prandial responses of glucose and insulin, respectively, and modestly lower fasting IGF-1 concentrations. Further intervention studies are needed to weigh the impact of dietary GL on risk for chronic disease.

First, 50 IFG and 50 healthy subjects were recruited; and 2â-h postprandial changes in FFA profiles were determined. Second, the 50 IFG subjects then received three different loads: glucose load (GL), high glycemic index (HGI) load and low glycemic index (LGI) load, respectively. FFA profile, glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and inflammatory biomarkers were assayed at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120âmin. Postprandial stearic acid (C18:0) increased compared with baseline in all subjects, whereas the change in postprandial C18:0 was more marked in IFG subjects than in healthy subjects. Compared with subjects who received the GL and HGI load, the area under the curve for insulin, GLP-1, C18:0 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha significantly decreased and adiponectin increased in subjects who received the LGI load. The rise in postprandial C18:0 in IFG subjects was inhibited by LGI load.\n\nInfluence of the glycemic index and glycemic load of the diet in the glycemic control of diabetic children and teenagers.\n\nPubMed\n\nQueiroz, K C; Novato Silva, I; de CÃ¡ssia GonÃ§alves Alfenas, R\n\n2012-01-01\n\nEvaluate the influence of the glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) of the diet in the glycemic control of children and teenagers with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). A total of 146 subjects, aged 7-19 years, monitored at the Division of Pediatric Endocrinology at the HC/UFMG participated in the study. The consumed diet was evaluated using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire previously validated and tested in a pilotproject. The GI of the participant's diet was estimated according to the equation described by Wolever and Jenkins (1986). The GL was estimated using the equation proposed by Foster-Powell et al. (2002). The glycemic control was classified as good, intermediate or poor according to the average of two HbA1c values obtained six months prior to the dietary evaluation date. Subjects that had good glycemic control consumed diets with significantly (Tukey test, p = 0.000) lower GI/GL (54.8 Â± 2.7/118.3 Â± 29.8) than the ones with intermediate (60.1 Â± 3.8/142.5 Â± 27.3) and poor (60.3 Â± 4.1/153.7 Â± 40.7) glycemic control. The diet consumed by 75.5% of diabetics with good glycemic control was classified as medium GL, suggesting that the consumption of medium GL diet may favor an adequate glycemic control. The low GI diet consumed by these participants also presented higher protein content, which might have contributed to the attenuation of the postprandial glycemic response and better glycemic control of these patients. The intake of a reduced GI/GL diet favors the glycemic control of the studied population.\n\nDiurnal glycemic profile in obese and normal weight nondiabetic pregnant women.\n\nPubMed\n\nYogev, Yariv; Ben-Haroush, Avi; Chen, Rony; Rosenn, Barak; Hod, Moshe; Langer, Oded\n\n2004-09-01\n\nA paucity of data exists concerning the normal glycemic profile in nondiabetic pregnancies. Using a novel approach that provides continuous measurement of blood glucose, we sought to evaluate the ambulatory daily glycemic profile in the second half of pregnancy in nondiabetic women. Fifty-seven obese and normal weight nondiabetic subjects were evaluated for 72 consecutive hours with continuous glucose monitoring by measurement interstitial glucose levels in subcutaneous tissue every 5 minutes. Subjects were instructed not to modify their lifestyle or to follow any dietary restriction. For each woman, mean and fasting blood glucose values were determined; for each meal during the study period, the first 180 minutes were analyzed. For the study group, the fasting blood glucose level was 75 +/- 12 mg/dL; the mean blood glucose level was 83.7 +/- 18 mg/dL; the postprandial peak glucose value level was 110 +/- 16 mg/dL, and the time interval that was needed to reach peak postprandial glucose level was 70 +/- 13 minutes. A similar postprandial glycemic profile was obtained for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Obese women were characterized by a significantly higher postprandial glucose peak value, increased 1- and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels, increased time interval for glucose peak, and significantly lower mean blood glucose during the night. No difference was found in fasting and mean blood glucose between obese and nonobese subjects. Glycemic profile characterization in both obese and normal weight nondiabetic subjects provide a measure for the desired level of glycemic control in pregnancy that is complicated with diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe impact of food viscosity on eating rate, subjective appetite, glycemic response and gastric emptying rate.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Yong; Hsu, Walter H; Hollis, James H\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUnderstanding the impact of rheological properties of food on postprandial appetite and glycemic response helps to design novel functional products. It has been shown that solid foods have a stronger satiating effect than their liquid equivalent. However, whether a subtle change in viscosity of a semi-solid food would have a similar effect on appetite is unknown. Fifteen healthy males participated in the randomized cross-over study. Each participant consumed a 1690 kJ portion of a standard viscosity (SV) and a high viscosity (HV) semi-solid meal with 1000 mg acetaminophen in two separate sessions. At regular intervals during the three hours following the meal, subjective appetite ratings were measured and blood samples collected. The plasma samples were assayed for insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glucose and acetaminophen. After three hours, the participants were provided with an ad libitum pasta meal. Compared with the SV meal, HV was consumed at a slower eating rate (Pâ=â0.020), with postprandial hunger and desire to eat being lower (Pâ=â0.019 and P<0.001 respectively) while fullness was higher (P<0.001). In addition, consuming the HV resulted in lower plasma concentration of GIP (P<0.001), higher plasma concentration of glucose (P<0.001) and delayed gastric emptying as revealed by the acetaminophen absorption test (P<0.001). However, there was no effect of food viscosity on insulin or food intake at the subsequent meal. In conclusion, increasing the viscosity of a semi-solid food modulates glycemic response and suppresses postprandial satiety, although the effect may be short-lived. A slower eating rate and a delayed gastric emptying rate can partly explain for the stronger satiating properties of high viscous semi-solid foods.\n\nThe Impact of Food Viscosity on Eating Rate, Subjective Appetite, Glycemic Response and Gastric Emptying Rate\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhu, Yong; Hsu, Walter H.; Hollis, James H.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUnderstanding the impact of rheological properties of food on postprandial appetite and glycemic response helps to design novel functional products.

Previous work indicated that resistant starch (RS) content of rice consumed in India varied with rice variety and cooking method. This study quantified RS in 4 white rice varieties (jasmine, long grain, medium grain, and short grain) cooked in three manners (oven baked, conventional rice cooker, and pressure cooker), and analyzed for RS content immediately after preparation or after 3 days of refrigeration at 4Â°C. The rice varieties with the highest and lowest RS content were selected for a pilot- scale trial to characterize postprandial glycemic response and appetite ratings in healthy adults (n=21). Refrigerated long-grain rice cooked in a conventional rice cooker had the highest RS content (HRS, 2.55 g RS/100 g) and refrigerated short-grain rice cooked in a pressure cooker had the lowest RS content (LRS, 0.20 g RS/100 g). These rice samples were served reheated in the clinical trial. Glucose area under the curve (AUC) were significantly lower with HRS and LRS compared to glucose beverage; however, there was no difference between HRS and LRS. Glycemic indices did not differ significantly between HRS and LRS. Subjects reported an overall increased feeling of fullness and decreased desire to eat based on incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for both HRS and LRS compared to control. This study found that RS naturally occurring in rice had minimal impact on the postprandial glycemic response and appetite.\n\nEffect of glycemic state on postprandial hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia in patients with coronary artery disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nNakamura, Akihiro; Monma, Yuto; Kajitani, Shoko; Noda, Kazuki; Nakajima, Sota; Endo, Hideaki; Takahashi, Tohru; Nozaki, Eiji\n\n2016-09-01\n\nBoth postprandial hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia have been thought to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis, and to be a potent risk factor for cardiovascular event. To examine effects of glycemic state on postprandial hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), a total of 112 consecutive male pati ents with angiographically confirmed CAD were loaded with a high-fat and high-glucose test meal. CAD patients were divided into three groups as \"non-diabetic\", \"prediabetic\", and \"diabetic\" CAD groups. The serum triglyceride (TG) and remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) levels at the 6th hour in diabetic CAD group showed significantly higher than non-diabetic CAD group, and the incremental area under the curves (iAUCs) of these levels in diabetic CAD group were significantly greater than non-diabetic CAD group (TG, PÂ =Â 0.0194; RLP-C, PÂ =Â 0.0219). There were no significant differences in the iAUCs of TG or RLP-C between prediabetic and non-diabetic CAD group. The AUCs of plasma insulin levels or insulin resistance index (IRI): (AUCs of insulin) Ã (AUCs of glucose) as the insulin resistance marker were greater in diabetic CAD group than non-diabetic CAD group (insulin, PÂ =Â 0.0373; IRI, PÂ =Â 0.0228). The AUCs of serum TG or RLP-C levels showed a correlation with the AUCs of plasma insulin (AUC-TG, rÂ =Â 0.5437, PÂ <Â 0.0001; AUC-RLP-C, rÂ =Â 0.6847, PÂ <Â 0.0001), and they correlated well with the insulin resistance index (AUC-TG, rÂ =Â 0.7724, PÂ <Â 0.0001; AUC-RLP-C, rÂ =Â 0.7645, PÂ <Â 0.0001). We found that the insulin resistance showed a close relationship with postprandial hyperlipidemia in CAD patients. Diabetic, but not prediabetic state, may be a risk for postprandial impaired lipid metabolism in CAD patients.\n\nIn vitro colonic fermentation and glycemic response of different kinds of unripe banana flour.\n\nPubMed\n\nMenezes, Elizabete Wenzel; Dan, Milana C T; Cardenette, Giselli H L; GoÃ±i, Isabel; Bello-PÃ©rez, Luis Arturo; Lajolo, Franco M\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThis work aimed to study the in vitro colonic fermentation profile of unavailable carbohydrates of two different kinds of unripe banana flour and to evaluate their postprandial glycemic responses. The unripe banana mass (UBM), obtained from the cooked pulp of unripe bananas (Musa acuminata, NanicÃ£o variety), and the unripe banana starch (UBS), obtained from isolated starch of unripe banana, plantain type (Musa paradisiaca) in natura, were studied. The fermentability of the flours was evaluated by different parameters, using rat inoculum, as well as the glycemic response produced after the ingestion by healthy volunteers. The flours presented high concentration of unavailable carbohydrates, which varied in the content of resistant starch, dietary fiber and indigestible fraction (IF). The in vitro colonic fermentation of the flours was high, 98% for the UBS and 75% for the UBM when expressed by the total amount of SCFA such as acetate, butyrate and propionate in relation to lactulose. The increase in the area under the glycemic curve after ingestion of the flours was 90% lower for the UBS and 40% lower for the UBM than the increase produced after bread intake. These characteristics highlight the potential of UBM and UBS as functional ingredients. However, in vivo studies are necessary in order to evaluate the possible benefit effects of the fermentation on intestinal health.\n\nA low glycemic index staple diet reduces postprandial glucose values in Asian women with gestational diabetes mellitus.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Zhi-Geng; Tan, Rong-Shao; Jin, Di; Li, Wei; Zhou, Xiao-Yan\n\n2014-12-01\n\nA low glycemic index (GI) diet is beneficial for glucose control in patients with diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to investigate the influence of a low-GI diet on postprandial glucose levels in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Pregnant women with GDM were randomized to receive a normal diabetic control diet or a low-GI staple diet for 5 days. A low-GI staple food was used to replace rice in lunch and dinner for the low-GI staple diet group, whereas the total energy and carbohydrate levels remained equal in both groups. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels were determined daily. A total of 140 pregnant women with GDM were included in the study, including 66 in the low-GI staple diet group and 74 in the normal diabetic diet control group. No differences existed in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups (all P > 0.05). After dietary intervention, glucose levels were significantly reduced in the low-GI staple diet group (all P < 0.01) and the control group (all P < 0.008). Postintervention glucose values after breakfast, lunch, and dinner were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with those in the control group (all P < 0.05). The percentage changes from baseline of all glucose values were significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group (all P < 0.05). A low-GI staple diet significantly reduces postprandial glucose levels in women with GDM.\n\nEffects of Low versus High Glycemic Index Sugar-Sweetened Beverages on Postprandial Vasodilatation and Inactivity-Induced Impairment of Glucose Metabolism in Healthy Men\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKeller, Judith; KahlhÃ¶fer, Julia; Peter, Andreas; Bosy-Westphal, Anja\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) may contribute to cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to investigate whether functional sugars with low compared to high glycemic index (GI) have beneficial effects on arterial stiffness during a period of low-physical activity. In a controlled cross-over dietary intervention (55% CHO, 30% fat, 15% protein), 13 healthy men (age: 23.7 Â± 2.2 years, body mass index: 23.6 Â± 1.9 kg/m2) completed 2 Ã 1 week of low physical activity following 1 week of normal physical activity (2363 Â± 900 vs. 11,375 Â± 3124 steps/day). During inactive phases participants consumed either low-GI (isomaltulose) or high-GI SSB (maltodextrin-sucrose), providing 20% of energy requirements. Postprandial vasodilatation (augmentation index, AIx), insulin sensitivity (IS) and Glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) responses were measured during a meal test before and after SSB-intervention. Compared to maltodextrin-sucrose-SSB, postprandial vasodilatation was prolonged (AIx after 120 min: 9.9% Â± 4.3% vs. 11.4% Â± 3.7%, p < 0.05) and GLP-1 secretion was higher with isomaltulose-SSB (total area under the GLP-1 curve (tAUCGLP)-1: 8.0 Â± 4.4 vs. 5.4 Â± 3.4 pM Ã 3 h; p < 0.05). One week of low-physical activity led to impaired IS that was attenuated with low-GI SSB consumption, but did not affect arterial stiffness (p > 0.05). Higher postprandial GLP-1 secretion after intake of low compared to high-GI beverages may contribute to improved postprandial vasodilatation. Although one week of low-physical activity led to marked impairment in IS, it had no effect on arterial stiffness in healthy men.
