        "text": "There’s no denying that having long, flowing hair opens up a world of opportunity as far as hairstyles go, but trying to get length and then keep length is often something of a challenge for a multitude of reasons.\n\nAnd frustratingly, it can be a really difficult to pin down which one (or ones) are causing your strands to suffer, especially given our hair only grows around one-and-a-half centimetres a month and can be really hard to monitor.\n\nSo, in order to get the bottom of why your attempts to lengthen your locks just aren’t working, we consulted the experts and rounded up the top five reasons your hair isn’t growing and what you need to do to fix them.\n\n1. You Have A Vitamin Or Mineral Deficiency\n\nWhen it comes to growing long, lustrous hair, maintaining good nutrition is imperative.\n\nClinical nutritionist and creator of JSHealth Vitamins, Jessica Sepel, recommends ensuring that you are meeting your optimal requirements for iodine, zinc, B vitamins, omega-3s and iron.\n\nIron is a particularly common deficiency for menstruating women, while zinc and iodine are frequently lacking in a modern western diet, so you may want get a blood test to account for any deficiencies and supplement under the guidance of your doctor, Sepel advises.\n\n“Pop a multi-mineral supplement every day for three months. Make sure it contains iodine, zinc and selenium—they’re great for hair growth,” says Sepel.\n\nSpecific minerals aside, it’s important to ensure your overall diet is up to scratch.\n\n“Enjoy good fats and protein. The amino acids in protein work to build strong hair cells, while good fats nourish those cells, making your hair appear shiny on the outside. Eat lots of dark, leafy greens with every meal. Sneak them into your brekkie, too,” Sepel recommends.\n\n“Load up on vitamin C. This vitamin boosts collagen production, which keeps hair thick and strong. Rich sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, capsicum, strawberries and greens.”\n\n2. You’re not taking care of your scalp\n\nWhen trying to maintain length, we have a tendency to become so preoccupied with our tresses that we forget to nourish the scalp they’re coming from.\n\n“It’s a misconception that damage affects hair growth,” explains Joey Scandizzo, celebrity hairstylist and co-creative director of ELEVEN Australia.\n\n“Your hair grows at the same rate, even if your overly balayaged ends are breaking off. So, while lack of moisture and damage can affect how long your hair will get, growth comes from the scalp. You’ve got to think about the whole thing and looking after your scalp is just as important as looking after your ends if you want to get longer hair.”\n\nEnsuring a healthy scalp for optimal hair growth doesn’t have to be difficult, Scandizzo emphasises.\n\n“You want to do things that take care of your scalp, like using the right shampoo and protecting your scalp from sunburn if you have fine hair. Brushing your scalp [also] stimulates healthy hair growth by bringing blood to the surface, shifting sweat and oils away from the follicle and allowing your scalp to breathe.”\n\n3. You Have Split Ends That Are Causing The Hair To Break Faster Than It Can Grow\n\nIf your is growing (and for those of you with coloured hair, your regrowth will usually tell you if it is!) but you’re not actually seeing it fall past the same point it was at months ago, split ends could be the culprit.\n\n“Split ends are caused by damage to the hair shaft usually from colouring or excessive heat. One strand of hair will split and then split again causing frayed ends that taper out to nothing,” Scandizzo explains.\n\nAnd while it may hurt to hear it, getting a regular trim (Scandizzo recommends every six weeks) is the only way to ensure that you’re getting rid of those nasty, matted ends that are working their way up the strand and weakening the hair.\n\n“It may seem counterproductive if you’re trying to grow your hair but getting rid of split ends as soon as they appear actually means your hair will become longer quicker! Keeping ends blunt will help stop them from splitting,” says Scandizzo.\n\nIn addition to trims, developing a good hair care routine and selecting the right products is key.\n\n“Rough towel drying can cause breakage and split ends, it’s always better to squeeze excess water out rather than rubbing.\n\n“When it comes to split ends, it is essential to prep the hair before styling with heat. A leave-in conditioner is also really important to hydrate and protect hair around the clock,” adds Scandizzo.\n\n4. You’re Exposing Your Hair To Too Much Heat And Lots Of Chemicals\n\nWe love a straightening sesh as much as the next person, but sadly, the added heat in conjunction with a myriad of styling products may not be doing your long hair goals any favours.\n\n“This is under the same category as split ends. If your hair is breaking, your ends are fraying out to nothing you’re going to struggle to get your hair past a certain length,” Scandizzo tells ELLE.\n\n“If moisture is being depleted either through chemical damage, colouring or heat and isn’t being replenished afterwards with the right products, it can lead to breakage.”\n\nAs for how to fix it? It all comes down to one word: moisture.\n\n“You know how they say if you’re thirsty, you’re already dehydrated? It’s the same with hair. If you’re hair looks brittle and you have split ends, then dryness and dehydration have already kicked in. Adding treatments into your routine in between trims will help revive damaged hair and bring moisture back,” explains Scandizzo.\n\n“When it comes to picking products, one mistake people make is just focusing on moisturising the hair, but it’s important to make sure you’re adding protein to your hair as well.”\n\n5. Your hair is in its ‘resting’ phase\n\nThis is probably the most difficult reason to ‘fix’, simply because it largely comes down to genetics. Our hair actually grows in a three-phase cycle. First, there’s the ‘anagen phase’ which is the growth phase and faster in summer than in winter. It lasts an average of three-and-a-half years and can go for as long as seven years for some people.\n\nThen you have the ‘catagen phase’, which starts at the end of your anagen phase. It’s a short transitional period that lasts around 10 days. After this, you have the ‘telogen phase’ AKA the ‘resting phase’ when your hair is released and falls out. The follicle the remains inactive for around three months before the entire process is repeated. And if you think it happens for all your hairs at the exact same time? Not so much. Each hair follicle is independent from the other and they go through this three-phase cycle at varying points in time (otherwise all of your hair would fall out at once!).\n\nA healthy head of hair usually sheds anywhere from 50 to 100 hairs per day, but this can be exacerbated by underlying conditions such as improper nutrition or a hormone imbalance. But don’t lose heart, being in this phase doesn’t mean all your hair care efforts have to go to waste.\n\n“A lot of the time people think their hair is unhealthy when their hair sheds but it’s really just making room for fresh hair growth. This is actually the best time to focus on scalp health to promote healthy hair growth during this phase,” Scandizzo says."
