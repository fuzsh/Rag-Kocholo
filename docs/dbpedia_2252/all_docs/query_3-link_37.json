        "text": "Every time I take a hot shower in my Brooklyn apartment, I’m transported back to Iceland. And not to the cozy candlelit restaurants nor the geothermal hot springs, but to an ice-cold diving site called Silfra Fissure—a magical spot where the American and Eurasian continental plates slowly move away from each other at a tortoise speed of two centimeters per year. Its crystal clear waters made me fall in love with the Nordic island, which is perhaps why I spent 40 minutes snorkeling in 35-degree temperatures in the middle of their cold and rainy season. Once the dry suit was ditched, my wet red strands frozen onto my scalp, I sprinted to the nearest hostel in search of a scalding hot shower.\n\nIt was there, at the minimalist Kex Hostel, where I met my shampoo soul mate: Sóley Organics, an all-natural body and hair-care brand created by Icelandic actress Sóley Elíasdóttir, whose great-great-grandmother was a well-known herbalist and midwife. Each product, made from recipes belonging to Elíasdóttir’s ancestors, uses Icelandic spring water and local wild herbs, such as bearberry leaf and willow extract, that are handpicked every summer in Southern Iceland. Their slightly black-peppery scent managed to become a manifestation of the entire day’s experience for me by the end of my shower. Nostalgia aside, something about the handmade formula agrees with my at-times unruly and always dry hair and since our first meet, I have come to count on easy, shiny waves every time I use the Græðir shampoo (which means “healer” in Icelandic), and the ultra-hydrating Lind conditioner, which touts grapefruit as a main ingredient.\n\nCall it fate, but a serendipitous flash sale popped up in my inbox right around the time I ran out of my beloved products almost a full year after that trip. And believe it or not, the price tag for a round-trip ticket to Reykjavik in April was less than my online cart. (And before you slam the amount of money I was prepared to spend on hair care, I have two words for you: international shipping.) The decision was obvious, either buy my goods in person and take a few extra vacation days to explore the Scandinavian countryside or stay home and await my online purchase. I chose the latter.\n\nAfter all, as a former travel editor, I’m here for souvenirs. For some, that may mean small rocks taken from special places around the world, local ceramics, or postcards. For me? It’s a dozen green bottles of Sóley Organics, easily found in boutique hostels or the duty-free store in the Keflavik Airport."
