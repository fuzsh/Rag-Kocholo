        "text": "Looking for someone new to follow on Instagram? Well, if you’re finding it hard to choose, we may have someone just for you! She’s been on the scene for a while, and she has wings. No, she’s not a bird, but she is an angel! If you haven’t been to Victoria’s Secret angel Lais Ribeiro’s Instagram page, then you’re missing out!\n\nShe makes being a Victoria’s Secret model look easy and isn’t afraid to share her life with her fans. She’s been all over the world, been seen on the best red carpets, and she has walked countless catwalks.\n\nIf you want to learn more about her, then keep reading our Lais Ribeiro wiki to learn all the juicy details about this divine diva!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLais Ribeiro’s Ethnicity\n\nWhere does Ribeiro get those unbelievably gorgeous exotic looks from?\n\nThe Victoria’s Secret angel was born on October 5, 1990, in Brazil. This makes Lais Ribeiro’s age 27.\n\nHer mother’s name is Socorro Oliveira, and her father is Jose Ribeiro de Oliveira Filho. She holds a Brazilian nationality and is of Brazilian descent.\n\nShe is represented by several agencies, including Women Management (NYC), Supreme Management (Paris), Monster Management (Milan), Select Model Management (London), Traffic Models (Barcelona), Starsystem (Geneve), Mega Model Agency (Hamburg), Munich Models (Munich), and MP Stockholm (Stockholm).\n\nIt looks like everyone wants a piece of this beauty!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to her management agency, Lais Ribeiro’s measurements are: 8.5 size shoes, 23″ waist, 31″ bust, and 33″ hips. (Aka the dream body!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: She originally trained to be a nurse and decided to model to make some extra money. She was also only the fourth black model to wear the “Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra,” which was worth a whopping $2.0 million!\n\nIt weighed more than 600 carats and was handset with diamonds, yellow sapphires, and blue topaz. It reportedly took almost 350 hours to make and was handset with close to 6,000 gemstones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bra was worn for the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show in 2017. And Ribeiro simply rocked it on the catwalk!\n\nShe’s a Single Mother\n\nHaving a busy schedule as a model is one thing. But even after adding motherhood to the mix, Ribeiro somehow manages to pull it off with ease!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLais Ribeiro’s son is named Alexandre, and he is nine years old. He’s often seen in her photos on social media. Talk about #MomGoals!\n\nIn an interview with Parents.com, Ribeiro said that she gets help from her mother and sister when it comes to juggling her personal and professional life. She also talked about how she’s just like other moms and sometimes has to miss out on what her son is doing because of work.\n\nShe also takes him to the gym with her whenever she can, so that they can do short workouts together while bonding at the same time. And clearly, Lais Ribeiro’s diet is working for her!\n\nAfter giving birth to her son, she was discovered by a scout in Sao Paulo close to her 19th birthday in 2009 and traveled to New York and Europe. She worked for several high-end brands such as Chanel, Christian Dior, and Tom Ford. They made sure to put Lais Ribeiro’s height (6’0″) to good use.\n\nShe quickly became Brazil’s most wanted model by 2011 and walked in 27 shows back home! Before she earned that kind of fame in her home country, she was considered too slender and too tall to walk the runways in her part of Brazil.\n\nLais Ribeiro’s Boyfriend\n\nOf course, the perfect girl would already have the perfect guy! As it turns out, she’s still dating basketball star and Iowa native, Jared Homan.\n\nThe two are often seen traveling together on Instagram and are usually dressed to swim. Lucky them!\n\nThey also look great when they’re ready to hit the party scene and casually hang with some of the biggest stars, like at this year’s Oscars for example.\n\nShe Was at Coachella\n\nCoachella was the biggest it’s ever been this year (thanks to Beyoncé). And it’s no surprise that Ribeiro and her boyfriend were there, along with all the other celebrities.\n\nShe was also there with fellow Victoria’s Secret models Jasmine Tookes and Sara Sampaio.\n\nWe wonder if they freaked out when they saw Beyoncé on stage. They probably did. (Let’s be honest, Queen Bey simply owned Coachella this year!)\n\nCampaigns and Shoots\n\nRibeiro has been involved in some of the best photo shoots, runways, and campaigns in the world. She’s worked with huge designers such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Versace, Marc Jacobs, and Shiatzy Chen.\n\nThe model has also had her pictures taken for Italian, German, American, and Brazilian Vogue.\n\nRibeiro worked on ad campaigns such as Gap, Tom Ford, Christian Dior, Ralph Lauren, and American Eagle. She’s partnered with Sports Illustrated to promote Edge (shaving gel) and Cushnie et Ochs clothing for their fall line.\n\nAnyway, if you’re an Instagram addict like us and are looking for the best celebs to follow, Lais Ribeiro’s account will not disappoint. If nothing else, you’ll get an inside look at what goes on in the life of this popular model and get to gawk at the beautiful angel she truly is!"
