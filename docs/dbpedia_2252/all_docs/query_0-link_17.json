        "text": "Postprandial glucose response to selected tropical fruits in normal glucose-tolerant Nigerians.\n\nPubMed\n\nEdo, A; Eregie, A; Adediran, O; Ohwovoriole, A; Ebengho, S\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe glycemic response to commonly eaten fruits in Nigeria has not been reported. Therefore, this study assessed the plasma glucose response to selected fruits in Nigeria. Ten normal glucose-tolerant subjects randomly consumed 50 g carbohydrate portions of three fruits: banana (Musa paradisiaca), pineapple (Ananus comosus), and pawpaw (Carica papaya), and a 50-g glucose load at 1-week intervals. Blood samples were collected in the fasting state and half-hourly over a 2-h period post-ingestion of the fruits or glucose. The samples were analyzed for plasma glucose concentrations. Plasma glucose responses were assessed by the peak plasma glucose concentration, maximum increase in plasma glucose, 2-h postprandial plasma glucose level, and incremental area under the glucose curve and glycemic index (GI). The results showed that the blood glucose response to these three fruits was similar in terms of their incremental areas under the glucose curve, maximum increase in plasma glucose, and glycemic indices (GIs). The 2-h postprandial plasma glucose level of banana was significantly higher than that of pineapple, P < 0.025. The mean Â± SEM GI values were as follows: pawpaw; 86 Â± 26.8%; banana, 75.1 Â± 21.8%; pineapple, 64.5 Â± 11.3%. The GI of glucose is taken as 100. The GI of pineapple was significantly lower than that of glucose (P < 0.05). Banana, pawpaw, and pineapple produced a similar postprandial glucose response. Measured portions of these fruits may be used as fruit exchanges with pineapple having the most favorable glycemic response.\n\nBread making technology influences postprandial glucose response: a review of the clinical evidence.\n\nPubMed\n\nStamataki, Nikoleta S; Yanni, Amalia E; Karathanos, Vaios T\n\n2017-04-01\n\nLowering postprandial glucose and insulin responses may have significant beneficial implications for prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders. Bread is a staple food consumed worldwide in a daily basis, and the use of different baking technologies may modify the glucose and insulin response. The aim of this review was to critically record the human studies examining the application of different bread making processes on postprandial glucose and insulin response to bread. Literature is rich of results which show that the use of sourdough fermentation instead of leavening with Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to modulate glucose response to bread, whereas evidence regarding its efficacy on lowering postprandial insulin response is less clear. The presence of organic acids is possibly involved, but the exact mechanism of action is still to be confirmed. The reviewed data also revealed that the alteration of other processing conditions (method of cooking, proofing period, partial baking freezing technology) can effectively decrease postprandial glucose response to bread, by influencing physical structure and retrogradation of starch. The development of healthier bread products that benefit postprandial metabolic responses is crucial and suggested baking conditions can be used by the bread industry for the promotion of public health.\n\nGreater impairment of postprandial triacylglycerol than glucose response in metabolic syndrome subjects with fasting hyperglycaemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nJackson, Kim G; Walden, Charlotte M; Murray, Peter; Smith, Adrian M; Minihane, Anne M; Lovegrove, Julie A; Williams, Christine M\n\n2013-08-01\n\nStudies have started to question whether a specific component or combinations of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components may be more important in relation to cardiovascular disease risk. Our aim was to examine the impact of the presence of raised fasting glucose as a MetS component on postprandial lipaemia. Men classified with the MetS underwent a sequential test meal investigation, in which blood samples were taken at regular intervals after a test breakfast (t=0 min) and lunch (t=330 min). Lipids, glucose and insulin were measured in the fasting and postprandial samples. MetS subjects with 3 or 4 components were subdivided into those without (n=34) and with (n=23) fasting hyperglycaemia (â¥5.6 mmol/l), irrespective of the combination of components. Fasting lipids and insulin were similar in the two groups, with glucose significantly higher in the men with glucose as a MetS component (P<0.001). Following the test meals, there were higher maximum concentration (maxC), area under the curve (AUC) and incremental AUC (P â¤0.016) for the postprandial triacylglycerol (TAG) response in men with fasting hyperglycaemia. Greater glucose AUC (P<0.001) and insulin maxC (P=0.010) were also observed in these individuals after the test meals. Multiple regression analysis revealed fasting glucose to be an important predictor of the postprandial TAG and glucose response. Our data analysis has revealed a greater impairment of postprandial TAG than glucose response in MetS subjects with raised fasting glucose. The worsening of postprandial lipaemic control may contribute to the greater CVD risk reported in individuals with MetS component combinations which include hyperglycaemia.

Therefore, we designed a study to compare the different effects of two carbohydrates (75âg oral glucose, a monosaccharide and 100âg standard noodle, a polysaccharide, with 75âg carbohydrates equivalently) on postprandial glucose, insulin and incretin responses in different glucose tolerance groups. This study was an open-label, randomized, two-way crossover clinical trial. 240 participants were assigned to take two carbohydrates in a randomized order separated by a washout period of 5-7 days. The plasma glucose, insulin, c-peptide, glucagon and active glucagon-like peptide-1 (AGLP-1) were measured. The incremental area under curve above baseline from 0 to 120âmin of insulin (iAUC(0 -120âmin)- INS) and AGLP-1(iAUC(0 -120âmin)- AGLP-1) was calculated. Compared with standard noodles, the plasma glucose and insulin after consumption of oral glucose were higher at 30âmin (both Pâ<â0.001) and 60âmin (both Pâ<â0.001), while lower at 180âmin (both Pâ<â0.001), but no differences were found at 120âmin. The glucagon at 180âmin was higher after consumption of oral glucose (Pâ=â0.010). The AGLP-1 response to oral glucose was higher at 30âmin (Pâ<â0.001), 60âmin (Pâ<â0.001) and 120âmin (Pâ=â0.022), but lower at 180âmin (Pâ=â0.027). In normal glucose tolerance (NGT), oral glucose elicited a higher insulin response to the corresponding AGLP-1 (Pâ<â0.001), which was represented by iAUC(0 -120âmin) -INS /iAUC(0 -120âmin)- AGLP-1, while in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), standard noodles did (Pâ=â0.001). Monosaccharide potentiated more rapid and higher glycemic and insulin responses. Oral glucose of liquid state would elicit a more potent release of AGLP-1. The incretin effect was amplified after consumption of standard noodles in T2DM.

Previous studies suggest that postprandial high blood glucose levels (BGL) can lead to an oxidative stress status, which is associated with metabolic alterations. Cinnamon powder has demonstrated a beneficial effect on postprandial glucose homeostasis in animals and human models. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of cinnamon tea (C. burmannii) on postprandial capillary blood glucose level on nondiabetic adults. Participants were given oral glucose tolerance test either with or without cinnamon tea in a randomized clinical trial. The data revealed that cinnamon tea administration slightly decreased postprandial BGL. Cinnamon tea ingestion also results in a significantly lower postprandial maximum glucose concentration and variation of maximum glucose concentration (p < 0.05). Chemical analysis showed that cinnamon tea has a high antioxidant capacity, which may be due to its polyphenol content. The present study provides evidence that cinnamon tea, obtained from C. burmannii, could be beneficial for controlling glucose metabolism in nondiabetic adults during postprandial period.\n\nImproved post-prandial ghrelin response by nateglinide or acarbose therapy contributes to glucose stability in Type 2 diabetic patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nZheng, F; Yin, X; Lu, W; Zhou, J; Yuan, H; Li, H\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecent studies highlight an important role of ghrelin in glucose homeostasis, while the association between ghrelin regulation and glucose fluctuation is unclear. We compared the effects of two postprandial hypoglycemic agents on ghrelin response and determined the contribution of ghrelin response to glucose stability in Type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients. Forty newly- diagnosed T2DM patients were randomly allocated to receive nateglinide or acarbose for 4 weeks, with twenty body mass index (BMI)-matched normoglycemic subjects as controls. Mean glucose values and daily average glucose excursion were assessed using continuous glucose monitoring system. Serum ghrelin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. T2DM patients had similar fasting ghrelin levels (p=0.546), while their postprandial ghrelin suppressions at 30 min and 120 min were reduced as compared to BMI-matched normoglycemic controls (p<0.01). Both nateglinide and acarbose increased post-prandial ghrelin suppression at 120 min and reduced ghrelin area under the curve (AUCGHRL) (p<0.05), while only nateglinide increased postprandial ghrelin suppression at 30 min (p<0.01), which was positively correlated with the increased early-phase insulin secretion by 4 weeks of nateglinide therapy (r=0.48, p=0.05). The decrease in AUCGHRL was positively correlated with the decrease in daily average glucose excursion and mean glucose values either by 4 weeks of nateglinide or acarbose therapy (p<0.05). Both nateglinide and acarbose increase post-prandial ghrelin suppression. Improved ghrelin regulation is most likely to play a role in glucose stability in T2DM patients with nateglinide or acarbose therapy.\n\nCeylon cinnamon does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.\n\nPubMed\n\nWickenberg, Jennie; Lindstedt, Sandra; Berntorp, Kerstin; Nilsson, Jan; Hlebowicz, Joanna\n\n2012-06-01\n\nPrevious studies on healthy subjects have shown that the intake of 6 g Cinnamomum cassia reduces postprandial glucose and that the intake of 3 g C. cassia reduces insulin response, without affecting postprandial glucose concentrations. Coumarin, which may damage the liver, is present in C. cassia, but not in Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The aim of the present study was to study the effect of C. zeylanicum on postprandial concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, glycaemic index (GI) and insulinaemic index (GII) in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). A total of ten subjects with IGT were assessed in a crossover trial. A standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered together with placebo or C. zeylanicum capsules. Finger-prick capillary blood samples were taken for glucose measurements and venous blood for insulin measurements, before and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after the start of the OGTT. The ingestion of 6 g C. zeylanicum had no significant effect on glucose level, insulin response, GI or GII. Ingestion of C. zeylanicum does not affect postprandial plasma glucose or insulin levels in human subjects. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Europe has suggested the replacement of C. cassia by C. zeylanicum or the use of aqueous extracts of C. cassia to lower coumarin exposure. However, the positive effects seen with C. cassia in subjects with poor glycaemic control would then be lost.\n\nTheobromine does not affect postprandial lipid metabolism and duodenal gene expression, but has unfavorable effects on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmolders, Lotte; Mensink, Ronald P; Boekschoten, Mark V; de Ridder, Rogier J J; Plat, Jogchum\n\n2018-04-01\n\nChocolate consumption is associated with a decreased risk for CVD. Theobromine, a compound in cocoa, may explain these effects as it favorably affected fasting serum lipids. However, long-term effects of theobromine on postprandial metabolism as well as underlying mechanisms have never been studied. The objective was to evaluate the effects of 4-week theobromine consumption (500Â mg/day) on fasting and postprandial lipid, lipoprotein and glucose metabolism, and duodenal gene expression. In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, 44 healthy men and women, with low baseline HDL-C concentrations consumed 500Â mg theobromine or placebo daily. After 4-weeks, fasting blood was sampled and subjects participated in a 4-hÂ postprandial test. Blood was sampled frequently for analysis of lipid and glucose metabolism. In a subgroup of 10 men, 5Â h after meal consumption duodenal biopsies were taken for microarray analysis. 4-weeks theobromine consumption lowered fasting LDL-C (-0.21Â mmol/L; PÂ =Â 0.006), and apoB100 (-0.04Â g/L; PÂ =Â 0.022), tended to increase HDL-C (0.03Â mmol/L; PÂ =Â 0.088) and increased hsCRP (1.2Â mg/L; PÂ =Â 0.017) concentrations. Fasting apoA-I, TAG, FFA, glucose and insulin concentrations were unchanged. In the postprandial phase, theobromine consumption increased glucose (PÂ =Â 0.026), insulin (PÂ =Â 0.011) and FFA (PÂ =Â 0.003) concentrations, while lipids and (apo)lipoproteins were unchanged. In duodenal biopsies, microarray analysis showed no consistent changes in expression of genes, pathways or gene sets related to lipid, cholesterol or glucose metabolism. It is not likely that the potential beneficial effects of cocoa on CVD can be ascribed to theobromine. Although theobromine lowers serum LDL-C concentrations, it did not change fasting HDL-C, apoA-I, or postprandial lipid concentrations and duodenal gene expression, and unfavorably affected postprandial glucose and insulin responses. This trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov under\n\nGlycemic index and postprandial blood glucose response to Japanese strawberry jam in normal adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurotobi, Tomoka; Fukuhara, Kimiaki; Inage, Hiroko; Kimura, Shuichi\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe investigated in 30 healthy adults the glycemic index (GI) of five strawberry jams made from various sugar compositions. The jam containing the highest ratio of glucose showed a high GI, while that containing a high ratio of fructose, a jam made from polydextrose, showed a low GI. There was a high correlation (r=0.969, p=0.006) between the GI and the predicted GI calculated from the sugar composition of the jams. Moreover, the influence on postprandial blood glucose response after an intake of only 20 g of jam and one slice of bread with 20 g jam was measured in 8 healthy adults. The blood glucose level after an intake of 20 g of the high GI jam containing the high glucose ratio was higher than that of other jams at 15 min, but there was no significant difference after 30 min. Regardless of whether the GI was low or high, differences in the jams were not observed in the postprandial blood glucose level or the area under the curve after eating either one slice of bread (60 g) or one slice of bread with less than 20 g of jam.\n\nEffect of cinnamon on postprandial blood glucose, gastric emptying, and satiety in healthy subjects.\n\nPubMed\n\nHlebowicz, Joanna; Darwiche, Gassan; BjÃ¶rgell, Ola; AlmÃ©r, Lars-Olof\n\n2007-06-01\n\nPrevious studies of patients with type 2 diabetes showed that cinnamon lowers fasting serum glucose, triacylglycerol, and LDL- and total cholesterol concentrations. We aimed to study the effect of cinnamon on the rate of gastric emptying, the postprandial blood glucose response, and satiety in healthy subjects. The gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured by using standardized real-time ultrasonography. Fourteen healthy subjects were assessed by using a crossover trial. The subjects were examined after an 8-h fast if they had normal fasting blood glucose concentrations. GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15-90 min after ingestion of 300 g rice pudding (GER1) or 300 g rice pudding and 6 g cinnamon (GER2). The median value of GER1 was 37%, and that of GER2 was 34.5%. The addition of cinnamon to the rice pudding significantly delayed gastric emptying and lowered the postprandial glucose response (P < 0.05 for both). The reduction in the postprandial blood glucose concentration was much more noticeable and pronounced than was the lowering of the GER. The effect of cinnamon on satiety was not significant. The intake of 6 g cinnamon with rice pudding reduces postprandial blood glucose and delays gastric emptying without affecting satiety. Inclusion of cinnamon in the diet lowers the postprandial glucose response, a change that is at least partially explained by a delayed GER.\n\nImpact of Lipoprotein Lipase Gene Polymorphism, S447X, on Postprandial Triacylglycerol and Glucose Response to Sequential Meal Ingestion\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShatwan, Israa M.; Minihane, Anne-Marie; Williams, Christine M.; Lovegrove, Julie A.; Jackson, Kim G.; Vimaleswaran, Karani S.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key rate-limiting enzyme for the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (TAG) in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein. Given that postprandial assessment of lipoprotein metabolism may provide a more physiological perspective of disturbances in lipoprotein homeostasis compared to assessment in the fasting state, we have investigated the influence of two commonly studied LPL polymorphisms (rs320, HindIII; rs328, S447X) on postprandial lipaemia, in 261 participants using a standard sequential meal challenge. S447 homozygotes had lower fasting HDL-C (p = 0.015) and a trend for higher fasting TAG (p = 0.057) concentrations relative to the 447X allele carriers. In the postprandial state, there was an association of the S447X polymorphism with postprandial TAG and glucose, where S447 homozygotes had 12% higher TAG area under the curve (AUC) (p = 0.037), 8.4% higher glucose-AUC (p = 0.006) and 22% higher glucose-incremental area under the curve (IAUC) (p = 0.042). A significant geneâgender interaction was observed for fasting TAG (p = 0.004), TAG-AUC (Pinteraction = 0.004) and TAG-IAUC (Pinteraction = 0.016), where associations were only evident in men. In conclusion, our study provides novel findings of an effect of LPL S447X polymorphism on the postprandial glucose and gender-specific impact of the polymorphism on fasting and postprandial TAG concentrations in response to sequential meal challenge in healthy participants.

Postmeal exercise reduces postprandial glucose and may offer additional glucose-lowering benefit beyond that of metformin alone, yet controversy exists surrounding exercise and metformin interactions. It is currently unknown how postmeal exercise and metformin monotherapy in combination will affect postprandial glucose. Thus, we examined the independent and combined effects of postmeal exercise and metformin monotherapy on postprandial glucose. A randomized crossover design was used to assess the influence of postmeal exercise on postprandial glucose excursions in 10 people treated with metformin monotherapy (57âÂ±â10 yr, HbA 1C â=â6.3âÂ±â0.6%). Each participant completed the following four conditions: sedentary and postmeal exercise (5 Ã 10-min bouts of treadmill walking at 60% VÌo 2max ) with metformin and sedentary and postmeal exercise without metformin. Peak postprandial glucose within a 2-h time window and 2-h total area under the curve was assessed after a standardized breakfast meal, using continuous glucose monitoring. Postmeal exercise significantly blunted 2-h peak ( P = 0.001) and 2-h area under the curve ( P = 0.006), with the lowest peak postprandial glucose excursion observed with postmeal exercise and metformin combined ( P < 0.05 vs. all other conditions: metformin/sedentary: 12 Â± 3.4, metformin/exercise: 9.7 Â± 2.3, washout/sedentary: 13.3 Â± 3.2, washout/exercise: 11.1 Â± 3.4 mmol/l). Postmeal exercise and metformin in combination resulted in the lowest peak postprandial glucose excursion compared with either treatment modality alone. Exercise timed to the postprandial phase may be important for optimizing glucose control during metformin monotherapy. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The interactive effects of metformin and exercise on key physiological outcomes remain an area of controversy. Findings from this study show that the combination of\n\nEffect of exercise timing on elevated postprandial glucose levels.\n\nPubMed\n\nHatamoto, Yoichi; Goya, Ryoma; Yamada, Yosuke; Yoshimura, Eichi; Nishimura, Sena; Higaki, Yasuki; Tanaka, Hiroaki\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThere is no consensus regarding optimal exercise timing for reducing postprandial glucose (PPG). The purpose of the present study was to determine the most effective exercise timing. Eleven participants completed four different exercise patterns 1 ) no exercise; 2 ) preprandial exercise (jogging); 3 ) postprandial exercise; and 4 ) brief periodic exercise intervention (three sets of 1-min jogging + 30 s of rest, every 30 min, 20 times total) in a random order separated by a minimum of 5 days. Preprandial and postprandial exercise consisted of 20 sets of intermittent exercise (1 min of jogging + 30 s rest per set) repeated 3 times per day. Total daily exercise volume was identical for all three exercise patterns. Exercise intensities were 62.4âÂ±â12.9% VÌo 2peak Blood glucose concentrations were measured continuously throughout each trial for 24 h. After breakfast, peak blood glucose concentrations were lower with brief periodic exercise (99âÂ±â6 mg/dl) than those with preprandial and postprandial exercise (109âÂ±â10 and 115âÂ±â14 mg/dl, respectively, P < 0.05, effect sizeâ=â0.517). After lunch, peak glucose concentrations were lower with brief periodic exercise than those with postprandial exercise (97âÂ±â5 and 108âÂ±â8 mg/dl, P < 0.05, effect sizeâ=â0.484). After dinner, peak glucose concentrations did not significantly differ among exercise patterns. Areas under the curve over 24 h and 2 h postprandially did not differ among exercise patterns. These findings suggest that brief periodic exercise may be more effective than preprandial and postprandial exercise at attenuating PPG in young active individuals. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This was the first study to investigate the effect of different exercise timing (brief periodic vs. preprandial vs. postprandial exercise) on postprandial glucose (PPG) attenuation in active healthy men. We demonstrated that brief periodic exercise attenuated peak PPG levels more than preprandial and postprandial\n\nModel-Based Quantification of the Systemic Interplay between Glucose and Fatty Acids in the Postprandial State.\n\nPubMed\n\nSips, Fianne L P; Nyman, Elin; Adiels, Martin; Hilbers, Peter A J; StrÃ¥lfors, Peter; van Riel, Natal A W; Cedersund, Gunnar\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn metabolic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, the systemic regulation of postprandial metabolite concentrations is disturbed. To understand this dysregulation, a quantitative and temporal understanding of systemic postprandial metabolite handling is needed. Of particular interest is the intertwined regulation of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), due to the association between disturbed NEFA metabolism and insulin resistance. However, postprandial glucose metabolism is characterized by a dynamic interplay of simultaneously responding regulatory mechanisms, which have proven difficult to measure directly. Therefore, we propose a mathematical modelling approach to untangle the systemic interplay between glucose and NEFA in the postprandial period. The developed model integrates data of both the perturbation of glucose metabolism by NEFA as measured under clamp conditions, and postprandial time-series of glucose, insulin, and NEFA. The model can describe independent data not used for fitting, and perturbations of NEFA metabolism result in an increased insulin, but not glucose, response, demonstrating that glucose homeostasis is maintained. Finally, the model is used to show that NEFA may mediate up to 30-45% of the postprandial increase in insulin-dependent glucose uptake at two hours after a glucose meal. In conclusion, the presented model can quantify the systemic interactions of glucose and NEFA in the postprandial state, and may therefore provide a new method to evaluate the disturbance of this interplay in metabolic disease.\n\nDifference in postprandial GLP-1 response despite similar glucose kinetics after consumption of wheat breads with different particle size in healthy men.\n\nPubMed\n\nEelderink, Coby; Noort, Martijn W J; Sozer, Nesli; Koehorst, Martijn; Holst, Jens J; Deacon, Carolyn F; Rehfeld, Jens F; Poutanen, Kaisa; Vonk, Roel J; Oudhuis, Lizette; Priebe, Marion G\n\n2017-04-01\n\nUnderlying mechanisms of the beneficial health effects of low glycemic index starchy foods are not fully elucidated yet. We varied the wheat particle size to obtain fiber-rich breads with a high and low glycemic response and investigated the differences in postprandial glucose kinetics and metabolic response after their consumption. Ten healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized, crossover study, consuming 13 C-enriched breads with different structures; a control bread (CB) made from wheat flour combined with wheat bran, and a kernel bread (KB) where 85Â % of flour was substituted with broken wheat kernels. The structure of the breads was characterized extensively. The use of stable isotopes enabled calculation of glucose kinetics: rate of appearance of exogenous glucose, endogenous glucose production, and glucose clearance rate. Additionally, postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, incretins, cholecystokinin, and bile acids were analyzed. Despite the attempt to obtain a bread with a low glycemic response by replacing flour by broken kernels, the glycemic response and glucose kinetics were quite similar after consumption of CB and KB. Interestingly, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response was much lower after KB compared to CB (iAUC, PÂ <Â 0.005). A clear postprandial increase in plasma conjugated bile acids was observed after both meals. Substitution of 85Â % wheat flour by broken kernels in bread did not result in a difference in glucose response and kinetics, but in a pronounced difference in GLP-1 response. Thus, changing the processing conditions of wheat for baking bread can influence the metabolic response beyond glycemia and may therefore influence health.\n\nModel-Based Quantification of the Systemic Interplay between Glucose and Fatty Acids in the Postprandial State\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSips, Fianne L. P.; Nyman, Elin; Adiels, Martin; Hilbers, Peter A. J.; StrÃ¥lfors, Peter; van Riel, Natal A. W.; Cedersund, Gunnar\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn metabolic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, the systemic regulation of postprandial metabolite concentrations is disturbed. To understand this dysregulation, a quantitative and temporal understanding of systemic postprandial metabolite handling is needed. Of particular interest is the intertwined regulation of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), due to the association between disturbed NEFA metabolism and insulin resistance. However, postprandial glucose metabolism is characterized by a dynamic interplay of simultaneously responding regulatory mechanisms, which have proven difficult to measure directly. Therefore, we propose a mathematical modelling approach to untangle the systemic interplay between glucose and NEFA in the postprandial period. The developed model integrates data of both the perturbation of glucose metabolism by NEFA as measured under clamp conditions, and postprandial time-series of glucose, insulin, and NEFA. The model can describe independent data not used for fitting, and perturbations of NEFA metabolism result in an increased insulin, but not glucose, response, demonstrating that glucose homeostasis is maintained. Finally, the model is used to show that NEFA may mediate up to 30â45% of the postprandial increase in insulin-dependent glucose uptake at two hours after a glucose meal. In conclusion, the presented model can quantify the systemic interactions of glucose and NEFA in the postprandial state, and may therefore provide a new method to evaluate the disturbance of this interplay in metabolic disease.

No systematic review has addressed the effect of isoenergetic fructose replacement of glucose or sucrose on peak postprandial glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations. Objective: The objective of this study was to review the evidence for postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses after isoenergetic replacement of either glucose or sucrose in foods or beverages with fructose. Design: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and clinicaltrials.gov The date of the last search was 26 April 2016. We included randomized controlled trials measuring peak postprandial glycemia after isoenergetic replacement of glucose, sucrose, or both with fructose in healthy adults or children with or without diabetes. The main outcomes analyzed were peak postprandial blood glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations. Results: Replacement of either glucose or sucrose by fructose resulted in significantly lowered peak postprandial blood glucose, particularly in people with prediabetes and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Similar results were obtained for insulin. Peak postprandial blood triglyceride concentrations did not significantly increase. Conclusions: Strong evidence exists that substituting fructose for glucose or sucrose in food or beverages lowers peak postprandial blood glucose and insulin concentrations. Isoenergetic replacement does not result in a substantial increase in blood triglyceride concentrations.

In this study, arabinoxylans, the most abundant dietary fiber in most cereals, were extracted under alkaline conditions and cross-linked by using laccase. Cross-linking of the arabinoxylans led to gel formation and increased in vitro viscosity almost 100-fold after drying and rehydration. To determine the ability of these cross-linked arabinoxylans to blunt the postprandial blood glucose curve of a meal, arabinoxylans, either native or cross-linked, and either prehydrated or not, were fed to rats as part of a meal, and blood glucose was monitored at intervals after the meal. Cellulose, a nonviscous fiber, served as a control. Cross-linked, but not native, arabinoxylans significantly reduced the area under the blood glucose time curve 5-9% relative to cellulose, indicating that they remained viscous within the gastrointestinal tract, and thus likely provide the health benefits found with other viscous fibers.\n\nAdditive postprandial blood glucose-attenuating and satiety-enhancing effect of cinnamon and acetic acid.\n\nPubMed\n\nMettler, Samuel; Schwarz, Isaline; Colombani, Paolo C\n\n2009-10-01\n\nCinnamon and vinegar or acetic acid were reported to reduce the postprandial blood glucose response. We hypothesized that the combination of these substances might result in an additive effect. Therefore, we determined the 2-hour postprandial blood glucose and satiety response to a milk rice meal supplemented with either cinnamon or acetic acid on their own or in combination. Subjects (n = 27) consumed the meal on 4 occasions as either pure (control trial), with 4 g cinnamon, 28 mmol acetic acid, or the combination of cinnamon + acetic acid. Blood glucose and satiety were assessed before eating and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes postprandially. At 15 minutes, the combination of cinnamon + acetic acid resulted in a significantly reduced blood glucose concentration compared with the control meal (P = .021). The incremental area under the blood glucose response curve over 120 minutes did, however, not differ between the trials (P = .539). The satiety score of the cinnamon + acetic acid trial was significantly higher than that in the control trial at 15 (P = .024) and 30 minutes (P = .024), but the incremental area under the curve of the satiety response did not differ (P = .116) between the trials. In conclusion, the significant effect of the combination of cinnamon and acetic acid on blood glucose and satiety immediately after meal intake indicated an additive effect of the 2 substances. Whether larger doses of cinnamon and acetic acid may result in a more substantial additive effect on blood glucose or satiety remains to be investigated.\n\nModification of beta-cell response to different postprandial blood glucose concentrations by prandial repaglinide and combined acarbose/repaglinide application.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosak, C; Hofmann, U; Paulwitz, O\n\n2004-06-01\n\nThis study was designed to compare the effects of repaglinide plus acarbose combination treatment to repaglinide alone on postprandial glucose, serum insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin concentrations. A total of 40 patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (fasting blood glucose: 120-180 mg/dl; postprandial blood glucose: 140-240 mg/dl) were included in this single-centre, controlled, randomised, single-dose, cross-over study. On two consecutive days, patients either received 2 mg repaglinide 15 min before breakfast followed by 100 mg acarbose with breakfast or repaglinide alone. Two fasting (7.30 h, 8.00 h) and five postprandial blood samples (from 8.30 h to 12.00 h) were taken for blood glucose, serum insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin determination. Repaglinide plus acarbose treatment significantly reduced the mean increase in postprandial blood glucose levels (24.2+/-18.2 mg/dl) compared to repaglinide alone (51.1+/-29.0 mg/dl; p<0.001). Serum insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin levels [mean area under the curve (AUC7.30-12.00h)] were significantly lower than those observed with repaglinide monotherapy (e.g. insulin: 1089.2+/-604.5 hr x pmol/l and 1596.8+/-1080.6 hr x pmol/l, resp., p<0.001), suggesting that acarbose modifies the rapid insulin release induced by repaglinide. Prandial treatment with a combination of acarbose and repaglinide results in an additive glucose lowering effect and modified insulin secretion compared to repaglinide alone. Postprandial hyperglycaemia is not abolished by rapid stimulation of insulin release induced by repaglinide. Additional reduction of postprandial blood glucose by acarbose modifies the stimulation of insulin release.\n\nEffects of milk and milk constituents on postprandial lipid and glucose metabolism in overweight and obese men.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Meijl, Leonie E C; Mensink, Ronald P\n\n2013-08-28\n\nStudies have suggested that two major milk constituents, casein and Ca, favourably affect postprandial responses. However, effects of milk on postprandial metabolism are unknown. We therefore investigated effects of using milk with a fat-containing meal on lipid and glucose responses in overweight men. To identify the constituent responsible for possible effects, we also studied responses to Ca and protein. A total of sixteen men (BMI .27 kg/m2) participated in four postprandial tests. They consumed a breakfast (44 g of fat) plus a drink: a control drink, low-fat milk or a protein and Ca drink (500 ml). Blood samples were taken before the meals and at regular time points during 6 h thereafter. Compared with control, the incremental AUC (iAUC) for serum TAG was increased by 44% after the protein meal (PÂ¼0Â·015). Although the iAUC were not different (PÂ¼0Â·051), peak glucose concentrations were reduced by 24% after protein intake, as compared with control (PÂ¼0Â·021). The decrease of 18% after milk intake did not reach statistical significance. Compared with the milk meal, the iAUC for insulin was 52% lower after the control meal (PÂ¼0Â·035) and 51% after the protein meal (PÂ¼0Â·005). The present results indicate that the intake of milk with a fat-containing meal enhances postprandial TAG and insulin responses and may blunt glucose increases. The protein fraction of milk seems to be the main determinant for the effects on TAG and glucose. Ca did not change any of the postprandial responses.\n\nSemaglutide improves postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism, and delays first-hour gastric emptying in subjects with obesity.\n\nPubMed\n\nHjerpsted, Julie B; Flint, Anne; Brooks, Ashley; Axelsen, Mads B; Kvist, Trine; Blundell, John\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTo investigate the effects of semaglutide on fasting and postprandial glucose and lipid responses, and on gastric emptying. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, crossover trial. Subjects with obesity (Nâ=â30) received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, dose-escalated to 1.0âmg, or placebo. After each 12-week treatment period, glucose and lipid metabolism were assessed before and after standardized meals. Gastric emptying (paracetamol absorption test) and peptide YY (PYY) response were also assessed. Semaglutide treatment significantly lowered fasting concentrations of glucose and glucagon, and increased insulin vs placebo (estimated treatment ratio: 0.95 [95% confidence interval: 0.91, 0.98]; 0.86 [0.75, 0.98]; 1.45 [1.20, 1.75], respectively). Postprandial glucose metabolism significantly improved with semaglutide vs placebo (incremental area under the curve 0 to 5âhours [iAUC 0-5h ]; estimated treatment difference: glucose -1.34âmmolâh/L [-2.42, -0.27]; insulin -921âpmol h/L [-1461, -381]; C-peptide -1.42ânmolâh/L [-2.33, -0.51]). Fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism improved with semaglutide vs placebo. First-hour gastric emptying after the meal was delayed with semaglutide vs placebo (AUC 0-1h ; estimated treatment ratio: 0.73 [0.61, 0.87]); this may have contributed to the lower postprandial glucose increase in semaglutide-treated subjects. Overall gastric emptying (AUC 0-5h ) was not statistically different between treatments. Fasting and postprandial PYY responses were significantly lower with semaglutide vs placebo (Pâ=â.0397 and Pâ=â.0097, respectively). Semaglutide improved fasting and postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism. Overall gastric emptying was similar to that with placebo; however, the observed first-hour delay with semaglutide may contribute to a slower entry of glucose into the circulation.

This study examined the glycemic effects of VERSAFIBE 1490â¢ resistant starch, a distarch phosphate derived from potato, containing 90% total dietary fiber (TDF, AOAC 991.43 method). In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 28 healthy adults consumed a cookie containing 24 g fiber from distarch phosphate (fiber cookie) or a control cookie containing 0.5 g fiber that was matched for fat, protein, and total carbohydrate content. Intravenous blood glucose, intravenous blood insulin, and capillary glucose were measured for two hours after cookie consumption. The fiber cookie reduced the post-prandial blood glucose incremental area under the curve from 0 to 120 minutes (iAUC 0-120min ) by 44% ( p = 0.004) and reduced the maximum glucose concentration (C max0-120min ) by 8% ( p = 0.001) versus the control cookie. Consumption of the fiber cookie resulted in a significant 46% reduction of the post-prandial serum insulin iAUC 0-120min ( p < 0.001) and a 23% reduction in Cmax 0-120min ( p = 0.007) versus the control cookie. This study shows that distarch phosphate RS4 can be incorporated into a cookie and significantly reduce post-prandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy adults.\n\nEffects of Smoking Versus Nonsmoking on Postprandial Glucose Metabolism in Heavy Smokers Compared With Nonsmokers.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrÃ¸ndahl, Magnus F; Bagger, Jonatan I; Lund, Asger; Faurschou, Annesofie; Rehfeld, Jens F; Holst, Jens J; VilsbÃ¸ll, Tina; Knop, Filip K\n\n2018-06-01\n\nEpidemiological studies suggest that smoking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that smoking-derived nicotine and ensuing activation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and the autonomic nervous system would have a detrimental effect on postprandial glucose metabolism and, thus, potentially constitute a link between smoking and the development of type 2 diabetes. We subjected 11 male heavy smokers to two identical 4-h liquid mixed-meal tests: one with concomitant cigarette smoking (immediately before and after meal intake) and one without smoking. Twelve age-, sex-, and BMI-matched nonsmokers underwent an identical meal test without smoking. The smokers were characterized by higher fasting plasma concentrations of glucagon compared with the nonsmokers. Among smokers, cigarette smoking before and after the meal significantly reduced postprandial plasma glucose excursions. There were no differences in gut or pancreatic hormone concentrations between the test days in the smoking group, and the responses were similar to those in the control group. Our results suggest that smoking in association with meal intake decreases the postprandial plasma glucose concentrations, possibly through decreased gastric emptying, and that elevated fasting glucagon concentrations rather than smoking-induced alterations in postprandial glucose and hormone responses may be associated with the elevated risk of type 2 diabetes in chronic smokers.

Our objective was to investigate the effects of pramlintide, known to suppress glucagon and delay gastric emptying, on postprandial glucose fluxes in T1D. This was a single-center, inpatient, randomized, crossover study. Twelve patients with T1D who completed the study were analyzed. Subjects were studied on two occasions with or without pramlintide. Triple tracer mixed-meal method and oral minimal model were used to estimate postprandial glucose turnover and insulin sensitivity (SI). Integrated liver insulin sensitivity was calculated based on glucose turnover. Plasma glucagon and insulin were measured. Glucose turnover and SI were the main outcome measures. With pramlintide, 2-hour postprandial glucose, insulin, glucagon, glucose turnover, and SI indices showed: plasma glucose excursions were reduced (difference in incremental area under the curve [iAUC], 444.0 mMmin, P = .0003); plasma insulin concentrations were lower (difference in iAUC, 7642.0 pMmin; P = .0099); plasma glucagon excursions were lower (difference in iAUC, 1730.6 pg/mlmin; P = .0147); meal rate of glucose appearance was lower (difference in iAUC: 1196.2 Î¼M/kg fat free mass [FFM]; P = .0316), endogenous glucose production was not different (difference in iAUC: -105.5 Î¼M/kg FFM; P = .5842), rate of glucose disappearance was lower (difference in iAUC: 1494.2 Î¼M/kg FFM; P = .0083). SI and liver insulin sensitivity were not different between study visits (P > .05). Inhibition of glucagon and gastric emptying delaying reduced 2-hour prandial glucose excursions in T1D by delaying meal rate of glucose appearance.\n\nPostprandial glucose and insulin levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients after consumption of ready-to-eat mixed meals.\n\nPubMed\n\nManios, Yannis; Moschonis, George; Mavrogianni, Christina; Tsoutsoulopoulou, Konstantina; Kogkas, Stergios; Lambrinou, Christina-Paulina; Efstathopoulou, Eirini\n\n2017-04-01\n\nTo compare the effects of three ready-to-eat mixed meals, with a high fiber content and low glycemic index, on postprandial glycemic and insulinemic response in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The current study followed a prospective, three-way, cross-over design. Twenty-four patients with T2DM consumed three ready-to-eat mixed meals, i.e., \"wild greens pie\" (meal 1), \"chicken burgers with boiled vegetables\" (meal 2) and \"vegetable moussaka\" (meal 3) and an oral glucose load, all providing 50Â g of carbohydrates. Venous blood was collected at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120Â min postprandial. Statistical analyses included repeated measures analysis of variance and calculations of the area under the glucose and insulin curves (AUC) for each one of the test meals and the oral glucose load. Patients consuming each one of the three mixed meals showed better postprandial glycemic responses compared to the oral glucose load (PÂ <Â 0.001). Furthermore, patients consuming meal 3 showed a better insulinemic response compared to the oral glucose load and meal 1, after 60 and 120Â min postprandial, respectively (PÂ <Â 0.05). In addition, the increase observed in HOMA-IR values from T0 to T120 was significantly lower for meal 3, compared to the oral glucose load (PÂ <Â 0.001). The three ready-to-eat mixed meals examined in the present study were found to elicit significantly lower glycemic responses compared to the oral glucose load in diabetic patients. The mixed meals examined in the present study could be proposed as effective, palatable and practical solutions for diabetics for glucose control.\n\nEffects of a Bioavailable Arabinoxylan-enriched White Bread Flour on Postprandial Glucose Response in Normoglycemic Subjects.\n\nPubMed\n\nGiulia Falchi, Anna; Grecchi, Ilaria; Muggia, Chiara; Palladini, Giuseppina; Perlini, Stefano\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe beneficial effects of soluble fibers on carbohydrate metabolism are well documented. In this regard, we tested an arabinoxylan-enriched white bread flour, obtained by a patented process by which the bran extracted from the milling process is enzymatically hydrolyzed in order to separate the soluble fraction fiber from the insoluble fiber. We recruited 24 healthy normoglycemic volunteers [Age 34-61 Â± 12.5 y; Body Mass Index (BMI) 22.1 Â± 2.5Â kg/m(2); Waist circumference (WC) 84.43 Â± 8.0Â cm; Fat Mass (FM) 22.7 Â± 8.0%] attending the Dietetics Outpatient Clinic of the Internal Medicine Department at IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo Foundation, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. Subjects acutely consumed arabinoxylan-enriched white bread (weight: 100Â g) or isoenergetic control breads, in a double-blind crossover study design. Plasma glucose levels were measured just before bread administration and 30 minutes afterwards. The 30-minute peak postprandial glucose concentrations after arabinoxylan-enriched meals were significantly lower than after the control meal (107Â±4.6Â mg/dL vs. 121 Â± 5.2Â mg/dL; p < 0.05). The here-reported results show how postprandial glucose responses were improved by ingestion of the arabinoxylan-enriched meal. Further studies are needed to clarify whether daily consumption of arabinoxylan-enriched bread will benefit patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nEffects of Consuming Preloads with Different Energy Density and Taste Quality on Energy Intake and Postprandial Blood Glucose\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTey, Siew Ling; Salleh, Nurhazwani; Forde, Ciaran G.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nConsumption of reduced energy dense foods and drink has the potential to reduce energy intake and postprandial blood glucose concentrations. In addition, the taste quality of a meal (e.g., sweet or savoury) may play a role in satiation and food intake. The objective of this randomised crossover study was to examine whether energy density and taste quality has an impact on energy intake and postprandial blood glucose response. Using a preload design, participants were asked to consume a sweet (âCheng Tengâ) or a savoury (broth) preload soup in high energy density (HED; around 0.50 kcal/g; 250 kcal) or low energy density (LED; around 0.12 kcal/g; 50 kcal) in mid-morning and an ad libitum lunch was provided an hour after the preload. Participants recorded their food intake for the rest of the day after they left the study site. Energy compensation and postprandial blood glucose response were measured in 32 healthy lean males (mean age = 28.9 years, mean BMI = 22.1 kg/m2). There was a significant difference in ad libitum lunch intake between treatments (p = 0.012), with higher intake in sweet LED and savoury LED compared to sweet HED and savoury HED. Energy intake at subsequent meals and total daily energy intake did not differ between the four treatments (both p â¥ 0.214). Consumption of HED preloads resulted in a larger spike in postprandial blood glucose response compared with LED preloads, irrespective of taste quality (p < 0.001). Energy density rather than taste quality plays an important role in energy compensation and postprandial blood glucose response. This suggests that regular consumption of low energy-dense foods has the potential to reduce overall energy intake and to improve glycemic control.

First, 50 IFG and 50 healthy subjects were recruited; and 2â-h postprandial changes in FFA profiles were determined. Second, the 50 IFG subjects then received three different loads: glucose load (GL), high glycemic index (HGI) load and low glycemic index (LGI) load, respectively. FFA profile, glucose, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and inflammatory biomarkers were assayed at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120âmin. Postprandial stearic acid (C18:0) increased compared with baseline in all subjects, whereas the change in postprandial C18:0 was more marked in IFG subjects than in healthy subjects. Compared with subjects who received the GL and HGI load, the area under the curve for insulin, GLP-1, C18:0 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha significantly decreased and adiponectin increased in subjects who received the LGI load. The rise in postprandial C18:0 in IFG subjects was inhibited by LGI load.\n\nA novel fiber composite ingredient incorporated into a beverage and bar blunts postprandial serum glucose and insulin responses: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Connor, Lauren E; Campbell, Wayne W\n\n2016-03-01\n\nPrevious research supports that consumption of resistant starch and guar gum independently influences insulin-mediated glucose responses to meals. This research assessed a novel co-processed fiber composite (FC) ingredient comprising whole-grain high-amylose maize flour and viscous guar gum on glucose and insulin responses to co-consumed and subsequent meals in humans. It was hypothesized that a smoothie-type beverage or a cold-pressed snack bar containing the FC would blunt and sustain serum glucose and insulin postprandial responses compared with maltodextrin (MD). The beverage and bar were assessed in 2 separate studies using identical protocols. Young, nondiabetic, nonobese adults participated in 2 testing days (randomized crossover design) separated by at least 1 week for both food forms. On each testing day, the FC or MD product was consumed with a low-fiber standardized breakfast followed by a low-fiber standardized lunch (with no FC or MD) 4 hours later. Blood samples were collected at baseline and incrementally throughout the 8-hour testing day. One-tailed paired t tests were performed to compare treatment areas under the curve, and a doubly repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to compare treatment responses at individual time points (P< .05, Bonferroni corrected). The FC blunted the postprandial glucose and insulin responses compared with MD, including a robust glucose and insulin response reduction after breakfast and a continued modest glycemic second-meal reduction after lunch in both the beverage and the bar. These findings support the use of this novel whole-grain FC ingredient in a beverage or bar for insulin-mediated glucose control in young healthy adults. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Insulin resistance, resulting in increased fasting and postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels, is commonly observed in obese individuals. The objective of the study was to compare declines in postprandial glycemic response in normal-weight and obese subjects with ingestion of 6 g ground cinnamon. In a crossover study, subjects consumed 50 g available carbohydrate in instant farina cereal, served plain or with 6 g ground cinnamon. Blood glucose concentration, the main outcome measure, was assessed at minutes 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120. Repeated-measures analysis of variance evaluated the effects of body mass index (BMI) group, dietary condition, and time on blood glucose. Paired t-test assessed blood glucose at individual time points and glucose area under the curve (AUC) between dietary conditions. Thirty subjects between the ages of 18 and 30 years, 15 with BMIs between 18.5 and 24.9 and 15 with BMIs of 30.0 or more, completed the study. There was no significant difference in blood glucose between the two BMI groups at any time point. However, in a combined analysis of all subjects, the addition of cinnamon to the cereal significantly reduced 120-minute glucose AUC (P=0.008) and blood glucose at 15 (P=0.001), 30 (P<0.001), 45 (P<0.001), and 60 (P=0.001) minutes. At 120 minutes, blood glucose was significantly higher with cinnamon consumption (P<0.001). These results suggest cinnamon may be effective in moderating postprandial glucose response in normal weight and obese adults. Copyright Â© 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

A new strategy that coordinates basal and bolus insulin infusion to cope with postprandial glycemia in pump therapy is proposed. Superior performance of this new strategy is demonstrated through a formal analysis of attainable performances in an in silico study. Methods The set inversion via interval analysis algorithm has been applied to obtain the feasible set of basal and bolus doses that, for a given meal, mathematically guarantee a postprandial response fulfilling the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines (i.e., no hypoglycemia and 2 h postprandial glucose below 140 mg/dl). Hypoglycemia has been defined as a glucose value below 70 mg/dl. A 5 h time horizon has been considered for a 70 kg in silico T1DM subject consuming meals in the range of 30 to 80 g of carbohydrates. Results The computed feasible sets demonstrate that current separated basal/bolus strategy dramatically limits the attainable performance. For a nominal basal of 0.8 IU/h leading to a basal glucose of approximately 100 mg/dl, IDF guidelines cannot be fulfilled for meals greater than 50 g of carbohydrates, independent of the bolus insulin computed. However, coordinating the basal and bolus insulin delivery can achieve this. A decrement of basal insulin during the postprandial period is required together with an increase in bolus insulin, in appropriate percentages, which is meal dependent. After 3 h, basal insulin can be restored to its nominal value. Conclusions The new strategy meets IDF guidelines in a typical day, contrary to the standard basal/bolus strategy, yielding a mean 2 h postprandial glucose reduction of 36.4 mg/dl without late hypoglycemia. The application of interval analysis for the computation of feasible sets is demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the analysis of attainable performance in glucose\n\nEffects on cognitive performance of modulating the postprandial blood glucose profile at breakfast.\n\nPubMed\n\nNilsson, A; Radeborg, K; BjÃ¶rck, I\n\n2012-09-01\n\nConsidering the importance of glucose as a brain substrate, the postprandial rate of glucose delivery to the blood could be expected to affect cognitive functions. The purpose was to evaluate to what extent the rate of glucose absorption affected measures of cognitive performance in the postprandial period. In addition, cognitive performance was evaluated in relation to individual glucoregulation. A white wheat bread (WWB) enriched with guar gum (G-WWB) with the capacity to produce a low but sustained blood glucose net increment was developed. The G-WWB was evaluated in the postprandial period after breakfast with respect to effects on cognitive function (working memory and selective attention (SA)) in 40 healthy adults (49-71 years, body mass index 20-29 kg/m(2)), using a high glycaemic index WWB for comparison in a randomised crossover design. The G-WWB improved outcome in the cognitive tests (SA test) in the later postprandial period (75-225 min) in comparison with the WWB (P<0.01). Subjects with better glucoregulation performed superior in cognitive tests compared with subjects with worse glucoregulation (P<0.05). Beneficial effects on cognitive performance were observed with the G-WWB in the late postprandial period. The positive effect is suggested to emanate from improved insulin sensitivity, possibly in a combination with an enhanced neural energy supply. The results highlight the importance of carbohydrate foods that induces a low but sustained blood glucose profile in enhancing postprandial cognitive functions.\n\nMetabolomics reveals differences in postprandial responses to breads and fasting metabolic characteristics associated with postprandial insulin demand in postmenopausal women.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoazzami, Ali A; Shrestha, Aahana; Morrison, David A; Poutanen, Kaisa; MykkÃ¤nen, Hannu\n\n2014-06-01\n\nChanges in serum metabolic profile after the intake of different food products (e.g., bread) can provide insight into their interaction with human metabolism. Postprandial metabolic responses were compared after the intake of refined wheat (RWB), whole-meal rye (WRB), and refined rye (RRB) breads. In addition, associations between the metabolic profile in fasting serum and the postprandial concentration of insulin in response to different breads were investigated. Nineteen postmenopausal women with normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance participated in a randomized, controlled, crossover meal study. The test breads, RWB (control), RRB, and WRB, providing 50 g of available carbohydrate, were each served as a single meal. The postprandial metabolic profile was measured using nuclear magnetic resonance and targeted LC-mass spectrometry and was compared between different breads using ANOVA and multivariate models. Eight amino acids had a significant treatment effect (P < 0.01) and a significant treatment Ã time effect (P < 0.05). RWB produced higher postprandial concentrations of leucine (geometric mean: 224; 95% CI: 196, 257) and isoleucine (mean Â± SD: 111 Â± 31.5) compared with RRB (geometric mean: 165; 95% CI: 147, 186; mean Â± SD: 84.2 Â± 22.9) and WRB (geometric mean: 190; 95% CI: 174, 207; mean Â± SD: 95.8 Â± 17.3) at 60 min respectively (P < 0.001). In addition, 2 metabolic subgroups were identified using multivariate models based on the association between fasting metabolic profile and the postprandial concentration of insulin. Women with higher fasting concentrations of leucine and isoleucine and lower fasting concentrations of sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines had higher insulin responses despite similar glucose concentration after all kinds of bread (cross-validated ANOVA, P = 0.048). High blood concentration of branched-chain amino acids, i.e., leucine and isoleucine, has been associated with the increased risk of diabetes, which\n\nDietary guar gum effects on postprandial blood glucose, insulin and hydroxyproline in humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorsdottir, I; Alpsten, M; Andersson, H; Einarsson, S\n\n1989-12-01\n\nMeals (425 kcal) containing various doses of guar gum (0, 2.5, 7.5 or 12.5 g) were ingested by nine healthy male subjects after a 12-h fast. The rise in blood glucose was higher after the control meal without guar gum than after the guar gum-containing meals, which all gave a similar rise in glucose. In contrast, increased doses of guar gum led to a greater reduction in the postprandial rise in insulin. The postprandial increase in serum hydroxyproline, an amino acid added to all meals, was decreased in a similar manner by all of the guar gum doses. Gastric emptying was measured after the control meal without guar gum and the meal containing 12.5 g of guar gum by monitoring 51Cr, which was added to the meals. Guar gum was found to reduce the variation between individuals, as well as the initial rate of gastric emptying, which correlated with changes in both serum hydroxyproline (rs = 0.93, P less than 0.01) and blood glucose (rs = 0.83, P less than 0.01). The effectiveness of guar gum in reducing postprandial response was lost after heating and homogenization for canning. A threshold in the reduction in rise of glucose or hydroxyproline was reached with the lowest dose (2.5 g) of viscous guar gum; larger doses had no additional effects. The reduced absorption seems to be an effect of a slower gastric emptying rate.\n\nLow-glycemic load decreases postprandial insulin and glucose and increases postprandial ghrelin in white but not black women.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrownley, Kimberly A; Heymen, Steve; Hinderliter, Alan L; Galanko, Joseph; Macintosh, Beth\n\n2012-07-01\n\nAlterations in appetite hormones favoring increased postprandial satiety have been implicated in both the glycemic control and potential weight-loss benefits of a low-glycemic diet. Racial differences exist in dietary glycemic load and appetite hormone concentrations. This study examined the impact of glycemic load on appetite hormones in 20 black women [10 normal weight, BMI = 22.8 Â± 1.42 (mean Â± SD); 10 obese, BMI = 35.1 Â± 2.77] and 20 white women (10 normal weight, BMI = 22.9 Â± 1.45; 10 obese, BMI = 34.3 Â± 2.77). Each woman completed two 4.5-d weight-maintenance, mixed-macronutrient, high-glycemic vs. low-glycemic load diets that concluded with a test meal of identical composition. Blood samples collected before and serially for 3 h after each test meal were assayed for plasma ghrelin and serum insulin and glucose concentrations. Compared with the high-glycemic load meal, the low-glycemic load meal was associated with lower insulin(AUC) (P = 0.02), glucose(AUC) (P = 0.01), and urge to eat ratings (P = 0.05) but with higher ghrelin(AUC) (P = 0.008). These results suggest the satiating effect of a low-glycemic load meal is not directly linked to enhanced postprandial suppression of ghrelin. Notably, these effects were significant among white but not black women, suggesting that black women may be less sensitive than white women to the glucoregulatory effects of a low-glycemic load. These findings add to a growing literature demonstrating racial differences in postprandial appetite hormone responses. If reproducible, these findings have implications for individualized diet prescription for the purposes of glucose or weight control in women.\n\nEffects of Unfermented and Fermented Whole Grain Rye Crisp Breads Served as Part of a Standardized Breakfast, on Appetite and Postprandial Glucose and Insulin Responses: A Randomized Cross-over Trial\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJohansson, Daniel P; Lee, Isabella; RisÃ©rus, Ulf; Langton, Maud; Landberg, Rikard\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Whole grain rye products have been shown to increase satiety and elicit lower postprandial insulin response without a corresponding change in glucose response compared with soft refined wheat bread. The underlying mechanisms for these effects have not been fully determined The primary aim of the study was to investigate if whole grain rye crisp bread compared to refined wheat crisp bread, elected beneficial effects on appetite and postprandial insulin response, similarly as for other rye products. Methods In a randomized cross-over trial, 23 healthy volunteers, aged 27-70 years, BMI 18-31.4 kg/m2, were served a standardized breakfast with unfermented whole grain rye crisp bread (uRCB), fermented whole grain rye crisp bread (RCB) or refined wheat crisp bread (WCB), Appetite was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) until 4 h after breakfast. Postprandial glucose and insulin were measured at 0-230 min. Breads were chemically characterized including macronutrients, energy, dietary fiber components, and amino acid composition, and microstructure was characterized with light microscopy. Results Reported fullness was 16% higher (P<0.001), and hunger 11% and 12% lower (P<0.05) after ingestion of uRCB and RCB, respectively, compared with WCB. Postprandial glucose response did not differ significantly between treatments. Postprandial insulin was 10% lower (P<0.007) between 0-120 min but not significantly lower between 0-230 min for RCB compared with WCB. uRCB induced 13% (P<0.002) and 17% (P<0.001) lower postprandial insulin response between 0-230 min compared with RCB and WCB respectively. Conclusion Whole grain rye crisp bread induces higher satiety and lower insulin response compared with refined wheat crisp bread. Microstructural characteristics, dietary fiber content and composition are probable contributors to the increased satiety after ingestion of rye crisp breads. Higher insulin secretion after ingestion of RCB and WCB compared with uRCB may be\n\nEffects of Higher Dietary Protein and Fiber Intakes at Breakfast on Postprandial Glucose, Insulin, and 24-h Interstitial Glucose in Overweight Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmankwaah, Akua F; Sayer, R Drew; Wright, Amy J; Chen, Ningning; McCrory, Megan A; Campbell, Wayne W\n\n2017-04-02\n\nDietary protein and fiber independently influence insulin-mediated glucose control.

To clarify the mechanism(s) to decrease the post-prandial blood glucose concentration, the effect of water-soluble/oil-soluble fraction-depleted PR bran (termed as \"DB\"; which is destarched and defatted PR bran) on post-prandial blood glucose was compared with that of full-fat PR bran (PB) or WR. The test diets, WR diet, PB diet and DB diet which are containing identical amount of available carbohydrate (1.5 g) were fed to Wistar strain rats. Post-prandial blood glucose concentration and incremental area under the curve (IAUC) for DB diet were lower than those for WR diet, and there was no difference between the DB diet and PB diet. Changes in plasma insulin concentration and the IAUC obtained also revealed the same tendency as those observed in blood glucose concentration. These results indicate that the blood glucose-lowering effect of PB diet may be derived from the properties of PB involving substantially higher content of dietary fiber than WR, and that the potential benefit of intake of PR instead of WR in the prevention of diabetic vascular complications.\n\nPostprandial glycemic response to orange juice and nondiet cola: is there a difference?\n\nPubMed\n\nSullivan, M J; Scott, R L\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the effects of unsweetened fruit juice and regular, decaffeinated soda on postprandial serum glucose levels in individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) when these liquids are ingested separately as part of mixed meals. Eighteen individuals with NIDDM consumed three test breakfasts calculated using the diabetic exchange meal-planning system. Foods were identical in each of the breakfasts except for foods in the fruit exchange. Carbohydrate-equivalent amounts of fresh orange slices, unsweetened orange juice, and regular, decaffeinated Coke were consumed in breakfasts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Serum glucose samples were drawn at fasting and 1, 2, and 3 hours postprandially. No difference was found in the postprandial serum glucose response when Coke versus orange juice was consumed in the breakfast. These findings question the appropriateness of using unsweetened fruit juices in routine meal planning for individuals with NIDDM.\n\nCirculating Betatrophin Correlates with Triglycerides and Postprandial Glucose among Different Glucose Tolerance Statuses--A Case-Control Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGao, Ting; Jin, Kairui; Chen, Peihong; Jin, Hua; Yang, Lili; Xie, Xinmiao; Yang, Meili; Hu, Cheng; Yu, Xuemei\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPrevious researches of betatrophin on glucose and lipids metabolism under insulin-resistant condition have reached controversial conclusions. To further identify the possible impact of betatrophin, we measured the circulating betatrophin levels in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients, and in subjects with both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and investigated the relationship between serum betatrophin and other clinical parameters in these patients with different glucose tolerance statuses. A total of 460 permanent residents of the Fengxian District, aged 40-60 years, were enrolled. Based on the results of a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, we selected newly diagnosed T2DM (n = 50) patients and subjects with IGT (n = 51) and NGT (n = 50) according to their age, gender and body mass index (18-28 kg/m2). Anthropometric parameters, glycosylated haemoglobin, blood lipids and fasting insulin were measured. Serum betatrophin concentrations were determined via ELISA. Serum betatrophin levels in T2DM patients were increased significantly compared with IGT and NGT groups, and decreased in subjects with better islet beta cell function. Serum betatrophin was positively correlated with triglyceride, 2-hour postprandial glucose, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase after adjusting for age, sex and body mass index in all subjects. Multiple regression analysis showed that 2-hour postprandial glucose was independently associated with serum betatrophin significantly. Circulating betatrophin is increased in newly-diagnosed T2DM patients and positively correlated with the triglycerides and postprandial glucose levels. The results suggest that betatrophin may participate in glucose and triglycerides metabolism.\n\nPostprandial and basal hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes: Contributions to overall glucose exposure and diabetic complications.\n\nPubMed\n\nMonnier, L; Colette, C\n\n2015-12-01\n\nBoth postprandial and fasting (basal) hyperglycaemia contribute to overall hyperglycaemia (ambient hyperglycaemia) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Postprandial glucose is the main contributor in fairly well controlled individuals, whereas basal hyperglycaemia becomes the preponderant contributor in poorly controlled patients. A more generally acceptable description of the contribution of postprandial glucose is to simply say that the absolute impact of postprandial glucose to HbA1c remains constant at approximately 1% across the entire HbA1c spectrum of non-insulin-treated patients with T2D. While epidemiological and pathophysiological studies seem to indicate that excessive postprandial glucose excursions play a role in or are predictors of cardiovascular diseases, there is still currently a lack of clinical evidence that correcting post-meal hyperglycaemia can improve clinical outcomes. However, even in the absence of consensus, there are many reasons for thinking that excessive postprandial glucose might be an independent risk factor for diabetic complications as it contributes to both overall glucose exposure and glycaemic variability, especially in those who have HbA1c levels < 7.5-8%. Given that excessive glucose fluctuations from peaks to nadirs activate oxidative stress, it seems reasonable to consider that a key player in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, according to the latest IDF guidelines, is post-meal glucose, thereby warranting its assessment and treatment when found at abnormally elevated levels. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals should bear in mind that targeting both post-meal and basal plasma glucose, giving equal consideration to both of them, is probably the best strategy for achieving optimal glycaemic control and thus preventing or reducing the risk of diabetic complications.

Interstitial fluid glucose AUC (IG-AUC) following consumption of 6 different types of foods was measured by MIET. MIET consisted of stamping microneedle arrays, placing hydrogel patches on the areas, and calculating IG-AUC based on glucose levels in the hydrogels. Glycemic index (GI) was determined using IG-AUC and reference AUC measured by blood sampling. IG-AUC strongly correlated with reference AUC (R = 0.91), and GI determined using IG-AUC showed good correlation with that determined by reference AUC (R = 0.88). IG-AUC obtained by MIET can accurately predict the postprandial glucose excursion without blood sampling. In addition, feasibility of GI measurement by MIET was confirmed.\n\nCirculating Betatrophin Correlates with Triglycerides and Postprandial Glucose among Different Glucose Tolerance StatusesâA Case-Control Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Peihong; Jin, Hua; Yang, Lili; Xie, Xinmiao; Yang, Meili; Hu, Cheng; Yu, Xuemei\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose Previous researches of betatrophin on glucose and lipids metabolism under insulin-resistant condition have reached controversial conclusions.

Both postprandial hyperglycemia and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia have been proposed to cause or maintain beta cell failure and progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus in other species. Postprandial glucose, triglyceride, and insulin concentrations have not been compared in lean and obese dogs. We measured serum glucose, triglyceride, and insulin concentrations in nine naturally occurring obese and nine age- and gender-matched lean dogs. After a 24-h fast, dogs were fed half their calculated daily energy requirement of a standardized diet that provided 37% and 40% of metabolizable energy as carbohydrate and fat, respectively. Fasting and postprandial glucose and triglyceride concentrations were greater in the obese dogs (P < 0.001), although the mean insulin concentration for this group was five times greater than that of the lean group (P < 0.001). Most of the 0.6 mM (11 mg/dL) difference in mean postprandial glucose concentrations between lean and obese dogs was attributable to a subset of persistently hyperglycemic obese dogs with mean postprandial glucose concentrations 1.0 mM (18 mg/dL) greater than that in lean dogs. Persistently hyperglycemic obese dogs had lower triglyceride (P = 0.02 to 0.04) and insulin (P < 0.02) concentrations than other obese dogs. None of the dogs developed clinical signs of diabetes mellitus during follow-up for a median of 2.6 yr. We conclude that pancreatic beta cells in dogs are either not sensitive to toxicity because of mild hyperglycemia or lack another component of the pathophysiology of beta cell failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Twenty-seven subjects received oat (providing 5.7 g/day beta-glucan) or wheat (control) cereal products, in random order, incorporated into their usual diets for two weeks. Total energy and fiber (approximately 14 g/day) contents of the cereals were matched. A meal tolerance test that included the study cereal and a high-fat milkshake (1240 kcal, 105 g fat) was performed at the end of each treatment period. Postprandial insulin and glucose responses over 10 hours did not differ between treatments. Peak triglyceride concentration was lower after oat vs. wheat cereal consumption [2.3 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- standard deviation) vs. 2.9 +/- 1.3 mmol/L, p = 0.016]. Mean area under the triglyceride curve also tended to be lower (15.1 +/- 8.2 vs. 17.6 +/- 8.6 hours x mmol/L, p = 0.068). The free fatty acid area under the curve was elevated after the oat vs. the wheat products (3.64 +/- 0.91 vs. 3.38 +/- 0.98 hours x mmol/L, p = 0.018). These results suggest that high-fiber oat cereal influenced postprandial triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, which may have implications regarding cardiovascular disease risk.\n\nEffects of the intake of Undaria pinnatifida (Wakame) and its sporophylls (Mekabu) on postprandial glucose and insulin metabolism.\n\nPubMed\n\nTanemura, Yoko; Yamanaka-Okumura, Hisami; Sakuma, Masae; Nii, Yoshitaka; Taketani, Yutaka; Takeda, Eiji\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLong-term suppression of postprandial glucose concentration is an important dietary strategy for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Because previous reports have suggested that seaweed may exert anti-diabetic effects in animals, the effects of Wakame or Mekabu intake with 200 g white rice, 50 g boiled soybeans, 60 g potatoes, and 40 g broccoli on postprandial glucose, insulin and free fatty acid levels were investigated in healthy subjects. Plasma glucose levels at 30 min and glucose area under the curve (AUC) at 0-30 min after the Mekabu meal were significantly lower than that after the control meal. Plasma glucose and glucose AUC were not different between the Wakame and control meals. Postprandial serum insulin and its AUC and free fatty acid concentration were not different among the three meals. In addition, fullness, satisfaction, and wellness scores were not different among the three meals. Thus, consumption of 70 g Mekabu with a white rice-based breakfast reduces postprandial glucose concentration.\n\nAcarbose, the Î±-glucosidase inhibitor, attenuates the blood pressure and splanchnic blood flow responses to meal in elderly patients with postprandial hypotension concomitant with abnormal glucose metabolism.\n\nPubMed\n\nQiao, Wei; Li, Jing; Li, Ying; Qian, Duan; Chen, Lei; Wei, Xiansen; Jin, Jiangli; Wang, Yong\n\n2016-02-01\n\nPostprandial hypotension (PPH) is a unique clinical phenomenon in the elderly, but its underlying pathogenesis has not been completely elucidated, and drug treatment is still in clinical exploratory stage. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between the fall in postprandial blood pressure and splanchnic blood flow, and to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of PPH by taking acarbose. The study included 20 elderly inpatients diagnosed with PPH concomitant with abnormal glucose metabolism at stable condition. They were treated with 50âmg acarbose with their meal to observe the changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose level, and to monitor the hemodynamics of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) before and after treatment. Without acarbose treatment, patients after a meal had significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, faster postprandial heart rate, higher postprandial glucose level at each period, and increased postprandial SMA blood flow compared with that at fasting state (P<0.05). Acarbose treatment significantly attenuated the decrease of postprandial systolic blood pressures from 35.50Â±12.66 to 22.25Â±6.90âmmHg (P=0.000), the increase of heart rate from 9.67Â±5.94 to 5.33Â±3.20âbeats/min (P=0.016), the increase of postprandial blood glucose from 3.55Â±1.69 to 2.28Â±1.61âmmol/l (P=0.000), the increase of postprandial SMA blood flow from 496.80Â±147.15 to 374.55Â±97.89âml/min (P=0.031), and the incidence of PPH, syncope, falls, dizziness, weakness, and angina pectoris (P<0.05). The maximal decrease of postprandial systolic blood pressure was positively associated with the maximal increase in postprandial SMA blood flow (r=0.351, P=0.026). Acarbose treatment showed no significant side effects. The increase in postprandial splanchnic perfusion is one of the reasons for PPH formation. Acarbose may exert its role in PPH treatment by reducing postprandial gastrointestinal blood perfusion. Giving\n\nEffect of low glycemic index food and postprandial exercise on blood glucose level, oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity.\n\nPubMed\n\nKasuya, Noriaki; Ohta, Shoichiro; Takanami, Yoshikazu; Kawai, Yukari; Inoue, Yutaka; Murata, Isamu; Kanamoto, Ikuo\n\n2015-04-01\n\nLow glycemic index (GI) food and postprandial exercise are non-drug therapies for improving postprandial hyperglycemia. The present randomized, crossover study investigated the effect of low GI food combined with postprandial exercise on postprandial blood glucose level, oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity. A total of 13 healthy subjects were each used in four experiments: i) rice only (control), ii) salad prior to rice (LGI), iii) exercise following rice (EX) and iv) salad prior to rice and exercise following rice (MIX). The blood glucose level, oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity were then measured. At 60 min after the meal, the blood glucose level was observed to be increased in the MIX group compared with that in the LGI group. Furthermore, at 180 min, the antioxidant capacity was found to be reduced in the MIX group compared with those of the LGI and EX groups. These findings suggest that low GI food combined with postprandial exercise does not improve postprandial hyperglycemia. It may be necessary to establish optimal timing and intensity when combining low GI food with postprandial exercise to improve postprandial hyperglycemia.\n\nEffects of Curcuma longa (turmeric) on postprandial plasma glucose and insulin in healthy subjects.\n\nPubMed\n\nWickenberg, Jennie; Ingemansson, Sandra Lindstedt; Hlebowicz, Joanna\n\n2010-10-12\n\nPrevious animal studies have shown that Curcuma (C.) longa lowers plasma glucose. C. longa may thus be a promising ingredient in functional foods aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the study is to study the effect of C. longa on postprandial plasma glucose, insulin levels and glycemic index (GI) in healthy subjects. Fourteen healthy subjects were assessed in a crossover trial. A standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered together with capsules containing a placebo or C. longa. Finger-prick capillary and venous blood samples were collected before, and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after the start of the OGTT to measure the glucose and insulin levels, respectively. The ingestion of 6 g C. longa had no significant effect on the glucose response. The change in insulin was significantly higher 30 min (P = 0.03) and 60 min (P = 0.041) after the OGTT including C. longa. The insulin AUCs were also significantly higher after the ingestion of C. longa, 15 (P = 0.048), 30 (P = 0.035), 90 (P = 0.03), and 120 (P = 0.02) minutes after the OGTT. The ingestion of 6 g C. longa increased postprandial serum insulin levels, but did not seem to affect plasma glucose levels or GI, in healthy subjects. The results indicate that C. longa may have an effect on insulin secretion.\n\nProducts based on a high fiber barley genotype, but not on common barley or oats, lower postprandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy humans.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiljeberg, H G; Granfeldt, Y E; BjÃ¶rck, I M\n\n1996-02-01\n\nPostprandial blood glucose and insulin responses to cereal products made from common barley, oats or a barley genotype containing elevated levels of beta-glucans were evaluated in nine healthy subjects. Porridges were made from commercial Swedish whole-meal barley or oat flours, and a mixed whole-meal porridge using the high fiber barley genotype and commercial Swedish common barley (50:50). Also studied were two types of flour-based bread products composed of high fiber barley and common barley in ratios of 50:50 or 80:20, respectively. The common oat and barley porridges produced postprandial glucose and insulin responses similar to the white wheat bread reference, suggesting that the naturally occurring dietary fiber in these whole-meal flours has no impact on the glucose tolerance. In contrast, all high fiber barley products induced significantly lower responses than did the reference product, with the glycemic and insulin indices ranging from 57 to 72 or 42 to 72%, respectively. It is concluded that \"lente\" products of high sensory quality can be prepared from a barley genotype with an elevated content of soluble dietary fiber. The glycemic index of these products compares favorably with that of products made from common cereals, suggesting their use as a potential component of diets for patients with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and for individuals predisposed to metabolic disease.\n\nHigh Amylose White Rice Reduces Post-Prandial Glycemic Response but Not Appetite in Humans\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZenel, Alison M.; Stewart, Maria L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe present study compared the effects of three rice cultivars on postprandial glycemic control and appetite. A single-blind, randomized, crossover clinical trial was performed with 18 healthy subjects, nine males and nine females. Three treatments were administered at three separate study visits: commercially available conventional white rice (short grain), specialty high amylose white rice 1 (Dixiebelle), and specialty high amylose white rice 2 (Rondo). Postprandial capillary blood glucose, venous blood glucose and insulin measurements, and appetite visual analog scale (VAS) surveys were done over the course of two hours. The capillary blood glucose concentrations were significantly lower for Rondo compared to short grain rice at 30 min, and for Dixiebelle and Rondo compared to short grain rice at 45, 60, and 120 min. Capillary blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) was significantly lower for Dixiebelle and Rondo compared to short grain rice. Subjects were significantly more hungry at 30 min after Dixiebelle intake than Rondo intake, but there were no other significant effects in appetite ratings. The present study determined that intake of high amylose rice with resistant starch (RS) can attenuate postprandial blood glucose and insulin response in comparison to short grain rice.

Our objective was to create a comprehensive, standardised database of postprandial studies to provide insights into the physiological factors that influence postprandial lipid and glucose responses. Data were collated from subjects (n = 467) taking part in single and sequential meal postprandial studies conducted by researchers at the University of Reading, to form the DISRUPT (DIetary Studies: Reading Unilever Postprandial Trials) database. Subject attributes including age, gender, genotype, menopausal status, body mass index, blood pressure and a fasting biochemical profile, together with postprandial measurements of triacylglycerol (TA"
