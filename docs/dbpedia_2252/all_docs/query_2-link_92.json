Each move required little equipment and the smallest of movements, making it a workout practically anyone can do.\n\n#correctiveexercise Great job ladies in our second class of the weekend we worked specifically on learning & understanding the bodies movements per body, bodytype & lifestyle! It’s a belief system that keeps you ladies all empowered to be your best! Every class I pride myself on making sure everyones form, posture & resistance is done properly!

So proud of you all! #fitnessmodel #fitnesswomen #fitness #fitnessgirl #fitspo #form #posture #resistance #empoweredwomen #goals #objectives #womenempowerment\n\nA post shared by Justin Gelband (@jgjustingelband) on Nov 17, 2018 at 2:53pm PSTNov 17, 2018 at 2:53pm PST\n\nGelband believes a workout should be tailored to the person who is doing it\n\nToday, group fitness classes tend to focus on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and assume all participants can complete the same routine. But Gelband believes differently.\n\nInstead of launching clients into a one-size-fits-all routine, Gelband analyzes each person and creates workouts accordingly. That means a Victoria's Secret model would perform exercises that prepare her to walk in seven-inch stilettos, while I, a desk-ridden worker in the throes of corporate America, would focus on hip-opening exercises.\n\nRead more: The trainer who gets Victoria's Secret models into shape reveals 3 mistakes you're making with your ab exercises\n\nGelband created this special training method after he got into a car crash in 2004 and herniated four discs in his back, making even walking difficult. Since then, he's gotten back on his feet and opened studios to share his fitness method with people of all lifestyles.\n\nThere is one central goal to every person's tailored routine, including mine, though.\n\n\"My goal is to open people's hips and lower back and everything, because the core isn't just the stomach, it's your hips, back, and butt area,\" he told INSIDER. \"If your core is working well, you're going to be good.\"\n\nWe started with a five-minute warm-up that focused on hip opening moves\n\nFirst I completed a warm-up, where Gelband took note of my movements, something he does for all of his clients. He noticed my foot would turn out whenever I took a forward step, signaling tight hips.\n\nGelband then suggested a five to 10-minute warm-up to prepare the muscles for the toning, lengthening, and resistance exercises I would complete later in the program.\n\nEach exercise focused on small movements and resistance\n\nAfter the warm-up, I performed a series of slow, controlled movements using hand weights and resistance bands, which are essential to Gelband's training method.\n\n\"Unless you're training to play a sport, full range of motion isn't important for your day-to-day, like if you sit at a desk all day,\" Gelband told INSIDER.\n\nRather than doing the burpees, deep squats, or push-ups I often find myself struggling through in high-intensity classes, I was coached through tiny toe taps while I held a squat, or rotational movements that opened my hips and made my leg muscles burn.\n\nThroughout the workout, Gelband stressed the importance of never locking out your elbows or knees, since doing so lessens the resistance and stops the muscles from getting a full burn.\n\nGelband then showed me an exercise that prepares Victoria's Secret models to walk in mile-high heels\n\nI also got to try an exercise that's aimed at people who wear heels on a regular basis — aka Victoria's Secret models.\n\n\"They're torquing their bodies in strange ways, so a lot of what I do with the models is prepare their bodies for those torquing motions,\" Gelbrand said.\n\nRead more: 5 things models do before they walk in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show\n\nFor the high heel-prep exercise, I stood with one leg on a slanted wooden structure and another staggered behind me on an elevated box. Then, I did tiny toe taps backward and to the side with my back leg, using my butt muscles to guide the motion. Beware: even though the exercise looks easy, it burns — a lot.\n\nThroughout the routine, I could feel tiny muscle groups in my thighs, abs, and glutes, core working hard. Although I didn't sweat nearly as much as I would in a cardio or HIIT class, I felt challenged the entire time and sore the following day.\n\nWe finished the session with foam rolling to release any muscle tension\n\nFollowing the workout, Gelband demonstrated how to properly use a foam roller for myofascial release, a technique that massages stiff body tissue to release pain, according to the Mayo Clinic. \"Most people use big, sweeping motions when foam rolling, but that's all wrong,\" he told INSIDER.\n\nInstead, Gelband said foam rolling should be done in, you guessed it, small and slow movements. We focused on rolling the areas I just worked out: my quads, butt, and hamstrings. While each motion looked like nothing, I could feel the tension releasing from my body and vowed silently to make the technique part of my regular workout routine.\n\nAfter working out with Gelband, my body felt looser and more aligned, two things that anyone, not just Victoria's Secret models, could use more of.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more."
