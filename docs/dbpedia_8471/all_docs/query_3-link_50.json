        "text": "January 9, 2023\n\ncan’t lie this was a nice read!!! i can’t believe my first book of 2023 is a chinese one literally who would’ve thought not me!!! i actually really liked it because im a sucker for tragic nostalgic stories done right and they’re all centered around all sorts of different people with different pasts & different dreams!!! i also love learning about history & culture through actually interesting fiction so kudos 白先生 congratulations you got me to actually finish a chinese novel. do you understand the impossibility of the feat you have accomplished. it is truly very, very impressive\n\nthis book unfortunately counts toward 20% of my public exam grade so im just gonna talk about every story briefly to make sure i have a good grasp of the content okay here we go:\n\n永遠的尹雪艷：it’s giving gaslight gatekeep girlboss!! honestly it’s somehow even more impressive that she’s not entirely cold & unfeeling towards everyone and she’s instead actually really hospitable & friendly which just adds to the overall creepiness since her actions speak louder when they actually matter, like how she only stops working for one night when 王貴生 gets executed. there are hints that she cares on a deeper level, like how she attends 徐壯圖’s funeral knowing she’d be judged for it, but then again maybe she just wants attention lmao you can never tell. (i also thought it was such a power move she was standing in the middle of the chaos like regina fkn george she made his wife FAINT LMAOOO) nevertheless, there is definitely a strong sense of tragedy in her life: she has the fame & money but she ruins every man’s life she touches (輕者家敗，重者人亡) and in the end she’s alone like she’s always been. though it’s less obvious, there is also the theme of not being able to let go of the past in her story: she hangs onto that fame from shanghai & tries to recreate it w/ her 公館 in 臺北, and even 吳經理 was a 常客 there. one different thing about her vs the other characters in this book is that she doesn’t seem to age which is inch resting 😩🤔 the ghost symbolism is also such a banger\n\n一把青：this might honestly be my favourite one!!! 朱青 reminds me of wanda maximoff & she is a right where you left me by taylor swift girlie through & through 💔💔 i also looove war love stories and this one was so grounded bc it’s not about the men who fight themselves, it’s instead about their wives & widows. i really really feel for 朱青 because she was just a kid when she refused her family to get married to 郭軫. the theme of past vs present is super obvious in this one especially w/ the chapter divided into 2 sections. i also find it so bittersweet that out of everything she chooses to surround herself w/ the same people & the same risks of losing them, because she finds familiarity & comfort in that environment, even though it ends up numbing her. it’s clear that she’s pretending all these young men around her is 郭軫 & at first i thought she was trying to honour his memory or something but after i actually read the story i realise that it’s something more selfish than that and you know what good for her!!! she fkn deserves it!!!! my tutor also made the point that without this repetitive malicious cycle she wouldn’t be able to continue to survive & i agree! pursuing this past, staying in the same type of circles, gives her something to live for, a point to her life. it’s almost like a curse of some sort. a lot of these characters seem cursed, tbh. but the point of this book is that that’s just life. life is the curse. could not agree more\n\n歲除：eh didn’t hate it one of the dialogue heavy ones but ig the point is that these characters no longer have the glory of their past & all they can do now is recount these stories to relive that thrill. also was fun to watch 賴鳴升’s spiral as the night went on however it simply didn’t have as much spice as 遊園驚夢’s 錢夫人’s idk. i feel bad for the host couple sdlkfj u can really see how being unwilling to let go of the past really makes these characters worse as people & a hassle to themselves & others too 💔\n\n金大班的最後一夜：OH THATS MOTHERRRR the tragedy of being a woman is so evident in this one!! she does what needs to be done & understands the tragedy & inevitability of her fate, especially ever since the whole 月如 plus baby incident happened. before that though she made some decisions she sort of regrets now, but now she understands that there’s no escaping ageing, that she’s lucky to have a man to marry at all. but i admire her for her wisdom: though she knows all these truths, learned them the hard way, she doesn’t make it her girls’ problems & is kind enough to let 朱鳳 go with her blessing in the form of a ring worth 500 usd. she somehow keeps her humanity, which honestly can’t really be said for a lot of the other characters, who mainly just stay in the past & don’t pay much attention to what’s really happening before their eyes in the present. 金大班 has the courage to break the cycle or at least try to help 朱鳳 do it. that’s why she’s mother!!! she’s gone through so much trauma esp concerning the forced abortion but is still kind deep down & understands the pov of young women because she thought the same way once. the natasha romanoffism is strong with this one!\n\n那片血一般紅的杜鵑花：ooof this one was dark. i remember the imagery of the corpse at the beginning rlly stayed with me cause it was a very striking description. unfortunately i personally do not feel much sympathy for 王雄 because he’s a creepy pos & i won’t say he deserved to die per se but it was definitely inevitable. the theme of past vs present is also evident & esp my previous point about how ppl in the present will try to find other ppl in the present to pretend it’s ppl in the past they used to know/love, and here it’s 王雄 using 麗兒 to replace 小妹仔. again could not feel for the protagonist, but this story was a page turner and the narrative flowed easier to read i feel like. but 王雄 seriously needs to grow a spine like why does an s1 have that much power over u? she killed ur fish so u kill urself??? be fucking for real!!!\n\n思舊賦：i’m gonna be honest i don’t remember a lot from this one LMAOOO im not intending to write about it. the whole story happens in the dialogue & there’s a crazy son at the end??? 白先勇 i am not your strongest soldier 💔\n\n梁父吟：holy shit is that a 登樓 reference 😱😱😱 this one was sort of… funny to me? 雷委員 just being like yes my teacher was the best person who ever lived he was literally a god maybe you should get some rest! and 樸公 is like nah man let me tell you all about our glory days during the revolution and then he falls asleep playing chess 😭 they’re literally the “ok grandpa let’s get you to bed” meme LKSDFSL this one was bittersweet tho too bad i can’t really relate to characters who are too old. i think the theme of characters being like oh in the future when we get the mainland back xxx and here it’s take his belongings & his soul back there is really sad esp because we know how it turns out lmao— [GUNSHOTS] there is definitely a feeling of 壯志未酬 and with all these powerful important figures getting old a lot of things seem hopeless 💔 pretty drab\n\n孤戀花：bro this one might be the darkest one imo??? it’s so /sad/ 😭😭😭 for 尹雪艷 & 金大班 those two 交際花s at least give the impression that they’re content with what they do, and they’re pretty good at it too, earning a name for themselves. but the women in this story definitely feel like they were forced into this life with no choice & no shot at a better life. the theme of found family/motherhood here is also so sad… 阿六 treats the two different girls as her daughters since they were both motherless & she puts her blood swear & tears into it, just for her to lose both of them to the tragedy of their line of work & abusive men who are pieces of shit. it was actually so chilling to read about their abuse written in such a vivid way and it illustrates the 惡性循環 even clearer than with 朱青. i don’t really have much to say about this it left a really deep impression on me & i feel so sorry for all the girls in the story, the young ones getting abused & 阿六 just having to live with it. them knowing they have no way out of it. it’s so goddamn depressing\n\n花橋榮記：the volume of the past vs present theme in this bus is aSTRONOMICAL!!! not only is it shown through the narrator 老闆娘 wanting to revive the 花橋榮記 of the past that her grandfather ran, it’s also shown through 盧先生 hanging onto his impossible hope of marrying 羅姑娘. there’s even more, with 老闆娘 losing her husband & her beauty from her youth. i do feel sympathy for 盧先生 but only to a certain extent cause according to all 老闆娘’s descriptions he really is a good & honest man! but his spiral at the end after losing his money & chances at marrying his fiancée from guilin was very jarring and after he hit those students remorselessly i don’t know what to feel about him 💔 shows how quickly one can become disillusioned from their idealisation of the future but i do feel sorry for 老闆娘 tho i hope her business improves 😭 there’s a really big sense of tragedy at the fact that she’s away from home & can’t find anyone who understands her & loses the one person who did\n\n秋思：this one was kinda bland? 😭 華夫人 you will never be 錢夫人!!!! ok i feel like 錢夫人 is escalating on my character ranking she’s just a more complex character idk!!! this one is just her obsessing over her looks and white hair (I HAVE WHITE HAIRS TOO AND SO MUCH MORE THAN THE 1-2 THAT SHE HAS SHE NEEDS TO CALM DOWN FR) (like dont worry!!! i can promise you that you are NOT ageing faster than a hong kong high school student taking dses) there’s more stuff with flower symbolism & military husbands who used to be glorious but are now d word i kinda get why 白先勇 put this before 遊園驚夢 cause 遊園驚夢 deserves that spotlight that buildup. i do have a compliment for this story and it’s that it’s the shortest one in the book\n\n滿天裏亮晶晶的星星：gonna be honest here also don’t remember this one… i mean the vibes are all there but it was just so hard to read 😭😭 all i know is that there are gay ppl (🔥🔥🔥) and they act in films but their leader guy fell off after the silent era sucks for him :/ and there was a car accident & an indecency case. what\n\n遊園驚夢：THE ICON THE MOMENT THE LEGEND!!! MAN i loved the way this one was written even though i had to look up summaries AND read a translation to actually figure out the content 😭 but the drunk spiral is definitely one of the highlights of the entire book at least for me. the way her thoughts & words slur together & repeat incessantly? the way the sentences become shorter & shorter still?? the way her entire life flashes before her eyes on this particular night and we feel her fear & her doubt so vividly??? there’s also such a rich contrast between her & the other ladies who are invited. hell i’d be salty about my past glory too. the affair with the general’s attending staff officer was also such a nice touch—reminded me of high infidelity & satisfied!! it’s really sad how at a young age 錢夫人 is forced to already understand her position & privilege but at the same time the disadvantages?? her marrying a 60+ yo man as a 20yo caused a lot of problems but she understood she could only be loved this way, sort of like a trophy daughter… 💔 she understood her glory and everything. but in the present all of it has fallen away and we get a front row seat to her mental spiral as a result of her inebriation and it is GLORIOUS. sucks for her but at least we get some really good literature from it 😩 it’s just so inexplicably sad to see her lose the status she sacrificed so much for: everybody else has their own cars, she came in a taxi; she really did love 鄭彥青 but he ended up being taken by her own sister; she used to be famous for her singing voice but she’s too unnerved to sing tonight. like this contrast is so rich!!! i’d be so pissed!! she’s just like lizzie habsburg but if she’d never had makar and ended up losing all her past glory\n\n冬夜：another bittersweet dialogue heavy one about past revolution stuff 🤠 i feel like this one was very grounded & human with all their friends now ageing& dying and i especially felt really sorry for 余教授 who very nearly made it to harvard to teach and lost his loving wife. he also makes for a very feeble impression & u truly just can’t help but feel so bad for his luck: in the past he literally helped lead the revolution & now he’s begging his friend for a chance to go teach at america. i really understand their desire to relive those thrills through stories more than 歲除 because at least they tried!!!! 賴鳴升 is all talk!! at least these two nice professors acknowledge that they’ve pathetically failed!!!! 😭😭 honestly makes me realise that i should cherish conversations about the past & culture & important experiences more cause there’s a lot to think about in thereee. leaves u feeling very sad for the two professors cause they’re stuck doing something they don’t want to in their late years. it’s very very ironic\n\n國葬：last one WHEW i’m literally typing this out in tutorial rn DSLKFSKL this one had a handful of characters but we move ?? 秦義方 is a little funny for crying at the general’s picture like that but you do you lol. i did feel sad at the part with his son and how he wanted to comfort him but he didn’t even need the comfort cause he cut himself off from that family. the most most impressive part is the contrast between the two 「敬禮！」s!! SOOOO ZHONG GUUN SO BREATHTAKING. i was literally shook 😭😭 what a way to end the whole novel. perfect no notes!\n\nenjoyed this novel, a great way for me to get to know history, culture, different stories from different types of people. (honestly tho their lives are so much more interesting than mine i wish my story was as worth telling nobody wants to read about someone wasting their life away studying for things they’re uninterested in 😭😭😭) definitely widened my worldview, opened my eyes further to all sorts of pain & longing that exists in different souls. i recommend!!! and might even reread one of these short stories every once in a while!!!!\n\nWOOOO WE’RE DONE i hope you all enjoyed my nonsensical emoji-riddled rambling even though no one is going to read this except for myself. future aster good luck i’m going to print this out and highlight some shit and just. pray. u can do this az\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 25, 2024\n\n524-Taipei People-Pai Hsien yung- Novel-1971\n\nBarack\n\n2024/06/23\n\n\"Taipei People\", first published in 1971, is a highly complex collection of short stories, consisting of fourteen first-rate short stories. When connected together, the effect is greatly increased. Not only does the scope of the novel become wider, allowing us to see \"all kinds of people\" in society, but more importantly, due to the repeated theme and mutual accompaniment, we can further understand the meaning of the work in-depth, and get a glimpse of the author's outlook on life and the universe hidden in the work.\n\nBai Xianyong was born in Nanning, Guangxi in 1937. His father was the senior general Bai Chongxi, and his mother Ma Peizhang was the daughter of Ma Jianqing (Ma Weiqi), the magistrate of Xing'an County at the time and a scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. He is a Chinese-American writer, critic, dramatist, Kunqu opera producer, professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Bowen Chair Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He studied at the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, the Department of Foreign Literature of National Taiwan University, and the University of Iowa in the United States.\n\nIn 1968, he wrote the short story \"The Last Night of Madame Jin\". In 2004, he participated in the production of the Kunqu opera youth version of \"The Peony Pavilion\", which premiered in Taipei and caused a sensation. Since then, it has been performed many times across the Taiwan Straits and four places and has toured more than 200 times in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom, Greece, and other places.\n\nPai Hsien-yung has publicly stated that he is a homosexual in Hong Kong but rarely mentions his sexual orientation in public in Taiwan, China. Pai Hsien-yung once said that he believed his father knew about his homosexuality, but he never really talked to him about it.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPeony Fate\n\nYin Xueyan forever\n\nA handful of green\n\nNew Year's Eve\n\nThe Last Night of Jin Daban\n\nThe blood-red azalea\n\nNostalgia\n\nLiangfuyin\n\nLonely Love Flower\n\nHuaqiao Rongji\n\nAutumn Thoughts\n\nThe sky is full of shining stars\n\nDream in the Garden\n\nWinter Night\n\nState funeral\n\nStarting from June 17, 2024, I decided to make an attempt, which was to write a novel. There are several motivations for this attempt. First of all, I think that in life, we often encounter some interesting people and things. If we don't record them, it would be a pity. Bai Xianyong mentioned in \"Peony Marriage\" that he became connected with Guangxi Normal University Press because he adapted the play \"Peony Pavilion\" at that time. Even if the author of an excellent work passes away one day, the work can be passed down. This is the greatest charm of art. Technology also has a similar function of freezing time; but when we enjoy the convenience of technology, we often don't know who invented these technologies, but when we enjoy works of art, we will pay special attention to who the creator is. The second motivation for writing novels is that real life is often unsatisfactory, but in novels, there can be so-called \"cool articles\" that transcend the limitations of reality. The third motivation is probably because I have read a few more books and often feel that it is difficult to let go of certain historical figures and events.\n\n\"Forever Yin Xueyan\" tells the story of a dancer who was very popular in Shanghai before liberation. Regardless of gender, some people are born with a stronger ability to attract the opposite sex. The Analects of Confucius says, \"Guanju is joyful but not lewd, sad but not hurt.\" It is not easy to write about the love between men and women in a way that is both realistic and not full of lust. When the author wrote these short stories in the 1960s, he was studying at the University of Iowa. Although he was in a cornfield, the stories he wrote made people feel the prosperous atmosphere. After 60 years, it still makes people feel immersive. Storytelling does not necessarily have to tell something grand and magnificent, but what is more important is how to tell a good story.\n\n\"A Touch of Green\" tells the contrast between a girl who lost her husband at the age of 20 and her lover at the age of 30. A person's appearance is largely determined by his or her experiences. A shy girl may one day become a woman with unruly words and deeds; a shy boy may also become a greasy uncle. Is this the only way to deal with the suffering brought by the years? We say that the feeling of youth and girlhood is really so difficult to maintain. We maintain our skin to resist physical aging. Similarly, our hearts also need to be vigilant and maintained.\n\n\"New Year's Eve\" tells the story of a frustrated soldier. People say, \"Heroes die, beauties age\", which are all sentimental things. The more a person wants to tell others about his past achievements, the more he proves that he has nothing to say about his current state. When you are young, you are full of vigor and vitality, and you are physically and mentally satisfied, so you are naturally proud. However, as time goes by and you get older, not only does your appearance gradually age, but your heart also becomes fond of reminiscing about the past glory because of the gap in your decline. Regardless of whether the audience is interested or not, and regardless of the audience's feelings, just tell your own great achievements. We should try to avoid becoming such people. If the audience is just trying to cater to me to save my face, it is better not to tell.\n\n\"The Last Night of Lady Jin\" tells the story of a woman who has been in the dance hall for twenty years and finally married a rich old man to retire. Those veterans who are at ease in the romantic places, who is not a young boy or girl who once loved spring? The lucky ones enter into married life early, and although they may not have the opportunity to see a bigger forest, they may find stability in the ordinary. Some people, due to subjective or objective misfortunes, have never been able to meet their own good fate and have not been able to achieve the right result. The latter may get more satisfaction in carnal desires, seemingly better than the former, but will they really get peace of mind? Sometimes I think that these sensory pleasures may be like seawater, the more you drink, the thirstier you are, and the more thirsty you are, the more you drink. However, if you have not experienced the world of mortals, how can you understand the taste of it?\n\nThe story of the Blood-Red Azalea is about a retired soldier who drifts in a foreign land. He first forms a father-daughter relationship with his employer's daughter but is eventually rejected. At a relatively young age, I lost confidence in human emotions to some extent. Because I didn't know how to establish an intimate relationship with others, I even avoided intimate relationships. But later I realized that intimate relationships are an important part of achieving happiness in life. This kind of intimate relationship is not limited to love, but also family and friendship. At the same time, we must also acknowledge the uncertainty of feelings. Today you are in love, but tomorrow you may never see each other again; today's friends may become strangers tomorrow. The previous attitude of avoiding intimate relationships was certainly wrong, but it is also not advisable to completely rely on the emotions of others, especially a specific person, for your happiness in life. After thinking about it, I think the best way is probably to treat others with sincerity. If others can also treat you with sincerity, then enjoy the time together; if others cannot treat you with sincerity, then let them be.\n\n\"A Dream in the Garden\" tells the story of a group of rich ladies gathering to watch a play. The general's wife, who was once glorious, has now lost her glory and support. She used to be the concubine of a minor official, but now she has survived. Not only has her husband been promoted, but she has also been promoted to a noble lady. In such social occasions, showing off and ridicule are mixed together, and the scene is like a Shura field. I have not experienced such a gathering, but what is the difference between the so-called social skills and human warmth of these so-called upper-class societies and the circles of the market?"
