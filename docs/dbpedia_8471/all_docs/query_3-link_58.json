        "text": "Cultural milieu\n\nTaiwan’s culture may be described as traditional and conservative, like most other Asian cultures but to a greater degree. It is mainly Chinese in origin and is patriarchal and patrilineal, with the family at the centre of cultural activities. The society is hierarchical and class-oriented, though it is egalitarian in the sense that one has the opportunity to advance socially through education. In theory, at the top of the traditional social ladder were the scholars, followed by peasants, workers, merchants, and soldiers. Merchants often bought into the scholarly class. Soldiers rose in class status during times of invasion or war.\n\nChinese (Wade-Giles romanization):\n\nT’ai-wan or\n\n(Pinyin):\n\nTaiwan\n\nPortuguese:\n\nFormosa\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPremier: Cho Jung-tai\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 23,356,000\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\n1 USD equals 32.622 Taiwan new dollar\n\nSeat Of Government:\n\nTaipei\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: Lai Ching-te\n\nTaiwan’s culture, however, has also been influenced by traditional Japanese culture, which was more clan-oriented and feudal and gave high status to the military (traditionally, the samurai class). It has also been influenced by the culture of aboriginal peoples, which is tribe-oriented. Because of the less-settled environment in Taiwan, the Chinese who migrated there placed more importance on security and on business and less on education. Also different from the mainland was the lesser degree of importance given to such factors as the control of water and, with it, the need for a strong central government.\n\nThe people of Taiwan highly regard their culture and like to advertise it. The government also considers support for cultural activities to be one of its important roles. After 1945 that took the form of eradicating Japanese cultural elements and promoting Chinese ones instead. Notable since the 1990s has been its support for the cultural activities of various ethnic groups. Taiwan is unusual in that its constitution guarantees expenditures for such support.\n\nFamily structure\n\nA patriarchal and patrilineal extended family was the traditional pattern for the Chinese population on Taiwan. The aboriginal system was tribal. Both have been influenced by Taiwan’s modernization process, in which the family has been reduced in size and has become more urban and less cohesive. The Hakkas have maintained a more-traditional family structure, having been influenced less by the Japanese. Mainland Chinese have been more affixed to the traditional family, but they have also been more affected by modernization.\n\nBy 1980 more than half the families in Taiwan were nuclear and only one-fourth of them extended. Family size continued to shrink as the proportion of the population that was urban grew and became more transient—factors that further weakened the traditional family structure. Also of note were the emergence of a generation gap and a large and increasing number of women entering the workforce, which helped to undermine the family-centred social system.\n\nAlthough there have been profound changes in the traditional family structure in Taiwan, Taiwan’s society is still more family-oriented than most. Filial piety is still practiced. The family still plays a role in marriages and in many social events, and it remains the focus of its members’ loyalty and identification. In addition, businesses continue to be largely family-owned and family-run.\n\nDaily life and social customs\n\nDaily life in Taiwan is to a considerable extent oriented toward one’s family, job, and education. The degree of each depends on a person’s age, status in the society, and individual circumstances. Women and children are closer to the family, although with a larger number of working women that has become less the case. Children spend much of their time studying, much more than children in the West. Competition to get into the best universities begins early.\n\nStability within the household is of great importance. Ritual and role-playing are stronger than in most other cultures. Respect for elders is considered vital, as is loyalty toward the family.\n\nEating is a central part of the culture, and people in Taiwan are proud of their cuisine. At home, meals bring the family together and last longer than in many other societies. Citizens also like to dine out and spend more of their time and money at restaurants than in most cultures. Taiwan’s cuisine is considered to be one of the best in the world. Its variety is also notable, as dishes from all parts of China can be found on the island.\n\nTaiwan’s bubble tea—a beverage combining tea, milk, and “bubbles” (chewy gelatinous candies made of tapioca or fruit jelly)—has become internationally famous. It originated in T’ai-nan in the mid-1980s but quickly spread to other areas of the country, becoming a popular after-school or after-work treat from tea shops or street vendors. The drink then spread internationally in the 2000s, introduced by Chinese diaspora populations in places such as New York, London, and Berlin, and even appeared on the menus of fast-food restaurant chains such as Dunkin’ and McDonald’s.\n\nAs Taiwan modernized, and especially as it became democratized, more people began to take an interest in politics. Many have participated in various ways, including joining campaigns, voting, and protesting. Large numbers of people have also begun spending more time at events in their companies, schools, and social clubs and at national events.\n\nNational holidays are widely observed. The Chinese (lunar) New Year is the most important. Citizens return home if they can, spend time with family members, eat, and talk. Traditionally, they are expected to pay their debts and to renew their lives. The Dragon Boat Festival (in the spring), the Mid-Autumn Festival, and National Day on October 10 are other important holidays.\n\nThe arts\n\nThe arts or, more broadly, the culture of Taiwan has been influenced by aboriginal peoples, Chinese culture brought by immigrants, the brief period of Western colonial rule, Chinese governance, Japanese rule, and Westernization since World War II. The post-1945 government made special efforts to promote Chinese culture (including provisions for it in the constitution). Special efforts were made to eradicate the Japanese cultural influence. Chiang Kai-shek favoured calligraphy, classical painting, traditional Chinese opera, and the folk arts. Taiwanese art forms included puppet shows, sculpture, and dance.\n\nThe government operates a variety of museums and other cultural and arts centres that advance Chinese culture. The National Palace Museum on the outskirts of Taipei (opened 1965) is considered to have one of the world’s best collections of Chinese antiquities. It contains many valuable historical artifacts, works of art, and books that were taken to Taiwan from China in 1949. The Juming Museum in the Chin-shan (Jinshan) district of New Taipei City provides exhibits of contemporary art. The National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts in T’ai-chung (Taizhong) houses works from the Ming and Qing (Ch’ing) dynasties. The National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in central Taipei contains items from more-recent Chinese history. It forms part of a complex that includes an opera house and a concert hall.\n\nDemocratization has been accompanied by more eclecticism in the arts and has led to the exploration of new themes, such as pragmatism, realism, and nativism. Japanese cultural elements have had a revival, especially the martial arts, and Japanese movies have become popular in Taiwan. Western culture has grown in influence, especially in movies, music, literature, and fashions. After 1987, when citizens were allowed to visit China, that access spurred a revival of interest in mainland Chinese literature and arts."
