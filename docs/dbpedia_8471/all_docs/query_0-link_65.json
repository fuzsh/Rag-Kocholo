        "text": "It’s been fun while it’s lasted, but all good things must come to an end, and with today being the last day of August, it’s time to bring the curtain down on our epic Women in Translation Month (#WITMonth) global travels. The tenth and final leg of our journey sees us bidding farewell to a Taiwanese garden and heading off to small-town Quebec, where we’ll meet a woman reminiscing about her youth, and those she once knew. We get to meet many of those who were important in her life, but in truth, this is a book very focused on the personal, one where the writer bares her soul and, dare I say it, opens her heart to her readers…\n\n*****\n\nAlexie Morin’s Open Your Heart (translated by Aimee Wall, review copy courtesy of Véhicule Press) begins with the narrator (who is barely, if at all, distinguishable from the writer) at a book launch for an author whose work she’s been editing. While it’s a routine part of her job, this night is special as she’s not in Montreal, but in the region of her birth and upbringing. She’s a bundle of nerves as she prepares to meet people she hasn’t seen in years, ready to answer any questions they may have about how life has treated her.\n\nIt’s a common enough feeling for anyone going home after a long absence, yet there’s more to the narrator’s nerves than this, and over the next three-hundred pages we’ll find out just what. In a story divided into 257 short notes, zipping back and forth in time, Morin tells the tale of a girl, and then a woman, who struggles to cope with the world, finding herself adrift in a game where the rules are unclear to her. It’ll take years for her to work out why everything is such a struggle, but fortunately she’ll find friends along the way to help, even if one of them doesn’t make it all the way.\n\nThe back-cover blurb sells the story as one of a friendship between two girls growing up in Quebec in the 1990s, one with strabismus (and possible mental health issues), the other with a serious heart condition. That’s true in a way, and the friendship between Alexie and her neighbour, Fannie, is a major part of the book – but only a part. For the most part, Open Your Heart is very much about the writer, who, in the best traditions of autofiction, adopts a confessional tone, that of a woman attempting to work through her life in words.\n\nAlexie isn’t exactly a social butterfly, and one of the challenges she faces is struggling to understand others:\n\nI’m afraid of other people. Other people are strange to me. I don’t know how to make friends. I never take the first step. I don’t remember a time when I was capable of taking the first step. Other people have always had to come to me.\n\np.18 (Esplanade Books, 2021)\n\nHer issues with making, and keeping friends, are raised in many places. Throughout her schooling, most kids keep clear of her because of her moods and her reputation, and while she’s not ostracised as such, she’s not really included much, either.\n\nThe more we learn about Alexie, the clearer it becomes that she finds it difficult to understand, and deal with, her emotions. One day, after panicking while coming back down from a tree she’d climbed, she has a revelation:\n\nAnd I understood that my emotional response to events was distinct from the events themselves. When you need to act, you can block this response, you can toss it aside and do what needs to be done. If it’s not possible to block it and toss it aside, you can still act. Rage and terror can’t blind me to things, to the laws of physics or to what I know of the world. I can act even if I’m in crisis, or terrified. (p.232)\n\nFew readers will be surprised that we’re heading towards an explanation, a diagnosis, but it’s a long time coming. In the meantime, the narrator must piece together a set of rules for getting along, ones most children seemed to have been born with.\n\nCobbling together a manual for life from various experiences will only get you so far, though, and there are to be many situations where it’s simply not enough. As Alexie gets older, she’s put under more pressure, and the cracks start to show. Things others would take in their stride, such as a teacher putting pressure on her to help with a project outside school time, or a summer job in a factory, push her to breaking point. The subsequent meltdowns are brutal, and anyone who has ever suffered from sensory overload in an environment where everyone else seems happy will sympathise.\n\nOpen Your Heart is a story, but also a process of discovery, with the writer unburdening herself, deciding to put her memories down on paper to help understand herself. It’s a process she finds surprisingly tricky when she begins:\n\nI started writing this book believing that my memories would still be waiting for me like that, obedient as the clothes hanging in my closet, each item of which I could pull out and tell the story of, where it came from, what it’s made of and what it cost… (p.58)\n\nAlas:\n\nExcept, even that isn’t really true anymore. For a long time, I haven’t known where my clothes came from. I have too many. I’m not old, but I live now in the hazy universe of adulthood. (p.59)\n\nShe’s hit by a sudden realisation that her memories are fading and unreliable. Having believed they were safely filed away at the back of her mind, she goes to retrieve them only to find that many are distorted, or gone for ever.\n\nThere’s a lot to like about the book, and Morin is skilful enough to make her personal stories appeal to a wider audience. Of course, autofiction is a dangerous game to play, given the risk of appearing self-indulgent, but if Morin does occasionally threaten to cross that line, at least she’s aware of that fact:\n\nI’m also afraid people would say that just because you have the right to do something doesn’t mean that it’s the right thing to do. Or that just because I have the right doesn’t mean it’s worth writing, that it’s interesting. And that I maybe should have shut up rather than write this whiny, shameless book. This book that distorts reality. (pp.267/8)\n\nWall’s work is also excellent throughout, and I’m sure she had fun here with these puns on ‘right’ and ‘write’, which I suspect were rather different in the original.\n\nAn engaging memoir of sorts (that’s uncomfortably close to the bone at times), Open Your Heart is a book for anyone who enjoys autofiction, or stories of people working out why they don’t fit in. We know how the story ends, of course, as we start in the present day, but Morin’s guided tour through her past is still interesting, showing us the obstacles she’s had to overcome to make it as a writer, or simply as a human who must socialise…"
