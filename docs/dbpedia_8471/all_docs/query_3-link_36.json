        "text": "The Taiwanese national health insurance system\n\nTaiwan is a small country with a population of 23 million located in the eastern part of Asia. It was first called ‘Ilha Formosa’ (Beautiful Island) by the Portuguese in 1544. The economy of Taiwan has developed rapidly in the last 60 years and there has been a rapid transition from an agricultural-based to an industrial-based economy. The life expectancy for Taiwanese people in 2008 was 75.6 years for males and 81.9 years for females1 as compared to 77.4 and 81.6 years for males and females in the UK in 2008, respectively.2 In the capital city, Taipei, life expectancy was 79.7 years for males and 84.4 years for females in 20071 as compared to 77.9 years old for males and 82.4 years old for males and females in London in 2005–2007, respectively3.\n\nThe Taiwanese government adopted a nationwide health insurance system in March 1995, the national health insurance (NHI) system. Before the introduction of the NHI, there were a range of separate insurance schemes covering around 57% of the population.4 These included labour insurance, governmental employee insurance, farmers' health insurance and fishermen's health insurance. However, most of the general practitioners (GPs) practiced independently, and there was a high-level of out-of-pocket payments from patients. The NHI system consolidated all these small insurance schemes into a single national insurance system. The principal goals of NHI were to improve the efficiency of the Taiwanese healthcare system, and to improve social justice by increasing healthcare coverage. The organisational structure of the health system in Taiwan is shown in .\n\nThe revenue for the NHI program comes from several sources: employees, employers and government, both national and local. There are special programs for different degrees of governmental premium subsidies for low income populations and disadvantaged populations. The insured are classified into six main categories and 15 subcategories based on their job and income. The percentage of the premium paid by the insured for each category varies from 0% for low income citizens to 100% for the self employed. The percentage of the revenue coming from government and the insured/employers was 23.2% and 76.8% in 2008, respectively.5 The percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) spent on healthcare was 5.0% in 1994 (the year before the NHI system), and 5.2% in 1995 (the first year of NHI system).6 The percentage of GDP spent on healthcare is currently 6.2% in Taiwan7 in contrast to 8.3% in the UK, 10.7% in Germany or 11.6% in Switzerland.\n\nBoth retrospective (RPS) and prospective payment systems (PPS) are adopted in the Taiwanese NHI. The unit of payment is mainly fee for service, although case payment is used for certain diagnoses, and per diem payment is allowed for chronic psychiatric problems and community services. The Bureau of National Health Insurance started to use the diagnosis-related group system (Tw-DRG) in January 2010. Every service is accompanied by a co-payment, irrespective of the age of the patient. Only the cancer screening programs and annual physical checkups of people older than 65 are exceptions to this, in order to improve their uptake rates. The co-payments vary in different institutions, from £6.37 in hospital medical centers to £1.09 in GP clinics.8 Those patients who cannot afford co-payments receive public assistance.\n\nEvery Taiwanese citizen has a NHI IC card (integrated circuit card, a smart card), which is used to identify the person, store a brief medical history and to bill the national insurer. The patient has to bring his NHI IC card each time he/she utilises medical services. The hospitals will then claim the related charges from the government. The claims process for healthcare providers is very rapid, in contrast to the rather lengthy processes for payment seen in the USA and UK. Hence, there is a clear link between activity and payment.\n\nIn Taiwan, GPs earn their income mainly through patient consultations, drug prescription and minor procedures. Sometimes, GPs provide additional services such as cosmetic laser treatment, aesthetic surgery or detailed health checkups. Self-paid advanced health checkups are relatively prevalent in Taiwan, reflecting the general concerns that people have about their own health. These are areas not covered by the NHI and are paid out-of-pocket by patients.\n\nThe financial structure of the Taiwanese NHI system is shown in .\n\nStrengths of NHI\n\nGood accessibility\n\nThe NHI has a very high approval rate among Taiwanese people. Taiwanese citizens can see any doctor without a referral. They may also go to any level of hospital directly, as they wish. However, larger, more popular hospitals charge a higher co-payment and can be overcrowded. Seeing a GP is much cheaper. Patients often choose to see a family doctor for minor illnesses, preventive care, health checkups, consultations with multiple complaints, because of poly-pharmacy, or simply because they have good relationships with their family doctor.\n\nComprehensive coverage\n\nThe NHI covers almost all services that can be provided by a health system: from dental care to parturition, from Western medicine to traditional Chinese medicine, and from preventive services to elderly home care.8 ‘Cheap and abundant care’ is the best description of Taiwanese NHI.\n\nShort waiting times\n\nAlthough the insurance scheme is run by the government, private providers including doctors and hospitals dominate the healthcare market. There are more private establishments than the public ones. All providers claim and compete for payments from the NHI.\n\nThere is generally no waiting list and patients can normally see any specialist they wish to during the usual working hours. For example, if a patient sprains his/her back while doing house chores one evening, he/she may see an orthopaedic specialist, a pain specialist, a neurologist or a family physician directly the very next morning. The only exception is when the physician whom the patient wants to see is very popular, in which case there may be a waiting list for the appointment. The surgical waiting list for elective procedures is usually short as well.\n\nLow cost\n\nOwing to the single insurer system, Taiwan's NHI has one of the lowest administrative costs in the world, typically under 2% of total healthcare spending. Every year, the Department of Health negotiates with physicians and hospitals to set the global budget, and this helps keep the cost of the NHI down.\n\nThere is also a panel review system of medical records to keep healthcare costs down, whilst maintaining the quality of healthcare. Procedures considered inappropriate by this specialist panel will not be paid.\n\nHigh coverage rate\n\nIt is mandatory for all citizens in Taiwan to join NHI except for prisoners or people who have moved out of Taiwan. The coverage rate is around 99%. Taiwanese citizens living overseas who maintain the residence registration in Taiwan are also covered by NHI and are required to pay the premium. Those who live in other countries often come back to Taiwan for major surgery or annual health checkups. Foreign nationals with legal residence in Taiwan may join NHI through their employers.\n\nNationwide research databank\n\nThe NHI claim and administrative data is kept in the Department of Health. The National Health Research Institutes also keeps a complete database from the date the NHI first started for research purposes. The identities of patients in the database are anonymised. The dataset is open to the public upon application.9 The system also helps public health officials monitor the effects of policy implementations.\n\nComparison with NHS\n\nBoth the British and the Taiwanese health systems are single-payment systems. However, the method of funding is different as one is tax based, and other insurance-premium based. However, all citizens are covered by the health system in both countries. Both systems avoid selection of the young and healthy, as often seen in private health insurance schemes. Such universal coverage programs tend to be cheaper and much simpler to administer than profit generating insurances companies.\n\nWith regard to medical providers, the British system is more ‘socialised’, with the state both providing and paying for health services. Long waits and limited choice have been limitations of the NHS, with ongoing government initiatives to address these problems. In Taiwan, providers are primarily private and free to compete with each other, despite the presence of some public hospitals. The Taiwanese NHI system is closer to the Canadian NHI system. Accessibility is not currently its main concern now, but gatekeeping and quality of care are its most pressing issues. This is particularly the case in the metropolitan area of Taiwan where waiting times are generally short and medical resources have been described as ‘more than enough’ by Dr Sun-Yran Chang, superintendent of Taipei City Hospital, the biggest community hospital in the capital. According to the data provided by NHI, there are on average 76.61 hospital-beds per 10 000 people in Taipei city.10"
