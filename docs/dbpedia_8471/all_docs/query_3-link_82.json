        "text": "Famous people from Taiwan\n\nHere is a list of famous people from Taiwan. Curious if anybody from Taiwan made it our most famous people in the world list? Read the aformentioned article in order to find out.\n\nRainie Yang\n\nTaiwanese pop Artist\n\nRainie Yang, was born on 4 June 1984, of Cantonese descent, is a multiple-award-winning Taiwanese singer, Golden Bell Awards lead actress and TV host.\n\nHsieh Su-wei\n\nTennis Player\n\nHsieh Su-wei is a Taiwanese professional female tennis player. As of 25 February 2013 she was ranked No. 23 in the WTA Tour singles rankings and is the highest ranked Taiwanese women's singles player ever. In 2013 Wimbledon, Hsieh won her first ladies' double championship with Peng Shuai from the People's Republic of China, making her the first citizen of Taiwan to win a Grand Slam title of any kind.\n\nChen Shui-bian\n\nPolitician\n\nChen Shui-bian is a former Taiwanese politician who was president from 2000 to 2008. Chen's election ended more than fifty years of Kuomintang control of the Executive Yuan in Taiwan. A native-born Taiwanese, he is colloquially referred to as A-Bian. A lawyer, Chen entered politics in 1980 during the Kaohsiung Incident as a member of the Tangwai movement and was elected to the Taipei City Council in 1981. He was jailed in 1985 for libel as the editor of the weekly pro-democracy magazine Neo-Formosa, following publication of an article critical of Elmer Feng, a college philosophy professor who was later elected a Kuomintang legislator. After being released, Chen helped found the Democratic Progressive Party in 1986 and was elected a member of the Legislative Yuan in 1989, and Mayor of Taipei in 1994. Chen won the 2000 presidential election on March 18 with 39% of the vote as a result of a split of factions within the Kuomintang, when James Soong ran for the presidency as an independent against the party nominee Lien Chan, becoming the only non-member of the Kuomintang to hold the office of president. Although Chen received high approval ratings during the first few weeks of his term, his popularity sharply dropped due to alleged corruption within his administration and the inability to pass legislation against the opposition KMT, who controlled the Legislative Yuan. In 2004, he won reelection by a narrow margin after surviving a shooting while campaigning the day before the election. Opponents suspected him of staging the incident for political purposes. However, the case was officially closed in 2005 with all evidence pointing to a single deceased suspect, Chen Yi-hsiung.\n\nChien-Ming Wang\n\nPitcher\n\nChien-Ming Wang is a Taiwanese professional baseball pitcher.

He is recognized as a major cultural icon in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. Stylistically, Lo defies classification, though his contribution to Taiwanese campus folk song genre was most significant. His early music in particular shows strong folk roots, and many of his songs tap into native Taiwanese cultural influences. Some songs are reminiscent of 1950s American diner and soda shop rock, and others exhibit a 1970s lounge lizard growl. What captured the hearts of a generation, however, were his lyrics, touching on issues of life, attitudes, social responsibility, and the political problems of both Chinese Mainland and Taiwan with an underhandedly critical strain of dark humor. The lyrical style is not particularly artsy or complex, but rather conversational; the cleverness comes in the meaning, not how the words are put together.\n\nLee Teng-hui\n\nPolitician\n\nLee Teng-hui, sometimes called the \"father of Taiwan's democracy\", is a politician of the Republic of China. He was the President of the Republic of China and Chairman of the Kuomintang from 1988 to 2000. He presided over major advancements in democratic reforms including his own re-election which marked the first direct presidential election for Taiwan. The first native Taiwanese to become ROC president and KMT chairman, Lee promoted the Taiwanese localization movement and led an aggressive foreign policy to gain diplomatic allies. Critics accused him of betraying the party he headed, secret support of Taiwanese independence, and involvement in corruption. After leaving office Lee was expelled from the KMT for his role in founding the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union, which forms part of the Pan-Green Coalition alongside Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party. Lee has been outspoken in support for Taiwanese independence though not necessarily a formal declaration.\n\nWallace Huo\n\nActor\n\nWallace Huo Chien-hwa is a Taiwanese-born Chinese actor and singer. Huo first joined the entertainment business at the age of 17. Setting the goal as a singer, he went through two years of training in vocal and dancing. Just before he was about to record his first album, however, he was mandated to enlist in the army. He became known for his cell phone commercial with Angelica Lee in 2000. After completing his military service, Huo joined etKING and became one of the two leading actors in the new drama Star. Though this series was not immensely popular, it kick-started his acting career. His first real major break was in the drama At the Dolphin Bay, where he portrayed the role of a cold-hearted music director who fell in love with the female lead and eventually found himself slowly changing. After At the Dolphin Bay, he filmed 100% Senorita, Secret Garden I, Great Teacher, Pretty Girl and Westside Story with 5566, all in a year. In 2003, Huo became best known by the audience in Taiwan. The idol drama At the Dolphin Bay brought him new fame and popularity. He filled every major TV channel with the six TV dramas he made within that year. This overnight success brought Huo nothing but apprehension, however. He said, \"Suddenly my life was filled with work. I didn't have time to study the script in detail, and I couldn't tell the difference between different characters. But that didn't make big difference: all the roles wanted me to look cool!\"\n\nAaron Yan\n\nSinger\n\nAaron Yan, born Aaron Wu Keng-Lin in Taiwan, is a Taiwanese Mandopop singer, commercial model and actor.
