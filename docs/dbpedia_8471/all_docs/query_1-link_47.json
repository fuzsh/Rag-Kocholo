        "text": "Ramcharitmanas Sundarkand Path is an extremely popular and powerful prayer glorifying Hanuman Ji – one of Lord Rama’s most trusted, selfless, loyal, and loving devotees. The Sundarkand is originally the fifth chapter in the great Indian Sanskrit epic Ramayana written by Sage Valmiki. Goswami Tulsidas has included it in the Ramcharitmanas as well. The Ramcharitmanas Sundarkand Path describes the valorous acts of Hanuman Ji, during his journey to Lanka. Radha Krishna Temple of Dallas, provides the opportunity for participating in the Sunderkand Path on Thursday Apr 3rd, 5:30PM CST telecast LIVE on Zoom!\n\nRamcharitmanas Sundarkand Path – Hanuman Ji’s Valour\n\nHanuman ji is reminded by Jambavant ji of his astronomical powers. Thus, making a giant dent in the ground, with the name of Lord Ram on his lips and the image of Lord Ram in his heart, Hanuman ji takes a giant leap across the ocean, speeding to Lanka. He encounters many obstacles during his journey which he intelligently overcomes. He discovers Mother Sita imprisoned in Ashok Vatika, delivers Lord Rama’s message to Her and offers to rescue Her. Sita ji refuses as she is waiting for Lord Ram alone to come and save her as well as avenge her insult at the hands of Ravan. But overwhelmed by Hanuman ji’s loyalty, she blesses Hanuman ji with eight siddhis(special powers), nine types of wealth, and eternal devotion at the feet of Lord Ram. Hanuman ji is furious at seeing Jagad Janani (universal mother), Yogamaya personified, his beloved Mother Sita ji, suffering persecution at the hands of Ravan. He boldly admonishes Ravan and though he is tied up and his tail set to fire, he assumes a giant form and he breaks free. Leaping from rooftop to rooftop he sets all of Lanka on fire, and uses it to caution Ravan: if a simple servant of Lord Ram can wreak such havoc, what then to speak of the destruction if Lord Ram were to attack Lanka?\n\nHanuman ji is valiant, brave, intelligent, humble and above all ever fiercely obedient to His beloved Lord Ram. May everyone be blessed with selfless devotion to God through the Sundarkand Path! Lyrics along with meaning are provided for the benefit of the readers in this blog[1].\n\nRamcharitmanas Sundarkand Path – Procedure and Benefits\n\nThe biggest benefit of reciting the Sundarkand path is that it can free the readers and listeners/recipients from the cycle of birth and death according to Lord Shiva’s discourse to Parvati. Negative energies, obstacles, sinful tendencies, impending dangers and illnesses are warded off. One is blessed with material and spiritual happiness for a life of service and devotion to God. Like Hanuman ji one can be blessed with intelligence, courage, optimism, compassion and selfless love or Bhakti for God, provided the Sundarkand Path is recited/listened to with faith and devotion.\n\nTraditionally, Ramcharitmanas Sundarkand Path begins and ends with a prayer to Lord Ram. The Sundarkand Path must be chanted continuously with total mental absorption and faith in the divine pastimes – one must not get up and leave midway. Usually it is done on Tuesdays and Saturdays in the early morning or evening and sweet boiled milk is offered to God.\n\nRamcharitmanas Sundarkand Path – Lyrics and Meaning\n\nEnglish:\n\nPrayer to Lord Ram\n\n\"Shantam Shasvatamaprameyamanaghanam nirvanashantipradam\n\nbrahmashambhuphaneendrasevyamanisham vedantavedyam vibhum,\n\nRamakhayam jagadishvaram suragurum mayamanusyamharim\n\nvandeaham karunakaram raghuvaram bhupalachunamanim.\"\n\nMeaning: I adore the Lord of the universe bearing the name of Rama, the Chief of raghu’s line and the crest-jewel of kings, the mine of compassion, the dispeller of all sins, appearing in human form through His Maya (deluding potency), the greatest of all gods, knowable through Vedanta (the Upanishads),constantly worshiped by Brahma (the Creator), sambhu (Lord Shiva) and sesha (the serpent-god), the bestower of supreme peace in the form of final beatitude, placid, eternal, beyond the ordinary means of cognition, sinless and all-pervading.(1)\n\n\"nanya sprha raghupate hridayesmadiye\n\nsatyam vadami cha bhavnakhilantartma,\n\nbhaktim prayaccha raghupungava nirbharam me,\n\nkamadidosarahitamkuru manasam cha.(2)\"\n\nMeaning: There is no other craving in my heart, O Lord of the raghus: I speak the truth and You are the Spirit indwelling the hearts of all.

(3)\"\n\nMeaning: I bow to the son of the wind-god, the beloved devotee of Sri Rama (the Lord of the raghus), the chief of the monkeys, the repository of all virtues, the foremost among the wise, a fire to consume the forest of the demon race, possessing a body shining as a mountain of gold and a home of immeasurable strength. (3)\n\nChaupai:\n\n\"jamavanta ke bachan suhaye,\n\nsuni hanumanta hridaya ati bahe.\n\ntaba lagi mohi parikhehu tumha bhai,\n\nsahi dukha kanda muula phala khayi. 1.\"\n\nMeaning: Hanuman was much delighted at heart to hear the heartening speech of Jambavant\n\njaba lagi avau sitahi dekhi,\n\nhoihi kaju mohi harasa bisesi.\n\nyaha kahi nai sabanhi kahu mth,\n\nchaleu harasi hiya dhari raghuntha. 2.\n\nMeaning: till I return after seeing Sita.

On hearing these words the son of the wind-god said in reply, “Let me return after accomplishing Sri Rama’s errand and tell my lord the news of Sita.\n\ntaba tava badana paithihau ai, satya kahau mohi jana de mai.\n\nkavanehu jatana dei nahi jana, grasasi na mohi kaheu hanumana.3.\n\nMeaning: Then I will approach you and enter your mouth; I tell you the truth. Mother, only let me go now.” When, however, she would not let him go on any account, Hanuman said, Then why not devour me? She distended her mouth to a distance of eight miles, while the chief of monkeys grew double the size of her mouth.\n\njojana bhari tehi badanu pasara, kapi tanu kinha duguna bistara.\n\nsoraha jojana mukha tehi thayau, turata pavanasuta battisa bhayau.4.\n\nMeaning: She stretched her mouth to a circumference of a hundred and twenty-eight miles, and the son of the wind-god immediately took a form covering two hundred and fifty-six miles.

In this way she would devour birds everyday .

Myriads of champions possessing frightful forms sedulously guarded the city on all sides\n\nkari jatana bhata kotinha bikata tana nagara chahu disi racchahi,\n\nkahu mahisha manusha dhenu khara aja khala nisachara bhacchahi.\n\nehi lagi tulasidasa inha ki katha kachu eka hai kahi,\n\nraghubira sara tiratha sariranhi tyagi gati paihahi sahi.3.\n\nMeaning: Elsewhere the vile demons feasted on buffaloes, human beings, cows, donkeys and goats.

Endowed as I am with a sinful (demoniac) form, I am incapable of doing any Sadhana (striving for God realization); and my heart cherishes no love for the Lord’s lotus-feet. But I am now confident, Hanuman, that Sri Rama will shower his grace on me; for one can never meet a saint without Sri Hari’s grace.\n\njau raghubira anugraha kinha, tau tumha mohi darasu hathi dinha.\n\nsunahu bibhishana prabhu kai riti, karahi sada sevaka para priti.3.\n\nMeaning: It is only because the Hero of Raghu’s race has been kind to me that you have blessed me with your sight unsolicited.
