        "text": "My Taiwanese friend told me that the 24 hour book store that’s open in Taipei (I can’t remember the name) attracts all sorts of celebrities during the night. He even told me it’s a good place to meet famous Taiwanese girls and to ask them out.\n\nAnyhow, I had a chance to meet a slightly famous Shanghainese television actress the other day and I turned it down. It was a KTV event and I just wasn’t in the mood for singing any songs. The idea of meeting some of these local television actresses in Shanghai has never really interested me much. I’m sure they are out there but I have never really met or talked to any of them.\n\nHave any of you ever met any famous celebrities in Taiwan or just in Asia?\n\nMet an actor, no idea who he was but he was very, very nice. Lovely, polite, kind of cute about it too.\n\nMet a really famous host and one of those judges, but then I was on their show so I’m not sure if that counts.\n\nMet and chatted to quite a big band on the indie circuit (they’ve performed at that Eslite), does that count?\n\nEslites usually get a good round of concerts and stuff, I’m quite jealous. Pretty much everybody performs at that one in Taipei. They don’t always hit the Eslite here (it’s not really big enough)\n\nGood fan and friend of some woman from Hong Kong who is quite famous over here.\n\nAlso a famous comic cartoonist/author asked me out and proclaimed his love for me after being here for about a year. He is a he and I am also a he so he and I kind of went our separate ways after that."
