        "text": "You never know who you might see at SEA!\n\nSeattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) is a major hub for air travel, and it's no surprise that many famous people fly through here on their way to and from destinations all over the world. From athletes and entertainers to artists and global leaders, SEA Airport has seen its fair share of celebrities over the years. Let’s take a look at some of the famous faces you might recognize who have flown through SEA Airport.\n\nAthletes\n\nMuhammad Ali\n\nMillions of people travel through SEA but few are as famous as three-time heavyweight boxing champ, activist, and global icon Muhammad Ali. In late April 1972, boxing legend Muhammad Ali was heading to Vancouver, British Columbia, to take on the heardheaded Canadian George Chuvalo for their second meeting. (Ali had bested Chuvalo in 1967 in a 13-round decision.) In a stopover at SEA, Ali gave a press conference about the upcoming fight to sportswriters and assorted media. The audience also included airline and port employees.\n\nAfter finishing his press conference, he turned to the group of onlookers. In the crowd Ali mistook Port employee Lois Mahomes for a flight attendant, asking her, \"Who do you fly for?”\n\n\"For the Port of Seattle,” responded Lois.\n\nInspired, Ali created the following poem: “Ah, you are on the ground, better stick around, where you can be found.\"\n\nThe Champ left soon after and won another lopsided decision against George Chuvalo on May 1, 1972. Ali had promised to knock down Chuvalo, something he had failed to do at their first meeting. Even though he easily beat the Canadian, he was never able to knock him down. In fact, Chuvalo was never knocked down in 93 professional bouts — one reason that Ali later admitted that Chuvalo was the toughest guy he ever fought.\n\nWatch the 1972 Ali vs. Chuvalo fight.\n\nSue Bird and the Seattle Storm\n\nThe Seattle Storm is the most successful Seattle sports franchise in the city’s history, having won four WNBA championships, in 2004‎, ‎2010‎, ‎2018‎, and ‎2020‎. Here are some photo from their triumphant return after winning their second WNBA championship in 2010.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks\n\nNo team is as identified with Seattle as the Seattle Seahawks. Here are some shots of the team after they returned from their heartbreaking loss in Super Bowl XLIX. It was a gray day, but the 12s still came out to SEA to support the SEA – hawks.\n\nJim Whittaker\n\nA local mountaineering legend and the first full-time employee of Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI), Jim Whittaker made the descent to SEA level after being the first American to conquer Mount Everest in 1963.\n\nEntertainers and Artists\n\nDave Grohl and Dave Pickering\n\nDave Grohl, the legendary drummer of Nirvana and founder of the iconic band Foo Fighters, has also rocked into SEA. While shooting the Seattle segment of his 2014 HBO musical documentary series \"Sonic Highways,\" Grohl ran into Mark Pickerel, the drummer of the Screaming Trees, at the Sub Pop Airport Store in a serendipitous meeting. They filmed an impromptu segment about the Seattle sound and grunge, which you can watch at 51 minutes into the episode.\n\nThe two musicians were kindred spirits, both having come up in the Seattle music scene in the early 1990s. They shared stories about their experiences and the impact that Seattle had on their careers. The segment was a fitting tribute to the city's musical legacy, and it gave fans a glimpse into the minds of two of the most influential musicians of their generation.\n\nAlan Stone\n\nIn 2019 Alan Stone performed for his many fans and surprised and delighted passengers at SEA. Watch his performance on the Port of Seattle's YouTube channel.\n\nRena Priest\n\nSeattle is know as being one of the most literate cities in the nation. In 2021, for the reopening of the N Concourse, we invited Washington State Poet Laureate Rena Priest to help us dedicate the new facility. Watch her reading on the Port of Seattle's YouTube channel.\n\nMovie Stars\n\nDid you know that many movies have been filmed at SEA Airport? Here's a partial list:\n\n\"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) — The iconic scene where Tom Hanks' character, Sam Baldwin, sees Meg Ryan's character, Annie Reed, at SEA’s Gate N7 is one of the most memorable moments in the film.\n\n\"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" (1993-1998) — The educational TV show filmed parts of Episode 1 of Season 1, \"Flight,\" at SEA Airport in 1996. Also enjoyable is the parody of the Nirvana song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" at 19 minutes into the episode: \"Smells Like Air Pressure\"\n\n\"The Amazing Race\" (2001 – present) — The reality TV show has featured SEA Airport in several episodes, including the Season 13 finale.\n\n\"Captain Fantastic\" (2016) — Viggo Mortensen's character, Ben Cash, takes his family to SEA Airport to catch a flight to South America.\n\n\"The Paper Tigers\" (2020) — This martial arts comedy features a scene in which the main characters fight in the baggage claim area of SEA Airport.\n\nHere are a couple more stars who were ready for their close-ups around the airport.\n\nElliott Gould\n\nElliott Gould stared in the 2012 film \"All I Want Is Christmas,\" which included scenes filmed in SEA's Gina Marie Lindsey Arrivals Hall. Fun fact about this movie: The film crew brought in palm trees and dressed SEA to make your airport play the part of an airport in Florida. Our airport should get a credit as an actor on IMDB!\n\nJack Benny\n\nIn April 1972 famed comedian Jack Benny was travelling to a gig in Vancouver, British Columbia, and at a stopover at SEA Airport he sat down to get a shoeshine. Curt Yound, who was shining his shoes, confirmed that it was indeed the famously stingy comedian. He said to Benny, “Uh oh! I sure won’t get a tip now!”\n\nBenny laughed and replied, “For that comment, you’ll be getting a bigger tip!”\n\nSee kids, honesty pays!\n\nGlobal Leaders and Icons\n\nAs the gateway to the world, the Port of Seattle and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA Airport) has hosted many international leaders.
