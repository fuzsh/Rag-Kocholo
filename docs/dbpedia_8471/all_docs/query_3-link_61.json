        "text": "“The most beautiful scenery of Taiwan is its people.”\n\nWhile this famous saying is often cited by travelers as a reason to love Taiwan, this 36,193-square-kilometer island also happens to have a staggeringly diverse wealth of stunning scenery and destinations, from cityscapes to natural wonders.\n\n“Taiwan has the highest density of high mountains in the world, leaving us adventurers with endless places to hike, camp, river trace and more,” says Ryan Hevern, co-founder of Taiwan Adventure Outings.\n\nTaiwan’s natural beauty\n\nHevern, after living in Malaysian Borneo as a jungle guide, moved to Taiwan and started an eco-friendly outdoor tour company with co-founder Dustin Craft two years ago.\n\n“We aren’t city people, so we spend our free time in Taiwan’s outdoors,” says Hevern.\n\n“In November 2016, we decided to deal with the weekly grind of living in a city by starting an outdoor adventure group. Each weekend we explored new hikes, new mountains, new rivers and so on.”\n\nThe company currently offers around 20 different outdoor routes with an emphasis on sustainability.\n\n“Even in the cities such as Taipei, adventure is a mere 20 minutes away. Outdoor adventures are endless. We love that about Taiwan,” says Hevern.\n\nCentral Mountain Range\n\nThe 3,886-meter-tall Central Mountain Range is one of the five main mountain ranges in Taiwan and, according to Hevern, “offers the most spectacular views, with opportunities to see the ‘Sea of Clouds,’ at sunrise and sunset.”\n\nThai photographer Theerasak Saksritawee, who has traveled to Taiwan multiple times, agrees.\n\n“Hehuanshan (of the Central Mountain Range) is the most amazing nature in Taiwan, especially in May,” he says. “You’ll see the azalea flowers blossom on the top of the mountain. Wait for the sea of clouds and sunrise to appear in your photo frame.”\n\nTheerasak drove around Taiwan for weeks taking travel photos. His resulting otherworldly travel album has impressed local media and netizens alike, with his images going viral in Taiwan.\n\nAn eerily beautiful post-quake lake\n\nShuiyang, a destination for hiking and camping, stands out from other Taiwan nature tours.\n\nLocated between the Alishan National Forests and Sun Link Sea, the dreamy lake is a reminder of one of the island’s most tragic disasters.\n\n“This little gem is a result of the devastating Jiji earthquake in 1999,” says Hevern.\n\n“Coniferous trees collapsed, damming the river and creating a small lake. Now the sun bleached, dead trees stick straight out of the water to paint an incredible scene. There is nothing quite like it in Taiwan.”\n\nTaiwan’s stunning city views\n\nUnlike Hevern, Theerasak was first attracted to Taiwan by its city views in 2014.\n\n“I love Taipei 101; wherever you are you will see this building, I can take so many pictures with Taipei 101 in the background – just find a new foreground around you,” he says.\n\nOne of the best places to view it is atop a mountain near the city.\n\n“Datunshan viewpoint is where you will see Taipei city from above,” says Theerasak, adding that it’s best to visit on a foggy day with a telephoto lens.\n\nBut his favorite place to photograph is Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall, a monument in Taipei.\n\n“Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall is the most beautiful place in Taiwan. It’s also easy to go there. In the morning you will see the soldiers with the Taiwan flag, birds, bicycles, people and the sunrise,” he says.\n\nFor more incredible Taiwan scenes, check out the above gallery."
