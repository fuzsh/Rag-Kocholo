        "text": "Famous Taiwanese People: Taiwanese Artists, Scientists, Leaders, Musicians, Politicians and Athletes\n\nTaiwan may not be represented in the United Nations but that is a political issue that is subject to debate and may take years of discussion before being resolved. It does not detract from the fact that Taiwan has its own roster of famous people that have made an impact in the lives of people in Asia and the rest of the world, be it entertainers, musicians and people in the acting field, science and medicine as well as education and sports. Being a community of hard-working people, Taiwan has a crop of business people that created waves in the area of information and computer technology.\n\n:: List of Famous People from Taiwan ::\n\nAng Lee\n\nSense and Sensibility, Brokeback Mountain, Hulk (2003) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are just some of the memorable Hollywood films that Taiwanese movie director Ang Lee gave the world’s movie audiences. He is from Chaochou, Pingtung where he was born on the 23rd of October 1954. His parents highly valued education and he learned the Chinese classics at an early age. Ang Lee’s father was the principal at the National Tainan First Senior High School, where he graduated. While his father wanted him to be a professor, he failed the college/university examinations twice and decided to enroll at the National Arts School where he got interested in art and drama. After his mandatory military service, Lee enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1979 where he took his bachelor’s degree in theater. He received his MFA from New York University’s Tisch School of Arts. While still a student, Lee had already displayed his flair for directing. His 16mm short film, Shades of the Lake won the Best Drama Award in Short Film in his home country. It was a short film he did in 1982 while in graduate school. He was part of the crew of Joe’s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads, the thesis film of Spike Lee, his classmate at NYU. Ang Lee made Fine Line in 1984 for his own thesis. It won the Wasserman Award for Outstanding Direction given by New York University.\n\nWhile Lee made waves, attracted attention and got represented by William Morris Agency, it was not easy for him to find work initially and his molecular biologist wife became the breadwinner. While Lee became a full-time husband he wrote two screenplays, Wedding Banquet and Pushing Hands, which he submitted in 1990 to a Taiwan Government Information Service-sponsored competition. His screenplays won second and first places, respectively. Newly-promoted senior manager of a major film studio and first-time producer Li-Kong Hsu got Lee to direct Pushing Hands as a full-length feature film in 1991. Lee’s career took off after that and he directed films in Taiwan and later in Hollywood. He had won Academy Awards, Golden Globes, Golden Lions and other major awards for screenplays and directing.\n\nHou Hsiao-Hsien\n\nAnother film director that helped put Taiwan in the movie world map is Hou Hsiao-Hsien. He was born on April 8, 1947 in Mei County in Guangdong, China but his family moved to Taiwan when he was barely one year old. He studied at the National Taiwan Academy of Arts. He is a leading figure of the New Wave Cinema movement in Taiwan and has won many prestigious international awards from Cannes, Venice, Hawaii and Nantes. He is fond of the minimalist approach and his films often depict China’s history, conflicts between China and Taiwan and their impacts on the common people, as well as conflicts between Taiwanese and migrants from the mainland. Some of his award-winning films include The Boys from Fengkuei, A Summer at Grandpa’s, A Time to Live, A Time to Die, A City of Sadness (Gold Lion winner), The Puppetmaster, Good Men, Good Women and Millennium Mambo. Hou Hsiao-Hsien is not only a director; he also had produced eleven films and even acted in a few movies.\n\nChao Fong-pang\n\nCold Face Killer is the nickname given to Chao Fong-pang, a professional pool player who has been a legend in the sport. He had won quite a number of pool and billiards tournaments in his home country and abroad. He was born in Kaohsiung in Taiwan on the 15th of September 1967. Fong-pang was the first Asian to win a major title in pocket billiards when he defeated Germany’s Thomas Hasch in 1993 at the WPA World Nine-Ball Championship. He defeated Japan’s 1994 title holder Takeshi Okumura in the ICC in 1995. He won it again in 2000 by defeating Ismael Paez of Mexico with a score of 17-6, a world record in itself as it was the largest deficit in a world championship final. He is notable for using jump shots to win difficult matches, just like what he did to defeat Francisco Bustamante of the Philippines during their tie-breaker at the International Challenge of Champions (ICC) tour in 2001. In 2005 Fong-pang emerged the winner against 2004 ICC title holder Thomas Engert, another German.\n\nAt the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, he brought home the gold medal for the 8-ball individual and the bronze for the 9-ball individual.\n\nWu Chia-ching\n\nHe is dubbed as the Little Genius or Taishan Shentong in Taiwanese. Born on the 9th of February 1989, Chia-ching is the youngest player ever to win a World Pool Association World Nine-Ball Championship. He won it in 2005 at five months past the age of sixteen. He was the runner up in the Juniors Nine-Ball World Championship 2004 and was also the winner in 2005 in the WPA World Eight-Ball Championship.\n\nChia-ching grew up with his grandmother who owned a billiard hall where he learned to play the game. His grandmother was the one who brought him to competition venues on her scooter when he turned serious about pool. He applied for and obtained citizenship in mainland China, a move he said he decided to make to enable him to compete in more international pool tournaments. It was revealed in April 2011 that he has not given up his Taiwanese citizenship.

He also managed to establish a merchandising company in Japan with the inheritance he received from his family. In his biography Ando was quoted as saying that his tax evasion case that led to his imprisonment in 1948 and the loss of his company was due to the education scholarships he provided, an act that was considered as tax evasion during that time. After his release he formed a family-owned business named Nissin, which started out as a salt producer.\n\nAfter the war, people in Japan had to subsist on bread using wheat flour coming from the United States. Ando asked the Ministry of Health why that is so and was told that supply to make fresh noodles was not enough to meet the needs of the populace. Ando decided to try manufacturing the noodles himself and experimented with flash-frying them. He was 48 in 1958 when he achieved success in creating pre-cooked and instant noodles and marketed his product under the brand Chikin Ramen. His next successful product, the cup noodles in waterproof polystyrene cups was launched on the 18th of September 1971.
