        "text": "I am a diver, dancer, & athlete.\n\nI've been attending this school since KA and I have to say, it's been an incredible journey. From learning how to read and write to overcoming my fear of water, this school has provided me with unique opportunities that I will never forget.\n\nScuba diving has been one of my favorite activities, especially since I got certified a couple of years ago. But I never could have done it without TAS because it was when I was in the Lower School that the swimming program helped me learn how to not be so afraid of water. Now I obviously love water! The feeling of weightlessness and the vibrant colors of the ocean always leave me in awe. It’s like a different world down there. I also love to scuba dive because it’s a family activity. We are all divers, and we do it together. TAS may not have a scuba program yet, but I did learn how to swim here. I also learned how to stay calm under pressure, and those skills have allowed me to explore different parts of the ocean and learn about the creatures that call it home. It's an experience that not many kids my age gets to have, and I feel incredibly lucky to be a part of it.\n\nSports have also played a huge role in my life, and the school's athletics program has allowed me to participate in a variety of different sports. I honestly can’t just choose one! Badminton, rugby, and cross country are some of my favorites. I got into badminton first when I was really little as a way to connect with my family. I love that I can play it with my dad and grandpa. Both rugby and cross country came a little bit later in my life, but both helped me channel my competitive nature and blow off steam. I think it’s so fun to push yourself and compete with others. But at the end of the day, when I go running with my dad and we’re both listening to music, I know that athletics isn’t just about competition. It can also bring people together, like it has me and my dad. Not only have they taught me important life skills like teamwork and dedication, but they've also helped me build confidence in myself. Whether it's running alongside my teammates or cheering them on from the sidelines, being a part of a sports team is an experience that I cherish.\n\nLastly, I really love to dance, but I never thought that it would end up being as important to me as it is now. The school's dance program has allowed me to express myself in ways that I never thought possible, and I am so thankful to Ms. Dimple, Ms. Dethy, and Ms. Chuang for their help. They teach us a lot of different types of dance here, but my favorite is hip hop by far. I like to move to the fast beats and just let the music take over. It's an amazing feeling to be able to create something fun with my body and share it with others. TAS gives me and my friends so many opportunities to learn things, even if you’re not the best at it. I used to be scared to dance or try new things, but I don’t feel that way anymore because dance (and everything else put together) has helped me be more confident in general. Now I dance with my heart, and I don’t care what other people think of me."
