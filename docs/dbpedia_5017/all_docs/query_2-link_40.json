SGI Systems, Parts, Spares and Upgrades\n\n(check my current auctions!)\n\nSirius Video\n\nBroadcast-Quality Digital Video\n\nThe World's Most Powerful Combination of Workstation and Digital Video Technology\n\nThe Sirius Video digital video option board provides premier broadcast-quality video for the Silicon Graphics family of high-end workstations and compute servers. Sirius Video, coupled with the world's fastest graphics, is the first system to blend real-time digital video processing, computer-generated graphics, 3D geometry, image processing, and supercomputing processing. Video professionals as well as novices can use this powerful, fully interactive, general-purpose environment to produce dazzling broadcast-quality video. Its flexibility and power make it ideal for scientific or research applications, which require full-performance video capture and manipulation.\n\nPre/Postproduction, Broadcast, and Corporate Communications\n\nNow you can use a single cost-effective general-purpose system instead of expensive, special-purpose dedicated hardware for production, postproduction, broadcast, interactive television, and corporate communications. Perform off/on-line edits, composites, image alterations, CGI, digital video effects, animation, character generation, and more, all on a general-purpose system.\n\nImage Acquisition, Processing, and Analysis\n\nSirius Video offers application developers, scientists, researchers, and medical and technical professionals unprecedented performance for digital image manipulation, data capture and record, sequence playback, colorspace conversion, and live video texture at 30fps with high video resolution.\n\nOpen, Flexible, Expandable Platform\n\nSirius Video is available for POWER Onyx, Onyx, and Reality Station graphics workstations.\n\nAdditionally, it can be used in POWER CHALLENGE and CHALLENGE server configurations to provide video server capabilities. The most powerful systems in the Silicon Graphics binary-compatible product line are the Onyx and CHALLENGE family workstations and servers. These systems are based on a highly balanced architecture combining multiple CPUs with high-speed I/O and large memory capacities. Integrated with Sirius Video, they provide the most powerful, flexible, and expandable platform available for serious video requirements:\n\nUp to 16 gigabytes of main memory on Onyx or CHALLENGE family systems\n\nUp to 3.5 terabytes of data storage capacity on Onyx and CHALLENGE systems translates to 32 hours of uncompressed full-resolution video\n\nUp to 24 MIPS R4400 CPUs in the Onyx workstation and 36 CPUs in the CHALLENGE server\n\nSelectable Input and Output Capabilities\n\nSupport for multiple video formats, including 8 or 10-bit digital video I/O (4:4:4:4, 4:2:2:4 or 4:2:2), in addition to analog component, analog composite, and S-Video I/O capabilities\n\nTwo video input frame buffers which can each store up to 4 fields of full bandwidth (4:4:4:4) with 10-bits per component\n\nAccess through easy-to-use graphical user interface panel or callable video library routines from within an application\n\nPowerful Performance with Broadcast-Quality Results\n\nSupport for multiple Sirius Video boards in rack systems\n\nMultiple CCIR 601 input streams per board\n\nBroadcast-quality CCIR 601\n\nBroadcast-quality analog component (10-bit oversampled output)\n\nConsumer-quality analog composite NTSC, PAL, and S-Video\n\nReal-time video capture and output at 30fps or 25fps\n\nReal-time video to/from host memory via VME 32-bit or VME 64-bit transfer mode (Capture and transfer may not run concurrently; only one video source may be captured at a time)\n\nReal-time video texturing input capabilities at high resolution onto computer generated 3D geometry\n\nMaintains primary input source colorspace for transparent digital processing\n\nNo frame drops - Sirius Video coupled with the Onyx graphics framelock capability means that graphics display and video frame rates are synchronized\n\nUnrivaled Image Manipulation and Enhancement\n\nLive video in a window, which can then be manipulated via the graphics subsystem with IRIS Graphics Library or ImageVision Library\n\nUser-selectable color space conversions in going to/from RGB and YUV\n\nSeparate alpha/key inputs, output, and buffers allow compositing\n\nSeparate keys for each of the video input buffers allow compositing\n\nChroma Key generator allows soft alpha/key extraction from input sources\n\nComprehensive Built-In Functionality\n\nStandard V-LAN transmitter built-in for device control\n\nGeneral-purpose interface (GPI) for external event triggering\n\nSession recording with built-in scan converter - multiple high-resolution formats can be scan-converted down to 525 or 625 video output formats\n\nSignal interface connections via convenient rack-mountable remote access panel\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nVideo Formats\n\nDigital component 4:2:2,4:2:2:4, CCIR 601 (8/10-bits) 525 and 625 timings 4:4:4:4 SMPTE dual link (8/10 Bits) Analog component RGBA, YUVA Betacam, MII, SMPTE 525 and 625 timings PrYPbA 10-bit ADC/DAC 2x oversampling output Analog composite NTSC, PAL, S-Video 525 and 625 timings\n\nVideo Inputs\n\n2 serial/parallel digital CCIR 601, SMPTE dual link (serial I/O available as separate option) 1 analog component RCBA, YUVA, PrYPbA 1 analog composite NTSC, PAL, S-Video\n\nVideo Outputs\n\n1 serial/parallel digital CCIR 601, SMPTE dual link (serial I/O available as separate option) 1 analog component RGBA, YUVA, PrYPbA 1 analog composite NTSC, PAL, S-Video\n\nAdditional Features\n\nGenlocked output sync P-P jitter <10nsec 2 GPI input lines 2 GPI output lines V-LAN interface Loopthrus for all analog inputs\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nRequires VME Slot\n\nFull functionality with integrated graphics supportrequires RealityEngine, RealityEngine or VTX graphics Reduced server functionality without integrated graphicsrequires Crimson, POWER Series and CHALLENGE systems (includes server models, XS, XS24, Elan Graphics, Extreme and VGXT graphics systems)\n\nComponent Analog I/O\n\nInput impedance 50KOhm and 5pF capacitance Input return loss >40dB to 55MHz Component analog frequency response Input: +-0.25dB to 1MHz +-0.5dB to 5.4MHz Output: +-0.25dB to 1MHz +-0.5dB to 5.2MHz with sin x/x compensation Group delay +-20nsec to 5.5MHz Output signal to noise ratio >63dB typical, unweighted to 5.0MHz (GBR or YUV) Input signal to noise ratio >55dB unweighted to 5.0MHz (GBR or YUV)\n\nFor more information please call:\n\nU.S. 1(800) 800-7441\n\nEurope (41) 22-798.75.25\n\nNorth Pacific (81) 3-5420.71.10\n\nSouth Pacific (61) 2-879.95.00\n\nLatin America 1(415) 390.46.37\n\nCanada 1(416) 625-4747\n\nSilicon Surf - World Wide Web Server\n\nURL: http://www.sgi.com/\n\nCorporate Office\n\n2011 N.
