        "text": "As promised, Silicon Graphics Inc. on Tuesday unveiled its new strategy to build Intel technology into its workstations and also focus on the technical computing market. The maker of high-powered workstations and interactive computing systems also said it plans an initial public offering for its MIPS Technologies Inc. unit -- and a US$200 million spending cut, including a 10 percent reduction of SGI's workforce.\n\nMIPS owns architecture for high-volume consumer appliances such as videogame machines and handheld computing devices. Silicon Graphics bought MIPS six years ago to design chips for its computers, but the unit became less important to Silicon Graphics operations as the company moved toward Intel.\n\nIn addition to going whole hog with Intel, SGI Chairman Rick Belluzzo, who took over the Mountain View-based company in January, said the company would begin focusing on the technical computing market.\n\n\"We must aggressively focus on the markets where our unique strengths in visual computing and high-bandwidth systems add value,\" Belluzzo said at a press conference in New York. \"This ruthless focus will streamline the priorities of the organization. We are in execution mode.\"\n\nSilicon Graphics has already warned that it would post a significant loss in its fiscal third quarter, ending 31 March, as it continued to lose business to its rivals on both the high and low ends. Silicon Graphics stock was down 31 cents at US$15.75 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nBelluzzo, who worked at Hewlett-Packard for 22 years, said the company will implement a competitive financial model across the company and reduce costs. The company expects to cut about $200 million in operating expenses next year and reduce staff by nearly 10 percent through divestitures, streamlining, and other efforts.\n\nSteven Gomo, SGI's chief financial officer, said the company's plans would reduce the force \"by about 1,000 people\" from current levels. The company employs about 10,500 worldwide, 7,700 of which are in the United States. Gomo, speaking at the press conference, also said SGI was aiming to reverse a recent trend of rising costs.\n\nThe company is also looking at ways to potentially split off its Cosmo unit which develops multimedia and graphics software technologies. A final decision on how that would take place has not been made, Gomo said.\n\nTelegram CEO Pavel Durov’s Arrest Linked to Sweeping Criminal Investigation\n\nFrench authorities detained Durov to question him as part of a probe into a wide range of alleged violations—including money laundering and CSAM—but it remains unclear if he will face charges.\n\nIsrael Is Buying Google Ads to Discredit the UN’s Top Gaza Aid Agency\n\nThe UNRWA calls Israel’s strategy of promoting alleged misinformation “destructive.”\n\nPavel Durov’s Arrest Leaves Telegram Hanging in the Balance\n\nDurov has reportedly been detained in France over Telegram’s alleged failure to adequately moderate illegal content on the messaging app. His arrest sparked backlash and left some associates asking, what now?\n\n‘Should Art Be Regulated by the SEC?’: NFT Artists’ New Lawsuit Seeks Answers\n\nAt issue is whether digital collectibles can be considered a security. “What the SEC has done directly affects my ability to make a living,” one plaintiff says.\n\nWill the ‘Car-Free’ Los Angeles Olympics Work?\n\nOrganizers of the 2028 Summer Games will attempt to re-create the city’s public transport heyday of the early 20th century, but ousting the car—even for just a few weeks—will be costly.\n\nThe Apartment Rental Market Is Rigged by Algorithms, a DOJ Lawsuit Alleges\n\nThe US Department of Justice claims that a company called RealPage is responsible for price-fixing across millions of apartment rental units nationwide.\n\nEVs Are Losing Up to 50 Percent of Their Value in One Year\n\nSome electric car brands are hemorrhaging value, with the worst losing as much as $600 a day. In this investigation, WIRED outlines which models to watch, why this is happening, and how you can game the market to your advantage.\n\nHow Much Will It Cost to Charge Your Electric Car? It’s Complicated\n\nEV drivers in the US need to get out of that gas station car mindset."
