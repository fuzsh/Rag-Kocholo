        "text": "Ian Mapleson’s SGI Depot\n\nIan has refreshed his site, and has a lot of good stuff for sale. I can recommend his CD sets and OS installs – he knows what he’s doing, and you end up with a very usable machine.\n\nSGD Systems\n\nCheck out their clearance offers. They also tend to have a good stock of older parts.\n\nRapid Technology Partners\n\nI bought a load of Indys from them when Ian Mapleson was helping them clear a large amount of stock. Worth talking to – they have some good deals.\n\nSGI Warehouse\n\nI haven’t dealt with Neil Stevenson, but Ian had some systems listed and the prices seem good.\n\n13W3\n\nI’ve dealt with Ian before – good prices, and he usually has some goodies in the software section.\n\nCordnet\n\nTheir website tends to be a bit out of date, but Cordnet have some good deals, and a large stocklist. Well worth giving them a call to see if they have what you need in stock.\n\nDanic Ltd.\n\nDanic have some good stock and fairly keen prices – worth calling, as not all their stock list is online.\n\nAM IT Solutions\n\nFormed by one of the chaps from RTP. Their website doesn’t have much stock listed, but they do good deals on older kit. Worth calling.\n\nReputable Systems\n\nGreg Douglas has excellent prices and is a great guy to deal with. Get one of his LED light bars for your Octane!\n\nMini Computer Exchange\n\nMCE have a good range of stuff, and quick international shipping.\n\nB & B Solutions Inc.\n\nBased in Canada, they have some insane deals. Good guys to deal with\n\nSGI Remarketed Products\n\nRefurbished and off-lease kit direct from SGI.\n\nMashek Systems\n\nHaven’t dealt with him, but his prices can be good. Usually has a good stock of VW 320s.\n\nXS International\n\nI’ve heard good things about them, and they seem to have a good list of parts and systems."
