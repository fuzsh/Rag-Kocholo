SGI Systems, Parts, Spares and Upgrades\n\n(check my current auctions!)\n\nAfter this brochure was published, faster CPUs such as R4400/250 and R10000 were released, InfiniteReality graphics, etc. See the main SGI index for details of these later CPUs and graphics subsystems, eg. the InfiniteReality Technical Report covers the use of IR in Onyx systems.\n\nReality Station\n\nAdvanced Visualization Station\n\nPrice and Performance at Their Best\n\nAs the most affordable platform for RealityEngine2 graphics, the Reality Station graphics workstation is a breakthrough for the small organization or individual user. Reality Station is perfect for those seeking the ultimate in graphics, but who don't need a multiprocessor environment. It provides the performance of RealityEngine2 graphics in a single-CPU version of the Onyx architecture. Scientists, engineers, and creative professionals now have the graphics they've always wanted at a price they can afford.\n\nVisualization Station\n\nThe combination of high quality, high-speed graphics, and a low-cost platform makes Reality Station ideal for designing and manipulating 3D CAD models, industrial design, reviewing output from computational analysis, film and video postproduction, and monitoring training exercises. When teamed with Silicon Graphics' high-performance supercomputer and network servers, Reality Station becomes an advanced visualization station.\n\nFastest Graphics on the Planet\n\nRealityEngine2 architecture combines the industry's fastest polygon, pixel, and vector generation with unique image processing, display, and video capabilities. The RealityEngine2 scalable and expandable graphics architecture has 1.2 gigaflops of floating-point processing power dedicated solely to accelerating geometric and image processing functions. Advanced texturing and anti-aliasing features deliver unprecedented performance and realism for complex 3D visualization.\n\nWorld-Class Features\n\nReality Station has the most advanced real-time 3D graphics feature set available, including:\n\nReal-time texture mapping\n\nFull scene anti-aliasing\n\nExpandability to four Raster Managers for increased pixel fill and displayable resolution\n\nQuad buffering for interactive high-resolution stereoscopy\n\nHardware support for image processing\n\nStandard NTSC/PAL/S-Video output\n\nStereo in a window\n\n32-bit Z-buffer\n\nBroadcast-quality video options\n\nMulti-Channel Option for multiple display support\n\nSystem Power and Options\n\nReality Station combines the power of a 200MHz, 1MB cache, 64-bit RISC microprocessor with advanced RealityEngine2 graphics to provide leading-edge capabilities in a general-purpose deskside workstation. Reality Station supports up to 2GB of main memory, 30.1 GB of internal disk storage, and 3 VME slots.\n\nReality Station enables several video options such as Sirius Video, the digital video option board which provides premier broadcast-quality composite video output, real-time digital video processing, image alterations, and full-performance video capture and manipulation for scientific and research applications.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nPlatform:\n\nReality Station Processor Data Type MIPS R4400 200MHz Quantity 1 Primary Cache 16KB instruction, 16KB data Additional Cache 1MB per processor SPECint92 TBD SPECfp92 TBD PeakMFLOPS 100 DP MFLOPS, Linpack (1Kx1K) TBD Memory 64MB to 2GB 1- or 2-way interleaving, ECC protected Graphics RealityEngine2 Operating System IRIX 5\n\nGraphics:\n\nRealityEngine2 Anti-aliased vectors/sec 2.0M Triangle Meshes/sec 1.5M T-Mesh Gouraud, Z, lit 1.0M T-Mesh Textured 988K Quad Strips, Gouraud, Z 530K Pixel Fill, smooth, Z 90-360M Pixel Fill, textured, aa 55-230M 24-bit Z yes 32-bit Z yes Color 48-bit RGBA Color Planes 192 Overlay/Underlay planes 8 Max bits/pixel 256-1024 Texture Memory 4 or 16MB Frame Buffer Size 40 to 160MB Display VGA to HDTV 32-bit Pixel Read/Write 28.3M / 29.1M\n\nSystem Bus\n\nBandwidth 1.2GB/sec, parity protected Size 256-bit wide data path 40-bit wide physical address path\n\nHigh-Speed I/O Subsystem\n\nBus Type SGI HIO bus Bandwidth 320MB/sec per HIO bus No. of Buses 1\n\nIndustry-Standard I/O Subsystem\n\nBus Type VME64 bus Bandwidth 50MB/sec per VME64 bus No. of Buses 1 No. of Slots 3\n\nMass Storage\n\nInterfaces Up to 8 SCSI-2 channels Protocols SCSI-2, Fast/Wide, single-ended or differential Max.
