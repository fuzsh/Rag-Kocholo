        "text": "NEWS BRIEFS HPCwire\n\nMountain View, CA — SGI announced the first in a powerful new line of next-generation workstation products, the Silicon Graphics Fuel(TM) visual workstation, that offers three times better price/performance than other similarly configured workstations. Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation delivers unparalleled performance, productivity and precision to the desktop for a wide suite of applications in manufacturing, the sciences, defense and intelligence, energy and media.\n\nSilicon Graphics Fuel Visual Workstation\n\nThe new Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation is designed to maximize the performance of desktop applications while offering unprecedented price/performance value. Silicon Graphics Fuel is priced at 57% less than similarly configured workstations while offering significantly higher processing and application performance for three times the overall price/performance value. Leveraging industry-leading technology from SGI, Silicon Graphics Fuel features the latest MIPS(R) R14000A(TM) processor, the unparalleled VPro(TM) 3D graphics system for IRIX(R) operating system and a high-bandwidth design based on the SGI(R) 3000 family of Onyx(R) and Origin(R) systems. Due to its high-performance architecture, this workstation is perfectly designed to execute demanding applications for creative and technical users, while the 48-bit RGBA provides the highest level of precision available on any desktop system today. The Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation is complementary to the Silicon Graphics(R) Octane2(TM) workstation and Silicon Graphics O2+(TM) workstation and is binary compatible with current IRIX applications.\n\nAn innovative system architecture allows the Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation to provide high-performance processing and powerful graphics in a single-processor environment. Cost-conscious customers will also appreciate the introduction of this powerful system at $11,495 U.S. List, a 35% price reduction on the previous entry price for an SGI high-performance 64-bit workstation. The price/performance value of the new Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation makes highly specialized visual workstations from SGI more widely accessible to technical and creative teams.\n\n“SGI continues to lead the way in offering high-performance graphics workstations to help users visualize and understand the fundamental meaning of their most complex data-whether they are working in a standalone or collaborative environment,” said Susan Tellep, director of product marketing, SGI. “Now with SGI’s workstation and visualization technology at these unprecedented price points, more organizations are gaining access to these powerful desktop systems for breakthrough results.”\n\nPowerful Features\n\nThe Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation offers the unparalleled real-time response of the IRIX operating system and binary compatibility with the full line of SGI products. Within the bold fiery red chassis, Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation features:\n\n– Single 500MHz R14000A MIPS processor with 2MB L2 cache or 600 MHz with 4MB L2 cache, 200 MHz front side bus\n\n– VPro V10 or V12 graphics with up to 128 MB configurable graphics memory, 104MB texture memory and 48-bit RGBA (or 12-bit per color component — 4-bits higher than any other desktop system) with 16-bit Z buffer capability\n\n– Industry-leading memory bandwidth (3.2GB per second) and graphics bandwidth (1.6GB per second) on the desktop\n\n– Dual Channel Display capability for double the screen real estate with a single graphics board at resolutions up to 1920 x 1200 at 72Hz on each screen\n\n– A wide range of peripheral options including internal CD-ROM and four integrated PCI slots\n\n– The fifth-generation 64-bit IRIX operating system offering industry-leading real-time response, serviceability and reliability\n\nBenefits Across Multiple Industries Examples of the benefits the Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation will offer to SGI customers include:\n\n— For applications used in manufacturing, and more specifically design, the Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation provides the processing power, the graphics power and subsequent level of realism needed by designers for fast and accurate development cycles and the resulting competitive advantages that result from shorter time to market.\n\n— In the sciences, the new low entry price of MIPS processing power and VPro graphics in the Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation makes it more accessible to more researchers on a development team as well as to smaller research labs. In addition, Silicon Graphics Fuel is ideal for medical imaging applications in the diagnostic scanner industry and scientific visualization applications. The Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation’s ability to generate volume rendering to represent densities and temperatures, while preserving image integrity with 12-bit data paths is crucial for medical imaging applications.\n\n— Defense customers analyzing large data sets, such as terrain data generated by geospatial applications, benefit from the advanced graphics and texturing capabilities of Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation. The 104MB of texture memory provides great roam and zoom capabilities, while the VPro graphics provide accurate image rendering and outstanding geometry performance to meet the demanding requirements of applications such as flight simulation and geospatial imaging\n\n— In the oil and gas industry, geoscientists utilize the fast processing performance of the Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation to interpret 3D data sets interactively. In addition, the high-quality hardware-accelerated graphics and overall system performance enable fast and accurate definition of 3D drilling targets to help quantify economically extractable oil and gas resources for drilling and reservoir engineers. The Silicon Graphics Octane2 workstation and Silicon Graphics Fuel will be offered in conjunction to provide a complete range of cost-conscious desktop solutions for both large and small oil company exploration programs.\n\n— In the Media industries, digital content creators appreciate the higher bandwidth and faster processing that the Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation provides along with its industry-leading graphics for 3D modeling and animation applications. Content creators take advantage of the Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation’s 48-bit RGBA capability to maintain high image quality for multi-layered composites. To increase productivity, a high-resolution frame buffer allows the user to work and preview final results without waiting for time-consuming rendering.\n\n— Researchers will use the Silicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation to work with increasingly complex data sets at higher resolutions, with advanced image quality, transparency and depth over areas up to 4096×4096. Visualization applications also take advantage of the speed and accuracy provided by the industry-leading implementation of hardware-accelerated Phong-effects.\n\nThis new workstation complements the SGI vision of visual area networking capabilities by offering high-performance graphics workstations at an economical price-point that enables broader deployment for visualization applications.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nSilicon Graphics Fuel visual workstation will be available in Q1 of CY02 through SGI sales channels.
