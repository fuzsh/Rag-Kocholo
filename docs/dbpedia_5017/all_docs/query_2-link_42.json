        "text": "The prediction, in brief:\n\nI believe that the Internet is the information highway. I’m religious about this. I don’t think it’s cable television.\n\nPredictor: Clark, Jim\n\nPrediction, in context:\n\nIn a 1994 article in the New York Times, technology writer John Markoff interviews James H. Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics and co-founder of the new company Mosaic Communications Corporation. Markoff writes:”In the last year there has been a spirited debate between those who argue that the Internet is only a placeholder for a future commercial information network to be built by cable and telephone companies, and those who believe that the Internet will inevitably become the nation’s data highway. Mr. Clark said he was squarely in the Internet camp. ‘I believe that the Internet is the information highway,’ he said. ‘I’m religious about this. I don’t think it’s cable television.'”\n\nDate of prediction: January 1, 1994\n\nTopic of prediction: Information Infrastructure\n\nSubtopic: General\n\nName of publication: New York Times\n\nTitle, headline, chapter name: New Venture in Cyberspace By Silicon Graphics Founder\n\nQuote Type: Direct quote\n\nPage number or URL of document at time of study:\n\nSection 1; Page 39; Column 1; Financial Desk\n\nThis data was logged into the Elon/Pew Predictions Database by: Anderson, Janna Quitney"
