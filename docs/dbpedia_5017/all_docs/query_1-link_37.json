It is advisable to review this file any time\n\nData Explorer updates are applied.\n\n========================================================================\n\nCONTENTS\n\nTo go directly to an item, search for the item number beginning\n\nat the left margin.\n\n1.

Hardware Rendering on SGI Platforms\n\nA. Exceeding System/Process Memory\n\nThe most recent object displayed is stored in system memory. If this object\n\nis very large it is possible to exceed the system/process memory limits.\n\nIf this occurs you will receive many errors of the following form:\n\nERR#2_gl_makeroom\n\nThe only known workaround is to reduce the size of the object(s).\n\nB. The default is GL; how to choose OpenGL\n\nBy default, Data Explorer uses the GL library on the sgi architecture\n\nrather than the OpenGL library (this is a change from Data Explorer\n\nversion 3.1.4). Generally, performance is better using GL than\n\nusing OpenGL, however, some features which are available using\n\nOpenGL are not available with GL: multiple pixel width lines\n\nand antialiasing of lines are available *individually* with GL, but\n\nnot at the same time (see the Display manual page in the User Reference\n\nfor more information). Remote hardware rendering is available using\n\nOpenGL, but not using GL. You can override the default\n\nlibrary (gl) by specifying the -hwrender command line option as\n\nopengl, rather than gl. Alternatively, you can use the DXHWMOD\n\nenvironment variable, which should be set to DXhwddOGL.o instead of DXhwdd.o.\n\n2. Adding a Module\n\nA. Using the Module Builder\n\nWhen using the module builder to build a full dxexec, at link time the\n\nfollowing warning message may appear:\n\n/usr/bin/ld:\n\nWarning: sscanf: multiply defined\n\nprevious (used) definition from '/usr/lib/libmpc.a':\n\nnew (ignored) definition from '/usr/lib/libmpc.a'\n\nThis message should be ignored.\n\nB. Bad File Magic Number error\n\nIf IRIX 5 is not installed on the system, the linker will give\n\nthe error message \"Object file format error, bad file magic number\".\n\nC. Runtime-loadable modules\n\nYou need to use -mdf flag on dx to load runtime modules from the\n\ncommand line if you are using more than 1 processor. That is,\n\nyou cannot use the \"Load Module Description\" option of the File menu\n\nto load them after Data Explorer has started.\n\nYou may notice warnings when you compile runtime-loadable modules.\n\nThese are simply warnings about subroutines which are referenced\n\nby the runtime-loadable module. They will be found in the running\n\ndxexec. These warnings do *not* mean that your subroutine will not\n\nwork.\n\n3. Gamma Correction\n\nWhen the Data Explorer executive is running on the sgi archecture,\n\n8-bit windows are assumed to already be gamma-corrected, so\n\nDXGAMMA is by default set to 1. Otherwise, DXGAMMA is by default\n\nset to 2. You can override the default gamma correction by\n\nsetting DXGAMMA, DXGAMMA_8BIT, DXGAMMA_12BIT, or DXGAMMA_24BIT.\n\nIf set, DXGAMMA_NBIT overrides the value set by DXGAMMA.\n\n4. Changes for version 3.1.4\n\nA. Using Shared Memory is now the default\n\nData Explorer now uses shared memory by default on sgi machines.\n\nB. Change in behavior of DXSHMEM\n\nIn versions of Data Explorer prior to 3.1.4, DXSHMEM, if set to\n\nanything, would force shared memory to be used. In version 3.1.4,\n\nDXSHMEM must be set to anything other than -1 for shared memory to be\n\nused; if set to -1, then the data segment will be extended, for\n\narchitectures for which this is permissible.\n\nC. Fonts have changed\n\nData Explorer 3.1.2 and all previous versions used different fonts\n\nwhen displaying on sgi machines than when displaying on any other machine.\n\nIn 3.1.4, the fonts are uniform across platforms. The correct fonts are\n\na little bit larger than the old sgi fonts. This is a potential\n\nproblem for control panels since the some text strings may not fit the\n\nspace allotted. (This actually fixes a problem where your panels\n\nlooked fine when displaying on an sgi but looked bad when displaying\n\non any other machine.) Users can revert to the pre-3.1.4 fonts by\n\nadding the following to the file DX in $HOME or in a directory in\n\nthe XAPPLRESDIR environment variable:\n\nDX*fontList:-adobe-helvetica*bold-r*14*=bold,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*bold-r*12*=small_bold,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*bold-r*18*=big_bold,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*bold-r*24*=huge_bold,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*medium-r*14*=normal,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*medium-r*12*=small_normal,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*medium-r*18*=big_normal,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*medium-r*24*=huge_normal,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*medium-o*12*=small_oblique,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*medium-o*18*=big_oblique,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*medium-o*24*=huge_oblique,\\\n\n-adobe-helvetica*medium-o*14*=oblique\n\nNOTE: line breaks and line continuation characters are here just for\n\nreadability. The user must enter this as 1 continuous line with no\n\nline continuation characters, carriage returns, or spaces.\n\nOnly those users who would be satisfied with the restriction of never\n\nrunning a net on some machine other than an sgi should consider doing this.\n\n5. Using Large Amounts of Memory\n\nIf you have problems starting up DX with more than 512 Mbytes of\n\nmemory, use the \"systune\" command to check and set kernel tuneable\n\nparameters to allow a user process to allocate more space. You may\n\nalso have to adjust the \"limits\" or \"ulimits\" settings to allow large\n\namounts of memory to be used.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following trademarks apply to this information:\n\nIBM is a registered trademark of International Business Machines Corporation.\n\nIBM Visualization Data Explorer is a trademark of International\n\nBusiness Machines Corporation.\n\nIRIX and Silicon Graphics are registered trademarks of Silicon Graphics, Inc."
