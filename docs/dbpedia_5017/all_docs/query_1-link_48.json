        "text": "Nintendo of America Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc. will announce Monday that they are collaborating on a new generation of video game players, people close to the companies said today.\n\nNeither company would comment, but they have scheduled a joint news conference for Monday morning.\n\nThe new-generation players would incorporate a version of the MIPS microprocessor used in Silicon Graphics work stations, which would allow photo-realistic images and high speed. Silicon Graphics machines are used to produce special effects in films, including the dinosaurs in Steven Spielberg's \"Jurassic Park.\" Significantly Lower Cost\n\nA computer industry official said MIPS, a subsidiary of Silicon Graphics, had developed a version of its R4000 processor that operated on less than one-half watt and could be produced for about $40 each. This is a significant drop from previously announced versions of the chip, which have aimed at a target cost of $80 to $200 and power consumption of 1.5 to 2 watts. MIPS, which has no production capability of its own, is said to have decided that Toshiba will manufacture the chip.\n\n\"The mere fact of a business relationship there is significant because of Nintendo's phenomenal ability to drive volume,\" said Michael Slater, publisher of The Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. \"If it works at all, it could bring MIPS to levels of volume they never dreamed of,\" he said. He noted that the Sony Corporation had also discussed using the MIPS chip in consumer products."
