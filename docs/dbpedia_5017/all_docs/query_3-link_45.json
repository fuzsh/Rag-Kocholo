It was all so beneficial.\"\n\n— Jess H.\n\n\"We were able to make a massive breakthrough in the product excellence journey. It JUST worked. Things clicked. The teams re-engaged and re-energized. We’re sitting on the launchpad of the most impactful work we have ever done.\"\n\n— Marko D.\n\n\"In the few weeks since our workshop ended we've already made material progress implementing some of the best practices you showed us. I feel like it's every other meeting where someone brings up the workshop and challenges our legacy way of thinking in favor of trying something new. Personally, I'm more excited than I have been in a while to come to work everyday and deliver for our customers armed with new ways of thinking about organization and execution.\"\n\n— Greg L."
