We were particularly drawn to their efficiency, safety (no carbon monoxide risk and reduced fire risk), and their environmental impact.”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“My favorite feature is the ability to control both heating and air with a smart thermostat, which is aware of my electric rate plan (time-of-use).”\n\nKey Advice\n\n“Be sure to get at least three quotes from contractors.”\n\nStephen | Campbell\n\n1962 Home\n\n• Heat Pump Water Heater\n\n• Electric Vehicle\n\n• EV Charger\n\n• Electric Dryer\n\nInspiration – Sustainability\n\n“Our experience of going electric has been very smooth. We love driving our EV for so many reasons, not the least of which is that we’re no longer polluting the environment when we use it and spending almost nothing to maintain the vehicle. We also take advantage of charging it overnight when electricity costs are lowest.”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“My favorite feature is that I’m using clean, sustainable electricity instead of carbon producing natural gas”\n\nKey Advice\n\n“I would advise them to think more about climate change and how they have an opportunity to make a difference by using solar and wind powered electricity rather than natural gas.”\n\nJudy | Campbell\n\n2009 Home\n\n• Heat Pump Water Heater\n\n• Heat Pump HVAC\n\n• Rooftop Solar\n\n• Electric Vehicle\n\n• EV Charger\n\nInspiration – Family\n\n“The experience was seamless and I really appreciate being able to set an exact temperature for the water heater as I live with a temperature sensitive young child.”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“I enjoy the even heated water.”\n\nKey Advice\n\n“There are a lot more environmentally friendly options out there now, and a lot of rebates that you could qualify for, so be curious and courageous in making the transition!”\n\nAmit | Cupertino\n\n1982 Home\n\n• Heat Pump Water Heater\n\n• Induction Cooking\n\n• Battery Storage\n\n• Electric Vehicle\n\n• EV Charger\n\n• Rooftop Solar\n\n• Electric Dryer\n\n• Electric Lawncare\n\nInspiration – Technology\n\n“I was blown away by the simplicity and energy efficiency of the heat pump.

It is better for you wallet, your health, and the planet. There are many great rebates and resources available to you that make it much easier and more affordable – you won’t look back!”\n\nJudy | Los Altos Hills\n\n1966 Home\n\n• Heat Pump Water Heater\n\n• Heat Pump HVAC\n\n• Induction Cooking\n\n• Electric Dryer\n\n• Battery Storage\n\n• Rooftop Solar\n\n• Electric Fireplace\n\n• Smart Thermostat\n\nInspiration – Next Generation\n\n“We’re a very environmental-conscious couple with young kids who we’d love to raise as earth-loving, environmentally conscious individuals. It’s been a great educational process as we teach our kids.”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“We feel like being in the sunshine state of California, installing solar panels is a no-brainer. We love being net-zero! I cook everyday and the induction cooktop is just so fast to heat and so easy to clean.”\n\nKey Advice\n\n“I’d say to do your research early, months before starting the design phase or even approaching an architect to first figure out what you want. Once you know what you want, hop onto federal and state or local government sites to find out about various support programs that are available. SVCE and BayREN were so helpful with many resources including contractor options to choose from.”\n\nTom | Los Altos\n\n2012 Home\n\n• Heat Pump Water Heater\n\n• Heat Pump HVAC\n\n• Induction Cooking\n\n• Rooftop Solar\n\nInspiration – Great Contractor\n\n“Via GreenTown Los Altos, I was referred to a company called Emerald ECO who specialize in integrating different elements. They helped figure things out like: How much is our electricity use likely to increase by as we shift from gas to electric? How do we future proof to add an EV over the next year? Should we include a battery and how?”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“I get near-daily satisfaction from reminding myself that we’ve taken fossil fuels out of the house entirely and everything’s largely powered from the sun.”\n\nKey Advice\n\n“It’s easier than you might think, once you find the right help.”\n\nJustin | Los Gatos\n\n2020 Home\n\n• Heat Pump Water Heater\n\n• Induction Cooking\n\n• Battery Storage\n\n• Electric Vehicles\n\n• EV Chargers\n\n• Rooftop Solar\n\nInspiration – Self – Sufficiency\n\n“Given that we were installing solar, it seemed logical to max out our use of ‘free’ electricity. With a battery backup, it would make us much more self-sufficient. So we made the decision early on to go all-electric in our re-build project.”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“We love having solar and battery backup, both for the peace of mind and for not feeling ‘guilty’ when using energy.”\n\nKey Advice\n\n“It’s easy! I don’t notice or miss gas at all and I think our indoor air quality is much better.”\n\nCarol | Saratoga\n\n1965 Home\n\n• Heat Pump Water Heater\n\n• Heat Pump HVAC\n\n• Battery Storage\n\n• Electric Vehicle\n\n• EV Charger\n\n• Rooftop Solar\n\n• Electric Dryer\n\nInspiration — Convenience\n\n“SVCE was offering a good rebate so I upgraded my panel first thing, along with having a heat pump hybrid water heater installed in place of my gas water heater.”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“The Tesla batteries hold a lot of electricity and click on very fast whenever my electricity goes out. I can’t even tell when it happens; it’s that fast. But mostly I use the batteries to power my house during peak and part peak hours each day.”\n\nKey Advice\n\n“Just do it. Gas makes your home unhealthy, and it is even worse for the planet.”\n\nCurt | Gilroy\n\n1985 Home\n\n• Heat Pump Water Heater\n\n• Heat Pump HVAC\n\n• Electric Vehicle\n\nInspiration – Comfort\n\n“The contractor upgraded our heating ducts, and this allowed our heat pump to provide much more even heat across the rooms in the house, while doing all of it for essentially no monthly cost due to the solar panels.”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“The new heating and air conditioning system is much more effective at regulating the temperature for the first floor and second floor of the house. It turns out our prior AC system had an undersized air return. The new system is also much quieter than the old system.”\n\nKey Advice\n\n“There are rebates and tax incentives available now, and those may not be there a few years down the road.”\n\nSeema Beauty Salon | Milpitas\n\n1982 Beauty Salon\n\n• Tankless Electric Water Heater\n\nInspiration – Water Savings\n\n“I urge all Beauty Salons to switch to tankless electric water heaters, especially considering how much water we use in the beauty salon services.”\n\nFavorite Feature\n\n“The water heater is soo compact.
