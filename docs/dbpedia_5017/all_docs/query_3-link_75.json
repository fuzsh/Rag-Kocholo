        "text": "In December 1997, after a lengthy evaluation of domestic supercomputer technology by NCARâ€™s Scientific Computing Division and representatives from other divisions, NCAR decided to invest the FY1998 Climate Simulation Laboratory (CSL) computational budget in a Silicon Graphics Origin2000.\n\nThe system was delivered on May 18, 1998, and made available to six CSL projects on June 24. Ute had 128 superscalar processors, each processor with a theoretical peak performance of 500 megaflops, so the system had a theoretical peak of 64 gigaflops. Users typically achieved 5-10% of peak performance.\n\nUte had 16 gigabytes of distributed global shared memory, 455 gigabytes of disk space, and HIPPI connectivity to the Mass Storage System. It ran the IRIX operating system and supported Fortran 90, Fortran 77, C, and C++ compilers. Ute was especially suited for long-running, highly parallel jobs.\n\nBy the end of FY1998, system utilization on Ute exceeded 80%. This high level of utilization was exceptional and unexpected for a distributed shared-memory architecture. Ute was decommissioned on July 15, 2002."
