To watch in the lounge, simply use a media streaming box or compatible smart TV to watch on the big screen.\n\nThe choice is all yours.\n\nWith our HDHomeRun app you can watch live HDTV on your games console or smart media box. Simply load up our app from the appropriate store, and your box becomes your one device for games, entertainment and, most importantly, live HDTV.\n\nAnd if you have subscription cable (US only), you can watch protected content too. So you can cut down on cable boxes that you need to rent.\n\nNot just one TV – now you can watch TV on all the smart screens in your home.\n\nZero configuration! From a single smart TV to as many devices as you want – everything is auto-detected and works together as one DVR. Your home network becomes your DVR.\n\nNo more recordings stuck inside one box. No more being forced to watch on the one TV that does DVR. This is TV the way you want. On your terms.\n\nDon’t buy another HDMI box. You already have it – use your favorite Android TV, Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, XBox, iOS, LG, Windows, Mac devices you already own and enjoy.\n\nNever run out of tuners to record shows – you can add any number of HDHomeRun tuners on your network and they all work together as one DVR.\n\nNever run out of recording space – you can add any number of HDHomeRun FLEX tuners with USB attached hard drives, any number of network attached storage (NAS) devices, and any number of Windows/Mac/Linux PCs acting as storage – the combined storage works as one big storage pool for DVR recording.\n\nIt’s a re-imagined DVR solution. It can be as simple as a laptop or as expansive as a multi-client, multi-NAS, multi-tuner masterpiece.\n\nInstall the app and you are running. Give it a few recording tasks and it goes to work."
