        "text": "Silicon Graphics International is a manufacturer of high-performance computing solutions, including computer hardware and software, founded in 1981 by Jim Clark. Its initial market was 3D graphics display terminals. SGI’s first generation products, starting with the IRIS 1000 (Integrated Raster Imaging System) series of high-performance graphics terminals, were based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors. The later IRIS 2000 and 3000 models evolved into full UNIX workstations.\n\nOne of their products was the UNIX system used by Lex Murphy while trying to reboot the Jurassic Park security sytesms."
