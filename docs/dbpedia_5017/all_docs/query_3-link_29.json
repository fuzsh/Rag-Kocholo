SGI said it generated about 50 percent of its product revenue from its servers and supercomputers.\n\nUnder the new system, the company's products will be separated into three primary sub-brands under the SGI master brand umbrella. The three sub-brands include SGI servers and services, Silicon Graphics visual work stations and Cray supercomputers."
