        "text": "Object Details\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc.\n\nDarfon Electronics Corp\n\nDescription\n\nThe Silicon Graphics O2 microcomputer was designed as an entry-level high-quality graphics and image processing workstation. The chassis is dark blue with a black base, marked on front with \"SiliconGraphics\" on the top, and \"O2\" on the base.\n\nThe keyboard is a standard black computer keyboard marked \"sgi\" in the upper right corner and has an extra-long interface cable.\n\nThe three button mechanical mouse is dark gray and has an extra-long interface cable.\n\nThe carrying bag is a blue and black padded fabric bag with zippers, velcro closures, two handles, and a detachable shoulder strap. Inside are two pockets with flap closures, one open pocket, one zippered pocket, and an open sleeve for carrying the keyboard.\n\nThe objects in accession 2016.0057 and non-accession 2016.3032 are related.\n\nDonor Glenn Cholister was issued this Silicon Graphics workstation not long after he went to work for the company in February of 199 . As a systems engineer, he used it to provide 24 hour customer support from his home office.\n\nLocation\n\nCurrently not on view\n\nCredit Line\n\nGift of Glenn Cholister\n\nID Number\n\n2016.0057.01\n\naccession number\n\n2016.0057\n\ncatalog number\n\n2016.0057.01\n\nObject Name\n\nmicrocomputer\n\nPhysical Description\n\nfabric (overall, carrying bag material)\n\nsilicon (overall, microcomputer material)\n\nplastic (overall, microcomputer material)\n\nMeasurements\n\noverall: 32 cm x 36 cm x 50 cm; 12 19/32 in x 14 3/16 in x 19 11/16 in\n\nmicrocomputer: 30 cm x 24 cm x 32 cm; 11 13/16 in x 9 7/16 in x 12 19/32 in\n\nkeyboard: 4 cm x 46.5 cm x 17 cm; 1 9/16 in x 18 5/16 in x 6 11/16 in\n\nkeyboard interface cable: 285 cm; 112 7/32 in\n\ncarrying bag: 32 cm x 36 cm x 50 cm; 12 19/32 in x 14 3/16 in x 19 11/16 in\n\nmouse: 3 cm x 15.5 cm x 12 cm; 1 3/16 in x 6 3/32 in x 4 23/32 in\n\nmouse interface cable: 301 cm; 118 1/2 in\n\nplace made\n\nChina\n\nUnited States of America\n\nSee more items in\n\nMedicine and Science: Computers\n\nComputers & Business Machines\n\nNational Museum of American History\n\nSubject\n\nComputers\n\nRecord ID\n\nnmah_1824721\n\nMetadata Usage (text)\n\nCC0\n\nGUID (Link to Original Record)\n\nhttp://n2t.net/ark:/65665/ng49ca746b3-0829-704b-e053-15f76fa0b4fa"
