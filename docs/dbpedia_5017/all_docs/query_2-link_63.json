        "text": "Important\n\nSummer School Notice\n\nWelcome! We're glad you have joined us for Summer School!\n\nIf your school has given you a deadline for completing a course, you MUST follow their dates. Plan your time!!\n\nWarning - Assignments can take over 7 days to grade, in August it could be longer. Make sure you submit assignments as you finish each unit so you are not left waiting for a lot of assignments to be graded at the end of your summer semester. You cannot complete the course and generate your transcript until all assignments are graded.\n\nOur Summer Semester ends on August 31. IF your transcript needs to say Summer, you MUST have all your assignments submitted BEFORE August 15 AND take the Final Exam on or before August 31. You can still submit assignments after August 15, but we cannot guarantee they will be graded before August 31. Courses finished after August 31 will say Fall on the transcript. If you don't know your school or school district's policy on summer school courses and the requirements for the transcript, please reach out to your school counselor or your school district and ask. Each School District sets its own policy, so we cannot provide you with guidance. Please plan your time accordingly. Thank you for choosing SVHS for your summer school courses!!\n\nTranscripts - you can request a transcript anytime; use the link at the end of your course or the one in the top menu. A transcript reports ALL courses you have taken with us and those that are still in progress. After you take the Final Exam, the course is over. The date you take the Final Exam determines the semester we report the course on your transcript. Here are our semester dates; they may differ from your regular school:\n\n2023-24 Semester Dates\n\nFall - Sep 1 to Jan 14.\n\nSpring - Jan 15 to May 31\n\nSummer - Jun 1 to Aug 31"
