        "text": "XFS is SGI’s scaleable, high performance extent-based filesystem. CXFS is an evolution of XFS that allows multiple clients to access the same filesystem at the same time on your SAN.\n\nAs systems scale and data volumes grow, access to, and manipulation of that data becomes a serious bottleneck.\n\nI’ve found that many people are unaware of CXFS, or it’s benefits, and in general there’s a fair amount of confusion over the difference between concurrent access to a SAN filesystem versus shared cluster filesystems, as provided by something like Clustered VxFS.\n\nSo, I’ve collected together some documents and information which will give a good grounding on CXFS, and hopefully help show what an impressive feat it is.\n\nDMF – Data Migration Facility – is a valuable tool that can live off the back of CXFS. You might be familiar with the concepts of HSM – Hierarchical Storage Management. DMF is pretty much the same thing.\n\nSGI’s CXFS page\n\nCXFS Administration Guide from Techpubs\n\nLocal copy\n\nLocal copies of:\n\nCXFS datasheet\n\nCXFS whitepaper\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory CXFS briefing\n\nR. Kent Koeniger’s April 1999 briefing – a very good overview\n\nLocal Mirror\n\nBacking up and Restoring multi-terabyte datasets A white paper where SGI demostrate 10TB per hour backup throughput\n\nLocal Mirror\n\nNCAR Visualisation and Enabling Technologies\n\nA report detailing CXFS performance\n\nLocal Mirror\n\nSGI Mobile Innovation Centre at University of Waterloo\n\nNotes from SGI’s MIC visit to UWaterloo in September 2003 – details of CXFS and DMF\n\nLocal Mirror\n\nScaleability and Performance in Modern Filesystems\n\nAn SGI paper comparing UFS, XFS, VxFS and NTFS – a good overview of XFS and how it works, and how that compares to other common filesystems\n\nLocal Mirror\n\nI highly recommend not only checking out http://freeware.sgi.com but also pages on the Other Sites page for other software.\n\nFSN – the 3D File System Navigator\n\nDownload: fsn.tar.Z\n\nNot one I’ve written myself, but this is the ELF binary of the famous FSN, which featured in Jurassic Park. You can find out more by reading this post.\n\nAll the other applications on this page have been compiled using GCC under IRIX 6.5 on my Octane\n\nRoot disk cloning script\n\nDownload: clone_root_disk.ksh\n\nThe XLV/XVM plexing option is expensive – very expensive. Yet everyone needs a backup of their root disk. This korn script can be run nightly from cron, and will clone your root disk. All you need is another disk in the machine, which has already been partitioned by fx, and away you go!\n\nThe script is pretty straightforward, so can easily be modified to clone other important disks in your machine.\n\nQuake, Quake2, and mods\n\nVersion: Quake2 3.20\n\nDownload: SGI Quake local mirror\n\nDug out from an old backup tape, here’s my mirror of the SGI Quake pages from SGI’s website. Quake, Quake2, plus some entertaining mods like Action Quake 2.\n\nAllegro\n\nVersion: 4.1.9 (unstable branch)\n\nDownload: allegro-4.1.9.tardist\n\nAllegro is a cross-platform gaming library – similar to SDL. Off the top of my head, you’ll need ESD installed to get sound. There’s an ESD tardist on the SGI Freeware website.\n\nThe Allegro homepage can be found at http://sunsite.dk/allegro\n\nElite:TNK\n\nVersion: 1.0\n\nDownload: elite-tnk.tardist\n\nElite is the greatest computer game known to man. Ever. Elite:TNK is the result of a project by Christian Pinder to reverse-engineer Elite from the original BBC disk version.\n\nThis requires Allegro, and runs splendidly on my Octane. It installs in /usr/local/elite-tnk, and the binary (newkind) must be run from within there.\n\nThe Elite:TNK home page used to be found at http://www.cjpinder.clara.net/elite.html, but this site now appears to be dead.\n\nActX\n\nVersion: 1.2.1\n\nDownload: actx-1.2.1.tardist.gz\n\nActX is a collection of anime window sitters (Active X Window System).\n\nThe home page can be found at http://kurumi.sakura.ne.jp/~chimari\n\nAkaneClock\n\nVersion: 0.31\n\nDownload: akaneclock-0.31.tardist\n\nAkaneClock is an excellent anime clock. Lots more fun to have sitting on your desktop than the normal clock.\n\nThe home page can be found at http://kurumi.sakura.ne.jp/%7Echimari/ActX\n\naterm\n\nVersion: 0.4.2\n\nDownload: aterm-0.4.2.tardist\n\naterm is my preferred terminal. It allows background transparency, and with the Buffy GTK theme fits right in with the Indigo Magic desktop.\n\nThe home page can be found at http://aterm.sourceforge.net/\n\nPRNGD\n\nVersion: 0.9.24\n\nDownload: prngd-0.9.24.tardist\n\nPRNGD is the Pseudo Random Number Generator Daemon – a source of entropy. You’ll need a decent source of entropy for any cryptographic applications – OpenSSL, for example. PRGND saves any entropy it has when it’s shutdown – this means you have a strong source of entropy right from when your machine boots. It also doesn’t generate a ‘pool’ of entropy, so, unlike EGD, it can’t be drained and won’t block.\n\nThe home page can be found at http://www.aet.tu-cottbus.de/personen/jaenicke/postfix_tls/prngd.html\n\nGnuPG\n\nVersion: 1.0.6\n\nDownload: gnupg-1.0.6.tardist\n\nGNU Privacy Guard is an OpenPGP compliant Open Source replacement for PGP. Personally, I’ve used PGP 2.6.3i for donkeys years, but more and more software appears to be written to use GnuPG specifically – hence this tardist. This version isn’t the most recent, but works fine for me. I may build a newer tardist sometime if there is enough demand.\n\nThe home page can be found at http://www.gnupg.org/\n\nzlib\n\nVersion: 1.1.4\n\nDownload: zlib-1.1.4.tardist\n\nzlib is a compression library. Pretty much anything that will use compression will need this. This version fixes some potential security flaws with previous versions. Note that any applications statically compiled against older versions will need to be re-compiled against this new version to use the fixes.\n\nThe home page can be found at http://www.gzip.org/zlib/"
