        "text": "The Fuel is Silicon Graphics’ last MIPS based entry level graphics workstation. Like it’s bigger brother the Tezro, it’s based around the updated innards of the Origin 3000 machines – in the same way the Octane used the same innards as the Origin 2000.\n\nThe family lineage goes like this:\n\nOrigin 3000 -> Origin 300 -> Tezro -> Fuel Origin 2000 -> Origin 200 -> Octane\n\nThe advantage this gives the Fuel is much faster memory bus speeds, as well as multiple PCI channels and faster throughput to the graphics card. Unless you need multi-CPUs, you’ll find Fuel faster than Octane. Taking into account the cost of an Octane2 with a V10 board set, the Fuel represents a massive bargain right now.\n\nSGI sold the Fuel with no sound card, providing extra cost options of either a PCI based card, or a USB sound system. This does actually make sense, if you think about Fuel’s target CAD and graphics markets – cut the cost of manufacturing by pulling out parts that aren’t used by the majority of the client base.\n\nMy current problem was two-fold:\n\nI want to get one of my 1600SW screens wired into my Fuel\n\nI want some sound on the Fuel as well\n\nThe Fuel ready for it’s upgrades\n\nSolution to problem number one is to buy a Niktec GFX-1600SW. It takes up a single PCI slot for power (so no drivers needed) and converts DVI to OpenLDI. It’s a nice neat internal solution that’ll work on anything with a spare PCI slot.\n\nSolution to problem number 2 is to purchase a Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS. This is supported natively under IRIX, and is much much cheaper than the other supported sound options for SGI gear.\n\nReady for insertion – left to right:\n\nSoundBlaster Audigy 2 ZS, GFX-1600SW, DVI->DVI cable\n\nTotal time to plug everything in was under 5 minutes – the Fuel is very very easy to get into.\n\nInside the Fuel. V10 boardset at the bottom.\n\nNote the blue vent in the middle for cooling RAM and CPU\n\nEverything in place. Note the DM10 firewire card\n\nThe only issue I faced was that I’d forgotten to reconfigure the X server before shutting down the machine. The configured resolution was 1900×1280, for the 24″ CRT I had plugged in before. This would clearly not work with the 1600SW.\n\nThe easiest option to this was to hit ESC once the Fuel had started booting, to drop into the graphical PROM menu. The default graphics settings appear to be 1024×768, and these can’t be changed, so no matter what you have plugged into a Silicon Graphics machine, you should always have something displayed during power on.\n\nFrom the main PROM menu I entered the PROM monitor, then typed single and hit enter. This tells the machine to boot IRIX, but drop into single user mode. You just then need to enter the root password when prompted, and you have a root login in single user mode.\n\nReconfiguring the X server was then as straightforward as entering:\n\n/usr/gfx/setmon 1600x1024_60\n\nAnswer No to whether or not you want this as the power on default. Remember, you can’t change that, and trying to will cause setmon to error out. Once setmon has done it’s magic, just type reboot, and wait for the machine to restart.\n\nThe graphical login window should pop up and you’ll be able to login to X with the new resolution fitting nicely on your 1600SW.\n\nWe can check the graphics board set configuration from the command line using the gfxinfo command:\n\nvalaraukar # /usr/gfx/gfxinfo Graphics board 0 is \"ODYSSEY\" graphics. Managed (\":0.0\") 1600x1024 BUZZ version B.1 PB&J version 1 32MB memory Banks: 2, CAS latency: 3 Monitor 0 type: UFC 0 Channel 0: Origin = (0,0) Video Output: 1600 pixels, 1024 lines, 60.00Hz (1600x1024_60)\n\nHere’s the output from hinv after the hacking about:\n\nvalaraukar # uname -a IRIX64 valaraukar 6.5 01090133 IP35 valaraukar # uname -R 6.5 6.5.29m valaraukar # hinv 1 600 MHZ IP35 Processor CPU: MIPS R14000 Processor Chip Revision: 2.3 FPU: MIPS R14010 Floating Point Chip Revision: 2.3 Main memory size: 1024 Mbytes Instruction cache size: 32 Kbytes Data cache size: 32 Kbytes Secondary unified instruction/data cache size: 4 Mbytes Integral SCSI controller 2: Version IEEE1394 SBP2 Integral SCSI controller 0: Version QL12160, low voltage differential Disk drive: unit 1 on SCSI controller 0 Integral SCSI controller 1: Version QL12160, single ended CDROM: unit 6 on SCSI controller 1 IOC3/IOC4 serial port: tty1 IOC3/IOC4 serial port: tty2 IOC3 parallel port: plp1 Graphics board: V10 Integral Fast Ethernet: ef0, version 1, module 001c01, pci 4 Iris Audio Processor: version EMU revision A4, number 1 DMediaPro DM10 FW option: unit 0, revision 1.1.0 USB controller: type OHCI\n\nYou can see the Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS card is recognised by the Iris Audio Processor driver – no messing around needed.\n\nAgain, none of this required any fiddling with drivers or messing around – you should be able to cheaply add sound to your Fuel in 10 minutes or less, and I picked up the Soundblaster Audigy 2 ZS card for £19.\n\nSilicon Graphics have always made great workstations. I’m not just talking about brutal 3D monsters that could apply video feeds as textures in real time (over a decade ago). The machines are responsive and balanced, and this makes them perfect for general desktop use.\n\nMy Octane can’t be bogged down no matter what I throw at it, and since I upgraded to a Fuel I’ve found it almost impossible to overwhelm it. Annoyingly, too, as it means when I’m on the road and using my Macbook, I’m constantly frustrated by a gutless machine with a glitzy UI that gets in the way and slows things down.\n\nWith IRIX officially dead, the Open Source community is the only place any sort of IRIX-related development is happening. The crew over at Nekochan have developed Nekoware, an entire distribution of Open Source apps ported to IRIX, tuned and optimised for MIPS.\n\nMore power to the IRIX desktop, then. However, exciting changes are afoot, and it bodes well for older machines. Maybe it’s my UNIX background, but I don’t subscribe to the whole upgrade, upgrade, upgrade cycle that seems to define the PC industry. About 75% of all my work is done on kit that’s at over 5 years old. And I’m not talking scripting or coding, I’m talking web development, writing white papers and proposals, creating presentations, managing websites – all the baggage that goes along with running your own business.\n\nWhat does cloud computing mean to you? With Microsoft’s recent talk about Windows 7 and a cloud version of Office, along with Google Apps, what do you actually need to have a productive and up-to-date desktop system, that can share files and data with anyone?\n\nTurns out, it’s just a web browser. And what better platform to run a browser than the one used to serve out that first version of Netscape Navigator – IRIX.\n\nSo if you have an old Silicon Graphics machine – or you’ve got the chance to acquire one – grab the latest Nekoware release, and start playing with all those cool apps in the cloud. If we’re all going to have terminals again, well – they can be powerful and stylish ones.\n\nThe Nekochan community has been working hard porting the latest versions of popular and useful Open Source software to IRIX. They’ve come up with a distribution called Nekoware, and this is an essential software collection to get the most from your Silicon Graphics machine.\n\nThe Nekoware builds require IRIX 6.5 and are well thought out and structured, with the dependencies all taken care of.\n\nYou can download them from http://www.nekochan.net/what-is-nekowar.html. Stop by the forums there and give them props for such fantastic work!\n\nSGI has a large range of free or evaluation software available for download. It can be found at http://www.sgi.com/software/\n\nSGI also ships CDs with pre-compiled freeware with new systems. These freeware packages are regularly updated, and are freely available for download. They are tardist files, and so can be downloaded and installed with just one click.\n\nThe URL for SGI’s freeware site is http://freeware.sgi.com\n\nOne word of warning – the freeware packages have been compiled with SGI’s compiler. This means if you’re using GCC, you may run into problems.\n\nFor example, if you have downloaded the perl freeware package, and then try and compile some perl modules using gcc, it will fail – perl will have been compiled using the SGI compiler, and will expect the same for the modules.\n\nIn these cases, you will need to remove the freeware packages, and compile the app from source.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that there is a bug in recent versions of GCC, which appears in IRIX 6.2 and early versions of 6.5. Any program compiled with GCC that uses IP (for example, Apache or OpenSSH) will show all remote IPs as being 255.255.255.255. This isn’t too helpful. At the moment, it seems that GCC 2.7.2 was the last version that didn’t have problems with IRIX 6.2 – I would recommend installing this as your compiler. Recent versions of GCC 3 play nicely with IRIX 6.5.\n\nSGI’s Software Products page can be found at http://www.sgi.com/software/ – it has links and details for SGI’s commercial software.\n\nBlender is an excellent freeware 3D modelling software package. It is also available commercially. The URL for the homepage is http://www.blender.org/\n\nDouglas Scott has an excellent page of Audio and Music applications for SGI systems, originally at http://reality.sgi.com/dscott/audio.apps/\n\nI’ve setup a local mirror.\n\nBill Henderson maintains a page of links to all sorts of Public Domain software, originally at http://reality.sgi.com/billh/anonftp/\n\nPlease email me if you know where a copy of this now lives.\n\nGreg Lukomski maintains the excellent Unofficial Lightwave SGI Resource Guide at http://www.matchmove.com/sgi/sgi.html\n\nSiliconBunny’s local mirrors have copies of some of the more popular software available – notably the various versions of Quake.\n\nWhen you’ve had enough in the office, or need a bit of light entertainment at home, have some fun with these:\n\nQuake and Quake II for IRIX used to be found at http://www.sgi.com/fun/freeware/games.html\n\nFor those of us with slightly older machines, SGI Doom is also available at ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/doom/sgi/sgixdoom1.8.tar.gz\n\nOr, SGI have made it available from the same URL where Quake and Quake 2 can be found.\n\nAlso check the local mirrors.\n\nUpdated versions of BZFlag, which should come with IRIX 6.x, are available at the BZFlag home page – http://www.bzflag.org\n\nLinks to more games can be found on the Serious Fun section of SGI’s web site, at http://www.sgi.com/fun/freeware/games.html\n\nUsually, the ladder of academic education diploma will not usually needs of services on the same essay writing services.
