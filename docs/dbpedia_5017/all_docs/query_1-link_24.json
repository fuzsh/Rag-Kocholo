        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., and REDMOND, Wash., Dec. 8, 1997 — Microsoft Corp. and Silicon Graphics Inc. (NYSE:SGI) today jointly announced plans to deliver a new 3-D Graphics Device Driver Kit (DDK) for the Microsoft® Windows® operating system. The new DDK will provide graphics chip vendors and OEMs with an easier, more accessible method for creating, certifying and distributing 3-D graphics drivers based on Silicon Graphics® OpenGL® graphics technology for Windows 95, the Windows NT® operating system 4.0 as well as the forthcoming Windows 98 and Windows NT 5.0 operating systems.\n\nOpenGL, a 2-D and 3-D graphics visualization technology created by Silicon Graphics, is an open standard that is governed by an eight-company Architecture Review Board (ARB) of which Microsoft, Silicon Graphics and other leading vendors like Intel Corp. are members.\n\n“Microsoft’s support of OpenGL acceleration on all 32-bit Windows platforms is a very important development for both the hardware and software development community,” said Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Associates of Tiburon, Calif., and one of the industry’s leading 3-D graphics analysts. “By collaborating with Silicon Graphics to encourage high-quality acceleration and consistent deployment of this API, Microsoft is sending a clear signal that it is serious about Windows as a platform for professional 3-D graphics, which is a winning strategy for Microsoft, Silicon Graphics and all developers for Windows.”\n\n“Microsoft is very excited to be working with Silicon Graphics,” said Kevin Dallas, group product manager for graphics and multimedia at Microsoft. “This is an initiative that will provide enhanced support for OpenGL professional 3-D applications to Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT. This also reiterates our commitment to OpenGL as the API for professional applications like CAD and to Direct3D® for consumer applications like games.”\n\n“Silicon Graphics continues its drive to build the widest possible market for professional-class applications using OpenGL,” said Shawn Hopwood, senior manager of the graphics API group at Silicon Graphics. “OpenGL is a vital technology for developers providing high-performance, platform-independent 3-D solutions. We are very pleased to be working with Microsoft to enhance the OpenGL presence on the Windows platform.”\n\nTo enable the wide adoption and support of the OpenGL API on the Windows platform, Microsoft will offer chip and graphics hardware developers a direct source for OpenGL DDKs. The new DDK will enable the seamless acceleration of applications based on the OpenGL API on Windows 9X and Windows NT.\n\nAs part of the DDK, Microsoft will do the following for developers:\n\nDistribute a new, high-performance OpenGL Installable Client Driver (ICD) developed in cooperation with Silicon Graphics for the Windows 9X and Windows NT environments.\n\nDistribute a version of the existing Direct3D API DDK, which can also be found in the DirectX® set of APIs DDK.\n\nImplement a new certification testing and logo branding program for OpenGL drivers as well as Direct3D drivers created with the DDK through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs. Upon final certification from Microsoft, developers will receive one of the following three branded logos for use with their drivers:\n\n– Designed for Workstation – Windows NT 4.0 certified\n\n– Designed for Windows NT – Windows NT 5.0 certified\n\n– Designed for Windows – Windows 9X and Windows NT 5.0 certified\n\nDDK Availability and Developer Information\n\nThe new 3-D Graphics DDK for Windows is expected in the spring of 1998 with distribution from Microsoft and joint development and support from Silicon Graphics and Microsoft. For more information on a 3-D Graphics DDK license, developers should e-mail [email protected] with the subject line “3-D Graphics DDK Licenses.” For more information on OpenGL support on Windows, developers should e-mail [email protected]. The OpenGL Architecture Review Board may be found at (http://www.opengl.org/) .\n\nCompany Information\n\nSilicon Graphics Inc. is a leading supplier of high-performance interactive computing systems.
