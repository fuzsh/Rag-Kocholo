        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nBorn Dec. 18, 1943, the Rolling Stones’ founding member, co-principal songwriter, and guitarist Keith Richards is 80 today. Alongside Mick Jagger, a friend he first met in primary school, Richards has been the architect of one of rock ‘n’ roll’s signature groups for the past six decades. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, and is frequently named among the best guitarists of all time. He reportedly owns more than 3,000 guitars, and often plays Fender Telecasters and Gibson Les Pauls. He nicknamed a frequently used 1953 butterscotch Telecaster “Micawber” after a character in Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield. This is the guitar he commonly uses to perform “Honky Tonk Women.” As a songwriting team, Richards and Jagger are responsible for eight No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, and the Rolling Stones have sold more than 200 million records worldwide.\n\nAlso, in:\n\n1961 - The Tokens started a three-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\". It was adapted and covered internationally by many 1950s pop and folk revival artists, including the Weavers, Jimmy Dorsey, Yma Sumac, Miriam Makeba and the Kingston Trio. It went on to earn at least $15 million in royalties from cover versions and film licensing. REM included a live version of the song on the 1993 Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight single.\n\n1971 - Sly and the Family Stone went to No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with \"There's A Riot Goin' On\".\n\n1972 - The Ringo Starr-directed T. Rex documentary Born to Boogie premiered at Oscar's Cinema in Brewer Street, Soho (U.K.). In attendance are Starr, the members of T. Rex, and Elton John.\n\n1982 - Hall and Oates started a four-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Maneater\", the duo's 5th U.S. No. 1.\n\n1993 - Take That had their third U.K. No. 1 single with the Gary Barlow penned song \"Babe\".\n\n2003 - James Brown and country music star Loretta Lynn were honored for their contributions to U.S. culture. The pair were invited to a gala attended by President George Bush at the Kennedy Arts Center in Washington.\n\n2004 - A guitar played by George Harrison and John Lennon sold for $570,000 at an auction in New York. The Gibson SG guitar was used by Harrison from 1966 to 1969, including the recording of Revolver, and by Lennon during The White Album sessions. Other items sold in the Christie's auction included a letter by Kurt Cobain ($19,400), and a school book report by Britney Spears ($1,200).\n\n2011 - Ralph MacDonald, percussionist and songwriter who composed the hit duets \"Where Is the Love\" (Roberta Flack/Donny Hathaway) and \"Just The Two Of Us\" (Bill Withers/Grover Washington Jr.), died of lung cancer at age 67.\n\n2014 - Larry Henley (lead singer of the '60s pop group The Newbeats) died at age 77 after suffering with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. He co-wrote the 1989 hit \"The Wind Beneath My Wings.\"\n\nBirthdays:\n\nThe Animals bassist Chas Chandler was born today in 1938.\n\nElliot Easton of The Cars is 70.\n\nDMX was born today in 1970.\n\nSia is 48.\n\nChristina Aguilera is 43.\n\nBillie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (best known as Billie Eilish) was born on this day in 2001, making her 22 today. Both her debut studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, and her 2021 album, Happier Than Ever, hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200. She has already won seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, three MTV Video Music Awards, and three Brit Awards. Her single “What Was I Made For?” is featured on Barbie the Album."
