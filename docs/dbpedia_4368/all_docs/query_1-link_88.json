        "text": "Born in Seattle, he was well known for playing for various backing-bands in New York thatbacked up acts such as Little Richard and the Isley Brothers. He then moved to Englandin 1966 after being discovered by bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals, who went on tobecome his first manager. He then went on to form The Jimi Hendrix Experience, comprised of bassist Noel Redding, and drummer Mitch Mitchell. The three-piece released threealbums, Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland which have allgone on to be influential albums.\n\nUpon the first listen, it was evident that most of the music felt unfinished. Which in some ways works as an advantage, because it allows the listener to really get a sense of how great Hendrix’s guitar playing really was. With some tracks feeling like they had unfinished lyrics, much of the album feels like a jam session, full of psychedelic blues. To me, blues have always been the kind of music one could play while driving on the highway in a vintage muscle car, where psychedelic rock was what you could throw on a turntable and vibe with in a chill environment. With this album, you can do both. Hendrix was famous for his renditions of well-known blues numbers, and some his own as well. Tracks such as Mannish Boy, Lover Man, and Hear My Train a Comin' exemplify Hendrix’s prowess as a master bluesman. Hendrix’s psychedelicside/originality shows up on tracks like Send My Love to Linda, Cherokee Mist, and Sweet Angel. The album does have its pitfalls however. Three of the songs on the album are not sung by Hendrix. Two of the three Woodstock and $20 Fine for example are sung well known songwriter Stephen Stills. Along with Georgia Blues, these songs feel out of place with the rest of the album."
