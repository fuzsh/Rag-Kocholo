        "text": "Castles, Castles, Castles\n\nThere are castles galore to be seen between Newcastle and Durham. Two are Lambton Castle and Hylton Castle.\n\nHylton Castle is the older, built as a residence for Sir William Hylton around 1400. The impressive gatehouse tower is the only original part of the castle still standing. The property was sold and rebuilt after the last Hylton died in the mid-18th century. The front tower entrance displays royal and family heraldry, including Richard II's person emblem, the white hart badge.\n\nMajor General John Lambton (1710-1794) wanted his new home placed on the site of Harraton Hall on the north side of the River Wear. However, it was his son and grandson who carried out the vision. Italian architect Joseph Bonomi began the neo-classical design and, again, it was a son who completed the work, adding many Gothic features.\n\nVisit website\n\nAlnwick Garden and The Treehouse\n\nAdjacent to Alnwick Castle, behind brickwork and a Venetian gate dating back to the 18th century, was a 12-acre walled garden used in modern times as a tree nursery by Englandâ€™s Forestry Department. In 1996, Jane 12th Duchess of Northumberland broached her vision for a four-season garden. Alnwick Garden is now a realm unto itself with adventures for the young and young-at heart, and features food pavilions, a cherry orchard, a bamboo labyrinth and more.\n\nPossibly most unusual in the garden is The Treehouse, a magical dining experience with wooden walkways and twinkling lights set between trees on pilings. The menu features regional specialties, including local seafood and meats from Northumberland farms.\n\nVisit website"
