        "text": "Jimi Hendrix\n\nBorn: Nov. 27, 1942, Seattle, Wash.\n\nFirst job: Enlisted in the United States Army in 1961 but was discharged after getting injured in a parachute jump; in mid-1960s, played backup for Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Little Richard and others.\n\nEarly hits: “Hey Joe,” which reached No. 6 on the British charts in 1967.\n\nWhy he moved to London: Brought to England in 1966 by Chas Chandler of the Animals, who helped create the Jimi Hendrix Experience, which teamed Hendrix with the British musicians Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell. Built his reputation in London clubs.\n\nLived on Brook Street: At No. 23 from June 1968 until March 1969 (with touring in between).\n\nGreatest hits: The albums “Axis: Bold as Love” (No. 3 in the United States in 1968) and “Electric Ladyland” (No. 1 in 1968); performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Woodstock in 1969.\n\nDeath: Inhalation of vomit following barbiturate intoxication, Sept. 18, 1970, at age 27 in London.\n\nMusical legacy: Widely acknowledged as the greatest rock guitarist ever. The influence of his theatrical live shows, searing guitar solos, and blending of jazz, rock and blues can be seen in Prince as well as in generations of air guitarists.\n\nFun fact: Hendrix was a left-hander who played a right-handed Fender Stratocaster guitar upside down.\n\nGeorge Frederick Handel\n\nBorn: Halle, in what is now Germany, Feb. 23, 1685.\n\nFirst job: Organist at Halle Cathedral at age 17.\n\nEarly hits: Numerous cantatas, both sacred and secular, and the operas “Agrippina” (1709) and “Rinaldo” (1711).\n\nPersonal style: Bewigged and powdered. He was often referred to as old-fashioned, and his clothes were identifiably Germanic.\n\nIndulgences: Claret wine and hot chocolate: Handel was said to tend toward “healthy corpulence.”\n\nDeath: In failing health and blind, at home on Brook Street at age 74.\n\nMusical legacy: Largely responsible for the popularity of the oratorio; influence can be seen in Mozart and Haydn. Reassessment in 20th century of his operas found a master of technique and command of many musical styles.\n\nFun fact: In 1704, Handel fought a duel with Johann Mattheson, a singer, composer (and later, critic), after a quarrel over the continuo part in one of Mattheson’s operas."
