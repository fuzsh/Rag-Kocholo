        "text": "QS Best Student Cities ranking: 39th\n\nNewcastle (or Newcastle-upon-Tyne), the largest city in north-east England is diverse, vibrant and welcoming.\n\nThree universities featured in the QS World University Rankings® 2025 are located in or close to Newcastle. These include the nearby Durham University – about a half hour drive away – which is ranked joint 89th in the world and is a member of the prestigious Russell Group (an association of leading research universities).\n\nRight in the heart of Newcastle city centre, and in close proximity to one another, are Newcastle University and Northumbria University at Newcastle – both of which also feature in the world university rankings.\n\nNewcastle is home to three top universities featuring in the QS World University Rankings this year. Of these, Durham University performs the best, ranking joint 89th in the world. Newcastle earns its highest score for student mix, where it ranks 27th globally.\n\nNumber of universities ranked by QS\n\n3\n\nHighest-ranked institution\n\nDurham University (=89th)\n\nPopulation\n\n829,000\n\nAverage international fees (at ranked unis)\n\nUS$200\n\nDesirability rank\n\n58th\n\nEmployer Activity rank\n\n83rd\n\nAffordability rank\n\n92nd\n\nStudent View rank\n\n25th\n\nTo find out how each of the above categories is calculated, view the methodology.\n\nAffordable living cost\n\nThe city ranks 83rd for affordability this year, due to an inexpensive cost of living compared to other UK cities.\n\nInteresting history\n\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne has a fascinating history dating back to the Roman period, which you can learn more about in its many museums.\n\nDesirable city\n\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne ranks 70th globally in the desirability indicator; reflecting its high standard of living.\n\nNewcastle ranks 83rd for affordability this year. As with most English cities, tuition fees are expensive for international students, costing approximately US$24,000.\n\nHowever, living costs are a lot cheaper than other English cities. Numbeo estimates that a single person's monthly costs will be around £600 plus an additional £655 for rent on a one bedroom apartment in the city centre - 65 percent lower than London.\n\nNamed after the Norman castle of the city centre, the city’s history spans from the Roman period to its time as an important industrial centre for coal mining, engineering and shipping during the 19th century. Newcastle’s aptitude for engineering continues to this day, with award-winning structures such as the Gateshead Millennium Bridge.\n\nThe thriving cultural hub of the Quayside (the banks of the River Tyne) is home to many restaurants, bars, night clubs and public spaces, combining the best of the city and nearby town Gateshead.\n\nThe city also annually hosts the world's largest half marathon, the Great North Run. Residents from Newcastle and the surrounding area are dubbed ‘Geordies’, as is the distinctive local dialect, which is the closest language to 1,500-year-old Anglo-Saxon left in England.\n\nNewcastle achieves a very high score (27th) in the student mix indicator of the QS Best Student Cities ranking, thanks to its large student population and high percentage of international enrolments, making for a multicultural student experience."
