Itâ€™s an invigorating panorama that also includes the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art and the Sage, a landmark live music venue for the North East bringing world class artists to the region: powerful reminders of the people we serve.\n\nOur team are community-focused in all we do, raising money for organisations like RedR and WaterAid.\n\nWe were awarded the Order of Distinction (20 consecutive Golds) in the internationally-renowned Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), the longest-running industry awards scheme in the UK.\n\nWe also achieved an International Safety Award with Distinction from the British Safety Council in recognition of our continued commitment to providing and maintaining a safe, healthy and secure workplace for all our people."
