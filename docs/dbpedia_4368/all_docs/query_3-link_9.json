        "text": "Alternatively, one could argue that Chas rescued Hendrix from the treadmill he was on, playing in the same old groups and continually getting kicked out of them for being too \"flashy\". Transplanted to England where there were very few cultural assumptions about what he \"should\" be doing, Hendrix was able to become famous. It's hard to argue that Hendrix would have become famous if he hadn't left the US in 1966, given the tenor of the times, but it's not impossible that he would have.\n\nIt was only on the back of that initial fame that Hendrix was able to leverage his influence as a guitar player; for example, had he not been as well-known and heard as he was, I doubt seriously whether he would have booked sessions with Gil Evans (sessions that sadly never eventuated), or have been taken seriously by figures such as Miles Davis.\n\nHad he become famous in a different way, it's not hard to see that his output would have been radically different.\n\nThat's NOT true. Like it or not, but Chandler stimulated Hendrix in every possible way to become the incredible artist we all know and love.\n\nBesides, Chas took enourmous financial risks to get Hendrix to the top, all from his own wallet, with no reserves whatsoever.\n\nAnd it was thanks to his continuing belief and enthousiasm that Hendrix got the self confidence he needed to make his talent be known.\n\nKeep in mind, Hendrix wanted the soul standard \"Land of a 1000 dances\" to be the B-side of Hey Joe, but Chandler sent him of to write his first own song for the experience: the classic Stone free.\n\nHe deserves full credit for his achievement.\n\nWithout him, No jimi Hendrix as we knew/know him.\n\nAbsolute agreement. No question.\n\nEven with the talent, Hendrix may well have drifted into obscurity (or worse). Chas. Chandler was absolutely the essential ingredient to the success (and achievements) of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nAnyone who thinks otherwise is perhaps being a little too naive about talent and the music industry (then AND now).\n\nI have to side with those who give Chas most of the credit. Hendrix would've had the talent and some level of career without him, but I think it's pretty hard to argue that he would've been successful in America. Now someone else from England MIGHT've found him and taken him back there, but Jimi was just WAY too strange for American audiences. It was the massive UK success that convinced the US label to push him.\n\nAnd don't forget, Chas didn't merely put together the band, make smart decisions (like debuting out of the country), or force him to write (all of which he did, BTW). The main thing was, Chas had been a member of one of the most popular and successful acts in the UK - the Animals. And that gave him instant and personal access to the likes of the Beatles, Clapton, Townshend, Beck -- all personal friends of Chas' who was smart enough to be sure they all saw him even before the Experience was formed. So when there was a band and a record out, ALL the right people were already abuzz that this guy was the most incredible live performer around.\n\nSheer marketing genius.\n\nDon't forget, too, that Chas' next project was a bunch of also ran skinheads going under the unlike moniker of Ambrose Slade. Within mere months of being taken under Chas' wing they had hits, and went on to become one of the most successful and beloved singles bands of the '70s in the UK (scoring the first single to debut at #1 since the Beatles, who'd accomplished the feat 4 times).\n\nSo, no, give credit where credit was due. Chas was the right guy at the right place at the right time, and had a really unusual skillset himself that enabled him to turn Hendrix into an almost overnight superstar.\n\nMost people, regardless of their innate natural talent (or lack thereof) simply never in a million years will get that pure moment of luck that hooks them up with someone uniquely equipped to enable them to realize their full potential.\n\nThe Beatles would have made it without Brian, IMHO. Jimi might've stayed a session musician and amazing live performer with no real audience.\n\nJimi was a genius with undeniable talent that changed the face of rock guitar....BUT to give you an idea of how much credit Chas should have for making it all possible one just needs to listen to those PPX Curtis Knight recordings...the only thing worth listening to on them is the GREAT rhythm section on those recordings. Jimi's guitar playing is nerve-wracking at best on that stuff and his guitar tone sounds like he's playing out of a transistor radio...and it goes without saying that Curtis Knight had very little (if any) talent.\n\nThe sounds that Chas coaxed out of Jimi in those early sessions in England like with \"Purple Haze\" would never have been possible with Ed Chalpin and PPX. Jimi as a musician and Chas as his producer and friend was a chemistry that made the magic and confidence come out of Jimi even after Chas left as Jimi's producer. Because of Chas' faith and nurturing of Jimi, Hendrix was able to produce \"Electric Ladyland\" even though Chas wasn't working with him anymore....and saved the world from having to settle for just...oh...\"Simon Says\"?\n\nWell put. I agree too.\n\nI recently talked with a musician I've been acquainted with for years who mentioned that he knew Hendrix in his club days in NYC - played further down the bill in the same clubs. Everybody was impressed with Hendrix, but not exactly galvanized the way the London audiences were. I don't remember that Stone Free was the first song Jimi wrote, but his sets were dominated by \"cover\" versions, if not comprised of them completely. Chandler contributed a lot of vision; the inter-racial trio format, prodding him to write his own material, providing a sure hand in the producers chair, financial and business support and guidance... he gave it 110%.\n\nI agree that Hendrix could have easily floundered or become a footnote without that guidance. And I don't mean that to be derogitory in any way of the man's genius."
