        "text": "01 of 11\n\nParkour Through Newcastle's Ancient Ruins\n\nIn the heart of Newcastle, there’s an old castle—or, rather, a ‘Frankenstein’ castle. Since it was created in the 12th century, it has been built up and added to over the years and was refurbished as recently as 2015. To reach the castle keep, either cross the replica wooden bridge over the motte or brave the ghosts of invaders, who fell into the ditch below many years ago, and enter for a tour of the well-preserved interiors.\n\nBeyond the castle, Newcastle is peppered with old fortifications. Follow the tumbling Castle Steps, through the stone tunnel and jump off course towards the Castle Well, where you’ll find more crumbling fortifications shrouded by creeping ivy. From here, you can also discover a cool view of the bridges over the River Tyne.\n\n02 of 11\n\nEat at Blackfriars, the Oldest Dining Room in the U.K.\n\nAddress\n\nFriars Street, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4XN, UK\n\nPhone +44 191 261 5945\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nThe oldest part of Newcastle survives, and it’s even older than the old castle. In the middle of a peaceful courtyard, with the tips of old gravestones protruding through a blanket of soft grass, discover a crumbling medieval enclave, where locals and travelers have been dining since 1236.\n\nStep inside and watch the tall stone walls flicker by candlelight and feel the knights' armor around the room almost come to life.

People from Newcastle (Geordies) work hard and play hard. You can either let this mishmash of local, hardcore spirit combined with the excitement of tourists unfold before your eyes, or you can join in.\n\nIf you enjoy creative cocktails, like to dress to impress, and can dance the night away in 5-inch heels, you’ll feel at home in Floritas, Bijoux, and Revolution Bar.

Being 10 miles inland, Newcastle may appear to have its back to the sea, but its wide river has been arterial to its historic industrial success. In fact, the rail line you’re riding on is a living museum of this period. Originally built to supply the riverside industry, steam engines hauling miles of coal mined from the local area have now been replaced with light metros carrying passengers between the city and the coast.\n\nWhile aboard, use your imagination to visualize the riverscape once studded with hundreds of cranes, and imagine shipyard workers piling into pubs en mass for elevenses. At dawn, if you listen carefully, you might hear the shipyard’s horn echoing over the riverside towns. Haunting as it sounds, this portal to the past lives on.\n\nContinue to 9 of 11 below.\n\n09 of 11\n\nHunt for Treasure in Tynemouth Market\n\nAddress\n\nTynemouth, Station Terrace, Tynemouth, North Shields NE30 4RE, UK\n\nPhone +44 7907 468441\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nEvery Saturday and Sunday, Tynemouth metro station transforms into a huge flea market, where you can buy absolutely anything old and new: from antique furniture and vintage knitwear to delicate jewelry made from washed-up glass collected from the shores and watercolors of Newcastle’s rich history painted by the very artists manning the stalls.
