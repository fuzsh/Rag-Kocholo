        "text": "New trailer for the upcoming Constantine tv series, and this time we briefly see one of the show’s future recurring characters, Chas Chandler, portrayed by Charles Halford. Chas will be John Constantine‘s best (and longest living) friend, who accompanies him in his anti-demon crusade with a yellow cab. Chas already appeared in the Constantine movie, in a much younger version and with his name slightly changed to Chas Kramer, portrayed by Shia LaBeouf. Young Chas helps Constantine in his quest against the demon Mammon, but he’s ultimately killed by the rogue angel Gabriel, and, oddly enough, he becomes an angel himself. Hopefully, the new version will be closer to the comics’ source: let’s see together who the real, non-angel Chas is.\n\nFrank William Chandler was born in London, and lived in a small apartment with his parents and his brother. His family life soon became quite a mess: his brother got hanged, while his obese and cruel mother, Queenie, killed his father, and committed herself to ruin her remaining son’s life (it’s possible that her influence was the trigger to the other Chandler’s fate). To make things worse, Queenie became an amateur witch, and also got a familiar, a naughty female chimpanzee named Slag. Since Queenie’s soul was bonded to the one of her familiar, the monkey started taking a wicked pleasure in making Frank’s life a living hell as well, alienating the boy from his friends, and making it impossible for him to have something like a love life thanks to the awful body odor the chimp used on him. The only friend that didn’t flee from Frank and his obnoxious mother was John Constantine, who just moved to London and lived with Frank, who he had nicknamed “Chas” after Jimi Hendrix‘s producer. After hearing his friend’s story, and witnessing in first person the meaningless cruelty of his mother and her chimp, John, who was a sorcerer in his own right, resolved to help his friend… in quite a definitive way. Constantine used the human part of the monkey’s soul to trick her and to make her believe he loved her, and lured her near the docks, where he drowned her; since Queenie and Slag were bonded, by killing the monkey John had actually killed Chas’ mother as well, a debt of gratitude that would have linked Chas to Constantine for all his life.\n\nFinally free from his mother’s influence, Chas left his house and followed John in his new adventure, the post-punk band Mucous Membrane. The band moved from town to town, until a supernatural incident involving a little girl almost drove them all mad, with Constantine actually ending up in a mental asylum. Chas kept being close to John even during his internment, but in the meanwhile he made a life for himself. He married a girl named Renee, who strongly disliked her husband’s best friend. Usually, everytime Chas and Renee had an argument, it was about John and his “bad influence” over Chas. The two eventually had a daughter, Geraldine, who got pregnant at only sixteen years old and had a daughter on her own, Trish. Again, Chas had a difficult family life, but this time it was a normal kind of “difficult” at least. When Constantine came out of the asylum, Chas’ life became everything but “normal”. Chas had become a taxi driver, and when his best friend became some sort of detective of the occult, he started serving as his chauffeur; he also acted as the muscles to Constantine’s brains, and put his street-fighting at use more than once during his adventures with John. Despite being quite a reliable ally, Chas had been kept at a distance by John, who wanted to avoid his friend to get involved with the darker aspects of his “job”, something that upset Chas quite a lot… until he found himself alone, to face the ancient demon Tuma’el with only The Knowledge (the pattern of London’s streets every cab driver have to know) at his disposal to stop him. After his first, successful exorcism, Chas started to appreciate when Constantine kept him unaware of demonic threats…"
