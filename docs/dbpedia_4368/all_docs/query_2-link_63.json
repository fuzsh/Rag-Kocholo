        "text": "Solar PV Analysis of Newcastle Upon Tyne\n\nList of Solar PV Installers for Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n\nSituated in the United Kingdom, Newcastle upon Tyne is a favourable location for harnessing solar energy. The city's average daily solar energy production per kilowatt of installed capacity varies with the seasons: 4.99 kWh in Summer, 1.94 kWh in Autumn, 0.86 kWh in Winter and 4.28 kWh in Spring.\n\nThe higher productivity during Summer and Spring can be attributed to longer daylight hours and more intense sunlight compared to Autumn and Winter months where shorter days and less sunlight prevail due to the city's position within the Northern Temperate Zone.\n\nHowever, local weather conditions such as strong winds or heavy rainfalls may pose challenges to solar power generation at this location occasionally. These elements can interfere with the direct incidence of sun rays on panels or potentially damage them over time.\n\nTo optimize solar energy yield year-round despite these factors, it is recommended that panels are installed at an angle of approximately 46 degrees facing South for fixed installations - this allows for maximum exposure to sunlight throughout different times of day and season variations.\n\nPreventative measures against environmental factors could include robust mounting systems that can withstand high winds, as well as regular maintenance checks for potential panel damage caused by severe weather conditions such as hailstorms or heavy snowfall. Furthermore, integrating a drainage system around the installation area could prevent water accumulation which might otherwise affect panel efficiency.\n\nOverall though Newcastle upon Tyne provides a suitable environment for consistent year-round solar power generation given its climatic conditions combined with strategic installation practices.\n\nNote: The Northern Temperate Zone extends from 35° latitude North up to 66.5° latitude.\n\nSo far, we have conducted calculations to evaluate the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in 399 locations across United Kingdom. This analysis provides insights into each city/location's potential for harnessing solar energy through PV installations.\n\nLink: Solar PV potential in United Kingdom by location\n\nSolar output per kW of installed solar PV by season in Newcastle Upon Tyne\n\nSeasonal solar PV output for Latitude: 54.9742, Longitude: -1.615 (Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom), based on our analysis of 8760 hourly intervals of solar and meteorological data (one whole year) retrieved for that set of coordinates/location from NASA POWER (The Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources) API:\n\n&nbsp\n\nIdeally tilt fixed solar panels 46° South in Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n\nTo maximize your solar PV system's energy output in Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom (Lat/Long 54.9742, -1.615) throughout the year, you should tilt your panels at an angle of 46° South for fixed panel installations.\n\nAs the Earth revolves around the Sun each year, the maximum angle of elevation of the Sun varies by +/- 23.45 degrees from its equinox elevation angle for a particular latitude. Finding the exact optimal angle to maximise solar PV production throughout the year can be challenging, but with careful consideration of historical solar energy and meteorological data for a certain location, it can be done precisely.\n\nWe use our own calculation, which incorporates NASA solar and meteorological data for the exact Lat/Long coordinates, to determine the ideal tilt angle of a solar panel that will yield maximum annual solar output. We calculate the optimal angle for each day of the year, taking into account its contribution to the yearly total PV potential at that specific location.\n\nAt Latitude: 54.9742, Longitude: -1.615, the ideal angle to tilt panels is 46° South\n\nSeasonally adjusted solar panel tilt angles for Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n\nIf you can adjust the tilt angle of your solar PV panels, please refer to the seasonal tilt angles below for optimal solar energy production in Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom. As mentioned earlier, for fixed-panel solar PV installations, it is optimal to maintain a 46° South tilt angle throughout the year.\n\nOverall Best Summer Angle Overall Best Autumn Angle Overall Best Winter Angle Overall Best Spring Angle 38° South in Summer 58° South in Autumn 68° South in Winter 47° South in Spring\n\nAssuming you can modify the tilt angle of your solar PV panels throughout the year, you can optimize your solar generation in Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom as follows: In Summer, set the angle of your panels to 38° facing South. In Autumn, tilt panels to 58° facing South for maximum generation. During Winter, adjust your solar panels to a 68° angle towards the South for optimal energy production. Lastly, in Spring, position your panels at a 47° angle facing South to capture the most solar energy in Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.\n\nOur recommendations take into account more than just latitude and Earth's position in its elliptical orbit around the Sun. We also incorporate historical solar and meteorological data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) API to assign a weight to each ideal angle for each day based on its historical contribution to overall solar PV potential during a specific season.\n\nThis approach allows us to provide much more accurate recommendations than relying solely on latitude, as it considers unique weather conditions in different locations sharing the same latitude worldwide.\n\nCalculate solar panel row spacing in Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n\nWe've added a feature to calculate minimum solar panel row spacing by location. Enter your panel size and orientation below to get the minimum spacing in Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom.\n\nOur calculation method\n\nSolar Position:\n\nWe determine the Sun's position on the Winter solstice using the location's latitude and solar declination.\n\nShadow Projection:\n\nWe calculate the shadow length cast by panels using trigonometry, considering panel tilt and the Sun's elevation angle.\n\nMinimum Spacing:\n\nWe add the shadow length to the horizontal space occupied by tilted panels.\n\nThis approach ensures maximum space efficiency while avoiding shading during critical times, as the Winter solstice represents the worst-case scenario for shadow length.\n\nPlease enter information above to calculate panel spacing.\n\nTopography for solar PV around Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom\n\nThe topography around Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom is generally flat and low-lying. The area around the city is mostly made up of rolling hills and farmland. This makes it ideal for large scale solar PV installations as there are no significant obstructions to block or interfere with the sunlight. Areas that would be most suited to such installations would include open fields, farmlands, and rooftops that have unobstructed access to sunlight throughout the day.\n\nUnited Kingdom solar PV Stats as a country\n\nUnited Kingdom ranks 14th in the world for cumulative solar PV capacity, with 13,689 total MW's of solar PV installed. This means that 4.00% of United Kingdom's total energy as a country comes from solar PV (that's 20th in the world). Each year United Kingdom is generating 203 Watts from solar PV per capita (United Kingdom ranks 25th in the world for solar PV Watts generated per capita). [source]\n\nAre there incentives for businesses to install solar in United Kingdom?\n\nYes, there are several incentives for businesses wanting to install solar energy in the United Kingdom. The UK government offers a Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme which pays businesses for every unit of electricity they generate from their solar panels. Additionally, businesses may be eligible for tax reliefs such as Enhanced Capital Allowances and Renewable Heat Incentives. Finally, some local authorities offer grants or other financial support to help businesses with the cost of installing solar energy systems.\n\nDo you have more up to date information than this on incentives towards solar PV projects in United Kingdom?
