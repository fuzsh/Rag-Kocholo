        "text": "Bryana ''Chasie'' Chandler (most known as Dark Chasie) is the female version of Dark Chas and is a member of The Dark Angels. She is the tallest, oldest and strongest member of The Dark Angels as well as Dark Chas's female counterpart.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nChasie has brown hair. She has green eyes, a nose and her skin is white. She wears a black outfit, with a black coat, a red blouse with the shape of a white star, a black skirt, her necklace is a purple cross (just like Dark Chas), a pink scrunch in her pigtailed hair and her bracelets are dark red and black.\n\nShe currently wears the same cord, jacket and blouse identical to Dark Chas, however she wears a feminine bracelet, black skirt and black and dark red sandals. She also happens to wear a dark red hair in her hair, like Dark Chas and she wears a pink and gray hair clip.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDark Chasie is the female version of Dark Chas and she represents feelings that Dark Chas would never or rarely have, which is love. She is the tallest and strongest of the Dark Angels, but this has never stopped her from achieving her goal which is to win the love of Dark Chas. She and her friends commit robbery and theft, as they are not as dangerous as the Dark Animals.\n\nShe is in love with Dark Chas and finds him extremely handsome, with the typical personality of a bully, bad boy just the way she wants. However, her love is unrequited by her and even though she can't get his love, Chasie / Bryana just wants to gain her attention and be her friend / ally if she can't get him to harbor romantic feelings for her.\n\nShe doesn't like killing people, so she and her friends would rather steal and kidnap than kill, unlike Dark Chas who takes pleasure in killing.\n\nIn season six, she and her friends maintain their love and loyalty to the Dark Animals, the only difference being that they become more aggressive and more hostile than in the previous seasons they appeared (second and third).\n\nShe and her friends return in season seven (episode 94), where the Dark Animals have a temporary (more true) crush on Chasie and her friends.\n\nEven though Dark Chas doesn't love her, Chasie still does favors to please her boss, being as loyal to him as her friends are to the other members of the Dark Animals.\n\nIt is also mentioned that in episode 94, Bryana and her friends are now willing to kill to please their bosses, which means that even though Bryana and the Dark Angels are villains, they have matured, although their insecurities are still present, but the insecurities of the girls compared to their previous appearances, now they are smaller, they are more mature, probably during all this time of not seeing their ''favorite males'' (The Dark Animals).\n\nInitially in the Valentine vs The Dark Animals special, she had possibly ''redeemed'' herself for her actions, but in episode 149, she returns to her evil and cruel ways, by murdering a mysterious girl along with her friends.\n\nBryana's cruelty in killing was so great that it impressed Bryan who was satisfied with her performance, when she became a murderer, Bryana in turn was very happy to see that Bryan ''liked'' her becoming a murderer.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHer birthday is March 18, 1940.\n\nShe reveals herself to be a witch along with her friends in episode 32.\n\nShe was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, England, just like all The Dark Angels and the same place where was born her male counterpart, Dark Chas.\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]"
