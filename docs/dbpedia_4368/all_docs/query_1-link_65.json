        "text": "Happy 44th Anniversary!!..The Soundhouse Tapes is The Debut EP By Iron Maiden, and Features The Very First Recordings By The Band. Released in November 1979, it features three songs taken from the demo tape recorded at Spaceward Studios on New Year's Eve 1978. The three tracks - \"Prowler\", \"Invasion\" and \"Iron Maiden\" - appear in a rougher form than they would on the first Iron Maiden album and subsequent singles as they were all recorded in one session. Although major retail chains tried to order large quantities of the record, the band only distributed 5,000 copies, available by mail order alone, which eventually sold out in just a few weeks. Because of this, the EP is now a valuable collectors item, which has been sold at up to £800 online. In the midst of punk rock's peak in the UK, Iron Maiden struggled to secure gigs out of the East End of London and decided that a demo would be an ideal way to try to remedy this.The band decided to record at Spaceward Studios, Cambridge after hearing a demo tape recorded there by former vocalist Dennis Wilcock's band, V1. Although this would be more expensive than recording in London, bassist Steve Harris comments, \"We decided that doing it on the cheap was a false economy. We knew we'd only probably get one go at it, and we wanted it to sound the best we could.\" To save money, the band booked a session on New Year's Eve 1978, which cost them £200, and recorded four songs, \"Prowler\", \"Invasion\", \"Strange World\" and \"Iron Maiden\". Harris states, \"We didn't know what to expect, going into the studio for the first time. We just hoped the engineer was gonna be good enough to record us, and that was it, really. We just went in there with a naïve attitude and, as it happens, it was pretty good. The songs were very together already. We didn't have to arrange much. They were very tight, 'cause we were doing them live all the time. We knew exactly what we needed to do. It was just a question of whether we could record it all in time. But we went in and the tracks went down really quick. I think we did most of them in the first take.\" A short time later, Harris and Murray presented a copy of the tape to a DJ named Neal Kay, then running a heavy metal club in Kingsbury, North West London called the Bandwagon Soundhouse. Impressed with the demo, Kay began playing the tape heavily and eventually \"Prowler\" reached No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published in Sounds magazine.The demo tape also reached Rod Smallwood, who would soon become the group's manager and help them acquire their record deal with EMI in December 1979. In late 1979, while waiting to sign their deal with EMI, the band decided to release the demo on their own label, Rock Hard Records, on 9 November 1979. Entitled The Soundhouse Tapes after Kay's club Iron Maiden Paul Di'Anno - vocals Dave Murray - guitar Paul Cairns - guitar Steve Harris - bass guitar Doug Sampson - Drums. Recorded 31 December 1978 at Spaceward Studios, Cambridge.\n\nALBUM ANNOUNCEMENT They say the only thing constant is change, and after some 15 years of music-making with their original lineup, change finally came last year for Balsam Range. Now, with the upcoming release of Kinetic Tone — available for pre-save/add/order ahead of its December 1 release — the group puts an exclamation point on their embrace of the new as they welcome mandolin virtuoso Alan Bibey. Yet beyond the refreshment of energy it embodies, the album reveals the band as more committed than ever to expressing a broad vision of life through compelling artistry. “When Balsam Range went into the studio at the beginning of 2023 to begin this album,” the album's liner notes recount, “it was immediately obvious to everybody present that something was different. A new level of excitement and joy of creating was present.” Indeed, that new quantum of energy was responsible for the project’s eventual title. “Kinetic Tone,” explain the notes, “is a not-so-well-known musical term defining how sounds move from being static to changing tone by the application of ENERGY. Could be a voice. Could be a guitar. Could be voices and instruments acting in concert. We would argue that it can also be a shared mindset of a musical group.” Here, that newly-invigorated mindset is embodied in a wide-ranging set of songs that could only have come from what the notes call Balsam Range 2.0. From the dramatic opening of the first song, Kinetic Tone separates itself from the ranks of the ordinary. Instead, it’s a collection of stories, portraits, and meditations that encompass adventure, lost love, aging and growth, faith, the urge to roam, and the changing ways of mountain and small-town life. And while there is a full measure of songs that feature the smooth, flowing grooves and burnished harmonies for which Balsam Range are renowned, there is a new emphasis on and a bit of a new edge to the hard drive of straight-ahead bluegrass in songs, too.

The collection is organized as an object that contains multiple albums which are also objects. Each album is represented in the collection with a unique id as the property name. Within each album object, there are various properties describing information about the album. Not all albums have complete information. The updateRecords function takes 4 arguments represented by the following function parameters: records - an object containing several individual albums id - a number representing a specific album in the records object prop - a string representing the name of the album’s property to update value - a string containing the information used to update the album’s property Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function. Your function must always return the entire records object. -> If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album. -> If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, assign the value to that album's prop. -> If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, you need to update the album's tracks array. First, if the album does not have a tracks property, assign it an empty array. Then add the value as the last item in the album's tracks array. Note: A copy of the recordCollection object is used for the tests. You should not directly modify the recordCollection object. // Setup const recordCollection = { 2548: { albumTitle: 'Slippery When Wet', artist: 'Bon Jovi', tracks: ['Let It Rock', 'You Give Love a Bad Name'] }, 2468: { albumTitle: '1999', artist: 'Prince', tracks: ['1999', 'Little Red Corvette'] }, 1245: { artist: 'Robert Palmer', tracks: [] }, 5439: { albumTitle: 'ABBA Gold' } }; // Only change code below this line function updateRecords(records, id, prop, value) { if (value === '') { delete records[id][prop]; } else if (prop !== 'tracks') { records[id][prop] = value; } else if (prop === 'tracks') { if (!records[id].hasOwnProperty('tracks')) { records[id]['tracks'] = []; } records[id]['tracks'].push(value); } return records; } updateRecords(recordCollection, 5439, 'artist', 'ABBA')\n\nHow are individual stocks like musical acts? While some acts may have one hit aka the one hit wonders few of them stand the test of time. While artists/bands like the Rolling Stones/Springsteen/U2 have stood the test of time there is XYZ band that ultimately disappeared! What's the point of all this? Just like it is hard for musical acts to survive and thrive the same is true for individual stocks. That's where diversification comes in handy. By investing in a broad index over time the one hit wonders get kicked to the curb. Plus there are now exchange traded funds (ETFs) that create the lens to which their underlying holdings are viewed such has dividend growth or capital appreciation to name a few! Over time holdings will be added or dropped i.e., perform or be cast out based on their lens! Don't forget one of the biggest bands in musical history The Beatles were rejected by all the record labels initially. The record companies couldn't identify musical talent. Are you sure you can identify which stocks will stand the test of time? Thursday tune \"Shooting Star\" by Bad Company https://lnkd.in/ewRa6v-A Happy Thursday!\n\n\"Silver Stockholm\" For Bass Clarinet, Cello and Harpsichord Bil Smith Composer 104\" X 10\" A Commission From Sage Group Commentary by Cormac McCarthy, American Novelist In the relentless pursuit of dismantling the traditional, of flinging wide the doors to rooms within rooms of musical architecture heretofore unexplored, comes this score, \"Silver Stockholm\" by composer Bil Smith. Yes, sprawling across a sheet of unprecedented proportions—104 inches by a mere 10, imagine, as though one were trying to read the horizon itself—and yet within this expanse lies not the familiar, not the comfort of the staves and clefs and black dots neatly arrayed like soldiers, no. Here lies chaos, or so it seems at first blush, a chaos meticulously planned and plotted along axes not of our making but of the composer's, a realm where the Moire, hyperplexic in its complexity, invites, no, demands a recusal from the linear, the sequential, the narrative of music as we know it. Consider, if you will, the audacity. The sheer, unmitigated gall of pushing notation from edge to edge, as though the very boundary of the page itself were but a mere suggestion, an inconvenience to be acknowledged and then promptly ignored. Within this frame, this canvas, the notes do not march; they cavort, they tangle in dense, wriggling fields, competing striations that defy the eye to follow without succumbing to vertigo. And yet, within this apparent anarchy, there is order, a discipline that speaks to a choreography of the mind so intricate, so private, that one might find oneself whispering of Cunningham, of Cage, those luminaries who too sought to break free from the shackles of the expected, the conventional. And what of the performers, those brave souls called upon to navigate this maelic maelstrom? For them, the color, the hue of a note, a line, a smudge becomes a signifier, a beacon through the fog of complexity. These ridged, sinuous marks, they are not mere decoration but a language unto themselves, a notation that speaks of timbre and attack and decay as much as of pitch and rhythm. The performers, then, must become not just musicians but translators, interpreters of a script that acknowledges no master, that adheres to no orthodoxy. Yet, for all its defiance, its reveling in the joyous liberation from form, there remains the grid. Ah, the grid, that imposition of order upon the chaotic, the unruly. It does not rationalize; no, that would be too simple, too pedestrian. It serves rather as a reminder, a concession to the necessity of form, of structure, however tenuous, however fluid. It is both a cage and a key, a means of navigating the vast, uncharted territories that \"Silver Stockholm\" lays bare before us. - Cormac McCarthy, American Novelist https://lnkd.in/eJdiHZEH"
