The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:48 in room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. John Ashcroft (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators Ashcroft, Grams and Feingold. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ASHCROFT, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI Senator Ashcroft. The committee will now come to order. I want to thank all of you for your patience. We were winding up a vote on the Senate floor and would otherwise have been more prompt. I do not want to allege ever that the Senate is totally prompt, but we would have been more prompt, and I thank you very much. We welcome all of the witnesses today, both from the administration, the U.S. Congress, and from the private sector. Just as a way of orienting us this morning, we would like to begin this morning's hearing with a brief video presentation. The video will feature speeches by Hassan Turabi, the leader of the National Islamic Front Party in Sudan and one of the most infamous supporters of international terrorism in the world. Osama bin Laden's call for a jihad against the U.S., and particularly against U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia, will also be featured. Bin Laden was harbored by Sudan for almost 5 years, and was involved in attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, specifically in Riyadh and Dhahran. The video will close with some footage from the World Trade Center bombing, the most poignant reminder of the war international terrorists are committed to waging against the United States. If we could please--we will start the video and hope everyone has a chance to see it clearly from their position. [A videotape was shown.] Senator Ashcroft. In the post cold war world the United States no longer faces the threat of bipolar cataclysm that defined U.S.-Soviet relations. The collapse of the Soviet Union ended the greatest menace to freedom in the 20th century, but in this dawn of a new era in international relations, however, the horizon is dotted with new national security threats that will demand our constant vigilance. One of the most serious of these new national security threats is the rise of international terrorism. We are holding this hearing today in the Subcommittee on African Affairs to address the menace of terrorism as sponsored by the Government of Sudan. Since first being designated a State sponsor of terrorism in 1993, Sudan has risen quickly in the ranks of infamy to join Iran as the worst of State sponsors of terrorism. Sudan harbors elements of the most violent terrorist organizations in the world: Jihad, the armed Islamic group, Hamas, Abu Nidal, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hizbollah, and the Islamic Group are all present in terrorist training camps in Sudan. These terrorist groups are responsible for hundreds of terrorist attacks around the world that have taken thousands of lives. Abu Nidal alone has been responsible for 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries which have killed or injured almost 900 people. Jihad is responsible for the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and Jihad's leader, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, was the ideological ringleader of the terrorists that attacked the World Trade Center and plotted to bomb the United Nations in New York. Another terrorist organization, the Islamic Group, attacks westerners in Egypt, and claimed responsibility for the failed assassination attempt on President Hosni Mubarak during his visit to Ethiopia in 1995. In addition to harboring terrorist organizations, Sudan has given refuge to several of the most notorious individual terrorists, including Imad Moughniyeh and Osama Bin Laden. Moughniyeh is believed to be responsible for the 1983 bombing of the marine barracks in Beirut which killed 241 U.S. troops. Bin Laden is the most infamous financier of terrorists in the world, and has recently stated that U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia, as you saw in the video, will be the principal target of his terrorist attacks. Sudan is not simply a favorite vacation spot for terrorists. The Sudanese Government is an active supporter of these terrorist activities. Sudan reportedly provided weapons and travel documentation for the assassins who attacked President Mubarak. Two Sudanese diplomats at the United Nations in New York conspired to help Jihad terrorists gain access to the U.N. complex to bomb the building. The plot to bomb the U.N. was just one in a series of plots to bomb numerous locations around New York, including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the George Washington Bridge, and U.S. military installations. Five of the original 12 defendants convicted in the series of terrorist plots were Sudanese nationals. Thankfully, this series of plots was thwarted by U.S. authorities, but one of the earlier terrorist attacks, the World Trade Center bombing, killed six individuals, injured over 1,000 more, and caused $600 million in damages. The terrorists responsible for the World Trade Center bombing expressed regret that the twin towers were not toppled, a catastrophe that would have taken the lives of tens of thousands of people. In addition to supporting international terrorism, Sudan supports insurgencies against secular governments in northern Africa, and wages a war of domestic terror against its own people. Sudan supports extremist rebels and terrorist groups in Algeria, Uganda, Tunisia, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. The military regime of Omar al-Bashir has used genocide, mass starvation, and slavery to pillage southern Sudan. Mere children are drafted into Sudan's army to feed the flames of the Government's hatred. Southern rebel leaders are guilty of human rights atrocities as well, and the civil war has taken the lives of 1.5 million people and displaced over 2 million more in the last decade. The malevolent character of Sudan's government makes it patently clear why the U.S. has designated some nations as State sponsors of terrorism and has imposed upon them the most severe penalties and sanctions provided by U.S. law. While it may seem obvious to all of us here today that Sudan is deserving of our harshest censure, the Clinton administration has had to be pushed and pulled into adopting an aggressive stance against the terrorist State of Sudan. Only under congressional pressure did President Clinton add Sudan to the terrorist list in 1993, and now the Clinton administration is failing to enforce U.S. antiterrorism law against this terrorist State. The Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, passed by Congress and signed into law by the President last April, contained a provision, section 321, prohibiting financial transactions with State sponsors of terrorism. The Clinton administration was given the opportunity to issue regulations for section 321, and President Clinton blatantly disregarded the clear language of the legislation and permitted almost all financial transactions with some terrorist States to proceed. I do not understand this inconsistency in the President's antiterrorism policy. In a speech at George Washington University on August 5, 1996, just days before the regulations for section 321 were issued, the President stated, and I quote: The United States cannot and will not refuse to do what we believe is right. That is why we have maintained or strengthened sanctions against States that sponsor terrorism, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. You cannot do business with countries that practice commerce with you by day while funding or protecting the terrorists who kill you and your innocent civilians by night. That is wrong. The Congress of the United States has worked extensively in a bipartisan manner to provide the American people with the antiterrorism tools they need to defend themselves and isolate these rogue regimes, and I am amazed that we are having to revisit this antiterrorism legislation to force the President to cutoff financial transactions with State sponsors of terrorism. Representative Bill McCollum, the original sponsor of section 321, has introduced legislation in the House, H.R. 748, to close the administration's regulatory loophole. I plan to introduce companion legislation to H.R. 748 in the Senate. I am thankful that America has been relatively isolated from most of the world's terrorist violence, but just as terrorists have targeted Americans abroad, they are now targeting Americans at home. International terrorism is one of our greatest national security threats, and yet another example of a national security threat that the administration is failing to address. I want to thank the witnesses who will be testifying here today for their assistance, and I hope that this hearing will promote a frank and open discussion of the issues surrounding the enforcement of our antiterrorism law. I would call on the ranking minority member of the committee, Senator Feingold. STATEMENT OF HON. RUSSELL D. FEINGOLD, U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN Senator Feingold. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This is the first Africa Subcommittee hearing we are holding together, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with you and to continue into my fifth year of service on this subcommittee, which I consider to be an important part of the Foreign Relations Committee, and an important subcommittee in the Senate. As the chair notes, you and I share two subcommittee jurisdictions. He is also chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, of which I am also the ranking member, so I know we will be working together, having, in effect, quality time together in the Senate throughout the 105th Congress, and I look forward to it. Mr. Chairman, I also want to thank you for holding a hearing on the subject before us today, terrorism in the Sudan. This is a vitally important topic for two reasons. One, as the chairman has indicated, is terrorism itself, and the other is the Sudan. Terrorism is clearly one of the most vexing threats to our national security today. Terrorist groups, by seeking to destabilize or overthrow governments, serve to erode international stability. By its very nature, terrorism goes against everything we understand to be part of the international system, challenging us with methods we do not necessarily comprehend. People, and all too often they are innocent bystanders, die as a result of terrorism. Buildings are destroyed, and all of us feel less safe after the fact. According to the State Department's most recent Patterns of Global Terrorism report, although the number of international terrorist incidents in 1996 actually fell to 296, the lowest annual total in 25 years, the death toll from these acts rose from 163 in 1995 to 311 last year. Approximately one-fourth of these acts were aimed intentionally against the United States. In 1996, 24 U.S. citizens were killed as a result of terrorism, a number that unfortunately was twice as high as the previous year. So yes, indeed, this is a vitally important subject for the Congress to look at very carefully. Mr. Chairman, I would also like to note the tremendous importance, or at least the potential importance of the Sudan in Africa. It is the largest country on the continent, and has a population of 29 million people, with cultural and geographic ties to both Arab North Africa and to black Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sudan has the potential to play a significant role in East Africa and the Gulf region, but unfortunately during its 41 years of independence, Sudan has only seen about 11 years of peace. Instead, a brutal civil war between the largely Christian and animist south and the Muslim-Arab north continues to rage on. This seemingly endless conflict has taken the lives of more than 1.5 million and resulted in well over 2 million displaced persons or refugees. Perhaps the saddest consequence of the war is that there are thousands of teenagers who do not remember a peaceful period, and who know better the barrel of a gun than the inside of a classroom. The international community has done the best that it can with this situation. There are approximately 40 national and international humanitarian organizations providing millions of dollars annually in food and development assistance. For its part, the U.S. Government has provided more than $600 million in food assistance and nonfood disaster assistance since the mid-1980's. The United Nations' Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), which maintains a unique agreement with the parties to the conflict, has been instrumental in allowing humanitarian access to displaced persons in the southern Sudan. I want to just take a moment to commend the humanitarian organizations operating in the region, who daily face not only enormous technical and logistical challenges in serving the Sudanese population, but obviously the all-too-frequent threat of another offensive nearby. Unfortunately, throughout this conflict both sides have been engaged in all-too-frequent human rights violations. According to the most recent State Department human rights report, the Khartoum Government maintains not only regular police and army units but also internal and external security organs, a militia unit, and a parallel police called the Popular Police, whose mission includes enforcing ``proper'' social behavior. In 1996, according to the report, Government forces were responsible for extrajudicial killings, disappearance, forced labor, slavery, and forced conscription of children. Basic freedoms--of assembly, of association, of privacy--are routinely restricted by the Government. Worse, imposition of Islamic law on non-Muslims is far too common. Perhaps the Government's most egregious behavior, though, is its involvement in terrorism, as the Chairman has well pointed out. The State Department's 1996 Pattern of Global Terrorism report noted that Sudan continued to serve as a refuge, nexus, and training hub in 1995 for a number of international terrorism organizations. As the Chairman has already described, the Government continues to harbor members of several international terrorist and radical Islamic groups. Mr. Chairman, this is not a regime that should be included in the community of nations. As Assistant Secretary Moose will recall, I first became interested in this particular subject in May 1993, during an Africa Subcommittee hearing chaired by then chairman of the subcommittee Senator Paul Simon. During that hearing, I questioned Secretary Moose regarding Khartoum's relationship specifically with Hamas, an all-too- well-known terrorist organization. Since much of that information could not be disclosed in a public forum, I asked him to brief me on these connections in private, and I later encouraged the administration to take a hard line in its efforts to curtail Sudan's involvement and support for terrorist activity. Shortly thereafter, in August, the President placed Sudan on the official list of nations supporting terrorism, and I just have to say for myself, Mr. Chairman, that when I asked for the administration's response, it was not only adequate it was swift, and considering I was the least senior member of the entire committee, I was impressed that there was that kind of response, and I fully supported this decision, and of course continue to support Sudan's inclusion on the list. The United States should not tolerate repugnant acts by groups or governments, which is why, Mr. Chairman, the Congress mandated the so-called terrorist list in the first place. So again, I really do commend the Chairman for having a significant hearing on this subject, and I look forward to listening to the testimony. Senator Ashcroft. I want to welcome Senator Grams of Minnesota as a member of the committee as well, and thank him for being here. We are a bit under a time constraint as a result of the vote, which delayed our beginning, so I would like to call our first witness before the committee. Our first witness is United States Congressman Bill McCollum from the State of Florida. As I indicated in my opening remarks, he has proposed legislation which would provide a way to deal with State-sponsored terrorism and States that sponsor terrorism. He is the author of the measure which was contained in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. He serves in the House as chairman of both the Crime Subcommittee and the Intelligence Committee's Subcommittee on Human Intelligence Analysis and Counterintelligence, and it is a pleasure to welcome him to the committee. Congressman McCollum. STATEMENT OF HON. BILL McCOLLUM, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM FLORIDA Mr. McCollum. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is a great pleasure being here with you, and I commend you and Senator Feingold and Senator Grams for your effort in working with respect to this issue. I think it is extraordinarily important. With your permission, I would like to ask unanimous consent that my entire statement be put in the record. I would like to simply summarize so as to save you some time. Senator Ashcroft. It will be so ordered. Mr. McCollum. I have the privilege, as you have indicated, of serving as chairman of two key subcommittees that are relevant to this matter in the House, and prior to that I was the chairman of the Republican Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare. Everything you have described today-- through both the video and your statements--with regard to Sudan and the terrorist activities is true in spades. I became aware of these matters long ago, but frankly the issue of what was in section 321 of the antiterrorism bill was not something I really focused on until Louis Farakhan went over to the Middle East and came back with money from Libya and elsewhere, or it looked like he had a deal to do that. Some of us began looking into the rules and regulations regarding the financial transactions that could be done, and discovered that while there were some executive orders governing such transactions, they were not comprehensive. As a result, this provision was drafted. It was drafted with two purposes in mind, (1) prohibiting some American citizen from going abroad to obtain contributions, but more directly, prohibiting any foreign nation that is identified as a terrorist country--one of the seven that are out there, not just Sudan--from being able to, as the government of that country, contribute money. It would be wrong for us to take that money. And then the other way around. That is, financial transactions between both U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent resident aliens and the governments of those foreign countries were to be prohibited, and that is what section 321 was all about. Well, along the way the Treasury Department expressed its concern to me that the diplomatic relationships we might have could be strained. There were all kinds of possible exceptions, all kinds of problems that would be there. And since financial transactions are administered by the Treasury Department, albeit with some consultation with the Secretary of State, the decision was made, because of the complexity, or the potential complexity of this, to give them a broad basis for regulatory relief with the assumption that the Treasury Department would write some regulations that would specifically provide for diplomatic opportunities where the law would not be that harsh. Well, I want to tell you that what came out of the Treasury Department's regulations was very, very disappointing, and I am going to refer to my statement with regard to this. In August of last year, I learned that the Treasury Department had published these regulations. To my surprise, I discovered that the regulations reversed the effects of the prohibitions on the aforementioned financial transactions. These regulations permit all financial transactions with Sudan and Syria other than those which pose a risk of furthering domestic terrorism. I must say, so we understand it now, that we have economic restrictions against the other five countries officially in place but economic restrictions are not officially in place against the Sudan or Syria, even though this provision in the antiterrorism bill was designed to stop financial transactions with all terrorist list countries. So this issue became far more important, perhaps, because there were no other economic sanctions in place against these two terrorist States. At any rate, the regulations that the Treasury Department issued prohibit U.S. persons from receiving unlicensed donations and from engaging in financial transactions with respect to which the United States person knows, or has reasonable cause to believe that the financial transaction poses a risk of furthering terrorist acts in the United States. My cosponsor, Mr. Schumer, recently said that this is a loophole big enough to drive a car bomb through. The reality, Mr. Chairman, and I think I have got to make this very, very clear, was not my intention, nor was it that of Mr. Schumer nor anyone else connected with drafting these provisions in the antiterrorism bill, that the regulatory authority provided should be exercised in this manner. If I had known the administration was going to choose to render the prohibition meaningless, I would not have agreed to the broad authority that was placed there. This business-as- usual policy represents a step backward in the efforts to isolate terrorist States, particularly the terrorist activities in the Sudan and Syria. So, in my judgment, the regulations could also permit transactions with other nations if the current executive order should ever be lifted. That is why H.R. 748 was introduced in the House and why, I gather, that you are going to consider it here in the Senate. It was to close this loophole. The bill strips the executive branch of the authority to issue regulations exempting transactions from the prohibition. It establishes instead a legislative exception only for transactions incident to routine diplomatic relations among countries. By this, we mean those transactions which arise when citizens of this country or representatives of a terrorist supporting country travel or engage in activities for diplomatic purposes. For example, a cab ride from Kennedy Airport to the United Nations building would not be included. Similarly, an American diplomat traveling to Syria or Sudan on official business could perform the financial transactions necessary for that trip. Mr. Chairman, I think that is what we intended to begin with, but that is not the way the Treasury Department has allowed the enactment of section 321 of the antiterrorism bill to work. If we are going to isolate these terrorist States, section 321 must be enacted as intended. Finally, I want to make one last comment. I know there are those who believe that the targeted countries--Sudan, in particular--are at the point now where they are ripe for changing their ways, and there are those who think they have already changed; that may be true. I would love to believe that those nations will change in the future. But I know it was only a few weeks ago that I had a visit from the Ambassador from Sudan. We had a long conversation in which we discussed a lot of the activities he said they had done in Sudan to correct the problems and not allow terrorist activities to be done. He encouraged me to be supportive and open to the possibility of opening trade and removing the restrictions, et cetera. Although I cannot reveal all of the details, because I serve on the Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that when I went back to the Intelligence Committee and asked my Intelligence Committee sources about the Ambassador's statements, I found that the great majority of them were simply unfounded and not true. So I am very suspicious when I hear people say that the Sudan is ready to cooperate, considering its past history of human rights violations as well as terrorist encouragement. It is one of those things that I will remain, and I trust you will, too, very skeptical of as we listen to those who say they have improved the situation. That is not to say that we would not like to see the targeted nations change in those ways, but the changes need to be open, demonstrable, and clearly felt so that we can actually see terrorist activities are no longer supported. That is simply not the case today, and until that is the case, I would certainly urge the enactment of H.R. 748 in the House and your companion legislation in the Senate so that we may send it to the President, because it needs to be law, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. McCollum follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Bill McCollum, A Representative in Congress From Florida Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss this critical issue of international terrorism and Sudan. I commend you for taking the time to focus on this important matter, and in particular, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership in the Senate in shaping U.S. policy toward terrorist sponsoring governments. I have the privilege of serving in the House as chairman of both the crime subcommittee and the Intelligence Committee's Subcommittee on Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence. These assignments have presented me with the opportunity to receive extensive information on the nature and extent of the threat posed by international terrorism. In my view, the forces of militant extremism in the Middle East and Africa are among the greatest international dangers currently facing America and its vital interests. The deadly threat posed by international terrorists must not be underestimated. We have all seen the pictures of bloody slaughter caused by these violent criminals. Yet, if hatred and coldheartedness were all that these killers needed, the world would be even more endangered than it already is. But terrorists need more than desire. They need support; they need infrastructure. And that's why the presence of terrorist supporting countries is so harmful to the world community. A handful of pariah States--Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Sudan--have been designated by the State Department, pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as terrorist sponsoring countries or ``Terrorism List Governments.'' No one should discount the significance of this designation. Without the support of these countries, terrorists would literally not have a home, much less the active assistance of government officials. With regard to Sudan specifically, I would remind the Subcommittee of how U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson described this country only a few months ago in connection with his confirmation. He said, ``The Sudanese Government destabilizes its neighbors, supports terrorists, commits human rights abuses against it own citizens, and pursues civil war in the south.'' Clearly, the training and support of terrorists occurring in Sudan are major contributors to the untold human suffering cause by religious extremists in this region of the world. Mr. Chairman, there should be no higher priority for the United States in the battle against terrorism than the elimination of foreign government support for terrorists. This is why section 321 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 is a vital tool in this battle. The clear and unambiguous language of the statute addresses the problem of financial support to terrorist sponsoring countries: Whoever . . . knowingly or having reasonable cause to know that a country is designated . . . as a country supporting international terrorism, engages in a financial transaction with the government of that country, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 10 years, or both. The term ``financial transactions'' is defined very broadly to include virtually all transfers of monetary instruments or a thing of value. Section 321 of the Anti-Terrorism Act I became aware of the need for legislation in this area last year when I learned through news reports that the Rev. Louis Farakhan had traveled to Libya, and received a personal pledge of significant financial support from Col. Moammar Gadhafi. Like most Americans, I was outraged that a well known supporter of terrorism and enemy of the United States such as Col. Gadhafi would be able to provide financial support to a U.S. citizen. After reviewing the relevant statutes and regulations, I learned that the principle means for restricting most economic transactions with terrorist supporting countries was through executive order, and that not all governments known to support terrorists were covered by such orders. I therefore concluded that a permanent ban on financial transactions between U.S. persons (a term which includes both individuals and corporate entities) and countries which support terrorism was necessary. This ban, which became section 321 of the Antiterrorism Act, was offered as an amendment to the bill on the House floor by Congressman Charles Schumer, the ranking minority member of the crime subcommittee and myself, and it was adopted on a voice vote. It was drafted with a dual purpose in mind. First, it prohibits financial support from terrorist countries to U.S. persons, thus attempting to prevent the long-arm of terrorism from reaching the shores of the United States through domestic entities. Second, and more broadly, it prohibits all financial transactions by U.S. persons with these countries, regardless of where these transactions take place. The obvious goal of this language is to cutoff terrorist sponsoring governments from the economic benefit of doing business with U.S. companies. Since five of the seven terrorism list governments are already subject to economic sanctions as a result of executive order, the immediate impact of the ban related to Sudan and Syria. While we were preparing the amendment, we were advised by the administration that the broad wording of the prohibition could have unintended consequences, particularly in the area of diplomacy. I agreed to authorize the Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the State Department, to issue regulations which provided some exceptions to the ban. We intended these regulations to exclude various innocuous transactions that occur in the course of diplomatic activities and other related official matters 31 CFR Part 596 In August of last year, I learned that the Treasury Department had published its regulations in relation to section 321. To my great disappointment, I discovered that the regulations reversed the effect of the new prohibition. These regulations permit all financial transactions with Sudan and Syria, other than those which pose a risk of furthering domestic terrorism. The regulations prohibit U.S. persons from receiving unlicensed donations and from engaging in financial transactions with respect to which the United States person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the financial transaction poses a risk of furthering terrorist acts in the United States. As my cosponsor, Mr. Schumer, recently said, this is a loophole big enough to drive a carbomb through it. Mr. Chairman, let me make this point as clearly as I can. It was not my intention then, nor is it now, that the regulatory authority provided in section 321 should be exercised in this manner. Had I known that the administration would chose to render the prohibition meaningless with its regulations I would not have agreed to give it such broad authority. This ``business as usual'' policy represents a step backward in the effort to isolate Syria and Sudan. The regulations could also permit transactions with the other nations if the current executive orders should ever be lifted. H.R. 748 I have introduced H.R. 748 along with Mr. Schumer to close this loophole and to prohibit transactions other than those that are specifically connected to diplomatic activities. The bill strips the executive branch of the authority to issue regulations exempting transactions from the prohibition. It establishes instead a legislative exception only for transactions ``incident to routine diplomatic relations among countries.'' By this we mean only those transactions which arise when citizens of this country or representatives of a terrorist supporting country travel or engage in activities for diplomatic purposes. For example, a cab ride from Kennedy airport to the United Nations building would not be included. Similarly, an American diplomat traveling to Syria on official business would not be included. I realize that this legislation could affect many law-abiding U.S. companies doing business in the affected countries. Under current law, such business may be entirely lawful. But in my view, the only way we are going to eliminate the governmental support terrorist organizations desperately need, is to take a firm stance against economic relationships with these countries. Again, I thank the Subcommittee for inviting me to testify on this issue, and I look forward to working with you on legislation that will deter the spread of terrorism in the world. Senator Ashcroft. Thank you, Congressman McCollum. I call on Senator Feingold. Senator Feingold. I have no questions. I just want to join the chairman in welcoming the Representative. I appreciate his interest, and I hope we can work together between the two Houses to further our concern about Sudan itself and in particular Sudan's activities with regard to supporting or abetting terrorism. Thank you. Mr. McCollum. Thank you. Senator Ashcroft. Senator Grams. Senator Grams. Representative McCollum, what has been the administration's reaction to this? Are they supportive of 748? Mr. McCollum. No, they are not. I think you will find that they believe there should be much more flexibility with this legislation. If we can come up with specific exceptions within certain bounds I would be open to them, as I think you should be, but to say, ``a plague on your house, we do not want this kind of restrictive prohibition,'' is not acceptable and that is apparently their position. You are going to hear from them today, but that is how I understand their position. Senator Grams. So despite evident concern by the Sudanese about lifting some of the restrictions and some of the comments they have made, and you have found them not to be completely true, if at all, the administration would basically be ignoring this? Mr. McCollum. Well, at least the arms of the administration dealing with this bill are ignoring it. I think that there are people in the administration, in the intelligence community, and others who could tell me that the Sudanese are not on the up and up right now. I am also concerned because a lot of businessmen in America say, ``hey, we need these financial transactions. We are going to be isolated. We are going to be cutoff. We are not going to be able to do business. Somebody else is going to do the business.'' I have heard that argument about every time the Congress has proposed an economic sanction. There are times when economic sanctions are a bad idea, and there are times when they are absolutely necessary. This is not an economic sanction in the true sense, but it is a specific restriction on financial transactions. Some American business interests certainly could complain that the restriction hurts them, but we have got to do something about terrorist States, and there is no other way to do it. If they want to do business with us, as some of them profess they want to do; then they must change their ways, modify their ways, stop their terrorist support. But I think the administration is only listening to the business community that wants to continue its policies in trading with Sudan, or expand its trade with Sudan. Senator Grams. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Ashcroft. Representative McCollum, your proposed legislation, would it stop businesses from doing any business in Sudan, or does it stop business from doing business with the Sudanese Government? Mr. McCollum. With the Sudanese Government, Mr. Chairman. It would not prohibit private transactions among private citizens. It is strictly with the Government, and it is limited to financial transactions with the Government. Senator Ashcroft. Is it your intention to continue to make it possible for relief organizations in the event of disasters or other compelling circumstances or exigencies to be able to provide that relief? Mr. McCollum. Absolutely. I certainly hope that the Sudanese Government would permit humanitarian relief and not hide behind this restriction in some manner. Humanitarian aid from a relief organization does not require a financial transaction with the Sudanese Government. Thus, such relief is not automatically restricted by this prohibition. Senator Ashcroft. Well, section 321 is originally designed to make sure that our transactions there did not result in sponsoring or funding or otherwise contributing to a capacity to injure us or others in terrorist acts. Mr. McCollum. That is exactly correct. The objective of 321 and the objective of 748 are both the same: To impair the Government of the Sudan from furthering terrorism and to restrict its financial transactions with United States citizens, be it individuals or businesses, that could be in furtherance of such terrorism. I do not believe, Mr. Chairman, that you can simply narrow that down and say only those transactions that pose that risk. Treasury's regulation is just too narrow. As Mr. Schumer said, you can drive a car bomb through it. You can drive a lot of things through it. Senator Ashcroft. Are there any examples of transactions which occurred or were discussed or could have occurred during the interim which you might point out might have substantially benefited or enhanced the capacity of Sudan? Mr. McCollum. There was a lot of discussion about an oil deal with one of our American companies. I understand that there have been those who have back-tracked from the deal saying, ``Oh, this really did not or was not going to happen,'' but it would have been directly with the Government of Sudan. It would have been a new financial transaction with a substantial amount of money involved. Senator Ashcroft. Hundreds of millions of dollars? Mr. McCollum. Hundreds of millions of dollars. However, it did not take place. Senator Ashcroft. So those are the kinds of things that our State Department said would have been justified? Mr. McCollum. That is correct, because they said that such a deal does not pose a direct threat to terrorism. In other words, we cannot say that this deal is directly financing the terrorist activity itself. Senator Ashcroft. So the charge has been made that the Sudanese gave the machine guns to those to assassinate Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia? Mr. McCollum. That is correct. Senator Ashcroft. And our State Department would have said well, that is OK, because buying machine guns for that is not a threat to terrorism in the United States? Mr. McCollum. I do not know if I would want to go that far, but it could be interpreted that way, Mr. Chairman. I think that you have got to recognize that there are indirect means of supporting terrorism. That is why the financial transactions are so important. Why should we, as the Government and as citizens of the United States, allow money to flow from our country to the Government of Sudan, knowing that it could be used to sponsor terrorism? That is really what the issue is all about. It is not that we want to cutoff the private citizen's business deals. However, all money is fungible. So if the Sudanese Government gets money from our people, from our citizenry, it can use that money for a variety of activities-- including terrorism, and we have no way of knowing which money the Government is using for what. Senator Ashcroft. If we have no way of knowing where any money goes once it goes into their accounts, whether the same money comes back out, would that not mean the interpretation currently undertaken through the regulations by the administration gives section 321 no effect whatever? Mr. McCollum. That is right. It just renders it meaningless. That is why the bill is so important that you are about to sponsor here in the Senate. Senator Ashcroft. I thank the Congressman for his good work. Mr. McCollum. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. Senator Ashcroft. This morning, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Andy Foyce called my office to make a special request in regard to this hearing. The Justice Department requested that Mr. Charles Maikish, one of our private witnesses, testify first because he has to appear in an important trial concerning the World Trade Center bombing in New York this afternoon. It is not our custom to put private witnesses ahead of individuals who represent the State Department, but we felt that in this situation, at the request of the Attorney General's Office, it would be important to do so. I want to thank the members of the State Department for their willingness to defer for this one private witness. The other private witnesses will testify after the administration panel as planned. I apologize for this change in the schedule. It is, however, critical to the trial, and it is important to accommodate the Attorney General's Office in this respect. It is my pleasure now to call Charles Maikish, the former building manager of the World Trade Center. He was the building manager of the World Trade Center when the bombing occurred. I welcome you to this hearing and thank you for your willingness to testify. STATEMENT OF CHARLES MAIKISH, VICE PRESIDENT FOR FACILITIES MANAGEMENT, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NEW YORK Mr. Maikish. Thank you, Senator. It indeed is a privilege and an honor to be able to address this committee on the issue of foreign terrorism, having experienced it personally. I was the senior executive responsible for the World Trade Center Complex in February 1993. Four years ago at 12:18 in the afternoon, this country received a rather startling wake-up call. For the first time, a major foreign terrorist act was committed on U.S. soil, and not only on U.S. soil, but it was targeted at the heart of our free economic system. At 12:18 that day, on a snowy afternoon, a massive explosive device equivalent to 1,500 pounds of explosives was detonated below the World Trade Center in the heart of this Nation's and the world's financial capital. It is clear that the intent of the foreign group was to inflict massive loss of human life, and a lasting and permanent disruption of our economic system and our way of life. To fully appreciate the impact of this act and the threat it still poses, I need to set it in a context by describing for you the World Trade Center complex, its purpose, its location, and its component parts. The trade center is located in the heart of Lower Manhattan in the world financial district. It is the single largest international commercial complex in the world. It is owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as a facility for international trade and commerce, and the port authority was created by the U.S. Congress 75 years ago. It contains seven buildings surrounding a 5-acre plaza on a 16-acre site. You best know it for its twin towers, which are emblematic of New York and this country worldwide. These towers rise 1,350 feet in the air, being the second and third tallest structures in the world. The complex in fact is equivalent to a small or medium- sized American city. It houses 50,000 workers on any one particular day, and it can have as many as 80,000 visitors, for a population of about 130,000. It contains 12 million square feet of commercial office space, the size of downtown Cleveland's commercial office district. It has 3 million square feet of space below grade. It has a 400,000 square foot shopping center, the equivalent of a major shopping center. It has three subway lines and the Path Interstate Railroads, which stop in it as a major transit hub. It has a major ticketing center. It has an 826-room international hotel. It has the world-famous observation deck, which is visited by 2 million international visitors a year, and of course Windows on the World, the famous restaurant on top of the other tower. It is a major hub for media. It houses the broadcasting facilities for the major TV, 22 stations, with the antenna, which is the major broadcasting facility for the region in New York. Below the trade center is its operating guts and parking for 2,000 vehicles. It has 375 commercial leases and over 1,000 businesses, international businesses that engage in trade and commerce on a daily basis. To give you some examples, the New York Commodities Exchange is located in the trade center. Those are the five exchanges that set the market for world oil, the COMEX Exchange, the NYNEX Exchange, the exchanges that set the world market for precious metals, gold, et cetera, the exchanges that set the market for cotton and textiles, and the exchanges that set the market for other types of metals and futures. It is a banking and international center. Eighty percent of all U.S. treasuries are traded or brokered through facilities at the World Trade Center. It is an international phone exchange, with all of the international phone lines and all the phone lines serving the financial district going through its bowels. The loss of those phone lines would mean a major disruption in world communications of financial data. It would also mean, for instance, the loss of the three airports because of the air traffic control system telecommunications going through that facility. It represents the home for business and governments from 60 countries, and State and Government agencies, including U.S. Customs, Secret Service, et cetera. The Government of Thailand, the Republic of China, the Government of France, et cetera, are all located there. The bomb was placed at the Trade Center between the two towers. I have two graphics here which display this for you. The crater itself was absolutely enormous. It was half the size of a football field, and what this particular photograph shows you is the south wall of the north tower. The bomb was placed immediately adjacent to the south wall of the north tower, 1,500 pounds of explosives intended by those that placed it there to cause the tower to topple. Fortunately, they were not successful in their goal of doing that. As Judge Duffy commented in the sentencing in the first trial, they were intending on killing everybody in the complex, 130,000 people. Found within the locker where the explosives were contained was also a barrel of cyanide, and there was cyanide missing. The speculation was that they tried to lace the bomb with cyanide as well to assure the death of the people in the Trade Center. It resulted in the loss of six lives and one unborn child. If they had succeeded they would have killed tens of thousands and injured many more. More than that, though, it would have been a total disruption to our system here in this country and the economic loss would have been measured in the billions, not just the $600 million that we talk about now, because the businesses and the economic activities would have been disrupted for a long period of time to come. What was and should our response be? The Governor of the State of New York when he saw this responded on what does he tell the 16 million people in the State of New York as to how they continue to go on in the face of this, and he answered his own question. He said normalcy was the rule of the day, that we needed to establish a normalcy and continue our way of the life. Mitigation of the act. We brought the Trade Center back in 3 weeks. We brought its businesses back, we had the Governor move back, and businesses continue. We mitigated the economic loss and the human tragedy. I must commend ATF and the FBI for the work they did in the quick investigation, determining who was responsible for this, the apprehension, and the quick prosecution and punishment. Last, constant vigilance, balancing our need to preserve and protect our free society and its personal freedoms and our market economy with the measures which are necessary to preserve it at its core. An example of this is, the Trade Center is no longer an open access facility. There is controlled access to the towers. We are ringed with very heavy planters to give us a hard core exterior. There is no public parking. There is perimeter security. There is the use of modern technology to ensure the security within the complex, patrols and the use of human labor to do that as well. We are trying to preserve the sense of free movement and avoid the perception of an armed camp. We are trying to stop the threat at the perimeter of the Trade Center, rather than allowing it in. When you visit New York and the World Trade Center, it will always be there standing tall for you to see. When you look upon it, let it reawaken you to the ever present danger of global terrorism. Thank you for the opportunity. Senator Ashcroft. Thank you, Mr. Maikish, for bringing to us your unique perspective on this specific incident and on the challenge which we all face. I would call on Senator Feingold if he has any questions or comments. Senator Feingold. I have no questions. I just want to express my appreciation for that very vivid account of this horror that was perpetrated in our country, and my sympathies to you and all the people that were affected by it, and obviously we recognize the connection by this hearing between what we do internationally and what happens within this country. Thank you. Senator Ashcroft. Mr. Maikish, I understand that you need to leave promptly, so I will just ask one or two questions myself. I want to clarify what you are saying. What would have been the cost in human life and injury if the first tower had toppled into the second tower as the terrorists had hoped would be the case? Mr. Maikish. Literally, tens of thousands of people would have been killed in such an event. The towers themselves handle about 20,000 in each of the towers, so you had 40,000 I think directly vulnerable to the loss of their life. The complex itself had 130,000. You would have had severe and extended injury to a good portion of that population that was in the complex if, in fact, the towers had come down. Senator Ashcroft. Do you know if the New York City or other authorities have taken steps that you could discuss that would help prevent this kind of situation from happening again? Mr. Maikish. There are organized steps that have been calculated to both receive early warning as well as to secure against this type an event. I would rather not discuss the particulars. Senator Ashcroft. Do you have any idea about whether or not the United States should continue to engage in the full range of commercial dealings with terrorist governments? Mr. Maikish. Senator, my only comment on that is to the extent that these activities are well-funded, then our job becomes a lot harder in terms of preventing it or stopping it at our borders, and it causes us to expand a lot more in financial resources and human resources in terms of prevention. To the extent that they continue to be funded well, to that extent the threat grows. Senator Ashcroft. Thank you very much for taking your time to be with us, and thank you for going out of order. You are not out of order, but---- Mr. Maikish. Senator, I appreciate the courtesy. Senator Ashcroft. Thank you very much, and I wish you a safe trip. It would be my pleasure now to introduce the panel of witnesses from the administration. I call the Hon. George Moose, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, the Hon. Ken McKune, Deputy Coordinator for Counterterrorism for the Department of State, and R. Rick Newcomb, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of Treasury. I am grateful for the fact that you all have been willing to appear before us today. You have visited with us and conferred with us in our offices, and I am eager to have your contributions to this subject matter before the committee at this time. It is my pleasure to call upon Ambassador Moose for remarks in the first instance. STATEMENT OF GEORGE E. MOOSE, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AFRICA Ambassador Moose. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I welcome this opportunity this morning to appear before the subcommittee and to discuss the broad range of our policies and concerns with respect to Sudan, and particularly on the issue of Sudan's support for international terrorism. Mr. Chairman, I have prepared a longer written testimony, which I would request be included in the record of the hearing. Senator Ashcroft. It will be included in the record, and thank you for your willingness to hit the highlights and carry us to the most important, salient features of your testimony. Ambassador Moose. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I could briefly summarize the matters of great concern to the United States with regard to Sudan. U.S. foreign policy objectives with respect to Sudan are clear and unequivocal. They are to isolate the Sudanese Government and to contain its efforts to sponsor international terrorism and, second, to oblige the Sudanese Government to change other unacceptable aspects of both its domestic and its international behavior. Our ongoing diplomatic contacts with the Sudanese Government are aimed at making our serious objections known directly to senior levels of the Khartoum Government. Our concerns and our responses fall into four broad categories. They are terrorism. They are regional destabilization. They are human rights. And they are the continuing prosecution of the Sudanese civil war. With regard to terrorism, Mr. Chairman, the Sudan Government continues to support international terrorism, primarily in providing a safe haven for terrorist elements. It was for that reason that the Clinton administration, in 1993, placed Sudan on the list of State sponsors of terrorism. And in accordance with that designation, we have applied a range of unilateral sanctions to oblige the Sudanese Government to cease and desist in its support for terrorism. Since 1995, the Sudanese Government has failed to extradite to Ethiopia three suspects in the assassination attempt against President Mubarak of Egypt. The United States has led the efforts in the United Nations Security Council to adopt Security Council resolutions. As a result of Sudan's failure to comply with those resolutions, particularly Resolution 1044, the U.S. Government has reduced the number of Sudanese diplomats in this country and restricted their travel within the United States. We have imposed a restrictive visa regime for the government and military officials. And we are actively pursuing continuing efforts in the Security Council to impose additional sanctions. In the face of this mounting international pressure, Sudan has taken some steps to respond to the concerns that we and others have raised regarding their involvement in international terrorism. Its most significant action was the expulsion of exiled Saudi terrorist financier Osama bin Laden, and many of his so-called Arab-Afghan followers. However, as others have pointed out this morning, Mr. Bin Laden continues to maintain links to a number of businesses in Sudan, and he retains ties to some leaders of the National Islamic Front. Khartoum has also taken steps to tighten its previously lax controls on the movements of foreigners into and through its territory by establishing visa requirements and other restrictions. Mr. Chairman, these actions, however, do not constitute an adequate or a satisfactory response to the concerns that we and others have raised. We consider them largely tactical, and Sudan has far to go to meet the concerns that we and others have raised with regard to its support for international terrorism. Our second set of concerns, Mr. Chairman, has to do with Sudan's support for groups in the region who actively seek to destabilize neighboring countries, particularly, but not exclusively, Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Despite numerous regional efforts to promote mediation both within Sudan and with its neighbors, Sudan's regional policies have, to date, frustrated the efforts to achieve any reasonable accommodation. To help these neighboring States contain Sudan-sponsored insurgencies, President Clinton, in 1995, authorized the transfer of some $15 million in nonlethal defensive military assistance to Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea. That was in fiscal year 1996. And a further transfer of $4.75 million of similar equipment is authorized for this fiscal year. The aid to date has consisted of such items as boots and backpacks, field rations and tents. The first shipments of this assistance for Eritrea and Ethiopia arrived in February of this year. Our third major set of concerns with regard to Sudan has to do with Sudan's egregious human rights record. Indeed, Khartoum has one of the worst human rights records in the world. It is responsible for numerous abuses in both the north and the south of the country, and it has allowed the continuing practice of slavery in certain parts of the country. The United States has taken the lead in the U.N. Human Rights Commission, in the General Assembly, in denouncing these human rights violations. And we have also mounted a significant effort, in 1996, to gain access to Sudan on the part of U.N. human rights rapporteurs, whose efforts have helped to uncover and publicize the extent of Sudan's human rights abuses. Last, Mr. Chairman, we remain deeply concerned by the Khartoum Government's continued prosecution of a very costly and devastating civil war in the South, rather than seek a just solution that recognizes the rights of all of Sudan's citizens. The 14-year conflict has taken an estimated 1.5 million lives, and generated approximately 2 million internally displaced persons. Active northern opposition now to the National Islamic Front regime indicates clearly the extent to which Khartoum's radical policies have alienated large segments of Sudanese society. The U.S. Government does not provide any support to any party in the civil war. We have, however, supported efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement in a manner that recognizes the legitimate interests and the rights of all Sudanese, and we do seek to mitigate the devastating impact of the civil war on the Sudanese people. We are the largest single provider of humanitarian assistance to Sudan. Since 1988, we have provided more than $600 million in humanitarian assistance, primarily to the war-affected people in southern Sudan. Mr. Chairman, certain of the abhorrent policies and practices are not new or unique to this current Sudanese regime, and our approach to Sudan must take into account that long history and the root causes of conflict. However, a complex reality in no way absolves the current NIF-led regime of responsibility for its own actions. To date, the Sudanese response to our concerns and the deep concerns expressed by others have been inadequate, intended primarily to relieve domestic and international pressure, rather than to reflect a real reconsideration of policy. Our objective remains the same. It is to isolate this regime diplomatically and otherwise, and to oblige it to pursue policies and actions that will change its unacceptable behavior. Failing that, we have made it clear to Sudanese authorities that they will face growing international pressure and that our own bilateral relationship will continue to deteriorate. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I would just say that when I first assumed my responsibilities in 1993, one of the first official acts or responsibilities that I was called upon to perform was to advise Secretary of State Christopher on the question of whether Sudan should be put on the list of State sponsors of terrorism. And I recall very clearly my conversation with Senator Feingold at that time. I will say that there was unanimity within the State Department that Sudan fully deserved and merited to be put on that list. I cannot speak for others, but certainly in terms of my own participation in that decision, there was no need for any external pressure or exhortation in order to convince us that that was the right and the appropriate decision. Since that time, I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that there is no government in the world that has taken a stronger stance or applied more specific measures with regard to Sudan's behavior generally and specifically with regard to its support for international terrorism. Our leadership on this issue has been critical not only in terms of our bilateral actions, but also in terms of our efforts to mobilize international opinion to support broader measures to deal with Sudan's continuing support for terrorism. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Ambassador Moose follows:] Prepared Statement of Ambassador George E. Moose Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I welcome the opportunity to participate in this hearing on U.S. counterterrorism policy towards Sudan. My colleague, Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Ken McKune, will address the particulars of our counterterrorism policy. I would like to complement his presentation by describing the broader concerns we have with Sudan and the numerous actions we have taken in response, including our fight against terrorism. Background Sudan is the largest country in Africa, as large as the eastern portion of the United States. Its 27 million people belong to numerous ethnic and religious groups, many of which fit together uneasily. The most distinct division in the country is between a predominantly Arab/ Muslim north and a predominantly non-Arab/non-Muslim south. The desire of many southerners for greater autonomy, control of resources, and liberation from the imposition of Islamic law lies at the heart of Sudan's continuous civil strife. Since independence in 1956, only the period between 1972 and 1983 saw a country at peace with itself. We estimate that the conflict has taken about one and a half million lives. Today there are approximately two million internally displaced persons in Sudan, as well as several hundred thousand Sudanese refugees living in neighboring States. The tragedy of Sudan is compounded by the fact that a potentially prosperous nation has failed its own people and contributed negatively to the region's welfare. Decades of economic mismanagement have resulted in an inflation rate of more than 100 percent and the largest arrears to the International Monetary Fund of any country in the world. Endowed with the potential to generate food surpluses, poor policies and civil war make Sudan a net food importer. The threat Sudan poses to its neighbors has forced those countries to divert scarce resources from productive to military ends. Sudan Under the NIF: Fundamental Problem Since 1989, when military officers aligned with the National Islamic Front (NIF) overthrew Sudan's last democratically-elected government, Sudan has implemented a wide range of policies which have further alienated it from its citizens and earned it the opprobrium of the international community. Our concerns, and our responses, fall into four broad categories: First, the NIF regime supports international terrorism, primarily by providing safe-haven to terrorist elements. We have taken unilateral actions and worked through the UN Security Council to mobilize international action on this issue. Second, Khartoum actively seeks to destabilize its neighbors by providing material support and haven for violent insurgent groups. President Clinton's response is to provide the neighboring States of Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea with non-lethal defensive military assistance in 1996 and again this fiscal year. Third, Khartoum has one of the worst human rights records in the world, inflicting numerous abuses in both the north and the south of the country and allowing slavery to continue in certain parts of the country. The United States has urged Sudan to wipe out slavery and we have taken the lead in the UN Human Rights Commission and General Assembly denouncing its human rights violations. Fourth, the NIF has prosecuted a costly civil war rather than seek a just solution that recognizes the rights of all its citizens. In its conduct of the war, Sudan also hinders the delivery of humanitarian assistance to war-affected civilians. Since 1988 we have provided more than $600 million in humanitarian assistance, primarily to the war- affected people in southern Sudan. Certain of these abhorrent policies and practices are not new or unique to the current regime, and our approach to Sudan considers the root causes of conflict. A complex reality, however, in no way absolves the NIF-led government of responsibility for its actions. Our objective is to isolate and contain the threat that the NIF regime poses as well as to try to compel it to change its unacceptable behavior. Failing that, we have made it clear to Sudan that they will face growing international pressure, and that our bilateral relationship will further deteriorate. I now would like to go into greater detail on each of our concerns and actions we have taken in response. Terrorism In 1993, the Clinton Administration placed Sudan on the list of State sponsors of terrorism and we have applied unilateral sanctions consistent with that designation. Sudan was known to provide refuge, logistical support such as training facilities, travel documents, and weapons to a variety of radical terrorist organizations. Since 1995, Sudan has failed to cooperate with the international community to help extradite to Ethiopia three suspects in the assassination attempt in Addis Ababa against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. After demands from the organization of African Unity (OAU) that Sudan facilitate their extradition to Ethiopia went unheeded, the U.S. played a leading role last year in the adoption of three U.N. Security Council resolutions. Resolution 1044 required that Sudan act ``to extradite to Ethiopia for prosecution'' the three suspects and that it ``desist'' from ``activities of assisting, supporting and facilitating terrorist activities and from giving shelter or sanctuary to terrorist elements.'' The United States emphasized at the time that we would consider Sudan responsible for extradition of the suspects even if they allowed them to leave the country, as may now have occurred. As a result of Sudan's failure to comply with Resolution 1044, the Council considered and adopted Resolution 1054, calling on member States to adopt travel restrictions on Sudanese government officials, and Resolution 1070, which conceived of a ban on flights by Sudanese Government-controlled aircraft. The United States Government reduced the number of Sudanese diplomats in this country, restricted their travel here, and imposed a restrictive visa regime for government and military officials. In the face of mounting international pressure, Sudan has taken some steps to respond to concerns about its involvement in international terrorism. Its most significant action was the expulsion of exiled Saudi terrorist financier Osama bin Laden and many of his so- called ``Arab Afghan'' followers. However, bin Laden remains linked to a number of businesses in Sudan and retains ties to some NIF leaders. Khartoum also took steps to tighten what has been an extremely porous border, establishing new visa requirements to control foreign travel into and out of the country. However, we consider these largely tactical steps. Sudan has far to go to meet our concern that it cease its support for international terrorism. Regional Stability A central U.S. objective is that Sudan end its sponsorship of insurgent groups which seek to destabilize the neighboring countries of Uganda, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Despite regional efforts to promote mediation, both within Sudan and with its neighbors, Sudan's regional policies have to date frustrated efforts to achieve a reasonable accommodation. To help these neighboring countries contain Sudanese-sponsored insurgencies, in late 1995, President Clinton authorized the transfer of $15 million in non-lethal defensive military assistance to these countries for FY96. A transfer of $4.75 million of such equipment is taking place this fiscal year. The aid to date has consisted of boots, backpacks, field radios, and tents. The first shipments of this assistance for Eritrea and Ethiopia arrived in February 1997. Human Rights In April, the United States and other members of the UN Human Rights Commission passed a consensus resolution expressing ``deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of Sudan.'' The Resolution identified a litany of ongoing abuses by the government, including ``extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions without due process, enforced or involuntary disappearances, violations of the rights of women and children, slavery and slavery- like practices, forced displacement of persons and systematic torture, and denial of the freedoms of religion, expression, association and peaceful assembly.'' The Commission expressed ``serious concern'' over reports of ``religious persecution, including forced conversion of Christians and animists, in government controlled areas.'' Last year, we succeeded, through the actions of the Human Rights Commission, in getting Sudan to readmit the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Sudan. As a consequence, the Special Rapporteur was able to produce important information on ongoing abuses in Sudan that contributed to the international consensus on Sudan's record. Civil War and National Reconciliation Key southern and northern opposition forces have recently formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Their avowed aim is to oust the NIF from power. This is an important development in Sudan's civil war which has historically been a struggle by southern Sudan's socially distinct, non-Arab population against what they see as northern government policies of ``Arabization,'' ``Islamicization,'' and political exclusion. Active northern opposition to the NIF regime indicates the extent to which its radical policies have alienated large segments of Sudanese society. Rebel forces recently engaged and defeated GOS forces in several areas of southern and eastern Sudan separated by hundreds of miles. The U.S. Government does not provide any support to any party to the civil war. We have supported efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement in a manner that recognizes the legitimate interests and rights of all Sudanese. We do seek to mitigate the devastating impact of civil war on the Sudanese people and are the largest provider of humanitarian aid to Sudan. We continue to protest frequent Sudanese bans on the type and destination of relief aircraft, based on allegations, which we consider unfounded, that the assistance will go directly to rebel groups. I would like to note here that we remain very skeptical that movement towards resolving the civil war will emerge from a Peace Agreement signed on April 21 between the Government and a number of the smaller rebel groups. Although the Agreement contained a positive step in its recognition of Sudan's multi-racial, -ethnic, and -religious nature, it did not spell out how and to what extent these rights would be respected in the context of the current NIF policies and practices. The GOS professions of a desire to negotiate, moreover, must be viewed against the backdrop of repeated, failed mediation efforts. As in the past, the most important elements of the opposition, in this case the NDA, have not been persuaded that the process or the Agreement itself will satisfy their legitimate interests. I would also like to mention President Carter's trip to the region last month. President Carter undertook this mission in his capacity as a private citizen, and his efforts carried no official U.S. Government sanction. At the same time, we welcome his interest in Sudan's continuing conflict and his efforts to promote a just solution. The insights he gained during his travel have been considered with interest by the Secretary. The Importance of a Comprehensive Domestic Peace The U.S. Government believes that the NIF government is fully culpable for the abuses it has inflicted on its people, the aggressive acts it has committed toward neighbors, and the support it has given international terrorism. We believe that it can and must cease these activities. It may be, however, that the radicalism of the current regime will continue as long as the NIF-controlled government represents an embattled and narrowly based segment of society. A just resolution of Sudan's internal conflict--one that gives a voice in government to more moderate elements in the north and to the major political and ethnic forces in the south--would thus do much to eliminate the sources of Sudan's unacceptable domestic and international behavior. For this reason, our own contribution to regional and international efforts to resolve Sudan's civil war can contribute to the achievement of our other goals vis-a-vis Sudan as well. U.S. U.S. objectives are clear and unequivocal: to isolate Sudan and to contain its support for insurgents and terrorists and to oblige the Sudanese Government, by exacting a price for unacceptable behavior, to change its domestic and international conduct. Our ongoing diplomatic contacts with Sudanese officials are aimed at making our serious objections known directly to senior levels in Khartoum. As the Secretary said in another context, ``engagement does not mean acceptance.'' Ambassador Carney and others have expressed our concerns in detail to the Government of Sudan. To date, the Sudanese responses have been inadequate and appear to have been largely tactical, intended primarily to relieve domestic and international pressure rather than to reflect a real reconsideration of policy. The international community has made it clear that it will not accept cosmetic changes from Khartoum and will insist on real improvement in Sudan's domestic and international behavior. It remains our hope that Sudan, in the face of this pressure, will recognize the need to make such a fundamental change. Failing such a change, as I said earlier, we have made it clear to the Government of Sudan that they will face growing international pressure and that our bilateral relationship will further deteriorate. Senator Ashcroft. Thank you. I would now call upon the Hon. Kenneth R. McKune, who is the Associate Coordinator for Counterterrorism in the Department of State. Thank you very much, Mr. McKune. STATEMENT OF KENNETH R. MCKUNE, ACTING COORDINATOR FOR COUNTERTERRORISM, DEPARTMENT OF STATE Mr. McKune. Mr. Chairman, Senator Feingold, thank you for this opportunity to testify today on our counterterrorism policy toward Sudan. I have submitted a longer statement for the record. I will summarize the policy and the Sudanese parts and leave off the sanctions. Senator Ashcroft. It is a pleasure to assure you that it will be made a part of the record, and to welcome your remarks highlighting the testimony. Mr. McKune. Thank you. Before commenting on Sudan specifically, I would like to briefly provide the context by outlining several key elements of our overall counterterrorism policy. They apply to Sudan and to other countries on the terrorism list and to individual terrorists. First, a fundamental principle of U.S. policy is to make no concessions to terrorists. We have a longstanding policy of not giving in to terrorists' demands and not making concessions that would reward terrorist actions, including payment of ransom for hostages. Of course, we will use every appropriate resource to gain the safe return of American citizens held hostage, but without making concessions. These principles have guided our counterterrorism policy and actions for many years. We urge other governments to follow these principles, and we apply them in practice. Second, we treat terrorists as criminals, consider their acts of violence as crimes, and make every effort to apprehend international terrorists who attack U.S. citizens or interests, so that they are prosecuted according to the rule of law. Third, regarding countries that support terrorists, we seek to bring pressure on them to end their assistance by imposing a variety of economic, diplomatic and political sanctions. Sudan was brought under this sanctions regime in August 1993, when the Secretary of State formally designated it as a country that has repeatedly provided support to groups engaged in acts of international terrorism. Sudan thus joined six countries already on the list: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, North Korea, and Cuba. Sudan was designated under section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act and related foreign assistance and arms control legislation, because it provided--and continues to provide--safe haven to terrorist groups, training facilities and a transit point for these groups. Although we do not have information that Sudan provides the level and type of assistance and active support for specific operations as do some countries on the State sponsors list, the type of hospitality Sudan grants to terrorist groups makes it easier for them to maintain their viability, train and to carry out terrorist actions, such as the June 1995 attack by Al-Gama'at al-Islamiyya against President Mubarak in Addis Ababa. Sudan harbors a number of terrorist groups. They include an old line secular group, the Abu Nidal organization, but most of them are militant Islamic extremist organizations. Among them are Hamas, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Al- Gama'at al-Islamiyya. The Sudanese Government also supports Islamic and non-Islamic opposition groups in Algeria, Uganda, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. Sudan did take a positive step last year by expelling ex- Saudi financier Osama bin Laden and expelling members of some terrorist groups. However, Sudan has yet to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1044, 1054 and 1070, which call on Sudan to extradite to Ethiopia the three suspects in the June 1995 assassination attempt against President Mubarak, and to end its support for terrorism. Sudan has not cutoff its support for terrorist organizations that continue to have a presence there. The United States has the most stringent set of laws of any country in imposing trade and other sanctions against State sponsors of international terrorism. There are more than a dozen such measures imposed against the seven countries designated by the Secretary as State sponsors, including Sudan. And here I will skip over the portion about the sanctions and just conclude by saying that the United States believes that the Government of Sudan, which is dominated by the National Islamic Front, has not taken sufficient steps to stop its support for terrorist extremist groups or expel them from its territory. Until Sudan ends such support, it will remain on our State sponsors of terrorism list. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement. Thank you.

Sudan harbors a number of terrorist groups. They include an ``old line'' secular group, the Abu Nidal Organization, but most of them are militant Islamic extremist organizations. Among them are: HAMAS, the Lebanese Hizballah, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Egypt's Al- Gama'at al-Islamiyya. The Sudanese government also supports Islamic and non-Islamic opposition groups in Algeria, Uganda, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Sudan did take a positive step last year by expelling ex-Saudi financier Osama bin Laden and expelling members of some terrorist groups. However, Sudan has yet to comply with the UN Security Council Resolutions 1044, 1054 and 1070 which call on Sudan to extradite to Ethiopia the three suspects in the June 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian President Mubarak and end its support for terrorism. Sudan has not cut off its support for terrorist organizations that continue to have a presence there. The United States has the most stringent set of laws of any country in imposing trade and other sanctions against State sponsors of international terrorism. There are more than a dozen such measures imposed against the seven countries designated by the Secretary as State sponsors, including Sudan. These measures include the Export Administration Act, which curbs the sale of dual-use items that could enhance a designated country's military capability or its ability to support acts of terrorism, as well as provisions prohibiting economic assistance, export of military equipment, and GSP trade treatment. Furthermore, as noted on U.S. income tax forms, U.S. individuals and companies are denied any foreign income tax credits for doing business in terrorist list countries. Judging by the inquiries we receive from companies and law firms in the course of a year, this seems to be a considerable disincentive to establishing a business relationship with a country, such as Sudan, that has only a minimal trade with the United States, about $30 million, each way. Other sanctions which apply to Sudan and the other terrorist list governments include using our voice and vote against loans or grants by international financial institutions. In addition, U.S. laws also prohibit American economic assistance to governments that provide economic aid or lethal military equipment to Sudan and other governments on the terrorism list. We have been monitoring whether there is any such assistance to Sudan and if we find such cases we will take appropriate action. These measures are aimed at the potential pressure points of State supporters of terrorism: foreign assistance, international loans and items which might have military use. The combined weight of these measures imposes severe limits on the U.S. relationship with Sudan and are designed to persuade Sudan to change its behavior in supporting terrorists. Already our trade relationship with Sudan is relatively minor; we mainly import gum arabic, which is used to provide the backing for stamps and post-it notes. With these economic sanctions as a background, we have continued our efforts to put political and other pressures on Sudan. One arena, as I mentioned, is in the United Nations. But we also work bilaterally, both in our contacts with Sudan and with other governments that have relations with Sudan, to persuade the Sudanese leadership to end their support for terrorism. The United States believes that the Government of Sudan, which is dominated by the National Islamic Front (NIF), has not taken sufficient steps to stop its support for terrorist extremist groups or expel them from its territory. Until Sudan ends such support, it will remain on our State sponsors of terrorism list. Mr. Chairman, at this point, that concludes my overview and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. Senator Ashcroft. Thank you, Mr. McKune. I now call on Mr. Newcomb. Mr. Newcomb is the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Department of the Treasury. Mr. Newcomb. STATEMENT OF R. RICHARD NEWCOMB, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Mr. Newcomb. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Feingold. Thank you for inviting me to testify in your hearing today. The Office of Foreign Assets Control administers economic sanctions and embargo programs against targeted foreign countries or groups to further U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. In administering these programs, Foreign Assets Control generally relies upon Presidential authority contained in the Trading with the Enemy Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or upon specific legislation to prohibit or regulate commercial financial transactions with specific countries or groups. Examples of our current Trading with the Enemy Act programs include comprehensive asset freezes and trade embargoes against North Korea and Cuba. Examples of our current IEEPA programs include similarly broad sanctions against Libya, Iraq, the Cali cartel in Colombia, and certain terrorist groups, as well as comprehensive trade sanctions against Iran. Alternatively, sanctions may be imposed by Congress directly through legislation. Administration of sanctions within the executive branch in these cases is usually delegated to the relevant enforcement agency, depending on the nature of the restrictions. Between 1986 and 1991, for example, OFAC administered the trade and investment prohibitions against South Africa, mandated by the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. Similarly, Foreign Assets Control has been delegated administration of section 321 of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which was signed into law by President Clinton on April 24th of last year. Section 321 of the Act prohibits financial transactions by United States persons with the governments of terrorist- supporting nations designated under 6(j) of the Export Administration Act. Effective August 22nd of last year, except as provided in regulations issued by the Treasury Department, which were issued in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Act prohibited financial transactions of U.S. persons with North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Libya, Iraq, Syria, and Sudan. All but Syria and Sudan were the subject of existing comprehensive financial and trade embargoes at the time of enactment. In accordance with foreign policy guidance provided to Treasury by State, existing sanctions programs against North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Iraq were continued without change. This permitted the specific policies developed over time with respect to each of these countries to remain in effect, including the exceptions to each embargo dictated by unique humanitarian, diplomatic, news gathering, intellectual property, and other concerns that we have had in the life of these programs. New regulations, known as the Terrorist List Government Sanctions Regulations, were issued to impose the prohibitions on financial transactions with regard to Syria and Sudan. The new regulations, drafted in accordance with foreign policy guidance provided by the State Department, authorized financial transactions with the Governments of Syria and Sudan except for transfers from these governments in the form of donations and transfers with respect to which a U.S. person knows or has a reasonable cause to believe that the financial transaction poses a risk of furthering terrorist acts in the United States. Regulations are consistent with the legislative history of section 321 of the Act. From a sanctions enforcement perspective, the Act and implementing regulations are important, because they provide the Office of Foreign Assets Control comprehensive jurisdiction over all financial transactions between U.S. persons and the Governments of Syria and Sudan. We now have authority, for the first time, to act to stop or impede any particular suspicious transfer to or from these governments by informing U.S. persons handling the transfer that a reasonable cause exists to believe that the transaction may pose a risk of furthering terrorist activity in the United States or any other questionable activity inconsistent with the Act's anti-terrorist purpose. We believe the Act's authority provides a significant new tool in the war against terrorist funding. Thank you. I am pleased to take any questions you may have. Senator Ashcroft. Thank you. Senator Feingold. Senator Feingold. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a number of questions, and let me begin with a few for Mr. Moose. Do you think the regulations developed for section 321 accurately reflected United States policy toward Sudan at the time they were promulgated? Ambassador Moose. I do, Senator. And, again, I think the issue at the time was whether the legislation required the administration to take additional measures with respect to Sudan. The people who were involved in making that determination, the lawyers, particularly at the State Department and the Department of the Treasury, were very closely involved and followed very closely the consideration of the legislation at the time and, indeed, provided our views about the legislation. It was their considered judgment that the regulations issued by the administration were consistent with the legislative history and the legislative intent. Senator Feingold. Let me just follow on that and just ask more generally if the United States considers Sudan to be a rogue State, why should commercial transactions be allowed to take place at all? Ambassador Moose. Senator Feingold, we are obliged, I think, as we can do our work in all of these areas, to make distinctions, and sometimes fine distinctions. As my colleague, Mr. McKune, pointed out, Sudan is certainly an egregious violator of a number of international norms, certainly with respect to its support for international terrorism. And it was for that reason that this administration took the initiative of placing Sudan on the list of State sponsors. We have significant evidence of Sudan's direct support for groups that are involved in terrorism. In the case of others that are on that list, we have evidence that goes beyond that-- evidence of their actual direction, organization and targeting of terrorist activities. Our objective must always be, it seems to me, to take those actions, those measures which we believe have a chance of changing the behavior, the conduct of States like Sudan. In the case of Sudan, one would say that there is at least evidence that they are not immune, not insensitive to the kinds of pressures that we have been able to mobilize, both unilaterally and multilaterally. At the same time, we have made it quite clear that if Sudan's actions persist, if its attitudes and its behavior persist, we are quite prepared to consider tougher measures, both unilaterally and multilaterally. We would much prefer, frankly, to try to mobilize international support, because our experience has been we really want to have an impact, and that impact is likely to be greater if we can organize others to join us in taking those kinds of actions. But I think that we have tried to pursue a tough but calibrated--if you will, graduated--policy with respect to Sudan, with the objective of trying, to the best of our ability, to persuade this government to cease and desist its acts and actions in support of international terrorism. Senator Feingold. Thank you. I will have a question near the end of my questioning, again, on 321. But let me ask you a few questions about the situation in Sudan itself for a minute for background. I understand on April 21, a so-called peace agreement was signed between Khartoum and some of the smaller rebel groups. The Sudan People's Liberation Army did not participate in the agreement. What do you make of this agreement, first? Is there anything new or significant here? Ambassador Moose. Frankly, we are intensely skeptical about the seriousness of the Government of Sudan's intentions here to seek a genuine political solution to the conflict. We have seen, unfortunately, other situations in which the Khartoum Government has sought to engage in half measures, if you will, efforts, not with a serious intent of reaching a settlement, but, frankly, with the intent of deflecting both domestic and international pressure. Our concern about this most recent agreement is exactly that. That concern is heightened by the fact that the Government has not seriously engaged either the principal southern opposition group, the SPLA, nor the broadly based National Democratic Alliance, which is an alliance of both northern and southern groups. The exclusion of those groups from participation in this so-called peace agreement raises in our minds very serious doubts about its viability and about the intent of the Sudan Government. Senator Feingold. Is there anything in that agreement, whether it be lip service or not, that reflects an intention to allow non-Muslims to be able to be free to practice their own religion? Ambassador Moose. There is in that agreement, I think, an important statement of principle that says that the Government would respect the rights of people throughout the country to a certain degree of autonomy with regard to, for example, religious freedom, et cetera. Again, I would say that we need to look at that against the backdrop of the specific actions the Government has taken in the past and the lack thus far of any practical implementation of those principles. Senator Feingold. But you cannot point to any particular actions following up on that? Ambassador Moose. As of this stage, no, we cannot, Senator. Senator Feingold. Could you speculate for a minute, Mr. Moose, about what would happen if the NIF-led Government were to fall sometime soon? What would be your analysis about what would happen in Sudan? Ambassador Moose. Senator, I really do hesitate to speculate on that. I would say that there is nothing in our current assessment of the situation which leads us to conclude that such an event is imminent. On the other hand, we have made it quite clear, in both our public pronouncements and our later actions with the Government, our belief that they need to take actions, not only with respect to the south of Sudan but to the north, that would accommodate the legitimate concerns, grievances of the citizens of Sudan. Whether in fact this current regime could do so and still survive is, I think, a very good question. Senator Feingold. One more question for you at this moment just having to do with our diplomatic relationships there. The United States pulled its embassy staff out of Khartoum early in 1996 and moved some of its embassy's operation to Nairobi because of security concerns. What is the current status of the embassy, and under what circumstances would we reopen the embassy? Ambassador Moose. We did indeed, Senator Feingold, suspend our presence in Khartoum in early 1996 precisely because of concerns about threats to the security of our people at the embassy and our mission. Part of that concern, frankly, was the c"
