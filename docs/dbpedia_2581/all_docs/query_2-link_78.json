Thanks. HG | Talk\n\nI stumbled upon these, while looking for something and then spent more time trying to improve my general knowledge of that time period. I thought I'd make them available for your perusal. I couldn't find the source on a Wiki search, as having been used/found, but I don't know how to search Wiki too well. They look pretty RS to me. [1],[2], [3],[4],[5],[6] and, [7]. I found them enlightening and interesting, but didn't look at all of them completely. I tend to feel that they can be helpful for many articles within our sphere. Regards, CasualObserver'48 (talk) 15:06, 14 May 2008 (UTC) Thread ready to archive, thanks! HG | Talk\n\nI tried to edit the article on Shmuel Yerushalmi, an anti-Zionist poet and activist in Israel, to add details about his arrest and interrogation yesterday over the content of one of his poems; I was surprised to discover that the article had been deleted earlier yesterday. Apparently there had been a deletion review, which ran for five days and attracted just five contributors. An earlier proposed deletion, which had not reached a consensus, ran for twelve days and attracted more than 30 contributors. The proposal had been notified on the list of Israel-related deletion discussions, but not on the list of Palestine-related deletion discussions, where the article also has relevance. Could we establish some sort of procedure for cross-notification of any such proposals, to ensure that more possibly-interested editors are aware and can take part in discussions? RolandR (talk)\n\nI think you can simply post it here, if you wish. does that sound good? --Steve, Sm8900 (talk)\n\nYour best bet is to watch Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Israel and Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Palestine. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs)\n\n- I know nothing of Shmuel Yerushalmi, but if he is currently generating media attention then he may now be notable, and thus merit an article. You can possibly restart the article if notability was the main reason for deletion. See WP:NOTE. See the history link in the linkbar. One can get an article linkbar with wikicode like this: {{article|Shmuel Yerushalmi}} - The talk page will show up via the history link with this linkbar: {{article|Talk:Shmuel Yerushalmi}} . Sometimes these linkbars will pull up a working history page. It looks like this is not true in this case. Maybe because this is a biography page. I don't know. See Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles. Here are the deletion review pages:\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shmuel Yerushalmi\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shmuel Yerushalmi (2nd nomination)\n\nIt looks like notability was the reason for deletion. The last discussion comment was on July 17, 2008. Google has the Wikipedia articles cached, but probably not for long. You might want to save the pages for the time when he becomes notable enough to merit a Wikipedia article. The Simple Wikipedia, and regular Wikipedia articles are slightly different. See:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=Shmuel+Yerushalmi --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nI would like to draw your attention to proposed deletion of the entry Unrecognized villages, which refers to the status of 80,000 Arab citizens of Israel in the Negev. See the talk page, where I had been discussing NPOV issues with User:Ynhockey until the label was pinned yesterday.LamaLoLeshLa (talk)\n\nI have just noticed that User:Guy0307 has also proposed deletion of Negev Bedouins, which refers to the 160,000 Bedouin in the Negev, for the same reason. LamaLoLeshLa (talk) 20:37, 22 July 2008 (UTC) This older thread can be archived, thanks. HG | Talk\n\nCould I bring this article to people's attention? I seem to be in danger of getting dragged into a fight after being accused of \"poisoning the well\" and having an edit reverted. Could some people interested in maintaining impartiality have a look, please?--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nHmmm. Seems quite bizarre. Not sure I comprehend what is going on over there? Some orientation? LamaLoLeshLa (talk)\n\nVery difficult stuff.\n\nHow to deal an article about an association that threatens wikipedia ?\n\nI think we should not mind that article and keep it the way it is.\n\nCeedjee (talk)\n\nWell, my specific issue was over a sentence that said that a report and newspaper articles had described a age as anti-Semitic when the report and one article were written by User:Oboler and the other (in the Jewish media) was based largely on an interview with him. My describign these as Israeli and Jewish sources were claimed to be poisoning the well. But as the report, the most detailed ot these sources says the page is anti-Semitic because it denies the Right to Exist it is hardly an impartial source nd this needed to eb highlighted. I have now deleted the whole sentence.--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nThe archiving and \"hiding\" of the TalkPage is puzzling and confusing to anyone attempting to follow what's going on. Objections were similarly hidden. When the article on the very notable \"Jews Against Zionism\" has been repeatedly deleted it's difficult to understand why an organisation of such minor importance gets an article. PRtalk\n\nIt is clear that \"Jews against Zionism\" is more known that \"JIDF\". It is difficult to argue the \"deletion\" of the 1st and the \"conservation\" of the 2nd. That could be pointed out at next RfD (in a few months!) Ceedjee (talk)\n\nI've now posted to the talk page suggesting pge protection. I've been unable to make sense of one of the replies [8]. Perhaps the editor inquestion is daring people to report them to admin. DO people here think page prot a good idea?--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nI wrote at review page: Keep: As long as there are editors willing to keep on top of it so it does not become a promotional for the guy. And make sure if there is any WP:RS evidence of criminal activity he is put in that category.\n\nDidn't write that we really need a decent category for pro-Zionist \"terrorists\" like there is for Category:Islamist_terrorists and others who engage in criminal activity to promote pro-Israel views. Someone created Category:American_Zionist_terrorists and put Irv Rubin in but he was immediately removed. (He's still in American terrorists.) Category:Terrorists by nationality doesn't even have an Israeli terrorist category though it has a Palestinian one. So who wants to do it? :-) Carol Moore 19:52, 23 August 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc {talk}\n\nI'm confused, Carol. There doesn't seem to be any indication that \"David Appletree\" is a criminal, let alone a terrorist. So why all the talk about putting the article in those categories? — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs)\n\nI shouldn't have merged two different threads. One was reference to possible or potential criminal hacking. And searching around again I did find \"Category:Jewish terrorism.\" Carol Moore 03:16, 24 August 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc {talk}\n\nHi. It's good that folks post, like Peter above, requests for help in dealing with tensions over an article. However, at this juncture, further discussion of the article content should continue on the article Talk page. Right? Thanks. Meanwhile, I've submitted page protection request at WP:RPP to try to get editors into a more productive discussion. Ah, I see that an editor has been blocked, and discussion seems to be moving along. HG | Talk\n\nThis IP user [9] strikes me as an obvious sock puppet operated by someone on one side of the Istael/Palestine conflict. However, I haven't a clue who is operating it. About 70% of the edits are blatant trouble-making. Even legitimate edits such as [10] are captioned in ways that do not WP:Assume good faith. If I knew who was operating the puppet I could report it to the page. But I don't, so can't. So what to do?--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nOk, this IP has been blocked for vandalism. Contact the blocking admin or AIV if you see further incidents. In general, we should be cautious about allegations of sockpuppetry and appropriate procedures are explained at WP:SUSPSOCK. On the other hand, the vandalism was blatant and can be reported immediately to WP:AIV. When in doubt, you might open a conversation with an admin you know (or WP:AN/I) by giving the diffs, not draw conclusions, and asking folks to take a look. My 2 cents. Thanks muchly, HG | Talk\n\nIf I had time I'd make up a few articles like these: Protests against the invasion of Iraq, Opposition to the Iraq War and American popular opinion on invasion of Iraq and Popular opposition to the 2003 Iraq war and Worldwide government positions on war on Iraq. Maybe someone else has time and would like to take it on. ;-) Carol Moore 13:44, 7 September 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc {talk}\n\nExcellent contrast with the paucity of dedicated articles concerning protests, opposition, popular opinion, and government positions on the much longer and far more controversial war and occupation of the Palestinian Territories, also called (euphemistically?) the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.\n\nIt fits the pattern I have long pointed out concerning the lack of dedicated Wikipedia articles discussing human rights violations by Israel in the Israeli-occupied territories. See Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Israel Palestine Collaboration/Archive 3#Human rights in the Israeli-occupied territories and User:Timeshifter#Israeli human rights violations in the Palestinian territories.\n\nThis is an obvious systemic bias of Wikipedia and the Western world. The case has been made about the lack of Western media coverage of the over one million deaths (nearly all are civilians) caused by the war in Iraq, and the lack of coverage of the larger number of civilian Palestinian casualties versus civilian Israeli casualties (I need to update the chart).\n\nIn all these areas Wikipedia should not be reflecting the systemic bias of the Western media, and should make an extra effort to implement WP:NPOV. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nPeople do have to be willing to write, source and defend articles about Palestine and without pay. I'm doing a lot on the broader libertarian quest myself. Carol Moore 00:08, 8 September 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc {talk}\n\nYou're simply ignoring Human_rights_in_israel#Human_rights_record_in_the_Occupied_Territories, the ridiculously long Israel and the apartheid analogy, the detailed Israeli West Bank barrier, and many others. This topic is heavily covered, from all sides. This is, in facts, one of the most heavily covered topics on Wikipedia, providing ample space for even fringe claims. Get your facts straight, before making such claims. okedem (talk)\n\nYour tone, Okedem, of strong assertion, does not substitute for the truth. It is just assertion, as you have done before in our past discussions. For example; \"simply ignoring\" and \"ridiculously long\" and \"heavily covered\" and \"get your facts straight.\" You did not point to any dedicated articles on human rights violation by Israelis.\n\nHuman rights in Israel#Human rights record in the Occupied Territories, is one section of an article on Israel. News flash; for the UN and the vast majority of the world the Palestinian Territories are not considered to be part of Israel. So what little human rights coverage that is in that section is buried in an article most people wouldn't think to look in. Israel and the apartheid analogy and the Israeli West Bank barrier do not focus on the most egregious human rights violations by Israelis. One focuses on apartheid. The other focuses on the barrier. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nWe didn't say they were part of israel. Clearly, your focus is on Israel's actions and alleged violations of human rights. that's why we directed you to the article on israel's human rights record. --Steve, Sm8900 (talk)\n\nThose Israeli violations of human rights should be discussed in Human rights in the Palestinian territories, and not in Human rights in Israel. Putting Israeli violations of human rights there buries it somewhat out of sight, and looks like a POV fork. See Wikipedia:Content forking. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nThe issue of Human Rights, Timeshifter, is dealt with on Wikipedia in articles of the form \"Human rights in X\". This is the way this is done for many a country, including Western Democracies and Third World dictatorships (see Category:Human rights by country). I am not aware of any article detailing human rights violations by \"Syrians\", \"Iranians\", or \"Americans\". The articles are about a country's actions. Thus, following the same format, the issue of human rights violations in the territories, when attributed to Israel, is dealt with in Human rights in Israel. The format isn't holy, but it is the convention here.\n\nWe don't, and won't, have an entire article dedicated to \"the most egregious human rights violations by Israelis\". That would simply be a one-sided POV propaganda article. What we do have, is an article discussing the situation in general, both the good and the bad, both the violations, and the rights that are preserved. But it seems to me you're looking for an attack on Israel, rather than an informative discussion of the subject. okedem (talk)\n\n\"But it seems to me you're looking for an attack on Israel, rather than an informative discussion of the subject.\" Your personal attacks and lack of good faith are against the spirit of this talk page and this WikiProject. You have done this many times before in previous discussions. It seems admins let you get away with it. As I have previously discussed, the logical names for the articles, should be similar to the ones for the categories:\n\nCategory:Human rights in the Palestinian territories\n\nCategory:Human rights in the West Bank\n\nCategory:Human rights in the Gaza Strip\n\nSee also List of human rights articles by country. Disputed territories follow the same naming pattern. See Human rights in Western Sahara. So the names of the articles should be:\n\nHuman rights in the Palestinian territories\n\nHuman rights in the West Bank\n\nHuman rights in the Gaza Strip\n\nHuman rights in the Palestinian territories is not about human rights violations by the Israelis. Imagine that. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nArticles on human rights always include the most egregious human rights violations. Along with some of the lesser ones. It would be against WP:NPOV to include the lesser ones only.\n\nSo Wikipedia is not following the norm in naming the articles, and in following WP:NPOV.--Timeshifter (talk)\n\nArticles on human rights deal with both the good, and the bad. You want an article focusing on \"the most egregious human rights violations\". That will not be done.\n\nYour accusation of \"POV-fork\" seems to be the only lack of AGF attitude here. When that article was started, human rights issues both in Israel and in the territories were all mixed together. The data about the territories was written there (initially) by very pro-Palestinian users, by the way. The issues were sectioned to improve the order, since these are two different points of discussion. If you think that section should become an independent article, I have no objection. But I do object to your constant claims of bias, etc. No one's trying to hide anything, and this topic (the conflict) is among the better covered topics on this project. I'm sick and tired of reading these accusations. No one's at work trying to hide data. You may not like some way things are ordered, and that's fine. But realize, that while you think an article about the territories would be the way to go, other users will claim that moving that data from Israel's article is an attempt to hide Israel's \"crimes\", and that we shouldn't discuss only Israel itself there. That was clear from previous discussions.\n\nInstead of accusing Wikipedia and Wikipedians of bias, you could have just posted a comment saying: \"Hi, I see the issue of human rights in the territories is dealt with inside of Human rights in Israel. I think it would be better to split it to a separate article, what do you think?\". You would have gotten a short, to-the-point discussion. Instead, you chose the accusative route, and got what you asked for. okedem (talk)\n\nThe first thing I said about human rights info in this talk section was this: \"It fits the pattern I have long pointed out concerning the lack of dedicated Wikipedia articles discussing human rights violations by Israel in the Israeli-occupied territories.\" We could waste further time discussing how this happened, and we could guess at the motivations of all involved (which I haven't done), or we could solve the problem. I am glad that you wrote: \"If you think that section should become an independent article, I have no objection.\" By the way, saying that there may be systemic bias does not necessarily imply intention or motivation to hide anything. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nLook, it's all about the attitude and assumptions. There was no editorial decision to not create an article about human rights in the territories. It's just that no one wrote it, and someone did write that info in Israel's article. Try to approach these things without assuming bias or anything, and just make suggestions. You'll find other users are much more receptive if you don't try to tie a specific point to some far-reaching bias or phenomenon.\n\nNow, I did say something about your suggestion, beyond my non-objection to it. I guarantee you this - if you move the territories info from Israel's article to a dedicated article (probably with two sections, for Israel and the PA resp.), you will have claims by others that it's not right to discuss only Israel itself in Israel's article. Some will claim that this is an attempt to hide Israel's actions, and paint a rosier picture. Someone is bound to claim this is proof of Wikipedia's \"Systematic bias\". This will happen, and users will object. If you want to do this, be aware of that, and come up with good reasons to still do this. okedem (talk)\n\nActually, someone did create an article about Israel's human rights record in the Palestinian Territories during the Second Intifada. Here is a detailed revision history of the original page that existed from February 2004 until January 2007: [11] It was under various names, but the admins deleted the page by redirecting the page to Second Intifada. There was no consensus to do that. Here is the last name of the page: . For the whole history please see: User:Timeshifter#Israeli human rights violations in the Palestinian territories. Here is a link to a userspace copy of the original page. As for moving the info from Human rights in Israel, I think the info should be moved into separate human rights articles for the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights. Those articles should cover the human rights record of all parties. If any article becomes too long we can split up that article into separate articles. For example; Human rights in the Palestinian National Authority, Israel's human rights record in the West Bank, and Israel's human rights record in the Gaza Strip. I think Human rights in the Palestinian territories should become a disambiguation page instead of being a redirect as it is now. Currently it redirects to Human rights in the Palestinian National Authority. Here is its history: . --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nSorry, but all that sounds unworkable, and would not add much to the articles. --Steve, Sm8900 (talk)\n\nBy the way, it seems unneccesary to group the record on Israel's treatment of the Palestinians with that of the Palestinian Authority. one is the duly elected representatives of the Palestinian people, the other is an occupying force. there is no comparison or equivalence between the two, and there is no reason to place them on any sort of equal footing. --Steve, Sm8900 (talk)\n\nJust chiming in here: Although one would not normally expect me to agree with Timeshifter on a controversy in this subject area, I do think there is potential merit to the last suggestion in his most recent post. That is, change Human rights in the Palestinian territories from a redirect to a disambiguation page, but only if the links on this disambiguation page are limited to the two relevant \"Human rights\" articles/sections. That is, Human rights in the Palestinian National Authority and Human rights in Israel#Human rights record in the Occupied Territories. That way, someone searching on \"human rights in the Palestinian territories\" will be sure to find a page that lets them choose between the two articles that, at least arguably, pertain to the topic they searched for. (I say \"at least arguably\" because the phrase \"Occupied Territories\" is arguably non-NPOV, and with regard to certain land is definitely non-NPOV, but that is what the Human rights in Israel article contains at the moment, so lets leave that issue aside.) What I don't want to see happen, however, is for that disambiguation page to become loaded up with links to every article that anybody thinks has something to do with human rights, because that will just shift the dispute rather than resolving it. So how about, as a compromise, turning that page into a disambiguation page with just those two items? 6SJ7 (talk)\n\nI get the impression of a muddying of the matter at hand. As is often the case on I-P articles, someone uses language that offends us and then we stop listening to the substance of their argument. I think the issue Carol raised is probably a bit different from that discussed by Timeshifter, and I would like to hear more from her(him?) about this, if possible. Also, although I understand what was written above, I'm unclear about the essence of Timeshifter's proposal, as well as Sm and Okedem's opposition. Timeshifter, could you state your proposal in a sentence, and Sm and Okedem, could you state your reasons for your opposition? Best, LamaLoLeshLa (talk)\n\nLamaLoLeshLa. I think that 6SJ7's idea is a good start. Changing Human rights in the Palestinian Territories from a redirect page to a tightly-focussed disambiguation page would solve many of the problems that I see. That disambiguation page needs to link to 2 articles: Human rights in the Palestinian National Authority and Israel's human rights record in the Palestinian Territories. I think that \"Human rights in the Palestinian National Authority\" should be renamed to \"Human rights record of the Palestinian National Authority\" to make it clearer. There is way too much material concerning all sides to put it all in one page called \"Human rights in the Palestinian Territories.\" So the disambiguation page is necessary. In reply to okedem's concerns about transferring most of the relevant info from Human rights in Israel there can be a summary there that links to \"Human rights in the Palestinian Territories.\" --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nI have no objections to the disambiguation suggestion. However, why even include a summary in Israel's article? Wouldn't that imply, as now, that the territories are a part of Israel? (in general, we make separate articles out of specific sections when they grow too large - but that doesn't change their hierarchy). okedem (talk)\n\nIt doesn't matter to me either way if there is a summary in Human rights in Israel, nor what it implies. Wikipedia does not take sides. People have to make up their own minds. There is material in several articles that can be transferred or copied to \"Israel's human rights record in the Palestinian Territories\". The editors of those articles have to decide whether they want to summarize any of the info in those articles, and how they will link to \"Israel's human rights record in the Palestinian Territories\". See also Wikipedia:Splitting, Wikipedia:Article size, and Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - \"Summary style\" articles. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nIf timeshifter wants, perhaps he can put some material together as a draft version, and maybe that might help us to discuss it more clearly. thanks. --Steve, Sm8900 (talk)\n\nI have proposed a compromise, slightly above, which could avoid a lot of drafting: Changing a redirect page into a disambiguation page, with two items. Details above. 6SJ7 (talk)\n\nLamaLoLeshLa, please re-read my comments. I'm not opposed to the suggestion. I don't really care either way. It's just an ordering question, simple editorial choice, not about content. I am saying there will be opposition from other editors, who will claim that removing the territories info from Israel's human rights article is wrong, and is an attempt to \"hide to the truth\". Believe me, such claims will be made. I only wonder if Timeshifter (or others supporting this move) will be there to argue with those users, or will we end up with Israel's article being full, again, with irrelevant territories info. okedem (talk)\n\nYes, this point I understood - in fact, I would be one of those working hard not to see such information transplanted. But I wonder if there is no contradiction between keeping other articles as they are and what Carol, suggests. I still do not know, however, because I don't know for certain what she is proposing, or for what purpose. I do think more explanation of her proposal is required.LamaLoLeshLa (talk)\n\nTimeshifter sort of hitched a ride on this section. Carol seems to be suggesting an article about international opinions regarding the occupation. I'm not sure such an article is necessary, as we do have a lot of information about that, just in specific articles, regarding specific issues. Israeli-occupied territories seems like the natural place for that. Maybe a section there? okedem (talk)\n\nFurther discussion\n\nIsn't there already an article on this topic? Second Intifada, perhaps? ← Michael Safyan (talk)\n\nAgain, it is not a dedicated article about human rights violations by the Israelis, nor opposition, nor protests, nor worldwide government and popular positions. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nHuman rights violations by israel are not a notable topic. \"Human rights record\" is an encyclopedic topic; \"human rights violation\" is clearly unencyclopedic, with clear political motivations. --Steve, Sm8900 (talk)\n\nBy the way, while we're on the topic, can we create an article like Violations by Israel of every standard of human conduct, decency and democracy? thanks. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Sm8900 (talk • contribs) 16:05, 8 September 2008\n\nIf you want to create it, go ahead. No-one is stopping you. Meanwhile, could you stop (uncharacteristically) maligning the perceived motivations of those you disagree with, and return to the issues? RolandR (talk)\n\nOk, I'll try to do so. thanks for your constructive message. --Steve, Sm8900 (talk)\n\nPerhaps a good start in organizing the material on human rights in the Palestinian territories would be to catalog the existing articles in the categories that have already been defined. For example, the article on Muhammad al-Durrah certainly belongs in the category Category:Human rights in the Gaza Strip, as do the articles on First Intifada and Second Intifada. The article Human rights in Israel should be included in the categories defined, as well.\n\nOnce we have identified all the existing articles on human rights in the Palestinian territories, we will be in a better position to determine whether the information should be reorganized and expanded to make it more accessible.\n\nI certainly agree with Timeshifter that the way the information is currently organized makes it hard for a reader to get a clear or comprehensive understanding of the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories. --Ravpapa (talk)\n\nAs usual, an excellent suggestion from Ravpapa. Doing an inventory by category would help us greatly in filling in the blanks. I'll try to start tagging articles soon. Tiamuttalk\n\nI went pretty much AWOL after starting this thread and in the meantime did learn a lot more about categories, so maybe if I asked the question now I'd start at that point :-) So is \"Category:Palestine\" the best starting point? I noticed a couple categories on Israel under it. I also noticed that none of the 22 categories under \"Category:Israel\" mentioned Palestine. If you dig into some categories, of course, you'll find Arab and/or Palestine mentioned. And I don't know if any articles are in both categories, assuming one digs deep enough.\n\nMaybe the answer to my initial specific question is the creation of a \"Category: Supporters of Palestinian rights\" or something would be good. And then all sorts of individuals and activist groups could be put under it! And there might be more motivation to fill in any missing blanks with relevant articles. :-) Carol Moore 03:49, 18 September 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc {talk}\n\nSee also:\n\nCategory:Palestinian territories.\n\nCategory:Non-governmental organizations involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n\nCategory:Jewish anti-occupation groups\n\nHere is a search of wikipedia that lists categories with \"supporters\" in the name:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=site:en.wikipedia.org+Category+supporters\n\nThose category name search results may help in deciding on similar category names in this topic area. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nAnd these are all under Category:Israeli-Palestinian_conflict I guess one has to study this section carefully. Portal:Contents. I don't think it's as user friendly as could be; \"features\" too far up, sayying index and indexes instead of indices would help a lot of people; maybe I'll comment there. Carol Moore 18:52, 18 September 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc {talk}\n\nThere is an editing dispute on Media coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict regarding this diff.

The current one is much better\"\n\nAnswer to both gentlemen: I dont know you, but I can put it fairly short: It is none of your business. I am here to help the palestinian side getting their Catastrophe (Nakba) portrayed more fairly. They are the underdog, so I take it that Mr. \"Ynhockey\" is not from England, or any places influenced by English civilisation, as i can convey to him, that we take pride in being on the side of the underdog. Israel is the most powerful country in the Mideast and the worlds fourth biggest nuclear weapons stockpile, while we here are dealing with a people, which have been forcefully thrown out of their ancestal home, and whose descendents are often stateless. If these one million people - today more then 2,5 million - had not been thrown out, they would have altered the whole political outfit of the entity that today are refferred to under the term 'Israel'.- and that was ultimately the reason why they were expelled.\n\nAs a matter of course the name of the military operations should be mentioned, as well as the brigades. And I chose the blue colour because it is the lovely israeli blue colour that Mr. \"Ynhockey\" loves so much, so arent you happy Mr \"Ynhockey\"? How the template looked before, and whether \"you\" think it was better, is no business to you, but first and foremost to the palestinians, who like what I have made.Nick Finnsbury (talk)\n\nNick Finnsbury, Wikipedia is not a Palestinian encyclopedia, and comments like the above will not get you very far. Please review WP:CIVIL and WP:DR, and return with a constructive comment on why the template should be kept. I will propose the template for deletion tomorrow if the concerns Nudve and I posted about above are not addressed. -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nNote: I have listed the infobox for deletion here. Comments are welcome on the TfD page. -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nIt is not acceptable to bring up comparisons like these, It shows a selfcentredness to the extreme; the palestinians are the wounded part, who have had their land taken away from them. Think about them : They have to read about 'Shoah and Holocaust' in discussions about Nakba, and some even question the extend and seriousness of it!! Shame on you! Nudwe should have refused to discuss any further once the world 'Shoah' was mentioned.Nick Finnsbury (talk)\n\nI assume we are talking about the 'list of villages depopulated in the(Arab-Israeli war 1948?\n\nThis is based in its entirety of a list of the similar name that exist in an article, that you can find, if you search for it.Nick Finnsbury (talk)\n\nQuote of the day:>That will not get you very far<\n\nSo you have supporters in higher places ready to support you? We will see. If they really do support you, we will have wikipedias bias laid our bare. They will present the israeli view, as very many of the (administrator)editors are honorary descendants of the distingiushed israelites. In a context like the israeli-palestinians one has to apply a meassure of largesse. Israel is the most powerful country in the mideast and number 4 in the world when it comes to possesion of nuclear weapons. What is more, it - and especially its powerful lobby in The United States - are able to steer the worlds only superpower into wars, that is not in its national interest, and that it has to provide the soldiers to as well as foot the bill! So we aggree we are talkinmg about a very powerful country? OKAY. Now if this country and its supporters start to use its influence in editing the history of the palestinians - a poor people that have had their countrey taken awaqy from it wuithout any compensation whatsoever,- that will be the day!!! In that case, I it will be my pleasure, if I cannot venture any further into the realms of this online encyclopedia.Nick Finnsbury (talk)\n\nNick, this is the wrong page to get into this type of discussion. We are trying to \"collaborate\" (not in the Hebrew or Arabic sense) with one another here. I have not looked into the details of the above discussion, but through a quick scan, I can see that you are approaching this issue from a regular talk page perspective. This is not a 'regular talk page', in that at WikiProject Israel Palestine Collaboration we all agree not to violate WP:CIVIL for more than an instant. It's important not to set a precedent for incivility here. Please take this discussion to the talk page YNHockney set up for discussion of the templates. Only come here to make constructive arguments about resolving the issue with community-wide input. Thanks, LamaLoLeshLa (talk)\n\nHe mixes the two templates that I have made, together, to an extend so taht it is impossible to figure out, which one he refers to, and wamts deleted.

Whether you agree with HonestReporting or disagree with HonestReporting, isn't it quite obviously notable enough for a Wikipedia article? Certainly it's more notable than, for example, the Tara Foundation. In any event, whether you think that we should keep HonestReporting or whether you think that the article should be deleted for somehow not being notable enough, the vote is taking place here. Your feedback at that page would be greatly appreciated. ← Michael Safyan (talk)\n\nI would have voted to keep that article too - but let's not fool ourselves, this is not an RS, it's a reckless attack-dog that specialising in poisoning the debate. Our article should be geently leading our readers towards deeply unpleasant articles like this one \"media's favorite Palestinian spokespersons, such as Saeb Erekat - a practiced liar if ever there was one\". PRtalk\n\nI don't know that site, but the name reminds me of all sorts of \"Democratic Republics\", etc... okedem (talk)\n\nIt's a very important organization and notable. I do not share PR's views on it at all. More honest reporting with regard to the issues in Israel is what is needed. They have uncovered a lot of troubling material and bias in the media. The work that they do has brought many newspapers to make many corrections upon being proved wrong by many readers. It would seem to me that if their \"notability\" was in question we could easily find all these corrections (thanks to HR's work) throughout many reliable sources. --Einsteindonut (talk)\n\n(cross-posted at AN/I)\n\nThe CU result found out Saxophonemn and Einsteindonut editing from different locations but using the same user agent.

I amazed by all those cartoons and incivility (Eleland), Mark Twain's irrelevant quote (Saxophonemn) video (Einsteindonut) and Jaakobou (comments directed at Tiamut a few weeks earlier), etc...

And any further provocative comments from any side would be faced with harsh blocks. -- fayssal - wiki up®\n\nInflammatory comments regularly appear and are bound to impinge upon the apparent fitness of editors to edit on difficult topics. However, CIVIL does not ultimately impinge on the product - whereas RS and UNDUE (along with V, OR etc) are at the core of it. Wilfully ignoring these latter policies is a really major problem (always has been). But at least in the past, we were paying lip-service to the concept and control of WP:DE or \"disruptive editing\" - why has that changed? In more and more places, TalkPage discussion is being killed by straightforward denial of what's in the sources (eg here). Honest editors cannot fight this other than by accusing other editors of being parsimonious with the verité - where are the administrators when we need them? (I have run the above example by several, experienced, editors in the project. One of the most trusted has confirmed there is nothing to say that the RS newspaper article in question was ever retracted). I could go to some effort to correct what might (just conceivably) be an honest mistake (as most of my valued helpers would probably wish me to do), but the consequence of doing so is often highly personalised and nonsensical additions from editors who have clearly and repeatedly been told to avoid me. Again, where are the administrators? PRtalk\n\nWe should all shut up and get back to work. There is such a thing also as the dignity of work, and that is what we are supposed to be doing here. Fayssal has said it all. And this is the last I have to say, even if provoked to start another boring thread.Nishidani (talk)\n\nMy last concerns about this template have been buried under a mile of rubble, so I'm re-starting the discussion, with a related issue: on the template {{Villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War}}, two completely irrelevant images exist, but because only 2 editors (Timeshifter and myself) are participating in the discussion, and neither side accepts the other's viewpoint, there is no way to gain consensus. I request that the editors of IPCOLL review the arguments from both sides, and insert their 2 cents about whether these images are relevant, should be removed, or perhaps another idea neither of us has thought of. Thanks, Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nWhile looking around at Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/CAIR_Watch I noticed at CAIR Watch this template which links to this article Controversies_related_to_Islam_and_Muslims which of course is quite biased. Can you imagine if anyone tried to start \"Controversies related to Jews and Israel?\" However, maybe a factual \"Controversies related to Israel\" article would be warranted, if someone else wants to start it. Carol Moore 19:06, 21 October 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc\n\nThis is interesting: Category:Religious controversies. It seems there are whole categories on \"dangerous\" Islamic expansionism. Such as Category:Eurabia, a subcategory of Category:Islam-related controversies.\n\nI don't see an equivalent number of categories and subcategories dedicated to \"dangerous\" Christian expansionism, and \"dangerous\" Jewish expansionism. They are not filled out as much, nor do they cover the political and territorial side of their respective \"dangerous\" expansionisms as much. See: Category:Christianity-related controversies and Category:Jews and Judaism-related controversies. This is a typical Western systemic bias. See WP:CSB. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nI don't see such a big problem with this because it's a simple navigational list, but don't think it should be ethnically or nationally-based. Therefore, 'Controversies related to Islam' or 'Controversies related to Judaism' would be alright, but 'Controversices related to Syria' or 'Controversies related to Israel' would not. My reasoning is that religions are controversial, even the most peaceful ones, and we shouldn't censor something as harmful as a list, and because they are followed out of choice, I don't see this as racist. However, controversies about countries or ethnicities imply that they involve all members of said country/ethnicity, which is clearly racist and inappropriate. -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nThanks for category links. I'm still not great at navigating my way through them!\n\nI don't think controversies about countries are bigoted as long they are about specific acts of governments or businesses or organizations or citizen attitudes statistically supported by reputable polling and other techniques. Obviously some countries have more controversies than others (i.e. Israel many, Norway relatively few) and if there are too many for a subsection, they might deserve an article. I note the Israel article doesn't have a controversies section or even a See Also section. Carol Moore 02:26, 22 October 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc\n\nHere are my two cents on the topic:\n\nA \"controversies\" article is legitimate if:\n\nThe controversy does, indeed, exist.\n\nThe controversy extends beyond extreme/fringe groups and has a scholarly basis.\n\nA \"controversies\" article should not be created to \"take revenge\" or \"counter-balance\" another controversies article.\n\nA \"controversies\" article should be careful to avoid material of extreme/fringe/hate groups.\n\nGiven the above, the subject of the controversy doesn't matter.\n\nI think a controversies article on Israel is perfectly reasonable, since there are legitimate controversies with regard to the political decisions made by the Israeli government. I am more than a little concerned about a \"Judaism-related controversies\" article, though, since I could see such an article easily going into anti-Semitic content. Perhaps a \"Controversies within Judaism\" rather \"Controversies related to Judaism\" article would be more appropriate.\n\n← Michael Safyan (talk)\n\nI strongly object to any such thing. \"Controversies\" is a meaningless categorization. Any such \"controversies\", if they are notable, should be dealt with in their respective topic articles (such as - foreign relations, occupied territories, human rights, settlements, etc.) okedem (talk)\n\n@Michael Safyan - congratulations on summing up the serious danger of one of these proposals and the uncontroversial nature of the other one! PRtalk\n\nQuestion: in this \"controversies\" context, which country would be listed down for the killing of Mughniyeh? Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran, Qatar... ? JaakobouChalk Talk\n\nI agree with okedem. For all X, I oppose having an article called \"Controversies related to X\". All Wikipedia articles describe controversies when there are controversies related to their subject matter (WP:NPOV). If there isn't enough room in the \"Israel\" article for all the controversies related to Israel, then subtopic articles can be split off with specific subtopics. The title of each article should be NPOV. In any article, describing anti-Semitism (or any other POV) is OK if relevant to the topic; writing from such a POV (or any other specific POV) is not OK. ☺ Coppertwig (talk)\n\nFirst, remember this discussion was started because of an existing article Controversies_related_to_Islam_and_Muslims. That was before I was told there was a whole Category:Religious controversies. (Some feel it is biased to include too many articles about-or against-Islam.) So starting a Category:Israel-related controversies and linking to existing articles on the occupation, Dier Yassin, Israel's nuclear program, the Samson Option, USS Liberty, various wars of aggression, etc. etc. is an option. And if someone feels there are enough controversies to add a section in the Israel article and then to spill over into a Controversies Related to Israel article, obviously the usual WP:RS, WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, etc. policies apply. Carol Moore 12:04, 24 October 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc\n\nThis article has been pretty quiet for a while but a couple of POV, insulting editors have come along and started making POV edits and reverting changes, and making no or questionable excuses on talk page. Thus my \"Incident Report\" - October 26: Serious BLP violations on Gilad Atzmon described here. Yet an administrator threatens WP:3RR (3 revert rule] - ignoring Wikipedia:3rr#Exceptions - while refusing to detail his specific concern on the articles talk page! If this keeps up, what options should I pursue of those listed on the main page of this article? Thanks. Carolmooredc\n\nRemoved \"What's Happening report\" on article page because discussion ensued and therefore putting discussion here:Carolmooredc\n\nI must disagree with Carole's summary above. There has indeed been an edit war on the article, but it seems to me that the POV edits and arbitrary (mis)use of sources have come from both sides. It is true that other editors have made uncalled for attacks on Carole in edit summaries, and action should be taken against this. But the issue here is a content dispute, in which Carole and I take different positions. I'm not sure it is a matter for this project. RolandR (talk)\n\nSince Roland hasn't commented on the talk page since May 28, including answering recent comments on his recent edits, I am glad to see evidence he is willing to do so. Also the admin is now denying his repeated reminders were threats. But it certainly does feel like one of those situations that the original Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Palestine-Israel_articles was created to deal with which is why I brought it here. However, obviously I prefer to deal with issues on the talk page, if people are willing to talk and not just revert away. Carolmooredc\n\nI'm concerned about two new templates that have been created/heavily modified by User:Nick Finnsbury: {{Villages depopulated during the Arab–Israeli conflict}} and {{Infobox Arab villages depopulated}}. I have started a discussion about the first in its own talk page. The second one - I just think it's inferior to the previous template, with which there's really nothing wrong. -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nIs the military operation tab in the infobox necessary? Can't the relevant operation be put down as one of the causes of depopulation? -- Nudve (talk)\n\nI agree, but in the end this isn't so important because the entire template is redundant. The current one is much better because it doesn't have any symbols (such as the Israeli CoA), is more compact, and technically far superior (e.g. has optional fields). Moreover, the new template displays clear POV due to its required fields, which are exactly the same fields used by palestineremembered.com, which has long since been branded an unreliable and undesirable source. Similar things can be said about the first template, even though that case is different because there's no current alternative (so it should be modified rather than deleted). -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nYou have a point. Has Nick Finnsbury been informed? -- Nudve (talk)\n\nNot personally, but as I said, I have started a discussion at Template talk:Villages depopulated during the Arab–Israeli conflict, to which Nick Finnsbury has not replied. Not sure what to make of it, but I'll make sure to notify him if it is clear that he won't reply. -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nI have been away on vacation, followed by a frustration-induced wiki-break upon return, but have been back on wiki for a while now, editing and commenting along. This week, I learned that I have been classified as one of the “heavily biased anti-Israel” editors[12] at Wikipedia. I checked the IPCOLL archives for the period during my absence and found this subject has not been raised, so I am raising it, because I feel it significant for this page. I have yet to fully digest the implications of such a classification or my response to it, but I will state the following, simply. I am not anti-Israel, but understand that my life, learning and biases might seem that way to some (and I was overly up-front about that). I am pro-Peace and understand that that bias alone provokes JIDF and their ilk, particularly the post-’67, post-Begin Eretz Israel Zionist zealots. So be it. My noted biases are much different than my commitment to NPOV on Wikipedia where the proof is in one’s article edits, not one’s biases. I can not and will not speak for others; they may or may not do it for themselves.\n\nI want to point out that nine of the 19 listed ‘anti-Israel’ editors (47%) are members of IPCOLL and constitute about a quarter of IPCOLL’s membership. A further 4 listed editors (no overlap) are either named or participated in the RfA that birthed IPCOLL, although many members here can claim that distinction. What does all this mean or foretell; frankly I don’t know. I will surmise that they are suspicious of a) about half the people who ended up being cited in the RfA, b) about half the people who where not cited but defended similar positions, and c) many people who are oppositely POV’d but are particularly willing to collaborate. To me, it indicates an aversion to arbitration, collaboration, WP:AGF and NPOV on JIDF’s part, all basic wiki tenents. It may indicate that other editors with similar alternative knowledge, WP:RSs, bias, and wiki-skills, many of whom are here, will likely end up on the list as it is updated.\n\nI’d be interested to hear and learn what some of the non-listed IPCOLL members think, collaboratively. Happy editing. CasualObserver'48 (talk)\n\nShould I Jewish Internet Defense Force ( admin@thejidf.org ) a snotty message about being genocidal sexists for not mentioning me?? :-) Who do they think spearheaded turning Jewish Lobby into a more NPOV article, with lots of help from my friends. Who has tried to make sure every description of what was said by or about Gilad Atzmon was accurate and source-based? Who promotes a libertarian decentralist view of Israel existing in noncontiguous tiny areas of justly acquired land (10-15%). Who organized 4 of the 5 last protests at the DC AIPAC annual convention? Just look at my contributions you sexist pigs! Give me my day in the sun!!! (They should be glad I'm wasting so much time on wikipedia instead of really causing trouble with serious organizing.)\n\nOn a more serious note, obviously if I had a job where I was worried about getting fired for such editing I'd be worried. And there is the issue of whether to cover their attacks on wiki users in Jewish Internet Defense Force - or to use this as an excuse to delete the article. (I assume it's been through an AfD and helpful to post that link if you have it.) Carol Moore 15:45, 27 October 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc\n\nWell, my name is up there in lights, and I am not amused. The innocuous-sounding \"Doing a simple search for \"Pedrito\" yields [..]\" is, of course, hogwash. Also, the diff showing where I was allegedly \"stripping out important context\" shows me adding context and not removing a single character of text. So apart from being evil, they're also morons?\n\nI used to edit here under my real name but gave it up when I realized that some half-assed crazies, who incidentally don't have the balls to write under their real names, might start accusing me of anti-Semitism, as they have done with other editors. How charming.\n\nCheers, pedrito - talk - 27.10.2008 16:11\n\nActually, I make light of it because even in progressive peace and libertarian groups and email lists there are always those one or two people who scream antisemite at the slightest criticism of the state of Israel -- even if you start by posting articles from moderate Israeli and Jewish peace groups! (Which became my little test to out the screamers in any new email list I might join.) Not to mention if you get a little more hard core. And I'm the type of person who, the more they scream it, the more hardcore stuff I post. (Though it can get tiring, so my engaging in the debate tends to be episodic, like my editing on the topic here.) So unless one has a very public persona and/or hard shell it probably is best to use a handle when editing these articles. But let's face it, if suddenly there were hundreds of wiki editors and millions of emailers and letter writers and protesters willing to tell the WP:RS truth and protest the nonsense, maybe eventually the intimidators would find they'd lost their power and give up. It's just good nonviolent action.

NPR reported that some are calling it a terrorist attack. They have killed many Palestinian civilians in various attacks over decades. They are frequently called terrorists by many reliable sources.\n\nAlso, many of the founding militant organizations of Israel have been called terrorists by Western governments and mainstream media. That means some of the members of these organizations should be categorized under Category:Israeli terrorists. They killed many Palestinian civilians before, during, and after the founding of Israel.\n\nFor many examples of terrorism by Israelis, and by Jewish militants before and during the founding of Israel see:\n\nCategory:Jewish terrorism\n\nCave of the Patriarchs massacre\n\nGush Emunim Underground\n\nJewish Defense League\n\nHaganah\n\nKach and Kahane Chai\n\nIsraeli settlement#Settlements, Palestinians, and human rights\n\nHuman rights in Israel#Human rights record in the Occupied Territories\n\nUser:Timeshifter/Al-Aqsa Intifada Archive.

The assassin of Yitzhak Rabin would certainly count as another example of an Israeli terrorist. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Peter cohen (talk • contribs) 15:32, 30 October 2008\n\nI also just found this:\n\nList of Irgun attacks during the 1930s\n\nSomeone just tried to remove Irgun from Category:Jewish terrorism. See also: History of terrorism#Irgun (1936-1948). --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nPlease read Jewish terrorism - Jewish terrorism is religious terrorism by those whose motivations are rooted in their interpretations of Judaism. Irgun does not fit this. NoCal100 (talk)\n\n(unindent) From Irgun (emphasis added):\n\nThe Irgun was the armed expression of the nascent ideology of Revisionist Zionism founded by Ze'ev Jabotinsky. He expressed this ideology as \"every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arabs and the British; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state\".[1] Initially, a central part of their efforts included attacks against Palestinian Arabs,[2] but it increasingly shifted to attacks against the British. Some of the better-known attacks by Irgun were the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on 22 July 1946 and the Deir Yassin massacre (accomplished together with the Stern Gang) on 9 April 1948. In the West, Irgun was described as a terrorist organization by The New York Times newspaper,[3][4] and by the Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry.[5] Irgun attacks prompted a formal declaration from the World Zionist Congress in 1946, which strongly condemned \"the shedding of innocent blood as a means of political warfare\".[6]\n\nSee also: History of terrorism#Irgun (1936-1948). --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nSince you apparently don't know this, 'Jew' is an ethnicity. The religion you might be thinking about is 'Judaism'. Nothing in the text you quote above suggests that the Irgun's motivations were rooted in their interpretations of Judaism. The article and category is for religiously-motivated terrorism. NoCal100 (talk)\n\nPlease do not make assumptions. See Who is a Jew?. The category is called \"Jewish terrorism\". See Category:Jewish terrorism. The articles listed in that category fit the template requirements at the top of the page. There is no requirement that \"Jewish\" must mean only one definition of the word. Admins don't look kindly on this type of semantic wikilawyering. Are you aware of this?: Wikipedia:WikiProject Israel Palestine Collaboration#ArbCom authorizes discretionary sanctions. I noticed that you also removed the category from List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nI've quoted to you from the article on Jewish terrorism, and will do so again: Jewish terrorism is religious terrorism by those whose motivations are rooted in their interpretations of Judaism. Irgun does not fit this. I notice also that the category used to include a similar clarification (\"This category is purely for Jewish Religious terrorism. \") which someone removed. I will restore that to make it clearer. NoCal100 (talk)\n\nNone of the editors of the category wanted the qualifier. The editor who originally added the qualifier removed it. You put it back just now. See the history of Category:Jewish terrorism. Irgun's motivations are rooted in their Judaism. No amount of semantics changes this. They weren't hiding it. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nI agree with NoCal100 on this. Attacks by the Haganah, Irgun and Stern Group should not be included in a category of Jewish terrorism any more than attacks by Fatah, PFLP or even Hizballah should be included in Islamic terrorism. What we need, in fact, is a category for Zionist terrorism, which could include these and other pages. RolandR (talk)\n\nIs Fatah, PFLP, and Hizballah membership mainly Moslem? Have they committed terrorist acts? If so, then they belong in the category for Islamic terrorists. Haganah, Irgun and Stern Group are all Jewish groups that were trying to create a Jewish state, and they committed terrorist acts. All of the above-mentioned groups meet the criteria of the category template: {{Terrorism category definition}}. There has also been a CFD discussion. See: Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2008 July 25#Unqualified \"Terrorism\". If people want to create more narrow categories, then they need to make the category name itself clearer. Category trees start from the general and then go down to more specific subcategories. So Category:Zionist terrorism would be a subcategory of Category:Jewish terrorism.--Timeshifter (talk)\n\nI think NoCal100 and RolandR are onto something here. The terrorism related to the Northern Irish troubles was at one point reported in Britain as Catholic or Protestant, but was actually between rival nationalisms and was eventually described as either Loyalist or Republican in the British media. Zionism is the nationalism of Jews as Jews and that rather than the religion is what should be labelled. If the religious groups on Israel got beyond shaking their fists and shouting at people who drive on Shabbas and start blowing them up, then that would be Jewish terrorism as a form of religious terrorism. The current classification of the Zionist terrorist as Jewish terrorism laced in turn under religious terrorism is misleading.--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nCategory inclusion is always less nuanced than what articles and lists can do. So we either eliminate \"terrorism\" and \"terrorist\" from category names, or we accept that category inclusion is imperfect. We can point out in the religious terrorism/terrorist category introduction template that just because an organization or individual is included in a category does not necessarily mean that the organization or individual is strictly religiously focussed, nor can all their activities be labeled as terrorist. We can point out the intersection of religion and nationalism, and can add \"see also\" links to some of the nationalism categories and subcategories. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\n(unindent) NoCal100 has been blocked.

Several editors have pointed out the terrorist acts of the Irgun, and a similar organization, Lehi (group). Both on their talk pages, in the edit histories, etc.. Also, at List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s, and at History of terrorism#Irgun (1936-1948). And their talk pages, too. Lehi (group) has been listed for awhile under Category:Jewish terrorism. Only one editor, you, has removed the category recently from Irgun. Editors are discussing the terrorist acts of these groups in several locations, and discussion is fluid and continuing. You are the only editor insistent on removing this category from Irgun. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nThe discussion you are referring to is 6 months old, and it ended with the category EXCLUDED from the article. Please get consensus for your controversial change first. NoCal100 (talk)\n\nThe discussion is 4, not 6 months old, and did not end with the category excluded from the article. So far, nobody has come up with a proper argument why the category does not apply, besides WP:IDONTLIKEIT and some contorted derivatives of it. MeteorMaker (talk)\n\nWhether 4 or 6 month old, it is not a current discussion, and it most certainly ended with the category excluded from the article. It was only very recently re-introduced, on Oct 20, and was immediately removed as inappropriate, by another editor. You don't appear to have read the reason for its exclusion, which has nothing to do with WP:IDONTLIKEIT. The reason is that the category, as well as the article are explicitly for acts which are religiously motivated - and the Irgun's actions are not. NoCal100 (talk)\n\nI think that this discussion might best take place at Wikipedia Talk:WikiProject Terrorism. It certainly was inappropriate that Irgun had no terrorist categories prior to Timeshifter adding one. Whether it was the right one is another matter. I notice that with groups like Red Hand Commandos you sometimes have to follow up the tree to get to a terrorist label. Also that the terrorist label is attached to a state having banned the organisation. It is claiemd (but citation is needed) that the British authorities did label Irgun a terrorist SO if the evidence were produced, that would give a route for labelling the group--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nIs it also inappropriate that PLO has no terrorist categories, despite the fact that the article itself has a lengthy section detailing its terrorist activities? NoCal100 (talk)\n\nThere's a red category label there. Although I think \"former\" is the wrong word and it should be \"formerly\".--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nSo, there's no link to an actual, existing category. Is that appropriate? NoCal100 (talk)\n\nIt isn't hard to create one. Unless you know of a previous deletion.--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nOk, I've fixed it - seems someone used the wring name. Do you know how to get rid of the redlink that's currently there, for a merge discussion started in 2006? NoCal100 (talk)\n\nIt looks like whoever created the cat thought in the same way as me. As far as the other redlink is concerned, can't you just remove it? Or ask about it at one of the village pump pages or something.--Peter cohen (talk)\n\nFor now I will go along with what has been said by Peter Cohen, RolandR, NoCal100, etc.. Category:Zionist terrorism is a better category according to them to add to Irgun, Lehi (group) etc.. Versus Category:Jewish terrorism. I think both categories apply, though.\n\nOtherwise, why isn't the Taliban categorized under some name like Category:Afghani nationalist terrorism? Instead of its current categorization under Category:Islamic terrorism? Both the Taliban and the Zionist groups were oriented towards territory and religion.\n\nI could see why the PLO and Fatah might be categorized in the past under some form of nationalist terrorism category such as Category:Palestinian terrorists. Versus Hamas which is much more focussed on religion. Hamas is currently categorized under Category:Islamic terrorism. Why is Hamas classified under different rules than the Irgun? It is a systemic bias. Especially when you consider that both fought for the same territory, and both are religiously and ethnically oriented. It seems like a double standard to me.\n\nAlso, back to my original question at the beginning of this talk section (see #Category:Palestinian terrorists and Category:Israeli terrorists above this subsection). Where do many of the Israeli settlers fit in? From Israeli settlement:\n\nFurthermore, the term \"settler\" is often associated with the primarily Religious Zionist movement, and other settler populations (such as the Haredi residents of Betar Illit and Modi'in Illit) do not associate themselves with it.[5]\n\nHow do we classify some of the terrorist attacks, killings, and bombings by the more religiously-oriented settlers? --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nAdditional input is sought at Talk:Irgun#Category:Zionist terrorism. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nCFD discussions\n\nThere are a couple current CFD discussions that people might be interested in. Please see these 2 discussions linked below. One is above the other on the same page.\n\nWikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2008 November 4#Category:Palestinian terrorism\n\nWikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2008 November 4#Category:Nationalist terrorism --Timeshifter (talk)\n\n\"See also\" section\n\nNote: The following discussion started at Category talk:Zionist terrorism.\n\nSee [14]. Jayjg removed the \"See also\" section with this edit summary:\n\ncategories don't have \"see also\" section, and the catmain was incorrect\n\n\"See also\" sections are common in categories. For example; see Template:Cat see also\n\nThere is more info at: meta:Help:Category#\"See also\" for categories\n\n{{Catmain}} created a link to Zionist terrorism in the form of\n\n\"The main article for this category is Zionist terrorism.\"\n\nZionist terrorism redirects to Zionist political violence. Click Zionist terrorism to see what I mean. So I moved the Zionist political violence link to the \"see also\" section.--Timeshifter (talk)\n\nThey are not, in fact, \"common\", aren't done the way you did them, and the See Alsos were not helpful in any event. The Template is supposed to be used as you see in Category:The Beatles albums, which has a see also to Category:The Beatles songs, not for wildly different categories. Jayjg (talk)\n\n(Unindent) They are very common. And the fact that you removed all the \"see also\" links speaks volumes. Here is the list of links you removed:\n\nSee also:\n\nZionist political violence\n\nDefinitions of terrorism\n\nHistory of terrorism#Irgun (1936-1948)\n\nNationalist terrorism\n\nReligious terrorism\n\nCategory:Jewish terrorism\n\nCategory:Islamic terrorism\n\nSee also Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Israel Palestine Collaboration#Category:Palestinian terrorists and Category:Israeli terrorists and its talk subsection on Category:Zionist terrorism. All the above links were discussed there. \"See also\" links are supposed to go to clarifying and related articles and categories. They help readers figure out category inclusion rules, and the meaning of category names. They help readers find what they are looking for.\n\nI guess I will have to take this to an admin notice board since we have wildly different experiences in the uses of \"see also\" lists in categories. I have thousands of edits in categories. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nThough you claim that \"See also\" sections are \"very common\" in categories, I have only found them in about 30 categories, and those were all inserted in the past week by you. Do you have any examples of Categories with \"See also\" sections that were not inserted by you? Jayjg (talk)\n\n(unindent) According to Wikipedia:List of Wikipedians by number of edits you have over 65,000 edits. I am listed there with around 15,000 edits. At Category talk:Zionist terrorism you said concerning 'see also' links \"I don't recall ever seeing any, in over four years of editing Wikipedia.\" Maybe this is because you see and remember only what you want to see and remember? Click the \"what links here\" links for Template:Cat see also, Template:CatRel, and Template:See also cat. Also see the over 23,000 results from this Google category search for \"see also\":\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category+%22see+also%22\n\nTemplate:Cat see also is for multiple \"see also\" links.\n\nThe above line of \"see also\" links is produced by this:\n\n{{Cat see also|Zionist terrorism|Nationalist terrorism|Terrorism by genre}}\n\nMost people do not use the template.\n\nSee also:\n\nCategory:Zionist terrorism\n\nCategory:Nationalist terrorism\n\nCategory:Terrorism by genre\n\nSee also: Category:Zionist terrorism, Category:Nationalist terrorism, Category:Terrorism by genre\n\nSee also these categories: Zionist terrorism, Nationalist terrorism, Terrorism by genre --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nThe use of see also templates for category pages ({{Cat see also}} or {{CatRel}}) should be judicious. If there are specific categories that are related and are not sub-categories, then a few links to other categories may be useful., but only of directly related (i.e. not parent or child categories, but obvious ones that can be useful). Also important is to avoid guilt by association. ≈ jossi ≈ (talk)\n\nYou, Jossi, and Jayjg removed many non-controversial \"see also\" links from around 20 categories. In his edit summaries Jayjg said that \"see also\" links aren't allowed on category pages. As shown above he is wrong on this. You went and mass-reverted the same category pages removing many non-controversial \"see also\" links with this cryptic edit summary: \"rm [remove] unusual see also section\". There was nothing unusual about the \"see also\" sections nor the links in them. Nearly all the links met your criteria in your above comment. This kind of mass-reverting is not worthy of admins, especially one such as yourself who has around 70,000 edits according to your user page. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nAs I said, you are welcome to add related categories, but with caution. Some of the \"see also\" you added are stretching the point quite a bit. Please use the templates available for this. Thanks. ≈ jossi ≈ (talk)\n\nThe template is not required, and if you removed the \"see also\" links for this reason, then you need to return those links you find acceptable. You can use the template or not. I leave that to you. You added similar \"see also\" links yourself to some categories, but removed the same type of \"see also\" links that I had added. See this diff: [15]\n\nIf you continue to remove \"see also\" links I add just because you think a template is required, then I guess I will have to go WP:ANI, because it is my understanding that templates are aids to some people, but not requirements. In fact templates can sometimes be a strain on servers. It is like templates for reference links. Most experienced editors don't need them. I have thousands of edits of categories in Wikipedia and the Commons, and this is the first time I have heard someone claim that this \"see also\" template is required. Many of the tens of thousands of \"see also\" links added do not use templates. And the template can not make a vertical list of \"see also\" links anyway. Show me a guideline that says the \"see also\" template is required. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nIf you want to introduce novel formats and purposes for Categories, please get a larger consensus for doing so first. Your \"See also\" sections linking to various articles are nothing like the Catrel templates, which link to related Categories, not Wikipedia articles. Jayjg (talk)\n\nThere is nothing novel about \"see also\" sections. See\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category+%22see+also%22\n\nNearly all the \"see also\" sections you removed from around 20 categories consisted solely of a few related category links. Some also had some clarifying articles linked concerning the definitions of terrorism, etc.. Some of those type of clarifying articles are linked in these templates: {{Terrorist category definition}} and {{Terrorism category definition}}. So maybe you dislike article links in a list versus being in a paragraph. Fine. But nearly all the \"see also\" links you removed were related categories. And you have yet to admit that you were wrong in saying that concerning 'see also' links \"I don't recall ever seeing any, in over four years of editing Wikipedia.\" Now you see.\n\nHow is religious terrorism unrelated to nationalist terrorism? See this diff showing the removal of a single \"see also\" category link: [16]\n\nThere is a long discussion about this relationship here on this talk page. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nPlease explain why they are related, providing reliable sources that make the connection. Also, as you know, the initial issue was with the non-standard formatting of the \"See also\" section, which included links to articles, not categories; please don't make disingenuous Talk: page comments. Please provide examples of Categories that provide \"See alsos\" in a \"vertical list\", with preceding bullet marks. And finally, please stop splitting the conversation up over a half dozen pages, repeating yourself on each page. Pick one page to discuss this, and stick to it; I'm going to start deleting duplicated comments from the others. Jayjg (talk)\n\n(unindent) You are the one initiating most of the further discussion on other talk pages. I am the one linking to here. Stop talking on the other talk pages, and I will not reply to you there. Reliable sources are not required for \"see also\" links in articles or categories. Please stop making up your own set of personal guidelines, and instead quote some Wikipedia guidelines. See\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category+%22see+also%22\n\nand you will see many examples of \"see also\" links in horizontal and vertical form. I can't do all your work. I have thousands of edits in categories. So I know what I am talking about. By the way, I don't answer to you. I answer to the Wikipedia guidelines. Please stop the uncivil ordering tone. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nPlease provide examples of Categories that provide \"See alsos\" in a \"vertical list\", with preceding bullet marks. A link directly to the category, not a Google search that tells us nothing. Jayjg (talk)\n\nPlease see my previous reply. To elaborate further, click the Google search link, and keep clicking the search result links until you see the many formatting variations for \"see also\" links. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nPlease provide examples of Categories that provide \"See alsos\" in a \"vertical list\", with preceding bullet marks. A link directly to the category, not a Google search that tells us nothing. Jayjg (talk)\n\n\"See also\" lists in vertical format on many category pages\n\nHere is a better Google search for finding \"See also\" lists in vertical format on category pages: http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category+%22see+also+category%22\n\nMost of the results have \"see also\" lists in various vertical formats. There are over 7000 results. Some also have article links in the vertical lists. Many have article links in explanatory sentences and paragraphs.\n\nAs I have said previously I have the experience of thousands of edits on category pages, and have seen \"see also\" links in many formats. You might try assuming good faith, and respecting my experience, Jayjg and Jossi, instead of making up Wikipedia guidelines on your own, and uncivilly telling people they have to use certain templates. You don't have the authority to tell people what to do. You can only point to Wikipedia guidelines and policies.\n\nThere is no Wikipedia guideline that requires \"see also\" links in any particular format. Even the words \"see also\" are not required. People use all kinds of introductory words before related category links. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nPlease provide specific examples of Categories that provide \"See alsos\" in a \"vertical list\", with preceding bullet marks. A link directly to the category, not a Google search that tells us nothing. Jayjg (talk)\n\nYour last reply was copied from your previous reply using the same time stamp as before. Your last reply was actually at 02:43, 9 November 2008. See this diff: [17] Did you even read my last reply? This is not the same Google search shortcut. Most of the Google results from this search pull up \"see also\" lists in vertical list form. I can't make you click the Google search result links. Some of the lists have bullet marks. Whether a \"see also\" list has bullet marks, or not, is not important in my opinion. Also, please see Wikipedia:TALK#Good practice concerning overuse of bold formatting on talk pages. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nHave you even been reading my responses? Please provide specific examples of Categories that provide \"See alsos\" in a \"vertical list\", with preceding bullet marks. A link directly to the category, not a Google search that tells us nothing. Jayjg (talk)\n\nLet me be more specific. Click the Google search shortcut. All of the results will be wikipedia category pages. Open the first 5 results in your browser (you can use tabbed browsing). Currently 4 of those 5 category pages have \"see also\" lists in vertical list format. 3 of those 5 category pages have \"see also\" lists in vertical list format with preceding bullet marks. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nHave you even been reading my responses? Please provide specific examples of Categories that provide \"See alsos\" in a \"vertical list\", with preceding bullet marks. A link directly to the category or categories, not a Google search that tells us nothing. Jayjg (talk)\n\nPlease see my previous reply. I already gave you specific examples. Also, I should clarify something after further checking many more Google search results for the second Google shortcut. For those categories with more than one related category link on the category page most are in vertical list format. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nHave you even been reading my responses? Please provide specific examples of Categories that provide \"See alsos\" in a \"vertical list\", with preceding bullet marks. That means a link directly to the category or categories. Jayjg (talk)\n\nSee my previous replies. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nI see them. Not one includes a link to a specific category. Jayjg (talk)\n\nTry following my instructions. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nYou are either unwilling or unable to actually link to a specific category formatted in the way you were formatting categories. It doesn't really matter which is the case; until you actually do so, you haven't made your point. Any further posts that do not contain links to specific categories will be ignored. Jayjg (talk)\n\nI quote a sentence from one of my previous replies: 3 of those 5 category pages have \"see also\" lists in vertical list format with preceding bullet marks. You don't make the rules at Wikipedia, Jayjg. There is no standard format for linking to related categories from category pages. You also don't make the rules on talk pages. If you are unwilling to follow my instructions, then you don't get your question answered. Are you really interested in an answer to your question? If you were, I think you would click your mouse a few times.\n\nThis all started by you trying to impose your standards. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nThere is Category:Palestinian terrorists. There needs to be Category:Israeli terrorists.\n\nPeter Cohen wrote: \"The leaders of the military wings of these groups when they were attacking trains etc. could certainly be labelled as terrorists, as can the perpertrators. The assassin of Yitzhak Rabin would certainly count as another example of an Israeli terrorist.\"\n\nWho else could be listed? I am making a list.\n\nYigal Amir - assassin of Yitzhak Rabin.\n\nBaruch Goldstein - Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. Killed 29, wounded 125.\n\nEden Natan-Zada - fired on a bus, killing 4 people, wounding 22 others.\n\nAmi Popper - lined up Arabs at a bus stop and killed 7.\n\nAsher Weisgan - Israeli bus driver killed four Palestinians and injured two others. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nWhy is Yigal Amir a terrorist and not just an assassin? Are John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald considered American terrorists? — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs)\n\nLikewise, after reading his WP article, I wonder why Ami Popper is a terrorist and not just a racist murderer. Where is the political intent in his murders? the intention to coerce others? Where is the terrorism? — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs)\n\nFurther Israeli terrorists:\n\nMeir Har-Zion - soldier who carried out a private reprisal raid into Jordan. (The article on him is very POV, and needs rewriting).\n\nYona Avrushmi - threw the grenade which killed Peace Now member Emil Grunzweig at a demonstration in 1983.\n\nMoshe Dwek - threw grenade in Knesset in 1957, in protest at the reparations agreement with Germant, injuring David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir and several other ministers.\n\nThere are many other candidates for this proposed category. RolandR (talk)\n\nNew developments\n\nI thought we had reached a consensus that the new categories Category:Zionist terrorism and Category:Palestinian terrorism are acceptable, and can be used to tag organizations which are or were involved in terrorism in the context of the Arab-Israeli conflict. See the discussion above, when Timeshifter introduced these categories, as well as the CFD discussion here. Accordingly, while organizations like Irgun were added to the categories Category:Zionist terrorism, organizations like the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine were added to Category:Palestinian terrorism. Today, however, a couple of editors who did not participate in the previous discussions about the new categories have started removing the Palestinian organizations from the category Category:Palestinian terrorism (see [18] [19]), claiming alternatively that it is a violation of WP:WTA, or that there is no consensus for the new categories. The result is obviously unacceptably POV. I am ok with removing both new categories, but if one is to be used, so must the other. NoCal100 (talk)\n\nThe result of the CFD discussion for Category:Palestinian terrorism was \"no consensus.\" I am now thinking of proposing a name change for all terrorism and terrorist categories. To names such as \"Palestinian terrorism allegations\" and \"Zionist terrorism allegations.\" That is more accurate. There have been many attempts to delete all the terrorism categories, and all have failed. So naming them more accurately may be a better option. It would help avoid BLP problems too. Just like the news media do when they name suspects in murders, etc.. \"Alleged to have murdered so and so.\" See this Google search also:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=%22alleged+terrorist%22 --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nThis is mind bending. I thought about opining on the CFD on nationalist terrorism but only proposing a whole new category system seemed adequate. (Frankly I think the whole thing should be under Category:Patriarchy but don't get me started.) Anyway, problem with \"allegations\" is some people have been convicted of crimes (right or wrong) defined as \"terrorism\" by states. But that's all I can say before my mind boggles at the topic. Carol Moore 18:52, 16 November 2008 (UTC)Carolmooredc\n\nLol. I know the feeling. But then the victors write the history and convict the \"terrorists.\" --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nYou are probably right. \"Allegations\" adds a whole new layer of problems. Since we can't get rid of terrorism categories altogether, I guess I could live with either Category:Ethnic terrorism or Category:Ethnic terrorism allegations as a parent category. See other parent categories at Category:Terrorism by genre. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nMy latest preference is Category:Ethnic terrorism according to some sources. This seems to satisfy WP:TERRORIST better. It takes the use of the word \"terrorism\" out of the narrative voice of Wikipedia. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nFor those who are interested; terrorism, state terrorism, terrorism categories, etc. are being discussed in a more tangible way at Talk:Irgun#Category:Zionist terrorism. --Timeshifter (talk)\n\nSo, until such time as we either rename all terrorism and terrorist categories, or delete them all, can we agree that while they exits in their current format, we do not depopulate certain categories in a non-neutral way? NoCal100 (talk)\n\nRecently I've been trying to add some context to articles on Palestinian attacks on Israelis, much in the same way that we have it in the articles on Israeli military interventions. Things are getting a bit sticky on\n\nSbarro restaurant suicide bombing (talk)\n\nand I was wondering if some more experienced editors could get involved to keep things balanced.\n\nCheers and many thanks, pedrito - talk - 30.10.2008 14:41\n\nWe could indeed use some help here, as the \"context\" Pedro is adding in many of these article sis based on either his original research, or uses unreliable sources. NoCal100 (talk)\n\nBoth posters in this thread are now blocked, partially for activities on the page concerned here. Anyone care to discuss over at the talk page?--Peter cohen (talk)\n\n2-3 years ago I added some information to the history-section in Karmiel, information sourced in a book by Sabri Jiryis (which in turn was largely based on research done by Uri Davis) AFAIK, nobody has questioned the accuracy/truth of the information given by Jiryis.\n\nEarlier this month most of that information was removed, and now it is argued that Sabri Jiryis and Uri Davis are not WP:RS. Please see the discussion on Talk:Karmiel.\n\nMore eyes are needed here, IMO. Please voice your opinion. Thank you. Regards, Huldra (talk)\n\nJust for the record, there is no evidence that Huldra's additions to the article were based on research by Uri Davis, and he has failed to provide a draft (which I requested) with information based directly on works by Davis and not Jiryis. Also for the record, I didn't argue Uri Davis's validity as a WP:RS in general, just for the purposes of historical information, because Davis is not an historian (similar to Chomsky for example, who would be WP:RS for linguistics, but not for history). -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nJust for the record:Ynhockey has failed to respond to my requests here, specifically he object to Jiryis because he was a politician in the Palestinian legislature. One of my question is: does he also object to using Benvenisti´s work ..and all other writes who ever had a political position? The rest of the argument I will take on the Karmiel-talk -page, I will just note here that the information had been in the article for more than two years without anybody protesting before user:Gilabrand removed it and then went and canvassed support from Ynhockey for the removal. (Oh, and for what it is worth: I´m a she. Huldras always are!) Regards, Huldra (talk)\n\nSorry, you're dead wrong on that puritanical reading of RS, certainly with the Chomsky case. Wikipedia I/P articles are sourced to newspaper articles written by journalists who are not historians, nor, for that, particularly good journalists, but the newspapers, being mainstream, are RS. I gave a list sometime back of 16 top scholars in every major area of modern thought who were not qualified in disciplines where they distinguished themselves, i.e. Claude Lévi-Strauss studied law and philosophy, and got a degree in the latter. He became one of the foremost anthropologists in the world. Joseph Needham's only qualification was in biochemistry, he was one of the greatest sinologists of his time. One of the best articles on Ithaka is writen by a businessman, one of the world's authorities of hallucinogenic mushrooms was a banker, the list is endless. Chomsky's primary qualification is in linguistics (specializing in Hebrew), and has written several substantial works on I/P issues that are, in turn, frequently sourced by area specialists, in dissent or agreement. Chomsky, apart from the Cambodian interlude, is not criticized by his adversaries for bad citation of the abundant evidence, but for his interpretation of that evidence. The evidence he has is eminently citable for I/P articles.\n\n(2) If that reading were true, then you and many others are extending an open invitation to all editors of any persuasion to systematically elide any reference in I/P articles to Alan Dershowitz's Case for Israel, to cite one of a good many examples. He's a professor of law (and as an historian notoriously bad). These rules were aimed to keep outerratic sourcing by overeager kids or POV-pushers, not to make citation of strong interpretive works by scholars of world standing (Dershowitz in law, Chomsky in linguistics) impossible.Nishidani (talk)\n\nNeither Dershowitz nor Chomsky are historians and shouldn't be used for I-P articles. Please read exceptional claims require exceptional sources, and since almost everything in this field is an exception claim, we must be very careful with sources. IMO, mainstream media's use as sources should also be reduced, but it is generally much more reliable than both Chomsky and Dershowitz, who have clear political agendas, aside from not being historians. -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nOne problem with your argument, Ynhockey, is that the writing in this case isn´t an \"exceptional claim\", as you claim. Indeed, the construction of Karmiel closely follows that of Nazareth Illit, please read the history-part of that article. Regards, Huldra (talk)\n\nI don't think you are aware of what you are implying. Do you mean I have to go immediately, to cite one of several hundred pages, and names, and wipe Dore Gold and Mitchell Bard off the Jerusalem Page because they are cited there on issues they have no technical expertise in? It means Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre should be removed from that page as well, including all wiki pages dealing with 1948? WP:REDFLAG has nothing to do with the argument. I never mentioned exceptional claims at all.) Your claim here means that probably a third of the sources used in I/P articles have to be elided, since you are saying only someone qualified in a subject with formal academic credentials can be cited on that subject, a rule I would approve off, but which is never applied. As to having a political agenda, many historians, Efraim Karsh, Benny Morris, Bernard Lewis etc. have them. In any case, if you wish, I will over the next few months review all pages I am interested in, using your rule, and direct you to all sources which according to your reading here, must be erased. The list is huge. In the meantime I look foreward to you removing those four names from the Jerusalem article. The final irony is that we have now, on the grounds you exclude Chomsky, to ban Walter Laqueur from I/P pages, though he is regarded as an accomplished historian. He never got a degree in the subject.Nishidani (talk)\n\nYnhockey did not say the problem with Chomsky was that he had no degree in the subject, but that he was not a historian. Chomsky, like Dershowitz, is a figure who has gained respect, fame, and recognition in another professional area, and has also written polemically about the I-P conflict. They are not historians, nor are Jiryis or Davis, unlike Laqueur, who is one. Please desist from making straw man arguments. Jayjg (talk)\n\nStrawman links seem to be your Pavlovian shorthand for 'I haven't got an adequate argument to reply to you'. You're quite entitled to a personal opinion, as is Ynhockey. But it is irrational, and an abuse to apply one strict reading of WP:RS to elide 'pro-Palestinian' sources, while doing nothing to extend the same strict interpretation to 'pro-Israeli' sources, as you do customarily. That is gaming the system. Note that there is no answer from either of you to the inconsistency pointed out. Laqueur is not a qualified historian: he writes historical books. Chomsky is not a qualified historian, he writes historical books. You are both profoundly inconsistent, and should reflect on this. I would be happy if the strict criterion both you and Ynhockey promote, were policy. I happen to approve of much of Ynhockey's work, but if this strict reading is not extended to the huge amount of sourcing not derived from professional scholars used by 'pro-Israeli' editors as well in the future, then a grave inconsistency in judgement will become apparent. I trust he will take care to maintain consistency in the matter.Nishidani (talk)\n\nI can't see how you worked out the last point. Most historians in this field are anti-Israel, and neither of us has worked to remove their content. I think the best example is Khalidi, who constantly attacks Israel and writes only about the bad things Israel and Israelis have done. Even so, he's an historian, and Chomsky, Dershowitz, Davis and Jiryis are not. -- Ynhockey (Talk)\n\nNishidan, please try to focus on the points under discussion, rather than other editors, or on straw man statements unrelated to reality. The reason why contentious historical claims by non-historians are excluded is because they are non-historians, not because they are anti-Israeli. In addition to the many books of history he has written, Laqueur was Director of the Institute of Contemporary History and the Wiener Library in London for 30 years, and has been a visiting professor of history and government at Harvard, University of Chicago, Tel Aviv and Johns Hopkins University. Chomsky, like Dershowitz, writes polemical works about historical situations; that is not being a historian. Jayjg (talk)\n\nYnhockey Historians are not 'anti-Israel' for criticizing many aspects of Israel's history or policy, any more than American or Italian, or German historians of their own country's history are 'anti-America', 'anti-Italy' or 'anti-Germany'. (2) You have, as Jayjg doesn't have, an answer to my point. Walter Laqueur and several other widely cited 'historians' are not qualified. They are considered historians because they write books with historical content, as do Chomsky and many others. Jayjg's point on Laqueur's record is 'historian is as historian does', which means those who write historical books that are widely read by the public and by specialists, are, ipso facto, historians (aside from being other things). If anything Chomsky is a specialized historian, writing the history of reportage of events, interleavened by many references to the standard histories of Israel and Zionism in both Hebrew and English. I note that neither of you have said a word about the presence on the Jerusalem page of several sources not written by historians.Nishidani (talk)\n\nNo, Nishidani, they are considered historians because they write works of history, and because they have other qualifications, as described above, but which you pointedly ignore. Chomsky isn't a \"specialized\" historian; he does no historical research of his own. Rather, he writes polemical political commentary about historical situations, which is quite another thing. You keep ignoring these points, and instead creating straw men about degrees, etc. It's not that we don't \"have an answer to [your] point\", but rather that you refuse to hear it. As for other claims, if they are historical and contentious, they would best be sourced to historians, but in any event are best raised on the Talk: pages of the relevant articles. Jayjg (talk)\n\nSorry, Jayjg, but having a university appointment is not a 'qualification' in the academic sense. As to your commentary on Chomsky's historical works, I know that you reached p.7 of a Chomsky Reader. I have had no evidence of your familiarity with his work. He has written a history, with great detail from primary reportage and secondary sources, of Israel's relations with other Middle Eastern States. I'll throw refuse to hear it back at you. I see, though you have been pointed to the fact, no move by either of you to remove from the Jerusalem page several sources that come from non-historians, though cited as authoritative on aspects of the city's history. This is an incongruency (one of thousands) and until I see action on this, I will continue to insist you, and many others, are inconsistent in your use of policy, which looks tactical (strong reading on Palestinian sources/lenient reading on pro-Israeli sources). This is the proper page to discuss this, being generically devoted to a project of collaborative understanding. The issue is one of principles to be applied universally, and not according to tactical POV advantage. Consistency on application of policy will always find in me an ally. Ni"
