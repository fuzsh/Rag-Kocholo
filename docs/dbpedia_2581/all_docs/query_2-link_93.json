        "text": "Seen: ICOP member Mr. Jim Stamm (Tucson, Arizona) said:\n\nLocation = Tucson, Arizona (USA)\n\nLongitude = 110.9645 W\n\nLatitude = 32.4204 N\n\nElevation = 842 meters\n\nTime Zone = -7.0 hours\n\nSurface conditions at time of first/last sighting at\n\nTucson International Airport (805 m):\n\nTemperature = 84 degrees F\n\nRelative Humidity = 13 percent\n\nSea Level Pressure = 1007 mb\n\nScattered clouds, but not a problem.\n\nTopocentric and local time values from “Accurate Times”:\n\nSunset (at sea level) = 19:27\n\nMoonset (at sea level) = 20:13\n\nTime from new moon at 19:47 = 15 hr. 36 min.\n\nMoon lag time = 46 min.\n\nRelative Altitude = 8.27 degrees\n\nElongation from sun = 8.28 degrees\n\nCrescent width = 10 arc seconds\n\nIllumination = 0.52 percent\n\nCrescent first observed through 8” SC telescope:\n\nTime = 19:29\n\nAltitude = 5.9 degrees\n\nFinal observation with telescope:\n\nTime = 19:45\n\nAltitude = 3.0 degrees\n\nThis was a difficult observation. The crescent never got as distinct as my record time observation. Initial view (19:29) was about 10 degrees in arc length. 15° at 19:31; Hints of extensions at 19:34; 40°-50° at 19.36; I could not see the entire arc at once. I had to scan with my eye. However, the entire arc was illuminated, some sections brighter than others. 60° at 19:40; 70° at 19:42; 80° at 19:43; 90° at last observation (19:45). The brightest part of the illuminated arc was not visible until about halfway into the observation. I did not realize the significance of this phenomenon at the time, and did not time its appearance. I do not know if the \"bright\" section of the arc (a few degrees at most) was due to albedo, or an illusion due to surface features - i.e. a wider part of the arc.\"\n\nSeen: ICOP member Mr. Hossein Janghorbani said:\n\nFrom: The Astronomy and Geophysics Centre Of Shahreza & Women Astronomy and Geography Society of Isfahan Province\n\nReporter: Hossein Janghorbani, manager of the center\n\nWe saw the new moon crescent on Monday May. 25th .2009(04/3/1388 according to Iran calendar), in a region located in the east of Shahreza with these geographic coordinates:\n\nLat: 32° N\n\nLon: 51° 52' E\n\nEle: 1825 m\n\nTime Zone: +3.5\n\nThe first observation of crescent parameters:\n\nBy: Ali Janghorbani\n\nThrough: 15x70 binocular\n\nTime: 20:01 LT\n\nMoon Alt: 13.661\n\nElongation: 15.228\n\nMoon Phase: 1.99%\n\nMoon width: 0.58m\n\nRel Azi: -3.555\n\nMoon Age: 27h 21m\n\nThe first observation of crescent parameters:\n\nBy: Ali Janghorbani & Meysam Safian\n\nThrough: eye\n\nTime: 20:10 LT\n\nMoon Alt 11.982\n\nElongation: 15.310\n\nMoon Phase: 2.01%\n\nMoon width: 0.59m\n\nRel Azi: -3.812\n\nMoon Age: 27h 30m\n\nThe group was divided two and all of them observed the crescent\n\nThe group members:\n\n1.
