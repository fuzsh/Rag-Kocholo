        "text": "The keys of institutional cartography are at the service of your information. How a topographic map can be an effective civic tool for citizens' expression and education? Institutional Topographic Mapping, usually implemented and handled by States or armies, has been carried out from April 2008 through November 2011 in a Palestinian village-Battir, which is today a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Danger. The field survey and the topographic mapping was carried out by a team of young Palestinian architects-joined later by a Battiri civil-engineer, under the direct supervision of international landscape planners. Crafting a topographic map is like producing an iceberg. Maps users usually observe, enjoy and get appropriation of a map, as the result of a tedious work which is the submerged part of the iceberg. The variety of skills, the amount of work and the endless time consuming steps, as well as the commitment of the cartographer to produce the best possible map, lie under the waterline and thus are most often ignored. This work is a complex one: we, cartographers, do it, but rarely explain it to the public. This is the goal of les Cafés-cartographiques; to share the work below the waterline, and display it to all, adults youth and children, in a simple manner. In Battir, the aforementioned team, without a cartographic professional background and outside any professional cartography framework, experimented these complex operations from land surveying to map editing; they offered to the world an unprecedented cartographic system characterizing a denied legacy and calling for its recognition and protection worldwide. A masterpiece has been created, overflowing all usual standards in cartography, opening with no warning to a universal topographic adventure which started in May 2012. These maps are today a worldwide learning model crafted through data, which highlights with accuracy the diversity and the richness of spaces, knowledge, agricultural cultivations maintained through a thousand-of-years old practice in Palestine.\n\nMaps are considered to be an ultimate expression of modernity. Empirical cartography plays a central role in daily governance, and it also has a long history of furthering displacement and erasure. In this article I argue that the landscapes of historic British colonialism and the ongoing Israeli occupation influence the digital maps made by the Palestinian Authority. Through an investigation into the borders, roads, and urban areas of one such map and its related scientific practices, I analyze how knowledge of the occupation is shaped by the occupation. Drawing upon widespread Palestinian efforts to strengthen sumud (steadfastness), I develop the concept of stasis as the ability to remain in place. Researchers have rightly pointed to restrictions on Palestinians’ movements, but greater attention should be paid to attempts to limit stasis, both within and beyond the West Bank. The detailed study of mobility and stasis, as well as other material asymmetries of research, can enable more imaginative maps and more heterogeneous passages for the production of knowledge."
