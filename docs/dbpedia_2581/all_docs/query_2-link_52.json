        "text": "When to Observe Ramadan Waxing (NEW) Crescent ?\n\nThe geocentric conjunction (Geocentric New Moon) will occur Inshalla on (Friday 22 September 2006) at 11:45 UT.\n\nSighting the new crescent on (Friday 22 September 2006) and on (Saturday 23 September 2006) is shown in the below graphs using the program Accurate Times by Mohammad Odeh according to Odeh criterion. Where:-\n\nIt is impossible to see the crescent from the areas located under the red color. Because either the Moon on this day sets before the Sunset and/or the topocentric conjunction occurs after the Sunset.\n\nThe crescent is expected to be seen by optical aid only from the areas located under the blue color.\n\nThe crescent is expected to be seen by optical aid from the areas located under the magenta color. In these areas the crescent could be seen by naked eye if the atmospheric conditions are superb and the observer is experienced.\n\nThe crescent is expected to be easily visible by naked eye from the areas located under the green color.\n\nThe crescent can not be seen from uncolored areas, even though the Moon sets in these locations after the Sunset and the topocentric conjunction occurs before the Sunset, but the Moon is not sufficiently illuminated in order to be seen as crescent even by optical aid.\n\nKindly notice that the below graph shows the possibility of seeing the crescent from areas between 60 degrees north of Equator down to 60 degrees south of Equator.\n\nFriday 22 September 2006\n\nSaturday 23 September 2006\n\nAccording to the actual sighting of the crescent, the start of Ramadan should be on Sunday 24 September 2006 in most parts of the world, or on Monday 25 September 2006 in some northern parts of the world.\n\n- Results of seeing the crescent, and the first day of the month in different countries will be added here Inshalla as we receive the reports from ICOP's members.
