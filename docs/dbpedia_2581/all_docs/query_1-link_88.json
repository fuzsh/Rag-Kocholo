Computer simulations were adopted to evaluate design specifications and desired performance of atomic force microscope (AFM) probes; the fabrication processes were guided by feedback from simulation results. Through design-simulation-fabrication iterations, tipless cantilevers and tapping mode probes were successfully made with errors as low as 2% in designed resonant frequencies. For tapping mode probes, the probe tip apex achieved a 10 nm radius of curvature without additional sharpening steps; tilt-compensated probes were also fabricated for better scanning performance. This method provides AFM users improved probe quality and practical guidelines for customized probes, which can support the development of novel scanning probe microscopy (SPM) applications. -- Research highlights: â We developed a design-simulation-fabrication strategy for customized AFM/SPM probes and demonstrated the results of tipless cantilever, sharpened probe tip, and tilt-compensated probe. â This simulation-aided method improved the geometry control and performance prediction of AFM probes; the error in resonant frequency was reduced to â¼2%. â Integration of simulation in design and fabrication of AFM probes expedites development of new probes and consequently promotes novel SPM applications.\n\nDesign and fabrication methods of FW/blanket, divertor and vacuum vessel for ITER\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIoki, K.; Barabash, V.; Cardella, A.; Elio, F.; Ibbott, C.; Janeschitz, G.; Johnson, G.; Kalinin, G.; Miki, N.; Onozuka, M.; Sannazzaro, G.; Tivey, R.; Utin, Y.; Yamada, M.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nDesign has progressed on the vacuum vessel, FW/blanket and Divertor for the Reduced Technical Objective/Reduced Cost (RTO/RC) ITER.

Two related studies of digital fabrication in education are presented in the paper. In an observational study we...... found that students (eleven to fifteen) lacked an understanding of the complexity of the digital fabrication process impeding on the potentials of digital fabrication in education. In a second explorative research through design study, we investigated how a focus on design thinking affected the students...\n\nPropulsion Design With Freeform Fabrication (PDFF)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarnes, Daudi; McKinnon, James; Priem, Richard\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe nation is challenged to decrease the cost and schedule to develop new space transportation propulsion systems for commercial, scientific, and military purposes. Better design criteria and manufacturing techniques for small thrusters are needed to meet current applications in missile defense, space, and satellite propulsion. The requirements of these systems present size, performance, and environmental demands on these thrusters that have posed significant challenges to the current designers and manufacturers. Designers are limited by manufacturing processes, which are complex, costly, and time consuming, and ultimately limited in their capabilities. The PDFF innovation vastly extends the design opportunities of rocket engine components and systems by making use of the unique manufacturing freedom of solid freeform rapid prototype manufacturing technology combined with the benefits of ceramic materials. The unique features of PDFF are developing and implementing a design methodology that uses solid freeform fabrication (SFF) techniques to make propulsion components with significantly improved performance, thermal management, power density, and stability, while reducing development and production costs. PDFF extends the design process envelope beyond conventional constraints by leveraging the key feature of the SFF technique with the capability to form objects with nearly any geometric complexity without the need for elaborate machine setup. The marriage of SFF technology to propulsion components allows an evolution of design practice to harmonize material properties with functional design efficiency. Reduced density of materials when coupled with the capability to honeycomb structure used in the injector will have significant impact on overall mass reduction. Typical thrusters in use for attitude control have 60 90 percent of its mass in the valve and injector, which is typically made from titanium. The combination of material and structure envisioned for use in\n\nMITG test assembly design and fabrication\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSchock, A.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe design, analysis, and evaluation of the Modular Isotopic Thermoelectric Generator (MITG), described in an earlier paper, led to a program to build and test prototypical, modules of that generator. Each test module duplicates the thermoelectric converters, thermal insulation, housing and radiator fins of a typical generator slice, and simulates its isotope heat source module by means of an electrical heater encased in a prototypical graphite box. Once the approx. 20-watt MITG module has been developed, it can be assembled in appropriate number to form a generator design yielding the desired power output. The present paper describes the design and fabrication of the MITG test assembly, which confirmed the fabricability of the multicouples and interleaved multifoil insulation called for by the design. Test plans, procedures, instrumentation, results, and post-test analyses, as well as revised designs, fabrication procedures, and performance estimates, are described in subsequent papers in these proceedings\n\nCompound Half-Backed Weave Design For Digital Jacquard Fabric\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Meng; Zhou, Jiu\n\n2017-12-01\n\nBased on layered-combination design mode and compound structure, this paper presents a design method, named compound half-backed weave in order to achieve innovating weave structure and surface effect of fabric. This design method includes primary weaves chosen, half-backed technical points set up and half-backed weave databases established. The fabric produced using compound half-backed weave designed by this method can exhibit a unique half-backed effect that only half of the threads on the fabric surface remain in a state of being covered by adjacent wefts. Compound half-backed weave can not only meets the design need of jacquard fabric with different digital images and effectively improves the efficiency of structural design, but also puts forward new theory and method for innovative design of digital jacquard fabric.\n\nLOFT fuel modules design, characterization, and fabrication program\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRussell, M.L.\n\n1977-06-01\n\nThe loss-of-fluid test [LOFT) fuel modules have evolved from a comprehensive five-year design, characterization, and fabrication program which has resulted in the accomplishment of many technical activities of interest in pressurized water reactor fuel design development and safety research. Information is presented concerning: determination of fundamental high-temperature reactor material properties; design invention related to in-core instrumentation attachment; implementation of advanced and/or unique fuel bundle characterization techniques; implementation of improved fuel bundle fabrication techniques; and planning and execution of a multimillion dollar design, characterization, and fabrication program for pressurized water reactor fuel\n\nDesign, fabrication, and test of a steel spar wind turbine blade\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSullivan, T.

Topics range from fuel types and the irradiation behavior of fuels to cladding and duct materials, fuel element design and modeling, fuel element performance testing and qualification, and the performance of water reactor fuels. Fast reactor fuel elements, research and test reactor fuel elements, and unconventional fuel elements are also covered.

The deep reactive ion etching process with a laboratory-made etcher was utilized to fabricate PC structures of the AT-cut quartz Lamb wave resonator. The finite element method was adopted to calculate the PC band structure, effective reflective distance from the PC boundary and further the resonant modes and admittance of the phononic Lamb wave resonant cavity. Through the comparison studies between the experimental and simulated results, a design process for the AT-cut quartz phononic Lamb wave resonator was proposed. It is noted that by using the phononic reflectors, the size of the Lamb wave resonator can be reduced significantly.

The mathematical model with matrix method employs three essential elements of chain notation, threading and Jacquard designing. With this model, the processing to design warp-knitted jacquard spacer fabrics with CAD software is also introduced. In this study, the sports shoes which have separated functional areas according to the feet structure and characteristics of movement are analysed. The results show the different patterns on Jacquard spacer fabrics that are seamlessly stitched with jacquard technics. The computer-aided design method of warp-knitted jacquard spacer fabrics is efficient and simple.\n\nSlippery liquid-infused porous surfaces fabricated on aluminum as a barrier to corrosion induced by sulfate reducing bacteria\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang, Peng; Lu, Zhou; Zhang, Dun\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ Slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) were fabricated over aluminum. â¢ SLIPS depress the adherence of sulfate reducing bacteria in static seawater. â¢ SLIPS inhibit the microbiological corrosion of aluminum in static seawater. â¢ The possible microbiological corrosion protection mechanism of SLIPS is proposed. - Abstract: Microbiological corrosion induced by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) is one of the main threatens to the safety of marine structure. To reduce microbiological corrosion, slippery liquid infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) were designed and fabricated on aluminum substrate by constructing rough aluminum oxide layer, followed by fluorination of the rough layer and infiltration with lubricant. The as-fabricated SLIPS were characterized with wettability measurement, SEM and XPS. Their resistances to microbiological corrosion induced by SRB were evaluated with fluorescence microscopy and electrochemical measurement. It was demonstrated that they present high resistance to bacteria adherence and the resultant microbiological corrosion in static seawater\n\nDesign and fabrication of aspherical bimorph PZT optics\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nTseng, T C; Yeh, Z C; Perng, S Y; Wang, D J; Kuan, C K; Chen, J R; Chen, C T\n\n2001-01-01\n\nBimorph piezoelectric optics with a third-order-polynomial surface is designed and a prototype is fabricated as active optics. Two pairs of silicon (Si) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramic are bonded as Si-PZT-PZT-Si together with a multi-electrode or thin film resistor coating used as the control electrode between Si and PZT and metallic films as grounding between the interface of PZT ceramics. A linear voltage is applied to the bimorph PZT optics by probing the control electrodes from a two-channel controllable power supplier. In doing so, the optics surface can achieve a desired third-order-polynomial surface. Reducing hysteresis and creep in bimorph PZT X-ray optics is the only feasible way by inserting an appropriate capacitor in series with bimorph PZT optics to significantly reduce both effects.\n\nDesign and fabrication of the MFTF-B magnet system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTatro, R.E.; Kozman, T.A.\n\n1985-09-01\n\nThe MFTF-B superconducting magnet system consists of 40 NbTi magnets and two Nb 3 Sn magnets. General Dynamics (GD) designed all magnets except for the small trim coils. GD then fabricated 20 NbTi magnets, while LLNL fabricated 20 NbTi magnets and two Nb 3 Sn magnets. The design phase was completed in February 1984 and included the competitive procurement of magnet structural fabrication, superconductor, G-10CR insulation, support struts and bearings, vapor-cooled leads, and thermal shields for all magnets. Fabrication of all magnets was completed in March 1985. At GD, dual assembly lines were necessary during fabrication in order to meet the aggressive LLNL schedule. The entire magnet system has been installed and aligned at LLNL, and Tech Demo tests will be performed during September-November 1985\n\nDESIGN AND FABRICATION OF MICRONOZZLES\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKean How Cheah\n\n2011-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Normal 0 false false false EN-US ZH-CN X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\"; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:SimSun; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} Micronozzle, a key component in micropropulsion system, has been designed and fabricated. Quasi 1D inviscid theory was used in designing a series of conical micronozzles of different expander half-angles (10Â°-50Â°. Aerospike micronozzle, a promising candidate to achieve high performance propulsion system, was designed with Angelino method (or Approximate method. Both micronozzles were fabricated using soft lithography, an inexpensive and relatively simple technique comparing to well-established deep reactive ion etching (DRIE technique, with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS as structural material. Micronozzles with two different nozzle throat width, 53.5Âµm and 107Âµm, were fabricated for comparison. Microscopic inspections reveal 107Âµm is the more producible nozzle throat width with current equipments. The PDMS-based micronozzle can be used as cold gas microthruster system for micro- and nanosatellites.\n\nDesign, fabrication and testing of porous tungsten vaporizers for mercury ion thrusters\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZavesky, R.; Kroeger, E.; Kami, S.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe dispersions in the characteristics, performance and reliability of vaporizers for early model 30-cm thrusters were investigated. The purpose of the paper is to explore the findings and to discuss the approaches that were taken to reduce the observed dispersion and present the results of a program which validated those approaches. The information that is presented includes porous tungsten materials specifications, a discussion of assembly procedures, and a description of a test program which screens both material and fabrication processes. There are five appendices providing additional detail in the areas of vaporizer contamination, nitrogen flow testing, bubble testing, porosimeter testing, and mercury purity. Four neutralizers, seven cathodes and five main vaporizers were successfully fabricated, tested, and operated on thrusters. Performance data from those devices is presented and indicates extremely repeatable results from using the design and fabrication procedures.\n\nDiffractive optics: design, fabrication, and test\n\nNational Research Council Canada - National Science Library\n\nO'Shea, Donald C\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThis book provides the reader with the broad range of materials that were discussed in a series of short courses presented at Georgia Tech on the design, fabrication, and testing of diffractive optical elements (DOEs...\n\nBiomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWen, Li; Weaver, James C; Lauder, George V\n\n2014-05-15\n\nAlthough the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of Â± 1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.

A MEMS piezoelectromagnetic energy harvester has been fabricated using PZT screen-printing technology with a centrally-supported meandering geometry. The energy harvesting device employs a symmetric geometry to increase its power output by reducing the effects of the torsional modes and the resultant overall strain nodes in the system subsequently reduce the complexities for the electrode fabrication. The unit is modelled using COMSOL to determine mode shapes and frequency response functions. A 12.7 mm by 14.7 mm unit is fabricated by screen-printing 75 Î¼m-thick PZT on a stainless steel substrate and then experimentally tested to validate the FEA results. Experimentally, the harvester is shown to produce 9 Î¼W from a wire carrying 7 A while operating at a distance of 6.5 mm from the wire. The design of the current work results in a greater normalized power density than other MEMS based piezoelectromagnetic devices and shows great potential relative to larger devices that use bulk or thin film piezoelectrics.\n\nDesign, fabrication and installation of irradiation facilities\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKim, Yong Sung; Lee, C.

The design computations to handle a 50Kg mass of feed was done in the MS Excel environment for proper machine design approach. The machine was designed using AUTOCAD 2D/3D design software and proper material selection was done before the assembling and fabrication of parts. The efficiency of the machine, its associated cost of production and the product obtained after few minutes of mixing were outstanding, thereby, making the design acceptable and cost effective.\n\nCrashworthy airframe design concepts: Fabrication and testing\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCronkhite, J. D.; Berry, V. L.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nCrashworthy floor concepts applicable to general aviation aircraft metal airframe structures were investigated. Initially several energy absorbing lower fuselage structure concepts were evaluated. Full scale floor sections representative of a twin engine, general aviation airplane lower fuselage structure were designed and fabricated. The floors featured an upper high strength platform with an energy absorbing, crushable structure underneath. Eighteen floors were fabricated that incorporated five different crushable subfloor concepts. The floors were then evaluated through static and dynamic testing. Computer programs NASTRAN and KRASH were used for the static and dynamic analysis of the floor section designs. Two twin engine airplane fuselages were modified to incorporate the most promising crashworthy floor sections for test evaluation.\n\nRobotic Fabrication in Architecture, Art and Design 2016\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nSaunders, Rob; Burry, Jane\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe book presents the proceedings of Rob/Arch 2016, the third international conference on robotic fabrication in architecture, art, and design. The work contains a wide range of contemporary topics, from methodologies for incorporating dynamic material feedback into existing fabrication processes, to novel interfaces for robotic programming, to new processes for large-scale automated construction. The latent argument behind this research is that the term âfile-to-factoryâ must not be a reductive celebration of expediency but instead a perpetual challenge to increase the quality of feedback between design, matter, and making.\n\nTechnical issues of fabrication technologies of reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steels\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTanigawa, Hiroyasu; Sakasegawa, Hideo; Hirose, Takanori\n\n2013-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ The key technical issues of RAFM steel fabrication are the control of Ta, and deoxidation of the steel with a limited amount of Al addition. â¢ Addition of Ta with poor deoxidation might results in the agglomeration of inclusions at 1/2t position. â¢ ESR was proved to be effective removing Ta oxide inclusions and avoiding agglomeration of inclusions at 1/2t position, and achieving low oxygen concentration. -- Abstract: The key issue for DEMO application is that Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels fabrication technologies has to be highly assured, especially with respect to high availability, reliability and reduced activation capability on the DEMO level fabrication, which requires not a few tons but thousand tons RAFM fabrication. One of the key technical issues of RAFM fabrication is the control of Ta, and deoxidation of the steel with a limited amount of Al addition. The series of F82H (Feâ8Crâ2WâV, Ta) melting revealed that Ta have tendency to form oxide on melting process, and this will have large impact on reliability of the steels. Al is also the key elements, as it is commonly used for deoxidation of steels, and achieving lower oxygen level is essential to obtain good mechanical properties, but the maximum concentration of Al is limited in view of reduced activation capability. These tendency and limitation resulted in the Ta oxide agglomeration in the middle of plate, but the remelting process, ESR (electro slag remelting), was found to be successful on removing those Ta oxides\n\nDesign and fabrication of a radially-fed implosion heating coil\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHansborough, L.D.; Dickinson, J.M.; Melton, J.G.; Nunnally, W.C.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nA radially-fed implosion heating coil has been designed and fabricated at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.

These analyses succeeded in identifying and explaining the principal causes of thermal-stress problems encountered in the tests, and in confirming the effectiveness of design changes for alleviating them. The present paper presents additional design improvements for solving these and other problems, and describes new thermoelectric material properties generated by independent laboratories over the past two years. Based on these changes and on a revised fabrication procedure, it presents a reoptimization of the MITG design and computes the power-to-weight ratio for the revised design. That ratio is appreciably lower than the 1981 prediction, primarily because of changes in material properties; but it is still much higher than the specific power of current-generation RTGs\n\nCryogenic Wind Tunnel Models. Design and Fabrication\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYoung, C. P., Jr. (Compiler); Gloss, B. B. (Compiler)\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe principal motivating factor was the National Transonic Facility (NTF). Since the NTF can achieve significantly higher Reynolds numbers at transonic speeds than other wind tunnels in the world, and will therefore occupy a unique position among ground test facilities, every effort is being made to ensure that model design and fabrication technology exists to allow researchers to take advantage of this high Reynolds number capability. Since a great deal of experience in designing and fabricating cryogenic wind tunnel models does not exist, and since the experience that does exist is scattered over a number of organizations, there is a need to bring existing experience in these areas together and share it among all interested parties. Representatives from government, the airframe industry, and universities are included.\n\nDesigning, Fabrication and Controlling Of Multipurpose3-DOF Robotic Arm\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNabeel, Hafiz Muhammad; Azher, Anum; Usman Ali, Syed M.; Wahab Mughal, Abdul\n\n2013-12-01\n\nIn the present work, we have successfully designed and developed a 3-DOF articulated Robotic Arm capable of performing typical industrial tasks such as painting or spraying, assembling and handling automobiles parts and etc., in resemblance to a human arm.

To ensure the mass access in photovoltaic electricity, cost effective approach needs to be adapted. This thesis aims towards substrate independent fabrication process in order to achieve high efficiency cost effective industrial Silicon (Si) solar cells. Most cost-effective structures, such as, Al-BSF (Aluminum Back Surface Field), FSF (Front Surface Field) and bifacial cells are investigated in detail to exploit the efficiency potentials. First off, we introduced two-dimensional simulation model to design and modeling of most commonly used Si solar cells in today's PV arena. Best modelled results of high efficiency Al-BSF, FSF and bifacial cells are 20.50%, 22% and 21.68% respectively. Special attentions are given on the metallization design on all the structures in order to reduce the Ag cost. Furthermore, detail design and modeling were performed on FSF and bifacial cells. The FSF cells has potentials to gain 0.42%abs efficiency by combining the emitter design and front surface passivation. The prospects of bifacial cells can be revealed with the optimization of gridline widths and gridline numbers. Since, bifacial cells have metallization on both sides, a double fold cost saving is possible via innovative metallization design. Following modeling an effort is undertaken to reach the modelled result in fabrication the process. We proposed substrate independent fabrication process aiming towards establishing simultaneous processing sequences for both monofacial and bifacial cells. Subsequently, for the contact formation cost effective screen-printed technology is utilized throughout this thesis. The best Al-BSF cell attained efficiency Ë19.40%. Detail characterization was carried out to find a roadmap of achieving >20.50% efficiency Al-BSF cell. Since, n-type cell is free from Light Induced degradation (LID), recently there is a growing interest on FSF cell.

While digital models are easily created, the actual fabrication and construction remains a challenge. This is the source of numerous research problems many of which fall into the area of Geometric Computing and form part of a recently emerging research area, called \"Architectural Geometry\". The present paper provides a short survey of research in Architectural Geometry and shows how this field moves towards a new direction in Geometric Modeling which aims at combining shape design with important aspects of function and fabrication.

The VV and ports are the components allocated to Korea for the construction of the ITER. Hyundai Heavy Industries has been involved in the structural analysis, detailed design and development of the fabrication method of the upper and lower ports within the framework of the ITER transitional arrangements (ITA). The design of the port structures has been investigated to validate and to improve the conceptual designs of the ITER IT and other PT. The special emphasis was laid on the flange joint between the port extension and the in-port plug to develop the design of the upper port. The modified design with a pure friction type flange with forty-eight pieces of bolts instead of the tangential key is recommended. Furthermore, the alternative flange designs developed by the ITER IT have been analyzed in detail to simplify the lip seal maintenance into the port flange. The structural analyses of the lower RH port have been also performed to verify the capacity for supporting the VV. The maximum stress exceeds the allowable value at the reinforcing block and basement. More elaborate local models have been developed to mitigate the stress concentration and to modify the component design. The fabrication method and the sequence of the detailed fabrication for the ports are developed focusing on the cost reduction as well as the simplification. A typical port structure includes a port stub, a stub extension and a port extension with a connecting duct. The fabrication sequence consists of surface treatment, cutting, forming, cleaning, welding, machining, and non-destructive inspection and test. Tolerance study has been performed to avoid the mismatch of each fabricated component and to obtain the suitable tolerances in the assembly at the shop and site. This study is based on the experience in the fabrication of\n\nDesign of the MOX fuel fabrication facility\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJohnson, J.V.; Brabazon, E.J.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA consortium of Duke Engineering and Services, Inc., COGEMA, Inc. and Stone and Webster (DCS) are designing a mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility (MFFF) for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to convert surplus plutonium to mixed oxide (MOX) fuel to be irradiated in commercial nuclear power plants based on the proven European technology of COGEMA and BELGONUCLEAIRE.

The most efficient use of fabric is to fashion it into cylindrical tubes, creating cylindrical fabric-confined soil structures. The length, diameter, and curvature of the tubes will depend on the intended application. The cylindrical hoop forces provide radial confinement while end caps provide axial confinement. One of the ends is designed to allow passage of the soil into the fabric tube before sealing. Transportation requirements are reduced due to the low mass and volume of the fabric. Construction requirements are reduced due to the self-erection capability via the pneumatic exoskeleton. Maintenance requirements are reduced due to the passive nature of the concept. The structure's natural ductility is well suited for any seismic activity.\n\nDesign of Tailored Non-Crimp Fabrics Based on Stitching Geometry\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKrieger, Helga; Gries, Thomas; Stapleton, Scott E.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAutomation of the preforming process brings up two opposing requirements for the used engineering fabric. On the one hand, the fabric requires a sufficient drapeability, or low shear stiffness, for forming into double-curved geometries; but on the other hand, the fabric requires a high form stability, or high shear stiffness, for automated handling. To meet both requirements tailored non-crimp fabrics (TNCFs) are proposed. While the stitching has little structural influence on the final part, it virtually dictates the TNCFs local capability to shear and drape over a mold during preforming. The shear stiffness of TNCFs is designed by defining the local stitching geometry. NCFs with chain stitch have a comparatively high shear stiffness and NCFs with a stitch angle close to the symmetry stitch angle have a very low shear stiffness. A method to design the component specific local stitching parameters of TNCFs is discussed. For validation of the method, NCFs with designed tailored stitching parameters were manufactured and compared to benchmark NCFs with uniform stitching parameters. The designed TNCFs showed both, generally a high form stability and in locally required zones a good drapeability, in drape experiments over an elongated hemisphere.\n\nASME Code requirements for multi-canister overpack design and fabrication\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSMITH, K.E.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe baseline requirements for the design and fabrication of the MCO include the application of the technical requirements of the ASME Code, Section III, Subsection NB for containment and Section III, Subsection NG for criticality control. ASME Code administrative requirements, which have not historically been applied at the Hanford site and which have not been required by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for licensed spent fuel casks/canisters, were not invoked for the MCO. As a result of recommendations made from an ASME Code consultant in response to DNFSB staff concerns regarding ASME Code application, the SNF Project will be making the following modifications: issue an ASME Code Design Specification and Design Report, certified by a Registered Professional Engineer; Require the MCO fabricator to hold ASME Section III or Section VIII, Division 2 accreditation; and Use ASME Authorized Inspectors for MCO fabrication. Incorporation of these modifications will ensure that the MCO is designed and fabricated in accordance with the ASME Code. Code Stamping has not been a requirement at the Hanford site, nor for NRC licensed spent fuel casks/canisters, but will be considered if determined to be economically justified\n\nEngineering Design and Fabrication of an Ampere-Class Superconducting Photocathode Electron Gun\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBen-Zvi, I.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nOver the past three years, Advanced Energy Systems and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) have been collaborating on the design of an Ampere- class superconducting photocathode electron gun.

Electromagnetic microgenerators consist of planar coils spatially arranged on several layers of LTCC and of a multipole permanent magnet. Two different patterns of coils with 2-, 8-,10- and 12-layers and outer diameter of 50 mm were designed and fabricated. Silver-based pastes ESL 903-A or DuPont 6145 were used. In order to estimate the inductance of a single spatial coil the Greenhouse (self-inductance) and Hoer (mutual inductance) calculation methods were used. To verify the calculation results a single-layer coil was fabricated for each pattern and its inductance was measured using the precision RLC Meter. Fabricated LTCC microgenerators with embedded coils allow to generate voltage higher than ten volts and the electrical output power of approximately 600 mW at the rotor rotation speed of 12 thousands rpm. The self-made system was used for characterization of LTCC-based electromagnetic microgenerators.

Because of the sodium leaks through the tank at the beginning of pre-operation, the utilization of the ex-vessel fuel storage tank (EVST) of some FBR plant has been changed from the ex-vessel fuel storage to the interim fuel transfer tank. This led to reactor designers focusing on the material, structure and fabrication of the carbon steel sodium storage tanks worldwide. The Monju EVST was at the final stage of the design, when the leaks occurred. The lesson learned from that experience and the domestic fabrication technology are reflected to the design and fabrication of the Monju EVST. This paper describes the design, fabrication and R and D results for the tank, and operating experience in functional test. The items to be examined are as follows: (1) Overall structure of the tank and design philosophy on the function, (2) Structure of the cover shielding plug and its design philosophy, (3) Structures of the rotating rack and its bearings, and their design philosophy, (4) Cooling method and its design philosophy, (5) Structure and fabrication of the cooling coil support inside EVST with comparison of leaked case, (6) R and D effort for items above. The fabrication of the Monju EVST started in August 1986 and it was shipped to the site in March 1990. Installation was completed in November 1990, and sodium fill after pre-heating started in 1991. The operation has been continued since September 1992. In 1996 when the first spent fuel is stored, its total functions will be examined.

The influence of the applied number of RGO coatings on properties such as light absorption, conductivity, electroactivity and photocatalytic properties of the fabrics was established. An improvement of these properties with the number of RGO coatings applied was obtained. FESEM, EDX, XPS and FTIR-ATR showed the incorporation of the TiO{sub 2} nanoparticles on the fabrics. FTIR-ATR showed the formation of a bidentate carboxylic ligand with titanium atoms. The photocatalytic properties of the fabrics were tested with Rhodamine B dye solutions. Photocatalytic efficiency increased with the number of RGO coatings, due to the increased light absorption, and better electrical properties. The charge transfer resistance (R{sub ct}) and its time constant (Ï) decreased, indicating a better electron transfer which helps to increase the lifetime of the pair electron/hole.\n\nDesign and fabrication of topologically optimized structures;\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nFeringa, Jelle; SÃ¸ndergaard, AsbjÃ¸rn\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIntegral structural optimization and fabrication seeks the synthesis of two original approaches; that of topological optimization (TO) and robotic hotwire cutting (HWC) (Mcgee 2011).

Recently, a new switching system of wettability has inspired a strong demand for advanced coatings, even though their fabrication remains complex and costly. Here, cotton fabrics with asymmetric wettability (one face with natural superhydrophilicity and one face with superhydrophobicity) were fabricated by one-step spraying of a mixture of biocompatible commercial materials, hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles and ethyl-Î±-cyanoacrylate superglue. Our approach involves controlling the permeation of the fabric coatings by changing the distance between the fabric and the sprayer, to make one side superhydrophobic and the other side naturally superhydrophilic. As a result, the superhydrophobic side, with its high mechanical durability, exhibited a water contact angle of 154Â° and sliding angle of 16Â°, which meets the requirement for self-cleaning ability of surfaces. The opposite side exhibited high water absorption ability owing to the natural superhydrophilic property of the fabric. In addition, the designed cotton fabrics had blood absorption and clotting abilities on the superhydrophilic side, while the superhydrophobic side prevented water and blood permeation without losing the natural breathability of the cotton. These functions may be useful in the design of multifunctional fabrics for medical applications.\n\nDesign and fabrication of a biomimetic gyroscope inspired by the fly's haltere\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nDroogendijk, H.; Brookhuis, Robert Anton; de Boer, Meint J.; Sanders, Remco G.P.; Krijnen, Gijsbertus J.M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe report on the design and fabrication of a MEMS-based gyroscopic system inspired by the fly's haltere system.

The National Nuclear Security Administrationâs Global Threat Reduction Initiative Convert Program is evaluating conversion of TREAT from its existing highly enriched uranium (HEU) core to a new core containing low enriched uranium (LEU). This paper describes briefly the initial pre-conceptual designs screening decisions with more detailed discussions on current feasibility, qualification and fabrication approaches. Feasible fabrication will be shown for a LEU fuel element assembly that can meet TREAT design, performance, and safety requirements. The statement of feasibility recognizes that further development, analysis, and testing must be completed to refine the conceptual design. Engineering challenges such as cladding oxidation, high temperature material properties, and fuel block fabrication along with neutronics performance, will be highlighted.

The limited natural healing ability of cartilage and the limitations of currently available therapies make treatment of cartilage defects a challenging clinical issue. Hopes have been raised for the repair of articular cartilage with the help of supportive structures, called scaffolds, created through tissue engineering (TE). Over the past two decades, different designs and fabrication techniques have been investigated for developing TE scaffolds suitable for the construction of transplantable artificial cartilage tissue substitutes. Advances in fabrication technologies now enable the strategic design of scaffolds with complex, biomimetic structures and properties. In particular, scaffolds with hybrid and/or biomimetic zonal designs have recently been developed for cartilage tissue engineering applications. This paper reviews critical aspects of the design of engineered scaffolds for articular cartilage repair as well as the available advanced fabrication techniques. In addition, recent studies on the design of hybrid and zonal scaffolds for use in cartilage tissue repair are highlighted.

It is designed to work at both 60 GHz and 77 GHz through MEMS switches. This antenna can also work in both horizontal and vertical linear polarizations by utilizing a moveable plate. The design is intended for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and automotive radar applications. Typical on-chip antennas are inefficient and difficult to reconfigure. Therefore, the focus of this work is to develop an efficient on-chip antenna solution, which is reconfigurable in frequency and in polarization. A fractal bowtie antenna is employed for this thesis, which achieves frequency reconfigurability through MEMS switches. The design is simulated in industry standard Electromagnetic (EM) simulator Ansoft HFSS. A novel concept for horizontal to vertical linear polarization agility is introduced which incorporates a moveable polymer plate. For this work, a microprobe is used to move the plate from the horizontal to vertical position. For testing purposes, a novel mechanism has been designed in order to feed the antenna with RF-probes in both horizontal and vertical positions. A simulated gain of approximately 0 dB is achieved at both target frequencies (60 and 77 GHz), in both horizontal and vertical positions. In all the cases mentioned above (both frequencies and positions), the antenna is well matched (< -10 dB) to the 50 Î© system impedance. Similarly, the radiation nulls are successfully shifted by changing the position of the antenna from horizontal to vertical. The complete design and fabrication of the reconfigurable MEMS antenna has been done at KAUST facilities. Some challenges have been encountered during its realization due to the immaturity of the customized MEMS fabrication process. Nonetheless, a first fabrication attempt has highlighted such shortcomings.

R.; Schroeder, E. C.; Deffenbaugh, D. D.; Masetta, J. P.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe focus is the generation of technology and fabrication of prototype hardware applicable to seven Space Station compressor system applications. The compressors are of the single acting reciprocating piston type and, in general, may be termed miniature in size compared with normal commercially available equipment. The initial technology development is focused on improved valve designs, and the control of pulsations and heating effects in order to increase compressor efficiency and reduce cycle temperatures, thus permitting significantly increased stage pressure ratios. The initial test compressor was successfully operated at pressure ratios of up to 50:1, and this significant extension of allowable pressure ratio will result in a reduction of the number of required stages and, hence, total hardware thereby reducing system weight and volume. These experiments have also identified the need to employ low shaft speeds, on the order of 250 to 500 rpm, to enhance heat transfer and increase life. The prototype compressor currently being designed, is to be driven by a low-speed brushless dc motor sealed in a case common to the compressor drive mechanism case. The compressor and motor case will communicate with stage suction pressure so that any minor gas leakage past the piston rings will be returned to the suction. Emphasis in this prototype design is being placed on simplicity, durability, commonality of components, and high efficiency.\n\nDesign and evaluation of low-cost laminated wood composite blades for intermediate size wind turbines: Blade design, fabrication concept, and cost analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLieblein, S.; Gaugeon, M.; Thomas, G.; Zueck, M.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nAs part of a program to reduce wind turbine costs, an evaluation was conducted of a laminated wood composite blade for the Mod-OA 200 kW wind turbine. The effort included the design and fabrication concept for the blade, together with cost and load analyses. The blade structure is composed of laminated Douglas fir veneers for the primary spar and nose sections, and honeycomb cored plywood panels for the trailing edges sections. The attachment of the wood blade to the rotor hub was through load takeoff studs bonded into the blade root. Tests were conducted on specimens of the key structural components to verify the feasibility of the concept. It is concluded that the proposed wood composite blade design and fabrication concept is suitable for Mod-OA size turbines (125-ft diameter rotor) at a cost that is very competitive with other methods of manufacture.\n\nAn electrostatic lower stator axial gap wobble motor: design and fabrication\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nLegtenberg, R.; Legtenberg, Rob; Berenschot, Johan W.; van Baar, J.J.J.; Lammerink, Theodorus S.J.; Elwenspoek, Michael Curt\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe fabrication, initial modelling and first results of an electrostatic lower stator axial gap wobble motor are presented.

Abubakar\n\n2017-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Anaerobic digester is a physical structure that provides a conducive environment for the multiplication of micro-organisms that degrades organic matter to generate biogas energy. Energy is required in agriculture for crop production, processing and storage, poultry production and electricity for farmstead and farm settlements. It is energy that propels agricultural mechanization, which minimizes the use of human and animal muscles and its inherent drudgery in agriculture. The energy demand required to meet up with the agricultural growth in Nigeria is high and growing every year. In this study the design and fabrication of an anaerobic digester was reported which is an attempt to boost energy requirement for small and medium dryland farmers in Nigeria. The design of the digester includes the following concept; the basic principles of anaerobic digestion processes, socio-economic status of the dryland farmers, amount of biogas to be produced. Finally, the digester was fabricated using locally available raw materials within the dryland area of Nigeria. At the end, preliminary flammability test was conducted and the biogas produced was found to be flammable.\n\nDesign and fabrication of a biomimetic gyroscope inspired by the flyâs haltere\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nDroogendijk, H.; Brookhuis, Robert Anton; de Boer, Meint J.; Sanders, Remco G.P.; Krijnen, Gijsbertus J.M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe report on the design and fabrication of a MEMS-based gyroscopic system inspired by the flyâs haltere system.

They provide a wide range of opportunities in designing advanced structures because of their high tenacity, flexibility, high strength-to-weight ratios and versatility. These advantages result from their inherent multi scale nature where the filaments are bundled together to create yarns while the yarns are arranged into different weave architectures. Their highly versatile nature opens up potential for a wide range of mechanical properties which can be adjusted based on the application. While woven fabrics are viable options for design of various engineering systems, being able to understand the underlying mechanisms of the deformation and associated highly nonlinear mechanical response is important and necessary. However, the multiscale nature and relationships between these scales make the design process involving woven fabrics a challenging task. The objective of this work is to develop a multiscale numerical design framework using experimentally validated mesoscopic and macroscopic length scale approaches by identifying important deformation mechanisms and recognizing the nonlinear mechanical response of woven fabrics. This framework is exercised by developing mesoscopic length scale constitutive models to investigate plain weave fabric response under a wide range of loading conditions. A hyperelastic transversely isotropic yarn material model with transverse material nonlinearity is developed for woven yarns (commonly used in personal protection garments). The material properties/parameters are determined through an inverse method where unit cell finite element simulations are coupled with experiments. The developed yarn material model is validated by simulating full scale uniaxial tensile, bias extension and indentation experiments, and comparing to experimentally observed mechanical response and deformation mechanisms.

They are based on vertical stacking of active components to form heterogeneous microsystems. Electronic image sensors will benefit from these technologies because they allow increased pixel-level data processing and device optimization. This paper covers general principles in the design of vertically-integrated (VI) CMOS image sensors that are fabricated by flip-chip bonding. These sensors are composed of a CMOS die and a photodetector die. As a specific example, the paper presents a VI-CMOS image sensor that was designed at the University of Alberta, and fabricated with the help of CMC Microsystems and Micralyne Inc. To realize prototypes, CMOS dies with logarithmic active pixels were prepared in a commercial process, and photodetector dies with metal-semiconductor-metal devices were prepared in a custom process using hydrogenated amorphous silicon. The paper also describes a digital camera that was developed to test the prototype. In this camera, scenes captured by the image sensor are read using an FPGA board, and sent in real time to a PC over USB for data processing and display. Experimental results show that the VI-CMOS prototype has a higher dynamic range and a lower dark limit than conventional electronic image sensors.
