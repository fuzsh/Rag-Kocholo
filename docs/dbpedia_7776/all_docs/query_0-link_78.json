        "text": "I spent a couple of weeks recently in Israel, a purely touristic trip. But of course, I can’t just let go of my interest in the environment; here are some of my disorganised thoughts about what I saw.\n\nI say disorganised, because the environmental record, like the whole of the country, is a bit of a paradox: how can a country so progressive in its culture, a country that could be a ray of hope for the whole middle east, adopt policies reminiscent of the Berlin Wall, apartheid, and an Iran-like theocracy? And the environmental record is no different: amazingly good in some cases, weirdly and unexpectedly bad in others.\n\nIsrael is, of course, world renowned for its water conservation initiatives. This is not something you see as a tourist; all you know is that the tap water tastes good, is completely safe, and is abundant. But I knew where that water was coming from; before leaving, I made sure to read Seth Siegel’s 2015 book Let There Be Water: Israel’s solution for a water starved world. According to Seagel, water saving technologies as diverse as the dual flush toilet and the drip irrigation system were all developed in Israel – including sewage recycling, using membrane filtration technology (after standard treatment).\n\nSo I knew that what I was drinking was recycled sewage; and somehow, knowing that, instead of producing an ick reflex, made me feel strangely smug. Hey, watch me flush guilt-free; it won’t pollute, it won’t make someone sick, it won’t even waste water – it’s coming back, closing the cycle, and fully clean.\n\nThe membrane filtration is the same technology that is used for ocean water desalination, which is also used and was pioneered in Israel. But filtering treated sewage, as opposed to filtering sea water, uses much less energy. And that remains true even though Israel’s sewage is ironically the saltiest in the world (due to the extensive use of salt and brines in classic kosher cooking).\n\nYou don’t see any of that as a tourist, but you see some of the results: in Tel-Aviv, the beaches are clean and full of swimmers, surfboarders, and small-craft sailors. And yet, the city struggles with periodic coliform contamination of its beaches. This is because the cycle is not, despite all intentions, fully closed. The sewers that bring wastewater to the treatment plants also convey rain water; and during major storms, they get overwhelmed and overflow (they is little storage capacity in the network).\n\nStill, the pollution numbers are not all that different from, say, English Bay in Vancouver. But you’ll find in Tel Aviv something you don’t find in Vancouver: an app that tells you exactly where the pollution is, what beaches are closed and why. This is typical for this computer start-up mecca.\n\nSince I mention the sewers, I can’t resist posting this little video about the artwork on manhole covers. You get the real relaxed, California-like vibe that permeates the city, so different from Jerusalem – and notice the bike paths, they are everywhere.\n\nAs a tourist, you can also stroll along the Yarkon River that bisects the city, along a wonderful linear park across Tel Aviv itself and extends into the suburb of Ramat Gan. The park is used by cyclists and joggers as well as kayakers, or by anyone looking for an oasis of shade. Despite being Israel’s second longest river after the Jordan, the Yarkon is less than 30 km in length; Israel is a small country. It used to be an open sewer; but after an extensive clean-up program, the small stream was declared fit to swim in 2011. This was a very pleasant surprise; during an earlier visit (in 1980) I remembered this part of the city as distinctly unpleasant. Hard to believe that as recently as 1997, four athletes died and sixty were acutely sick after accidentally falling in the river; this was the result of a severe fugal infection contracted from aspiration of the polluted waters. At the time, some of the smaller towns along the Yarkon didn’t even have a sewage treatment system; that the river is now clean, a mere twenty years later, shows how fast the progress was.\n\nOn the bus between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, I was amazed by how the scenery had changed in nearly 40 years. Israel is famous for having “made the desert bloom” – or rather, for having planted tree seedlings over land that was dry and damaged. What looked like a distant green fuzz all these years ago now looks like a deep green forest. I was pretty speechless looking at this forest that wasn’t there before, and that went on for over an hour. This forest, along the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv corridor, is the most famous: six million trees were planted in 1951, one for each of victims of the Holocaust. And this forest, remarkable as it is, is only one of many such plantings. The largest, the Yatir forest north-east of Beersheeva, is truly amazing, a biodiverse assemblage of drought resistant species that has rolled back the desert despite an average yearly precipitation of less than 300 mm (this is only about 20% of Vancouver’s). This was accomplished in part by cleverly modifying the landscape; small embankments slow surface runoff and ensure that rainfall recharges the groundwater. (Basically, Israeli water managers have done the equivalent of what beavers do: small dams everywhere, making the land work like a sponge. This is not a new technology; archaeologists have discovered abandoned water impoundments that date from the Byzantine era, but the modern scope is unprecedented.)\n\nBut this feeling of elation was a bit dashed when I arrived at the Dead Sea, a few days later. I knew that the Dead Sea had been receding (after all, it is one the main topics of Canadian environmental writer Alanna Mitchell’s book Dancing at the Dead Sea) but I wasn’t prepared for what I saw. I had stayed at the Ein Gedi oasis, in a little youth hostel near the shoreline; next to it was a fancier spa (that I couldn’t afford) and a few other facilities for tourists that come for the beneficial effects of the Dead Sea mud. All these facilities are now abandoned ruins; the sea is now too far below, having dropped by about a meter every year since 1970. The road itself has been rerouted; sinkholes have appeared at random (including under the old road) because the groundwater is now so low. The sea level is dropping because the waters lost to evaporation are no longer made up by the flow from the Jordan River, which is fully diverted for irrigation in Israel and Jordan. And the sinkholes are largely due to pumping of groundwater by a local water bottling company.\n\nWell, at least the wilderness around Ein Gedi, and the two small canyons that have year-round flow, are now protected into an ecological reserve. Silver lining.\n\nBut there are plans afoot to replenish the dead sea. Israel and Jordan may cooperate on a large project to bring waters from the Red Sea, at sea level, into the Dead Sea, which has the lowest elevation in the world, 430m below sea level. This drop could be used to generate electricity, and the electricity produced would power a desalination plant, boosting the amount of water available for irrigation to both countries. And the brine could be dumped into the Dead Sea, raising its level with few environmental impacts (the Dead Sea has little life in it, hence its name, and its salinity is about the same as that of the brine rejected by a desal plant). This may raise the sea to its original level, saving the few shoreline marshes that were used by migrating waterfowl. This is not without risk, though; apart from the obvious issues of cost, the chemistry of the Dead Sea waters is quite unique and different from sea water; the proportion of bromine ions is much higher (which supposedly account for its therapeutic properties) than that of sea water brine. What the consequences would be for the mineral extraction industry at the south end of the sea are unclear.\n\nProblems in Israel, environmental or otherwise, are never simple. According to 2009 statistics, 1.9 billion cubic meters of water are consumed yearly, half of that for irrigation, leaving a comfortable 137 liters per day per person for domestic consumption. But of that total, only a very small fraction (about 5%) is available for Jordan and the Palestinian territories, combined. Lack of water in the occupied territories may be the biggest aggravation faced by the Palestinians, making any prospects for peace ever more elusive between water-rich Israel and its parched, desperate neighbour.\n\nI spoke to an engineer, an Jewish immigrant from Russia who was able to leave after the communist regime fell. Needless to say, he had seen his share of strife and absurd political decisions. He explained to me that Israeli politics are essentially reactive; nothing happens, nothing gets done until there is a clear emergency. He pointed to the country’s water politics; there had been little investment in techniques such as desalination,membrane filtration, and groundwater recharge until the country nearly ran out of water – then things moved quickly, and “the problem was fixed.” This was in response to my question about the environmental situation, not the occupied territory politics, but I expect the answer would not have been that dissimilar. He was fairly cynical about politics, shrugged his shoulders a lot in a disabused fashion. But he was not pessimistic; he said that the country seems to eventually always muddle its way through to a solution to its problems. Here’s to hope for the long run.\n\nBooks mentioned:\n\nSiegel, Seth 2015. Let there be water: Israel’s solution for a water-starved world. New York: Thomas Dunne Books."
