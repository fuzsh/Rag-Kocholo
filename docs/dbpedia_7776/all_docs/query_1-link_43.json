        "meta_description": "The river runs from the Tel Aviv port, through North Tel Aviv and into the neighboring town of Ramat Gan. The Yarkon's banks are a lovely place for recreation with lawns, trees, a children's play area and a path used by cyclists, rollerskaters, joggers and mothers pushing baby strollers. On weekends, the banks are full of life with family barbecues and picnics going on in the summer months. Boats are available for hire. A boathouse owner assured me that the part of the river near the mouth of the sea is perfectly clean and safe for sailing.",
