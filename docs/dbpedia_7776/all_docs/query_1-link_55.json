Riding along the Yarkon River according to the trail markings, the route of the trail goes along the route of the Israel Trail (white-blue-orange trail markings).\n\nAlong the way you can watch various animals as well as stop at points of interest such as the Sheva Tahanah complex, the lake in Yarkon Park, Afek Park and more."
