        "text": "\"Much discussion has focused on the ability of archaeology (and archaeologists) to identify, on the basis of material culture, ethnic groups. According to Colin Renfrew ‘the most problematic of all the concepts which we have tended to use is that of ‘a people’’. Much of the discussion of this subject in the Syro-Palestinian archaeology has concentrated around the identification of the ‘Israelites’. Most of this discussion has focused on Iron Age I (the period of Settlement), in an attempt to identify the similarities and differences between the various ethnic groups which existed in the Land of Israel at this time. The present article will discuss the ethnicity of the inhabitants of Northern Israel during the Iron Age II. The departure point of this article is the rural sector, which did not receive much attention by the ‘Tell minded’ archaeological research, but, for reasons given below, seems to hold the key to the attempt to identify ethnic groups in ancient Israel. \"\n\nThe debates surrounding the identity and origins of ancient Israel represent one of the most contentious chapters in the history of archaeological and biblical research. Most views regarding the emergence of ancient Israel fall into the category of one of four general approaches-conquest, peaceful infiltration, social revolution, or pastoral Canaanite theories. The development of these schools of thought not only mirror increased archaeological fieldwork but also are indicators of research and political trends over the past 80 years. These theories, discussed in greater detail below, often reflect not only scholarly opinion and the fashion of the times but also deeply held personal beliefs. However, based on a careful reexamination of the relevant literature and an analysis of the complex social and cultural boundaries of 12th-century BCE Canaan, I propose that a consensus is emerging. Ancient Israel during the Iron I period should be defined as constituted by largely indigenous, tribal, and kinship-based groups, with the additional influx of smaller numbers of members of external groups, whose genealogical affiliations together comprised a \"mixed multitude\" of peoples. This \"mixed multitude\" is defined as the inhabitants of the rural Iron I hill country and Transjordanian highland villages and countryside, a population that has been identified by some as the premonarchic \"Israelites\" or \"Proto-Israelites.\" This article summarizes the textual and archaeological evidence and the role ideology played in the ethnogenesis Early Israel.\n\nearly Israel involve the interplay between archaeology and ethnicity. The first is related to the formation of the early Israelite ethnicity: can we identify a new ethnic entity in the archaeological record of the highlands in the Iron I? The second: what can we learn from the archaeological record about the origin of the people who settled the hundreds of new Iron I villages in the hill coun-try? In a recent issue of Biblical Archaeologist (1995a) as well as elsewhere (1993: \"Will the Real Israel Please Stand Up?\"), W. Dever has delved into this thicket of issues. But his reconstruction remains too wedded to the biblical story and too conservative archaeologically. I wish to refute Dever's answers to these questions and offer my own, alternative solutions. Dever's Hypothesis on the Rise of Early Israel Ethnicity in Early Israel Dever's response to the question of ethnicity in the highlands of Canaan in the Iron I is based on three related arguments. He asserts, first and foremost, that archaeology can identify a distinct new ethnic entity in the highlands of Canaan in the Iron I. According to Dever, The village of Deir Ammar west of Ramallah. The settlement history of the site is typical of central hill country sites in the second-first millennia BCE: a small Middle Bronze site was deserted in the Late Bronze, resettled in the Iron I, and grew significantly in the Iron II. in twelfth century BCE Canaan, there did exist, at least on the highland frontier, a new ethnic entity, which we can recognize in the archaeological remains, and which we can distinguish from other known ethnic groups such as \"Canaanites\" and \"Philistines\" (1993:24; see also 1995a:201). Yet, as far as I can judge, this is a circular argument. It is based on the biblical text, rather than on the archaeological data. There is a remarkable continuity in the material culture in the Late Bronze/Iron I transition (Dever 1991; 1993; 1995a). The differences between the two cultures can be explained on the basis of socioeconomic and environmental differences (e.g., London 1989). If this is the case, how can archaeologists trace a new ethnic group in the Iron I? Moreover, if material culture of the Iron I highlands sites did not depart from the Late Bronze traditions until ca. 1100-1050 (Dever 1995a:206), how can one distinguish a distinct new ethnos in the late-thirteenth century, over a century before this point of departure? I refer to the methodological 198\n\nAncient Israel did not emerge within a vacuum but rather came to exist alongside various peoples, including Canaanites, Egyptians, and Philistines. Indeed, Israel's very proximity to these groups has made it difficult - until now - to distinguish the archaeological traces of early Israel and other contemporary groups. Through an analysis of the results from recent excavations in light of relevant historical and later biblical texts, this book proposes that it is possible to identify these peoples and trace culturally or ethnically defined boundaries in the archaeological record. Features of late second-millennium B.C.E. culture are critically examined in their historical and biblical contexts in order to define the complex social boundaries of the early Iron Age and reconstruct the diverse material world of these four peoples. Of particular value to scholars, archaeologists, and historians, this volume will also be a standard reference and resource for students and other readers interested in the emergence of early Israel.\n\nIn this study, Assaf Kleiman discusses the settlement history and material culture of complex communities that flourished in the shadow of Israel and Aram-Damascus. A detailed examination of the finds from the Lebanese Beqaa, through the Sea of Galilee, to the Irbid Plateau, offers an exceptional portrayal of the developments experienced by these communities, before and after the emergence of the territorial kingdoms; these advances include the rise and fall of local polities, the adoption and rejection of certain cultural traits, and even the background for the dissemination of writing. The study provides, therefore, a new and exciting way to look at the political relations and cultural exchange between the indigenous communities and the elites that ruled over them. Rather than interpreting the local populations simply as \"Israelites\" or \"Aramaeans,\" the archaeological record reveals their diversity and highlights the discrete historical trajectories they followed from the 12th to 8th centuries BCE.
