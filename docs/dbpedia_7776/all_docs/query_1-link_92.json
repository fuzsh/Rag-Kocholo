        "text": "The Yarkon Park (Ganei Yehoshua) is a huge stretch of greenery in the center of Tel Aviv. The park runs from Tel Aviv port all the way past the National Stadium in Ramat Gan and on to Bnei Brak. Rokach Boulevard is on the northern side of the park and Bavli on the southern side. Running through the park is the Yarkon River which meanders down to the sea where it pours out into the Mediterranean at Tel Aviv Port. The park has expansive lawns where you can play, picnic, and suntan but if you want to do something a little more active here are the top attractions to keep you busy in Yarkon Park.\n\nPicnic in Yarkon Park, Tel Aviv.
