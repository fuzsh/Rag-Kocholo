Toward the western part of the park (close to the sea) is Sportec, an outdoor center with a 45-foot high climbing wall, basketball and rollerblading courts, and trampolines. This is a great run for those staying near Tel Aviv University. A natural extension of this run is the waterfront promenade, which goes 4 miles south from Tel Aviv Port.\n\nThere is a jogging track at Sportek, on Rokach Blvd."
