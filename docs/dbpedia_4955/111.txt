SHANNON RFC ensured there will be three Limerick clubs competing in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League next season after securing a convincing promotion play-off final win over Naas on Saturday.

Shannon made it eight wins on the bounce in the league when recording a deserved 30-15 success over the Co Kildare side in front of a bumper attendance at Coonagh.

The Parish side will now join Garryowen and Young Munster in the All-Ireland League's top flight next season.

Leader Sport caught up with Shannon RFC head coach Pat O'Connor after Saturday's game.
