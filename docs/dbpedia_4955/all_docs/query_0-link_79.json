The &lsquo;jibe&rsquo; was always always followed by childish chuckle and the squinting of his devilment-filled eyes.\n\nThey’ve taken plenty of hits over the years, so it takes something seismic to make big men falter in their step. It seems that moment came yesterday, writes Noel Baker of the Irish Examiner.\n\nThe issue of concussion in professional rugby has been at the forefront of discussion over the last number of seasons.\n\nAnthony Foley wasn’t even a twinkle in his father’s eye when the family name hit the rugby headlines for the first time.\n\nIt has been a miserable few weeks for those involved with the once mighty Shannon RFC.\n\nAll-Ireland League giants Shannon last night confirmed that head coach Stephen Keogh and his assistant Eoin Cahill have left their roles “by mutual agreement with the club”.\n\nFormer rugby great Cllr Gerry McLoughlin (Lab), on being elected Mayor of Limerick last night, showed he is not a Ross O’Carroll Kelly type when it comes to bragging about sporting achievements.\n\nThe IRFU launched its ticket price strategy for the 2012-13 season in the hope of avoiding a repeat of the 2010 empty seat fiasco.\n\nClass played a major role in Munster rugby in Munster. A new book sheds light on this and other fascinating developments, writes John Breen\n\nALAN QUINLAN has promised to take the same positivity that marked his life as a rugby player into retirement when he brings down the curtain on a remarkable career at the end of this season.\n\nSHANNON RFC are set for an early Christmas present thanks to rivals Young Munster and their talisman Paul O’Connell.\n\nSHANNON RFC have unveiled a painting to commemorate the memory of club great, Frankie O’Flynn, who died in 2008.\n\nDolphin’s Sam Cronin will captain the Ireland Club against the Scotland Club side in the AIB Club International in Donnybrook on Friday evening.\n\nCoach David O'Mahony has selected players from 12 different clubs for the Ireland Club international against England Counties in Stourbridge on Friday night.\n\nTHERE were unconfirmed reports yesterday that a second teenage rugby player was assaulted by an adult official at an underage game in Co Limerick on Sunday.\n\nGARDAÍ last night confirmed they are investigating an alleged assault on a teenage rugby player in Limerick yesterday.\n\nSHANNON have lost their appeal against the &euro;25,000 fine imposed on them by the IRFU disciplinary committee arising out of incidents involving senior members of the club and referee George Clancy at the conclusion of last month’s AIB League game against Cork Constitution at Coonagh.\n\nThe IRFU Disciplinary Appeal Panel have fined Shannon €25,000 for verbal abuse of the match referee and officials following their AIB League match against Cork Constitution FC on December 5, 2009.\n\nAIB League champions Shannon will have their appeal against a &euro;25,000 fine heard by the Irish Rugby Football Union in Dublin on Wednesday.\n\nDETAILS emerged yesterday of the barrage of abuse launched at a top referee which led to a &euro;25,000 fine being imposed on Shannon RFC following incidents after an AIL game in Limerick.\n\nTHE handing over of Thomond Park to contractors for the €40 million redevelopment of the stadium has been delayed by one week."
