        "text": "THE RUGBY SPECTATOR - a feast of International rugby in 2024 Apr 9 With the European club rugby scene drawing to a close, rugby spectators in the northern hemisphere might think there will a quiet. and thus boring “off season” looming. But, as the world community of rugby strives to make the game more accessible, more widespread and competitive, fans can look forward to a lot of great matches in the upcoming summer and autumn International Series. Note that the southern and northern hemisphere teams have off-seasons during their opposite numbers’ regular season, so as a result, the northern countries travel (south) in their summer, and the southern countries go north in theirs. All of the major international teams will be in action between June and November with the addition of some 2nd level countries who are very keen to enter the top ranks of world rugby. So for the fans who can actually attend or have access to streaming services, the following countries will be in action: South Africa; New Zealand; England; Argentina; Ireland; Fiji; Australia; Scotland; France; Japan; plus Georgia; the USA; Portugal; Chile and Uruguay. The Home teams have the following schedules: South Africa - July 6 vs. IRE; July 13 vs. IRE; July 20 vs. Portugal; August 31 vs. NZAB; September 7 vs. NZAB New Zealand - July 6 vs. ENG; July 13 vs. ENG; August 10 vs. ARG; August 17 vs. ARG; September 28 vs. AUS England - (June 22 hosting WAL vs RSA in London); November 2 vs. NZAB; November 9 vs. AUS; November 16 vs. RSA; November 24 vs. JPN Argentina - July 5 vs. FRA; July 12 vs. FRA; August 30 vs. AUS; September 6 vs. AUS; September 20 vs. RSA Ireland - November 8 vs. NZAB; November 15 vs. ARG; November 23 vs. FIJI; November 30 vs. AUS Australia - July 6 vs. WAL; July 13 vs. WAL; July 20 vs. Georgia; August 10 vs. RSA; August 17 vs. RSA; September 21 vs. NZAB Scotland - November 2 vs. FIJI; November 10 vs. RSA; November 16 vs. Portugal France - November 10 vs. JPN; November 16 vs. NZAB; November 23 vs. ARG Japan - June 22 vs. ENG; July 13 vs. Georgia; July 21 vs. Italy; October 26 vs. NZAB USA - July 5 vs. Romania; July 12 vs. SCO; (July 19 hosting NZAB vs. FIJI); August 31 vs. Canada. Other Matches; Scotland play Canada in Ottawa, July 6; Chile in Santiago, July20; and Uruguay in Montevideo, July 27. The Barbarians will play FIJI in London on June 22, and WAL play the Queensland Reds in Brisbane on July 19. Most of the matches involving southern hemisphere teams will be shown on FloRugby (florugby.com subscription required) and several other northern hemisphere games too. Hopefully the USA matches will get good coverage - details to follow.\n\nI'm not sure how \"external\" this external review is from Rugby Australia's announcement. I have no fundamental issue with any of the individuals proposed but wonder if they are too close to, and influenced by, the current set-up, personnel and environment. Undoubtedly, the recent Eddie Jones debacle and RWC23 performance, the removal of Dave Rennie, the lack of accountability of the leadership team (Executive and Board) and the continuing downward trend in playing numbers, all need to be analysed and addressed independently and objectively, dare I say it, by a group unaffected or influenced by the current RA diaspora. I believe rugby in Australia needs a purpose and vision beyond the confines and approach of the last, largely unsuccessful, 20 years. There are lessons to be learned from the strategies adopted in Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and potentially Argentina and Japan, in what needs to be done. I don't think the game in Australia is in a position that this can be achieved overnight and consequently may require a generational plan (20 years) to deal with the shortcomings and errors of the past. We simply cannot afford to focus on the next 2-4 years alone as that type of short-termism could risk the game continuing to wither on the vine However the next 2-4 years cannot be ignored completely and I would like to understand what RA currently believes a successful outcome looks like for the game in Australia after 2 years (post-Lions), 4 years (post RWC27) and importantly what accountability and responsibility the current Executive and Board have for delivering those outcomes? #rugbyaustralia #boardsofdirectors #advisoryboard #reidmatheson #sports"
