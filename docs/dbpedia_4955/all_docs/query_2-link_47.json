        "text": "Limerick City is famous all over the world for its love of rugby.\n\nIt is also home to some of the best rugby clubs in the country like Garryowen, Young Munster, Shannon and Old Crescent.\n\nFunnily enough, Garryowen is the name given to a special kind of kind - the huge kick of the rugby ball down on top of the other team's full-back. It was in Limerick City that this kick was first used in the game.\n\nOf course, Limerick City is the home of Munster Rugby too. Munster are Ireland's most successful rugby province and their adventures in the European Heineken Cup have been a source of great pride and joy to the people of Limerick.\n\nHaving lost Heineken Cup finals to Northampton in 2000 and Leicester in 2002, Munster finally won the tournament for the first time in 2006. They beat Biarritz from France by 23 points to 19 in a match played in Cardiff.\n\nShannon, University of Limerick (UL) Bohemians and Munster rugby clubs play most of their home matches there.\n\nThomond Park is currently being rebuilt to increase the ground's capacity from 13,500 to over 25,000.\n\nIt is famous for the noise the crowd make during a match. As one rugby player put it \"When you play Munster in Thomond Park you can appreciate how the early Christians felt in the Colosseum.\"\n\nHowever, the supporters are also known for their sense of fair play. There is complete silence around the ground when anyone is attempting a kick at goal, no matter what team they are from. It is this attitude which makes Thomond Park such a special place in the hearts of all rugby fans."
