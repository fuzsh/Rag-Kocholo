        "text": "Keeshan kicks Dolphin to victory against Shannon\n\nBarry Keeshan\n\n27/10/2012 - 17:48:21\n\nShannon 13 Dolphin 31\n\nShannon's dismal start to the Ulster Bank League continued when they went down to a superior Dolphin team at Coonagh this afternoon.\n\nOut-half Barry Keeshan was hugely instrumental for the Corkmen once again, accumulating 16 points from the kicking tee and showing his class with ball in hand too.\n\nDolphin led 14-6 at the interval thanks to a penalty try in the seventh minute and flanker Rob O'Herlihy touched down after 21 minutes.\n\nShannon had taken an early led through the boot of Rob Guerin, and a superbly-taken try from Connacht's James Loxton put the Limerick giants right back into contention.\n\nThe winger made a great break down the left to touch down in the 56th minute, closing the gap to 17-13, but that was as good as it got for Stephen Keogh's youthful side.\n\nDolphin sewed up their second victory of the campaign - they are now fourth in the Division 1A standings - with a late try from bulldozing prop Christy Condon.\n\nIt was a score that had been coming as Shannon had to play with only 13 players for a spell in the second half following two yellow cards for professional fouls.\n\nDolphin, despite running out comprehensive winners, also had to dig deep in the opening period when they had a player sin-binned for repeatedly roaming offside.\n\nScorers:\n\nShannon: Try: James Loxton; Con: Rob Guerin; Pens: Rob Guerin 2\n\nDolphin: Tries: Penalty try, Rob O'Herlihy, Christy Condon; Cons: Barry Keeshan 2; Pens: Barry Keeshan 3; Drop: Barry Keeshan\n\nMatch Report Courtest of Breakingnews.ie.\n\nTough full on match between 2 \"Ordinary\" teams....difference was that Dolphin had a good Outhalf who used the conditions and had lots of experience...we kinda put a gloss on it with the 7 points from an intercept try from our 10 yard line...again standard of reffing at these matches leaves a lot to be desired, but he was equally bad to both sides. Have to say that everyone in a Shannon jersey gave 100% yesterday, and upped the game when down to 13 Men.\n\nThink a lot of the \"Bottom Feeders\" and \"Carrion\" who leave comments on this thread are doing a major disserrvice to the Clubs that they proport to follow, and have short memories of their own Club's problems. Very short term memories......and show very little Historical knowledge of the Club game....Oh ya......think they may have just discovered Rugby with the Munster Team and the redevelopment of Thomond Park......Bet they dont remember the Timber Stand with the broken Glass at either end!!!!!!! But then again their limited brains may be able to remember back to last season where, the then Champions failed to record a win for nearly half the season.....Bad news for ye Guys......Shannon RFC will not be going away!;)"
