        "text": "Shannon Underage Junior Section\n\nOnce through the minis our underage progress to youths where they get to play the full pitch at 15 a side.\n\nPlaying 15 a side takes quite a bit of getting used to, as young people develop at different stages and one cannot pigeon hole a player until they are about 15/16 years of age. We have all seen the player who has grown a foot taller between when you last saw them in April and September.\n\nIt’s important that all players’ part of any panel get to play and our policy is just that. We also instil the Shannon RFC ethos of fair play and respect before they go onto bigger things in Rugby and in life.\n\nTake any look at any underage Munster squad and you will see plenty of Shannon Players. None of this would happen if it wasn’t for the dedication of our coaches, volunteers for registration and the two shops who give up their time to help out on Sunday mornings.\n\nAll of our coaches have the necessary coaching badges and are garda vetted.\n\nUnderage at Shannon RFC is in a healthy state with 350 members, both boys and girls. We will continue to bring young children up through the ranks – playing the sport we all love.\n\nThe underage girls have a strong training panel with u14s, u16s & u18s teams who compete regularly. None of this would be possible without the hard work and dedication shown by the coaching and management personnel of the underage girls section.\n\nOur coaches have been coaching underage girls rugby in Shannon for a number of years now and have been the driving force behind the growth of the underage girls section, most nights there are up to 60 girls training in Coonagh. Ger Lawlor, Rosemary Brown, Enfys Davies, Tracy Lawlor, John Campbell, Mary Mafigan and Shari Maher Daly are an integral part of the successes seen at Shannon Girls Rugby.\n\nWe also field an u12s Girls Tag Rugby Team who train in Coonagh on a Sunday morning. This is a great way for girls to develop the basic rugby skills before they begin full contact rugby with our u14s."
