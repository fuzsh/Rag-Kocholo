        "text": "ENERGIA All-IRELAND LEAGUE DIVISION 1B\n\nShannon 29 – Naas 35\n\nWhat a game of rugby this was! Naas have a decent record against Shannon over the last number of years and they certainly enhanced it when winning a classic game in Thomond Park last Saturday. The game was played on a bitterly cold day, albeit it was dry, but the rugby certainly warmed up the large crowd in attendance.\n\nNaas played with the advantage of the breeze in the first half and stung by their defeat to Armagh the previous weekend, they tore into their esteemed rivals and had a 19 points lead built up by the interval. They took the lead within five minutes. When Shannon won a penalty they elected to kick for touch, with the line-out five yards out from the Naas line. However the Naas lock Patrick O’Flaherty – who was a late replacement for Paul Monahan - rose high and managed to deflect the ball to Ryan Casey. The latter sprinted clear and brought play to almost half-way, before passing to Paulie Tolofua who advanced play to the Shannon 22, before off loading to Conor Halpenny who sprinted clear to score under the posts. Peter Osborne added the conversion and Naas led by seven.\n\nAlthough Osborne narrowly missed a penalty after 11 minutes, he was successful with another attempt just two minutes later, when from almost the identical spot, he slotted over a chance which was won by a dominant Naas scrum.\n\nShannon were shaken by the fast Naas start and they found themselves in deeper trouble after 20 minutes. After winning a scrum on their own 10 yard line they elected to run and moved the ball out wide. However a pass by their centre Alan Flannery was gleefully intercepted by Donal Conroy and he ran in unopposed to score. With Peter Osborne again kicking the conversion Naas now led by 17 points to nil.\n\nShannon did respond on 26 minutes when a driving maul saw Lee Nicholas getting in for a try for the home side – John O’Sullivan missed the conversion – but they were rocked right back on their heels again on the half hour mark. The Shannon full-back Jamie McGarry was tackled behind his own try line by Paulie Tolofua and Naas were awarded a five yard scrum. From this the visitors were patient, going through the phases until they moved it wide, where a brilliant inside pass by Bryan Croke put Peter Osborne through to score. The same player converted to make the score line 24-5 in favour of Naas.\n\nIt was to get even better for Naas before the interval when a well worked line-out move saw them increase their advantage. From a Naas line-out 35 yards from the try line, Ryan Casey hung back as hooker John Sutton prepared to throw in. Casey suddenly sprinted into a gap created by Naas in the line-out, he was expertly found by Sutton, before making almost 20 yards. When he was hauled down he passed to the supporting Will O’Brien who shrugged off two attempted tackles to score. The conversion was missed and just on half-time Shannon got in for another try when a well worked backs move saw Darren Gavin score in the corner. That conversion was also missed, leaving Naas 29-10 in front at the break and their supporters on good terms with themselves, with a try bonus point already secured.\n\nShannon came out of the second-half charged up but it took them nine minutes to reduce the margin, which they did when following a good carry by Kelvin Brown, they moved the ball wide and Darren Gavin got in for his second try of the match. Jamie McGarry who was not having a good day with the boot again missed the conversion.\n\nThe home side were getting more and more agitated and following a brief melee on 51 minutes both sides saw a player receive a yellow card – Kelvin Brown for Shannon and Cillian Dempsey for Naas. For the next quarter of an hour Naas dealt comfortably with anything Shannon threw at them before they increased the lead on 66 minutes. Referee Daniel Carson awarded Naas a penalty when Shannon held on in a ruck, which Peter Osborne calmly slotted to make the score 32-15 in favour of Naas.\n\nShannon never gave up and on 71 minutes they got in for a third try of their own, when following a series of pick and goes they drove Naas back and Lee Nicholas got in a try. This time John O’Sullivan was successful with his kick, but any small chance of a dramatic fight-back was extinguished on 76 minutes, when Peter Osborne again found the range with a penalty that was awarded for obstruction by the Shannon backs.\n\nDeep into injury Shannon did receive the consolation of a fourth try, giving them a try scoring bonus point, when Killian Dineen scored in the corner, and John O’Sullivan with his best kick of the day got them a losing bonus point into the bargain when kicking a difficult conversion to leave the final score 35-29 to Naas.\n\nThere were great celebrations after the game by the visitors and deservedly so, as this was a magnificent victory and performance. It would be unfair to single out anybody in particular as this was a superb team effort from No 1 to 21, with everybody giving everything they had to the cause.\n\nNaas do not have a great deal of time to get over their exertions as they are back in action next Friday evening when they host St. Mary’s College. Kick-off is at 8pm and all support will be greatly appreciated.\n\nShannon: Jamie McGarry, Ikem Ugwueru, Killian Dineen, Alan Flannery, Darren Gavin, John O’Sullivan, Ethan Coughlan, Kieran Ryan, Jordan Prenderville, Luke Rigney, Lee Nicholas (capt), Sean McCarthy, Kelvin Brown, Charlie Carmody, Daniel Okeke.\n\nReplacements: Declan Moore, Darragh McSweeney, Alex Long, Richie Mullane, Ian Leonard, Jade Kriel\n\nNaas: Peter Osborne (capt), Donal Conroy, Gary Kavanagh, Matt Stapleton, Sam Cahill, Bryan Croke, Conor Halpenny, Jack Barry, John Sutton, Adam Coyle, Pat O’Flaherty, David Benn, Ryan Casey, Will O’Brien, Paulie Tolofua.\n\nReplacements: Connor Johnson, Stephen Lackey, John Waters, Cillian Dempsey, Tim Murphy, Shane Feta.\n\nReferee: Daniel Carson.\n\n(C) Photo Naas Rugby Photos"
