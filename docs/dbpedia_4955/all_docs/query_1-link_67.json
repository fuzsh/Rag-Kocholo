        "text": "Men: Training continues for the men on Wednesday and Friday nights in Castlecara at 8pm.\n\nMinis/Youth: Training continues on Saturdays at Leitrim Gaels Community Pitch at 10:30 am. Our Under 14 Saracens (Carrick & Ballaghaderreen) Youth team will be travelling to Athlone to play their first match. We wish them luck and hope they do really well.\n\nOn February 23, Carrick Minis will be travelling to Creggs for an away blitz. KO is at 10:30am, so we would like to arrive at approx 10:15. Those living near Carrick, meet at the Arch at the Landmark at 9:15am for 9:30am depart. Cars not travelling from Carrick on Shannon should please text ‘en route’ on Saturday morning in case of cancellation.\n\nOn March 2, Carrick Minis (except for Under 10s) will be having their first home blitz at the Leitrim Village Community Pitch with Donal Woods the co-ordinator. Donal will be looking for parents and friends to assist with supporting the teams, chaperoning players, helping with hospitality and cleaning up afterwards. The IRFU Connacht U-10 Blitz will also take place on March 2, in Ballina. Coaches Aidan Lenehan & Liam Farrell will be travelling with the U-10s to Ballina.\n\nFinally, the remainder of the player’s kit, shorts, socks & gum shield have been delivered to Elvery’s and is available for collection. This kit is free to all players who have contributed subs for the past five months. Don’t forget that you can also avail of Elvery’s 10% discount on any purchases made on the day that you collect the kit.\n\nDinner Dance: Carrick Rugby Club will be holding their annual dinner dance on April 19 or 20 (date to be confirmed). More details to follow, watch this space.\n\nEnd of Season event: Our season is due to end in the first two weeks of April in Leitrim Village. This is also an open invite to a fun event for friends and family to see a training session in action and have a fun afternoon. Players are asked to let their friends know that they are invited to come and see them in action and maybe to try a game of tag on the day. Any suggestions to improve this day would be greatly appreciated so please respond by email or contact Bryan Kelly & Seamus Connolly. More details to follow.\n\nFundraising: On February 10, a group of players and coaches from Carrick-on-Shannon RFC travelled up to the Aviva Stadium in Dublin to collect for the Carrick Pitch Development fund prior to the Ireland v England game. The weather was pretty miserable which had an impact on the generosity of a lot of passers-by, as most people weren’t stopping (and also on the game in the stadium!). Our CRFC Ladies team also put in a big effort by moving their Ulster Cup game in Cavan to 9am so that they could travel on to Dublin to help with the collection. The Club would like to say a special thank you to all the volunteers and especially Seamus Connolly, for organising the entire operation, raising over €1,500 for the club. We would also like to thank the following ‘celebrities’ that we knew of and were very generous with their donations to our club; Mike Ruddock (Ireland u20 coach), Mick Galwey, Paul Wallace, Aidan Power (TV celeb), Risteard Cooper (Après Match), Martin Donnellan (Ex. Assistant Commissioner) Also a very special thank you goes to Leo Varadkar and Lawrence Dallalgio for their generous donations.\n\nLadies: The Ladies’ Team welcome new members with no previous rugby playing experience necessary. Ladies’ training takes place on Tuesdays and Thursdays 7:30pm at Castlecara Rd Training ground, Carrick on Shannon."
