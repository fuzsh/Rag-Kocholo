        "text": "On another great day for the Parish club, Mick Galwey's Shannon side suffocated the pre-match favourites with a vibrant brand of intensive rugby like nothing the unfortunate Clontarf side had ever experienced before.\n\nPerhaps the final score-line was a touch flattering but in terms of controlling a competitive game, whether with or without the ball, this was as close as it gets to rugby perfection.\n\nYes, there were key moments, not least in Man of the Match Sean Cronin's inspirational try-saving tackle on Derek Keane, followed by Daragh O'Shea's penalty miss from pretty much in front of the posts almost immediately after.\n\nIn those confidence-sapping minutes Clontarf's title-winning aspirations disappeared without trace.\n\nBy contrast, Shannon's grew immeasurably as the remarkable work ethic at the core of the best club in the land came to the surface yet again.\n\nGalwey was typically humble in his post-match analysis, but in his private moments since he will have basked in a level of coaching satisfaction comparable with almost anything he achieved in his illustrious career as a player.\n\nAll the pre-match evidence pointed to 'Tarf meeting Shannon head-on up front and on that basis capitalising on their proven free-scoring potential behind.\n\nOh we of little faith. Having been on the receiving end of the 'in your face intensity' that makes Limerick and Munster rugby unique - and I'm thinking here specifically of the '77 and '78 Munster Cup finals in which the seeds for today's ongoing success were sown - the level of Saturday's winning performance should have come as no surprise.\n\nThe faces may change, indeed the game may have changed beyond recognition, but the pride in the black and blue, if anything, grows stronger by the season.\n\nThe pressure exerted by Johnny Barry, Colm Tucker, Eddie Price, Denis O'Sullivan and Eric McNamara in the critical areas in the seventies was of the same eighty-minute intensity as that of Colm McMahon, John O'Connor, Donnacha Ryan, Brian Tuohy and Eoin Cahill on Saturday.\n\nBut the Shannon game too has evolved and now it is all-embracing, with that ability to strike from anywhere at any time, and not just on turnover ball, the Galwey/Ian Sherwin model to which all others must aspire. Andrew Thompson, the player who epitomises Shannon and club loyalty best, called it spot on in the post-match euphoria when he said: \"Our defence won it today, every time they had the ball we hit them and they couldn't get any continuity.\"\n\n'Tarf will be much the better and certainly much the wiser for Saturday's experience.\n\nThey failed to do themselves justice for the simple reason they were under pressure whether with or without the ball and from first whistle to last.\n\nIt is the Shannon and the Munster way and unless it can be met physically and psychologically head-on, then there will continue to be but one outcome. Despite the doom and gloom surrounding the club game in the current climate Shannon RFC epitomises best what can be done through sheer hard graft and dedication from underage up.\n\nYear in year out, despite losing countless players to Munster and beyond, they reinvent themselves and return stronger and most worryingly younger - the effervescent Thompson included - the following campaign. Former Ard Scoil Rís hooker Cronin was the deserving AIB Man of the Match on Saturday and would have been my choice too but equally a case could have been made for Ryan, for McMahon, for Thompson, or most particularly for David Delaney. The out-half was outstanding, running the game with O'Gara-like conviction and variation. He ran Cronin a close second for overall impact.\n\nFor 'Tarf only Rob Sweeney, David O'Brien and Niall O'Brien played any way true to form, leaving Shannon undisputed All Ireland Champion Club for the third time this Millennium and for the eighth time overall.\n\nNext season the IRFU has decided that the team that finishes top of Division One will be declared the AIB AIL Division 1 winner with the winner of the subsequent play-offs declared the AIB AIL Champion club overall.\n\nAdd to that the new and expanded AIB All Ireland Cup and effectively it means three competitions open to the top sixteen clubs.\n\nThat Shannon, despite losing to Garryowen in the league and cup, are the champion club and therefore worthy All Ireland title winners for the eighth time is beyond dispute.\n\nFor the record, the official roll of honour reads Division 1 Winners: Garryowen; AIL Cup winners: Cork Con; but AIL Champion club for '06: Shannon.\n\nWinning that title in such emphatic style ought to provide a timely boost to the 12 Shannon players currently in the Munster squad.\n\nNaturally all attention now turns to Cardiff and for Munster, 'Mission Biarritz' is well and truly under way. Following the high of the Lansdowne Road semi-final it's been a bit of a leveller for Declan Kidney and his squad since.\n\nHowever, back-to-back defeats to the Ospreys and Llanelli may yet prove a blessing in disguise, despite Munster having to concede the Celtic League title to Ulster or Leinster.\n\nAdd to that a litany of injuries and with Biarritz cutting loose (57-7) in an ideal dress rehearsal drubbing of Montpellier, it's not the type of build-up Kidney or the Munster management would have wanted.\n\nCertainly Munster's scorching hit out against the Edinburgh Gunners in Thomond prior to travelling to Leinster for the Heineken Cup semi-final was hugely beneficial as a confidence booster ahead of that winner-takes-all clash.\n\nOnly by way of the outcome on Saturday will we know whether rest - ten days between the match at Stradey and this weekend's return to the Principality for the biggest game of the season - represents the most efficient way to go.\n\nGiven the walking wounded, allied to the stage in the season, I suspect the Munster management has got it just about right.\n\nJust five days to go and I'm sure feeling the pressure. God only knows how the players are coping!"
