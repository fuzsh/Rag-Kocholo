        "text": "I go to this game every year it’s on. It’s one of the best games to go to even allowing for it being stop start.\n\nI would recommend anyone that has an interest in the next generation to head to this.There are always some gems in there that you won’t have heard too much about. I didn’t hear too many for instance talking up the Munster (u19) no.8 this time last year.\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing the Munster front row, Nowaks, SE, and hopefully someone in the backs will put their hands up.\n\nWeather looks decent too.\n\nMunster well in this. Losing 10-17 at HT by my count. Munster scrum on top, front row doing very well in the tight. Munster backrow going well too. Breakdown is favouring Ireland but not by much. No back in the pitch has had much of an opportunity to show much.\n\nSheehan scored off a mail try, keily scored close to the line in one of the few passes to the outside backs."
