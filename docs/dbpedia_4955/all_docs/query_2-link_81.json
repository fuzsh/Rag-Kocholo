        "text": "The Shannon RFC player will travel to the US with the squad this weekend.\n\nThe Ireland Men’s sevens squad that will compete in the first ever Silicon Valley 7’s has today been confirmed.\n\nIreland competed at the Elche 7’s last weekend and finnished runners up to Wales and six of the squad featured in that tournament will also travel to San Jose this week.\n\nJordan Conroy, Shane Daly, Ian Fitzpatrick, Terry Kennedy, John O’Donnell and Mark Roche will all feature again this week after lining out for their country last weekend.\n\nWill Connors, Billy Dardis, Harry McNulty, Bryan Mollen, Greg O’Shea and Tim Schmidt are the six additional squad members to create a 12 man squad that will hope to feature this weekend after being left out last week.\n\nIreland will face some real stern challenges over the weekend with no less than three core World Series teams included in their pool in the form of Samoa, Canada and England.\n\nSome other high profile Men’s seven’s sides that are set to feature at the Silicon Valley Seven’s are Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and the host country, U.S.A.\n\nThe tournament will be played at the Avaya Stadium which is home to Major League Soccer side the San Jose Earthquakes and can house 18,000 spectators. It will be played over two days, the 4th and 5th of November and will also include another tournament featuring 20 collegiate side’s, an international cultural festival and an Island Concert Series.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the weekend’s action, IRFU Director of Rugby Sevens, Anthony Eddy said;\n\n“This weekend’s tournament is set to be another big test for the players selected. We’re in a challenging pool, with three core World Series sides, including last year’s runners-up England, so it’s another chance to benchmark ourselves against top class opposition.\n\nThose players who were involved in last weekend’s tournament in Elche will also need to make sure they’ve rested and recovered appropriately ahead of this weekend – this is one of the most important aspects for sides involved on the World Series, so it’s a good opportunity to replicate these conditions.”"
