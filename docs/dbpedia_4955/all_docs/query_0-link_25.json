        "text": "The Energia All-Ireland League awards were held at the beginning of this month in Bective Rangers RFC.\n\nThe Munster winners on the night were Cork Constitution’s Jack Kelleher, Nenagh Ormond’s Willie Coffey and UL Bohemian’s Fiona Hayes.\n\nShannon RFC’s Tadhg Crowe also won the Community Hero award.\n\nMen’s Division 1A Player of the Season: Jack Kelleher (Cork Constitution FC)\n\nIn just his second season at the club, Jack helped Cork Constitution to win their first Energia All-Ireland League title since 2019, playing a big role in an unforgettable final.\n\nThe powerful 22-year-old flanker made 18 starts across the league season, including the play-offs, and contributed six tries. He also showed his leadership skills as vice-captain.\n\nCapped for the first time by the Ireland Club team this year, he scored a try in their win over Portugal ‘A’ in Lisbon.\n\nMen’s Division 2A Player of the Season: Willie Coffey (Nenagh Ormond RFC)\n\nWillie captained Nenagh Ormond to a historic Division 2A title win, which will see them become the first ever Tipperary club to play Division 1B rugby next season.\n\nThe 27-year-old centre led by example, running in one of the tries of the season from halfway in their promotion-clinching win over MU Barnhall at the end of March.\n\nA former Tipperary minor hurler, he scored nine tries in all and also had a big influence defensively, with Nenagh conceding an average of just 12.38 points per game (the best across all five Men’s Divisions).\n\nWomen’s Division Coach of the Season: Fiona Hayes (UL Bohemian RFC)\n\nBack with a bang at UL Bohemian this season, Fiona guided them to a terrific Energia All-Ireland League and Cup double. Their league form was superb throughout the season, with 16 wins out of 17.\n\nThe former Ireland international, who was also Women’s Coach of the Season in 2020, has had some vital input in bringing through talented youngsters like their top try scorer Chisom Ugwueru, Kate Flannery, and Beth Buttimer.\n\nA smart and progressive coach, she now has the honour of calling herself an All-Ireland League title-winning coach and captain, having skippered Bohs to their 2017 and 2018 AIL wins, and overseen their record 14th league success as head coach.\n\nCommunity Hero Award: Tadhg Crowe (Shannon RFC)\n\nClubs from across Ireland were invited to nominate members or volunteers who go above and beyond the call of duty, and Shannon RFC’s Tadhg Crowe received the Community Hero award.\n\nThe nominees for this award have provided years of service and have volunteered for the betterment of their club many times, at all levels and over a wide range of tasks both on and off the pitch.\n\nNominations were sought from clubs around the island, with a huge quantity received from club members and supporters of the league."
