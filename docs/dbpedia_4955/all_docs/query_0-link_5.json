        "text": "Irish rugby league\n\nAll-Ireland LeagueSportRugby unionInstituted1990; 34 years ago ( )Number of teams50NationsHoldersCork Constitution (7th title) (2023–24)Most titlesShannon (9 titles)Websiteirishrugby.ie/all-ireland-leagues\n\nThe All-Ireland League (AIL), known for sponsorship reasons as the Energia All-Ireland League, is the national league system for the 50 senior rugby union clubs in Ireland, covering both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The league was inaugurated in the 1990–91 season.\n\nCork Constitution F.C are the only club to have constantly retained their status in Division 1 since 1990/91. All other clubs in the league have experienced relegation.\n\nThe league is the second highest level of rugby union in Ireland, as professional teams representing the four provinces of Ireland play in the United Rugby Championship.\n\nDivision 1 sides may field no more than two professional players in their matchday sides, and only one may be a forward. Division 2 sides may not field professional players. Foreign professional players may not play in the League. Cork Constitution, the inaugural winners, are the only club to have retained top division status since the inception of the league.[1]\n\nThe league is divided into five divisions of ten teams each. Teams play each other team in the division twice per season (once at home and once away), for a total of 18 regular-season matches.[2]\n\nThe season runs from mid-September until mid-April, with an approximately four-week break in matches from mid-December to early-January.\n\nAt the end of the season, the top four teams in division 1A enter a play off semi-finals and a final for the championship.\n\nAt the end of each season the bottom team in division 1A is replaced by the top team in division 1B, with the second-bottom team entering a promotion/relegation play-off with the second-placed team in 1B. The bottom two teams in 1B, 2A and 2B are relegated and replaced by the top two teams from divisions 2A, 2B and 2C respectively.\n\nThe two teams finishing bottom of division 2C are relegated to the relevant provincial league, and replaced by the two teams finishing top of a \"round robin\" tournament between the four provincial league winners. The four provincial junior leagues are the Connacht Junior League, the Leinster League, the Munster Junior League and the Ulster Championship League.\n\nPrior to 1990, there was no national league in Ireland. Each of the four provincial unions had its own cup and league tournament. In 1991, after almost five years of discussion and consultation with clubs, the All-Ireland League (AIL) was introduced with two divisions, division 1 with 9 clubs and division 2 with 10 clubs.[3][4][5] The AIL was expanded to four divisions in 1993–94,[6] with small variations in the numbers of teams per division in subsequent seasons.[7][8]\n\nIn 2000–01 the league was restructured to three divisions, each with 16 teams.[9] After the 1995 introduction of professionalism in rugby union, the IRFU increased the importance of the provinces, which from 2002 participated in the Celtic League (now the United Rugby Championship) as full-time teams rather than ad hoc selections of club players. Therefore, the best Irish players no longer played in the AIL. In 2004 the IRFU proposed scrapping the All-Ireland League and reintroducing a provincial league system in 2005–06 which would act as qualifiers for a curtailed three division AIL structure in the second half of the season, but this model did not receive the support of clubs or rugby pundits.[10][11] In 2007 the IRFU agreed that the structure of the All-Ireland League would remain as three divisions with 16 clubs each for seasons 2008–09 and 2009–10. In 2009–10, division 1 was split into 1A and 1B with eight teams in each as a trial and then continued in season 2010–11.[12] In 2011–12 division 1A and 1B had 10 clubs each and divisions 2 and 3 were reformatted as divisions 2A and 2B with 16 clubs in each division.[12]\n\n1990/91-1999/00\n\nSeason Title Champion Score Runner-up Venue Attendance Ref 1990–91 1st Title Cork Constitution 9-3 Garryowen [13][14]† 1991–92 1st Title Garryowen 15-11 Cork Constitution [15][16][17] 1992–93 1st Title Young Munster 17-14 St Mary's College [18][19][20] 1993–94 2nd Title Garryowen 9-3 Blackrock College RFC [21][22][23] 1994–95 1st Title Shannon 16-13 Instonians [24][25] 1995–96 2nd Title Shannon 37-12 Garryowen [26][27] 1996–97 3rd Title Shannon 28-15 Old Crescent RFC [28][29][30][31] 1997–98 4th Title Shannon 15-9 Garryowen [32][33] ‡ 1998–99 2nd Title Cork Constitution(after Extra Time) 11-6 Garryowen [34][35][36][37] 1999–00 1st Title St Mary's College 25-22 Lansdowne Rugby Club [38][39]\n\n2000/01-2008/09\n\nSeason Title Champion Score Runner-up Venue Attendance Ref 2000–01 1st Title Dungannon 46-12 Cork Constitution [40][41] 2001–02 5th Title Shannon 21-17 Cork Constitution [42][43] 2002–03 1st Title Ballymena 28-18 Clontarf [44][45] 2003–04 6th Title Shannon 22-16 Cork Constitution [46][47] 2004–05 7th Title Shannon 25-20 Belfast Harlequins [48][49] 2005–06 8th Title Shannon 30-3 Clontarf [50][51] 2006–07 3rd Title Garryowen 16-15 Cork Constitution [52][53] 2007–08 3rd Title Cork Constitution 18-8 Garryowen [54][55] 2008–09 9th Title Shannon (after Extra Time) 19-19 Clontarf [56][57] 2009–10 4th Title Cork Constitution (after Extra Time) 17-10 St Mary's College [58][59]\n\n2010/11-2019/20\n\nSeason Title Champion Score Runner-up Venue Attendance Ref 2010–11 1st Title Old Belvedere 25-19 St Mary's College [60][61] 2011–12 2nd Title St Mary's College 23-19 Young Munster [62][63] 2012–13 1st Title Lansdowne 32-25 Clontarf [64][65] 2013–14 1st Title Clontarf 27-13 Ballynahinch RFC [66][67][68]§ 2014–15 2nd Title Lansdowne 18-17 Clontarf [69][70][71] 2015–16 2nd Title Clontarf 28-25 Cork Constitution [72][73][74] 2016–17 5th Title Cork Constitution 25-21 Clontarf [75] 2017–18 3rd Title Lansdowne 19-17 Cork Constitution [76] 2018–19 6th Title Cork Constitution 28-13 Clontarf [77] 2019–20 Postponed due to COVID-19\n\n2020/21-2029/30\n\nSeason Title Champion Score Runner-up Venue Attendance Ref 2020–21 Postponed due to COVID-19 2021–22 3rd Title Clontarf 29-23 Terenure College [78] 2022–23 1st Title Terenure College 50-24 Clontarf [79] 2023–24 7th Title Cork Constitution 33-22 Terenure College [80]\n\n† From season 1990–91 through to 1996–97, the team placing top of Division 1 was crowned AIL League Champion\n\n‡ From season 1997–98, playoffs were introduced which was contested by the top four teams in Division 1 for the title of AIL League Champion; in the semi-finals the top placed team played the 4th placed team and the 2nd placed team the 3rd placed team\n\n§ The title in 2013–14 was decided on final league position; there were no play-offs.\n\nThe All-Ireland League has been historically dominated by teams from Limerick (Shannon, Garryowen, and Young Munster) who have won 13 out of 32 titles although no team from Limerick has won since 2009.
