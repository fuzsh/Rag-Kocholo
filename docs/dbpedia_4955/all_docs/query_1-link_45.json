So well organised and excellent communication from time of booking and beyond.”\n\n““My son joined the rugby club at the age of 12, he was struggling and heading down the wrong path hanging with the wrong crowds, his rugby coach took him under his wing , showed compassion and instilled self belief & confidence into him and his life and aspirations did a complete U-turn we discovered he is very talented at the sport, 100% dedicated and committed. He is a different child. Carrick rugby club did this for my son and I cannot thank them enough””\n\n“Just a quick message to commend you and your team on your impeccable communication about not just the camp but training and matches all last season. As a \"newbie\" parent it is so nice to know exactly what to expect. You have all always been great to deal with, positive, encouraging and very giving of your time. So thank you. This has not gone unnoticed.”\n\n“Just want to send a quick thank you and the team for such a well run and fun camp this week and my son enjoyed it so much and is looking forward to the season starting already .”"
