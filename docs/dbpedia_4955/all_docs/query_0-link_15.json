        "text": "Many of you will have read or listened to the news of the passing of Rob Burrow, Leeds Rhinos rugby league’s all-time great, who contracted motor neurone disease (MND) and campaigned right to the end, to raise MND awareness. Some of you may have seen the tribute this remarkable human being on BBC last night (03 June 2024), “There’s only one Rob Burrow”. Rob ended the documentary with this: “In a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream”. Words which are now inscribed on the side of Leeds Beckett University’s student union. But how does all this link to the world of events? I hear you ask…. In an industry where so much more needs to be done to open up the doors and deliver events and experiences which are truly accessible to everyone, I urge you all to do more than just dare to dream. The events industry is packed full of creative talent that has the power not just to dream, but to make pretty much anything possible. So don’t let yesterday’s news be tomorrow’s fish n chips paper. Get the conversation going with your team. Get in contact with consultants who can help you on your events accessibility and inclusion journey, and make access and inclusion part of your every-day events agenda. Let’s dare to do more than dream. #eventprofs #accessibility #eventinclusion\n\nFel hogyn sydd yn frodor o Fangor, chwith oedd gorfod trafod llwyddiant y Cofis ar Dros Frecwast ar BBC Radio Cymru bore ‘ma - ond chwarae teg, chapeau a phob lwc iddynt heno yn cynrychioli Cymru fach yn Ewrop. As a Bangor born boy and co-owner of CPD Bangor 1876 Football Club I had to swallow my pride and acknowledge and disucss Caernarfon Town’s success in Europe and the riches that are associated with that on BBC Radio Cymru this morning - chapeau and good luck to them this evening representing Cymru. The financial impact of European football on Welsh domestic football is huge - The New Saints Football Club will earn a minimum of €1.7m, CPD TREF CAERNARFON TOWN FC CYF at least €700k and Bala Town F.C. and Connah's Quay Nomads FC Ltd €325k. Considering prize money for domestic competitions only in the thousands/tens of thousands and playing budgets of most clubs between £250-500,000, a season in Europe can make a huge difference and consistent European qualification more so. However, the risk is that the gap between those clubs and rest of league grows, especially considering TNS went unbeaten last season in the league and fact that Cymru will lose one of their 4 European places this season meaning the riches of Europe will only benefit 3, not 4, clubs. This comes at a time where Football Association of Wales is seeking to reinvigorate the JD Cymru Premier\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/djjztCMF Let me open up by admitting wholeheartedly that I was a bit of a clumsy bugger on the field of play, in fact, that goes for life in general. I was frequently penalised for a variety of infringements, lurking where I shouldn't,(being off-side) the occasional stumble (falling on the opposition/ not supporting my own weight), well who could? and every often due to a lack of speed and agility and in a vain attempt to entrap a speedy, diminutive back, I would reach out and collar these escapees or outright clothes line them! I was approaching 6 foot 9 and weighed 125-135 kilos. Understand that size and weight was never considered in a citing case that I was involved with. The game was created inclusive but never had there or should there be one rule for one, another rule for the other. The different statures and skill sets make the game. I was dealt the necessary punishment and told to go away and work on my technique, discipline and probably my core stability! Ultimately you do what you can. We are living in a different rugby world and the rules have changed, the stakes are higher and so are expectations. High tackles are now the subject of much debate and it is a contentious issue. I occupy this space daily and scrutinising such incidents is what I do. A census of the various power bodies in Rugby Union have chosen to use rule changes and punitive changes to mitigate the risk and reduce the numbers of head blows and therefore concussion. My passion is seeing the game thriving and making sure the health and wellbeing of the players is protected. The yellow card and subsequent red issued to Owen Farrell verses Wales at the weekend was totally justified under the new guidelines. At the hearing, it was then decided that a \"late change in dynamics\" due to George's involvement in the contact area \"brought about a sudden and significant change in direction from the ball carrier\" So what happens each and every time someone like Cheslin Kolbe, Shane Williams MBE Msc or Jason Robinson OBE are the ball carrier! They suddenly and significantly change in Direction! Really? Much as I respect the talent and competitive edge that Farrell brings to the team, I am afraid that with his record of previous offences and showing little evidence of behavioural change, the punitive measures should have been greater and as a leader and ambassador for the game, might want to look at a change in his tackle technique. Easier said than done, but I suspect if kicking tees were banned, he would alter and adjust his technique and prove that he is up to the task. It is a lot easier to change behaviour than a physical state and structure. I did shed a ton of weight to stop Jason Leonard complaining when lineout lifting got introduced! This is not about Farrell, it is about preservation of the game and the elite setting the example.\n\nMake Lansdowne great again… Dear IRFU, The atmosphere at rugby matches is waning due to increased corporate presence and related excessive drinking. What’s been done is not enough and ignores several drivers which your peers are grappling with. Hate to say it but Jamie George's efforts to revive Twickenham's fan experience with simple measures like altering the players' entrance and playlist adjustments have potential. However, ultimately the IRFU must reengage with its true rugby fans over corporate spectators. The tepid vibe this great article brings out is an issue we cannot overlook. Prioritising the allocation of tickets to real enthusiasts and managing drinking habits rather than lip service could enhance the atmosphere, reminiscent of what's seen at AIL, GAA and FAI Cup finals. Emulating Twickenham's and the WRU proactive stance, the IRFU should forge stronger ties with its fans. This can be achieved by more mindful ticket distribution and by adopting policies that encourage fervor and discourage overconsumption of alcohol particularly in the stands. In order to get that Lansdowne roar back the IRFU needs to align its actions with core rugby values to reignite the passion at Lansdowne Road and stop selling its soul to the corporates and boozers\n\nAre we measuring Southgate on managing a team in a League or a Tournament? The roller-coaster we have been on during the Euros throws up some real issues about coaching and leading teams in Leagues and planning and delivering Tournament success. Why as they are completely different to plan and deliver. A Premier League Coach/Manager has ten months to drill his patterns of play, principles and approaches to defence, transition and offence. This is the same within any Team sport. Southgate selected a team for the first game from eight different Clubs with a varied approach to the patterns of those three principles of team play. Those coaches will have drilled those players to ensure they applied this during the season. If the ball goes, there you go there and pass it there etc. So, Southgate’s most of the players for two weeks before the start of the tournament and with Bellingham a week before. Many players will be on a tapper down on their physical conditioning preparing for off-season not a highly intense tournament. In addition, the opposition have had two plus months to prepare and as England are a top team they will have constructed a “Park the bus” approach with transition into nicking a goal and hanging on, with an assumption that England will not have had time to plan and prepare. The stats on the Euros and World Cip are clear, teams that do not concede win the tournament, not those going toe-to-toe as in the Premier League. So, for me the group and last 16 was inevitable because Southgate knows how too long in a tournament and so his first two weeks were on re-conditioning the players and making sure defensively, they were sound. So, we got what we did. Now he has built the offence and players are now fully engaged and not in fear of going out. In addition, Southgate has clearly learnt from previous tournaments with substitution and changing formation. This does not guarantee a win on Sunday but that is now down the players. So, stop expecting Premier League this is a Tournament. So COME ON ENGLAND! #comeonengland #england 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚽️🥅🏟️🏆🤞😬😱😰😟\n\nmore-proof-that-scottish-football-is-a-joke! Do we need any more proof that Scottish football is a joke - well, it's always good to know just how bad it is. Today, on the Radio we had Derek Adams (RossCountyMgr) criticized again for telling us Scottish football was terrible. Yet another so-called expert came up with the well-thought-out conclusion that Derek's comments were \"rubbish\" - given the comment was months ago it's clearly hurting. Yes, no back up to this statement but another repeat of \"rubbish\" should work - well, after all, they are experts. But, after some discussion by these highly skilled Scottish football commentators they actually came to the conclusion that Scottish football is indeed, VERY POOR! So, Mr Adams is correct but hammered for his candour - This is just so Scottish Football. Thereafter, we were assured it was the \"DRAMA\" of Scottish football that made it exciting. Therefore, poor football but with drama is acceptable. Is this the drama of many alleged dodgy referees; sectarian \"banter\"; overpaid players; terrible recruitment; grounds largely with no atmosphere; too many tiny clubs; favoritism towards Glasgow clubs by officials; poor quality football?? Just ask Chairmen, Directors, Captains, Managers, Coaches, Players, Fans & they'll tell you exactly what it's like. Crikey, even the Ross County Chairman said Adams had a point! Scottish football is a non-event and is quite frequently about as ugly as football gets. All IMHO allegedly. https://lnkd.in/eziK56Ax\n\nAnother failure of governance in Australian rugby. Why do I care to comment beyond being a frustrated fan? It’s a great case study of the absolute criticality of governance in business transformation. What do I know about rugby to justify commenting? I know a hell of a lot about governance in business transformation, and enough about rugby, to recognise how the failure of rugby’s stuttering program to improve itself, and future failures, follow inevitably from what are recognised in business transformation governance as faulty fundamentals. The NRL outmanoeuvre Rugby because the N stands for National: it’s a proper peak body with appropriate powers to make decisions of national significance for the game. The ARU by contrast is an afterthought, an add on vainly trying to “influence” the State bodies to agree that any given matter is of national significance, to see it the same way, to come to the same conclusions, to agree on a way forward and to execute the plan in a coordinated and cooperative manner. It never happens because of power dynamics and self defeating politics between the States. Centralisation failed under McLennan and is failing under Waugh, not due to their talents and efforts but for fundamental reasons. It’s not something that can be fixed incrementally, without radical surgery leading to the establishment of an entirely new governance structure, a proper peak National body and appropriate mission-aligned division of powers. That will require winding up the current corporate structures and starting again …or, of course, waiting for them to be compulsorily wound up in Administration and salvaging whatever wreckage is left. It’s usually better to act than react but the existing power centres won’t even acknowledge the true nature of the underlying problem as they chug down another chardy. #rugby #governance #transformation #managementlearning"
