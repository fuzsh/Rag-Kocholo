        "text": "In a pre-season friendly against Shannon and fielding our first ever women’s 2nd development team our Robins were very convincing and entertaining in a strong display of open Rugby at the 4G on Friday evening,\n\nIt was refreshing to see such skills and ball handling by a team most of whom had never played together and after such a lay-off due to Covid. The result of intensive coaching sessions by Niamh Briggs (Head Coach), Hillary Cleary (S&C) Sarah O’Gorman (Forwards Coach) and Paudie Cox over the Summer were really in evidence.\n\nThe first score came after 5 minutes and was quickly followed by a succession of well taken tries. There was beautiful teamwork and interlinking by both sides & the Shannon team made great efforts but never gave up and came close on a few occasions.\n\nWe want to thank Shannon RFC for the season opener friendly.\n\nThe scorers were:\n\nAoife Corey, Shannon Dawson and Helen McDermott. Claire Bennett, Rebecca O’Shea, Michelle Ring and Louise Costello. Conversions were added by Helen McDermott and Courtney Duhig.\n\nWith such talent on display it was difficult to determine who would receive the player of the match award and this was eventually awarded to newcomer to senior rugby Laura Stritch. Laura played rugby at underage with UL Bohemian and it was a great to see Laura make her senior debut.\n\nWe want to wish all our new caps a huge congratulations.\n\nReport By John Keane\n\nUL Bohemian RFC Women’s Up Coming Fixtures"
