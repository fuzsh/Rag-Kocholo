        "text": "Our men’s team is currently a member of the Rugby Nova Scotia Division 1 and Divison 2.\n\nWe are committed to excellence and as a result, have a diverse and competitive pool of players. Our primary goals are to give our player base the ability to play rugby at the highest level and to promote our sport positively in the community.\n\nWe welcome any potential member to feel free to come to one of our training sessions or to join us in any of our numerous social events. We have various teams available for different rugby skills and ages and provide a safe and informed atmosphere for learning the game.\n\nHalifax Tars RFC are a member of the Rugby Nova Scotia Union (RNS). We have had a long and proud history of fielding two Senior Men’s teams consistently for many years. We believe in the mandates and core values of RNS and strive to promote the spirit of the sport.\n\nOur Division A side currently competes in the yearly competition for the McCurdy Cup against other clubs from Nova Scotia and PEI. ​This is the premier competition for amateur club rugby in the Maritimes. The winner of the McCurdy Cup advances to play the winner from New Brunswick for the Caledonia Cup. This competition serves as an important source for player growth and development and provides the launch point for further opportunities for selection at provincial, national and professional levels\n\nOur Division B side currently competes in the yearly competition for the Shannon Cup against other clubs from Nova Scotia and PEI. The winner of the Shannon Cup advances to play the winner from New Brunswick for the Wheaton Cup. It provides a less competitive opportunity for players of all levels to get involved. Players have the opportunity to gain experience in the sport and to enjoy the social benefits of participation. Whether you’re new to rugby or a veteran winding down their career, this division provides the chance to play for anyone interested in becoming a member of the Tars brotherhood.\n\nBoth sides train together to ensure there is opportunity for players of all ages and experience levels to grow and enjoy the sport of rugby."
