        "text": "MY FAMILY\n\nBefore I start talking about playing for Munster and Ireland, I’ll start with the people who got me there. The people who step onto the pitch with me every day: My Family. From my Grandmother right down to my little brothers - my entire family have played a huge role in allowing me to chase my dream as a professional rugby player and they all continue to play a massive part in my daily life.\n\nRugby has always been a huge part of my family's life. My Father is like part of the furniture at Cork Constitution Rugby Club and its here where I first got introduced to the great game of rugby.\n\nMY RUGBY FAMILY\n\nIn a way, the people I’ve played rugby with since I was a kid are like an extended family. I started playing with Cork Con at 5 years old and managed to make the Under-8s team that year! I became captain of a rugby team for the first time when playing with Con at Under-12’s level. After that, I focused on schools rugby with Pres Cork – one of the best rugby schools in Munster.\n\nIn 2007, we won the Munster schools Senior Cup together at Pres Cork. The next year, I was Captain, which was a huge honour. After school, I played for my home club Cork Con and we won the All-Ireland League and the AIB Senior Cup in 2010. It was the first and only time an Irish club team has ever won the double. It’s one of my proudest achievements in rugby.\n\nFor now, I’m honoured to be Captain of Munster and to be a part of a fantastic Irish team."
