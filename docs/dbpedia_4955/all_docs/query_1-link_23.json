        "text": "Major League Rugby expansion side Old Glory DC played their first ever match against Irish club side Shannon RFC on Sunday. More than 2,300 fans showed up to take in the historic occasion, and were treated to an exciting if slightly spiky contest.\n\nAmong those lining up for Old Glory were Rugby League international Ryan Burroughs and former Austin Elite pair Michael Reid and Vetekina Malafu. Shannon were short of name players but were led by dominant second row Ronan Coffey and livewire halfback Aran Hehir."
