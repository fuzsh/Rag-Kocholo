Through a long career with the U.S. Agency for International Development, she gave a lifetime of service to making the world a better place.\n\nMary was born in 1932 in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, the third of four children of Dr. Robert H. and Kathleen Butt Huntington. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Arkansas in 1954 and went on to earn a Masters in Advanced International Studies from Johns Hopkins University. In addition, Mary studied at the Sorbonne as a Fulbright scholar, and completed a fellowship at the Princeton School of International and Public Affairs.\n\nWith her sharp mind and a desire for public service, Mary began her decades-long career with the US Foreign Service. She would eventually find her home with the newly established U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), instituted by the Kennedy administration in 1962. Born out of the post WWII Marshall Plan and various initiatives from Truman’s Point Four Program, USAID’s mission was to provide technical knowledge to improve social, economic, and political conditions in ‘underdeveloped’ nations.\n\nKnown for her administrative skill in a diplomatic world dominated by men, Mary garnered the respect and admiration of her peers. Over the course of her distinguished career, she served as USAID Director of Laos Affairs (1974), Program Officer in Damascus, Syria (1982), and Deputy Director in Swaziland (1991).\n\nTo her family and friends, Aunt Mary was at once both a formidable intellect and a quick- witted bon vivant with an infectious laugh and a talent for stimulating conversation. She had refined tastes in art and music and entertained with an epicurean flourish. She is remembered as a loyal and generous friend and a shining example of independence and achievement to her extended family. She was a treasure.\n\nShe is pre-deceased by her brother, Dr. F. K. Huntington, and sister, Lynn Premselaar. She is survived by her brother Robert H. Huntington of Portland, OR and eight nieces and nephews.

She was 79 years old.\n\nA public health scientist, world traveler, lifelong learner, and artist, Marge was born in Hartford Connecticut to Chester and Marjorie Koblinsky. She showed an early aptitude for leadership and teamwork as Senior Class President and head cheerleader at Manchester High School. Marge graduated from Simmons College and earned a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Columbia University, furthering her education with a Certificate of Community Medicine and Health.\n\nDr. Koblinsky dedicated her life to improving health outcomes for mothers and infants throughout the world. As Project Director of MotherCare at John Snow, Inc., she led initiatives to develop, implement, and evaluate community-based approaches to maternal and infant health in developing countries, including Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Guatemala. Marge connected and collaborated with local community members and public health professionals to understand women’s experiences and develop best practices for improving their healthcare. Her work significantly reduced maternal and infant mortality and newborn illness in these regions.\n\nMarge contributed her leadership, research, and mentoring skills in many other influential positions. As Senior Maternal Health Advisor at USAID, she led the agency’s development of a global initiative to “End Preventable Maternal Mortality.” As Director of the Public Health Sciences Division at the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, she worked closely with Bangladeshi researchers and policy makers for almost a decade to improve the health of Bangladeshi women and children. Her extraordinary vision, passion, and expertise also enriched her work at Save the Children, the Ford Foundation, and the Canadian International Development Research Center.\n\nA mentor to countless public health students and professionals, Marge’s research, books, and publications have advanced knowledge of how to define and measure maternal mortality, achieve healthy pregnancies and safe deliveries, and implement effective reproductive health programs. These contributions have been recognized with prestigious awards, including the NCIH International Health Award (1993) and the World Health Day Award of the American Association for World Health (1998).\n\nBeyond her professional achievements, Marge was a magnificent and caring mother, sister, and friend. She inspired others with her intellect, creativity, warmth, and generosity. Marge loved spending time with family and friends, walking her faithful dog Raffi at neighborhood parks and Rock Creek, attending Osher courses, practicing yoga, and tending her garden. She created beautiful watercolor paintings and unique beaded jewelry that are treasured gifts.\n\nMarge leaves behind her son Evan Henrich and wife Paige; sister Sharon; brother Chet (Sally); nephew John (Rachel; sons Otto and Hugo); former husband Richard Henrich, and countless friends. The Koblinsky family especially appreciates Marge’s wonderful friends and caregivers who lifted her spirits daily, attended medical appointments, and prepared delicious meals throughout her illness. Marge will forever be remembered for her keen wit, joyful spirit, and loving kindness, as well as her legacy as a trailblazer who brought hope and better health to women and children around the world.\n\nServices are private but memorial donations can be made to BRAC, an international nonprofit that has established a public health scholarship for Bangladeshi women honoring Marge. https://bracusa.org/donation/?form=Marge A Celebration of Life is planned for July 29.

Roberto was born on April 14th, 1934, in Jauja, Peru. Roberto was the son of the late Pedro Nemesio Castro Villarreal and Dolores Teodora Suarez Chavez. Roberto graduated from the National Agrarian La Molina University in Lima, Peru, where he met Marcela Carmen Acevedo whom he married in January 1959. In 1967, Roberto came to America and settled in Raleigh, North Carolina to pursue a new life in a new country with a new dream, together with his wife and two children where they soon welcomed their third and fourth child. Coming from a region with little education beyond 8th grade, Roberto graduated from North Carolina State University with a Masters in Economics and a Doctorate in Philosophy in 1973. Roberto then established a successful and storied career with the United States Agency for International Development, where his 25 years of service made a profound impact throughout Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.\n\nRoberto served as the wise, patient, and kind patriarch of the larger Castro family and was a devout follower of Christ and member of St. Leo the Great Catholic Church. Roberto’s love of God and Peru led to establishing multiple Hermandades de los Señor de los Milagros in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, and America. An avid traveler and epicurean, Roberto visited over sixty countries throughout the world and had many stories to tell from his adventures. From the jungles of the Amazon to the peaks of Nepal to the beaches in the Caribbean and plains of Africa, Roberto loved experiencing other cultures and societies. He enjoyed hiking the Inca Trail in the Andes and often spoke fondly of his time in The Dominican Republic where the family spent time at Boca de Yuma and Boca Chica snorkeling, kayaking, windsurfing, and fishing.\n\nA passionate agriculturalist, Roberto altruistically shared his time and knowledge which made a dramatic change not only in his hometown of Jauja, where he planted thousands of trees through a non-profit agricultural-based initiative, but also in shaping the next generation of agriculturalists and farmers in Central America and the United States.\n\nRoberto’s kind nature was welcome everywhere he went and no one knew it better than his children, grandchildren, and great grandchild. Roberto embodied a strength of spirit and perpetual determination to advance in all that he did, which his children took to heart in their own lives, leading them to great success. Most importantly, Roberto always emphasized to everyone to honor and love God, to cherish the people in our lives, to appreciate the earth – the trees, the beaches, the mountains, and the fresh air, and to always give back.\n\nRoberto is pre-deceased by brother Pablo Landeo Suarez and survived by his wife of 65 years, Marcela Carmen Castro Acevedo, brother Pedro Castro Suarez of Lima, Peru, sister Violeta Castro Suarez of Lima Peru, brother Fernando Luis Landeo Suarez of Pflugerville, Texas, sister Alejandra Zenaida Ormeño of Pflugerville, Texas, son Ricardo Antonio Castro (Delia Farfán Decerra) of Rockville, Maryland, grandson Antonio Alejandro Castro-Ossorio (Gizem Yucel), great-granddaughter Vanessa Imani Castro-Yucel, daughter Carmen Margarita Castro (Juan Carlos Surinach) of Fairfax, Virginia, grandson Juan Enrique Surinach, grandson Daniel Alexander Surinach, daughter Marcela Elizabeth Curtis (Daniel) of Annandale, Virginia, grandson Nathaniel Peter Curtis, daughter Susana Patricia Douglas (Jimmy) of Columbia, Maryland, granddaughter Marissa Leilani Douglas, granddaughter Coral Sierra Douglas, and granddaughter Adalae Miriam Douglas.\n\nThe family will receive friends to celebrate Roberto’s life at Demaine Funeral Home (Main St) in Fairfax, Virginia on Monday, May 6th from 6:00-8:00 pm. The Funeral Mass will be held at Saint Leo the Great Catholic Church on Tuesday, May 7th at 1:00 pm followed by burial at Pleasant Valley Memorial Park at 2:30 pm.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to Roberto Castro’s Tree Reforestation Program in the Andes and Amazon Rainforest.\n\nJudith Davis Johnson\n\nJudith “Judy” Davis Johnson passed away peacefully on June 11, 2024, from complications of dementia. Judy was born in Washington, DC, in 1942 to Howard and Ruth Davis and grew up in Arlington, Va. She graduated from William & Mary in 1964, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, before marrying fellow alum Edward Q. Johnson in 1966 and embarking on a 30-year career with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Rising from secretary to contracting officer and ultimately to division chief, she oversaw contracts for civilian foreign aid and development assistance in the Asia-Near East bureau. Highlights of her career and post-retirement consultancy included trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan following the end of the Soviet-Afghan War in 1989, as well as assignments in Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, Iraq, and beyond.\n\nJudy retired to Charleston, SC, where she lived for 20 years and remained active in music, arts, history, and conservation. She is survived by her children Capt. Edward Davis Johnson, USN (Stephanie), and Katherine Johnson Gordon (Quin); three grandchildren; her former husband, Edward Johnson; and her sister, Katherine Richardson (William). A memorial service will be held at Grace Church Cathedral in Charleston on Sept. 14 at 11 a.m. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to South Carolina’s Coastal Conservation League.

Dean touched many lives, leaving a legacy reflective of his gentle manner and southern charm. Born in Norfolk, Virginia on August 31, 1956, to Paul Howard Pittman and Betty Pittman, Dean was six when the family moved to his father’s hometown of Tylertown, Mississippi. Growing up in a small town with his sisters Shane and Elise, his childhood was filled with Sunday dinners at his grandmother’s house, neighborhood games of kick the can, scouting adventures, school, and sneaking off to the bakery in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nPerhaps working as a cub reporter and photographer for the family business, the Tylertown Times, sparked his interest in politics. Considered one of the nation’s best small-town newspapers, the Tylertown Times was a principled voice for equality and progress during the tense civil rights movement. Through her many efforts to promote tolerance and fairness, his mother was a voice of reason in this era. Moved by the example of his parents, Dean developed a love for political participation, a strong sense of place, service, and ethics.\n\nWhile earning a B.A. in political science from Millsaps College in Mississippi, Dean interned with Senator Ted Kennedy. After graduation, Dean entered the Peace Corp teaching English in a remote village in Gabon. Heading to Washington, D.C., Dean dove into the flurry of political life, working as a Legislative Assistant for U.S. Congressman Wayne Dowdy for eight years and subsequently as his reelection campaign manager. Propelled by a keen interest in politics and international affairs, Dean received an M.A. from The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies before joining the Department of State in 1989.\n\nThroughout his career, Dean served in numerous senior leadership positions within the State Department, at the National Security Council, and overseas. He quickly became known as a talented leader with significant policy and management expertise. He sought out opportunities to serve in conflict prone states, promoting peacebuilding, and reconciliation, and taking difficult stances guided by his core ethical principles. His early postings included Guyana, Mozambique, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as a year as a diplomat in residence with the National Democratic Institute (NDI), focusing on democracy-building initiatives.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2002, Dean served at the National Security Council as the Director for Balkan Affairs, coordinating all of U.S. Government efforts bringing stability to this conflict-affected region. While special assistant to Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, Dean volunteered to go to Iraq when few others would consider such a risky mission. Once in the Green Zone, as the Deputy Director in the Governance Office of the Coalition Provisional Authority, Dean assisted Iraq’s transition to an Interim Iraqi Government and engaged with provincial teams to improve governance throughout the country. It was in Iraq that Dean met his future husband, Chris Milligan, a USAID Foreign Service Officer.\n\nDean served as Consul General in Belfast, Northern Ireland from 2004 to 2007, where he furthered peace and reconciliation actively engaging with political and community leaders and building intercommunity cooperation. His efforts contributed to a power sharing arrangement and increased stability, a legacy which is still felt today. While a member of the Secretary’s Office of Policy Planning, Dean was appointed Senior Diplomacy Advisor to the Department’s First Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review instituting reforms that improved the effectiveness of the State Department and USAID. First as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary and then as the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, Dean leveraged the contributions of multilateral organizations and allies to advance U.S. foreign policy goals. Dean returned to Mozambique as the U.S. Ambassador in 2016. He was thrilled to be back in a country that meant so much to him, embracing the cultures, music and its natural beauty, travelling extensively to connect with communities across the country.\n\nRetiring in 2019, Dean read extensively, particularly about American history. He enjoyed travelling, tennis, and cooking with and for friends. Always generous with words and smiles, he will be remembered for his gumbo and martinis, wit and intelligence, and warmth and character. He is survived by his husband, Chris Milligan, his mother, Betty Pittman, and his sisters, Shane Pittman and Elise Pittman, his mother-in-law, Ann Milligan, his brothers-in-law, Mike McLenagan, Peter Milligan, Mark Milligan, sister-in-law Liz Milligan, and nieces and nephews (Callie, Erin, Hayley, Devin, Harper, Ava, Maggie, Gabriel, and Luke).\n\nA Celebration of Life will take place at a later date this year.\n\nSusan Collins Russell\n\nSusan Collins Russell, age 86, a resident of Washington, DC, died on February 2, 2024, at Georgetown University Hospital. The cause of death was a hemorrhagic stroke resulting from a fall. Born on April 24, 1937, she was the daughter of Joseph Kinney Collins and Grace Mullowney Collins. She spent her childhood and young adult years in Boston, Massachusetts. She attended Newton College of the Sacred Heart, graduating in 1959.\n\nShe met her husband, Ron, while teaching elementary school students in the Boston area. Upon marriage she joined Ron in Sabah, Malaysia, where he had moved to work for the Ford Foundation. They started a family in Malaysia, and their life of travel continued when Ron joined the U.S. Agency for International Development. During his career with USAID, he was posted to Argentina, Bolivia, and Panama. She was active all these years in the communities where they lived, while simultaneously running a household.\n\nAs her children grew older, she returned to teaching. Following a permanent move back to Washington, she worked at the Department of State, processing freedom of information requests.

Easley, passed away unexpectedly in Washington, D.C., on May 13, 2024. Susan, a career Foreign Service Officer, was in the United States following her assignment in the USAID/Sudan Mission as the Supervisory Executive Officer, and was on her way to serve in a critically important role in South Sudan. Susan leaves behind her two sons whom she absolutely adored and admired, Devin and Gavin Easley, and mother, Mary Kintu. Our deepest sympathies are with them and all of her family and friends during this devastating time.\n\nFor more than 37 years, Susan dedicated her life to service, including 22 years in the U.S. Army as a Commissioned Officer. During that time, she worked on DoD-sponsored HIV/AIDS programs in Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. She joined USAID in 2009 as an Executive Officer and served overseas in Ghana/West Africa, Afghanistan, Uganda, South Sudan, Haiti, and Sudan. While in Washington, D.C. beginning in 2018, she was the Acting Division Chief for the Overseas Management and Travel and Transportation Divisions supporting Executive Officers in the field and travel customers around the globe. USAID benefited greatly from her enduring commitment to public service and the steady leadership she demonstrated throughout, particularly in times of crisis.\n\nSusan was a trusted colleague and friend to many and she was clearly proud of her two sons, Gavin and Devin. In conversations with her colleagues during trips to the field or over a meal, she always lit up when speaking about them. As a mother, she spoke of how much she wanted to instill a sense of empowerment and proactivity in them, to not wait for others to solve problems. She was so proud of how they grew into adulthood – a testament to their characters and the relationships they cultivated.\n\nSusan’s legacy will live on through the many USAID colleagues and friends who deeply admired her ability to keep the big picture in view while demonstrating unrelenting service to others. We extend our deepest sympathies to Susan’s family, friends, and community.\n\nSusan is carried in the memories and hearts of all who knew her. You can reflect on and honor her memory by signing this virtual memorial book or the physical book that will be located in the lobby of the USAID Annex at 500 D Street starting on May 17, 2024.\n\nOffice of Origin: M/MS/OMD, Notice Category: General Personnel\n\nDate of Announcement: May 16, 2024, Distribution: USAID/General Notice\n\nAny questions concerning this notice may be directed to:\n\n— Everton J.

He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.\n\nThough Bill traveled widely for his work and in retirement with his wife Linda, he always considered Pittsburgh his home, and it is fitting that he returned there for his last voyage, where he was interred on March 15, 2024.\n\nPublished by The Washington Post on Mar. 31, 2024.\n\nKurt Keith Kunze\n\nKurt Keith KUNZE, retired Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), died December 14, 2023, in Salem, Virginia, at the age of 80.

The last surviving Nisei of eight children born to Harumi and Shizuka Yamasaki, immigrants from Japan, she was so small her siblings carried her around their cooperative San Joaquin Valley farm in a bucket and compared her to a bird, especially after a spill broke her arm, prompting a wing- like splint.\n\nAs a teenager her entire family was incarcerated due to their ancestry without any legal trial or formal charges (despite the 14th Amendment guaranteeing her the full rights of American citizenship). Ada chose to focus on the positive aspects of imprisonment (behind barbed wire with armed guards facing inward) and, socializing with a larger peer group than farm life would allow, her new clique of ‘sophisticated girls’ called themselves “the Continentals.” She recounted prewar, Depression era farm life sitting on the water tower cross-brace watching distant trains, dreaming of traveling far away from scrubbing carrots in freezing ditch water for market. Camp prisoners were allowed to leave confinement if they could secure a job on the East Coast and Ada traveled days alone by train having acquired a job in a frozen vegetable processing plant. Upon arrival she found the company had gotten “Yamasaki” typed as “Yamaski” – once seeing she didn’t seem to be Polish, they told her the position wasn’t available. Fortunately, her older sisters already back East were able to help her find another job as a domestic worker. (Learning later that the FBI mistakenly identified her as “Amy” in her war file, she adjoined that typo to her birth name, saying she tired of childhood teasing of being called “Aduh….”).\n\nThe wartime experiences and lifelong prejudices she experienced scarred her deeply, but Amy Ada persevered and demonstrated grace and fortitude in maintaining a positive outlook on life. Postwar she returned home and attended Modesto Junior College where she met Joe Haratani, a gangly 442nd Regimental Combat Team mortar squad veteran, who had been incarcerated with his family in the same camp as the Yamasakis. Holding 8,000 displaced souls, they never met at ‘Camp Amache’, “Granada War Relocation Center”, in the sand blown Colorado desert; but in Modesto they fell in love and Joe gave her the world. His engineering career with the United States Agency for International Development enabled them to travel the globe while Amy Ada pursued her dreams of motherhood, teaching, painting, socializing, and enjoying life on a level of sophistication that the Continentals would swoon over.\n\nMorphing into the first ever Peace Corps Volunteer family (3 dependents) she set up house in a wood & lava rock shack in the Galápagos Islands. Amy Ada demonstrated her own adaptability to living with rudimentary water, power & resources. She befriended many from all walks and even spent weeks camping on remote Hood Island assisting two female researchers from the Charles Darwin Station. This rugged lifestyle enabled her to adjust to her third quarter of life when the Haratani family settled near the gold rush town of Columbia, California. Nixon scuttled their retirement plans, leaving them cash strapped while Joe sought a stopgap federal job (thank you USFS !). While dealing with harsh winters, power outages (no water) and woodstove heat, Amy Ada continued her work ethic with a variety of jobs ranging from roadside fruit selling, receptionist at the local junior college, to office work at the Employment Development Department (where she sadly encountered racism by an administrator which resulted in her leaving the job but eventually winning a protracted legal suit).\n\nWeathering adversity, both parents rebounded over time to become a successful overseas consultant (Joe), and a beloved painter of landscapes and abstracts. Amy Ada also continued her education earning her Masters degree in education. Joe and Amy Ada consistently worked the long hours required of poll workers near their final Sonora home, not for the minimal pay, but because they knew the vital necessity of participating in a hard-won democracy. From each sons’ birth, Amy Ada instilled a passion for reading, justice and knowledge…\n\nAmy Ada is survived by sons Guy (Joyce), Richard (Kathleen), and Saji (Nicole) and their daughter Jazmine and son Jean-Patrik and myriad nieces and nephews and their families. She was preceded in death by her husband Joe. She was well cared for by her second husband Heinie. A Celebration of Life will be held March 23, 2024, in Tuolumne County in conjunction with a tribute to Joe whose memorial was postponed due to the pandemic. In lieu of flowers and gifts please vote to preserve equal rights and opportunity. (The dual Amy and Joe remembrance will immediately follow a “Pebbles in a Pond” presentation on community engagement, including a story from their life. Resilience Center 18241 Bay Avenue, Tuolumne, California. Full program begins at 2 p.m., Amy & Joe portion will start after 3:45 p.m.)\n\nPublished by The Washington Post on Mar. 17, 2024.\n\nAchsah Nesmith\n\nAchsah Nesmith, a former journalist who covered the Civil Rights Movement and later became a speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, died March 5, 2024, after a brief illness. Mrs. Nesmith, who lived in Alexandria, VA, was 84.\n\nOne of the first women to be hired as a speechwriter for a U.S. president, she worked for President Jimmy Carter for all four years of his administration. She collaborated with him and Rosalynn Carter on the book Everything To Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life and also wrote his Nobel speech in 2002. Rolling Stone magazine said she was President Carter’s favorite scribe.\n\nMrs. Nesmith prided herself in finding the right words, free of government-speak and cliches, to help the president express himself – in his own words. “It’s not that you put these great words in his mouth and he spouts them out like a puppet,” she once told a journalist. “Speechwriters are not ventriloquists—they are helpers.”\n\nEudora Achsah Posey was born on Nov. 16, 1939, in Atlanta, Georgia, daughter to Eudora and Frank Posey, a nurse and a storekeeper. She attended Southern Methodist University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1961. While at SMU, she worked as a freelancer and talent scout for Mademoiselle magazine and was featured in a photo spread on the fashion of college “coeds.” After university, she worked for the Atlanta Constitution, covering federal courts, the legislature and key moments in the Civil Rights Movement. That’s where she met a peanut farmer named Jimmy Carter who was running for governor. She covered his campaign, following him all over the state of Georgia.\n\nShe also wrote Martin Luther King’s front-page obituary for the Constitution and covered several Apollo missions. It was in the Constitution parking lot where she met Jeff Nesmith, a journalist who would become her husband of nearly 57 years and with whom she covered those Apollo missions. Mr. Nesmith died last year. Achsah was extraordinarily proud of the day that President-elect Carter’s chief of staff called and offered her a job, which she turned down because she said she was busy raising two little children. She recounted how when she told her husband about the call that evening, he insisted that she try to get that chief of staff back on the phone and take that job. She cherished the fact that, at a time when many men would not have considered uprooting their own careers because of their wife’s career, Mr. Nesmith insisted on it, telling her “I can raise babies.” Their partnership taught their children more than any book could have, and they insisted their children read all the books.\n\nThe family moved to Washington in 1977. After the Carter administration ended after one term, Mrs. Nesmith spent several years freelancing and volunteering in their church, the Old Presbyterian Meeting House. She later worked as a speechwriter for Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and as a writer in the communications office of the United States Agency for International Development.\n\n“Achsah had a quiet and caring but very strong voice, with a depth of knowledge across many areas,” said former Sen. Nunn. “She was a talented and wonderful partner for those of us in the arena of public service. I was very proud to be the beneficiary of Achsah’s wonderful character, her wisdom and her sound judgment. She was able to read a room on every occasion.”\n\nMrs. Nesmith was proud of her professional accomplishments, but also of the life she and Jeff built together. She always said that the greatest gift she gave her children was choosing the right father for them. Mrs. Nesmith loved to travel, visiting Tanzania in the early 1960s with Crossroads Africa. She and Jeff continued to travel, climbing Machu Pichu in Peru as a young couple, and traveling as a family to Mexico, Greece, Vietnam, Cambodia, and most recently France, a few months before Covid locked down travel.\n\nShe also shared Carter’s dedication to service and went on several Habitat for Humanity home-building blitzes with the Carters. Mrs. Nesmith also enjoyed the time she volunteered at the Old Presbyterian Meeting House, working to establish a bag lunch program for homeless residents of Alexandria. When she called all of the other Alexandria churches and told them that OPMH was going to start a bag lunch program, the other churches told her they didn’t think there was sufficient demand for that. So, Mrs. Nesmith and a few friends made the lunches, and when they ran out of meals the first week, she called the other churches back with her evidence of the need. With her push, the other Alexandria churches stepped up. Mrs. Nesmith also worked to secure the funding and political support to open Carpenter’s Shelter, which serves the unhoused in Alexandria.\n\nLater in life, Mrs. Nesmith earned a Master of Arts degree in Liberal Studies in 2000 from Georgetown University. She also volunteered to help teach children in City of Alexandria Public Schools to read. In her final years, she became concerned about the disparity that African American mothers faced in health care outcomes. When she was no longer in a position to give her time, she donated to Mamatoto Village, which helps mothers and their babies in Ward 7 of the District of Columbia.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Susannah Achsah Nesmith (Charles Rabin), of Miami, FL; her son, Hollis Jefferson Nesmith, III, (Tara Ronzetti), of Arlington, VA; her grandchildren, Siena Kaya Nesmith and Dominic Nesmith; and her cherished niece, Debbie Middleton. Arrangements are being handled by Everly-Wheatley Funeral Home in Alexandria. The family is holding a private service. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to Mamatoto Village, the Carter Center or the Nuclear Threat Initiative.\n\nPublished by The Washington Post on Mar. 12, 2024.\n\nWade F. Gregory\n\nWade F. Gregory died peacefully on November 7, 2023, at Goodwin House Alexandria. Born in Weatherly, PA on June 30, 1924, Wade grew up on the family farm. He graduated from Penn State University receiving undergraduate and masters’ degrees in agricultural economics, followed by all but dissertation from the University of Chicago. The greater part of Wade’s professional career focused on international development, working with the Economic Research Service (USDA), World Bank, Organization of American States, Harvard Institute of International Development and Pragma Corp, to name a few. This work provided the opportunity to live and travel extensively throughout the world, visiting remote areas and sampling local fare. A member of the University of Chicago team setting up an economic research center in Santiago, Chile, Wade and his family lived there for three years. They also lived in Bogota, Colombia, while Wade worked on an AID contract with the Ministry of Agriculture. After retiring from USDA, Wade and his wife lived in Nairobi, Kenya, working with the Harvard Institute of International Development.\n\nWade was predeceased by his wife and life partner of over 73 years Ann B. Gregory, on July 26, 2023. Their courtship began while they attended Penn State. They moved to Arlington, VA in 1961, and were active in their community, church, and local and national politics. Wade was particularly engaged in expanding Arlington County’s Sister Cities program. Wade and Ann were avid and adventurous travelers visiting many domestic and international “off the beaten track” destinations.\n\nWade is survived by his son Gregory (Becky), and daughters Charlotte and Molly; five grandchildren; and five great grandchildren. Wade will be remembered for his loving, kind, and compassionate nature, his rich green thumb, and his wonderful sense of humor. He loved gardening, prolifically growing flowers and vegetables that he shared generously with family, friends and neighbors. His ability to insert one-liners with perfect timing was impeccable and very endearing, defusing and diverting awkward situations masterfully. He was truly a prince of a guy and a wonderful human being.\n\nMemorial service information for Ann and Wade Gregory are being finalized and will be provided once available. In lieu of flowers, kindly make donation to The Parkinson’s Foundation.\n\nPublished by The Washington Post on Mar. 10, 2024.\n\nElmer Melvin “Mel” Cook\n\nElmer Melvin “Mel” Cook (CW-4 U.S. Army Retired) passed away peacefully in his sleep on Leap Day, February 29, 2024, at home in Alexandria, VA, with his wife Bette, well-known in USAID, and son Joe by his side. He succumbed, at age 97, to congestive heart failure.\n\nBorn on October 7, 1926, in Delavan, IL, Mel was a descendant of military men who fought in every war this country has been engaged. Mel continued the legacy and served 32 years in the U.S. Army through three wars – World War II, Korea, and Viet Nam – entering the military as a Private in 1945 and retiring in 1980 as a Chief Warrant Officer W-4. Among the many medals and awards he received during his military career were the Distinguished Flying Cross, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, Meritorious Service, Air Medals, Army Commendation, and Purple Heart. The capstone of Mel’s career was induction into the Army Aviation Hall of Fame where he was cited as “the epitome of the finest traits and capabilities of our flying warrant officers.” In 2000, he was invited by President William J. Clinton to accompany his final Presidential delegation to visit Vietnam. In Mel’s mind, however, his most important honor was being the father of his son Joseph and a loving husband to Bette. Of their 67 years together, Bette remembers Mel’s romantic side and their special times like horseback riding on a Caribbean beach.\n\nSome highlights from Mel’s exceptional career include:\n\n• In 1945-46 during WWII in the Asian-Pacific Theater, he later found he was scheduled to participate in the invasion of Japan, which was negated by Japan’s surrender, thus ending the war, and saving millions of lives, including Mel’s!\n\n• He returned to the Army in 1950 after a five-year civilian stint to further his education. This time, Mel was assigned to Japan under different circumstances and enjoyed meeting the people and learning their culture.\n\n• Mel was accepted into the U.S. Military Attache service and assigned to the American Embassy in Tunisia in 1959-61. There, in his off-duty pursuit, he earned the first private pilot license – Tunisian Government License #4 (the first three licenses were honorary) – issued by the newly independent country. In 2019, he was invited to meet with staff, students, and spouses of the Attache course at Fort Meade, MD, to talk about the differences 60 years ago in the Attache field!\n\n• Mel was also granted an age waiver (he was five years over the 30-year age cap) to attend the first class of the re-opened U.S. Army Primary Helicopter School in 1961. As a graduate rotary-wing pilot, he trained at Fort Knox, KY, and deployed as the advance party to set up camp in Vietnam for the 114th Aviation Company, the first air mobility unit in combat. For a Master Paratrooper trained to jump from airplanes into combat, this was a welcomed way to be transported into battle.\n\n• Mel was quickly transferred from Vinh Long to the U.S. Army Support Command headquarters in Saigon to serve as Assistant Aviation Officer and personal pilot for Commanding General Joseph Stilwell, son of the famous WWII “Vinegar Joe.” Stilwell chose not only to command the air missions but also to be Mel’s aircraft door gunner. Holes in the aircraft after combat missions were not uncommon.\n\n• During two assignments (1965-68 and 1970-74) with the Aviation Warrant Officer Branch at the Pentagon, Mel participated in the rapid expansion of the Warrant Officer aviation program from 1,700 to 7,000 pilots, and the development of studies and plans that resulted in the creation of a new W-5 rank. In 2019, Mel was invited to meet with W-5 officers at a professional development session at the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command headquarters at Fort Belvoir and was pleased to learn the impact his work had on the Warrant Officer Corps was still being felt today.\n\n• While a dual-rated fixed wing pilot at the Priority Air Transport Division, Fort Belvoir, VA, Mel served as a personal pilot for Secretary of the Army, Clifford Alexander, the first Black Army secretary, who granted him a waiver of the 30-year retirement requirement for Regular Army personnel. While mandatory retirement was not waived at that time, it has become more common today.\n\n• After retirement, Mel served 18 years as the Director of Play at Army Navy Country Club, Arlington, VA, where he was privileged to become a friend and golf partner with a President. On September 11, 2001, while standing on the first tee, he witnessed an airplane fly low overhead and down the hill into the Pentagon. In shock and distress, Mel spent the day sending staff in golf carts down the hill to assist workers leaving the Pentagon for the clubhouse to call their families, rest, and recover.\n\n• Mel continued military camaraderie through professional associations such as the Army Aviation Association of America (AAAA), the National Museum of the U.S. Army (founding member), Friends of the National World War II Memorial in Washington DC, U.S. Army Warrant Officer Association, Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association, 114th Aviation Company “Knights of the Air”, American Legion (Auxiliary Post 39), and Army Navy Country Club.\n\nMel will be dearly missed by his family and friends. He is survived by his wife of 67 years, Bette Mayes Cook, and son Joseph Cook of Alexandria, VA; nephews Gale Johnson and wife Karen, Douglas Johnson, Dennis Johnson and wife Tina, Patrick Baillargeon, and Christopher Baillargeon; nieces Patricia Nelson Halper and husband Wayne, and Cynthia Oryall Gregg; and many loving grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He is preceded in death by his mother Josephine Van Buskirk and father Joseph Melvin Cook, sister JoAnn VanBuskirk Johnson and husband George Johnson, and nephews Robert Nelson and James Leroy Tauberschmidt.\n\nRelatives and friends will be received at Jefferson Funeral Chapel, 5755 Castlewellan Drive, Alexandria, VA 22315 on Friday, March 8, from 4:00 – 8:00 pm. Mel’s funeral service will be convened at Old Post Chapel with interment at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, VA, at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in his honor to a charitable organization of your choice or to the National Museum of the U.S. Army at Fort Belvoir, VA, or the American Red Cross (Service to the Armed Forces). All are invited to view and sign the family guestbook at www.jeffersonfuneralchapel.com.\n\nMelvin Raymond Chatman, Jr.\n\nMelvin Raymond Chatman, Jr., retired Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Agency for International Development, died December 2, 2023, in Aldie, Virginia, at the age of 83. Mr. Chatman was born September 28, 1940, in Chandler, Oklahoma. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Western Michigan University in 1962. After serving in the U.S. Army for six years, Mr. Chatman joined the Foreign Service.\n\nAt the beginning of his career with USAID in Vietnam, Mr. Chatman coordinated the Saigon evacuation transportation for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. In addition to his post in Vietnam, he also served in Bangladesh, El Salvador, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, and Washington.\n\nMr. Chatman retired in 1998 after almost 30 years with the Department of State. In retirement, he wrote a book detailing his family roots, pursued a master’s degree in creative writing, and spent years working with his wife to establish an urgent care clinic in South Riding, Virginia.\n\nMr. Chatman is survived by his wife of 40 years, Anita; a son, Farouk; two siblings, Whit and Susan; and his mother, Joan Taylor.\n\nhttps://www.adamsgreen.com/obituaries/Melvin-Raymond-Chatman?obId=30028291\n\nJames Elliott\n\nJames Albert Merten Elliott died January 12, 2024, at home in Arlington, VA, after a long battle with cancer. He was 79 years old. Jim was born in Seattle on September 9, 1944, and attended the Seattle public schools K-12. He completed an AB degree at Yale University in 1966 and graduated Summa Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa, with a double major (a special program) in political science and economics. He won a Marshall Scholarship to the London School of Economics, where he completed an MS degree in Economics in 1968.\n\nJim returned to Yale University for a Ph.D. in economics in 1972. His doctoral research was published that year by Yale University as International Comparisons of Social Welfare: A Factor Analytic Approach (282 pages). He then joined the University of Michigan’s Center for Research on Economic Development (CRED) and taught economics in Cameroon at the University of Yaounde in French, which he had to learn from scratch. From 1976 to 1980 Jim served as Assistant Professor of Economics at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. He joined the U.S. Agency for International Development in 1981 as a Foreign Service Officer and served in various capacities there for 28 years until his retirement in 2009. He served overseas for 4 years in Bamako, Mali, where he worked on budget reform and civil service reform, among other issues, as the USAID Mission Program Economist.\n\nIn Washington he served in the Bureaus for Africa, for Latin American & the Caribbean, and for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade. His work took him to USAID field missions throughout the world. His return to USAID/Washington coincided with the collapse of Communism in general and the USSR in particular. Jim had taken introductory Russian in summer school between his freshman and sophomore years in college (back in the 1960s) could still use it which, of course, made him the exception to the rule in AID and resulted in several short trips to Moscow.\n\nAs a USAID economist, Jim brought analytical excellence to the Agency’s understanding of the development challenges. His insights helped raise the quality of the debate on economic issues among USAID’s economic growth community. Many USAID economists sought Jim’s input to their research in progress, collaborations that he cherished. Notable among Jim’s many contributions to USAID’s work were his economic analyses of coca production and alternative crop development in South America, which were used and cited by the interagency, and his editorship (and frequently authorship) of EGAT (now IPI) Bureau’s EG Technical Briefings and Economist Working Papers on economic growth topics important to USAID programs. Jim at times sparked controversy when his thorough economic analyses pointed in directions at odds with conventional wisdom, but his gentle way of getting needed points into the conversation made USAID’s work better. Jim was a valued mentor and friend to the USAID economist community.\n\nJim is survived by his wife of 52 years, Robin Gates Elliott, cousins Kathryne Shaw, Barbra Mage, and Jack Morgan, and by a large number of former USAID friends and colleagues who will miss his constant good humor and brilliant mind. James’s inurnment was held at Acacia Memorial Park in Seattle, WA, on Saturday, February 17. In lieu of flowers, the family is requesting that donations be made to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.\n\nFrances Brigham Johnson\n\n1927 – 2024\n\nFrances Brigham Johnson, age 96, died peacefully at home in Alexandria, VA, on January 27, 2024, surrounded by her children. Throughout her life, she maintained her Christian faith and good spirits. She loved her family.\n\nFrances was born in Evanston, IL, daughter of Erwin Risley Brigham and Hortense Garthwaite Fish, fourth among five children. She was a Mayflower descendant. Her family moved to Williamsburg, VA, in the early 1930s, and then to Champagne, IL, during World War II, where she graduated from University High School in 1945.\n\nAfter two semesters at William & Mary College, she moved to Connecticut College for Women, graduating in 1949 with a BA degree in Government. After graduate work at Syracuse Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, she moved to Washington in 1950 to join the Economic Cooperation Administration, administering the Marshall Plan, where she met her future husband.\n\nHer work in the Marshall Plan and succeeding agencies over the next forty years included the Central Secretariat of the Administrator, Women in Development, Congressional Relations, and country desks for Turkey, Brazil, Afghanistan and Senegal, culminating as the first Private Sector Coordinator in the USAID Africa Bureau. Her work as the architect of the “Turn-Around Strategy” that revamped the U.S. aid program in Brazil from 1963-1968 was key to being named “Woman of the Year for Career Professional Achievement in Foreign Affairs” in 1973,\n\nRaising a family of four children and helping citizens in developing countries prosper (“Food for All through Enterprise”) were only two of her missions. Active in her community, she helped start a successful pre-school for disadvantaged children in Alexandria in 1984, organized a state-wide conference on Pre-School Education for Disadvantaged Children held at the U. of Virginia in Charlottesville. She also served on the boards of the Urban League of Northern Virginia and Research for Better Schools, a 5-state national research laboratory.\n\nShe loved to ski, swim and play tennis, and traveled extensively, bicycling in Europe in 1948, traveling for five months in seven Asian countries in 1954-55, followed later by trips to Israel, China (twice), Russia, Turkey, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Senegal, Mauritania and South Africa.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 72 years, Gordon O.F. Johnson, three children, Gordon F.B. Johnson and Susan C.J. Gildersleeve, both of Alexandria, VA, and Brigham N. Johnson of Delray Beach, FL, nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. She was predeceased by her youngest son, Christian, who died at Stanford University in 1982.\n\nThere will be a memorial service at Immanuel Church-on-the-Hill in Alexandria, on Sat. February 24, at 12 noon. In lieu of flowers, gifts in her memory may be made to The Child & Family Network Centers, 3700 Wheeler Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22304.

Born in Concord November 21, 1926, to Caleb Henry Wheeler and Ruth Winifred (Robinson) Wheeler, Joe studied at Concord High School (1945), Bowdoin College (1948), the Graduate Institute of International Studies of Geneva and Harvard’s Littauer School (MA/MPA 1951). A distinguished career in international development included posts in Jordan, Pakistan, Kenya, Paris and Geneva. Returning to Concord after retirement, he was active in town affairs.\n\nJoe described boyhood on Thoreau Farm as idyllic. A brother’s $20 gift to attend a Quaker conference on World Federalism launched his international career at age 15. Becoming a World Federalist student leader, he organized national and international conferences to promote world governance and an end to war. Joe worked for the U.S. foreign aid program (USAID), Peace Corps, United Nations Environmental Program and Organization for Economic Development. He was USAID Mission Director to Jordan (1965-1967) and Pakistan (1969-1977) and USAID Assistant Administrator from 1980 to 1982.\n\nDeeply committed to environmental issues, he organized the 1992 Earth Summit. Joe introduced himself to his first wife, Jean (Huleatt) Wheeler, after their pictures appeared together in the Boston Globe as winners of Globe scholarships for international study. They married as students in Geneva. While Joe worked at the state department and Jean wrote her PhD thesis, they shared family responsibilities for five children. Abroad, they took the family on camping road trips throughout the Middle East. After losing Jean and son, Daniel, in a 1969 car accident, Joe married M. Verona (Farness) Wheeler, beginning a joyful 44-year marriage, living in Islamabad, Washington, Nairobi, Paris and Geneva. Between adventures, they hosted innumerable diplomatic and family gatherings.\n\nHis children and grandchildren will always remember visits to Paris and Kenya, fabulous holiday meals and intensely competitive family croquet games. Joe became blind in his eighties, yet found ways to manage his blindness with remarkable grace, always describing his quality of life as very good. He leaves five children, Juliet Wheeler and Rachel Wheeler of Concord, MA, Deborah (Wheeler) Burk of Annandale, VA, Caleb Henry Wheeler of St. Louis, MO and Margaret Jeanne Kane of Walnut Creek, CA; sons-in-law, Kenneth Turkington and John Myers; five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by his four brothers, both wives; son, Daniel Lincoln Wheeler; and stepdaughter Marilee Kane.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held in May.

He was the oldest of four children born in Bronx, New York to William Ignatius Rodier Jr and Martha Marie Stoelting.\n\nAfter rowing for the New York Athletic club during high school, Bill entered Virginia Military Institute where he ran track and with his usual discipline running became part of his life. At VMI he earned a BS in Chemistry followed by an MA in Psychology from Hollins University and a Ph.D in Psychology from The University of Virginia.\n\nThe following two years he served in the Viet Nam War. Promoted from First Lieutenant to Captain, he commanded a civil affairs platoon of ten specialists and several senior enlisted men. He was awarded the Bronze Star.\n\nReturning to Charlottesville, Virginia Bill completed a variety of ‘Post Docs’ built around the study of endocrinology and psychology. Subsequently, he spent a year contracting with USAID in seven countries around the developing world, researching the acceptability of a new supplement for children, pregnant and lactating mothers.\n\nTaking stock of his experiences and interests, Bill then joined the CIA as an analyst in what was the Political Psychology Division in the Directorate of Intelligence. In the early 1980’s he was asked to lead the Directorate’s Insurgency analysis which he did for some years. Another career turn came when he joined the Directorate of Operations where he served throughout Africa and the Middle East. Unsurprisingly he was one of the first to go into Afghanistan after 9/11.\n\nAlways retaining a love for the Army, he accepted an appointment to The Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania as Senior Intelligence Representative from 1995-1998. As a member of The Department of National Security and Strategy he helped integrate intelligence issues into the curriculum. The Commandant of The Army War College awarded him A Superior Civilian Service Award for exceptionally meritorious service after Bill’s efforts helped prove instrumental for the College being recognized as the Army’s center for strategic thought.\n\nBill completed his professional career when requested to serve as the De Serio Chair of Strategic Intelligence for the academic year 2011 at the Army War College. Bill viewed the Army War College as another great institution much like Virginia Military Institute in its dedication to disciplined learning and thinking.\n\nBill will be missed greatly by his wife, Karen Walborn, his siblings, other family members and friends. He leaves us with his dry sense of humor, many kindnesses, and a deep commitment to patriotism. Services will be held at a later date.\n\nPublished by The Washington Post from Feb. 16 to Feb. 17, 2024.\n\nPaul Christian Tuebner\n\nPaul Christian Tuebner passed away on November 16, 2022, surrounded by friends and family at Physicians Regional hospital in Naples, Florida.\n\nBorn on April 6, 1950, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Alice Atchison Tuebner and Harry Tuebner, the family moved to Tokyo, Japan, shortly after his birth. Military orders then took the family to Thailand and Spain before they ultimately settled down in Orange Park, Florida, where Paul attended high school and his beloved University of Florida. After college, Paul joined the Peace Corps and moved to Costa Rica to serve as an Agriculture Volunteer. It was there where he met Annette, a fellow Peace Corps Volunteer who would end up being his wife for 44 years. After serving in the Peace Corps, Paul went on to get two Master’s degrees from Ohio University.\n\nPaul spent 35 years as a Foreign Service Officer with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). With his wife and two sons, he lived an exciting and varied life, which took him and his family to Botswana, Panama, Guatemala, Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, Honduras and Haiti. He loved going on safari in Africa, deep sea fishing in Central America and lounging on the beach in the Caribbean. Passionate for weekend barbeques, Paul was famous for his smoked ribs and steaks cooked to perfection. As an impassioned football fan, Paul enjoyed watching his Gators on Saturdays and the Commanders on Sundays. Following their exciting Foreign Service life, Paul and Annette retired to a beautiful community in Naples, Florida. He was a great friend to so many people all over the world and will be missed by everyone that knew him.\n\nPaul is survived by his wife Annette, sons Robert and Nathan, Daughter-in-Law Anna and two Grandchildren Clara and Eric, as well as his Brothers Kenneth, Peter, David and their families. He will be missed dearly.\n\nManuel Carl Zenick\n\nManuel “Mick” Zenick, a longtime resident of the Washington area, died at age 97 from complications of a fall. Born in Hudson, New York of immigrant parents from Czarist Russia, Mick was educated in public schools in Hudson and Brooklyn, NY. He received a BS from Baruch College at City University in New York. Mick interrupted his college studies at 17 to join the Navy during WWII and served at various domestic bases at Guantanamo Bay before his final assignment as the sole medic aboard the USS ATR5, a seagoing tugboat. Following the war, he resumed his college education which included a summer program in Europe to study the Marshall Plan. Mick later completed studies at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nPassing the Junior Professional examination was the beginning of Mick’s challenging and interesting overseas assignments. He first started in the US State Department as an economist before transferring to the US Foreign Aid Program. His first overseas assignment was in Paris where he served on the US Delegation to NATO and OEEC. Returning to the US in 1963, he received a Ford Foundation Fellowship to study economics under Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago. Mick then accepted an offer from the World Bank working primarily with the Caribbean and Colombia. In 1969 he was selected to open the first Resident Bank Mission in Kabul, Afghanistan. Under the King, Afghanistan at the time was a peaceful, but extremely poor, country with a government eager to accept developmental assistance from the World Bank and other international agencies. Having a Resident Mission resulted in the country’s receipt of critical economic assistance. Once back in Washington, Mick realized how much he missed hands-on work in developing countries. Inspired by the stories of his wife Linda’s Peace Corps service as a nurse midwife volunteer in Malaysia, Mick sought employment with the Peace Corps. For five years, he served as Country Director in Thailand and Guatemala. He took great pride in supporting and assisting dedicated volunteers in health, education, and agricultural projects. Mick returned to the World Bank headquarters in 1979 where he served as Chief of the Korea Division. He was delighted with his last assignment as Chief Loan Officer in the World Bank Mission in Indonesia until his retirement in 1988.\n\nIn his long retirement, he visited “paths less traveled” including Tibet, Easter Island, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu, and PNG. Besides travel, he designed and built a vacation home in Berkeley Springs, WVA; answered the comment line in the Clinton White House; taught a course on the 1920s at American University’s Institute of Learning in Retirement; and actively participated in the Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe Societies. He loved 1920s big band jazz, card playing, the theater, dim sum, and political banter. Mick treasured the many friendships from his overseas posts and keeping in touch with people he met in his travels. A few months before his death, he self-published a memoir and some poetry. Mick leaves behind his wife of 55 years Linda, their daughters Emily (Tom), Jenny (Eddie), and their children Benjamin and Henry Bergeron and Miles and Cora Wexler. He also leaves children from his first marriage Pamela Zenick, Jeffrey Zenick, Melanie Lynch (Tom), Andrew Zenick, four grandchildren – Jeremy, Sara, Mollie and Nadia – and numerous friends and neighbors who enriched his life. A celebration of life for family and friends will be held in March; an interment at Arlington National Cemetery will take place next year. Donations in his memory can be made to Doctors Without Borders or Heifer International.\n\nPublished by The Washington Post on Feb. 13, 2024.\n\nFrancis Redmond “Tony” Smoot\n\nFrancis Redmond Smoot, a sixth generation Washingtonian, passed away on January 13, 2024.

Kuhn\n\nErnest “Ernie” Clarence Kuhn passed away peacefully after a long illness on December 29, 2023, in Washington, DC surrounded by immediate and extended family members. He was 83 years old.\n\nThough born and raised in Newark, Ohio, a place he returned to regularly throughout his life, Ernie was an avid traveler at heart who immersed himself in the history, cultures and languages of Southeast Asia and the Middle East over decades of devoted international public service and love of history.\n\nHe served as a tour director on excursions to Asia, Europe and the Middle East during his undergraduate studies. Upon graduating from Ohio State University with a BA in history, he joined the Peace Corps as a Volunteer to Thailand as part of Group VII from 1963-1965. He later served over 30 years as a Foreign Service Officer with the US Agency for International Development in Laos, the Philippines, Egypt, Indonesia, and finally in Washington, DC. An extensive interview with Ernie as part of the Oral History Project covers his USAID career.\n\nWhile serving in Laos he met his beloved wife, Phaythoune neé Sengchanh, who was by his side throughout his life and at the end. They were married in Sam Thong in 1969.\n\nHe was an adventurous traveler, avid photographer, bird watcher and fisherman. He freely provided photographs for a guidebook to Egypt, supported eagle conservationists in the Philippines, hosted a team of National Geographic wildlife experts for two weeks at his home, and competed in deep sea fishing competitions. He took his family on rugged weeks-long trips to discover and explore the countries they lived in including the terraced rice fields of Mindanao, the Sahara Desert in western Egypt, the Sinai, and Hindu and Buddhist temples on the islands of Java and Sumatra. He taught his daughters how to develop film in the dark room he built and supported their interests as budding photographers. He also greatly loved returning to Ohio during summer home leaves and spending time in the family cabin that his parents built with him and his brother when he was a teenager.\n\nHe had a passionate and deep interest in the history and culture of the places he lived—but most particularly Laos whose language, culture and history he loved and studied throughout his life. In recognition of his services to Laos, Ernie received the Order of the Million Elephants and the White Parasol from King Savang Vatthana in 1968, the kingdom’s highest knighthood order.\n\nHe provided authors and television productions not only his time but also photographs and film recordings about Laos. The ‎Ernest and Phaythoune Kuhn Image Collection—a curated collection of photographs of Laos and Thailand during the 1960s-1970s—is available online at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries.\n\nHe is survived by his beloved wife Phaythoune Kuhn, daughters Christine (Jonathan) Kuhn-Patrick, and Kimberly (Brian Kaplan) Kuhn, grandchildren Imogen Kuhn-Patrick and Quincy Kaplan, sister-in-law Emily (Chin) Kuhn and nieces Bailey and Taylor Kuhn. Ernie was preceded in death by his parents, Joseph and Hallene (Fulke) Kuhn, and his brother, James Kuhn.\n\nErnie was passionately engaged in life, touching many lives across the globe. He will be deeply missed by family and friends. A memorial will be held on February 11 in Washington, DC.

Born on March 21, 1944, in Vicksburg Mississippi to his parents Ellsworth M. Amundson and Mildred Chisholm. Butch lived a full, vibrant life of adventure with his dearly beloved wife Wanida. His spirit, charm, and sense of humor left an indelible mark in the hearts of all those he encountered in life.\n\nButch started his life in Vicksburg where he was born, then travelled with his parents due to his father’s Army assignments to Park Forest Illinois, Fayetteville North Carolina, then New Port News Virginia where he graduated high school from St. Stevens and went to college at Virginia Tech where he majored in agriculture. Upon graduation he joined the Peace Corps because he wanted to see the world and help those who were less fortunate. He accepted an assignment to Nepal where he gained an appreciation for humanity, foreign worlds and which made him realize the person who he wanted to become. ‘I felt my contribution to the Nepalis had been so small compared to what they had given to me’. After his assignment he returned to Washington D.C. where he decided to enroll and was accepted to Georgetown University’s International Affairs graduate program. Within only a few days he met Wanida ‘the most beautiful girl in the world’ who was enrolled in the linguistics program on a Fullbright Scholarship and who he fell in love with immediately.\n\nAt the time the Vietnam war was heating up. Butch decided to cut his Master’s program short and take the opportunity to work as a civilian through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Vietnam. After months of courting and moving into an apartment together in Rosslyn he and Wanida decided they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. They were married at the Thai Embassy in D.C. and St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in Arlington Virginia, both attended by his Peace Corps friends and his cousin Mary Alyce who represented the Amundson family for their nuptials. As Butch headed over to Vietnam to support refugees Wanida would finish her degree at Georgetown and travelled back to Bangkok to stay with her parents and to be close to Butch so they could visit each other occasionally. Sometime later their son Eric was conceived and born in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nFrom there he started his career as a Foreign Service Officer with posts in Tunisia, Yemen, Djibouti, Cameroon and Morocco. Each assignment was a cultural adventure for Butch, Wanida and Eric who would meet so many lifelong friends along the way that we are still in contact with today. Besides exploring the assigned countries they would return to visit his parents and relatives in Sacramento and her parents and relatives in Thailand. Eventually they bought their first home in McLean Virginia where Eric went to elementary school through his sophomore year. Butch and Wanida received their next assignment to West Africa and Eric went to boarding school in Switzerland. As Eric graduated and went on to College at James Madison University, Butch and Wanida’s last assignment was in Morroco, a beautiful country that was the perfect dovetail for his career. Butch retired in his early fifties from USAID then both he and Wanida decided to buy a second home in Lake Tahoe Nevada to be closer to relatives and enjoy everything Tahoe had to offer including Butch’s love for skiing. Butch’s other passions were tennis, scuba diving and astronomy all of which he picked up during their assignments and travels overseas.\n\nButch and Wanida eventually decided to move back to their home in Virginia. They celebrated Eric and Fay’s wedding and joyously welcomed their beloved Grandchildren Ethan and Clara into the world. They enjoyed spending time with Fay’s parents and relatives. Butch found a new passion in doing extensive Amundson family genealogy research that included detailed ties to relatives in Wisconsin and Norway culminating in two reunions in both locations. Over the years Butch, Wanida, Eric and Fay would occasionally travel together passing down the love of culture, food and history to Ethan and Clara. Butch’s favorite trip of all time was to southern France to celebrate his and Wanida’s 50th anniversary along with Eric and family.\n\nEventually the love of his life Wanida passed away January 19th 2023. Butch returned to her loving arms 11 months later on December 19th. Their love and legacy will continue to live on forever.\n\nButch is survived by his son Eric, his daughter in law Fay, his grandchildren Ethan and Clara, and his cousins Carol Graeber, Cecil Roumage, Doug Gayner, Suzanne Werner, Susie Wheeler, Jim Amundson, Clark Absher and their families.\n\nHe will be remembered as the good son he was to his parents, a loving and caring husband to Wanida, a fantastic father and father-in-law to Eric and Fay, an amazing Grandfather to Ethan and Clara, and a great friend and supporter to all whom he has touched in his life.\n\nSophia Helene Van Der Bijl\n\nJanuary 22, 1976 – January 21, 2024\n\nA quote from a MCC friend also called Sophia: “Sophia was the best: direct, funny, hardworking and very loving with her own particular flavor.”\n\nA graduate the Washington International School (International Baccalaureate), McGill University (Bachelor of arts, Political Science and Economics), the Paris Institute of Political Studies, Paris, France (Diploma in International Law), School of Advanced International Studies, Bologna, Italy (Master of arts, International Affairs).

If it was true he danced to the beat of a different drum, it was likely an African one.\n\nAnd the drums are surely beating now in an uplifting yet sad cadence that mourns the loss of a remarkable human being. Alexander Durham Newton died peacefully on the evening of Jan. 15, 2024, at his longtime family home, Bonar Hall. By his side as the final chapter of his extraordinary life’s journey came to a close was his first wife of 33 years, Betsy, and their intrepid-in-their-own-right progeny, Nicola and Simon. By his side in spirit was the myriad ranks of the Friends of Alex (FOA) that included everyone he touched in his personal and professional life — a life that spanned five continents and too many countries to count.\n\nBorn and raised in Madison, GA, 79 years ago, Alex had a heart for service from an early age, beginning with high school mission trips to Peru. He loved his hometown of Madison, but always claimed he chose Brown University for his undergraduate studies as it was the option farthest away. Still, he eventually made his way back to the south to study law at Duke University.\n\nWith a law degree under his belt, Alex headed to NYC and Wall Street to practice law and continue to feed his adventurous spirit. Sailing and kayaking and tennis and running were the primary sports that fulfilled him most of his life, though he happily dabbled in a variety of high-risk endeavors. These included mountaineering, hang-gliding, paragliding, scuba diving, bungee jumping, skiing, surfing, and child-rearing. He was never one to shy away from a chance to learn something new and have fun doing it.\n\nDespite the plethora of extracurricular activities, Alex was equally passionate about doing what he could to make a difference in the world. He traded in his suit and tie and fancy Wall Street lawyer job for a work shirt, dungarees, and a shovel, and spent 2 years in the remote Guatemalan countryside serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer. That stint set the stage for an eventual rewarding and successful career in humanitarian assistance with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nWest Africa was Alex’s first assignment as a newly minted Regional Legal Advisor. He spent two years in Mali and five years in the Ivory Coast and traveled regularly throughout the region as part of his job. A by-product of his extensive travels was his penchant for gathering in-depth travel information which he converted into well-regarded Lonely Planet travel guides for both West and Central Africa. He thus added travel writer to his growing list of accomplishments.\n\nSouth America was the next work destination. Alex spent the next 4 years based in Quito Ecuador but continued traveling for work throughout the region. This time he collected more than travel information on the side. While on assignment in Lima Peru, Alex happened to stop by the South American Explorers’ Club, an information network for travelers which was run by a woman named Betsy. Two and a half years later they were married. This time Alex added “spouse” to his list of accomplishments.\n\nNow the real adventure began. There was a 5-year tour in Bangladesh with frequent work visits to Nepal. And a daughter, Nicola, was another proud accomplishment to go on the list. Four years in Kazakhstan followed — this time as Democracy Office Chief. Alex succinctly described his charge as “to bring democracy to the former Soviet states” which, as with all things, he did his best. His list of accomplishments grew to include a son, Simon.\n\nAfter Alex was promoted to USAID Deputy Mission Director of Haiti, the family moved to the capital city Port-au-Prince. They lived there from 2000 to 2002 before returning once again to West Africa -first to Ghana with Alex serving as Deputy Director for three years and then four years in Mali as Mission Director. When that tour ended, Alex spent nearly two years in war-torn Afghanistan, with Betsy and the kids safely ensconced in Madison.\n\nHis “retirement” in 2012 lasted about five minutes. Alex then began a series of short-term contract assignments for USAID that took him back to Africa, and then to Indonesia, Egypt, Ukraine, and Timor Leste. In between assignments, he and Betsy managed the ongoing work on their Bonar Hall home, buildings and grounds, which seemed to keep expanding. Alex’s love of old houses led him to rescue endangered structures and move them to the property, inspiring a friend to refer to them as “Alex’s Architectural Petting Zoo.”\n\nAlex’s list of accomplishments is endless. His lifelong work of making a difference in the world carries on; reverberates still. He was a great friend, compassionate mentor, loving husband, adoring father, and devoted son. He will be missed and remembered by all the lucky FOAs here in this community — and the world over.\n\nPublished in the Morgan County Citizen, Madison, GA, Jan. 22, 2024\n\nPatricia S. Matheson\n\nPatricia Matheson peacefully passed away on Sunday, January 21, 2024, in Inova Fairfax Hospital at age 79 as a result of complications of her fight against breast cancer, a fight she had waged successfully for 17 years to lead a life that was as productive and fulfilling after her diagnosis as it had been before.\n\nPat was born March 18, 1944, in San Antonio, TX to Myron and Mae Schraud (Nee: Richards), younger sister to Cata and Susan.
