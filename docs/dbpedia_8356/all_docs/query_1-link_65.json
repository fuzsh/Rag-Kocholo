He danced professionally with BalletMet, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal, Staatstheater Wiesbaden, and Gärtnerplatztheater before transitioning into the role of choreographer. The success of his first work, commissioned by Gärtnerplatztheater in 2016, inspired him to pursue choreography full time. Returning to Columbus, his home town, has provided the ideal home for FluxFlow Dance Project and its sister-project, Flux + Flow Movement Center, where a community of devoted adult dancers has flourished, guided by the principles that inform Russell and husband and collaborator Filippo’s own approach to dance. Last year Russell was awarded the first Ann and Weston Hicks Choreography Fellowship at Jacob's Pillow and his most recent work \"Ursula\" was commissioned and produced by the Wexner Center for the Arts. Other recent work has been produced at the Columbus Museum of Art, the Riffe Center, and Columbus Dance Theater, among other venues, and in 2018 he was a recipient of the Greater Columbus Arts Council’s Columbus Dances Fellowship. His work challenges conventional ideas about dance, experimenting with narrative and telling familiar stories through unconventional perspectives. Russell begins the choreographic process with movement generated through the direct transposition of music to the body, then abstracts this foundational choreography, making use of components of musical composition, theater, poetry, and visual art. The result is movement that is a translation of emotion—that communicates feeling and “story” in a distinctive and wholly original way.\n\nSawyer Player\n\nSALT Apprentice\n\nSawyer’s spent her adolescence in the corners of dance studios watching her mom teach, and forcing her family members into duets in the living room.

On coming to North America at age 19, he discovered the exhilaration of many new dance forms. As a principal dancer, first with Royal Winnipeg Ballet and later, for most of his dancing career, with Pacific Northwest Ballet, he acquired his strong conviction that dancers are the heart and soul of a company. As such they, and artists in general, must live at the very center of the process, their dignity, psychological and creative growth and safety deemed just as essential as their technical accomplishments.\n\nDuring his years of performing in classical and contemporary works by choreographers from around the world, Olivier also discovered the thrill of making dances and how imaginative story-telling and movement exploration connect to caring about individuality and physicality. Creating dances fed his perennial curiosity. It became “my way to express myself and, during the process, to be able to learn more about the human condition, start dialogues, touch people and share ideas, reflecting on our times and our humanity.”\n\nWhile still dancing with PNB and developing his own choreographic approach, Olivier became convinced that only by starting his own company could he create the works he envisioned in an artist-centered sanctuary where kindness, empathy, and collaboration are built into the very DNA. The result is Whim W’Him, with its yearly Choreographic Shindig for which the dancers choose the choreographers; emphasis on new works; transparent and candid leadership; ethical practices and equitable pay; commitment to diversity and social justice; and dedication to uncovering and nurturing new voices.\n\nAWARDS\n\nCity of Seattle’s Mayor’s Arts Award, 2012\n\nPrincess Grace Choreographic Fellowship Award, 2011\n\nAnnual Dance Under the Stars Choreography Festival Grand prize Awards, 2010 & 2011\n\nDance Magazine 25 to watch, 2011\n\nArtist Trust/Washington State Arts Commission Fellowship Award, 2008\n\nCOLLABORATIONS\n\nBallet X, Philadelphia, PA\n\nCornish Dance Theater, Seattle, WA\n\nCanada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet\n\nCzech Republic’s Ballet of the National Theatre Brno\n\nGrand Rapids Ballet, Grand Rapids, MI\n\nNational Choreographers Initiative, Irvine, CA\n\nNew York Choreographic Institute, New York, NY\n\nNorthwest Dance Project, Portland, OR\n\nPacific Northwest Ballet, Seattle, WA\n\nPrix de Lausanne Gala, Tokyo, JAPAN\n\nSeattle Dance Project, Seattle, WA\n\nSFDanceworks, San Francisco, CA\n\nSpectrum Dance Theater, Seattle, WA\n\nWhite Bird’s 4×4 Ballet Project, Portland, OR\n\nOmar Román De Jesús\n\nOmar Román De Jesús (Bayamón, Puerto Rico) is a recipient of the 2020 Jacob's Pillow: The Ann & Weston Hicks Choreography Fellowship.
