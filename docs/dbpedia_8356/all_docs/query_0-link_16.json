        "text": "M arcus f 2 R EMEMBER S TANFORD Krupp, ’34, MD ’39, and Donna Goodheart Krupp, ’42, have been married for 48 years. Their association with <strong>Stanford</strong> has lasted even longer: 75 years. Although they grew up in very different worlds—Marc in the small copper mining <strong>to</strong>wn of Miami, Arizona, and Donna in San Francisco —their early experiences instilled in each a profound appreciation for education and a desire <strong>to</strong> give back <strong>to</strong> <strong>Stanford</strong>, where they feel they gained so much. Creating a Legacy ❖ C H A R I T A B L E E S T A T E P L A N N I N G & T A X T I P S S U M M E R 2 0 0 6 STANFORD SCRAPBOOK Students enjoying a coffee break in front of the Cellar at the Old Union in 1960. The old post office can be seen in the background. White Plaza has since replaced the thoroughfare at left. HONORING THE PAST WITH A GIFT FOR THE FUTURE MARC BEGAN his freshman year at <strong>Stanford</strong> in the fall of 1930, in the early days of the Great Depression. The s<strong>to</strong>ck market had crashed, his parents could no longer afford tuition, and the money he had saved from working during summers was lost when the banks failed. It was a time of hardship for many families. <strong>Stanford</strong>’s response <strong>to</strong> the Depression—and the difficulties faced by its students—still <strong>to</strong>uches him deeply <strong>to</strong>day."
