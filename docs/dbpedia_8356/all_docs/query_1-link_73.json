Nwaobi has combined her study of biology with her passion for serving others by organizing and completing a medical mission trip to Nigeria in the summer of 2005. She visited clinics, hospitals, and universities throughout the country and helped build a water system for a village there. She is planning a similar service trip to India for the summer of 2007. In the meantime, she will draw on her minor in Spanish in her travels with Rhodes's Tex-Mex Border Ministry to build two new homes in Reynosa, Mexico over spring break. Nwaobi hopes to make a difference -- whether in a local hospital or a third world country -- by one day obtaining an M.D.-Ph.D. More.\n\nAdvocates in ActionProject Pericles at Macalester College collaborated with the Minnesota Participation Project (MPP) to educate members of the St. Paul community about precinct caucuses and to train them to use the caucuses to bring about community solutions to public problems. Macalester and MPP held nonpartisan workshops on March 2 in which participants learned how they could be voices for change in areas such as immigration, housing, and access to health care. Precinct caucus trainings occurred throughout Minnesota in English and Somali. For more information on these educational exercises in advocacy and participatory democracy, contact Macalester Project Pericles Co-Program Director Karin Trail-Johnson, Assistant Dean of Students, at [email protected].

He addressed a crowd of 2500 people on the direction the United States should take in an increasingly interdependent world. Clinton said the country was confronted with the same two great questions it faced 100 years ago under President Theodore Roosevelt: How can we undergo economic change while remaining a decent place to live? and What role should we play in the world? \"You need to have an opinion on these things,\" Clinton told the students in the audience. \"You need to know where you think America is, and where you want it to go. And what you think should be done. What the role of government is, and what you can do as a private citizen.\" During the Question and Answer period that followed Clinton's talk, Pace University President David A. Caputo asked President Clinton about his views on student citizenship, citing Pace's commitment to educating for citizenship through Project Pericles and the University's core curriculum. To read the transcript of President Clinton's speech, click here.\n\n\"Redeeming America's Promise: Preaching and Practicing Democracy Abroad\" was the theme of Macalester College's twenty-fifth annual G. Theodore Mitau Endowed Lecture on February 22. The lecture was given by Dr. Anne-Marie Slaughter, the Bert G. Kerstetter University Professor of Politics and International Affairs and Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.\n\nThe themes of genocide prevention and remembrance have emerged from Pace University's Political Action for Human Rights series. In addition to its work to combat the ongoing genocide in Darfur, Project Pericles at Pace has sponsored events on the Armenian and Rwandan genocides. The 25 year old human rights activist Yvette Rugasaguhunga gave a moving account of her experience as a survivor of the atrocities in Rwanda, on March 6. Margot Dilmaghani will discuss women's use of poetry and the piano in responding to genocide as part of the March 27 event \"Genocide and the Artist's Response: Tracing the Women's Perspective.\"\n\nClassroom: The activist and advocate for nonviolent social change Dr. George Lakey has been selected as Swarthmore College's Eugene M. Lang Visiting Professor for Issues of Social Change in 2006-2007. Lakey, the founder and executive director of Training for Change, has published extensively for activist and academic communities. He has worked with civil rights leaders in the United States, as well as internationally. His teaching will include a new course, \"Peace Studies and Action,\" which he is developing with Lee Smithey, assistant professor of sociology and coordinator of Swarthmore's Peace and Conflict Studies Program. Regarding coursework with Dr. Herbert Kohl, the 2005-2006 Eugene M. Lang Visiting Professor for Issues of Social Change, a Swarthmore student said: \"[These classes are] a release from feeling academically irrelevant while remaining intellectually challenging. [They offer] a wealth of experience, which is impossible to gain from only reading books.\" More.\n\nThis semester, seventeen Occidental College seniors majoring in Diplomacy and World Affairs have taken advantage of a new opportunity to connect their research interests with the local community through internships at non-profit organizations in Los Angeles. Students keep observational journals and, at the end of the semester, present analytical papers to the campus community.

Students in the class presented a First Amendment education program, including a skit about the five freedoms, to fifth grade students. Dr. Padgett will present his teaching ideas as part of a Best Teaching Practices panel at the AEJMC national conference in San Francisco in August. For more information, email him at [email protected].\n\nThe 2006 International Conference on Civic Education featured two papers by Dr. Melissa Comber, Allegheny College visiting assistant professor in political science and research fellow at the college's Center for Political Participation. In addition to the papers \"Equalizing Political Participation Abilities: Civic Education and Cognitive Civic Skills\" and \"Group Discussion Skills and Civic Education Content,\" Dr. Comber has published a fact sheet on civic education with the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE).\n\nCommunity: A project to stimulate thoughtful, passionate, and civil discussion about hot topics has been created by the Hendrix College Project Pericles Advisory Committee. The weekly lunch discussion series, called the Hendrix Forum, begins on March 23 with a conversation between members of the campus community and the broader local community on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. Dr. Alex Vernon, an English professor at Hendrix who is an award-winning author of numerous books on war, will facilitate the meeting. Committee members will select future topics shortly before the weekly forums in order to keep the discussions fresh and fluid. For more information, email Hendrix Project Pericles Program Director Dr. Jay Barth at [email protected].\n\nThe website One World TV is featuring \"A Measure of Our Humanity,\" one of four documentaries produced by Elon University's Periclean Scholars. Produced and directed by Katrina Taylor '05, \"A Measure of Our Humanity\" examines the problem of HIV/AIDS in Namibia. The other Periclean Scholars-produced documentaries will also be featured on the website.\n\nHosted by the Common Ground Collective, whose motto is \"Solidarity Not Charity,\" twenty Swarthmore College students spent spring break doing hurricane relief work in New Orleans. Their trip was part of Swarthmore's second alternative break project working with Common Ground, an organization that works directly with residents and community-based organizations in and around the lower 9th Ward of New Orleans.\n\nTwenty-one students and six staff members from Macalester College traveled to Biloxi, Mississippi in January and worked with the organization Presbyterian Disaster Assistance to help with Hurricane Katrina clean-up, recovery, and rebuilding efforts. Students and staff were part of small-learning groups, which facilitated learning and reflection on topics related to the relief efforts. Several students also pursued independent study credit and worked with professors to design topics around the effect of disaster fatigue and the ethics of service in areas of natural disaster. The group also spent a day in New Orleans meeting with alumni and learning more about the complex issues the city faces in rebuilding. Visit the trip website to view the team's slideshow, read student reflections, and find resources about working in the area.\n\nInnovative InitiativesAs a way of inspiring students to build lives of political engagement, Widener University has created \"Project Pericles Presents Perspectives on Public Service,\" a program that brings individuals with professional experience in civic life to campus. The series has included presentations by Widener alumni representing public service work at the local, government, and state levels, as well as visits by FBI Special Agent Jerri Williams and Jolene Smith, the co-founder of Free the Slaves, a non-profit organization dedicated to eradicating modern slavery around the world.

A part of the Amos B. Hostetter Distance Learning Program, the course provides an engaging, interactive learning format for students so they may experience live discussions via television screens in three locations.
