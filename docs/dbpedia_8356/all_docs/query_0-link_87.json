        "text": "STANFORD â€” Bogdan Bliznyuk scored 23 points to help Eastern Washington, which hit 11 3-pointers, beat Stanford 67-61 on Tuesday night and get its first win against a Pac-12 team in nearly 15 years.\n\nThe Eagles (1-1) snapped a 21-game losing streak against Pac-12 schools, dating to a 62-58 win over Washington on Dec. 14, 2002. Coach Shantay Legans spent three seasons as a player at Stanford's rival Cal but never got a victory on the Cardinal's floor.\n\nEastern Washington was down 9-2 early but never trailed over the game's final 29 minutes, despite missing six free throws down the stretch.\n\nReid Travis scored 20 points to lead the Cardinal (2-1), which started three freshmen and shot 34 percent from the field, including 2 for 16 on 3-pointers.\n\nStanford played without three injured players, starting guard Dorian Pickens and reserves Marcus Sheffield and Kodye Pugh.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nEastern Washington: This was the second of 10 straight games away from home for the Eagles, who debuted with a home victory over NAIA foe Walla Walla but won't play again in Cheney, Washington, until Dec. 17 against Cal State Northridge.\n\nStanford: The schedule gets much tougher for the Cardinal real soon. Stanford hosts No. 9 North Carolina on Monday, then faces No. 8 Florida three days later in the opening round of the PK80 Invitational at Portland, Oregon. The Cardinal will take on No. 4 Kansas in Sacramento on Dec. 21.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nEastern Washington plays Friday at UNLV.\n\nStanford plays Friday against Northeastern, the fourth of a five-game stretch over 11 days to open the season."
