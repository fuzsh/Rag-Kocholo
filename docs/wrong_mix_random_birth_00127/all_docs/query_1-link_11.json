        "text": "The One Where They Say Goodbye. After nearly 10 years, it‚Äôs all laced up. A journey that started on the retail floor and ended in sports marketing. It‚Äôs been a run. As I reflect back on my time, I recall how ASICS founder, Onitsuka-san, started the company to give back, uplift and take care of the community. With innovation at the heart. This community also included those whom worked for the business. In his novel ‚ÄúSound mind, Sound body, My Story‚Äù, Ontisuka-san states ‚ÄúPeople make the company‚Äù. And still, to this day, people really do. I owe my journey to those around me. It‚Äôs your support, but moreso the example you set by being you, that inspire me as I step into this next chapter. And gosh I am going to miss the good people here. To the store family, local and global teams, athletes and partners, thank you. With all the heart words and a limited highlight video (of projects we‚Äôve worked on together) can never explicitly capture. I‚Äôm truly blessed to now call some of you friends ü•π and forever cheering you on üôå Disclosure and acknowledgement: this video has been repurposed with original creative by Shevin Dissanayake for the ASICS House of Tennis wrap reel in 2023. Other included images are a mix of mine and the amazing content creators, photographers, videographers who were on these projects inclusive of Mackenzie Sweetnam, Warren Abela and Benjamin Tosi."
