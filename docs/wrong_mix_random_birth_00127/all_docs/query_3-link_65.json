        "text": "Former doubles world No 1 and singles world No 4 Stosur, who has one singles and four doubles grand slam titles in her cabinet, announced her retirement from the singles game in January.\n\nBut the 37-year-old appears to be mulling a final run in the doubles after finding success with Zhang in recent years.\n\nTheir 2019 win was her first women’s doubles title since the 2006 French Open, and the pair won back-to-back Opens at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati and the US Open, extending their unbeaten run to 11 matches.\n\n“Last year’s doubles titles was a bit of a surprise. After we won the Australian Open doubles title, we had high expectations for doubles,” said Zhang, who called the pair “friends forever” after their against-the-odds grand slam win.\n\n“We wanted to win more grand slam titles – we wanted to be the world No 1 doubles pair. But since 2019, I had to prepare for the [Tokyo 2020] Summer Olympics, and there was a pandemic so the Olympics was delayed for one year, and we weren’t able to play together for a very long time.\n\n“Because of Sam’s age, she actually wanted to put an end to her career after the Olympics, so when we won 11 straight matches at the Cincinnati and US Open titles, it was a complete surprise for us.\n\n“It depends on how long Sam will continue her career. We have a very good relationship, but Sam now has a kid and has to take care of her family, and Australia has very strict rules for travelling because of the pandemic.\n\n“So she is still considering the possibility of retiring, but after we played [at the end of last year], she’s thinking to play for another year and only playing in doubles.”\n\nTianjin native Zhang, who beat Ukraine’s Dayana Yastremska to win Lyon last week, could not continue her singles form at Indian Wells this week, losing to Daria Saville.\n\nZhang last played doubles alongside Ena Shibahara of Japan at the Qatar Open in February, losing to Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula of the US in the quarter-final. She is considered one of the mainland’s most accomplished tennis players having also won three WTA titles, and three Asian Games medals.\n\nZhang’s win against Yastremska – her first WTA title outside China – was marred with off-court controversy.\n\nThe 21-year-old Yastremska said she was in hiding with her sister before they fled from missile strikes in their homeland a week before entering the event as a wild card.\n\n“Experience tells me as long as you still have goals and pursuits, it’s never too late. No matter how big or far away your dreams seem, don’t be afraid of the turbulence and negative voices on the way. Goddesses, please remember to go directly to towards your dreams and goals. My heart is also still surging!” Zhang wrote in Chinese in an Instagram post afterwards."
