        "text": "***image1***\n\nThe Family Circle Cupâ€™s top-seeded players are certainly in it to win it when they attack the ball on the courts. But when it comes to supporting worthy causes, they are all on the same team.\n\n\"Anytime I can help out, I like to do that,\" said World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki during the \"All Access Media Hour\" held at the Family Circle Tennis Center on Monday. \"â€¦I donâ€™t have my own specific charity at the moment, but I like to help, especially the disabled and also kids with cancer.\"\n\nWozniacki has also assisted with efforts to support earthquake relief in Japan and Haiti, as well as for flooding in Australia. Russian player Alisa Kleybanova, seeded at No. 8 in the Family Circle Cup, puts her charitable focus on homeless children in her native country. Whenever she has an opportunity, Kleybanova donates money, clothing, toys, books and other items to kids in need.\n\n\"I think that itâ€™s important, especially in Russia,\" she said. \"â€¦There is not much money and not (a lot of) sponsoring thereâ€¦The kids are always important. This is their future. I think that everyone has to have a chance to do something in his life and to have opportunities.\"\n\n\"Iâ€™m always up for doing charity work and raising money for different things in order to help people who need it most,\" added Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, current No. 3 seed and 2007 FCC winner.\n\nJankovic serves as an ambassador for Unicef in Serbia and has also helped raise money for AIDS research.\n\n\"Tennis has given me a lot,\" she said. \"So itâ€™s nice to give back as well.\"\n\nFor Aussie Samantha Stosur, the 2010 Family Circle Cup champion, itâ€™s all about furry friendsâ€¦and helping people of all ages stay active and fit. She supports an animal shelter in Australia known as the Animal Welfare League and also serves as an ambassador to improve tennis courts in her country. Being a well-known, international player certainly helps elevate her causes.\n\n\"No doubt, the higher up you are, itâ€™s possible (to do) more,\" said Stosur.\n\nNadia Petrova of Russia, seeded at No. 7 in this yearâ€™s FCC, recently formed her own charitable foundation to help raise awareness of the sport of tennis and offer underprivileged children a chance to learn the game.\n\n\"We want to pay more attention to kids who are sick, and to kids who have no parents,\" said Petrova, who is also supporting other global causes, such as tsunami/earthquake relief in Japan. Like Stosur, Petrova has found that being an elite tennis player helps open doors.\n\n\"I think number one, itâ€™s just being a public figure,\" she said. \"Because a lot of people do follow us and are interested in everything. That way, I can get more people involved in my foundation and be able to raise more money and help more kids around the world.\"\n\nNo. 4 seed Marion Bartoli, a native of France who joined the pro circuit more than 10 years ago, also has a passion for helping kids.\n\n\"There are a lot of causes that are special to me,\" said Bartoli, who has provided assistance to charitable efforts to fight HIV and cancer. \"First, my dad is a doctor. I saw, all (throughout) my childhood, children sickâ€¦that was pretty much a daily (experience). Of course now as a professional athlete, Iâ€™m definitely focused on giving back. But I just donâ€™t want to be on one action. I really spread my action around and every time I can help people, I do it.\"\n\nYanina Wickmayer of Belgium, ranked No. 6 in the FCC tournament, likes to spend her free time volunteering in support of a charity that provides internet connections and computers to children who are hospitalized.\n\n\"Whenever I get home, I try to visit one of the hospitals,\" said the 21 year-old Wickmayer, who is enjoying her first Family Circle Cup in Charleston. \"â€¦I go and play some games with the kids and make them enjoy their stay a little moreâ€¦Being able to help people and help kids, and see them smile and see that theyâ€™re happy for at least some of the time during their stay, it makes it nice.\"\n\nIsrael native Shahar Peer, a No. 5 FCC seed, puts her support behind a project known as \"Variety: The Childrenâ€™s Charity.\" The effort has raised over $1.7 billion worldwide for programs dedicated to promoting and protecting the health and well-being of children around the globe. For Peer, getting an opportunity to assist kids in her home country who are handicapped or who suffer from mental disabilities is very worthwhile.\n\n\"To do it I think is very important,\" she said.\n\nOne Family Circle Cup player who is especially moved by the power of tennis and charity is WTA player Ayumi Morita, the only player from Japan in this yearâ€™s FCC main draw line-up. Her native country served as the beneficiary of a tsunami/earthquake relief effort at last monthâ€™s Sony Ericsson Open in Miami. Morita, along with several other WTA players, walked through the crowds in the stands on March 25 to collect donations from fans. Contributions from the Miami effort, and several others that took place on the same evening, helped bring in more than $300,000 for the cause.\n\n\"Tennis is a global sport and when a tragedy strikes, the entire tennis community comes together and responds,\" said Adam Barrett, Sony Ericsson Open Tournament Director.\n\nOn Monday, Family Circle Cup and its parent company, Meredith Corporation, announced a partnership with Subaru of Charleston and the American Red Cross to raise money for Japan relief efforts. For a $5 entry fee, fans will have an opportunity to guess the number of tennis balls inside a Subaru on site for a chance to win use of the vehicle for 90 days. Organizers hope the project nets some $50,000 in aid for Japan.\n\n\"The Family Circle Cup is a signature event for the Lowcountry, and Subaru of Charleston is excited to be involved,\" said Robert Crews, owner, Subaru of Charleston.\n\nAn auction at a private event for box seat ticket holders on April 4 will also be included in the initiative. Bidders had an opportunity to vie for two custom-made Dunlop rackets signed by top seeded players, as well as a private meet and greet with Caroline Wozniacki and a 30 minute private hitting session with Samantha Stosur and her coach during the tournament. In addition, the Family Circle Cup will donate $2 for every patron who attends the finals on Sunday, April 10. Fifty percent of the proceeds from the tournamentâ€™s annual charity auction with VIP guests will also be added to the tally.\n\n\"Weâ€™re very excited to include our fans in these fundraising programs because we know they feel just as passionately about this important cause as we do,\" said Bob Moran, general manager and FCC tournament director.\n\nAnd while World No. 53 Morita and two other WTA players spent time volunteering their tennis talents at a special \"Tennis in the City\" event for inner-city youth at Charlestonâ€™s Jack Adams Tennis Courts on Monday afternoon, the impact of the FCCâ€™s efforts for Japan did not go unnoticed.\n\n\"I appreciate that,\" said the soft spoken Morita, who hails from Ota City, Japan. \"Itâ€™s a tough situation in Japan, but things are getting better and betterâ€¦Iâ€™m so touched by the kindness of the whole world.\""
