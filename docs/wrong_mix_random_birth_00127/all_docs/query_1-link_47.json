        "text": "MIAMI: Eugenie Bouchard's poor run of form continued as the Canadian suffered a first-round exit at the hands of Australia's Ashleigh Barty at the Miami Open.\n\nBut for the 23-year-old Bouchard, a former world number five who has slumped to 56th in the rankings, it was another blow after her first-round exit in Indian Wells.\n\n\"It has been a bit of a struggle,\" said a stone-faced Bouchard, who was unable to account for her loss of form.\n\nBouchard was a beaten finalist at Wimbledon in 2014 but, apart from a run to the semi-final at Sydney where she was beaten by Britain's Johanna Konta, she has been unable to make an impact this year.\n\n\"We've had a good pre-season and get a good foundation and the stars aligned a bit for us this year so far. We have worked hard and it is just that hard work starting to pay off,\" said the Australian.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who took time out from tennis in 2014 to play cricket, has never come up against her compatriot Stosur before and while she will start as clear underdog, she is relishing the challenge.\n\n\"It will be good. Obviously, we have trained together and hit a lot so it will be interesting. I am really excited. For me it is just another opportunity to go out and play,\" she said.\n\nThe Puerto Rican Miami-resident struggled from the outset and although she battled back well in the second set, Cirstea kept her cool to book a second round meeting with Latvian 19th seed Anastasija Sevastova."
