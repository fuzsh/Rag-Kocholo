        "text": "And Czech 31st seed Krejcikova – the 2021 French Open winner – had failed to go beyond the fourth round in SW19 until beating American Danielle Collins earlier this week.\n\nHere, the PA news agency looks ahead to day 13 at Wimbledon.\n\nAnother first-time champion incoming\n\nSince Serena Williams won her seventh Wimbledon title in 2016, there have been six first-time women’s singles winners in six Championships. A seventh is guaranteed on Saturday.\n\nKrejcikova is looking to become the fifth Czech player to lift the women’s title.\n\nOne of them was Jana Novotna, who famously cried on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after losing the 1993 final against Steffi Graf before finally lifting the trophy five years later. She took a teenage Krejcikova under her wing but died of cancer in 2017, aged only 49.\n\nKrejcikova said: “I’m thinking about Jana a lot. I have so many beautiful memories and, when I step on the court here, I’m just fighting for every single ball because that’s what I think she would want me to do. I hope she would be proud.”\n\nPaolini is the first Italian to reach a Wimbledon final.\n\nBefore this season she had never been beyond the second round of a grand slam but she reached the fourth round in Australia and then got to the final hurdle at Roland Garros.\n\n“Two grand slam finals in a row was crazy to believe,” the 28-year-old said. “I’m surprised a little bit how I’m managing this.”\n\nBrit watch\n\nEight years ago Henry Patten was sat on an outside court compiling stats for IBM. Now, he’s a Wimbledon finalist.\n\nThe 28-year-old said: “While I was at college, I worked for IBM doing the courtside stats. You’re either put in the outside courts team or if you’re good and switched on, then you get put on the show court team. And I was always on the outside!”\n\nHe will take to Centre Court on Saturday when he teams with Finland’s Harri Heliovaara in the men’s doubles final.\n\nPatten added: “Every single year I would watch Wimbledon and it’s surreal. It’s surreal to even be playing it to be honest. I feel very privileged to be able to be a part of a final here.”\n\nOther business\n\nFor the first time since 2018, Hsieh Su-wei turned up at Wimbledon and failed to win the women’s doubles.\n\nShe was beaten in the semi-finals alongside Elise Mertens.\n\nTheir conquerors, Czech Katerina Siniakova and American Taylor Townsend, will face the second seeds, New Zealand’s Erin Routliffe and Canada’s Gabriela Dabrowski, in Saturday’s final.\n\nMeanwhile, Dutch wheelchair ace Diede de Groot is on for a 15th-successive grand slam singles title as she faces compatriot Aniek van Koot in the women’s singles final.\n\nOrder of play\n\nCentre Court from 2pm:\n\nJasmine Paolini (7) v Barbora Krejcikova (31)\n\nHenry Patten/Harri Heliovaara v Max Purcell/Jordan Thompson (15) (men’s doubles final)\n\nGabriela Dabrowski/Erin Routliffe (2) v Katerina Siniakova/Taylor Townsend (4) (women’s doubles final)\n\nCourt One from 11am:\n\nDiede de Groot (1) v Aniek van Koot (4) (women’s wheelchair final)\n\nKim Clijsters/Martina Hingis v Cara Black/Sam Stosur (invitational doubles)\n\nBob Bryan/Mike Bryan v James Blake/Bruno Soares (invitational doubles)\n\nWeather\n\nOvercast changing to sunny intervals by early evening, with highs of 19, according to the Met Office.\n\nHenry Patten and his Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara are in the men’s doubles final (Mike Egerton/PA) Diede de Groot is targeting another grand slam title (Andrew Matthews/PA)"
