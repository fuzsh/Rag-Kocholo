        "text": "(CNN) -- Tennis superstar Roger Federer is hoping to help the victims of the Australian floods by setting up a fund-raising event this weekend.\n\nRising waters in Queensland have left the state's premier warning of \"the worst natural disaster in our history\" as homes have been flooded and power cut off in the capital city Brisbane.\n\nFederer, who is in Melbourne preparing to begin the defense of his Australian Open title next week, set up a similar exhibition following the Haiti earthquakes a year ago.\n\n\"The floods here in Australia are devastating! I am on my way to practice now and am going to speak with Tennis Australia to see if we perhaps can organize something on Sunday to help raise some funds for the people of Queensland who have been affected,\" Federer said on his Facebook page on Wednesday.\n\n\"Stay tuned as it would be great if the sport of tennis can help out right before the Australian Open begins.\"\n\nTense waiting game for Brisbane residents\n\nThe 29-year-old Swiss player supports several charities, having launched his own foundation in 2003 to help disadvantaged children.\n\nHe and tennis rival Rafael Nadal raised $2.6 million in the first of two offseason charity matches in Zurich in December.\n\nHe also visited tsunami victims as part of his role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.\n\nTennis stars have already contributed to the Queensland disaster fund, with American Andy Roddick donating $10,800 after reaching the final of the tournament in Brisbane last weekend.\n\nAustralian star Samantha Stosur also made a donation, and Roddick's website reported that the men's and women's ATP and WTA ruling bodies would pledge $10 for every ace serve hit by their players in Brisbane, Sydney this week and the Australian Open."
