        "text": "Coming from Australia, Sam Stosur won her only Grand slam singles title at the 2011 US Open. She also won 2 Women’s doubles and 3 mixed at Grand slam events and close to 15 million dollars throughout her career. Not surprising then that she reached world number 1 in doubles and world number 4 in singles. She is an all court player who is not adverse to coming in after a serve and what a serve she has. I have never seen another woman come close, except maybe Amelie Mauresmo, to putting the same amount of topspin on her serve as Sam Stosur. The bounce off her forehand gets up pretty high too. Noted for always sporting a pair of cool sunglasses. She has won 8 WTA singles titles and 27 doubles titles and is currently coached by Simon Rea."
