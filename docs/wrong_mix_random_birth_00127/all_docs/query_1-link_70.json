        "text": "âœ¨ Calling all community sport volunteers in Australia- how supported are you to respond to child abuse in sport? We want to help! âœ¨ This survey only takes about 15 minutes and is a powerful way to share your voice on what support volunteers, like you, may need to respond to child abuse in sport. ðŸ‘‰ https://lnkd.in/g3bE9S2n This survey is seeking to understand volunteers' capabilities, opportunities and motivations to respond to child abuse in sport, as well as their perceptions of the broader sport culture. If we want to truly create safe spaces in sport we really need to understand what some of the current challenges are for the largely volunteer workforce. This information will help target interventions and support to where it is most needed. It takes about 15 mins to complete but the information you provide will be invaluable to shaping future initiatives and support in this space. Our team remains committed to ensuring these results inform meaningful change across the sector. Afterall, this research was supported by the community through our crowdfunding campaign last year, which many of you (our network of colleagues, friends and family) supported. This is not just our job as researchers, this is our passion. If you volunteer in any community sport club across Australia please take a moment to complete this survey. ðŸ‘‰ https://lnkd.in/g3bE9S2n If you manage a club, a relevant organisation or just want to promote this work, please reach out as we have an email template you can use and we'd love to include your organisation/you as a supporter in our acknowledgements. If you have followed our work, you'll already know that our team is passionate about ensuring our work and the results reach far beyond academic publications. We are committed to ensuring evidence leads to change. But we cannot do that without the voices of volunteers. Thank you for supporting child safe cultures in sport. Direct Team: AurÃ©lie Pankowiak (PhD)Alex Parker Fiona McLachlan Dr Jennifer Ellen Hamer with support from many colleagues and partner organisations both here and abroad. Victoria University\n\nIt was great to attend an in conversation event last night facilitated by Tracey Lee Holmes with Olympic legends Kieran Perkins and Patrick Johnson. It was a regreshing conversation about the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games and broader movement. A key take away for me was the importance on diversity, equity, and inclusion- and social issues broadly- which affect both local and global markets and communities. Instead of shying away from these issues and the role of sport - especially the social role and beyond elite and high performance sport - sport organisations need to lean into them and engage - knowing that they may not be easy and be uncomfortable. But the idea that sport is neutral and a political - and canâ€™t get invovled - is a thing of the past. Also how we engage and keep the new younger generation in sport will be a key challenge! Sport needs to keep up with changing landscape. ðŸ“¸ Kasey Symons Jacqueline Shields"
