Joining them are 2016 Australian Paralympian of the Year and 2022 Australian of the Year Dylan Alcott, together with tennis player Daria Saville and 9News sports presenters James Bracey and Tony Jones.\n\nThe battle of the Hot Seat led to Stosur winning $100,000 for her charity Rally4Ever.\n\nStosur recently spoke to 9Entertainment about her experience on Millionaire Hot Seat, her experience as an ambassador for Rally4Ever, and her determination to make a positive impact through her winnings.\n\nParticipating in Millionaire Hot Seat was a unique and exciting opportunity for Stosur. Reflecting on the experience, she shared, \"It was a really fun experience. I was really nervous leading up to it, but once you're out there, it was okay.\"\n\nWatch Sam Stosur's reaction to winning Millionaire Hot Seat in the video above.\n\nDespite the initial jitters, Stosur embraced the challenge and quickly adapted to the game's format. Having watched the show from home, she had a sense of what to expect, which helped ease her nerves.\n\nStosur beat out her competition, being the last player on the game show and answering the $100,000 question.\n\nStosur revealed, \"Being in the Hot Seat at the end is where you want to be, and thankfully, I was pretty certain I knew I had it right, but you still second guess yourself a bit in the moment.\"\n\nQUIZ: Test your skills in our weekly Millionaire Hot Seat quiz\n\nAs an ambassador for Rally4Ever, a cause she has been involved with for the past few years, Stosur saw this opportunity as a chance to make a difference.\n\nRally4Ever utilizes the sport of tennis to foster unity and create positive change. The organisation prides itself on breaking down barriers and connecting everyone in the community to the game of tennis. Rally4Ever brings people together from diverse backgrounds, ages and abilities with programs that are purpose-built to get people moving again and form long-lasting friendships and meaningful social connections along the way.\n\nStosur expressed her enthusiasm for this initiative, stating, \"I love the idea of using tennis to bring people together.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Millionaire Hot Seat contestant's request for Eddie McGuire before whopping prize money win\n\nWith a clear goal in mind, Stosur aimed to win as much as possible to support Rally4Ever's cause. Recognising the value of funds in helping the charity's impactful work, \"It can be so hard to keep generating enough to keep making the impact they want to, so I know this will be a huge boost to them and really bring some extra excitement to everyone involved,\" Stosur said.\n\nWatch Millionaire Hot Seat Weekdays 5pm on Channel 9 and 9Now."
