        "text": "For the average person like you and me, it sometimes feels like a challenge just to eat a high-protein breakfast, fit a workout into a busy day, and (maybe) get a good night’s sleep.\n\nBut Sam Stosur, the professional tennis player, a former No. 1 in doubles, and winner of the 2011 US Open, consistently trains hard to perform at her best—while traveling the world. When it comes to health and fitness, Sam is certainly exceptional, and we could all learn something from her dedication.\n\nSam took a break while training in Liechtenstein to talk to USANA about quality nutrition, living a healthy lifestyle, and her love of tennis. Follow her on Twitter @bambamsam30 to hear more from this talented athlete.\n\nQ. How do you make sure your meals are nutritious?\n\nA. There are always options. It’s about ordering the right things.\n\nQ. What’s a go-to healthy meal for you?\n\nA. Lately, avocado on toast. Bit of carbs, some good fats, bit of olive oil, and lemon.\n\nQ. Do you ever have times when you don’t feel like eating healthy?\n\nA. Everyone does! It depends on how much you have of it [unhealthy foods], and how often. If you really enjoy something, don’t deprive yourself. I love French fries, but they’re probably the worst for you.\n\nQ. What advice would you give to someone who wants to make a lifestyle change?\n\nA. Stick at it for a decent amount of time. Don’t give up after a few days or a week. It can take a while. You have to form good habits. Good habits become better habits. You will actually want to go on that walk or bike ride. The beginning is always hard—after a break I’m more tired. I think having a long-term outlook will help you, and when you start seeing benefits those will also motivate you.\n\nQ. When did you know you wanted to play tennis?\n\nA. I started playing at eight, and by 13 I was like, yep, that’s what I want to do. I loved doing it, and I wanted to be at the court every day after school. My brother and I went there every day. It was just the love of the sport. I didn’t know how much work it would take, about everything that would go into it, but now I’m here.\n\nQ. If you weren’t a tennis player, what would you want to do for a career?\n\nA. Some sport. I don’t know what. At school I played everything. I played basketball, netball [similar to basketball]—I did every sport possible. But I was young when I decided on tennis. I would have done another sport though, if it weren’t for tennis.\n\nQ. Have you ever had days when you don’t feel motivated to train or work out? What gets you through that feeling?\n\nA. You go through stages. Thankfully I haven’t been through too many of those. I’m very determined to be as good as I possibly can. I always give a 100 percent. When that stops happening you have to start thinking about what you’re doing. But if you get discouraged you have to adjust your training. Some days you’re tired, jetlagged.\n\n[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enQzZqqTWzE[/youtube]\n\nIf you’re unable to view the above video, please visit the USANA YouTube channel.\n\nQ. What advice would you give to someone who wants to make a lifestyle change, but can’t seem to overcome their fears or roadblocks?\n\nA. Stick at it for a decent amount of time. Don’t give up after a few days or a week. It can take a while. You have to form good habits. Good habits become better habits. You will actually want to go on that walk or bike ride. The beginning is always hard—after a break I’m more tired. I think having a long-term outlook will help you, and when you start seeing benefits those will also motivate you.\n\nQ. Do you have any fitness tips for someone who’s looking to make their exercise routine a little more intense?\n\nA. Interval training is good. Running and going on the bike for hard, shorter, explosive bursts, then stopping and going again. It’s a good way to have a really intense workout.\n\nQ. What are some of your go-to exercises? For cardio? Strength training?\n\nA. My trainer mixes things up for me. Squats, chin ups, calf raises, lots of basics. It’s a good base to have. I’ve done hundreds of exercises! I do boxing and a bit of swimming. There are heaps of things you can do. I played Frisbee the other day with friends. There’s so much you can do. You can make it fun.\n\nQ. What do you like for a post-workout snack?\n\nA. Avocado on toast! Tonight I had fresh pasta and a meat plate with some cheese and salad. We eat out a lot! I’m happy with a nice salad and a piece of chicken.\n\nQ. What are your favorite USANA supplements?\n\nA. The multivitamins—the USANA® Essentials™.\n\nQ. What do you like about them?\n\nA. When you’re traveling, you don’t get to eat all the things you should. The supplements top off all the things you might miss from your diet when you’re away. They’re a good way to balance out your diet. They make a big difference if you’re a little bit run down and not resting enough. They help quite a bit to support my recovery after a hard training session. Now I can get back in the gym sooner.*\n\nQ. As an athlete, why is it important for you to take quality supplements?\n\nA. You need to know that they’re actually going to be a benefit. The Essentials help me maintain my energy levels, which really helps me power through my workouts. I feel like they give me the nutrition I need to perform at my best. And doping is a big risk. I would never want to take any big risks. USANA will actually guarantee their supplements, and that’s important.*\n\nQ. What do you feel is your greatest accomplishment off the court?\n\nA. Enjoying myself, and having good friends.\n\nQ. When you’re traveling, what do you miss most about home?\n\nA. I would say going to the beach, seeing my friends, hanging out at my favorite café. You take them for granted. Then when you’re not there you miss it. I enjoy traveling. If I never had to get on another plane though I would miss it. You can be in some amazing places.\n\nQ. What are some of your hobbies?\n\nA. Snorkeling, scuba diving, mountain bike riding, running in the mountains. I’m pretty active.\n\nQ. What is your favorite place to snorkel?\n\nA. Sydney. Where I live. I can’t complain about that!\n\nQ. What’s your favorite way to communicate on social media? Twitter, Facebook, Instagram?\n\nA. I’ve been on Facebook a while, but I’m new to Twitter and Instagram. I wasn’t sure about Twitter before, but I don’t mind it now.\n\nQ. What’s your favorite TV show or movie?\n\nA. Lately I’ve been watching Modern Family, Homeland, House of Cards. My favorite movie is Notting Hill. I can watch it over and over.\n\nQ. What’s something that always makes you laugh?\n\nA. Being with friends. I’m pretty easy going.\n\nQ. What is one fact about you that many people don’t know?\n\nA. I like scuba diving. Once you learn to breathe it’s all right.\n\nQ. How would you describe your ideal vacation?\n\nA. It would be active, with lots of stuff through the day, then having good food at the end of the day. I’m not going to sit around the pool all day. I’ve only been on vacation two times in last six years. One of them was a camping trip in Tasmania.\n\nQ. How do you like to celebrate big wins?\n\nA. After the US open we didn’t have a restaurant or any reservations, so I won and we didn’t know what to do. My manager knew of a bar, so we had a party with a bunch of pizzas. It was fun but I was pretty tired by then!\n\n*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\n\n*The mentioned athlete is either a distributor or dedicated user who has received compensation for her partnership and/or complimentary USANA products.\n\n**Our Athlete Guarantee Program permits select athletes, some of whom have high profiles and are highly compensated, to enter an agreement with USANA which states that, during the term of the agreement, should the athlete test positive for a banned substance included in World Anti-Doping Agency regulations as a result of taking USANA nutritional products, USANA will compensate that athlete two times their current annual earnings up to $1 million, based on the athlete’s personal level of competition, endorsement, and other income, as well as other factors."
