        "text": "Few people on tour know Melbourne, Australia as intimately as the WTA's Aussie Samantha Stosur. If you find yourself making the trek anytime soon, let's say, for instance, during the Australian Open, Sam has suggestions to help you lead a most enjoyable vacation. She says some of her favorite hometown hobbies include mountain bike riding, snorkeling and eating.\n\nSAMS FAVORITE ACTIVITIES\n\nActivity: Snorkel\n\nLocation: Coogee Beach, Sydney, New South Wales\n\nSam says Coogee Beach is her favorite beach in the world, and seeing as how she loves watersports, snorkeling in particular, Coogee is an ideal spot to visit. In addition to witnessing sea life up close, you'll find stunning ocean views while strolling along the coastal walk. If you're feeling a bit lazy, park yourself on the sand and soak up the sun's rays – don't forget to bring an umbrella and sunscreen to prevent sunburn. Coogee Beach is family friendly and has an abundance of cafes, pubs, restaurants and hotels in the local area.\n\nActivity: Mountain Bike\n\nLocation: Falls Creek, Northeast Victoria\n\nThe proximity to Melbourne, and other popular destinations, makes Falls Creek a worthy option for a mountain bike weekend on the big mountains of a thawed-out ski resort. Cyclists see Victoria’s most stunning scenery, quiet country roads, alpine ascents, friendly locals and a packed events calendar. Rides range from beginner trails along the village aqueducts to more challenging trails like Bogong High Plains. Falls Creek not only offers one of the most complete cycling experience of any destination in Australia, but boasts a breathtaking landscape of ancient mountain ranges, glacial lakes, heritage huts, clear springs and waterfalls, and a plethora of stunning wildflowers in the summer.\n\nSAMS FAVORITE RESTAURANTS\n\nThe Pound Cafe\n\n566 Chapel St., South Yarra, VIC\n\nSam orders: Coffee + Breakfast\n\nWabi Sabi Garden Japanese Restaurant\n\n17 Wellington St., St Kilda, VIC\n\nSam orders: Miso black cod\n\nIs it Café\n\n11 Izett St, Praharn, VIC\n\nSam orders: Banana pancakes\n\nKoko [Asian Cuisine]\n\nCrown Entertainment Complex\n\n8 Whiteman St., Southbank, VIC Crown Casino\n\nSam orders: Authentic Teppanyaki\n\nSAMS FAVORITE WINE\n\nGoodness Grapeness\n\nSam Sees Red\n\nDid you know that Australia is the world's fourth largest exporter of wine? With wine being produced in every state, there is no shortage of vino in the land Down Under! The main wine regions are located in the southern, cooler parts of the country, such as Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland. If you plan to partake in a winery tour, the major varieties you'll swirl are Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Semillon, Pinot noir, Riesling and Sauvignon blanc. Sam says when she sips, she prefers to pour red."
