        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) announced today the Aces for Humanity, a joint WTA and USANA Health Sciences initiative supporting the USANA True Health Foundation, has raised $25,000 this year toward the not-for-profit philanthropy whose mission is to provide the most critical human necessities to those suffering or in need.\n\nBeginning at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, every ace served at a Premier-level WTA event translated into a dollar donation for the Foundation. For every ace served by the eight USANA Brand Ambassadors—Caroline Wozniacki, Eugenie Bouchard, Madison Keys, Monica Puig, Sloane Stephens, Samantha Stosur, Zhang Shuai and Zheng Saisai—the WTA contributed $10 to the campaign, while every ace served by any other WTA player translated into a $5 donation. In sum, 435 aces were served by the eight USANA Ambassadors resulting in a donation of $24,220. The overall amount was increased to $25,000.\n\n\"The WTA is proud to contribute $25,000 toward the USANA True Health Foundation,\" stated WTA CEO Steve Simon. \"Our entrusted partnership with USANA spans nearly ten years and we are pleased to have the opportunity to provide support to this deserving Foundation which helps those in need.\"\n\n\"The WTA has played a substantial role in our humanitarian efforts over the years, and has assisted the Foundation in providing meals to hundreds of children and aid to those affected by earthquakes and floods around the globe,\" said USANA True Health Foundation President Deb Jordan. \"We are grateful for our partnership with the WTA and the generous donations they continue to contribute through this interactive initiative.\"\n\nIn March 2012, USANA – a global nutritional supplements company and longstanding WTA partner – created the USANA True Health Foundation to provide immediate and long-term assistance to suffering populations worldwide, and to help improve both their health and living conditions. Some of the foundations' efforts include providing nutrition, clothing, shelter, medical assistance and health education. The USANA True Health Foundation was created by Dr. Myron Wentz, USANA's founder, and Dave Wentz, USANA Co-CEO, to help expand and enhance the company's on-going charitable efforts.\n\nThe USANA True Health Foundation has provided aid toward the Nepal earthquake relief efforts earlier this year by donating $50,000. Funds from the initiative have also helped support those affected in the Philippines by typhoon Haiyan in 2013 by providing medical aid, supplies and restoring clean water systems.\n\nUSANA is one of the WTA's global premier partners and serves as the Official Health Supplement Supplier for the WTA. Since 2006 the company has provided its high-quality nutritional supplements, bars, and meal replacement products to more than 170 WTA players, including eight of the current Top 10, and 15 players in the Top 20.\n\nMEDIA CONTACT:\n\nAmy Binder, WTA, +1.727.502.1233, [email protected]\n\nAshley Collins, USANA, +1.801.954.7629, [email protected]\n\nAbout USANA:\n\nFounded in 1992, USANA Health Sciences (NYSE: USNA) is a U.S.-based nutritional company that manufactures high-quality supplements, personal care and healthy products in its FDA-registered facility in Salt Lake City.
