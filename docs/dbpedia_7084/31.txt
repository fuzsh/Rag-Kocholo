2. “Сталкер” (“Stalker”)

Year: 1979

Genre: Drama/Sci-Fi

Why Learn Russian with Movies?

There are many reasons why you should watch Russian movies to learn the language. Here are just a few:

Movies provide you with thematic vocabulary based on genre or topic. Movie genres and plots are diverse, and so is the vocabulary that they use. Looking to learn slang? Pick a current movie with a contemporary setting. Want to learn historical terms? Try a period piece.

Movies hold your attention by entertaining you. It’s easier to get in two hours of Russian practice when it masquerades as entertainment. Rather than trying to maintain your focus as you stare, glassy-eyed, at a textbook, why not let a movie entertain and educate you?

Movies immerse you in the Russian language. Sure, TV can be great for learning if you have time constraints, but the added length of movies provides more of a chance for you to really get into them. Since immersion is really important in learning a language naturally, this is a great way to get some serious time studying Russian without leaving your couch.

If you have trouble keeping up with a movie and want to watch shorter clips, the FluentU program has Russian videos with interactive captions and other learning tools. You can use these to prepare yourself for watching full-length movies.

If you need more options, check out these great Russian movies on Amazon’s Prime Video, these Russian movies and TV shows on Netflix or these sites for finding Russian movies with Russian subtitles.

With so many great options to take advantage of, you won’t run out any time soon.

Pop some popcorn, sit back, relax and watch your Russian grow!
