Thankfully, innovative teaching methods are changing the educational landscape and bringing new opportunities into the field of language learning. One of these innovations is Open Textbook for Russian created Dina Zhuravleva (lecturer of Russian Language Proficiency at the University of Groningen ) and dr. Yuliya Kazanova (a practicing Ukrainian and Russian teacher, translator and assessor), both involved with Russian language teaching within the BA #EuropeanLanguagesandCultures at the UG.\n\nWhat is an open textbook?\n\nIt is an e-book with an open license that has been made freely available online for everyone. Learners, teachers and everyone else from all over the world from other universities, for example, have free access to this material. The book can be downloaded in various formats for offline use, such as PDF or MOBI (used for storing ebooks).\n\nCould you tell us more about this open Russian textbook?\n\nFrom the very start, we aim to immerse learners into the new language, and we do this using FLIL (Film and Language Integrated Learning (FLIL) and CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) concepts. The film creates an immersive environment for the students. We work with the film Stiliagi (The Hipsters, 2008, directed by Valeriy Todorovskiy). Watching the film, the students find themselves in Moscow of the 1950s and get to know the Soviet subculture called stiliagi and their struggle for self-expression within the prevailing reality of the Soviet repression. We discuss content matters raised by the film, such as youth organizations in the Soviet Union, persecution of dissenters, antisemitism, black market and underground trade, as well as everyday life of different social classes. We also work with the language of specific film episodes.\n\nWhat is so innovative about this approach?\n\nWe use films and video clips not as an auxiliary tool, as many other second-language classrooms, but base the whole learning process around it. Our teaching practice is inspired by the research findings of Professor Marjolijn Verspoor, who contributed to the introduction of FLIL into second-language learning. Learners (re-)watch the film episodes and are thus repeatedly exposed to authentic Russian language, so that they gradually learn it without explicitly focusing on grammar. We combine the film with learning language through content. Students are not asked to focus their attention on the language form, but on the meaning. When they use Russian themselves, minor grammar mistakes donâ€™t matter because the main focus is on being able to convey meaning.\n\nWhat learning activities does the textbook include?\n\nWe zoom in on specific short scenes and the language used there. The learners make vlogs, role-plays, mind maps, and impersonate characters from the film. At the end of the course, they watch the whole film for another time and reflect on how the course has enriched their understanding of language and content.\n\nWhat do the students say about this teaching approach?\n\nThey absolutely enjoy the visual approach to language learning and exposure to authentic spoken language. By the end of the course, they are happy to realize how much they have learnt. This course teaches, empowers and motivates them to watch other Russian films using the same techniques. Students also love collaborative learning when they do role plays or vlogs together.\n\nWhat are your future plans?\n\nWe shall finish the textbook by summer and plan to use it on our courses in the new academic year. We are very enthusiastic about this prospect, and so are our students!\n\nIf you have any questions or want to learn more about the Open Textbook project, feel free to contact Dina and Yuliya."
