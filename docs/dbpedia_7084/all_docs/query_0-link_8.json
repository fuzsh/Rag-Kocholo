Set in WWII, it follows a Red Army soldier as he goes home and falls in love along the way.\n\nThe dialogue isn’t terribly fast and the film is available on YouTube with English subtitles, so it’s a good option for any level of language learner.\n\nMuch of the vocabulary is pretty general, but there are also some military terms scattered about that you can learn.\n\nWhere to watch: YouTube | The Criterion Channel\n\n2. “Сталкер” (“Stalker”)\n\nYear: 1979\n\nGenre: Drama/Sci-Fi\n\nThis is a Soviet classic by director Andrei Tarkovsky. Though it has some science fiction elements, it’s primarily a drama about an expedition to a mysterious area known as the “Zone,” said to fulfill desires. A lot of fighting occurs along the way.\n\nIt’s appropriate for any level of language learner to learn and practice general vocabulary. There’s not a lot of dialogue, so you’ll have plenty of time to practice any words you don’t already know.\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video | Max | Apple TV | Google Play | YouTube | Vudu\n\n3. “Солярис” (“Solaris”)\n\nYear: 1972\n\nGenre: Drama/Sci-Fi\n\nThis film is based on the 1961 sci-fi novel of the same name. It follows the emotional crises of several crew members aboard a space station. It’s widely considered a classic sci-fi film.\n\nIt’s best for intermediate and advanced learners and is great for learning space-related vocabulary. While the dialogue isn’t fast, it uses some advanced words that may overwhelm beginning learners.\n\nIf you have trouble following the plot, you might also try watching the 2002 American film “Solaris.” While the two movies aren’t identical, they’re based on the same novel, so it could help familiarize you with the plot and then follow along in Russian.\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video | Max | Apple TV | Google Play | YouTube | Vudu\n\n4. “Брат” (“Brother”)\n\nYear: 1997\n\nGenre: Action/Crime drama\n\nFreshly released from the military, Danila hopes to have a fresh start in St. Petersburg. There, he gets caught up in the criminal world that his older brother is involved in. A sequel (“Брат 2″/”Brother 2”) was released in 2000.\n\nDue to the mature nature of the film, it’s best for adult learners. Since it leans heavily on vocabulary that most beginning students don’t use (or need), it’s also probably best for more advanced learners.\n\nHowever, anyone who chooses to watch this movie will learn slang and all sorts of vocabulary related to crime and the military.\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video\n\n5. “Утомлённые солнцем” (“Burnt by the Sun”)\n\nYear: 1994\n\nGenre: War drama\n\n“Burnt by the Sun” is an award-winning film that depicts the personal impact of the Great Purge of the late 1930s in which many government officials and Communist Party members were killed as “saboteurs.” In the movie, an Army commander and his family are vacationing in the country when his wife’s lost love arrives, which leads to trouble for the commander.\n\nWhile the dialogue isn’t easy, this movie is worth the effort for any language learner who invests in the subtitled version.\n\nThis film is a good option for learning political and military vocabulary, but it’ll also help you learn a lot about this important part of Russian history.\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video | Apple TV | Google Play | YouTube | Vudu\n\n6. “Левиафан” (“Leviathan”)\n\nYear: 2014\n\nGenre: Crime drama\n\nIn this film, a man from a coastal town battles a corrupt mayor to try to prevent his house from being demolished. Though the plot may seem simple enough, it actually includes some criticism of contemporary Russia.\n\nWhile the subtitles will make it easy for any level of language learner to follow, this film is most appropriate for learners who already have some knowledge of contemporary Russia.\n\nThere’s plenty of general vocabulary in “Leviathan,” but you can also pick up some legal terms.\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video | Apple TV | Google Play | YouTube | Vudu\n\n7. “Стачка” (“Strike”)\n\nYear: 1925\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nHere’s a movie for your reading skills! This is a silent film, so you’ll be reading a few Russian words at a time throughout the movie. It tells the story of a strike by factory workers in 1903 during the pre-Bolshevik Revolution period.\n\nWhen a factory worker is accused of stealing a piece of machinery, he ends up taking his own life. As a result, the other workers rise up against the Tsarist regime. The government officials take strong measures to end the strike.\n\nThis is a good one for beginner Russian learners who want to dip their toes into authentic Russian culture and film history.\n\nWhere to watch: YouTube\n\n8. “Вор” (“The Thief”)\n\nYear: 1997\n\nGenre: Crime/Drama\n\nThis film was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. It takes place after the end of World War II and tells the story of a young widowed mother and her six-year-old son who are left without a place to live.\n\nThey ride the train in search of a new home and meet a veteran Soviet officer who turns out to be a thief. Despite his criminal nature, the man steps into the husband and father role.\n\nIt’s a touching film that tells the difficult story of the economic times for many Russians after the war, and how families had to go to drastic measures to survive.\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video | YouTube\n\n9. “Евдокия” (“Evdokiya”)\n\nYear: 1961\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nThis black-and-white classic is based on a Russian novel by Vera Panova. It shows Russia as it was from the 1920s to the 1960s, and its inhabitants, who mostly lived in small towns.\n\nThis film is about a married couple and their foster children. Evdokim is a silent, hardworking factory worker and Evdokiya is a passionate and beautiful young housewife who hasn’t yet gotten over her first love.\n\nThis film is great for Russian students as the speech is slow and the narrator helps viewers understand the context of the movie. Plus, you can learn words that were commonly spoken by small-town residents in the early- to mid-1960s.\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video | YouTube\n\n10. “Комиссар” (“The Commissar”)\n\nYear: 1967\n\nGenre: War drama\n\nThis film, based on a short story by Vasily Grossman, was banned by the Soviet Union for 20 years because of its messages on anti-Semitism and women’s rights. It wasn’t screened until the late ’80s, after which it was renowned internationally.\n\nClavdia Vavilova, a pregnant commissar (a Communist political worker) is sent to live with a Jewish family. At first, she and the family strongly dislike each other due to political beliefs, but they soon realize that they have a lot in common and grow extremely fond of each other.\n\nThis is the perfect chance to learn Communist terms as well as words that describe the Russian Civil War.\n\nWhere to watch: Prime Video | YouTube\n\n11. “Елена” (“Elena”)\n\nYear: 2011\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV | Kanopy\n\n12. “Карнавал” (“Carnival”)\n\nYear: 1982\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy/Drama\n\nIn Russia, aspiring actors and actresses move to the capital, Moscow, to pursue their dreams.

The later parts showcase her aspiring acting career, sharing terms particular to that industry.\n\nWhere to watch: Soviet Movies Online\n\n13. “Русский ковчег” (“Russian Ark”)\n\nYear: 2002\n\nGenre: Experimental historical drama\n\n“Russian Ark” is a remarkable film known for its breathtaking single-take cinematography.

It’s also a great way to explore classic Soviet cinema and understand the cultural significance of such films in Russian history.\n\nWhere to watch: Youtube\n\n16. “Я буду рядом” (“I’ll Be Around”)\n\nYear: 2012\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nThis film presents a great look at the so-called “new Russians,” or middle-class and wealthier individuals who live a much more comfortable life than Russians of the past.\n\nThe main character, Inna, is a single mom who works as a manager in a restaurant in Moscow.

Here are just a few:\n\nMovies provide you with thematic vocabulary based on genre or topic. Movie genres and plots are diverse, and so is the vocabulary that they use. Looking to learn slang? Pick a current movie with a contemporary setting. Want to learn historical terms? Try a period piece.\n\nMovies hold your attention by entertaining you. It’s easier to get in two hours of Russian practice when it masquerades as entertainment. Rather than trying to maintain your focus as you stare, glassy-eyed, at a textbook, why not let a movie entertain and educate you?\n\nMovies immerse you in the Russian language. Sure, TV can be great for learning if you have time constraints, but the added length of movies provides more of a chance for you to really get into them. Since immersion is really important in learning a language naturally, this is a great way to get some serious time studying Russian without leaving your couch.\n\nIf you have trouble keeping up with a movie and want to watch shorter clips, the FluentU program has Russian videos with interactive captions and other learning tools. You can use these to prepare yourself for watching full-length movies.\n\nIf you need more options, check out these great Russian movies on Amazon’s Prime Video, these Russian movies and TV shows on Netflix or these sites for finding Russian movies with Russian subtitles.\n\nWith so many great options to take advantage of, you won’t run out any time soon.\n\nPop some popcorn, sit back, relax and watch your Russian grow!"
