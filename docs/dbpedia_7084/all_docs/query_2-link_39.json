And of course, improve your Russian at the same time!\n\nWatching movies in Russian is an awesome way to improve your Russian‚Äîespecially your speaking and listening skills. Why not make learning a new language fun and get a similar experience to immersing yourself with native speakers, from the comfort of your home?\n\nGet the popcorn üçø ready and start studying!\n\nHOW DOES LEARNING RUSSIAN\n\nWITH MOVIES WORK?\n\nThe movie is broken down into short clips of about five minutes each to help you focus on one piece of content at a time. You¬¥ll watch each clip three times following these steps:\n\nSTEP 1:\n\nWATCH WITH RUSSIAN SUBTITLES\n\nThis way, you‚Äôll be reading and listening at the same time, which is a fantastic way to learn because you‚Äôll be taking in the language simultaneously with two senses.\n\nYou won‚Äôt feel under too much pressure because even if you miss what‚Äôs been said, you can still see it written in the subtitles. You‚Äôll also remember new expressions better since you‚Äôve already seen them in their written form as well.\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nLEARN FROM THE CLIP\n\nAfter watching the clip the first time with Russian subtitles (Step 1), you¬¥ll watch it again, but this time after every couple phrases, you¬¥ll see a slide with literal and actual English translations and hear me read each phrase twice in slow Russian.\n\nWe¬¥ll go through every single phrase like this to make sure you understand everything and can clearly hear how each word is pronounced.\n\nSTEP 3:\n\nWATCH WITHOUT SUBTITLES\n\nAfter going through Steps 1 & 2, you¬¥ll watch the clip again without subtitles. By then, you¬¥ll be able to understand most of what is said in the movie without having to rely on subtitles. Yay!\n\nHERE¬¥S WHAT ELSE YOU GET\n\nDUAL RU / ENG\n\nSUBTITLES\n\nIf you¬¥re a big fan of dual subtitles, you¬¥ll have an option to watch each clip with simultaneous RU/ENG subtitles that will help you instantly check if you‚Äôre actually understanding Russian or just getting the gist.\n\nDOWNLOADABLE\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nThe PDF document that comes with the video lessons is a real work of art! You¬¥ll find a Russian transcript with accent marks for every single word, English literal AND correct translations, and a list of colloquial phrases from the movie worth learning by heart.\n\nLIFETIME ACCESS\n\nTO THE COURSE\n\nYou will have lifetime access to all materials for you to return to whenever you want. You will be blown away by your improvement when you come back to the lessons a couple months later! Additionally, you will receive all future updates of the course for free.\n\nWHY DOES LEARNING RUSSIAN THROUGH MOVIES\n\nJUST WORK?\n\nMovies give you visual context ‚Äì you learn faster and remember for longer\n\nMovies teach you authentic language, not textbook Russian\n\nYou learn Russian pronunciation from the best actors\n\nWatching movies doesn‚Äôt feel like learning and is fun\n\nMovies give you cultural insight while you learn about culture and history.\n\nCHECK OUT THE SAMPLE LESSON\n\nONE-TIME PAYMENT\n\nLIFETIME ACCESS\n\n$87/ per movie\n\n.\n\nONE-TIME PAYMENT\n\nLIFETIME ACCESS\n\n$197/ three movies\n\nYou¬¥re saving $64\n\n100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that you will love the course! But I want you to feel confident in trying it out for yourself, that¬¥s why I offer a 100% risk-free guarantee. You can try Russian with Movies, and if you aren¬¥t satisfied, just ask me for a full refund within 7 days of the day of your purchase.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWill there be more movies added in the future?\n\nYes, there will be more movie-based courses in the future. They all will be treated as separate courses and sold separately.\n\nHow many movies are included in the course?\n\nOne movie. When you enroll in the course, you choose what movie you want to watch. Each movie is treated as a separate course and sold separately.\n\nI want to improve my speaking. Is the course going to help me speak Russian better?\n\nAlthough Russian with Movies is focused on developing your listening skills and growing your Russian vocabulary, I am confident that it will have a great, positive effect on the other three communication skills ‚Äì reading, writing, and especially speaking.\n\nBy improving your listening, you will automatically improve your speaking, as they are much more interconnected than we think when we are having a natural language-learning experience ‚Äì which is exactly what this course is focused on providing.\n\nHow long will I have access to the lessons?\n\nForever! You not only get lifetime access to all course materials but also all future updates for free.\n\nIs this a video course?\n\nYes. The original movie is broken down into short clips of about five minutes each to help you focus on one piece of content at a time. You¬¥ll have the option to watch the same clip in four different versions: with Russian subtitles, with dual Russian/English subtitles, without subtitles or with Russian subtitles and my voiceover in slow Russian.\n\nCan I download the course?\n\nYou can download the transcript but not the video lessons. I cannot legally provide you with the entire movie. However, you¬¥ll have lifetime access to all course materials and don¬¥t really need to worry about downloading the lessons since you can come back and revisit them anytime!\n\nI'm a teacher - can I use \"Russian with Movies\" with my students?\n\nNo, this course is not for classroom use. You cannot purchase it and then use it with your students. If you‚Äôre a teacher or school and you want to use it in class, then you can contact me to set up a licensing arrangement.\n\nDo you offer a money-back guarantee?\n\nYes. You can try the course, and if you aren¬¥t satisfied, just ask me for a full refund within 7 days of the day of your purchase.\n\nERIC, USA\n\nHaving the film broken up into small chunks is very helpful. The order of the steps for each video clip is very useful, going from Russian subtitles to translation to no subtitles. I especially appreciate the work put into the transcripts, such as marking when words are truncated in colloquial speech, which words are slang, which words are incorrectly used by uneducated people, and the excellent full translation.\n\nLANE, USA\n\nI‚Äôm really enjoying watching the movie. It‚Äôs helping my listening skills a lot. It‚Äôs so fun and challenging to listen, watch and try to understand what is being said at full speed! It has surprised me to see so many words that are shortened when spoken. I am grateful for the text that shows that. Very helpful!\n\nDISCLAIMER: Boost Your Russian does not own the rights to the movies used in the Russian with Movies courses.\n\nThe movies have been repurposed with the intent of educating and inspiring Russian language learners.\n\nThe original movies belong to their respective producers.\n\nStill have any questions about the course?\n\nEmail me at hello@boostyourrussian.com"
