(Download)\n\nWhy Learn a Language by Watching TV Shows and Movies?\n\nRegardless of what language you want to learn, there’s probably a TV show or movie in that language that you’ll love.\n\nHere’s why watching TV shows and movies is well-loved among language learners:\n\nIt familiarizes you with native speech. Sometimes, historical or fantasy shows might not be accurate reflections of current speech norms, but most contemporary shows use common language.\n\nIt puts vocabulary in context. If you don’t understand a word, you can often guess based on what’s happening and visual cues, like characters’ facial expressions. Plus, you can see how vocabulary might be used in different situations.\n\nIt’s addictive and fun. Once you get on a roll, you’ll just want to keep watching them. And when you’re watching in your target language, the addictive nature of shows can lead to massive improvements in your language skills.\n\nHowever, some language learners don’t know what they’re doing when it comes to learning with movies and TV shows. It can be tempting to just watch and hope the language will start to sink in, but being unprepared means you won’t get as much out of watching something as you could.\n\nNot to worry—we’re here to help!\n\n4 Stages of Foreign Movies and TV Shows for Language Learners\n\nTo keep easing yourself in, I recommend following these four stages of foreign movies and TV shows. Start at the top and work your way down as you progress through the language.\n\n1. Kids’ TV Shows and Movies\n\nStart by watching children’s shows.\n\nThink about it: most children’s programs are educational and serve to teach children basic values and linguistic rules. They provide simple language along with corresponding images, so they’re easy to understand.\n\nGet in touch with your inner child! If you have kids, you can also sit down with them and watch a show together, like “Dora la Exploradora” (Dora the Explorer).\n\nKids’ movies are full of messages that relate to anyone of any age, which can make language learning much easier. As an example, here’s a video showing how to learn Spanish with “Finding Nemo.”\n\n2. Comedy\n\nOnce you’re used to kids’ movies and shows, you can start watching light comedy.\n\nAmerican sitcoms and cartoons are great.\n\nThe most popular ones are all dubbed into many languages. They tend to use easy-to-understand slapstick humor where physical gestures and movement complement the language.\n\nThese include shows like “How I Met Your Mother,” “Modern Family,” “The Simpsons,” etc.\n\nComedies are more likely to feature wordplay than other genres, which can be helpful for advanced learners to really test out their skills. After all, wordplay in your target language often doesn’t translate directly or literally, so understanding it is a strong sign that your skills are very advanced.\n\n3. Thrillers/Action\n\nYou can then move on to thrillers, horror and action series or movies. Action movies are plot-based and very visual, so they’ll often reiterate major plot points to make sure the audience is following.\n\nWhile movies in this genre may feature more specialized, challenging vocabulary, they tend to have more breaks in dialogue to give you time to think about what you’ve heard.\n\nSeries such as “CSI” and “Missing” that exist in their own formats in almost every country often use familiar templates. These follow a repeating pattern, helping you get a feel for what’s going on quickly.\n\n4. Drama/Dark Humor\n\nWhen you’re ready to turn up the heat, drama and dark humor are perhaps the most difficult to understand for their use of puns, double-meanings and situation- or culture-specific language.\n\nMovies and series rooted in underground or minority cultures (think “Breaking Bad” or “The Wire”) can also provide a great challenge, as they tend to feature thick accents and lots of slang. They’re a great source of cultural knowledge and provide excellent practice with different accents.\n\nEssential TV Series and Movie Guides for Language Learners\n\nNow that you have a sense of which genres will work best for your level, here are some awesome TV series and movie guides in different languages you can explore:\n\nArabic TV | Arabic movies\n\nChinese TV | Chinese movies\n\nEnglish TV | English movies\n\nFrench TV | French movies\n\nGerman TV | German movies\n\nItalian TV | Italian movies\n\nJapanese TV | Japanese movies\n\nKorean TV | Korean movies\n\nPortuguese TV | Portuguese movies\n\nSpanish TV | Spanish movies\n\nRussian TV | Russian movies\n\nThis list should be more than enough to get you started!\n\n15 Techniques to Learn a Language by Watching Movies and TV\n\nHere are some additional techniques you can employ to maximize your screen time. Apply them to each stage!\n\n1. Watch Something at Your Level\n\nIt’s easy to get excited and immediately jump into your favorite movies or shows, but you’ll usually learn more by starting with those that match your current skill level.\n\nTry to find a movie or show that’s just challenging enough to keep you engaged and attentive. You want to flex your learner brain, but not get overwhelmed or frustrated.\n\nEven if you find yourself feeling at ease with the language used in a certain show or movie, don’t immediately progress to the next level!\n\nInstead, search for and watch other content that would feature roughly the same level of language. You’d be surprised how often advanced language can sneak into material targeted at younger audiences!\n\nAs you improve, steadily advance to more difficult movies and shows.\n\n2. Make Your Pick Based on Genre\n\nYou should also keep in mind that different genres can offer different language content.\n\nIf there’s a certain kind of language usage you’re looking to learn directly, then keep an eye on the genre before you make your show or movie pick.\n\nA genre can give you a general idea of what kind of dialogue to expect.\n\nHistorical movies, for example, may use some dated terminology. Hospital dramas are full of medical vocabulary, and shows about high school often contain newer slang terms and topics that young people tend to chat about.\n\n3. Read the Show Summary\n\nOnce you’ve selected a show to watch, try to find a summary to familiarize yourself with the plot.\n\nIf you already understand what the show is about, you’ll be able to focus more on the language and less on the storyline.\n\nReading a summary also gives you a preview of the show’s vocabulary, allowing you to look up related words ahead of time. You can even look up the actors and characters to make it easier to remember who’s who while you watch.\n\nIMDb has all kinds of TV summaries and reviews, so you’ll have no trouble finding the essential details of some of the most popular foreign language movies.\n\n4. Watch All in One Go\n\nThis mostly helps with getting a “feel” for how a language sounds, but it’s also important for understanding the language in general and how its pronunciation works.\n\nWhen you’re bombarded with many unfamiliar words, don’t try to understand each and every one.\n\nInstead, relax and let the words flow naturally into your ears.\n\nSlowly, you’ll find yourself recognizing words. Focus on the images and what’s happening on screen—they can help you gain context.\n\nFor a more relaxing approach, try watching something dubbed or subtitled in your own language, then again in the original language a few days later. When you already know the story, it’s easier to focus on how the language is being used.\n\n5. Focus on High-Frequency Words\n\nLet’s be honest: it’s easy to space out or “lose your place” when analyzing a foreign language in shows and movies.\n\nA lot is happening all at once, so it’s not your fault! To refocus yourself, try to hone in on the words you hear most frequently.\n\nThese are the words you’ll have the easiest time remembering in the storm of vocabulary happening within whatever you’re watching.\n\n6. Watch Segment by Segment\n\nThere’s a bottomless gold pot of words and expressions contained in foreign movies and TV series.\n\nThat’s why splitting an episode or movie into small segments is the best way to focus on vocabulary. Check out these great tips for memorizing vocabulary, so you don’t forget all those new words you’ve learned!\n\nHere’s how you can watch by segment:\n\nWatch an episode or movie with subtitles in its original language. As you watch, jot down four or five short sections you liked or that had some interesting dialogue.\n\nOnce you’ve finished, go back and focus on one segment. Turn off the subtitles this time. Since you know the context of the movie, you might catch 40-50% of what’s going on (and increasingly more as you practice).\n\nNow, watch it with the original language subtitles again. Listen for what you missed the first two times. Look up any words or phrases you don’t know and add them to your vocabulary notebook.\n\nFinally, turn off the subtitles and watch the segment again. Congratulate yourself on how much more you’re now understanding!\n\nRepeat with other segments.\n\nTo speed up the process, you can use a program like FluentU to automatically do many of the steps for you and watch the videos in segments and clips.\n\n7. Record Segments and Repeat\n\nIf you’re feeling particularly productive, you can go one step further and use digital recording tools such as Audacity to record segments from TV shows or movies in various formats.\n\nWith Audacity, you can either record the segment directly using your computer’s built-in microphone or press the record button on your smartphone. Then, you can play it back whenever you want.\n\nSometimes the hardest part of listening is recognizing where the splits are between each word. In the beginning, it sounds like one never-ending mash.\n\nHelpfully, Audacity also allows you to slow down recordings to really focus on recognizing sound combinations.\n\n8. Practice Imitating Pronunciation\n\nOnce you have your recording, you can focus on imitating pronunciation.\n\nRepeat the same words and then repeat full phrases, focusing on copying the word sounds.\n\n“Word sounds” are combinations of sounds—how words sound when they’re put together—which don’t necessarily go word-by-word, nor phonetical. English is a great example of this:\n\n“You’re amassing quite a fortune.”\n\nIf we consider how we would naturally pause and place stress on different syllables while speaking, it becomes something like:\n\nYou | ramassin | quai | ta | forchun\n\nOnce you’ve practiced reciting those phrases, you can record yourself and compare it to the original, then repeat until you’re satisfied.\n\n9. Write Down What You Hear\n\nJust because you’re watching something, doesn’t mean you can’t work on your writing skills!\n\nFind a particularly interesting short speech segment and try to write it down in the foreign language. Dissect the text to the best of your ability.\n\nMake sure to rewind and pause as often as you need! Try to avoid using subtitles—you can compare your notes to the official subtitles afterward.\n\nFor an added challenge, try summarizing a scene in your target language after you watch it.\n\nIf you get confused with transcribing or can’t access the subtitles, you can even get help from a translator app with a voice translation option, like Google Translate.\n\nConveniently, Google Translate has both a browser and mobile app version (Android or iOS). Try activating the voice recognition feature while a movie’s playing—it can even detect the language!\n\n10. If You Can Find a Script, Use It\n\nMovie scripts can be tremendously useful for language learners.\n\nTry reading it before you watch the movie to get a clearer understanding of the story and characters. This also gives you the chance to look up any unfamiliar words before you ever hear them in context.\n\nAnother way to use scripts is to keep them handy as you watch the movie and read along. To find scripts, you can use a script database or search for the movie’s title along with the word “script” in your target language.\n\nSimply Scripts might not have tons of international movie scripts, but it does have a few very popular options, such as “El Laberinto del Fauno” (Pan’s Labyrinth) and “Cidade de Deus” (City of God).\n\nAlternatively, you can pick a movie that you’ve watched before in English and practice with the dubbed version. Harry Potter is a great choice because it’s been dubbed in many languages:\n\n11. Change Up Your Subtitling Options\n\nSubtitles can be a great tool to help you understand what’s happening even if you miss a few words. However, if you’re not careful, you might find yourself inadvertently reading and not listening at all.\n\nTry alternating watching segments with the subtitles on and off:\n\nListen to the scene in your target language and try to understand what’s happening.\n\nTurn on the subtitles to check how much you caught.\n\nSwitch the subtitles back off to see if you understand more than before.\n\nIf you don’t want to repeat segments this often, you can also focus on the dialogue and only skim the subtitles when you don’t understand something.\n\nAlways remember that subtitles are just a tool to help prop you up until you refine your skills. Your goal should be to wean yourself off of them.\n\n12. Talk Back to the Characters\n\nMovie watching is usually a one-way street: it talks, you listen. When you’re learning a language, you need to engage more!\n\nLuckily, you can interact with the movie you’re watching to get both listening and speaking practice.\n\nDuring dialogue scenes, pause and guess what the next character will say. You can also repeat lines you enjoy, or even shout advice to the characters. The key here is to speak your target language.\n\nIf you’re watching a movie with action sequences, try narrating it in your target language. No need to waste those precious seconds when you could be improving your language skills!\n\n13. Plan Out Your Watch-and-Learn Sessions\n\nIt’s easy to start watching a movie or show with the intention of learning a language, but actually making it an educational experience takes a bit more willpower.\n\nIt’s easy to revert to just watching something for entertainment. To avoid this, schedule your language-learning watch sessions at a time when you know you won’t be easily distracted.\n\nYou can also switch up your environment to aid in your study efforts. Try watching with a different device and sitting someplace that won’t make you overly comfy and drowsy.\n\nYou can also surround yourself with study materials, such as flashcards, notes or a dictionary.\n\n14. Watch with Others\n\nNobody said you have to watch alone!\n\nFinding others to watch movies and TV shows with is a fun way to enhance the learning experience. The optimal watch-buddies are your fellow language learners.\n\nTogether, you can all share what you learn and ask each other questions. Of course, feel free to discuss the compelling plot or intriguing cinematography.\n\nIf your friends or family are interested, let them join in! Just make sure they don’t distract you from your learning goals.\n\n15. Interact with Other Fans Online\n\nReaching out to other movie fans online is a great way to add both reading and writing practice to your experience learning through movies.\n\nThere are forums, chat rooms and fan pages in virtually any language you can imagine. To find fan groups, try searching “movie fans,” “movie forum” or “movie chat” in your target language.\n\nReddit is a great resource for interacting with people from all over the world, but many people don’t realize that there are subreddits in other languages.\n\nIf you love Spanish-language movies, you might enjoy the Cine (Cinema) subreddit. While most posts are about American movies, there’s nothing stopping you from starting a new thread about your favorite international movies!\n\nWhere to Find Foreign Language Movies and TV Series\n\nThese are the top websites where you can find hundreds or even thousands of shows in different languages:\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix is one of the most popular movie resources out there. Luckily, your subscription also grants you access to tons of foreign language movies–most of which have English subtitles available.\n\nFor even more flexible subtitling, try to find Netflix Originals, which also offer captions in the language of the movie. That means you can watch a movie in a foreign language while also reading along in that language.\n\nHulu\n\nHulu is another streaming service where language students can find some international content. It isn’t quite the fount of international content that Netflix is, but it offers up some strong options.\n\nMost of Hulu’s international content is Asian. Specifically, Hulu offers a good deal of Korean content.\n\nHulu’s offerings seems to change pretty frequently, so if you don’t find something to watch now, check back in a few days!\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon has a unique mixture of shows you can stream via Prime and shows you can purchase on DVD.\n\nIt’s particularly good for finding familiar movies dubbed in a variety of languages. You might also be able to find movies in your target language that you’ve already seen in English, making it easier to follow along.\n\nIt’s also one of the best resources for finding children’s movies in foreign languages, which are ideal for beginning students.\n\nTED\n\nIf you haven’t already heard about TED Talks as a language learner, you’ve been missing out on a gold mine!\n\nCompletely free, TED Talks has over a thousand talks (5-20 minutes in length) from experts and well-known figures on their subject of interest or study—from design issues to philosophy and science.\n\nYou can search by language and topic, and choose to add subtitles in a huge number of languages. The transcript is also available in the original language and in the translation.\n\nYouTube\n\nDon’t forget that there are many—especially older—movies or series available on YouTube.\n\nType in the name of the movie or series (and “subtitles,” if you prefer). For example, if I want to watch “The IT Crowd” with Italian subtitles, I can search for “The IT Crowd sub ITA.”\n\nOne huge benefit of YouTube is that it features a comments section, which is often quite active. For language learners, this can provide both reading and writing practice.\n\nAsianCrush\n\nAsianCrush is a streaming service that focuses exclusively on Asian movies and TV, so it’s perfect for anyone learning Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese or Korean.\n\nYou can filter by country, genre and theme. If you’re searching for Chinese movies, just note that the China region mainly includes movies from Hong Kong, which are generally in Cantonese. If you’re looking for movies in Mandarin, perusing options from Taiwan is more likely to yield results.\n\nAsianCrush has premium options, but it also offers lots of free material supported by ads. This makes AsianCrush a good choice for learners looking to save money.\n\nViki\n\nViki is another streaming service that focuses on Asian content. You can find plenty of great movies and TV shows out of China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and more.\n\nViki offers more subtitle options than other sources, so you can find movies subtitled in Arabic, Chinese, English, French and a huge array of other languages. This is especially useful if English isn’t your first language! You can even filter by subtitle language.\n\nBeeline TV\n\nBeeline TV provides a list of TV channels in many languages, even including Uzbek TV!\n\nIt also has a wide selection of movies from all around the world. The service is conveniently available on most devices.\n\nMultilingual Books\n\nAs the name suggests, Multilingual Books offers a variety of text-based resources in multiple languages.\n\nHowever, it also provides a list of websites and links for watching videos, series and movies in English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese.\n\nLearning with movies and TV can give clarity to the “white noise” of a foreign language. No more gibberish or nonsensical sounds!\n\nIf you’re ready to fast-forward your language skills, then grab your remote and start watching!"
