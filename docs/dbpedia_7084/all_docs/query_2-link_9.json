        "text": "The best way to learn any language is to immerse yourself in the culture of the target language. Such as reading in Russian, watching movies and TV shows in Russian, listening to Russian podcasts, chatting with Russian friends, and learning new words with Russian teachers. Russian series on Netflix will be a great step in creating this true Russian atmosphere for boosting the learning process.\n\nYes, you really can learn Russian on Netflix! And when it comes to Russian TV, Netflix is a gold mine.\n\nSo, what’s the best way to learn from Netflix Russia? Here are some tips on how to watch Russian Netflix for language-learning purposes:\n\nFirst, don’t translate every single word. You’ll get tired and lose interest pretty fast. Instead, either translate the first episode or translate the first few minutes of every episode. Write down the translations in a notebook and look in there every time you hear a familiar word. Once you hear it ten or twenty times, you’ll naturally start to recognize the meaning!\n\nTo help you with that, RussianPod101.com has prepared a list of words and expressions that you’ll hear a lot in Russian movies on Netflix. You can write them down in your “show-notebook” as well. ;)\n\nWithout further ado, our list of some of the best Netflix Russian content for language-learners!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nФарца (Fartsa)—Fartsa, 2015\n\nХождение по мукам (Khozhdeniye po mukam)— The Road to Calvary, 2017\n\nСпарта (Sparta)—Sparta, 2018\n\nТроцкий (Trotsky)—Trotsky, 2017\n\nНюхач (Nyukhach)—The Sniffer, 2017\n\nСмешарики (Smeshariki)—Kikoriki, 2010\n\nМашины Сказки (Mashiny skazki)—Masha’s Tales, 2017\n\nСаранча (Sarancha)—Locust, 2014\n\nМетод (Method)—Method, 2015\n\nМажор (Mazhor)—Silver Spoon, 2015\n\nConclusion\n\n1. Фарца (Fartsa)—Fartsa, 2015\n\nGenre: Crime TV Show\n\nThis show is: Emotional; suspenseful\n\nThis is one of the best Russian shows on Netflix, and it tells a story about four Russian friends who grow up in the early ‘60s in Moscow. Kostya Germanov gambles away a huge sum of money that he needs to find and give to bandits. Three of his friends decide to help him, so he can get that money in time. As they become фарцовщик (fartsovshchik — see below), they start to make a lot of money and their life changes…\n\nInteresting fact:\n\nWhen it comes to Russian history, Netflix shows like this can be a great learning tool.\n\nThe movie title comes from a Russian slang term фарцовка (fartsovka) which is simply “fartsovka” in English. The Soviet Union was a closed country, so foreign goods were scarce and it was illegal to trade them. But scarcity makes things even more desirable, which is how фарцовка (fartsovka) appeared. A number of clever people started to acquire foreign goods from foreigners and sell them to Soviet people. They were called фарцовщик (fartsovschik).\n\nThe most popular goods were clothes, accessories, phonograph records and other sound storages, cosmetics, and books. Ownership of foreign goods gave prestige, which was the basic principle of the arisen subculture – стиляги (stilyagi). Cтиляги were the main buyers of foreign goods. There’s a great Russian musical about this subculture called Cтиляги (Stilyagi).\n\nFor language learners. This Russian Netflix show contains a handful of Soviet Union vocabulary and historic terms, so it will give you a great chance to dig into exciting Russian history. Though the show is about history, language is pretty easy and modern, so you’ll be able to find a lot of useful expressions.\n\nThe vocabulary.\n\nГражданин (grazhdanin) — “Citizen” or “Mister” (in the Soviet Union)\n\nThis was the common form of address to another person in the Soviet Union. гражданин (grazhdanin) was used outside to address an unknown person, while гражданин (grazhdanin) plus the person’s surname were used to officially address someone. The first phrase of the first episode is гражданин Рокотов (grazhdanin Rokotov), meaning “Mister Rokotov.” Find it and remember this word. You’ll hear it a lot in the series. By the way, “Miss” or “Mrs.” will be гражданка (grazhdanka).\n\nПоехали! (Poyekhali!) — “Let’s go!”\n\nThis is a famous phrase that belongs to Yurii Gagarin, the first human to go to outer space. He said it right before the launch. This phrase became a symbol of a new era in the history of Russia.\n\nСпектакль окончен. Занавес. (Spektakl’ okonchen. Zanaves.) — “The show is over. The end.”\n\nLiterally, занавес (zanaves) refers to a curtain on the scene in the theater. The curtain goes up at the beginning of the show and goes down at the end of the show. In this phrase, it’s used as a synonym of “the end.”\n\nКостыль (kostyl’) — “crutch”\n\nWhat is this word doing on the list? The thing is that some Russian names get turned into specific nicknames. For example, the name Константин (Konstantin), or the shorter version Костя (Kostya), is often turned into Костыль (kostyl’). You’ll hear this nickname throughout the show because he’s one of the main heroes. In the first episode, when the main hero gets off the train and meets his friends, he asks: А где Костыль? (A gde Kostyl’?) meaning “And where is Kostyl?” His friends joke: Сломался (Slomalsya) meaning “Broken.”\n\nЖить взахлёб (Zhit’ vzakhlyob) — “To live excitedly/effusively”\n\nThis is a poetic expression that the main hero often quotes and tries to build his life off of. It essentially means “to seize the moment” or “to enjoy every moment of life.” If you’re a person who lives like that, then you can say about yourself: Я живу взахлёб (Ya zhivu vzakhlyob), which means “I live excitedly/effusively,” or Я люблю жить взахлёб (Ya lyublyu zhit’ vzakhlyob), which means “I love to live excitedly/effusively.”\n\nТвою ж мать! (Tvoyu zh mat’!) — “Darn it!”\n\nLiterally, it means “Your mother!” and is the ending of a Russian obscene phrase. But as it’s used quite often in Russia, Твою ж мать! (Tvoyu zh mat’!) has lost its negative meaning and can now be translated as “Darn it!”\n\nБегом! (Begom!) — “Run!”\n\nThis word is used when people are late and need to hurry up.\n\nДавай! Давай! (Davay! Davay!) — “Go! Go! Go!”\n\nLiterally, it means “Give! Give!” but it has another meaning depending on the context. By the way, there’s one more meaning of Давай! (Davay!) — “Let’s do it!”\n\nСчастливо! (Shchactlivo!) — “Goodbye!”\n\nThis word comes from the noun счастье (shchast’ye), which means “happiness.” So literally it means “be happy,” and is used to say “goodbye.”\n\nПошёл вон отсюда! (Poshyol von otsyuda!) — “Go away!”\n\nRussian people can use this expression when they’re really angry. Of course, people can also use it as a joke. Always mind the context and facial expression of the person saying it.\n\n2. Хождение по мукам (Khozhdeniye po mukam)— The Road to Calvary, 2017\n\nGenre: Political TV Show based on the book\n\nThis show is: Emotional; suspenseful\n\nThis Russian Netflix TV series covers the life of two sisters during political changes in 1914 through 1919. The old imperial Russia is dying, and the revolution is rising. The show is based on a book trilogy by the Russian classical author Alexey Tolstoy. The language is really literal and the dialogue is truly deep. If you enjoy solving language puzzles and trying to find the meaning underneath every phrase, this Russian Netflix series will become an exciting nut to crack. It’s best for advanced language learners or for those who want to immerse themselves in the great Russian Revolution.\n\nThe vocabulary.\n\nДа здравствует революция! (Da zdravstvuyet revolyutsiya!) — “Viva revolution”\n\nDuring revolution times, this was a popular phrase to cry out loud in the crowd.\n\nХороших снов тебе (Khoroshikh snov tebe) — “Sweet dreams to you.”\n\nThis is a really sweet phrase to say to a friend, or someone who is more than a friend. You can say it without тебе (tebe), or “to you” at the end, but this little word makes the phrase sound smarter and more intellectual. Use it. ;-)\n\nЯ хочу выпить за вашу смелость (Ya khochu vypit’ za vashu smelost’) — “I want to have a drink for your bravery.”\n\nAs you probably know, Russians rarely drink alcohol without making a toast. This is one of the ways to make a toast: Я хочу выпить за… (Ya khochu vypit’ za…), meaning “I want to have a drink for…” You can put pretty much anything after that: …ваше здоровье (…vashe zdorov’ye) meaning “…your health,” …мир во всем мире (…mir vo vsyom mire) meaning “…peace in the whole world,” …красоту женщин (…krasotu zhenshchin) meaning “…women’s beauty,” etc. Use your imagination. :-)\n\nЧем могу быть полезен? (Chem mogu byt’ polezen?) — “How can I be useful?”\n\nThis is an old-fashioned phrase used when you’ve been called by someone you don’t know. You will often hear it during this show.\n\nБарышня (baryshnya) — “young lady”\n\nThis is another old-fashioned way for older people to address a young lady. As there are many heroines in the show, you’ll hear this address pretty often.\n\nСлово хозяина – закон (Slovo khozyaina – zakon) — “The word of a host is a law.”\n\nThis is a very interesting phrase, in that you can actually change the noun хозяин (khozyain) meaning “host” for начальника (nachal’nika) or “boss,” мужа (muzha) or “husband,” and Кати (Kati) or “Katya” (a girl’s name, though you can put any name here).\n\nВы что себе позволяете? (Vy chto sebe pozvolyayete?) — “What do you think you are doing?” (What are you daring?)\n\nThis is an old-fashioned phrase to ask someone who’s acting inappropriately.\n\nЭто безобразие! (Eto bezobraziye!) — “It’s a disgrace!”\n\nFamous phrase to use in the Soviet Union to comment on anything that’s out of order or scandalous. Now it’s used very occasionally and mostly by people born in the Soviet Union.\n\nЭто издевательство! (Eto izdevatel’stvo!) — “That’s an insult/mockery!”\n\nA nice way to comment on something when you feel that someone is intentionally doing something bad.\n\nМилости прошу (Milosti proshu) — “Welcome”\n\nAn old-fashioned way to welcome someone. Though it’s old-fashioned, nowadays this expression is very popular. It’s used as a mocking or cool way to greet guests into a home.\n\n3. Спарта (Sparta)—Sparta, 2018\n\nGenre: Mystery; Thriller\n\nThis show is: Dark\n\nIn this Netflix Russian language series, a crime investigator starts to uncover the mysterious death of a young high school teacher. He finds out about a video game that all the kids in that school love to play. The more he knows about the game, the more he realizes that what happens in the game happens in real life as well… All dark fantasies become real.\n\nThis Russian Netflix series contains great vocabulary that modern teenagers use, making this one of the best Russian Netflix series for improving your informal communication skills.\n\nThe vocabulary.\n\nСамоубийство (samoubiystvo) — “suicide”\n\nAs the story takes place around the suicide of a school teacher, you’ll hear this word quite often. It’s interesting to know that “murder” is убийство (ubiystvo), so cамоубийство (samoubiystvo) can literally be translated as “self-murder.”\n\nНе перебивай (Ne perebivay) — “Don’t interrupt.”\n\nYou can tell this phrase to your friend who’s trying to say something while you’re still speaking.\n\nДа пошёл ты (Da poshyol ty!) — “F*ck you.” [Literally “You go away.”]\n\nThis is a short version of the phrase with obscene words, which is why even without obscene lexic, it still sounds harsh.\n\nДа ладно, не парься! (Da ladno, ne par’sya!) — “It’s fine, don’t worry.”\n\nThis phrase was popular when todays’ adults were teenagers. It’s still pretty commonly used between friends.\n\nМне б твои проблемы (Mne b tvoi problemy) — “I’d love to have your problems.”\n\nThis means that your problems are very small compared to mine, so I’d gladly switch them. This is a great and very common phrase, so don’t hesitate to use it in a friendly conversation.\n\nЧё смотрим? (Chyo smotrim?) — “Stop staring.” [Literally “Why are you looking?”]\n\nThis is a rude question to ask, and it may result in a conflict.\n\nБританские учёные доказали, что… (Britanskiye uchyonyye dokazali, chto…) — “British scientists have proved…”\n\nYou’ll hear this phrase several times during this series. It refers to the highly valued authority of British scientists. Kids in the series use it as a joke to “prove” random facts.\n\nА чё так? (A chyo tak?) — “Why?”\n\nThis alternative of the question Почему? (Pochemu?) or “Why?” is used a lot in spoken language between friends. Try to use it in your next conversation.\n\nТянуть кота за хвост (Tyanut’ kota za khvost) — “To pull a cat by his tail.”\n\nIt means that something takes a longer time than it should.\n\nЭто в прошлом (Eto v proshlom) — “It is in the past.”\n\nYou can use this phrase to emphasize that even though you did something in the past, you’re not doing it now.\n\nThe story is about modern high school students, so they use a lot of slang words and abbreviations. We’ve prepared an awesome article on this topic for you.\n\n4. Троцкий (Trotsky)—Trotsky, 2017\n\nGenre: Political drama\n\nThis show is: Cerebral\n\nThis is a great Russian period drama Netflix currently has. Lev Trotskiy was a powerful political figure.
