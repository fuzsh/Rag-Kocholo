        "text": "When I first moved to Brazil, I lived with 8 students from the local university. One of the first things my roommate did to welcome me to the house was show me how to switch on the old television in our room.Â\n\nHe told me that I would have to learn some Portuguese to get by, and then he told me that a friend of his family had learned Portuguese entirely by watching old soap operas. She became fluent just by watching TV.Â\n\nThereâs some disagreement about whether watching Netflix or YouTube videos is an effective way to learn English. Some people actually say you canât learn a language just from television.Â\n\nI donât quite agree.Â\n\nSure, itâs usually done as a super passive learning activity, which makes it less effective. But I think if you do it properly, watching TV and movies can be a useful part of a home English learning course.\n\nOne of the big questions, though, is should you use subtitles when youâre watching? Is it useful for learning English? Or is it kind of âcheatingâ yourself out of the learning experience?Â\n\nThatâs the subject this article will tackle: if you should ever use subtitles in your native language, when you should use subtitles, and how you should use them to learn most effectively.\n\nSubtitles in your native language wonât help you learn English\n\nSome people think that watching a film with subtitles in their native language will help them learn. The idea is that you can hear the English word and pair it with the word in your native language. The result is that you learn the word.\n\nIn theory thatâs a good ideaâ¦ but the evidence suggests that it doesnât work well. It might actually harm your progress in English actually harm your English.Â\n\nWhy is this?\n\nIn short, itâs because your brain looks for the easiest way to process information. Since itâs much easier to read in your language than listen to English, you wonât listen, youâll just read. And you wonât learn English.\n\nThat doesnât mean you should never use subtitles in your language!Â\n\nIf you just want to enjoy the TV show and donât want a language lesson, then, by all means, use subtitles in your language.\n\nJust know that itâs not an effective way to improve your English.\n\nBenefits of using English subtitles to learn English\n\nIt turns out there are real benefits to using English subtitles if youâre learning English.Â\n\nLanguage benefits\n\nSeveral research studies have found that using subtitles can be an effective learning tool and can support development of language skills.Â\n\nWhy?Â\n\nThereâs a step when weâre beginning to learn a language where we train our brains to âpairâ what a word looks like with what it sounds like.Â\n\nThis is an important stepâit helps us develop the right âvoiceâ in our head for the language. It helps us understand the pronunciation of words and figure out where one word ends and another begins.Â\n\nReading subtitles while you listen to audio can help you do that eye-ear training.Â\n\nSubtitles also help us learn English by:\n\nIncreasing reading speed and comprehension\n\nIncreasing familiarity with vocabulary and the sounds of a language\n\nExpanding our vocabulary\n\nImproving word recognition and grammar\n\nYou can get these benefits both when youâre watching a film with subtitles in English, as well as when youâre listening to a podcast and reading transcripts, or even listening to an audiobook while you read the actual text.Â\n\nEnjoyment benefits\n\nAnother consideration is whether you understand the narrative of the film or TV show without the subtitlesâand whether that bothers you.\n\nIâve said before that one of the most important things in learning a language is finding activities you like. If you do things you like, youâll stick with them even when theyâre hard.\n\nThis is, of course, why my roommateâs family friend learned Portuguese from soap operasâeven without subtitles. She just liked watching them so much that she would watch them even if she didnât understand the words. And she would watch them a lot.Â\n\nThat gave her tonnes of language input.\n\nBecause she spent so much time engaged with Portuguese, the language eventually came to her.Â\n\nNot everyone would be like this lady, though. For some people, if you canât follow the narrative, youâll find it boring and youâll stop watching.Â\n\nThat's the second benefit of subtitles: they can help you understand enough that youâll enjoy the show, even if you donât catch every word. And if you enjoy what youâre watching, youâll keep watching it.Â\n\nSubtitles are most useful when youâre a beginner or lower intermediate\n\nWhile using English subtitles can be a great support at lower levels, itâs usefulness declines as your level improves.Â\n\nThe idea is that, to get better, you need to challenge yourself.Â\n\nThereâs a concept in psychology that we apply to learning called the âzone of proximal developmentâ. The idea is you will learn best when what you're doing is slightly more difficult than whatâs comfortableâbut itâs not too difficult.Â\n\nIf your task is too hard, you wonât learn much and you might give up. If itâs too easy, you also wonât learn anything. Effective learning happens at the sweet spot in the middle.Â\n\nThat concept can be applied to subtitles. If watching a movie in English without subtitles is too difficult, subtitles can bring it back into that zone of proximal development where effective learning happens.Â\n\nBut if using subtitles is too easy, itâll fall out of the zone again. At that point, youâll learn more by getting rid of the subtitles.Â\n\nSo, should I use subtitles to learn English?\n\nIt depends.\n\nDonât use subtitles in your native language to learn English\n\nItâs not an effective language learning activity.Â\n\nIf itâs too hard for you to understand a TV show even by using English subtitles, I would switch to language activities aimed at lower levels. For ideas, check out our guides on English listening activities and reading in Englishâboth have lots of ideas for activities you can do as a beginner.Â\n\nBut, if you can understand this article, you are probably at a high enough level that you can use English subtitles.Â\n\nAgain, though, feel free to watch with subtitles in your native language if youâre not trying to learn English and you just want to enjoy a film!\n\nUse subtitles in English when you canât understand it otherwise\n\nUsing English subtitles is really effective for people at lower levels.Â\n\nHere are some signs that you should use English subtitles:\n\nWithout them, you wouldnât be able to follow the narrative.\n\nWithout them, watching the show becomes an annoying task and you stop enjoying it.\n\nYou find it difficult to know where one word starts and the other one ends.\n\nYou can understand English well, but the characters in this particular film or series use an unfamiliar accent and itâs hard to follow.\n\nIn those cases, feel free to use subtitles and enjoy your show.Â\n\nHow to make the best use of subtitles to learn English\n\nOkay, so youâve decided that using subtitles is useful for you at your level. Whatâs the best way to use them?\n\nTry not to just read the words. Itâs hard, but as much as you can, listen to the actual language itself. Use the subtitles as a crutch: look down if you need them, rather than just reading them.\n\nBreak your watching into chunks. Learning English is hard and takes effort. It can be a bit overwhelming to do a lot at once. Help yourself out by giving yourself breaks if you need them.\n\nRewatch your films or movies. You may even choose to watch a TV show once without subtitles and then again with them. This will let you notice the language as a whole the first time, and then focus on words and meaning the second time.\n\nShadow the speech. Shadowing is repeating speech out loud as you hear it. Itâs a great way to practise the physical aspects of fluency and itâs easy to do with subtitles turned on. Itâs tiring thoughâyou might not want to do it for more than five minutes or so, and itâs more effective to shadow something that is audio-only, such as a podcast.Â\n\nNote interesting words, phrases, or grammatical expressions. See a word you havenât heard before? Make a note of it or put it into your vocabulary app. This will help you actively build your vocabulary and language skills.Â\n\nAlternate between using them and not. Some films or shows are easier than others: a cartoon might be easy, but a film with strong regional accents might be harder. Turn your subtitles on or off depending on the difficulty level of the content youâre watching.Â\n\nListening to podcasts with subtitles or transcripts\n\nJust like with TV and film, subtitles and transcripts can be a great way to boost your learning from English podcasts. Theyâre effective for the same reasons noted above: they give you eye-ear training and help you get a feel for the language.Â\n\nIn some ways, using subtitles with podcasts is actually better than using them for TV or movies:\n\nSince podcasts are only audio, you donât have to watch the screen. That makes it easier to look away from your subtitles and refer to them only when you need to.Â\n\nYou can focus entirely on the spoken language, there are no distracting visual stimuli.\n\nSome podcasts, like the one we make at Leonardo English, let you tap on a word to get a definition.\n\nTheyâre easy to use with other activities like shadowing.Â\n\nHow do I get subtitles on my content?\n\nOkay, youâre all ready to go! But how do you actually get subtitles?\n\nHere are instructions for subtitles on Netflix.\n\nYou can also use this extension to get subtitles in two languages at once. The extension comes with a built-in dictionary.\n\nHere are instructions for getting subtitles on YouTube videos.\n\nFor podcasts, choose English podcasts that come with transcripts or have subtitles included. (The English Learning for Curious Minds podcast offers subtitles and transcripts to members, and also the harder words are explained for you).Â\n\nStop using subtitles in English when youâre ready\n\nSubtitles are like stabilisers (or âtraining wheelsâ, as we say in Canada) for a bike. Theyâre supports to help you do the task.Â\n\nBut you'll have to get rid of them at some point.Â\n\nIt can feel a bit scary when you do get rid of them, but eventually, you wonât feel like you need them anymore.Â\n\nYouâll make watching Netflix, YouTube, films, and television a more effective English learning activity at higher levels if you drop the subtitles.Â\n\nIf you can watch an episode or film and follow the story without subtitles, you can probably stop using them.Â\n\nYou still might not catch every word, but chances are that you figure them out in the context.Â\n\nSome questions you might ask yourself to help you decide when you donât need them anymore include:\n\nCan I understand > 90% of the story without them?\n\nDo I still enjoy watching the show without them?\n\nAm I looking for a more challenging English activity?\n\nIf your answer to those questions is âyesâ, then it might be time to try to turn off the subtitles.\n\nThe takeaway: use subtitles in Englishâuntil you donât need them\n\nEnglish subtitles can be effective as a learning support for your English listening activities. Use them if you need to.Â\n\nBut remember that, eventually, your goal is to get to a place where you donât need them. So when you can, try to transition away from them.\n\nIn general, itâs best to avoid using subtitles in your own language if your goal is to learn English. Itâs just not very effective. But, if your goal is to relax and watch a film, go for it.Â\n\nIf you spend enough time listening to Englishâwith subtitles or without themâyou might find yourself in a similar position to my Brazilian roommateâs family friend: fluent from just watching TV.Â\n\nReferences\n\nMitterer, H., & McQueen, J.
