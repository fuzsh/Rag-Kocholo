In practice, you would probably match the tense of the question.\n\nFriend: Did you enjoy yourself last night?\n\nYou: Yes, I saw Black Panther, and it was great.\n\nFriend: What do you think about Black Panther\n\nYou: It's a great movie.\n\nIf you are talking about the movie say \"It is great\". If you are talking about your night out say \"It was great\"."
