Through the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, they may pursue an undergraduate minor in Russian language, literature, and culture; bachelor's degree in Russian; and master's and doctoral degrees in Slavic languages and literatures. Students may also emphasize Russian studies in undergraduate and graduate-level degree programs in anthropology, business, comparative literature, economics, history, law, natural resources, political science, public policy, and sociology.\n\nCourses\n\nEach year the University of Michigan offers over 60 courses on Russian culture, economics, film, history, language, literature, politics, and society. For offerings in specific terms, see CREES courses.\n\nStudy Abroad: Through the Center for Global and Intercultural Study, U-M students can earn in-residence credit for semester- or academic-year study with the Middlebury College program (Moscow, Yaroslavl, and Irkutsk), and CIEE (St. Petersburg).\n\nGifts to the CREES Endowment will support Russia-focused courses, lectures, conferences, film screenings, and other programs, as well as student awards for research and internships in Russia. Please review the various options for making a gift.\n\nFor more information, contact Marysia Ostafin by email (mostafin@umich.edu) or phone (734.647.2237)."
