Be it Bollywood superstars Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif starrer 'Tiger 3'; Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone starrer 'Pathaan', South idol Vikram's Tamil movie 'Cobra', Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgn's 'Runway 34' and many others.The trend is set to grow significantly in Russia due to the increasing popularity of Indian web series dubbed in Russian language, the advancements in cinematic technologies, and the rising demand for co-productions between both countries.\"These factors are poised to enhance collaborations between Indian and Russian producers and filmmakers. Both nations rich cinematic heritage and liking have transcended language and cultural barriers, and this love affair shows no signs of fading away,\" Kotwani underscored.\n\nhttps://sputniknews.in/20240427/moscow-film-delegations-visit-to-india-sets-stage-for-movie-collaboration-7229080.html\n\nindia\n\nvladivostok\n\nrussia\n\nSputnik India\n\nfeedback.hindi@sputniknews.com\n\n+74956456601\n\nMIA „Rossiya Segodnya“\n\n2024\n\nSangeeta Yadav\n\nhttps://cdn1.img.sputniknews.in/img/07e6/0c/0f/110602_0:0:641:640_100x100_80_0_0_c298016a79eb02ef8caa9d1f688c12a5.jpg\n\nSangeeta Yadav\n\nhttps://cdn1.img.sputniknews.in/img/07e6/0c/0f/110602_0:0:641:640_100x100_80_0_0_c298016a79eb02ef8caa9d1f688c12a5.jpg\n\nNews\n\nen_IN\n\nSputnik India\n\nfeedback.hindi@sputniknews.com\n\n+74956456601\n\nMIA „Rossiya Segodnya“\n\n1920\n\n1080\n\ntrue\n\n1920\n\n1440\n\ntrue\n\nhttps://cdn1.img.sputniknews.in/img/07e7/0a/09/4684645_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_d49975e498cebfac813761b173d6bf86.jpg\n\n1920\n\n1920\n\ntrue\n\nSputnik India\n\nfeedback.hindi@sputniknews.com\n\n+74956456601\n\nMIA „Rossiya Segodnya“\n\nSangeeta Yadav\n\nhttps://cdn1.img.sputniknews.in/img/07e6/0c/0f/110602_0:0:641:640_100x100_80_0_0_c298016a79eb02ef8caa9d1f688c12a5.jpg\n\nbollywood, indian summer film week, bollywood legend raj kapoor, cultural exchange, indian films, sita, rrr, vikram, pathaan, dilwale dulhania le jayenge, bahubali, indian cinema, daily soaps, web series, indian entertainment, dasha kotwani, director of the indian film festival in russia, indian national cultural centre ‘sita’, family dramas, romantic comedies, action films, historical epics, hollywood movies, sanctions, russia-ukraine conflict, soviet era,\n\nbollywood, indian summer film week, bollywood legend raj kapoor, cultural exchange, indian films, sita, rrr, vikram, pathaan, dilwale dulhania le jayenge, bahubali, indian cinema, daily soaps, web series, indian entertainment, dasha kotwani, director of the indian film festival in russia, indian national cultural centre ‘sita’, family dramas, romantic comedies, action films, historical epics, hollywood movies, sanctions, russia-ukraine conflict, soviet era,\n\nRussia Rekindles Love for Bollywood with 'Indian Summer' Film Week\n\n© SUJIT JAISWALBollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan gestures during an event to celebrate the success of his Indian Hindi-language action thriller film ‘Jawan’ in Mumbai on September 15, 2023.\n\n© SUJIT JAISWAL\n\nSangeeta Yadav\n\nIndian movies have captivating the hearts of millions of Russian fans since the enchanting era of late Bollywood legend Raj Kapoor whose movies 'Mera Naam Joker', 'Awaara' and 'Shree 420' resonated with the audience and paved the way for a rich cultural exchange."
