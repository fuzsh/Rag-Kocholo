        "text": "Is there one European cinema or several national ones?\n\nWim Wenders: European cinema is luckily not just one but it is composed of many voices and these voices have something in common that we proudly call European cinema.\n\nA lot of people over the years have asked the question \"does it exist or isn't it just the sum of all the national cinemas?\" - It is more than the sum. The sum is already quite a lot but European cinema is much more with its language of its own with its own rules and its own history. A very distinct language...that Hollywood learned a lot from over the years.\n\nHow can we promote national films from one country to another?\n\nWe see the incredible richness of films out there, and we see how little they travel. Every year it's less. And it is not because people don't like it. Once you show people these movies they are flabbergastered, they are astonished, but they don't get to see them.\n\nThe audience is there, it is just that the chances to see these movies are diminished.\n\nEuropean Parliament's LUX Prize is one out of many good initiatives. If you look at each country you realise there is a lots of programmes lots of activities lots of different ideas.\n\nIs language an obstacle?\n\nLanguage is always a problem. I hate to speak of it as a problem because I see it as a privilege that we can make movies in different languages. Language is both the wealth and the handicap of European cinema but we have to look at it as handicap to overcome and a handicap that is worth so much and that is in the end much more worth than it is a problem.\n\nWhat about \"cinema literacy\" and teaching film in schools...\n\nWe are missing the chance to teach kids that there is a whole different language that they can learn and that they need in order not to be victims of fast food.\n\nWhen kids start with a certain food and they like it, they stick to it. We have to teach them there is other food out there. It is for their own good. We are not forcing them, they can later on go to see any movie they like. We are the last who want to impose any quotas. Everything is out there, they will see eventually anyway. But it would be a shame if they completely lost the taste and the chance to learn that there are films about their neighbours, that there is another kind of cinema that is very different, and in a different way much more fun.\n\nKids are exposed to no other language more frequently than the audiovisual language and it is the only one they are completely unprepared for. It is not just cinema, it is games, it is television, it is internet it is a language and it can be taught.\n\nScandinavia is leading, Denmark is way ahead. And it shows how successful it can be. The percentage of audiences for European films in Scandinavia is much higher than anywhere else, because they started to teach and kids know there is something else out there.\n\nWhat is the difference between European and American film?\n\nEuropean films have a tradition of being very specific, you find few European films that take place nowhere or anywhere. They take place in a certain location, they have a certain language. They are located in a specific place. Most American films are located in unspecific places, they like to appeal to an audience where it doesn't matter where it takes place. And I think it's good for kids to learn that films can be specific and that they can talk of real things, and not only imaginary places."
