        "text": "The movies entered the language very early, before World War I, at a time when your ticket entitled you to see a large number of works lasting only a few minutes each.\n\nAnd even when works got longer, the multiple bill persisted. Well into my childhood in the 1950s and 60s, what you expected to see when you went to \"the movies\" was several pieces: two or three trailers for coming attractions, a \"short subject\" of five or ten minutes, a newsreel (but these were being superseded by TV news), and one or two cartoons before you got to the \"feature\" film.\n\nThe multiple bill has mostly vanished today, but the phrase lingers.\n\nThe movies is an idiomatic expression to say the cinema or cinema.\n\nLet's go to the movies.\n\nI've always wanted to work in the movies.\n\nWoods means \"an area of trees, smaller than a forest.\"\n\nLet's take a walk in the woods.\n\nYou cannot generalize and say that \"the [plural word]\" is always and idiomatic expression."
