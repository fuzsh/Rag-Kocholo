        "text": "Let’s start our lesson on Russian alphabet pronunciation with vowels. Though there are ten vowel letters, there are six vowels in the Russian language. Why is that? Because there are four pairs:\n\nА - Я (A - Ya)\n\nО - Ё (O - Yo)\n\nЭ - Е (E - Ye)\n\nУ - Ю (U - Yu)\n\nAs you can see, the second letter in the pair sounds the same. This Й (Y) sound in the beginning simply shows that this letter will make the preceding consonant soft.\n\nNow let’s learn proper English to Russian pronunciation:\n\nA is pronounced as Ah.\n\nКамера (Kamera) — “Camera”\n\nCад (Sad) — “Garden”\n\nO is pronounced as “o” in the word “more.”\n\nОн (On) — “He”\n\nДом (Dom) — “House”\n\nЭ is pronounced as “e” in the word “pet” or “met.“\n\nЭто (Eto) — “This”\n\nКаратэ (Karate) — “Karate”\n\nУ is pronounced as “oo” in the word “wood.“\n\nПуля (Pulya) — “Bullet”\n\nСтул (Stul) — “Chair”\n\nSo, we have А (A), О (O), Э (E), У (U) vowels. What are the other two?\n\nЫ (Y)and И (I)make their own special pair as they sound similar, and И (I)also makes the preceding consonant soft.\n\nИ is pronounced as “ie” in the word “field” or “ee” in the word “keep.”\n\nМир (Mir) — “World”\n\nКит (Kit) — “Whale”\n\nThe Ы sound makes the previous consonant hard. There’s an English equivalent in an American accent, such as in the words “will,”\"frill,” and “really,” if you prolong the vowel in here.\n\nМышь (Mysh’) — “Mouse”\n\nСын (Syn) — “Son”\n\nМыло (Mylo) —”Soap”\n\nUseful facts.\n\nAs you’ve probably noticed, Russians usually write Й and Ы with the same transcription (Y). It’s easy to tell them apart:\n\nЫ isn’t used at the beginning of the word.\n\nYozh is a transcription for Ёж — “Hedgehog.”\n\nЙ is never used after consonants.\n\nRyba is a transcription for Рыба — “Fish.”\n\nListen to our audio on Russian vowels pronunciation for more practice. Hearing from a native is essential in mastering pronunciation for Russian learners!\n\n1- Stressed and Unstressed Syllables\n\nEvery Russian word has one stressed syllable. All other syllables—if there are any—are unstressed. So, what does that actually mean?\n\nThe thing is that in the stressed syllable, the vowel sounds loud and clear. In the unstressed syllable, exactly the same vowel sounds less clear, reduced, or even more like another vowel. This is why it’s important to learn which syllables are stressed, and not stressed, in every Russian word.\n\nIn Russian dictionaries, word stress is marked with an accent sign above the vowel. For example, и́мя (imya)which means “name.” By the way, if the word consists of only one syllable, then this syllable will be a stressed one.\n\nSo, let’s remember a couple of easy rules of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables:\n\n1. A (A) and O (O) Before a Stressed Vowel or Beginning a Word\n\nIf the unstressed syllable with А (A) and О (O) vowels stands right before the stressed one, or if the word starts with the letters А (A) or О (O), they sound like А (A). But there’s a difference between stressed and unstressed А (A): The unstressed one is shorter.\n\nТрава́ (Trava) — “Grass”\n\nThe unstressed syllable with А (A)stands before the stressed syllable.\n\nСосна́ (Sosna) — “Pine tree”\n\nThe unstressed syllable with О (O)stands before the stressed syllable.\n\nОкно́ (Okno) — “Window”\n\nThe word starts with О (O). It doesn’t matter if this syllable stands before the stressed one or not.\n\nОстанови́ть (Ostanovit’) — “Stop”\n\nThe first О (O) stands at the beginning of the word, which is why it’s pronounced as А (A). The second О (O) is in the unstressed syllable right before the stressed one, which is why it’s also pronounced as А (A).\n\nInteresting fact!\n\nThe type of pronunciation when unstressed О (O)is pronounced as А (A),according to the rules above, is called акание (akaniye), or”pronouncing A” in English. People who live in the capital of Russia—Moscow—pronounce А (A)very clearly.\n\nOn the other hand, people who live in southern Russian regions and in small villages keep pronouncing О (O)without changing it into А (A). This type of pronunciation is called окание (оkaniye), or”pronouncing O.”\n\nSo, be aware and change О (O) into А (A) so that you don’t sound too provincial.😄\n\nThere’s only one exception to this rule. If the unstressed vowels А (A) and О (O)stand after Ж (Zh) and Ш (Sh) consonants and before soft consonants, then they sound somewhere between the Э (E) and Ы (Y) sounds:\n\nЛо́шади (Loshadi) — “Horses”\n\nЖале́ть (Zhalet’) — “To regret”\n\n2. Other Unstressed Syllables\n\nIn other unstressed syllables, vowels А (A) and О (O) will sound like А (A),with a little bit of the Ы (Y)sound:\n\nЗолото́й (Zolotoy) — “Golden”\n\nШко́ла (Shkola) — “School”\n\n3. A (A), E (Ye), and Я (Ya) After Soft Consonants & Before Stressed One\n\nAfter soft consonants, in the syllable right before the stressed one, the letters А (A), Е (Ye), Я (Ya)are pronounced with the sound between Э (E) and И (I):\n\nЧасы (Chasy) — “Watches” or “Clock”\n\nПеро (Pero) — “Feather”\n\nПяти (Pyati) — “Five” in Genitive case\n\nIn other unstressed syllables, letters А (A), Е (Ye), Я (Ya)are pronounced as a short И (I).\n\n4. Vowel И (I)\n\nThe vowel И (I)after hard consonants, after a preposition, or when the two words are pronounced together, is pronounced as Ы (Y):\n\nПединститут (Pedinstitut) — “Pedagogical institute”\n\nК Ивану (K Ivanu) — “To Ivan”\n\nСмех и слёзы(Smekh i slyozy) — “Laughter and tears”\n\nPlease note that if you put a pause and don’t pronounce the words together, then И (I)doesn’t change into Ы (Y):\n\ncмех [pause] и слёзы(smekh i slyozy) — “Laughter and tears”\n\n2- Е and Ё Pronunciation\n\nWhile learning Russian, you’ll probably notice that in some texts, exactly the same word can be written with either Е (Ye)or Ё (Yo). So, what the heck is happening and why do Russians make the language harder than it already is?\n\nFirst, you should know that originally such words are written with Ё (Yo). So, when the word is written with Е (Ye),you should still pronounce it as if there was an Ё (Yo) instead. The thing is that some Russian linguists fight for removing the letter Ё (Yo) from the Russian language; other Russian linguists fight for leaving it in.\n\nFor the time being, the letter Ё (Yo)is always printed in all words in children’s books, junior school textbooks, and textbooks for Russian language-learners (yes, that’s you!). But in all other cases, it’s not an obligation to use it. How do people understand whether it’s Е (Ye)or Ё (Yo)? Well, the only way is to learn these words.\n\nOf course, there are tricky cases when the same written words with Е (Ye)and Ё (Yo)have different meanings. For example:\n\nВсе (Vse) — “Everyone”\n\nВсё (Vsyo) — “Everything”\n\nНебо (Nebo) — “Sky”\n\nНёбо (Nyobo) — “Palate” (the upper part in the mouth)\n\nThe only way to understand how to read this word properly is to look at the context.\n\nLike Russian vowels, Russian consonants also form pairs of voiced and unvoiced ones:\n\nБ - П (B - P)\n\nВ - Ф (V - F)\n\nГ - К (G - K)\n\nД - Т (D - T)\n\nЖ - Ш (Zh - Sh)\n\nЗ - С (Z - S)\n\nWhy is it important to remember these consonants in pairs? There’s a little rule. When a voiced consonant gets to the end of the word, it becomes gets unvoiced (sounds like beheaded, right?). Look at the examples:\n\nКод (Kod) — “Code”\n\nЛоб (Lob) — “Forehead”\n\nThere are also four unpaired voiced consonants:\n\nЛ (L)\n\nМ (M)\n\nН (N)\n\nР (R)\n\nAnd there are four unpaired unvoiced consonants:\n\nX (Kh)\n\nЦ (Ts)\n\nЧ (Ch)\n\nЩ (Shch)\n\nListen to our audio to hear one more time about Russian consonants and to practice them.\n\n1- Soft and Hard Consonants\n\nLearning the difference between soft and hard consonants is vital in mastering pronunciation in Russian grammar.\n\nThe consonants Й (Y), Ч (Ch), and Щ (Shch) are always soft.\n\nThe consonants Ж (Zh), Ш (Sh), and Ц (Ts) are always hard.\n\nAll other consonants can be either hard or soft, depending on the letter after it. In transcription, the softness of the vowel is shown with an apostrophe (‘).\n\nLet’s practice the pronunciation. Repeat after me, changing the consonants from hard to soft:\n\nЛ (L) - Ль (L’)\n\nМ (M) - Мь (M’)\n\nН (N) - Нь (N’)\n\nX (Kh) - Xь (Kh’)\n\nГ (G) - Гь (G’)\n\nК (K) - Кь (K’)\n\nВ (V) - Вь (V’)\n\nФ (F) - Фь (F’)\n\nБ (B) - Бь (B’)\n\nП (P) - Пь (P’)\n\nД (D) - Дь (D’)\n\nТ (T) - Ть (T’)\n\nЗ (Z) - Зь (Z’)\n\nС (S) - Сь (S’)\n\nSo, if the letters are written basically the same way, how do you recognize when they’re soft and when they’re hard? It’s easy.\n\nIf the letter Ь is after the consonant, then it’s soft. The letter Ь isn’t pronounced; its sole duty is only to notify about the softness of the consonant before it.\n\nIf the letters Я (Ya), Е (E), Ё (Yo),Ю (Yu), and И (I)areafter the consonant, then it’s also soft.\n\n2- Russian Hard Sign (Ъ) and Soft Sign (Ь)\n\nAs we said above, the letter Ь doesn’t have any sound and shows the softness of the consonant before it. For example:\n\nРоль (Rol’) — “Role”\n\nКонь (Kon’) — “Male horse”\n\nThe letter Ъ is used rarely and shows the hardness of the consonant before it. So, even if the consonant is followed by the letters Я (Ya), Е (Ye), Ё (Yo), Ю (Yu), or И (I), it will still read hard. Keep in mind that Ъ is only put after prefixes. Here are the examples:\n\nОбъект (Ob’yekt) — “Object”\n\nПодъезд (Pod’yezd) — “Entrance”\n\n3- Pronunciation of Russian Rs\n\nOkay, we’re finally here. The sound that the Russian language is famous for. It’s called the “alveolar trill.” If your native language doesn’t naturally have this sound or a similar one, it will be an adventure to master it. Let’s get started!\n\nLet the air pass between the alveolar ridge and your relaxed tongue. The alveolar ridge is that hill on the upper part of your mouth where you put your tongue when saying “t” or “d.”\n\nThat’s it! You’ve just finished reading everything you need to know about basic pronunciation in Russian language. Listen to our audio about Russian pronunciation rules for better understanding, and try our pronunciation quiz.😉\n\nProper pronunciation is important, very important. Some say it’s even more important than getting the grammar perfectly correct! Why would this be?\n\n1) Good Understanding\n\nIf communicating with native speakers matters to you when learning Russian, you need to be understood when you talk, and you need to be able to understand the native speakers. After all, without understanding, the purpose of language is null and void! In order to be understood, you need to be able to speak the language in a way that is familiar to native speakers, or at least recognizable by them.\n\nWhen learning to speak a new language, you will learn that the more you progress the more intricate it becomes! For instance, almost every language has vocabulary that may look the same in writing, but because the words are pronounced differently, they have very different meanings. This means that you may say a word in Russian, and because of a slight change in pronunciation, the meaning of the word changes completely. Understandably, this can make for pretty embarrassing situations! At worst, your mispronounced Russian will sound garbled to a native speaker.\n\nKnowing the nuances of how a word or letter is pronounced will also help you to understand spoken Russian better.\n\nNo worries if this feels hard; you’re learning, and with our help at RussianPod101, you will not have a problem with mispronunciation if you follow our advice and examples carefully.\n\n2) Good Communication\n\nNot pronouncing Russian or any other language correctly can lead to a lot of frustration because you’re unable to express what you mean, and you will not be understood correctly. Even if you have total knowledge of Russian grammar, and can write it like a native, not knowing how to speak it properly will only make for very frustrating communication all around.\n\n3) A Good Impression\n\nEven if you’re only a beginner, it is possible to speak any language correctly. This way, you are bound to make a good impression on native speakers, and when you’re more fluent, you will be likely to garner a lot more respect than a fumbling newbie speaker who doesn’t care much for correct pronunciation.\n\nPeople often have a lot of patience for someone who learns to speak a new language, but native speakers are more likely to address you and engage with you in conversation if you work hard on your accent. This is simply because you’ll be able to understand one another! So, proficiency in pronunciation can mean the difference between having none or plenty of Russian speaking friends. It will also serve you well in the workplace, and make you popular with your Russian speaking managers and employers or employees.\n\nLearning to speak Russian properly is also a sign of respect for not only the language, but also the native speakers and their customs.\n\n1) Use voice recording tools to perfect your pronunciation\n\nRussianPod101 has plenty of resources to help you with your Russian pronunciation, so be sure to make thorough use of our recordings with native Russian speakers. These are available not only to demonstrate to you how you should pronounce Russian vocabulary, but also sentences and dialogues. Watch and listen to these over and over again to train your ear, and watch the teacher’s mouth as she speaks in the video lessons. Then, copy the speech as best you can. Later, you can record yourself to hear if you sound like a native speaker and compare yourself with native speakers. Great for self-motivation.\n\n2) Practice in front of the mirror.\n\nAnd see that you’re copying the correct lip and mouth movements.\n\n3) Use our RussianPod101 dictionary!\n\nUse the Russian dictionary provided by RussianPod101 to look up words and listen to the audio pronunciation. This will go a long way towards giving you an idea of how to pronounce a word or letter correctly.\n\n4) Train your ear to the language!\n\nMake an effort to listen often to Russian music and recorded books, and watch plenty of Russian movies and/or TV shows in Russian. This will train your ear to the language, and you’ll be surprised how quickly you pick up the accent. Remember, this is the way we learned to speak when we were young - mostly by listening to the adults talking, and repeating what they say!\n\n5) Practice, practice, practice…\n\nRepetition of the same thing may be boring, but in learning a new language, you’re creating new pathways in your brain. For these to remain and become habitual, you will need to repeat the correct pronunciation often.\n\n6) Make friends with a native Russian speaker.\n\nDon’t be shy to address them in Russian! Ask them to correct you when you make a pronunciation mistake - this is a wonderful way to practice and learn the language first-hand, and also to make new friends.\n\n7) Practice your pronunciation with your Russian teacher!\n\nIf you’re a serious student and don’t know where to meet native Russian speakers, consider investing in RussianPod101’s Premium PLUS plan. This means you will have your own native Russian teacher available to practice your pronunciation with, and much more! Send recordings of yourself speaking Russian and get feedback from your Russian teacher.\n\nYou made it to the conclusion. We’re so proud of you!\n\nDealing with language pronunciation—especially with the pronunciation of such an old and complicated language as Russian—is a hard, but necessary, step. Save the link to this article and come back here when you experience a problem with pronouncing a word the right way.\n\nBy the way, do you know the method for remembering things better? Use a pyramid learning trick. Reread this article in one hour, reminding yourself of the rules about Russian pronunciation. The best thing is to make notes with the main rules. Then reread your notes or an article after eight hours, after one day, after three days, after one week, after two weeks, and then reread it every two weeks, three more times.\n\nPut a reminder on your calendar. Every time, you’ll learn one-hundred percent, but your brain will store only a small part of it. Next time, you’ll put into your storage room one more part, and so on, until you finally get the full picture in your long-term memory.\n\nWe know you can do it!\n\nBut if you experience problems with self-management, break study promises, or don’t know how to organize your learning process for the long term, consider participating in our MyTeacher program for Russian learners.
