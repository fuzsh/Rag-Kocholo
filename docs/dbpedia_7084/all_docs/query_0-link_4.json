While the early Soviet movies of 1920-1950, for example: Battleship Potemkin (1925), Cossacks of Kuban (1949), are cinematographic reflections of the Soviet Propaganda, based on glorifying and white washing of everything related to the Communist ideology, they are a great source for understanding that point in time. The changes and challenges of the Soviet Society, such as industrialization, free education of the masses and granted access of the common man to the national cultural treasures, reshaped the society over time in more positive ways.\n\nThe separate place in Soviet and Russian cinematography belongs to the movies dedicated to the Great Patriotic War, known as WWII in the West, the bloodiest war in the history of mankind. Affecting every family in the Soviet Union, it claimed over 27 million lives, most of those being lost lives of the civil population due to the Nazi invasion. The heroism of the Soviet soldiers shown in the war was unparalleled, their endurance and patriotism was unsurpassed. Some examples of the earlier war movies are One-Two, Soldiers Were Going... (1977), Only Old Men Are Going to Battle (1973), They fought for their country (1975) offer a great reflection on patriotism of the soldiers. Trilogy Burnt by the Sun (1994) wins an Oscar in 1995 for the Best international film, and the Grand Prize in Cannes of 1994. It has the new take on war, where strong anti-Stalinist ideas live side by side with a sense of patriotism, hate for fascism, resilience of the Soviet people, and feelings of compassion and the eternal search of the main hero for truth. Some modern bright examples of Great Patriotic War movies, Come and see (1985), Panfiloves 28 men (2016), Battle for Sevastopol (2015), are just a few to mention. Many people find them to be so realistic and raw that they can scare the unprepared viewer by the ugliness and cruelty of war.\n\nSome modern Russian movies are dedicated to highlight many achievements of Soviet Union, such as the success in Space Programs, the great examples of those movies would be thrilling docudramas The Spacewalk (2017), Gagarin (2013), Legend 17 (2013) helps the viewer to appreciate the sports achievements of Soviet athletes during the times of the cold war. The modern thrillers in Russia Flight Crew (2016), Metro (2013) are rivals to the ones made in this same genre in the West. Caravan Hunters (2010) is a great historical movie about the Afghan War, when the Soviet Union was the first and only country fighting the modern terrorism at its roots.\n\nThe strongest side of the Russian movies, as well as the Russian literature comes from the depths of the story told in it. The main heroes often go through the personal growth, self reflection and continuous search for truth.\n\nRead also:\n\nLearn Russian By Watching Movies"
