        "text": "In June of 2024, the Carmel Institute sponsored a class-trip to Istanbul, Türkiye, for a group of students from AU, Princeton, the University of the District of Columbia, and the University of Rochester. It explored the legacy of the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantine Orthodoxy.\n\nBefore departing from the US, the students read Bettany Hughes' Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities as a general introduction to the history of the Eastern Roman Empire and its capital, Constantinople. The course combined discussions of the book with visits to churches, museums, mosques, and archaeological sites in Istanbul and beyond. In the process, students explored the history of the Byzantine Empire, the evolution of Eastern Orthodoxy, and interconfessional relations throughout the late classical, medieval, and modern era. Dr. Onur İşçi of Kadyr Has University in Istanbul also joined the group on select museum visits, guided some of the tours, participated in discussions, and gladly answered many questions while touring Istanbul."
