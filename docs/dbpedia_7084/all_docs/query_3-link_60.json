        "text": "Why is learning English so important?\n\nEnglish is the language of international communication As of 2022 English is the official language of 67 different countries and the most spoken language in the world for both native and non-native speakers. More than 1,100 million people use English every day around the globe. Being able to speak English is not just about being able to communicate with native English speakers, it is the most common second language in the world. If you want to speak to someone from another country the chances are that you will both be speaking English in order to communicate.\n\nThe British Council projected that by 2020 two billion people in the world would be studying English. Learning English is important as it allows you to communicate easily with your fellow global citizens. When you study English at ELC schools you will be making friends with people from lots of different countries, using English as your common language!\n\nEnglish is the language of business English is the dominant business language and it has almost become a necessity for people to speak English if they are to enter the global workforce. Research from all over the world shows that cross-border business communication is most often conducted in English and many international companies expect employees to be either fluent in English or at least be able to communicate effectively if English is their second language.\n\nGlobal companies such as Airbus, Daimler-Chrysler, Fast Retailing, Nokia, Renault, Samsung, SAP, Technicolor, and Microsoft in Beijing have designated English as their official corporate language. Even companies such as Rakuten, a Japanese tech conglomerate similar to Amazon and eBay, have made it compulsory for their employees in Japan to be able to speak English.\n\nThe importance of learning English in the international marketplace cannot be understated – it is the common language used by companies and businesses the world over, and vitally important if you wish to succeed in your career. Learning English really can change your life!\n\nSpeaking English gives you access to a world of entertainment Many of the world’s biggest blockbuster films, bestselling books and chart-topping music are published and produced in English. By learning English you will have access to a wealth of entertainment and will be able to have a greater cultural understanding, allowing you to enjoy your movies, novels and favourite playlists even more.\n\nIf you speak English, you won’t need to rely on translations or subtitles anymore to enjoy your favourite books, songs, films and TV shows. And don’t forget that watching movies and television programmes in English is also a fun way to learn the language!\n\nAt ELC we encourage students to participate in our social programme to practise English outside a classroom environment. Activities include watching popular English films, participating in sports, visiting art galleries and museums, as well as lots of trips and excursions to local and historical areas. The programme is designed to encourage students to use and learn English while immersing themselves in British culture.\n\nLearning English gives you access to more of the internet\n\nAccording to a report by Education First, English is the language of the internet. In 2022 it was estimated that 5 billion people – almost 65% of the world’s population – used the internet, with 170 million new users added in the last year alone. And English is the most common language online, used by 6 million of the top 10 million websites – over 60% of the entire internet’s sites.\n\nLearning English is important as it will let you enjoy over half the content on the internet. Knowing how to read English will allow you access to billions of pages of information which you otherwise would never have read or understood!\n\nThe Importance of Learning English Today Although learning English can be challenging and time-consuming, it is also a very valuable language to learn and can create many opportunities!\n\nWant some advice on fun ways to learn English? Why not check out our blog ‘Is Learning English Your Biggest Challenge Yet? These 7 tips will help you.’\n\nThe English Language Centre is a not-for-profit organisation. This means that all our profits are re-invested in the Centre, as our purpose is to provide the highest possible quality of English language teaching at our schools in Brighton, Chester and Eastbourne."
