        "text": "Russian\n\nRussia is once again at the center of world affairs, driving the largest war in Europe since 1945 and threatening global food security, while promoting anti-democratic regimes around the world. It is more important than ever for Americans to understand Russia’s culture and history, in order to build a better peace when the next chance arises. Russian majors and minor play the leading role in helping to spread such understanding throughout Tennessee and the nation.\n\nThe Russian program at the University of Tennessee fosters linguistic, historical, and cultural knowledge about Russia and its subordinate ethnic groups. In addition to offering courses on language, literature and culture, the program facilitates study abroad through any of several nationally recognized study abroad programs."
