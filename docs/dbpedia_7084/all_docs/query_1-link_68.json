        "text": "With a BA in Russian, you'll hone written and oral communication skills, as well as a deep knowledge of Russian culture, history, art, literature and politics.\n\nWe work to actively support dual-degree seekers who want to pair their knowledge of Russian with majors like international studies, international business and intercultural communications. You can even build your study of Russian culture into an honors thesis project that will allow you to graduate with distinction in the major.\n\nDU houses one of the most extensive university collections of Russian literature, and you can expand your knowledge of Russian further through DU's Russian Club and Dobro Slovo, the National Slavic Honor Society.\n\nAway from campus, immersive study abroad opportunities give you real-world experience in a country that wields enormous influence over global affairs. Because Russia is a political and economic international superpower, a thorough understanding of the language and culture means you'll have career options both at home and abroad."
