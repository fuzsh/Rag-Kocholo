        "text": "Photo credit: Siobhán Seigne\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has made the study of Russian language and culture both more difficult and more urgent than ever before. More difficult, because Russia has once again descended into a dangerous totalitarianism that threatens the peace and well-being of not only its own citizens but also the entire global order. More urgent, because there is no more important time to study Russian language and culture than now, when the need for experts on Russian politics, history, and culture is at an all-time high.\n\nThe Russian curriculum at Rochester offers students courses in beginning through advanced Russian language study, Russian current events and politics, Russian literature of the last two centuries, Russian civilization, art, architecture, and film, as well as classes focusing on Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and Nabokov.\n\nIn addition, for nearly 30 years from 1992-2019, The Department of Modern Langauges and Cultures (MLC) ran its own summer program in St. Petersburg that brought scores of Rochester students to study Russian and live with Russian host families. Because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have now begun a Russian language summer program in Tallinn, Estonia, which commenced in 2022 and will run every other year. Students live with Russian host families and study Russian from native speakers. Rochester students are eligible for Mildred R. Burton Travelling Fellowships, which for over three decades have allowed hundreds of students to study abroad in the summer.\n\nOur classes boast small faculty/student ratios and our students often pair their Russian major with other majors in the College. Our graduates are highly competitive and have gone on to work in academic positions, in international businesses, in language exchange programs, as teachers of English in Russia, with various NGOs, and as lawyers and professionals in the US.\n\nThe University of Rochester offers degrees in both Russian and Russian studies. The Russian major, minor, and clusters are in the humanities division. The Russian studies major, minor, and clusters can count in either the humanities or the social sciences.\n\nBelow is information on:\n\nRussian major requirements\n\nRussian minor requirements\n\nRussian clusters\n\nEducation abroad\n\nLanguage placement\n\nContact information\n\nRussian Major Requirements\n\nThe Russian major has a total of 10 required courses:\n\nFoundation Courses (fulfill upper level writing)\n\nCLTR 200 Topics in Critical Thinking (or approved equivalent course)\n\nCLTR 389 MLC Research Seminar (or approved equivalent course)\n\nCore Courses\n\nRUSS 202 Advanced Readings in Russian I\n\nRUSS 205 Advanced Readings in Russian II or RUSS 209 Advanced Russian through Film\n\nTwo content courses in literature, culture, or film\n\nElective Courses\n\nFour or more courses in literature, culture, film or language beyond RUSS 102.\n\nSee a complete list of Russian courses (pdf)\n\nTop ↑\n\nRussian Minor Requirements\n\nFive courses in Russian language, literature, and culture, to be selected in consultation with the Russian advisor.\n\nSee a complete list of Russian courses (pdf)\n\nTop ↑\n\nRussian Clusters\n\nThere are three Russian clusters, all in the humanities academic division.\n\nRussian Language (H1RUS007)\n\nThis cluster introduces students to basic language skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening comprehension).\n\nRussian Language and Culture (H1RUS008)\n\nThis cluster introduces students to basic language skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) as well as the cultural context for Russian, courses that explore Russian literature, art, and film.\n\nRussian Literature and Culture (H1RUS009)\n\nAn introduction to Russian culture and identity, beginning with a survey course on civilization, literature of the golden age, or art, followed by courses from the nineteenth and twentieth century literary traditions.\n\nTop ↑\n\nEducation Abroad\n\nStudents can study Russian abroad in the summer in our new program in Tallinn, Estonia, where they will live with Russian host families and study Russian from native speakers. More information can be found on the Tallinn study abroad page. Students can also study Russian abroad through programs coordinated by the Center for Education Abroad. Attend an information session or speak to a study abroad advisor to learn more.\n\nTop ↑\n\nLanguage Placement\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP) scores or International Baccalaureate (IB) rankings assist departmental advisors in finding the right course level for you. Information on how you learned the language or languages you know will also help us advise you on the most appropriate courses for you in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures.\n\nFor students with previous experience with the Russian language, the first step is to take the online placement exam. For instructions for how to login, see our online placement exam instructions page.\n\nAfter you take the test, you will receive a score that will be used along with the other information you provide to help determine your placement. A language placement advisor will email you with your official placement sometime after you take the exam. Students who have not studied Russian previously and who are not heritage speakers of Russian may register for RUSS 101 without taking a placement exam. The placement you receive with your online numerical test scores is not necessarily how you will be placed by MLC.\n\nTop ↑\n\nContact Information\n\nFor more information about Russian, contact Professor John Givens at john.givens@rochester.edu.\n\nFaculty\n\nDmitrii Bykov, Visiting Assistant Professor in Russian\n\nJohn Givens, Professor of Russian, Head of the Russian Program, Undergraduate Advisor\n\nLaura Givens, Professor of Instruction in Russian, Placement Advisor\n\nAnna Maslennikova, Professor of Instruction in Russian, Associate Director of Russian Studies\n\nRita Safariants, Assistant Professor of Russian"
