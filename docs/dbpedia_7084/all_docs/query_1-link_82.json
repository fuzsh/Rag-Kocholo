        "text": "About the Program\n\nMinor\n\nThe Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers a minor in Russian Culture. Students desiring to major with an emphasis in Russian language, literature, or culture should see the requirements for the major track in Russian/East European/Eurasian Cultures offered under the Slavic Languages and Literatures major.\n\nHeritage Speakers of Russian\n\nHeritage speakers include those who grew up in Russian-speaking families but are without a standard Russian language educational background. Heritage speakers may select any major or minor track offered by the department except the minor in Russian Language. The unit requirements are the same for all majors and minors. However, the balance between courses approved for and taken in language and literature/culture may change depending on each studentâ€™s language proficiency. The choice of specific courses in language and literature/culture for any respective major or minor track will be determined on an individual basis by the language coordinator, Oksana Willis: oksana.willis@berkeley.edu. Before enrolling in language courses and declaring a major or minor, heritage speakers are required to take a proficiency/placement test.\n\nDeclaring the Minor\n\nStudents considering a minor track involving language requirements must see the undergraduate student services adviser early on to have to have their minor study list plan reviewed and approved; referral for language proficiency screening and placement for heritage or native speakers is required. Final approval for a minor rests with the major adviser. The paperwork for the minor, called an L&S Confirmation of Minor form, is completed with the undergraduate student services adviser no later than the semester before the student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT).\n\nOther Minors offered by the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures\n\nArmenian Studies (Minor only)\n\nEast European/Eurasian Languages and/or Cultures (Minor Only)\n\nRussian Language (Minor only)\n\nRussian Literature (Minor only)\n\nSlavic Languages and Literatures (Major only)"
