        "text": "Russian language, culture, and politics play an important role beyond Central and Eastern Europe, affecting the international community as a whole. To develop an understanding of this complex country and its people, students pursuing a B.A. in Russian Language, Literature, and Culture start with intensive language study. They then build on this knowledge with diverse cultural studies, including Russian art, cinema, literature, and history. Opportunities for close relationships with acclaimed faculty and hands-on learning are at the core of this transformative experience, and allow students to develop exceptional insight into Russia and the people who reside there.\n\nBeyond our program, students benefit from the department’s close ties to the Ellison Center for Russian, East European and Central Asian Studies in the Jackson School of International Studies, as well as to local Slavic communities. They also have the opportunity to take what they learn outside the classroom, by participating in study abroad, practicing their language skills at Russian Table, or attending one of our many departmental events.\n\nAdmissions and Advising\n\nUniversity of Washington students in good academic standing may declare the major at any time by meeting with an adviser in the Humanities Academic Services Center. The Slavic Languages and Literatures Department does not offer any online majors.
