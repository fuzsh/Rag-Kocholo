We pride ourselves on the close individual attention we give to our students; this is a department where you will not get lost in the shuffle. We also believe strongly in keeping things fun. Our mission is threefold: to help our students explore Russia’s extraordinarily rich literary and cultural",

        "text": "The Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies Program explores the vast, complex, and extraordinarily diverse region that stretches from Eastern Europe and the Baltics through European Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia to Siberia and the Russian Far East. Our approach is at once intellectually adventurous and pragmatic, with a curriculum that combines an array of courses in literature, film, visual arts, music, history, politics, sociology, and environmental studies with rigorous training in the Russian language. We offer two majors:\n\nRussian, for students who want to focus primarily on language and Russian and Russophone literature and culture.\n\nRussian, East European, and Eurasian Studies, which is interdisciplinary in focus and combines extensive linguistic training with a range of content courses in the social sciences and humanities.\n\nWhile most students choose to study Russian, with careful planning it is possible to count another relevant language studied elsewhere (such as Ukrainian, Georgian, or Uzbek) toward the Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies major.\n\nA Vibrant and Tight-Knit Intellectual Community\n\nYou’ll discover a spirit of camaraderie in our department, which is small enough that you get to know all your professors well. We offer a host of opportunities that are unique to Oberlin. Many of our students live (and practice their language skills) in Allencroft, the oldest and most atmospheric dorm on campus and a vibrant hub for Russian and Russophone culture. Advanced students often help teach Winter Term Elementary Russian. Honors students work one-on-one with their professors and travel abroad to conduct library and archival research.\n\nWhile study abroad in Russia is currently suspended, we send students to such countries as Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Latvia for language study and cultural immersion. We have sponsored Winter Term trips to Hungary and the Baltics, as well as three-month internships in Estonia, Poland, Uzbekistan, and other destinations. We also offer a unique one-month summer course in the Republic of Georgia.\n\nOur students gain admission to top graduate schools, and recent grads have gone on to careers in journalism, academia, public policy, and law; one is now a park ranger, another a sommelier, a third a professional baseball scout (and yes, he played baseball in Russia!)."
