Special permission required from the professor. 1-3 credits.\n\nSCCC 353K: Siberia in the Russian Imagination\n\nFor four centuries, Siberia has been Russia's \"Wild East.\" Much more than a geographic entity, it has been a larger-than-life, romantic, mysterious Russian equivalent of the \"Wild West\" in America. Our course investigates this Siberian mystique through the prism of Russian literature, film, music, and folklore. Topics include nature and ecology, shamanism and other native traditions, the Russian conquest of Siberia, Siberian exiles from the Decembrists through the Stalin period, Old Believers and religious dissent, Russian North America and the Russian-American Company, the \"mad monk\" Rasputin and his spell, Siberian regionalism in the nineteenth century and today, and Siberia's role within the Russian Federation. Prerequisites: None. All readings in English; films are subtitled.\n\nLove, Sex, And Politics In Revolutionary Russia: Russian Modernism\n\nThe modernist period in Russia was a time of intense experimentation: cultural, sexual, and political. This course examines how Russian modernist writers portrayed the interaction of love, sex, and politics between 1900 and 1930. We will turn first to the various influences on these writers, including Western influences such as Freud and Nietzsche and native Russian ones such as the philosopher Vladimir Soloviev. Topics under consideration include redefinitions of sexuality (Russia's first gay novel, feminist novels); the Symbolist belief in the connection between life and art, particularly in the area of love (real-life love triangles and their reflections in literature); the interaction of love and politics (texts describing love during the new regime); and love in exile (Tsvetaeva, Berberova). Related films will supplement the reading. Prerequisites: None. All readings in English translation. COUNTS FOR ARTS AND SCIENCES HUMANITIES REQUIREMENT!\n\nMedieval Russian Culture\n\nLearn about medieval chant, Russian princesses, and intriguing folklore!

Prerequisites: None. All readings in English. Prerequisites: None. All readings in English. COUNTS FOR ARTS AND SCIENCES HUMANITIES REQUIREMENT!\n\nRussian Folklore and Fairytales Discover the world of Russian fairy tales and other genres of folklore, both in their original form within an oral tradition and as reworked in Russian art and literature. Learn to recognize the recurring plots, characters, and elements of folktales; distinguish among genres of folklore; and examine differences between folklore and other forms of artistic creation in composition, structure, and perspective. Readings will include comparative material from Western European folk traditions, and will also survey Slavic and Eastern European folklore beyond Russia to investigate the rich vein of vampire and werewolf stories. All readings in English translation.\n\nPrerequisites: None. COUNTS FOR ARTS AND SCIENCES HUMANITIES REQUIREMENT!\n\nIntroduction to Russian Film\n\nThe revolutionary techniques of Russian filmmakers have had a major impact on the development of world cinema. This course will consider classic works by Sergei Eisenstein (Battleship Potemkin, Alexander Nevsky) and Dziga Vertov (Man with the Movie Camera); Soviet epics (Andrei Rublëv, Rasputin); and experiments of the 1980s and post-Communist cinema (Repentance, Little Vera, Burnt by the Sun). We will place Russian film in the context of the historical events, cultural debates, and political intrigues of twentieth-century Russia. Reading for the course will draw on the theoretical writings of Russian filmmakers, the film criticism of the Russian formalist critics, and recent scholarly studies. In-class discussion will focus on the films themselves, the background reading, and issues raised during student presentations. Prerequisites: None. All readings in English; films are subtitled. COUNTS FOR ARTS AND SCIENCES HUMANITIES REQUIREMENT!\n\nRussian Literary Theory\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to some of the basic concepts that have occupied Russian theorists and that in many cases have become fundamental to literary theory worldwide. These include such ideas as art as \"infection\"; art as \"device\"; defamiliarization; laughter and carnival; the chronotope; monologic vs. dialogic discourse; primary and secondary modeling systems. Our primary concern will be with literary analysis, but we will also consider how Russian theory has contributed to and been enriched by contact with other fields, including the study of folklore, linguistics, history, and film. We will trace the continuities (and forcible breaks) of literary theory in the Soviet Union and will consider the cultural context in which these writers worked. We will also question how formalism, structuralism, and semiotics in the Soviet Union were different from their counterparts in the West. COUNTS FOR ARTS AND SCIENCES HUMANITIES REQUIREMENT!\n\nHomer in Russia The poet Homer, fabled author of the Iliad and the Odyssey, has played an important and ongoing role in Russian culture. Translating the Homeric epics, rewriting them in a Russian context, and using Homeric characters to comment on a distinctly modern and Russian reality, Russian writers seized upon Homer as a crucial instrument in discussions of Russian culture and national identity. We will study the Homeric texts and then move on to Russian authors including Gogol, Tolstoy, Brodsky, and Ulitskaya, as we delve into the understudied field of Russian reception of the Greco-Roman classical tradition.
