        "text": "The aspect: imperfective and perfective verbs\n\nWHAT IS THE \"VERBAL ASPECT\"?\n\nIn this lesson we have seen something VERY IMPORTANT regarding Russian, which we will now explain in a way that is easy to understand:\n\nIn English we can talk about imperfect actions (ongoing or not finished actions) and perfect actions (=finished actions):\n\nImperfect actions: Yesterday Anna was reading when I came home. This morning I was cooking when you called me.\n\nPerfect actions: Yesterday Anna read a book. This morning I have cooked soup.\n\nThe \"verbal aspect\" is this comparison between \"what is finished\" and \"what is happening\". Thus, we will have:\n\nImperfective aspect: when we express an imperfective (non-finished) action.\n\nPerfective aspect: when we express a perfect (finished) action.\n\nWhat is an imperfective verb? and a perfective verb?\n\nIn English, the same verb (\"to cook\") is used to express both an ongoing action (I was cooking, I have been cooking) or a finished action (I cooked, I have cooked). That is why, when learning English, we don't talk about \"verbal aspect\".\n\nIn Russian, the contrast between imperfect and perfect is expressed with two different verbs:\n\nThe imperfective verbs are those which only express imperfect actions (= ongoing and unfinished actions).\n\nThe perfective verbs are those which only express perfect actions (= finished actions).\n\nThat is why, when learning Russian we MUST take into account the concept of \"verbal aspect\".\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nImperfective: Гото́вить / Чита́ть = to cook / to read (when we talk about and ongoing/unfinished action).\n\nPerfective: Пригото́вить / Прочита́ть = to cook / to read (when we talk about an already finished action).\n\nWhen you learn a new verb, try to memorize the pair imperfective / perfective. In the vocabulary section, at the beginning of this lesson, we show you some pairs of verbs, so you start getting used to this way of learning them.\n\nWhen do we use an imperfective verb?\n\nTo explain what we usually do, repeated actions, habits, etc...\n\n...in the present\n\nЯ чита́ю ка́ждый день / Он гото́вит о́чень хорошо́ / Мы смо́трим то́лько ру́сские фи́льмы\n\nI read every day / He cooks very well / We only watch Russian movies\n\n...or in the past\n\nРа́ньше я чита́л ка́ждый день / Когда́ я жил в Росси́и, я ча́сто гото́вил суп.\n\nBefore I used to read every day / When I was living in Russia, I would often cook soup.\n\nTo explain a process while it's happening...\n\n...in the present (what are we doing?)\n\nЯ читаю (I am reading) - Он делает что-то (He is doing something) - Мы готовим ужин (We are cooking dinner)\n\n...or in the past: (what were we doing?)\n\nЯ смотре́л телеви́зор, когда́... (I was watching tv, when...) Вчера́ я чита́л рома́н (yesterday I was reading a novel).\n\nWhen do we use a perfective verb?\n\nTo explain a finished action (in Russian it is always in the past)\n\nЯ прочита́л рома́н = I have read the novel / I finished (reading) the novel.\n\nОн пригото́вил у́жин = He has cooked dinner / He finished cooking dinner.\n\nPerfective verbs don't exist in the present: when you finish something, that is already the past (even if only one second in the past)."
