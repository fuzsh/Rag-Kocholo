        "text": "For the last year, I have been watching a bunch of Russian movies on Netflix. I started doing so to make up for my indolence: my Russian language tutor – a saint – would give me piles of exercises to do for homework and, week after week, I would just kick them aside and watch Netflix instead. I would watch the same usual fare of English-language content as most UK subscribers: House of Cards, BoJack Horseman, Black Mirror. My Russian did not improve as a result.\n\nOne Sunday afternoon in 2018, feeling guilty about the twin facts that the textbook was languishing on a shelf, and that my command of Russian was still middling, I casually wrote “Russian” in Netflix's search bar. One of the things that popped up was Метод (The Method), a Russian-language 16-episode detective/splatter series vaguely inspired by American classic serial Dexter. Almost absent-mindedly, I pressed play, set the language to “Russian (original)” and the subtitles to “Russian (CC)”. I haven’t interrupted my Russian Netflix diet since.\n\nLanguage students have been watching foreign films to perfect their comprehension and vocabulary arguably since films were invented. For sure, I binge-watched many a House M.D. episode when I was learning English – swiftly progressing from using Italian subtitles, to English subtitles, to no subtitles altogether.\n\nNetflix, though, is making it simpler. Finding Russian movies online is harder than finding English-language content; finding Russian movies with Russian subtitles is daunting: a few examples pop up on YouTube, notably on channels about learning Russian. On Netflix, watching Russian films is easy – and almost all of them have subtitles in both English and Russian. The way I am doing this is watching each scene with Russian subtitles and, when I have problem understanding it, I skip ten seconds back and rewatch it with English subtitles. Then I watch it a third time, with Russian subtitles again.\n\nI am not sure whether I am doing this right – there is research suggesting that watching a movie with same-language subtitles does have a positive impact on learning, though it is an ongoing debate – but my Russian vocabulary has certainly burgeoned as a consequence of my Netflix sessions. One side effect is that, Netflix’s Russian offer being slanted towards the violent and the criminal, many of the words I am learning are things like “gun” (пистолет), “murderer” (убийца), and “motherfucker” (еб твою мать). A newly-launched series on the life of bolshevik ideologue Leon Trotsky made me add \"congress\"(съезд) and \"peasant\"(крестьянин) to the fold.\n\nBy accident or by virtue of its international reach, Netflix has managed to concoct a mechanism that works pretty well for language-learning. But the company clearly isn’t doing it on purpose. One of the series I started watching after Метод, for instance, had no Russian subtitles: the option was between Russian audio only or Russian audio and English subtitles. (That is also the default setup for Russian content on Amazon Prime Video). Unlike its tablet and desktop versions, Netflix's phone app – which I sometimes use during my commute – does not show subtitles when the show is paused, removing a useful way to check the spelling of individual words.\n\nWhen I tried to refresh my rusty French, more problems cropped up. The subtitles for Netflix French series weren’t as good as those for Russian ones – sometimes words are missing, or the captions are a shortened version of what is uttered on screen, which might work for a French TV audience who want to follow the show, but definitely does not work for diligent students of la langue.\n\nJonathan Bennett, Netflix’s director for corporate communications, confirms that people using its series to learn languages aren’t necessarily at the front of Netflix’s mind. “It’s not something we have looked in to in any detail but great to hear how this has been a good experience for you,” he tells me.\n\nIn fact, if anything, Netflix seems to be bound in the opposite direction: in 2018, it started adding English dubbing to foreign shows, bringing back a practice that was in almost absolute disuse in the English-speaking world – and which certainly doesn’t strike me as aimed at encouraging curiosity for other languages.\n\nStill, it would take relatively little for Netflix to cater to the linguist cohort: more uniformity in subtitles’ quality, maybe a tool for translating words in the subtitles more quickly, or double-language subtitling – a function currently provided by Chrome extension Tranflix.\n\nIn an interview in October 2018, Reed Hastings, Netflix's co-founder and CEO, revealed his passion for Russian cinema. “Entertainment is one of the best ways to create empathy and, when I watch Russian movies, it’s the closest I ever get to modern Russia,” he said. “I watch a bunch of Russian movies and I start to understand a lot more about Russia – [which] otherwise is a very alien society to me.”\n\nHastings is right when he says that entertainment has the power to bridge gaps between cultures – why not use Netflix to eliminate language barriers, too?\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK"
