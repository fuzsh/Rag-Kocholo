One thing is certain: if you are among the people who have embarked on learning the most beautiful of Slavic languages, it is because a challenge won't scare you off!\n\nBut how about a little playful break, which in addition would allow you to progress in Russian quickly?\n\nWe have a good tip for you!\n\nIt is certain that reading some Russian literature could be effective, but there's no way we are going to advise you to read immediately the complete works of Tolstoy, Pushkin or Dostoevsky, if Russian is a new language to you.\n\nWe also won't tell you to go on listening in loop to the discography of Red Army Hearts in its entirety. Maybe going to visit Saint Petersburg?\n\nTempting, but a trip to Russia can not be improvised overnight.\n\nSo how to work on your Russian while having fun?\n\nWhat we propose to you, is to watch movies!\n\nIndeed, cinema can be a very good medium for learning Russian.\n\nIt is sure that when we say Cinema, we tend to think Hollywood, Bollywood or French New Wave.\n\nAnd yet, the Russian audiovisual industry is full of cinematographic gold nuggets, ranging from independent film to blockbuster.\n\nSome have even been nominated or even awarded at the most important international ceremonies such as the Golden Lion, the Golden Globes or the Oscars.\n\nCompared to \"classical\" learning methods, watching movies has many advantages for smoothly speaking Russian. This activity will allow you:\n\nTo get used to Soviet sounds and Russian words, and to improve your listening comprehension\n\nTo better understand the intonations and the accent, in order to work your pronunciation\n\nImmerse yourself in Russian culture and discover Slavic customs\n\nTo learn a common Russian vocabulary, different from the language taught that is often more formal\n\nTo familiarize yourself with the country's expressions, humor and tendencies\n\nTo develop your knowledge of the history of Russia, one of the richest of these last centuries.\n\nSo, are you ready?\n\nHere are our top 10 best Russian movies.
