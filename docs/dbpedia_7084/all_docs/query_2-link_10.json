This playful film is at once a documentary of the day on the life of the Soviet Union., a document of the filming of said documentary, and a depiction of an audience watching the film.

The Overcoat VRU 302 Alexei Batalov: Russian (English subtitles) 73 min.1959. Roland Bykov delivers a moving performance as the poor degraded clerk in 18th century Russia in this version of Nikolai Gogol's famous short story.
