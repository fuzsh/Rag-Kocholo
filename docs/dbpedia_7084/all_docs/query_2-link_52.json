        "text": "Learning the Russian Language is a Fascinating Experience\n\nMost importantly, the goal of learning Russian is to help you use the new language both fluently and accurately. Thus, your teachers use the communicative approach as the most effective method during the lessons. The teacher also takes the role of coordinator in meaningful communications such as role-play, information sharing, and problem-solving. With the help of the audio-lingual as well as the direct method, you develop all four language skills. In conjunction, your teachers do not use any translations. As a result, the Russian language surrounds you completely, thus allowing you to progress more successfully.\n\nWhat to Expect?\n\nWhen you first start learning the Russian language, you build up basic grammar skills and increase your vocabulary. The teacher creates interactive classroom activities; examples being taking part in short dialogues and pair/small group work. Most importantly you can talk about your daily life, share your opinions about various subjects as well as learn how to avoid communication breakdowns. During your Russian language learning process, the attention is focused on the development of self-study across all levels. This includes work on study skills, good study habits, and self-assessments. Given these points, when the teacher pays attention to your grammar and pronunciation, the creation of a good balance between fluency and accuracy occurs. As a result, at the end of your studies, you will receive a certificate. On it, there is an evaluation of the achieved level of all four language skills: reading, listening, writing, and speaking.\n\nOur student Marianne on teaching methods and learning the Russian language at the school:\n\n“The class is designed to allow you to speak and not just to say a couple of sentences on a random topic. Certainly, the teacher gives you space and freedom to develop your ideas, respond to your classmates, and have meaningful discussions and interactions. At the same time, the teacher effectively manages the class. It was structured so that the right amount of time was dedicated to each task and the various parts of the lesson were related and followed each other logically. Above all I enjoyed the fact that there were no awkward transitions and that it felt extremely natural.”\n\nOur student Joseph on teaching methods and learning the Russian language at the school:\n\n“The program was set up very well, the professionalism of the teachers and the various methods of instruction made my short time here enjoyable and rewarding.”\n\nFind out the benefits of the communicative approach for learning the Russian language!\n\nThe biggest benefit of learning Russian with the communicative approach is that it works effectively with both types of students. For example, those who are shy and quiet, and those who are more active during the class. How would you describe yourself? No matter the answer, you will always receive positive support from the teacher. With this in mind, the teacher will encourage you and involve you in different classroom activities. Your self-confidence will grow as a result and you will use the Russian language more actively. If you feel comfortable using Russian – be a positive partner for your group-mates in various dialogues and group discussions. In conclusion, the teacher will analyze your vocabulary and will correct your grammar mistakes if necessary.\n\nLearning Russian with your teachers\n\nOne of the great values of RLA BORN is professional and charismatic teachers with a significant amount of experience! Your teacher will be an experienced native Russian-speaker who specializes in teaching Russian as a foreign language. Each teacher has earned an academic degree in education, philology, applied linguistics or pedagogy. All the teachers regularly attend professional development courses as well as training to continue their professional growth. As a result, you can expect to benefit from high teaching standards while learning the Russian language at our school.\n\nMost importantly, all our teachers are really interested in your progress! As a result, studying Russian in our school is challenging. You will get individual attention during the class as well as the individual feedback from them after weekly tests. Certainly, they will encourage you and will help to choose any book from the school’s library to practice reading skills. What is more, feel free to ask for advice on some useful websites to master your Russian language!\n\nEvaluation and assessment\n\nFirst of all, the online placement test on Russian Language Academy BORN website, as well as speaking test (except for complete beginners), helps to place you in a group according to your level. Therefore, during the interview in the office or on the phone, you can express your wishes, necessities or demands of the course. However, if you have specific special needs, you’re advised to book the individual lessons. As a result, your teachers will design a special syllabus based on your level of knowledge. In addition, regular progress tests are held to monitor your progress and success in learning the Russian language.\n\nRussian Language Academy Durbe offers General and Specialized Russian language courses of such levels:\n\nPlease note that the number of hours for each level is recommended. In short, it may vary depending on personal learning styles as well as personal language practice outside the school!"
