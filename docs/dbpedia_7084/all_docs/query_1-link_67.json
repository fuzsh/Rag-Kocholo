        "text": "According to the language catalog, The Ethnologue, Russian is the 8th most spoken language in the world. Our program will prepare you for a variety of career opportunities in tech, business, science, government, history, engineering, mathematics, music and arts, and more, and pairs well with many of these other majors.\n\nIn this program you can expect to learn the skills to speak, read, write, and understand the Russian language in ordinary living situations as well as in professional and business matters. You will develop an understanding of Russian history, periods, figures, and trends and learn about the rich Russian culture of literature, art, film and ballet.\n\nFollow Us on Instagram For News & Updates!\n\nRussian Major (BA)\n\nThere is no placement exam for Russian. If you have had Russian before coming to the University of Utah, please contact Dr. Natalya Kuznetsova, for placement within the program. Please provide the following information: Place, time, and duration of Russian study and titles of textbooks used, grammar covered, etc.\n\nChurch or Civil Service in Russian: Those who have 18-24 months of experience in Russia or Ukraine (e.g., LDS missionaries, living abroad, or military service) should begin with Russian 3060. Students may buy 16 hours of credit if they complete Russian 3060 with a B- or better. These hours fulfill the University of Utah's language requirement but do not count toward the major or minor (since they are the equivalent of first and second year). Students in this category cannot take Russian (RUSS) classes below the 3060 level.\n\nStudents are required to declare their major at least two semesters before their expected graduation date.\n\nRUSSIAN MAJOR REQUIREMENTS WLC Practicum Options\n\nNote that this plan is a prediction of courses but does not guarantee this exact availability of courses. Also note that students with prior language learning experience do not necessarily need to begin at the 1010 level and should visit our Language Placement FAQ page for questions about where to begin.\n\nStudents with advanced language skills (e.g., native speakers, heritage speakers, students who have lived for an extended period abroad) should not enroll in first, second, and some third-year courses. If you do not know what your language level is or if you think your situation justifies petitioning for an exception, contact the WLC advisors before enrolling in classes. For pedagogical reasons, the department reserves the right to remove advanced speakers who have not successfully petitioned from classes not appropriate for their language level.\n\nRussian Minor\n\nStudents are required to declare their minor at least two semesters before their expected graduation date.\n\nPlease visit our Undergraduate Advising page for more information.\n\nRussian Minor Requirements\n\nStudents with advanced language skills (e.g., native speakers, heritage speakers, students who have lived for an extended period abroad) should not enroll in first, second, and some third-year courses. If you do not know what your language level is or if you think your situation justifies petitioning for an exception, contact the WLC advisors before enrolling in classes. For pedagogical reasons, the department reserves the right to remove advanced speakers who have not successfully petitioned from classes not appropriate for their language level.\n\nInstructor (Lecturer), Russian\n\n801-587-8554\n\nelizabeth.ewaskio@utah.edu\n\nElizabeth Ewaskio (Елизавета Чарльзовна) earned a B.A. from Carleton College (2001) and an M.A. (2010) in Russian from Middlebury College.

He was born in the very heart of the country and with no doubt can be called 100% Russian.

Denis will share Russian culture and tell you everything you are interested in.

Her primary areas of research are second language phonology and second language proficiency, i.e., how do adult learners acquire the sounds of a second language and how does language acquisition progress over time. She is the author of Coding the Hypothetical (Benjamins, 1998), and the editor of Papers for Christina E. Kramer on the Occasion of Her Retirement (Balkanistica, 2018) and Russia in Asia: Imaginations, Interactions, and Realities (Routledge, forthcoming) as well as numerous articles in both Slavic and general linguistics journals. Since 2014 she has worked with the Utah State Board of Education to develop and deliver Russian in the State’s Dual Language Immersion Program. She co-founded and co-directed (2012-2018) the Second Language Teaching and Research Center at the University of Utah, which recently competed successfully to become a US Department of Education Title VI Language Resource Center.\n\nAssociate Instructor, Russian\n\n801-755-5343\n\nkristen.a.hodges@gmail.com\n\nKristen Ullrich Hodges received her BA from the University of Utah and was one of the first students to receive the World Languages MA degree from the U’s Department of World Languages and Cultures. She has experience teaching Russian at the secondary level; she taught at an all-girl, public high school in Baltimore, Maryland for a year and a half. At the University of Utah she has taught second year Russian for several years. Most of her exposure to Russian life has been in the western part of Russia, so she dreams of traveling further east some day.\n\nAssistant Professor (Lecturer), Russian\n\n801-581-6005\n\nnatalya.kuznetsova@utah.edu\n\nBorn on the border between Europe and Asia in the heart of the Ural Mountains, Dr. Natalya Kuznetsova holds a PhD in Education from West Virginia University. She has been teaching foreign languages since 2005 and joined the University of Utah in 2018. At the U, she teaches courses in Advanced grammar, Russian cinema and Russian literature, supervises Russian Teaching Assistants, and advises the Russian language and culture Club. Her research interests span from various issues in Russian language pedagogy, such as high-leverage language instruction, language learning and motivation, students’ independent learning practices to bi/multilingualism (both acquired through second language studies and hereditary) and identity, and language ideology. She has a special interest in heritage language learning and language learning in immersion contexts. In her teaching she tries to help learners shape their own growth not only as learners but persons and explorers of new potentials and possibilities.\n\nAssociate Instructor, Russian\n\n801-581-7561\n\nfrederickhalwhite@gmail.com\n\n(PhD, University of Southern California) is Professor of Russian and Integrated Studies at Utah Valley University and an adjunct instructor at the University of Utah.

At present, he is working on a book provisionally titled Ernest Hemingway in the Soviet Union, which concentrates on the efforts made by Soviet literary agents to interest the American author in the Soviet experiment.\n\nuvu.academia.edu/FrederickWhite"
