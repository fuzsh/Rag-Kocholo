        "text": "Departmental Office: 708 Hamilton; 212-854-3941\n\nhttp://www.columbia.edu/cu/slavic/\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies:\n\nProf. Adam Leeds, 715 Hamilton Hall; 212-854-3941; al3604@columbia.edu\n\nRussian Language Program Director:\n\nProf. Alla Smyslova, 708 Hamilton; 212-854-8155; as2157@columbia.edu\n\nThe Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures is devoted to the study of the cultures, literatures, and languages of Russia and other Slavic peoples and lands. We approach our study and teaching of these cultures with an eye to their specificity and attention to their interaction with other cultures, in history and in the contemporary global context. We focus not only on the rich literary tradition, but also on the film, theater, politics, art, music, media, religious thought, critical theory, and intellectual history of Russians and other Slavs. Our approach is interdisciplinary.\n\nStudents who take our courses have different interests. Many of our courses are taught in English with readings in English and have no prerequisites. As a consequence, our majors and concentrators are joined by students from other literature departments, by students of history and political science who have a particular interest in the Slavic region, and by others who are drawn to the subject matter for a variety of intellectual and practical reasons.\n\nWe provide instruction in Russian at all levels (beginning through very advanced), with a special course for heritage speakers. To improve the proficiency of Russian learners and speakers, we offer a number of literature and culture courses in which texts are read in the original and discussion is conducted in Russian. We offer three levels of other Slavic languages: Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Czech, Polish, and Ukrainian (with additional courses in culture in English). All language courses in the Slavic Department develop the four basic language skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and cultural understanding.\n\nOur department prides itself on the intellectual vitality of its program and on the sense of community among students and faculty. As they explore Russian and Slavic languages, literatures, and cultures, students develop not only their specific knowledge and cultural understanding, but also the capacity for critical thought, skills in analyzing literary and other texts, and the ability to express their ideas orally and in writing. Our graduates have used their knowledge and skills in different ways: graduate school, Fulbright and other fellowships, journalism, publishing, law school, NGO work, public health, government work, and politics. Our faculty is proud of its students and graduates.\n\nMajors and Concentrations\n\nGuided by the director of undergraduate studies and other faculty members, students majoring in Slavic create a program that suits their intellectual interests and academic goals. They choose from three tracks: Russian Language and Culture (for those with a strong interest in mastering the language), Russian Literature and Culture (for those who want to focus on literary and cultural studies), and Slavic Studies (a flexible regional studies major for those interested in one or more Slavic cultures). In each major, students may count related courses in other departments among their electives.\n\nIn addition to its majors, the department offers five concentrations. Three are analogous to the major tracks (Russian Language and Culture, Russian Literature and Culture, and Slavic Studies). There is also a concentration in Russian Literature that does not require language study and another concentration in Slavic Cultures that allows students to focus on a Slavic language and culture other than Russian.\n\nMotivated seniors are encouraged but not required to write a senior thesis. Those who write a thesis enroll in the Senior Seminar in the fall term and work individually with a thesis adviser. Students have written on a wide range of topics in literature, culture, media, and politics.\n\nSlavic Culture at Columbia Outside of the Classroom\n\nAll interested students are welcome to take part in departmental activities, such as conversation hours, Slavic student organizations, the department's various film series (Russian, East Central European, Central Asian, and Ukrainian), and the country's first undergraduate journal of Eastern European and Eurasian Culture, The Birch. The Slavic Department has close ties to the Harriman Institute and the East Central European Center, which sponsor lectures, symposia, performances, and conferences.\n\nStudy and Research Abroad\n\nThe department encourages its students to enrich their cultural knowledge and develop their language skills by spending a semester or summer studying in Russia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, or the countries of the former Yugoslavia. The department helps students find the program that suits their needs and interests. Undergraduates may apply to the Harriman Institute for modest scholarships for research during winter/spring breaks or the summer.\n\nAdvanced/NEWL Placement\n\nA score of 5 on the AP/NEWL Russian exam satisfies the foreign language requirement. Upon successful completion of a 3-point 3000 level (or higher) course at Columbia, the Department of Slavic Languages will award 3 points of AP credit, provided the grade in the course is a B or better. Courses taught in English may not be used to earn AP credit. No credit or placement is given for the SAT II Subject test. If you wish to continue with Russian at Columbia, you should take the departmental placement test and speak with the Russian program director prior to registration to ensure proper placement.\n\nGuidelines for all Slavic Majors and Concentrators\n\nSenior Thesis\n\nA senior thesis is not required for any Slavic major. Students who wish to undertake a thesis project should confer with the director of undergraduate studies during the registration period in April of their junior year and register to take RUSS UN3595 SENIOR SEMINAR in the fall term of their senior year. Students can opt to expand the thesis into a two-semester project register for RUSS UN3998 SUPERVISED INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH, with their thesis adviser, in the spring term of their senior year. Senior Seminar may satisfy one elective requirement; the optional second semester of thesis work adds one course to the 15 required for the major.\n\nGrading\n\nCourses in which a grade of D has been received do not count toward major or concentration requirements.\n\nMajor in Russian Language and Culture\n\nThis major is intended for students who aim to attain maximal proficiency in the Russian language. Intensive language training is complemented by an array of elective courses in Russian culture that allow students to achieve critical understanding of contemporary Russian society and of Russian-speaking communities around the world. Since this major emphasizes language acquisition, it is not appropriate for native Russian speakers.\n\nThe program of study consists of 15 courses, distributed as follows:\n\nCourse List Code Title Points RUSS UN3220LITERATURE ＆ EMPIRE (19C LIT) RUSS UN3221LIT ＆ REVOLUTION (20TH C LIT) RUSS UN3223Magical Mystery Tour: The Legacy of Old Rus' SLCL UN3001SLAVIC CULTURES RUSS GU4006Russian Religious Thought, Praxis, and Literature CLRS GU4022Russia and Asia: Orientalism, Eurasianism, Internationalism RUSS GU4107RUSS LIT/CULTR-NEW MILLENNIUM\n\nMajor in Russian Literature and Culture\n\nThe goal of this major is to make students conversant with a variety of Russian literary, historical and theoretical texts in the original, and to facilitate a critical understanding of Russian literature, culture, and society. It is addressed to students who would like to complement serious literary studies with intensive language training, and is especially suitable for those who intend to pursue an academic career in the Slavic field.\n\nThe program of study consists of 15 courses, distributed as follows:\n\nCourse List Code Title Points RUSS UN3220LITERATURE ＆ EMPIRE (19C LIT) RUSS UN3221LIT ＆ REVOLUTION (20TH C LIT) RUSS UN3223Magical Mystery Tour: The Legacy of Old Rus' SLCL UN3001SLAVIC CULTURES RUSS GU4006Russian Religious Thought, Praxis, and Literature CLRS GU4022Russia and Asia: Orientalism, Eurasianism, Internationalism RUSS GU4107RUSS LIT/CULTR-NEW MILLENNIUM\n\nStudents considering graduate study in Russian literature are strongly advised to complete four years of language training.\n\nMajor in Slavic Studies\n\nThis flexible major provides opportunities for interdisciplinary studies within the Slavic field. Students are encouraged to choose one target language (Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Czech, Polish, Russian, or Ukrainian), though there are possibilities for studying a second Slavic language as well. Generally, the major has one disciplinary focus in history, political science, economics, religion, anthropology, sociology, art, film, or music. In addition, this program allows students to focus on a particular Slavic (non-Russian) literature and culture or to do comparative studies of several Slavic literatures, including Russian. Students should plan their program with the director of undergraduate studies as early as possible, since course availability varies from year to year.\n\nThe program of study consists of 15 courses, distributed as follows:\n\nCourse List Code Title Points\n\nAltogether students should complete four courses in a single discipline, including, if appropriate, the required history or literature/culture courses.\n\nConcentration in Russian Language and Culture\n\nThis program is intended for students who aim to attain proficiency in the Russian language.
