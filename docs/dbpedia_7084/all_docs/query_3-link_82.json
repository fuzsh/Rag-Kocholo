We would say we were going to the \"show\" if we were going to a movie. Midwest USA\n\nIt is interesting, the different words for this. The word 'movie' always sounds funny to me, somehow stuck in a timewarp, like people have never moved on to talkies!\n\nBut movie, moving picture, or motion picture, is closer to the original 'kinetic/kinematic' of cinema, Kino.\n\nThe formal Icelandic word for movie is kvikmynd - dymamic/living image - as in English quick = alive. And a cinema is a kvikmyndahús.\n\nAlthough there are other quicker words like mynd (the pics), bíómynd (from the early Swedish/Danish cinema, biograf, biografteatern), so colloquially in Icelandic bíó = a cinema.\n\nSo, it is funny. Some countries involved in early filmmaking, such as Germany, France, have two words, one for the process and the place (cinema, Kino) and one for the actual product (film, in several languages),\n\nbut Swedish and Danish emphasised it being description of life, alive (Latin bio-graph), and Icelandic, which tends not to import words but to form its own - kvikmynd\n\nWhereas America also went with motion picture / movie, for the product, as well as movie theater for the place. No separation of the two parts. Well, I find it interesting, anyway.\n\nSo, in the US you go the the movies/movie theatre/show to watch a movie, in BE you go to the pictures/ the cinema to watch a film. And in Iceland you go to the bíó to watch a kvikmynd.\n\nAll different ways of looking at the same thing (excuse the pun)."
