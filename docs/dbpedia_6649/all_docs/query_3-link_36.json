        "text": "The history of boxing spans across millennia but ever wondered how it all started?Â Who invented boxing?\n\nWhen did the human race start its enthusiasm for the art of boxing and make it one of the popular sports in the modern day?\n\nFrom the earliest boxing findings in Ancient Greece to the advent of bare-knuckle boxing and the man who published the first rules for bouts, find out the origins of boxing.\n\nAncient Greece and the First Boxing Olympics\n\nThe first evidence of boxing dates back to the beginning of the Bronze Age were Sumerian artefacts were found in Iraq with etchings showing two men punching each other; similar evidence was discovered in Babylonia and Assyria.\n\nThe artefacts showed menâs fists wrapped in cloth. Similar to the way boxers wrap-up today.\n\nMoving to Ancient Greece, competitions in boxing were held for the enjoyment of the people and in 688 B.C it was introduced as an official Olympic sport.\n\nFighters used to use leather thongs to cover their hands for protection as boxing gloves were still to be invented. As youâd expect from an Ancient Grecian sport, there were no knockout rounds\n\nThere was only one winner. Two men would box and fight until the other couldnât go on.\n\nThe history of boxing shows us that the original boxing leagues didn’t have weight limits or much in the way of health and safety. This meant larger sizes could fight smaller sizes without any interference, or even mercy.\n\nIt was during these matches that the boxing stance that we all know today was introduced, with one leg forward and a lead hand up as a guard.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBloody Boxing: 3rd Century Romans\n\nWhile the Ancient Greeks had boxing down as their most injurious sports, boxing history tells us stories of the Romans developing a boxing cestus – a type of glove evident in the Roman mosaics.\n\nSometimes, these gloves had metal spikes sewn into the leather.\n\nBoxing history was a bit bloodier for the Romans.\n\nRoman boxing was gladiatorial and sporting, with soldiers often fighting for training and for fun.\n\nUsually, matches only ended with the death of the boxer that lost.\n\nChristianity became prevalent and the Roman Empire fell at that time, which then pressed pause on boxing for some time.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n18th Century London Boxing\n\nAfter Ancient Rome, the history of boxing shifts to London where bare-knuckle boxing was born.\n\nNo gloves, no tape, no hand protection – just bare knuckles and competition for money or jewels.\n\nHistory records show the very first case of bare-knuckle fighting in 1681. The 2nd Duke of Albemarle Christopher Monck put together a fight between his butler and his butcher for the entertainment of his guests.\n\nIt was 1719 when the first English bare-knuckle boxing champ was crowned.\n\nIn 1743, Jack Broughton introduced the first ruleset to protect the health and safety of the prizefighters. This is where the phrase “boxing” was coined.\n\nIt was these rules that started the 30-second rule: if the fighter is down for 30 seconds, the match ends and the winner crowned.\n\nWe still use a lot of the regulations in Broughton’s ruleset. For example…\n\nNo eye-gouging or hitting an opponent when they’re down.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n19th Century Revised Boxing Rules\n\nIn the 1800s, a gentleman named John Chambers published the Marquess of Queensbury rules. These rules are a code of generally accepted rules that boxing circles recognize the most.\n\nRules that state that boxing should only occur when both opponents are standing up in a square ring is still used today. Grappling and wrestling were forbidden and still are today.\n\nThe most significant change in boxing, though, was the introduction of the gloves. It made bouts safer, prizefighters more protected and it introduced strategy into the game.\n\nDefensive techniques were then added and boxing as we know it was born.\n\nModern Boxing Today\n\nStill a sweet science, boxing is competitive and practised in hundreds of nations around the world. It’s not just the game in the ring, either, as the Rocky franchise made Sly Stallone a legend in boxing pop culture. A film of note is ‘Raging Bull’ based on Jake La Motta where Robert De Niro won an Oscar for his portrayal.\n\nThere have been adaptations of boxing in other areas, too, and boxing has created superstars and sporting idols from Muhammad Ali to Ali Floyd “Money” Mayweather.\n\nWith increased prizes, boxing fighters can now earn millions in their ring performance. It’s come a long way since the Ancient Greek Olympics.\n\nOur passion for boxing as a human race has been alive since the bronze ageâ¦ and will continue for many millenniaÂ toÂ come.\n\nOur Best Sellers:"
