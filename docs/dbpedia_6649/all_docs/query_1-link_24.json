        "text": "This article is about titles for the original Game Boy. For other lists, see Lists of Game Boy games.\n\nThe Game Boy portable system has a library of games, which were released in plastic ROM cartridges. The Game Boy first launched in Japan on April 21, 1989, with Super Mario Land, Alleyway, Baseball, and Yakuman. For the North American launches, Tetris and Tennis were also featured, while Yakuman was never released outside of Japan. The last games to be published for the system were the Japan-only titles Shikakui Atama o Maruku Suru: Kanji no Tatsujin and Shikakui Atama o Maruku Suru: Keisan no Tatsujin, which were both released on March 30, 2001. This list is initially organized alphabetically by their English titles, or, when Japan-exclusive, their rōmaji transliterations; however, it is also possible to sort each column individually by clicking the square icon at the top of each column. The Game Boy system is not region locked, meaning that software purchased in any region can be played on any region's hardware. For Game Boy Color cartridges compatible with the original Game Boy, see those indicated in List of Game Boy Color games.\n\nThis is a sortable list of 1043 games released for the Game Boy handheld video game system, excluding any cancelled and unlicensed games.\n\nList of Game Boy games Title[1] Developer(s) Publisher(s) Release date Japan North America[2] PAL region 3 Choume no Tama: Tama and Friends – 3 Choume Obake Panic!!
