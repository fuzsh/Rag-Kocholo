        "text": "Netflix’s move into live sports continues. The streamer is weighing in to the boxing arena with a fight between heavyweight legend Mike Tyson and upstart Jake Paul.\n\nThe streamer will air the fight, which takes place at the Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday July 20.\n\nIt is the company’s latest foray into the live sports field, which launched with golf tournament The Netflix Cup and continued with tennis tournament The Netflix Slam, featuring a match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, earlier this month.\n\nThere have been reports over the last six months that Netflix was eyeing boxing as one of its next routes into sports. Boxing has previously tended to be pay-per-view but there will be no additional cost for the fight on Netflix.\n\nPaul started his boxing career in 2018 with a fight against Deji Olatunji and his professional debut was in 2020 against AnEsonGib. Over his ten professional fights, against the likes of Ryan Bourland, Andre August and Nate Diaz, he has won nine and lost only once, via a split decision against Tommy Fury.\n\nThe fight is organized by Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), which was set up by Paul and Nakisa Bidarian.\n\nTyson, meanwhile is the former undisputed world heavyweight champion and one of the most legendary boxers in the world with a 50-6 winning record. His last professional fight was in 2005 against Kevin McBride and he fought Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition match in 2020.\n\nTyson has previously spoken highly of Paul and his move into boxing, having previously started his career posting social media videos on Vine and starring in Disney Channel’s Bizaardvark.\n\n“He did more for boxing than some of the champions did,” Tyson said in the Untold: Jake Paul the Problem Child documentary. “We got to keep this guy bright because he’s going to save boxing – as long as he continues to fight. He got the light, you know what I mean? He’s touched. He got the light.”\n\nUntold: Jake Paul the Problem Child was a Netflix original documentary and one of a number of boxing projects on the service including reality series At Home with the Furys.\n\n“I’m very much looking forward to stepping into the ring with Jake Paul at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas,” said Mike Tyson. “He’s grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a ‘kid’ can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT. It’s a full circle moment that will be beyond thrilling to watch; as I started him on his boxing journey on the undercard of my fight with Roy Jones and now I plan to finish him.”\n\n“It’s crazy to think that in my second pro fight, I went viral for knocking out Nate Robinson on Mike Tyson’s undercard. Now, less than four years later, I’m stepping up to face Tyson myself to see if I have what it takes to beat one of boxing’s most notorious fighters and biggest icons,” added Jake Paul.\n\n“Within just two and a half years of founding MVP, we’re about to produce the biggest fight in history, a fight in the biggest NFL stadium in the US, broadcast live, on the biggest streaming platform in the world – a testament to all we’ve accomplished in such a short amount of time. Whether you’re tuning in on Netflix or showing out in person, whether you’re team Paul or team Tyson, or whether you’re a lifelong boxing fan or watching your first fight, you’re not going to want to miss this event. I could not be more excited to make this amazing fight available to all Netflix subscribers alongside the hardest hitter of all time, Mike Tyson, on Saturday, July 20. My sights are set on becoming a world champion, and now I have a chance to prove myself against the greatest heavyweight champion ever, the baddest man on the planet and the most dangerous boxer of all time. This will be the fight of a lifetime,” he added.\n\n“Mike Tyson is one of the biggest icons in boxing history and Jake Paul is one of the biggest disruptors in boxing history,” said Gabe Spitzer, VP, Nonfiction Sports, Netflix. “Saturday, July 20 will be pure drama in the ring in Texas. We are thrilled to partner with Most Valuable Promotions for this historic event and we can’t wait for these two to face off for fans all across the world on Netflix.”\n\n“Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson is a once in a lifetime dream matchup and I anticipate it will be the most-watched boxing event in modern boxing history,” said Nakisa Bidarian, founder of Most Valuable Promotions. “Partnering with Netflix for this deal presents an unparalleled opportunity to bring Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson to the world on an unprecedented scale and we look forward to delivering this incredible clash of two of sports biggest names. Six generations of boxing fans will have a stake in the outcome and will be able to watch an anti-hero, Jake Paul, put it all on the line against the baddest man on the planet, Mike Tyson. Thank you to Netflix for their vision and trust in MVP to put on this historic event.”\n\nTyson was represented by Andrew Ruf at Paradigm and Most Valuable Promotions and Paul by Michael B. Abramson of Solomon Ward."
