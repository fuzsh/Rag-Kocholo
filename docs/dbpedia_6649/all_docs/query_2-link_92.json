Your first time in the TOP TEN training ring will also remain unforgettable thanks to the first-class quality and elevated level of safety equipment. The pluggable frame construction is quick to set up and is stable on the floor. The training ring requires a construction area of at least 5 x 5 m and offers a secured exercise area of 4.3 x 4.3 m. Protected by 3 rubber ropes connected with rope connectors, the TOP TEN training ring creates a stylish competition feeling. Two white corners, blue and red, are part of the boxing ring’s standard equipment. Matching colored protective pads secure the corners of the ring so that you can train without worries. To protect the ground and keep the risk of injury as small as possible, tatami martial arts mats can be placed underneath.\n\nTo Product →\n\nOn the ground of facts with the TOP TEN training ring with a floor.\n\nProvide positive vibrations in your martial arts training and rely on the training ring with a floor. The 5 x 5 m ring is assembled using a transparent plug-in system. The inner part of the boxing ring is filled with sturdy wooden boards, cushioning foam panels, and a durable ring tarpaulin. Structured in this way, the ring floor eases the flow of movement perfectly and protects the athletes from injuries in the event of falls or contact with the ground. The four corners are optically divided into 2 white, one red, and one blue ring corner. Three rubber ropes are used to delimit the exercise area, connected by rope connectors to prevent slipping during combat. Like the rope tensioners, each ring corner is additionally secured with a protective pad. The TOP TEN training ring with base is suitable for professional training sessions.\n\nTo Product →\n\nThe big one among the boxing rings is the boxing ring AIBA approved with a 7.8 x 7.8 m area.\n\nCheers to the TOP TEN AIBA-approved boxing ring in a simple modular system. A colored plug-in system of the sturdy steel tubes ensures the quick assembly of the substructure with the platform. The base frame is then laid out with the floor panels, which, with their vibration-damping properties, enable the athletes to stand securely. A thin foam pad and a robust ring tarpaulin made of durable canvas complete the raised ring floor. 4 ring ropes secure the fighting area of the AIBA-approved boxing ring. For protection, 2 cable connectors are integrated on each side. True to style, the boxing ring comes with a red and blue ring corner. Corner pads and protective covers for the rope tensioners are also part of the standard safety equipment in the professional sector.\n\nTo Product →\n\nGet more out of your boxing ring with the punch bag hanger for training rings.\n\nWhile sweaty sparring is happening inside the training ring, the training continues diligently outside. As a trainer, you keep an eye on all of your protégés. The punching bag suspension is installed on a ring corner and can be equipped with a punching ball or punching bag. Up to 6 athletes can train simultaneously in the smallest spaces since all 4 corners of the ring can each be extended with a punching bag attachment. The maximum load capacity of the boom is around 60 kg. Punching and kicking techniques, which are later implemented in the training ring, can be rehearsed in advance on the sandbag without any danger. Thanks to the cross brace, the suspension is very stable and can be used to its full extent.\n\nTo Product →"
