        "text": "Format: Super Nintendo (Also on Mega Drive) Publisher: Electro Brain Developer: Sculptured Software Release year: 1993 Genre: Sports / Boxing\n\nRandomised Gaming reviewed the United Kingdom PAL release of Boxing Legends of The Ring on a PAL Super Nintendo.\n\nThe sport of Boxing has seen it's fair share of video games over the years. However few boxing games have gone on to be well remembered other than the Punch-Out series. Boxing Legends of The Ring is no exception and after just an hour of playing it, you can easily see why this is consigned to the vault of history.\n\nThe game is a bit of a licensing nightmare as the name of the game is actually using a license from “The Ring” magazine. Which I should point out is still going strong even today, as the title suggests Boxing Legends of The Ring features a number of legendary boxers. With Sugar Ray Robinson being the biggest name in the game, other included boxers are Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Jake LaMotta, Rocky Graziano, Roberto Duran, Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard & James Toney.\n\nWhile the absence of Muhammad Ali is rather noticeable this is likely due to licensing issues and the fact that he had his own named game released at around the same time.\n\nOn first impressions the graphics are pretty decent, till you notice that most of the boxers look very similar\n\nNot that it really matters to much as this is one of many sports games, that remind me why most titles in the genre sucked in the 16bit era. It's just another terrible example of how not to make a sports game and all the licenses and famous boxers it uses can't save this weak excuse for a video game.\n\nThere's no point in sugar-coating it either so I might as well just get on with the KO punch. If you were unlucky enough to purchase this game in 1993, then you had just been suckered punched by the retailer, who was robbing you blind. Curiously, I learned during my research the PAL version of the game was only released in the United Kingdom, but when you consider Germany was the only European country getting Capcom games like Final Fight 3 and Megaman X3 it's a bit of a bum deal.\n\nBoxing Legends of The Ring, is a realistic style boxing game that ends up making the game a bit to realistic so matches end up being incredibly long and boring. After the fairly decent opening introduction, where we see the faces and names of the boxing legends included. You are greeted with a rather bare bones menu screen, from the outset it's clear this game didn't have a lot of time or money spent on it.\n\nThe bland character selection screen is a no thrills affair\n\nThere are three modes in-game Exhibition, Career and Battle of the Legends, along with a selection of options, including the rather bizarre option to turn off the menu music, which is possibly the only redeeming part of the game as the music is at least half decent. Made even more odd by the fact there isn't any music that plays during a match, only menus.\n\nExhibition matches are your standard versus match affair, where you get to pick your boxer and fight either the CPU or another player. You can also change the number of rounds per match and each boxer has slightly different stats, but with no unique moves or animations for each boxer the minor changes in stats have no real effect on the outcome of the fight.\n\nAs with any boxing game you win the game by either getting a TKO by flooring your opponent three times in the same round or getting a KO which can only be done by using a power punch to floor an opponent while their health is at rock bottom. Players are limited to a maximum of three power punches which you earn after every round and for knocking down your opponent. Rounds last a total of three minutes in real time and should all rounds past without a KO then the winner is decided on a judge's decision based on a number of factors included how many punches you threw, knock downs and percentages of punches that actually hit your opponent.\n\nA rare occasion where the opponent hits the canvas\n\nThe moves list is pretty limited with only seven different standard punches available for all the characters. Fights amount to little more than you hitting the buttons in a random order and hope you land more blows than the other player. Fights are on a 2D plane, but at a slightly odd isometric camera angle, making it so you only ever see the back of one boxer. This however, limits the available dodge moves to both players as you can't move around your opponent. Resulting in you only having the option to back away from your opponent when close or block their high and low punches. Unless you want to try and push your opponent back to their corner by barging into them which leaves you wide open to any type of punch.\n\nPlayers can also Clinch, which allows you to regain health and stamina, but so too does your opponent limiting its use to desperation defence only, as otherwise it just slows down the fight.\n\nThe health and stamina systems are just two of the many problems in the game as well. Health is shown by the boxer portraits in the top left and right of the screen. As your health where's down your boxes face becomes more bruised and bloodied in the portraits, until it starts flashing to indicate they are about to go down. What's annoying is that the character sprites in the lower half of the screen have no form of damage decays, forcing the player to often look up at the characters stats while trying to dodge or throw punches at the same time. As your opponent's sprite will look as fresh as a daisy even when he is about to go down to the ground.\n\nThe clinch is a great way to heal your boxer and slow down the fight\n\nThe stamina system while a novel idea doesn't quite work, as it depletes far to quickly in-game. It's designed to make the matches more realistic ends up removing the ability to punch just as you try to throw that crucial knockout punch. The stamina system works so that every time you throw a punch it decreases and to increase you have to wait about five seconds for a slight increase to your stamina by dodging or blocking punches. While this is fine for the early rounds where you start with a full stamina bar in later rounds you often have to sit out almost an entire round to fully regain your stamina. As once your are out of stamina you have to wait for your stamina meter to refill in order to throw another punch. Problem is that in order to get enough stamina back to be able to put a good few punch combos together you will be waiting about 30 seconds.\n\nThe real killer here is that health increases at just as fast rate as stamina, which makes for some seriously frustrating moments. As you will often find in the later rounds of a match that just as you are about to lay down the KO punch you've run out of stamina and by the time you've regained it. Your opponent's health will be fully restored. This can be heart breaking as you quickly watch your opponent go from KO status, back to full health in a matter of moments, while you wait on your stamina to recharge. There is no long-term health damage over the course of the fight to make matters worse. Meaning either boxer can be restored back to full health so long as they avoid punches for long enough. The end of round breaks also heal a fair amount of both boxers health and stamina, along with getting up from the canvas after a knock down.\n\nYour stamina constantly running out every fight, is just one of the many annoying issues in game\n\nAll in all, it just becomes a hugely frustrating exercise of trying to knock out your opponent before your stamina depletes. Add to this highly defensive A.I. on the harder difficultly and no form of counter punch system, makes KO'ing or even TKO'ing your opponent next to impossible. Forcing you to go for a long haul fights and hope to win via a judge victory. This rapidly becomes very tiring and incredibly boring as the longer fights, can take up to an hour to finish.\n\nThe CPU opponents also have a somewhat limited set of combos and while punches aren't sign posted, you can work out roughly what combos they are going to do, even if it means taking the odd direct punch. Before you can work out that they are doing their two high and four low hit combo. It's a pure memory game and eagle-eyed players will soon start spotting punching patterns, the higher level opponents almost become like a turn based game as you wait for them to finish their combo before it's your turn to reply. This shows up the complete lack of a counter system which this game badly needs, as titles like Super Punch-Out included a system where certain punches would act as a counter punch if timed correctly. Which gives a far more realistic approach to boxing as it allows a skilled player to dominate another by countering their punches.\n\nThe Career mode, which is supposed to be the main mode, just makes these problems worse by giving the player a highly underpowered boxer to begin with. As you would expect from Career mode your objective is to be the best fighter in the world. However, aside from a few customisation options it's little more than an arcade mode with a few options.\n\nCustomisation options are so limited you have to wonder why the developers even bothered to add it\n\nThe fact that if you lose more than twice in career mode, you end up with a straight game over screen, doesn't give the player much room to learn. You get a choice of three preset boxing types Street, Military and Olympic each with slightly different starting stats, along with the ability to adjust the power of the various punches. Appearance wise all you can do is alter the skin colour of the preset boxer, you can't alter how his face looks or the weight category he can compete in.\n\nIt's pretty much just a ladder of opponents with the odd boxer asking for a rematch after you beat them. After every fight, you also get to increase some of your stats but that's all there is. The kicker in career mode is that if you don't pick the right starting stats for your boxer you will quickly find yourself in an unwinnable fight early on. Starting with a decent punch power and stamina set up is a must if you want to win. While there is a password after every fight, you have nowhere to train up your stats or practice your boxing before you step into the ring. Forcing you to restart the whole mode if you haven't trained your boxer right. Judging by the amount of passwords written all over the manual of our review copy by a former owner, they must also have had the same trouble. Things get a bit easier once you max out your boxer's stats, but it's a bit of a rough ride until you do.\n\nFinally there is legends of the ring mode, which is little more than an eight player tournament. Only with the restriction that CPU players are of the higher difficulty and you must go 12 rounds in each match. Fortunately, you can also choose to play as all the boxers in this mode or skip CPU only fights. As I made the mistake of watching a CPU match, only to watch the fight last 45 minutes with the defensive A.I. making it about as fun to watch as paint drying.\n\nA mind numbing example of a CPU match\n\nGraphics are above-average with well drawn sprites that show quite a bit of detail including the referee who appears at the start of every match. Problem is that there isn't many sprites, most of the opponents looks the same, there is only one referee and the end of round girl who walks across the screen during the break is the same sprite just with a colour pallet swapped. The perspective on the far boxers waist line to his chest doesn't look quite right either. The blood and sweat effects from the punches look like someone using the airbrush feature in a paint tool, with a quick flash before disappearing. Neither is helped by the lack of any damage decals to the actual character sprite.\n\nThe only effect of interest is the blackout feature which attempts to simulate the effect of a blackout just before you hit the canvas. Problem is it looks like someone got confused with the term “blackout” and instead it seems to emulate a power cut to the arena. As it causes the screen to fade to black with only your boxer visible, it quickly goes away however, if you managed to regain just a fraction of your health, without being knocked down.\n\nSomeone forgot to pay the electric bill!\n\nBoxing rings all look the same as does the background crowd, who do the usual types crowd animation of camera flashes and cheers as the fight goes on. The only real change is the placement of the HBO TV channel advertisement at the top of the arena.\n\nThe only redeeming feature of Boxing Legends of The Ring is the in-game music, which does a decent attempt at trying to prepare you for the trials ahead. Sadly it's only used on the menu screens, which is a shame as it would help make the matches a bit more bearable. The other impressive feature is the voice samples included in the game, Michael Buffer's catch phase “Let's get ready to rumble!” is heard at the start of each match. Along with the referee issuing orders to the boxers, and shouts from your boxer's coach can be heard as the fight goes on. It's just a shame there isn't that many sample and that the rest of the sound effects are terrible. There's just a handful of grunts and damage sound effects that are the same for all boxers.\n\nAgain I can't really fault the controls as they are responsive and handle well. The collision for the fights is also pretty decent and you can always tell when a punch is going to connect or not. Sadly while the basic gameplay mechanics work great and I can point to plenty of games where the controls and collision are far worse. The design of the game to go with them just doesn't work and what you have is a boring and slow experience.\n\nThe newspaper that appears after every fight in career mode keeps track of your progress\n\nThe only real fun you will likely get from the game is the two players mode. As beating your mates at any game is always fun, no matter what the game. It's also the only aspect of the game that Super Punch-Out doesn't do better, as it didn't feature a two player mode.\n\nIf you purchased Boxing Legends of The Ring back in 1993 you were anything, but a winner. The game isn't a patch on the NES release of Punch-Out and in 1994 when Super Punch-Out was finally released this game was given the knock out punch it deserved.\n\nSuper Punch-Out still remains a timeless classic, yet Boxing Legends of The Ring is just another example of a terrible 16bit era sports game that deserves never to see the light of day again. There is little to like and even less to say anything positive about, it's like the no-hoper boxer who has a shot at the title only to go down 15 seconds into the fight. Quite frankly surviving one round in real life with any of the included boxers would be more fun than playing this digital disaster.\n\nCertainly managing to play this game for more than about an hour deserves some reward in its own right. Let alone the amount of time I've had to sit through and suffer this monstrosity. To some this all up in one sentence, why are you not playing Super Punch-Out on the SNES?\n\nNow you will have to excuse me I am off to find a dust bin, as that's where this 16bit relic belongs.\n\nReview by Random Gamer Riven.\n\nTwitter: RDGamerRiven\n\nE.mail: randomgamerriven@gmail.com\n\nFollow Randomised Gaming on Tumblr, for video game, art, reviews, features, videos and more.
