        "text": "J'Marie Moore was the FIRST daughter to turn pro! Very few knew about Moore until the HYPE came out about the other daughters! Moore made a History's First!\n\nJ'Marie Moore, This is from The News and Observer Publishing Company, Raleigh, North Carolina from 27th June, 1997. The daughters of famous male boxers have arrived in the year 2000. The public first took notice to the new development in women's boxing when Laila Ali said that she was going to try her hand at boxing.\n\nFAMILY AFFAIR: Archie Moore, the world light-heavyweight champion of the '50s, is back in the ring at age 83. Moore's youngest daughter, J'Marie will make her professional debut tonight in the 2,200-seat showroom at the Tropicana Casino Resort in Atlantic City, N.J., with her legendary father in her corner. J'Marie, a 5-foot-10 1/2, 170-pounder, will fight in the women's light -heavyweight division on a non-televised card.\n\nLaila Ali made her ring debut on October 8, 1999, at the Turning Stone Casino Convention Center on the Oneida Indian Nation, in Verona, New York. Her opponent, April Fowler, was a 0-1 fighter, who worked as a waitress.\n\nShortly after Laila Ali began getting massive news media coverage world-wide, Jacqueline Frazier-Lyde who was quickly given the name of \"Sister Smoke\" by her father's rival Muhammad Ali announced her entry into women's pro boxing. She got a license, a promoter, and two trainers. An attorney by professional and a 38 year old mother of three, decided to declare war on Laila Ali.\n\nAs the media hype continued with Laila Ali and Jacqui Frazier.... news spread that we had another daughter coming on the scene! Roberto Duran (one of TL's most favorite male boxers of all time) had a 23 year old daughter who wanted to become a boxer! More on Jacqui Frazier\n\nIrichelle Duran, a bantamweight, had decided to get her share of the pie and join the ranks of Muhammad Ali's Daughter, Laila, and Joe Frazier's Daughter\n\nHer father was not speaking to her for about a week after she broke the news to him! Irichelle Duran, the daughter of Roberto Duran, made her pro debut on August 4, 2000. She fought Geradine Iglesias at the Hardrock Casino and Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Duran lost her pro debut, but has won her second professional fight, and is now 1-1-0.\n\nShortly thereafter, George Foreman's daughter, 23-year-old, Freeda Foreman decided enter the ring. Freeda was scheduled to have her pro debut on April 1st, but on March 30, she canceled out on her pro debut, due to illness.\n\nFreeda said in one interview, \"My goal is to change history and knock Laila out,\" Freeda said recently. \"It's not revenge, but the opportunity is there for me.\" Freeda's father, George Foreman is not real happy about her deciding on boxing. Freeda is a single mom with a 4-year-old child. She is signed with promoter Dan Goossen of America Presents. Foreman has not been training very long, and her father said something to the affect that his other four daughters could outbox her. Unfortunately years later Freeda ended her life by suicide.\n\nJust recently, we have a fifth daughter entering the ring. She is Swedish fighter, Maria Johansson, 34, the daughter of Ingemar \"Ingo\" Johansson, who had arrived in New York on 27th April 1959 and two months later he became the heavyweight world champion. On June 18, 2000, Father's Day,\n\nMaria Johansson had her pro debut against experienced Karrie Frye (Super-Middleweight). She lost by a four-round split decision we to Frye, bringing her record to 5-1 (4KO). Maria is now 0-1. Maria fought Karen Bill on June 18, 2000 and the fight was stopped in the second round, she is now 2-0.\n\nEliza Olson, 5'5\", 146 lbs., resides in Downey, California, won her last bout on December 19, 2001, in Oroville, California against Reyna Soriano 1-0 (1KO), and advanced her record to 5-1-0 (2 KO). Olson is now ranked #11 as a welterweight. Olson trains with one of the top boxing trainers Freddie Roach, and is managed by legendary Don Chargin.\n\nGrand-Daughter of late former Middleweight boxing champion Carl \"BoBo\" Olson, who past away 1/16/02 in Honolulu, Hawaii at age 72. Olson, who fought all the greats in a golden era of boxing, compiled a career record of 99-16-2 with 49 KOs. He retired in 1966 to live in Sacramento, Calif., for about 20 years, working for a time as a physical fitness coach in a gym and also briefly was a trainer of former junior-welterweight contender Sal Lopez Jr., older brother of Tony Lopez, the former three-time world junior-lightweight and lightweight champion.
