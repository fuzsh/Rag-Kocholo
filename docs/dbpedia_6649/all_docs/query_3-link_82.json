        "text": "In the world of boxing legends turned business tycoons, few tales pack a punch quite like that of George Foreman. Gather round, my fellow entrepreneurs, and let's dissect this heavyweight's journey to $300 million!\n\nA boxing legend, a two-time world heavyweight champion, and an Olympic gold medalist. George Foreman's not just a sporting icon; he's a business savant with his own movie coming out this year. The man they call \"Big George\" stepped into a new role as an executive producer for the sports biopic \"Big George Foreman.\" A movie that delves into Hollywood and his life. Foreman's story, from humble beginnings to grand success, is a testament to the power of hope.\n\nWatch: How did George Foreman make his fortune?\n\nThe million-dollar question: George Foreman's net worth\n\nSo, how much is George Foreman worth? As of 2023, Celebrity Net Worth pegs it at a staggering $300 million. Not bad for a guy who grew up in a poor household in Marshall, Texas, with a troubled childhood. But Foreman's journey was destined for more than hardship.\n\nBoxing royalty\n\nForeman's boxing journey began with a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Over the next decade, he conquered the boxing world, winning his first world heavyweight championship in 1973. However, the crown slipped away in the famous \"Rumble in the Jungle\" fight against Muhammad Ali in 1974. Despite setbacks, Foreman remained a force to be reckoned with.\n\nForeman took a break from boxing in 1977, embracing a new life as a born-again Christian and a preacher at his local church. It was here that he realized his knack for salesmanship. From wearing overalls to captivating passersby with tales of his boxing days, he honed his selling skills.\n\nReturn to the ring and a sizzling idea\n\nForeman's fortune took a hit due to bad investments, teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. But a chance to return to boxing as an underdog against Michael Moorer in 1994 changed everything. Foreman, with his charismatic personality, caught Moorer off guard and claimed victory.\n\nThe birth of the George Foreman Grill\n\nAfter the fight, advertising agencies clamored for Foreman's endorsements. They saw his selling prowess and proposed a joint venture to create the George Foreman Grill. Foreman had doubts, but he couldn't foresee its colossal success. From 500 to 5 million, this grill was unstoppable. By 2009, over 100 million units had been sold worldwide.\n\nHow much money did George Foreman make off his grill?\n\nThe George Foreman Grill was just the beginning. Foreman expanded into cleaning products, clothing lines, personal care products, and became a spokesperson for iconic brands from where he has earned almost half of his wealth. He's an accomplished author, a TV personality with his reality show, and a philanthropist who supports at-risk youth through his George Foreman Youth and Community Center.\n\nThe mystery shrouding the grill's earnings is part of Foreman's charm. He received a $1 million profit check in 1997, and the following year, they sold $200 million worth of grills, with Foreman pocketing around 40 percent of the profits. In total, he hauled in about $138 million from the grill deal. When the company was sold, he walked away with $137.5 million in cash and stock in 1999."
