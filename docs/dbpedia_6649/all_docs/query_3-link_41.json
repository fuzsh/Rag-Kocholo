        "text": "Our goal\n\nOur goal was to stray away from the intimidation factor of traditional fitness gyms. Whether itâs the rows and rows of confusing equipment or the lack of an inclusive, team-oriented atmosphere, we knew we wanted to create something new â a program where each daily workout was different and exhilarating, where each member could rely on personal help and direction. Most importantly, we wanted to create a place where people of different ages and skill levels become part of a close- knit community.\n\nAndrew has dedicated his entire life to boxing. While he dabbled as a mechanic for a short while, his true passion was forged through years spent as a Golden Gloves boxer, claiming the title of two-time State Champion and maintaining an undefeated record for months. Andrew has become a coach, a mentor, and single-handedly created all of the outstanding Legends Boxing workouts. Together, he and Rob are the faces behind the Legends fitness revolution. Â\n\nRob has been boxing off and on since he was a kid, introduced to the sport by a neighborhood pro. His enthusiasm has not always been limited to boxing, however, and he spent a few years playing football and paintball in his spare time. 15 years ago, he and his brother made the jump to XXI Boxing with a mutual partner. Because of its popularity and community need, it has grown into what it is today, and you can still catch Rob sparring in the ring with his brother, Andrew.\n\nWork-Life Balance\n\nThe Legends brand has created a program that nearly runs itself. With low employee counts and managers that oversee the day-to-day functions of each location, the franchise owner has greater control over the hours that he or she works each week. Experience real work-life balance with an efficient model that allows owners to work on the business rather than in the business.\n\nPrime territories\n\nNow is the perfect time to own a Legends Boxing franchise, as there is ground-floor opportunity for a proven, yet still-emerging category, and the best part is: the prime territories are still available, so you can own Legends Boxing gyms in areas that are destined to be successful.\n\nReal impact\n\nIt has become a clichÃ©, but in the case of Legends Boxing, the program really is life changing. Boxing is one of the highest calorie-burning exercises on the market, so your gymâs members will lose weight and improve their health while learning an exciting new skill. And as if thatâs not enough, the Legends program includes classes like Rock Steady, which are designed to help people with Parkinsonâs disease. Such classes have been proved to provide its members with significant benefits.\n\nEasy to follow business model\n\nThe Legends Boxing brand has âput in the hard yardsâ to ensure that the franchise owner has a spectacular fitness club that provides its members with a safe, respectful, and cutting-edge atmosphere. When you franchise with Legends, you receive a full-service real estate team, prompt turnkey construction processes, a marketing plan that quickly grows membership, ongoing training and support, and a proven business model to follow.\n\nEasy real estate\n\nAnother benefit of owning a Legends gym is the ability to build in optimal areas. Being a destination service, Legends gym locations donât have to be anchored to big-box retailers, where youâre required to pay higher rent. Instead, you can choose to build your gym in A or B strip mall locations, or choose from a broader range of real estate options available in a tight market.\n\nTurnkey Construction\n\nOnce youâre ready to build, youâll benefit from a turnkey construction process that Legends has developed specifically to make your life easier. We provide a single supplier, so that you have only one point of contact; and this supplier will see the entire process through to its completion, from manufacturing to installation. Additionally, Legends gyms are built to last, and come with an industry-leading 3-year warranty."
