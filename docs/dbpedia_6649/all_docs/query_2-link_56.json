        "text": "Mike Tyson is returning to the ring to square off against Jake Paul.\n\nThe former heavyweight champ will face the YouTube star turned professional boxer at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on July 20. The event will air on Netflix.\n\n\"Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson is a once-in-a-lifetime dream matchup and I anticipate it will be the most-watched boxing event in modern boxing history,\" Nakisha Bidarian, co-founder of Paul's Most Valuable Promotions, said in a statement.\n\nTyson had a 50-6 record with 44 knockouts during his professional career, which ended in 2005. He most recently fought in a 2020 exhibition against Roy Jones Jr. and will be 58 years old at the time of the fight when he faces the 27-year-old Paul, who is 9-1 in his boxing career.\n\nPaul fought former NBA player Nate Robinson in the undercard of the Tyson-Jones fight. Now, he will have a chance to fight the boxing legend.\n\n\"It's crazy to think that in my second pro fight I went viral for knocking out Nate Robinson on Mike Tyson's undercard,\" Paul said. \"Now, less than four years later, I'm stepping up to face Tyson myself to see if I have what it takes to beat one of boxing's most notorious fighters and biggest icons. Within just two and a half years of founding MVP, we're about to produce the biggest fight in history, a fight in the biggest NFL stadium in the U.S., broadcast live, on the biggest streaming platform in the world -- a testament to all we've accomplished in such a short amount of time.\"\n\nTyson said he is looking forward to the opportunity to \"finish\" Paul.\n\n“I’m very much looking forward to stepping into the ring with Jake Paul at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas,” Tyson said. “He’s grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a ‘kid’ can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT. It’s a full circle moment that will be beyond thrilling to watch; as I started him off on his boxing journey on the undercard of my fight with Roy Jones and now I plan to finish him.”"
