        "text": "SACRAMENTO – On Monday, May 1, the California Legislative Latino Caucus honored the Diaz Brothers of the Joel Diaz Training Camp in Indio, Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero, our state’s first Latina Chief Justice who was born and raised in Imperial County, and David Pérez-Tejada Padilla, former Baja California Congressman whose policy advocacy supports Imperial County border priorities, at the 21st Annual Latino Spirit Awards.\n\n“It is incredible to see talented homegrown leaders and our binational partners receive recognition for their groundbreaking contributions to our community, culture, and state,” congratulated Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia (D-Coachella), who participated in the ceremony. Garcia represents California’s 36th Assembly District, which comprises Imperial County and cities and communities in Riverside County and San Bernardino County.\n\nProfessional boxing champions Joel, Antonio, and Julio Diaz received the nomination for this Achievement in Athletics award from Garcia.\n\n“The Diaz Brothers are an inspiration for local youth; our aspiring champions. Joel, Antonio, and Julio have demonstrated what is possible through perseverance and hard work. Our Coachella Valley boxing heroes have expanded their vision of success to uplift our entire community and help others achieve their dreams in the ring and beyond,” said Garcia. “This annual awards ceremony allows us to spotlight trailblazers like the Diaz Brothers who embody the Latino spirit and serve as role models for our communities.”\n\nThe caucus established the Latino Spirit Awards in 2002 to coincide with our State Legislature’s acknowledgment of Cinco de Mayo. This State Capitol awards ceremony honors Latinos in various categories that range from the arts to public service and human rights. This year, the California Legislative Latino Caucus celebrates its own milestone anniversary – 50 years of leadership and policy advocacy.\n\nBiographies for Honorees:\n\nThe Diaz Brothers (Achievement in Athletics)\n\nJoel, Antonio, and Julio – the Diaz Brothers – are Mexican former professional boxers. For over 20 years, the Diaz Brothers have continuously put the Coachella Valley on the map for boxing. The Diaz Brothers come from a boxing family that produced an excellent trainer, Joel, and two world champions – Antonio and Julio – who are the first world champions from the Coachella Valley. Antonio is the former International Boxing Association light welterweight and WBO Latino light middleweight champion. Julio “The Kidd” Diaz is a former IBF Lightweight World Champion. Joel is a former IBF Intercontinental champion, and was the number one rated contender and mandatory to the WBC lightweight champion, but due to a detached retina that left him blind from one eye, Joel retired from boxing. Now retired from competing in the ring, the Diaz Brothers run their own Diaz Training Camp, led by Joel, in the Coachella Valley training many current and future champions. Their training camp also educates and trains on self-defense techniques and combat sports.\n\nChief Justice Patricia Guerrero (Achievement in Law & Public Service)\n\nChief Justice Patricia Guerrero is the 29th Chief Justice of California. She was sworn into office on January 2, 2023, making history as the first Latina to serve as California’s Chief Justice. Chief Justice Guerrero was nominated to office by Governor Gavin Newsom in August 2022. When she first joined the California Supreme Court as an associate justice in March 2022, Chief Justice Guerrero was also the first Latina to serve on the state’s high court. In her first State of the Judiciary address, Chief Justice Guerrero highlighted her commitment to a more diverse and inclusive judicial branch, as well as technology that helped preserve access to justice for Californians during the pandemic. Chief Justice Guerrero also adopted the Power of Democracy Civic Learning Initiative and has been active in the “Judges in the Classroom” civics program, which engages schools and encourages students to learn about the role of the judiciary. Prior to being elevated to the California Supreme Court, Chief Justice Guerrero served as an associate justice at the Fourth District Court of Appeal, Division One since December 2017. Before her appellate appointment, she served as a judge at the Superior Court of San Diego County from 2013 to 2017, and was the supervising judge of its Family Law Division in 2017. Chief Justice Guerrero is the daughter of Mexican immigrants and was born and raised in California’s Imperial Valley. She attended the University of California, Berkeley as an undergraduate and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Stanford Law School.\n\nDavid Pérez Tejada Padilla (Achievement in Public Service)\n\nDavid Pérez-Tejada Padilla has over 15 years of experience in public service, holding several positions at the local, state, and federal levels. As a Congressman representing the state of Baja California, he led economic development, climate change and housing initiatives. In 2016, he was honored with the Order of Merit by the Republic of Poland for strengthening the bilateral relationship and cultural ties with Mexico. In the private sector, David has held several leadership positions in business organizations on both sides of the border including the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, from which he received the Bridge Builder Award in 2022. Dedicated to promoting the CaliBaja megaregion and enhancing international relationships, he led efforts to establish the Sister City Agreement between Mexicali and Sacramento in 2013. He currently serves as Director of Binational Affairs at the State of Baja California, where he works tirelessly to relaunch the Commission of the Californias and collaborates with stakeholders on both sides of the border to boost the regional economy and spur innovation."
