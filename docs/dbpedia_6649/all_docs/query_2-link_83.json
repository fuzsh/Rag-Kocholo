        "text": "Is there a difference in how you trained in your teens versus how you train now?\n\nWhat are the 3 biggest lessons boxing has taught you in almost 20 years of doing it?\n\nWhat’s the lesson you would say to your younger self with all of the wisdom you have now?\n\nHow do you continue to keep the hunger inside of you year after year after becoming a champion?\n\nHow do you manage fear? Did you have any growing up fighting and do you have any today?\n\nWhenever you’re preparing for a fight do you ever consider the possibility of losing?\n\nWhat is the process like for you mentally and emotionally on the day you’re preparing to have a fight?\n\nHow much energy does it take from you to visualize what you’re going to do in the ring?\n\nWhen you win a fight, and you’ve prepared for months and the whole world is watching, how does it make you feel?\n\nDid you ever doubt yourself growing up?\n\nDo you have any insecurities outside of boxing?\n\nDo you ever feel pressure to make your fans from Mexico proud?\n\nWhat do you love about Mexico and Mexican people the most?\n\nWhat changed for you in boxing when you had kids?\n\nWhat is the biggest thing you learned from your grandmother, your mother and your father?\n\nHave you always had love in your heart or have you ever had anger or resentment?\n\nDid something switch in your mind when you had your daughter at 17?\n\nHow were you able to focus on your fight when you heard the news that your brother got kidnapped?\n\nWhat has being a father taught you about life?\n\nWhat has meditation done for you in preparing for your fighting?\n\nWhat is your definition of success versus greatness?\n\nHas the risk of head injury and trauma as a boxer ever worried you?\n\nWho do you think would be a harder fight for you right now, Mike Tyson or Jake Paul?\n\nWhat excites you most about business and entrepreneurship?\n\nWhat is your vision for your future after boxing?\n\nHow do people learn to believe in themselves if they don’t have it?\n\nWhen you’ve fought your final match and you’re standing in the ring as a champion years from now, what do you want your legacy to be?"
