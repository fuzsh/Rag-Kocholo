        "text": "A pretty fun little western neo-noir thriller/David Lynch reunion tour with Cage as a denim cowboy drifter who finds himself in a for-hire husband-wife murder scheme that’s drawn with such grim atmospherics and farcical crime movie coincides that passages of it sort of play like Blood Simple B-sides. This is a very Screenwriter Brain movie in that it’s quite good at setting up its central location/hook and the mechanical interlocking suspense logic of its various genre pieces (and it’s seen enough movies to know what makes for fun character personality/introductions: JT Walsh and Dennis Hopper are both having a blast, even if clearly not particularly directed just let loose lol) but as soon as it gets everything tightly into place…\n\nJohn Dahl's neo-noir thriller harkens back to a bygone age in the best way possible. This is every bit the classic film noir - if it were filmed in black and white, anyone could have believed it was from the fifties. The story starts low and draws you in - Nicolas Cage is a drifter who happens upon a job as a hitman after stumbling into a backwater bar. What follows is a game of cat and mouse as our hero struggles to stay abreast of the situation. The film benefits from an excellent quartet in the central roles - Cage, Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Boyle absolutely live and breathe their respective characters. The plot moves fast and…\n\nWould you like to be chased by JT Walsh and Dennis Hopper?\n\nI mean, being chased after one of them is bad enough, but both at the same time? If I was Nicolas Cage then no amount of cash and Lara Flynn Boyle, as nice as both of them are, would persuade me to stay within a thousand miles of Red Rock.\n\nIt's terrific seeing Walsh get as large a role as this. I think this may have been the film where I first saw him or at least started to recognise him. He may have distinguished himself in many character actor roles throughout his sadly abbreviated career, but many of those roles were still too small for a guy…\n\nRed Rock West is a 1993 crime film directed by John Dahl. The film is the second film within Dahl’s directed grouping of films, all holding noir-based themes as the hinging basis for their plot build. “Red Rock West” is considered something of a neo-western, but it’s also a neo-noir in combined application. It’s a processed plot that is a wonderful combination of plot twists and backstabbing, a proportion noir if you will, but aided by the grand western tradition of the standoff and accentuated by the lonely “one-horse” western town. Starring Nicholas Cage in something of an earlier role but still with plenty of projects under his belt, Cage plays the character of Michael Williams. Williams is the drifter…"
