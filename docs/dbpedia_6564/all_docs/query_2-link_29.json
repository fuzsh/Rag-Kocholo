There are also mandatory ongoing trainings for teammates throughout their employment to supplement and refresh skills or to update credentials.\n\nHow do I check the balance on a Kids Quest gift card?\n\nFirst, ensure that your card is the “new” version. New cards have “Gift Card” in the bottom left corner. If you have the new version, click here and type in the card number and pin. For more information on Kids Quest gift cards, visit our Gift Cards page.\n\nPricing FAQs\n\nWhat is included in the hourly price?\n\nAll of the games and kids’ activity areas in the center are included in the hourly child care fee including karaoke, large playing structure, dramatic play, video games, and more! Monthly themes and activities are also included in the hourly rate unless otherwise stated in the event details. Snacks, refreshments, and meals are available at our Quest Café for an additional charge.\n\nIs there a time limit on how long my child can stay?\n\nKids Quest is located throughout the country and complies with all local and state regulations. Please call the center directly before your visit for more information.\n\nDo I need a reservation?\n\nWe operate on a first-come-first-serve basis. Centers do get busy, so pre-registration is offered and suggested to speed up the check-in process. Reservations are only required for children’s birthday parties at Kids Quest and Cyber Quest. Please see the “Parties” tab for more information on birthday parties.\n\nLoyalty Rewards FAQs\n\nDo you have a Rewards program?\n\nYes, every guest can participate in the Loyalty Rewards program. To enroll, simply provide a valid email and gaming card number for our files at check-in. Once you enroll you can begin accruing hours. For every 15 hours, a FREE hour of time is earned at Kids Quest.\n\nDoes it cost anything to join the Loyalty Rewards program?\n\nNo, our program is absolutely free to join. You simply need a valid email address and gaming card on file. Every hour your child spends at Kids Quest is counted towards your FREE hour.\n\nAre there any other benefits to the Loyalty Rewards program?\n\nBesides earning a FREE hour of play after you accumulate 15 hours of paid play, you will be eligible for deals and offers through the program. As well as, be the first to know about exclusive center and community events.\n\nIs there a discount for multiple kids?\n\nCurrently, we offer the Loyalty Rewards program as a great way to accumulate free time at Kids Quest. Hours are accrued for all children checked into Kids Quest on the same record. Example: Adult caregiver checks in three (3) children for four (4) hours at Kids Quest, for a total of 12 hours accrued. After that visit, there are only (3) three hours to go for one FREE hour of care.\n\nThrough our Loyalty Rewards program, we do also offer various discounts each month.\n\nRegistration FAQs\n\nWhat do I need to bring for registration?\n\nYou will need a form of photo identification to check your child in and out of our facility. If it is your first visit, you can pre-register on the location page to streamline the process.\n\nWhat is the check-in/check-out process at Kids Quest?\n\nOn your first visit, you will be asked for essential information regarding pertinent health and allergies, personal photo identification, email address, gaming card information, emergency contact(s), and a café spending allowance. You will also be asked to review and sign a daily authorization form that explains Kids Quest policies and procedures. Once your child is in our system, two bar-coded labels will be issued, one for you and one for your child. These stickers must be matched and verified with a photo ID at check-out. Upon completion of check-in, a Kids Quest team member will escort your child through the safety gates to the play floor so the adventure can begin!"
