        "text": "Red Rock staff provided post-disaster services in virtually every school in Lincoln County following the devastating tornadoes of May 1999.\n\nRed Rock was awarded a contract to establish a Program for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) in Tulsa for intensive treatment of the most severely mentally ill. This program, one of the first two in Oklahoma, was a model for other areas of the state in future years. Red Rock had one of the first Program of Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) teams in the state in Tulsa, OK and provided services there from 2002-2013. In 2004, Red Rock added a PACT team in Oklahoma City and in 2006 in Shawnee. PACT is a team treatment approach designed to provide comprehensive, community-based psychiatric treatment, rehabilitation, and support to persons with serious and persistent mental illness such as schizophrenia. Among the services PACT teams provide are: case management; initial and ongoing assessments; psychiatric services; employment and housing assistance; family support and education; substance abuse services, and other services and supports critical to an individual’s ability to live successfully in the community. PACT services are available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. In FY2014, Red Rock’s PACT teams diverted from hospitalization 60 percent of persons in crisis; 91% of participants had permanent housing, and only one percent experienced arrests.\n\nIn 2001, Wrap Around Services for children and families were initiated at Red Rock West. This program involved both the provision and coordination of a full range of services needed by at-risk youth. Once again, this was a model program for other facilities to follow. SOC is designed to target high risk youth and their families to provide wraparound services to strengthen families and prevent out of home placement. In 2015, Red Rock Wrap Around has expanded to ten sites serving 20 counties.\n\nRed Rock again received a three-year accreditation from CARF in 2001; this time for 14 separate programs in 19 different offices and residential facilities. Four new programs were accredited—Intensive Family-Based Services, Prevention, Crisis Stabilization, and Detoxification.\n\nIn 2001, the town of Cordell was hit hard by a tornado and hundreds lost their homes and several injuries occurred. Red Rock worked with the City of Cordell to provide crisis related counseling to recover from the disaster.\n\nAffiliate agreements were in place with over 70 mental health and related service providers.\n\nIn 2002, West Haven Housing opened in Clinton.\n\nRed Rock North was awarded a special contract for the provision of substance abuse services to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered population in the greater Oklahoma City area.\n\nJuly 1, 2003, a merger with Chisholm Trail Counseling Center added two more counties with three outpatient offices. Both projects were legally, administratively and clinically complex in nature, and required significant collaboration between the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health, the Boards of Directors of the agencies and staff at all levels.\n\nRed Rock’s history spans four decades and represents a carefully cultivated relationship with various diverse groups and community partners. In 2003, Red Rock formed a partnership with Northcare CMHC to establish a joint-venture medication clinic and pharmacy providing services to consumers of both entities, onsite at Red Rock. This creative partnership has proven highly beneficial to consumers, serving over 4,200 individuals per month with psychotropic medications. Through this 11-year partnership, consumers have had significantly greater access to Patient Assistance Medications at no cost to the consumer. This has dramatically increased the medications available to these consumer populations and aided their treatment.\n\nIn 2008, Red Rock was one of the first CMHCs in the state to offer Telemedicine services to consumers through Medication Clinics and to become an Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) Approved Network site. Through telemedicine services, Red Rock was able to improve access to mental health consumers in areas that are underserved and without psychiatric services. An early collaboration with the Oklahoma State University medical school in Tulsa resulted in Red Rock receiving equipment to begin this vital service. The first telemedicine clinic was provided to consumers in Shawnee with the psychiatrist at the distant site located in the Oklahoma City office. Red Rock has continued to expand this service to meet the needs of their consumers who are located in rural areas. Because of this service, more consumers are able to see their psychiatrist regularly to oversee their psychiatric needs. The overall consensus and reception from the consumers have been very positive. Red Rock provides over 10,000 services per year via telemedicine and telemedicine services are available at every location.\n\nAlso in 2008, Red Rock began an Area Resource Prevention Program in Yukon. These federally funded Prevention Programs in Yukon and Clinton span 11 counties that work with community coalitions, parents, school groups, businesses, law enforcement, alcohol retailers, and other stakeholders to create sustainable and effective community partnerships aimed at reducing underage drinking and other issues related to drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nIn December 2008, Red Rock opened the doors to the new El Reno location on Highway 77. A local newspaper article called it “a state-of-the-art facility.” The move to this facility combined three previous locations into one building: El Reno Outpatient, Yukon Outpatient, and Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services in Yukon.\n\nIn August 2009, the ODMHSAS again asked Red Rock BHS to expand its unit by 30 beds to further reduce the census at Griffin Memorial Hospital. Again, Red Rock BHS responded and opened 30 more beds on October 1, 2009, offering a total of 56 Crisis Stabilization Beds to the Communities of Central and Southern Oklahoma making Red Rock one of the largest crisis units in the State of Oklahoma. The impact again helped Griffin Memorial Hospital not only reduce but cap its bed capacity at 120, stretching state dollars and assisting the Department in budget cuts that were being implemented throughout State Government at that time. Red Rock BHS Norman Crisis Unit has established an outstanding team of psychiatrists (two full-time, one part time and six contract physicians) that not only conduct evaluations of the consumers in crisis to determine if admission is needed and warranted but work with the consumers for immediate stabilization and referral. Red Rock’s leadership for the unit, psychiatrists, team of therapists, nurses and mental health tech’s have many years of experience working with this population which is illustrated by the positive consumer satisfaction surveys, the very low consumer complaints and low use of seclusion and restraints. Red Rock provides Crisis Stabilization services to almost 3,000 adults each year.\n\nIn 2009, Wrap Around services were added to Grady and Caddo County.\n\nIn March 2010, Red Rock began a fully electronic medical records system. Also in 2010, Wrap Around services were added to Oklahoma City, and Red Rock received its 6th CARF Accreditation.\n\nIn 2011, Wrap Around services began in Kingfisher County.\n\nIn September 2011, the OKC PACT team moved into 4420 N. Lincoln.\n\nIn November 2011, Red Rock signed a Management Agreement to operate Jordan’s Crossing. This facility in south Oklahoma City provides residential substance abuse treatment to women with dependent children. A few months later Red Rock took over full operations and ownership of the facility and was able to gain new funding from the ODMHSAS under the Smart on Crime Initiative and expanded the beds from 60 to 80. Later the next year, that facility received an 1.8 million dollar renovation to the facility to make it a state of art residential facility for women and children.\n\nIn 2011, Red Rock acquired property at 4130 N Lincoln Blvd and in June 2012, CQI and SOC moved into the building. Also, office space was leased at Expressions Community Center to provide behavioral health services and HIV testing to the LGBTQ population.\n\nOctober 2, 2012, Red Rock partnered with Norman Regional Hospital and opened 16 crisis unit beds on its campus, and decreased the Red Rock crisis beds at Griffin to 40.\n\nDecember 10, 2012, Founding CEO, Allyn Friedman passed away after being at the helm of Red Rock for 38 years. In January 2013, Verna Foust was named Interim CEO and on May 21st, 2013 was named CEO of Red Rock. New Chief Operating Officers were selected: Steve Norwood, COO of Specialized Services, and Dr. Wana Ellison, COO of Outpatient Services.\n\nJanuary 2013, the Red Rock Access Center opened at 4130 N Lincoln. This centralized location for all incoming calls increased the efficiency and quality of care to Red Rock consumers.\n\nJordan’s Crossing held its grand opening on February 8, 2013, and welcomed guests included Governor Mary Fallin and ODMHSAS Commissioner Terri White.\n\nIn March 2013, Red Rock Wrap Around began the Rockwell Project with the Oklahoma Department of Human Services as part of the DHS Pinnacle Plan. This project ended in 2014.\n\nAt least 24 Red Rock clinicians volunteered over 320 hours with ODMHSAS Health Response Team to provide mental health services to May 31 Moore tornado survivors.\n\nIn July of 2013, Red Rock collaborated with the ODMHSAS and the Midwest City, OK Police Department in a unique project designed to provide a cost-efficient alternative to traditional court sentencing and reduce recidivism among SMI and/or substance dependence offenders by providing appropriate treatment and supervision. Midwest City operates the largest municipal jail in Oklahoma processing over 2800 inmates per year. In the last eight months, 170 inmates have been screened, 31 were accepted in the program and 4 have graduated. All timelines and milestones have been met by successful collaboration with the agencies involved and ongoing meetings monitoring progress.\n\nRed Rock has also been the leader in Oklahoma CMHC IT systems and programs through its partnership with software industry leader, NetSmart, and with Red Rock’s capital commitments it has made to this effort. In 2013, Red Rock became the first CMHC in Oklahoma to connect to the Health Information Exchange (HIE), providing physicians and clinicians valuable health information regarding the consumer’s care at other healthcare facilities and other providers that could enhance the quality and safety of consumer care. Likewise, the HIE offers providers outside Red Rock access to information about their mental health services, if the consumer opts to allow for the distribution of this information. In addition, Red Rock was among the first CMHCs in Oklahoma to have the capacity for its psychiatrists and other prescribers to electronically prescribe consumer medications to almost any pharmacy in Oklahoma. This availability of e-prescribing, coupled with the telemedicine opportunity, opens the door widely for consumers to access and receive mental health services.\n\nRed Rock received its 7th CARF Accreditation in 2013.\n\nRed Rock celebrated its 40th birthday in 2014.\n\nJanuary 27, 2014, Red Rock began providing services to Drug Court participants in Custer and Washita Counties.\n\nIn 2014, Wrap Around services began for Kiowa and Greer Counties.\n\nIn 2014, Red Rock’s Yukon location was highlighted in the National Drug Control Strategy from President Obama to the U.S. Congress, regarding its significant collaboration and work with the local sheriff’s department.\n\nAlso in 2014, Red Rock was the first entity in the United States to receive funding from the Universal Service Administrative Company, Rural Health Care Healthcare Division – Healthcare Connect Fund. This entity is affiliated with the Federal Communications Commission in Washington D.C. This funding is for a three-year period and totals approximately $500,000. This program works in conjunction with the Oklahoma Universal Service Fund under the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. The funding is approved to begin in May 2014 through May 2017. As a leader in telehealth services in Oklahoma, Red Rock is pleased to be the first in the nation to receive this funding to aid in the service provision of telepsychiatry to our consumers.\n\nIn March 2014, Red Rock’s service area was expanded by ODMHSAS to include Kingfisher County.\n\nThe lease on the Hobart office began on March 15, 2014, and SOC began providing services in this office in April.\n\nNovember 1, 2014, Red Rock Altus opened.\n\nDecember 18, 2014, through a competitive bid process, Red Rock was awarded contracts with ODMHSAS to provide Adult and Youth Health Home services in the following counties: Oklahoma, Roger Mills, Beckham, Greer, Kiowa, Washita, Custer, Blaine, Caddo, Canadian, Grady, Garvin, Pontotoc, Seminole, Murray, Johnston, Bryan, Love, Carter, Marshall, Kingfisher, Logan, Lincoln, Pottawatomie, Jackson, Harmon, and Tillman.\n\nFebruary 3, 2015, Red Rock was awarded the Drug Court contract for South West Oklahoma (Third Judicial Court Jackson County).\n\nOn January 15, 2016, Red Rock had the Grand Opening for Planet Rock, a new state-of-the-art, trauma-informed outpatient children’s clinic at 4130 N. Lincoln Blvd. in Oklahoma City. This was Red Rock’s first separate facility for children and was considered a huge milestone. It also brought Red Rock’s first full-time child psychiatrist and with the use of telepsychiatry, would allow children all over Red Rock’s catchment area, including many rural areas to receive services.\n\nIn September of 2015, Red Rock went live with a new state-of-the-art Clinical Software, Netsmart’s MyAvatar. This was a significant accomplishment for Red Rock that took over a year of planning and implementation.\n\nIn January of 2016, Oklahoma was one of 24 states awarded a planning grant by SAMSHA to become a Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC). The ODMHSAS selected 3 CMHCs in Oklahoma to participate: Red Rock, NorthCare, and Grand Lake. After a year of the planning grant, Oklahoma was again awarded the demonstration piece along with 7 other states and the same 3 Oklahoma CMHC’s began that phase in April of 2017. The CCBHC was a part of the Excellence in Mental Health Act passed by Congress and designed to provide a comprehensive range of mental health and substance use disorder services, particularly to vulnerable individuals with the most complex needs during a federal demonstration program with participating states. After the demonstration phase, it was hoped that it would be rolled out as a national model.\n\nIn 2016, Red Rock received its 8th CARF Accreditation.\n\nStarting in 2016, Red Rock began an initiative to greatly expand the knowledge and expertise of staff in the treatment of substance use disorders. In July of 2016, Red Rock opened a Medication Assisted Treatment Program specifically to treat Opioid Use Disorders and added education and availability of Naloxone for the community. Over the course of the next year, and continuing into the future, Red Rock has a commitment to continue to expand and develop our workforce in best practices to treat co-occurring and substance use disorders.\n\nIn January of 2017, Red Rock started a new program called NAVIGATE, and national Best Practice program by SAMSHA designed for adolescents and young adults (ages 15–40) who have experienced a first episode of psychosis. The program aims to help individuals who have developed psychotic symptoms that seem consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and their families, in finding their way toward psychological and functional well-being and access to the services they need in the mental health system. NAVIGATE promotes recovery from the impact of symptoms associated with a mental illness while also improving social and academic functioning. NAVIGATE is based on the idea that recovery from a recent onset of schizophrenia is possible through the use of carefully monitored medication in combination with fully integrated psychosocial rehabilitation interventions (based on evidence-based practices such as Illness Management and Recovery and Supported Employment and Education), which incorporate skills training that fosters the development of resiliency.\n\n2017-2018 was a time of growth within Red Rock mainly driven by becoming a Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CBHC) for 3 years as part of the federal demonstration, expiring September 30, 2023. Our Service array expanded and our employees reached the highest point ever at 639.\n\nIn April of 2018, during the My Mind Matters Day at the Capitol, Red Rock was named by the Oklahoma Citizen Advocated for Recovery and Transformation Association (OCARTA) as Mental Health Center of the Year.\n\nIn March 2018, Red Rock purchased land in Weatherford Oklahoma to build a new facility to serve our clients in western Oklahoma. Groundbreaking occurred in July 2018 and construction began on an almost 24,000 square foot facility. Once construction is complete the Clinton operations and staff will move to the new facility in Weatherford.\n\nIn late 2018, Red Rock was awarded $325,000 in Opioid Flex funds to enhance telehealth capabilities for the purchase of tablets and apps to utilize as treatment extenders for clients recovering from Opioid dependence.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Red Rock began preparing to launch an IPS program. Individual Placement and Support is an outpatient program that helps individuals with mental illness obtain/maintain regular employment and/or educational goals of their preference. The official launch took place on January 7, 2019, and by spring IPS “success stories” were shared by Regional Program directors.\n\nIn late 2018 and early 2019 RR leadership was successful in advocacy efforts with state and federal Oklahoma legislators. Staff from Senator Inhofe’s office visited Red Rock central office and U.S. Representative Kendra Horn participated in a meeting with ODMHSAS commissioner Terri White, RR CEO Verna Foust, and COO Dr. Wana Ellison. Outreach was conducted, via email and phone with all of the Oklahoma Congressional delegation with Senator Cole and Senator Inhofe signing on as Co-sponsors of important federal legislation to continue the CCBHC model in Oklahoma.\n\nIn January of 2019, Red Rock’s Jordan’s Crossing site was chosen as one of only two sites statewide to receive funding to provide innovative services and supports to improve the physical and mental health of pregnant and postpartum women. 186,000 dollars will be allocated to Red Rock each fiscal year for five years.\n\nIn February 2019, Red Rock was awarded funding from the SAMHSA and the Oklahoma State Department of Education via a contract with ODMHSAS for Project AWARE in Weatherford and Elk City Systems of Care programs. The purpose of this program is to build or expand the capacity of State Educational Agencies, in partnership with State Mental Health Agencies overseeing school-aged youth and local education agencies to (1) increase awareness of mental health issues among school-aged youth; (2) provide training for school personnel and other adults who interact with school-aged youth to detect and respond to mental health issues; and (3) connect school-aged youth, who may have behavioral health issues (including serious emotional disturbance [SED] or serious mental illness [SMI]), and their families to needed services. For additional funding for the FY20 AWARE program, Weatherford awarded $44,000 and Elk City awarded $57,000.\n\nIn the spring of 2019, with support from ODMHSAS Red Rock launched a Housing First program that emphasizes housing as the foundation for an individual to begin working on their recovery goals. Housing First emphasizes client choice and Red Rock housing staff offer a variety of other supportive services to Housing First participants.\n\nThe spring of 2019 was a very busy time for Red Rock as we were on our 3-year cycle of accreditation through CARF and ODMHSAS. Both the CARF accreditation and ODMHSAS Certifications for CCBHC, CMHC, and BHH were completed with very few deficiencies. Additionally, Red Rock has been in the process of wrapping up a Risk Management needs assessment with the Oklahoma Foundation for Medical Quality. Red Rock spent much of 2018 and early 2019 collaborating with Afia Health, a healthcare Information Technology consulting firm to Afia to focus on process improvement with key areas of revenue cycle and service utilization. Red Rock is changing our culture to be data-driven, moving from “I feel” to “I know”.\n\nIn May 2019, Red Rock was awarded a new contract to start a Diabetes Self-Management (DSM) program in Lincoln County with the goal of rolling out the model to other counties in late FY2020. $5,000 per fiscal year flex funding is provided to buy materials to help consumers improve the tracking and management of their diabetes and overall health. Red Rock nursing staff, among others, will be trained in the DSM curriculum from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\n\nIn June of 2019, the State Plan Amendment (SPA) for Mental Health Services at the Oklahoma Health Care Authority was updated to allow CCBHC model of services to be provided by both providers currently in the CCBHC demonstration project as well as other Community Mental Health Centers.\n\nIn late August 2019, Red Rock was awarded a 3-year Rural Community Opioid Response Program (RCORP) grant by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Grant funding is for Red Rock and 3 other consortium members to provide Opioid use prevention and treatment services in Beckham, Blaine, Custer and Washita counties. Other consortium members include the Department of Human Services offices in the rural service area, Southwestern Oklahoma State University department of Psychology and the Prevention division from the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. Total funding for 3 years is 1 million dollars to implement a set of evidence-based interventions and promising practices that align with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Service’s Five-Point Strategy to Combat the Opioid Crisis. Strategies include hosting town halls, community chats, various evidence-based trainings and screenings and other prevention programs including the distribution of Naltrexone kits. Funding will also cover salaries for a Therapist, Case Manager, Peer Recovery Support Specialist, and a prescriber to expand MAT services into the rural service area. Additionally, Red Rock has joined a consortium led by the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation for a 1-year RCORP planning grant to prepare for application for another RCORP grant in a neighboring RSA in Southwestern Oklahoma.\n\nIn September 2019 Red Rock was the recipient of a 100,000 dollar gift from the Johnson & Johnson Family company in recognition of the success we’ve had in preventing and treating behavioral health disorders.\n\nAlso in September, the United States Congress extended CCBHC funding until November when it will be considered along with other relevant health care legislation. An extension was awarded and Red Rock CCBHC has been extended until September 30, 2023.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Red Rock was awarded an over 200% increase in funding to expand important offender screening diversion programs from a few counties to over a dozen counties going from $94,000 to almost $320,000 in funding annually.\n\nIn November 2019, RR was awarded two new contracts to provide Mental Health Court services in both Canadian and Pottawatomie counties with approximately $100,000 per year per county. Additionally, Misdemeanor Diversion was awarded for Beckham, Blaine, Canadian, Custer, Jackson, Kingfisher, Roger Mills, and Washita Counties.\n\nIn late 2019, The Daily Oklahoman designated Red Rock as a top place to work in the annual survey conducted by the Daily Oklahoman. The Oklahoma, recognized Red Rock as top workplace in Oklahoma, rated at number twelve (12), a large company, with 350 plus employees. To celebrate, the Red Rock CEO and COO visited each site to make the announcement and express gratitude for the staff’s hard work and dedication.\n\nIn January 2020, Red Rock was awarded two new contracts with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DOC) to provide services in conjunction with the DOC Community-Sentencing program. The goal of Community Sentencing is to reduce recidivism rates and provide much-needed services including substance use disorder screening, assessments and treatment, case management, and peer recovery support services. Jordan’s Crossing and the new Red Rock Weatherford location are the two sites providing Community Sentencing services under these contracts.\n\nJanuary 2020, Red Rock received funding for Beckham & Roger Mills County for Rural Transportation Access for clients seen in Drug Court Furthermore, RR received funding for the same clients for Access to technology that would allow them to have more contact with clinical staff in order to have positive outcomes increasing compliance with Drug Court and treatment.\n\nIn February 2020, Red Rock opened Weatherford’s new state-of-the-art treatment facility in Weatherford Business & Industrial Park. Outpatient services started on February 10, 2020 & Crisis Unit opened its doors on February 14, 2020. Open House, July 17, 2020, was a success with Senator Darcy Jech, Senator Brent Howard, and Representative Todd Russ in attendance. The following Facebook link displays pictures of the new facility and the ribbon cutting, (https://www.facebook.com/RRBHS/posts/3256873211002494).\n\nOn March 13, 2020, Red Rock Leadership met to plan a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Red Rock Leadership responded consciously and quickly using information from the CDC and OK State Department of Health to ensure an appropriate response to COVID-19. Policy was developed and implemented to ensure client and staff safety. Red Rock is continuing to utilize telehealth services in all 17 counties to reduce exposure for clients and continue providing treatment.\n\nIn April 2020, ODMHSAS awarded funding to address COVID-19, particularly increasing outreach to raise community awareness regarding available services and how to access services. Funding earmarked for marketing produced a commercial that aired on KOCO between August – October. Red Rock posted this commercial to the Red Rock Facebook page, (https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=636027310369842&extid=UoGhJdsr2ytXb08Z).\n\nRed Rock received the CCBHC COVID Expansion Grant in May 2020. The expansion grant broadens Red Rock’s capacity to reach consumers – particularly in underserved areas. Born of this grant are the Virtual X Outpatient Clinic (VOP) and Virtual Response Team (VRT – formerly known as Mobile Crisis). The Virtual X Outpatient Clinic offers consumers the option of receiving the full range of Red Rock’s CCBHC services through virtual means in their homes. VOP improves access to services for these consumers – providing screenings, assessments, diagnosis, evidence-based treatments, and recovery support in a person-and-family-centered model. VOP improves access to these services, particularly for those consumers who may not have access to public transportation, lack resources for travel, have work-schedule conflicts, and may need alternate hours to access treatment. Virtual Outpatient services also benefit those consumers who wish anonymity in seeking services. VRT provides Crisis Intervention care and follow-up for consumers, working closely with Community Partners to ensure best practices and the excellent care of clients in crisis and/or those seeking resources. In this capacity, the Red Rock mobile crisis team (now functioning as VRT), established during the Demonstration years, strengthens those community partnerships and provides a much-needed service in Red Rock communities that improve integrated care. The continuous work of building and fostering relationships among our community partners through enhanced collaborations increases access to services with the goal of increased positive outcomes for Red Rock consumers.\n\nRed Rock joined forces with Cohen Veterans Network to provide treatment, predominately post 9/11 Veterans and their families, in spring 2020. The Steven A Cohen Military Family Clinic, located in Lawton, is currently undergoing CARF accreditation. The clinic works collaboratively with all other entities that provide services to our Military servicemen, women, and their families, specifically designed to meet the unique demands of our Military patrons. Special emphasis placed on hiring staff that have direct experience working with military cultural and networks. Red Rock anticipates capacity to provide cultural evidence-based services, vastly increasing the volume & quality of services to military personnel and families.\n\nSeptember 2021 Red Rock was awarded the CMHC Route 180 grant. Targeting high utilizers of services for the population with Co-Occurring Disorders and Severely Mentally Ill to address the increasing gap in services due to COVID. Through Route 180, RR will deliver clinical services to 400 unduplicated individuals each year, for a total of 800 individuals served. This grant start & end date is 09/30/2020 to 09/29/2023.\n\nIn September 2021, Red Rock was awarded funding to expand the MAT Clinic into 3 additional counties; Pottawatomie, Canadian County, and Custer Counties. This grant is a 5-year grant with a total of $1,260,000 at $525,000 a year over the next 5 years. This grant will serve 40 consumers in the first and second years for MAT Clinic services.\n\nRed Rock received $3,000 for a fundraiser, AID Walk Grant.\n\nRed Rock received a contract from DMH targeting transitional youth in January 2022 for $200k. SOC – Young Adult Transition Services – Oklahoma Healthy Transitions Initiative furnishes the necessary resources to provide treatment, support, and crisis services to young adults combating mental health, substance abuse, and co-occurring issues. Evidenced-based services such as SOC Wraparound, Transition to Independence, Housing First, and IPS will be offered in addition to intensive outreach services.\n\nRed Rock received $500k in October 2021 to embed an Urgent Care in Elk City and El Reno.\n\nRed Rock received $2,140,344 to build a Crisis Unit and Urgent Care in Shawnee.\n\nRed Rock CCBHC Expansion grant served 2,967 unduplicated consumers with the Virtual Response Team and engaged 610 consumers in virtual services through the Virtual Outpatient Clinic.\n\nThe Steven A Cohen Military Family Clinic at Red Rock, located in Lawton, celebrates its Grand Opening attended by Gov. Kevin Stitt.\n\nRed Rock received the Competency Evaluation fixed contract and the Competency Restoration sole source contract totaling $699,600. The contract provides $210,000 to provide wrap-around competency services to consumers in jails. If the consumers are found to have a need for restoration assistance $489,600 to was awarded to provide medications to those consumers.\n\nIn January 2022, Red Rock Human Resources establishes the Red Rock Cares foundation.

Initially, the bill led to the creation of VOP/VRT services for Red Rock. An additional measure required officers to transport individuals in need of treatment by a mental health professional or subject to an emergency detention or protective custody order, to the nearest facility within a 30-mile radius. The law enforcement agency that transported such an individual to an urgent recovery clinic is responsible for any subsequent transportation of such individual pending completion of the initial assessment, emergency detention, protective custody, or inpatient services. If no such facility is available, the bill provided for the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services to create a new transportation system in the state to provide such transportation.
