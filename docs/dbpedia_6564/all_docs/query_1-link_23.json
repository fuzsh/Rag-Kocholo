        "text": "An important predictor of whether a stock price will go up is its track record of momentum. Price trends tend to persist, so it's worth looking at them when it comes to a share like Red Rock Resources . Over the past six months, its share price has underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by -46.41%.\n\nAs of the last closing price of 0.05p, shares in Red Rock Resources were trading -34.23% below their 200 day moving average. You can read more about the power of momentum in assessing share price movements on Stockopedia.\n\nThe Red Rock Resources PE ratio based on its reported earnings over the past 12 months is null. The shares last closed at 0.05p.\n\nThe PE ratio (or price-to-earnings ratio) is the one of the most popular valuation measures used by stock market investors. It is calculated by dividing a company's price per share by its earnings per share.\n\nThe PE ratio can be seen as being expressed in years, in the sense that it shows the number of years of earnings which would be required to pay back the purchase price, ignoring inflation. So in general terms, the higher the PE, the more expensive the stock is."
