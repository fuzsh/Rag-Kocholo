        "text": "★★★★✩\n\nFirst released during the early Nineties Tarantino-influenced indie peak, this perfectly constructed desert noir was a callback to classic crime sizzlers, especially to Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons in Angel Face. Nicolas Cage is the “dumb lug” Mitchum archetype, Michael Williams, who bumbles into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, hoping for some quick cash but soon becomes ensnared by the mutually destructive relationship of the town sheriff Wayne Brown (the inimitable JT Walsh) and his femme fatale wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle from Twin Peaks).\n\nThe writer-director John Dahl was then also peaking and would, the next year, deliver the modern noir masterpiece The Last Seduction. And though Cage is effortlessly watchable as Williams, the performance of the movie is Dennis Hopper"
