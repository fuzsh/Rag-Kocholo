        "text": "Red Rock Developments is Breaking Ground for a 829,948 SF Industrial Facility\n\nMartinsburg, WV\n\nDeveloper seeks tenant for Class A warehouse in Martinsburg\n\nMarch 10,2022\n\nMARTINSBURG, W.VA. — Red Rock Developments, along with strategic partner, Cresset Real Estate Partners, has broken ground on a major Class A speculative industrial facility in Martinsburg and is seeking to secure a tenant before the site’s completed construction in early 2023.\n\nThe development, located on Williamsport Pike in Martinsburg, will feature 829,948 square feet of space ideal for a distribution and fulfillment center. Once complete, the building will be equipped to facilitate cross-dock distribution operations including 40-foot clear heights, 156 exterior docks, four drive-in doors, 516 parking spaces for cars and 349 trailer parking spaces.\n\nMartinsburg is strategically located for access to Interstates 81 and 70, major rail lines and inland ports, allowing a company to service the Baltimore, Richmond, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York and Washington D.C. markets in less than four hours. The region is in an already established but underserviced area with many national retailers, eCommerce companies and third-party logistics firms. Local prominent tenants that have chosen to operate in the area include Walmart, FedEx and Macy’s.\n\n“This new warehouse is a prime example of the kind of real estate and industrial assets West Virginia has to offer,” said West Virginia Department of Economic Development Secretary Mitch Carmichael. “I want to thank all of the good folks at Red Rock for their hard work on making this development possible. We look forward to our partnership in the region and can’t wait to welcome new business to Martinsburg and our great state.”\n\n“The project will provide unprecedented logistics opportunities for a variety of large-scale industrial users,” John Barker, Jr., SIOR President and Chief Development Officer of Red Rock. “With access to a talented labor pool and the region’s top distribution networks, we’re confident users will require the strategic and geographic advantages Martinsburg can provide their operation. Red Rock Developments would like to thank the West Virginia Department of Economic Development and the Berkeley County Development Authority for their support.”\n\nThe building is being leased by Gerry Blindbury and Colin Potter of Cushman & Wakefield.
