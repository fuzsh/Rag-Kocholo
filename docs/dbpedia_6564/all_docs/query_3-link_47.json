        "text": "The sign on the edge of town says, “You are leaving Red Rock,” but Nicolas Cage’s character, Michael Williams, can’t seem to escape the town once he’s arrived. Michael has drifted into the small Wyoming town with no money in his wallet and desperate for work. An honest man, he’s already lost out on a job at an oilfield because he wouldn’t lie about his bad knee. “That wouldn’t be right,” Michael replies when asked why. Later, at a gas station where he spends his last five dollars filling up his car, he turns his back on an open register while the owner isn’t looking.\n\nNow he’s sitting at a bar, drinking coffee, when the owner, Wayne, played by the late, great J.T. Walsh, looks at him and, in a hushed tone, asks “You are here for the job, aren’t you?” Michael has been mistaken for a hitman and is given a stack of cash, an advance on a job — to murder Wayne’s wife. Michael takes the money and drives out to the wife (Lara Flynn Boyle), to warn her. To his surprise, she pays him to kill Wayne. That’s when Michael tries to leave town… the first time.\n\nThat’s the set-up for 1993’s RED ROCK WEST, a crime thriller that delights in playing with film noir tropes, from the femme fatale of Boyle’s Suzanne with her own mysterious motivations, to the arrival of the real hitman, “Lyle, from Dallas” played by Dennis Hopper, to the reveal of Wayne’s other job, the one that puts Michael in even more jeopardy.\n\nRED ROCK WEST was directed by John Dahl who wrote it with his brother, Rick. Dahl had already achieved a level of film noir bona fides with 1989’s KILL ME AGAIN, about a two-bit detective caught up in a case of stolen money and beautiful woman on the run from her psychotic boyfriend… or is she? But RED ROCK WEST offers up an even more serpentine plot with a wonderful script full of twists and turns and characters (major and minor) who all have secrets up their sleeves. By the time the film climaxes at a night-time cemetery standoff with all the characters in attendance, Dahl still surprises us with even more betrayals and reveals, keeping us constantly guessing as to what’s going to happen right up until the final scene.\n\nNeo-noir films were abound in the 80s and 90s, with several directors marking huge breakthroughs with their takes on the genre: The Coen Bros’ debut BLOOD SIMPLE with its “things go from bad to worse” caper; David Lynch’s BLUE VELVET (starring Hopper) and TWIN PEAKS series (starring Boyle) where unspeakable crimes and danger linger just beneath the façade of tranquil small-town life. RED ROCK WEST was on track to making the same impact as those. The film had been well-received at film festivals but, unfortunately, was considered by the studio to be more suitable for cable and home video rather than a wide, theatrical release. Word of mouth spread, leading to it eventually play a limited theatrical run in 1994 where critical reviews helped it find a cult audience that remains to this day."
