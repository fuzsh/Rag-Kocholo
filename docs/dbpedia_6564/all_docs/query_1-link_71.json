        "text": "As a clinician, you have access to different forms of healthcare. There are several different specialties that you can pick from. You also have the opportunity to work flexible hours that other careers are longing for. As a per-diem clinician, you have the authority to work whenever you want, wherever you want. If you are looking into working PRN, check out these 6 reasons why you should seal the deal!\n\n1. Unmatched Flexibility\n\nThe phrase “per-diem” means “per day” in Latin, but in the healthcare profession it means temporary employment. That employment could be for only one day, or several days. Advantages and disadvantages can vary per person, but most healthcare clinicians would state the best part of PRN is the flexibility. You can work if you’d like, but you can also say no if you aren’t able to. That’s the beauty of per-diem shifts, everything is up to you.\n\n2. Work for Multiple Hospitals\n\nAs a per-diem clinician, you also have the ability to work for different hospitals at the same time. This is great for people who prefer to work in different areas of the city, or just being able to explore different clinical settings. It’s necessary for some clinicians to have the exposure to different types of work environments.\n\n3. Earn Extra Cash\n\nWho doesn’t need some extra cast nowadays? Whether you’re saving up for a new car, paying off student loans, or want to take a vacation- working PRN is one way of doing that! Often times, working the full-time shift every week can cause burnout. As a per-diem clinician, you can work as much or as little as you want while building up your bank account!\n\n4. Expand Your Knowledge & Skills\n\nIf you are interested in learning new technology or wanting to stretch your skillset, working per-diem shifts give you the chance to do that without the commitment. Working PRN gives you the opportunity to change the direction of your career if you invest yourself in a new skillset that you like.\n\n5. Trying New Facilities/Specialties Before Committing\n\nPer-diem shifts are the perfect way to try out a new specialty or location before actually signing a contract. You can see if you like the new change, and if you don’t, you aren’t stuck with a long-term commitment. When you find something else that you really enjoy, you can make the change knowing that it’s the right move for you!\n\n6. Enjoy the Balance\n\nPersonal dilemmas happen all the time in anyone’s life. Maybe you just had a baby and want to take more time off past maternity leave, or you want to go back to school; per-diem shifts give you that freedom to prioritize your personal life, while also being able to make an income. Bonus: per-diem clinicians are frequently eligible for the same benefits as full-time clinicians, like 401(k) and health insurance. This varies upon which facility you work for.\n\nAPPLY for PRN jobs today to get started on your travel adventure!\n\nIn the quest to find the perfect solution to today’s healthcare recruitment challenges, it’s likely that healthcare leaders have come across the term “healthcare workforce solutions”. While MSPs (Managed Service Providers) frequently come to mind, it's important to understand that workforce solutions extend far beyond just providing staff through an MSP. They now encompass a diverse set of models and technologies aimed at tackling today’s workforce challenges.\n\nThis guide explores what healthcare workforce solutions are, the various models and technologies they include, their use cases, and how they help manage staffing needs. It also offers insights on what to consider when partnering with a workforce solutions provider.\n\nWhat Are Healthcare Workforce Solutions?\n\nHealthcare workforce solutions refer to a range of different strategies, technologies, and services designed to address the complex staffing challenges faced by healthcare organizations today. These solutions focus on improving recruitment, credentialing, and administrative processes to enhance operational efficiency, control costs, and ensure the delivery of high-quality care. By offering flexibility in securing both permanent and contracted staff, workforce solutions help healthcare systems meet patient needs.\n\nTypes of Healthcare Workforce Solutions\n\nSince the pandemic, healthcare workforce solutions have gone beyond operating as strict, singular models that provide temporary staff. Just as healthcare workforce challenges are complex and diverse, so too are the solutions designed to tackle them. The expansion of models and technologies ensures that unique challenges are tackled in a helpful and impactful way, rather than utilizing a one-size-fits-all model that doesn’t address specific challenges. This section looks at workforce solutions in their various form, their benefits, and use cases.\n\n1. Managed Services Provider (MSP)\n\nManaged Services Providers (MSP) are one of the most well-known solutions in the healthcare staffing industry. These third-party organizations help facilities provide end-to-end staffing services that centralize and streamline the acquisition, management, and oversight of temporary staff, contractors, and other non-permanent labor.\n\nAs many recruitment teams are aware, managing an external workforce comes with its own set of challenges including ensuring compliance, sourcing talent, and quickly onboarding new hires. By serving as a single point of contact, MSPs simplify complex staffing processes. They manage all aspects of external worker recruitment and management including vendor management, sourcing, screening, onboarding, as well as payroll and invoicing tasks. This allows healthcare organizations to focus on their core operations. For instance, Staffency’s MSP services helped a Children’s Hospital reduce workweek hours by over 20%, allowing more focus on permanent staff initiatives. See the full case study here.\n\nImplementing an MSP program offers several advantages:\n\nCentralized Vendor Management: Simplifies interactions with multiple staffing agencies.\n\nEnhanced Compliance: Ensures adherence to regulations with dedicated compliance teams and technology.\n\nGreater Cost Control: Optimizes spending by managing recruitment costs and reducing administrative overhead.\n\nImproved Talent Acquisition: Leverages a wide network to fill roles efficiently, especially hard-to-fill positions.\n\nSupplier-Funded Technology: Provides access to advanced vendor management systems (VMS) at no additional cost, offering reporting, transparency, and data management benefits.\n\nData-Driven Decision Making: Utilizes a VMS for comprehensive reporting and insights.\n\nScalability and Flexibility: Adapts to changing staffing needs and demands.\n\nUse Cases: Managing temporary staffing needs, streamlining recruitment processes, streamlining vendor management and communication, enhancing compliance and quality control, managing cost and budget constraints.\n\n2. Vendor Management System (VMS)\n\nA vendor management system (VMS) is a SaaS solution designed for healthcare organizations to automate talent acquisition and centralize data management. By consolidating traditionally siloed data into a single platform, a VMS streamlines operations from job requisition posting through to candidate onboarding and invoicing.\n\nCentralization of data and processes allows the VMS to automate and simplify recruitment processes, including sourcing, onboarding, and compliance, while providing clear program transparency. This centralization also allows for the VMS to collate real-time analytics and comprehensive reporting to support data-driven decision-making.\n\nWhat makes a VMS so useful is its versatility. For example, a VMS underpins several workforce programs, such as MSPs and Direct Sourcing initiatives, making it a versatile tool across different workforce models.\n\nImplementing a VMS offers several key advantages, including streamlined recruitment, improved compliance, and optimized vendor management. Its capabilities help reduce the complexity and time-consuming nature of managing staffing processes, resulting in better operational efficiency and cost control.\n\nKey features of a VMS include:\n\nMarket Rate Analytics: Real-time cost visibility and predictive insights on market rates to make proactive decisions based on current labor and service rates.\n\nProactive Compliance: Automate compliance tracking and monitoring to navigate complex healthcare regulations.\n\nSeamless Integrations: Easily integrate with other platforms to streamline processes, such as time management systems (KRONOS) or healthcare licensing platforms (Nursys).\n\nComprehensive Data and Reporting: Access to dashboards for real-time insights that support data-driven decision-making.\n\nCandidate-Match Pairing: Automated sourcing and shortlisting features to identify the most qualified candidates for job openings.\n\nOnline Interview Tools: Conduct and review pre-recorded video interviews to streamline the hiring process.\n\nUse cases: Centralizing staffing operations, improving compliance and credentialing, enhancing data-driven decision making, reducing administrative burdens, optimizing vendor management.\n\n3. Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO)\n\nRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) involves partnering with external experts to handle all or part of an organization’s recruitment needs. RPO providers take on various tasks like sourcing, screening, and onboarding, helping healthcare institutions find and hire permanent or temporary candidates more efficiently.\n\nRPO providers are particularly useful in helping institutions fill positions quickly, improve candidate quality, and reduce hiring costs. This allows hospitals to focus more on patient care rather than navigating the complexities of recruitment.\n\nDepending on a hospital’s needs, RPO models can vary:\n\nEnd-to-end (full) RPO: This model covers the entire recruitment process, enhancing hiring efficiency from start to finish.\n\nSelective or branded RPO: Organizations outsource specific parts of the hiring process to specialists while keeping other parts in-house. This approach allows for greater customization, flexibility, and cost control.\n\nOn-demand or project-based RPO: Perfect for short-term needs, this model allows hospitals to tap into RPO services for specific projects or periods.\n\nUse cases: Scaling recruitment efforts, improving time-to-hire, accessing specialized recruiting expertise, reducing recruitment costs, enhancing candidate quality.\n\n4. Internal Resource Pools (IRP) / Float Pools\n\nLooking for flexible staffing solutions that can adapt to sudden demands or surges? Internal Resource Pools (IRP) and Float Pools might be just what you need. IRP (also referred to as Flex Pools) and Float Pools are workforce solutions that help hospitals maintain flexibility by deploying cross-trained healthcare professionals across different departments. This ensures quick responses to fluctuating patient volumes.\n\nThe terms IRP and Float Pools are often used interchangeably in the industry, although there is a subtle difference. IRPs can encompass a broader range of roles from administrative staff to allied health, whereas float pools typically focus on clinical staff, such as nurses, floating between units or departments. Despite this difference, both solutions offer the same advantage—enhancing staffing flexibility to meet patient demand.\n\nIRP and Float Pools help organizations save costs associated with temporary labor and also fill gaps more quickly rather than relying on the time-consuming process of recruiting and onboarding. By giving employees greater control over their schedules, these solutions also promote better work-life balance, making them a win-win for both staff and health systems.\n\nUse cases: Maintaining staffing flexibility, reducing reliance on external labor, enhancing workforce satisfaction, improving continuity of care.\n\n5. Direct Sourcing\n\nAnother workforce solution that empowers organizations for long-term hiring success is direct sourcing. In direct sourcing, healthcare organizations recruit and hire workers directly, rather than relying on traditional staffing agencies. By leveraging their own recruitment teams and technology, they can build a dedicated talent pool ready to be tapped into when needs arise, streamlining the process and optimizing resource use.\n\nThe primary function of direct sourcing is to create and maintain a pool of qualified candidates who are readily available to fill positions as they open. This involves building relationships with passive candidates and using platforms like a VMS or ATS to efficiently match talent with roles.\n\nDirect sourcing simplifies recruitment for hospitals, making it more cost-effective by reducing dependency on third-party agencies. With a strong talent pipeline in place, hospitals can hire candidates directly for positions, leading to significant time and resource savings.\n\nUse cases: Filling critical roles quickly, engaging passive candidates, talent pipeline development, building a flexible workforce, reducing recruitment costs, enhancing employer branding.\n\n6. Crisis or Strike Staffing\n\nThe number of hospital strikes has risen annually, with 2024 projected to exceed last year’s total of 30 strikes. Hospital strikes stem from a multitude of factors, including requests for fairer wages, improved working conditions, and better staffing and recruitment practices. Some workforce solution providers offer crisis or strike staffing solutions that quickly deploy clinicians in anticipation of strikes.\n\nStrike staffing providers manage all aspects of strike planning and execution, from determining staffing needs and resources to ensuring compliance, overseeing deployment, and handling transportation and housing. This approach enables hospitals to maintain uninterrupted patient care during a strike.\n\nUse cases: Impending strikes, emergency situations, workforce shortages.\n\n7. Per Diem\n\nWhen a healthcare facility needs temporary clinicians immediately for short-term needs, that’s where Per Diem services come in. Per Diem staffing allows hospitals to hire temporary workers on a daily basis to fill in staffing gaps. Often, this is used to cover shifts during vacations, sick leaves, or unexpected patient volume surges. Per Diem professionals are on-call and ready to step in when needed.\n\nThis staffing model is quite flexible, allowing hospitals to respond quickly to changing staffing needs without committing to long-term hires. It helps reduce the burden on full-time staff, preventing burnout by ensuring shifts are covered. Additionally, Per Diem workers can be cost-effective, as they are hired only when needed, avoiding the expenses associated with full-time employment, such as benefits and overtime pay.\n\nUse cases: Filling last-minute vacancies, seasonal staffing needs, supplementing staff, peak time support.\n\n8. Locum Tenens\n\nLocum tenens is another short-term solution in which physicians or advanced practitioners fill in for regular staff who are absent due to circumstances like vacation or medical leave. Their use ensures that patient care continues without disruption, even when the usual team members are unavailable.\n\nDue to its flexible nature, locum tenens solutions allow organizations to quickly address staffing shortages without needing to hire full-time staff. Organizations can maintain patient care while also supporting the core team by preventing burnout through better workload management.\n\nUse Cases: Filling in for long-term leave, addressing short-term vacancies, providing specialized expertise, managing unexpected staff shortages.\n\n9. Consulting Services\n\nFor institutions looking for expert guidance and strategic support while maintaining their own staffing operations, healthcare organizations can leverage industry expertise through consulting services from workforce solution providers. These services are designed to help organizations navigate complex staffing challenges, optimize workforce management, and implement effective recruitment strategies. Consulting services typically involve a thorough analysis of current practices, followed by tailored recommendations to improve operational efficiency, compliance, and overall staffing effectiveness.\n\nThe benefits of consulting services include gaining access to industry expertise and specialized knowledge that can drive better decision-making and outcomes. Healthcare organizations can improve their staffing models, reduce costs, and enhance their ability to attract and retain top talent. Additionally, consulting services can lead to more efficient processes, improved compliance with regulations, and the implementation of best practices that align with the organization’s goals.\n\nUse Cases: Optimizing staffing models to match patient demand, improving recruitment and retention strategies, enhancing compliance with healthcare regulations, implementing new technologies, addressing specific challenges, such as high turnover or staffing shortages.\n\nBenefits of Healthcare Workforce Solutions\n\nWith such a wide range of solutions available, workforce solutions help hospitals overcome key challenges like improving staffing efficiency, managing costs, finding quality candidates, and enhancing overall patient care.\n\n1. Enhanced Efficiency\n\nTraditional recruitment methods in healthcare staffing often rely on manual data tracking, spreadsheets, and other fragmented processes. This leads to time-consuming operations that can have negative consequences, such as delayed recruitment, poor candidate experiences, and error-prone data management. These inefficiencies indirectly affect the quality of patient care as they strain resources and delay timely staffing.\n\nHealthcare workforce solutions address these inefficiencies by streamlining staffing processes and lightening the administrative load for hospitals. Solutions like VMS, MSPs, and RPOs automate and centralize tasks, such as recruitment, compliance tracking, and invoicing—saving both time and costs. Reducing manual work involved in staffing gives healthcare teams more time to focus on important business initiatives and, most importantly, patient care.\n\n2. Cost Savings\n\nWith financial strains ranking as a top concern for healthcare executives (second only to workforce challenges), the need to achieve greater cost savings and financial management is critical. Workforce solutions help hospitals achieve greater cost savings in several ways. Automating and centralizing processes help reduce expenses, like overtime, by ensuring optimal staffing levels and making sure the right people are in the right place at the right time.\n\nSeamless and efficient operations mean less time wasted on recruitment, avoiding the high costs associated with prolonged vacancy rates. Additionally, solutions and technologies help minimize errors that occur when handling tasks manually—this helps reduce the need for costly fixes.\n\n3. Top-Quality Candidates\n\nEnsuring that highly-skilled talent walks through the door is important for health systems to deliver quality patient care. Workforce solutions help ensure health systems are receiving highly vetted professionals who are ready to provide excellent care.\n\nWhen sourcing and screening talent, workforce providers use advanced AI-powered technologies to pinpoint the most suitable candidates with the right skillset and experience for each role. They also have dedicated compliance teams with comprehensive vetting processes to verify credentials and background checks, ensuring high standards. Many providers also use VMS technology with automated compliance features that track and monitor credentials, sending notifications about upcoming expirations to keep organizations on top of compliance.\n\nLearn how our VMS, StaffBot, integrates with healthcare entities, such as the AHA and Nursys, to automate compliance and streamline your recruitment in our 15-minute demo!\n\nClinically-led teams further enhance candidate quality by applying their expertise to vet candidates, ensuring they not only meet professional qualifications, but also align with the specific needs and culture of the healthcare organization. This thorough approach helps hospitals confidently staff their teams with skilled professionals, leading to better patient care.\n\n4. Improved Patient Care\n\nWorkforce solutions enhance patient care by ensuring that healthcare organizations are staffed with highly qualified professionals who can deliver exceptional service. By streamlining staffing processes and increasing operational efficiency, these solutions reduce the time spent on recruitment and administrative tasks, allowing healthcare teams to focus more on patient care.\n\nChoosing the Right Solution for Your Needs\n\nIt’s important to choose the right healthcare workforce solution provider wisely, after all it’s an investment in time, resources, and operational changes. Important factors to consider is their reputation, experience, range of services, cost-effectiveness, compliance, and technology for efficient operations.\n\nConclusion\n\nEffective workforce solutions can be an asset in overcoming today’s healthcare workforce challenges and enhancing patient care. Whether through MSPs, VMS, RPO, or IRPs, these solutions streamline operations, manage costs, and improve candidate quality.\n\nAssess your organization’s needs and choose a provider that aligns with your goals to maximize the benefits.

Bringing your pup on hikes can also help them socialize and become less nervous in crowded areas or around unfamiliar noises. As always, before heading for a hike, make sure dogs are allowed. Most national parks do not allow dogs on the trails, but most state parks do. There are tons of products on the market nowadays for hiking with your pup. If you are an adventurous travel nurse and bring your pup with you for every new assignment, we encourage you to read on and view our recommended products. Some products may be obvious, but others may be something new!\n\nMuttRuk Phoenix 14L Backpack\n\nIf you are familiar with the Dogstagram world, you may have heard of the brand MuttRuk. They came to the market a few years ago with a brilliant idea of a dog-focused backpack for humans. Obviously, when going on any hike, you will more than likely be bringing a backpack to store food, water, and other items. However, MuttRuk created a backpack specifically for those that hike with their pups. Not only does this backpack have tons of storage and pockets for carrying your phone, keys, dog treats, or waste dispenser bags, but it also comes with a carabiner you can use to hook your pup’s leash to for handsfree hiking. MuttRuk’s Phoenix Backpack is also water reservoir compatible. For shorter hikes, they also have a Sidekick Pack that straps around your waist. Both packs are available in multiple colors and so perfect for hiking with your pup!\n\nWater Bottles/Bowls\n\nThis will be one of the obvious necessities, but you always want to make sure you have lots of water on hand for not only yourself, but for your pup. If you plan on doing longer day hikes, make sure to bring plenty of water to last through the entire trip. There are different kinds of portable water bowls for dogs. Most bowls are collapsible and made with either silicone or fabric with a waterproof lining. Some companies offer bowls that clip directly to your backpack to offer you more storage inside our pack. Another popular dog bowl are the squeezable water bottles. Those are nice to prevent wasting water as you can squeeze the water directly into the bowl that’s placed on top of the bottle where a cap would usually be. Makes it quick and easy to give your pup water while on the go too.\n\nFood/Treats\n\nJust like water, also be sure to pack food and treats for your pup! For those longer hikes, if you plan on spending some time at the destination of interest, bring some food for your pup while you eat your lunch. You can use your hike for training by rewarding them for staying by you or ignoring others you pass by on the trails. While on the trail, if it allows off-leash, you can practice your dog’s recall with a dog whistle. Note: We do not recommend practicing this if your dog is new to recall or does not do well around other humans and pets.\n\nPoop Bags/Container\n\nThis may be another obvious necessity, but several forget to pack them while hiking the trails. Poop bags are important to help keep the parks clean. Some parks no longer accept pets due to owners not picking up after their dogs. Most poop bags come with a holder that can latch to any leash or backpack. However, the bags themselves do not stop the smell. We recommend looking for reusable and washable containers that lock the stink in until you arrive home. Those will help remove the stench during your hike so you can continue to enjoy your trip.\n\nFirst Aid Kit\n\nJust like you would bring one for yourself, you should also pack one for your pup! The brand, Adventure Medical Kits, creates first aid kits for both you and your dog. Their kits are packed up in a waterproof bag and provide a handbook to help examine and administer first aid on your pet. The kits also have tick/splinter removers, bandages, and a wound cleaning tool. You never know what may happen while on a hike. Your pup could step on a sharp rock or piece of wood and puncture their paw pad. It is best to have a first aid kit on hand to prepare for any kind of emergency.\n\nBoots\n\nBoots are a great option to help protect your dog’s paw pads from being damaged. While we have hiking boots to protect our feet, your dog should have boots as well for longer hikes. Boots are especially important for hiking rocky terrain like the mountains or in hot areas like the desert. You do not want your dog to injure or burn their paw pads during your hike. Not only will they be in pain, but they will also have a harder time hiking back to the car if you do not have a rescue sling.\n\nRescue Sling\n\nSlings are important to have on hand in case of emergencies during your hike. Fido Pro provides good quality and reliable slings to place your dog in in case something happens to their legs or paws. They are easy to pack in your backpack for travel and can be extremely helpful if any issues happen to occur. With their slings, you will essentially be wearing your dog as a backpack. This will help keep them off the ground and for easier transport back to your car or nearby shelter.\n\nAdditional Collars and Leashes\n\nLet’s face it, we have all had a time when our pets have escaped their collar, or the leash snapped. If your dog is not so great at recall, make sure to bring an additional collar or leash with you on your hike. Martingale collars or harnesses are great to have for hikes to help prevent your dog from pulling and escaping. For leashes, try investing in a biothane one as that material is much more durable than the basic webbing ones you can find at local pet stores. Biothane is waterproof and has a larger break strength than polyester webbing as well.\n\nEurolead\n\nIf you have not heard of a eurolead, we highly recommend checking them out! Most euroleads are multifunction where you get multiple leashes in one! These leashes will typically have two clasps (one on each end) and a floating O-Ring to hook one clasp end to. Euroleads can be used for handsfree hiking, whether it be wrapping the leash around your waist or as a crossbody. There are also options for different leash lengths or using it to keep your dog in one spot by wrapping it around a tree or post. As we mentioned in the last tip, make sure to look for a eurolead made with biothane for easy cleanup!\n\nFlea/Tick Spray\n\nJust how you would use bug spray on yourself, you should get some for your pup as well. There are special brands on the market that make spray specifically for pets since their skin tends to be more sensitive than ours. Typically wearing long clothing helps protect us from getting ticks on our skin. However, our pets do not have that protection. They are more likely to get ticks while hiking, so it is best to help keep the ticks away with bug spray. Even if you give your pets flea/tick medicine monthly, that may not fully protect them. If going on longer hikes, make sure to apply the spray every so often for maximum protection.\n\nFor those who are adventurous with their pups, we hope this article has been helpful. Depending on where your hike is or how long it is, some of these items may not be necessary. Always make sure to bring your phone or camera with you on your hikes to snap some pictures of the gorgeous view with your dog. If you go on hikes with your dog, what are some necessities you bring with you?"
