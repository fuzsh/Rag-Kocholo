        "text": "Wildflowers\n\nRed Rock Canyon State Park is famous for its stunning red rock formations, towering cliffs, and unique desert landscapes...although it can also be home to beautiful Spring wildflowers. The climate here is characterized by intense hot summers and mild winters, but after a heavy winter rainy season, you can see a wide variety of wildflowers here generally from late-March through April (and occasionally into May). Currently (as of 3/30/24), the hills here are blanketed with vivid yellow Goldenfields, which are the most prominent flowers, as well as Bigelows Coreopsis, California Coreopsis, Red Rock Tarweed, and Tall Evening Primrose. Purple hues are currently harder to spot, but Desert Royal Lupine, Mojave Indigo Bush, Lacy Phacella, and Desert Monkeyflower can be seen here if you keep a close eye out.\n\nHiking & OHV Trails\n\nAt only 1.2 miles long with an elevation change of less than 50 feet, Hagen Canyon Nature Trail is one of my favorite hikes in Red Rock Canyon State Park. As of 3/30/24, this trail is one of the most easily accessible and best spots to see the wildflowers. Red Cliffs Trail is another easy, otherworldly hike at just under a mile with 100 feet in elevation change, however the only flowers you’ll find here are on the west side of the cliff formations, closest to Hwy 14. The Ricardo Trail is also sprinkled with beautiful wildflowers and easily completed in just over a mile, as is the Desert View Trail. Right now I recommend combining both of these hikes to enjoy the incredible topography and stunning wildflowers. OHV trails are also popular here, including the 13-mile Last Chance Canyon and 10-mile Burro Schmidt's Tunnel.\n\nFor more information on Hagen Canyon and Red Cliffs Nature Trails, check out my Red Rock Canyon - CA’s Most Underrated State Park blog post.\n\nCamping\n\nCamping is available at Ricardo Campground. This campground is tucked up against the base of dramatic desert cliffs with 50 primitive campsites, potable water, pit toilets, fire rings, and tables. Bring your own firewood or purchase it at the visitor center. There are no RV hook-ups or showers, and a maximum of 8 people is allowed per site (there are no group sites). Camping is first-come first-served with no advanced reservation system, so plan on showing up early to snag your desired spot, particularly on weekends. Camping is $25 per night per site, which includes parking for one vehicle per site. There is a 30 foot maximum on RVs.\n\nHistory\n\nRed Rock Canyon has a fascinating history. Long before it was named Kern County’s first state park in 1968, scientists believe that this whole area lay under water at the bottom of a massive lake millions of years ago. Many types of fossils have been found here...everything from alligator lizards to sabertooth cats! The bright red colors found here are due to high iron content in some sediment layers. As the iron oxidizes (rusts) it turns red, and on the rare occasion of heavy rainfall the rust color trickles down and collects in small streams making it appear like the cliffs are bleeding. Native Americans used this as part of a trade route for thousands of years.\n\nIf the otherworldly landscape looks familiar, it’s probably because Hollywood has been filming here since the 1930s. Classics, including The Big Country, The Outlaw and The Ten Commandments, used Red Rock Canyon as their backdrop. More recently, both Jurassic Park and The Mummy were filmed here.\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\n• Please be considerate of the Leave no Trace Principles to help keep this place wild and beautiful.\n\n• Official park hours are sunrise to sunset.\n\n• Overnight camping is available at Ricardo Campground for $25 per night on a first come first serve basis (no reservations).\n\n• The visitor center at the north end of the park (near the campground) offers helpful maps & information.\n\n• Fossil Falls is also another great stop less than an hour away.\n\n• Horseback riding is allowed on the trails.\n\n• There is very little shade at the park, so plan accordingly (bring plenty of water and sun protection).\n\n• Weather fluctuations can occur quickly, including excessive heat in the Summer and flash flooding during Winter.\n\n• Off-road biking is not allowed anywhere at the park.\n\n• Collection of any artifacts, plants or cultural features are prohibited without a proper permit.\n\n• The terrain is sandy and eroding in many areas, so proper footwear is necessary for exploring red rock."
