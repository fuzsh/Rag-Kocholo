        "text": "FAIRMONT — The Red Rock Center for the Arts is opening its doors and welcoming professional artist Dale Harbitz of Sherburn to exhibit 25 pieces of art for the public. The exhibit will be held on Sunday, August 4, beginning at 1 p.m.. Harbitz’s work reflects memories of his life and scenes he connects to on an emotional status. Guests of the exhibit will explore the story behind each piece of work and study the technique of every image he displays.\n\nHarbitz is no novice regarding art, having started at an early age, despite not having an art program at his elementary school.\n\n“My notebooks were full of doodles. I was a rather distracted student,” Harbitz shared with a chuckle.\n\nLater in his life, Harbitz served with the First Cavalry Division in Vietnam. He said that many of his experiences from Vietnam are expressed in his paintings. Harbitz recounted the memories of Vietnamese children in the small towns he visited in the country.\n\n“Kids came up to us. it reminded me that humanity still has good in it, in the eyes of the kids,” Harbitz reflected.\n\nHarbitz said he didn’t begin art classes until after he returned from Vietnam, but his experience with the village children provoked him to enter the field of education. Harbitz attended Mankato State University, earning a degree in art education. Harbitz taught art and work for more than 20 years in Estherville and Oskaloosa, Iowa. Habitz said that balancing teaching and being a professional artist wasn’t simple, but he focused on his duty of conveying art to his students, rather than creating it. In addition, his family began to expand, so he moved his artwork temporarily aside.\n\n“I liked working with kids,” Harbitz said, explaining his reasoning for pursuing art education rather than an individual artist.\n\nFollowing his art instructor career, he transitioned to the elementary principal of Martin County West, where he worked for 27 years. Harbitz concluded his education career and retired in 2016.\n\nAfter he finished his art studio, which is in his own home in West Sherburn, Harbitz was able to focus once more on his work. He said each artwork takes between 20 and 200 hours, with the majority of his work taking 40 to 60 hours total.\n\n“I spend a lot of time in the thinking process,” Harbitz shared with a smile. “Once I start, I have to finish.”\n\nAt the time of writing, Harbitz finished his most recent piece in his home studio two days ago.\n\nHarbitz’s creative process mainly includes his psychological bond to each of his works. He described he creates an image in his head, from a vivid memory that he holds dear, and transfers it accurately onto his canvas.\n\n“I don’t produce work just to produce work. I do it with an emotional connection,” he said.\n\nRegarding his audience, Harbitz says he doesn’t encourage a specific theme in those who appreciate his artwork, though he tends to explain the story and memory behind it. He explained each viewer is welcome to hold their original interpretations of a message.\n\n“Art critics think your art needs to look a certain way. Art comes from your soul and your techniques,” he stated. “Every observer has a perspective. The viewer needs to decide whether they like it.”\n\nHarbitz shared words for aspiring artists in Martin County.\n\n“Start out, and dig into it deeper,” he said. “I have thousands of hours of experience. That’s a part of life.”"
