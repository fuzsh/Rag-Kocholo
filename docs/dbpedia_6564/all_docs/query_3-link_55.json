        "text": "We protected the gateway to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area nearly 30 years ago with partners. Today we’re thrilled there’s permanent signage sharing this amazing collaboration! See photos from the unveiling from the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nInspiring Future Generations\n\nThe Nature Conservancy is proud to support the Mojave Max educational program at Red Rock National Conservation Area.\n\nOur Conservation Legacy at Red Rock Canyon\n\nTowering behind the Las Vegas skyline, Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area’s iconic red-banded peaks are one of Southern Nevada’s most beloved outdoor destinations. More than 2 million people visit Red Rock Canyon each year to hike, bike, rock climb and more. But in the 1980s, this incredible area was almost permanently changed by a housing development planned next door.\n\nTo ensure your views from the canyon’s incredible trails aren’t spoiled, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, The Howard Hughes Corporation and The Nature Conservancy formed a strategic partnership in 1988, creating a 5,302-acre buffer zone, relocating the housing development and safeguarding where the Visitor Center and beyond stands today. By relocating Summerlin, The Howard Hughes Corporation’s 22,500-acre master planned community, a “win-win” was achieved that supported continued economic growth for Las Vegas while protecting a fragile natural desert community.\n\nThis $25 million transaction was one of the largest ever completed by the Conservancy in the West and, thanks to the generosity of The Howard Hughes Corporation, resulted in a savings to taxpayers of over $1 million.\n\nBy coming together in a spirit of innovation, cooperation and community goodwill, together we ensured public access into Red Rock Canyon was permanently protected and residents (and visitors alike!) could enjoy hiking, biking, rock climbing and more. Visitors can also see desert bighorn sheep, numerous bird species, threatened wildflowers, rare insects, and sensitive reptiles such as Gila monster and desert tortoise—all in their native habitat."
