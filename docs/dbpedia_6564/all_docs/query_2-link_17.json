        "text": "The room was tastefully decorated and incredibly comfortable. We travel to Red Rocks often and have always wanted to stay here! We definitely will be coming back and making Origin our go-to spot! Luke at the front desk was wonderful. He was very nice and got us checked in quickly. Five stars for Luke and the hotel!\n\n- Melissa M.\n\nWe loved this hotel. Comfortable beds, great bathroom amenities, close to hiking trails and our son's campus in Golden, as well as a short drive to Denver. Conveniently located near an amazing coffee shop and wine restaurant across the street—both fabulous! Will definitely stay again.\n\n- Gloria C.\n\nWe had a quick trip to Denver and decided to stay in Golden. We loved Origin Hotel! Clean, friendly, convenient location, fair price. Lovely soap and shampoo in the room. This won’t be our last stay. Yes, you must give them a try!\n\n- Craig & Jody\n\nThis place has the best staff and is friggin' awesome. Rooms are beautiful and very, very clean… There are not enough stars to give to the Origin Red Rocks Hotel. Can't wait to return and this is the best service I have ever received from any staff anywhere.\n\n- Rex T. Cunningham"
