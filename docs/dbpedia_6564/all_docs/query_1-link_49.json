        "text": "Red Rock Power Limited is an investor, owner, operator and developer of renewable energy projects. Based in Edinburgh, Scotland, our growing team are passionate about generating clean energy and supporting the UK and Europe’s net zero ambitions. Our current portfolio includes five part or fully owned wind farm projects, each at different lifecycle stages. Our operational wind farms – Afton (100% equity), Beatrice (25%) and Överturingen (50%) – have an installed capacity of 320 MW (RRPL proportion), while our development projects – Benbrack onshore wind farm in the South West of Scotland (100%) and Inch Cape offshore wind farm off the East Coast (50%) – will deliver an additional 570 MW. While our expertise lies in the wind sector and we are continuing to grow our UK wind portfolio, we are actively pursuing partnership, acquisition and development opportunities to expand into the wider European market and other sustainable energy technologies. Our Edinburgh headquarters puts us at the heart of the UK industry, and our team’s expertise and experience working on some of the world’s largest energy infrastructure projects allows us a unique position to consider a variety of different opportunities and we welcome candidates to join us on this journey.
