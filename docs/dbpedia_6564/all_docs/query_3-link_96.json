        "text": "Dual Format: Red Rock West (1993)\n\nImagine a film starring Nic Cage AND Dennis Hopper. Sounds like a car crash? Nope, it’s a heaven-made match.\n\nAnything Nic Cage is in is watchable, whether or not he reigns it in or lets loose, he’s the most individual actor around and always brings his actorly weight to any part he plays, normally elevating the film (for me anyway).\n\nCage plays Michael Williams, who after failing to get a job at at an oilfield because of an old war injury, ends up broke and wandering into the next town; Red Rock.\n\nEntering a local bar the barman Wayne (JT Walsh) admonishes his lateness because he thinks he’s ‘Lyle from Dallas’ who he’s hired to kill someone, that someone is his wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle).\n\nWe then gallop off into Noir land, as double crossing spouses, missing money, fake identities and the real Lyle (Dennis Hopper) arrives to make the hit.\n\nA hugely entertaining film, with just the right amount of Cage/Hopper madness to keep you on edge right till the end.\n\nPossibly a film that’s passed a lot of people by and well worth a watch, especially when it looks as good as it does on this blu-ray release by Signal One Entertainment.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nHigh-Definition Transfer\n\nUK Blu-ray™ Premiere\n\nStill Gallery\n\nOptional English SDH Subtitles for the Main Feature\n\nAudio Commentary with Director John Dahl\n\nNew Interview with Director John Dahl\n\nNew interview with Editor Scott Chestnut\n\nNew interview with Actor Dale Gibson\n\n“Caged In” host Petros Patsilivas talks Nicolas Cage’s performance\n\nBooklet by Ian Schultz\n\nPoster\n\nReleased 22nd August 2022."
