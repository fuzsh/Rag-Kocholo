        "text": "Who We are:\n\nThe Red Rock OHV Conservation Crew (RROCC) is a coalition of a dozen private OHV/ATV businesses and Jeep rental and guided tour companies from Cottonwood, Sedona and Flagstaff, along with TreadLightly!, a national nonprofit dedicated to ethical and responsible motorized recreation. The Sedona Chamber convened this group and continues to work with them in partnership with the US Forest Service – Coconino National Forest Red Rock Ranger District, AZ State Parks, AZ Fish & Game, Yavapai County Sheriff and the City of Sedona Police and staff.\n\nWhat We do:\n\nStrive to balance the right to recreate on public lands with the environmental stewardship, preservation of our cultural heritage and care for resident quality of life required to ensure OHV access to our national forest is sustainable.\n\nOur Story:\n\nFor years, increased Off-Highway Vehicles (OHVs) use in the Greater Sedona area has affected public lands, cultural assets and residential neighborhoods. Interest in OHV recreation continues to grow - the number of registered OHVs in Arizona exceeded 452,000 in 2021.\n\nCOVID caused a surge of visitors to Sedona seeking socially distanced outdoor recreation, creating even more demand for OHVs and raising community concerns.\n\nRROCC formed in the summer of 2021 to find solutions to these concerns and sustainably maintain access to public lands for OHV recreation.\n\nThough RROCC is a new collaboration, it originates from the City of Sedona’s 2013 OHV Work Group, which included the US Forest Service, Arizona State Parks, Arizona Game & Fish, the motorized industry, citizens and nonprofits.\n\nOHV rental and guided tour companies dedicate 1% of sales to trail enhancement and rider education\n\nIn September 2021, private OHV rental and guided tour companies began dedicating 1% of sales to land preservation and rider education, with the potential to achieve $400,000 in annual contributions to the US Forest Service Coconino National Forest Red Rock Ranger District.\n\nThis commitment is in addition to the 3% of gross revenues all businesses permitted to operate on National Forest lands are required to contribute, 95% of which stays on local Forest land for maintenance of existing infrastructure, ground operations, monitoring and administration.\n\nParticipating companies:\n\nArizona Safari Jeep Tours\n\nBarlow Adventures\n\nOutback ATV\n\nPink Jeep Tours\n\nRainbow Adventures, comprised of A Day in the West, Earth Wisdom, Red Rock Western Jeep Tours and Sedona Off-Road Adventures\n\nRed Rock ATV\n\nSedona ATV\n\nVortex ATV\n\nThe City of Sedona 2019 Off Highway Vehicle Report\n\nFor a comprehensive look at the City of Sedona’s previous work to address OHV use on public lands, download the OHV report - City of Sedona - 2019. The report sheds light on the complexities of the issues and why there is no single solution.\n\nThis Work Group brought together people on all sides of the issue, leading to a better understanding of all perspectives. The report is an excellent reference for background information, state and city regulations, and previous efforts and accomplishments. It provides recommendations for the Sedona City Council and the Coconino National Forest.\n\nVisit this page regularly for RROCC team updates!\n\nResources:\n\nSedona City Council Meeting, October 26, 2021\n\nTreadlightly.org\n\nCoconino National Forest OHV riding and camping\n\nAlso available as a PDF: Sedona four wheel drive and off-highway vehicle routes\n\nPrivate Partners\n\nLand Management, Nonprofit and Government Partners"
