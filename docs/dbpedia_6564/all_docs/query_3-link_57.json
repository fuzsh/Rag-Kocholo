        "text": "Update (August 12, 2024, 3:22 p.m.): From Tuesday, August 13th through Thursday, August 15, sections of the Volksweg Trail will be closed for repairs. Sections impacted include the trail from South Tailwater through Howell Station to the North Overlook Picnic Area trailhead, and from Hempstead Drive through Wallashuck to the first bridge west of the park (near mile marker 5.5). For more information, please contact the Corps administration office at (641) 828-7522. Currently, swimming is not recommended at Lake Red Rockâ€™s North Overlook Beach due to elevated bacterial counts. The beach will be posted with \"Swimming Not Recommended\" signs until further testing indicates low bacteria counts. Sampling at the beaches is performed weekly by the Corps through a contract with Iowa State University. Further information on the Corps of Engineers water quality monitoring procedures may be obtained at the Red Rock Visitor Center. Highway T15 over the Red Rock Dam is open to traffic. All of the Corps managed campgrounds are now open for the recreation season. For site-specific details on the status of Lake Red Rock's recreation areas, Click HERE."
