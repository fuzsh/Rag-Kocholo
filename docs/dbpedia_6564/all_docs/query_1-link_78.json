        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Red Rock Casino, Resort and Spa is located 10 miles north of the Las Vegas Strip in Summerlin, Nevada. The 70-acre site is located at the corner of Charleston Blvd. and I-215.\n\nThe Red Rock is a Station Casino, and in fact the corporate headquarters is located on the premises. The décor could be described as Desert Modern or Desert Art Deco. It’s very impressive with enormous Swarofski crystal chandeliers featuring over 3 million pieces of crystal. Wikipedia describes the site as a “locals” casino, but if it is, it’s the most expensive and luxurious locals casino I’ve ever seen.\n\nThe Red Rock opened in 2006, at a cost of $930 million. It features a full casino with all the standard slots and table games, 11 restaurants, a 60-lane bowling alley, a 500 seat Bingo parlor, a 16 screen movie theatre, and a 3-acre (!) pool area and spa. The total casino area is 87,000 sq. feet, and the convention center has an area of 94,000 sq. feet. The total number of rooms is 815.\n\nThe Red Rock has a very understated, elegant style compared to most Las Vegas properties. I found it to be very classy, and it looks like the intention is to attract big corporate events. The property has a lot of appeal to those who would prefer to stay out of Vegas. There is an emphasis on amenities such as the spa, pool, hiking, and outdoor activities.\n\nI checked into the Red Rock for one night on July 2, 2009. This review is based on my experience.\n\nGambling\n\nAccording to the 2009 American Casino Guide, the Red Rock has 56,750 square feet of casino space. By way of comparison, the MGM has 2.75 times as much at 156,023. According to the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the Red Rock has 67 table games, 20 poker tables, and 2,890 slots. By way of comparison, the MGM Grand has 178 table games, 23 poker tables, and 2,470 slots. So, the Red Rock has more slots, and almost as many poker tables as the MGM. Here is a game by game table game count:\n\nBaccarat: 4\n\nBlackjack: 41\n\nCraps: 5\n\nLet it Ride: 1\n\nPai Gow Poker: 6\n\nRoulette: 5\n\nThree Card Poker: 2\n\nSeven Card Thrill: 1\n\nTexas Hold 'Em Bonus: 1\n\nCrazy 4 Poker: 1\n\nFollowing are some comments about some of the table game rules. The Wizard had to help me with this part.\n\nHotel\n\nThe cost of rooms averages about $75-125 depending on the day of the week and season. The Wiz paid $150 for my room (TY Wiz), but I suspect that to be higher than average owing to the fact that it was the 4th of July weekend. The package prices ranged from a one-night $75 family rate to a 3 night $699 concert package. There were other offers depending on what you like to do on vacation such as a spa/golf (2 nights $399), outdoors adventure (2 nights $520), or party in the Presidential Suite (1 night $600).\n\nMy 11th floor room had a beautiful view of the Strip and Downtown Vegas. The room has much the same feel as the rest of the property – tasteful reds and browns in a desert modern style. The bed had a pillow top mattress, and I counted 9 pillows of various shapes and sizes. There was a 45” Panasonic TV and a writing desk. In addition there was a fully stocked pay bar that included a disposable camera and an “intimacy kit”. I didn’t look inside the intimacy kit, but it looked big enough to hold about 10-15 condoms, which ought to be sufficient for one night of intimacy.\n\nThe bathroom had white marble floors and tub, a separate shower and toilet. There was a TV over the tub with remote plus a soft terrycloth robe. The bathroom was stocked with crystal glasses and several types of shampoo, soap and cologne. The overall effect is very luxurious and comfortable.\n\nLines\n\nBoth the cashier and player club had Wendy's style lines, where one line leads to multiple windows, which I applaud. However, the hotel check-in was confusing, evidently with one line per station.\n\nRestaurants\n\nThere are 11 restaurants on the property:\n\nHachi\n\nT-Bones Chop House\n\nTerra Rossa\n\nCabo Mexican Restaurant\n\nLBS: A Burger Joint\n\nGrand Café\n\nSalt Lick Bar B-Q\n\nTurf Grill\n\nFeast Buffet\n\nSand Bar\n\nQuick Serve Outlets (includes Starbucks)\n\nI ate in three of the restaurants, and had a really great experience in all of them. Here are my reviews:\n\nEntertainment\n\nThere were four bars and one disco inside the casino. The concert venue had an impressive summer lineup of country and country-rock bands such as Counting Crows, Jackson Browne, John Legend and Lynyrd Skynyrd. The Cherry Nightclub advertises “Ripe Young Singles Ready to be Plucked”. Sounds like it might be a good place for me to stay away from. There is also a 16-screen movie theatre and 72-lane bowling alley.\n\nPool and Spa\n\nThe Red Rock has an enormous pool and spa area, more than 3 acres. The spa offers all of the usual services – facials, Swedish massage, scalp massage, reflexology, aromatherapy, full body wraps, manicures, pedicures, etc. I didn’t have time to check prices, but I’m guessing they’re reasonable or maybe slightly more than similar services obtained on the outside. There were several different pools for children and adults, and also several Jacuzzis. One small complaint is that there were a lot of children in the pool on the day I observed it. I'm guessing that there were more than average because of the holiday weekend. The waitresses by the pool are wearing the smallest bikinis I’ve ever seen on a hotel employee.\n\nBob’s Review\n\nThis was by far the best Station Casino I’ve ever been in. The atmosphere is very classy, the architecture, interior design and furnishings are beautiful. The food is excellent and the staff is great. The Red Rock is perfect if you are looking for a quiet place to vacation, maybe with family. It’s far enough from the Strip to be a little quieter and not so touristy. The rooms are a major selling point because they’re beautifully appointed and well maintained. If you like outdoor activities, check the package deals, because it looked like there were some good prices.\n\nVPfree2.com entry\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nAddress: 11011 West Charleston Boulevard, Las Vegas, NV 89135\n\nPhone: 702-797-7777\n\nWeb site: redrocklasvegas.com\n\nGames at Red Rock\n\nBlackjackLocationDecksMinMaxSoft 17DADASRSASurrTablesCSMParty Pit6/5 BJVideoH.
