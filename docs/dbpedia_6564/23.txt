"Red Rock West" would probably have been on a lot of film critics' best-of lists last year -- if any of them had seen it. For some reason, though, no one could figure out a way to market this deliciously noirish film by director John Dahl, who wrote it with his brother Rick. It played overseas and has just come out on video, but after being rescued theatrically by a San Francisco art house, "Red Rock West" gets a belated showcase at the Key. It may now find the audience it clearly deserves.

The film bears some solid comparisons: to the Coen brothers' "Blood Simple" and "Raising Arizona" (but absent the overt artiness) and David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" and "Twin Peaks" (absent the surreal edges). The connections are underscored by the appearance of Coen/Lynch favorites Dennis Hopper, Nicolas Cage and Lara Flynn Boyle and a plot with so many twists, turns and loopy loops you'll be convinced it was conceived on a roller coaster ride by someone familiar with noir novelist Jim Thompson.
