        "text": "Drivers using the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Harbour Tunnel are likely to be charged both ways when a new motorway opens in 2026.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel - a second road tunnel underneath Sydney Harbour- will be tolled both ways.\n\n9NEWS understands the NSW Government is in discussions as to how to \"equalise\" the tolls across the new and existing crossings.\n\nIf the northbound trip on the existing Bridge and Tunnel stays free, drivers are likely to avoid the new road altogether.\n\nOne option being flagged within Transport for NSW is halving the cost of the toll, but applying it in both directions across all of the harbour crossings.\n\nConfidential documents leaked to Fairfax, shows the Northern Beaches Tunnel will start at The Wakehurst Parkway and Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation in Balgowlah.\n\nIt will travel to the Gore Hill Freeway at St Leonard's as well as the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney and to the Harbour Bridge.\n\nBalgowlah Golf Course will be acquired by the NSW Government as a construction site.\n\nJennifer Loveridge is shocked that her beloved club will be taken from the community.\n\n\"I've been here 38 years I don't want to leave here,\" Mrs Loveridge said.\n\n\"I wouldn't go anywhere else, I'll just rot at home.\"\n\nSources say the club has been trying to renew their lease with council and so far has been unsuccessful.\n\nCammeray Golf Club will also have half of the course taken to be used by civil contractors when work begins in 2021.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will link to the M4 and M5 at Rozelle. A second road crossing of Sydney Harbour will be built underneath Balmain and the lower North Shore and meet up at the Warringah Freeway.\n\nThe derelict Balmain Leagues Club site on Victoria Road at Rozelle will be acquired by the government as a construction site for the tunnel.\n\nThe site is rezoned for 12 stories, and the Balmain Tigers has space in the facility to re-establish their League Club.\n\nA development application is currently before Inner West Council and 9NEWS understands the government will have to pay in excess of $250 million to acquire the site.\n\n\"The government's plan to snatch this site will make the Tigers extinct.\" Inner West Mayor Darcy Byrne said.\n\nThe documents also confirm the exhaust stacks being built for the tunnels will not be filtered. This is after a 2008 speech by then Member for Willoughby, Gladys Berejiklian slamming the Labor Government for building the Lane Cove Tunnel without filtered stacks.\n\nThe government is confident airflow technology within the Northern Beaches and Western Harbour Tunnels will make the emissions safe.\n\nPremier Gladys Berejiklian wouldn't confirm the contents of the leaked documents dated May 2018, but it's understood they have not changed, and an official announcement is due this week.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to putting our plans forward to the community.\" Ms Berejiklian said.\n\nThe Labor Opposition has slammed the Northern Beaches Tunnel as a \"vanity project\" and has committed to walking away from it if elected. They are yet to announce a position on the Western Harbour Tunnel.\n\nConstruction on the roads are due to begin in 2020-21, with the roads opening in 2025-26."
