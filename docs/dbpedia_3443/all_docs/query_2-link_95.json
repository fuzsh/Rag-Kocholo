        "text": "Tolls on Sydney’s Harbour Bridge and Tunnel will increase for the first time in more than 14 years.\n\nMotorists will pay more from October 29, with tolls increasing by 6.8 per cent, as the NSW government looks to make the road system fairer.\n\nThe cost of using the bridge will rise from $4.00 to $4.27 during peak times, weekdays between 6.30- 9.30am and 4-7pm.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nOff-peak charges will go from $3.00 to $3.20, and from $2.50 to $2.67 at night.\n\nAll extra revenue will go to funding the government’s toll relief budget package which caps weekly toll costs at $60 for about 720,000 drivers.\n\nThe package is estimated to save motorists in the most tolled suburbs an average of up to $540 a year.\n\nRoads minister John Graham said it was appropriate to increase tolls to help cover the costs of road use elsewhere.\n\n“No toll increase is ever welcome, but this increase is helping to provide toll relief to other drivers,” he said.\n\n“Drivers in Western Sydney who have little choice but to use motorways for their commute and family travel have endured annual - and in many cases quarterly - toll increases since 2009 while the bridge and tunnel tolls remained fixed.”\n\nBridge and tunnel tolls are required by law to be reviewed annually but were not touched during the past twelve years of coalition government.\n\nMeanwhile the cost of using roads in the city’s west, many of which are owned by private company Transurban, has surged.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
