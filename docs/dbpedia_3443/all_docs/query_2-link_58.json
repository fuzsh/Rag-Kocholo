        "text": "SICE is pleased to announce the successful completion of the updates to TRARM and AVI for the Harbour Crossing Tolling Project (HCTP) in partnership with Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW). The project introduced an innovative solution for simultaneously processing toll data from new and legacy roadside systems to support the staggered delivery of the new HCTP toll points, marking a significant advancement in tolling technology for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel.\n\nAligned with the Warringah Freeway Upgrade Project – one of Australia’s busiest and most complex road corridors – that will improve transport capacity in and around Sydney Harbour, the HCTP aims to streamline the commuting experience for countless drivers every day while increasing efficiency and accuracy in toll collection for TfNSW.\n\nOn 6th December 2023, SICE achieved a key milestone by successfully implementing the TRARM and AVI to support the new HCTP roadside system, facilitating the smooth transition to process new roadside data, covering both the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. SICE’s comprehensive scope of work included the design, development, installation, integration, testing, training, and the decommissioning and commissioning of the TRARM system to interface with the relocated roadside system.\n\nSICE’s tolling solution TRARM (from Trip Reconstruction And Rating Module), based on SICE’s operational back office system, has been in operation since 2017 and has consistently demonstrated excellence in tolling collection and management optimisation in Sydney Harbour Bridge. The successful HCTP go-live represents a significant step forward for this Sydney’s vital infrastructure traffic management."
