        "text": "N ew South Wales motorists face paying $123 billion in road tolls over the next 40 years under a system that has encouraged higher than necessary pricing, a new report said.\n\nThat is one of the interim findings of an independent review by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chair Allan Fells and economist David Cousins into the state's road tolling system released today.\n\nIt provides a blueprint to overhaul the \"poorly functioning\" road system which is unfair and lacks consistency, according to the study.\n\nThe review highlights how toll operator Transurban holds a \"monopoly\" by its ownership of 11 of the 13 toll roads in NSW.\n\nBut one key solution to make the toll regimen fairer would hit the pockets of millions of motorists.\n\nUnder the reforms, commuters who use the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel as well as the Eastern Distributor daily would be charged a two-way toll for travelling on these routes.\n\nThe world's most expensive country revealed\n\nThe extra revenue raised would be spent to lower charges on the other toll roads.\n\nAnother proposed change would reduce tolls on motorcyclists and towed recreational vehicles, with the goal to reduce congestion on non-tolled roads.\n\nFells says the toll road system in NSW suffers from a lack of pricing competition.\n\n\"Toll prices in NSW seem to be very high. Competitive bidding for toll roads has not been based onprice.\n\n\"Unlike most businesses, once a toll price is established toll operators have a monopoly and toll prices are free from any price competition.\n\n\"There has been a tendency to set modest looking tolls at the outset when public attention is high and to heavily backload them via extended duration and escalation factors.\"\n\nSpeaking after the interim report's release, NSW Premier Chris Minns said the road tolling system was unfair but fixing it would be a major challenge.\n\n\"Sydney is the most tolled city in the world. And now we know trying to fix it requires a significant reset of the tolling network.\n\n\"The toll burden is hitting families who can least afford it most, particularly parts of western Sydney that have fewer public transport alternatives to getting in the car and paying tolls.\"\n\n\"It will take some time, but this interim report outlines some bold options for government to consider.\""
