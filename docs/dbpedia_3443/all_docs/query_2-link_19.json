        "text": "Yep, the rumours are true ‚Äì tolls for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel will increase next month for the first time in more than 14 years. Buckle up and we'll steer you through the answers to your questions.\n\nHow much are the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel tolls rising by?\n\nThe NSW government will lift Bridge and Tunnel tolls by 6.8 per cent. The last time the Bridge and Tunnel tolls were increased was in 2009, when they were set at $4 during peak times, $3 for off-peak and $2.50 at night. They‚Äôll increase to $4.27 in peak, $3.20 off peak and $2.67 at night.\n\nWhen are the Sydney Harbour Bridge tolls rising?\n\nYou‚Äôll pay the higher rate from October 29, 2023.\n\nWhy are the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel tolls rising?\n\n‚ÄúThe NSW Government believes it is appropriate for these tolls to be adjusted higher at a time when we are focused on providing greater equity across the toll road network, no matter what your postcode,‚Äù said NSW Minister for Roads John Graham.\n\n‚ÄúDrivers in Western Sydney who have little choice but to use motorways for their commute and family travel have endured annual ‚Äì and in many cases quarterly ‚Äì toll increases since 2009 while the Bridge and Tunnel tolls remained fixed.‚Äù\n\nThe Minister is referencing the fact that tolls on other roads (the M2, M4, M5, M5 East, the M7, M8, the Cross City Tunnel, the Lane Cove Tunnel, the North Connex and the Eastern Distributor) are owned by private owners, who have regularly increased tolls.\n\nThis leads us to one bit of good news‚Ä¶\n\nThe NSW government has introduced a weekly road toll cap for Sydney drivers:\n\nDue to the rising costs of toll increases by private owners of other roads for Sydney motorists, the NSW Government last week announced a $60 per week road toll cap.\n\nExtra revenue collected from the Harbour Bridge and Tunnel tolls will go towards the Government‚Äôs toll relief budget package worth $561 million over two years for 720,000 drivers.\n\nThe toll cap is designed to deliver most relief to people who live in Sydney‚Äôs west, who have been hit hardest by what the government refers to as ‚Äútoll mania‚Äù and don‚Äôt have access to as many public transport options.\n\n‚ÄúToll revenue is helping us target toll relief to where it is needed most, with suburbs like Kellyville, Silverwater, Blacktown, Quakers Hill, Rosehill and Gosford among those where the most motorists will claim cash back of an average of up to $540 a year. All extra revenue will be used to this end.‚Äù\n\nWhen is the NSW/Sydney weekly road toll cap starting?\n\nThe toll relief is beginning on January 1, 2023.\n\nHow will people claim road tolls above the cap?\n\nMotorists will be able to claim back any toll spending above the $60 a week cap via a quarterly refund from Service NSW.\n\nSo to head north you‚Äôll pay a bit more, but if you‚Äôre a regular driver on other toll roads, you‚Äôll get some relief.\n\nLooking for fun and food on a budget?\n\nüòä Here are 25 things to do for under $25\n\nüç∫ These are the best happy hours in Sydney"
