        "text": "Bridge and Tunnel tolls will be adjusted 6.8% higher as the NSW Government continues its agenda to bring greater equity to motorists across the system following last week's announcement of a $60 toll cap and the ongoing Independent Toll Review led by Professor Allan Fels.\n\nAll extra revenue will go to the Government's toll relief Budget package worth $561 million over two years to 720,000 drivers.\n\nThe last time the Bridge and Tunnel tolls were raised was in January 2009 and they have remained fixed at $4.00 during peak times, $3.00 off-peak and $2.50 at night.\n\nFrom Sunday, 29 October, that will become $4.27 in peak, $3.20 off peak and $2.67 at night.\n\nThe 6.8 per cent rise is a fraction of the CPI increase during the 14 years and seven months since the last adjustment. In the same period, motorists using privately-owned toll roads have faced regular toll hikes under motorway contracts.\n\nThanks to the Liberals' obsession with privatisation, one company owns all or part of the M2, M4, M5, M5 East, the M7, M8, the Cross City Tunnel, the Lane Cove Tunnel, the North Connex and the Eastern Distributor.\n\nThe adjustment will be made by Ministerial Order under the Roads Act 1993.\n\nBridge and Tunnel tolls are required by law to be reviewed annually and the recommended increase must have regard to the recent rate of inflation. For twelve years the former government refused to increase the toll.\n\nMinister for Roads John Graham said:\n\n\"No toll increase is ever welcome, but this increase is helping to provide toll relief to other drivers.\n\n\"The NSW Government believes it is appropriate for these tolls to be adjusted higher at a time when we are focused on providing greater equity across the toll road network, no matter what your postcode.\n\n\"Drivers in Western Sydney who have little choice but to use motorways for their commute and family travel have endured annual - and in many cases quarterly - toll increases since 2009 while the Bridge and Tunnel tolls remained fixed.\n\n\"Toll revenue is helping us target toll relief to where it is needed most, with suburbs like Kellyville, Silverwater, Blacktown, Quakers Hill, Rosehill and Gosford among those where the most motorists will claim cash back of an average of up to $540 a year. All extra revenue will be used to this end.\""
