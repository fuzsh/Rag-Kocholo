        "text": "From 2020 a return trip across Sydney Harbour Bridge could cost drivers $6 (it’s currently around $3). The new price was detailed in leaked New South Wales Cabinet documents, as reported by Fairfax. The new toll, if implemented, will also apply to the Harbour Tunnel.\n\nDrivers using the Harbour Bridge or Harbour Tunnel currently only pay tolls one way, on southbound journeys. This charge fluctuates throughout the day; it is either $3 or $4 from 6.30am to 7pm, and $2.50 for journeys between 7pm and 6.30am.\n\nThe documents also detail a new $8 fee to use the new multi-billion-dollar tunnels that will link the inner west to the northern beaches.\n\nNever miss a Sydney moment. Make sure you're subscribed to our newsletter today.\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\n\nRoads Minister Melinda Pavey couldn’t give a firm answer on whether the new tolls would be implemented. The ABC reports her saying: “We haven’t decided how these tolls are going to look because we haven’t come to final decisions.”\n\nThe toll surge is an attempt to fund the $14 billion cost of the proposed Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link, from Rozelle to Balgowlah.\n\nMotorists will pay a $5 fee for taking the Beaches Link between Warringah Freeway and Balgowlah. The total cost to travel from Rozelle to the Northern Beaches could be $8 one way or $16 return. Trucks will pay three times as much as cars."
