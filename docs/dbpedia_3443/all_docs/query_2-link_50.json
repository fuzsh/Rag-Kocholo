        "text": "Transport for NSW (TfNSW) facilitates end to end management of the NSW motorways network by overseeing the development, delivery and operations of motorways with valued partners.\n\nOur aim is to deliver a faster, easier, safer and more reliable motorways network for people travelling by private vehicles or public transport.\n\nToll road operation in NSW is governed through the granting of concessions by TfNSW, on behalf of the State through the requisite Ministerial directions, in respect to each toll road.\n\nTfNSW grants a concession to the concessionaire to operate (including by collecting tolls from drivers) and maintain the motorway for a certain period before handing the motorway back to TfNSW, however TfNSW remains the owner of the motorway at all times.\n\nSome examples of motorways delivered under the model are the Hills M2 Motorway, Westlink M7 Motorway, Lane Cove Tunnel, Cross City Tunnel, Eastern Distributor and the M5 South West Motorway.\n\nOur tolling business –the TfNSW E-Toll business –is the largest tolling account provider in NSW with over 1.4 million accounts. E-Toll also manages toll payments and processing functions on behalf of Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel, and toll settlement processes for all motorways for travel made by the E-Toll customers. We also ensure tolling compliance across the network."
