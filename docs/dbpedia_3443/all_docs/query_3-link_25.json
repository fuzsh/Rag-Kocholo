In Sydney Australia we have many different toll roads, some offer cash back and most don't, some are distance based toll road and some are fixed price regardless of the length of the road. With the distance based toll roads an entry point a few hundred metres apart can cost you a couple of dollars every trip, multiple that a few trips every day then every week it will quickly add up!!\n\nSo It would be great if we could choose which individual toll roads we want to use and also which entry points.\n\nThank you for your time",
