        "text": "Much like my ripping yarn on Italy, my Australian highways page is more a storage site for holiday snaps, but there's enough here to make it veritably part of my roadgeek collection. A few acknowledgements; I am indebted to my \"dear mum\" for knowing whom to call and helping me set the initial 2003 trip all up. I'm also very greatly indebted to her friend Rosetta for taking the time to show me the sights in Sydney, to her other friend Robin W. for putting me up and driving me around Canberra (and tolerating me photographing all those silly signs) and from Canberra back to Sydney, and to my wonderful aunt Marie and wonderful uncle Dennis, who put me up in their hotel in Merriwa, had delicious dinners and a lovely time, and particularly since uncle Dennis drove me all the way from the Sydney airport to Merriwa, then to Dubbo, and then to Canberra, all in his indefatigable Land Rover with his nutty nephew photographing just about everything out the passenger window. Thank you all for showing me the sights and I had a wonderful time!\n\nIn the fall of 2008 (well, technically the spring in Australia), my folks went to Australia again and did some sightseeing in the interior and northern coast. Thanks to their diligence in taking locator shots, I can now supplement this exhibit with some additional photographs of roads and highways many native Australians themselves haven't traveled.\n\nAustralia is an important country to me since I'm dual American and Australian citizenship (my mother grew up in Ashfield, in Sydney NSW), and obviously my mother's side of the family still lives there. The pictures in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory were taken in April 2003, and the pictures in South Australia, Northern Territory and (a little bit of) Queensland were taken in September 2008.\n\nAmerican roadgeeks and Australian roadgeeks will find many similarities between their respective highway signage systems. Most of them use typefaces very similar to the American MUTCD standard fonts, and signage colours and guidelines are likewise reminiscent of each other. There are even some interesting analogies in the broad divisions of highway types (including a startling historical use of American Interstate-like signage, now defunct), which include(d):\n\nNational Routes, the original national highway system now in twilight, analogous to the American \"US highway\" system in importance, scope, history and road type (generally improved/sealed through-roads);\n\nNational Highways, eclipsing the National Routes after their introduction in 1974 (in many cases an old National Route will be re-signed with a National Highway shield when selected for upgrading), analogous to the American Interstate system, although the majority are not controlled-access freeway standard; however, all are sealed through-roads, and many are dual-carriageway configuration;\n\nand various state highways which vary between generally improved through-roads to actual freeways of local or provincial scope and, like in the American system, are wholly maintained by the state. Interestingly, unlike American state routes where shields vary widely, all state shields are a standard white on blue, in a uniform shield shape.\n\nPaul Rands, who has sent me several glowing E-mails about the remainder of Roadgap (please! I'm blushing!), maintains Expressway, which focuses specifically on road signs and photographs of these types of routes. You can also get MUTCD-like sign samples there too.\n\nHistorically, roads were a function of local state governments only. The concept of a federal highway system did not enter the field until the 1950s, after a domestic expansionist policy during WW2 had yielded significant amounts of improved road infrastructure originally for facilitating wartime transport. To test the concept, Australia's first National Route was signed in 1954, the Hume Hwy (NR, now NH, 31), as a field trial using wooden trailblazers with button copy. This was so well received that three more routes after that were signed, including NR 1 (the Pacific Hwy and the Princes Hwy) from Adelaide to Brisbane, NR 15 (New England Hwy) from Hexham to Brisbane, and NR 20 (Sturt Hwy) from the Hume Hwy to Adelaide. All numbers in the National Route system (and thus National Highway system, more in a moment) are two-digit; although intended to be a grid system with odd numbers N-S and even numbers W-E, this went by the wayside rapidly and the numbers in use now do not in general reflect this rule.\n\nDuring the rise of the National Route system, John Renshaw, NSW's minister of highways, would propose an even greater augmented national arterial network in 1956, facilitating fast linkages between major centres. By 1974, Renshaw's plan was fleshed out into the 10,500-mile National Highway system, adopting existing National Routes and other highways into a nationally maintained infrastructure plan. Not just any route qualified; National Highways have strict standards, including a) being sealed minimum one-lane-per-direction all weather roads 20-24' wide with 6' shoulders; b) minimal length of \"low-speed\" sections; c) safety standards for visibility and passing; and d) having termini at a capital city (Cairns and Burnie were given specific exception), or allowing linkages from Canberra into the system. In the years following, a rapid expansion plan commenced to bring up the highways so designated to the standards set for them. The peak of the National Highway system came in 1986, when the last portion of the Great Northern Hwy was sealed and thus inaugurated Australia's first circumcontinental all-weather route, NH/NR 1. (Highway 1 is also the world's longest continuous-designation route, coming in at over 8,700 miles [14523km], but it may lose this title because of urban gaps introduced subsequently such as A21 in Adelaide -- more on that in a moment.)\n\nMany cities have their own specific networks. Melbourne's is probably the most famous, its \"Metro\" system being the first major freeway network (legislated in 1969). Freeway planners from the USA advised the Victorian government and Victorian civil engineers went to the USA to study the American system, yielding freeway architecture that many American drivers would find familiar, and would set the standards for other urban freeway networks to come. For their respective parts, Sydney and Brisbane have Metroads, derived from partial local routings of state and national routes, consisting of city-specific beltway and radial highways and freeways designed to facilitate easy destination-oriented navigation; Canberra and ACT have coloured Tourist Route signage that allows designated access to popular termini. Part of this may have had to do with an early policy that denied federal funding to freeways within five miles of a city centre.\n\nAs with everything else in life, however, this signing system is shortly due to change. In 1997, a meeting of state and federal ministers of transportation yielded a new uniform numbering system loosely modeled on the alphanumeric format used in Europe and the UK (see the Italy page for a few brief examples of the European highway network). This new signing system, however, has had an uneven transition. While Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria have already done the conversion, New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory are still only just in progress and/or planning stages, and there was some question over whether Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory would do so at all (although it seems they will eventually based on the language of the council resolution, the process does not seem imminent). These routes will carry a single letter (\"M\"ain, indicating dual-carriageway freeways, and highways forming principal links between key cities; or A, B or C, indicating, in order, routes of greater to lesser prominence consisting of non-freeway through-routes), and then the route number, preserving where possible any National Highway and Route numbers replaced, and, in many cases, any applicable state route number. Guidelines for continuity across state borders are also part of the standard.\n\nEven the mighty National Highway system now has had its legs kicked out from under it; as of June 2005, it ceased to be the federal highway system of Australia and was replaced by a new system known as Auslink. In some ways its distinctiveness has already been lost, as the new alphanumeric highway shields in many areas use the National Highway colour scheme and obliterate the contrast between the glorified National Highways and other National Routes; moreover, when New South Wales does its conversion in the future, it will not be using National Highway shields at all, and probably others will follow suit thus condemning the National Route and Highway systems to historical obscurity. When I return to my other home country in the future, it will be very fascinating to note these and other changes that have occurred since.\n\nI have also included various touristy snaps I enjoyed, so put up with them too, if you would."
