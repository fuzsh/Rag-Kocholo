        "text": "The NSW government could use legislation to set road toll increases rather than negotiating them with private operators, says a review that recommends a state-owned authority be created to “take back control” of a network slugging motorists more than $2 billion a year.\n\nThe Minns government is on a potential collision course with toll road giant Transurban after the interim report of a major review found the state’s motorists would shell out $195 billion on tolls to 2060, in some cases paying three times the cost of building the road on which they were driving."
