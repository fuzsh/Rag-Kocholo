        "text": "Tens of thousands of motorists a day will have to pay extra in tolls if the state government decides to impose two-way charging on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel, as well as the Eastern Distributor, raising hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue.\n\nFigures from the state’s transport agency show about 63,000 northbound trips a day are made on average on the Harbour Bridge and 42,000 on the 2.7-kilometre Harbour Tunnel. Southbound trips on the Eastern Distributor averaged about 60,000 trips a day last year.\n\nAt present, only southbound motorists on the government-owned and operated Harbour Bridge and Tunnel, and northbound journeys on the privately run Eastern Distributor, are charged. The motorways are frequently used by north shore, northern beaches and eastern suburbs residents.\n\nA review led by former competition watchdog chairman Allan Fels has recommended bidirectional tolls on the three motorways, arguing it would make Sydney’s tolling system fairer and allow extra revenue to be redistributed to help lower charges elsewhere.\n\nBased on the current tolling for the three motorways, more than $350 million a year could be raised if charges were imposed on the non-tolled sections.\n\nHowever, the Fels review calls for a new system of network tolls across Sydney, which would lead to motorists being charged progressively less the further they drove. If adopted, it would alter both the traffic and revenue forecasts for the Harbour Bridge, Tunnel and Eastern Distributor.\n\nThe Minns government increased southbound tolls by 6.8 per cent on the Harbour Bridge and Tunnel last October, which was the first time they had been raised since 2009. They are now $4.27 in peak periods, $3.20 off-peak and $2.67 at night.\n\nBy comparison, tolls on Sydney’s privately operated motorways rise quarterly or annually. WestConnex tolls rise annually by the rate of inflation or 4 per cent, whichever is greater. The Fels review calculated that motorists will pay a collective $64 billion (in today’s dollars) over the next 37 years if the status quo remains.\n\nTolls on the Eastern Distributor are $9.38 for cars and $18.76 for trucks. The six-kilometre motorway is one of 13 toll roads in Sydney controlled and operated by Transurban.\n\nMacquarie’s analysts said the rush by the government on Monday to rule out scrapping refunds for motorists who use the M5 motorway in Sydney’s south-west highlighted the political constraints of reform.\n\n“It is ultimately the toughest issue for government in any reform; namely, there will be winners and losers,” they said.\n\nIllustrating the political risk if Fels’ plans are adopted, charges for cars on the M7 motorway in Sydney’s west would increase on average by 9 per cent without a toll relief scheme. However, if the subsidy was in place, it would fall by almost 8 per cent.\n\nThe M7 is Transurban’s largest toll road by volume of traffic in Sydney after WestConnex, averaging 196,000 vehicle trips a day.\n\nThe analysts were not surprised by the proposal for two-way tolling on the Harbour Bridge and Tunnel, as well as the Eastern Distributor, saying they anticipated it would have to be done by the time the $7.8 billion Western Harbour Tunnel between Rozelle and North Sydney opens in 2028.\n\nInternal documents have previously revealed Transurban warned the then Coalition government in late 2019 that construction of the Western Harbour Tunnel would not be financially viable unless tolls on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and existing motorway tunnel rose significantly.\n\nEarly analysis in Fels’ interim report says Sydney’s north shore and eastern suburbs might be worse off if the tolling proposals were adopted because motorists from those areas were likely to be affected by the two-way charging on the Harbour Bridge, Tunnel and Eastern Distributor.\n\nLoading\n\nHowever, the analysis suggests the proposed network tolling was favourable for motorists in Sydney’s north, south and west. Fels has said the initial shake-up would aim to collect the same total revenue from motorists and generate the same total revenue for toll operators.\n\nModelling shows the average tolls paid by cars and motorcycles under Fels’ network tolling plans would be $7.33 a journey in 2026, compared with $8.50 if no changes occur. If a subsidy was introduced to lower tolls for all motorists, the average price would be $6.19.\n\nThe tolls would include infrastructure charges ranging from 50¢ to $6 when using the Harbour Bridge or major motorway tunnels.\n\nOne of Fel’s main recommendations is that the government legislate to create a state-owned authority to set tolls across Sydney’s motorway network and ensure greater market competition."
