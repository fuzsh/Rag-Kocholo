        "text": "Tolls on Sydney's Harbour Bridge and Tunnel will increase for the first time in more than 14 years.\n\nMotorists will pay more from October 29, with tolls increasing by 6.8 per cent, as the NSW government looks to make the road system fairer.\n\nThe cost of using the bridge will rise from $4.00 to $4.27 during peak times on weekdays between 6.30-9.30am and 4-7pm.\n\nOff-peak charges will go from $3.00 to $3.20, and from $2.50 to $2.67 at night.\n\nAll extra revenue will go to funding the government's toll relief budget package which caps weekly toll costs at $60 for about 720,000 drivers.\n\nThe package is estimated to save motorists in the most tolled suburbs an average of up to $540 a year.\n\nPremier Chris Minns noted there had not been any increases of the Harbour Bridge toll since 2009.\n\n\"We'd rather not charge anything of course,\" Mr Minns said.\n\n\"But if it's fair and reasonable and equitably split, no matter where you live in metropolitan Sydney, I think most taxpayers in NSW would say, well, that's a reasonable outcome.\"\n\nRoads Minister John Graham said it was appropriate to increase tolls to help cover the costs of road use elsewhere.\n\n\"No toll increase is ever welcome, but this increase is helping to provide toll relief to other drivers,\" he said.\n\n\"Drivers in western Sydney who have little choice but to use motorways for their commute and family travel have endured annual - and in many cases quarterly - toll increases since 2009 while the bridge and tunnel tolls remained fixed.\"\n\nBridge and tunnel tolls are required by law to be reviewed annually but were not touched during the past 12 years of coalition government.\n\nThe cost of using toll roads in the city's west, many of which are owned by private company Transurban, surged during that time.\n\nOpposition roads spokesperson Natalie Ward said the government was increasing tolls to pay for unfunded budget promises.\n\n\"This government gives with one hand and takes with the other,\" Ms Ward said."
