        "text": "Planning on using tollways?\n\nIn Australia:\n\nAustralia has a significant number of toll roads in particular Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney all of which are cashless. Tolls vary dependant on the road used and the length of the journey. If a Customer travels through a toll collection point, the Customers credit card will be charged for the toll and an administration fee of A$1.30 per Toll (excludes GST). The charge can be delayed by up to a month or more dependent on when the notification is received by us from the toll road operator.\n\nCan I bring my own device?\n\nCustomers may bring their own device but if you bring your own device you do risk being charged twice. You can pre-pay your toll charges by purchasing a Toll Pass Waiver at time of collection. In NSW the daily fee is A$50 (excluding GST, Commercial Vehicles). In VIC the daily fee is A$22.50 (excluding GST, PLF & Admin Fee). In SE QLD & ACT the daily fee is A$18.50 (excluding GST, PLF & Admin Fee).\n\nPlease note: Redspot is not responsible for collecting or paying Toll Road fees. If Redspot receives an infringement an administration fee will apply on top of the toll road charge cost and will be charged/billed to your nominated rental account."
