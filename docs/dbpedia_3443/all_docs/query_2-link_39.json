        "text": "Sydney has a long toll network; roughly 110km of the freeway network is tolled. This can be expensive and frustrating to commuters, regardless of how much time may be saved. In almost all cases, however, there is a faster route that can be taken, which is generally not as long. These are most preferable to tourists or those who don’t use the route often.\n\nAll toll roads in Sydney are cashless. You can only play electronically.\n\nCan I pay with cash on Sydney’s Motorways?\n\nNo. All of Sydney’s tolled motorways are cashless. You cannot pay tolls on a motorway without a toll tag or pass.\n\nWhat is a toll tag?\n\nA toll tag is the more standard payment system. An electronic tag can be detected once you pass underneath a toll gantry, with the corresponding payment subtracted from your account. This is the most desirable method of payment.\n\nOne toll tag can be used on any Sydney motorway, regardless of its brand\n\nWhat is a toll pass?\n\nAlternatively to a toll tag, a toll pass may be used. This is best for tourists, and allows the number plate to be recorded by cameras if a tag has not been detected after passing underneath the toll booth. The toll payment will then be made to the account you registered with. There is a $1.50 surcharge alongside a $0.75 processing fee for each toll road used attached, which may not be worth the money or hassle. Hence, you may wish to drive on a free alternate route as a visitor.\n\nPurchase your toll tag and toll pass here.\n\nGood news; a toll tag from any other city in Australia will still work in Sydney\n\nWhat if I have a tag from another city in Australia eg; Go-Via?\n\nDon’t worry; regardless of which city you buy your toll from (Melbourne and Brisbane are the only two other cities with tolls), you can use it in Sydney. Toll tag are universal; they will work in any city; Sydney tags work in Melbourne, Brisbane tags work in Sydney, and vice versa.\n\nRemember that Transurban owns almost all of Australia’s toll roads, and hence a universal tag has been allowed to exist, including for those roads that Transurban doesn’t own.\n\nWhat if I use the motorway without a tag or pass?\n\nIf you do not have a toll tag, your licence plate will be recorded. Your registration will be used to send you a notice to pay the toll plus an admin fee (about $10). Failure to pay this may incur a Penalty Notice which could result in a court appeal. All over a small toll; just pay the toll!\n\nHow do I know if the road I am on is tolled?\n\nIt is safe to assume that it is tolled; almost all motorways in Sydney are tolled.\n\nIn Sydney, a yellow toll sticker will be present on the sign as you enter the freeway. This tells a motorist whether a toll needs to be paid on the road or not. If there is no sticker, it is not tolled. For example, on the sign on the right a TOLL sticker is next to the M7 marker as this road is tolled.\n\nIf the road you are on becomes a toll road after a certain exit, there is usually a sign that clearly denotes this so you may exit to avoid the toll if you wish.\n\nSydney does not have yellow-on-blue signage for toll roads. Only Melbourne does.\n\nCan I just avoid toll roads altogether?\n\nYes, you definitely can. Alternate routes to each tolled motorway that do not involve tolls have been specifically outlined below. These routes are slower, so do allow extra time to travel on these routes. For the best directions on avoiding toll roads in Sydney, use Google Maps, ensuring you select the \"avoid tolls\" setting in the app or website.\n\nThere is only one route that you cannot avoid paying a toll on, and that is crossing the famous Sydney Harbour. Both the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel are tolled."
