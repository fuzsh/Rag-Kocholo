        "text": "A Mosman councillor has lodged a notice of motion, calling on local leaders to reject a Minns Government proposal for two-way tolling on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel.\n\nCouncillor Roy Bendall is also urging for the removal of the Military Rd e-ramp toll, saying it is “effectively a super tax” on residents of the lower north shore.\n\nHis notice of motion will be heard at Tuesday’s Mosman Council meeting, requesting that:\n\nCouncil writes to the Minns Government rejecting the proposal for 2-way tolling on the Harbour Bridge and Harbour tunnel and seeks a dialogue to discuss equity for our residents.\n\nThat Council calls on the Minns Government to scrap the Military Rd e-ramp toll on the basis of equity, as the toll rate is effectively a super tax on the Mosman and lower North Shore communities.\n\n“The Independent Toll Review, released last month and overseen by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chairman Allan Fels is welcome in that some serious work is being done to mitigate the politics and commercial control over the tolling system,” Councillor Bendall said in his submission.\n\n“However … it appears that the proposals being suggested for two way tolling for the Harbour Bridge and Harbour tunnels will have a further deleterious cost effect on our community.\n\n“The cost of living crisis is hurting all communities, yet we are being asked to further subsidise infrastructure, not on a user pay system but an electoral system. It is not a stretch of belief that two-way tolling will only lead to increased costs.\n\n“The Government should be in the business of fairness – not playing favourites with electorates.”\n\nCouncillor Bendall said the local area continues to be “choked” by traffic congestion, with no sign of respite after the Beaches Link Tunnel plans were scrapped.\n\n“Tolling on the Harbour Bridge started in 1932, and the bridge itself was paid off in 1988” he said.\n\nIn 1987, the toll rose sharply from 20c to $1.00, to provide funds for construction of the Harbour Tunnel, and in March 1989 they were hiked again, to $1.50.\n\n“It was increased to $2.20 in July 2000, followed by another 80 cents’ increase to $3 in January 2002,” Councillor Bendall said, “and we now have time-based tolling with a maximum of $4.”\n\nThe Military Rd e-ramp (Falcon street Gateway) built in 2007, costs $2.02 to travel 200m, making it one of the most expensive tolls in the world.\n\n“At that price, it equates to $10 per kilometre being gouged from motorists,” Councillor Bendall said, “the brunt of which is being paid by our community despite the ramp being paid off.”\n\nYou can view Tuesday’s monthly Council meeting online by heading to webcast here at 7pm sharp."
