We pay our respects to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and to elders both past and present.\n\nConnecting Sydney\n\nWestConnex is Australiaâs largest road infrastructure project and central to our vision to better connect people and businesses across New South Wales. WestConnex is helping motorists move around Sydney safer, easier and faster, while delivering a major economic boost by creating thousands of jobs. Customers are experiencing significant travel time savings on the M4, M8 and M5 East. The M4 has led to travel time savings of up to 56 minutes, and with one third of traffic taken off Parramatta Road, local air quality has improved by 10â15%. The M8 provides travel time savings of up to 30 minutes between Liverpool and Sydneyâs southern CBD, and has significantly improved the M5 East, with traffic moving 60% faster and 40% less crashes. The full benefits of WestConnex are yet to come, with the completion of the âmissing linkâ the M4-M5 Tunnels and Rozelle Interchange. WestConnex is not just about roads, it is delivering 18 hectares of open space for the community, more than a million trees, shrubs and plants, as well as 23 kilometres of new and improved shared paths for local neighbourhoods to enjoy. We are excited to be delivering this once in a generation project for the city we love, and look forward to Sydneysiders benefitting for decades to come.\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\nWestConnex M8 Motorway opens.

After almost three years of work on the WestConnex M4-M5 Link Tunnels excavation is now complete with 22 kilometres of tunnels and ramps now carved out and ready for paving. The tunnels will help slash up to 40 minutes from an average peak journey between Parramatta and Sydney Airport and also connect to future Projects including the Western Harbour Tunnel and the M6. Future projects being carried out by Transport for NSW Subject to planning approval Existing road and motorway Delivered by the NSW Government WestConnex is one of the most ambitious single road projects in Australiaâs history and in just less than 10 years, 40% of Sydneyâs population is expected to live within five kilometres of this network. Itâs 33 kilometres of new and improved motorways and tunnels provide motorists with a continuous, traffic-light-free motorway network, that connects Sydneyâs west and southwest suburbs with the CBD, Sydney Airport and Port Botany. It also provides for future projects linking the north shore and northern beaches.\n\nFIVE DOCK\n\nCross City Tunnel\n\nHOMEBUSH\n\nROZELLE\n\nSYDNEY CBD\n\nBURWOOD\n\nGLEBE\n\nSTRATHFIELD\n\nHABERFIELD\n\nLEICHHARDT\n\nSURRY HILLS\n\nEastern Distributor\n\nCAMPERDOWN\n\nCHULLORA\n\nASHFIELD\n\nM4-M5 Link Eight lanes Opening 2023\n\nALEXANDRIA\n\nM1\n\nKing Georges Road Interchange Opened 2016\n\nCAMPSIE\n\nST PETERS\n\nBANKSTOWN\n\nEARLWOOD\n\nMASCOT\n\nM5 East\n\nROSELANDS\n\nM5 South West\n\nPUNCHBOWL\n\nSydney Gateway^\n\nSYDNEY AIRPORT\n\nM5\n\nBOTANY\n\nARNCLIFFE\n\nFour lanes Opened 2020 M8\n\nEntry and exit point Surface road Tunnel\n\nRIVERWOOD\n\nREVESBY\n\nSouthern Cross Drive M1\n\nBEVERLEY HILLS\n\nFuture projects being carried out by Transport for NSW\n\nM6 Stage 1^\n\nHURSTVILLE\n\nSubject to planning approval Existing road and motorway Delivered by the NSW Government\n\nPORT BOTANY\n\nMore than two thirds of WestConnex is being built underground\n\nI worked out that we bypass more than 20 traffic lights using the M8 instead of the Princess Highway.

We recognise the importance of offering our customers a choice about the route they take and have digital calculators available on the Transurban Linkt customer website so motorists can weigh up the benefits of taking a toll road over the free alternative. Creating jobs More than 40,000 workers have been involved in delivering WestConnex, boosting job opportunities across a range of industries. The project will create an estimated more than $20 billion in benefits to the state, with around 2,000 contracts signed with NSW subcontractors and suppliers to date. More than 40% of the 10,500 workers involved in the M4-M5 Link Tunnels, which are currently being constructed, are from Western Sydney. Around 510 contracts, worth more than $950 million, have been signed with NSW subcontractors and suppliers on that Project. Over the Project lifespan, WestConnex is creating 500 apprenticeships. Our M4 and M8 delivery partners established the WestConnex Training Academy at Homebush in partnership with providers such as TAFE NSW. The academy focuses on quality, recognised training for workers including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, women, young people and school leavers, Western Sydney residents and people with disabilities. This training is continuing with similar programs offered on the M4-M5 Link Tunnels Project.\n\nBenefits for freight industry and environment Around 80% of freight in Greater Sydney is moved by road and the WestConnex network provides critical connections to ports, airports and intermodal terminals. WestConnex provides considerable benefits for heavy vehicles, by avoiding stop/start traffic. This offers significant operating cost savings, increased safety, reduced fuel consumption, greater travel-time reliability, smoother travel and less wear and tear on the vehicle. Giving streets back to communities With thousands of heavy vehicles a day using the M4 Tunnels and and no longer driving on local streetsâa trip on Parramatta Road is now much faster.\n\nFor local communities that means less noise and improved safety in their neighbourhood. Air quality on Paramatta Road has improved by 10-15% as a direct result of the M4 Tunnel opening and less stop start traffic on surface roads. Construction of WestConnex also paved the way for transformation and regeneration opportunities across local communities. The M8, which opened in 2020, has been a catalyst for the renewal and reuse of one of Sydneyâs most under-utilised sites, the former Alexandria landfill. The former rubbish tip has undergone extensive remediation works in preparation for the construction of St Peters Interchange. The St Peters Interchange site includes around 6 hectares of open space with another 2.5 hectares being returned to the community after the M4-M5 Link Tunnels open in 2023.\n\n6 | WestConnext Community Overview\n\nWestConnext Community Overview | 7\n\nAward recipient Awarded NSW Premierâs Award 2020 (Strong Economy category).

Tunnelling is now complete, with 8.7 million tonnes of spoil removed, almost 22 kilometres of tunnels and ramps carved out and over 10,500 workers involved in the project to date. With road paving complete and the mechanical and electrical fit out at 60% complete, the project is well on track to open in 2023. The tunnels will be approximately 7.5km long and accommodate up to four lanes of traffic in each direction.\n\nMurals at St Peters Partnered with Inner West Council to deliver three large murals on the walls of St Peters businesses, part of the local fabric of the inner west area\n\n8 | WestConnext Community Overview\n\nA greener, better-connected community We recognise that building major infrastructure projects in urban environments can have significant impacts on communities. WestConnex is committed to minimising and mitigating against these impacts wherever possible. In addition to on the ground community consultation, WestConnex participates in a number of important community initiatives.\n\nPublic art The WestConnex Canal to Creek Public Art Program showcases 18 commissioned artworks, enhancing new and existing parklands between Beverly Hills and St Peters. Featuring artist-designed playgrounds, large-scale murals and immersive lighting installations, a writerâs walk and contemporary sculpture. The art trail is a cultural legacy for the community to enjoy. Canal to Creek to classroom Inspired by its public art program, we have developed an interactive education arts portal for high school students, which aligns with the NSW Visual Arts curriculum. The portal enables students to engage with 360 degree imagery of the Canal to Creek artwork, learn directly from acclaimed artists about how their works were created and access other interactive resources. WestConnex partnered with the Visual Arts Design Educators Association (VADEA) to deliver the initiative, which Co-President Nicole DeLosa said has ensured public art is accessible to students, no matter where they live. Visit the portal: canaltocreek.com âWe believe that the WestConnex Public Art Portal is one of the most innovative and exciting educational experiences weâve seen. The portal delivers a truly relevant and unique approach to interact with these commissioned artworks in a relevant and engaging way.â\n\nPartnerships We invest in partnerships to support and strengthen communities. WestConnexâs partnership with Western Sydney road safety educator, the Blue Datto Foundation has enabled more than 25,000 students to participate in its award-winning road safety program, âKeeping Safeâ, ensuring vital education remains accessible to young people who are some of the most at-risk on NSW roads. Open spaces WestConnex is providing more than 18 hectares of new and revitalised open space, and planting around 1 million new plants along the Project corridor. Almost 6,000 homes are now within a 10 minute walk of Ismay Reserve, a previously unused corridor in Sydneyâs west which has been transformed into a popular new public recreation space. An artist-designed playground at Simpson Park in St Peters and a pocket park with active transport links in Haberfield have also provided new open spaces for local families and residents to enjoy.\n\nCycleways 23 kilometres of pedestrian and cycle paths will be delivered as part of WestConnex. In 2020, the Campbell Street Green Link was extended via a new toll-free bridge as part of the WestConnex M8, providing a new shared path connection between St Peters and the growing Mascot precinct. Grants Over the past five years, 318 WestConnex community grants have been awarded to local organisations across western Sydney. These grants have directly benefited more than 155,000 people and provide lasting outcomes for communities. These grants help deliver a range of legacy Projects, including STEM and sports equipment for schools, education programs, new facilities to assist people living with disabilities, sustainability initiatives and heritage restoration projects.\n\nNicole DeLosa Co-President VADEA\n\n10 | WestConnext Community Overview\n\nWestConnext Community Overview | 11\n\nFor more information\n\nCall 1800 660 248 , email info@westconnex.com.au or visit westconnex.com.au\n\nVisit a WestConnex local information centre M4-M5 Link Tunnels 201-205 Parramatta Road, Haberfield Rozelle Interchange 84 Lilyfield Road, Rozelle\n\nWe speak your language\n\nVisit westconnex.com.au Need an interpreter?
