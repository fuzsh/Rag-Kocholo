        "text": "If you are driving on Australian toll roads in a hire car, youâll be responsible for paying any toll costs. Most of our car hire partners fit their vehicles with e-Tags, which automatically cover the price of any tolls during your journey, so donât pay these costs in advance, via Linkt, or by any means not outlined by your car rental provider as otherwise you could end up paying one toll twice. Toll roads in Australia do not accept cash.\n\nDo car hire providers charge extra for using toll roads?\n\nEach car rental provider has its own conditions for toll payment. Some use e-Tags, others offer the option of paying for tolls in advance where, for example, you can pay for unlimited toll use for a day. Many attach a supplementary charge for tolls â either on a per-toll or per-day basisâand these charges can add up quickly if youâre using toll roads frequently. Furthermore, rental providers may charge you additional administration fees for any unpaid tolls. Due to these factors, if youâre planning on using toll roads, it is important to clarify with your rental car provider what their toll charge structure is when you pick up your hire car.\n\nHow much do road tolls in Australia cost to use?\n\nDepending on the toll road, toll charges can vary according to the particular toll road, distance travelled, vehicle type, time of day, and payment method used. And to repeat, toll roads in Australia do not accept cash payments.\n\nWhere are there toll roads in Australia?"
