        "text": "Physical Description\n\nThe coin collecting mechanism consists of a metal plate (platen) on which the coins are dropped by a feeder that leads from the collection basket. The platen spins and coins drop into slots specifically cut for each denomination. The coins are then given an electrical charge, which is read by a sensor. Because each denomination has its own signature, the coins are then verified and drop down into the vault. The vault sits beneath the coin collector, and consists of two coin drawers in a heavy case. The drawers have a one-way locking mechanism, closed when the drawer is removed from the vault case. The local lane controller is a switching device that is connected to the coin collection mechanism and the exit light that notifies the motorist when they may move from the toll plaza into traffic. The coin basket is a hard plastic funnel that sits on the outside of the apparatus and channels the coins into the coin mechanism. The fare indicator and exit light are electronically-lit sign boxes. The Digital Equipment Corporation computer coin validator device is of a ubiquitous PC appearance, though is a specialised computer.\n\nNotes\n\nThe coin collection apparatus was designed and manufactured by TST International in Brisbane Australia. The Roads and Traffic Authority NSW had designed and manufactured their own automated toll collecting machines, but were faced with many problems. Purely mechanical verification was prone to patrons inserting non-currency objects, and maintenance on these machines was resource hungry. The TST machines were more efficient, and were manufactured for the specific needs of the RTA on the Harbour Bridge. TST International have gone on to export the machines to North America and Europe.\n\nNotes\n\nWhen the Bridge opened in 1932 it cost a car or motorcycle six pence to cross, and a horse and rider were charged three pence. Pedestrian access was, and is still, free. The toll was originally placed on travel across the bridge in both directions to recoup the cost of its construction. This cost was recovered in the 1980s but the toll has been kept, and actually increased dramatically, by the New South Wales State Government to recoup the costs of building the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. After the decision to build the Sydney Harbour Tunnel was made in the early 1980s the toll was increased from 20 cents to $1, then to $1.50, and finally to $2 by the time the Tunnel opened to cover the cost of construction. The Tunnel also had an initial toll of $2 southbound. The Sydney Harbour Bridge toll for all southbound vehicles was increased to $3 in March 2004. There is no toll for northbound traffic. The TST International coin collecting machines were introduced in 1989, and were in constant operation until July 2008."
