        "text": "The Transurban Public Art Program - Canal to Creek includes 21 signature artworks that have activated new and existing parklands between St Peters and Beverly Hills. Artworks include contemporary sculpture, artist-designed playgrounds, large-scale murals, a writers walk and an immersive lighting installation.\n\nNamed ‘Canal to Creek’ after the waterways that connect the art sites, each work is a site-specific exploration of the relationship between people and place.\n\nAlexandra Canal defines the eastern end of the program and Wolli Creek, the western end. Both are part of the same water system that is linked by the Cooks River and Botany Bay. The role of the natural environment on our experience of place is a recurring theme for Canal to Creek artists. In some way, all of the eighteen artists pick up on a cultural thread that supports local identity and belonging.\n\nTake a 360 degree tour by entering into the virtual platform now!\n\nPrizes\n\nPrizes per year group\n\nThere are fabulous prizes to be won for the first, second and third place in each Year group (Years 7 – 10), as well as an overall school winner. Prizes for each category will be as follows:\n\nSchool winner\n\nOne school will be selected for the overall school Prize of a $5,000 Eckersley’s arts grant. This is based on the volume and calibre of entries received from the school.\n\nDisplay of winners\n\nEach winning artwork will be framed and displayed at one of Transurban’s motorway control centres or offices. To honour and congratulate the Prize winners, an awards ceremony will be held later in the year. The winners in each Year group will be invited to celebrate their award-winning artworks and will be congratulated with a decorative trophy on the day."
