        "text": "When the government confirmed that tolls for Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Tunnel were going to increase, they also announced that a toll cap would be introduced – but Sydneysiders have been left waiting for it to happen. Thankfully, the wait is over – with the government announcing this week that from January 1 2024, motorists based in New South Wales will have their toll fees capped at $60 – taking the sting off that extra trip through the tunnel.\n\nTo be eligible, motorists must be a resident of New South Wales, hold a personal toll account with a NSW toll service provider and spend more than $60 a week from their individual tag or licence plate on tolls. The change is set to benefit almost three-quarters of a million motorists, and drivers who spend an average of $200 per week from their individual tag or licence plate on tolls can expect to receive approximately $7,280 in rebates per year.\n\nThe toll cap has been announced as a measure to help Sydneysiders with cost-of-living challenges, with the Minister for Roads John Graham announcing: “The $60 dollar toll cap starting January 1 is part of the Minns Labor Government’s number one priority to deliver cost-of-living relief to families at a time when they are doing it tough,”.\n\nYou can learn more about the journeys included in the toll cap scheme, and how you can register and process your rebates over here."
