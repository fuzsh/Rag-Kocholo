        "text": "Tolls on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel will rise for the first time in 14 years from October 29, in a move the New South Wales government says is about fairness.\n\nThe hike of 6.8 per cent will see drivers pay $4.27, up from $4, during weekday peak times.\n\nRevenue raised from the one-off payment, pending the outcome of the toll review led by Professor Allan Fels, will go towards relief measures for users of private motorways where fees have increased annually by \"at least 4 per cent since they were implemented\".\n\nMinister for Roads John Graham said the \"very modest increase\" was to help balance the road network system.\n\n\"No toll increase is ever welcomed ... but it deals with one of the fairness questions that had arisen over the last 14 years,\" Mr Graham said.\n\n\"This is a 27 cent increase at its maximum. When you look at what has happened to drivers in Liverpool and Blacktown, their tolls have risen over the same 14 years from a bit over $12 to a bit over $35.\"\n\nDrivers from Campbelltown are paying over $30 for a return trip into the city, a rise from $12 in 2009, added premier Chris Minns.\n\n\"For the Harbour Bridge it cost $4 dollars in 2009, and as of yesterday it costs $4 dollars in 2023. So there's got to be some equity here,\" Mr Minns said.\n\nMr Graham said the disparity had been questioned previously at budget estimates.\n\n\"And there was never a good answer supplied as to why it was the case. It really did seem unfair,\" he said.\n\nFirst hike since 2009\n\nBy law, the the bridge and the Harbour Tunnel tolls are reviewed annually with inflation taken into account.\n\nIn 2009, when the last increase took place, the bridge was closed for a picnic, red dust blanketed the city and a navy diver was attacked by a shark in the harbour.\n\nAnd from January of that year, drivers were paying $4 during peak times, $3 for off-peak and $2.50 at night.\n\nThis will change to:\n\n$4 to $4.27 during weekdays peak time\n\n$3 to $3.20 during weekdays off-peak and weekends from 8am to 8pm\n\n$2.50 to $2.67 during weekdays from 7pm to 6.30am, and weekends from 8pm to 8am\n\nNatalie Ward, the opposition minister for transport and roads, said the announcement ahead of Mr Fels' findings was another indication the government was scrambling to pay for its budget promises.\n\n\"The government’s Toll Review hasn’t recommended increasing these tolls,\" Ms Ward said.\n\n\"This government gives with one hand and takes with the other, increasing tolls to pay for their toll relief package.\"\n\nAn initial report from the review of the city's tolls is expected before Christmas.\n\nMs Ward also accused the roads minister of inequity.\n\n\"They are offering toll relief to benefit the Premier's electorate but increasing tolls, fees and charges everywhere else\".\n\nLast week the government also announced a toll cap of $60 for the road network from January 1, at a cost of $561 million over two years and expected to benefit 720,000 drivers."
