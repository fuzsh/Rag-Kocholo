The report includes recommended signage and guidelines for the placement of signage on the roadway preceding a tunnel and along diversion routes. This guidance has been prepared as an update to the Austroads Guide to Road Tunnels Part 2: Planning, Design and Commissioning. Edition 1.1 of the report was published in March 2022. This edition corrected the lengths of seven tunnels listed in Table A1. Edition 1.2 was published in September 2022. This edition removed the design clearance measure for Sydney Harbour Tunnel in Table A1. Watch a webinar with Bob Allen, and report authors Marcus van der Velden, Lindsay Edmonds and Charmaine Joe.",
