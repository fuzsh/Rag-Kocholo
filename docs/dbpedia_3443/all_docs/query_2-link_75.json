        "text": "Tolls will increase on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel on 29 October for the first time in more than 14 years.\n\nBridge and Tunnel tolls will be adjusted 6.8 per cent higher as the New South Wales Government continues its agenda to bring “greater equity” to motorists across the system, following last week’s announcement of a $60 toll cap.\n\nAll extra revenue, it was revealed, will go to the Government’s toll relief Budget package worth $561 million over two years to 720,000 drivers.\n\nThe last time the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel tolls were raised was in January 2009, and they have remained fixed at $4.00 during peak times, $3.00 off peak and $2.50 at night ever since.\n\nFrom Sunday 29 October, those figures will rise to $4.27 in peak, $3.20 off peak and $2.67 at night.\n\nThe State Government claimed the 6.8 per cent rise is a fraction of the CPI increase during the 14 years and seven months since the last adjustment.\n\nAccording to Minister for Roads, John Graham, the increase is helping to provide toll relief to other drivers.\n\n“The NSW Government believes it is appropriate for these tolls to be adjusted higher at a time when we are focused on providing greater equity across the toll road network, no matter what your postcode,” he said.\n\n“Drivers in Western Sydney who have little choice but to use motorways for their commute and family travel have endured annual – and in many cases quarterly – toll increases since 2009 while the Bridge and Tunnel tolls remained fixed.\n\n“Toll revenue is helping us target toll relief to where it is needed most, with suburbs like Kellyville, Silverwater, Blacktown, Quakers Hill, Rosehill and Gosford among those where the most motorists will claim cash back of an average of up to $540 a year. All extra revenue will be used to this end.”\n\nThe adjustment will be made by Ministerial Order under the Roads Act 1993."
