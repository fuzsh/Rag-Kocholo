        "text": "Tolls on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and tunnel will increase next month, as the government claws back funds for its $60 toll cap policy and looks to spread the hit to the hip pocket across the city.\n\nThe tolls, which apply to southbound travel, will be raised by 6.8 per cent from Sunday, October 29.\n\nThe government said the bridge and tunnel tolls have been fixed since January 2009 at $4 in peak, $3 off-peak and $2.50 at night, but will rise at the end of next month to $4.27 in peak, $3.20 off-peak and $2.67 at night.\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns said the government was trying to be “reasonable” in creating fair prices.\n\n“There’s got to be some equity when it comes to toll increases across the network,” he said.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Saturday, Minns said the government couldn’t rule out any further toll increases or implementing a northbound toll across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nRoads Minister John Graham acknowledged “no toll increase is ever welcome”, but said it was to provide toll relief to other drivers.\n\n“The NSW government believes it is appropriate for these tolls to be adjusted higher at a time when we are focused on providing greater equity across the toll road network, no matter what your postcode,” Graham said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nLoading\n\n“Drivers in western Sydney who have little choice but to use motorways for their commute and family travel have endured annual – and in many cases quarterly – toll increases since 2009 while the bridge and tunnel tolls remained fixed.”\n\nThe extra revenue is to go towards the Minns government’s budget policy of a $60 cap on tolls, which it has said will cost $561 million over two years.\n\nThe government said the policy would benefit more than 700,000 motorists who, from January 1, 2024 will be able to claim a quarterly refund from Service NSW for toll spending exceeding the cap.\n\nThe Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
