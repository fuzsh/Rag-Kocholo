        "text": "The Rozelle Interchange connects the M4 to the Anzac Bridge and the M8 to the City West Link and Victoria Road. It also includes a toll-free bypass of Victoria Road, which will be known as the Iron Cove Link, and links to the future Western Harbour Tunnel.\n\nThe interchange in Rozelle is mostly underground and tunnelling has been carried out from the site of the old Rozelle Rail Yards.\n\nThe interchange is part of West Connex, a 33km predominantly underground motorway scheme in Sydney. It was officially opened on Sunday (26 November).\n\nThe Rozelle Interchange and Iron Cove Link were constructed by John Holland and CPB Contractors Joint Venture (JHCPB) on behalf of Transport for New South Wales (NSW).\n\nWSP has been involved in the delivery of two works packages on the scheme, one for the civil and structures design in joint venture with Arcadis, and another for mechanical, electrical and plumbing (M&E) works as part of the JHCPB.\n\nAn earlier stage of the project was completed two months ahead of schedule in February of this year. This involved the construction of the 7.5km M4-M8 link tunnels between the new M4 at Haberfield and the M8 at St Peters and stub tunnels to the Rozelle Interchange.\n\nThe contractor for this stage was Acciona Samsung Bouygues Joint Venture (ASBJV), managed by West Connex.\n\nDealing with complexities\n\nThe Rozelle Interchange has been described as “one of the most complex infrastructure projects ever undertaken in Australia” by WSP.\n\nThe interchange includes four layers of road tunnels with numerous entry and exit ramps, six large ventilation tunnels and three major intersections. It also includes 15 road and pedestrian bridges of various structural types, four significant cut and cover structures, a ventilation facility building, and other elements such as major retaining walls.\n\nIts intricate arrangement of underground tunnels at various depths pass through a range of challenging geotechnical conditions under a heavily trafficked part of Sydney.\n\nWSP’s project manager for the civil, structural, mechanical and electrical works Simon Hollamby said: “The Rozelle Interchange project is unique as it is a major interchange but it is all underground.\n\n“Dealing with multiple carriageways merging and diverging underground is complex, and we needed to consider ventilation of those tunnels, personnel safety and the safety of users of the facility.\"\n\nBecause of the scale and complexity of the project, WSP used a 3D model to capture all elements of the construction. This gave the contractor a better idea of what the project would look like, what the construction sequencing could be and how to improve on their processes for a better and faster construction.\n\nA digital tunnel ventilation simulation model was also instrumental in the Rozelle Interchange design.\n\nWSP tunnel ventilation lead on the Rozelle Interchange project Duncan Saunsbury said that a “huge amount” of analysis went into the development of the ventilation facilities.\n\nThe team – including WSP specialists in four countries – developed scripts and programs to perform and analyse around 1,500 different ventilation scenarios with varying traffic conditions and including emergency situations.\n\nWSP geotechnical discipline lead on the project Andrea Faulkner said that the variable ground conditions also presented a challenge, as they displayed significant and non-uniform changes over short distances.\n\nFor the redevelopment of the old Rozelle Rail Yards, the team came up with an innovative solution for Rozelle Parklands backfill. Some of the fill material needed to be up to 12m high. As a result, the team used a type of lightweight fill to build up the embankments, meaning minimal settlement in the Parklands and therefore less need for ground treatment such as steel and concrete piles.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe next stage of major construction work will focus on the Western Harbour Tunnel – a 6.5km tunnel with three lanes in each direction that will run under Sydney Harbour and connect to the Rozelle Interchange via a new road.\n\nThe JHCPB joint venture is delivering the A$722M (£379M) stage one of the Western Harbour Tunnel, which includes the excavation of 1.7km of the tunnel between Rozelle and Birchgrove. JHCPB started tunnelling on stage one in June 2022 and is expected to complete works in 2025.\n\nAcciona began tunnelling on the second stage of the Western Harbour Tunnel earlier this month. The second stage involves construction of the northern end of the tunnel, from Birchgrove, under Sydney Harbour, to North Sydney, and the complete tunnel fit out."
