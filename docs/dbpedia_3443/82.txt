[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]How to Avoid Tolls.

While tolls charges cannot be avoided when using Toll roads, forward planning can help minimize the need for using tolls and therefore reducing your spend.

By planning your route using GPS tools such as Google Maps or Waze, users can opt to use only toll-free roads. This can quickly minimize Toll costs.

However, many routes are considerably lengthened if Toll roads are not used meaning you must consider whether the cost of the Toll is beneficial considering the time gained.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]
