Singer and model Anna Tsuchiya (25) announced on her blog on Saturday that she is currently pregnant. She and the father, a stylist named Yamato who is three years older, are expected to register their marriage soon.

Yamato has been Tsuchiya's stylist for many years now. Their relationship apparently started about two years ago. Tsuchiya is said to be three months pregnant, with the baby due next spring.

Tsuchiya was previously married to model Joshua between 2004 and 2006, and they had one son together. Joshua suddenly passed away last year at the age of 25.
