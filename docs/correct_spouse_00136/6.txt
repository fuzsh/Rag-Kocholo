News is filtering through that Joshua Niimura, the ex-husband of Anna Tsuchiya, has died.

The Japanese star, whose highly sucessful career has encompassed singing, acting and modeling, is mourning the loss of the father of her child. Known professionally as “Joshua”, he and Tsuchiya got together when both were models. They married in 2004 but divorced two years later.

For Dream! sends our condolences to Anna and her daughter Sky. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this time.
