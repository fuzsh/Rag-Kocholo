Singer and model, Anna Tsuchiya, 31, has announced she has divorced her husband, Japanese stylist Yamato Kikuchi whom she married in 2009.

Tsuchiya made the announcement on her blog on Thursday. It was the second divorce for Tsuchiya who married model Joshua Niimura in 2004 and divorced him in 2006. She has an 11-year-old son from her marriage to Joshua and a 5-year-old son from her marriage to Kikuchi.

Tsuchiya explained in her blog that "Our two boys are growing up healthy both physically and mentally. However, my husband and I had been discussing our future for the past six months and we seemed to have a difference in values. So we both agreed that we should follow what we believe in."

Tsuchiya is currently embroiled in a legal dispute over her decision to pull out of a theater production.
