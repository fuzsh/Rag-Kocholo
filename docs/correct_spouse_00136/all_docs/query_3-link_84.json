If it's a singer-songwriter without a band, fine. If it's a band with a regular drummer/bassist/whatever, then that's another issue. Personally, I would rather hear a band -mediocre/crappy/whatever- as they really sound. I want an organic recording of the band AS THEY SOUND. Not as a computer and session musicians sound.\n\nNow, I have absolutely nothing against session musicians. They are typically studs in every sense of the word and could most likely play circles around me. Having said that,I blame record companies, producers, engineers, and lazy bands for the proliferation of session musicians in today's music. How many drummers are shut out of the recording studio because a session drummer was quicker/faster/more precise? The public is the one that misses out on a potentially unique sound. (Is it my imagination or do a lot of session drummers sound the same, with a lot of the same fills/grooves?) I'd rather hear Ringo or Charlie Watts mis-hit or speed up, then have a sanitized/perfect version recorded by a session drummer or fixed with some computer editing software.\n\nI know of a \"band\" (who shall remain nameless) that went into the studio with scratch tracks of their songs. They played the songs for the producer, he wasn't all that happy with their playing, so they went out and hired a full band of session musicians. The singer was the only one from the \"band\" that is on the cd. When asked why they did this they responded, \"We wanted the songs to sound as good as they could.\" Uh...I'd rather hear mistakes, natural fluctuations in tempo, etc... then hear everything perfect with vocal pitch corrections, sessions musicians, tempos corrected with beat detective, etc. . Maybe after they're done, someone can go and hire a session painter to fix the \"problems\" with the Mona Lisa.\n\nSorry for the rant, but as I said, this is a topic that really bugs me.\n\nProducers have been using session musicians instead of band members, many times with the session players uncredited forover 60 years. It is nothing new. I have been involved in this for 39 years myself. If you are a member of a band, work at your craft until you are good enough to not be replaced. Otherwise, expect it, if you are working with a name producer. Of course producers have varying standards for the amount of bad playing they can endure. Some are willing to spend the extra time and money to fix little things, some are willing to fix a lot.\n\nA lot of the session players you will never even know about. They will be uncredited and the band member will be credited. In this instance the session musician usually has to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement. (NDA.) In that instance the band member will get all the credit for the studio musicians's hard work and skill. The studio musician will get union scale, in most instances. If the recording is succesful, the band member will even make the money from the product as well. We labor in anonymity, but I for one, am happy to have the work. Someone is going to do it. It might as well be me. I still love to play drums. I am currently in the middle of a 16 session week. (3 more to go, tomorrow.) I'm sorry for those of you that don';t like the system, but that's how it has been for years. The really good players don;t get replaced. Others watch and learn.\n\nFirst off, again, I am NOT knocking session players at all. I bow down to them and their abilities. I think it is a travesty that session musicians don't get the recognition/income they deserve. If I was replaced in the studio, I would be embarrassed to have my name on the cd. Having said that, I have done some session work for a couple of singers-never been replaced, knock on wood- so I have a bit of knowledge on this topic, although nothing close to Tommy or Dave. Granted, I'm no where near Tommy/Dave's ability/experience level, but I do have some experience. (I was concerned that Tommy was going to pipe in, so I almost didn't post because I do respect his opinion and playing a great deal.)\n\nIn my opinion, the number one reason a producer replaces a musician (which is usually what happens) is because it's easier/quicker. In my opinion, that's often a crappy reason. Lazy producers/engineers/and yes, musicians = lots of work for session musicians. I personally prefer Steve Albini's method of recording: try to capture the band as they actually sound. He oftentimes won't even give his opinion on songs nor will he use Pro Tools/Beat Detective because he wants to capture the BAND'S sound, not his sound or a session musician/computer's sound. That is exactly what I want to hear. I realize I'm in the minority currently, but I prefer originality, flawed or not.\n\nHaving said that, I don't think, \"It's been this way for 60 years,\" is a good reason. I agree that it is true, but personally I think attitudes like that are why we will soon see the death of the major record label as we know it. I think we will start to see more and more self-produced, self-recorded music and fewer and fewer \"big name producers\" and session musicians. People may complain that the performances/sonic qualities are not as good, and those people may be right. However, I don't think the general public cares all that much. (Case in point, Honky Tonk Woman's tempo fluctuates quite a bit, yet it was still a hit. Hell, Disco Duck was a hit!?!!?!) The public/kids want what they have always wanted: a catchy melody, something that's easy to dance to, etc.. Keep in mind again, I'm NOT knocking session players. I think they are in a very tough spot, and I certainly wouldn't want to be in their shoes.\n\nI do agree with the comment that you had better spend the time to get good. I think that is very true and a valid point and if people did that, it would spell the end of careers for many session musicians. Of course, with computers, being good on your instrument seems to be less and less of a concern for many people. Which is maybe the saddest aspect of this discussion."
