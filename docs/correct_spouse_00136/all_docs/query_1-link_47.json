        "text": "Tickets to the provocative new exhibition and events program now on sale\n\nACMI today announces a pivotal new partnership with two-time Academy Award-winning actor and advocate Geena Davis and the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media. The iconic actor is set to travel to Melbourne as lead ambassador for the Melbourne Winter Masterpieces blockbuster, Goddess: Power, Glamour, Rebellion. The ACMI-curated exhibition opens at Australia’s national museum of screen culture on 5 April before touring internationally.\n\nGlobally renowned for her show-stopping performances in hits such as Thelma & Louise, A League of Their Own, Beetlejuice and The Accidental Tourist, Geena Davis is a true Hollywood movie star. Beyond her impact on screen, she is also a leader in leveraging research, education and advocacy to influence systemic change in onscreen character portrayals in global film, television, advertising and gaming through her Institute.\n\nGoddess celebrates the pantheon of trailblazing women who fought the system that tried to exploit them. Showcasing more than 150 exhibition highlights, including never-before-seen costumes, original sketches, interactive experiences, large-scale projections and cinematic treasures, the exhibition interrogates the many stereotypes surrounding the screen goddess and honours the ground-breaking achievements of the screen’s revolutionary leading women.\n\nIn aligning with the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media Goddess signals the work of these formidable figures is far from done – there are more boundaries to break, agendas to advance and systems to fight – while working towards a better future.\n\nSpeaking about her ambassadorship with ACMI, Geena Davis, said: “I’m so excited to be a launch partner for this ground-breaking exhibition and to lead important conversations about gender equality at the special Goddess event, Being Seen on Screen: The Importance of Representation. This one-day conference at ACMI will inspire discussion about equality, diversity and ageing on Australian screens – vital conversations to have if we are to make permanent change in the screen industry.”\n\nACMI Director of Experience & Engagement, Dr Britt Romstad, said: “We couldn’t be more delighted to announce stage one of the vibrant Goddess events program, the publication of our captivating Goddess catalogue, and of course, the partnership with Geena Davis and her vital organisation, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media. Impacting how we think about representation on screen, Geena takes creative control, fights for equality and marches to the beat of her own drum – she is truly the ultimate screen goddess.”\n\nMinister for Creative Industries, Steve Dimopoulos, said: “Melbourne is Australia’s creative city and we’re thrilled to host Geena Davis as part of the Goddess program. Equality isn’t negotiable in Victoria – throughout our creative industries and beyond.”\n\nBeing Seen on Screen: The Importance of Representation is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see Geena Davis and hear her passionate call to action, live in conversation on Wednesday 5 April. It will also feature panel discussions with Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media President & CEO, Madeline Di Nonno, and a cross-section of Australian screen industry talent including Michelle Cheng, Santilla Chingaipe, Jan Fran, Elaine Crombie, Sophie Hyde, Amy Marks, Pallavi Sharda, Anousha Zarkesh, plus award-winning writer, speaker and appearance activist Carly Findlay, and the 2023 Australian of the Year, award-winning filmmaker, bestselling author and founder of the Body Image Movement, Taryn Brumfitt.\n\nFurther event programs include in-depth monthly Goddess ACMI Curator Tours providing exclusive out-of-hours access to deep-dive into the stories behind the fascinating figures who challenged and changed the role of women on screen.\n\nThe immersive Goddess Nights event series will kick off 25 May with the first of three big femme-centric live music line-ups featuring performances by DJ JNETT, CD, POOKIE and Ayebatonye with specially curated food and drink offerings across a huge evening of screen culture and music.\n\nCurated in partnership with Clare Stewart (former Festival Director at BFI London Film Festival and Curatorial Advisor on Goddess), Divine Trailblazers is a cinematic tribute to contemporary actors at the height of their creative powers. The film program will feature Oscar-nominee Angela Bassett in the sequel Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022); Leah Purcell in The Drover’s Wife (2021), a film she wrote, produced, directed and starred in; Oscar nominees Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis in the genre-bending Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022); Emma Thompson in the romantic comedy Good Luck to You, Leo Grande (2022), directed by Australia’s Sophie Hyde; Cate Blanchett in her BAFTA-Award winning and Oscar-nominated performance as an orchestra conductor in Tár (2022); Viola Davis in her BAFTA-nominated portrayal of the warrior Nanisca in The Woman King (2022); and Filipino actor Dolly De Leon in her international breakout role in the Palme d’Or winning Triangle of Sadness (2022).\n\nMoreover, the Goddess Sundays program will shine a spotlight on formidable on-screen personas, with weekly Sunday afternoon film screenings across the duration of the exhibition. These films will showcase some of the boundary-breakers featured in the exhibition including Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot (1959), Anna Tsuchiya in Sakuran (2007) and Pam Grier in Jackie Brown (1997). Additional screenings will feature Cheryl Dunye’s The Watermelon Woman (1996) and Daniela Vega in A Fantastic Woman (2017) with more event programming to be announced during the exhibition’s run. As previously announced, ACMI will also screen an exclusive two-week Melbourne season of Brainwashed: Sex-Camera-Power (2022), Nina Menkes’ documentary examining the pervasiveness of the male gaze in film.\n\nThroughout the exhibition, audiences will be invited to explore a powerful selection of films on Cinema 3, ACMI’s video-on-demand service, supported by Porsche Cars Australia.\n\nFrom the screen to the pages of a book, ACMI is also bringing together a remarkable selection of writers, creatives, experts and academics to lend their ideas, voices and insights to Goddess: Fierce Women on Film, an accompanying publication expanding upon the exhibition’s stories and themes, published by Thames & Hudson. This outstanding critical examination of film’s foremost figures invites audiences to reconsider their understanding of moviemaking history, shifting the focus and putting the women back in the spotlight.

Too often reduced to the status of bombshell, starlet and screen siren, these goddesses remain far more than sexist stereotypes.\n\nDeveloped over four years, this ACMI-original exhibition features over 150 exhibition highlights, including never-before-seen costumes, large-scale projections, original sketches, interactive experiences and cinematic treasures – including iconic outfits worn by Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Geena Davis and Margot Robbie. Goddesshonours the women who challenged narratives, defied expectations and transcended existing tropes.\n\nWhether it’s Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Michelle Yeoh or Zendaya, today’s goddesses unapologetically occupy spaces and roles that shatter glass ceilings, project solidarity and reframe society through essential stories, brave voices and complex characters. They’ve overcome convention and an industry built to confine them with collective power and fearless creativity to imagine their own heroes and forge their own paths.\n\nACMI presents Goddess: Power, Glamour, Rebellion in its world premiere in Melbourne, opening 5 April 2023, before the exhibition tours internationally.

The stories told in entertainment media send a specific message about who matters most in our culture. In order to bring about a global culture change, it is especially important that children see diverse, intersectional representations of characters in media to reflect the population of the world — which is half female and very diverse — and avoid unwittingly instilling unconscious bias in them. The organisation uses data-driven research, education and advocacy to empower and inspire content creators to reimagine the media landscape to reflect the world we live in. The institute has sponsored the largest amount of research ever done on children’s entertainment media, covering over a 30-year span. More at seejane.org\n\n@geenadavisorg"
