Award.\n\n(audience applauding and cheering) - Thank you, Jessica, for that very kind introduction.\n\nYou have demonstrated one thing to this audience, that I'm a very old man.\n\n(audience laughing) It's really, truly an honor to speak to you this morning.\n\nThis is a very special occasion for you and for me.\n\nTo you graduates, congratulations.\n\nI graduated, as Jessica said, from MSU 55 years ago.\n\nI still remember my wife typing a draft of my master's thesis.\n\nThe journey has not always been easy for us.\n\nAnd you graduates have accomplished a great deal and have reason to be proud today, but I do ask that you take a moment to recall all the people who help you get to this day, your parents and your families, your spouse or partner.\n\nThat their efforts are bound up in your own reminds me of a wonderful story I heard several years ago by Alex Haley, the famous author of \"Roots.\"\n\nHaley and a friend were walking down a road on a winding path that was adjacent to a beautiful, rather tall wall that was constructed with polished stone.\n\nAs they were making their way down the path, Haley noticed a large turtle sitting atop the wall.\n\nThinking to himself how impossible it would be for a turtle to climb a tall, slick wall.\n\nHaley asked his friend, \"How did this turtle get on top of the wall?\"\n\nThe friend thought about the query for a moment and then said, \"I don't know, but you can bet one thing.\n\nHe did not get there by himself.\"\n\nI did not get here by myself and neither have you.\n\nAs I mentioned, 55 years ago, I sat where you are sitting today, and let me tell you, I cannot remember for the life of me who the commencement speaker was.\n\nSo I have no illusion as to what I say this morning will achieve the permanence of the Gettysburg Address, but perhaps it can only emulate its brevity.\n\nSo using the prerogative as a speaker, I would also take this opportunity to share with you just a few observations based on my life experiences that have been important to me and may prove useful to you as you move on beyond MSU.\n\nThese observations are not profound.\n\nIn fact, I think they're simple.\n\nSo my first observation is never ever take a job just for the money.\n\nI have taken three significant pay cuts during my career.\n\nIn fact, some of you may question my judgment for being so financially unfocused.\n\nHowever, with the clarity of hindsight, I can tell you that the times I have been most satisfied professionally have been those when I was doing something I wanted to do solely because I thought it was the right thing for me to do at the time and not because the job or position paid the most money.\n\nI have come to realize life is, in fact, a one-time deal.\n\nYou do not get a chance to go around twice here on Earth, and the times that you will remember are those when you did something that made a difference, when you risked much for an even greater reward, and when you reached beyond the everyday to engage in the broader world.\n\nFor me, these three principles are what makes a life worthwhile.\n\nSimply put, you should learn to put money in perspective, but not always put it first.\n\nMy second observation is also simple.\n\nAnd that is you will face disappointments and obstacles during the course of your careers and lives, but in responding to them, please, bet on yourself.\n\nI urge you to have the confidence that you can deal with and overcome obstacles and disappointments.\n\nYou know, I bet on myself many years ago when I turned down a scholarship to Columbia University in New York City to attend Michigan State University and enjoy this beautiful campus and, at the time, our number one ranked football team.\n\n(audience laughing) I was born and raised in Hannibal, Missouri, the home of Mark Twain, and in the words of Mark Twain, you don't want to be like the cat who sat down one time on a hot stove.\n\n\"She will never sit down on a hot stove again, and that is well,\" Twain said, but then with a twinkle in his eye, Mark Twain also said, \"but she also will never sit down on a cold one either.\"\n\nSo bet on yourself.\n\nDon't be afraid of the cold stove.\n\nNow, at 78 years old, I have another observation to make.\n\nWork long and hard.\n\nWhether it's a job for a not-for-profit organization, for a church, synagogue, or mosque, work for as long as you can.\n\nPlease don't succumb to societal pressure of making yourself either self-absorbed or irrelevant.\n\nLast year, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger passed away just a few weeks shy of a hundred years old, and in an interview he gave when he was 99 years old, Dr. Kissinger confessed to working 15 hours a day.\n\nThat's pretty impressive.\n\nAnd I remember a five-hour dinner I had with Dr. Kissinger about 15 years ago as he guided me into a successful resolution of a problem I was dealing with at the time.\n\nDr. Kissinger was sometimes controversial, but even his critics acknowledge that he stayed engaged and contributed moderately to the great issues our world has faced.\n\nI don't have Dr. Kissinger's stamina, but today, at 78 years old, I work about six hours a day, four days a week.\n\nAnd as I noted earlier, this is deeply satisfying and important to me, and it allows me to reach out and serve my broader world, and for me, for me, this is what makes my life worthwhile.\n\nWe all know that our great nation is deeply polarized and divided.\n\nIt seems we cannot determine what is factual from what is simply fiction.\n\nIt also seems that we cannot debate alternatives rationally to try and find reasonable compromises in difficult situations.\n\nMSU is a great institution, and it's an institution that is important not only to our great nation and not just the State of Michigan.\n\nAnd at the College of Social Science, I know you've learned how to learn, and you've also learned how to continue to learn the rest of your lives.\n\nWe need you graduates to use what you've learned and work as long as you can and as hard as you can to stay engaged in the broader world in order to help our great nation move forward in a positive way.\n\nIt's so important, and I'm counting on you to do that.\n\nAnd now I want to warn you, at some point in your career and even earlier than you think, you will be invited to abandon your principles to satisfy a boss or a client.\n\nDon't do it.\n\nIt's not worth it.\n\nDon't be afraid to lose a job or even fire a customer or a client if it means compromising what you believe to be right and appropriate.\n\nMore than a century ago, Elihu Root, who was a renowned corporate lawyer and who practiced in New York City and was a senator and cabinet secretary during the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt, observed that \"about half the practice of a decent lawyer consists of telling his clients that they are damn fools and should stop.\"\n\n(audience laughing) Now let me get back to the beginning of my talk and remind you again not to forget those who will have made it possible for you to get where you will be in your work lives.\n\nStay in touch with your professors and your fellow students.\n\nThey will continue to make a difference in your lives.\n\nFor example, I value my continuing relationship with one of my law school professors.\n\nIt has enriched my life personally and professionally, and I have continued to learn from him.\n\nSo as I close, just permit me to be a bit personal and read to you something he wrote to me when I was confirmed as Deputy Attorney General of the United States.\n\n\"Did I tell you my first job was located in the Office of Deputy Attorney General?\n\nThe deputy was Nick Katzenbach.\n\nJim Vorenberg was his special assistant for President Johnson's War on Crime, and I was Jim Vorenberg's assistant.\n\nI spent a good deal of time in what will be your office, and it fills me with a sense of full-term that you should now be sitting in an office where I began.\"\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this coming to full-term is the nature of things.\n\nAs you move out and begin your careers, this sense of full-term will come to you as you distinguish yourself in your careers, your communities, and our great nation.\n\nAnd finally, I'm in the process of writing a book, and I came across the words of the great Roman philosopher Cicero.\n\nCicero said that \"the particular fruit of old age is the memory of abundant blessings that has come before.\"\n\nI've had plenty of abundant blessings.\n\nI'm a very lucky man.\n\nI met my wife here at MSU.\n\nI jump-started my career here with very wise counsel from a professor in the School of Labor and Industrial Relations, and for this, I'm eternally grateful.\n\nI wish you all the best and godspeed.\n\n(audience applauding and cheering) - Thank you, Mr. Thompson.\n\nEach year, the College of Social Science Leadership Council also sponsors an award to recognize and honor one of the great teachers within this college.\n\nProfessor Philip J., PJ, Pettis has been selected for this year's Outstanding Teacher Award.\n\nWould Professor Pettis please come to the podium?\n\n(audience applauding and cheering) Dr. PJ Pettis is a first-year assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and a core faculty member of the Department of Chicano/Latino Studies.\n\nHe received his PhD in sociology at Vanderbilt University in May 2023.\n\nPJ is proud to be both a trained sociologist and a licensed social worker.\n\nPJ's research focuses on how social and spatial context shape intersectional inequalities in sexual minority health.\n\nDr. Pettis teaches classes in both the sociology of sex, gender, and sexuality, medical sociology, and the sociology of mental health.\n\nHis work has been published in the \"Journal of Health and Social Behavior,\" \"Social Science & Medicine,\" and \"Sociological Perspectives.\"\n\nWe are proud to recognize our 2024 Outstanding Teacher Award to Professor PJ Pettis.\n\n(audience applauding) (audience applauding) - So good morning, esteemed faculty, proud parents, loved ones, and the distinguished 2024 graduates of Michigan State University.\n\nIt is with deep humility and gratitude that I address you today.\n\nI want to thank the College of Social Science alumni and the college for honoring me with the esteemed 2024 College of Social Science Outstanding Teacher Award.\n\nSpecial thanks to Carla Pfeffer, Chair of the Sociology Department, for her nomination and to my esteemed colleagues in Sociology and Chicano and Latino Studies.\n\nTheir collective wisdom and dedication have been invaluable in my personal and professional growth.\n\nEspecially each member of this esteemed community is equally deserving of such prestigious recognition.\n\nTo the 2024 graduating class, including my former students, it is a privilege to be here today to celebrate your remarkable achievements.\n\nYour hard work, determination, and sacrifices have led to this significant milestone, and I commend each of you for your dedication.\n\nAs I address you, I am mindful that each of you have different milestones that have led you here.\n\nMany of you, like myself, are first-generation college students, immigrants, children of immigrants, returning adults, and servicemen and women.\n\nYour presence exemplifies the resilience and excellence of your families and communities, which of you should be immensely proud.\n\nLet us take a moment to fully absorb the magnitude of this accomplishment.\n\nThink of all the things you've overcome along the way.\n\nEach trial and triumph has shaped you into individuals you are today, each deserving of recognition and celebration.\n\nAmidst our joy and celebration, I would like us also to remember our fellow Spartan, Alexandria Verner, a bright and talented would-be senior majoring in biology whose life, like Arielle Anderson and Brian Fraser, was tragically cut short during the violent tragedy of February 13th, 2023.\n\nMy heartfelt remembrance goes out to her loved ones and friends, many of whom are among us today.\n\nAs you embark on the next stage of your journey, remember the words of Howard Thurman.\n\n\"Don't ask yourself what the world needs.\n\nAsk what makes you come alive and go do it.\n\nBecause what the world needs is people who have come alive.\"\n\nEmbrace your most authentic self, including your insecurities, vulnerabilities, and uncertainties.\n\nIt is okay to not have all the answers right now.\n\nTrue self-discovery centering on bettering the world around you takes time and courage.\n\nEmbrace the journey of introspection and self-exploration, knowing that it is through embracing our most authentic selves that we give the best to the world.\n\nToday you have demonstrated the courage and bravery needed to embark on this journey.\n\nAs you move forward, remember by embracing your authenticity, it not only activates your most luminous potential and selfhood, but also you can give your best self to the world.\n\nFrom my own journey, this is what I know to be true.\n\nEach of you have made me so proud to be a Spartan and a member of the vibrant, vast, and diverse Michigan State University community.\n\nAs we part ways today, let us carry the essence of our Spartan mission and values.\n\nLet us conduct ourselves to the highest caliber, always standing up for what is right in the face of injustice.\n\nLet us utilize our talents, gifts, and knowledge to transform the world into a better place, guided by the values of collaboration, equity, excellence, integrity, and respect.\n\nCongratulations, Spartans, you did it.\n\n(audience applauding and cheering) - It is our tradition in the College of Social Science for the seniors of the Dean's Student Advisory Council to select one of our graduating seniors to give a brief address.\n\nThis year's College of Social Science senior speaker is Joseph Allen.\n\nJoey is graduating today with a bachelor of science degree in urban and regional planning, economic geography, and has a minor in law, justice, and public policy.\n\nAfter graduation, Joey will take some time to prepare for the LSAT and will then embark on law school in fall of 2025.\n\nWe have a number of lawyers with us here today, so you can get some advice, Joey.\n\nAnd he has the intention of studying planning, law, and public policy and administration before beginning a career in helping to facilitate affordable housing, sustainable construction, and efficient public transportation.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming the senior speaker, Joey Allen.\n\n(audience applauding and cheering) - Good morning.\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to thank Dean Brett Donellan, Associate Dean Emily Durbin, the Honorable Kelly Tebay, Vice-Chairperson of the MSU Board of Trustees, our honored alumni, Ms. Jessica Kingston and Mr. Larry Thompson, and all present for this ceremony today for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the class of 2024.\n\nI would also like to recognize the lovely Social Science professors, faculty, and alumni that I've worked with for the past four years, especially my mentors, Dr. John Waller and Mike Morrow, as well as my family, my friends, and classmates, including Sam, McKayla, Katie, Josie, Justin, Rebecca, and Sean.\n\nBeing a Texas transplant, it took me a while to adjust to the winters here in Michigan.\n\nI must admit, I get a slight sense of dread every November when the first freezes fall upon us and the locals start to quip, \"It's not that cold,\" to anybody wearing more than two layers.\n\nMost affecting to me though is when the gorgeous autumn yellows and oranges fade into rather depressing browns and grays that stay around for seemingly months on end.\n\nLuckily, countless beautiful evergreen trees grow on our campus, around our Union, and on the banks of the Red Cedar, and when I pass them, that little bit of color is, at least to me, an uplifting reminder of resilience through the winter.\n\nYou see, an evergreen keeps its leaves or its needles strong and green year-round because it has found a way to not freeze.\n\nThough it will grow older and shed, an evergreen remains a sign of life, of shelter, and of a warmer season to look forward to.\n\nIn a more human sense, Oxford Dictionary defines being evergreen as having a lasting presence of freshness or success.\n\nIt is fitting for MSU to have green as an official color because every sticker, jersey, and logo is a reminder to imbue that spirit into our work.\n\nEven on my mock trial team, we incorporated green into our professional competition attire, ties, blouses, jewelry, not only because it looks good, but because it reminded us that we were a force to be reckoned with.\n\nEspecially as social scientists, we often find ourselves in winter, so to speak.\n\nWhen faced with issues of injustice, inequality, or violence, it is easy to feel immobilized or that the everyday battles against them are somehow futile.\n\nBut Spartans stand as resilient signs of life in these matters.\n\nWe do not shrivel up and shed the fruits of our labor when the fight for good becomes cold or difficult.\n\nWe remain and see out the change we want to make.\n\nYour calling, no matter what it may be or what climate it takes you to, should bring a fresh perspective only you can give.\n\nBe an evergreen in a sea of gray.\n\nGraduates, take comfort in the fact that you will often see MSU alumni, your evergreen peers, out in the world.\n\nBecause while an evergreen tree may remain rooted in one place, we Spartans are mobile.\n\nWherever we go, while we can carry the peace and comfort of the evergreen spirit with us, we must not remain in winters by ourselves.\n\nWhen I have felt alone or helpless, it has been the people in this arena that have saved me, talked to me with compassion and understanding, showed me that I have worth.\n\nWith that same army of support, each Spartan must carry forward the courage of their conviction, the purpose of their cause, and the light of their knowledge.\n\nTo quote the immortal words of the poet Robert Frost, \"The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.\"\n\nGraduates, there are miles to go before we sleep.\n\nThank you and Go Green.\n\n- Go White.\n\n(audience applauding and cheering) - Wow, those are some phenomenal speeches.\n\nThank you, Mr. Thompson.\n\nDr. Pettis, and Mr. Allen.\n\nYou represent the college with such distinction.\n\nThank you.\n\nNow I would like to invent Doctor- I would like to invite Dr. Emily Durbin, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies, (audience cheering) to introduce the chairpersons and directors of the college's academic units.\n\nDr. Durbin.\n\n(audience cheering and applauding) - Thank you, Dean

[Audience] Go White!\n\n(audience cheering and applauding) - Thanks, everybody, for sticking around.\n\nIt does look like the Thanos Snap happened.\n\nThat was a good joke, come on.\n\n(audience laughing) An importance part of today's ceremony is to acknowledge those who have played significant roles in helping our graduates reach this important milestone.\n\nWill the faculty, academic staff, and advisors stand and be recognized for their contributions to the achievements of the graduates?\n\n(audience applauding and cheering) Thank you, faculty, academic staff, and advisors.\n\nThere's yet another group of individuals who have contributed greatly with their love, understanding, and support to the achievements we recognized at today's ceremony.\n\nWe ask that the families and loved ones of the graduates rise and give us all an opportunity to express our thanks and appreciation for your support of our graduates.\n\n(audience applauding and cheering) All right, so we started with Iron Man, and we'll finish with Spider-Man.\n\nSo there's a quote about, \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" and today you have great power because you've earned your degrees.\n\nAnd so what we ask is this, that you do the right thing when no one is looking, that you fight for social justice, and you save the world with your friends.\n\nCongratulations, graduates.\n\n(audience cheering and applauding) And now we are at journey's end.\n\nSo I now invite all of you to join us in singing the first stanza of the alma mater, \"MSU Shadows,\" which you will find in the electronic commencement program.\n\nAfter the singing, we request that students and guests be seated and remain in places until the recessional of the platform party and faculty.\n\nYou made it, class of 2024.\n\nThank you, please rise and sing.\n\n(audience applauding) (gentle music) ♪ MSU, we love thy shadows ♪ ♪ When twilight silence falls ♪ ♪ Flushing deep and softly paling ♪ ♪ O'er ivy-covered
