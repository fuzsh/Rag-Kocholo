        "text": "Anna Tsuchiya is a Japanese singer, actress, and former model. She was born of an American father, who is of Polish and Irish heritage, and a Japanese mother in Tokyo, Japan, in 1984. Tsuchiya is best known, as an actress, for her role as Ichigo Shirayuri in the award-winning film Kamikaze Girls (2004). Tsuchiya, as a (solo) singer, has released 15 singles, 2 mini-albums, 4 full-length albums, 2 compilation albums, and 2 re-mix albums to date. She sings mostly in English, but she sings in Japanese, too. Her music is a mix of rock, punk, alternative, pop, and dance, with a little bit of R&B and hip-hop on occasion. Think Katy Perry meets Joan Jett.\n\nKamaikaze Girls is a comedy based on the “light” novel Shimotsuma Monogatari (2002) by writer and fashion designer Novala Takemoto. The film, directed by Tetsuya Nakashima [Confessions (2010)], is about the friendship between Momoko Ryugasaki (Kyoko Fukada), a country girl obsessed with Lolita fashion, and Ichigo Shirayuri (Anna Tsuchiya), a delinquent biker girl or Yanki.\n\nKamikaze Girls is funny an wildly entertaining. I didn’t know who Anna Tsuchiya was before I watched this movie on DVD in 2006, but I was instantly enchanted by her. My favorite scene is when tough girl Ichigo, alone with Momoko, allows herself to cry after suffering her first heartbreak the night before. It’s easy to see why Tsuchiya won 5 acting awards for her role. She has since starred in films such as The Taste of Tea (2004) and Sakuran (2007) [whose soundtrack is courtesy of rocker Shiina Ringo via her album Heisei Fūzoku with conductor Neko Saito], and has had supporting roles in films like Dororo (2007) and Kamui Gaiden (2009). She’s a good actress. However, on the Kamikaze Girls DVD was also a video by Anna Tsuchiya. She was sexy and punky, and the song (“Taste My Skin”) rocked; and I have been a fan of her music ever since.\n\nAnna Tsuchiya started her modeling career at the age of 14 as a model for Seventeen magazine, and enjoyed success throughout her teens. In 2002, at 18, she started her musical career by forming the short-lived alt-rock band Spin Aqua with former Oblivion Dust guitarist K.A.Z. The band released 3 singles and 1 full-length album [Pisces (2003)], but failed to achieve commercial success. The album was pretty damn good regardless, with cool tracks like singles “Unchained”, “Mermaid” and “PAPER MOON”, as well as covers of Sophie B. Hawkins‘ “Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover” and Hole‘s “Malibu” [an acoustic version]. “STORM” is another favorite track. Spin Aqua disbanded in 2004 after Tsuchiya became pregnant then engaged to model JOSHUA. They divorced in 2006.\n\nIn 2005, Anna Tsuchiya returned to music and embarked on her solo journey with the release of her debut mini-album Taste My Beat. “Taste My Skin“, whose video was used to promote the release [and was included on the 2006 R1 DVD release of Kamikaze Girls], is an energetic alt-rocker with pop flourishes, while “Ah Ah” and “MY LULLABY” deliver harder-edged alt-rock. However, my favorite tracks are infectious power pop/rocker “in my hands” and passionate power ballad “FROZEN ROSE”. Taste My Beat closes with a cover of “Somebody Help Me” by New York alt-rockers Full Blown Rose. The original was used as the theme song for the Fox TV series Tru Calling (2003-05), and Tsuchiya‘s version was used as the theme for the show’s Japanese release.\n\nstrip me? (2006), Anna Tsuchiya‘s 1st full-length album, was preceded by 2 singles, “SLAP THAT NAUGHTY BODY“ and “Change your life“, that were just OK. The 3rd single “rose“, released as ANNA inspi’ NANA (BLACK STONES), was much better. It was used as the 1st opening theme to the anime version of Ai Yazawa‘s shoujo manga NANA, while labelmate and fellow half-American OLIVIA‘s “A Little Pain“, as OLIVIA inspi’ REIRA (TRAPNEST), was used as the 1st ending theme. Tsuchiya‘s “zero” (from strip me?) was used as an inserted song. Other good tracks on strip me? include alt-rockers “NO WAY” and “knock down”, poppy rockers “Give me Kiss & Kiss” and “Grooving beating”, B-side alt-rocker “ONLY WANT YOU”, and non-album A-side “MY FATE”. The album also includes a jazzy re-imagining of Cyndi Lauper‘s “True Colors”.\n\nIn 2007, Anna Tsuchiya released 2 more singles for the NANA anime, as ANNA TSUCHIYA inspi’ NANA (BLACK STONES). Punky rocker “LUCY” was used as the 3rd opening theme, while power ballad “Kuroi Namida” was used as the 3rd ending theme. Watch the videos for both (amazing!) songs here …\n\nOh, by the way, NANA, the manga and anime, is about the friendship between two girls named Nana who meet by chance on a train to Tokyo. Nana Komatsu is a naive small town girl following her boyfriend to have a dream life, while Nana Osaki is a rebellious punk rocker hoping to make it big with her band Black Stones to prove herself to her ex-boyfriend Ren who left to join Trapnest, a successful rock band fronted by Reira. NANA was also adapted into an amazing live-action film. Read about it here. OK …\n\nANNA TSUCHIYA inspi’ NANA (BLACK STONES) (2007), Tsuchiya‘s 2nd full-length album, collected her themes and inserted songs from NANA, as well as other tracks inspired by the anime. The sound is all rock and punk, no pop, and it is my favorite Anna Tsuchiya album. “rose”, “Kuroi Namida” and “LUCY” are included, as well as inserted songs “zero” and “I’m addicted to you”. The other tracks (“Without You”, “scream” and, my favorite, power ballad “Take me out”) are excellent, too; as is Sheryl Crow-ish B-side “Better Day”. OLIVIA released a similar character album, OLIVIA inspi’ REIRA (TRAPNEST) (2007), and the best of both were combined into NANA BEST (2007) with some new tracks, including, from Anna, the 5th ending theme “stand by me” and a cover of The Sex Pistols‘ “Anarchy In the UK” which, ironically, was the least punk of Tsuchiya‘s NANA songs.\n\nBut, is ANNA TSUCHIYA inspi’ NANA (BLACK STONES) an Anna Tsuchiya solo album or a soundtrack?\n\nNUDY SHOW! (2008), Anna Tsuchiya‘s 3rd [or 2nd] full-length album, incorporated more pop influences than her previous releases and, as such, it is my least favorite. “BUBBLE TRIP“, “cocoon“, “Crazy World“ (featuring Japanese R&B singer AI), and “Virgin Cat” were singles, while “GINGER“ (featuring pop/rockers MONKEY MAJIK) was also used to promote the album. Alt-rocker “cocoon” is the best (but, the album includes a softer rock version). Other good tracks on NUDY SHOW! are hard rocker “cockroach”, “u”, “Dirty Game”, and the ballad “Shape of Your Love”. As far as the poppier tracks are concerned, “Style” has a killer hook, while “Masquerade” is driven by a cool riff. “sweet sweet song” and “Imitation Night” are good B-sides, too. NUDY SHOW! is not bad, just my least favorite.\n\nR&B singer AI, by the way, is also a fellow half-American; and the band MONKEY MAJIK is half-Canadian.\n\nRULE (2010), Anna Tsuchiya‘s 4th [or 3rd] full-length album, is a perfect blend pop and rock; and, although inspi’ NANA is my favorite Anna Tsuchiya album, RULE is quite possibly Tsuchiya‘s masterpiece. “Brave vibration”, the 1st single, is pure pop/rock summer fun. It’s an unguilty pleasure and one of her best singles. Garage rocker “Atashi“ and symphonic metal rocker “Shout in the rain“ followed as the 2nd and 3rd singles. However, the album’s best song is the pop ballad “Believe in Love”, whose video was used to promote the album’s release. It is one of Tsuchiya‘s best vocal performances. Watch the videos for “Brave vibration” and “Believe in Love” here …\n\nBut, wait – there’s more! Grungy rocker “GUILTY”, Tsuchiya‘s 1st digital single, was used as the ending theme for the CG animation film Resident Evil: Degeneration (2008). Good song, bad movie. “HEY YOU!”, a B-side bonus track, is an energetic blast of pop/punk fire, and “Voice of butterfly” is another amazing ballad. Other favorites on RULE include garage rocker “She Hates Me”, pop/rocker “NEVER EVER” and Lady Gaga-esque “JUDGE”. Tsuchiya even gets all avant-pop on tracks like cabaret-esque “MY BATTLE” and jazzy “Boushoku-kei Danshi!!”. The latter is a collaboration with Japanese jazz instrumental band PE’Z. A fantastic collection!\n\n12 FLAVOR SONGS ~BEST COLLABORATION (2012) is a collection of collaborations Anna Tsuchiya had previously done with other artists, with two new tracks that, alone, are worth the price of admission. “IS THIS LOVE?” with Akihiro Nanba (of Japanese punk band HI-STANDARD) is hard rocking pop/punk at its finest, while “ALL RIGHT NOW” featuring Tak Matsumoto (of Japanese rock duo B’z) & Yuichi ‘AIK’ Ikuzawa is an excellent glam-metal power ballad. Watch the brief promotional video for “IS THIS LOVE?” here …\n\nOther good tracks on 12 FLAVOR SONGS (not already mentioned) include “THE LETTER” with American alt-rockers Hoobastank who had a #2 hit with “The Reason” in 2004; and “QUEEN OF THE ROCK” with Japanese guitarist Hotei Tomoyasu who is best known in the US for his instrumental “Battle Without Honor or Humanity“ (2000). If you’ve seen Quentin Tarantino‘s Kill Bill Volume 1 (2003) or any American action film since, then you’ve heard “Battle” or something like it. Anna Tsuchiya followed up 12 FLAVOR SONGS with her 15th single “Voyagers“, an infectious pop/rocker that was used as the theme for Kamen Rider Fourze the Movie (2012).\n\nLater in 2012, grungy rocker “CARRY ON”, Tsuchiya‘s 5th digital single, was used as the ending theme for the CG animation film Resident Evil: Damnation (2012), the sequel to Resident Evil: Degeneration (2008). Anna also joined the Halloween project HALLOWEEN JUNKY ORCHESTRA for their Danny Elfman-esque single “HALLOWEEN PARTY“. The project was created by hyde (L’Arc~en~Ciel) and K.A.Z (Oblivion Dust) [who, together, are rock duo VAMPS], and was like a Japanese version of Band Aid to celebrate Halloween 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Anna Tsuchiya formed the side project H†DER and released two singles, “DONE“ and “SB“. In March 2014, Anna released her 2nd mini-album Sugar Palm which is really just a single with 4 bonus live tracks. The EP’s sound is more Katy Perry than Joan Jett but, after the wonderful RULE, I’m OK with pop over rock. The title track is good, but “UP TO YOU” is insanely addictive. However, the best track is “Melt Into Blue”. I love that ballad’s tuneful guitar solo midway into crescendo. Hopefully, Tsuchiya‘s 5th [or 4th] solo album is coming soon!"
