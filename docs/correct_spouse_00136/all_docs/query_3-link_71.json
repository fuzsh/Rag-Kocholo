        "text": "Stamped: July 4th, 2007 | Related Posts\n\nTagged: Anna Tsuchiya, Jrock, Olivia Lufkin.\n\nAfter that Nana related post featuring two talented singers, Anna Tsuchiya and Olivia Lufkin, it is my duty to introduce them to this blog.\n\nSo first, we’re gonna focus on Anna Tsuchiya, and I keep the best for the end, Olivia Lufkin will be the next post on 7 July.\n\nWhy July 7th? Simply because I’ll go to her show on the 6th so I hope I’ll be able to get some live action there to post here.\n\nThe funny thing about Anna and Olivia who are the main singers of the Nana soundtrack is that they are both half-breed. American father and Japanese mother.\n\nWell, in Anna’s case, her dad is Russian American. Anna Tsuchiya (born in 1984 in Tokyo) started her young carreer at the age of 14 as a model. Later on, in 2002 she joined Kaz Iwaike to form Spin Aqua but it didn’t commercially work out and the duo ended up splitting in 2004, due to Anna’s pregnancy and engagement to fellow model Joshua. After the birth of Sky, in early July 2006, it was announced that Anna and Joshua were getting divorced.\n\nAnna made her acting debut in the movie Kamikaze Girls in 2004. I didn’t see the movie, but I have the soundtrack since it’s signed by Yoko Kanno (but I’m not fond of the soundtrack).\n\nAnna released one solo album, “Strip me” in 2006, the latest one being the Anna Tsuchiya Inspi’ Nana (Black Stones)one that also features in the Nana Best soundtrack that was reviewed before.\n\nShe also released a 6-song-mini-album entitled “Taste my beat” in 2005.\n\nHere is a Anna Tsuchiya backstage video, in Japanese, raw:\n\nGet the Flash Player to see this player.\n\nHere below are my fave songs from those two album/mini album. I won’t mention the Nana Blacks Stones one since some of the songs already feature in a previous playlist.\n\n1. Somebody Help Me: It’s one of the rare songs of the mini album I loved right away. She sings in English in all the albums and mini-album, except for certain songs with some little bit of Japanese.\n\n2. Ah Ah: I just picked 3 songs from this 6-song mini album, so that I don’t put the entire thing online ;). This one is not really my type of music, but I like the guitars. It sounds like Pink. Dunno…\n\n3. Frozen Rose: I love the heavier guitars here as well as the strings. It’s Evanescence-like.\n\n4. Zero: This one features in the Nana Best soundtrack. But I didn’t select it in the Nana Best Playlist, I wanted to, but I thought I did select too many tracks so much the compilation was good. But hopefully, there’s room for it in this playlist! Let’s rock!\n\n5. Under My Mask: Nice song, great arrangements. I love the guitars.\n\n6. No way: Nice melody.\n\n7. Slap that naughty body: This one is a funny one, it really reminds me of Pink."
