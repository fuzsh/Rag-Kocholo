        "text": "From Virtual Japan\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nThe young and well-diversified Anna Tsuchiya has already established herself in Japanese circles as a successful model, actress, singer, and songwriter at only 23 years of age.\n\nBorn into a Japanese/Russian-American family in Tokyo, Japan on March 11, 1984, Anna Tsuchiya was first “discovered” at the tender age of 14 by Seventeen magazine, through which she was able to launch a professional career in modeling. The young Japanese teen garnered much public attention and critical acclaim as a model, a role she has developed, pursued, and perfected even today.\n\nBy the year 2002, Anna’s modeling career led to TV commercial work, advertising products from Edwin, KOSE, UNIQLO, and more. Even after Anna moved on from modeling to pursue other interests, most notably singing and acting, she still appears in various ads and models for a number of high-profile magazines including Zipper, Kera, and Soup, among others.\n\nRight when her modeling career really began to take off in the early 2000s, Anna Tsuchiya expanded her interests into music, forming the short-lived and commercially unsuccessful band Spin Aqua with Kaz Iwaike (formerly of Oblivion Dust) late in 2002. The pair signed under the record label Ki/oon Records. All together, Spin Aqua performed one major concert, and released one album, three singles, and one video collection before going on hiatus to accommodate Anna’s engagement to model Joshua as well as her pregnancy—after which Spin Aqua broke up for good (2004).\n\nAlso in 2004, Anna Tsuchiya gave birth to her child, Sky (on November 19), and earlier in the year she had decided to delve into the competitive world of film acting with appearances in the Japanese movies Kamikaze Girls (English title) and The Taste of Tea.\n\nBy 2005, Anna was ready to face musical audiences again, but this time she had plans to go solo; and as a solo musical artist, Anna has enjoyed more success than she did as part of Spin Aqua. Taste My Beat, her debut, independent mini-album, released August 24, 2005. She also appeared in the film Bashment that year, and also supplied the voice of Maggie Peyton, famed actress Lindsay Lohan’s character in Herbie: Fully Loaded, in the Japanese-dubbed version of that film.\n\nBack onto the music scene, Anna released her first remix album (Taste My xxxremixxxxxxx!!!!!!!! Beat Life!) as well as her first full-length album (strip me?) in 2006. Anna also went on to appear in the films Memories of Matsuko and Sakuran (the latter in which she starred), both in 2006. Her latest acting project, [[Dororo], released in Hong Kong on March 15, 2007.\n\nHer marriage to Joshua didn’t last; an announcement was made in summer 2006 that the two were splitting up and on their way to getting officially divorced.\n\nAnna Tsuchiya’s full filmography\n\nDororo (2007)\n\nSakuran (2006)—Kiyoha\n\nKiraware Matsuko no isshô (Memories of Matsuko; 2006)—prisoner\n\nHerbie: Fully Loaded (Japanese dub; 2005)—voice of Maggie Peyton\n\nBashment (2005)\n\nCha no aji (The Taste of Tea; 2004)—Aoi Suzuishi\n\nShimotsuma monogatari (Kamikaze Girls; 2004)—Ichigo Shirayuri\n\nExternal Links"
