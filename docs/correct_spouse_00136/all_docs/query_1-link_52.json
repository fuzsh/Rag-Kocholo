        "text": "Since April Rudin and I (pictured) announced last month that we were publishing a book on wealth management, the response has been overwhelming. The industry is evolving rapidly, yet there is no comprehensive published playbook for senior leadership or financial advisors themselves. Thank you to Wiley for recognizing this gap! We've reconnected with friends and contacts who can add to the conversation. We're arranging interviews for the book everywhere from Brazil to Japan. And we've read around hundred articles and white papers on the industry in under a month – and we're not nearly done with the research! Six lessons for anyone who embarks on a similar endeavor: 1) Project plans are essential. Cutting up all the research, writing, and editing into bite-sized chunks relieves stress and ensures deadlines are manageable – although you still need to execute relentlessly to meet them. 2) You need to plan for changes to the plan. Some tasks will take more time than expected or less. Build in buffer weeks in case of delays and ensure you get ahead on tasks where you can. 3) Don't work chapter by chapter. Sketch out the entire book and then research chapters simultaneously. Research for one chapter will inform another and you'll quickly understand where there are overlaps or redundancies. It will also help you plan the entire project from start to finish. 4) Sound out other people regularly on each aspect of your approach. For instance, if you're heading for a dead end on a theme or topic, it's best to realize that after a week than a month. The process of writing a book is intense, and it's easy to miss the wood for the trees. 5) If you post regularly on social media - don't be worried about taking it down a notch. Most people post a bit less when they're writing. For instance, the personal profiles that I post here will be appearing less frequently - but when they come back, they'll be more directly relevant to the book. (Although that might not be true for April...) 6) Get a co-author! April and I are having a blast :) And, as ever, if you have any ideas, please post them in the comments or DM me! It takes a village… Maya Dillon Andreas K. Marielle Schurig, CFP®, CDFA Kim M. Sharan Olga Miler Mary Athridge Jason Hollands Daniel Goldstein Vinay Pande William J. Kelly, CAIA Cara Williams Phyllis Kurlander Costanza Andrew Lee Ben Yearsley Richard Philbin Frank Aalderinks William R. Rachel Wood\n\nDelighted to have attended Private Equity International’s hashtag #NEXUS2024 conference in Florida this month, with speakers including Advent International’s David Mussafer, The Carlyle Group’s David Rubinstein, Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.’s Howard Marks, Blackstone’s Jon Gray, Thoma Bravo’s Orlando Bravo, and KKR’s Scott Nuttall. Of the themes explored at the event, interest rate normalization loomed large. Our economy, and the private markets industry, has never had to navigate a shift from zero interest rates to a more typical environment like the one we see today. This is an opportunity for private credit but requires great skill for managers who use significant leverage. US private markets managers’ approach to sustainability is also evolving, in tandem with the evolution we are seeing in public markets. Managers are emphasizing factors which are highly material to returns and opportunities, most notably the energy transition. This was an excellent forum for networking with private markets asset managers and their investors, and it was great to meet so many folks there, including Elizabeth Burton, Antonio N., Assaad Henoud, Adam Spence, Andrew Johnson, Daniel Goldstein, Regina Carls, Mark Buchanan, Andrew Siwo, Anna Totdahl, David Fann, Brian Bank, Eli Plangger, Nithin Johnson, and the folks at PEI. And grateful to have been able to spend time with the Brunswick Group team (below) too. Looking forward to 2025!

I’ve written about them for Financial Times. I’ve worked for one of them (UBS). And I’ve advised them at Brunswick Group. As a community, they are an author’s dream, combining outstanding business acumen with remarkable empathy for individuals and their deepest personal needs. Yet, there is a lack of book-length content for and about this community compared with some other financial professions. I am therefore thrilled to announce that I will be publishing a book on wealth management and financial advice next year, in partnership with the renowned multinational publishing firm Wiley. The book will cover the industry’s transformation in the twenty-first century and key opportunities that are available to wealth managers and financial advisors today. It will also serve as a readable guide to those who wish to learn more about this fast-growing field. Publishing a book can take a village, and so I am also delighted to announce my partners on this project. My co-author will be the renowned wealth management marketing expert and influencer April Rudin. And our editor will be Wiley finance and accounting specialist Judith Newlin. April and I (see selfie) have known each other for over a decade. She published articles with me at FT. I was a client of hers at UBS. Now, we are in the agency world together. April is an industry pioneer but also a true friend. It’s such a pleasure to be working with her once again. We are also both equally grateful to be collaborating with Judith (and thanks to Nicole Casperson for putting us in touch). Judith is a wonderful partner with a deep understanding of this venture, and we are looking forward to meeting more colleagues of hers at Wiley as we proceed. Lastly, but most importantly, I dedicate this book to my wife Juliya Arbisman and our three sons, who have been so supportive of and patient with my writing over the years. It’s been a while since I published an actual physical book, and I can’t wait to give them a copy! Thanks to everyone at Brunswick, Wiley, and April’s firm The Rudin Group for their help and encouragement. And if you are a wealth manager or financial advisor and have an amazing story to tell me, please get in touch. I would love to hear it.\n\nPEI NEXUS is shaping up to be one of the top US private markets events this year. Hosted this week in Orlando, it will bring together some of the biggest names in the industry, including Blackstone’s Jon Gray, The Carlyle Group’s David Rubinstein, KKR’s Scott Nuttall, Oaktree Capital Management, L.P.’s Howard Marks, Thoma Bravo’s Orlando Bravo, and Warburg Pincus LLC’s Chip Kaye. I’m delighted to be attending #nexus2024 alongside four colleagues from Brunswick’s financial institutions group: Devin Paulsen, Nathalie Vattery Val, Zaman Toleafoa, and Kai Goldynia (from left to right in the pic below). Please see some mini profiles on my colleagues below and let us know if you’d like to meet up there! Zaman is a veteran financial services communications expert who has held roles in high places in all three of the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions. A New Zealander, he and I first met in London over a drink (or two) during the global financial crisis. Few can match his combination of affable charm and industry expertise; just don’t talk to him about rugby if the All Blacks lose the day before.) Kai helps manage our financial institutions group. Over his career, he has somehow also found the time to be executive director of a non-profit as well as a deputy policy director for a Congressional campaign, alongside many other responsibilities. Like Zaman, he is a globetrotter, having worked and studied in a variety of places including NYC, Chicago, Massachusetts, Edinburgh, and Singapore. Nathalie is an account director who works across a variety of clients, including in the private markets industry, and supports companies through different types of financial situations. A graduate of Singapore Management University, she spent over two years in our Singapore office before moving to New York. Nathalie has incredibly wide experience across other geographies, most notably returning from yet another stint with a client in the Middle East. Devin is an account director and one of the most entrepreneurial members of our team. While still at university in Utah, he founded his own communications consultancy, and has brought that energy and knowledge to since starting at Brunswick two years ago. A Wall Streeter at heart, he works across a number of our financial institutions and investor relations clients.

Next month it will have been a decade since Russia annexed Crimea. This new profile in my weekly series focuses on Natalie Jaresko, a key figure in Ukraine’s financial history following the annexation and a veteran advocate for the Ukrainian people. Natalie grew up in Illinois and moved to Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union. She was economic section chief at the American embassy and later founded a number of investment funds focused on Ukraine and eastern Europe. During the global financial crisis, Ukraine suffered a deep recession. The annexation of Crimea and Russia’s infiltration in the east dealt it another severe blow. The country appointed Natalie as finance minister in 2014 and charged her with turning around its economy. During Natalie’s tenure, Ukraine agreed a $40 billion package that put the country on a path to growth. Eventually, Natalie returned to the US. As executive director of the financial oversight and management board for Puerto Rico, she helped oversee the island’s recovery from its municipal bankruptcy, restructuring tens of billions of dollars of debt and other liabilities. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Natalie partnered with Red Ventures CEO Ric Elias on Stronger Than Ever – a humanitarian organization focused initially on medical supplies for Ukraine. She has also participated in an array of other activities in the wake of the invasion, ranging from supporting war victims to recommending economic reforms. More broadly, in a period of global uncertainty and elevated debt costs, her skills in restructurings and turnarounds will likely only become more relevant this year and beyond. Natalie, best of luck with all your future endeavors and glory to Ukraine!

Please read his remarkable bio from our press release below and join all of us at the firm in congratulating him on his new role! \"Since 2019, Henry Timms has been the President and CEO of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, one of the world's leading cultural institutions. At Lincoln Center, he oversaw a period of significant transformation, reimagining the campus and its programming to make the arts more accessible to diverse audiences. Henry championed initiatives to engage new generations of artists and audiences while also emphasizing the importance of digital technology in the arts. \"During his tenure he led the acceleration and completion of fundraising for the $550m David Geffen Hall project in New York which created over 6,000 jobs and over half a billion dollars of economic activity. He is deeply committed to diversity and inclusion and significantly improved representation of leadership, as well as transforming the center’s programming to showcase different backgrounds and perspectives. \"Previously, Henry gained wide-spread recognition as the President and CEO of the 92nd Street Y, a renowned cultural and community center in Manhattan. Under his leadership, the 92nd Street Y experienced a revitalization, embracing digital innovation and expanding its reach to a global audience. \"Henry is the creator and co-founder of the Giving Tuesday global philanthropic movement that has raised over $13 billion since its launch in 2012, and the co-author of the internationally best-selling book New Power. He is also a visiting fellow at the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford Centre for Corporate Reputation.\" https://lnkd.in/eKCikT-p\n\nSome people know Vinay Pande as an investment expert. Others know him as a carpet collector. This fifth profile in my weekly series takes me to his house in Greenwich, Connecticut – a Mecca for investors, but also home to Vinay, his family, and their remarkable assortment of rugs. Vinay grew up and studied in India, before coming to the US and rising to become chief investment officer of the World Bank in his thirties. Later, he moved onto a distinguished career on Wall Street. Six years ago, he gave me and Beckie Strum a tour of his home and the historic rug and textile collection that decorated every inch of it. Beckie would write the definitive profile of Vinay and his collection below. “You would be forgiven for mistaking Vinay Pande for a rug dealer by the sight of his living room alone,” she wrote. “Flat-woven tribal patterns from modern-day Turkmenistan hang one after the other on the walls, rare rugs overlap on the floor like patchwork – including one 25 feet long – and dummies draped in embroidered robes from Palestine and dyed silks from Uzbekistan linger together at the edges of the room.” Nevertheless, housing such an array in a single abode had its challenges. “At one point, running out of space in his roughly 6,000-square-ft. home, he toyed with displaying rugs on the ceiling… until one slipped onto his mother’s head.” And Vinay even faced aesthetic obstacles from within his own household. “The tour of his vast collection takes a glaring hiatus at the threshold to the bedroom of his 19-year-old daughter, Malavika. Instead of death metal and cigarettes, his daughter’s very specific form of rebellion includes an Ikea carpet.” However, even a skeptic would be struck by the stories behind the collection – one example being the “wedding rug” in Vinay’s dining room. “Woven in red, white, and blue, this roughly four-ft.-wide sample was the first thing a Tekke girl from modern-day Turkmenistan would weave to serve as a rug to stand on for her wedding day. The pieces usually lived the rest of their functional lives as hearth rugs, meaning very few survived, Pande explains. “That this one was in such good condition is a sign the woman who made it died, perhaps in childbirth, Pande speculates. Still, her memory lives on in the asymmetric border she wove.” I could quote from this article all day, so I’ll encourage you to check it out in full. And flagging it to a few folks who might enjoy reading or rereading it: Peter Dillon Maya Dillon Kim Mitchell Jennifer Cuminale, MBA Liza Eliano Chanel Caraway, MA Darrell Rocha Deidrea Miller Annie Belz David Lasserson Imogen Walford Sarah West Claire Walsh Gerald Lucas Yang Tang Miguel Costa Andrew Lee Alejo Czerwonko, Ph.D. Jorge Mariscal David Lefkowitz Tom McLoughlin Laura Kane, CFA, CPA Leslie Falconio Solita Marcelli Mike Ryan, CFA Mae Cheng Duncan Mavin Richard C. Morais Abby Schultz https://lnkd.in/gTCurpMU\n\nThis new profile in my weekly series takes me back to London – specifically, to a terrible incident that is already well known in the UK but should serve as a warning to those of us overseas. I got to know Sarah de Lagarde when I was an investment journalist and she was working for two global financial services companies, F&C and BNY Mellon. She was always the consummate communications professional – friendly, punctual, and to the point. We lost touch after I moved back to the US in 2012. In the decade since, Sarah not only rose to become head of communications at another big financial institution, Janus Henderson Investors, but also somehow found the time to raise two daughters and publish three books. In 2022, Sarah was returning home from work when she slipped on a London subway platform and fell on the tracks. Two trains crushed her limbs before she was rescued. Doctors had to replace her right arm and leg with prosthetics. In her own words, Sarah is now 80% human, 20% robot. But her recovery has been remarkable. She has become a motivational speaker and a prominent campaigner for inclusion and other issues. And she has taken on even more responsibility at Janus Henderson, which recently promoted her to head of corporate affairs. But although she has triumphed amid excruciating adversity, her accident has also shown us that the world needs a safety upgrade. Features that are already installed at many stations could have prevented her injuries. And Sarah’s experience is the tip of the iceberg. Millions of people globally live and work in conditions that are far less healthy and secure than in the UK. Sarah has campaigned excellently on this topic, and hopefully her work will make an even bigger impact in years to come. If you want to read more about Sarah, I thoroughly recommend her website below. And here’s a shout-out to some of our mutual acquaintances and colleagues past and present: Candice Sun Greg Trinks, CIMA® Jenna Barnard Dean Cheeseman Lucy Ausden Beth Saint Estelle Bibby Charlotte Banks James Rainbow James Cardew Jennifer Brogadir Jamie Brookes Asmita Kapadia Kira Nickerson Stan Neve Jason Hollands Paula Garrido Karolina Adamkiewicz Richard Philbin Tom Caddick Toby Vaughan Fatima Luis https://lnkd.in/eNNSvWbR\n\nAs promised, here comes a third mini profile of some of the amazing LinkedIn connections I’ve met over the years. This week, I’ll be talking about Craig Mullaney, who’s had one of the most intriguing careers of anybody I know on this platform. Craig went to West Point. He was a Rhodes Scholar. He served in the Middle East after 9/11. He advised Barack Obama. He was a senior Pentagon official. He wrote a bestselling memoir. He became SVP of a Silicon Valley business then ran Meta’s work with global content creators. He joined Brunswick Group as a partner and created our Connected Leadership practice. To cap it all, he is a committed husband and father of four children. But what stands out about Craig when you meet him is not just his authority, but his humility. Craig is a devotee of Japanese culture, and that team spirit and discipline shine through in his approach to work and life. (If you want an example, read his recent post about how to write a book on LinkedIn.) Among all the other things he has done, Craig has made an integral contribution to Brunswick’s global Japan team and serves on the board of the US-Japan Foundation. If you want to learn more about Craig, read his memoir The Unforgiving Minute and follow him on LinkedIn. And check out some other current and former members of Brunswick’s global Japan team - Daisuke Tsuchiya, David Ashton, Akiko Karaki, Tereza Kaneta, MASATO UI, Daisuke Abe, Kyoko Kado, Marie Tanao, Yoshihisa Kita, Ken Shibusawa, Ken Weinstein - and of our digital team - Michael Krempasky, Austin Rathe, Janelle Nowak-Santo, Marshall Manson, Erin Meijer, Chad Giron, Bethany Wheatley, Kayla Kahn, Elizabeth Farlow, Kirsty Cameron, Emilia Sipila, Zachary Yates, James McCobb, Matt Brown, Courtney Fairclough."
