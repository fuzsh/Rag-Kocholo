        "text": "\"I find beauty in the dark side or in people's anger!\" confesses a boisterous Anna Tsuchiya. Surprisingly, Japan's choice wild-child actress, model and singer did not talk about herself egotistically, but merely justified her love of Chopin over Mozart: \"When I (first) listened to Chopin's 'The Revolution,' I thought classical music is rock music,\" she says. \"It was beautiful and I wanted to go into rock!\"\n\nTsuchiya, 25, is gearing up for her performance at the New Classic Gig, a unique live event that sees unlikely musicians paired with a full orchestra, all as part of a fashion show directed by creator Hideki Matsui (a Europe-based fashion designer â€” not the New York Yankees baseball player).\n\n\"This event is called 'classic' but it is not classical at all. Nobody has ever listened to this kind of music,\" says Matsui."
