        "text": "News Archive >> Anna Tsuchiya's Divorce from Joshua\n\nAnna Tsuchiya's Divorce\n\nJoint Custody of Her Son\n\nAnna Tsuchiya's Official Website announced the divorce of the singer/actress/model from her husband Joshua on July 5th. It states that \"Anna Tsuchiya and Joshua respect one another's intentions and will go separate ways.\" Their divorce report has been submitted to Tokyo's ward office. The couple was living in separate houses several months before the divorce. The reason given for the break-up, was that Anna's work schedule has heavily increased, causing the couple to continue missing out on one another. Anna and Joshua announced their marriage and pregnancy of their child back in June 2004. After giving birth to their child in November 2004, Anna's status was promoted to be an actress for her outstanding performance in \"Shimotsuma Monogatari (Kamekaze Girls).\" Later, Anna was also put in charge of \"NANA Anime's\" opening theme song, \"Rose.\" It has been decided that after divorcing, the couple will have joint custody of their son.\n\nSources: [ Yahoo News 1 || Yahoo News 2 ]"
