Oracle Corp. has formally rechristened the transportation management software it acquired through the purchase of Global Logistics Technologies Inc. (G-Log), the enterprise database and applications vendor announced Tuesday.

The G-Log software, previously known as Global Command and Control Center (GC3), will now be rebranded Oracle Transportation Management, according to Mark Johnson, senior director of product marketing for Oracle Transportation Management.

Oracle is no longer selling its previous offerings in the same space as G-Log, Oracle Transportation Execution (TE) and Oracle Transportation Planning (TP), Johnson said in a phone interview Tuesday. There were about 100 users of the Oracle products and the majority of them plan to move over to Oracle Transportation Management, he added.

Oracle completed its acquisition of privately held G-Log in November of last year. Financial details of the transaction have yet to be revealed. Johnson said that more than 90 percent of G-Log’s employees have joined Oracle.

With about one quarter of existing GC3 G-Log users using applications from Oracle’s rival SAP AG, users will continue to be able to buy a stand-alone version of Oracle Transportation Management. The next major release of the product, what would’ve been GC3 version 5.5, is due out later this year, according to Johnson.

At the same time, Oracle is working on integrating the transportation management software with its E-Business Suite, he added. Most of the Oracle staff previously involved in the TE and TP software are working on the integration, which should also be complete some time later this year, Johnson said.
