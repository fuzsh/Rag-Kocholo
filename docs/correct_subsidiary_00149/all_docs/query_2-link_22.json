My history with OTM goes back to the GLOG days in 2004 Version 4.5. I have always worked in non-cloud solutions to this point and appreciate the trend of progress to cloud solutions. My focus on the application for most of my career has been towards the technical side of the product. I have transitioned more to the functional side in the last few years to broaden my horizons. The areas within the application I've focused on include integration, order management, planning and execution, track and track, freight settlement / billing and Fusion Transportation intelligence. A day cannot go by that you do not learn something new or identify another bug or enhancement in OTM. I've attended probably 10 OTM SIG conferences, and look forward to meeting new people and catching up with old friends at each year. The passion the user group has for solving problems and sharing ideas are what make the product, its users, and the yearly conference so great. As a board member for the last two years, I've come to understand how large the conference is from a coordination stand point, and appreciate the input of feedback on ideas on making things even better.\n\nWhen outside of the world of OTM and supply chain solutions, I have a lovely wife and 8 year old twins. I love the mountains, hiking, camping, vegetable gardening, playing hockey, and also consider myself a “foodie”.\n\nRuchir Srivastava\n\nBoard Member, Americas\n\nOrganization: Starbucks\n\nEmail: rsrivast@starbucks.com\n\nI have 19+ years of total logistics experience which spans across pre-sales, product development, consulting, program management and people management.

In this role I lead global transportation planning and execution from first mile to last mile within our transportation network, manage freight audit and pay for our carriers & provide trade compliance solutions for our shipping network.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, playing sports and traveling.\n\nRyan Troutman\n\nBoard Member, Americas\n\nOrganization: Kuehne & Nagel\n\nEmail: ryan.troutman@kuehne-nagel.com\n\nI’ve worked for Kuehne + Nagel for 10 years, all directly dealing with OTM (v5.5 - 6.4.3). I started in support, quickly moving to implementation and design. Most recently I am responsible for the oversight, governance and standardization of our OTM solutions throughout our regional teams (NAM/SAM, EU, APAC). I have been a regular attendee of the US SIG in Philadelphia and look forward to sharing/learning unique challenges and intriguing solutions each year. In my free time I enjoy working out, cooking, and spending time with my wife, daughter and two bulldogs.\n\nGiovanni Lovo\n\nAssociate Board Member, EMEA/APAC\n\nOrganisation: Oracle\n\nEmail: giovanni.lovo@oracle.com\n\nGiovanni Lovo leads for Oracle Consulting the EMEA OTM/GTM Practice which provides implementation services to customers in the Region.\n\nSince November 2015 he has been an active member of the EMEA OTM SIG Board.
