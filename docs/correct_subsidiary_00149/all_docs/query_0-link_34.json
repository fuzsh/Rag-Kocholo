Whether you implement one module or the entire suite. Oracle E-Business Suite can help you make smarter decisions with better information, share unified information across the enterprise reduce IT expenses, and run your business more efficiently.\n\nArchitecturally, Oracle E-Business Suite is:\n\nIntegrated, Yet Modular\n\nManaging a tangle of connections between point solutions is extremely costly and complex. Any time you update a point solution, you must go back and review all integration points and potentially update the integration software. Oracle E-Business Suite is engineered to work together as an integrated system on a common IT infrastructure. You can seamlessly pass information from one application to another without incurring incremental integration costs. While Oracle's applications are integrated - they are also modular. Based on your business needs, you can implement one module, several modules, or the entire suite. Oracle's open, standards-based architecture allows you to easily integrate into a heterogeneous environment, enabling you to fully leverage your investment in existing applications.\n\nBuilt on a Common Data Model\n\nWhen you maintain information in multiple silos, no one in your organization has a complete, real-time view of your data. Oracle E-Business Suite is the first and only comprehensive set of applications for the enterprise that is integrated around a single, common data model. Oracles unified information architecture consolidates data from Oracle and non-Oracle applications and allows a consistent definition of customers, suppliers, partners, employees, and all business entities across the enterprise. You create a single global definition so that everyone, worldwide, is accessing the same data. Oracle's single, common data model ensures accurate and consistent information and transaction flows across all applications.\n\nRuns on a Single Global Instance\n\nThe best-of-breed approach fragments a company's business processes and information into separate application systems and separate databases, a common and costly mistake. With financial data in one database, human resources data in another, and so on, it makes it nearly impossible to collaborate and access information across geographies and business processes. Oracle E-Business Suite, the first and only comprehensive set of applications able to run on a single global instance, allows you to maintain your enterprise-wide data in one place. This provides the foundation for complete and consolidated information such as sales positions, inventory levels and revenue across all organizations, lines of business, products, and geographies. Once information resides in the same instance, executives, managers, and users at all levels can query in a variety of ways for personalized, on-demand business intelligence. With fewer instances, it is easier to share information across organizations, enabling better cooperation and greater productivity across departments. This also eliminates the IT costs associated with duplicate data centers, hardware, and multiple databases around the world. With consolidation you can create shared service centers more easily to further decrease costs and increase operational efficiencies.\n\nCompanies can manage their worldwide operations using a single, standard installation providing consolidated data globally while ensuring fiscal and statutory compliance around the world. Oracle offers a truly global product that supports multiple languages, multiple currencies, unique global business practices, and local statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nFunctionally. Oracle E-Business Suite Enables You To:\n\nAutomate All Business Processes\n\nCONFIDENTIAL ORCL-EDOC-00244083\n\nMany businesses have a variety of disparate systems that focus on independent functions such as sales, purchasing, order management, and manufacturing. Typically, these systems are not designed to work together, resulting in multiple silos of information and non-integrated business transactions. Oracle's applications are engineered to work together to automate end-to-end business processes, across both front-and back-office operations. Oracle E-Business Suite is the industry's most functionally complete set of business applications. It streamlines every area, including marketing, sales, service, contracts, order management, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, financials, projects, human resources, and professional services automation. Oracle has leveraged extensive industry and implementation experience to develop standard, automated processes that are based on leading business practices.\n\nCollaborate with Trading Partners\n\nHistorically, business applications were focused on improving a company's internal functions. Oracle E-Business Suite extends internal process support beyond enterprise boundaries to include customers, suppliers and other trading partners. Collaboration enables you to include your customers and suppliers earlier in product development, planning, procurement, order fulfillment, and other business processes. You can easily share real-time information with partners such as designs, forecasts, orders, and delivery status. Linking your enterprise with your customers and suppliers offers global visibility and enables bi-directional flow of business information. For instance, your customers can easily configure, price, and order products in real time on a web store, and the order information flows seamlessly to order management and shipping for fulfillment. Similarly, suppliers can get self-service access to orders, schedules and payment status on their personalized portal, accessible through a simple web browser. Connecting enterprises enables you to rapidly respond to dynamic market conditions while improving your ability to meet customer commitments.\n\nDeliver Integrated Intelligence\n\nYou can spend millions of dollars on application software and still not be able to collect, let alone effectively distribute, the information that is critical to keeping your business profitable. Oracle E-Business Suite is the only comprehensive software that can provide immediate access to high-quality-business intelligence. Every application in Oracle E-Business Suite can run in one global instance. All the applications work together and share the same information. The result is a comprehensive suite of applications that provides information which is displayed in customizable portals, revealing critical details such as inventory levels, headcount, revenue, and expenses--across all organizations, lines of business, products, and geographies. Oracle's integrated intelligence spans all areas of your business and is for use by all people--including executives, managers, employees, customers, suppliers, and partners.\n\nBecause the business intelligence systems and the data sit in the same system, you no longer wait for data to pass through a separate data aggregation and analysis system. You get up-to-date business information that reveals the state of your business every day, relative to past, present, and projected performance metrics. This allows your decision makers to reach more informed conclusions, make daily corrections, and drive the business towards achieving its profitability goalsdaily, not monthly or quarterly.\n\nAvailable in a Hosted Environment\n\nStop Wasting Money Managing Your Applications\n\nManaging your software, systems and hardware is costly and time consuming. When employing an in-house deployment and management model, you must hire and educate your in-house IT staff and invest in expensive equipment to run your systems. With Oracle E-Business Suite Outsourcing, Oracle experts host, monitor, administer, upgrade, and maintain your Oracle software so you do not have to hire additional IT staff or make further IT infrastructure investments. Oracle Applications experts are managing and maintaining your software so they can detect and resolve product support issues more quickly and efficiently. Upgrades are easy as Oracle handles both point release and major updates. And you benefit from having Oracle experts always keeping your systems on the latest version of the Oracle E-Business Suite. On average, Oracle customers save up to 50% in IT costs and achieve up to 50% better service. (Source: IDC The Financial Returns of Software as a Service. March 2002).\n\nCONFIDENTIAL ORCL-EDOC-00244084\n\nHow does Release 11i reduce IT expenses with the lowest-cost deployment options?\n\nFor companies looking to reduce IT costs, Oracle E-Business Suite 11i applications can be delivered as a service over the Internet. Oracle E-Business Suite Outsourcing provides customers with an extremely low-cost deployment option. With E-Business Suite Outsourcing, Oracle manages the availability, security, changes, and performance or the E-Business Suite allowing customers to focus on their core competency of running their businesses and controlling operational expenses.\n\nWith E-Business Suite Outsourcing. Oracle Consulting or an authorized implementor installs Oracle's software on your servers or Oracle servers, and Oracle provides applications experts who maintain your software and hardware. Oracle provides a complete service offering and you access the applications through a secure browser. IDC and Gartner both say that the cost to manage enterprise applications can be up to 4x the purchase price of the software per year.\n\nOur customers are saving up to 84% of their business expenses by lowering implementation costs, upfront capital costs and ongoing IT maintenance expenses. In addition, companies have saved on implementation time by as much as 75%.\n\nOracle Consulting continues to reduce the time frame required to implement Oracle Applications by leveraging client experience to develop rapid implementation services such as Business Flow Accelerators and to decrease the time and cost of implementation through E-Consulting.\n\nBusiness Flow Accelerators\n\nOracle Business Flow Accelerators are Oracle Consulting offerings that provide a pre-configured baseline for implementing the business flows inherent in the E-Business Suite. Designed for large to medium-sized organization in a variety of industries. Business Flow Accelerators help customers around the world solve their business problems, reduce risk and realize a very fast return on investment (ROI).\n\nE-Consulting\n\nE-Consulting is a service delivery option enabling Oracle Consulting to provide implementation services over the Internet E-Consulting includes web-based project collaboration work spaces, 24x7 availability of offsite consulting experts located around the world for real-time or project oriented work, and pre-seeded project work spaces to get customers up and running quickly. Once a company starts the implementation with Oracle Consulting, we can deploy consultants around the world to collaborate over the web to expedite implementation timeframes. Consultants in remote locations are able to collaborate on projects on 24x7 basis. By fully leveraging, our resources, we're able to get customers up and running quickly and at a lower cost.\n\nApplications Implementation Methodology\n\nOur methods and tools are evolving to meet the challenge of the marketplace for faster, more cost effective implementations, AIM for business flows is the latest release of Oracle Consulting's proven Application Implementation Method (AIM). It incorporates changes that support the use of Oracle business flows, associated software environments, and tools, to keep the focus of an implementation on business processes and benefits, instead of software features and functions. Some of the key changes in the method include:\n\nRapid establishment of a pre-configured, proven application environment based on Oracle business flows to provide customers early access to a working application instance.\n\nUse of Oracle's standard business flows as a starting point for defining the customer's future business processes.\n\nEmployment of hands-on, iterative Conference Room Pilot (CRP) evolutions, throughout the project lifecycle, to converge on a tailored solution that best meets the customer's business needs.\n\nIn addition to these programs. Oracle has developed several product solutions to help reduce the cost of implementing an applications solution. Beginning with Release 11i, the Rapid Install is a new way to install Oracle Applications and its required technology stack. The product has been made available at all 11i maintenance levels. Rapid Install replaces the One-hour Install, which was the primary installation\n\nCONFIDENTIAL ORCL-EDOC-00244085\n\nutility for Release 11.0. Using the Rapid Install, you unload the applications and all required technology components into an Optimal Flexible Architecture (OFA) compliant configuration on a single node (machine) or multiple nodes by responding to a few setup questions and then letting the Rapid Install do the setup for you. Thus, new customers will reduce their installation time significantly as steps such as installing database objects and generating forms and reports are obviated. The Rapid Install also configures and starts all server processes, thereby reducing many manual configuration steps after the installation. For Release 11i, upgrade customers can also benefit as they can utilize the pre-configured technology stack for the new release and the pre-built Oracle Applications forms, reports and executables.\n\nHow does Release 11i architecture support integration, common data models, and a single global instance?\n\nSales\n\nBecoming an e-business requires using the power of the Internet to become more efficient, increase sales, and retain customers. Oracle Sales applications enable sales professionals to be more effective by providing them with up-to-the-minute prospect, customer, and product information whenever and wherever they need it. This integrated approach also enables organizations to become more efficient by allowing salespeople to use whatever interface best fits their needs  a laptop, a handheld device  or other. Oracle Sales applications help organizations achieve their goal of higher customer retention by ensuring that customers have a consistent level of service regardless of how they interact with an organization  over the phone, through the Internet, with the direct salesforce, or via partners and resellers. While this high level of service is constantly achieved, costs are also lowered through increased selling effectiveness and the collaboration of sales and customer information.\n\nIn addition, our focus on developing solutions for sales is not just-reactive. We are committed to delivering tools that help organizations sell. This includes Quoting and Proposals systems that help your sales organization close more business. By integrating our sales tools with the full Oracle E-Business Suite, we make this process both more comprehensive and more cost effective.\n\nMarketing\n\nOracle Marketing's integration with the Oracle E-Business Suite ensures that customer information is based on a single source. The result is that the marketing organization is connected and informed by other departments within the enterprise on customer history, preferences and data. Through this collaboration with other departments, marketing can leverage complete customer information from customer service and sales, as well as back office operations, to identify cross sell and up sell opportunities as the basis for creating effective marketing campaigns. Oracle Marketing is also workflow driven so that routine tasks are automated and streamlined allowing marketers to focus on key marketing objectives rather than administrative minutiae.\n\nService\n\nUsing Oracle Service applications global organizations can offer 24x7 customer support around the globe, eliminating the need for staff overtime in any given area. Rather than waking a service representative up with a pager, or maintaining a full night shift, global businesses can take a follow-the-sun approach by establishing call centers around the world to cater to different time zones. However, in order to successfully run a global operation, a business must be set up to access a common knowledge base, share customer information and maintain up-to-the minute status on all customer related activities across the organization in real time. Oracle Service applications make it possible for businesses to collect and maintain customer information in a single file, ensuring consistent, up-to-date information for effective customer management. Within the Oracle E-Business Suite. Oracle Service applications are able to provide a centralized customer support reporting and resolution system. Superior customer intelligence and customer care capabilities ensure that every employee who interacts with customers has access to a wealth of historical and current information about each customer they are serving regardless of location, and of interaction channel. Particularly suited for global entities. Oracle Service applications accommodate over 25 languages, all currencies, and regulatory requirements in a shared base of operations information.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL ORCL-EDOC-00244086\n\nInteraction Center\n\nOracle Interaction Center as part of the E-Business Suite shares information between applications as well as between departments, organization, sites as determined by management. Multi-site contact centers share information via the integrated applications and calls, or emails are sent to the most appropriate agent at any location depending on skill set, time of day or activity volume. Multi-site contact centers, provided through integrated Oracle/Cisco solution, provide the opportunity to cut employee costs by running contact centers in lower cost locations, or even in the employee's home.\n\nE-Commerce\n\nOracle E-Commerce is a component of Oracle E-Business Suite, which lets you put your entire customer management, supply chain, and internal operations online. The integration of Oracle E-Commerce applications with all other Oracle E-Business Suite applications enables you to transform your e-commerce site into a powerful self-service environment. A fully integrated e-commerce solution eliminates the need to piece-together offerings from multiple vendorssaving you the cost of additional licensing fees, the complexity of custom integration projects, and the headache of trying to create a consistent interface between applications so you can present one face to your customers. Another advantage of Oracle's E-Commerce integration is that information on customer touch-points collected via the Web is stored in the Oracle database. You can blend that information with information you collect over the phone or in person. This gives a business a complete 360-degree view of each customer and optimizes sales, marketing, and servicing opportunitiesregardless of which interaction channel the customer uses. Additionally, integration with back office systems enables online marketing, sales, and service efforts to access past customer purchases and service histories to automatically personalize the user's Web experience. Oracle E-Commerce applications enable companies to run global storefronts, each with localized currencies, languages, and moreall from a single instance.\n\nThe following are part of Oracle's eCommerce solution, which enable customers to serve themselves to find answers to questions, purchase products, etc. In summary these components allow organizations to establish a powerful web presence.\n\nOracle iStore\n\nOracle iStore is an end-to-end e-commerce application for creating, deploying, and maintaining customized online storefronts. Oracle iStore includes everything needed for global commerce: a product catalogue with extensive search capabilities, a shopping cart which can be saved and shared with other users, customer profiling and personalization, and even customer service features such as order tracking. iStore includes comprehensive integration to traditional front and back office applications in order to completely automate (streamline) the process of self-service ordering from click to final delivery.\n\nOracle Marketing Online\n\nMarketing Onlines eMerchandising capabilities manage affiliate links, banner campaigns, online event sign-ups, surveys, discounts, coupons, merchandising and more. Web surfers click on a website link and are transported directly to the checkout stand of a merchant's site to complete the purchase. Additionally, Marketing Online can provide store shoppers with cross-sell/up-sell, or \"buy this instead\" recommendations. They may also track performance metrics of campaigns, such as click-throughs and resultant purchases.\n\nOracle iPayment\n\nThe iPayment component provides payment services including credit card authorization and clearing, payment routing based on business rules, and even manages credit risk. iPayment works with the most popular payment processing systems such as Cybercash and Verifone, and supports the Internet security standards of SSL and SET.\n\nOracle iSupport\n\nOracle iSupport is a comprehensive customer facing service portal that allows customers to receive self-service over the InternetiSupport enables corporations to setup a customer information portal where customers may view order status, outstanding invoices, payment history, service contracts, and installed\n\nCONFIDENTIAL ORCL-EDOC-00244087\n\nproducts, as well as initiate service requests and return merchandise. By having customers maintain their own data, such as installed products or personal and user account information, companies can maintain a higher level of data accuracy without incurring any additional cost. By offering a secure, personalized experience for a wide range of self- service functions, iSupport enables service organizations to minimize the total cost of customer support and call center operations. Oracle iSupport also offers powerful Knowledge Management tools allowing customers to search for and resolve their own issues. Empowering customers through self-service and self-administration helps Service organizations to remain competitive and successful. Additionally, with integration to iStore, companies can provide a seamless online sales and service environment.\n\nOracle eMail Center\n\nOracle eMail Center manages high volumes of inbound and outbound customer emails. Oracle eMail Center automatically classifies the emails coming into an organization, and creates suggested responses based on message content. If the system cannot automatically create a response for an incoming message, the email will be routed to the appropriate call center agent based on email content and agent skills for follow up.\n\nContracts\n\nOracle Contracts automates the full contracts life cycle and enables companies to manage internal and external obligations, control contractual deliverables, and enforce business practices. It provides the flexibility and scalability to allow organization to change and grow as their businesses and processes evolve to keep pace with the needs of the market. Oracle Contracts is built around the concept of a standardized common data model. This data model enables companies to synchronize isolated silos of information throughout the enterprise, so marketing, sales, customer service, and back-office divisions such as distribution and manufacturing all work from a single, consistent view of each customer.\n\nOracle Contracts is a component of Oracle E-Business Suite, which transforms your business into a global e-business by bringing your customers, suppliers, and employees online. In conjunction with the E-Business Suite, Oracle Contracts uses an Internet computing architecture that lets you expand markets, improve efficiencies, and retain customers.\n\nOracle Customers Online\n\nAll companies in all industries can benefit from OCO. \"Dirty\" data and duplicate records know no geographic or vertical boundaries. Any CRM implementation is only as good as the customer information that drives business decisions.\n\nThe following are some of the key features of the product:\n\nOne-Stop Customer Overview - Ability to create, view, and update customer information, such as basic profile data, contacts, relationships, notes, interactions, attachments, and moreall starting with one compact user-friendly page.\n\nCustomer Segmentation - Customer analysis by industry, slate, province, or country, using detailed reports and summary graphs.\n\nData Quality Indicators - System measures of cumulative growth in the customer database on a monthly basis.\n\nDun & Bradstreet Integration - Ability to search for companies in D&B's extensive database, create new customer records starting with D&B data, and enrich existing data with D&B data.

Now, Oracle's supply chain solution extends automation beyond your enterprise to include your global trading partners. This means you can share real-time information with your suppliers such as designs, forecasts, capacities, and deliveries, so you can flexibly and efficiently respond to dynamic market conditions. Oracle's pre-configured, role-based portals also speed collaborative communication between trading partners located across the globe.\n\nProduct Development\n\nCompanies worldwide are increasingly extending product development activities to include ever-more-global teams.

It collects actual performance data from diverse Oracle Manufacturing data sources and covers Product Margin, Production, and Materials Management.\n\nDiscrete Manufacturing\n\nIn a highly competitive environment, the ability to control manufacturing costs drives profitability. Pinpointing non-value-added activities improves resource allocation and utilization, so companies can deliver high quality products at the lowest possible cost.\n\nOracle Cost Management supports multiple costing methods (Standard, LIFO, FIFO and Average) and provides perpetual and periodic cost systems for purchasing, inventory, work in process, and order management transactions. Integration with Business Intelligence helps managers identify variances and control costs. Simulations are also supported to explore various options before finalizing decisions.\n\nOracle Quality is a flexible enterprise-wide quality management system that lets you collect data at the source, and then distribute and analyze it across your supply chain. Oracle Quality's tight integration with Oracle Manufacturing, Oracle Purchasing, Oracle iSupplier Portal, and Oracle Service, provides a closed loop process that enables you to support continuous improvement programs and ensure compliance with industry standards by tracking problems through to resolution.\n\nProcess Manufacturing\n\nOracle Process Manufacturing (OPM) allows companies to track materials, products, and data associated with process manufacturing operations, so managers can always access the latest results and history.\n\nOPM Bi-Directional Lot Genealogy\n\nMany process manufacturers have a critical need to maintain lot-related information and trace inventory composition/usage to satisfy either government regulations or company quality assurance requirements and warranties. To ensure compliance, OPM delivers bi-directional lot genealogy inquiry, reporting, and analysis capabilities, so users can trace resource usage and materials enterprise-wide from receipt through customer shipment. OPM provides intuitive user access to lot genealogy information. It also improves responsiveness to lot qualify problem and minimizes the cost of product recalls by providing instant access to consolidated lot genealogy information and comprehensive reporting documentation.\n\n21 CFR Part 11 - Audit Trail and Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures (ERES)\n\nRegulated industries (pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical devices, and food/beverages) are increasingly concerned about the Food and Drug Administrations guideline on electronic records and signatures called 21 CFR Part 11. Part 11 represents the combined effort of divisions within the FDA, along with members of the pharmaceutical industry, to establish a uniform, enforceable, baseline standard by which the FDA will consider electronic records equivalent to paper records and electronic signatures equivalent to traditional handwritten records and signatures.\n\nE-Business Suite 11i provides an extensive set of tools for managing electronic records, in accordance with the technical requirements in 21 CFR Part 11, including strong security, audit trails, archiving, operational system checks built into GxP-critical business flows. The toolset is completed in OPM Family Pack J (11i.9), with a comprehensive solution for capture of electronic signatures, and management of the resulting signed records. Signatures can be captured on-line or deferred via electronic routing with the Oracle Workflow toolset. Standard query and reporting capability are provided such that the complete historical journal of critical electronic records can be easily accessed, viewed and printed in human readable output format. The e-record is securely stored in an XML format providing advanced search capabilities, portability, conformity with FDA standards, and the ability to reconstruct the eRecord in the future, regardless of changes in technology.\n\nOPM Quality Management\n\nIn OPM Family Pack J (11i.9), OPM Quality Management introduces role-based workbenches to provide visibility and centralized access to all quality information.

Why is it a revolutionary breakthrough for Management Reporting?\n\nDaily Business Intelligence refers to the Oracle E-Business Suite capability to measure and monitor the performance of your business daily instead of monthly or quarterly like most do companies today - and at dramatically lower cost than the current solutions.\n\nAlthough some companies today get daily reports for selected areas of the business for selected users, they do so at extraordinary cost and complexity. They implement separate decision support and data warehousing systems and employ large teams of business analysts to prepare and reconcile reports. These separate systems are costly to implement but also lead to information latency, duplication, and fragmentation - making it difficult to reconcile. More business analysts then determine why the same information from different systems is not quite the same.\n\nTo dramatically lower costs and improve your information. Oracle E-Business Suite combines tranasaction management and Daily Business Intelligence reporting into a single system based on a single database.\n\nThis revolutionary breakthrough is made possible by the integration of three Oracle product lines:\n\n1. Oracle E-Business Suite 11i - Complete, integrated transaction management\n\nIn order to provide complete management information and to compare information across functional boundaries - such as ability to relate sales growth rates to turnover rates in sales groups - the transaction system must be complete so that it captures the information required to provide Daily Business Intelligence reports.\n\nOracle E-Business Suite is the first business transaction management system with nearly complete coverage across CRM. Supply Chain, Manufacturing, Projects, Product Development, Financials, and Human Resources.\n\n2. Oracle 9iAS -Embedded OLAP, Data Warehousing, and Decision Support Reporting Technologies\n\nOracle has worked over the past 5 years to embed and include advanced management reporting and presentation technologies into E-Business Suite, so that Daily Business Intelligence portal pages and web-based reports can be included.\n\n3. Oracle 9iR2 - Database Real Application Clusters (RAQ and Embedded OLAP Services\n\nOracle 9iR2 includes key features that make it possible for the first time in history to manage transactions, data summarization and transformation, and management reporting all from a single database.\n\nReal Application Clusters (RAC) allows the database to effectively use multiple computers to manage a single database providing more computing power behind a single database than ever before.\n\nMaterialize Views allow automatic summarization and transformation of transactional data into meaningful information - all in a single database and with minimal engineering and operational cost.\n\nEmbedded OLAP Services allow advanced multidimensional reporting directly from the database, without requiring separate OLAP and Decision Support systems.\n\nThe convergence and application (of these technologies makes the Daily Business Intelligence possible.\n\nHow do I purchase \"Daily Business Intelligence\"? Is it a separately priced product?\n\nNo. Oracle Daily Business Intelligence is not a separate product. It refers to management reporting capabilities that are delivered through the following Oracle Business Intelligence products:\n\nOracle's Business Intelligence products bring together all of the applications, tools, and technology required to improve decision-making across the extended enterprise and deliver Daily Business Intelligence.
