Do Not Use Database Tools to Modify Oracle Applications Data We STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you never use SQL*Plus, Oracle Data Browser, database triggers, or any other tool to modify Oracle Applications tables, unless we tell you to do so in our guides.\n\nOracle provides powerful tools you can use to create, store, change, retrieve, and maintain information in an Oracle database. But if you use Oracle tools such as SQL*Plus to modify Oracle Applications data, you risk destroying the integrity of your data and you lose the ability to audit changes to your data.\n\nBecause Oracle Applications tables are interrelated, any change you make using an Oracle Applications form can update many tables at once. But when you modify Oracle Applications data using anything other than Oracle Applications forms, you might change a row in one table without making corresponding changes in related tables. If your tables get out of synchronization with each other, you risk retrieving erroneous information and you risk unpredictable results throughout Oracle Applications.\n\nWhen you use Oracle Applications forms to modify your data, Oracle Applications automatically checks that your changes are valid. Oracle Applications also keeps track of who changes information. But, if you enter information into database tables using database tools, you may store invalid information. You also lose the ability to track who has changed your information because SQL*Plus and other database tools do not keep a record of changes.\n\nAbout Oracle Oracle Corporation develops and markets an integrated line of software products for database management, applications development, decision support and office automation, as well as Oracle Applications.

Before beginning this implementation, be sure you are familiar with the terminology Oracle uses for its business organization model.\n\nSee: Overview\n\nThese are the steps to follow when implementing the Multiple Organization support feature in Oracle Applications. Perform these steps when you are converting from a non-Multiple Organization setup to a Multiple Organization setup. If you need to add a new operating unit to an existing Multiple Organization setup, see: Adding a New Operating Unit.\n\nDevelop the Organization Structure\n\nDefine Sets of Books\n\nDefine Locations\n\nDefine Business Groups (optional)\n\nAssociate Responsibilities with Business Groups\n\nDefine Organizations\n\nDefine Organization Relationships\n\nDefine Responsibilities\n\nSet MO: Operating Unit Profile Option\n\nConvert to Multiple Organization Architecture\n\nChange Order Management Profile Option\n\nSet Profile Options Specific to Operating Units\n\nDefine Inventory Organization Security (optional)\n\nImplement the Applications Products\n\nSecure Balancing Segment Values by Legal Entity (optional)\n\nRun the Multi-Org Setup Validation Report (recommended)\n\nImplement Document Sequencing (optional)\n\nDefine Intercompany Relations (optional)\n\nSet Top Reporting Level Profile Option (optional)\n\nSet Conflict Domains (optional)\n\nImplementing Multiple Organization Support This section uses a sample hierarchy to describe how to implement Oracle Applications Multiple Organization support. Step 1 Develop the Organization Structure A successful implementation of Multiple Organization support in Oracle Applications depends primarily on defining your organizational structure in the multi-level hierarchy used by Oracle Applications. The levels are:\n\nBusiness groups\n\nAccounting sets of books\n\nLegal entities\n\nOperating units\n\nInventory organizations\n\nExample 1 illustrates the organization structure.\n\nSee Also Overview\n\nCreating Organization Hierarchies (Using Oracle HRMS -The Fundamentals)\n\nDeciding on the Organization Structure\n\nFirst, you need to decide on the organizations you will use in your multiple organization implementation. The figure below shows a corporation with two business groups, three legal entities, four operating units, and five inventory organizations. This example organization structure is used throughout most of this chapter.\n\nOrganization Structure Example\n\n[D]\n\n[D]\n\nThe business groups are U.S. and U.K. The U.S. business group consists of two legal entities  Western Division and Eastern Operations. These legal entities are assigned to the same set of books (US Operations) because they share the same functional currency, accounting flexfield structure, and calendar. The U.K. legal entity  UK Division  is assigned to a separate set of books (UK Operations) because its functional currency is different from that of the U.S. legal entities.\n\nThe US Western Division legal entity consists of two operating units  Northwest Region and Southwest Region. The Northwest Region consists of two inventory organizations  Plant1 and Plant2. The Southwest Region has one inventory organization, named Plant 3. The US Eastern Operations legal entity is also an operating unit and inventory organization.\n\nThe UK Division legal entity has one operating unit, named UK Sales Office. The operating unit has one inventory organization, named UK Plant.\n\nStep 2 Define Sets of Books Use the Define Set of Books window to enter your sets of books.\n\nThe table below explains what the set of books parameters are for our example hierarchy.\n\nSet of Books Name SOB Short Name Functional Currency Accounting Flexfield Structure Calendar U.S. Operations US_Op USD Standard Standard U.K. Operations UK_Op GBP Standard Standard\n\nTable 2 - 1 Examples of sets of books (Page 1 of 1)\n\nSee: Define Set of Books (Oracle General Ledger User Guide)\n\nStep 3 Define Locations Use the Define Location window to define names and addresses for the locations you use within your enterprise. You define each location once only. This saves you time if you have multiple organizations with the same location. You should define locations for your legal entities and inventory organizations. Oracle Applications products use locations for requisitions, receiving, shipping, billing, and employee assignments. Step 4 Define Business Groups (optional)\n\nNote: This section applies to you if you have more than one business group, or if you do not choose to use the pre-defined business group provided by Oracle Applications.\n\nOracle Applications secures human resources information, including organization definition, by business group.\n\nYou must have at least one business group. For a fresh installation, Oracle Applications provides a pre-defined business group, Setup Business Group. You can define additional business groups as required for your enterprise. We recommend that you modify the pre-defined business group rather than defining a new one. If you define a new business group instead of modifying the pre-defined business group, you need to set the Business Group profile option at the responsibility level for the new business group. Oracle Human Resources automatically creates a security profile with the business group name when you define a new business group.\n\nYou should define all your business groups before defining any other type of orgaiuzation.\n\nNote: If you plan to implement HRMS, you should consider its organization requirements when defining the organization structure. When considering multiple business groups, employee data will have to be entered and maintained for every business group using responsibilities linked to each business group. Consult your HR specialist for more information on HR organization considerations.\n\nTo define additional business groups:\n\nSet the responsibility from which you define the organizations in the profile option HR: User Type to HR User, to get access to the Define Organizations window. This profile must be set for all responsibilities that use tables from Oracle Human Resources (for example, responsibilities used to define employees and organizations).\n\nDefine all of your business groups at this step from a responsibility. Do not define any new organizations or organization hierarchies until you have associated each business group with a responsibility. You do this by setting the HR: Security Profile profile option for each responsibility.\n\nSee: Profile Options (Customizing, Reporting, and System Administration in Oracle HRMS)\n\nAfter you have correctly associated your business groups with a responsibility, sign off and sign on again using the correct responsibility for the business group you want to define. For example, if you have a U.S. business group and a U.K. business group, select the responsibility attached to the U.S. business group to define the U.S. organization structure.\n\nSee: Customizing, Reporting, and System Administration in Oracle HRMS\n\nStep 5 Associate Responsibilities with Business Groups (optional)\n\nNote: This section applies to you if you have multiple business groups, or if you do not choose to use the default business group provided by Oracle Applications.\n\nIf you have multiple business groups, you must associate each responsibility to one and only one business group. You associate a business group with a responsibility via the HR:Business Group system profile option. If you are upgrading to Multiple Organizations, you must also associate previously created responsibilities to the appropriate business group.\n\nStep 6 Define Organizations Use the Define Organization window to define all your organizations. You can perform this step and the next step (Define Organization Relationships) at the same time. The steps are presented separately to emphasize the difference between the organizational entity and the role it plays in your organizational structure. To define legal entities, operating units, and inventory organizations:\n\nLog in to the responsibility associated with the business group for which you are defining an organization.\n\nDefine a legal entity. It is then automatically attached to the correct business group.\n\nDefine operating units.\n\nDefine your inventory organizations for each operating unit that will have an inventory organization.\n\nNote: Do not define the inventory parameters at this point.\n\nIf you have more than one business group, switch to the responsibility associated with the other business group and continue to define your organization structure.\n\nThe following table summarizes information about the different organizations for our example hierarchy.\n\nOrganization Name Legal Entity? Oper. Unit Inv. Org? Western Division Yes Yes Yes Eastern Operations Yes Yes Yes U.K. Division Yes Northwest Region Yes Southwest Region Yes U.K. Sales Offifce Yes Plant 1 Yes Plant 2 Yes Plant 3 Yes U.K. Plant Yes\n\nTable 2 - 2 Organizations (Page 1 of 1)\n\nSee: Define Organization (Oracle Inventory User's Guide)\n\nStep 7 Define Organization Relationships Use the Define Organization window to define organization relationships by assigning classifications to each organization. Attributes of certain classifications relate organizations and the roles they play. You can classify an organization as any combination of legal entity, operating unit, and inventory organization. Specify your organization classifications in the following order:\n\nLegal Entities\n\nAttach organizations designated as legal entities to a set of books. You must also specify a location in the Define Organization window. Use the Define Location window to define locations for your legal entities.\n\nOperating units\n\nAttach the operating units to the correct set of books and legal entity.\n\nInventory organizations\n\nAttach the inventory organizations to the correct operating unit, legal entity, and set of books.\n\nIf you have more than one business group, change to the responsibility associated with the other business group and continue defining your organization classification.\n\nTable 2-3 shows the information you must enter for each organization classification.\n\nClassification Information Type Required Attributes Business Group Business group information if Human Resources is installed. Otherwise, None. Short Name, Employee/Applicant Numbering, Key Flexfield Structures, Default Legislation Code, and Currency GRE/Legal Entity Legal Entity Accounting Set of Books, Location Operating Unit Operating Unit Information Legal Entity, Set of Books Inventory Organization Accounting Information Set of Books, Legal Entity, Operating Unit\n\nTable 2 - 3 Required information for organization classifications (Page 1 of 1)\n\nSpecial Considerations for Inventory Organizations\n\nAll the inventory organizations in the above chart have been set up with the minimal amount of information to enable them in the Multiple Organization environment. This minimal amount is detailed in the table below.\n\nIf you plan to implement Oracle Inventory, you need to follow the setup procedures for that product.\n\nSee: Oracle Inventory User's Guide\n\nFor a standalone Oracle Purchasing installation (without Oracle Inventoty), you must specify the minimum information shown in the following table:\n\nSequence Additional Organization Information Required Information 1 Accounting information Set of books, legal entity, operating unit 2 Receiving information Three-character organization code, prefix serial (no dummy) 3 Inventory information All required accounts\n\nTable 2 - 4 (Page l of l)\n\nLocation: You must specify a location for an organization classified as an inventory organization. You can assign any locations that is not assigned to a different inventory organization, or you can assign a location that is linked to the current inventory organization.\n\nReceiving Information: When you select the Receiving Information type, you navigate to the Receiving Options window. Use the Receiving Options window to define options that govern receipts in your system. You cannot receive items into an inventory organization until you specify receiving options for the organization.\n\nInventory Information: When you select the Inventory Information type, you navigate to the Organization Parameter window. You must define the control options and account defaults for one inventory organization, the item master organization. Then you can easily assign items to other inventory organization without recreating all the item information. Use the Organization Parameter window to assign inventory organizations to the item master. The item master organization uses itself as the item master.\n\nThere is no functional or technical difference between the item master organization and other inventory organizations. However, we recommend that you limit the item master to just an item definition organization. If you set up new inventory organizations in the future, you can assign the new items to only the item master and the new inventory organization.\n\nStep 8 Define Responsibilities Use the Define Responsibility window to define responsibilities for each operating unit by application. When you sign on to Oracle Applications, the responsibility you choose determines the data, forms, menus, reports, and concurrent programs you can access.\n\nYou should consider using naming conventions for the responsibility names id a Multiple Organization environment. It is a good idea to use abbreviations of the business function and the organization name to uniquely identify the purpose of the responsibility, for example, Payables Manager Northwest or Western Receivables Super User.\n\nSee: Define Responsibility (Oracle Applications System Administrator's Guide)\n\nStep 9 Set MO: Operating Unit Profile Option Oracle Applications uses the profile option MO: Operating Unit to link an operating unit to a responsibility. You must set this profile option for each responsibility.\n\nWhen you connect to the Oracle Applications, you sign on by entering your username and password. Then, you choose a responsibility that is available to your user. After you choose your responsibility, there is an initialization routine that reads the values for all profile options assigned to that responsibility, including the value for MO: Operating Unit. Oracle Applications allows you to see only the information for that particular operating unit that is assigned to your responsibility.\n\nYou must also define the default operating unit by setting the MO: Operatiitig Unit profile option at the site level. If this is a fresh installation, the default operating unit can be any operating unit you have defined. If this is an existing installation, you should assign as the default operating unit the operating unit to which all existing data should belong.\n\nIf you use Oracle General Ledger with automatic tax calculation enabled in a Multiple Organization environment, you must set the MO: Operating Unit profile option. Since General Ledger shares input and output tax codes with Oracle Payables and Oracle Receivables, you can use only tax codes that belong to your current responsibility's corresponding operating unit.\n\nHowever, General Ledger's Account Inquiry window ignores the operating unit profile setting. This allows you to drill down to your subledger details, regardless of which operating unit originated the transaction.\n\nIf you use Oracle Training Administration (OTA) in a Multiple Organization environment, you must set the MO: Operating Unit profile option. This ensures that the OTA customer and supplier function woifks correctly in a Multiple Organization environment.\n\nStep 10 Convert to Multiple Organization Architecture Ask your database administrator to run the Ad Administration utility (adadmin). One of the options in adadmin is to convert to Multiple Organization architecture. Choosing this option will enable the Multiple Organization Support feature as well as add operating unit context to all existing data. This process will also replicate seed data to all operating units that have been defined.\n\nBefore running this step, you must define an operating unit and set the site-level AOL profile option MO: Operating Unit to use your new operating unit. This profile option tells adadmin what operating unit it should use when converting your existing data. If you define additional operating units, the seed data will be replicated for all operating units.\n\nThe Convert to Multiple Organization Architecture option does not display on the menu if you already have Multiple Organizations installed in your database. You no longer need to run the Convert to Multiple Organizations Architecture option again since the Multiple Organizations architecture is built into the underlying applications.\n\nSee: Maintaining Oracle Applications Manual\n\nStep 11 Verify Order Management System Parameter Settings If you have different item validation organizations for each operating unit, verify the correct setting for each operating unit in the Order Management system parameter window.\n\nSee: Enabling Parameters (Oracle Order Management User's Guide)\n\nStep 12 Set Profile Options Specific to Operating Units Some profile options, including AR: Receipt Batch Source and AR: Transaction Hatch Source, reference data that is secured by operating unit. You must set these profile options at the responsibility level. You should choost a value corresponding to the operating unit of the responsibility.\n\nThe following profile options need to be set for each responsibility for each operating unit where applicable:\n\nHR: Business Group (all responsibilities)\n\nHR: User Type\n\nThe HR: User Type profile option limits field access on windows shared between Oracle Human Resources and other applications. If you do not use Oracle Payroll, it must be to HR User for all responsibilities that use tables from Oracle Human Resources (for example, responsibilities used to define employees and organizations).\n\nGL: Set of Books Name\n\nOracle General Ledger forms use the GL:Set of Books profile option to determine your current set of books. If you have different sets of books for your operating units, you should set the GL:Set of Books profile option for each responsibility that uses Oracle General Ledger forms.\n\nINV: Intercompany Currency Conversion\n\nTax: Allow Override of Tax Code\n\nTax: Invoice Freight as Revenue\n\nTax: Inventory Item for Freight\n\nSequential Numbering\n\nStep 13 Define Inventory Organization Security (optional) With inventory organization security you can restrict inventory organization access to specific responsibilities. You may want to restrict your manufacturing users to certain organizations according to your organizational hierarchy. This feature has the following characteristics:\n\nUntil you assign an organization to a responsibility in this window, all responsibilities have access to all organizations. Once you have restricted any responsibilities to certain organizations, you must then explicitly define the organizations that all responsibilities can access.\n\nThis feature does not restrict access once the user is in the product. Users with access to functions that cross multiple organizations (such as ATP, Inter-Organization Transfers, Item Search, Multi-Org Quantity Report, and so forth) can still specify any valid organization when running these functions.\n\nStep 14 Implement the Applications Products After the steps above are complete, go into each operating unit and set up the Oracle Applications products. The following products must be set up for each operating unit in which you intend to perform the functions:\n\nOracle Cash Management\n\nOracle Order Management and Shipping Execution\n\nOracle Payables\n\nOracle Projects\n\nOracle Purchasing\n\nOracle Property Manager\n\nOracle Receivables\n\nOracle Release Accounting\n\nOracle Sales Compensation\n\nOracle Sales and Marketing\n\nOracle Service\n\nEuropean Localizations\n\nLatin America Localizations\n\nRegional Localizations\n\nOracle Assets Oracle General Ledger, Oracle Inventory, and the rest of the Oracle Manufacturing products need to be set up only once for the installation, not once for each operating unit. To perform these setup procedures, follow the instructions in the product user guides.\n\nInformation Shared Across Organizations The following information is global, meaning it needs to by set up only once for the enterprise:\n\nFlexfield definitions\n\nCustomer Header (customer site is at the operating unit level)\n\nSupplier Header (supplier site is at the operating unit level)\n\nAll other information that is not listed below\n\nInformation Specific to Each Operating Unit The following setup data is stripped, meaning it must be set up for each operating unit:\n\nCash Management\n\nSystem parameters\n\nBank accounts\n\nBank transaction codes\n\nBank Statement open interface\n\nReconciliation open interface\n\nForecasting open interface\n\nCash forecasting templates\n\nOrder Management\n\nHold sources\n\nOrder types\n\nHolds\n\nPayables\n\nSupplier sites\n\nMatching tolerances\n\nDistribution sets\n\nBank accounts\n\nTax names and groups\n\nReporting entities\n\nFinancial options\n\nExpense report templates\n\nSystem options\n\nProjects\n\nImplementation options\n\nExpenditure types\n\nNon-labor resources\n\nUsage cost rate overrides\n\nExpenditure type cost rates\n\nEmployee rates\n\nBurden schedules\n\nBill rate schedules\n\nResource list\n\nProject types\n\nProject templates\n\nAutoAccounting\n\nPurchasing\n\nSupplier sites\n\nFinancial options\n\nControl rules/groups\n\nPurchasing options\n\nJob/position controls\n\nFreight carriers\n\nDocument controls\n\nReceivables\n\nAutoAccounting\n\nContact phones\n\nCustomer address\n\nCustomer relationships\n\nCustomer bank accounts\n\nCustomer call information (call records, topics)\n\nDistribution sets\n\nTransaction sources\n\nLockbox definitions\n\nMemo lines\n\nReceipt sources\n\nReceivables activities\n\nRemit to address\n\nRemittance bank accounts\n\nSalesperson, sales territories assigned to salespersons\n\nSystem options\n\nTax exemptions and exceptions\n\nTax codes\n\nTax rates\n\nTax names and groups\n\nTransaction types\n\nVAT taxes\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nTerritories\n\nTerritory types\n\nTerritory groups\n\nTerritory qualifiers\n\nTerritory Accesses\n\nInterest types\n\nInterest codes\n\nInterest category sets\n\nPromotion word processors\n\nCollateral categories\n\nSales stages\n\nServices\n\nService parameters\n\nAccess control templates\n\nFor more information, see the Setup chapter for your product.\n\nStep 15 Secure Balancing Segment Values by Legal Entity (optional) Use the Define Security Rule window to create rules that secure data entry of balancing segment values for each legal entity. Each security rule is composed of one or more security rule elements that specify a range of values to include or exclude.\n\nOrganization Structure with Balancing Entities Example\n\n[D] The following table summarizes the information needed to define security rules for the Division value set of our example hierarchy.\n\nValue Set Security Rule Type Element Low Element High Element Division US Western Include 01 01 Division US Western Include 04 04 Division US Eastern Include 02 02 Division UK Include 03 03\n\nTable 2 - 5 Security Rules for the Division Value Set (Page 1 of 1)\n\nUse the Assign Security Rules window to assign the same rule(s) to all responsibilities associated with the legal entity's operating units. The following table lists the responsibilities, value sets, and security rules for our example hierarchy.\n\nResponsibilities Value Set Security Rule All responsibilities for Northwest Region and Southwest Region operating units Division U.S. Western All responsibilities for Eastern Operations operating unit Division U.S. Eastern All responsibilities for UK Sales Office operating unit Division U.K.\n\nTable 2 - 6 Security Rules Assigned to Operating Units (Page 1 of 1)\n\nIf you need to further secure balancing segment values for each operating unit of a legal entity, you can define additional rules and assign them to all responsibilities associated with the relevant operating units. If, for example, you need to restrict the Northwest Region operating unit to balancing segment value 01 and the Southwest Region to balancing segment value 04, you can add the rules described in the following table.\n\nValue Set Security Rule Type Element Low Element High Element Division Northwest Include 01 01 Division Southwest Include 04 04\n\nTable 2 - 7 Security Rules for Operating Units (Page 1 of 1)\n\nIn addition to the previous rule assignments, you can assign the new rules to all responsibilities associated with the two operating units, as illustrated in the table below. When you assign multiple rules to the same responsibility, only the overlapping values of the rules are available to users of the responsibility.\n\nResponsibilities Value Set Security Rule All responsibilities for Northwest Region operating unit Division Northwest All responsibilities for Southwest Region operating unit Division Southwest\n\nTable 2 - 8 Security Rules Assigned to Operating Units (Page 1 of 1) Step 16 Run the Multi-Org Setup Validation Report (recommended) After you have implemented Multiple Organizations, run the Setup Validation Report to identify any setup problems. Some of the errors that the report finds may be deleted optionally by running this report, while others require that you change your setup. All suggested changes can be confirmed optionally so that you may retain your implementation even if it fails validation.\n\nSee: Multi-Org Setup Validation Report\n\nStep 17 Implement Document Sequencing (Optional) After you have implemented Multiple Organizations and run the Multi-Org Setup Validation Report, you have the option to set up document sequencing (a common requirement for European countries) for each application that supports document sequencing. Sequence assignments are controlled at the set of books level.\n\nSee: Document Sequences (Oracle Applications System Administrator's Guide)\n\nStep 18 Define Intercompany Relations (Optional) This step is only necessary when using the Multiple Organization Intercompany Invoicing functionality. Intercompany relations need to be defined for each Selling/Shipping relationship in your organization. Defining these relationships will allow for the production of automatic intercompany invoices. To enable this the following steps must be completed:\n\nDefine Customers\n\nDefine Suppliers\n\nDefine Transaction Type\n\nDefine Intercompany Relations\n\nDefine Oracle Receivables System Options\n\nDefine Oracle Receivables Invoice Batch Source\n\nDefine Oracle Receivables Invoice Profile Options\n\nDefine Oracle Payables Invoice Profile Options\n\nUse the Account Generator to generate the Cost of Goods Sold account\n\nSee Also Intercompany Invoicing\n\nUsing the Account Generator to Generate Intercompany COGS Accounts\n\nStep 19 Set Top Reporting Level Profile Option (optional) You need to define your reporting levels by setting the MO: Top Reporting Level profile option. To do this, you set you top reporting level to one of the following:\n\nSet of Books\n\nLegal Entity\n\nOperating Unit\n\nYou will foe able to report on anything that is within the reporting level. The default value is Operating Unit.\n\nSee: Multiple Organization Reporting\n\nStep 20 Set Up Conflict Domains (optional) A conflict domain is an abstract representation of the groupings used to partition your data. When a program is listed as incompatible with another, the two programs cannot run simultaneously in the same conflict domain. Two incompatible concurrent programs may run simultaneously if they are submitted in different conflict domains. To maximize the concurrency in a multiple organization environment, you can set up conflict domains for your operating units.\n\nAll programs are assigned a conflict domain when they are submitted. The following determines the conflicts domain you use when you submit a concurrent request:\n\nThe value of the concurrent program parameter which is defined as Conflict Domain parameter\n\nThe value of the Concurrent: Conflicts Domain profile option\n\nIf you do not define any conflict domain, the Standard conflict domain is used.\n\nTo define a profile option conflict domain:\n\nDefine Concurrent Conflict Domains\n\nAny alphanumeric string can be used as a Conflicts Domain name. You can use an operating unit name, a legal entity name, or a set of books name as the domain name. You are allowed to define as many as domains as you need. Since you cannot delete conflicts domains, you should keep the domains to a necessary minimum.\n\nSet the Concurrent: Conflicts Domain profile option\n\nThe profile can be set at Site, Application, Responsibility and User levels.\n\nTo define a concurrent program parameter as the conflicts domain parameter:\n\nNavigate to the Concurrent Program window. Query up the program you want to define conflict domain.\n\nClick on the Parameters. Use the Concurrent Program Parameter window to define the conflict domain parameter. You can choose one of the concurrent program parameters as the conflict domain parameter.\n\nChanging the Organization Structure At some point, your company may need to make organization changes. Companies usually make organization changes to better adapt themselves to the new business needs and challenges of the market.\n\nOne type of organization change you can make is to discontinue one organization. You can use the Define Organizations window to discontinue one organization by putting an end date in its definition.\n\nYou can perform other organization changes by enabling or disabling organization classifications, or changing the classification attributes. When you do that, you must consider the following:\n\nThe Define Organizations window does not re-validate the relationships among legal entities, operating units, and inventory organizations.\n\nYou should not try to move one set of books or legal entity to another because your data may not be valid for the new set of books or legal entity. Instead, you should disable the old organization and create a new one for the appropriate set of books or legal entity. The new organization will contain your new data, and the disabled organization will act as an old or history entity that stores past transactions.\n\nIf you create a new organization, you can still access your historical transactions by logging to the responsibility tied to the disabled organization. To enter new transactions, you must log into the responsibility tied to the new organization. The data for each of the two organizations are kept separate from one another, and must be accessed separately.\n\nAdding a New Operating Unit The following steps are required to add new operating units to your organizational structure:\n\nRevise the Organization Structure. See: Develop the Organization Structute.\n\nDefine Sets of Books (optional). See: Define Sets of Books.\n\nDefine Locations. See: Define Locations.\n\nDefine Organizations. See: Define Organizations.\n\nDefine Relationships. See: Define Organization Relationships.\n\nDefine Responsibilities. See: Define Responsibilities.\n\nSet Profile Options for Each Responsibility linked to the new Operating Unit. See: Set MO: Operating Unit Profile Option.\n\nRun the Replicate Seed Data concurrent program. See: Seed Data Replication.\n\nSet profile options specific to operating units. See: Set Profile Options Specific to Operating Units.\n\nDefine Inventory Organization Security (optional). See: Define Inventory Organization Security.\n\nImplement the Application Products. See: Implement the Application Products.\n\nSecure balancing Segment Values (optional). See: Secure Balancing Segment Values by Legal Entity.\n\nRun the Setup Validation Report (recommended). See: Run the Multi-Org Setup Validation Report.\n\nImplement Document Sequencing (optional). See: Implement Document Sequencing.\n\nDefine Intercompany Relations (optional). See: Define Intercompany Relations.\n\nSet the top reporting level (optional). See: :Set Top Reporting Level Profile Option.\n\nSet up conflict domains (optional). See: :Set Up Conflict Domains.\n\nMulti-Org Setup Validation Report Use the Multi-Org Setup Validation Report to identify problems in your Multiple Organization setup. If you detect setup problems, you can use the report to help you correct them.\n\nTo submit the Multi-Org Setup Validation Report, use the Submit Request window in the System Administrator responsibility.\n\nReport Parameters You must enter a value for each of the following parameters:\n\nActive Responsibility Only: Enter Yes or No to indicate whether you want to validate only the active responsibilities on the report. The default Value is Yes.\n\nCorrect Customer Attributes: Enter Yes or No to indicate whether you want to correct the customer attributes. If you choose Yes, the report deletes the operating unit-specific data from the Customer records. The default value is No.\n\nCorrect Supplier Attributes: Enter Yes or No to indicate whether you want to correct the supplier attributes. If you choose Yes, the report deletes ihe operating unit-specific data from the supplier records. The default value is no.\n\nReport Sections The report consists of the following sections:\n\nActive Responsibilities\n\nCustomers with Operating Unit Specific Attributes\n\nSuppliers with Operating Unit Specific Attributes\n\nProfile Option Errors and Warnings\n\nActive Responsibilities Only The report prints the value of the Active Responsibility Only parameter you specified in the first page of the report. Customers with Operating Unit Specific Attributes This section of the report indicates that you have data defined at the customer level that is allowed only at the customer site level. This generally occurs when you convert to Multiple Organization support from a non-Multiple Organization implementation. The report indicates if any data has been entered at the customer level in the following fields by printing an asterisk (*) in the column for a particular customer:\n\nSalesperson (report data appears under the Primary Salesrep column)\n\nOrder Type\n\nDunning Site\n\nStatement Site\n\nTax Code\n\nCarrier (report data appears under the Ship Via column)\n\nThe report warns you that this data exists in the database. If you choose Yes for the Correct Customer Attributes report parameter, the report deletes the operating unit-specific data from the customer records.\n\nSuppliers with Operating Unit Specific Attributes This section of the report indicates that you have data defined at the supplier level that is allowed only at the supplier site level. This generally occurs when you convert to Multiple Organization support from a non-Multiple Organization implementation. The report indicates if any data has been entered at the supplier level in the following fields by printing an asterisk (*) in the column for a particular supplier:\n\nLiability Account\n\nPrepaytnent Account\n\nDistribution Set\n\nStatement Site\n\nInvoice Tax Name\n\nOffset Tax Name\n\nThe report warns you that this data exists in the database. If you choose Yes for the Correct Supplier Attributes report parameter, the report deletes the operating unit specific data from the customer records.\n\nProfile Option Errors and Warnings This section provides information on profile options that may be invalid. All profile option values in question are listed for your review. You need to correct the profile options manually. The report may list any combination of the following violations:\n\nNot all Responsibilities in current operating unit have the same option Value\n\nAll responsibilities in one operating unit must share the same values for the following profile options:\n\nHR: Business Group\n\nTax: Allow Override of Tax Code\n\nTax: Invoice Freight as Revenue\n\nTax: Inventory Item for Freight\n\nThe Validation Report indicates a violation for the operating units with inconsistent profile option values and lists the values, which are set at the responsibility level, or are defaulted from the site or application level.\n\nOption is not set to correct value\n\nThe INV: Intercompany Currency Conversion profile option must be the same for the responsibilities involved in intercompany transactions. The system predefines a value of Corporate for this profile at the site level. The Multi-Org Setup Validation Report indicates a violation for the operating units if the value is overridden at the site or application levels.\n\nSequential Numbering option differs among responsibilities\n\nAll responsibilities in one operating unit must share the same sequence numbering option. The Multi-Org Setup Validation Report indicates a violation for the operating units with inconsistent profile option values and lists the values, which are set at the responsibility level, or which are defaulted from the site or application level."
