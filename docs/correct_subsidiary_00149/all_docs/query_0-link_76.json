        "text": "Oracle Asia Pacific, a division of Oracle Corporation - the world's largest enterprise software company has announced significant customer wins during the second quarter of its FY06.\n\nBusinesses across Asia continue to choose Oracle software and services over competitive offerings to integrate their business systems and reduce total cost of ownership, to gain business insight, agility and competitiveness.\n\nOracle Asia Pacific reported total revenues of US $469 million for Q2FY06 (ended November 30, 2005), a 17% increase from Q2FY05. The Asia Pacific region accounted for about 14% of world-wide total revenues.\n\nIn Q2FY06, Asia Pacific's applications new license revenues grew 48% while database and middleware revenues grew 9%, compared with Q2FY05. Total new license revenues for Asia Pacific contributed 19% of world-wide Q2FY06 new license revenues. (All figures above are in USD and on GAAP basis.)\n\n\"Customers in Asia Pacific continue to endorse Oracle's commitment to offer innovative, open-standards software that deliver better quality information at lower total cost of ownership,\" said Derek Williams, Executive Vice President, Oracle Asia Pacific.\n\n\"Companies across key verticals and markets are choosing Oracle for their business and IT infrastructure because our product strategy is in line with what they need to be competitive: quantifiable returns, less complexity, greater performance, reliability and security, at lower costs.\"\n\nLooking ahead to 2006, growth drivers for Oracle in Asia Pacific include leveraging its Technology leadership, unique opportunities in the Applications market and high-growth industries, and the fast-growing small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) market segment.\n\nOracle's market leadership and innovation in technology will continue to fuel momentum in Asia Pacific. Real-time data that delivers true business intelligence enables Asia Pacific companies to make faster, smarter decisions. Oracle's robust enterprise database software, integrated middleware solutions and world-wide support infrastructure delivers a more complete and versatile data management solution. Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle's comprehensive platform for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), will drive significant contribution to revenues.\n\nIn particular, many customers are investing in the key components of Identity and Access Management and using them as the first step in the foundation for a SOA approach. The strength of Oracle's technology gives customers an unprecedented ability to build identity into their software infrastructure. Oracle's unrivalled security offering clearly positions Oracle as a leader in this space and is helping to win new customers in the region who want the leading identity management solution for their businesses.\n\nOracle continues to build momentum in its enterprise applications business, with significant traction in high-growth industries across Asia Pacific.\n\nAs Oracle rolls out its regional sales strategy incorporating recent acquisitions, such as Retek, ProfitLogic, G-Log, companies in Asia Pacific have the widest choice of fully integrated applications with deep industry functionality that are built on open standards.\n\nOracle is uniquely able to develop and integrate its Applications, Middleware and Database components, to build more effective suites of software that meet the diverse needs of customers in different industries. Customers gain significant business advantage through increased agility and flexibility to manage and gain intelligence in key business processes and functional areas.\n\nAnother key growth segment for Oracle is the small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) market. The SME segment - defined as comprising companies that have less than US $500 million in annual revenues - contributes more than 50% of Oracle Asia Pacific revenues today.\n\nOracle offers the most comprehensive technology and applications software portfolio today to address the needs of small and mid-market businesses. Oracle's 1,550-strong partner network extends its market reach and offers a full suite of implementation services in Asia Pacific to drive uptake in this segment.\n\nOracle continues to contribute to community and education initiatives as well as volunteer programs that support meaningful advances in technology, science, and quality of life for individuals and their communities.\n\nIn addition to Oracle software donations totalling more than $549million in-kind, Oracle has rolled out initiatives around its five major education programs: Think.com, ThinkQuest, Oracle Academy, Oracle Academic Initiative and Workforce Development Program.-PR\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2006"
