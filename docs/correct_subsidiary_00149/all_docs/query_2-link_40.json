If it is not specified, the default time zone for conversions, UI, integration, and logging is based on the locale of the application server.\n\nThis and the glog.timeZone.calculate properties are set for a specific reason. For Europe/London, you need to select a time zone for conversions that avoids the JDK DST bugs. If you are in Europe/London you will still want to see your default output time zone as Europe/London. A typical setting would be:\n\nglog.timeZone.calculated=UTC\n\nglog.timeZone.display=Europe/London\n\nNote: This property does not display in the properties servlet by default. It must be added manually."
