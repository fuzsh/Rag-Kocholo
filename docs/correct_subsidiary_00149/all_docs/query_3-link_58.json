        "text": "The Entries per Page represents the number of lines retrieved for each screen page of the system log viewer. It is limited to 1000 entries per page. When saving to file, the screen page size is not applicable. Instead, the server can retrieve a larger set of entries, restricted only by RMI size limits. This download page size limit is specified by this property, which defaults to 5000.\n\nThis property is used by the notification subsystem to determine how to handle non-fatal errors (e.g. a missing contact e-mail address). Valid values are:\n\nIgnore: ignore errors\n\nLog: log a single line for each error\n\nTrace: log a stack trace for each error\n\nThrow: throw an exception for any error out to the caller\n\nWhen searching logs by date, the system performs a binary search on each log file. This parameter controls how deep the search can go before it will fail. Default = 100. This means we can search a file with 2^100 (i.e. 10^30 lines)."
