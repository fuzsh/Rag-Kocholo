        "text": "Property\n\nNew in Version\n\nDefinition\n\nglog.webserver.apiadapt.tenderresp.refnum2qual\n\n5.5 CU4\n\nIn the tender response results screen there are Shipment Reference Number 2 and Shipment Reference Number Qualifier 2. These are in addition to existing shipment reference number and qualifier columns.\n\nShipment Reference Number Qualifier 2 is read from this property. If there is a value for the qualifier (specified here), it is shown in the Shipment Reference Number 2 column, otherwise the column is blank. In case you need to show value of a specific qualifier, the property needs to be updated with the qualifier.\n\nDefault: GLOG\n\nglog.webserver.appointment.showEndTimeColumn\n\n6.4.2\n\nSet this property to False to hide the end time details in the Appointment Options section.\n\nDefault: True\n\nglog.webserver.branding.showLoginOptions\n\n20A\n\nControls if the Login Logo variable option appears on the Theme Management screen. Set to False by default which hides the variable. Set to true to display the variable.\n\nglog.webserver.businessMonitor.autoRefresh\n\nÂ\n\nIf this property is true, the Business Monitor page automatically refreshes at the specified interval. If false, Oracle Transportation Management will not auto refresh and does not show the label \"Next Refresh Time\" in the monitor window. (This serves as an indicator to the user that the user has to refresh manually.) To set the actual refresh interval, enter a value in the Refresh Interval field when creating or editing the business monitor.\n\nValues: true and false\n\nglog.webserver.changeEG.ChangeEquipmentGroupRecalcFlag\n\n22A\n\nThis property reflects Recalculate and Recalculate without Service Provider Change check box status when you perform the Change Equipment Group action:\n\nIf the property is set to 'On' then the Recalculate check box is selected.\n\nIf the property is set to 'OnWithoutSPChange' then both the Recalculate and Recalculate without Service Provider Change check boxes are Â selected.\n\nDefault: Off\n\nglog.webserver.clientSession.maxActive\n\n6.3.2\n\nThe number of client sessions available for use per user session. This replaces the glog.webserver.max_sessions property. Default: 20.\n\nglog.webserver.clientSession.method\n\n6.3.2\n\nControls which client session management method to use. Changes to this property using the WebServerProperties servlet are not visible. This can only be changed via the property files. Values: queue, timeout. Default: queue.\n\nglog.webserver.clientSession.pinServlet\n\n6.3.2\n\nName of the servlet that pins the client session. The servlet must be the one that created the client session. This property is a multiple entry property so it can exist more than once.\n\nglog.webserver.clientSession.releaseMaxInactiveInterval\n\n6.3.2\n\nOnce marked for release, maximum time interval, in minutes, between requests before the client session is removed. A value of 0 turns off this feature. Default: 0.\n\nglog.webserver.clientSession.schedulerThreadCount\n\n6.3.2\n\nNumber of threads that handle the scheduled inactive client session tasks and released unused tasks. If set to 0 then schedulers are not used; timeouts and releases are handled by the client session filter during preprocessing. This can only be changed via the property files. Default: 0.\n\nglog.webserver.clientSession.timeout.maxInactiveInterval\n\n6.3.2\n\nTimeout (in minutes) that a client session can remain inactive before it is removed from the user's session. This value can not exceed the timeout value set in the instance's web.xml file. Default: 15.\n\nNote: The user's session will not time out in the following situations:\n\nIf the message center refresh is set.\n\nIf you leave the business monitor open and it is set to auto refresh.\n\nglog.webserver.cors.origins\n\n6.4.2\n\nThis defines the valid origin domains that are accepted by the server. If you have multiple valid origin domains, use a comma (,) to separate them. For example, glog.webserver.cors.origins = http://localhost:8080,https://localhost:8080.\n\nglog.webserver.debug.enable\n\n6.4.1\n\nThe glog.webserver.debug.enable property allows the XML behind the screens to be debugged by displaying and logging it if the UIDiag LogId is enabled. This XML contains all of the field values and additional information.\n\nglog.webserver.deleteShipments.publishPrePersistTopic\n\n18C\n\nSet this property to true to have OTM publish a before persist ShipmentModRemoved topic when a shipment is manually deleted using the Delete icon on the user interface. This allows you to add a before persist automation agent that is listening for a ShipmentModRemoved before persist event.\n\nDefault is false.\n\nglog.webserver.digitalAssistant.authorizeUrl\n\n21A\n\nSet to the authorization URL in IDCS when configuring the Digital Assistant for OAuth.\n\nglog.webserver.digitalAssistant.channelId\n\n20C\n\nID of the channel to use. This comes from the Digital Assistant platform.\n\nglog.webserver.digitalAssistant.embedInHeaderÂ\n\n23A\n\nSet to true to add an icon to the Global Header. When you click this icon, the digital assistant will launch within the application.\n\nDefault: false\n\nglog.webserver.digitalAssistant.url\n\n20C\n\nURL of the digital assistant platform.\n\nglog.webserver.finder.adf_page_size\n\n6.4\n\nControls the number of records that are displayed after a search and the number of additional records that are displayed when you click the More link. This is defined according to the following hierarchy:\n\nThe Finder Page Size user preference.\n\nThe glog.webserver.finder.adf_page_size property.\n\nA default of 25.\n\nIf this property is not defined, the default of 25 is used.\n\nDefault: 25\n\nglog.webserver.finder.export.include_uom\n\nÂ\n\nThe export code looks for a property to decide whether or not to add a column for the UOM type. By adding the following property it will add a column to the spread sheet for the Currency type:\n\nglog.webserver.finder.export.include_uom=Currency\n\nYou can add the weight type by adding the following property:\n\nglog.webserver.finder.export.include_uom=Weight\n\nglog.webserver.finder.export_limit\n\n5.5\n\nThis property sets a limit on the number of records being exported. Exporting large data can cause instability and performance issues.\n\nDefault: 1000\n\nIt is not recommended to use the user interface to export large amounts of data (for example, any more than 1000 records). Either limit the export to smaller data sets and then combine them manually, or if you need to export larger volumes than this, use CSV export.\n\nThis limit can override the glog.webserver.finder.export_limit property for exporting data. For example, if this property is set to 5000 and the glog.webserver.finder.limit is set to 1000, the finder will return 1000 records, but will export 5000.\n\nglog.webserver.finder.invalidOperators.finder_set_gid.<finder_set_gid>\n\nglog.webserver.finder.invalidOperators.query_name.<query_name>\n\n20A\n\nYou can set properties to remove some search operations for Text Field fields and Pick List fields in certain finder pages. This setting does NOT work for \"derived\" fields, whose operators have already been restricted. For example, for the Driver > Calculated tab, the field \"Next Assignment Source Location ID\" only has \"Same As\" option. So such field will NOT be affected by the properties settings.\n\nThe properties could be for the whole query or for specific finder set, and values are separated by \",\". The property format is:\n\nglog.webserver.finder.invalidOperators.query_name.<query_name> = <forbidden_operator1>,<forbidden_operator2>.\n\nThis property means all finder pages with the query_name will remove <forbidden_operator1> and <forbidden_operator2> from the Text Field field and Pick List fields.\n\nglog.webserver.finder.invalidOperators.finder_set_gid.<finder_set_gid> = <forbidden_operator2>\n\nThis property means the finder page with the finder_set_gid will remove <forbidden_operator1> from the Text Field field and Pick List fields.\n\nThe properties of query_name and finder_set_gid can have overlap, that does not matter.\n\nFor example: glog.webserver.finder.invalidOperators.query_name.glog.server.query.shipment.BuyShipmentQuery = contains, same glog.webserver.finder.invalidOperators.finder_set_gid.BUY_SHIPMENT= notoneof.\n\nValid values:\n\nisnull\n\nbegin\n\nend\n\nnotnull\n\noneof\n\nnotoneof\n\ncontains\n\nsame\n\nnotsame\n\nnotsameincludenull\n\nglog.webserver.finder.limit\n\nÂ\n\nControls the maximum number of records returned by a query on a finder page and workbench table. Note that this setting impacts the performance workbench layouts, this varies depending on the data returned in the workbench table (for example including pseudo and/or derived fields in the results) and the general structure of the workbench layout.\n\nDefault: 1000\n\nNote: This limit can be overridden for exporting data by the glog.webserver.finder.export_limit property.\n\nglog.webserver.finder.page_size\n\nÂ\n\nControls the number of records that are displayed after a search and the number of additional records that are displayed when you click the More link on a refreshed finder. This is defined according to the following hierarchy:\n\nThe Finder Page Size user preference.\n\nThe glog.webserver.finder.page_size property.\n\nA default of 25.\n\nIf this property is not defined, the default of 25 is used.\n\nDefault: 25\n\nglog.webserver.finder.results.configurable\n\nÂ\n\nThis property enables finder results to be configurable so you can select which columns to display, and in what order, from a list of available columns. You can configure the columns by right-clicking on the column header and then selecting which columns to display. The options are TRUE and FALSE. The default value is TRUE meaning you are able to configure the results. In addition to this property being set to TRUE, you must have write access for the domain.\n\nSet this to false to prevent users from changing the results screen.\n\nTo set this to false, you must first add the property.\n\nglog.webserver.finderresults.concatPseudoField\n\n19\n\nBy default pseudo fields on a search results page that have the same values such as reference numbers with identical reference number qualifiers are shown in the finder results page as a comma separated string. Set this property to false if you are not using customer-defined finder results to avoid performance issues.\n\nNote: The Status column is not affected by this property.\n\nglog.webserver.finderresults.showquerycount\n\nÂ\n\nIf there are more records then your default record limit query is set to, Oracle Transportation Management shows the total amount of records. For instance, Total Found: 1000/2500. The valid options are True and False. Set to true (all lower case) to display the count.\n\nThis only shows the actual total for Saved Queries where the Use in Finder check box is selected. See Saved Queries and Search Results.\n\nglog.webserver.finderresults.showquerycount.ignoreDerivedData\n\n6.3.2\n\nWhen both this property and the glog.webserver.finderresults.showquerycount property are set to true, the count will ignore the derived field criteria when getting the count.\n\nglog.webserver.indicatorWhiteEqualsNull\n\nÂ\n\nIf the value is set to false, then all finder queries differentiate between a search of indicator = W (white) versus indicator = null. The default is true meaning a search on indicator = W (white) is essentially the same as a search of indicator = null.\n\nglog.webserver.invoice.useQuickVATCodeWhenNoVAT\n\nÂ\n\nTo prevent both the quick invoice Line VAT and Invoice Line Item VAT from displaying at the same time, this property has been added. When the invoice line item VAT information does not exist, this property is checked to determine how to display the VAT information. If the property is set to True, the Quick Invoice Line VAT Code displays instead of the Invoice Line Item VAT.\n\nIf the invoice line item VAT information exists, it is displayed regardless of the property setting.\n\nDefault: False\n\nglog.webserver.invoice.match_shipment_perspectives\n\nÂ\n\nWhen you run the action Manual Match Invoice and if you select to match it to a shipment,Â you can use this property to specify whether to support BUY, SELL or BOTH shipments.\n\nDefault: BUY\n\nglog.webserver.loadconfig.useCortona\n\n6.4.2\n\nWhen true, displays the 3D view of the View 3D Load Configuration shipment action using the Cortona plugin. When false, displays 3D view using built in functionality.\n\nCortona is not supported for the Workbench 3D viewer.\n\nDefault: false\n\nglog.webserver.locationCapacity.maxTimeWindowDays 24A This determines the maximum number of days of the time window while fetching location capacity usage data.\n\nglog.webserver.obshipunit.defaultIsShippableToTrue\n\n6.4.2\n\nIndicates what the Shippable flag on the order base ship unit should be set to when adding an order base, creating an order base from a template, and when copying an order base.\n\nWhen set to true (default), the Shippable check box is set to true for a new order base, a new order base created from a template and a new order base copied from an existing order base.\n\nWhen set to false, the Shippable check box is set to false for a new order base. OTM will take the existing Shippable value on the template or order base ship unit being copied.\n\nThe property has no effect while editing an existing order base ship unit.\n\nglog.webserver.omitShipUnitSpecFromTypeUOM\n\n5.5 CU5\n\nThis allows you to remove Ship Unit Specification data from the Type/UOM drop lists.\n\nglog.webserver.onlinehelp.url\n\n23A\n\nThis property contains the URL for centralized online help. Do not change this URL.\n\nglog.webserver.onlinehelp.enabled\n\n23A\n\nWhen this property is set to true then the help links open using the centralized online help external URL provided on glog.webserver.onlinehelp.url. When this property is set to false then the help links open using the local files that were installed along with the application.\n\nglog.webserver.opentender.displayPopupOnSave\n\n22A\n\nThis property will be considered while adding service providers on the Spot Bid Tender page.\n\nWhen a list of selected Lane Service Providers already exist:\n\nWhen the property is set to 'true', a popup âDo you want to keep Lane Service Providers selectedâ will display and wait for your response. Click \"OK\" to keep the Lane Service Providers check box selected. Â Click \"Cancel\" to deselect the Lane Service Providers check box and add new service providers.\n\nDefault: false\n\nglog.webserver.opentender.mandatoryRemarksQualifierÂ\n\n23B\n\nWhen this property is set to true, the application verifies if at least one remark qualifier and one remark text record are available when a service provider submits a bid for broadcast tender.\n\nDefault: false\n\nglog.webserver.opentender.optOutBiddingOption\n\n21C\n\nWhen this property is set to true and service provider edits an open tender, a \"Decline\" button is available to decline the bid even if a bid had previously been made. This is an option to opt out of bidding. When the response time is completed, the declined tender by the service provider will be not be considered.\n\nDecline does not affect or restrict planner from explicitly awarding the bid to them.\n\nDefault: false\n\nglog.webserver.opentender.rowCountToSingleRemarkGrid\n\n20C\n\nThis property enables the system to display more number of service providers in the Online Booking/Tendering screen.\n\nIf the number of service providers in the Online Booking/Tendering screen is greater than the value of property glog.webserver.opentender.rowCountToSingleRemarkGrid, OTM will display a single remarks grid (instead of one for each service provider).\n\nThe default value of this property is100.\n\nNote: This property is applicable for planners.\n\nÂ glog.webserver.opentender.servProvDefaultUnSelected Â\n\n22A\n\nWhen this property is set to true, all service providers listed on the open tender (Broadcast Tender and Spot Bid Tender) will not be selected by default.\n\nDefault: false\n\nglog.webserver.opentender.servProvLoadOnDemand\n\n22A\n\nThis property improves the performance of Spot Bid Tender, when there are multiple eligible service providers. For example: you may have many service providers or you may want to control when the eligible list is shown.\n\nIf you set this property to true:\n\nWhen you perform the Spot Bid Tender action then the Add Lane Service Providers button will appear instead of the Lane Service Providers section.\n\nIf you want to view the Lane Service Provider section, click the Add Lane Service Providers button. Â\n\nDefault: false\n\nglog.webserver.opentender.validateLastBid\n\n21C\n\nWhen this property is set to true, service provider must enter bid higher than the last bid for open tenders.\n\nIf the currency of the new bid differs from the last bid, an alert message appears while submitting the bid but the system will error out and not accept the bid.\n\nIf the new bid and last bid has same currency and new bid is less than the last bid, an alert message appears and the system will not allow you to submit the bid.\n\nDefault: false\n\nglog.webserver.order.DefaultFinderSetGid\n\n24A\n\nThis property determines whether the Order Release or Freight Forwarding Screen Set should be used by default.\n\nDefault: ORDER_RELEASE.\n\nglog.webserver.order.DefaultManager\n\n24A\n\nThis property determinesÂ whether the Order Release or Freight Forwarding Manager should be used by default.\n\nDefault:Â glog.webserver.order.OrderReleaseManagementServlet?finder_set_gid=ORDER_RELEASE\n\nglog.webserver.order.DefaultQuery\n\n6.2\n\nThis property determines whether the Transaction Manager will display the Order Release query or the Freight Forwarding query.\n\nglog.webserver.order.IsSplittableDefault\n\n6.2.1\n\nAllows you to set the default value for the Splittable field on an order release. Possible values are true or false.\n\nDefault: true\n\nglog.webserver.pegLogin\n\n6.3\n\nDuring login, the system optionally pings application servers to ensure it is both active and available. A server is unavailable when it's work threads are too busy to timely respond to an RMI request. Once an available server isÂ found, the system pegs all login work to that server. This guarantees that the login process won't hang due to some piece of work being directed to an unresponsive server. Set this to false to turn off login pegging.\n\nglog.webserver.queryBy.\n\n6.2\n\nSet this property to control how specific fields on screens may be configured to display names instead of GIDs. For example, you can change a Location picklist in the manager layout and set \"Replace GID\" with the location name field. This allows auto complete by the location name rather than the XID. In this example you can type \"Philadelphia International Airport\" (location name) instead of \"PHL\" (location XID). It will also display the location name instead of the XID.\n\nThe format for the property is glog.webserver.queryBy.[picklist query=record name]/[XML name from query resources], next entry. For example glog.webserver.queryBy.glog.server.query.item.ItemQuery=item/name. Setting the property enables the Replace GID and Value to Replace GID fields on the Manager Layout.\n\nglog.webserver.queryBy.glog.server.query.item.ItemQuery=item/name\n\nglog.webserver.queryBy.glog.server.query.servprov.CountryCodeQuery=country_code/country_name\n\nglog.webserver.queryBy.glog.server.query.servprov.LocationQuery=location/name\n\nglog.webserver.queryBy.glog.server.query.servprov.ServprovQuery=servprov/location/name\n\nglog.webserver.refnum.link.<REFNUM_GID>\n\n=<http://server_name?argument={0}>\n\n6.2\n\nSet this property for each service provider to enable linking to the tracking system that each service provider maintains. The property has several sections which are configurable for each service provider. This feature is only available for pages that are configurable and the Track and Trace pages.\n\nglog.webserver.refnum.link.REFNUM_GID: When defining the property, the REFNUM_GID is replaced by the refnum qualifier for the service provider.\n\nhttp://server_name: The name of the server where the service provider publishes its tracking system.\n\n?argument={0}: The argument takes a refnum value supplied dynamically by the system\n\nFor example, you are setting the property to link for FEDEX's tracking numbers. You would define the property as follows: glog.webserver.refnum.link.FEDEX=http://www.fedex.com?tracking_number={0}\n\nWhen configured this way and you are on a manager with a refnum qualifier of FEDEX, the associated refnum value will appear as a link that will take you to the FEDEX website to track a shipment.\n\nglog.webserver.riq_mode\n\nÂ\n\nDetermines how Ask Oracle About Rates behaves.\n\ntrim: When set to trim, the rate wizard is faster when you have many ship unit specifications defined. Additionally:\n\nCountry code (source and destination) is a pick list\n\nShip unit specification is a pick list.\n\nstandard: When set to standard, the rate wizard is slower when you have many ship unit specifications defined. Additionally:\n\nCountry code (source and destination) is a drop list.\n\nShip unit specification is a drop list.\n\nWhen a value is entered in the transport handling unit in the Rate Inquiry input screen,this will reload the page, populating the weight, volume, and so on for that transport handling unit, if it exists.\n\nDefault is trim.\n\nglog.webserver.riq_ui_default_logic_config 24A This property specifies the default logic configuration for rate inquiry. glog.webserver.riq.useDomainPlanningParameterSet 24A\n\nThis property is used to specify whether the planningÂ parameter set on the rate inquiry input UI should be set with the planning parameter set configured for the logged in user, and if it is not configured for the user then the planning set configured at the domain level.\n\nglog.webserver.rts.defaultShipFromAsBlank\n\n6.4.2\n\nThis property controls how the Ship From field is populated when you run the Ready to Ship action on the Order Base Line/Order Base Ship Unit manager.\n\nWhen this is 'false', the Ship From field still populates the source location on the order base ship unit/order base line.\n\nWhen it is 'true', the Ship From field is blank and you can enter in the location.\n\nThe default value of this property is 'false'.\n\nglog.webserver.rts.hideOBLinesOnMaxCount\n\n21C\n\nWhen this property is set to true and when you run the Ready to Ship action, the system will not display the order base line items grid, if the number of order base lines is greater than the value of the property glog.webserver.rts.maxNumberOfOBLinesToDisplay.\n\nDefault is false.\n\nglog.webserver.rts.generalValidation\n\nÂ\n\nIndicates if the general validation should be done. The property is used in the following screens:\n\nOrder Base Ship Unit:\n\nrelease instruction\n\nready to ship\n\nOrder Release:\n\nconfirm to ship\n\nDefault: False\n\nglog.webserver.rts.maxNumberOfOBLinesToDisplay\n\n21C\n\nWhen this property is set to 100 and the property glog.webserver.rts.hideOBLinesOnMaxCounttrue is set to true; when the order base lines count is greater than 100, the system will not display order base line items grid and release instructions. You should release all the remaining amount and you cannot modify individual lines.\n\nglog.webserver.rts.obl.checkDates\n\nÂ\n\nIndicates of the Ready to Ship date validation should be done for the order base line.\n\nDefault: False\n\nglog.webserver.rts.obsu.checkDates\n\nÂ\n\nIndicates if the Ready to Ship date validation should be done for the order base ship unit.\n\nThe property is used in the following screens:\n\nOrder Base Ship Unit:\n\nrelease instruction\n\nready to ship\n\nOrder Release:\n\nconfirm to ship\n\nDefault: False\n\nglog.webserver.rts.remarkLevel\n\nÂ\n\nThis property indicates the level of the remark for the order base remarks to be shown on the Ready to Ship and Confirm to Ship pages.\n\nValid values: 1-5\n\nDefault: 5 (all remarks will be shown)\n\nglog.webserver.rts.su.checkQuantity\n\nÂ\n\nIndicates if the ship unit quantity validation should be done.\n\nDefault: False\n\nglog.webserver.rts.su.packagedCountTolerance\n\nÂ\n\nIndicates the percentage tolerance allowed for the total package count validation.\n\nDefault: 0\n\nglog.webserver.savedquerynamecache\n\nÂ\n\nThis property enables/disables caching of savedquerynamecache. The valid options are true or false. The cache is on by default (true).\n\nIf you want to limit saved queries by user and not by domain, turn off the cache since the caches are domain-specific. Additionally if you are having memory issues, turn off the cache as it is stored in memory. When the cache is disabled the database is access every time a user clicks the Saved Query drop down list, which affects performance but frees up memory. If the cache is turned on, then the cache is refreshed whenever a query is added, edited, or removed.\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.adjustShipmentCost.isAdjustReasonMandatory 24A\n\nThis property is used to determine whether the field adjustment reasonÂ is mandatory or not for the Shipment action Adjust Shipment Cost screen.Â This will be an optional if the property is set to false.\n\nDefault: true.\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.changeSP.ignoreEquipment\n\n5.5. CU5\n\nDetermines the default value for the check box Ignore Equipment, when you run Change Service Provider action in Shipment Manager.\n\nDefault: false (not selected).\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.changeSP.ignoreMode\n\n5.5. CU5\n\nDetermines the default value for the check box Ignore Mode, when you run Change Service Provider action in Shipment Manager.\n\nDefault: false (not selected).\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.changeSP.ignoreServiceTime\n\n5.5. CU5\n\nDetermines the default value for the check box Ignore Service Time, when you run Change Service Provider action in Shipment Manager.\n\nDefault: false (not selected).\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.changeSP.ratePreference\n\n6.2\n\nDetermines if preferred rates are displayed.\n\nValue 0 = Do not use Preferred Rates, Value 1 = Preferred Rates Only, and Value 3 = Preferred Rates if available.\n\nDefault: 2\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.changeSP.showDigitalFreightRates 23C\n\nDetermines the default value for the Allow Digital Freight Rates check box , when you run Change Service Provider action in Shipment Manager.\n\nDefault: false (not selected).\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.changeSP.showpreferredOnly\n\n5.5. CU5\n\nDetermines the default value for the check box Show Preferred Only, when you run Change Service Provider action in Shipment Manager.\n\nDefault: false (not selected).\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.changeSP.sortByCost\n\n6.2\n\nDetermines how service providers will be sorted by cost or weighted cost. If true, sorting is by cost. If false, sorting is by weighted cost.\n\nDefault: true\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.ignoreEquipmentSummaryForEditScreen\n\n19B\n\nWhen set to true, OTM will ignore, i.e., skip the loading of shipment equipment summary (total weight/volume/ERU) in the Shipment edit screen. This can improve performance when loading a lot of shipments.\n\nThe default is false.\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.ignoreEquipmentSummaryForViewScreen\n\n19B\n\nWhen set to true, OTM will ignore, i.e., skip the loading of shipment equipment summary (total weight/volume/ERU) in the Shipment view screen. This can improve performance when loading a lot of shipments.\n\nThe default is false.\n\nglog.webserver.shipment.manualBuild.estimatedCost\n\n5.5 CU3\n\nAllows the Estimated Cost Currency field to pre-populate with the value specified in the property. For example, 751.48 USD. Note that you need a space between the amount and the currency. The default is blank.

The Online Booking/TenderingÂ screen will check the current shipment cost against the spot tender bid entry threshold and not allow to submit if the carrier entered a value outside the threshold. This will work for both positive and negative values.\n\nAn example is a shipment cost of $100. In the property, the spot tender bid entry threshold is set to 0.20. The carrier is allowed to enter bids of $80-$120. (If you want a 20% threshold, then the property needs to be set as .2.)\n\nThere is no default value for this property.\n\nNote: This property is only valid for the service provider role.\n\nglog.webserver.tender.spotBid.lowerBidThreshold\n\n23A\n\nUse this property to specify the lowest threshold allowed to enter for a spot bid on theÂ Online Booking/TenderingÂ screen.

Or, set the property using this format: Domain.Logic Config value.\n\nIf you need this to apply this at specific user/domain level, consider using the \"User Interface Configuration Preference\" user preference: to associate the UI logic configuration.\n\nDefault: UI CONFIGURATION DEFAULT\n\nglog.webserver.uic.getTenderInfo.showTenderInfoPage\n\nÂ\n\nDisplays the Tender Contact Information UI when the Secure Resources and Tender Shipment actions are performed.\n\nDefault: False\n\nThis must be set to True for consolidated notification.\n\nglog.webserver.tender.useGrantedDomains 24A\n\nWhen the property is set to true, OTM displaysÂ locations from all granted domains for source and destination locations of the Bid Options on the Spot Bid Tender Response screen.\n\nWhen set to false, the locations will be available only from shipment domain and public domain.\n\nDefault: False\n\nglog.webserver.user.changePasswordWait\n\n6.3\n\nThis property allows an artificial wait on the server thread during a password change. This allows the JMS messages to reach all of the application servers in a Scalability environment before trying to do an authentication against another application server. The glog.webserver.pegLogin property supersedes this property. The format for the property is \"# S\" where # is the number of seconds.\n\nDefault: \"3 S\"\n\nglog.webserver.userrole.droplist.limit\n\n20A\n\nThis property allows you to increase the number or records returned in the User Role drop-down list in the Settings and Actions pop-up.\n\nDefault: 1000\n\nglog.webserver.user_menu.multi_level_sort\n\n23A\n\nIf set to true, the application willÂ alphabetically sort the menu items inside each level (user, user level, userÂ role, and domain).\n\nThe default is false.\n\nglog.webserver.valueLookup.limit\n\n22C\n\nThis property limits the number of records returned by the GTM_LOCATION and GTM_ITEM screen sets.\n\nDefault: 100\n\nglog.webserver.workbench.restTimeout\n\n22A\n\nThis property sets the timeout for the Rest API to return data to the Workbench. Value is in seconds. Minimum value is 30. You can set this property to a number greater than 60 to allow the map to fetch a large number of objects in a single REST API call.\n\nDefault: 60\n\nglog.webserver.workbench.useActorUser 24A\n\nWhen this value is true, any inline edit change on table would trigger lifetime events with data source as \"USER\". In case the value is false, lifetime events would be triggered with data source as \"INTERNAL\".\n\nDefault: true"
