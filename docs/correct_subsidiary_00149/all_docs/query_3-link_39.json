        "text": "I would certainly say it should. The SQL*Net protocol it uses is essentially unchanged. Here's an example of me connecting an Oracle 9 to an Oracle 10 server.\n\noracle@cammi:~$ sqlplus \"urs/urs@THANOS_URS\"\n\nSQL*Plus: Release 9.2.0.8.0 - Production on Thu Jun 25 05:55:57 2009\n\nCopyright (c) 1982, 2002, Oracle Corporation. All rights reserved.\n\nConnected to: Oracle Database 10g Enterprise Edition Release 10.2.0.4.0 - 64bit Production With the Partitioning, Data Mining and Real Application Testing options\n\nAccording to the guys at \"http://www.experts-exchange.com/\"...\n\n11 can talk to 11,10,9 10 can talk to 11,10,9,8 9 can talk to 11,10,9,8,7 8 can talk to 10,9,8,7 7 can talk to 9,8,7\n\nAccording to Oracle forums, this is defined in Metalink DocID 207303.1, which provides a comprehensive client/ server compatibility matrix. I don't have Metalink access sadly, so I can't confirm this.\n\nIf you are having connection troubles, I suggest you start with the Oracle alert log on your server machine. To find the location of your oracle alert log:\n\nSQL> select value from v$parameter where name = 'background_dump_dest';\n\nAlso, you'll probably get something useful out of enabling listener tracing:\n\n$ lsnrctl LSNRCTL> set trc_level ADMIN\n\nThe trace file on my Solaris Oracle 10 install is found in:\n\n$ORACLE_HOME/network/trace/listener.trc\n\nYou can view it directly or use the trcasst program to \"format\" it. Note that ALL of this is on the server, not your client side.\n\nHope this helps."
