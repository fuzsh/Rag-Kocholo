See the \"Available Custom Shapes\" section of theÂ REST API for Fusion Cloud Transportation and Global Trade Management Business Object Resources for details.\n\nNote: If you are using a custom mobile layout and change this property from \"shipmentNoSSUs\" to \"shipments\" then you need to change all the endPoints for your boxeIds from using \"shipments\" to using \"shipmentNoSSUs\" in that custom mobile layout.\n\nThe query parameter expandRefs controls whether a GID will be shown for a foreign key or whether there will be a link URL to the referenced resource. Default is \"true\".\n\nIf specified as \"true\" the links will be shown. When this is enabled, all columns which reference a table associated with one of the supported root resources will appear as URL links. Setting this value to \"true\" would make the links appear by default without the expandRefs query parameter needing to be specified.\n\nSet this property to true to have outbound REST client calls automatically follow a redirect response message (i.e. HTTP 3xx status). Note that the default approach of not following the redirection is recommended for outbound integration. The use of the redirection status codes 3xx is rare and so should only be used if required by the specific API which in this use case is the HERE matrix routing calculation API.\n\nDefault: false\n\nThis is a comma-separated list of JSON paths for reference resources which should be flattened within the parent object for GET (pull) and/or REST outbound (push).\n\nDefault value is an empty string; i.e. there is no default value.\n\nThis is a comma-separated list of JSON paths for reference resources which should be flattened within the parent object for GET (pull) and/or REST outbound (push).\n\nDefault value is an empty string; i.e. there is no default value.\n\nThe property controls whether or not to format the âresourceUrlâ that will appear in outbound REST messages. If true, the URL will always start with a \"/\". If false, then it will not start with a \"/\".\n\nDefault: true"
