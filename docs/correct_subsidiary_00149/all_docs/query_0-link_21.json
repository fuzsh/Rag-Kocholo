All of the one-week sell/buy ratios from Vickers Stock Research improved this week (but are not stellar), while all the eight-week ratios are best described as flat. From a longer-term view, the six-month-based Insider Index from Vickers appears to have leveled off after months of deterioration -- and indeed improved slightly from last week. Still, the reading remains far from bullish territory and no return to bullish is imminent as the index is at its most-bearish level since September 2021. End of day, there is no compelling movement in insider sentiment this week. Meanwhile, according to Argus' Mark Arbeter, CMT, 'market breadth is certainly not optimal for a bull market, and eventually one of two things likely will happen. The rest (or part) of the market will wake up and start to participate, adding to the semiconductors strength, or the semis will run into trouble and take an already weak market structure lower. Dominance by the heavily weighted market caps is not a bad thing -- as long as it persists.' On a sector basis, selling by insiders last week was greatest in Information Technology, with shares valued at $1.11 billion sold, followed by Consumer Staples ($338 million sold) and Financials ($185 million sold). Buying outpaced selling in Energy, with $107 million of shares bought versus $45 million sold, as well as in Real Estate and Materials. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) and Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL).\n\nOracle Earnings: IaaS Signings More Than Makes Up for Miss; Raising Fair Value to $98 From $84\n\nOracle provides database technology and enterprise resource planning, or ERP, software to enterprises around the world.
