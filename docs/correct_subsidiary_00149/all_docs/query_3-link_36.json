        "text": "Having sucessfully implemented both the Oracle and JDE ERP offerings, I am\n\nof the opinion that the Oracle package is probably further along when it\n\ncomes to being truly web enabled. And, if you have the Oracle data base in\n\nplace, it is a bit easier to implement the Oracle Apps as the Oracle Apps\n\nhave been specifically written to run using the Oracle DB.\n\nJDE is, in my opinion, much more flexible in that it is quite possible for\n\neach individual to create their own personalized screens and/or report\n\nformats to do business.\n\nBoth packages are functionally complete.\n\nI hope this was helpful.\n\nBill Cure, CFPIM\n\nGlobal ERP Director\n\nIn general, what does your company do? Is it a manufacturer or distributor?\n\nDo you make or sell products that require field service? Are you a $50\n\nmillion dollar company or a $500M company? If you are manufacturer, do you\n\nmake to stock, engineer to order, require configure to order, etc? What key\n\nspecial features do you required that you must have? Do you have a large IT\n\nstaff, or only 1 person?\n\nIn general it is easy to say one is better then the other. However, in\n\nreality, one is better then the other in one situation, but not as good in\n\nanother. Under $50M, there normally both wrong.\n\nHowever, it is not fair to either product without the proper information.\n\nRob:\n\nUltimately our company will be at 100 users. Our implementation, which was\n\noriginally planned to be complete in 12 months, is now expected to be\n\ncomplete by end of this year(2 year roll-out). We have been struggling with\n\nsevere performance problems (the system originally sized for 100 users now\n\nis too small for 35), integration (we were unable to close our books for 6\n\nmonths. To date we still have transactions getting hung up between the\n\nmodules, purchasing, A/R, A?P, etc… and the G/L). In addition there were\n\ncertain modules that we purchased that we simply walked away from because we\n\nhave been unable to get them to even run, and Oracle Corporation insisted on\n\ncharging us maintenance on the products for the entire year even though the\n\nbug fixes to allow it to run were not released until 12 months after our\n\npurchase! So we paid for a year of maintenance on a product that literally\n\nwould not work - and Oracle acknowledges that - but they insisted that we\n\npay maintenance fees on it).\n\nOverall I think the application is getting more stable, but in my opinion,\n\nit is about two to three years from being where it should be today. Once you\n\nare able to get it to work it does fine, it is just a long, hard, expensive\n\nroad to get there.\n\nNilesh/Stefano/others:\n\nCould you please clarify some of your statements regarding Oracle and JDE\n\ndifferences. Did your organization switch from JDE to Oracle, or are your\n\nstatements simply based on a comparison of functionality during a\n\nsoftware evaluation. I would agree that Oracle Apps was built through\n\nacquisitions and therefore exhibits varying degrees of robustness on a\n\nmodule by module basis. In a previous comparison of SAP against Oracle we\n\nfound that Oracle had a more dynamic or fluid level of integration than\n\nSAP. I presume this has since been corrected.\n\nI believe Oracle might represent a better fit in certain business models\n\nover JDE but maybe not so in some other areas, or verticals. It would be\n\nhelpful to know what type of industry we’re speaking about. Oracle is\n\ngenerally considered more difficult to implement than JDE. As for\n\nFinancials, these are pretty much standard, commodity type applications\n\nwithout tremendous variation from vendor to vendor. Usually, distribution\n\nprocesses and practices can vary widely. For instance, forecasting,\n\npricing and warehousing are a few of the key areas where software can\n\nvary greatly. As for manufacturing, are we talking process or discrete,\n\nmake to order or make to stock – each has varying requirements. For\n\ninstance, I find Oracle being chosen by process industry clients, along\n\nwith SAP and Ross. I see both SAP and Oracle in CPG while JDE is being\n\nimplemented more so by both MTO and MTS manufacturers – especially in\n\nthe middle market.\n\nI frequently find SAP and Oracle competing for the same clients while JDE\n\nis usually mentioned when IFS, Intentia, QAD and Baan enter the equation.\n\nJDE has strong midrange and middle market roots. If you’re an AS/400 shop\n\nand want to remain so, JDE has a strong commitment to the platform and is\n\nthe strongest player in the middle market. Oracle is a no show on the\n\nAS/400 and SAP could be the next PeopleSoft on the platform.\n\nSoftware selection is a highly individual process as no two organizations\n\nare exactly alike. Therefore, the evaluation process must be a showcase\n\nfor your most important or most unique processes that a general purpose\n\nsoftware package is being considered for. My recommendation, given you\n\nare in the early stages of the selection process, is to pick 4 or 5 key\n\nbusiness transactions and have each vendor demonstrate how the system is\n\nsetup to accomplish each task and how it then performs the task against\n\nyour criteria. When I build scenarios for demos to compare software\n\npackages I like to think along two main dimensions – the relative\n\ncomplexity of the process and how critical the process is to the\n\nbusiness. If a package handles the toughest business processes you have\n\nwith relative ease, it is generally speaking a strong contender for a\n\ngiven business.\n\nRegards,\n\nBob Starinsky\n\n**** This E-Mail Was Sent By ****\n\nRobert W. Starinsky, Principal/Owner\n\nTradewinds Group, Incorporated, Consultants to Management\n\n630/871-1149 Voice, 630/221-8089 Fax,\n\nwww.tradewindsgroupinc.com\n\nOn Tue, 12 Feb 2002 15:30:43 +0100 “RIBONI Stefano via erp-select”\n\nWe have 30 - 35 users. Our database administration contract runs about\n\n$150,000 per year. This covers all database adminsitration, patching,\n\nmonitoring and tuning. We have an IT staff of 3 now, and if we were to do it\n\nright, would added about 2 to 3 more heads. The additional staff are need to\n\ninvestigate application problems, log TAR’s (technical assistance requests),\n\nrun and test corrective SQL scripts, identify potential patch fixes (these\n\nget forwarded to the DB), coordinate and perform testing of each patch,\n\netc…\n\nNote that to get an Oracle functional “expert” on staff runs you between 90k\n\nto 125K per year (salary only - add another 30% for benefits). This is one\n\nissue we have been struggling with. How does a company justify paying a 4\n\nyear degreed applicant with 4 to 5 years business experience (whose duties\n\nare to handle such issues as making accounts receivable post correctly to\n\nthe general ledger) a salary that approaches that paid to Executives that\n\nhave been with our company for 15 years and literally have assisted in\n\nbuilding the organization as it is today (7th largest privately held company\n\nin Florida).\n\nNilesh,\n\nBoth Oracle and JD Edwards have their strengths and weaknesses…both\n\nare also attempting to be all things to all people, the key is not what\n\neach does or doesn’t do well, but the level of fit and function to your\n\norganization’s key business processes. Without first\n\ndefining/identifying, weighting, prioritizing the target business\n\nprocesses, there is no sense in comparing the vendor packages…they\n\nwill tell you what you want to hear. The best approach is to employ a\n\nsolution selection methodology that maps out all the steps to\n\nefficiently and effectively align your target business processes with\n\nthe vendor solutions, and then ask each vendor to present a specific\n\ndemo tailored to scripts developed specifically for your business.\n\nThink of it this way, don’t ask them what they have, tell them what you\n\nneed, they can either deliver or they can’t, the scripted demos will\n\nanswer the question."
