        "text": "In Mobile Hub, a backend is a secure grouping of APIs and other resources for a set of apps. Within a backend, you select the APIs that you want available for those apps. For any apps that you want to receive notifications, you can also register the appropriate credentials for the given network (e.g. APNS or FCM) in the backend.\n\nYou can have multiple backends, each serving a set of applications. In addition, you can have APIs that are used by multiple backends.\n\nWhen an app accesses APIs through Mobile Hub, it is always in the context of a backend. The app authenticates with credentials (OAuth Consumer or HTTP Basic Authentication) specific to the backend or through an identity provider (or social login provider) that is mediated by your backend."
