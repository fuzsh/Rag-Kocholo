The company was founded on the MS Windows operating system and MS Office business applications suite for PCs. As it has grown, Microsoft has expanded into enterprise software with Windows Server, SQL Server, Dynamics CRM, SharePoint, Azure, and Lync; hardware with the Xbox gaming/media platform and the Surface tablet; and online services through MSN and Bing. Microsoft acquired Skype, the internet VoIP communications service, in October 2011. More than 50% of revenue is generated outside the U.S.\n\nRating\n\nPrice Target\n\nEarnings season is about to begin (which might push stocks higher), stocks\n\nEarnings season is about to begin (which might push stocks higher), stocks already are at all-time highs, investors are increasingly optimistic that interest rates will start to come down soon -- and corporate insiders increased their selling activity last week. But putting that all in perspective, it is important to note that insiders historically increase selling rates as stocks move higher and higher, taking some money off the table in shares for which they may have paid little or nothing. Also of note is that insiders are entering a period in which they will be limited in their ability to trade because of restrictions in place during earnings season. So they need to trade now or hold their cards for the better part of a month. At the end of the day, we are hard-pressed to ring alarm bells based on current insider sentiment. On a sector basis, selling by insiders last week was greatest in Consumer Staples, with shares valued at $554 million sold, followed by Information Technology ($293 million sold) and Healthcare ($65 million sold). Meanwhile, buying outpaced selling in Industrials, with shares valued at $55 million bought versus $29 million sold, as well as in Energy. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Coca-Cola Consolidated Inc. (NGS: COKE) and Noble Corp. plc (NYSE: NE).\n\nPeople Also Watch\n\nAAPL Apple Inc.\n\n225.00\n\n+0.31%\n\nAMZN Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n184.30\n\n+0.64%\n\nGOOG Alphabet Inc.\n\n183.71\n\n+2.41%\n\nMETA Meta Platforms, Inc.\n\n488.38\n\n+2.43%\n\nNVDA NVIDIA Corporation\n\n123.19\n\n+4.46%\n\nINTC Intel Corporation\n\n32.99\n\n+0.03%\n\nTSLA Tesla, Inc.\n\n251.28\n\n+5.05%\n\nAMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n154.53\n\n+1.95%\n\nNFLX Netflix, Inc.\n\n654.02\n\n+3.26%\n\nDIS The Walt Disney Company\n\n93.58\n\n-2.26%\n\nCSCO Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\n46.88\n\n-0.93%\n\nWMT Walmart Inc.\n\n70.48\n\n-0.38%\n\nIBM International Business Machines Corporation\n\n183.45\n\n+0.11%\n\nBAC Bank of America Corporation\n\n42.30\n\n-1.40%\n\nPFE Pfizer Inc.\n\n29.53\n\n-1.47%\n\nBA The Boeing Company\n\n178.15\n\n-0.85%"
