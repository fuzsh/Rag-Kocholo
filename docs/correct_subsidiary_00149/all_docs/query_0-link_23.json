All object accounts must be the same length. To make data entry easier and faster, you might want to use only numbers for the object account.\n\nThe subsidiary, or minor, account is an optional part of the account. Use the subsidiary when you need detailed accounting activity for an object account.\n\nThis example shows how you can associate the object account 1110 for Cash in Bank with several subsidiary accounts:"
