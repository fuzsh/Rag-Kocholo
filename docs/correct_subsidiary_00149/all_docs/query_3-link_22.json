        "text": "This property deals with the message that occurs when a user tries to login multiple times with an invalid password and the account gets locked out. A vague message will not indicate that the password is correct.\n\nThis property checks account status even if the password is invalid. If the status is dormant or locked out, the client will get a locked out error even if his password is invalid. If true, the locked-out message takes precedence over an invalid login message.\n\nDefault: true\n\nOracle Transportation Management security allows each user to be assigned an account policy. This policy provides login and password rules, enables login tracking and controls account expiration. The Account Policy function can be turned on or off system-wide using this property. It is recommended that you keep this feature off for Oracle Transportation Management instances using Single Sign-On by setting this to true.\n\nTo suppress all assigned account policies, set glog.login.suppressAccountPolicy = true."
