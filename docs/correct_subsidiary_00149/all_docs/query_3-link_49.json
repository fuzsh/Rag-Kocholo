After that, it is purged and the archived log files are moved to NFS mount storage, which is accessible by logminer. Three copies are created. The logminer should be able to access any of the copies. This is transparent to Oracle GoldenGate Extract. After it reaches 7 days, the NFS mounted copy is permanently removed. The Extract abends with the archived log unavailable error if the required archived log file is older than 7 days.\n\nOracle Autonomous Database on Dedicated Exadata Infrastructure: When Oracle Autonomous Data Guard or Oracle GoldenGate is enabled, archived log files are kept in Fast Recovery Area (FRA) for up to 7 days. After that, the files are purged. There is no NFS mount location available for logminer to access archived log files that are older than 7 days. The Extract abends with the archived log unavailable error if the required archived log file is older than 7 days.\n\nNote:\n\nIf the database instance is closed for more than 15 minutes, then the retention time is set back to 3 days. This implies that retention of archived log files is confirmed only for 3 days, regardless of whether the database instance is closed. The files are retained for 7 days only if the database instance is not closed.\n\nConfiguring Replicat to Apply to an Autonomous Database\n\nYou can replicate into the Autonomous Database from any source database or platform that is supported by Oracle GoldenGate.\n\nTopics:\n\nPrerequisites for Configuring Oracle GoldenGate Replicat to an Autonomous Database\n\nConfigure Oracle GoldenGate Replicat for an Autonomous Database\n\nLearn the steps to configure Oracle GoldenGate Replicat for an Autonomous Database.\n\nHere are the steps to complete the configuration tasks:\n\nNote:\n\nInstructions are based on the assumption that the source environment is already configured.\n\nFor Oracle GoldenGate on-premises, make sure that Oracle GoldenGate is installed.\n\nOracle GoldenGate Classic Architecture supports Autonomous Database capture using Marketplace for Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless\n\n(Microservices only) Create a deployment for your Oracle GoldenGate environment. This is the deployment where the Replicat that applies data into the Autonomous Database (ADB) will be created. See How to Create Deployments for steps to add a deployment.\n\nThe Autonomous Database has a pre-existing user created for Oracle GoldenGate on-premise called ggadmin. The ggadmin user has been granted the required privileges for Replicat to work. This is the user where any objects used for Oracle GoldenGate processing will be stored, like the checkpoint table and heartbeat objects. By default, this user is locked. To unlock the ggadmin user, connect to the Oracle Autonomous Database instance as the ADMIN user using any SQL client tool. See Create Users on Autonomous Database with Database Actions.\n\nRun the ALTER USER command to unlock the ggadmin user and set the password for it. This will be used in GGSCI or Admin Client for any DBLOGIN operations on the Autonomous Database. It will be used in Replicat to allow Oracle GoldenGate to connect to the Autonomous Database and apply data. See Create Users on Autonomous Database with Database Actions.ALTER USER ggadmin IDENTIFIED BY p0$$word ACCOUNT UNLOCK;\n\nObtain the Autonomous Database Client Credentials\n\nLearn how to establish a connection to your Autonomous Database.\n\nTo establish a connection with an Oracle Autonomous Database instance, you need to download the client credentials files. There are two ways to download the client credentials files: the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console or Database Actions Launchpad. See Downloading Client Credentials (Wallets).\n\nNote:\n\nIf you do not have administrator access to the Oracle Autonomous Database, you should ask your service administrator to download and provide the credentials files to you.\n\nThe following steps use the Database Actions Launchpad to download the client credentials files:\n\nLog into your Autonomous Database account.\n\nFrom the Database Instance page, click Database Actions. This launches the Database Actions Launchpad. The Launchpad attempts to log you into the database as ADMIN. If that is not successful, you will be prompted for your database ADMIN username and password.\n\nOn the Database Actions Launchpad, under Administration, click Download Client Credentials (Wallets).\n\nEnter a password to secure your Client Credentials zip file and click Download.\n\nNote:\n\nThe password you provide when you download the wallet protects the downloaded Client Credentials wallet.\n\nSave the credentials ZIP file to your local system. The credentials ZIP file contains the following files:\n\ncwallet.sso\n\newallet.p12\n\nkeystore.jks\n\nojdbc.properties\n\nsqlnet.ora\n\ntnsnames.ora\n\ntruststore.jks\n\newallet.pem\n\nREADME.txt\n\nRefer and update (if required) the sqlnet.ora and tnsnames.ora files while configuring Oracle GoldenGate to work with the Oracle Autonomous Database instance.\n\nConfigure Replicat to Apply to an Autonomous Database"
