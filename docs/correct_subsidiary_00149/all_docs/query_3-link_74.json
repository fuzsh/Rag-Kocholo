        "text": "This page is accessed via Configuration and Administration > Power Data > Diagnostics > Log Files.\n\nLog files record the time and severity of errors (if the Log ID is turned on, then Debug severity is on. If off, only Error severity is on), warnings, and other system events. Log files are useful for monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance analysis. All logging is implicitly off, until explicitly turned on.\n\nNote: Excessive logging affects performance. There is a Logging Overview page that provides a quick way of suppressing logging to check performance issues without actually turning off logging.\n\nYou can add and edit new log files to meet the specific troubleshooting and performance analysis needs of your installation. For example, you could create a log file to monitor the warning messages generated by a specific user using certain business processes.\n\nNote: The SYSTEM log file is a public log file and cannot be edited or deleted. By default, it monitors system events (that is, debug and error messages, performance summaries and details, and warnings).\n\nCreating Log Files\n\nEnter a unique Log ID for the new log file. If you are creating a user log file, its Log ID must match a system user name, without its DOMAIN/SUBDOMAIN. prefix. For example, if the user name is GUEST.ADMIN, the LOG ID would be ADMIN.\n\nFrom the list, select the Domain Name to be monitored.\n\nThe SYSTEM, WEB, and EXCEPTION log files are marked as Reserved. They can be edited, but their type, filename, and append check box cannot be modified, nor can they be deleted.\n\nIf a log file is Modifiable, you can edit it.\n\nSelect the Type of log file.\n\nAction:Â When running a finder/manager action, editing a top-level record, or submitting a process control action, you may opt to turn on a log dedicated to that action by selecting a log profile. While the action runs, all logging needed for diagnostics is written out to a single, specific log file. When the action completes, you can view the focused log and download it for offline analysis. SeeÂ About Action Logging.\n\nAd Hoc for logging selected business processes, such as integration and bulk planning.\n\nStartup logs act like ad-hoc logs but only record information prior to the completion of system startup. This allows all startup errors to be collected and stored in a log, without being lost to do later log cycling. Startup information is still available in other logs like SYSTEM.\n\nSystem for logging events throughout the system.\n\nUser for logging the events pertaining to a specific user. If using this type, the ID must match a user, for example, Admin.\n\nWeb for controlling UI component logging. These settings control all aspects of UI component logging including the filename, maximum size, backup count, and enabled log IDs. If you modify settings for the Web log via power data, all servers are notified and retrieve the modified settings on the next servlet use. You can create any number of Web log files. Each Web log will be accessible via the System log viewer.\n\nSelect the ON check box to turn the log on.\n\nIf you enter a time in the Enable Until field, suppression of log IDs in this log via Disable Logging is ignored until you pass the Enable Until time. This allows you to modify a log file and force all log IDs in that log to output diagnostic information until the specified time. Scheduled Disable Logging requests will have no impact on those log IDs. If this field is blank, it uses the value from the glog.log.enabled.defaultDuration property to populate \"Enable Until\". Any log IDs enabled for a log will not be able to be suppressed via the Logging Overview page until the Enable Until time has expired. All log IDs enabled for a log will be enabled across all logs using the same IDs.\n\nEnter a Filename to which the data will be saved. By default, the log file is saved to <otm_install_dir>/logs/. The filename must be unique.\n\nThe Append check box is selected by default. If you clear the check box, the log file will be deleted at every new session. If selected, enter a Max Size in bytes for the file (for example, 10000000 for a 10 MB file) and the number of Backups of the file to be saved. Oracle Transportation Management starts a new log file when reaching the Max Size. For example, if you specify three backups of files 10 MB in size, a total of 30 MB of log files will be saved. Logging does affect performance. It is not recommended to increase the maximum size. Rather than increase the size, you may want to increase the number of backups.\n\nThe Max Size (in bytes) field controls the largest size the log file can be, measured in bytes.\n\nThe Backups field indicates the number of backup versions of the log file.\n\nEnter a Log Profile ID and click Save.\n\nIn the Log File Details section, select the business processes to be monitored. Select the detail in the left column and click the > button to move it to the right column. See the topic Log IDs for a list of the Process IDs that you can configure for a log.\n\nNote: Some logging options write a lot of information to the logs and should be disabled unless you need to investigate a particular instance. This is especially true for SQL and any options that have \"details\" in the title.\n\nTo add a new detail, enter a Process ID in the Detail field (for example, Agent) and click Save.\n\nClick Finished.\n\nExamples\n\nAn issue may require several logging options to be enabled.\n\nRating\n\nFor issues with Rating, use the default logging options and the following:\n\nDistance\n\nMultistop\n\nOrderBundling\n\nPlanning\n\nRateEngine\n\nServiceTime\n\nWorkPeriodSchedule\n\nYou can also use the following detailed rating logging options:\n\nDistanceDetails\n\nMultistopDetails\n\nOrderBundling\n\nOrderBundlingDetails\n\nPlanningDetails\n\nRateEngineDetails\n\nServiceTimeDetails\n\nWorkPeriodScheduleDetail\n\nAutomation Agents and Automated Processing Issues\n\nIssues related to automation agents or automated processes require the following logging options enabled:"
