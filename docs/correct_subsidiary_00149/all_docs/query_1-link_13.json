        "text": "I want to take a moment to give a big THANK YOU to Oracle for the wonderful and successful journey my career has been, and the promise of what is yet to come. It’s hard to contemplate that I’m leaving the best job I’ve ever had, with some of the smartest and most dedicated people I’ve ever had the opportunity to work with. If it weren’t for the fact that I’ll continue to be able to work with my customers and my Oracle family of friends and colleagues, I couldn’t blame anyone for calling me crazy. While I’ve separated my employment from Oracle, I’m not leaving the neighborhood, I’m only moving next door.\n\nI’m very excited to announce that I've joined the Infovity team, where I'll continue to help Oracle customers successfully adopt the most innovative, advanced, and complete suite of modern business applications. I chose Infovity specifically based on my experiences with the Infovity team during deal execution, their depth and breadth of Oracle expertise, and ultimately their ability to migrate customers to the Cloud and successfully get their businesses up and running in the Oracle Cloud suite. At Infovity, I'll be able address customers' needs across a vast footprint of functionality, including ERP, HCM, EPM, SCM, CX, BI/Analytics, and any other related integration or PaaS development needs. The team also has deep legacy E-Business Suite and JD Edwards knowledge and we're well-positioned to help those customers look to their future.\n\nWhile in college, cutting my teeth on PHP and mySQL development, I designed and developed a telematics and or fleet monitoring application that helped small transportation companies track and monitor their fleet of vehicles. It tied Microsoft Mappoint in with transceivers that communicated over the Orbcomm satellite network. It was a fun project that helped pay some bills while I was in school. More importantly, the project attracted the attention of a recruiter, and subsequently a hiring manager at Temple-Inland, a Fortune 500 company in Austin.\n\nTemple-Inland was implementing G-log GC3 (later renamed to Oracle Transportation Management) and needed help integrating it into their JD Edwards ERP system. It’s hard for me to imagine that these applications, recently acquired by Oracle, would be part of a foundation laid by the software giant for a vision called Fusion. I also didn't know Oracle would one day deliver enterprise-grade Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These apps provide out of the box capabilities that make my fleet monitoring/telematics application look like a comparison of Pong to Resident Evil 2.\n\nIn 2008, I made my first trip to San Francisco to attend Oracle OpenWorld, where Oracle communicated its vision of Fusion. Although it was murky in 2008, the goal was to assemble the best of the ever-broadening portfolio of applications into a unified suite of applications used to run the world’s largest companies. I was enamored by the grand vision. At the time, I had no idea that I would later play a role its realization.\n\nFast forward to 2015. After almost a decade of helping several companies implement and upgrade JD Edwards software around the globe, I was presented with the opportunity to help take Oracle Fusion applications to market. The hiring manager at Oracle explained that the final large piece of the Fusion vision (now called 'Oracle Cloud') was being released at the end of the year. Oracle needed pre-sales engineers who could help potential customers understand the new supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution capabilities in the Oracle Fusion Application suite R11 release. To be perfectly honest, I had my doubts about the feasibility of something as complicated as Supply Chain being delivered in a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. I knew Salesforce had been successful with CRM and Workday had a good head start on HCM capabilities but Supply Chain? Really? I rolled the dice, took the path not yet traveled, and it made all the difference.\n\nLooking back now, I can proudly exclaim that, of course, it can be done. Oracle did it, and it's brilliant. As of 2019, there are several thousand customers now live on the Oracle Cloud utilizing Supply Chain applications. Finally, the 'Fusion' of Oracle's best intellectual property which it developed and acquired throughout the 1990s is realized. But we're not stopping there. It continues to get better with each quarterly release with the incorporation of analytics, AI, and machine learning.\n\nI won't be surprised when I look back on this post in a few years to see that the world has turned over once again. I’ll still be here helping our customers modernize their way of doing business. It's an exciting time to be in technology and I'm thankful for the opportunities I've been given to help customers achieve their ambitions."
