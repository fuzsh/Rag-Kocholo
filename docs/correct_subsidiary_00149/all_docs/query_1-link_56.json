        "text": "How Do I File a WARN Notice?\n\nWhen letting your employees know of a plant closing or mass layoff, any reasonable method of delivery that ensures receipt of notice at least 60 days before is acceptable. Examples include:\n\nFirst class mail.\n\nPersonal delivery with optional signed receipt.\n\nA notice in your employee’s pay envelope.\n\nNote: A ticketed or preprinted notice regularly included in each employee’s paycheck or pay envelope does not meet the requirements.\n\nYour Local Workforce Development Areas (Local Areas) will help you contact the chief elected officials in those communities affected by the planned layoff or closure.\n\nYou can find your Local Workforce Development Area Administrator in the Local Area listing.\n\nSteps to File a WARN Notice\n\nTo file a WARN notice, email eddwarnnotice@edd.ca.gov. The email must include:\n\nThe name of the employer listed in the subject of the email.\n\nThe notification (as an attachment or within the body of the email).\n\nContact information in case we need more information.\n\nNote: Attachments should be compatible with Microsoft Office or Adobe Reader software.\n\nWhat Happens After an Employer Files a WARN Notice?\n\nWe have Rapid Response Teams to help employers and workers during a mass layoff or plant closing. The Rapid Response Teams are a combined effort between our staff and the Local Area team's services provided locally through America’s Job Center of CaliforniaSM (AJCC).\n\nRapid Response Teams share information about the adult and dislocated worker services available:\n\nUnder Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)\n\nThrough the AJCC\n\nThrough our Unemployment Insurance programs.\n\nIf worker dislocation is the result of foreign competition or foreign relocation, the dislocated worker may be eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program, which can include:\n\nEmployment and case management services\n\nTraining benefits\n\nTrade Readjustment Allowances\n\nJob Search allowances\n\nRelocation allowances\n\nAlternative or Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance\n\nWhat Should I Include in the WARN Notice?\n\nThere is no official form to file a WARN. You can find what must be included in a WARN notice delivered to your employees in Title 20 Code of Federal Regulations Section 639.7.\n\nAll notices must be submitted in writing to us and the chief elected official of the local government. You must include the following:"
