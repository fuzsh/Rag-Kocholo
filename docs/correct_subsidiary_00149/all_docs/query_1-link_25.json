Subledgers are linked to your business unit.object account or business unit.object.subsidiary account.\n\nSubledgers give accounting detail without adding accounts to your chart of accounts. For this reason, subledgers are often used for transaction classifications that are not a permanent part of your chart of accounts, such as detailed travel expenses for account representatives.\n\nSubsidiary accounts are permanent. If you want to track revenues and expenses by account representative using subsidiary accounting, you must create a subsidiary account for each account representative and attach it to each appropriate object account for revenues and expenses. This could mean adding several hundred accounts to your chart of accounts.\n\nYou can use a subsidiary account and a subledger in the same transaction, if necessary.\n\nThese are examples of ways in which subledgers differ from subsidiary accounts:"
