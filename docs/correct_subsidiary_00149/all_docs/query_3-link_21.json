A journey that has helped me collate memorable experiences, geared me up to face challenges, and along the way given me tremendous growth. The joy of building the organisation with close partnership with various business leaders has been very enriching. Huge thanks to my amazing colleagues, managers, my team, mentors, family and friends for their infallible support. Over these years what I have realized and consistently reflect on is alignment of one’s performance to the purpose means aligning the actions with a deeper sense of meaning or mission, creating a connection between what you do and your core identity. Balancing performance and identity through purpose can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful professional journey."
