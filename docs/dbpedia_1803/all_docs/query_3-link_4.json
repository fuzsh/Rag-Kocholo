Its physiologic functions are mediated by five G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) called somatostatin receptor (SST)1–5. These five receptors share common structural features and signaling mechanisms but differ in their cellular and subcellular localization and mode of regulation. SST2 and SST5 receptors have evolved as primary targets for pharmacological treatment of pituitary adenomas and neuroendocrine tumors. In addition, SST2 is a prototypical GPCR for the development of peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. This review article summarizes findings published in the last 25 years on the physiology, pharmacology, and clinical applications related to SSTs. We also discuss potential future developments and propose a new nomenclature.\n\nI. Introduction and Historical Perspective\n\nSince their discovery, research on somatostatin and its receptors has remained active with more than 700 papers published annually. Somatostatin—also known as somatotropin release-inhibiting factor (SRIF)—was originally discovered in 1973 as a hypothalamic neuropeptide based on its ability to inhibit growth hormone (GH) release from the anterior pituitary ( ) (Brazeau et al., 1973). SRIF occurs in two forms, SRIF-14 and SRIF-28, with broad antisecretory activity on many hormones, including GH, insulin, glucagon, gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and ghrelin. In the original report, it was suggested that SRIF could have potential for treatment of acromegaly. However, due to its short circulating half-life (t1/2) (<3 minutes), the therapeutic potential of natural SRIF-14 is limited. Consequently, highly potent and metabolically stable SRIF analogs were synthesized in 1982 (Bauer et al., 1982). The first SRIF analog approved for clinical use was octreotide (Lamberts et al., 1996). About 10 years later, the first SRIF-based radiopharmaceuticals were synthesized by conjugating a chelator to octreotide, followed by radiolabeling with a γ-emitter, which paved the way for in vivo imaging of human tumors (Bakker et al., 1991a,b; Krenning et al., 1993). In the early 1990s, five subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTs) termed SST1 to SST5 were cloned in mice, rats, and humans (Meyerhof et al., 1991, 1992; Bruno et al., 1992; Kluxen et al., 1992; Li et al., 1992; O’Carroll et al., 1992; Yamada et al., 1992a,b, 1993; Yasuda et al., 1992; Rohrer et al., 1993; Panetta et al., 1994; Schwabe et al., 1996; Lublin et al., 1997). Given that only two SRIF tissue binding sites could be identified using ligands available at that time, the subsequent discovery of five different SSTs was surprising and triggered in-depth research into binding properties, localization, and regulation of the ligand. This led to classification of the clinically used SRIF analogs octreotide and lanreotide as SST2-prefering ligands, which in turn stimulated the search for novel compounds that bind either more broadly or more selectively to individual SSTs. In 1996, a structurally related neuropeptide termed cortistatin (CST) with a more restricted distribution in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was identified (de Lecea et al., 1996). In the late 1990s, knockout (KO) mice and selective nonpeptide agonists were developed for all five SSTs, which helped to define their physiologic functions (Zheng et al., 1997; Kreienkamp et al., 1999; Strowski et al., 2003; Tirone et al., 2003; Qiu et al., 2005, 2008; Tallent et al., 2005; Einstein et al., 2010). In 1998, the development of octreotide conjugates radiolabeled with a β-emitter provided proof-of-principle for peptide-receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) (Stolz et al., 1998). A few years later, the capacity of SSTs to form homodimers and heterodimers with other G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) was observed, which stimulated the search for bitopic chimeric compounds (Rocheville et al., 2000a; Pfeiffer et al., 2001, 2002). In the early 2000s, the search for multireceptor ligands led to the discovery of pasireotide, which was the first pituitary-directed drug approved for therapy of Cushing’s disease (Bruns et al., 2002; Colao et al., 2012). In 2008, high-affinity peptide antagonists with utility for SST imaging and treatment were synthesized, suggesting that receptor internalization is not an absolute requirement for tumor imaging (Cescato et al., 2008). Also in 2008, the generation of highly specific rabbit monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) facilitated detection of SSTs in human tissues and enabled correlation of SST2 and SST5 receptor expression with octreotide and pasireotide responses (Fischer et al., 2008; Lupp et al., 2011). Shortly thereafter, development of phosphosite-specific antibodies provided molecular insights into mechanisms for SST activation by octreotide and pasireotide (Poll et al., 2010; Petrich et al., 2013; Lehmann et al., 2016). In 2009, a novel truncated variant of SST5 generated by aberrant splicing was identified [SST5 transmembrane domain (SST5TMD4)] and shown to be overexpressed in several hormone-related tumors, wherein the variant increases aggressiveness (Durán-Prado et al., 2009, 2012b; Gahete et al., 2010a; Hormaechea-Agulla et al., 2017). In the past few years, orally available and subtype-selective SST agonists and antagonists have been synthesized. Some of these substances may become lead compounds for potential new therapeutic indications directed toward individual SSTs (He et al., 2014; Hirose et al., 2017).\n\nII. Endogenous Ligands\n\nA. Somatostatin\n\n1. Somatostatin Gene and Peptide Structure\n\nSRIF, a cyclic neuroendocrine peptide, was first isolated and identified as a hypothalamic factor that inhibited GH secretion from anterior pituitary cells (Brazeau et al., 1973). SRIF exists in two main bioactive isoforms: the tetradecapeptide (SRIF-14) isolated from the hypothalamus and the 28-amino-acid isoform (SRIF-28), generated from the same prepro-SRIF precursor through post-translational processing at a distinct cleavage site and which differs from the shorter isoform by an N-terminal extension ( ) (Esch et al., 1980; Pradayrol et al., 1980; Shen and Rutter, 1984). Both isoforms are expressed at variable amounts in the same tissue areas. It is not clear whether the two peptides are coexpressed by the same cells or by separate cells. The family of somatostatin peptides includes CST, a highly similar peptide reviewed below, and which is structurally and functionally related to the urotensin II peptide family. The two families (somatostatin and urotensin II) as well as those of their respective GPCRs may derive from a single ancestral ligand–receptor pair. The duplication, generating the two families, likely occurred before the emergence of vertebrates. Subsequently, each family expanded during evolution, through whole-genome duplications, followed by local duplications and gene losses (Tostivint et al., 2014). Despite their evolutional divergence, the two families conserve close functional links (Malagon et al., 2008). The vertebrate SRIF family is composed of at least six paralogous genes named SS1 to SS6 (Liu et al., 2010). In mammals, SRIF-14 and SRIF-28 both derive from the SS1 gene, localized on chromosome 3q27.3 in humans. The SRIF-14 primary structure is highly conserved in vertebrates, and cleavage sites generating SRIF-14 and its extended isoform have been fully conserved during evolution (Conlon et al., 1997). An additional product of the mammalian processing of prepro-SRIF is a 13-amino-acid noncyclic amidated peptide, neuronostatin, which immediately follows the signal peptide (Samson et al., 2008; Yosten et al., 2015). Bioinformatic analyses of evolutionary conserved sequences suggest the occurrence of neuronostatin in other vertebrates. A novel peptide showing structural similarity to SRIF-28 and isolated from monkey ileum comprises amino acid sequences matching the N-terminal 13 amino acids of SRIF-28. This peptide is expressed in enteric neurons and may play a possible role in food intake control (Ensinck et al., 2002, 2003).\n\n2. Regulation of Gene Expression and Peptide Release\n\nThe structure of rat and human SRIF genes, as well as the transcriptional unit and upstream regulatory elements of the rat gene, has been characterized (Montminy et al., 1984; Shen and Rutter, 1984). Expression of the SRIF precursor gene is regulated by growth factors and cytokines, including GH, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin, leptin, and inflammatory cytokines, and by glucocorticoids, testosterone, and estradiol. cAMP is a potent activator of SRIF transcription, and SRIF release from neurons and peripheral secretory cells is triggered by membrane depolarization and increased cytosolic calcium concentrations. Several neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, hormones, and nutrients, some also altering gene transcription, affect SRIF release in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral tissues (Montminy et al., 1996; Müller et al., 1999; Patel, 1999; Eigler and Ben-Shlomo, 2014). Characterization of neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and hormone modulation of hypothalamic SRIFergic neurons has raised interest in light of the key role played by SRIF as a distal mediator for neuroendocrine and metabolic control of the GH axis activity in health and disease (Müller et al., 1999).\n\n3. Anatomic Framework\n\nAbundant SRIF immunoreactivity is evident in the mediobasal hypothalamus and median eminence, amygdala, preoptic area, hippocampus, striatum, cerebral cortex, olfactory regions, and the brainstem (Johansson et al., 1984). Three main categories of SRIFergic neurons can be distinguished: hypophysiotropic neurons, long-projecting GABAergic neurons, and GABAergic interneurons acting within microcircuits (Viollet et al., 2008; Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016).\n\nIn the rat CNS, SRIFergic neurons regulating pituitary function are located within the periventricular nucleus and the parvocellular part of the paraventricular nucleus and send axonal projections to the median eminence at the base of the hypothalamus. SRIF-producing neuronal cell bodies are also found in the arcuate (ARC) and ventromedial nuclei. Hypophysiotropic SRIFergic neuronal axons descend toward the pituitary stalk and release SRIF into the portal blood vessel system, thereby reaching anterior pituitary cells. Some axons travel through the neural pituitary stalk into the neurohypophysis. Other fibers project outside the hypothalamus to areas such as the limbic system or may interact, through interneurons, with other hypothalamic nuclei, including the ARC where GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) is expressed, the preoptic nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which exhibits circadian pacemaker activity (Müller et al., 1999; Eigler and Ben-Shlomo, 2014). SRIF is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian brain. Extrahypothalamic SRIF immunoreactivity is found in the amygdala, preoptic area, hippocampus, striatum, cerebral cortex, sensory regions, and brainstem. SRIF neurons are classified into two main categories: interneurons acting locally within microcircuits and long-range–projecting neurons whose fibers reach distant areas. SRIF frequently colocalizes with GABA. SRIFergic interneurons likely play a role in regulation of distal dendrite excitability, and long-range–projecting SRIFergic neurons may participate in coordinating activity between distant brain regions. Accordingly, nonpyramidal cells located in the hippocampus and targeting the medial septum and the medial entorhinal cortex form inhibitory synapses on GABAergic interneurons, and may cooperate in generation and synchronization of rhythmic oscillatory activity in these areas (Viollet et al., 2008; Melzer et al., 2012). Recently, brain-wide SRIF neuron maps have established the precise cell number, density, and somatic morphology with anatomic references for SRIF-related specific functions (Kim et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).\n\nPeripheral SRIF is produced by secretory cells in gastrointestinal mucosa and by δ-cells in pancreatic islets, as well as by a subpopulation of C cells within the thyroid gland. In addition to SRIF-producing neuroendocrine cells, inflammatory and immune response cells and tumor cells may also express SRIF (Patel, 1999). The peptide has been immunolocalized in human epidermis, with low expression levels in keratinocytes and higher expression in subsets of Merkel and dendritic cells (Vockel et al., 2010, 2011). SRIF is a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, an endocrine hormone and a paracrine factor acting in the same tissue where it is expressed. Circulating levels of SRIF are very low because the peptide is rapidly degraded by ubiquitous peptidases (Rai et al., 2015). In the retina, SRIF was detected by immunohistochemical studies in amacrine and ganglion cells, as well as in interplexiform cells, whereas electrophysiological studies support the view that it may function as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, or trophic factor (Cervia et al., 2008).\n\n4. Functions\n\nWithin the hypothalamus–pituitary system, SRIF is the main regulatory element exerting inhibitory control on both basal and stimulated GH secretion and reduces prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in normal subjects (Müller et al., 1999). It can also suppress release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from tumor cells (Hofland et al., 2010). SRIF brain actions are mediated by presynaptic or postsynaptic mechanisms. SRIF modulates neuronal excitability, and in the hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus it also induces presynaptic inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission (Peineau et al., 2003). In other brain areas, SRIF also decreases GABA release. Postsynaptic mechanisms of action include membrane hyperpolarization via activation of potassium ion currents (K+ currents), in particular voltage-gated K+ currents, noninactivating potassium currents (M currents), and voltage-insensitive leak currents (Moore et al., 1988; Schweitzer et al., 1998; Jiang et al., 2003; Qiu et al., 2008). SRIF is coreleased with GABA from hippocampal neurons and from axonal terminals in other brain areas (Olias et al., 2004). SRIF inhibits dopamine release from the midbrain as well as hypothalamic release of noradrenaline, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (Patel, 1999). Activation of brain SRIF signaling may alleviate endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral responses to stress mediated by central CRH and CRH receptors (Stengel and Taché, 2017). SRIF has a role in cognitive functions, learning and memory processes, control of locomotor activity, control of food intake, nociception, and autonomic functions. SRIF is highly expressed in brain regions associated with seizures and has been suggested as an endogenous antiepileptic (Olias et al., 2004; Tallent and Qiu, 2008; Stengel et al., 2015).\n\nPeripheral SRIF actions include inhibition of hormone secretion, exocrine secretion, and cell proliferation. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (GIT), SRIF exerts a generalized inhibitory effect on release of gut hormones [including gastrin, CCK, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, enteroglucagon, motilin], gastric acid, digestive enzymes, bile, and colonic fluid. SRIF also negatively affects gallbladder contraction, small intestinal segmentation, and gastric emptying. In pancreatic islets, release of SRIF from δ-cells inhibits secretion of insulin, glucagon, and other peptides from neighboring cells. SRIF reduces TSH-induced release of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine as well as calcitonin release. In the adrenals, SRIF inhibits angiotensin II–stimulated aldosterone secretion and acetylcholine-stimulated medullary catecholamine secretion. SRIF reduces release of kidney-derived renin caused by hypovolemia and vasopressin-mediated water absorption. In addition to nervous system functions and regulation of endocrine and GI functions, SRIF also may affect key cellular processes in diverse tissues by regulating the release of both growth factors and cytokines as well as cellular responses to these stimuli. SRIF can contribute to control of smooth muscle cell contractility, lymphocyte and inflammatory cell proliferation and activity, tumor cell growth, and normal tissue plasticity (Patel, 1999; Rai et al., 2015). In human skin, SRIF has been suggested as a negative regulator of epidermal wound healing (Vockel et al., 2011). Finally, at variance with its nearly universal inhibitory actions, low (pM) concentrations of SRIF stimulate in vitro GH release on cultured pituitary cells derived from pigs (Luque et al., 2006) and nonhuman primates (Cordoba-Chacon et al., 2012b) and from human somatotroph adenomas (Matrone et al., 2004).\n\nB. Cortistatin\n\nCST, a cyclic neuropeptide, highly homologous to SRIF, was identified as a region-specific brain mRNA encoding a protein of 112-amino-acid residues, which was called preproCST (de Lecea et al., 1996). CST in mammals derives from the CORT gene (Liu et al., 2010). The gene encoding for human and mouse CST is located on 1p36.3–1p36.2 and on chromosome 4, respectively. Similarly to preproSRIF, cleavage of preproCST gives rise to multiple mature products, CST-14 and CST-29 in rats and CST-17 and CST-29 in humans ( ). CST-14 and SRIF-14 differ in three amino acid; CST aligns with the second-amino-acid residue of SRIF on the N-terminus and terminates one-amino-acid residue beyond the C-terminal of SRIF (de Lecea et al., 1997b). Human CST-17 contains an arginine for lysine substitution and is extended by three amino acids at the amino-terminal end, resulting in CST-17 sharing 10 of the 14 SRIF-14 residues. Similar to their prepropeptides, mature CST and SRIF are also highly homologous, including the two cysteine residues that render the peptides cyclic as well as a FWKT motif critical for SST binding (de Lecea et al., 1997b). Consequently, CST peptides bind to all SST subtypes with similar affinity than SRIF, and yet there is no evidence for a selective cortistatin receptor (Siehler et al., 2008). Notably, the FWKT motif is also present in urotensin II and urotensin-related peptide, which are indeed agonists of SSTs (Vaudry et al., 2015).\n\nPreproCST mRNA is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the cortex, mainly layers II–III and VI contain CST-positive cells. Interestingly, CST-positive cell bodies are not uniformly distributed in all cortical areas, with highest numbers evident in the visual and temporal cortex and lowest in the somatosensory cortex (de Lecea et al., 1997a). CST-containing neurons are also detected in the piriform cortex and entorhinal area. In the hippocampus, CST expression is found in a small subset of nonpyramidal neurons of the subiculum and in the stratum oriens of hippocampus subfields Cornu Ammonis (CA)1–3. In the hilar region of the dentate gyrus, however, CST-positive neurons are only transiently present during development (de Lecea et al., 1997a). In parallel, there is a temporary increase of cortical CST expression during development, which correlates with maturation of cortical interneurons. Indeed, cortical CST-expressing neurons, similarly to SRIF-positive neurons, are also GABAergic. However, CST- and SRIF-containing neurons are expressed in distinct, only partially overlapping populations (de Lecea et al., 1997a). CST is also expressed in other brain areas, such as in the olfactory bulb, in the striatum, in the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and in GABAergic interneurons of the deep layers of the spinal cord dorsal horn (de Lecea, 2008; Morell et al., 2013). No CST expression was detected in the thalamus, brainstem, or cerebellum (de Lecea, 2008). The projections of CST-positive neurons were not analyzed in detail, but due to their high homology it is possible that anti-SRIF antibodies may also label CST-containing axons.\n\nCST is also expressed in the periphery, in general at lower level than SRIF but with a broader distribution: preproCST mRNA was detected in peripheral nociceptive neurons, endocrine organs (e.g., pituitary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, endocrine pancreas), digestive system (e.g., stomach, jejunum, ileum, colon, rectum, liver), kidney, lung, and gonads, and also in smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells (e.g., lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells) (Broglio et al., 2007; Gahete et al., 2008; Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2015). Discrepancies between mRNA expression and protein synthesis were observed in several tissues (including adrenal, thyroid, lung, and gonads) (Broglio et al., 2007). Notably, predominant CST is present in parathyroid chief cells and immune cells (Dalm et al., 2003a; Allia et al., 2005).\n\nIn keeping with their similar affinities to SSTs, CST and SRIF share several biologic properties, including inhibition of neuronal activity and consequent antiepileptic activity (Braun et al., 1998; Aourz et al., 2014), inhibition of cell proliferation, and regulation of hormones, and particularly inhibition of GH secretion (Spier and de Lecea, 2000). Double KO mice devoid of both SRIF and CST show markedly increased GH levels, although they do not display overt giant phenotypes (Pedraza-Arevalo et al., 2015). Nevertheless, functional differences of CST and SRIF can only partly be attributed to their distinct tissue distributions (de Lecea and Castaño, 2006). At the cellular level, CST, similarly to SRIF, increases the M current in hippocampal neurons but also augments the hyperpolarization-activated currents (Schweitzer et al., 2003), thereby modulating synaptic integration and regulation of oscillatory activity. At the behavioral level, CST induces hypomotility, whereas SRIF causes hypermotility (Criado et al., 1999); CST enhances slow-wave sleep, whereas SRIF increases rapid eye movement sleep (de Lecea et al., 1996; Bourgin et al., 2007). CST and SRIF also regulate differently endocrine functions (Ibáñez-Costa et al., 2017b) as well as learning and memory processes (Borbély et al., 2013). Consistent with its widespread distribution in the immune system (Dalm et al., 2003b), CST is a potent anti-inflammatory factor, decreasing the production of several inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12, interferon-γ], chemokines, and acute-phase proteins (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2015). CST also inhibits T helper 1- and 17-driven inflammatory responses in models of inflammation [e.g., sepsis (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2006a), atherosclerosis (Delgado-Maroto et al., 2017)], and autoimmune diseases [e.g., inflammatory bowel disease (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2006b), rheumatoid arthritis (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2007), and multiple sclerosis (Souza-Moreira et al., 2013)]. In parallel with its potent anti-inflammatory effect, CST is also an endogenous analgesic factor acting at both the peripheral and spinal level (Morell et al., 2013).\n\nCST may activate GPCRs other than SSTs (Ibáñez-Costa et al., 2017b), including the ghrelin receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) (Callaghan and Furness, 2014) and human-specific MAS-related GPR family member X2 (Solinski et al., 2014). Functions of CST not shared by SRIF in the immune (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2015) and endocrine (Cordoba-Chacon et al., 2011) systems are likely mediated by GHS-R1a, whereas MAS-related GPR family member X2 might play an important role in the analgesic effects of CST in humans. In addition, some CST-specific functions might be mediated by a yet unidentified CST-selective receptor (Gonzalez-Rey et al., 2015), and by truncated SST5 variants that selectively respond to CST (Gahete et al., 2008; Durán-Prado et al., 2009; Cordoba-Chacon et al., 2010, 2011; Ibáñez-Costa et al., 2017b).\n\nIII. Somatostatin Receptors\n\nA. Nomenclature\n\nThere is yet considerable misconception and lack of clarity regarding classification and nomenclature of SSTs. SRIF binding sites were initially defined through radioligand-binding studies performed in rat brain cerebral cortex membranes. SRIF-1 (also called SS-1) recognition sites were characterized by high affinity for SRIF-14 and SRIF-28, and for cyclic peptides such as octreotide and seglitide. In contrast, SRIF-2 (also called SS-2) sites exhibit high affinity for SRIF-14 and SRIF-28, but very low affinity for octreotide and seglitide. In fact, SS-1 and SS-2 binding sites correlate with recombinant SST2 and SST1 receptors, respectively (Hoyer et al., 1995b; Schoeffter et al., 1995).\n\nSubsequently, five distinct receptor genes have been cloned and named chronologically according to their respective publication dates, but two were regrettably given the same appellation (SST4). In 1995, a consistent nomenclature for the recombinant receptors was agreed upon according to International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) guidelines (sst1, sst2, sst3, sst4, and sst5) (Hoyer et al., 1995a). Given that radioligands could differentiate only two distinct SRIF binding sites, the subsequent cloning of five receptors was indeed surprising. IUPHAR guidelines recommended that recombinant receptors without well-defined functional characteristics should be referred to by lower case letters, i.e., sst1, sst2, etc. (Vanhoutte et al., 1996). When the recombinant receptor is shown to be of functional relevance in whole tissues and is fully characterized, upper case letters should be used, i.e., SST1, SST2, etc. (Vanhoutte et al., 1996). Moreover, the name of a receptor should not include the letter “R” or “r” as an abbreviation for receptor (Vanhoutte et al., 1996). Thus, according to IUPHAR guidelines, employing receptor names such as SSTR1, SSTR2, etc., is discouraged (Vanhoutte et al., 1996).\n\nShortly after cloning, it became apparent that the five recombinant receptors comprise two classes or groups, on the basis of their phylogeny, structural homologies, and pharmacological properties. One class was referred to as SRIF1, comprising SST2, SST3, and SST5 receptor subtypes. The other class was referred to as SRIF2, comprising the other two recombinant receptor subtypes SST1 and SST4 (Hoyer et al., 1995a). SST subtypes share many structural characteristics and their main intracellular signaling pathways. Conversely, individual SST subtypes can now clearly be differentiated according to their cellular and subcellular localization as well as distinct modes of regulation and functional and pharmacological properties. The IUPHAR Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification subcommittee now recognizes the physiologic correlates of SSTs and has decided on upper case nomenclature for all five SSTs. Thus, the new recommended nomenclature for SSTs is SST1, SST2, SST3, SST4, and SST5 (Alexander et al., 2017; Schulz et al., 2017).\n\nB. General Properties\n\nAll five SSTs are prototypical class A GPCRs that belong to the rhodopsin-like family of receptors. All possess seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) that provide the characteristic architecture of GPCRs. Receptor sequences for human SSTs range in length from 364 amino acids for SST5 to 418 amino acids for SST3 ( ). Unfortunately, crystal structures are not yet available for any SST. However, the five SST subtypes share common structural features such as a conserved sequence (YANSCANPILY) in transmembrane region 7 (mammalian SST signature). In addition, there is a consensus motif (X-[S/T]-X-Φ) at the end of the carboxyl-terminal tail of all mammalian SSTs. The X-S/T-X-Φ motif is regarded as a potential postsynaptic density protein (PSD)-95/discs large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain binding site crucial for interaction with scaffolding proteins. Like all prototypical GPCRs, SSTs contain a DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (ICL) and are involved in coupling to G proteins. Genes encoding human SST1–SST5 are located on chromosomes 14, 17, 22, 20, and 16, respectively ( ). There is considerable sequence similarity between different SST subtypes (39%–57%) ( ). In fact, sequence similarity is high for a given subtype when compared across species (81%–98% for mouse, human, and rat homologs).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nSST1SST2SST3SST4SST5Gennomic location14q1317q2422q13.120p11.216p13.3Amino acids391369418388364Naturally occurring agonistsSRIF-14, SRIF-28SRIF-14, SRIF-28SRIF-14, SRIF-28SRIF-14, SRIF-28SRIF-14, SRIF-28CST-17, CST-29CST-17, CST-29CST-17, CST-29CST-17, CST-29CST-17, CST-29G protein couplingGαi/oGαi/oGαi/oGαi/oGαi/oPrimary signal transductioncAMP↓cAMP↓cAMP↓cAMP↓cAMP↓VOCC ↓VOCC ↓VOCC ↓VOCC ↓VOCC ↓GIRK↑GIRK↑GIRK↑GIRK↑GIRK↑NHE1↓PTP↑NHE1↓NHE1↓PTP↑PTP↑PTP↑PTP↑Expression in human normal tissueBrainBrainBrainBrainAnterior pituitary Pancreatic isletsAnterior pituitaryAnterior pituitaryRetinaAnterior pituitaryGastrointestinal tractPancreatic isletsPancreatic isletsDorsal root gangliaPancreatic isletsDorsal root gangliaGastrointestinal tractPlacentaGastrointestinal tractGastrointestinal tractLymphatic tissueLymphatic tissueLymphatic tissueAdrenalsAdrenalsAdrenalsExpression in human tumorsaGH-Adenomas NETGH-AdenomasGH-AdenomasGH-AdenomasTSH-AdenomasACTH-AdenomasACTH-AdenomasNETNF-AdenomasNETPheochromocytomasParagangliomasPhenotype of mice lacking receptorAltered insulin homeostasisHigh basal acid secretionImpaired novel object recognitionIncreased seizure susceptibilityIncreased insulin secretionInhibition of glucagon releaseIncreased anxietyBasal hypoglycemiaImpaired motor coordination\n\nTABLE 2\n\nSST1SST2SST3SST4SST5SST110055526949SST274100535356SST369691004856SST482736610053SST564746970100\n\nComparative genomic analysis suggests that the current set of receptors present in mammalian species arose from a single ancestral gene. This precursor was duplicated before the appearance of vertebrates, leading to genes coding for ancestral SRIF1-type and SRIF2-type receptors, and one gene coding for the ligand, SRIF (Ocampo Daza et al., 2012; Tostivint et al., 2014). Further tetraploidizations occurred during vertebrate evolution, generating genes coding for SST2, SST3, and SST5 from the SRIF1-type precursor gene, and genes coding for SST1, SST4, and SST6 from the SRIF2-type precursor gene. The gene coding for SST6 has been lost in mammals, but is identifiable in several fish species. An additional tetraploidization in teleost fish gave rise to even more receptor species (Ocampo Daza et al., 2012; Tostivint et al., 2014). The common ancestor also gave rise to two so-called Drostar receptors in Drosophila (Kreienkamp et al., 2002) that are not activated by known mammalian peptides (including SRIF variants and opioids). However, their endogenous ligand allatostatin C bears only superficial similarity to SRIF. In contrast, the signature motif YANSCANPILY present in mammalian receptors is only slightly modified to YSNSAVNPILY in Drostar1, and the C-terminal PDZ ligand motif found in all SSTs is also present in the fly (Kreienkamp et al., 2002).\n\nGenes encoding SSTs are intronless within their coding sequence, except for SST2. The SST2 gene can be alternatively spliced to produce two receptor proteins, SST2A and SST2B, that differ in length and sequence of their carboxyl termini. Human tissues contain the unspliced SST2A variant exclusively, whereas both spliced forms have been identified in rodents (Vanetti et al., 1992). Although the SST5 gene does not contain CD introns, variants of SST5 mRNA formed by splicing of noncanonical donor and acceptor splice sites are identified in humans, pigs, and rodents (Durán-Prado et al., 2009). The human SST5 variants encode truncated receptors containing five (SST5TMD5) or four (SST5TMD4) transmembrane domains and distinct carboxyl-termini (Durán-Prado et al., 2009).\n\nDespite the prominent therapeutic role of SST2- and SST5-targeting SRIF analogs in pharmacotherapy of endocrine tumors, surprisingly few disease-associated mutations have been identified in any of the seven genes comprising the SRIF system (two peptide precursors and five receptor genes). To date, it has been reported that a single acromegaly patient resistant to octreotide treatment displayed a coding polymorphism in SST5 that clearly affected receptor signaling (Ballare et al., 2001). The R240W mutation presumably disrupts G protein and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, abolishing the antisecretory effects of SRIF on SST5-expressing cells. Besides this unique case, loss of heterozygosity at SST5 was speculated to lead to reduced mRNA expression, but molecular mechanisms for this notion have not been conclusively elucidated (Lania et al., 2008). Although numerous studies have reported reduced SST2 and SST5 expression in treatment-resistant tumors, correlations with any particular polymorphism in SST genes have not been established. Molecular mechanisms underlying low SST expression in octreotide- or lanreotide-resistant tumors must therefore reside in genes outside of the SRIF system and still await identification.\n\nData from large-scale human sequencing studies, such as the exome aggregation consortium (which includes about 60,000 healthy individuals), further show that all five genes coding for SSTs are rather tolerant to sequence variations. In a ranking of about 18,000 human genes based on the presence of missense mutations, the genes coding for SST receptors are placed between positions 1459 (SST1) and 9488 (SST5), where 1 would be the gene that has the lowest tolerance for missense mutations (Lek et al., 2016).\n\nThe best-characterized action of SRIF is its strong inhibitory effect on both endocrine and exocrine cell secretion (Konturek et al., 1976; Dolais-Kitabgi et al., 1979; Mandarino et al., 1981). SRIF also inhibits neuronal excitability. All SST subtypes mediate inhibitory actions by association with Gi/Go proteins, members of the heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide–binding protein family characterized by sensitivity to pertussis toxin (PTX) (Demchyshyn et al., 1993; Gu et al., 1995a,b; Gu and Schonbrunn, 1997; Carruthers et al., 1999). Activation of Gi/Go proteins by SSTs leads to suppression of two critical second messengers: cAMP and cytosolic Ca2+. The reduction in cAMP results from inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. SSTs act to inhibit calcium channels both directly and indirectly, the latter by opening G protein–activated inward-rectifier K channels (Kir3.x) to produce hyperpolarization and, as a consequence, inhibition of Ca2+ influx through voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCC) (Gromada et al., 2001). Reduction of either cAMP or cytosolic Ca2+ leads to inhibition of secretion, and the simultaneous reduction of both second messengers by SRIF results in synergistic inhibitory effects on hormone release. Signaling events responsible for inhibition of cell proliferation are less well understood than those that inhibit hormone secretion. One such pathway involves activation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) (Pan et al., 1992), including the Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP)-1 and SHP-2. Ensuing dephosphorylation of specific substrates may counteract growth factor–stimulated tyrosine kinase activity and thus inhibit multiple mitogenic signaling pathways ( ).\n\nBefore subtype-specific antibodies became available, detailed mapping of receptor mRNA and binding sites had been described and comprehensively reviewed (Epelbaum et al., 1994; Patel, 1999; Dournaud et al., 2000). SSTs are widely expressed in the CNS and the endocrine system with some overlapping distributions, but different cellular and subcellular localizations (Piwko et al., 1996; Thoss et al., 1996a; Lanneau et al., 2000). Within the CNS, SSTs are mainly expressed on neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus (Perez et al., 1994; Perez and Hoyer, 1995; Thoss et al., 1996b; Hannon et al., 2002). In the endocrine system, SSTs are expressed on distinct cell populations in the anterior pituitary, pancreatic islets, adrenals, and neuroendocrine cells of the GIT. SSTs are also expressed on enteric ganglion and immune cells ( ).\n\nAll five SSTs bind the endogenous SRIF and CST ligands with high affinity. Many peptidic SRIF analogs have been developed, leading not only to the discovery of metabolically stable multireceptor SRIF analogs but also to subtype-selective receptor agonists and antagonists. Selective nonpeptide agonists and antagonists are now available for all five SSTs, except SST4, for which selective antagonists are still lacking ( ).\n\nIV. Somatostatin Receptor 1\n\nA. Somatostatin Receptor 1 Structure\n\nHuman SST1 was the first SST cDNA to be cloned by Yamada et al. (1992a). Cloning was accomplished from a pool of GPCR-like sequences amplified from human pancreatic islet RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using a generic set of primers covering highly conserved amino acid sequences in the third and sixth GPCR transmembrane segments (Libert et al., 1989). The mouse homolog was then obtained by screening a mouse genomic library with a human SST1 probe (Yamada et al., 1992a). There is 99% amino acid identity between human and mouse SST1 sequences. Meyerhof et al. (1991) had previously reported the sequence of a rat cDNA encoding a novel putative GPCR expressed primarily in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex, but whose ligand could not be identified. The high identity of the predicted amino acid sequence of this orphan receptor (97% and 98% identity with human and mouse SST1, respectively) indicated that it corresponded to the rat homolog.\n\nIn humans, SST1 is a 391-amino-acid protein encoded on chromosome 14q13 by an intronless gene whose promoter region, transcription start site, and 5′-untranslated region (UTR) have been elucidated ( ) (Redmann et al., 2007). Characterization of rabbit mAbs against SST1 (UMB-7) indicated that the protein is heavily glycosylated, migrating in SDS-PAGE at Mr 45,000–60,000, but displaying the expected mol. wt. of Mr 45,000 after protein extracts had been subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation (Lupp et al., 2013). The gene coding for mouse and rat SST1 is localized on chromosomes 12 C1 and 6q23, respectively, and both encode a 391-amino-acid protein.\n\nB. Somatostatin Receptor 1 Signaling Mechanisms\n\nStudies on SST1 signaling in various cell types have yielded heterogeneous results, depending on whether SST1 is expressed endogenously or heterologously by transfection, indicating that the cellular environment is important in determining the signal transduction machinery. Signal transduction studied in SST1 heterologous cell systems was first thought to be G protein-independent (Rens-Domiano et al., 1992; Buscail et al., 1994), but later shown to involve both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins (Garcia and Myers, 1994; Hadcock et al., 1994; Hershberger et al., 1994; Hou et al., 1994; Patel et al., 1994). Development of a polyclonal antibody to a 15-amino-acid peptide corresponding to a unique sequence in the SST1 carboxyl terminus has made it possible to immunoprecipitate endogenously expressed SST1 from pituitary tumor cell lysates and to demonstrate specific coupling to PTX-sensitive G proteins (Gu et al., 1995a). Gi proteins reported to couple to SST1 in SST1-transfected cells include Giα1,2,3 (Hadcock et al., 1994; Kubota et al., 1994), although only Giα3 dominantly couples SST1 to downstream adenylate cyclase inhibition (Kubota et al., 1994). SST1 transduces reduction of both cAMP accumulation and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in heterologous cell systems ( ) (Garcia and Myers, 1994; Hadcock et al., 1994; Hershberger et al., 1994; Patel et al., 1994), as well as in insulinoma cells expressing SST1 endogenously (Roosterman et al., 1998). All SSTs regulate ion channels, including potassium channels (ATP-sensitive, inward, and delayed rectifying), as recently shown using an elegant fluorescence-based membrane potential assay in pituitary cells (Günther et al., 2016). SST1 activation results in membrane hyperpolarization and subsequent reduction of Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, as demonstrated in endogenously SST1-expressing insulinoma cells (Roosterman et al., 1998). Interestingly, SST1, but not the other SSTs endogenously expressed in the mouse pancreatic β-cell line MIN6, shows exclusive coupling with N-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, resulting in reduced intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and in inhibition of insulin secretion (Smith, 2009). Such SST specificities were also observed in pituitary tumor cells, where, in contrast to SST2, SST1 fails to stimulate phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity or PLC-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Chen et al., 1997), but transduces inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity and arachidonic acid release, similar to SST2 (Cervia et al., 2002). Additionally, SST1 (like SST3 or SST4, but not SST2 or SST5) inhibits sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1) activity via a PTX-independent mechanism, as demonstrated in SST1-transfected cells (Hou et al., 1994), resulting in decreased extracellular acidification (Chen and Tashjian, 1999) that may be involved in inhibition of cell migration by SRIF (Buchan et al., 2002). Hence, SST1, but not SST2, attenuated rat sarcoma (Ras) homolog (Rho)–GTP levels and subsequent Rock activity induced both by GPCR or integrin activation when expressed in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (CCL39), and these inhibitory effects correlated with decreased actin stress fiber assembly and cell migration (Buchan et al., 2002). Interestingly, a reported substrate of Rock is NHE1, which can serve as a plasma membrane-anchoring scaffold for actin filaments to control assembly of cortical stress fibers and focal adhesions. Because Rho inhibition by SST1 is PTX-independent, it may involve activation of Gα12, a trimeric Gα protein reported to inhibit both NHE1 (Lin et al., 1996) and the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115 RhoGEF (Hart et al., 1998). Notably, NHE1 localizes at the invadopodia (membrane structures involved in cell invasion) of human malignant breast carcinoma cells, where it generates extracellular acidification necessary for invadopodial-dependent extracellular matrix degradation and tumor invasion (Busco et al., 2010).\n\nSRIF-induced increase of PTP activity (Hierowski et al., 1985; Liebow et al., 1989; Pan et al., 1992) was shown to be mainly involved in SRIF inhibitory effects on growth factor–stimulated cell growth (Buscail et al., 1994; Florio et al., 1994, 1996). PTP activity was found in a membrane complex containing SRIF and SSTs (Zeggari et al., 1994; Srikant and Shen, 1996). In pituitary tumor cells, SRIF-induced activation of protein phosphatases via PTX-sensitive G proteins (White et al., 1991; Duerson et al., 1996) correlates with endogenous SST1 expression (Florio et al., 1994). The rat membrane-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase η (PTPη) (homolog to human receptor tyrosine phosphatase type J, formerly known as DEP-1) transduces SRIF antiproliferative effects, in both insulin and/or TSH-treated thyroid PC C13 cells (which express all SSTs but predominantly SST1), and in glioblastoma cells (Massa et al., 2004; Barbieri et al., 2008), which express all five SSTs (Mawrin et al., 2004). In SST1-expressing heterologous cell systems, PTP-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation by SRIF was reported to rely on a complex interplay of different PTPs, comprising the receptor-like PTPη, which provides a long-lasting PTP activity (>2 hours), and the cytosolic SHP-2, which is rapidly activated (1–5 minutes) (Arena et al., 2007). SHP-2 and PTPη are sequentially activated in a complex comprising the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) that phosphorylates and activates SHP-2, which in turn activates (by dephosphorylation) the SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (Src) that tyrosine phosphorylates and activates PTPη. The latter phosphatase is directly responsible for SRIF-mediated inhibitory effect on fibroblast growth factor (FGF)–stimulated proliferation through SST1 (Arena et al., 2007). SRIF-activated PTPs inhibit cell proliferation by dephosphorylating tyrosine kinase receptors and/or downstream effectors, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, as demonstrated in SST1-expressing pancreatic cancer–associated fibroblasts (Duluc et al., 2015), or by inducing cell cycle arrest via upregulation of p21 (cip1/Waf1) expression in SST1-transfected cells (Florio et al., 1999). In addition to SST3, SST1 and SST2 blunt FGF-induced nitric oxide production through inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in a PTX-dependent manner (Arena et al., 2005).\n\nC. Somatostatin Receptor 1 Regulation and Trafficking\n\nSequence analyses of the rat Sstr1 gene promoter (Baumeister and Meyerhof, 1998, 2000a) demonstrated presence of putative transcription factor binding sites [GC box transcription factor, specificity protein 1, and activator protein (AP)-2] that are often found in TATA-less promoters (Smale et al., 1990). Presence of binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional factors of the POU domain protein family (Rosenfeld, 1991) was also noted, including sites for pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1 and POU family transcription factor Tst-1 that regulate tissue-specific rat Sstr1 gene expression in the pituitary and in pancreatic β-cells, respectively (Baumeister and Meyerhof, 1998, 2000b). The porcine Sstr1 gene promoter showed positive regulation by cAMP (through a CREBBP1 binding site) (Gahete et al., 2014), consistent with the cAMP-mediated upregulation of SST1 mRNA in rat pituitary primary cultures induced by GHRH treatment (Park et al., 2000), and in pituitary adenomas expressing a mutated Gαs (gsp oncogene) that constitutively activates the cAMP pathway (Kim et al., 2005). SST1 mouse pituitary expression may also be controlled by testosterone because pituitary SST1 mRNA levels are decreased in gonadectomized males but restored upon testosterone injection, and are increased by testosterone treatment in rat pituitary tumor cells (GH4C1 cells) (Xu et al., 1995a; Senaris et al., 1996). Such Sstr1 gene regulation reported in mouse, rat, or pig was also confirmed for the human SSTR1 gene (Redmann et al., 2007). Finally, the SST1 gene promoter contains two CpG islands (Redmann et al., 2007), putatively involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumorigenesis, where hypermethylation of the SSTR1, but also of SRIF, gene has been correlated with reduced disease-free survival (Misawa et al., 2015).\n\nSRIF binding to its receptors results in internalization of receptor–ligand complexes, a critical process for receptor downregulation, resensitization, and signaling (Tulipano and Schulz, 2007). Intriguingly, SST internalization may differ across species, explaining controversial results reported for SST1. In the rat insulinoma cell line 1046-38, which endogenously expresses SST1, a recombinant rat epitope-labeled SST1 was expressed to demonstrate that SST1 endocytosis is observed upon cell treatment with SRIF (Roosterman et al., 1997). This was also confirmed in other rat SST1-expressing heterologous cells (Roth et al., 1997b). Interestingly, ligand-induced rat SST1 trafficking was dynamic, involving endocytosis followed by recycling, and then re-endocytosis of the receptor and of the intact and biologically active ligand, which are not directed to lysosomal degradation (Roosterman et al., 1997). In contrast, other studies showed that human SST1 expressed in heterologous cell systems demonstrates very slow, if any, internalization upon ligand binding (Stroh et al., 2000a; Liu and Schonbrunn, 2001), although it undergoes acute desensitization of adenylyl cyclase coupling that correlates with its phosphorylation status (Hukovic et al., 1996; Liu and Schonbrunn, 2001). Differences in rat and human SST1 internalization may be due to species-specific trafficking. Responsible for this species effect might be an amino acid change at a putative phospho-acceptor site (Thr383-Cys384-Thr385-Ser386) in the rat versus human SST1 C-terminal tail, where human Ser386 has been replaced by alanine in rat SST1. This substitution might explain the reported differences between rat and human SST1 affinity for β-arrestin-1 and subsequent trafficking (Tulipano et al., 2004; Ramirez et al., 2005). Confocal microscopy analyses showed bright immunoreactivity of both human and rat SST1 within the cytoplasm, both receptors accumulating the ligand (SRIF-14) into superficial compartments. Intriguingly, a fraction of SST1 stays clustered immediately beneath the plasma membrane, in as yet unidentified intracellular vesicular compartments (Nouel et al., 1997; Roosterman et al., 1997, 2007; Hukovic et al., 1999). This peculiar localization may be caused by the absence of a domain in the SST1 N terminus required for cell surface targeting, as described for SST3 (Ammon et al., 2002). The SST1 cytoplasmic pool serves as a reservoir for short-term upregulation of human SST1 expression at the membrane upon prolonged agonist treatment. Upregulation depends on phosphorylation events at the SST1 C-terminal tail (Hukovic et al., 1999). SST1 immunoreactivity is observed both at the membrane and in the cytoplasm in primary and heterologous cell models (Gahete et al., 2014), and in paraffin-embedded sections of diverse human tumor tissues, in contrast to SST2, which is predominantly membrane-associated (Hofland et al., 1999; Lupp et al., 2013).\n\nD. Somatostatin Receptor 1 Interacting Proteins\n\nUnlike other SSTs, SST1 is not capable of homodimerization, prevented by structures within the C-terminal domain (Grant et al., 2004). SST1 was nevertheless found heterodimerized with SST5 in SST1- and SST5-coexpressing heterologous cell systems. Heterodimerization is induced by SST5- but not SST1-selective ligands and changes intracellular signaling (inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production) of the SST1/SST5 heterodimer as compared with SST5 homodimers or SST1 monomers (Grant et al., 2004). SST1 was also found heterodimerized with SST2 in prostate cancer cells; this complex stabilized with a bispecific (SST1/SST2) SRIF agonist, which nevertheless was less efficient than a mono-specific SST1 agonist to produce inhibition of cell proliferation (Ruscica et al., 2010). SST1, like other SSTs, harbors within its C terminus a PDZ-binding motif that interacts with membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs, including PSD-95 and PSD-93 (Christenn et al., 2007), or synapse-associated protein SAP-97 (Cai et al., 2008), involved in SRIF signaling to regulate neuronal growth cone stability in neurons (including retraction of filopodia and lamellipodia). Whereas members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homolog subfamily are believed to play a role as molecular scaffolds in the organization of postsynaptic signaling machineries, SAP97 is also prominently expressed in axons and presynaptic terminals, where it may be involved in SST1 presynaptic functions (Cai et al., 2008).\n\nE. Somatostatin Receptor 1 Anatomic Framework\n\nBinding studies using iodinated SRIFs in mice deficient for each of the SSTs suggest that SST2 is most abundant in the murine CNS (Hannon et al., 2002; Videau et al., 2003), although expression of other SST subtypes, including SST1, was confirmed by in situ hybridization in rat brain (Beaudet et al., 1995; Stumm et al., 2004). Immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that SST1 is highly expressed in the hypothalamic paraventricular and ARC, the median eminence (Helboe et al., 1998; Hervieu and Emson, 1998; Stroh et al., 2006), as well as other brain regions, including basal ganglia, basal forebrain regions, and hippocampus (Schulz et al., 2000a). SST1 has also been localized in SRIF-containing amacrine cells of rat and rabbit retina (Dal Monte et al., 2003; Mastrodimou and Thermos, 2004). SST1 immunoreactivity is also intense in the spinal cord, especially in dorsal horn and dorsal medulla (Schulz et al., 2000a). Peripherally, SST1 is expressed in neurons of mouse, rat, and human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Bär et al., 2004; Imhof et al., 2011), and on intestinal mucosal nerve fibers (Van Op den Bosch et al., 2007). Outside the nervous system, high expression of human SST1 mRNA is apparent in stomach, intestine, and endocrine pancreas ( ) (Yamada et al., 1992a). Immunohistochemistry studies later confirmed that the SST1 protein is expressed mainly in these locations and also in the anterior pituitary (Portela-Gomes et al., 2000; Taniyama et al., 2005; Unger et al., 2012; Lambertini et al., 2013; Lupp et al., 2013). SST1 immunoreactivity is also positive in the parathyroid and bronchial glands (Taniyama et al., 2005), testis (staining in single cells between the tubules, resembling Leydig cells), and skeletal muscles (Unger et al., 2012). In the GI tract, SST1 is found expressed in stomach ( ), including antrum and corpus, in single cells resembling neuroendocrine or enterochromaffin-like cells (Unger et al., 2012), although expression in enterochromaffin cells (chromogranin-positive) was not always confirmed (Taniyama et al., 2005). Further SST1 expression was noted in the rectum (Taniyama et al., 2005) and also in enteric ganglion cells and corresponding nerve fibers and nerve terminals (Lupp et al., 2013). SST1 immunoreactivity was also detected in endothelial cells of blood vessels (Taniyama et al., 2005). In the immune system, SST1 protein is expressed in lymphocytes and macrophages (Taniyama et al., 2005), consistent with the positive SST1 immunoreactivity observed in cells resembling macrophages (cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68) positive) in spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus, lung, and gut mucosa, as well as in the stroma of diverse neoplasms (Lupp et al., 2013).\n\nIn neoplastic tissues, receptor autoradiography with SST1 subtype-selective ligands showed preferential expression of SST1 in prostate carcinomas and sarcomas (Reubi et al., 2001). Using the rabbit mAb UMB-7 ( ), SST1 expression was confirmed in prostate adenocarcinomas, rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma, pituitary somatotroph adenomas, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, stomach cancer, urinary bladder cancer, pheochromocytoma, GI neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), breast carcinoma, cervix carcinoma, and ovarian tumors (Lupp et al., 2013). SST1 was abundantly expressed in bronchopulmonary NETs (Herrera-Martinez et al., 2017b) and positively associated with patient survival (Kaemmerer et al., 2015a).\n\nTABLE 3\n\nCloneEpitopeSpecies ReactivityReferenceSST1UMB-7377ENLESGGVFRNGTCTSRITTL391HumanLupp et al.

Somatostatin Receptor 1 Function\n\nIn the CNS, SST1 immunoreactivity is primarily found in fibers and terminals morphologically similar to varicose axons and that exhibit the highest brain SRIF immunoreactivity or are closely apposed by SRIF-immunoreactive fibers. This observation suggests that SST1 is predominantly targeted to presynaptic compartments (Schulz et al., 2000a). In this position it negatively modulates release of SRIF itself or of hypothalamic releasing and release-inhibiting hormones, including GHRH in ARC neurons, where high SST1 mRNA concentrations are found (Tannenbaum et al., 1998). Accordingly, SST1 was defined as an inhibitory autoreceptor located on the mediobasal hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and retina SRIF neurons (Thermos et al., 2006). Negative regulation of GHRH release by SRIF is consistent with the reported SST1 inhibitory role on hypothalamic regulation of GH secretion (Kreienkamp et al., 1999; Lanneau et al., 2000). Intriguingly, gender-related differences in both number and labeling density of SST1 mRNA-expressing cells are observed in the rat ARC (i.e., two- to threefold increase in males versus females) (Zhang et al., 1999). This observation may explain lower basal GH levels in male than in female mammals (Jansson et al., 1985), and also the sexually dimorphic GH pulsatile secretion (Low et al., 2001). More recently, the negative regulation by SRIF of GHRH neuron electrical activity was decrypted using a GHRH–GFP transgenic model (Osterstock et al., 2016). It revealed a sexual dimorphism, which is primarily attributable to a sex-dependent control of GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs by SRIF, rather than intrinsic differences in the GHRH neurons themselves. Interestingly, the positive glutaminergic neurotransmission onto GHRH neurons is an obligatory target of SRIF in female, providing a mechanism for a more tonic inhibition in female than in male, where this inhibitory signal was absent in one-third of animals. Intriguingly, this is the opposite for SRIF inhibition of GABAergic (negative) inputs, being especially robust and synchronized in males. Both SST1 and SST2 are involved in GHRH neuron rhythmicity, but SST1 receptors specifically transduce SRIF inhibitory control of GABAergic inputs, likely taking place at the presynaptic level (Osterstock et al., 2016). Seven percent of neuropeptide Y–positive neurons in the ARC coexpress SST1 mRNA, suggesting a direct interaction between the somatotropic axis and neuroendocrine regulatory loops of energy homeostasis (Fodor et al., 2005). Hypothalamic paraventricular and ARC SST1 may account for prevention of acute stress-induced gut motor functions in mice after central injection of a SST1-selective agonist, including inhibition of gastric emptying and stimulation of colonic motility (Stengel et al., 2011), putatively through central SRIFergic regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) release and downstream stress-induced CRF actions (Stengel et al., 2013). Recently, neuroanatomical connections between somatostatin and kisspeptin neurones were observed in the rat ARC and ventromedial hypothalamus, where one-third of kisspeptin neurones exhibit SST1 immunoreactivity. Because kisspeptin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretagogue, these observations suggest that the regulation of kisspeptin release by SST1 may at least be partly involved in the well-known inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release by SRIF (Dufourny et al., 2018). In the basal ganglia (substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, and ventral pallidum), SST1 is also present presynaptically, where it negatively regulates SRIF release (Vasilaki et al., 2004), strongly suggesting that it may serve as an autoreceptor to modulate systems regulated by SRIF (including dopamine). SST1 (together with SST2) are abundantly expressed in nerve processes of basal forebrain regions, including substantia innominata and the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (Hervieu and Emson, 1998), where SRIF inhibits glutamate release presynaptically through SST1, thereby regulating excitability of forebrain cholinergic neurons (Momiyama and Zaborszky, 2006). Expression and function of SST1 in the rodent hippocampus have been controversial until the demonstration of SST1-mediated SRIF inhibitory action on synaptic transmission, using hippocampal slices of SST1 KO mice and a SST1 selective agonist (Cammalleri et al., 2009). Hippocampal activity is regulated by SST1 through presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release induced by epileptiform treatment. In the spinal cord, SST1 may be involved in nociceptive transmission because dorsal horn and medulla regions coexpress SST1 together with SRIF, which has analgesic effects in rodents and humans (Malcangio, 2003; Imhof et al., 2011). In the peripheral nervous system, SST1 may be involved in inhibitory effects of SRIF on inflammation and nociception (Pinter et al., 2006), such as in mouse models of stress-related visceral nociception (Mulak et al., 2015) or immune-mediated arthritis (Imhof et al., 2011). In the retina, activation of SST1 with a selective ligand decreases SRIF release from retinal explants (Mastrodimou and Thermos, 2004). Surprisingly, loss of SST1 expression in SST1 KO mice results in upregulated SRIF and SST2 retinal expression, together with an enlargement of axonal terminals of rod bipolar cells, where SST2 is expressed, as well as enhanced SST2 function (Bigiani et al., 2004; Pavan et al., 2004). Conversely, in SST2 KO mice, SST1 expression is upregulated and rod bipolar cell axonal terminals are smaller (Casini et al., 2004). This suggests reciprocal inhibitory retinal roles of SST1 on SST2 expression, and vice versa. It certainly contributes to SRIFergic regulation of glutamatergic transmission along the vertical retinal visual pathway in which the SST2/SRIF receptor/ligand pair is probably restrained by SST1, consistent with reported SST1 autoreceptor functions (Dal Monte et al., 2003; Thermos et al., 2006).\n\nIn the periphery, SST1 is expressed, together with SST5 (Strowski et al., 2003), in a high percentage of pancreatic β-cells (Portela-Gomes et al., 2000), consistent with its reported role in regulating insulin secretion in studies using SST-selective agonists or in KO mouse models (Wang et al., 2004; Smith, 2009). In the anterior pituitary, the SST1-selective agonist CH-275 decreases GH secretion in wild-type, but not primary somatotroph cultures derived from SST1-KO mice (Kreienkamp et al., 1999), demonstrating the critical role for SST1 in regulating pituitary GH. SST1 was expressed in endothelial cells of normal human veins and arteries, including atherosclerotic arteries. SST1-selective agonists demonstrated consistent angio-inhibitory effects in vitro (Bocci et al., 2007) and induced vascular relaxation through cytoskeletal alterations (Liapakis et al., 1996), making SST1-specific analogs interesting for treatment of vascular diseases, including intimal hyperplasia. Intriguingly, another study localized SST1 mRNA and SST1 protein to vascular smooth muscle cells, where it showed acute upregulation of expression during vascular trauma coincidently with smooth muscle cell proliferation, making this receptor an interesting target to inhibit myointimal proliferation (Khare et al., 1999). The presence of SST1 in intestinal macrophages and mast cells, especially during inflammation, has been described in mice (Perez et al., 2003; Van Op den Bosch et al., 2007). Low SST1 expression was also found in macrophages differentiated from peripheral bone marrow cell–derived monocytes, where it mediates together with SST2 anti-inflammatory effects after activation by a multireceptor SRIF analog (Armani et al., 2007). During liver inflammation, such as in cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), all five SST mRNAs were expressed, whereas expression was not observed in normal human liver. The specific SST1 agonist L-797,591 was the only SST agonist to inhibit both liver cancer cell and hepatic stellate cell migration, making SST1 agonists putatively interesting to treat liver cirrhosis or HCC (Reynaert et al., 2004). Accordingly, SRIF also reduced production of collagens and inflammatory cytokines by hepatic stellate cells, although the specific receptor subtype was not identified. This putatively explains antifibrotic and immunomodulatory actions of SRIF in the liver (Lang et al., 2005; Reynaert et al., 2005). SST1 was also found uniquely expressed in stellate cells of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and its activation by pasireotide reduced chemoprotective and prometastatic features of these fibroblastic cells by reducing IL-6 and collagen-1 secretion (Duluc et al., 2015; Moatassim-Billah et al., 2016).\n\nSST1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (Sinisi et al., 1997; Kosari et al., 2008) and mediates antiproliferative effects and inhibition of prostate-specific antigen release induced by the SST1-selective agonist BIM-23926 in prostate cancer cell lines (Pedraza-Arevalo et al., 2017). In the thymus, SST1 mRNA is expressed on isolated thymic epithelial cells, where SRIF inhibits proliferation (Ferone et al., 1999). SST1 mRNA is not expressed in fresh human or rat thymocytes (Sedqi et al., 1996; Ferone et al., 2002), but rat thymocyte activation with phytohemagglutinin or IL-1 selectively induced SST1 (Sedqi et al., 1996), suggesting SST1 involvement in thymocyte proliferation and differentiation.\n\nG. Somatostatin Receptor 1 Ligands\n\nThe lack of available SRIF analogs with selectivity for SST1 stimulated the search for such compounds. The first to be identified is CH-275, which harbors a peptidic scaffold with selected amino acid deletions (des-aa1,2,5-SRIF) that in combination with DTrp at position 8, and 4-(N-isopropyl)-aminomethylphenylalanine (IAmp) at position 9, yields des-aa1,2,5-[DTrp8,IAmp9]-SRIF (CH-275), a SRIF agonist with nanomolar affinity for SST1, and that was 30-fold more selective for SST1 versus SST2/4/5 and 10-fold versus SST3, respectively (Liapakis et al., 1996). Using integrated combinatorial chemistry with high-throughput receptor-binding approaches, a SST1-selective nonpeptide compound (L-797,591) ( ; ) displaying agonistic activity with an IC50 of 3 nM was the first pharmacological tool identified for selective SST1 in vitro and in vivo studies (Rohrer et al., 1998). BIM-23926 is a synthetic SST1-selective agonistic peptide (IC50 of 4 nM), reported to decrease cell viability of human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells, as well as to inhibit calcitonin release and cAMP levels ( ; ) (Zatelli et al., 2002). SRA880 is the first reported nonpeptide SRIF SST1 competitive antagonist, with high affinity for both native and recombinantly expressed SST1 from various species ( ; ) (rat, mouse, monkey, human), while displaying low affinity for a range of other neurotransmitter receptors, except the dopamine receptor D4 (Hoyer et al., 2004). The compound is bioavailable and brain penetrant. Consistent with the inhibitory autoreceptor role of SST1, SRA880 administration increases SRIF brain release and signaling, countering depressive-like symptoms in mice (Nilsson et al., 2012). A series of SST1-selective ergoline derivatives has been developed, some of which show effective oral bioavailability and brain penetration (Hurth et al., 2007; Troxler et al., 2008). The only clinically approved SRIF analog showing high affinity for SST1 is pasireotide, a nonselective peptidic compound displaying an IC50 of 9.3 nM for SST1, and IC50 values for SST2, SST3, and SST5 of 1, 1.5, and 0.16 nM, respectively (Schmid, 2008).\n\nTABLE 4\n\nSST1SST2SST3SST4SST5L-797/591a1.4187522401703600BIM-23926b3.6>1000>1000833788SRA880c7.6>1000>1000>1000954\n\nV. Somatostatin Receptor 2\n\nA. Somatostatin Receptor 2 Structure\n\ncDNAs coding human and mouse SST2 were isolated, together with cDNAs coding for SST1, in early 1992 using a polymerase chain reaction–based approach with primers directed to regions conserved in all GPCRs (Yamada et al., 1992a). In the same year, a cDNA encoding for rat SST2 was identified by expression cloning from a rat brain cDNA library (Kluxen et al., 1992). The gene coding human SST2 is localized on chromosome 17q25.1 and consists of two exons. Whereas exon 1 contains only 5′UTR, the entire coding region and 3′UTR are located on exon 2. Genes encoding for mouse and rat SST2 are localized on chromosomes 11 E2 and 10q32.1, respectively. Homology between human and rodent SST2 is 94% (mouse) and 93% (rat) at the amino acid level, respectively. In all three species, SST2 is a 369-amino-acid protein (Mr = 41,305 in humans), displaying typical seven-transmembrane segments and four putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn-9, Asn-22, Asn-29, and Asn-32) ( ). In Western blot experiments, the protein is detected as a characteristic smear migrating between 70 and 80 kDa, in keeping with the assumption that these Asn residues are extensively glycosylated. In addition to this long receptor species, a mouse SST2 splice variant codes for a shortened receptor with an alternative C-terminal tail (termed SST2B) (Vanetti et al., 1992). This variant arises due to removal of a part of the second exon that codes for the C-terminal tail of the long (SST2A) variant, and that also contains some 3′UTR. Some of the remaining 3′UTR of SST2A then becomes the coding region in SST2B mRNA; in contrast to SST2A, the C-terminal sequence of SST2B is very poorly conserved between species. Several functionally relevant elements of the SST2A C terminus are lost due to the alternative splicing event: 1) elimination of phosphorylation sites that contribute to agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization and 2) SST2A contains a C-terminal consensus motif for binding PDZ domains (Zitzer et al., 1999), which is not present in in SST2B. Whereas both spliced forms have been identified in rodents (Vanetti et al., 1992), human tissues exclusively contain the unspliced SST2A variant. Consequently, we use the denomination SST2 for the long unspliced SST2A variant throughout this review.\n\nB. Somatostatin Receptor 2 Signaling Mechanisms\n\nSignaling properties of SST2 have been investigated in several heterologous expression systems, or in endogenous SST2-expressing cells using SST2 agonists. As physiologic actions of SRIF (e.g., on GH release) are sensitive to PTX (Cronin et al., 1983), unsurprisingly, SST2 also acts mostly through PTX-sensitive G proteins of the inhibitory/olfactory family of Gα subunit (Gi/o) type (Law et al., 1993), as reported in cultured mammalian cells heterologously expressing SST2, such as CHO, human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells, or SV4-transformed fibroblast-like derived monkey kidney (COS-7) cells. Major effects of SST2/Gαi/o signaling are inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, and activation of Kir3.x ( ) (Kreienkamp et al., 1997). The inability of SRIF-bound SST2 to inhibit cAMP production in some cell lines (e.g., Law et al., 1993) was ascribed to lack of expression of an appropriate G protein (Hershberger et al., 1994). All of these effects are complementary for the inhibition of excitable cells, such as neurons or hormone-secreting cells. Thus, whereas hormone secretion by pituitary cells is driven by Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, activation of potassium channels by SRIF-activated SST2 hyperpolarizes the membrane and prevents depolarization induced by hypothalamic releasing hormones. In pituitary cells, SST2 activates PLC [more specifically the PLC-β3 isozyme (Kim et al., 2012), which is partially blocked by PTX, putatively involving a Gαq/11 (Chen et al., 1997) and/or Gβγ protein (Kim et al., 2012)]. This results in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate formation and Ca2+ release into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum, regulating the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (Kim et al., 2012).\n\nBesides these canonical G protein–mediated signaling pathways, SST2 also activates tyrosine phosphatase activity, associated with reduced serum-stimulated cell proliferation (Buscail et al., 1994; Reardon et al., 1997). This effect has been replicated in several cell types either overexpressing the receptor, or expressing lower endogenous levels of SST2 (Dent et al., 1997; Barbieri et al., 2008). Activation of tyrosine phosphatases by SRIF is PTX-sensitive and can be mimicked by addition of Gαi/o subunits purified from brain (Dent et al., 1997), implicating this G protein in the SST2-initiated signaling pathway. The nonreceptor tyrosine protein phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, respectively, have emerged as major effectors (Lopez et al., 1997; Reardon et al., 1997), being copurified with SST2 (or SSTs in general) in heterologous cell systems, and sequentially activated, dependent on G protein (Gαi3 and Gβγ) and Src activity (Lopez et al., 1997; Ferjoux et al., 2003). Through phosphatase activation, SST2 inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation events such as those following activation of tyrosine kinase receptors (Bousquet et al., 1998; Hortala et al., 2003). This leads to cell cycle arrest and subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation, through upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/Kip1 (Pagès et al., 1999) and the zinc finger protein (Zac1) (Theodoropoulou et al., 2006), as mainly demonstrated in heterologous cell systems (Pagès et al., 1999; Grant et al., 2008). Furthermore, similar results were obtained using SST2-preferring or selective analogs in endogenously SST2-expressing cells [e.g., pituitary tumors (Ferrante et al., 2006; Hubina et al., 2006; Theodoropoulou et al., 2006; Horiguchi et al., 2009; Peverelli et al., 2017), insulinoma (Aoki et al., 2014), glioma (Barbieri et al., 2009), normal and tumoral pancreatic acinar cells (Charland et al., 2001), or thyroid cells (Medina et al., 1999)]. This involves regulation of several signaling pathways, including Ras/Raf/ERK (Dent et al., 1997; Lahlou et al., 2003), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase 3β/mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) (Bousquet et al., 2006; Theodoropoulou et al., 2006; Azar et al., 2008), p38 (Alderton et al., 2001), neuronal NOS (Lopez et al., 2001), and JAK2 (Hortala et al., 2003). Depending on phosphatase activity, SST2 activation also triggers apoptosis in endogenous SST2-expressing pituitary somatotroph tumor cells (Ben-Shlomo and Melmed, 2010), and also in pancreatic cancer cells engineered to express this receptor, where apoptosis is further stimulated by treatment with death ligands (Ben-Shlomo and Melmed, 2010). Finally, SST2-induced dephosphorylation events can also lead to inhibition of cell migration and invasion, through inhibition of the small G protein Rac and of the subsequent ruffle formation in endogenous SST2-expressing neuroblastoma cells (Pola et al., 2003). In addition, SST2-induced dephosphorylation events can lead to restoration of cell-to-cell (adherens and gap junctions) and cell-to-matrix (hemidesmosomes) contacts in SST2-transfected pancreatic cancer cells (Benali et al., 2000; Lahlou et al., 2005; Laval et al., 2014).\n\nC. Somatostatin Receptor 2 Regulation\n\nSimilar to genes encoding the other SSTs, genes coding SST2 from various species do not contain TATA and CAAT boxes (Greenwood et al., 1995). A minimal promoter fragment close to the transcription initiation site was identified as a novel initiator element sufficient to account for transcription from the SST2 promoter in neuroblastoma cells (Pscherer et al., 1996). Interestingly, a so-called enhancer box was identified in this region, which serves as a binding site for the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (SEF-2). Interaction of SEF-2 with the enhancer box was identified as a major driving force for activity of the promoter in several cell lines (Pscherer et al., 1996). Transcriptional activity is further enhanced by the binding of c-myc intron binding protein 1 (MIBP1), both to SEF-2 and to a thymine-cytosine–rich transcriptional enhancer element; the expression pattern of MIBP1 matches that of SST2 in the murine brain, suggesting that MIBP1 confers expression tissue specificity at least in the CNS (Dorflinger et al., 1999). In addition, negative regulatory elements have been identified in more distal regions of the promoter of the mouse Sstr2 gene. Suppression of transcriptional activity by this region may be overcome by Smad3/Smad4, which plates the activity of the Sstr2 gene under control of a transforming growth factor β–dependent signaling pathway (Puente et al., 2001). Finally, and relevant for tumors that escape SST2-mediated antiproliferative effect of SRIF and its analogs, an alternative 5′/upstream promoter was identified that may be silenced by methylation (Torrisani et al., 2008). High methylation levels in this region correlated with reduced SST2 expression in tumor cells (Shen et al., 2016).\n\nRegulation of SST2 depends upon molecular mechanisms, implying phosphorylation events at the C-terminal tail followed by recruitment of β-arrestins and receptor endocytosis. Combined biochemical and mutagenesis approaches identified serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal tail of the SST2 that are phosphorylated upon SRIF and/or octreotide stimulation, namely, S341, S343, S348, T353, and T354 in rat SST2-transfected CHO and GH4C1 cells (Liu et al., 2009), and S341, S343, T353, T354, T356, and T359 in HEK293 cells stably transfected with rat or human SST2 (Nagel et al., 2011; Lehmann et al., 2014b). Agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the four threonine residues was also documented in rat pituitary tumor cells (GH3) transiently transfected with rat SST2, rat pancreatic insulinoma β-cells (INS1 cells), which endogenously express SST2, and rat pancreas in vivo (Poll et al., 2010). Although rat SST2 internalization was partially inhibited by mutation of threonine residues, none of the mutations resulted in a complete block of receptor internalization (Liu et al., 2008). By contrast, multisite phosphorylation of clusters of carboxyl-terminal serine and threonine residues of the human SST2 cytoplasmic tail is a critical event for receptor endocytosis (Lehmann et al., 2014b). Accordingly, in a SRIFoma, which synthesized and secreted SRIF and in which SST2 are localized intracellularly, receptors are phosphorylated, whereas in an ileal carcinoid tumor in which SST2 are membrane-bound, receptors are found nonphosphorylated (Liu et al., 2003). In human NET samples, SST2 phosphorylation is observed only in octreotide-treated patients and receptors are internalized, whereas in untreated tumors SST2 are not phosphorylated and are located at the cell membrane (Waser et al., 2012). Of note, unlike SRIF and octreotide, pasireotide (formerly known as SOM230) stimulates only phosphorylation of S341 and S343 residues of human SST2, followed by a partial receptor internalization (Lesche et al., 2009; Lehmann et al., 2014b). In cell lines, G protein–coupled receptor kinase (GRK2) (Liu et al., 2009) or GRK3 is involved in phosphorylation of S341 and S343 residues (Nagel et al., 2011), whereas the threonine residues (T353, T354, T356, and T359) are phosphorylated by GRK2 and GRK3 (Poll et al., 2010). In HEK293 cells stably expressing SST2, chemical protein phosphatase inhibitors and small interfering RNA knockdown screening lead to identification of protein phosphatase 1β (PP1β) as the GPCR phosphatase that catalyzes rapid dephosphorylation of residues T353, T354, T356, and T359 (Poll et al., 2011).\n\nSST2B terminates after residue 332 and therefore does not contain the phosphorylation sites identified in the C-terminal tail of SST2 (Cole and Schindler, 2000). Accordingly, SST2B phosphorylation is not detectable after agonist stimulation of colonic adenocarcinoma cells, whereas SST2 is phosphorylated under the same conditions (Holliday et al., 2007). SRIF causes rapid desensitization of SST2, but not of SST2B, in this latter cell type. However, both receptor subtypes desensitized markedly in transfected CHO cell line subclone K1 (CHO-K1) cells (Cole and Schindler, 2000). Interestingly, phosphorylation in the third ICL of SST2, a sequence shared by the SST2B variant, also occurs (Hipkin et al., 2000; Elberg et al., 2002), but does not play a role in internalization and desensitization (Lehmann et al., 2014b). Differences in receptor phosphorylation might be physiologically relevant in the rodent brain and the GIT, where different expression patterns of the two SST2 subtypes have been documented (Cole and Schindler, 2000).\n\nThe relationship between SST2 phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding, a major class of adaptor proteins involved in GPCR desensitization and internalization, has been investigated in different cell lines. In HEK293 (Tulipano et al., 2004) and CHO cells (Liu et al., 2005), or primary hippocampal neurons (Lelouvier et al., 2008), cotransfected with β-arrestin enhanced green fluorescent protein and the rat SST2, both β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 are recruited to the plasma membrane after agonist stimulation, form stable complexes with the receptor, and internalize together. β-arrestin-2 recruitment also occurs after agonist stimulation of human SST2 in HEK293 cells (Lehmann et al., 2014b). Together, these results suggest that the SST2 belongs to the class B GPCR subgroup, because its activation results in robust recruitment of both β-arrestin-1 and -2 (Oakley et al., 2000).\n\nD. Somatostatin Receptor 2 Trafficking\n\nStudying SST trafficking has received increasing attention because the fate of internalized receptors, following agonist exposure, may vary from degradation to rapid recycling to the plasma membrane, thereby affecting responsiveness to endogenous ligands and drugs of therapeutic interest. A striking SST2 property is that in the vast majority of the cell types endogenously expressing this subtype, it is almost exclusively confined to the plasma membrane, such as in central and myenteric neurons, neuroendocrine cells of the gastric antrum (Gugger et al., 2004; Fischer et al., 2008), anterior pituitary (Fischer et al., 2008; Peineau et al., 2014), pancreatic islets, as well as central and peripheral tumors (Reubi et al., 2000b). However, intracytoplasmic SST2 localization was observed in CNS in regions exhibiting dense SRIF innervation such as the central nucleus of the amygdala (Dournaud et al., 1998). Intracellular localization was also described in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in cerebrocortical neurons adjacent to the infarct, which regionally correlates with transient SRIF depletion from axonal terminals (Stumm et al., 2004). Subcellular distribution of the receptor may be dependent on surrounding SRIF concentrations, as suggested in tumors of the nervous and neuroendocrine systems (pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas) producing autocrine SRIF (Reubi et al., 2000b). Collectively, these studies highlight that SRIF released under physiologic or pathophysiological conditions regulates localization and trafficking of SST2 consistent with results obtained in cell lines (Csaba and Dournaud, 2001; Tulipano and Schulz, 2007; Jacobs and Schulz, 2008; Treppiedi et al., 2017). In hippocampal neuronal cells, SST2 trafficking was analyzed in detail at different times after acute intracerebral octreotide injections or in primary neuronal culture exposed to SRIF ligands (Csaba et al., 2001, 2007; Lelouvier et al., 2008; De Bundel et al., 2015). These experiments demonstrated for the first time that GPCR cargoes recycle through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) after endocytosis. After activation and internalization, endosomes bearing SST2 in dendrites (by far the major pool of SST2) and cell bodies fuse and migrate to a perinuclear compartment expressing trans-Golgi markers such as the integral protein of the TGN, TGN38, and syntaxin-6, but not cis-golgi markers such as cis-Golgi marker 130 (GM130). These results have been comfirmed in vivo by electron microscopy approaches that showed that SST2 cargoes were not targeted to degradative departments; rather, TGN-enriched receptors recycle to the plasma membrane (dendrites and cell bodies), where they are observed in preagonist challenge equivalent amounts. The recycling process, which depends on the length and extension of dendritic arborization, is slow, 3–6 hours in vitro and 24–48 hours in vivo. Differences in kinetics between in vivo and in vitro studies might be, at least in part, due to the persistence of the intracerebrally injected agonist, which cannot be removed or chased as in in vitro settings, implying several internalization/recycling cycles before total agonist clearance or degradation. Such trafficking of activated SST2 to the TGN was also reported in myenteric neurons, in which an intact TGN is necessary for receptor recycling (Zhao et al., 2013). In both DRGs and dorsal horn neurons, octreotide-activated SST2 in vivo also are observed to concentrate in perinuclear regions that resemble the TGN before recycling (24 hours) (Shi et al., 2014). The physiologic significance of this peculiar recycling pathway is not fully understood. Recycled receptor might undergo biochemical modifications and/or association with scaffolding proteins for proper delivery to the cell surface. An additional intriguing hypothesis is that SST2 targeted to the TGN could produce downstream cellular responses, such as coupling to different G proteins, as demonstrated for other GPCRs, the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (Mullershausen et al., 2009), and the TSH receptor (Calebiro et al., 2009).\n\nRecently, studies have focused on factors involved in regulation of intracellular SST2 trafficking. Modulating recycling of a particular receptor can indeed impact its physiologic fate and therefore offer a potential therapeutic value. Using pharmacological and cell biologic approaches, it was demonstrated that leucyl-cysteinyl aminopeptidase (LNPEP; formerly known as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase) ligands accelerate recycling of internalized SST2 in neurons in vitro or in vivo (De Bundel et al., 2015). LNPEP, which shares common regional and subcellular distribution with internalized SST2, was shown to be involved in vesicular trafficking (Wright and Harding, 2011). Importantly, because LNPEP ligands increase the density of SST2 at the plasma membrane, they also potentiate SRIF-inhibitory effects on seizure activity (De Bundel et al., 2015). LNPEP therefore represents a therapeutic target for treatment of limbic seizures and possibly for other neurologic conditions in which downregulation of GPCRs occurs. In myenteric neurons, activated SST2 traffic to endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1)–containing vesicles and TGN (Zhao et al., 2013). This endosomal peptidase degrades peptide ligands in intracellular organelles and promotes receptor resensitization (Roosterman et al., 2007). SST2 recycling (30 minutes) in myenteric neurons is dependent upon endosomal acidification, ECE-1 activity, and an ECE-1 cleavable ligand, which is the case for SRIF-14, but not for SRIF-28 or analogs, such as octreotide (Zhao et al., 2013). Hence, after activation by ECE-1–resistant SRIF-28 and analogs, SST2 remain within the TGN and are poorly recycled at 120 minutes. Assuming that SST2 signals in intracellular organelles, this could explain, at least in part, the long-lasting actions of SRIF analogs such as octreotide. Of note, although ECE-1 might be present in the hippocampus (Barnes et al., 1997), the kinetics of SST2 recycling were the same after activation by SRIF-14 or octreotide in hippocampal neurons (De Bundel et al., 2015), suggesting that the ECE-1 role on SST2 recycling is dependent upon cell types. Filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein involved in intracellular trafficking of several transmembrane proteins (Onoprishvili et al., 2003; Noam et al., 2014), has been shown to interact with the SST2 in melanoma and pancreatic cell lines (Najib et al., 2012). FLNA appears crucial for SST2 stabilization and signaling at the plasma membrane (Peverelli et al., 2014; Vitali et al., 2016). In addition, FLNA may protect SST2 from degradation by facilitating targeting of the receptor to a recycling pathway during long-term agonist treatment of pancreatic tumor and GH-secreting tumor cells (Peverelli et al., 2014; Vitali et al., 2016).\n\nE. Somatostatin Receptor 2 Interacting Proteins\n\nInterestingly, all SST subtypes (SST1–SST5; with the exception of the short-splice variant SST2B) contain a consensus motif for interaction with type I PDZ domains at the intracellular C termini. This motif is conserved throughout evolution, as the closest homologs of SSTs in Drosophila, the Drostar1 and Drostar2 receptors for type C allatostatins, also contain a PDZ ligand motif (Kreienkamp et al., 2002). In contrast, closely related opioid receptors are devoid of such a motif. In its simplest form, a type I PDZ ligand consists of the C-terminal sequence –S/T–X–φ–COOH, in which φ is a large hydrophobic residue (Phe in SST4; Ile or Leu in SST1, 2, 3, 5; Val in many other typical PDZ ligand motifs). Whereas such a motif is quite common, flanking sequences add to the specificity of PDZ-type interactions (Zeng et al., 2016), thus ensuring that not every PDZ ligand can interact with any PDZ domain. SST2 was the first SST for which an interaction with a PDZ domain–containing protein was reported; Zitzer et al. (1999) identified members of the Shank protein family as potential interactors through yeast two-hybrid screening (Zitzer et al., 1999). Shank proteins are important scaffold proteins of the PSD. They exhibit a complex domain structure, as the central PDZ domain is accompanied by a Ras association domain, a set of seven ankyrin repeats, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM domain) and a nuclear localization signals 1 domain. In addition, a long proline-rich stretch is involved in binding actin-binding proteins. In the PSD, Shank proteins are considered as master scaffold proteins that link receptor complexes to the actin-based cytoskeleton (Kreienkamp, 2008). As SST2 does not appear to be a postsynaptically enriched receptor, it appears likely that interactions between Shank proteins and SST2 are relevant at other, nonsynaptic sites. In further studies, PDZ domain–containing 1 (PDZ-K1) protein was identified as interaction partner for all SST subtypes, including SST2. As PDZ-K1 also interacts with a PLC isoform, this work suggests that PDZ-K1 allows for coupling of SST subtypes to PLC through ternary complex formation. Finally, C-terminal PDZ ligand motifs of a larger number of membrane proteins have been shown to promote postendocytic recycling through binding to the PDZ domain containing sorting nexin family member 27 (Steinberg et al., 2013), and the PDZ ligand of SST2 may also promote similar recycling.\n\nAdditionally, SST2 harbors two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) sequences (immunoreceptor tyrosine–based inhibitory motif: I/V/L/S-x-Y-x-x-L/V), present in the third ICL and C-terminal tail (Ferjoux et al., 2003). Such ITIM consensus sequences were initially found in inhibitory immunoreceptors (e.g., programmed cell death protein 1), triggering B cell receptor inhibition of SHP-2 recruitment, and subsequent dephosphorylation of B cell receptor effector molecules (Okazaki et al., 2001). Similarly, SRIF-induced phosphorylation of SST2 tyrosine 228 and 312 residues, present in each of the two SST2 ITIMs, triggers SHP-2 (but not SHP-1) direct recruitment to SST2, SHP-2 activation, and subsequent transduction of dephosphorylation events also involving the kinase Src and SHP-1, leading to cell proliferation inhibition (Ferjoux et al., 2003).\n\nThe first SST2 ICL contains two juxtaposed binding sites for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and for the actin-binding and scaffolding protein FLNA (Bousquet et al., 2006; Najib et al., 2012). Depending on SST2 phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 66 and 71, present in FLNA and p85 binding sites, respectively, FNLA or p85 competitively binds to SST2 first ICL. In the absence of SRIF, these tyrosine residues are phosphorylated, enabling p85, but not FLNA, binding. This state is permissive for growth factor–induced activation of PI3K activity. In the presence of SRIF, SST2 tyrosine residues 66 and 71 are dephosphorylated, enabling FLNA, but not p85 binding, the dissociation of which from SST2 triggers PI3K inactivation. One hypothesis is that SHP-2 binding to SST2, induced by SRIF through ITIM phosphorylation on SST2 third ICL and C-terminal domain (Ferjoux et al., 2003), triggers dephosphorylation of FLNA and p85 binding sites in SST2 first intracellular domain. Alternatively, the scaffolding FLNA protein, once recruited onto SST2 in the presence of SRIF (Najib et al., 2012), brings SST2 in proximity to the phosphatase SHP-1, whose activity is critical to trigger SRIF-inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, migration, or invasion. Both rat and human SST2 form constitutive homodimers (Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Lehmann et al., 2016). The dynamics of ligand-induced trafficking have also been studied for pig SST2 (Durán-Prado et al., 2007). This receptor forms constitutive homodimers/multimers in the absence of ligand, which rapidly dissociate (11 seconds) upon SRIF binding. Interestingly, in contrast to human SST2, pig SST2 rapidly reassociates (110.5 seconds) during a subsequent process that temporally overlaps with receptor internalization (half-maximal 95.1 seconds) (Durán-Prado et al., 2007). When coexpressed heterologously, SST2 and SST3 form heterodimers with reduced SST3 activity (Pfeiffer et al., 2001). However, to what extent SST2 forms dimers or oligomers with other GPCRs in vivo is not known.\n\nF. Somatostatin Receptor 2 Anatomic Framework\n\n1. Central and Peripheral Nervous System\n\nTwo independent laboratories using two different antibodies directed toward the carboxy-terminal tail of the SST2 have demonstrated that this SST subtype is the most abundant SST in the rodent CNS (Schindler et al., 1997; Dournaud et al., 1996) in agreement with both in situ hybridization experiments and autoradiographical studies using SST2-preferring ligands. Strong SST2 labeling is detected in the deep layers of the cerebral cortex, CA1 field, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, lateral septum, medial septum/diagonal band of Broca, medial habenula, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, endopiriform nucleus, claustrum, amygdaloid complex, locus coeruleus, and nucleus tractus solitarius. In the hypothalamus, the highest densitiy of SST2 immunoreactivivity is located in the ARC and the medial tuberal nucleus as well as in the lateroanterior nucleus and the ventrocaudal part of the tuber cinereum (Csaba et al., 2003). In the rat spinal cord, SST2 neurons are localized in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn (Schindler et al., 1997, 1998a; Schulz et al., 1998b,c; Segond von Banchet et al., 1999) often closely apposed by SRIF-immunoreactive terminals (Schulz et al., 1998b). In the rat retina, several neuronal cell types express SST2. In the outer layers, immunoreactivity is localized to cone photoreceptors, horizontal cells, and rod and cone bipolar cells. In the inner layers, SST2 immunostaining is present in numerous medium- to large-size amacrine cells (Johnson et al., 1999). Regional distribution of SST2 immunostaining in the human CNS is generally congruent with that reported for the rat, although, in contrast to rodents, human cerebellum displayed significant SST2 immunostaining (Schindler et al., 1998b; Csaba et al., 2005; Shi et al., 2014).\n\nIn the rat peripheral nervous system, medium-size neurons distinct from those expressing SRIF display SST2 in the DRG (Schulz et al., 1998b). In the human and rat GIT, SST2 are localized in neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, and in fibers distributed to the muscle, mucosa, and vasculature (Sternini et al., 1997; Reubi et al., 1999).\n\nImmunohistochemical experiments have examined localization of SST2B (Schulz et al., 1998a; Schindler et al., 1999). In the rat brain, somatodendritic labeling is evident in several regions that also exhibit SST2 immunostaining, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, septal nuclei, and superior colliculi. In contrast to SST2, the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum appears to be SST2B immunoreactive. In the rat spinal cord, whereas the SST2 is confined to the superficial layers, SST2B is located in neuronal perikarya and proximal dendrites throughout the gray matter of the spinal cord (Schulz et al., 1998a).\n\n2. Pituitary\n\nUsing specific antibodies against SST2, it appears that this receptor is largely distributed in the adult rat and human pituitary ( ) (Mezey et al., 1998; Peineau et al., 2014). Although all anterior pituitary cell types express the SST2 protein, GH-expressing cells almost completely colocalize with the SST2, whereas 50% of gonadotrophs, 60% of corticotrophs, 30% of thyrotrophs, and 10% of prolactin cells exhibit SST2 immunoreactivity (Peineau et al., 2014). Of note, some discrepancies with distribution of the mRNA exist because the SST2 mRNA was previously found in 40% of somatotrophs, 36% of thyrotrophs, 26% of lactotrophs, 3% of corticotrophs, and 8% of gonadotrophs (Day et al., 1995).\n\n3. Peripheral Organs\n\nImmunohistochemical studies also revealed the presence of the SST2 in striated ducts of the parotid gland, in neuroendocrine and enterochromaffin-like cells of the GI mucosa, in enteric ganglia, in insulin- and glucagon-secreting cells of the pancreas ( ), in the reticular zone of the adrenal cortex, in glomeruli and tubules of the kidney, in luteinized granulosa cells of the ovary, in basal parts of testicular tubules, in granulocytopoietic cells of the bone marrow, in alveolar macrophages of the lung, and in germinal centers of lymph follicles (Fischer et al., 2008; Lupp et al., 2011; Unger et al., 2012; Stollberg et al., 2016). All in all, SST2 was the most frequently detected SST subtype, and, in most cases, SST2 predominantly immune-stained at the cell plasma membrane.\n\n4. Tumors\n\nAs determined using the rabbit mAb UMB-1, SST2 also represents the most prominent SST subtype in tumor tissues, with only few exceptions, such as pituitary adenomas (Fischer et al., 2008). In somatotroph and thyrotroph pituitary adenomas, SST2 is present at high abundance in >80% of tumor specimens, along with a high presence of SST5. In contrast, in gonadotroph, corticotroph, and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas where SST2 expression was low or even absent, a preponderance of SST3 or SST5 has been noted (Fischer et al., 2008; Lupp et al., 2011). In brain tumors, the prevalence of SST2 was highest. SST2 was present in most of "
