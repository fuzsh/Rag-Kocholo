To prevent genital ambiguity, in girls, prenatal dexamethasone treatment is administered early in the first trimester. Prenatal genetic diagnosis of CAH and fetal sex determination identify affected female fetuses at risk for genital virilization. Advancements in prenatal diagnosis are owing to improved understanding of the genetic basis of CAH and improved technology. Cloning of the CYP21A2 gene ushered in molecular genetic analysis as the current standard of care. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis allows for targeted treatment and avoids unnecessary treatment of males and unaffected females. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Prenatal ultrasonography may show fetal alterations, but they are not pathognomonic and most of them are frequently detectable only from the 20th week of gestation. Nevertheless, early diagnosis is important to avoid neonatal complications and make timely and informed decisions about the pregnancy. We report on four fetuses from two unrelated families, in whom the application of whole exome sequencing and array-CGH allowed the identification of GPC3 alterations causing SGBS. The careful follow up of pregnancies and more sophisticated analysis of ultrasound findings led to the identification of early prenatal alterations, which will improve the antenatal diagnosis of SGBS.

We reviewed all consecutive cases referred for an anechoic abdominal cyst from 2009 to 2013. Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis was compared with postnatal diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis was defined as 'correct' if a specific prenatal diagnosis or one of the possible diagnoses was confirmed postnatally, as 'not confirmed' if the postnatal examination revealed no abnormalities and as 'incorrect' if the postnatal diagnosis was different from those suggested prenatally. Seventy-three cases were included, and prenatal diagnoses were made at a median gestational age of 27âweeks (range: 13-36). Correct diagnoses were made in 66 cases (90.4%), including four in which the lesion resolved spontaneously in utero; two diagnoses were 'not confirmed' postnatally, and one was incorrect (a prenatal diagnosis of intestinal duplication was in fact an anorectal malformation). Postnatal diagnosis was not achieved in four cases: None of them required surgery, and clinical follow-up was favorable. The abdominal cysts were isolated in 52 cases (71%) and associated with other anomalies in 21 cases (29%). Aneuploidies were diagnosed in three cases (all trisomy 21). Eight cases underwent termination of pregnancy; there were no fetal deaths and one neonatal death. Postnatal surgery was performed in 30 out of 65 liveborn infants (46.1%). Overall diagnostic agreement between prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of fetal intra-abdominal cystic lesions is high.

Attempts to correct genital ambiguity through surgical intervention have been partially successful. Fetal hyperandrogenemia and genital ambiguity have been shown to be preventable by prenatal administration of low-dose dexamethasone initiated before the 9th week of gestation. In 7 of 8 at-risk pregnancies, the unaffected fetus is unnecessarily exposed to dexamethasone for weeks until the diagnosis of classical CAH is ruled out by invasive procedures. This therapeutic dilemma calls for early prenatal diagnosis so that dexamethasone treatment can be directed to affected female fetuses only. We describe the utilization of cell-free fetal DNA in mothers carrying at-risk fetuses as early as 6 gestational weeks by targeted massively parallel sequencing of the genomic region including and flanking the CYP21A2 gene. Our highly personalized and innovative approach should permit the diagnosis of CAH before genital development begins, therefore restricting the purposeful administration of dexamethasone to mothers carrying affected females.

Population-based study using data from the French National Register for EA from 2008Â to 2010. We compared children with prenatal versus post-natal diagnosis in regards to prenatal, maternal and neonatal characteristics. We define a composite variable of morbidity (anastomotic esophageal leaks, recurrent fistula, stenosis) and mortality at 1Â year. Four hundred and eight live births with EA type III were recorded with a prenatal diagnosis rate of 18.1%. Transfer after birth was lower in prenatal subset (32.4% versus 81.5%, P<0.001). Delay between birth and first intervention was not significantly different. Defect size (2cm vs 1.4cm, P<0.001), gastrostomy (21.6% versus 8.7%, P<0.001) and length in neonatal unit care were higher in prenatal subset (47.9Â days versus 33.6Â days, P<0.001). The composite variables were higher in prenatal diagnosis subset (38.7% vs 26.1%, P=0.044). Despite the excellent survival rate of EA, cases with antenatal detection have a higher morbidity related to the EA type (longer gap). Even if it does not modify neonatal management and 1-year outcome, prenatal diagnosis allows antenatal parental counseling and avoids post-natal transfer. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In vivo diagnosis can be established with prenatal brain imaging and disease severity correlates with extent of abnormally developed brain tissue. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over the past 25 years and their application to the fetus have enabled diagnosis of holoprosencephaly in utero. Here, we report on the prenatal diagnosis of holoprosencephaly using MRI as part of a diagnostic and management evaluation at a tertiary and quaternary referral center. Using an advanced MRI protocol and a 1.5-Tesla magnet, we show radiographic data diagnostic for the holoprosencephaly spectrum, including alobar, semilobar, lobar, middle interhemispheric, and septopreoptic variant. Accurate prenatal evaluation is important because the severity of imaging findings correlates with postnatal morbidity and mortality in holoprosencephaly. Therefore, this work has implications for the evaluation, diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling that families can receive during a pregnancy.

Moreover, liberal use of birth control methods and restriction of family size have placed greater emphasis on optimum outcome of each pregnancy. There are many prenatal diagnostic techniques of proven value; the risks, including false negatives and false positives, are known. With the rapid proliferation of new and experimental techniques, many disorders are potential diagnosable or even treatable; however, risk factors are unknown and issues relating to quality control have not been resolved. These problems are readily appreciated in the dramatic new techniques involving recombinant DNA,moreÂ Â» chorion villus sampling, and fetal surgery. Unfortunately, clinicians may not appreciate the difficulties that may also be encountered in the more mundane prenatal diagnostic tests such as ultrasonography or enzymatic testing. The aim of this volume is to clarify and rationalize certain aspects of diagnosis, genetic counseling, and intervention. New and experimental techniques are presented in the light of current knowledge.Â«Â less\n\nInvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal thalassemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Dong-Zhi; Yang, Yan-Dong\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThalassemia is the most common monogenic inherited disease worldwide, affecting individuals originating from many countries to various extents. As the disease requires long-term care, prevention of the homozygous state presents a substantial global disease burden. The comprehensively preventive programs involve carrier detections, molecular diagnostics, genetic counseling, and prenatal diagnosis. Invasive prenatal diagnosis refers to obtaining fetal material by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at the first trimester, and by amniocentesis or cordocentesis at the second trimester. Molecular diagnosis, which includes multiple techniques that are aimed at the detection of mutations in the Î±- or Î²-globin genes, facilitates prenatal diagnosis and definitive diagnosis of the fetus. These are valuable procedures for couples at risk, so that they can be offered options to have healthy offspring. According to local practices and legislation, genetic counseling should accompany the invasive diagnostic procedures, DNA testing, and disclosure of the results. The most critical issue in any type of prenatal molecular testing is maternal cell contamination (MCC), especially when a fetus is found to inherit a particular mutation from the mother. The best practice is to perform MCC studies on all prenatal samples. The recent successful studies of fetal DNA in maternal plasma may allow future prenatal testing that is non-invasive for the fetus and result in significant reduction of invasive diagnostic procedures.

Prenatal diagnosis of the craniofacial anomalies is possible with the advent of newer imaging modalities. The identification of the defect at an early stage in the pregnancy helps the parents to be well informed and counseled regarding the treatment possibilities and outcomes of cleft lip and palate (CLP) treatment. To analyze the psychological effects of prenatal diagnosis of CLP on the parents. PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar searches were made with search strings \"prenatal diagnosis cleft lip palate,\" \"antenatal diagnosis,\" \"anomaly scan,\" \"psychological effect cleft lip palate,\" and \"prenatal counseling cleft lip palate.\" Of the results obtained, studies which evaluated the psychological aspects of parents of cleft children were further included in the study. Electronic search yielded 500 articles after duplication removal. Forty studies concentrated on the results of the scan and their implications predominantly in the diagnosis and management of cleft and other related abnormalities. Eight studies discussed the effects of prenatal diagnosis and counseling on the parents. Prenatal diagnosis enables appropriate and timely counseling of the parents by the cleft team and helps instill a sense of preparedness for the family which highly improves the quality of treatment received by the child enabling a near-to-normal quality and standard of life.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of orofacial clefts: association with maternal satisfaction, team care, and treatment outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nRobbins, James M; Damiano, Peter; Druschel, Charlotte M; Hobbs, Charlotte A; Romitti, Paul A; Austin, April A; Tyler, Margaret; Reading, J Alex; Burnett, Whitney\n\n2010-09-01\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of an orofacial cleft is thought to allow mothers greater opportunity to become prepared for the special needs of an infant with a cleft and plan for the care of their child. Using a population-based sample, we determined which children were more likely to be diagnosed prenatally, and whether early diagnosis was associated with maternal satisfaction and treatment outcomes. Interviews were completed with 235 (49% of eligible) mothers of children ages 2 to 7 with orofacial clefts initially enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study from the Arkansas, Iowa, and New York sites. Maternal satisfaction with information, support, and treatment outcomes was compared between women who received a prenatal diagnosis and those who did not. Of 235 infants with clefts, 46 (19.6%) were identified prenatally. One third of mothers were somewhat or not satisfied with information provided by medical staff. Satisfaction did not vary by timing of the diagnosis. Infants diagnosed prenatally were no more likely to have received care provided by a recognized multidisciplinary cleft team (76%) than were infants diagnosed at birth (78%). Speech problems and facial appearance as rated by the mother did not vary by timing of the diagnosis. Timing of the cleft diagnosis did not alter maternal satisfaction with information, whether care was provided by a designated cleft team, or maternal perception of facial appearance or speech. Further research should determine whether prenatal diagnoses alter maternal anxiety or influence postnatal morbidity.\n\nConsumerism in prenatal diagnosis: a challenge for ethical guidelines\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHenn, W.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe ethical guidelines for prenatal diagnosis proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), as well as by national regulations, only refer to paternity and gender of the fetus as unacceptable, disease-unrelated criteria for prenatal selection, as no other such parameters are at hand so far. This perspective is too narrow because research on complex genetic systems such as cognition and ageing is about to provide clinically applicable tests for genetic constituents of potentially desirable properties such as intelligence or longevity which could be misused as parameters for prenatal diagnosis. Moreover, there is an increasing number of prenatally testable genetic traits, such as heritable deafness, which are generally regarded as pathological but desired by some prospective parents and taken into account as parameters for pro-disability selection. To protect prenatal diagnosis from ethically unacceptable genetic consumerism, guidelines must be clarified as soon as possible and updated towards a worldwide restriction of prenatal genetic testing to immediately disease-determining traits.

Except for X-linked inheritance, the high recurrence rate of a family is about 25%. After birth, it may cause a series of neurological symptoms, even with retina, kidney, liver, and other organ abnormalities, which is defined as Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD). Molecular genetics research contributes to disease prediction and genetic counseling. Prenatal diagnosis is rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually the first-choice diagnostic modality with typical brain images characterized by the molar tooth sign. We describe a case of JS prenatally and Dandy-Walker malformation for the differential diagnosis based on ultrasonograms. We also review the etiology, imaging features, clinical symptoms, and diagnosis of JSRD. Case presentation: A 22-year-old woman was pregnant at 27 1/7 weeksâ gestation with fetal cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Fetal ultrasonography and MRI confirmed a diagnosis of JS at our center. The couple finally opted to terminate the fetus, which had a normal appearance and growth parameters. The couple also had an AHI1 gene mutation on chromosome 6. Conclusions: Currently, a diagnosis of JS is commonly made after birth. Fewer cases of prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography have been made, and they are more liable to be misdirected because of some nonspecial features that also manifest in Dandy-Walker malformation, cranio-cerebello-cardiac syndrome, and so on.

As therapeutic options and prognosis depend on the time point of diagnosis, early recognition was attempted during routine prenatal ultrasound examinations. Fetuses of nine pregnant women (one triplet and eight singleton pregnancies) with family histories of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia were investigated by sonography between the 20th and 24th week of gestation. In 4 male and 2 female fetuses reduced amounts of tooth germs were detected, whereas 5 fetal subjects showed the normal amount. Three-dimensional ultrasound evaluation revealed mandibular hypoplasia in 5 of the 6 fetuses with oligodontia. Molecular genetic analysis and/or clinical findings after birth confirmed the prenatal sonographic diagnosis in each subject. In subjects with a family history of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, the diagnosis of this rare condition can be established noninvasively by sonography in the second trimester of pregnancy. Early recognition of the disorder may help to prevent dangerous hyperthermic episodes in infancy and may allow timely therapeutic interventions.

Irregular ventricular walls on axial view and irregular square-shaped lateral ventricles on coronal view are suggestive of PNH in the early third trimester. To achieve an early prenatal diagnosis, it is important to keep in mind the possible coexistence of PNH with brain malformations such as ventriculomegaly, posterior fossa anomalies, or agenesis of corpus callosum.

This cyst can be accurately diagnosed by echography in utero and by MR imaging. Prenatal diagnosis allows for early consultation with surgical specialist, so that the time and place of the delivery can be addressed for neonatal preoperative planning. We report the first prenatal diagnosis of a vallecular cyst at 25 weeks of gestation. At birth, the cyst was drained and then marsupialized. We believed that, in cases of oropharyngeal tumors discovered in utero, elective delivery should be realised in a tertiary referral center in which emergency ventilation and tracheostomy are possible.\n\nPolicy analysis for prenatal genetic diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nThompson, M; Milunsky, A\n\n1979-01-01\n\nConsideration of the analytic difficulties faced in estimating the benefits and costs of prenatal genetic diagnosis, coupled with a brief review of existing benefit-cost studies, leads to the conclusion that public subsidy of prenatal testing can yield benefits substantially in excess of costs. The practical obstacles to such programs include the attitudes of prospective parents, a lack of knowledge, monetary barriers, inadequately organized medical resources, and the political issue of abortion. Policy analysis can now nevertheless formulate principles and guide immediate actions to improve present utilization of prenatal testing and to facilitate possible future expansion of these diagnostic techniques.\n\nNoninvasive prenatal diagnosis for single gene disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nAllen, Stephanie; Young, Elizabeth; Bowns, Benjamin\n\n2017-04-01\n\nNoninvasive prenatal diagnosis for single gene disorders is coming to fruition in its clinical utility. The presence of cell-free DNA in maternal plasma has been recognized for many years, and a number of applications have developed from this. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for single gene disorders has lagged behind due to complexities of technology development, lack of investment and the need for validation samples for rare disorders. Publications are emerging demonstrating a variety of technical approaches and feasibility of clinical application. Techniques for analysis of cell-free DNA including digital PCR, next-generation sequencing and relative haplotype dosage have been used most often for assay development. Analysis of circulating fetal cells in the maternal blood is still being investigated as a viable alternative and more recently transcervical trophoblast cells. Studies exploring ethical and social issues are generally positive but raise concerns around the routinization of prenatal testing. Further work is necessary to make testing available to all patients with a pregnancy at risk of a single gene disorder, and it remains to be seen if the development of more powerful technologies such as isolation and analysis of single cells will shift the emphasis of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. As testing becomes possible for a wider range of conditions, more ethical questions will become relevant.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis in Sweden: organisation and current issues.\n\nPubMed\n\nBui, T H; Kristoffersson, U\n\n1997-01-01\n\nInvasive prenatal diagnosis was introduced in Sweden in the early 1970s and is an integral part of the public health care system. Funding is provided by taxation; the patient only pays a consultation fee. Genetic analyses on a broad range of cytogenetic and molecular disorders are performed at the 6 university-affiliated hospitals and in 1 county hospital. About 6% of all newborns have been cytogenetically screened during pregnancy, and about 90% of the analyses are performed after amniocentesis. The main indication is chromosome analysis because of advanced maternal age.\n\nAcrania/encephalocele sequence (exencephaly) associated with 92,XXXX karyotype: early prenatal diagnosis at 9(+5) weeks by 3D transvaginal ultrasound and coelocentesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTonni, Gabriele; Ventura, Alessandro; Bonasoni, Maria Paola\n\n2009-09-01\n\nA 27-year-old pregnant woman was diagnosed by 3D transvaginal ultrasound as carrying a fetus of 9(+5) weeks gestation affected by acrania/encephalocele (exencephaly) sequence. A 2D transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration of 5 mL of extra-coelomic fluid was performed under cervical block before uterine suction. Conventional cytogenetic analysis demonstrated a 92,XXXX karyotype. Transvaginal 2D ultrasound-guided coelocentesis for rapid karyotyping can be proposed to women who are near to miscarriage or in cases where a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of congenital anomaly is performed at an early stage of development. Genetic analysis can be performed using traditional cytogenetic analysis or can be aided by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Coelocentesis may become an integral part of first trimester armamentarium and may be clinically useful in the understanding of the pathogenesis of early prenatally diagnosed congenital anomalies.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism retardation and dysmorphism (HRD) syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nHershkovitz, E; Hershkovitz, R; Hertzug, L; Gorodischer, R; Mazor, M; Parvari, R\n\n2000-06-01\n\nWe used linkage analysis for prenatal diagnosis of the recently reported hypoparathyroidism, retardation, and dysmorphism (HRD) syndrome. Five cases from four families were evaluated. Three fetuses were carriers and were born healthy. Two fetuses were affected but the parents decided not to terminate the pregnancies. The diagnosis of HRD syndrome was confirmed in these newborns. This is the first report about prenatal diagnosis of HRD syndrome.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for Down syndrome as a highly sensitive screening test is now available worldwide through the commercial sector with many countries moving toward implementation into their publically funded maternity systems. Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) can now be performed for definitive diagnosis of some recessive and X-linked conditions, rather than just paternally inherited dominant and de novo conditions. NIPD/T offers pregnant couples greater choice during their pregnancy as these safer methods avoid the risk of miscarriage associated with invasive testing. As the cost of sequencing falls and technology develops further, there may well be potential for whole exome and whole genome sequencing of the unborn fetus using cell-free DNA in the maternal plasma. How such assays can or should be implemented into the clinical setting remain an area of significant debate, but it is clear that the progress made to date for safer prenatal testing has been welcomed by expectant couples and their healthcare professionals.

Based on family history, 40 Tunisian couples were selected for prenatal diagnosis. Fetal DNA was isolated from amniotic fluid collected by transabdominal amniocentesis or from chronic villi by transcervical chorionic villus sampling. The genetic analysis for cystic fibrosis mutations was performed by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis and denaturing high-pressure liquid phase chromatography. We performed microsatellites analysis by capillary electrophoresis in order to verify the absence of maternal cell contamination. Thirteen fetuses were affected, 21 were heterozygous carriers and 15 were healthy with two normal alleles of CFTR gene. Ten couples opted for therapeutic abortion. The microsatellites genotyping showed the absence of contamination of the fetal DNA by maternal DNA in 93.75%. Our diagnostic strategy provides rapid and reliable prenatal diagnosis at risk families of cystic fibrosis. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A newborn was delivered at 35 weeks gestation who had an intrauterine diagnosis of a renal mass as early as 32 weeks gestational age by ultrasound examination. Tumor nephrectomy was performed on day 11 after delivery when an increase in hypertension was observed in the newborn.\n\nUltrasonographic prenatal diagnosis of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism types I/III.\n\nPubMed\n\nNadjari, M; Fasouliotis, S J; Ariel, I; Raas-Rothschild, A; Bar-Ziv, J; Elchalal, U\n\n2000-08-01\n\nMicrocephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism is a rare disease characterized by unique clinical appearance and specific radiographic findings, and distinctive brain abnormalities. We describe the prenatal diagnosis of two siblings with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism types I/III at 23 and 26 weeks of gestation, respectively. Early detection by sequential antenatal sonographic evaluation is important for counselling families known to be at risk of this rare disease.

The objective was to evaluate the presence of brain abnormalities in the prenatal diagnosis of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Prenatal ultrasound and MRI examination of the fetal brain were performed in a case of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. A comprehensive review of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome reported between 1960 and 2000 in the literature was carried out. The late diagnosis of a growth-retarded fetus with normal amniotic fluid volume, normal Doppler and negative infection screen calls for a detailed examination of the fetal brain and heart. Multifocal white matter lesions and periventricular cystic changes, which are often attributed to perinatal distress, are possible prenatal features causing suspicion of 4p- syndrome in an IUGR fetus. Subtle abnormalities on ultrasound may suggest a chromosomal problem. Standard cytogenetics cannot always demonstrate a microdeletion. High-resolution banding and molecular analysis can help to confirm the diagnosis.

We aimed to evaluate the accuracy, efficacy, and incremental yield of chromosomal microarray analysis as compared with karyotyping for routine prenatal diagnosis. Methods Samples from women undergoing prenatal diagnosis at 29 centers were sent to a central karyotyping laboratory. Each sample was split in two; standard karyotyping was performed on one portion and the other was sent to one of four laboratories for chromosomal microarray. Results We enrolled a total of 4406 women. Indications for prenatal diagnosis were advanced maternal age (46.6%), abnormal result on Downâs syndrome screening (18.8%), structural anomalies on ultrasonography (25.2%), and other indications (9.4%). In 4340 (98.8%) of the fetal samples, microarray analysis was successful; 87.9% of samples could be used without tissue culture. Microarray analysis of the 4282 nonmosaic samples identified all the aneuploidies and unbalanced rearrangements identified on karyotyping but did not identify balanced translocations and fetal triploidy. In samples with a normal karyotype, microarray analysis revealed clinically relevant deletions or duplications in 6.0% with a structural anomaly and in 1.7% of those whose indications were advanced maternal age or positive screening results. Conclusions In the context of prenatal diagnostic testing, chromosomal microarray analysis identified additional, clinically significant cytogenetic information as compared with karyotyping and was equally efficacious in identifying aneuploidies and unbalanced rearrangements but did not identify balanced translocations and triploidies.

Seventeen published and unpublished reports appearing between 1984 and 2001 and retrieved between December of 2002 and March of 2003. The electronic databases searched include Academic Search Elite, AIDS Information Online (AIDSLINE), Anthropological Index Online, Anthropological Literature, Black Studies, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Digital Dissertations, Dissertation Abstracts Index (DAI), Educational Resource Information Center (ERIC), MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS), PubMed, Social Science Abstracts (SocSci Abstracts), Social Science Citation Index, Social Work Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts (Sociofile), Women's Resources International, and Women's Studies. Qualitative studies involving expectant parents living in the United States of any race, ethnicity, nationality, or class who learned during any time in pregnancy of any fetal impairment by any means of diagnosis were eligible for inclusion. Metasummary techniques, including the calculation of frequency effect sizes, were used to aggregate the findings. Metasynthesis techniques, including constant comparison analysis and the reciprocal translation of concepts, were used to interpret the findings. The topical emphasis in the findings is on the termination of pregnancy following positive diagnosis. The thematic emphasis is on the dilemmas of choice and decision making. Positive prenatal diagnosis was for couples an experience of chosen losses and lost choices. Couples managed information to minimize stigmatization and cognitive dissonance. Existing guidelines for caring for couples after perinatal losses must accommodate the chosen loss experientially defining positive prenatal diagnosis.\n\nJarcho-Levin syndrome: prenatal diagnosis, perinatal care, and follow-up of siblings.\n\nPubMed\n\nLawson, M E; Share, J; Benacerraf, B; Krauss, C M\n\n1997-01-01\n\nJarcho-Levin syndrome (JLS), spondylothoracic or spondylocostal dysostosis, is a rare entity with variable clinical severity. This syndrome is usually diagnosed in individuals with short neck, short trunk, and short stature with multiple vertebral anomalies at all levels of the vertebral column, including \"butterfly vertebrae,\" hemivertebrae, and fused, hypoplastic vertebrae. The small size of the thorax in newborns frequently leads to respiratory compromise and death in infancy. We report a family in which the diagnosis of JLS in a 1-year-old led to prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of JLS in a sibling. Aggressive neonatal care of the sibling, who developed respiratory failure soon after birth, led to an excellent outcome. This case confirms the utility of the prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of JLS and suggests that when the diagnosis of JLS is known prenatally, appropriate preparations can be made for specialized prenatal and postnatal care that may improve survival.\n\nNoninvasive Prenatal Diagnosis of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Using Cell-Free Fetal DNA in Maternal Plasma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTong, Yu K.; Yuen, Tony; Jiang, Peiyong; Pina, Christian; Chan, K. C. Allen; Khattab, Ahmed; Liao, Gary J. W.; Yau, Mabel; Kim, Se-Min; Chiu, Rossa W. K.; Sun, Li; Zaidi, Mone\n\n2014-01-01\n\nContext: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive condition that arises from mutations in CYP21A2 gene, which encodes for the steroidogenic enzyme 21-hydroxylase. To prevent genital ambiguity in affected female fetuses, prenatal treatment with dexamethasone must begin on or before gestational week 9. Currently used chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis provide genetic results at approximately 14 weeks of gestation at the earliest. This means that mothers who want to undergo prenatal dexamethasone treatment will be unnecessarily treating seven of eight fetuses (males and three of four unaffected females), emphasizing the desirability of earlier genetic diagnosis in utero. Objective: The objective of the study was to develop a noninvasive method for early prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for CAH. Patients: Fourteen families, each with a proband affected by phenotypically classical CAH, were recruited. Design: Cell-free fetal DNA was obtained from 3.6 mL of maternal plasma. Using hybridization probes designed to capture a 6-Mb region flanking CYP21A2, targeted massively parallel sequencing (MPS) was performed to analyze genomic DNA samples from parents and proband to determine parental haplotypes. Plasma DNA from pregnant mothers also underwent targeted MPS to deduce fetal inheritance of parental haplotypes. Results: In all 14 families, the fetal CAH status was correctly deduced by targeted MPS of DNA in maternal plasma, as early as 5 weeks 6 days of gestation. Conclusions: MPS on 3.6 mL plasma from pregnant mothers could potentially provide the diagnosis of CAH, noninvasively, before the ninth week of gestation. Only affected female fetuses will thus be treated. Our strategy represents a generic approach for noninvasive prenatal testing for an array of autosomal recessive disorders.

It shows how the indications have varied as to the structure of the population did. These changes have been possible thanks to the fact that the screening and prenatal diagnosis methods have allowed it. Demonstrating, once again, how procedures evolve with technology and adapt to the demography. This evolution has allowed to make a more effective prenatal diagnosis because the clinical indications have been more precise what has allowed to detect the same number of fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities by performing less invasive procedures, which has led to an optimization of prenatal diagnosis saving resources and personnel and, above all, avoiding unnecessary fetal losses.\n\n[Gene mutation analysis and prenatal diagnosis of a family with Bartter syndrome].\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Long; Ma, Na; Li, Xiu-Rong; Gong, Fei; DU, Juan\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTo investigate the mutation of related genes and prenatal diagnosis of a family with Bartter syndrome (BS). The high-throughput capture sequencing technique and PCR-Sanger sequencing were used to detect pathogenic genes in the proband of this family and analyze the whole family at the genomic level. After the genetic cause was clarified, the amniotic fluid was collected from the proband's mother who was pregnant for 5 months for prenatal diagnosis. The proband carried compound heterozygous mutations of c.88C>T(p.Arg30*) and c.968+2T>A in the CLCNKB gene; c.88C>T(p.Arg30*) had been reported as a pathogenic mutation, and c.968+2T>A was a new mutation. Pedigree analysis showed that the two mutations were inherited from the mother and father, respectively. Prenatal diagnosis showed that the fetus did not inherit the mutations from parents and had no mutations at the two loci. The follow-up visit confirmed that the infant was in a healthy state, which proved the accuracy of genetic diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis. The compound heterozygous mutations c.88C>T(p.Arg30*) and c.968+2T>A in the CLCNKB gene are the cause of BS in the proband, and prenatal diagnosis can prevent the risk of recurrence of BS in this family.\n\nPrenatally Diagnosis and Outcome of Fetuses with Cardiac Rhabdomyoma â Single Centre Experience\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBejiqi, Ramush; Retkoceri, Ragip; Bejiqi, Hana\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND Cardiac rhabdomyoma (CRs) are the most common primary tumour of the heart in infants and children. Usually are multiple and, basing on the location can cause a haemodynamic disturbance, dysrhythmias or heart failure during the fetal and early postnatal period. CRs have a natural history of spontaneous regression and are closely associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). It has an association with tuberous sclerosis (TS), and in those, the tumour may regress and disappear completely, or remain consistent in size. AIM: We aimed to evaluate the prenatal diagnosis, clinical presentation and outcome of CRs and their association with TSC in a single centre. The median follow-up period was three years (range: 6 months - 5 years). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records of all fetuses diagnosed prenatally with cardiac rhabdomyoma covering the period January 2010 to December 2016 which had undergone detailed ultrasound evaluation at a single centre with limited technical resources. RESULTS: Twelve fetuses were included in the study; mostly had multiple tumours and a total of 53 tumours were identified in all patients - the maximum was one fetus with16 tumours. All patients were diagnosed prenatally by fetal echocardiography. In two patientâs haemodynamic disturbances during the fetal period was noted and pregnancies have been terminated. After long consultation termination of pregnancy was chosen by the parents in totally 8 cases. In four continuing pregnancies during the first year of live tumours regressed. TSC was diagnosed in all patients during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac rhabdomyoma are benign from the cardiovascular standpoint in most affected fetuses. An early prenatal diagnosis may help for an adequate planning of perinatal monitoring and treatment with the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. Large tumour size, the number of tumours and localisation may cause hydrops, and they are significantly associated with poor\n\nNorrie disease: first mutation report and prenatal diagnosis in an Indian family.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhosh, Manju; Sharma, Shipra; Shastri, Shivaram; Arora, Sadhna; Shukla, Rashmi; Gupta, Neerja; Deka, Deepika; Kabra, Madhulika\n\n2012-11-01\n\nNorrie Disease (ND) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterised by congenital blindness due to severe retinal dysgenesis. Hearing loss and intellectual disability is present in 30-50 % cases. ND is caused by mutations in the NDP gene, located at Xp11.3. The authors describe mutation analysis of a proband with ND and subsequently prenatal diagnosis. Sequence analysis of the NDP gene revealed a hemizygous missense mutation arginine to serine in codon 41 (p.Arg41Ser) in the affected child. Mother was carrier for the mutation. In a subsequent di-chorionic di-amniotic pregnancy, the authors performed prenatal diagnosis by mutation analysis on chorionic villi sample at 11 wk of gestation. The fetuses were unaffected. This is a first mutation report and prenatal diagnosis of a familial case of Norrie disease from India. The importance of genetic testing of Norrie disease for confirmation, carrier testing, prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling is emphasized.\n\nRecommendations for the use of microarrays in prenatal diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuela, Javier; LÃ³pez-ExpÃ³sito, Isabel; Querejeta, MarÃ­a Eugenia; Martorell, Rosa; Cuatrecasas, Esther; Armengol, Lluis; AntolÃ­n, Eugenia; DomÃ­nguez Garrido, Elena; Trujillo-Tiebas, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; Rosell, Jordi; GarcÃ­a Planells, Javier; Cigudosa, Juan Cruz\n\n2017-04-07\n\nMicroarray technology, recently implemented in international prenatal diagnosis systems, has become one of the main techniques in this field in terms of detection rate and objectivity of the results.

A national survey was conducted among Greek women in order to explore their attitudes towards and their use of prenatal diagnosis in relation to their lifestyle. The survey was originally addressed to 3000 Greek women 18-65 years of age. Using as a criterion having a child 5 years old or younger, 350 women were eligible for the study. It was noted that 52 per cent of the respondents were adequately informed, while 48 per cent had either superficial knowledge of the subject or no knowledge at all. Amniocentesis was the method that most women were familiar with. The majority said that they were informed by their doctors and the media, and 13 per cent of the participants had prenatal diagnosis during a previous pregnancy. Twenty-two per cent of those who were not tested were over 35 years of age at the time of pregnancy. There was a significant positive correlation between awareness and acceptance of prenatal diagnosis, on the one hand, and the social, educational and financial profile of the women, on the other. Women aware of prenatal diagnosis adhered more closely to a healthy lifestyle and lived a family-centred life.\n\nNon-invasive prenatal diagnosis using cell-free fetal DNA technology: applications and implications.\n\nPubMed\n\nHall, Alison; Bostanci, A; Wright, C F\n\n2010-01-01\n\nCell-free fetal DNA and RNA circulating in maternal blood can be used for the early non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of an increasing number of genetic conditions, both for pregnancy management and to aid reproductive decision-making. Here we present a brief review of the scientific and clinical status of the technology, and an overview of key ethical, legal and social issues raised by the analysis of cell-free fetal DNA for NIPD. We suggest that the less invasive nature of the technology brings some distinctive issues into focus, such as the possibility of broader uptake of prenatal diagnosis and access to the technology directly by the consumer via the internet, which have not been emphasised in previous work in this area. We also revisit significant issues that are familiar from previous debates about prenatal testing. Since the technology seems to transect existing distinctions between screening and diagnostic tests, there are important implications for the form and process involved in obtaining informed consent or choice. This analysis forms part of the work undertaken by a multidisciplinary group of experts which made recommendations about the implementation of this technology within the UK National Health Service.

Following a previous study on couples at risk for a haemoglobin disorder in Lebanon, we have here interviewed 90 couples at risk for a variety of genetic disorders, in order to assess their acceptance of prenatal diagnosis and the variables that might influence their choice. Overall, 54 per cent of couples said they would request diagnosis in their next pregnancy, while 26 per cent were opposed to such a procedure. In 87. 5 per cent of cases, the reason for refusal was because of religious conviction against termination of pregnancy. Refusal of prenatal diagnosis was also related to a lower socio-economic background and poorer education. Only 12 per cent of couples were properly aware of their genetic risk. Therefore, for prevention of genetic disorders, the emphasis in countries such as Lebanon has probably to be placed on public awareness about genetic risks, the risks of consanguinity, availability of services, while taking into consideration the personal beliefs of the individuals.

We isolate the factors which patients and physicians need to consider intelligently in prenatal diagnosis, and show that the sole use of a threshold age as a screening device is inadequate. Such a threshold fails to consider adequately patients' attitudes regarding many of the possible outcomes of prenatal diagnosis; in particular, the birth of a chromosomally abnormal child and procedural-related miscarriages. It also precludes testing younger women and encourages testing in patients who do not necessarily require or desire it. All pregnant women should be informed about their prenatal diagnosis options, screening techniques, and diagnostic procedures, including their respective limitations, risks, and benefits.\n\nEmbodied experiences of prenatal diagnosis of fetal abnormality and pregnancy termination.\n\nPubMed\n\nPitt, Penelope; McClaren, Belinda J; Hodgson, Jan\n\n2016-05-01\n\nPregnant women routinely undergo prenatal screening in Australia and this has become a common experience of motherhood. When prenatal screening or prenatal testing results in diagnosis of a serious fetal abnormality, women are presented with a decision to continue or terminate their pregnancy. Few recent studies have explored women's psychosocial experience of prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality, and within this small group of studies it is rare for research to consider the embodied aspect of women's experiences. This paper reports on qualitative findings from in-depth interviews with 59 women in Melbourne, Australia who received a prenatal diagnosis of a significant abnormality and decided to terminate the pregnancy. Interview transcripts were coded inductively through thematic analysis. Two themes about embodiment were generated from the interviews: transitioning embodiment, and vulnerable bodies in un/comfortable spaces. Theory of pregnant embodiment was drawn on in interpreting women's narratives. Recommendations arising from the analysis include health professionals recognising, acknowledging and accommodating the transitioning embodied state of women as they consider, prepare for, undergo and recover from pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality. Further recommendations address the connections and disconnections between this transitioning embodied state and the spaces of clinics, hospitals and home. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This is in contrast with screening for common aneuploidies, for which noninvasive methods with a single maternal blood sample have become standard clinical practice. We developed a protocol for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of inherited single-gene disorders using droplet digital PCR from circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma. First, the amount of cfDNA and fetal fraction is determined using a panel of TaqMan assays targeting high-variability single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Second, the ratio of healthy and diseased alleles in maternal plasma is quantified using TaqMan assays targeting the mutations carried by the parents. Two validation approaches of the mutation assay are presented. We collected blood samples from 9 pregnancies at risk for different single-gene disorders, including common conditions and rare metabolic disorders. We measured cases at risk of hemophilia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, Î²-thalassemia, mevalonate kinase deficiency, acetylcholine receptor deficiency, and DFNB1 nonsyndromic hearing loss. We correctly differentiated affected and unaffected pregnancies (2 affected, 7 unaffected), confirmed by neonatal testing. We successfully measured an affected pregnancy as early as week 11 and with a fetal fraction as low as 3.7% (0.3). Our method detects single-nucleotide mutations of autosomal recessive diseases as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. This is of importance for metabolic disorders in which early diagnosis can affect management of the disease and reduce complications and anxiety related to invasive testing.

Prenatal diagnosis of this anomaly is possible by ultrasonography (US), and fetal MRI can be used to diagnose the type of diastematomyelia precisely. Diastematomyelia can be isolated or associated with other dysraphisms, segmental anomalies of the vertebral bodies, or visceral malformations (horseshoe or ectopic kidney, utero-ovarian malformation, and anorectal malformation). We present three cases of fetal diastematomyelia investigated using a multimodal prenatal work-up (US, MRI, 3D-CT). The first case, detected at 20 weeks' gestation, had a lumbar meningocele. At 30 weeks' gestation, direct US visualization revealed the division of the spinal cord into two hemicords. This patient illustrates an isolated type II diastematomyelia with a favorable prognosis. The second case, detected at 22 weeks' gestation, presented with disorganization of bony process of the vertebral column with a midline echogenic bony spur, asymmetrical hemicords, and a foot malposition. Fetal MRI at 26 weeks' gestation and CT/3D reconstructed at 32 weeks' gestation confirmed a type I diastematomyelia with orthopedic malposition. The third case, detected at 22 weeks' gestation, presented with widening of the lumbar canal and scoliosis. Prenatal work-up (US, MRI) disclosed other visceral malformations (pelvic kidney), which led to the assumption of a complex polymalformative syndrome. The pregnancy was terminated. Fetopathologic examination disclosed even more visceral malformations (anal atresia and unicorn uterus).\n\nThe knowledge base and acceptability of prenatal diagnosis by pregnant women in Ibadan.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdekanbi, Adesina O A; Olayemi, Oladapo O; Fawole, Adeniran O\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThis cross-sectional study evaluated knowledge and acceptability of prenatal diagnosis among 500 pregnant women at the University College Hospital, Ibadan. Most participants were aged 25-34 years, self-employed, Muslim, monogamy, secondary school leavers, on income of < naira10,000.00 (US$ 67.00)/month. Attitudinal mean score was dependent on age (p = 0.006), educational attainment (p = 0.001), marital status (p = 0.025) and religion (p = 0.012). Knowledge mean score was influenced by marital status (p = 0.028). Overall, acceptance of prenatal diagnosis was high. There was a direct correlation between acceptance and educational attainment: 41.5%, 31.50%, 19%, 19% of women who agreed to have prenatal diagnosis had tertiary, secondary school, primary school and no formal education respectively. Determinants of acceptability were age, educational attainment, marital status and religion. Being married significantly affected knowledge scores, while tertiary education, being divorced, unskilled and self-employed positively influenced attitude towards prenatal diagnosis.\n\nExpanding the phenotype of Triple X syndrome: A comparison of prenatal versus postnatal diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWigby, Kristen; D'Epagnier, Cheryl; Howell, Susan; Reicks, Amy; Wilson, Rebecca; Cordeiro, Lisa; Tartaglia, Nicole\n\n2016-11-01\n\nTriple X syndrome (47, XXX) occurs in approximately 1:1,000 female births and has a variable phenotype of physical and psychological features. Prenatal diagnosis rates of 47, XXX are increasing due to non-invasive prenatal genetic testing. Previous studies suggest that prenatal diagnosed females have better neurodevelopmental outcomes. This cross-sectional study describes diagnosis, physical features, medical problems, and neurodevelopmental features in a large cohort of females with 47, XXX. Evaluation included review of medical and developmental history, physical exam, cognitive, and adaptive testing. Medical and developmental features were compared between the prenatal and postnatal diagnosis groups using rate calculations and Fisher's exact test. Cognitive and adaptive tests scores were compared using t-tests. Seventy-four females age 6 months-24 years (mean 8.3 years) participated. Forty-four (59.5%) females were in the prenatal diagnosis group. Mean age of postnatal diagnosis was 5.9 years; developmental delay was the most common indication for postnatal genetic testing. Common physical features included hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, clinodactyly, and hypotonia. Medical problems included dental disorders (44.4%), seizure disorders (16.2%), genitourinary malformations (12.2%). The prenatal diagnosis group had higher verbal (Pâ<â0.001), general ability index (Pâ=â0.004), and adaptive functioning scores (Pâ<â0.001). Rates of ADHD (52.2% vs. 45.5%, Pâ=â0.77) and learning disabilities (39.1% vs. 36.3%, Pâ=â1.00) were similar between the two groups. These findings expand on the phenotypic features in females with Triple X syndrome and support that prenatally ascertained females have better cognitive and functional outcomes. However, prenatally diagnosed females are still at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Genetic counseling and treatment recommendations are summarized. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study uses cross-sectional surveys to capture quantitative data from both providers and consumers. Qualitative information based on focus group discussions is also presented. A mail survey of the provincial Bureaus of Health (BOHs) reveals that sixteen provincial prenatal diagnosis centers and twelve city level centers were accredited by the BOHs by July of 2001. These centers were located in thirteen provinces, of thirty in all of China. Of 147 selected institutions surveyed separately, 90.5 percent offer ultrasound examination, 72.1 percent provide pathogen tests (mainly Toxoplasma, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex or TORCH), 57.1 percent do biochemical tests, 21.8 percent have genetic counseling, 13.6 percent do karyotype testing, 7.5 percent do enzymology testing, and 5.4 percent carry out molecular genetic testing. Chromosome diseases, congenital diseases, and several gene diseases are the target diseases. According to qualitative data, macromanagement for prenatal diagnosis, supplier provision of tests, and population demand are the main influences on prenatal diagnosis use. From the quantitative and qualitative analysis, it is clear that the technology of prenatal diagnosis is not diffusing well throughout China and is apparently not appropriately used. The situation of prenatal diagnosis has implications for policy-makers, including identification of priorities, regulation of prenatal diagnosis, strategic planning, development of guidelines based on health technology assessment, and consumer orientation.\n\n[Recurrence of common truncus arteriosus. Prenatal diagnosis of a case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nFerry, P; Massias, C; Salzard, C; Anguill, C; Olleac, A; Quentin, M\n\n1994-01-01\n\nWe report a case of isolated truncus arteriosis diagnosed prenatally which recurred during a subsequent pregnancy. This observation would suggest an increased risk of recurrent single trunk malformation as compared with other congenital heart diseases, in agreement with our understanding of the genetic processes involved. A prenatal screening can be achieved with a systematic examination of the fetal morphology. Prognosis is severe and prenatal diagnosis is difficult.\n\nEthical issues in prenatal diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnson, S R; Elkins, T E\n\n1988-06-01\n\nPrenatal diagnosis raises complex ethical issues not only in terms of individual decision making, but also in the development of clinical services and the formulation of public policy regarding access and funding. The motivation behind prenatal diagnosis is generally to provide the family with information regarding the pregnancy so that the outcome can be improved or, in the case of severely affected pregnancies, a decision can be made about pregnancy termination. Although many of the ethical issues involved in prenatal diagnosis and treatment overlap those common to all types of diagnostic procedures, the former situation is complicated by controversy about the moral status of the fetus and the use of selective abortion as a form of treatment. While there is general agreement that pregnancy termination after the 2nd trimester can be justified if the fetus is afflicted with a condition that is incompatible with postnatal survival or characterized by the virtual absence of cognitive functioning, the disposition of a fetus afflicted with a non-life-threatening physical or mental disability (e.g., Down's syndrome) is more controversial. An additional concern is that women with positive screening test results may choose elective abortion rather than undergo a definitive work-up. The issue of maternal versus fetal rights is perhaps the single most controversial dilemma. Here, the basic ethical dilemma is the conflict between respecting maternal autonomy versus acting beneficently toward the fetus. As a general rule, the more invasive the medical technique and the less certain the benefit to the fetus (e.g., laparotomy), the more difficult it is to make a convincing argument for forced interventions involving the mother's body. Situations in which compelling arguments can be made for forced interventions against the will of the mother are those where an otherwise healthy infant will die without immediate intervention or failure to perform a procedure will result in the\n\nCerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome in a father and a female fetus: early prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis and autosomal dominant transmission.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorin, G; Gekas, J; Naepels, P; Gondry, J; Devauchelle, B; Testelin, S; Sevestre, H; ThÃ©pÃ´t, F; Mathieu, M\n\n2001-10-01\n\nUltrasonography in a female fetus revealed cystic cervical hygroma, severe micrognathia, and vertebral and upper limb anomalies suggestive of cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (CCMS) which was diagnosed ultrasonographically at 16 weeks' gestation. The father is affected and presents with a Pierre Robin sequence, short stature and typical costovertebral anomalies. CCMS is a rare and severe disorder. The high frequency of sporadic cases, vertical transmission, and the excess of sibs affected via horizontal transmission suggest dominant autosomal mutation with possible germinal mosaicism. The vertical familial case detailed in the present report is a reminder of the high risk when one parent or one sibling is affected and the extreme variability of phenotype and costal ossification. Early prenatal ultrasound diagnosis is possible in a severely affected fetus.

Five mutations of the beta-thalassaemia gene common in Asian Indians accounted for 89.2 per cent and rare mutations for 7.2 per cent of all mutant chromosomes, while 3.3 per cent of chromosomes remained uncharacterized. Identical mutations were present in both parents in 43.2 per cent of cases, due to caste-based marriages in India. A confirmed diagnosis was given in 401 (98.3 per cent) cases, of which a complete diagnosis (whether the fetus was normal, a carrier, or homozygous) was possible in 391 (94.2 per cent) of the cases. In 15 couples, the mutation was identified in only one parent. In nine of these, the identified mutation was not present in the fetus, predicting normal/carrier status, while in five the identified mutation was present in the fetus, suggesting carrier/affected status. The abortion rate was 3.9 per cent. Pitfalls in diagnosis were failure of oligonucleotides to work, maternal contamination, and false paternity. The ARMS provides an inexpensive, robust and non-isotopic method for the prenatal diagnosis of beta-thalassaemia in India. Recommendations are outlined for establishing a prenatal diagnostic service in developing countries.\n\nUsing population-based data to predict the impact of introducing noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nSusman, Marleen R; Amor, David J; Muggli, Evelyne; Jaques, Alice M; Halliday, Jane\n\n2010-05-01\n\nTo compare the number and types of chromosome abnormalities prenatally diagnosed and the number of invasive procedures between current prenatal testing pathways and a pathway where noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome replaces Down syndrome screening tests. Numbers and types of chromosome abnormalities for each referral category were extracted from prenatal diagnostic testing reports routinely collected in Victoria, Australia, in 2006 and 2007. These data were then applied to the proposed implementation strategy. If noninvasive prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome had replaced Down syndrome screening tests in 2006 and 2007, in Victoria, there would have been 25 (7%) additional Down syndrome diagnosed, 6896 (84%) fewer invasive procedures, and 231 (56%) non-Down syndrome chromosome abnormalities no longer detected. These include trisomy 13, trisomy 18, sex chromosome abnormalities, balanced and unbalanced rearrangements, polyploidy, and mosaic results. The potential loss of information about chromosome abnormalities other than Down syndrome with noninvasive prenatal diagnosis compared with full karyotyping with traditional prenatal diagnosis should be considered when planning for the implementation of new technologies.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of sickle hemoglobinopathies: The experience of the Columbia university comprehensive center for sickle cell disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDriscoll, M. Catherine; Lerner, Norma; Anyane-Yeboa, Kwame; Maidman, Jack; Warburton, Dorothy; Schaefer-Rego, Kim; Hsu, Ruth; Ince, Carol; Malin, Joanne; Pallai, Michele; Mears, J. Gregory; Bank, Arthur\n\n1987-01-01\n\nWe report here an evaluation of 55 pregnancies at risk for a sickle hemoglobinopathy prenatally diagnosed by restriction-endonuclease analysis, with the endonucleases MstII and HpaI, of amniocyte DNA. The diagnosis was completed in all cases. Eleven fetuses were predicted to be affected, of which six were terminated. Forty-one of the 55 cases were confirmed. One false-negative was reported in a case predicted to be hemoglobin AS but that was determined to be hemoglobin SS at birth. We estimate that the 55 cases represent only 5% of the pregnancies at risk for a sickle hemoglobinopathy in the New York metropolitan area during the study period. We conclude that the prenatal diagnosis of sickle hemoglobinopathies by molecular methods is reliable. However, the efficiency of utilization and effectiveness of prenatal testing is dependent on the early prospective identification of couples at risk and on the education of communities concerning (1) the significant morbidity of the sickle hemoglobinopathies and (2) the reproductive choices now available to them.

For the affected child, potential mutations of the FANCA gene were analyzed with NGS. Suspected mutation was verified with Sanger sequencing. For prenatal diagnosis, genomic DNA was extracted from cultured fetal amniotic fluid cells and subjected to analysis of the same mutations. A low-frequency frameshifting mutation c.989_995del7 (p.H330LfsX2, inherited from his father) and a truncating mutation c.3971C>T (p.P1324L, inherited from his mother) have been identified in the affected child and considered to be pathogenic. The two mutations were subsequently verified by Sanger sequencing. Upon prenatal diagnosis, the fetus was found to carry two mutations. The combined next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing can reduce the time for diagnosis and identify subtypes of Fanconi anemia and the mutational sites, which has enabled reliable prenatal diagnosis of this disease.\n\nPrenatal genetic diagnosis of retinoblastoma and report of RB1 gene mutation from India.\n\nPubMed\n\nShah, Parag K; Sripriya, S; Narendran, V; Pandian, A J\n\n2016-12-01\n\nRetinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy of childhood. There is a paucity of genetic testing and prenatal genetic diagnosis from India, which has the highest incidence worldwide. RB1 gene screening of an 8-month-old female child with bilateral retinoblastoma was accomplished using next generation sequencing. The results were used for prenatal testing in this family. A heterozygous germline mutation (chr13: 48951119delA; c.1281delA) was detected, which resulted in premature termination of a protein product (p.Glu428Argfs*29). Prenatal testing in maternal DNA revealed carrier status of the mother. Further clinical examination in the family members revealed retinocytomas in both eyes of the mother and maternal grandmother. Prenatal genetic testing of the developing fetus showed positivity for the mutation. As the family preferred to continue the pregnancy, serial 3-D ultrasounds were carried out every 2 weeks in the third trimester. Ten days after delivery, small extrafoveal tumors developed in both eyes, which were then treated successfully with transpupillary thermotherapy. We report the significance of genetic testing in the early detection and management of retinoblastoma from India.\n\nPrenatal Diagnosis of Placenta Accreta: Sonography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDwyer, Bonnie K.; Belogolovkin, Victoria; Tran, Lan; Rao, Anjali; Carroll, Ian; Barth, Richard; Chitkara, Usha\n\n2009-01-01\n\nObjective The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of transabdominal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for prenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta. Methods A historical cohort study was undertaken at 3 institutions identifying women at risk for placenta accreta who had undergone both sonography and MRI prenatally. Sonographic and MRI findings were compared with the final diagnosis as determined at delivery and by pathologic examination. Results Thirty-two patients who had both sonography and MRI prenatally to evaluate for placenta accreta were identified. Of these, 15 had confirmation of placenta accreta at delivery. Sonography correctly identified the presence of placenta accreta in 14 of 15 patients (93% sensitivity; 95% confidence interval [CI], 80%â100%) and the absence of placenta accreta in 12 of 17 patients (71% specificity; 95% CI, 49%â93%). Magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified the presence of placenta accreta in 12 of 15 patients (80% sensitivity; 95% CI, 60%â100%) and the absence of placenta accreta in 11 of 17 patients (65% specificity; 95% CI, 42%â88%). In 7 of 32 cases, sonography and MRI had discordant diagnoses: sonography was correct in 5 cases, and MRI was correct in 2. There was no statistical difference in sensitivity (P = .25) or specificity (P = .5) between sonography and MRI. Conclusions Both sonography and MRI have fairly good sensitivity for prenatal diagnosis of placenta accreta; however, specificity does not appear to be as good as reported in other studies. In the case of inconclusive findings with one imaging modality, the other modality may be useful for clarifying the diagnosis.

It might be isolated or associated with congenital syndromes such as trisomy 13, Walker-Warburg syndrome, and Norrie disease. We present 2 cases of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous diagnosed by prenatal sonography in the early third trimester. Bilateral hyperechoic lenses and retinal nonattachment were detected in the sonographic examination of the first case, whereas irregular echogenic bands between the lenses and posterior walls of the eyes were prominent in the second case. In both of the cases, ocular findings were accompanied by intracranial findings, including severe hydrocephalus, an abnormal gyral pattern, and cerebellar hypoplasia, suggesting the diagnosis of Walker-Warburg syndrome. We also present a review of the literature regarding the prenatal diagnosis of this malformation.\n\nChildren's Prenatal Exposure to Drugs: Implications for Early Childhood Educators.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMayfield, Phyllis K.; Chapman, J.

Sonograms showed short fetal limbs with hitchhiker thumbs and toes, thoracic scoliosis, clubbed feet, and polyhydramnios. The ossification of all bony structures appeared normal, and there was no evidence of fractures. On the basis of these sonographic findings, we diagnosed skeletal dysplasia and short-limbed dwarfism, most likely diastrophic dwarfism. We counseled the parents, and the pregnancy was continued. At 37 weeks menstrual age, the patient vaginally delivered a male infant that weighed 2,560 g. The infant survived with respiratory support during his first few days of life. Postnatal physical and radiologic examinations confirmed the prenatal diagnosis of diastrophic dwarfism. Sonography is the modality of choice for prenatal detection of diastrophic dwarfism.

Although mandatory selective abortion of \"defective\" fetuses and, more important, carriers would tend to reduce the number of deleterious genes in the gene pool, the present program of voluntary prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion actually increases the number of deleterious genes. This raises the issue of freedom of choice regarding selective abortion and societal pressure on parents to undergo prenatal testing and to abort their fetus should it have a genetic disorder or be a carrier of one.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis in a cystic fibrosis family: a combined molecular strategy for a precise diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nChÃ¡vez-SaldaÃ±a, Margarita; GarcÃ­a-Cavazos, Ricardo; Vigueras, Rosa MarÃ­a; Orozco, Lorena\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe high genetic heterogeneity in populations with a wide spectrum of mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), makes the detection of mutations a very hard and difficult task, thereby limiting the accurate diagnosis of the disease, mainly in patients with uncharacterized mutations. Molecular strategies, like targeted identification of the most frequent CFTR mutations in Mexican population combined with linkage analysis using markers, is very useful for carrier detection and for prenatal diagnosis in affected families with CF. In this paper we show that the combination of methodologies was a crucial alternative to reach a precise prenatal CF diagnosis. We documented CF diagnosis in a 14th-week fetus combining the screening of the most common mutations in Mexican population with linkage analysis of two extragenic polymorphisms (XV2C/TaqI and KM19/PstI). We determined that the fetus inherited the PG542X mutation from its mother and an unknown mutation from its father through the chromosomal phases analysis.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis--discrimination, deliverance or democracy?\n\nPubMed\n\nBradfield, Owen\n\n2003-07-01\n\nPrenatal diagnosis utilizes invasive procedures such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, cord blood sampling and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. These techniques can diagnose serious foetal illnesses and this therefore provides valuable information to couples, helping them to prepare for the birth of an affected child. It also affords women the freedom to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. The selective termination of foetuses with serious disabilities does not represent disability discrimination because women and parents are actually rejecting the disability, rather than the foetus itself. More significantly, the choice to abort a foetus with a serious illness or disability is an intensely private and personal exercise that does not and cannot be reflective of a wider public morality. Exactly the same can be said of the choice to selectively abort foetuses based solely on their sex. The private choice of women in this respect does not amount to the social devaluation of women. Firstly, it is an erroneous assumption that women in Australia prefer male babies. Secondly, even if there is a preference for male babies, banning prenatal sex selection would be treating just one of many symptoms of sexism, rather than curing the primary causes. The moral right of all women to reproductive freedom is an embodiment of their equal value in society.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis of congenital hallux varus deformity associated with pericentric inversion of chromosome 9.\n\nPubMed\n\nGÃ¼rel, Sebahat Atar\n\n2015-04-01\n\nCongenital hallux varus is a rare deformity of the great toe characterized by adduction of the hallux and medial displacement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Prenatal diagnosis of congenital hallux varus is presented herein. A 32-year-old woman was referred to our unit due to significant deviation of the fetal right great toe at 22(+2) weeks of pregnancy. Ultrasound examination revealed a thick and short great toe, which was significantly angulated medially on the right side. Amniocentesis was performed and the result was reported as inv(9) (p11;q12). After delivery, the clinical examination confirmed the prenatal diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported prenatal diagnosis of an isolated congenital hallux varus. Congenital hallux varus can be diagnosed easily in the prenatal period by 2-D and 4-D ultrasonography. Prenatal karyotyping should be taken into consideration, especially in the presence of associated anomalies, such as polydactyly and clubfoot. Â© 2014 The Author.

The diaphyseal length and the bowed shape of long bones associated with vertebral body dimension assessment were investigated in a group of 14 pregnancy terminations carried out in the time period 2007-2013. The definitive diagnosis was established after pregnancy termination by means of skeletal standardized X-rays, histopathology and gene analysis. TD and OI-2 long bones were significantly shorter than controls. No significant differences were observed between the two dysplasias. The bowing angle was higher in OI-2; a true angulation or eventually axial displacement was present only in the latter. Furthermore, they did not show any evidence of vertebral collapse. The thanatophoric dysplasia presented less bowed long bones, and never true angulation. The spine was steadily characterized by flattened anterior vertebral bodies. Long bone shortening is not a sufficient and accurate sign for early sonographic differential diagnosis between TD and OI-2. Angled diaphysis, axial diaphyseal displacement and a conserved vertebral body height in the prenatal period support the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type 2, while moderately regular bowed diaphysis associated with platyspondyly that of thanatophoric dysplasia.\n\n[The possibility of prenatal diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder].\n\nPubMed\n\nVanya, Melinda; SzÃ¼cs, Szabina; Szili, KÃ¡roly; VetrÃ³, Ãgnes; BÃ¡rtfai, GyÃ¶rgy\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an idiopathic multifactorial disease. Chromosomal abnormalities could be found only in a few percent (0.3-0.6) of cases. The estimated prevalence is 0.6 in Europe and the prevalence of the disease has been increased in last few decades. ASD have an impact on the quality of life of the patient and his family. The early diagnosis of ASD is most important. There are limited data regarding the measure of biparietal diameter (BPD) of the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy. These data suggested the BPD is an important screening marker for ASD, but the complex prenatal screening is unresolved. There is a need for further investigations of the genetic background of ASD and to identify potentially first trimester ultrasound markers for ASD.\n\nRapid Flow cytometric prenatal diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency (PID) disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nMishra, Anju; Gupta, Maya; Dalvi, Aparna; Ghosh, Kanjaksha; Madkaikar, Manisha\n\n2014-04-01\n\nPrimary Immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of immune system. Immunophenotypic evaluation of PIDs using flowcytometry provides important clues for diagnosis of these disorders, though confirmation requires identification of underlying molecular defects. Prenatal diagnosis (PND) forms an important component of management in families affected with severe PID. However, molecular diagnostic facilities for each of these diseases are not available and may not be possible to perform in all cases. In such scenario we opted for phenotypic prenatal diagnosis by cordocentesis for families with index case having immunophenotypically well characterized PID. Normal reference ranges of lymphocyte subsets, CD 18/CD11 integrins on leukocytes, MHC class II expression and oxidative burst activity of fetal neutrophils at 18 weeks of gestation were previously established on 30 cord blood samples. PND was performed in 13 families with PIDs. Maternal contamination was ruled out by VNTR analysis. Out of 13 fetuses, nine were found to be unaffected (three cases with leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD-I), four cases with severe combined immunodeficiency diseases (SCID), one with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and one with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)] and three were found to be affected (one with T-B+NK-SCID, one with MHC class II deficiency and one with LAD-I). Diagnosis was confirmed by testing the cord blood samples after delivery and further follow-up of the children. In one family diagnosis could not be offered due to maternal contamination. No procedure related complications were observed. Flowcytometry offers rapid and sensitive method for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling for selected phenotypically well characterized PID in cases where molecular diagnostic facilities are not available.\n\nPrenatal Diagnosis of Transposition of the Great Arteries over a 20-Year Period: Improved but Imperfect\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEscobar-Diaz, Maria C; Freud, Lindsay R; Bueno, Alejandra; Brown, David W; Friedman, Kevin; Schidlow, David; Emani, Sitaram; del Nido, Pedro; Tworetzky, Wayne\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate temporal trends in prenatal diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum (TGA/IVS) and its impact on neonatal morbidity and mortality. Methods Newborns with TGA/IVS referred for surgical management to our center over a 20-year period (1992 â 2011) were included. The study time was divided into 5 four-year periods, and the primary outcome was rate of prenatal diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included neonatal pre-operative status and perioperative survival. Results Of the 340 patients, 81 (24%) had a prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis increased over the study period from 6% to 41% (p<0.001). Prenatally diagnosed patients underwent a balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) earlier than postnatally diagnosed patients (0 vs. 1 day, p<0.001) and fewer required mechanical ventilation (56% vs. 69%, p=0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in pre-operative acidosis (16% vs. 26%, p=0.1) and need for preoperative ECMO (2% vs. 3%, p=1.0). There was also no significant mortality difference (1 pre-operative and no post-operative deaths among prenatally diagnosed patients, as compared to 4 pre-operative and 6 post-operative deaths among postnatally diagnosed patients). Conclusion The prenatal detection rate of TGA/IVS has improved but still remains below 50%, suggesting the need for strategies to increase detection rates. The mortality rate was not statistically different between pre- and postnatally diagnosed patients; however, there were significant pre-operative differences with regard to earlier BAS and less mechanical ventilation. Ongoing study is required to elucidate whether prenatal diagnosis confers long-term benefit.

Initially, a sacrococcygeal teratoma was suspected on the basis of fetal ultrasonography, which revealed normal heart anatomy and an increasing tumour mass. The diagnosis was then changed to fetus in fetu or teratoma. Prenatal magnetic resonance imaging at the 34th week of pregnancy confirmed the ultrasound diagnosis. No other anomalies were found. Elective caesarean section was performed at term. The care team included a paediatric surgeon, obstetricians, neonatologists, midwives, and an anesthesiologist. A female newborn was delivered in good condition. The tumour was resected in the operating room and mature teratoma was established by histopathological evaluation. Surprisingly, agenesis of the right forearm was revealed which had not been detected prenatally, despite many examinations (both in our hospital and earlier at a primary care obstetrician office).
