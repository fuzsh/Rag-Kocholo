        "text": "Determination of human body burden baseline date of platinum through autopsy tissue analysis.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVandiver, F; Duffield, F V; Yoakum, A; Bumgarner, J; Moran, J\n\n1976-01-01\n\nResults of analysis for platinum in 97 autopsy sets are presented. Analysis was performed by a specially developed emission spectrochemical method. Almost half of the individuals studied were found to have detectable platinum in one or more tissue samples. Platinum was found to be deposited in 13 of 21 tissue types investigated. Surprisingly high values were observed in subcutaneous fat, previously not considered to be a target site for platinum deposition. These data will serve as a human tissue platinum burden baseline in EPA's Catalyst Research Program.

The following values were found in wet digested samples by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) (meanÂ Â±Â SD, median, and range, Î¼g/g of wet weight): brain 0.020Â Â±Â 0.031, 0.084, 0-0.120 (nÂ =Â 41); stomach 0.148Â Â±Â 0.195, 0.084, 0-1.25 (nÂ =Â 89); small intestine 0.227Â Â±Â 0.231, 0.130, 0-0.830 (nÂ =Â 39); liver 1.54Â Â±Â 1.55, 1.01, 0.015-9.65 (nÂ =Â 99); kidney 16.0Â Â±Â 13.2, 14.0, 0.62-61.3 (nÂ =Â 91); lung 0.304Â Â±Â 0.414, 0.130, 0-1.90 (nÂ =Â 25); and heart 0.137Â Â±Â 0.107, 0.140, 0.017-0.250 (nÂ =Â 4). Additionally, results (nÂ =Â 13 people, aged from 2 to 83Â years, 63 samples) obtained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) between 2010 and 2015 are given. The obtained data on Cd concentration in the human body can be used to estimate the amounts occurring in \"healthy\" people and those occurring in cases of chronic or acute poisonings with Cd compounds, which are examined for forensic purposes or to assess environmental exposure levels.\n\nComparison of decomposition rates between autopsied and non-autopsied human remains.\n\nPubMed\n\nBates, Lennon N; Wescott, Daniel J\n\n2016-04-01\n\nPenetrating trauma has been cited as a significant factor in the rate of decomposition. Therefore, penetrating trauma may have an effect on estimations of time-since-death in medicolegal investigations and on research examining decomposition rates and processes when autopsied human bodies are used. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in the rate of decomposition between autopsied and non-autopsied human remains in the same environment. The purpose is to shed light on how large incisions, such as those from a thorocoabdominal autopsy, effect time-since-death estimations and research on the rate of decomposition that use both autopsied and non-autopsied human remains. In this study, 59 non-autopsied and 24 autopsied bodies were studied. The number of accumulated degree days required to reach each decomposition stage was then compared between autopsied and non-autopsied remains. Additionally, both types of bodies were examined for seasonal differences in decomposition rates. As temperature affects the rate of decomposition, this study also compared the internal body temperatures of autopsied and non-autopsied remains to see if differences between the two may be leading to differential decomposition. For this portion of this study, eight non-autopsied and five autopsied bodies were investigated. Internal temperature was collected once a day for two weeks. The results showed that differences in the decomposition rate between autopsied and non-autopsied remains was not statistically significant, though the average ADD needed to reach each stage of decomposition was slightly lower for autopsied bodies than non-autopsied bodies. There was also no significant difference between autopsied and non-autopsied bodies in the rate of decomposition by season or in internal temperature. Therefore, this study suggests that it is unnecessary to separate autopsied and non-autopsied remains when studying gross stages of human decomposition in Central Texas\n\nAutopsy tissues as biological monitors of human exposure to environmental pollutants. A case study: Concentrations of metals and PCDD/Fs in subjects living near a hazardous waste incinerator.\n\nPubMed\n\nDomingo, JosÃ© L; GarcÃ­a, Francisco; Nadal, MartÃ­; Schuhmacher, Marta\n\n2017-04-01\n\nHuman biomonitoring is of tremendous importance to prevent potential adverse effects derived from human exposure to chemicals. Blood and urine are among the biological monitors more frequently used. However, biological matrices such as breast milk, hair, nails, saliva, feces, teeth, and expired air are also often used. In addition, and focused mainly on long-term exposure, adipose tissue and other human tissues like bone, liver, brain or kidney, are also used as biological monitors of certain substances, especially for long-term biomonitoring. However, for this kind of tissues sampling is always a limiting factor. In this paper, we have examined the role of autopsy tissues as biological monitors of human exposure to environmental pollutants. For it, we have used a case study conducted near a hazardous waste incinerator (HWI) in Catalonia (Spain), in which the concentrations of metals and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), have been periodically determined in autopsy tissues of subjects living in the area under potential influence of the facility. This case study does not show advantages -in comparison to other appropriate biomonitors such as blood- in using autopsy tissues in the monitoring of long-term exposure to metals and PCDD/Fs.

The instrumental operating conditions were optimized for the measurement of Cs, Th and U. Rhodium (Rh) was used as an internal standard element to compensate matrix effect. Detection limits for Th, U and Cs were 5.7-17.8 pg x mL(-1). The recoveries for spiking liver samples were 96%-107%, and their RSDs were 4.8%-8.9%. Reference materials of NIST SRM 8414 Bovine and NIST SRM 1486 Bone Meal were analyzed by the described method, and the analytical results agreed well with the reference values. Human autopsy tissues samples were digested by mixed acid (HNO3 + HClO4). The determination of Cs, Th and U in lung, liver, bone, heart, stomach, spleen, muscle, kidney, thyroid gland and intestinum tenue was performed by ICP-MS without separation and enrichment procedures. The obtained results indicated that this method is rapid, sensitive and accurate; the distribution of the three elements is different from one to another human organ sample; the main organ targets for Th and U are lungs and kidneys; and a coordinated variation of Cs, Th and U concentration in lungs was found in the samples collected from Hebei and Sichuan provinces.\n\nImmunohistochemical characterization of human olfactory tissue\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHolbrook, Eric H.; Wu, Enming; Curry, William T.; Lin, Derrick T.; Schwob, James E.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjectives/Hypothesis The pathophysiology underlying human olfactory disorders is poorly understood because biopsying the olfactory epithelium (OE) can be unrepresentative and extensive immunohistochemical analysis is lacking. Autopsy tissue enriches our grasp of normal and abnormal olfactory immunohistology and guides the sampling of the OE by biopsy. Furthermore, a comparison of the molecular phenotype of olfactory epithelial cells between rodents and humans will improve our ability to correlate human histopathology with olfactory dysfunction. Study Design An immunohistochemical analysis of human olfactory tissue using a comprehensive battery of proven antibodies. Methods Human olfactory mucosa obtained from 21 autopsy specimens was analyzed with immunohistochemistry. The position and extent of olfactory mucosa was assayed by staining whole mounts with neuronal markers. Sections of the OE were analyzed with an extensive group of antibodies directed against cytoskeletal proteins and transcription factors, as were surgical specimens from an esthesioneuroblastoma. Results Neuron-rich epithelium is always found inferior to the cribriform plate, even at advanced age, despite the interruptions in the neuroepithelial sheet caused by patchy respiratory metaplasia. The pattern of immunostaining with our antibody panel identifies two distinct types of basal cell progenitors in human OE similar to rodents. The panel also clarifies the complex composition of the esthesioneuroblastoma. Conclusion The extent of human olfactory mucosa at autopsy can easily be delineated as a function of age and neurological disease. The similarities in human vs. rodent OE will enable us to translate knowledge from experimental animals to humans and will extend our understanding of human olfactory pathophysiology.

EATB International Conference, October 17-20, Budapest, Hungary.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan Wijk, Marja J; Visser, Laura; Bokhorst, Arlinke G\n\n2008-12-01\n\nEU directive 2006/17/EC requires that all available medical information, including the autopsy report, is evaluated before releasing tissues for transplantation. The study objective was to investigate whether evaluation of autopsy results of musculoskeletal tissue donors contributes to safety and availability of transplantable tissues. The files of all donors of whom musculoskeletal tissues were retrieved by BIS in 2006 were reviewed for death cause and autopsy results. Of 84 donors musculoskeletal tissues were retrieved. In 47 donors autopsy was performed (56.0%). The groups with and without autopsy were similar in sex, age, length, and weight. In one donor no autopsy results were evaluated, since the donor was already rejected because of positive blood tests. In 13 donors (28.1%) death causes before autopsy were unknown. In 12 of these donors a death cause could be established after autopsy. In nine of the donors with a clear suspected death cause (27.3%), the death cause after autopsy differed from the suspected death cause. Four donors with autopsy (8.7%) had a general contraindication for donation, a (possible) sepsis in three and a persisting unknown death cause in one. Eight donors (17.4%) had musculoskeletal-specific contraindications, i.e. local infections. In conclusion, in 26.1% of the donors with autopsy, general or musculoskeletal-specific contraindications for donation were found. Furthermore, performance of autopsies enlarges the potential donor pool, since death causes can be established in almost all autopsies done in case of an unknown death cause. Therefore, evaluation of autopsy results improves the safety and quantity of tissues for transplantation.\n\nPostmortem brain MRI with selective tissue biopsy as an adjunct to autopsy following neonatal encephalopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nNicholl, R M; Balasubramaniam, V P; Urquhart, D S; Sellathurai, N; Rutherford, M A\n\n2007-05-01\n\nFollowing the death of a neonate it is essential that parents are given full and accurate information about the probable cause of death. Perinatal autopsy often adds new information or may even change the presumed diagnosis [Cartlidge PH, Dawson AT, Stewart JH, Vujanic GM. Value and quality of perinatal and infant postmortem examinations: cohort analysis of 400 consecutive deaths. Br Med J 1995;310(6973):155-8; Khong TY. Falling neonatal autopsy rates. Br Med J 2002;324(7340):749-50] informing decisions regarding the management of any future pregnancy. Autopsy can be considered the \"gold standard\" for the identification of antecedent events leading to a neonatal death. However, recent events in the UK have added to an already declining rate in neonatal autopsies [Brodlie M, Laing IA. Ten years of neonatal autopsies in tertiary referral centre: retrospective study. Br Med J 2002;324(7340):761-3]. To try and redress this balance the Chief Medical Officer has recommended that research should be commissioned into the use of non-invasive imaging to provide a similar standard of information [The Chief Medical Officer. The removal, retention and use of human organs and tissues from post mortem examination. London, England: The Stationary Office, Department of Health; 2001]. Previous publications on postmortem MRI have focused largely on investigation of the foetus and of still birth [Griffiths PD, Variend D, Evans M, Jones A, Wilkinson ID, Paley MNJ, et al. Postmortem MR imaging of the fetal and stillborn central nervous system. Am J Neuroradiol 2003;24(1):22-7; Whitby EH, Paley MN, Cohen M, GriffithsPD. Postmortem MR imaging of the fetus: an adjunct or a replacement for conventional autopsy? Semin Fetal Neonatal Med 2005;10(5):475-83]. We report our experience on the use of postmortem brain MRI combined with selective tissue biopsy, in six neonatal deaths in the setting of a large district general hospital.\n\nBirth and death of human Î²-cells in pancreases from cadaver donors, autopsies, surgical specimens, and islets transplanted into mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaballero, Francisco; Siniakowicz, Karolina; Hollister-Lock, Jennifer; Duran, Luisa; Katsuta, Hitoshi; Yamada, Takatsugu; Lei, Ji; Deng, Shaoping; Westermark, Gunilla T; Markmann, James; Bonner-Weir, Susan; Weir, Gordon C\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThere is great interest in the potential of the human endocrine pancreas for regeneration by Î²-cell replication or neogenesis. Our aim was to explore this potential in adult human pancreases and in both islet and exocrine tissue transplanted into mice. The design was to examine pancreases obtained from cadaver donors, autopsies, and fresh surgical specimens and compare these findings with those obtained from islet and duct tissue grafted into the kidney. Islets and exocrine tissue were transplanted into normoglycemic ICR-SCID mice and studied 4 and 14 weeks later. Î²-Cell replication, as assessed by double staining for insulin and Ki67, was 0.22 Â± 0.03% at 4 weeks and 0.13 Â± 0.03% at 14 weeks. In contrast, no evidence of Î²-cell replication could be found in 11 cadaver donor and 10 autopsy pancreases. However, Ki67 staining of Î²-cells in frozen sections obtained at surgery was comparable to that found in transplanted islets. Evidence for neogenesis in transplanted pancreatic exocrine tissue was supported by finding Î²-cells within the duct epithelium and the presence of cells double stained for insulin and cytokeratin 19 (CK19). However, Î²-cells within the ducts never constituted more than 1% of the CK19-positive cells. With confocal microscopy, 7 of 12 examined cells expressed both markers, consistent with a neogeneic process. Mice with grafts containing islet or exocrine tissue were treated with various combinations of exendin-4, gastrin, and epidermal growth factor; none increased Î²-cell replication or stimulated neogenesis. In summary, human Î²-cells replicate at a low level in islets transplanted into mice and in surgical pancreatic frozen sections, but rarely in cadaver donor or autopsy pancreases. The absence of Î²-cell replication in many adult cadaver or autopsy pancreases could, in part, be an artifact of the postmortem state. Thus, it appears that adult human Î²-cells maintain a low level of turnover through replication and neogenesis.\n\nBirth and death of human Î²-cells in pancreas from cadaver donors, autopsies, surgical specimens, and islets transplanted into mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCaballero, Francisco; Siniakowicz, Karolina; Jennifer-Hollister-Lock; Duran, Luisa; Katsuta, Hitoshi; Yamada, Takatsugu; Lei, Ji; Deng, Shaoping; Westermark, Gunilla T.; Markmann, James; Bonner-Weir, Susan; Weir, Gordon C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere is great interest in the potential of the human endocrine pancreas for regeneration by Î²-cell replication or neogenesis.

Results were compared with those obtained in 1998 (baseline survey) and previous surveys (2003 and 2007). Arsenic, Be, Ni, Tl, and V showed concentrations below the corresponding detection limits in all tissues. Cadmium showed the highest levels in the kidney, with a mean value of 21.15Â Î¼g/g. However, Cd was found below the detection limit in the brain and bone. Chromium showed similar concentrations in the kidney, brain, and lung (range of mean values, 0.57-0.66Â Î¼g/g) and higher in the bone (1.38Â Î¼g/g). In turn, Hg was below the detection limit in all tissues with the exception of the kidney, where the mean concentration was 0.15Â Î¼g/g (range, <0.05-0.58Â Î¼g/g). On the other hand, Mn could be detected in all tissues showing the highest levels in the liver and kidney (1.45 and 1.09Â Î¼g/g, respectively). Moreover, Pb showed the highest concentrations in bone (mean, 1.39Â Î¼g/g; range, <0.025-4.88Â Î¼g/g). Finally, Sn could be detected only in some tissue samples, reaching the highest values in the bone (0.17Â Î¼g/g). The current metal levels in human tissues from individuals living near the HWI of Tarragona are comparable and of a similar magnitude to previously reported results corresponding to general populations, as well as those of our previous surveys.\n\nMicrowave fixation versus formalin fixation of surgical and autopsy tissue.\n\nPubMed\n\nLogin, G R\n\n1978-05-01\n\nMicrowave irradiation of surgical and autopsy tissue penetrates, fixes, and hardens the tissue almost immediately (the fluid media used in the microwave consisted of saline, ten percent phosphate buffered formalin, and distilled water). Tissue sections from a representative sample of organs were tested. Comparable sections were simultaneously fixed in a phosphate buffered ten percent formalin bath in a vaccum oven as a control. Hematoxylin and eosin were used to stain the sections. Results equal to and superior to the control method were obtained. Saline microwave fixation was superior to formalin microwave fixation. Tissues placed in Zenker's solution and fixed in standard microwave oven (for approximately one minute) yielded results at least equal to conventional Zenker fixation (approximately two hours). No tissue hardening resulted from Zenker microwave fixation. A unique time versus temperature graph (microwave heating curve) reduces individual variation with this technique.\n\nComparison of hard tissues that are useful for DNA analysis in forensic autopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaneko, Yu; Ohira, Hiroshi; Tsuda, Yukio; Yamada, Yoshihiro\n\n2015-11-01\n\nForensic analysis of DNA from hard tissues can be important when investigating a variety of cases resulting from mass disaster or criminal cases. This study was conducted to evaluate the most suitable tissues, method and sample size for processing of hard tissues prior to DNA isolation. We also evaluated the elapsed time after death in relation to the quantity of DNA extracted. Samples of hard tissues (37 teeth, 42 skull, 42 rib, and 39 nails) from 42 individuals aged between 50 and 83 years were used. The samples were taken from remains following forensic autopsy (from 2 days to 2 years after death). To evaluate the integrity of the nuclear DNA isolated, the percentage of allele calls for short tandem repeat profiles were compared between the hard tissues. DNA typing results indicated that until 1 month after death, any of the four hard tissue samples could be used as an alternative to teeth, allowing analysis of all of the loci. However, in terms of the sampling site, collection method and sample size adjustment, the rib appeared to be the best choice in view of the ease of specimen preparation. Our data suggest that the rib could be an alternative hard tissue sample for DNA analysis of human remains. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Likewise, in the Advanced Therapy Access Program (ATAP), where 290 patients were treated with 10 different viruses, no vector-related mortality was observed. However, as the patient population who received adenovirus treatments in ATAP represented heavily pretreated patients, often with very advanced disease, some patients died relatively soon after receiving their virus treatment mandating autopsy to investigate cause of death. Eleven such autopsies were performed and confirmed disease progression as the cause of death in each case. The regulatory requirement for investigating the safety of advanced therapy medical products presented a unique opportunity to study tissue samples collected as a routine part of the autopsies. Oncolytic adenoviral DNA was recovered in a wide range of tissues, including injected and noninjected tumors and various normal tissues, demonstrating the ability of the vector to disseminate through the vascular route. Furthermore, we recovered and cultured viable virus from samples of noninjected brain metastases of an intravenously treated patient, confirming that oncolytic adenovirus can reach tumors through the intravascular route. Data presented here give mechanistic insight into mode of action and biodistribution of oncolytic adenoviruses in cancer patients.\n\nRetinotomy using an erbium:YAG laser on human autopsy eyes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEllsworth, Lansing G.; Kramer, Theresa R.; Noecker, Robert J.; Snyder, Robert W.; Yarborough, J. Michael\n\n1994-06-01\n\nMid-IR lasers that operate near the absorption peak of water have a short penetration depth in ocular tissues. Ablation of tissue can be accomplished with minimal coagulative damage to underlying structures. We used an erbium:YAG laser equipped with a contact probe to create retinotomy sites in the human retina of eye bank eyes. An erbium:YAG laser (2.94 micrometers ) equipped with an infrared transmitting glass fiber and a sapphire tip (400 micrometers ) was used to directly ablate the surface of the retina. We administered both single and multiple pulses to the macula and peripheral retina using energy levels from 4 to 16 mJ per pulse. The retinas were then examined histopathologically to evaluate the extent of ablation and coagulative damage. Single pulses at low energy levels were noted to cause ablative damage to the nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer without a notable coagulative effect. The mean ablation depth at lower energy levels was less than the mean ablation depth at higher energy levels. Extensive laser application produced disruption of the retinal pigment epithelium, choroid and sclera. the erbium:YAG laser equipped with a contact probe is an effective means of creating retinotomies in human autopsy eyes. When used in the single pulse mode at lower energy levels, the erbium:YAG laser appears capable of removing superficial retinal layers without damaging deeper structures.\n\nSearching cause of death through different autopsy methods: A new initiative\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDas, Abhishek; Chowdhury, Ranadip\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA lawful disposal of human dead body is only possible after establishment of proper and valid cause of death. If the cause is obscure, autopsy is the only mean of search. Inadequacy and unavailability of health care facility often makes this situation more complicated in developing countries where many deaths remain unexplained and proper mortality statistics is missing, especially for infant and children. Tissue sampling by needle autopsy or use of various imaging technique in virtopsy have been tried globally to find out an easier alternative. An exclusive and unique initiative, by limited autopsy through tissue biopsy and body fluid analysis, has been taken to meet this dire need in African and some of Asian developing countries, as worldwide accepted institutional data are even missing or conflicting at times. Traditional autopsy has changed little in last century, consisting of external examination and evisceration, dissection of organs with identification of macroscopic pathologies and injuries, followed by histopathology. As some population groups have religious objections to autopsy, demand for minimally invasive alternative has increased of late. But assessment of cause of death is most important for medico-legal, epidemiological and research purposes. Thus minimally invasive technique is of high importance in primary care settings too. In this article, we have made a journey through different autopsy methods, their relevance and applicability in modern day perspective considering scientific research articles, textbooks and interviews.

Tumor samples obtained by autopsy provide an innovative way to study tumor progression, potentially aiding in the discovery of new treatments and increased survival rates. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to autopsies and develop guidelines for requesting autopsies for research purposes. Families of children treated for childhood cancer were referred by patient advocacy groups and surveyed about attitudes and experiences with research autopsies. From 60 interviews, barriers to autopsy and tumor banking were identified. An additional 14 interviews were conducted with medical and scientific experts. Ninety-three percent of parents of deceased children did or would have consented to a research autopsy if presented with the option; however, only half of these families were given the opportunity to donate autopsy tissue for research. The most significant barriers were the physicians' reluctance to ask a grieving family and lack of awareness about research opportunities. The value of donating tumor samples to research via an autopsy should be promoted to all groups managing pediatric cancer patients. Not only does autopsy tumor banking offer a potentially important medical and scientific impact, but the opportunity to contribute this Legacy Gift of autopsy tumor tissue also creates a positive outlet for the grieving family. Taking these findings into account, our multidisciplinary team has developed a curriculum addressing key barriers.

In our previous studies, we proposed a processing technique to detect changes in liver tissue in vivo. In this paper, we propose the evaluation of the relationship between liver disease and echo information using autopsy specimens of a human liver in vitro. It is possible to verify the function of a processing parameter clearly and to compare the processing result and the actual human liver tissue structure by in vitro experiment. In the results of our processing technique, information that did not obey a Rayleigh distribution from the echo signal of the autopsy liver specimens was extracted depending on changes in a particular processing parameter. The fiber tissue structure of the same specimen was extracted from a number of histological images of stained tissue. We constructed 3D structures using the information extracted from the echo signal and the fiber structure of the stained tissue and compared the two. By comparing the 3D structures, it is possible to evaluate the relationship between the information that does not obey a Rayleigh distribution of the echo signal and the fibrosis structure.\n\nAn independent evaluation of plutonium body burdens in populations near Los Alamos Laboratory using human autopsy data.\n\nPubMed\n\nGaffney, Shannon H; Donovan, Ellen P; Shonka, Joseph J; Le, Matthew H; Widner, Thomas E\n\n2013-06-01\n\nIn the mid-1940s, the United States began producing atomic weapon components at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). In an attempt to better understand historical exposure to nearby residents, this study evaluates plutonium activity in human tissue relative to residential location and length of time at residence. Data on plutonium activity in the lung, vertebrae, and liver of nearby residents were obtained during autopsies as a part of the Los Alamos Tissue Program. Participant residential histories and the distance from each residence to the primary plutonium processing buildings at LANL were evaluated in the analysis. Summary statistics, including Student t-tests and simple regressions, were calculated. Because the biological half-life of plutonium can vary significantly by organ, data were analyzed separately by tissue type (lung, liver, vertebrae). The ratios of plutonium activity (vertebrae:liver; liver:lung) were also analyzed in order to evaluate the importance of timing of exposure. Tissue data were available for 236 participants who lived in a total of 809 locations, of which 677 were verified postal addresses. Residents of Los Alamos were found to have higher plutonium activities in the lung than non-residents. Further, those who moved to Los Alamos before 1955 had higher lung activities than those who moved there later. These trends were not observed with the liver, vertebrae, or vertebrae:liver and liver:lung ratio data, however, and should be interpreted with caution. Although there are many limitations to this study, including the amount of available data and the analytical methods used to analyze the tissue, the overall results indicate that residence (defined as the year that the individual moved to Los Alamos) may have had a strong correlation to plutonium activity in human tissue. This study is the first to present the results of Los Alamos Autopsy Program in relation to residential status and location in Los Alamos.

The applicability of rhodium as a proper internal standard for Be was demonstrated in three types of biological matrices (i.e., femur, hair, lung tissues). Using HMI, it was possible to achieve instrumental detection limits and sensitivity of 0.6 ng L(-1) and 157 cps L ng(-1), respectively. Resilience to high salt matrices of the HMI setup was also highlighted using bone mimicking solution ([Ca(2+)] = 26 to 1,400 mg L(-1)), providing a 14-fold increase in tolerance and a 2.7-fold decrease in method detection limit compared to optimized experimental conditions obtained without the HMI configuration. Precision of the methodology to detect low levels of Be in autopsy samples was demonstrated using hair and blood certified reference materials. Be concentration ranging from 0.015 to 255 Î¼g kg(-1) in autopsy samples obtained from the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries were measured using the methodology presented.\n\nHIV DNA Is Frequently Present within Pathologic Tissues Evaluated at Autopsy from Combined Antiretroviral Therapy-Treated Patients with Undetectable Viral Loads\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLamers, Susanna L.; Rose, Rebecca; Maidji, Ekaterina; Agsalda-Garcia, Melissa; Nolan, David J.; Fogel, Gary B.; Salemi, Marco; Garcia, Debra L.; Bracci, Paige; Yong, William; Commins, Deborah; Said, Jonathan; Khanlou, Negar; Hinkin, Charles H.; Sueiras, Miguel Valdes; Mathisen, Glenn; Donovan, Suzanne; Shiramizu, Bruce; Stoddart, Cheryl A.; Singer, Elyse J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nABSTRACT HIV infection treatment strategies have historically defined effectiveness through measuring patient plasma HIV RNA. While combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce plasma viral load (pVL) to undetectable levels, the degree that HIV is eliminated from other anatomical sites remains unclear. We investigated the HIV DNA levels in 229 varied autopsy tissues from 20 HIV-positive (HIV+) cART-treated study participants with low or undetectable plasma VL and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL prior to death who were enrolled in the National Neurological AIDS Bank (NNAB) longitudinal study and autopsy cohort. Extensive medical histories were obtained for each participant. Autopsy specimens, including at least six brain and nonbrain tissues per participant, were reviewed by study pathologists. HIV DNA, measured in tissues by quantitative and droplet digital PCR, was identified in 48/87 brain tissues and 82/142 nonbrain tissues at levels >200 HIV copies/million cell equivalents. No participant was found to be completely free of tissue HIV. Parallel sequencing studies from some tissues recovered intact HIV DNA and RNA. Abnormal histological findings were identified in all participants, especially in brain, spleen, lung, lymph node, liver, aorta, and kidney. All brain tissues demonstrated some degree of pathology. Ninety-five percent of participants had some degree of atherosclerosis, and 75% of participants died with cancer. This study assists in characterizing the anatomical locations of HIV, in particular, macrophage-rich tissues, such as the central nervous system (CNS) and testis. Additional studies are needed to determine if the HIV recovered from tissues promotes the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, cancer, and atherosclerosis. IMPORTANCE It is well-known that combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce plasma HIV to undetectable levels; however, cART cannot completely clear HIV infection.

In our country (Turkey), it is estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 people have TB disease annually. The Ministry of Health could just determine 18,500 of these cases, and only 6500 patient could be treated effectively. According to the Tuberculosis Dispensary records, the incidence for TB in Turkey is 28/100,000. It is aimed to determine the infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis using acidoresistant bacilli microscopy, TB culture, and histopathological methods in tissue samples that were obtained from lungs of forensic cases whose autopsies had been performed in Council of Forensic Medicine Ankara Department Morgue Specialized Committee. A total of 3 tissue samples that were obtained from lungs of randomized 302 cases, were positive for TB in LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen medium. Granuloma with caseating necrosis was found in histopathological examination and acidoresistant (+) bacilli (1+, 2+, and 2+, respectively) in microscopically analysis were also demonstrated in this 3 tissue samples. For this reason, we think that autopsy workers have to be careful about tuberculosis during their autopsy working.\n\nPostmortem CT Angiography Compared with Autopsy: A Forensic Multicenter Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrabherr, Silke; Heinemann, Axel; Vogel, Hermann; Rutty, Guy; Morgan, Bruno; WoÅºniak, Krzysztof; Dedouit, Fabrice; Fischer, Florian; Lochner, Stefanie; Wittig, Holger; Guglielmi, Giuseppe; Eplinius, Franziska; Michaud, Katarzyna; Palmiere, Cristian; Chevallier, Christine; Mangin, Patrice; Grimm, Jochen M\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPurpose To determine if postmortem computed tomography (CT) and postmortem CT angiography help to detect more lesions than autopsy in postmortem examinations, to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and to define their indications. Materials and Methods Postmortem CT angiography was performed on 500 human corpses and followed by conventional autopsy. Nine centers were involved. All CT images were read by an experienced team including one forensic pathologist and one radiologist, blinded to the autopsy results. All findings were recorded for each method and categorized by anatomic structure (bone, organ parenchyma, soft tissue, and vascular) and relative importance in the forensic case (essential, useful, and unimportant). Results Among 18 654 findings, autopsies helped to identify 61.3% (11 433 of 18 654), postmortem CT helped to identify 76.0% (14 179 of 18 654), and postmortem CT angiography helped to identify 89.9% (16 780 of 18 654; P < .001). Postmortem CT angiography was superior to autopsy, especially at helping to identify essential skeletal lesions (96.1% [625 of 650] vs 65.4% [425 of 650], respectively; P < .001) and vascular lesions (93.5% [938 of 1003] vs 65.3% [655 of 1003], respectively; P < .001). Among the forensically essential findings, 23.4% (1029 of 4393) were not detected at autopsy, while only 9.7% (428 of 4393) were missed at postmortem CT angiography (P < .001). The best results were obtained when postmortem CT angiography was combined with autopsy. Conclusion Postmortem CT and postmortem CT angiography and autopsy each detect important lesions not detected by the other method. More lesions were identified by combining postmortem CT angiography and autopsy, which may increase the quality of postmortem diagnosis.

Metallothionein expression is induced by various heavy metals especially cadmium, mercury and zinc; MTs suppress toxicity of heavy metals by binding themselves to these metals. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the - 5 A/G metallothionein 2A (MT2A) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and Cd, Zn and Cu levels in the renal cortex from autopsy cases. MT2A core promoter region - 5 A/G SNP was analyzed by PCR-RFLP methodmoreÂ Â» using 114 autopsy kidney tissues and the genotype frequencies of this polymorphism were found as 87.7% homozygote typical (AA), 11.4% heterozygote (AG) and 0.9% homozygote atypical (GG). In order to assess the Cd, Zn and Cu levels in the same autopsy kidney tissues, a dual atomic absorption spectrophotometer system was used and the average levels of Cd, Zn and Cu were measured as 95.54 {+-} 65.58 {mu}g/g, 181.20 {+-} 87.72 {mu}g/g and 17.14 {+-} 16.28 {mu}g/g, respectively. As a result, no statistical association was found between the - 5 A/G SNP in the MT2A gene and the Zn and Cu levels in the renal cortex (p > 0.05), but considerably high accumulation of Cd was monitored for individuals having AG (151.24 {+-} 60.21 {mu}g/g) and GG genotypes (153.09 {mu}g/g) compared with individuals having AA genotype (87.72 {+-} 62.98 {mu}g/g) (p < 0.05). These results show that the core promoter region polymorphism of metallothionein 2A increases the accumulation of Cd in human renal cortex.Â«Â less\n\nMolecular identification of fungi found on decomposed human bodies in forensic autopsy cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwarz, Patrick; Dannaoui, Eric; Gehl, Axel; Felske-Zech, Heike; Birngruber, Christoph G; Dettmeyer, Reinhard B; Verhoff, Marcel A\n\n2015-07-01\n\nTo investigate which fungi can be found during forensic autopsies, a PubMed literature review was done in regard to fungal growth on decomposed human bodies. Unfortunately, the existing data is limited and not all fungi were identified to the species level. We, therefore, collected skin samples with macroscopically visible fungal growth from 23 autopsy cases in Germany and identified the fungi to the species level by molecular methods. The identified species included Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, which pose an allergenic risk, especially to persons with underlying lung diseases. Because safety standards are lacking, we recommend the use of respiratory protection during exhumations and forensic autopsies, when fungal growth is noted. With regard to the future, a database was set up which could possibly be used as a forensic tool to determine the time of death.\n\nImmunohistochemical distribution of chromogranin A in medicolegal autopsy materials.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshida, Chiemi; Ishikawa, Takaki; Michiue, Tomomi; Zhao, Dong; Komatsu, Ayumi; Quan, Li; Maeda, Hitoshi\n\n2009-04-01\n\nChromogranin A (CgA) was recently reported as a marker of various stress responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical distribution of CgA in human tissues in medicolegal autopsy cases as a basis for postmortem investigation of stress responses. The autopsy cases (n=30, within 48 h postmortem) comprised cases of mechanical asphyxia (n=15: strangulation, n=8; hanging, n=7) and acute myocardial infarction/ischemia (AMI, n=15). Routinely formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, including those of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, cardiac muscle, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, skeletal muscle, skin, thyroid gland, submandibular gland, pancreas, and adrenal gland, were stained with polyclonal anti-human CgA antibodies and CgA positivity was quantitatively examined. Localization of CgA immunopositivity was clearly demonstrated in specific cell components in all tissue sections. CgA was mainly observed in the anterior lobe of the pituitary, adrenal medulla, neurons and some gliocytes in the hypothalamus, submandibular gland, follicular epithelial cells and connective tissue in the thyroid gland and pancreatic islet cells. CgA immunopositivity showed no significant difference between mechanical asphyxia and AMI cases. Positivity was slightly higher in adenohypophysis, adrenal medullar, and pancreatic islet cells (approximately 50-80%) than in the thyroid and submandibular glands (approximately 30-60%); however, a large case difference was observed in hypothalamic CgA immunopositivity (0-100%). These findings suggest that hypothalamic CgA immunopositivity can be used as a marker for investigating individual differences in stress responses during the death process. Further investigation of other causes of death is needed.\n\nBiosafety considerations for autopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nNolte, Kurt B; Taylor, David G; Richmond, Jonathan Y\n\n2002-06-01\n\nAn autopsy may subject prosectors and others to a wide variety of infectious agents, including bloodborne and aerosolized pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other hazards include toxic chemicals (e.g., formalin, cyanide, and organophosphates) and radiation from radionuclides used for patient therapy and diagnosis. These risks can be substantially mitigated through proper assessment, personal protective equipment, appropriate autopsy procedures, and facility design.\n\nSelective, quantitative measurement of releasable synaptic zinc in human autopsy hippocampal brain tissue from Alzheimerâs disease patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBjorklund, Nicole L.; Sadagoparamanujam, V.M.; Taglialatela, Giulio\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAberrant central nervous system zinc homeostasis has been reported in Alzheimerâs disease (AD). However, there are conflicting reports describing zinc concentration either increased or decreased in the brain of AD patients. Such discrepancies may be due to differences in the brain area examined, zinc detection method, and/or tissue composition. Furthermore, detection and measurement of the releasable zinc pool in autopsy tissue is difficult and usually unreliable. Obtaining an adequate assessment of this releasable zinc pool is of particular significance in AD research in that zinc can coordinate with and stabilize toxic amyloid beta oligomers, which are believed to play a key role in AD neuropathology. In addition, zinc released into the synaptic cleft can interact with the postsynaptic neurons causing altered signaling and synaptic dysfunction, which is a well established event in AD. The method presented here combines two approaches, biochemical fractionation and atomic absorption spectrophotometry, to allow, in addition to extracellular zinc concentration, the reliable and quantitative measurement of zinc specifically localized in synaptic vesicles, which contain the majority of the neuronal releasable zinc. Using this methodology, we found that synaptic vesicle zinc concentrations were increased in AD hippocampi compared to age-matched controls and that this increase in releasable zinc matched increased concentration of zinc in the extracellular space.

Interatrial communication was also produced by a transar'rial approach in a live dog. In-vivo fresh canine cardiac tissues required power density of at feast 80, 90, and 110 watts/cm2 for vaporization of myocardial, vascular and valvular tissues respectively. The fiber tip to tissue distance (effective irradiation distance) for effective vaporization was less than I mm for vascular and valvular tissues and less than 4 mm for myocardium. Light microscopy showed four zones of histological damage common to all tissues - central crater surrounded by layers of charring, vacuolization and coagulation necorsis. Myocardium showed additionally a layer of normal appearing muscle cells (skip area) surrounded by a peripheral coagulation halo. Laser irradiation effects on valvular tissue showed the most lateral extension of coagulation necrosis. It is concluded that palliation and treatment of certain congenital heart defects by laser irradiation is anatomi-cally feasible and may be safe for in vivo application when low power output and short exposure time are used from a very short irradiation distance.\n\nImportance of tissue sampling, laboratory methods, and patient characteristics for detection of Pneumocystis in autopsied lungs of non-immunosuppressed individuals.\n\nPubMed\n\nVargas, S L; Ponce, C; Bustamante, R; CalderÃ³n, E; Nevez, G; De Armas, Y; Matos, O; Miller, R F; Gallo, M J\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo understand the epidemiological significance of Pneumocystis detection in a lung tissue sample of non-immunosuppressed individuals, we examined sampling procedures, laboratory methodology, and patient characteristics of autopsy series reported in the literature.

Experimental observations on human autopsy specimens.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoy, D S; Altman, P A; Case, R B; Trokel, S L\n\n1991-06-01\n\nThe interaction of laser radiation with the nucleus pulposus from autopsy specimens of human intervertebral disks was evaluated at different wavelengths (193 nm, 488 nm & 514 nm, 1064 nm, 1318 nm, 2150 nm, 2940 nm, and 10600 nm). A significant correlation of linear least squares fit of the mass ablated as a function of incident energy was found for all lasers used except the Excimer at 193 nm. The 2940-nm Erbium:YAG laser was most efficient in terms of mass of disk ablated per joule in the limited lower range where this wavelength was observed. At higher energy levels, the CO2 laser in the pulsed mode was most efficient. However, the Nd:YAG 1064-nm and 1318-nm lasers are currently best suited for percutaneous laser disk decompression because of the availability of usable waveguides. Carbonization of tissue with the more penetrating Nd:YAG 1064-nm laser increases the efficiency of tissue ablation and makes it comparable to the Nd:YAG 1318-nm laser.\n\nHuman fetal lung morphometry at autopsy with new modeling to quantitate structural maturity.\n\nPubMed\n\nLipsett, Jill\n\n2017-06-01\n\nTo demonstrate a simplified morphometric procedure, including a new model for acinar structural maturity, applicable to autopsy fetal lung and present reference values for these parameters. Cases with autopsy consent for research were studied. To simplify analysis only critical morphometric parameters were measured to allow calculation of gas-exchange surface area. A total of 58 fetuses, 16-40 weeks were included. Subjects were rejected with any condition predisposing to pulmonary hypo/hyperplasia, significant maceration, or if lung weight/bodyweight or microscopy identified pulmonary hypoplasia or lung growth disorders. Lungs were inflation fixed, weights and volumes determined, sampled, then returned to the body. Volume densities (V V ) of parenchyma/non-parenchyma and air-space/gas-exchange tissue, gas-exchange surface density (S V ), and total surface area (SA) were determined. The number, mean radius, and septal thickness of modeled airspace-spheres were calculated. Equations were generated for each parameter function of gestation and bodyweight. From 16 to 40-week weights and volumes increased as power functions from â¼4âg/mL to â¼90âg/mL. Parenchyma/non-parenchyma changed little-75:25 (16 weeks) to 71:29 (term). Parenchyma was 10% airspace:90% tissue early and 50:50 by term. Gas-exchange S V increased from 175 to 450âcm 2 /cm 3 and total SA increased from 0.059 to 4.793âm 2 . There were 3.31âÃâ10 6 airspace-spheres, 12âÂµ radius, septal thickness 30âÂµ at 16 weeks, increasing to 56.92âÃâ10 6 , 26âÂµ radius, septal thickness 13âÂµ by term. Morphometry can feasibly be performed at autopsy, providing more informative quantitative data on lung structural development than current methods utilized. This reference data set compares well with published data.

These indices correlate well with each other and with non-invasive measurements of total body fat and visceral adipose tissue. The indices generally show a strong correlation with cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Direct measurement of visceral adipose tissue by weight (VAW) from autopsy cases positively correlates with the anthropometric indices. VAW also positively correlates with fatty tissue thickness at separate locations, i.e. renal capsular and epicardial fatty tissue. VAW is positively correlated with the severity of cardiosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, but there is no significant difference in VAW between deaths from cardiovascular complications and other natural deaths. Different anthropometric indices and non-invasive methods have been used to estimate the total burden of body fat. Increased visceral adipose tissue is believed to involve elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and hypertension. At present, the optimal method to estimate the visceral and total amount of fat remains undecided. In the present study of 201 autopsy cases, direct measurement of visceral adipose tissue by weight (VAW) has been compared to common anthropometric indices, namely body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (W/Hip ratio), waist-to-height ratio (W/Height ratio), body adiposity index (BAI), waist circumference and abdominal wall thickness. The prevalence and severity of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and cause of death were also correlated with the anthropometric data. The outcome was that all anthropometric measurements showed a significant positive correlation with the weight of visceral adipose tissue, and the r-value of the comparison to waist circumference was the highest (râ=â0.82). Thickness of fatty tissue enveloping the kidneys and heart, as well as heart weight, was also\n\nInvestigations into distribution of lidocaine in human autopsy material.\n\nPubMed\n\nOertel, Reinhard; Arenz, Norman; Zeitz, Sten Gunnar; Pietsch, JÃ¶rg\n\n2015-08-01\n\nWith screening methods in the legal medicine drugs were often detected in autopsy material. In this study the antiarrhythmic and the local anesthetic drug lidocaine could be proved in fifty-one cases and determined in different autopsy materials. For the first time the comparison of so many distribution patterns of lidocaine in human compartments was possible. A liquid-liquid extraction procedure, a standard addition method and LC/MS/MS were used for analytics. The measured concentrations in blood were in the therapeutic range or lower. The time between lidocaine application and death was given in twenty-nine cases. These data were very helpful to estimate and interpret the distribution process of lidocaine between application and death. This time exerted a crucial influence on the distribution of lidocaine in the compartments. Most of the intravenous applicated lidocaine was found in heart blood after a very short time of distribution. Afterwards the highest concentrations were measured in brain. Later the highest concentration was found in the kidney samples or in urine. If the time between lidocaine application and death is known, the results of this study can be used to deepen the knowledge of its pharmacokinetics. If this time is unknown, the circumstances and the causes of death can be better explained.

Materials and Methods Five cadavers were subjected to whole-body, 16-channel MDCT and 3.0T MR imaging within two hours before an autopsy. A radiologist classified the MDCT and 3.0T MRI findings into major and minor findings, which were compared with autopsy findings. Results Most of the imaging findings, pertaining to head and neck, heart and vascular, chest, abdomen, spine, and musculoskeletal lesions, corresponded to autopsy findings. The causes of death that were determined on the bases of MDCT and 3.0T MRI findings were consistent with the autopsy findings in four of five cases. CT was useful in diagnosing fatal hemorrhage and pneumothorax, as well as determining the shapes and characteristics of the fractures and the direction of external force. MRI was effective in evaluating and tracing the route of a metallic object, soft tissue lesions, chronicity of hemorrhage, and bone bruises. Conclusion A postmortem MDCT combined with MRI is a potentially powerful tool, providing noninvasive and objective measurements for forensic investigations.

It is based on Federal Ministry of Justice records and German Parliament documents on transplantation legislation. Transplantation and autopsy legislation started with close ties in the 1970s. Viewing transplantation legislation as relevant for future autopsy regulation contributed to the decision to stall transplantation legislation, because the interests of the federal government and the medical profession converged to avoid subsequent restrictions on the practice of conducting autopsies and procuring tissues for transplantation. Sublegal norms were insufficient for the prosecution of the organ trade and area-wide transplantation regulation after the reunification of Germany.

Compared to other countries that have run brain banks for decades, South Korea has limited experience with brain banking; nationwide brain banks started only recently. The goal of this study is to provide provisional guidelines for brain autopsy for hospitals and institutes that have not accumulated sufficient expertise. We hope that these provisional guidelines will serve as a useful reference for pathologists and clinicians who are involved and interested in the brain bank system. Also, we anticipate updating the provisional guidelines in the future based on collected data and further experience with the practice of brain autopsy in South Korea.

Proteomic tools are potent for the assessment of protein stability post mortem. In this pilot study, the human temporal lobe biopsy specimen with chronic pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and autopsy specimen in control were separated by 2-DE. Using MALDI-TOF-MS and MS/MS, 375 protein spots were identified which were the products of 267 genes. Six down-regulated and 23 up-regulated protein spots in the autopsy specimen were ascertained after the gel image analysis with the ImageMaster software. A number of proteins that include neurotransmitter metabolic and glycolytic enzymes, cytoprotective proteins and cytoskeleton were found decreased while the precursor of apolipoprotein A-I increased in the TLE brain. We tried several methods to prepare the protein samples and found that DNase and RNase treatment, ultracentrifugation and Amersham clean-up kit purification can improve gel separation quality. This work optimized the sample preparation method and constructed a primary protein database of human temporal lobe and found some proteins with remarkable level change probably involved in the post-mortem process and chronic pharmacoresistant TLE pathogenesis.\n\n42 CFR 35.16 - Autopsies and other post-mortem operations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 1 2014-10-01 2014-10-01 false Autopsies and other post-mortem operations. 35.16 Section 35.16 Public Health PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MEDICAL CARE AND EXAMINATIONS HOSPITAL AND STATION MANAGEMENT General Â§ 35.16 Autopsies and other post-mortem...\n\n42 CFR 35.16 - Autopsies and other post-mortem operations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 1 2011-10-01 2011-10-01 false Autopsies and other post-mortem operations. 35.16 Section 35.16 Public Health PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MEDICAL CARE AND EXAMINATIONS HOSPITAL AND STATION MANAGEMENT General Â§ 35.16 Autopsies and other post-mortem...\n\n42 CFR 35.16 - Autopsies and other post-mortem operations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 1 2013-10-01 2013-10-01 false Autopsies and other post-mortem operations. 35.16 Section 35.16 Public Health PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MEDICAL CARE AND EXAMINATIONS HOSPITAL AND STATION MANAGEMENT General Â§ 35.16 Autopsies and other post-mortem...\n\n42 CFR 35.16 - Autopsies and other post-mortem operations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 1 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Autopsies and other post-mortem operations. 35.16 Section 35.16 Public Health PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MEDICAL CARE AND EXAMINATIONS HOSPITAL AND STATION MANAGEMENT General Â§ 35.16 Autopsies and other post-mortem...\n\n42 CFR 35.16 - Autopsies and other post-mortem operations.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-10-01\n\n... 42 Public Health 1 2012-10-01 2012-10-01 false Autopsies and other post-mortem operations. 35.16 Section 35.16 Public Health PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MEDICAL CARE AND EXAMINATIONS HOSPITAL AND STATION MANAGEMENT General Â§ 35.16 Autopsies and other post-mortem...\n\nQuantification of interstitial fluid on whole body CT: comparison with whole body autopsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nLo Gullo, Roberto; Mishra, Shelly; Lira, Diego A; Padole, Atul; Otrakji, Alexi; Khawaja, Ranish Deedar Ali; Pourjabbar, Sarvenaz; Singh, Sarabjeet; Shepard, Jo-Anne O; Digumarthy, Subba R; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Stone, James R\n\n2015-12-01\n\nInterstitial fluid accumulation can occur in pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal spaces, and subcutaneous tissue planes. The purpose of the study was to assess if whole body CT examination in a postmortem setting could help determine the presence and severity of third space fluid accumulation in the body. Our study included 41 human cadavers (mean age 61 years, 25 males and 16 females) who had whole-body postmortem CT prior to autopsy. All bodies were maintained in the morgue in the time interval between death and autopsy. Two radiologists reviewed the whole-body CT examinations independently to grade third space fluid in the pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, and subcutaneous space using a 5-point grading system. Qualitative CT grading for third space fluid was correlated with the amount of fluid found on autopsy and the quantitative CT fluid volume, estimated using a dedicated software program (Volume, Syngo Explorer, Siemens Healthcare). Moderate and severe peripheral edema was seen in 16/41 and 7/41 cadavers respectively. It is not possible to quantify anasarca at autopsy. Correlation between imaging data for third space fluid and the quantity of fluid found during autopsy was 0.83 for pleural effusion, 0.4 for pericardial effusion and 0.9 for ascites. The degree of anasarca was significantly correlated with the severity of ascites (p < 0.0001) but not with pleural or pericardial effusion. There was strong correlation between volumetric estimation and qualitative grading for anasarca (p < 0.0001) and pleural effusion (p < 0.0001). Postmortem CT can help in accurate detection and quantification of third space fluid accumulation. The quantity of ascitic fluid on postmortem CT can predict the extent of anasarca.\n\nComparison of whole-body post mortem 3D CT and autopsy evaluation in accidental blunt force traumatic death using the abbreviated injury scale classification.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaly, Barry; Abboud, Samir; Ali, Zabiullah; Sliker, Clint; Fowler, David\n\n2013-02-10\n\nAlthough 3D CT imaging data are available on survivors of accidental blunt trauma, little similar data has been collected and classified on major injuries in victims of fatal injuries. This study compared the sensitivity of post mortem computed tomography (PMCT) with that of conventional autopsy for major trauma findings classified according to the trauma Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). Whole-body 3D PMCT imaging data and full autopsy findings were analyzed on 21 victims of accidental blunt force trauma death. All major injuries were classified on the AIS scale with ratings from 3 (serious) to 6 (unsurvivable). Agreement between sensitivity of autopsy and PMCT for major injuries was determined. A total of 195 major injuries were detected (mean per fatality, 9.3; range, 1-14). Skeletal injuries by AIS grade included 37 grade 3, 45 grade 4, 12 grade 5, and 2 grade 6 major findings. Soft tissue injuries included 10 grade 3, 68 grade 4, 16 grade 5, and 5 grade 6 major findings. Of these, PMCT detected 165 (88 skeletal, 77 soft tissue), and autopsy detected 127 (59 skeletal, 68 soft tissue). PMCT agreed with autopsy in 86% and 76% of skeletal and soft tissue injuries, respectively. PMCT detected an additional 37 skeletal and 31 soft tissue injuries that were not identified at autopsy. Autopsy detected 8 skeletal and 22 soft tissue injuries that were not detected by PMCT. PMCT was more sensitive for skeletal (P=0.05) and head and neck region injury (P=0.043) detection. PMCT showed a trend for greater sensitivity than autopsy, but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.083). 3D PMCT detected significantly more skeletal injuries than autopsy and a similar number of soft tissue injuries to autopsy and promises to be a sensitive tool for detection and classification of skeletal injuries in fatal blunt force accidental trauma. Use of the AIS scale allows standardized categorization and quantification of injuries that contribute to death in such cases and allows more\n\n[Autopsies for fetal anomalies].\n\nPubMed\n\nKidron, Debora; Eidel, Jouly; Aviram, Rami\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFetal autopsies are effective in identifying the cause and/or mechanisms leading to death in cases of intrauterine fetal death. Autopsies for fetal anomalies are different. To summarize our experience with 569 autopsies of fetal anomalies which were performed during an 18-year period. A retrospective analysis of 569 autopsies of fetal anomalies was conducted, out of a total of 1067 fetal autopsies. The pregnancy weeks were 14 - 41. Among 569 cases, 88% were termination of pregnancies, 10% intrauterine death and 2% perinatal deaths. The diagnosis of a syndrome or disease process was made when a constellation of gross and/or histologic findings was met. Specific diagnoses were offered in cases of cystic diseases of kidneys, types of dwarfism, tumors and fetal hydrops. Teratogenic (acquired) processes, such as congenital infections, thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhages, were differentiated from malformations. In cases of multiple congenital anomalies, documentation of the entire spectrum of malformations facilitated the genetic counseling. First and foremost, the autopsy is performed in the interest of the parents, with their written consent and in accordance with limitations and requests which they pose. Autopsy results provide feedback to the prenatal imaging. They assist in focusing the genetic counseling. Autopsy reports provide tools of control for the health authorities. Autopsies for fetal anomalies are time consuming. They require skill and experience. They are helpfuL when the prenatal diagnosis raises differential diagnosis. They are Less helpful when the diagnosis is clear, i.e. chromosomal trisomy.\n\nThe problem with medical research on tissue and organ samples taken in connection with forensic autopsies in France.\n\nPubMed\n\nRougÃ©-Maillart, C; Dupont, V; Jousset, N\n\n2016-02-01\n\nCurrently, in France, it is legally impossible to conduct scientific research on tissue and organ samples taken from forensic autopsies. In fact, the law schedules the destruction of such samples at the end of the judicial investigation, and the common law rules governing cadaver research cannot be applied to the forensic context. However, nothing seems in itself to stand in the way of such research since, despite their specific nature, these samples from forensic autopsies could be subject, following legislative amendments, to common law relating to medical research on samples taken from deceased persons. But an essential legislative amendment, firstly to allow the Biomedicine Agency to become authorized to issue a research permit and secondly, to change the research conditions in terms of the non-opposition of the deceased to said research. Such an amendment would be a true breakthrough because it would allow teams to continue to move forward calmly in research, and allow this research to be placed within a legal framework, which would promote international exchanges.

Upon repatriation of a body, the legal investigation in the UK remains largely unchanged since the publication of the \"harmonisation of medico-legal autopsy rules\" (1999) and the passing of the Coroners and Justice Act (2009). We identified 44 cases within a 10-year period. An invasive autopsy had been performed abroad in 25 cases; an autopsy report was received prior to UK autopsy in one case. Seven cases showed incomplete evisceration; the absence of part or whole organs was recorded in 11 cases. Toxicology was performed abroad in five cases. Recurring technical difficulties related chiefly to embalming, including difficulty with dissection and noxious fumes. When an autopsy had been performed abroad, the time to UK inquest was prolonged by an average of seven months. A verdict of unlawful killing was returned in nine cases. The discussion expands on these issues, and attempts to offer reasoned explanation where possible. Two cases are used as exemplars to highlight difficulties to both the pathologist and Coroner. This casework remains rare but the potential problems include: absence of tissue; lack of information; technical difficulties; and a disproportionately high number of unlawful killings, making clear the need for experience and caution when making the post mortem examination.\n\nThe use of human samples obtained during medicolegal autopsies in research: An introduction to current conditions and initiatives in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsujimura-Ito, Takako; Inoue, Yusuke; Muto, Kaori; Yoshida, Ken-Ichi\n\n2017-04-01\n\nBackground Leftover samples obtained during autopsies are extremely important basic materials for forensic research. However, there are no established practices for research-related use of obtained samples. Objective This study discusses good practice for the secondary use of samples collected during medicolegal autopsies. Methods A questionnaire was posted to all 76 departments of forensic medicine performing medicolegal autopsies in Japan, and 48 responses were received (response rate: 63.2%). As a secondary analysis, we surveyed information provided on department websites. Results Ethical reviews conducted when samples were to be used for research varied greatly among departments, with 21 (43.8%) departments reporting 'fundamentally, all cases are subject to review', eight (16.7%) reporting 'only some are subject to review' and 17 (39.6%) reporting 'none are subject to review'. Information made available on websites indicated that 11 departments had a statement of some type to bereaved families about the potential research use of human samples obtained during autopsies. Nine of these included a notice stating that bereaved families may revoke their consent for use. Several departments used an opt-out system. Conclusion There is no common practice in the field of legal medicine on the ethical use for medical research of leftover samples from medicolegal autopsies. The trust of not only bereaved families but also society in general is required for the scientific validity and social benefits of medical studies using leftover samples from medicolegal autopsies through the use of opt-out consenting and offline and online dissemination and public-relations activities.\n\nExpansion of the Multi-Link Frontierâ¢ Coronary Bifurcation Stent: Micro-Computed Tomographic Assessment in Human Autopsy and Porcine Heart Samples\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKralev, Stefan; Haag, Benjamin; Spannenberger, Jens; Lang, Siegfried; Brockmann, Marc A.; Bartling, Soenke; Marx, Alexander; Haase, Karl-Konstantin; Borggrefe, Martin; SÃ¼selbeck, Tim\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions remains challenging, beyond the introduction of drug eluting stents. Dedicated stent systems are available to improve the technical approach to the treatment of these lesions. However dedicated stent systems have so far not reduced the incidence of stent restenosis. The aim of this study was to assess the expansion of the Multi-Link (ML) Frontierâ¢ stent in human and porcine coronary arteries to provide the cardiologist with useful in-vitro information for stent implantation and selection. Methodology/Principal Findings Nine ML Frontierâ¢ stents were implanted in seven human autopsy heart samples with known coronary artery disease and five ML Frontierâ¢ stents were implanted in five porcine hearts. Proximal, distal and side branch diameters (PD, DD, SBD, respectively), corresponding opening areas (PA, DA, SBA) and the mean stent length (L) were assessed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). PD and PA were significantly smaller in human autopsy heart samples than in porcine heart samples (3.54Â±0.47 mm vs. 4.04Â±0.22 mm, pâ=â0.048; 10.00Â±2.42 mm2 vs. 12.84Â±1.38 mm2, pâ=â0.034, respectively) and than those given by the manufacturer (3.54Â±0.47 mm vs. 4.03 mm, pâ=â0.014). L was smaller in human autopsy heart samples than in porcine heart samples, although data did not reach significance (16.66Â±1.30 mm vs. 17.30Â±0.51 mm, pâ=â0.32), and significantly smaller than that given by the manufacturer (16.66Â±1.30 mm vs. 18 mm, pâ=â0.015). Conclusions/Significance Micro-CT is a feasible tool for exact surveying of dedicated stent systems and could make a contribution to the development of these devices. The proximal diameter and proximal area of the stent system were considerably smaller in human autopsy heart samples than in porcine heart samples and than those given by the manufacturer. Special consideration should be given to the stent deployment procedure (and to the follow-up) of dedicated\n\nPostmortem computed tomography as an adjunct to autopsy for analyzing fatal motor vehicle crash injuries: results of a pilot study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSochor, Mark R; Trowbridge, Matthew J; Boscak, Alexis; Maino, John C; Maio, Ronald F\n\n2008-09-01\n\nDetailed fatal injury data after fatal motor vehicle crashes (MVC) are necessary to improve occupant safety and promote injury prevention. Autopsy remains the principle source of detailed fatal injury data. However, procedure rates are declining because of a range of technical, ethical, and religious concerns. Postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) is a potential alternative or adjunct to autopsy which is increasingly used by forensic researchers. However, there are only limited data regarding the utility of PMCT for analysis of fatal MVC injuries. We performed whole body PMCT and autopsy on six subjects fatally injured in MVC in a single county in Michigan. All injuries detected by either method were coded using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). Severe injuries, defined as AIS 3 or higher (AIS 3+), were tallied for each forensic procedure to allow a comparison of relative diagnostic performance. A total of 46 AIS 3+ injuries were identified by autopsy and PMCT for these cases. The addition of PMCT to autopsy increased overall detection of AIS 3+ injuries (all types) by 28%. PMCT detected 27% more AIS 3+ skeletal injuries than autopsy but 25% less soft tissue injuries. Use of PMCT improves the detection of AIS 3+ injuries after fatal MVC compared with isolated use of autopsy and also produces a highly detailed permanent objective record. PMCT appears to improve detection of skeletal injury compared with autopsy but is less sensitive than autopsy for the detection of AIS 3+ soft tissue injuries. Neither autopsy nor PMCT identified all AIS 3+ injuries revealed by the combination of the two methodologies. This suggests that PMCT should be used as an adjunct to autopsy rather than a replacement whenever feasible.\n\nShort history of the autopsy. Part I. From prehistory to the middle of the 16th century.\n\nPubMed\n\nGulczyÅski, Jacek; Izycka-Swieszewska, Ewa; Grzybiak, Marek\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe present the first part of work concerning the history of autopsy. During the development of the pathology the role of autopsy was changing. The attitude towards the human body was often a result of struggles between human will to learn and religious beliefs. The knowledge was built upon religious procedures (mummification) through medical and surgical care of the victims of fights and wars and first autopsies. Until the 13th century dissections were seldom performed, sometimes in public. The aims varied from strictly scientific and practical (surgery) to artistic (human body in arts). Later on physicians were learning how to draw conclusions from autopsy results including malformations, pathologies, diseases, causes of death in order to try to put right diagnoses.\n\nAutopsy practice in forensic pathology - evidence-based or experience-based? a review of autopsies performed on victims of traumatic asphyxia in a mass disaster.\n\nPubMed\n\nColville-Ebeling, Bonnie; Freeman, Michael; Banner, Jytte; Lynnerup, Niels\n\n2014-02-01\n\nCurrent autopsy practice in forensic pathology is to a large extent based on experience and individual customary practices as opposed to evidence and consensus based practices. As a result there is the potential for substantial variation in how knowledge is applied in each case. In the present case series, we describe the variation observed in autopsy reports by five different pathologists of eight victims who died simultaneously from traumatic asphyxia due to compression during a human stampede. We observed that there was no mention of the availability of medical charts in five of the reports, of potentially confounding resuscitation efforts in three reports, of cardinal signs in seven reports and of associated injuries to a various degree in all reports. Further, there was mention of supplemental histological examination in two reports and of pre-autopsy radiograph in six reports. We inferred that reliance on experience and individual customary practices led to disparities between the autopsy reports as well as omissions of important information such as cardinal signs, and conclude that such reliance increases the potential for error in autopsy practice. We suggest that pre-autopsy data-gathering and the use of check lists specific to certain injury causes are likely to result in less deviation from evidence-based practices in forensic pathology. Pre-autopsy data-gathering and check lists will help ensure a higher degree of standardization in autopsy reports thus enhancing the quality and accuracy of the report as a legal document as well as rendering it more useful for data-gathering efforts.

Virtopsy is a term extracted from two words \"virtual\" and \"autopsy.\" It employs imaging methods that are routinely used in clinical medicine such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the field of autopsy, to find the reason for death. Virtopsy is a multi-disciplinary technology that combines forensic medicine and pathology, roentgenology, computer graphics, biomechanics, and physics. It is rapidly gaining importance in the field of forensics. This approach has been recently used by forensic odontologists, but yet to make its own mark in the field.

This decline may to an extent depend on the attitude of the physicians. To evaluate the attitude of resident doctors towards the practice of clinical autopsy and to determine their role in the decline of clinical autopsy. We carried out a survey of the attitude of resident doctors undergoing training in the various clinical departments of our teaching hospital towards clinical autopsy practice. This survey was by means of a structured randomly distributed questionnaire. Questions were asked on their willingness to request for autopsy, the number of autopsies that they have requested for so far, what hinders them from requesting for autopsy, the level of participation at autopsy and the importance of autopsies in the health care delivery system Eighteen (30%) out of 60 resident doctors attributed their inability to request for autopsy on their not being in direct control of the patients, while 16 (26.7%) found it difficult to get consent from the relatives. Seventeen per cent of them gave reason of not being able to obtain report from the pathologist, 13.3% said it was difficult to get pathologist to perform autopsy on time while only 11% said they knew the diagnosis in most of their cases. Almost all the resident doctors (98.5%) agreed that autopsy is a necessary procedure and is important for their training and health care delivery system Autopsy rate can increase if the resident doctors receive more blessings to request for autopsy from their consultants. Increased exposure to autopsies and education with regards to the benefits of autopsies at both the undergraduate and post graduate level will contribute to improvement in the rate of clinical autopsy.\n\nPrevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in brain and heart by Immunohistochemistry in a hospital-based autopsy series in Durango, Mexico.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlvarado-Esquivel, Cosme; SÃ¡nchez-Anguiano, Luis Francisco; Mendoza-Larios, Alejandra; HernÃ¡ndez-Tinoco, JesÃºs; PÃ©rez-Ochoa, JosÃ© Francisco; Antuna-Salcido, Elizabeth Irasema; RÃ¡bago-SÃ¡nchez, Elizabeth; Liesenfeld, Oliver\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe presence of tissue cysts of Toxoplasma gondii has only poorly been investigated in autopsy series.

Autopsies have yielded information at tissue levels in fatal CM, but new insights into critical pathogenetic processes have emerged from neuroimaging studies, which, unlike autopsy-based studies, permit serial observations over time and allow comparisons between fatal cases and survivors. Brain swelling has emerged as the major risk factor for death, and, among survivors, brain volume diminishes spontaneously over 24-48 hours. Studies of life-threatening and fatal malaria are suggesting new approaches to identifying and caring for those at highest risk; potential adjuvants should be evaluated and implemented where they are most needed.

This situation will be unimportant if the former wasn't the 42nd Viceroy of New Spain; his autopsy showed a situs inversus totalis, and probably this is the first scientific report of such malformation. For many years the report by Mathew Baillie (1761-1823) of an autopsy with the same findings as the first of its kind was believed, but actually the former almost three decades earlier was performed. In 1688 Jean M. Mery (1645-1722) at the Paris Academy of Medicine gave a talk reporting autopsy findings of the same malformations. Some aspects of the life of both personages are described, the autopsy report is showed and a short history about postmortem studies are mentioned mainly those made in Spain and New Spain. Through many centuries a very close relationship has been kept and medicine has not been the exception, in the field of human pathology in the middle third of the 20th century a distinguished pathologist, Dr. Isaac Costero-Tudanca, migra"
