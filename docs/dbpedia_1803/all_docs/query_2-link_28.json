Although the cause of the dysfunction varies from mutations in channels for potassium and/or calcium to progressive degeneration of cerebellar tissuespecific neurons, the neurological signs and symptoms of ataxia are similar. The treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause, and it could be managed by pharmacological treatments and through physical therapy and occupational therapy. The treatment may ameliorate the signs of ataxia, but it is not likely to eliminate them entirely. In this book, the authors present current research in the study of the causes, symptoms and treatments on ataxia. Chapter 1 - Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is characterized by progressive neurovascular degeneration, immunodeficiency, impaired organogenesis, premature aging, endocrine dysfunction, and cancer proneness. Dedicated efforts have greatly advanced their understanding of the complex biochemical, molecular and cellular defects associated with AT. However, there is still no cure for the disease. The gene mutated in AT, ATM (AT mutated), encodes a 350-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase that functions upstream in the p53 signaling pathway. Activation of the ATM-p53 pathway following exposure to biologically relevant doses of ionizing radiation results in transcriptional activation of p21WAF1 (hereafter p21), a multifunctional protein that downregulates apoptosis and switches on the stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) program. Recent evidence indicates that ATM interacts with p21 to counteract MDM2, the major negative regulator of p53, to positively control the specific activity of p53 as a transcription factor. ATM also plays an important role in the sustained upregulation of p21 and maintenance of the SIPS phenotype at late times after genotoxic insult. In view of these properties of ATM and p21, AT cells would be expected to primarily undergo apoptosis and not SIPS in response to genotoxic stress. To the contrary, skin fibroblasts cultured from AT patients show a low threshold for both replicative senescence and ionizing radiation-induced SIPS when compared to normal fibroblasts. In this chaper, the authors review these and related findings with AT and highlight compelling evidence that argues against the widely held notion that activation of the ATMp53 pathway by DNA-damaging agents triggers apoptosis. In addition, they outline studies with eicosanoids and antioxidants that support therapeutic approaches for this multifaceted disorder.\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

ATM plays a central role in regulating the signaltransduction pathway activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks and is involved in the control of the intracellular redox status homeostasis. The hallmarks of the disease are related to the progressive neurological dysfunction, especially affecting the cerebellum and resulting in uncoordinated and ataxic movements associated to a deterioration of gross and fine motor skills. The onset of neurological signs is usually by approximately 2-4 years of age. The overall phenotype consists of oculo-cutaneous teleangiectasia, immunodeficiency, high incidence of neoplasms and hypersensitivity to ionising radiations. The neurodegeneration is progressive and greatly impairs the quality of life, invariably leading to confinement of patients to wheelchair. The cerebellar damage is associated to dystrophic changes of dendrites and axons of Purkinje cells. Death usually occurs by the 3rd decade of life for pulmonary infections or neoplasms. Currently, there is no effective treatment for A-T, but only supportive care aimed to halt progressive neurodegenerative changes. Many attempts to relief the neurological symptoms have so far been made: antioxidants were promising, but only modest improvement has been observed. Aminoglycosides have been proposed for the correction of ATM gene function by read-through of premature termination codons, while further attempts have been made with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to redirect and restore normal splicing. Some encouraging results on neurological symptoms have been obtained with short courses of oral betamethasone, even though the beneficial effect is drugdependent. Aim of this chapter is to report on the molecular basis, clinical features and diagnostic process of A-T paying a special attention to the therapeutic approach so far described in the attempt to halt progressive degeneration. Chapter 3 - Ion channels are membrane proteins that allow the selected and concerted movement of ions across cell membrane that is otherwise relatively impermeable to ions. These proteins are expressed in virtually every cell type, where they play key physiological roles. Thus, it is not surprising that ion channels dysfunction causes disease in animals and humans. The term channelopathy (CP) was coined less than two decades ago to identify ion channel diseases. To date, a large group of channelopathies have been identified and new ones are continuously being discovered; therefore, they represent a heavy burden on society. Chapter 4 - Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Friedreich Ataxia and other hereditary ataxias. In some cases, mitochondrial DNA primary genetic abnormalities (i.e., myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers syndrome [MERRF}; neuropathy, ataxia and pigmentary retinopathy syndrome [NARP]; Kearns-Sayre syndrome) or secondary mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e., due to mitochondrial polymerase POLG1 gene mutation or coenzyme Q10 deficiency) can directly cause ataxia. In this chapter, the authors revise the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in hereditary ataxias, and they discuss the welldefined “mitochondrial ataxias”. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders caused by impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The effects of mutations which affect the respiratory chain may be multisystemic, with involvement of visual and auditory pathways, heart, central nervous system, and skeletal muscle. Genetic ataxias other from well-defined mitochondrial ataxias and Friedreich ataxia will not be extensively discussed here, but the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in some of these diseases will be briefly reviewed. Chapter 5 - Epidemics of an acute ataxic syndrome occur annually in the rainy season in parts of West Africa, characterized by cerebellar ataxia, ocular abnormalities and impairment of consciousness, The onset of symptoms is usually shortly after a meal. The epidemics have\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012. ProQuest Ebook\n\nCopyright © 2012.

Detailed epidemiological and dietary studies have indicated that the seasonal ataxic syndrome is a thiamine deficiency state similar to Wernicke’s encephalopathy, occurring in poor, undernourished individuals who are mildly thiamine-deficient because of subsistence on a monotonous diet of cassava (manihot esculenta) meals. These individuals then suffer an acute exacerbation of thiamine deficiency from heat-stable thiaminases present in the Anaphe venata larvae, an invariable component of the last meals eaten prior to symptom onset. The annual period of availability of the Anaphe larvae coincides with the seasonal occurrence of the seasonal ataxic syndrome. This syndrome is the only thiamine-deficiency state known to be caused by thiaminases in insects. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, etiological mechanisms, therapy and control of the seasonal ataxic syndrome will be discussed in this chapter. Chapter 6 - The group of hereditary ataxias is represented by different modes of inheritance, such as X-linked, mitochondrial, autosomal dominant and the autosomal recessive ataxias. This chapter will provide an overview of the autosomal recessive group, by describing those that are best defined. For each disorder, the clinical manifestations will be described, allowing a better definition and recognition of the symptoms. Then, the causative gene and the mechanisms leading to the disease will be discussed. Currently available treatments and/or potential therapeutic targets will also be outlined. The most frequent recessive ataxias will be covered: Friedreich’s Ataxia, Ataxia-Telangiectasia, Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, Autosomal Recessive Cerebellar Ataxia type 1 and type 2, Ataxia with Oculomotor Apraxia type 1 and type 2 and Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency. Chapter 7 - Hereditary ataxias constitute a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of rare neurological disorders that cannot be distinguished solely by clinical criteria, thus demanding a subtype confirmation by molecular diagnosis. Enclosed in this group are spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), which are autosomal dominant disorders. In several SCAs, the causative genes display age-dependent patterns of penetrance, implying that the a posteriori risk of being a carrier diminishes with aging of at-risk individuals that remain asymptomatic. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as SCA3, corresponds to the most frequent form of SCA. Similarly to other SCAs, named “polyglutamine” ataxias (e.g., SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7, SCA17 and DRPLA), MJD is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat motif in the coding region of its causative gene. In this particular case, more than 52 CAG repeats in exon 10 of the ATXN3 gene (14q32.1) are necessary for disease expression. Despite the inverse correlation between the size of the CAG tract and the age at onset, the causative mutation only partially (50-75%) explains the observed variation in phenotype. Therefore, precise predictions of the age at onset are currently impossible. Results from recent research studies are pointing to the involvement of other factors, namely additional genetic variability related to the causative gene itself (e.g., generated by alternative splicing) and/or modifier genes. The knowledge of such factors may not only enable improvements of phenotype predictions, but may also raise hypotheses of new targets for gene therapy. The present chapter will focus on MJD, using it as a paradigm to demonstrate multiple roles and usefulness of genetics for a vaster group of neurodegenerative disorders. Chapter 8 - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is a clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, peripheral neuropathy, pyramidal dysfunction and movement disorders. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance and it results from a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the protein coding region of the\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

Early neuropathological and neuroimaging studies mostly concentrated on the cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord and basal ganglia; however, recent observations have demonstrated a more widespread cerebral involvement in SCA3. Visual analysis usually displays atrophy of the pons, cerebellar peduncles, frontal and temporal lobes, globus pallidus, as well as decreased anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the midbrain and decrease anteroposterior diameter of the medulla oblongata. Brain SPECT showed perfusion abnormalities in the parietal lobes, inferior portion of the frontal lobes, mesial and lateral portions of the temporal lobes, basal ganglia, and cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, while 18F-Dopa uptake (PET) was significantly decreased in the cerebellum, brainstem and nigro-striatal dopaminergic system, cerebral cortex and the striatum. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the deep white matter demonstrated changes suggestive of axonal dysfunction in normal appearing white matter. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies have conflicting results probably reflecting differences in sample sizes and characteristics. Different studies using texture analysis, manual volumetry and VBM demonstrated thalamic involvement in SCA3. The objective of this review is to discuss neuroimaging findings in SCA3 and how they contribute to a better understanding of the disease pathophysiology and future research directions. Chapter 9 - People affected by ataxia, a genetic neurological disorder, have problems with coordination. Ataxia is the principal symptom of a group of neurological disorders known as cerebellar ataxias. Most of them are progressive. In ataxia, a neurodegenerative process leads to changes in a motor cortex responsible for balance and coordination. Recently several genes that cause autosomal dominant ataxia development were identified. These abnormal genes share a common ability to produce abnormal ataxin protein sequences that affect nerve cells in the cerebellum and spinal cord. Here, using signal processing methods they analysed ataxin proteins and identified the characteristic features corresponding to their biological activities. The Resonant Recognition Model (RRM) is a physico-mathematical approach developed for analysis of protein interactions. By incorporating Smoothed Pseudo Wigner - Ville distribution (SPWV) in the RRM, the authors can predict locations of active/binding sites along the protein molecule. The findings of this study showed that their computational predictions correspond closely with the experimentally identified locations of the active regions for the selected ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 protein groups. They also present and discuss the results of possible interactions between the ataxin-1 and growth factor independent transcriptional regulator-1 (Gfi-1) proteins known to be responsible for the selective Purkinje cell degeneration in ataxia disorder. In addition, the authors demonstrate that by using their recently developed protein classification methodology, they can distinguish between different ataxin protein functional groups that correspond to different neurological disorders. By employing Hierarchical classification methodology and using the Euclidian distance as a measure of the distance between vectors representing the distribution of amino acid residues along the ataxin proteins, it is possible to extract ataxin proteins’ specific features into an adjoin 10-dimensional vector that represents the distribution of electron ion potentials along a proteins’ backbone, and thus classify ataxin proteins by their different functionalities. The developed classification system is tested here on known ataxin proteins. The results obtained provide a valuable insight into the functional performance of ataxin proteins. The presented novel computational approach can be used to predict unknown protein-protein interactions of ataxin with other proteins that can potentially influence its function and thus, contribute to ataxia disorder development.\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

Nna1 gene expression in the hmPCD brain is suppressed similar to that in the authentic pcd mutant mice. The influence of the causal allele in the hmPCD is considerably milder than the previously described alleles of the pcd mouse strains. The homozygous mutants of hmPCD develop a progressive but moderate ataxia that becomes apparent within the first two months of life. The major pathology in the mutant hamster is substantial corticocerebellar atrophy, which is attributable to primary loss of Purkinje neurons. The characteristic discordant movement can be quantitatively assessed by several behavioral tests; thus, the hmPCD would be applicable to study the effectiveness of pharmacological agents for ataxia. Recently, the authors demonstrated that daily administrations of NK-4, a neurotrophic cyanine dye compound, considerably delayed the onset of ataxia in the hmPCD. The behavioral outcomes were well supported by the histological findings of the cerebellum. NK-4 significantly suppressed degenerative loss of Purkinje neurons, which resulted in reduced cerebellar atrophy. Their results suggest that the hmPCD is a unique animal model for validating the efficacy of drugs targeting spinocerebellar ataxia and identify NK-4 as a promising candidate. Chapter 11 - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the ataxin-1 gene and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and progressive motor deterioration. The ataxin-1 protein is involved in transcription and RNA processing. SCA1 pathogenesis appears to be related to a gain-of-function effect that is caused by toxic mutant ataxin-1-derived aggregates or cellular dysfunction through an abnormal interaction between mutated and normal proteins. Recent studies have clarified the molecular mechanisms of SCA1 pathogenesis, which provide direction for future treatments. Therapeutic hope has come from observations including the reduction of aggregates and alleviation of the pathogenic phenotype by the application of potent inhibitors and RNA interference. However, no treatment is currently available for SCA1 disease. In this chapter, the authors discuss the potential of stem cells as a therapeutic approach to SCA1.\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

Afflicted patients are also prone to lymphoproliferative neoplasia and respond untowardly to radiotherapy for cancer treatment [Paterson and Smith, 1979; Gatti et al., 1991; Khanna, 2000]. Pronounced radiosensitivity extends to the cellular level in vitro. On exposure to ionizing radiation, for example, cultured AT cells display hypersensitivity in the clonogenic survival assay, excessive genetic instability, impaired activation of cell cycle checkpoints, and defective DNA repair [Paterson and Smith, 1979; Brown et al., 1999; Kühne et al., 2004]. The disease is caused by a single gene, called ATM (AT mutated), which encodes a 350-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase. The ATM protein functions upstream in the DNA-damage surveillance network that is activated after exposure to ionizing radiation and other agents that induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Figure 1). Exposure to such agents results in ATM-dependent activation of the p53 tumor suppressor, which in turn transcriptionally activates p21WAF1 (hereafter p21) and a host of other genes. Both p53 and p21 are multifunctional proteins and play central roles in determining the fate of a cell following genotoxic stress in terms of survival, apoptotic cell death, and a growth-arrested state called stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). The p21 protein also participates in feedback loops that control the function of both ATM and p53.\n\nFigure 1. Responses triggered by ionizing radiation in normal human fibroblasts. DNA DSBs induced by ionizing radiation trigger the rapid activation of ATM which elicits a series of post-translational modifications on p53 that contribute to its stabilization, nuclear accumulation and biochemical activation. ATM also contributes to the activation of ATR and DNA-PKcs. Collectively, these four tumor suppressors and their downstream effectors regulate cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and cell fate in terms of survival, apoptosis, and growth arrest (e.g., SIPS).\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

We focus on findings with human normal, ATM-deficient (AT) and p53-deficient [Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)] fibroblast strains. One of our objectives is to highlight studies that challenge the widely held notion that activation of the ATM network by ionizing radiation triggers apoptotic cell death. In addition, we outline discoveries that support therapeutic approaches for some of the symptoms associated with AT. Specifically, we discuss the following topics: ATM activation ATM substrates p53 structure, activation and function Roles of ATM and p53 in DNA repair Multiple functions of p21 in the ATM network Sequential waves of p53 activation by DNA damage ATM-dependent senescence ATM-independent senescence Role of ATM in preventing escape from SIPS: a novel tumor suppressor function beyond p53?  Potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of AT\n\n        \n\nCopyright © 2012.

The ATMand Rad3-related (ATR) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) proteins also belong to this family of kinases and play important roles in DNA damage response pathways [Shiloh, 2003]. In unstressed cells ATM exists as a dimer, is not phosphorylated and is present throughout the nucleus. ATM is constitutively associated with protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), presumably to ensure that ATM is not inappropriately activated [Lavin, 2008]. Activation of ATM is a complex process that involves the relaxation of chromatin as a consequence of a DNA DSB. After exposure to ionizing radiation, which leads to the formation of DSBs, PP2A dissociates from ATM and loses its activity. ATM is then rapidly monomerized post-irradiation and is autophosphorylated on at least three sites: Ser367, Ser1893 and Ser1981 [Lavin, 2008]. Some pool of ATM monomer molecules are recruited to the sites of DSBs [Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003]. The MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) complex is of structural and functional importance during the early DSB response, by tethering DNA ends and recruiting ATM [Horejsi et al., 2004; Costanzo et al., 2004]. Activation of ATM can also be mediated by 53BP1 through an MRN-independent mechanism [Zgheib et al., 2005].\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012. ProQuest Ebook\n\n4\n\nRazmik Mirzayans and David Murray\n\nATM SUBSTRATES ATM is activated in every phase of the cell cycle and phosphorylates a host of substrates on their serine or threonine residues that are followed by a glutamine. These include p53 (Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, and Ser46), CHK2 (Ser33, Ser35, Thr68), MDM2 (Ser395), WRN (Ser1058, Ser1141, Ser1292) [Ammazzalorso et al., 2010], BRCA1 (Ser1387, Ser1423), the histone H2A variant H2AX (Ser139) [Kurz and Lees-Miller, 2004], and DNA-PKcs (Thr2609) [Chen et al., 2007]. In addition, ATM activates ATR-CHK1 signaling, enabling the cells to respond to DNA strand breaks with coordinated, highly modulated outputs [Adams et al., 2006; Cuadrado et al., 2006; Jazayeri et al., 2006; Myers and Cortez, 2006]. An assessment of the functions of ATM substrates and ATM interacting proteins is beyond the scope of the current article and the reader is referred to previous reviews [e.g., Shiloh, 2003; Meulmeester et al., 2005; Lavin, 2008; Pichierri et al., 2011]. In what follows, we outline the multiple functions of p53 and its downstream effector p21 in the ATM signaling network.\n\nCopyright © 2012. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nP53 STRUCTURE, ACTIVATION AND FUNCTION Human p53 is a 393 amino acid (53 kDa) polypeptide consisting of five structural and functional domains: an N-terminal acidic transcriptional transactivation domain, a prolinerich regulatory domain, a central DNA-binding domain, a tetramerization domain, and a Cterminal domain involved in the regulation of DNA binding (Figure 2). The N-terminal domain is required for activating p53-inducible genes. The proline-rich domain is responsible for interaction with pro-apoptotic proteins, resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling. The central domain facilitates sequence-specific binding of the protein to p53 response elements in DNA. The tetramerization domain is comprised of a -strand, a tight turn, and an -helix, through which p53 monomers interact to form dimers, and dimers interact to form tetramers. Tetramerization is indispensable for the ability of p53 to function as a transcription factor.\n\nFigure 2. Structure and posttranscriptional modification of the p53 protein.

Turnover of p53 is mediated by ubiquitin ligases such as MDM2, MDM4, Pirh2 and Cop1 [Meek, 2004]. Each of these proteins acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase that results in ubiquitination of p53 and its degradation. Altered chromatin structure, DNA damage, and other forms of stress trigger a series of post-translational modifications on p53 that contribute to its stabilization, nuclear accumulation and biochemical activation [Ljungman, 2000; Meek, 2004]. Different sites in p53 undergo phosphorylation or acetylation, contributing to induction of the p53 response [Meek, 2004]. The phosphorylation sites Ser15, Thr18 and Ser20 are critical for protein stabilization. Ser15 phosphorylation primes the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr18 and Ser20, both of which lie within close proximity of the MDM2 binding site. Concomitant phosphorylation of p53 at these two sites, and of MDM2 at Ser395, mediated by ATM, interrupts MDM2-p53 interaction, thereby attenuating the inhibitory action of MDM2 on p53. Moreover, phosphorylation of p53 (Ser15, Thr18 and Ser20) stimulates recruitment of factors (e.g., p300, CBP, P/CAF) that contribute to p53 stabilization through acetylation of a cluster of C-terminal lysine residues in p53 that are normally targets for ubiquitination [Li et al., 2002]. Most of the responses controlled by p53 are attributed to transcriptional activation of p53-target genes in general, and p21 in particular [Roninson et al., 2001; Lane, 2004; Mirzayans et al., 2005]. As discussed below, in human fibroblast strains and solid tumorderived cell lines, the protein encoded by this gene (p21) down-regulates apoptosis, activates cell cycle checkpoints, and switches on the SIPS program in response to DNA damage. Several other proteins that are transcriptionally regulated by p53 also influence apoptosis. These include the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX, PUMA and NOXA, and the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 [Akhtar et al., 2006; Fuster et al., 2007]. In addition to regulating gene expression, p53 directly modulates the transmission of specific signals by interacting with other cellular proteins. For example, p53 accelerates DNA repair through interacting with key players of different DNA repair pathways [Jongmans et al., 1998; Sturzbecher et al., 2002; Sengupta and Harris, 2005; Al Rashid et al., 2005; Mirzayans et al., 2006; Murray and Mirzayans, 2007], and promotes apoptosis through interaction with pro-apoptotic proteins [Asada et al., 1999]. The proline-rich domain of p53 contains a motif that serves as a docking site in the transmission of signals that inhibit DNA replication, resulting in transactivation-independent growth arrest [Ruaro et al., 1997].\n\nROLES OF ATM AND P53 IN DNA REPAIR In the mid 1990’s, we reported that p53-deficient LFS fibroblasts [Mirzayans et al., 1996] and AT fibroblasts [Paterson and Mirzayans, 1993] exhibited a reduced ability to repair alkali-stable DNA lesions induced by ionizing radiation when compared to normal human fibroblasts. Since then, considerable efforts have been made to elucidate the roles of p53 and ATM in the rejoining of DSBs, which are considered to be the most deleterious lesions induced by ionizing radiation. Employing the neutral comet assay, p53-deficient murine embryo fibroblasts were shown to rejoin DSBs in response to ionizing radiation at a much\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012. ProQuest Ebook\n\nRazmik Mirzayans and David Murray\n\nslower rate than their p53-proficient counterparts [Al Rashid et al., 2005]. Employing this assay, the LFS and AT fibroblast strains used in our earlier study [Mirzayans et al., 1996] also exhibited an abnormally slow rate of DSB rejoining following exposure to ionizing radiation [Mirzayans et al., 2006]. The reduced rate of DSB rejoining in p53-deficient cells was manifested at various times between 1 and 24 h (Figure 3) and 2 to 24 h [Al Rashid et al., 2005] post-irradiation, and was attributed to absence of Ser15 phosphorylation [Al Rashid et al., 2005]. Consistent with the outcome of the neutral comet assays, several groups have reported that p53 interacts with various key players in homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), the two distinct and complimentary pathways for DSB repair [e.g., Jongmans et al., 1998; Sturzbecher et al., 2002; Sengupta and Harris, 2005; Al Rashid et al., 2005]. The reduced rate of DSB rejoining in AT fibroblasts was also manifested at early (e.g., 1 h) and late (>24 h) times after irradiation [Mirzayans et al., 2006; Figure 3]. This observation was highly anticipated for three reasons. First, the AT fibroblast strains used in our studies do not exhibit p53 activation under these conditions [Enns et al., 1998]. Second, ATM is required for activation of DNA-PKcs [Chen et al., 2007] that is a key component of the NHEJ repair pathway [Burma and Chen, 2004]; this ATM-mediated activation is accomplished through phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at the Thr2609 cluster [Chen et al., 2007]. Third, the WRN helicase, which is activated by ATM, plays a crucial role in DSB rejoining [Chen et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2011]. WRN enhances both the HR and NHEJ pathways by protecting the broken DNA ends from degradation as well as recruiting other proteins involved in DSB repair. Not all studies support a role for p53 or ATM in DSB rejoining, particularly at relatively short times (2 h) after exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., Goodarzi et al., 2008). Irrespective of the basis for the inconsistent results reported from different laboratories, there is general agreement that a small, but significant proportion of DSBs remain unrejoined in AT cells at late times (e.g., 24 h) after exposure to different doses of ionizing radiation (between 1 and 80 Gy). Goodarzi et al. [2008] demonstrated that DSBs in heterochromatin are generally repaired more slowly than DSBs in euchromatin, and that ATM is preferentially required for DSB repair within heterochromatin.\n\nMULTIPLE FUNCTIONS OF P21 IN THE ATM NETWORK Between 1993 and 1995, different groups independently reported the identification of the human gene that encodes the p21 protein. Harper and associates isolated a gene that was found to specify a 21-kDa protein that immunoprecipitated with the G1 checkpoint proteins cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, cyclin A, cyclin D1, and cyclin E [Harper et al., 1993]. They called the novel gene CIP1 for CDK-interacting protein 1. El-Diery et al. [1993] identified a gene whose induction was associated with the wild-type p53 function in a human brain tumor cell line, and called it WAF1 for wild-type p53-activated fragment 1. Noda et al. [1994] isolated a gene that is highly expressed in senescent human fibroblasts and called it SDI1 for senescent cell-derived inhibitor 1. These three genes turned out to be one and the same. Three other groups also reported the identification of the p21 protein [Gu et al., 1993; Xiong et al., 1993a; 1993b; Jiang et al., 1995]. The multiple functions of p21 became apparent from the fact that the various independent laboratories that identified this protein used unique approaches to explore distinct cell pathways. The human p21 protein is classified as a member of the kinase inhibitor protein (KIP) family of CDK inhibitors [Sherr and Roberts, 1999]. It is transcriptionally activated by the ATM-CHK2-p53 pathway after exposure to ionizing radiation and other DNA DSB-inducing agents, and by the ATR-CHK1-p53 pathway in response to agents such as ultraviolet light\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

Certain non-DNA-damaging agents (e.g., cytokines [Datto et al., 1995; Li et al., 1995; Hu et al., 1999], glucocorticoids [Corroyer et al., 1997], and retinoids [Liu et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1999]) are known to trigger p21 induction through p53-independent mechanisms. Although not universally appreciated, there is compelling evidence that p21 plays different crucial roles in the ATM (and ATR) signaling network, most of which are independent of its inhibitory action on CDKs (Figure 4). Thus, in addition to activating transient cell cycle checkpoints, p21 regulates gene expression, senescence, apoptosis, p53 protein stability, p53 function, and ATM function.\n\nFigure 4. Multiple functions of p21. This tumor suppressor is at the hub of ATM signaling, owing to its ability to: (i) inhibit cell cycle progression by interacting with PCNA and cyclin/CDK complexes; (ii) influence gene expression indirectly, through interfering with DNA methyltransferase (MeTase) activity, and directly, by stimulating transcription of a series of genes involved in senescence and suppressing the transcription of numerous genes involved in mitosis; (iii) down-regulating apoptosis through, e.g., interacting with ASK-1; and (iv) forming positive feedback loops with both ATM and p53.\n\nThe p21 protein exerts its effect on the cell cycle by several mechanisms. The C-terminus of p21 suppresses DNA synthesis by interacting with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary factor for DNA polymerase  [Rousseau et al., 1999]. The N-terminus of p21 binds to CDKs and inhibits their ability to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), an event that is required for progression of cells from G1 to S phase [Rousseau et al., 1999]. Induction of p21 also activates the G2/M checkpoint following genotoxic stress [Bunz et al., 1998; Gillis et al. 2009]. According to Gillis et al. [2009], the latter effect is caused by p21-mediated degradation of the G2-associated cyclin, cyclin B1. It is noteworthy that not all checkpoints are dependent on the p53-p21 axis. The ionizing radiation-induced S-phase checkpoint, which is defective in AT cells, is not dependent on p53 [Mirzayans et al., 1995; Enns et al., 1999] or p21 [Guo et al., 1999].\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

All rights reserved.\n\nRole of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Protein in Stress-Induced Premature …\n\n9\n\nIn 1997 it was reported that p21 negatively regulates the enzyme DNA-methyltransferase [Chuang et al., 1997]. This finding raised the intriguing possibility that p21 might influence the expression of the many human genes that contain CpG islands within their transcription start sites [Baylin, 1997]. Subsequent studies reported from various laboratories established an active role for p21 in the regulation of genes involved in growth arrest, senescence, and aging. Specifically, p21 down-regulates a series of genes involved in mitosis, and upregulates numerous genes associated with senescence [Chang et al., 2000; Roninson et al., 2003]. p21 also represses the activity of the transcription factors E2F [Delavaine and La Thangue, 1999] and c-myc [Kitaura et al., 2000] that directly participate in the expression of genes that control cell cycle progression. Another major function of p21 in many cell types is to suppress apoptosis by acting at different levels of the death cascade. Thus, p21 suppresses apoptosis by interacting with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) [Asada et al., 1999; Zhou and Hung, 2002], forming a complex with procaspase-3 and suppressing its activation by masking the protease cleavage site [Suzuki et al., 1999], inhibiting activation of caspase-9 [Sohn et al., 2006], inhibiting cytochrome c release from mitochondria [Le et al. 2005], and lowering the level of the wild-type p53 protein [Javelaud and Besaçon, 2002]. Suppression of p21 function in p53 wild-type human solid tumor-derived cells is known to be associated with increased p53 protein levels without exposure to genotoxic agents [Javelaud and Besaçon, 2002]. In addition, p21 deficiency leads to elevated expression of p14ARF (hereafter ARF) which is known to stabilize p53 by antagonizing MDM2 [Zhang et al., 1998; Pomerantz et al., 1998]. These findings led Javelaud and Besaçon to propose that increased ARF levels in p21-deficient cells may increase the steady-state levels of p53 by interrupting the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. Suppression of p21 in p53 wild-type human cells renders them highly sensitive to undergoing apoptosis after exposure to ionizing radiation [Wouters et al., 1997; Tian et al., 2000], which is consistent with the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic properties of p53 and p21, respectively. All of these studies measured global p53 protein levels by Western blotting. Recently, Pang et al. [2011] demonstrated that regulation of p53 by p21 is more complex than originally believed, and it also involves ATM. In that study, p21-null solid tumorderived cells exhibited compromised p53-mediated transcription (despite containing high constitutive levels of global p53 protein) that was linked to a p53 protein shift from chromatin into the cytoplasm; complementation of p21-null cells with the p21 gene restored nuclear localization of p53. Inhibition of ATM function in p53 and p21 wild-type cells resulted in nuclear exclusion of p53, suggesting a positive interaction between ATM and p21. These observations highlighted the interaction between two p53-regulated proteins, one of which (MDM2) is a negative regulator of p53 and promotes p53 degradation, and the other (p21) is a positive effector and maintains both nuclear localization of p53 and the ATMdependent DNA damage response.\n\nSEQUENTIAL WAVES OF P53 ACTIVATION BY DNA DAMAGE The discovery of the involvement of p53 in the DNA damage response in the early 1990’s led to a model in which the p53-p21 pathway either promotes survival by activating\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

In 1998, we reported studies with human fibroblasts which led us to propose a “two wave” model for activation of the p53/p21 response by ionizing radiation and UV (254 nm) [Barley et al., 1998]. According to our model for fibroblasts, while the rapid activation of the p53-p21 pathway (first wave) causes transient activation of cell cycle checkpoints and facilitates DNA repair, the persistence of genomic lesions (e.g., DNA damage, chromosome breaks) provides the critical signal for the late activation of the p53-p21 pathway (second wave), leading to p21-mediated SIPS or p53mediated apoptosis, depending on the extent of genomic injury. For both agents, the primary mode of clonogenic “death” (i.e., inability of a cell to form a colony of at least 50 cells) was shown to be SIPS and not apoptosis. In fact, apoptosis was observed only after exposure to supralethal doses of UV (>30 J/m2) which produce sufficient numbers of bulky DNA lesions to block transcription of genes such as p21 [Barley et al., 1998]. Accordingly, we have focused our studies on “survival-curve-range” doses of DNA-damaging agents (i.e., doses that cause no more that 90% cell kill in the clonogenic assay). Under these conditions, we have shown that the principal mode of clonogenic death is SIPS and not apoptosis in human normal and DSB-repair deficient (AT and LFS) fibroblast strains exposed to ionizing radiation [Mirzayans et al., 2010], and in human normal and nucleotide excision repairdeficient (xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome) fibroblast strains exposed to UV [Mirzayans et al., 2008].\n\nFigure 5. Sequential waves of p53 signaling in normal human fibroblasts exposed to ionizing radiation. [A] Exposure to ionizing radiation results in ATM-dependent activation of numerous proteins (e.g., p53, WRN, DNA-PKcs) that play key roles in DSB repair, as well as p53-mediated activation of p21 which suppresses apoptosis and activates the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints. Proper activation of these early events provides time for removal of potentially cytotoxic and mutagenic DNA lesions. [B] Persistence of DNA damage (i.e., irreparable damage) at late times (>24 h) post-irradiation results in sustained nuclear accumulation of p21 which suppresses apoptosis and induces “permanent” growth arrest through SIPS. Positive feedback loops between ATM and p21 and between p53 and p21 ensure the maintenance of the SIPS response.\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012. ProQuest Ebook\n\nRole of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Protein in Stress-Induced Premature …\n\n11\n\nThe sequential waves of p53 signaling have now been documented for human solid tumor-derived cell lines [Lahav et al., 2008; Batchelor et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011]. Batchelor et al. [2008] proposed the same outcome at each wave of the DNA damage response, i.e., p21-mediated G1/S checkpoint activation and p53-mediated apoptosis. More recently, Zhang et al. [2011] suggested that p53 may first be partially activated by primary modifications such as phosphorylation at Ser15 and Ser20 to induce cell cycle checkpoints, and if the damage is beyond repair, p53 may be fully activated by further modifications at Ser46 to trigger apoptosis. Neither model considers the pivotal role of p21 in suppressing apoptosis and inducing SIPS. The well-established multifunctional nature of p21 described above is consistent with our original model, with different p21-mediated outcomes from early and late waves, the former activating checkpoints to facilitate repair, and the latter suppressing apoptosis and triggering SIPS, primarily through regulating gene expression independent of its influence on early cell cycle checkpoints [Barley et al., 1998]. In view of the recent discovery of the ATM-p21 and p53-p21 regulatory loops [Pang et al., 2011] alluded to earlier, our original model needs to be revised to incorporate the role of p21 in maintaining the DNA damage response (Figure 5).\n\nCopyright © 2012.

This phenomenon was first observed with human diploid fibroblasts half a century ago [Haff and Swim, 1956], and was subsequently reported for keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and other cell types [reviewed in Cristofalo and Pignolo, 1993]. Major characteristics of senescent cells include an enlarged and flattened morphology, positive staining for senescence-associated βgalactosidase (SA-β-Gal), and loss of proliferating capacity. Senescence is not merely a passive growth arrest. Cells undergoing senescence remain metabolically active and influence their environment and neighboring cells through an active secretory program. Senescence can also be induced in some types of proliferating (young) human cells by different means, including exposure to DNA damaging agents (i.e., SIPS) and overexpression of p21, p16INK4a (hereafter p16) and other tumor suppressors [Xu et al., 1997; Kato et al., 1998; McConnell et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2005]. Replicative senescence results primarily from the shortening of telomeres as a function of culture age. Telomere shortening is believed to destabilize or even prevent the capping of chromosome ends by telomerases, triggering replicative senescence [Shay, 1999]. On the other hand, SIPS in young human fibroblasts is triggered by nonspecific genome-wide DNA damage, independent of telomere status and telomerase function [Chen et al., 2001; Roninson, 2003; Shay and Roninson, 2004]. In normal human fibroblasts, both replicative senescence [Sedelnikova et al., 2004; Mirzayans et al., 2010] and SIPS [di Fagagna et al., 2003; Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2004; Mirzayans et al., 2008; 2010] are accompanied by nuclear foci containing -H2AX molecules, signifying the presence of irreparable DNA DSBs. Although overexpression of p16 triggers senescence in some cell types, the role of endogenous p16 in different types of senescence has been contentious [Mirzayans et al.,\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012. ProQuest Ebook\n\n12\n\nRazmik Mirzayans and David Murray\n\nCopyright © 2012. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\n2010, and references therein]. Some reports suggested a sequential involvement of p21 and p16 in senescence [Alcorta et al., 1996; Stein et al., 1999], and other reports did not support a role for p16 in senescence [Herbig et al., 2004; Freedman and Folkman, 2005]. Our recent studies with LFS fibroblasts led us to propose the model presented in Figure 6 for the fibroblast background, in which p16 serves as a backup regulator of replicative senescence and SIPS, triggering these responses only in the absence of wild-type p53 function [Mirzayans et al., 2010]. Our model is consistent with the properties of both p53 and p16, with the former functioning as a negative regulator of p16 [Jacobs and De Lange, 2005; Hernández-Vargas et al., 2006; De Lange et al., 2009], and the latter capable of suppressing apoptosis [Al-Mohanna et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2007] and triggering senescence [Zhang, 2007]. The role of ATM in the induction of p16 in different p53-deficient cell types undergoing replicative senescence and ionizing radiation-induced SIPS remains to be determined.\n\nFigure 6. Model for the roles of p16, p53 and p21 in replicative senescence and DNA damage-induced SIPS in human fibroblast cultures. In p53 wild-type (normal and AT) fibroblasts, exposure to DNAdamaging agents or telomere shortening as a result of culture age results in activation of p53, which suppresses p16 and induces p21. The latter protein represses apoptosis and triggers senescence. On the other hand, p53-deficient (LFS) fibroblasts respond to stress by upregulation of p16 which serves to repress apoptosis and to activate senescence.\n\nATM-INDEPENDENT SENESCENCE Skin fibroblasts cultured from AT patients exhibit elevated levels of spontaneous chromosomal instability coupled with premature replicative senescence when compared to\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

Consistent with these observations, ATM is known to contribute to telomere maintenance [Wong et al., 2003; Chan and Blackburn, 2003]. We have confirmed the early onset of replicative senescence in AT fibroblasts, and further demonstrated that this response is associated with nuclear accumulation of p21 independent of p16 expression [Mirzayans et al., 2010]. As mentioned above, the AT fibroblast strains used by us do not activate p53 at early times (between 3 and 24 h) after exposure to ionizing radiation [Enns et al., 1998]. It was of interest to determine whether ionizing radiation exposure would elicit SIPS in these strains, and if so, whether this response would involve p16 (and not p21) as we have documented for p53-deficient LFS fibroblasts [Mirzayans et al., 2010]. Exposure to a given dose of -rays induced SIPS in a much higher proportion of cells within young cultures of AT fibroblasts than those of normal fibroblasts [Mirzayans et al., 2010]. Unexpectedly, the ionizing radiation-induced SIPS in AT fibroblasts correlated with a robust induction of p21 but not of p16. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that ionizing radiation exposure caused nuclear accumulation of p53 in AT fibroblasts when measured several days postirradiation, but not at earlier times (within 2 days) post-irradiation. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms by which ionizing radiation exposure triggers a delayed (>2 days) wave of p53-p21 activation in AT fibroblasts, and to determine whether this ATM-independent wave constitutes an integral part of the normal DNA damage surveillance machinery, or whether it reflects the involvement of a redundant pathway (e.g., mediated by ATR and/or DNA PKcs) operating only in the absence of ATM function.\n\nCopyright © 2012.

In the original model of the p53-mediated surveillance network [Meyn, 1995; Enoch and Norbury, 1995], the mechanism by which p53 eliminates injured cells was hypothesized to be through apoptosis. This model still continues to be widely cited. However, numerous studies with non-transformed skin fibroblast strains [Barley et al., 1998; Mirzayans et al., 2008; 2010] and p53 wild-type solid tumor-derived cell lines [Han et al., 2002; Mirzayans et al., 2005; Sohn et al., 2006; Crescenzi et al., 2008; Gewirtz et al., 2008; Sliwinska et al., 2009] have now established that SIPS, and not apoptosis, is the predominant (if not exclusive) response triggered by “survival-curve-range” doses of DNA-damaging agents in such cell types. Although cells undergoing SIPS do not form macroscopic colonies and hence are scored as “dead” in clonogenic assays, it is becoming increasingly evident that under some conditions SIPS might not be a permanent growth-arrested state. Thus, a proportion of cells exhibiting features of SIPS can escape the proliferation block and give rise to giant cells with extensive genetic abnormalities (e.g., multinucleation) [Rajaraman et al., 2006; Sliwinska et al., 2009]. In addition, loss of p53 function is now universally accepted to be permissive for the development of such giant cells after exposure to ionizing radiation and other cancer therapeutic agents [Illedge et al., 2000; Erenpreisa and Cragg, 2001; Rajaraman et al., 2006; Vakifahmetoglu et al., 2008; Ianzini et al., 2009].\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012. ProQuest Ebook\n\n14\n\nRazmik Mirzayans and David Murray\n\nCopyright © 2012. Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated. All rights reserved.\n\nWhat is the fate of such giant cells? It is well documented that multinucleation /polyploidy may provide a radiation-survival mechanism in some mammalian cell types. Giant cells with such genetic abnormalities may give rise to rapidly proliferating offspring by depolyploidization through meiotic or pseudo-meiotic pathways [Ianzini et al., 2009; Erenpreisa et al., 2009], as well as neosis, an ill-defined parasexual somatic reduction division which resembles division of the budding yeast [Rajaraman et al., 2006; Sliwinska et al., 2009; Mansilla et al., 2009] (also see Figure 7). Through these complex processes, giant cells can give rise to rapidly proliferating descendants that can exhibit stem cell-like properties and resistance to cancer therapeutic agents [reviewed in Rajaraman et al., 2006]. The Aurora B kinase, a key regulator of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis [Warner et al., 2003], has been identified as the gatekeeper between life and death of multinucleated/polyploid giant cells. Endogenous expression of catalytically active Aurora B kinase promoted the survival of giant cells, whereas its absence was associated with giant-cell apoptosis [Erenpreisa et al., 2008]. Does ATM play a role in determining the fate of giant cells? The mitotic kinases Aurora A and Aurora B are inhibited by DNA damage to ensure blocking of mitosis [reviewed in Bensimon et al., 2011]. This inhibition is accomplished through dephosphorylation and is dependent on protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) [Satinover et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2008; Bhatia et al., 2010]. Intriguingly, PP1 is known to act as an ATM effector to control Aurora kinases as well as other kinases. Specifically, Tang et al. [2008] determined that ionizing radiation induces the dissociation of PP1 from its regulatory subunit (inhibitor-2), which results in activation of PP1, inhibition of Aurora B kinase, and down-regulation of histone H3 Ser10 phosphorylation, leading to mitotic arrest.\n\nFigure 7. Fate of multinucleated and polyploid giant cells. DNA-damaging agents trigger the development of such giant cells within p53-deficient cultures. In addition, a small proportion of cells within p53-proficient cultures “escape” from the SIPS response after DNA damage and give rise to giant cells. While some giant cells may die through apoptosis, others may retain viability and undergo complex genome reduction processes (e.g., depolyploidization; neosis), ultimately resulting in the generation of rapidly proliferating progeny. The mitotic kinase Aurora B plays a key role in the survival of giant cells. We propose that ATM prevents the propagation of giant cells and their descendants through activating PP1 and inhibiting Aurora B kinase activity.\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

All rights reserved.\n\nPOTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES FOR THE TREATMENT OF AT The growing complexity of the molecular and cellular events regulated by ATM discussed above, in concert with the presence of different mutations within the gene among AT patients [Lavin, 2008], indicate that complete cure for AT patients will require gene replacement which must be tailored to specific mutations [Lavin, 2008]. This strategy, however, has met with a number of obstacles which need to be addressed before it could be used in the clinic [reviewed in Lavin, 2008]. Alternative strategies have been proposed that might be effective for managing or alleviating some of the symptoms associated with the disease. One such strategy exploits the bystander effect of ionizing radiation, and another makes use of antioxidants. These strategies are outlined below. The term \"bystander effect\" in the field of radiobiology refers to the detection of radiation-like effects in cells that have not received a direct radiation “hit”. In addition to ionizing radiation-associated bystander effects, we reported another form of cell-to-cell communication between non-irradiated normal and AT fibroblast cultures, resulting in correction of the AT phenotype [Paterson and Mirzayans, 1993; Mirzayans and Paterson, 2001]. Employing the alkaline sucrose velocity sedimentation technique, AT fibroblasts were shown to be defective in repairing alkali-stable DNA lesions after exposure to ionizing radiation or the radiomimetic carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide [Paterson et al., 1976; Mirzayans et al., 1989; Paterson and Mirzayans, 1993]. Interestingly, this repair deficiency could be corrected by co-cultivation of AT fibroblasts with normal fibroblasts in the absence of somatic cell fusion [Paterson and Mirzayans, 1993]. These and related studies (published before cloning of the ATM gene) led us to propose that the product of the gene mutated in AT must function upstream in various signaling pathways [Mirzayans et al., 1988; 1989; Mirzayans and Paterson, 1991]. We next focused our attention on correcting the “radioresistant DNA synthesis” (RDS) phenotype of AT cells, which has often been taken as a molecular hallmark of AT. RDS reflects the failure of AT cells to exhibit inhibition of de novo DNA synthesis immediately after ionizing radiation exposure. We demonstrated that: (i) the radiation-responsive S-phase checkpoint operating in normal human fibroblasts is mediated by a p53-independent signaling pathway involving Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) [Mirzayans et al., 1995; Enns et al., 1999]; (ii) this p53-independent pathway is activated by a heat-labile diffusible factor [Mirzayans et al., 1997]; and (iii) the RDS phenotype of AT cells is associated with failure to activate the CaMKII-dependent S-phase arrest [Mirzayans et al., 1995]. We further reported that the RDS phenotype of AT fibroblasts can be rectified in the absence of ectopic expression of functional ATM [Paterson and Mirzayans, 1999; Mirzayans and Paterson, 2001]. Correction of RDS was observed when: (i) AT fibroblasts were coincubated with normal fibroblasts under conditions in which the two different cell cultures\n\nAtaxia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment : Causes, Symptoms and Treatment, Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated, 2012.

Collectively, these results indicated that exogenous factors, including some eicosanoids, are capable of compensating for aspects of the ATM function in AT cells. Accordingly, such factors have been proposed to potentially provide a practical strategy for the management of AT patients and probably AT carriers (heterozygotes) without the need for ATM gene therapy [Paterson and Mirzayans, 1999]. The clinical ramifications of eicosanoids in this context remain to be explored. Other groups have taken the advantage of antioxidants in an attempt to formulate treatments for AT [reviewed in Lavin et al., 2007; Reliene and Schiestl, 2008]. Several observations led to this approach. For example, antioxidant capacity is reduced in the serum of AT patients, cultured AT cells show evidence of increased oxidative stress, and ATMmediated inhibition of oxidative stress is required for self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells. Thus, it was hypothesized that unusually increased oxidative stress in AT might lead to increased macromolecular damage and in turn to genome instability, cancer and neurodegeneration [Lavin et al., 2007]. Studies with Atm deficient mice revealed that several antioxidants were effective in suppressing genome rearrangement, increasing life span, and reducing both the incidence and multiplicity of lymphoma [Reviewed in Reliene and Schiestl, 2008]. The antioxidants tested in these studies included N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), desferrioxamine, and 5-carboxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindolin-2-yloxyl. Among these compounds, only NAC has wide clinical applications due to safety and efficacy. It is also available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Therefore, NAC was proposed to have a strong potential to emerge as a dietary supplement for the management of some symptoms associated with AT [Reliene and Schiestl, 2008].\n\nCONCLUSION In the mid 1990’s, it was proposed that activation of the p53 pathway by DNA-damaging agents might lead to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, the former promoting cell survival by facilitating DNA repair, and the latter resulting in the removal of irreparably damaged cells from the proliferating population [e.g., Meyn, 1995; Enoch and Norbury, 1995]. This model still provides the impetus for numerous studies. However, compelling recent evidence has revealed that the primary response of human fibroblasts to DNA damaging agents is SIPS and not apoptosis. Similarly, many p53 wild-type human solid tumor cell lines respond to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents by undergoing SIPS [Chang et al., 1999a; 1999b; Mirzayans et al., 2005; Afshar et al. 2006; Sohn et al. 2006], and targeting either p53 or p21 switches the treatment-induced response from SIPS to apoptosis [Han et al., 2002; Tian et al., 2002; Crescenzi et al., 2008; Gewirtz et al., 2008; Li et al., 2011]. The p21 protein is at the hub of ATM signaling because of the ability of this multifunctional protein to activate transient cell cycle checkpoints, suppress apoptosis, control gene expression, positively regulate ATM and p53, and induce SIPS.
