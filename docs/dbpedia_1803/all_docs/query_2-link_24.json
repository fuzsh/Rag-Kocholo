The obtained BiOI/Bi 2 MoO 6 photocatalysts exhibited much higher visible light (Î»Â >Â 420Â nm) induced photocatalytic activity compared with single Bi 2 MoO 6 and BiOI photocatalysts. 20Â % BiOI/Bi 2 MoO 6 nanocomposite exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity with almost all RhB decomposed within 70Â min. However, excess BiOI covering on the surface of Bi 2 MoO 6 can inversely reduce the photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocatalytic activities could be resulted from the function of the novel pân heterojunction interface between Bi 2 MoO 6 and BiOI, which could separate photoinduced carriers efficiently. Possible mechanisms on the basis of the relative band positions were also discussed\n\nOI Issues: Dental Care for Persons with OI\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n...

(Germany). Inst. fuer Anorganische Chemie\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe syntheses and crystal structures of the two isotypic europium(II) oxide halides Eu{sub 2}OBr{sub 2} and Eu{sub 2}OI{sub 2} are reported. They crystallize orthorhombically in the space group Ibam (Z=4; Eu{sub 2}OBr{sub 2}: a=709.86(5), b=1200.34(9), c=628.71(4) pm; Eu{sub 2}OI{sub 2}: a=739.78(5), b=1295.13(9), c=644.82(4) pm). The unit cell parameters presented here, and thus the interatomic distances of Eu{sub 2}OI{sub 2}, are significantly smaller than the ones reported in the literature, which is explained by the substitution of europium with larger barium cations due to the synthesis route described in the early study. Central building blocks of both crystal structures are trans-edge-connected [OEu{sub 4}]{sup 6+} tetrahedra forming straight {sup 1}{sub â}{[OEu\"e_4_/_2]\"2\"+} chains running parallel to the [001] direction.

The content of Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 in the catalysts was regulated by modulating the amount of urea as a precursor, which was decomposed to generate CO 3 2â in the hydrothermal process. Citrate anion plays a key role in controlling the morphology and composition of the products. The Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 /BiOI catalysts display much higher photocatalytic activity than pure BiOI and Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 towards the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and bisphenol A (BPA). The enhancement of photocatalytic activity of the heterojuncted catalysts is attributed to the formation of pân junction between p-BiOI and n-Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 , which is favorable for retarding the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. Moreover, the holes are demonstrated to be the main active species for the degradation of RhB and BPA\n\nEffective charge separation in BiOI/Cu2O composites with enhanced photocatalytic activity\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXia, Yongmei; He, Zuming; Yang, Wei; Tang, Bin; Lu, Yalin; Hu, Kejun; Su, Jiangbin; Li, Xiaoping\n\n2018-02-01\n\nNovel BiOI/Cu2O composites were designed and synthesized for the first time by coupling reduction method at low temperature. The samples were characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, EDS, HRTEM, UV-vis (DRS), FTIR and photo-electro-chemical (PEC) analysis. Results showed that the BiOI/Cu2O composites consisted of three-dimensional (3D), hierarchical cauliflower-like structure composed of BiOI nanosheet and Cu2O cubic submicrometer structure, the composite absorption band broadened, and the absorption intensity in the visible region strengthened. And the composites exhibited an excellent photocatalytic performance, which might be attributed to the improvement of the composite absorption and effective charge separation in BiOI/Cu2O composites. In addition, the possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed.\n\nHigh photocatalytic performance of BiOI/Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} toward toluene and Reactive Brilliant Red\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLi Huiquan [School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Fuyang Normal College, Fuyang 236041 (China); Key Laboratory of Mesoscopic Chemistry of MOE, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanotechnology, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093 (China); Cui Yumin, E-mail: cuiyumin0908@163.com [School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Fuyang Normal College, Fuyang 236041 (China); Hong Wenshan [School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Fuyang Normal College, Fuyang 236041 (China)\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGraphical abstract: When BiOI/Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} catalyst was exposed to UV or visible light, the electrons in the valence band of Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} would be excited into the conduction band and then injected into the more positive conduction band of BiOI. Therefore, the photoelectrons were generated from Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} and transferred across the interface between BiOI and Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} to the surface of BiOI, leaving the photogenerated holes in the valence band of Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6}. In this way, the photoinduced electron-hole pairs were effectively separated.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The 13.2% BiOI/Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} catalyst exhibits higher photoactivities than P25. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer A possible transfer process of photogenerated carriers was proposed. - Abstract: BiOI sensitized nano-Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} photocatalysts with different BiOI contents were successfully synthesized by a facile deposition method at room temperature, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements. The photocatalytic activity of BiOI/Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} was evaluated by the photo-degradation of Reactive Brilliant Red (X-3B) in suspended solution and toluene in gas phase. It has been shown that the BiOI/Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} catalysts exhibit a coexistence of both tetragonal BiOI and orthorhombic Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} phases. With increasing BiOI content, the absorption intensity of BiOI/Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6} catalysts increases in the 380-600 nm region and the absorption edge shifts significantly to longer wavelengths as compared to pure Bi{sub 2}WO{sub 6}.

The effects of the hydrothermal process, such as TiO 2 nanorod growth time, BiOI concentration and the role of surfactant, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), on the growth of BiOI, were investigated. The heterojunctions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UVâvis absorbance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The photoelectrochemical properties of the as-grown junctions, such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) behavior, photocurrent response and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) under Xenon lamp illumination, are presented.

Dense BiOI nanosheets with good crystalline and width about 500 nm were uniformly assembled on TiO2 nanofibers at room temperature. The amount of the heterojunctions and the specific surface area were well controlled by adjusting the SILAR cycles. Due to the synergistic effect of p-n heterojunctions and high specific surface area, the obtained p-BiOI/n-TiO2 NFs exhibited enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the p-BiOI/n-TiO2 NFs heterojunctions could be easily recycled without decreasing the photocatalytic activity owing to their one-dimensional nanofibrous structure. Based on the above, the heterojunctions of p-BiOI/n-TiO2 NFs may be promising visible-light-driven photocatalysts for converting solar energy to chemical energy in environment remediation.\n\nBiOI/TiO{sub 2}-nanorod array heterojunction solar cell: Growth, charge transport kinetics and photoelectrochemical properties\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWang, Lingyun; Daoud, Walid A., E-mail: wdaoud@cityu.edu.hk\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ BiOI/TiO{sub 2} photoanodes were fabricated by a simple solvothermal/hydrothermal method. â¢ BiOI/TiO{sub 2} (PVP) showed a 13-fold increase in photocurrent density compared to TiO{sub 2}. â¢ Charge transport kinetics within the BiOI/TiO{sub 2} heterojunctions are discussed. - Abstract: A series of BiOI/TiO{sub 2}-nanorod array photoanodes were grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass using a simple two-step solvothermal/hydrothermal method.

These assumptions are related to the TMI accident. The analysing conditions are 1) the main feed water flow is totally lost suddenly during the rated power operation of the reactor, 2) two motor-driven auxiliary feed water pumps are started manually fifteen minutes after the accident initiation, 3) one relief valve on the pressurizer is opened fifteen seconds after the accident initiation and kept open, 4) the reactor is scrammed thirty three seconds after the accident initiation, 5) the turbine is tripped 33.5 seconds after the accident initiation, etc. Two cases were analysed, namely 3,800 seconds and 1,200 seconds after the accident initiation. The analytical code RELEP4/Mod5/U2/J1 was utilized for this analysis. The level fluctuation in the pressurizer after the accident initiation, the flow rate fluctuation through the pressurizer relief valve, especially that of steam, liquid single phase and two phase flows, the water level in the upper plenum in the pressure vessel, the change of flow rate at core inlet, the average pressure in the core, and the temperature fluctuation of coolant in the core, the variation of void fraction in the core, and the change of surface temperature of fuel rods are presented as the analysis results, and they are evaluated. It is recognized that the plant safety is kept under the assumed accident conditions in the Oi nuclear power plant.

The phase structures, morphologies and optical properties of the as-prepared samples were studied by XRD, TEM, HRTEM, BET, XPS, UVâvis DRS and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The results showed that BiOI/BSO heteronanostructures displayed much higher photocatalytic activity than pure BSO and BiOI for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB). The best photocatalytic activity of BiOI/BSO with almost 99.9% RhB degradation situated at molar percentage ratio of 4% after 6 h irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of BiOI/BSO could be mainly attributed to the formation of the heterojunction between p-BiOI and n-BSO, which effectively restrains the recombination of photoinduced electronâhole pairs. Moreover, the study of radical scavengers affirmed that h{sup +} and â¢ O{sub 2}{sup â} were the primary reactive species for the degradation of RhB.\n\nCrossed BiOI flake array solar cells\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWang, Kewei; Jia, Falong; Zhang, Lizhi [Key Laboratory of Pesticide and Chemical Biology of Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry, Central China Normal University, Wuhan (China); Zheng, Zhi [Institute of Surface Micro and Nano Materials, Xuchang University (China)\n\n2010-12-15\n\nWe report a new kind of solar cell based on crossed flake-like BiOI arrays for the first time.

Both are soft materials with bulk modulus of 58.6âGPa and 52.0âGPa for Na 3 OBr and Na 4 OI 2 , respectively. The cubic Na 3 OBr structure and tetragonal Na 4 OI 2 with intergrowth K 2 NiF 4 structure are stable under high pressure up to 23âGPa. Although being a characteristic layered structure, Na 4 OI 2 exhibits nearly isotropic compressibility. Negative thermal expansion was observed at low temperature range (20â80âK) in both transition-metal-free antiperovskites for the first time. The robust high pressure structure stability was examined and confirmed by first-principles calculations among various possible polymorphisms qualitatively. The results provide in-depth understanding of the negative thermal expansion and robust crystal structure stability of these antiperovskite systems and their potential applications\n\nFacile synthesis of AgI/BiOI-Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3} multi-heterojunctions with high visible light activity for Cr(VI) reduction\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWang, Qi [School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou 310018 (China); The Brook Byer Institute for Sustainable Systems and School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta 30332 (United States); Shi, Xiaodong; Liu, Enqin [School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou 310018 (China); Crittenden, John C.

Different characterization techniques were performed to investigate the structural, optical and electrical properties of the as-prepared photocatalysts. It was found that the ternary AgI/BiOI-Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3} composite exhibited: (1) improved photocurrent response, (2) smaller band gap, (3) greatly reduced charge transfer resistance and (4) negative shift of flat band potential, which finally led to easier generation and more efficient separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs at the hetero-interfaces. Thus, for the reduction of Cr(VI), AgI/BiOI-Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3} exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation at near neutral pH. AgI/BiOI-Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3} was optimized when the initial molar ratio of KI to Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3} and AgNO{sub 3} to Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3} was 1:1 and 10%, respectively. The estimated k{sub Cr(VI)} on optimized AgI/BiOI-Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3} was about 16 times that on pure Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3}. Good stability was also observed in cyclic runs, indicating that the current multi-heterostructured photocatalyst is highly desirable for the remediation of Cr(VI)-containing wastewater.\n\nEnhanced photocatalytic activity and characterization of magnetic Ag/BiOI/ZnFe2O4 composites for Hg0 removal under fluorescent light irradiation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLi, Chengwei; Zhang, Anchao; Zhang, Lixiang; Song, Jun; Su, Sheng; Sun, Zhijun; Xiang, Jun\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA series of magnetic Ag/BiOI/ZnFe2O4 hybrids synthesized via hydrothermal process, subsequent deposition-precipitation and photoreduction method were employed to remove elemental mercury (Hg0) under fluorescent light irradiation. The effects of Ag content, fluorescent light irradiation, reaction temperature, pH value, flue gas composition, anions and photocatalyst dosage on Hg0 removal were investigated in detail. The as-synthesized photocatalysts were characterized using N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, VSM, DRS, ESR, PL and photocurrent response. The results showed that the ternary Ag/BiOI/ZnFe2O4 hybrids possessed enhanced visible-light-responsive photocatalytic performances for Hg0 removal. Ag/BiOI/ZnFe2O4 photocatalyst could be easily recovered from the reaction solution by an extra magnet and was stable in the process of Hg0 removal. Lower content of Ag was highly dispersed on the surface of BiOI/ZnFe2O4, while higher content of Ag would result in some aggregations and/or the blockages of micropore. In comparison to BiOI/ZnFe2O4, Ag deposited BiOI/ZnFe2O4 material showed lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. The superior Hg0 oxidation removal could correspond to good match of BiOI and ZnFe2O4, excellent fluidity and surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag0 nanoparticles, which led to higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby enhancing the hybrids' photocatalytic activity.\n\nSILAR BiOI-Sensitized TiO2 Films for Visible-Light Photocatalytic Degradation of Rhodamineâ B and 4-Chlorophenol.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOdling, Gylen; Robertson, Neil\n\n2017-04-05\n\nBiOI nanoplates were deposited upon a film of TiO 2 nanoparticles derived from a commercial source using a simple room temperature sequential ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron microscopies have been used to confirm the crystal phase, chemical states of key elements and morphology of the BiOI nanoplate-TiO 2 composites. Using both valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV/Vis diffuse reflectance measurements the band structure of the composites is determined to be that of a typeâ II heterojunction. Through initial screening of the photocatalytic activity of the SILAR-modified films it was determined that five SILAR cycles are optimal in the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamineâ B. The visible-light sensitisation effect of BiOI was then proven by examination of the photocatalytic degradation of the colourless organic pollutant 4-chlorophenol, showing a large enhancement over an equivalent TiO 2 film.

Â FranÃ§ois de Rose in the ATLAS cavern during his visit to CERN in 2013. Visionaries have the freedom of mind to shape the future when other peopleâs horizons are obstructed by the present. FranÃ§ois de Rose was a visionary. In the aftermath of the Second World War, when Europe was in ruin, when absolutely everything had to be rebuilt, the diplomat understood the importance of reviving fundamental research and, above all, of cooperation on a continental scale as the driving force of this ambition.

Both are soft materials with bulk modulus of 58.6âGPa and 52.0âGPa for Na{sub 3}OBr and Na{sub 4}OI{sub 2}, respectively. The cubic Na{sub 3}OBr structure and tetragonal Na{sub 4}OI{sub 2} with intergrowth K{sub 2}NiF{sub 4} structure are stable under high pressure up to 23âGPa. Although being a characteristic layered structure, Na{sub 4}OI{sub 2} exhibits nearly isotropic compressibility. Negative thermal expansion was observed at low temperature range (20â80âK) in both transition-metal-free antiperovskites for the first time. The robust high pressure structure stability was examined and confirmed by first-principles calculations among various possible polymorphisms qualitatively.

It was carried out during the period from July 11, 1986, to January 28, 1987. The inspection covered the main unit of the nuclear reactor, facilities for the nuclear reactor cooling system, facilities for the instrumentation control system, fuel facilities, radiation control facilities, disposal facilities, nuclear reactor containment facilities, and emergency power generation system. Checking of appearance, disassemblage, leak and functions-performance of these facilities was conducted. No abnormalities were found except that significant signs were detected in 725 steam generator heat transfer pipes and that leak was suspected in 2 fuel assemblies. The pipes were repaired and the fuel assemblies were replaced. All operations involved in the inspection were performed under conditions within the permissible dose as specified in the applicable laws. Major modification work carried out during the inspection period included the adoption of a burnable poison (B Type) and the charging of fuel for high burn-up demonstration test. The exposure dose of the company members and non-company members who performed the inspection work is also shown.

At the time of deliberation, the guidelines for examining the safety design and safety evaluation of LWR facilities for power generation were used. Regarding the change of the degree of enrichment of replacement fuel from 3.2 to 3.4 wt.%, the limiting conditions are satisfied in the replacement core, and the nuclear design is appropriate. Eight test fuel assemblies using UO 2 pellets containing gadolinia are charged in the core of No.2 reactor, and the irradiation of two cycles is carried out. As the result of the safety examination regarding this test, the propriety of the nuclear design and mechanical design of the test fuel assemblies was confirmed. This alteration does not exert influence on the result of safety analysis made so far.

As a novel layered photocatalyst, the main drawback of BiOI is the low edge position of the conduction band. To address this problem, it is meaningful to find materials that possess suitable band gap, proper band edge position, and high mobility of carrier to combine with BiOI to form hetertrostructure. In this study, graphene-based materials (including: graphene, graphene oxide, and g-C{sub 3}N{sub 4}) were chosen as candidates to achieve this purpose. The charge transfer, interface interaction, and band offsets are focused on and analyzed in detail by DFT calculations. Results indicated that graphene-based materials and BiOI were in contact and formed van der Waals heterostructures. The valence and conduction band edge positions of graphene oxide, g-C{sub 3}N{sub 4} and BiOI changed with the Fermi level and formed the standard type-II heterojunction. In addition, the overall analysis of charge density difference, Mulliken population, and band offsets indicated that the internal electric field is facilitate for the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which means these heterostructures can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of BiOI. Thus, BiOI combines with 2D materials to construct heterostructure not only make use of the unique high electron mobility, but also can adjust the position of energy bands and\n\nStructural and electronic properties of low-index stoichiometric BiOI surfaces\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDai, Wen-Wu; Zhao, Zong-Yan, E-mail: zzy@kmust.edu.cn\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAs promising photocatalyst driven by visible-light, BiOI has attracted more and more attention in the past years. However, the surface structure and properties of BiOI that is the most important place for the photocatalytic have not been investigated in details. To this end, density functional theory was performed to calculate the structural and electronic properties of four low-index stoichiometric surfaces of BiOI. It is found that the relaxation of the low-index BiOI surfaces are relatively small, especially the (001) surface. Thus, the surface energies of BiOI are very relatively small. Moreover, there are a few surface states below the bottom of conduction band in the first layer except the (001) surface, which maybe capture the photo-excited carriers. In all of the most stable terminated planes, all the dangling bonds are cleaved from the broken Bi-O bonds. In the case of (001) surface, the dangling bond density of Bi atoms for the (001) surface is zero per square nano. Therefore, the (001) surface is thermodynamically lowest-energy surface of BiOI, and it is the predominant surface (51.4%). As a final remark, the dangling bonds density of bismuth atoms determines not only the surface energy, but also the surface relaxation. Finally, the equilibrium morphology of BiOI was also proposed and provided, which is determined through the Wulff construction. These results will help us to better understand the underlying photocatalytic mechanism that is related to BiOI surfaces, and provide theoretical support for some experimental studies about BiOI-based photocatalyst in future. - Highlights: â¢ Four low-index BiOI surfaces have been calculated by DFT method. â¢ The relaxations of the low-index BiOI surfaces are relatively small. â¢ There are a few surface states below the bottom of conduction band in the first layer. â¢ The dangling bonds density of bismuth atoms determines not only the surface energy, but also the surface relaxation. â¢ The thermodynamic\n\nIO and OI.

Mutations in the type I collagen genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) mainly cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We describe a patient with clinical signs of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), including fragile skin, easy bruising, recurrent luxations, and fractures resembling mild OI. Biochemical collagen analysis of the patients' dermal fibroblasts showed faint overmodification of the type I collagen bands, a finding specific for structural defects in type I collagen. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing detected an in-frame deletion in exon 44 of COL1A1 (c.3150_3158del), resulting in the deletion of three amino acids (p.Ala1053_Gly1055del) in the collagen triple helix. This COL1A1 mutation was hitherto identified in four probands with lethal OI, and never in EDS patients. As the peaks on the electropherogram corresponding to the mutant allele were decreased in intensity, we performed next generation sequencing of COL1A1 to study mosaicism in skin and blood. While approximately 9% of the reads originating from fibroblast gDNA harbored the COL1A1 deletion, the deletion was not detected in gDNA from blood. Most likely, the mild clinical symptoms observed in our patient can be explained by the mosaic state of the mutation.

Utilizing harmless and renewable visible light to supply energy for micro-/nanomotors in water represents a great challenge. In view of the outstanding photocatalytic performance of bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI), visible-light-driven BiOI-based Janus micromotors have been developed, which can be activated by a broad spectrum of light, including blue and green light. Such BiOI-based Janus micromotors can be propelled by photocatalytic reactions in pure water under environmentally friendly visible light without the addition of any other chemical fuels. The remote control of photocatalytic propulsion by modulating the power of visible light is characterized by velocity and mean-square displacement analysis of optical video recordings. In addition, the self-electrophoresis mechanism has been confirmed for such visible-light-driven BiOI-based Janus micromotors by demonstrating the effects of various coated layers (e.g., Al 2 O 3 , Pt, and Au) on the velocity of motors. The successful demonstration of visible-light-driven Janus micromotors holds a great promise for future biomedical and environmental applications.\n\nMyths about OI (Osteogenesis Imperfecta)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n...

Herein, we have reported a novel heterostructure of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs coated with BiOI nanosheets as an efficient VLD photocatalyst, which was prepared via a simple solvothermal method. The morphology and structure were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, and specific surface area measurements. The results showed that BiOI nanosheets were well deposited on MWCNTs. The MWCNTs/BiOI composites exhibited remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB, methyl orange (MO, and para-chlorophenol (4-CP under visible-light, compared with pure BiOI. When the MWCNTs content is 3 wt %, the MWCNTs/BiOI composite (3%M-Bi achieves the highest activity, which is even higher than that of a mechanical mixture (3 wt % MWCNTs + 97 wt % BiOI. The superior photocatalytic activity is predominantly due to the strong coupling interface between MWCNTs and BiOI, which significantly promotes the efficient electron-hole separation. The photo-induced holes (h+ and superoxide radicals (O2â mainly contribute to the photocatalytic degradation of RhB over 3%M-Bi. Therefore, the MWCNTs/BiOI composite is expected to be an efficient VLD photocatalyst for environmental purification.\n\nIn memory of Jean-FranÃ§ois StÃ©phan\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBlanchet, RenÃ©\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis thematic issue of Comptes rendus Geoscience has been assembled to honor the memory of our late colleague and friend Jean-FranÃ§ois StÃ©phan, whose remarkable scientific and community-directed activity has left a deep imprint on both the French and the International Earth Science communities.

Owing to broad visible light absorption (up to 660 nm), the as-obtained Pt-BiOI electrode was used as effective photoelectrocatalyst in the application of catalytic ethanol oxidation in alkaline media under visible light irradiation. Compared to dark condition, the Pt-BiOI modified electrode displayed 3 times improved catalytic activity towards ethanol oxidation under visible light irradiation. The synergistic effect of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic, and the unique of 2D structures contribute to the improvement of catalytic activity. The mechanism of enhanced photoelectrocatalytic process is proposed. The present results suggest that 2D visible-light-activated BiOI can be served as promising support for the decoration of Pt and applied in the fields of photoelectrochemical and photo-assisted fuel cell applications\n\nFranÃ§ois Grabowski ( 1939â2008 )\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe are saddened by the news that our colleague FranÃ§ois Grabowski passed away at the end of April.

Herein, a series of BiOI/BiOCl films coating on FTO were fabricated through a simple method at room temperature. The photocatalytic efficiency of 30%BiOI/BiOCl could reach more than 99% aiming to degrading RhB and MB after 90 and 120 min, respectively. Compared with BiOCl, 30%BiOI/BiOCl showed 12 times higher efficiency when degrading RhB. In comparison with BiOI, 30%BiOI/BiOCl showed 5 and 6 times higher efficiency when degrading RhB and MB, respectively. These obvious enhancements were attributed to expanded visible light absorption and high separation performance of photoinduced charge. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of 30%BiOI/BiOCl had no obvious decrease after five recycles, suggesting that it was a promising photocatalyst for the removal of MB and RhB pollutants. Finally, the possible growth process for the BiOI/BiOCl thin films and photocatalysis mechanism were investigated in details.

The Ge content and structure parameters of SiGe-OI optical waveguides are respectively optimized. Under an operation wavelength of 1300 nm, the structures of SiGe-OI rib optical waveguides are built and analyzed with Optiwave software, and the optical field and transmission losses of the SiGe-OI rib optical waveguides are analyzed. The optimization results show that when the structure parameters H, h, W are respectively 500 nm, 250 nm, 500 nm and the Ge content is 5%, the total power loss of SiGe-OI rib waveguides is 0.3683 dB/cm considering the loss of radiation outside the waveguides and materials, which is less than the traditional value of 0.5 dB/cm. The analytical technique for SiGe-OI optical waveguides and structure parameters computed by this paper are proved to be accurate and computationally efficient compared with the beam propagation method (BPM) and the experimental results.

The photocatalyst had been characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, nitrogen sorption (BET), field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UVâvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The photocatalytic activity, which was evaluated by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and bisphenol A (BPA) under visible light irradiation, was enhanced significantly by loading Ag/AgI/BiOI nanoparticles onto rectorite. The photogenerated holes and superoxide radical (Â·O{sub 2}{sup â}) were both formed as active species for the photocatalytic reactions under visible light irradiation.

These compounds are often toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic to living organisms, chemically and photochemically stable, and non-biodegradable. Acid red 18 is one of the azo dyes that are currently used in the textile industries. Photocatalytic degradation offers a great potential as an advanced oxidation process, in this study photocatalytic degradation of Acid red 18 by using BiOI/ZnO nanocomposite was evaluated under visible light irradiation. The influence of most essential parameters such as pH and BiOI/ZnO dosage were studied for optimum conditions. The dye removal efficiency was 85.1% at optimum experimental conditions of pH of 7, and BiOI/ZnO dosage of 1.5Â g/L. The data had a good agreement with pseudo first-order kinetic model. Thus, the BiOI/ZnO/UV is an efficient process for dye degradation.

A ternary phase diagram in a water/C12EO25/EHMC system at 25Â°C was constructed and the two-phase equilibrium of an oil phase and an I1 phase, which is necessary to prepare the O/I1-type emulsions, was confirmed. Also, the melting of the I1 phase into a fluid micellar solution phase was confirmed, allowing emulsification by a heating-cooling process. The O/I1-type emulsions were formulated in the ternary system as well as a quaternary system. The four-component system contained an additional cosolvent, isopropyl myristate (IPM). The use of the cosolvent allows the use of reduced amounts of EHMC, which is desirable because EHMC can cause temporary skin irritation. Formulation of the O/I1-type emulsions with other UV absorbing agents (OCR and TBMP) was also possible using the same emulsification method. When IPM was changed to tripalmitin, which has a melting point greater than room temperature, a solid-oil dispersion in I1 phase was formed. We have termed this a \"solidin-cubic phase (S/I1) type dispersion\". These novel emulsions have not been reported previously. The UV absorbability of the O/I1-type emulsions and S/I1-type dispersions that encapsulate the UV absorbing agents was confirmed by measurement of UV absorption spectra.\n\nDiatomite-immobilized BiOI hybrid photocatalyst: Facile deposition synthesis and enhanced photocatalytic activity\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLi, Baoying; Huang, Hongwei; Guo, Yuxi; Zhang, Yihe\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGraphical abstract: - Highlights: â¢ A novel diatomite-immobilized BiOI hybrid photocatalyst has been prepared by a facile one-step deposition process for the first time. â¢ The diatomite-immobilized BiOI hybrid photocatalyst exhibits much better photocatalytic performance. â¢ This enhancement should be attributed to that diatomite can play as an excellent carrier platform to increase the reactive sites and promote the separation of photogenerated electronâhole pairs. â¢ This work shed new light on facile fabrication of novel composite photocatalyst based on natural mineral. - Abstract: A novel diatomite-immobilized BiOI hybrid photocatalyst has been prepared by a facile one-step deposition process for the first time.

The as-prepared porous BiOI nanoplates exhibited excellent adsorption ability, and the saturated extent of adsorption of BiOI over an RhB solution was as high as 197 mg/g, which is much higher than those for BiOCl and BiOBr prepared via the same method and with a similar surface area. The probable adsorption mechanism could have originated from the interaction between the I atom in BiOI and a proton in RhB at different pH values and temperatures. With visible light irradiation ({lambda} > 420 nm), 80 % of the RhB was degraded in 4 h, while BiOI still demonstrated reasonably outstanding photocatalytic ability under green light ({lambda} = 550 {+-} 15 nm) because of its low-energy gap (1.72 eV). The degradation test for BiOI under irradiation at {lambda} = 550 {+-} 15 nm is an excellent achievement for field applications because the catalyst can be applied in solar irradiation to remove organic pollutants, which may be of great value BiOI complex.\n\nDiatomite-immobilized BiOI hybrid photocatalyst: Facile deposition synthesis and enhanced photocatalytic activity\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLi, Baoying; Huang, Hongwei; Guo, Yuxi; Zhang, Yihe\n\n2015-10-01\n\nA novel diatomite-immobilized BiOI hybrid photocatalyst has been prepared by a facile one-step deposition process for the first time.

Reduction of graphene oxide (GO) took place in the process of solvothermal reaction and a new Bi-C bond between rGO and 50%BiOCl/BiOI was formed. The introduction of rGO affected the morphology of 50%BiOCl/BiOI, resulting in the transformation of 50%BiOCl/BiOI from solid microspheres to hollow microspheres. Both the introduction of rGO and formation of 50%BiOCl/BiOI hollow microspheres can facilitate the light absorption. The strong interaction between 50%BiOCl/BiOI and rGO and the electrical conductivity of rGO greatly improved the effective separation of photogenerated carriers. Hence, GOB-5 demonstrated the highest photocatalytic activity which was over twice of the pristine 50%BiOCl/BiOI in the presence of visible light. Mechanism study revealed that 50%BiOCl/BiOI generated electrons and holes in the presence of visible light, and holes together with rad O2- generated from reduction of O2 by electrons degraded the pollutant directly. Overall, this work provides an excellent reference to the synthesis of chemically bonded BiOX/BiOY (X, Y = Cl, Br, I)/rGO nanocomposite and helps to promote their applications in environmental protection and photoelectric conversion.\n\nValidity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Optimality Index-US (OI-US) to assess maternity care outcomes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYucel, Cigdem; Taskin, Lale; Low, Lisa Kane\n\n2015-12-01\n\nAlthough obstetrical interventions are used commonly in Turkey, there is no standardized evidence-based assessment tool to evaluate maternity care outcomes. The Optimality Index-US (OI-US) is an evidence-based tool that was developed for the purpose of measuring aggregate perinatal care processes and outcomes against an optimal or best possible standard. This index has been validated and used in Netherlands, USA and UK until now. The objective of this study was to adapt the OI-US to assess maternity care outcomes in Turkey. Translation and back translation were used to develop the Optimality Index-Turkey (OI-TR) version. To evaluate the content validity of the OI-TR, an expert panel group (n=10) reviewed the items and evidence-based quality of the OI-TR for application in Turkey. Following the content validity process, the OI-TR was used to assess 150 healthy and 150 high-risk pregnant women who gave birth at a high volume, urban maternity hospital in Turkey. The scores between the two groups were compared to assess the discriminant validity of the OI-TR. The percentage of agreement between two raters and the Kappa statistic were calculated to evaluate the reliability. Content validity was established for the OI-TR by an expert group. Discriminant validity was confirmed by comparing the OI scores of healthy pregnant women (mean OI score=77.65%) and those of high-risk pregnant women (mean OI score=78.60%). The percentage of agreement between the two raters was 96.19, and inter-rater agreement was provided for each item in the OI-TR. OI-TR is a valid and reliable tool that can be used to assess maternity care outcomes in Turkey. The results of this study indicate that although the risk statuses of the women differed, the type of care they received was essentially the same, as measured by the OI-TR. Care was not individualised based on risk and for a majority of items was inconsistent with evidence based practice, which is not optimal. Use of the OI-TR will help to\n\nStudy on gas-liquid loop reactors with annular bubbling\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFei, L.M.; Wang, S.X.; Wu, X.Q.; Lu, D.W.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nBubbling column with draft tube is one of nearly developed reactor.

B.; Stapelfeldt, K.; Varghese, P. L.; Trafton, L. M.; Evans, R. W.\n\n2010-06-01\n\nWe present a Monte Carlo (MC) model of [OI] 6300 Ã and [SII] 6716 Ã emission from Io entering eclipse. The simulation accounts for the 3-D distribution of SO 2, O, SO, S, and O 2 in Io's atmosphere, several volcanic plumes, and the magnetic field around Io. Thermal electrons from the jovian plasma torus are input along the simulation domain boundaries and move along the magnetic field lines distorted by Io, occasionally participating in collisions with neutrals. We find that the atmospheric asymmetry resulting from varying degrees of atmospheric collapse across Io (due to eclipse ingress) and the presence of volcanoes contributes significantly to the unique morphology of the [OI] 6300 Ã emission. The [OI] radiation lifetime of Ë134 s limits the emission to regions that have a sufficiently low neutral density so that intermolecular collisions are rare. We find that at low altitudes (typically Pele, Prometheus, etc.) the number density is large enough (>4 Ã 10 9 cm -3) to collisionally quench nearly all (>95%) of the excited oxygen for reasonable quenching efficiencies. Upstream (relative to the plasma flow), Io's perturbation of the jovian magnetic field mirrors electrons with high pitch angles, while downstream collisions can trap the electrons. This magnetic field perturbation is one of the main physical mechanisms that results in the upstream/downstream brightness asymmetry in [OI] emission seen in the observation by Trauger et al. (Trauger, J.T., Stapelfeldt, K.R., Ballester, G.E., Clarke, J.I., 1997. HST observations of [OI] emissions from Io in eclipse. AAS-DPS Abstract (1997DPS29.1802T)). There are two other main causes for the observed brightness asymmetry. First, the observation's viewing geometry of the wake spot crosses the dayside atmosphere and therefore the wake's observational field of view includes higher oxygen column density than the upstream side. Second, the phased entry into eclipse results in less atmospheric collapse and thus higher\n\nParticules de vie conversation avec FranÃ§ois Englert\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBarÃ©, FranÃ§ois\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCe fut l'Ã©vÃ©nement de l'annÃ©e 2013 : FranÃ§ois Englert obtenait le prix Nobel de physique pour la dÃ©couverte du boson.

The structure and optical properties of g-C3N4/I3--BiOI composites were systematically characterized by means of XRD, SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XPS, N2 adsorption/desorption, UV-vis DRS, PL. The g-C3N4/I3--BiOI composites, with heterojunction between porous g-C3N4 and BiOI ultrathin nanosheets, were firstly applied for the photocatalytic elimination of ppm-leveled CH3SH under LED visible light illumination. The g-C3N4/I3--BiOI heterojunction with 10% g-C3N4 showed a dramatically enhanced photocatalytic activity in removal of CH3SH compared with pure BiOI and g-C3N4, due to its effective interfacial charge transfer and separation. The adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation of CH3SH over g-C3N4/I3--BiOI were deeply explored by in situ DRIFTS, and the intermediates and conversion pathways were elucidated and compared. Furthermore, on the basis of reactive species trapping, ESR and Mott-Schottky experiments, it was revealed that the responsible reactive species for catalytic CH3SH composotion were h+, Â·O2- and 1O2, thus, the g-C3N4/I3--BiOI heterojunction followed an indirect all-solid state Z-scheme charge transfer mode with self-stabilized I3-/I- pairs as redox mediator, which could accelerate the separation of photo-generated charge and enhance the redox reaction power of charged carriers simultaneously.\n\nPhotocatalytic removal of tetrabromobisphenol A by magnetically separable flower-like BiOBr/BiOI/Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} hybrid nanocomposites under visible-light irradiation\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGao, Shengwang [Department of Chemistry, College of Science, North University of China, Taiyuan 030051 (China); State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012 (China); Guo, Changsheng; Hou, Song; Wan, Li [State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012 (China); Wang, Qiang [Heilongjiang Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Harbin 150056 (China); Lv, Jiapei; Zhang, Yuan [State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012 (China); Gao, Jianfeng [Department of Chemistry, College of Science, North University of China, Taiyuan 030051 (China); Meng, Wei [State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012 (China); Xu, Jian, E-mail: xujian@craes.org.cn [State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, Beijing 100012 (China)\n\n2017-06-05\n\nHighlights: â¢ A novel BiOBr/BiOI/Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} hybrid nanocomposites was prepared for the first time. â¢ BiOBr-BiOI-Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} (2:2:0.5) displays superior photocatalytic activity for TBBPA. â¢ Good magnetic property makes it easy for the materialâs recovery from solution. â¢ The photocatalytic reaction mechanism of BiOBr/BiOI/Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} was proposed. â¢ Superoxide radical is the dominant ROS in TBBPA degradation. - Abstract: A novel flower-like three-dimensional BiOBr/BiOI/Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} heterojunction photocatalyst was synthesized using a simple in situ co-precipitation method at room temperature. The hybrid composites were characterized by a couple of techniques including X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, photoluminescence technique, and vibrating sample magnetometer. Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} nanoparticles were perfectly loaded on the surface of BiOBr/BiOI microspheres. The recyclable magnetic BiOBr/BiOI/Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} was employed to degrade TBBPA under visible light irradiation. The optimal removal efficiency of the ternary BiOBr/BiOI/Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} (2:2:0.5) nanocomposite reached up to 98.5% for TBBPA in aqueous solution. The superior photocatalytic activity of BiOBr/BiOI/Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} was mainly ascribed to large surface area and appropriate energy gaps, resulting in the effective adsorption and separation of electrons-hole pairs. The photogenerated reactive species determined by free radicals trapping experiments revealed that the excellent catalytic activity was primarily driven by Â·O{sub 2}{sup â} radical. The photocatalytic degradation kinetics and a detailed mechanism were also proposed.

We previously reported that BiOAc exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity for rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under UV light irradiation. Herein, by an ion exchange approach, BiOI/BiOAc heterojunction could be easily obtained. The as-prepared heterojunction possessed enhanced photodegradation activity for multiple dyes including RhB and methyl orange (MO) under visible light illumination in comparison with individual materials. Good visible-light photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction could be attributed to the increased visible light response, effective charge transfer from the modified band position and close interfacial contact due to partial ion exchange method.\n\nNotable light-free catalytic activity for pollutant destruction over flower-like BiOI microspheres by a dual-reaction-center Fenton-like process.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Liang; Yan, Dengbiao; Lyu, Lai; Hu, Chun; Jiang, Ning; Zhang, Lili\n\n2018-10-01\n\nBiOI is widely used as photocatalysts for pollutant removal, water splitting, CO 2 reduction and organic transformation due to its excellent photoelectric properties. Here, we report for the first time that a light-free catalyst consisting of the flower-like BiOI microspheres (f-BiOI MSs) exposing (1â¯0â¯1) and (1â¯1â¯0) crystal planes prepared by a hydrothermal method in ethylene glycol environment can rapidly eliminate the refractory BPA within only â¼3â¯min through a Fenton-like process. The reaction activity is â¼190 times higher than that of the conventional Fenton catalyst Fe 2 O 3 . A series of characterizations and experiments reveal the formation of the dual reaction centers on f-BiOI MSs. The electron-rich O centers efficiently reduce H 2 O 2 to OH, while the electron-poor oxygen vacancies capture electrons from the adsorbed pollutants and divert them to the electron-rich area during the Fenton-like reactions. By these processes, pollutants are degraded and mineralized quickly in a wide pH range. Our findings address the problems of the classical Fenton reaction and are useful for the development of efficient Fenton-like catalysts through constructing dual reaction centers.

In this study, BiOIO 3 was chosen to form a hetero-structure with BiOI, due to its internal polar field and good lattice matching with BiOI. The interfacial properties and band offsets were focused on and analyzed in detail by DFT calculations. The results show that the charge depletion and accumulation mainly occur in the region near the interface. This effect leads to an interfacial electric field and thus, the photo-generated electron-hole pairs can be easily separated and transferred along opposite directions at the interface, which is significant for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, according to the analysis of band offsets, the vertical BiOI/BiOIO 3 belongs to the type-II hetero-structure, while the in-plane BiOI/BiOIO 3 belongs to the type-I hetero-structure. The former type of hetero-structure has more favorable effects to enhance the photocatalytic activity of BiOI than that of the latter type of hetero-structure. In the case of the vertical BiOI/BiOIO 3 hetero-structure, photo-generated electrons can move from the conduction band of BiOI to that of BiOIO 3 , while holes can move from the valence band of BiOIO 3 to that of BiOI under solar radiation. In addition, the introduced internal electric field functions as a selector that can promote the separation of photo-generated carriers, resulting in the higher photocatalytic quantum efficiency. These findings illustrate the underlying mechanism for the reported experiments, and can be used as a basis for the design of novel highly efficient composite photocatalysts with hetero-structures.\n\nExercise and Activity: Key Elements in the Management of OI\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n... with peers.

In order to evaluate the advantages of the SSPBD reactor, it was compared with traditional surface discharge (SD) reactor and packed-bed discharge (PBD) reactor in terms of the discharge voltage, discharge current, and ozone formation. The SSPBD reactor exhibited a faster rising time and lower tail voltage than the SD and PBD reactors. The distribution of the active species generated in different discharge regions of the SSPBD reactor was analyzed by optical emission spectra and ozone analysis. It was found that the packed-bed discharge region (3.5 mg/L), rather than the surface discharge region (1.3 mg/L) in the SSPBD reactor played a more important role in ozone generation. The optical emission spectroscopy analysis indicated that more intense peaks of the active species (e.g. N2 and OI) in the optical emission spectra were observed in the packed-bed region.

Their photocatalytic activities were evaluated by methylene blue (MB) under the simulated solar light. The results indicate that the spherical Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} particles were coated with BiOI sheath when the sample were synthesized at 160Â Â°C with ethylene glycol and deionized water, forming a core/shell structure. The degradation rate of MB assisted with the core/shell Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4}/BiOI catalysts reached 98Â % after 40-min irradiation. The catalytic performance enhancement of the core/shell Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4}/BiOI catalysts mainly attributes to the band structure that can improve the generation efficiency, separation and transfer process of the photo-induced electronâhole pairs and decrease their recombination.
