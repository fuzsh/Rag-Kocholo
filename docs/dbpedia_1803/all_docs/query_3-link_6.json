        "text": "King John V of Portugal, who ruled between 1707 and 1750, adopted an ambitious diplomatic policy towards the Holy See in order to project an image of Portugal abroad that could match the great European powers. In accordance with this procedure, arts and music assumed a key role in the representation of the Portuguese Crown in the Papal City. The conclave that following the death of Clement XI in 1721, which elected Michelangelo Conti — apostolic nuncio in Lisbon between 1698 and 1709 — as Pope Innocent XIII, contributed to strengthen these actions. Cardinals Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde and José Pereira de Lacerda travelled to Rome and remained some years in the city. Like the ambassadors and other diplomatic agents, they quickly assimilated the main features of Roman polycentric society and its courtly culture. Besides the artistic and ceremonial investment related to their titular churches (Sant’Anastasia and Santa Susanna), they became members of Accademia dell’Arcadia and were promoters and commissioners of musical works performed in their residences and in other venues (the national church of Sant’Antonio dei Portoghesi, the Collegio Romano, the Collegio Clementino and the Teatro Capranica), involving composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti, Carlo Cesarini, Francesco Gasparini, Giuseppe Orlandini and Giuseppe Amadori. At that time, some of the most talented Portuguese composers of the Baroque era (that is Francisco António de Almeida, António Teixeira and João Rodrigues Esteves) were studying in Rome. The musical activities fostered by the Portuguese cardinals were firstly pointed out in the context of wider studies by Saverio Franchi and Manuel Carlos de Brito, but a research directly focused on their musical patronage has not been carried out so far. New historical sources, found recently in Rome, Lisbon and Toledo, may provide a more accurate picture in order to clarify the main artistic networks and the role of music within the cardinals’ duties regarding political and ecclesiastical representation. Moreover, the study will consider the impact of the Roman experience after their return to Lisbon, in terms of cultural and musical transfer.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the Florentine composer Giuseppe Maria Orlandini (1676-1760) was one of the protagonists of the Italian operatic scene with an extensive production represented in the most prominent centres, such as Venice, Naples, Bologna and Milan, and also abroad, especially in Germany. As a proof of the prominence of his role, Benedetto Marcello took inspiration from Orlandini for the “Orlando” character in his satirical pamphlet Il Teatro alla Moda (1720). In recent years, the modern edition of Orlandini’s opera Nerone in the version of his contemporary German composer Johann Mattheson (ed. by R. Strohm, 2012) has contributed to reignite the attention on his remarkable artistic value and the need to investigate deeper the gure and work of this Italian composer. However, if Orlandini’s fame originated mainly from his operas, very few pieces of information are known about another relevant aspect of his music production today considered lost: the oratorios. is genre was indeed particularly crucial in Orlandini’s artistic path since the very beginning of his carrier with \"Il martirio di San Sebastiano \"(1694) and throughout his whole life until his death in 1760. Most of his oratorios and oratorio-pastiches were written to be performed in Florence, the city where he carried on his career also as Maestro di cappella and, brie y, as Impresario. is paper aims to present a recollection and analysis of new sources and data of Orlandini’s oratorio production, proposing an alternative insight into the composer’s figure and work through the lens of this alternative genre.\n\nThe Roman genre of the oratorio gained attention in all principal Italian centers during XVII century, founding a fertile situation in Florence, both for musical and cultural affinity. There, in the Tuscan capital, where the Catholic Church had created a parastate inside the Medici Gran-Duchy (and later the Lorena dominion), every Florentine man was affiliated to a lay company or close to a confraternity where the musical production had a prominent role in the community life. In the case of the oratorio, a real competition was engaged between institutions based on the quality of music and the execution and magnificence of the apparatus of the sacred dramatic production, in particular by the Congregation of the Oratory of San Filippo Neri. This widespread success, later in the XVII century, entered also the word of the court, where especially the Grand-Duchess of Tuscany Vittoria della Rovere, her sons Cardinal Francesco Maria de' Medici and Grand-Duke Cosimo III, and - last but not least - her nephew, the musical mecenate Great-Prince Ferdinando de' Medici, showed particular interest in the oratorio production. All of them enjoyed oratorio performances privately or in public, directly contributing to the evolution and success of this genre in Florence. Starting from the “case studies” dedicated to the Florentine oratorio by Italian Musicologists Domenico Alaleona and Guido Pasquetti at the beginning of the XX century, and later developed by John Walter Hill, the present paper aims at giving light for the first time to the role of the musical oratorio inside the Medici court."
