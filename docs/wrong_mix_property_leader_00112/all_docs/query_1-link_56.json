The economy emerged from a mild recession in 2000 with tourism, banking, and public investments leading the way. Unemployment remains high, at about 14 percent, with structural factors slowing its decline. While macroeconomic stabilization has largely been achieved, structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians. Growth, while impressively about 4% for the last several years, has been achieved through high fiscal and current account deficits. The government is gradually reducing a heavy back log of civil cases, many involving land tenure. The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural reform.\n\nGDP:\n\npurchasing power parity - $50.33 billion (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-real growth rate:\n\n3.7% (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-per capita:\n\npurchasing power parity - $11,200 (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-composition by sector:\n\nAgriculture: 8.2%\n\nIndustry: 30.1%\n\nServices: 61.7% (2004 est.)\n\nInvestment (gross fixed):\n\n28.6% of GDP (2004 est.)\n\nPopulation below poverty line:\n\n11% (2003)\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n\nLowest 10%: 3.4%\n\nHighest 10%: 24.5% (2003 est.)\n\nDistribution of family income-Gini index:\n\n29 (1998)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\n\n2.5% (2004 est.)\n\nLabor force:\n\n1.71 million (2004 est.)\n\nLabor force-by occupation:\n\nagriculture 2.7%, industry 32.8%, services 64.5% (2004)\n\nUnemployment rate:\n\n13.8% (2004 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nRevenues: $14.14 billion\n\nExpenditures: $15.65 billion, including capital expenditures of NA (2004 est.)\n\nPublic debt:\n\n41.7% of GDP (2004 est.)\n\nAgriculture-products:\n\nwheat, corn, sugar beets, sunflower seed, barley, alfalfa, clover, olives, citrus, grapes, soybeans, potatoes; livestock, dairy products\n\nIndustries:\n\nchemicals and plastics, machine tools, fabricated metal, electronics, pig iron and rolled steel products, aluminum, paper, wood products, construction materials, textiles, shipbuilding, petroleum and petroleum refining, food and beverages; tourism\n\nIndustrial production growth rate:\n\n2.7% (2004 est.)\n\nElectricity-production:\n\n12.51 billion kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-consumption:\n\n15.2 billion kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-exports:\n\n406 million kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-imports:\n\n3.966 billion kWh (2002)\n\nOil-production:\n\n21,000 bbl/day (2004 est.)\n\nOil-consumption:\n\n89,000 bbl/day (2001 est.)\n\nOil-exports:\n\nNA\n\nOil-imports:\n\nNA\n\nOil-proved reserves:\n\n93.6 million bbl (1 january 2002)\n\nNatural gas-production:\n\n1.76 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-consumption:\n\n2.84 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-exports:\n\n0 cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-imports:\n\n1.08 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-proved reserves:\n\n34.36 billion cu m (1 january 2002)\n\nCurrent account balance:\n\n$-1.925 billion (2004 est.)\n\nExports:\n\n$7.845 billion f.o.b.
