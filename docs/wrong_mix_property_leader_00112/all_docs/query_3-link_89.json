        "text": "The people of Croatia go to the polls on Sunday (27 December) to vote for the country’s third president since independence from Yugoslavia in 1990. But no candidate is expected to gain an outright majority and a run-off vote has been scheduled for 10 January.\n\nThe incumbent, Stjepan Mesić, is popular but cannot stand for a third consecutive five-year term in office. Several independent candidates are likely to take votes that would ordinarily go to the candidates of Croatia’s main parties, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) – which has ruled the country for most of its independence – and the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP).\n\nThe centre-left vote has been split by Milan Bandić, the populist mayor of Zagreb and a prominent member of the SDP, although the SDP’s official candidate, Ivo Josipović, is ahead in the polls, with around 20-25% of the vote. Bandić defied his party over the presidential nomination and is now running as an independent; polls put his support at around 15%.\n\nSplit on the right\n\nOn the centre-right, two HDZ dissidents are doing better than the party’s official candidate, Andrija Hebrang, who has around 7% of the vote, according to pollsters. Nadan Vidošević, an entrepreneur and former HDZ minister who is running as an independent, is close to Bandić’s 15% in the polls, while Dragan Primorac, a close ally of Ivo Sanader, Croatia’s prime minister until earlier this year, is predicted to get around 8-9% of the vote.\n\nThe split within the two main camps could help Vesna Pusić, a leading member of the liberal Croatian People’s Party-Liberal Democrats (HNS-LD). Pusić is an ally of Mesić’s and tough on corruption, one of the main obstacles facing Croatia in its EU membership talks.\n\nThe presidency of Croatia is a largely ceremonial role but the holder does have some powers over foreign policy, the armed forces and the country’s intelligence services.\n\nMore than 400,000 Croats living abroad are eligible to vote in Sunday’s elections, around one-tenth of the electorate."
