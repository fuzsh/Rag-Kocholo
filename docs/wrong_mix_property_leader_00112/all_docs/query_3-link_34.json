        "text": "Parliamentary elections in Croatia are just around the corner – 17 April 2024 for constituencies located within Croatia and 16 and 17 April 2024 for the 11th Constituency, i.e. for voters (citizens of Croatia) living outside Croatia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina and abroad (known as the Croatian diaspora or emigration). While Croatian governments have since 2010 done everything they could to undermine the human right of suffrage for Croatian citizens living abroad and cut drastically their seats of parliamentary representation there are still three seats for them, which is far from adequate and fair given that just under one million of eligible Croatian voters live outside Croatia and just of three within it. Both HDZ and SDP political parties have truly shown a mean spirit towards its diaspora when it comes to voting equality and respresentation and yet that same diaspora sends more money into Croatia than what it receives from its leading industry – tourism! Both HDZ and SDP governments have bombed the access to polling booths in the diaspora by introducting polling booths only at consular and diplomatic mission centres, which are to say the least, few and far between! Scandalous! But, I happily see that diaspora shall not give in or give up any time soon.\n\nIn the deluge of political parties in Croatia of all shapes and sizes, there is one that catches the eye of trust in a better future and while all others, some for decades, promissed to fight corruption and lustrate the cancerous judiciary but delivered zero steps in that direction, Determination and Justice party (OiP), led by a seasoned public activist for justice and journalist who delivers results, Karolina Vidovic Kristo, means business like no other! I myself am standing behind Vidovic Kristo and am a candidate together with a leading worldwide renowned philantropist and patriot, Australia-based Mr Marko Franovic, who heads the electoral list for the XI Constituency. I translate into English an intervju with his recently published on the Croatian War Veterans portal\n\nHere is that interview:\n\nDue to the long distances from the polling station and during the election on a working day, it is especially difficult for Croats living in the diaspora to vote in the elections of the Republic of Croatia. As far as the constitutional right to participate in the political life of the Croatian homeland is concerned the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the relevant laws in Croatia consider the diaspora part of the being of Croatian citizens, and yet, there is such cruelty in the denial of suffrage towards the diaspora that beggars belief. Why do you think this is so? Why do the authorities of the Republic of Croatia make it so difficult for Croats living outside the Republic of Croatia to exercise their human and constitutional right to vote in elections?\n\n“All that was planned by the Yugoslavs, that is, those nostalgic for the former state, and imagine the awful irony here – almost 94% of Croatian voters voted in the 1991 referendum to leave communist Yugoslavia, and how very much blood was shed to defend Croatia in the Homeland War. The Yugoslavs never loved nor will they ever love the Croatian emigration or those who fled communism because they also invented the word ‘diaspora’, too many foreign words are used, ’emigration’ should be used, I am not the one to speak modern, I speak the common language, the first Croatian language, they want to remove us from our homeland in every way . When the liberation of our homeland came, we had polling stations in all the Croatian clubs, you could vote all over Australia and also all over the countries where the Croats of the emigration lived. When the new President of the Republic of Croatia, Stjepan Mesic, who has been called a perjurer – who tried to criminalise the Homeland War and turned our defense against aggression into equating the victim with the aggressor – and Prime Minister Ivica Racan, who destroyed the most by selling off Croatia to foreigners, came, the evil-doers were saying that Franjo Tuđman had sold it out. Namely, all that was sold in the beginning were small things, and a lot of smaller companies were bought by Croats from the emigration, with the plan to help the development of the newly independent Croatia. So all these were little things compared to everything that was sold out when Ivica Racan came. During the mandate of Ivica Racan, INA (the biggest petroleum company) was sold off, and this trend of sell-offs continued in that mandate and then in the mandate of HDZ after Racan, Croatian banks were sold off, first they filled them with money and then gave them to foreigners. Today, we only have the Postal Bank, all the others were given to foreigners and other foreign banks were brought to Croatia. And these same banks in Croatia charge much higher interest rates than they do in other countries. That’s what Racan and Mesic contributed to us, and all that continued with Zoran Milanovic as Prime Minister. Nothing was done better, not even with Mr. Andrej Plenkovic as Prime Minister, all the investments he brought to Croatia were mostly Serbian investments. Normally, European Union funds fall into an another category because the European Union would provide funds regardless of who is in power in Croatia because it is of interest to it. And you see, emigration sends to Croatia more money than tourism contributes to it it, which is Croatia’s biggest industry, so they also disparage us and steal our right to equality in voting. There you have the media, almost all the media in Croatia work for Plenkovic, not only the main televisions but also internet portals have been bribed by his politics. I became convinced during the last six months that he therefore also bought the portals. Well, he didn’t bribe Z1 television, that was taken by Mario Radic, but Mario Radic obviously works for him, for Plenkovic, so it’s the same as if Plenkovic also bribed Z1 television; and today we know very well ‘what a drill can’t do, money can’.\n\nIf you were to win the elections and become a member of parliament for Croats outside of the Republic of Croatia, in unison with Karolina Vidovic Kristo’s Determination and Justice party, what would you fight for the hardrst in the Croatian Parliament? What changes would you fight for the most?\n\n“First, I would work to introduce electronic and postal voting, because with that the matter of voting would be brought to its rightful place, The dead would no longer have to rise from their graves to vote, and emigrants, wherever they lived, would have the opportunity to vote and exercise their right. This is how they canceled everything for us, they kicked us out of the game because we are not desirable to them, they know what Arsen Bauk once said that there will never be electronic voting, as far as I remember, because if rgere was they would never come to power. And apparently, the HDZ government also thinks the same. If they deserved it and when the majority of citizens voted, they would come to power, but if they didn’t deserve it, then the people would vote in the majority for others. Since the year 2000, the results of the elections have revolved around political cliques, embezzlement, declared theft of votes and even dead bodies. The emigrants know very well who is for the homeland and who is not, and who is pretending to be a patriot while stealing from the state’s wallet.”\n\nIn your opinion, what are the biggest problems that hinder and block Croatia’s progress into a functional democratic state and the rule of law?\n\n“The biggest problem is the judiciary. As we are all equal before God, so we must be equal before the judiciary (law), and not for judges to put cases that come to them in drawers. Cases should be solved as they come to them. Croatia has laws like any other country, but they are not used properly and no one controls it or bears the consequences for such incorrect work and such a terrible attitude towards justice and the judiciary. It is obvious that in Croatia the judiciary and the law work only for or in support of certain people or, rather, some political agenda. Those who rule protect themselves and this has been proven hundreds of times.”\n\nYou are 82 years old. It could be said that you have been working hard all your life, you have been helping financially and with kindness for decades a large number of needy people and associations in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Australia and all over the world, you are a leading businessman from any side of the world we look at. So what motivated you the most to support Karolina Vidovic Kristo and the party Determination and Justice?\n\n“I saw that she is a real leader, and leaders are not born every day. We know that leaders are the most important element of everything, be it in war or in running the country, and I am convinced that Karolina Vidovic Kristo does not work for any foreign or domestic tycoon because she fights against any form of corruption and we know what tycoons are. I often see that tycoons come during the night as thieves do because most are the most ordinary thieves, there is no doubt about that as far as I am concerned. If someone says that he earned his wealth with his ten fingers, all credit to him, we should praise him, but we must not have thieves among us because they destroy the homeland. They are bigger enemies of our Croatia than its neighbours. Karolina Vidovic Kristo and her people have the strength to make Croatia into the one we shed our blood for. I am convinced that there is no compromise for her – because she knows that a thief is a thief, corruption is corruption, and the judiciary is Croatia’s biggest cancer. Croatia needs a strong and determined person like Karolina Vidovic Kristo at the head. “\n\nYou lead the OiP Electoral List for the XI Constituency in the upcoming elections for the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia, so tell us, are you hoping for good results?\n\n“Here, a few days ago we celebrated the resurrection of Jesus, the birth of new life and new hope, victory over death. I have a great desire to bring about changes in Croatia that will eradicate corruption to the extent that it no longer defines Croatia and to cleanse the judiciary of this scourge of oppression, due to which justice and fairness cannot rise to the surface and remain on it. And with that desire is my hope that is great. My hope did not appear now because it is in me and my work for a just Croatia and has been for almost my entire life. These upcoming elections are equally, if not more, important for Croatia and Croats around the world than those of 1990 and 1991. It is necessary for the needed changes in Croatia that as many people as possible vote and that the masses of people who, I believe, are disappointed in te leadership of the state and thus have stopped voting in elections a long time ago. I hope for a great voter turnout in the elections, and as I said, the Determination and Justice led by Karolina Vidovic Kristo has the strength, courage, and the knowledge to organise and fix Croatia into the country that our people with all their sacrifices deserve.\n\nI am immensely proud that I lead a group of really great, capable and proud Croatian men and women on that electoral list. I think that my personal advocacy and financial assistance over the decades for the rights and well-being of Croats both in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina are widely known, so I would not talk about it now. It is a great honour for me to point out here that our electoral list includes a candidate who lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina – a well-known fighter for truth and justice, Mr. Mile Kovac. It could be said that Mr. Kovac was a Croatian defender even before the first gun was fired in the Homeland War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and his extensive experience in the media and his expertise in electronics and IT speak volumes about his ability to make changes, which the electoral list that I lead plans on delivering. On the electoral list that I lead, there are also other candidates whose lives are filled with expertise in various areas of life, Croatian patriotism and the fight for truth and justice, namely: Ina Vukic from Australia – known throughout the world as a decorated Croatian activist and expert in the field of mental of health and disability, Ivana Kovacevic-Mandac from Canada – law expert and awarded long-time Croatian activist, Ruzica Alvir – master’s degree and expert in social pedagogy and returnee to Croatia from Germany, and Ante Susnjara from Germany – successful entrepreneur. Normally, I could say a lot more good things about all the candidates on Election List No. 3 for Croats outside Croatia, but for now, when I look at that list of candidates, it, along with all the other election lists in all the Electoral Units in which OiP competes in the upcoming elections, is a great reflection of love and ability to fix Croatia, where law and justice reign for everyone equally, and we want to contribute to achieving that for Croatia and all Croats.”\n\nIF YOU ARE A CITIZEN OF CROATIA AND VOTING AT THESE ELECTIONS CHOOS AWAYS LIST No.3!\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nYou simply know that your country’s president is a devastating and appalling waste of space when it comes to honouring the people’s wish for independence from communist Yugoslavia and your people’s fight for that independence by the persons he chooses to represent him at various events, who are equally a waste of space. During the past week Croatia’s President Zoran Milanovic sent as his representative the former President of Croatia, the former President of communist Yugoslavia (Stjepan Mesic) to the commemoration of victims of the Danica camp in WWII Croatia (where communists and Serbs say 5,000 people perished but any history written by Yugoslav communists cannot be trusted, even though only one victim is one too many)! That message says a great deal. Milanovic knows that Stjepan Mesic is the leader of the pack when it comes to liars and that he was a war profiteer, scavenging away into his own pockets bundles of funds donated by the Croatian diaspora for humanitarian needs of victims of the 1990’s Serb aggression against Croatia and for defence of Croatia. Part of evidence for the latter has certainly surfaced in a civil court case in the city of Split between 2017 – 2019.\n\nBut despite the evidence and testimonies presented in that court that strongly indicate that Stjepan Mesic did engage in criminal activities of war-profiteering, none of that evidence or indications seem to have been referred to or directed to the office of public prosecutor by the court in Split. But then again, Croatia is no full democracy. It still protects communist thieves and liars that define Croatia on basis of corruption.\n\nAnd so, Mesic said at Danica site last week: “I hope that the Ustasha movement will stop one day, and then it will stop if we remember these events which are facts, which cannot be changed, because in history only what happened, happened.”\n\nThen he went on to say: “The state government should first of all stop financing those who falsify history, such as those who claim that the Jasenovac camp continued to function after 1945: This is a notorious lie.”\n\nHad Mesic, forgetful of his own previous statements, not here labeled himself as a notorious liar, one might be tempted to believe him but it is terribly difficult to believe him when he, himself, is one of those leading people of former Yugoslavia who revealed to the world that Jasenovac camp did remain open after WWII ended and in there innocent Croatian people who fought for independent Croatia were murdered and exterminated at the hands of Yugoslav communists. Now he wants people who promote that fact to be cut off from financial help! He obviously forgets what he says from day to day. Not because of some problem with Alzheimer’s disease but because he is a person that will say and do anything in order to promote the criminal regime of former communist Yugoslavia, or, if circumstance so demands – “suck up” to the other political side for personal gain.\n\nIn 2017, Stjepan Mesic stated publicly: “Don’t be fooled, Jasenovac worked two years after the war. There are many Croats buried deep there. We will now ask for those graves to be dug up, and you will see that they are Home Guards and Ustashas. We will have to bring a world commission to see that. Tito knew that it was a forgery … in order to get bigger reparations. He was never in Jasenovac,” said Mesic, who called Jasenovac a labor camp, not a concentration camp as others have painted it.\n\nIf Croatia’s Stjepan Mesic, President Zoran Milanovic, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic – none of whom ever fought for Croatian independence and democracy but in one way or another fought against it, and still do, ensuring they hold well-paid positions they do not deserve nor have the skills to perform at successfully – think and say that Ustasha movement still exists in Croatia and its diaspora, they would in certain ways be right! Of course, the WWII Ustasha movement as per organised political force does not exist and it hasn’t existed for many decades as a formal movement since it was disbanded soon after WWII ended. What does exist today is the independence of Croatia ideology and “movement”, which, of course has, in that sense, close similarities to what the Ustasha movement was for Croatia during WWII. Independence from Yugoslavia. Mesic knows that and that is what bothers him as it does all his communist Yugoslavia “pals”! He has always worked towards running down and crushing the glory of Croatian people’s victory during 1990’s in succeeding to free themselves from the chains of communist Yugoslavia. When he became President in 2000, one of his first moves was to retire some 20 Generals of the Croatian Army and Croatian Defence Council – to cut them down, to cut down as much as he could the independence movement even though Croatia had already won its independence. But it still had a job to finish during peace time: to lustrate Croatia of communists in power.\n\nAh, someone might say: but WWII Ustasha movement had Racial laws in place and many victims were generated because of it! It did! But so did almost all other countries throughout the world at one stage or another. Just check the facts of 20th century history, and before, you will find even today the remnants of such utterly depraved laws and practices; Camps, Reservations, stolen land, stolen generations, mass graves, “Whites Only”, … The world is full of destitution and dead bodies because of it. The important thing in my mind is that every era bought its own way of achieving national goals, and many were not pretty nor justifiable, but in the historical context they fit into the order things were done by all our ancestors. Not that this justifies historical deeds that ruined lives, but it does serve as a platform upon which we learn lessons of a better future.\n\nWhat is happening in Croatia, though, is that former communist operatives are using examples of historical crimes, alleged crimes and fabricated crimes to cover up and bury the glorious efforts for independence and self-determination. They will not succeed if people at large have anything to do with it. WWII Croatia and its Ustasha movement fought for independence from Yugoslavia and in that the occupying German forces were a propping hand, however critical of that we may be; in 1990’s Croatian people fought for independence from Yugoslavia on their own. And that is the beauty of it. That is what communists like Stjepan Mesic are trying hard to dishonour. They will not succeed. The word Ustasha in essence means “rise against oppression”. Stjepan Mesic doesn’t like that. Well, tough luck for that decrepit man of “politics”, the movement of rising against the very idea of Yugoslavia is here to stay. Even in peace time. Why? Because it was oppression itself, it was criminal and murderous, it was garbage! It only served best those in Communist Party positions, the rest just lived day by day or fled out of that existential misery. It is to be hoped that Croatia will not end up like Yugoslavia even if there are no serious signs of lustration on the horizon yet to stop such misfortune. Lustrating former communists in authority or high positions within former Yugoslavia would, of course, be the ideal answer to all the problems afflicting Croatia negatively on the path of full democracy. Failing that there is always the heart that cries out for independence and truth to rely upon.

And so, on 17 May 2019, the world’s public has been served an article written by Dusan Stojanovic, “Croatia’s WWII Divisions in the Open as Merkel Visits”, not because of the need to acknowledge and respect WWII and post-WWII victims, no matter which side they were on during the war. The article is obviously served in order to prop-up anti-Croatian propaganda regarding victims without even blinking an eye at even the thought that the numbers of victims pinned to Croatian independence fight during WWII and blown out of every proportion, are in fact wrong and made up to no other end but to vilify the Croatian people who wanted Croatia’s independence as opposed to a communist Yugoslavia.\n\n“The (Ustasha) regime was responsible for sending hundreds of thousand Serbs, Jews, Roma and Croatian anti-fascists to death camps,” writes Stojanovic! He gives no source for this statement in his article. Of course, he gives no credible or factual source because there is none! The fact that there are sources based on research that give an entirely different picture, overwhelmingly discrediting the atrociously concocted estimates he helps spread does not seem to interest him.\n\nExpectedly so, Stojanovic, goes on to quote communist Yugoslavia’s last president and president of Croatia between 2000 and 2010, Stjepan Mesic, as if wanting to justify the horrendous communist crimes against Croats: “Innocent people died in the (WWII) concentration camps, in Bleiburg, the Ustasha army capitulated and they were not innocent victims.” By using this Mesic quote one cannot but conclude that Stojanovic obviously subscribes to the communist depraved thinking that an unarmed, white-flag-waving enemy soldier needs no court ruling to be proven guilty of any crimes, need not be afforded the due treatment as POW, let alone the fact that those murdered at Bleiburg were murdered after WWII had ended! Let alone the fact that both Mesic and Stojanovic and multitudes of pro-communists fail to emphasise that civilians (women, children, elderly) as well as ex-Croatian soldiers were slaughtered in masses, dumped into mass graves and pits, at Bleiburg and along the Way of the Cross, throughout Slovenia and Croatia.\n\nCommunist purges by Yugoslav communists occurred because of power-hungry intolerance towards differing political opinions or orientation. All anti-communists were murdered, incarcerated or tortured, forced to flee the country to avoid persecution and ostracising or simply existed as socially inferior citizens of communist Yugoslavia. And Stojanovic has the gall to write about the Ustashe regime as being murderous and fascist. One would expect a fairly balanced article from a source such as Associated Press or New York Times, but no – all we get as a token gesture of balance in this article is this:\n\n“During her pre-election campaign, the leader of the small Independents for Croatia far-right party, Bruna Esih, said Bleiburg represents a ‘symbol of sacrifice, suffering and freedom’”. But then, it’s a poor token gesture of balance because immediately after those words Stojanovic lets the readers know that “many in Croatia disagree.” Forgets conveniently to inform the public that those disagreeing with Bruna Esih’s words are in fact former communists who still hold power in Croatia and in whose interest it is to keep communist crimes under the carpet or to justify them, using fascism as excuse, but in that, proving to us the horrible truth that the communist regime had no tolerance for human rights to varying political allegiances or opinions.\n\nStojanovic goes on to write and says: “The memorial in Bleiburg, sponsored by Croatia’s parliament, has developed into a festival of right-wing extremism. Anti-fascist groups from Croatia, Slovenia and Austria have requested the event be banned and plan to protest on Saturday. Since last year, Austrian authorities have banned Ustasha flags, their black uniforms and insignia with letter ‘U’ at the gathering, and the local Austrian Catholic Church refused to take part in prayers held in the vast field surrounded by mountains.” He ends his article with this: “Anyone has the right to mourn their loved ones, regardless of who they were or how they ended up,” said Franjo Habulin, head of the Association of Antifascist Fighters of Croatia. “However, no civilised European country has the right to participate in commemorating the fall of fascism.”\n\nAgain, Stojanovic fails to mention that the same Franjo Habulin continues to lead events celebrating communist Yugoslavia, which as far as civilised Europe he refers to is concerned, has placed communism at the same level as fascism when it comes to condemnation of totalitarian regimes. Stojanovic does not even bother to tell the public that WWII Croatia was not a country ruled by Fascism in the full sense of its definition; it appears the innuendo that it was fascist suits many a communist regime apologetics where the victims of communist crimes are concerned. While facts tell us that Ustasha regime in WWII (whose prime goal was Independent Croatia) made profound mistakes, both on political and human life level, and imposed terror over groups of people, it was a time of war in which all sides (including the communist whose prime goal was to retain Croatia within Yugoslavia) made similarly profound mistakes and imposed terror over groups of people. Just because one side won the war, and the other didn’t, justifies nothing and especially not the crimes that brought about so many victims.\n\nThis weekend is a weekend of large significance for Croatians who have fought for, supported and cherished the independence of Croatia throughout time. It is the weekend that commemorates communist genocide against Croatians, the hundreds of thousands of innocent Croatian victims murdered by the communist Yugoslav partisans and authorities particularly from 14 May 1945 at Bleiburg, dumped tortured or murdered into mass graves along the so-called “Way of the Cross” through Slovenia and Croatia (so far some 1700 mass graves unearthed). While Stojanovic’s numbers of victims of Croatia’s WWII Ustasha regime are politically mounted estimates by communists and are increasingly proven to be wrong through research, the numbers of communist crimes victims are not estimates – the already unearthed hundreds upon hundreds of mass graves of Croatian victims speak loudly for themselves even though their voice is cruelly subdued by communist operatives or their apologetics. Lest we forget Bleiburg! Ina Vukic\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
