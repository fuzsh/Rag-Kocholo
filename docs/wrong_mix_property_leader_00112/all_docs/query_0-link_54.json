        "text": "Today, 28 February 2016 marks 120 years since the death of Dr. Ante Starcevic, one of the wisest ever born among the Croatian people. Starcevic is referred to as the father of the free Croatian nation; a well of energy for freedom and democracy that lasted and lasts.\n\nAnte Starcevic (1823-1896) was one of those Croatian politicians who had the strength to strongly resist all political parties in the then Croatia (swallowed as a territory of the Austrian and then Austro-Hungarian Empires in his lifetime). His political ideals and convictions remained consistent throughout his adult life and his assertion of Croatian rights as a distinct nation entitled to freedom and democracy of its own often left him alone and lonely in public circles. However, he did enjoy the support of only a few intellectuals, writers, youth and nationally oriented youth.\n\nIn 1861, he was appointed the chief notary of the coastal Rijeka county as well as being elected to the Croatian Parliament as Rijeka Representative; with Eugen Kvaternik, in that year Starcevic founded the Croatian Party of Rights (i.e. state’s rights) and was re-elected to the parliament in 1865, 1871, and from 1878 to his death. The founder and the leader of the Croatian Rights Movement, Starcevic was a persistent and staunch advocate of democracy, uncompromising fighter against slavery, a visionary Croatian freedom and independence, an anti-cleric and a rebel; Starcevic was sharp on the tongue and the pen as no one in his day in Croatia. The program of his Party of Rights was essentially in the tradition of the nineteenth-century nationalism and it called for the formation of an independent state of Croatia. In 1862, when Rijeka was implicated in participation in protests against the Austrian Empire, he was suspended and sentenced to one month in prison as an enemy of the regime. When he was released, Starcevic returned to working at Sram’s law firm in Zagreb, where he remained until 11 October 1871, when he was arrested again, this time on the occasion of the Rakovica Revolt. Croatian armed revolt against authorities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the revolt was soon quashed by the Imperial Austrian troops and Starcevic’s Croatian Party of Rights – abolished. Starcevic was released after two months in prison. He retained followers and after his death in 1896 his followers split and one may say it was by no surprise – the hardline to independence ideas seemed to punch wedges of divide as they did not seem to be capable of deciding which was the greatest enemy of independent Croatia: Vienna, Budapest or Belgrade. Almost a hundred years on Croats would learn, soaked in blood, that Belgrade was and had been the greatest enemy.\n\nAs Austro-Hungarian Empire ceased to exist after WWI, Croatia was forced into the Serb-led Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later/1929 renamed as Kingdom of Yugoslavia) Starcevic’s Croatian Rights Movement did not of course make any comeback; Croatia was more oppressed under the Serb dynasty than ever before and any whiff of freedom and democracy was fiercely quashed.\n\nStarcevic’s Croatian Rights movement re-emerged during WWII within the complex of Independent State of Croatia movement under Dr Ante Pavelic who considered Starcevic as spiritual father of his Ustashe forces. Pavelic was a part of revitalising Starcevic’s Croatian Rights Movement since 1919, when Croatia was attached to the oppressive Serb-led Kingdom within the former Yugoslavia territory. The success of this attempt for Croatian freedom was doomed from the start as Ante Pavelic decided to side with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy as support for achieving the goal of independence. Hence, Starcevic’s name sunk into deep mud out of which it would not rise again for decades and when it did the mud from being associated with Pavelic’s regime would stick at home and abroad. At the same time Croatian (and Yugoslav) communists led by Josip Broz Tito fought against the Nazi’s, the Fascists and Pavelic’s Ustashi forces towards the aim of keeping Croatia within Yugoslavia and thus deny it independence and freedom. Hence, it was Communist Yugoslavia that once again quashed any ideas or attempts for independent Croatia, which of course, included the outlawing of the Croatian Rights Movement.\n\nThe Movement rose again in 1990 as part of multi-party democratic system drive led by dr Franjo Tudjman for a free, independent and democratic Croatia. Starcevic was among Franjo Tudman’s favourite politicians in the history of the Croatian people. Modern Croatian Party of Rights was established in 1990 without Tudjman’s membership, though. The modern Croatian Party of Rights and it’s various alternatives did not manage to muster wide support among Croats since 1990’s and that was perhaps because of the connotation associated with it from the terrible WWII crimes committed by those whose political fodder came from Starcevic’s grand and honourable ideas. An overwhelming number of Croatians chose in late 1980’s and early 1990’s to join Franjo Tudjman’s Croatian Democratic Union and achieve the honourable and deserved dream of freedom and democracy Ante Starcevic dreamed of more than a hundred years before and before him all Croats for more than nine centuries, since the Kingdom of Croatia perished at beginning of the twelfth century.\n\nGiven that Croatia is still much influenced by the communist Yugoslavia oppressive rut, there is little done to mark Starcevic’s life and anniversaries of his death. It would seem that Starcevic suffers today still (as he did 150 years ago) – his ideas purposefully misinterpreted and misrepresented in some circles especially the pro-communist or pro-Yugoslavia ones of today. In the space of wide political and ideological divide that has plagued Croatian public discourse and served obstacles and barriers for notable progress in democratic freedom and economic well-being one cannot but think that Croatia today needs politicians of Starcevic’s caliber. In saying that such a politician in the fashion imagined by Starcevic would cut short the politicians (parliamentarians’) preoccupation with political survival and get down to the roots: worry about and act for the betterment of each individual person in the country, regardless of his/her religion or ethnic origin. Talk about Starcevic, Starcevic’s works and thoughts should take a prominent place everywhere in Croatia for, as Starcevic thought, true national independence and freedom can only be sustained with the true independence and freedom of each person.\n\n“…Therefore, survival of the government, of the State and of the Nation depends on people,” Starcevic wrote. “And I judge every system that survives, no matter what kind it is or where it is, by its fruit and that fruit shows itself most clearly in the morality and well-being of the people …States are built and ruined by people, and people are guided by freedom, well-being – fortune. Where these do not exist there can be no survival of the State, no matter how old or recognised it may be. No one has yet succeeded in forming a State or keeping it upon misfortune of its citizens…fortune is, therefore, individual people that form a nation … I do not look to see how many souls there are in a nation or a State – I look to see if all the souls in that make up the nation are happy, that they do not suffer some injustice …”\n\nLest we Croats forget this champion of freedom, independence and democracy.

(Syd)\n\nIn case the Bugatti Chiron launch a few days ago, that would set you back some cool US$2.6 million (before tax) but will take you as fast as 420kph, had you saying to yourself you could really do with a hypercar but Bugatti’s old-fashioned internal combustion is too uncool for school, never fear: the Croatian Rimac Automobili (headquarters Sveta Nedjelja, near Zagreb, Croatia) has you covered. Move over Tesla (electric car) as well – here comes the Croatian made Rimac Concept One – the fastest electric car made so far and will only set you back a cool US$1.4 million. The Croatian electric vehicle maker has been showing off the Concept One for about five years now but the production version broke cover spectacularly at the Geneva auto show on 1 March 2016.\n\nRimac Concept One was designed by a 28-year old wunderkind named Mate Rimac, a Croatian-native with some serious talent, who is also the founder and CEO of Rimac Automobili company that’s backed by investments from abroad including South America and Asia.\n\nWith 1072hp the Rimac Concept One accelerates from zero to 96 kph in 2.6 seconds. It reaches 193 kph in 6.2 seconds and has a top speed of 335 kph. Quite simply, it leaves a Tesla electric car (US manufactured car named after the 19th century Croatian born inventor and scientist Nikola Tesla) in the dust and is hailed as the fastest electric car on the planet.\n\nThe Concept One uses a pair of electric motors fed by an 82kWh lithium-ion battery pack and all-wheel torque vectoring that Rimac says provides the functions of traction control, stability control, and antilock braking by constantly calculating the optimum torque for each of the four wheels. So, the use of for electric motors mounted at the center of the both axles give the Rimac Concept One a torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system that continuously calculates optimal torque distribution between the front and rear wheels. The all-wheel drive system has four different modes –comfort, control, track and drift. Owners have the option of deactivating the system if they so desire or customizing it to suit their needs.\n\nThe car isn’t just fast. A quick look at the Concept One gives away the fine craftsmanship. No parts in the interior are plastic. Rimac opted for carbon, aluminum and alcantara, a high-end fabric found in yachts and Formula 1 cars.\n\nAnd if the Rimac Concept One isn’t enough for you, it now, literally, has an evil twin, called the Concept S that has just stepped from the shadows at the Geneva Motor Show, but instead of sporting a sinister Van Dyke beard and a menacing glare to denote the devilish difference, this doppelganger goes all-in on an aerodynamics package to put its perverse point across. The deviations are more than just skin-deep too – says auto blogger Domenick Yoney.\n\nUnseen like an ulterior motive, the Rimac Concept S turns up the wick of an already diabolically powerful electric drivetrain, adding enough muscle to turn this all-wheel-drive supercar into a megawatt machine. Boasting 1,018 kW (1,365 horsepower) at peak with 1800 Nm (1,328 pound feet) of axle-twisting torque, we mean that in the most literal sense.\n\nThis version drops some weight (50kg) and gains an additional 296hp (200kW) and 147 lb-ft (200 Nm). That drops 0.1 seconds off the 0-100kph time and more than a second from the dash to 300kph.\n\nTrue, Rimac Concept One and Concept S, or Bugatti Chiron for that matter, will go just as fast as any other car on the planet in city, town, village and any road traffic and a couple of handfuls or few dozens will own such a super super car – most will not, but, hey, one can dream.

On 23 February 2016 Dr. Slobodan Lang passed away and his passing has left many almost paralysed with grief – I am one of those. Dr. Lang was one of Croatia’s shiniest sons in all respects of the good that humanity could ever muster. He was decorated several times with medals of honour for his bravery, humanitarian work and battles for freedom and democracy. Dr. Slobodan Lang was my friend and my rock for freedom and democracy for Croatia. I already miss and will miss our frequent talks and chats so deeply. I hold it so proudly to have had his contributions to this blog: “Croatia, the War, and the Future”.\n\nDr. Slobodan Lang was born to a prominent Croatian Jewish family in Zagreb in October 1945. He believed himself to be a Croat Jew and believed in Jesus Christ, saying often that Jesus Christ had appeared to him several times. His father was prominent Croatian university professor Rikard Lang and his mother was from the notable Sorkocevic family of Dubrovnik. Lang’s paternal grandfather Ignjat Lang was president of the Jewish community Vinkovci, Croatia, and his grandmother Terezija was a housewife. In 1941, Catholic priest Hijacint Boskovic, distinguished Dubrovnik and Croatian Dominican, was engaged in an extraordinary attempt to rescue the Langs from Nazi persecution. Boskovic traveled from Dubrovnik to Vinkovci with a special permit that allowed him to relocate the Langs to Dubrovnik. Langs grandfather refused to leave, saying that he “was the president of Jews in peace and he will stay one in the war“. Both of his grandparents were killed at the Jasenovac concentration camp in Croatia during the Holocaust.\n\nDr Slobodan Lang attended his schooling in post-WWII Zagreb and thereafter studied at and graduated Medicine from the University of Zagreb. In his professional lifetime Dr. Lang was one of the world’s outstanding specialists in Social Medicine. He was a fellow professor at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Zagreb, lectured as university professor at the School of National Health “Andrija Stampar” at the Faculty of Medicine in Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and was a guest professor at the U.S. Harvard University (in 1993 the first professional collaborator at the Centre for Human Rights and public Health at Harvard) and visiting professor at School of Health in Boston U.S.A. (1985-1986). He was a member of the British Royal Society for Public Health. He was the co-author of more than 200 scientific articles and reviews as well as author and co-author of several books. He was on the Advisory Council of the Harvard Human Rights and Public Health Journal and member of editorial board for the Croatian Medical Journal and editor-in-chief of Croatian Public Health Medicine Journal.\n\nDr. Lang’s public life began while he was still attending secondary school and university in Zagreb and had successfully served the public in many high and responsible positions for more than 40 years after graduating medicine. Prof. dr. sc. Lang was a special adviser to Croatia’s first president Dr. Franjo Tudjman on humanitarian affairs between 1993 and 2000. He was a representative in the Croatian Parliament, he was an Ambassador with the Croatian foreign affairs, he was the leader of the Croatian delegation with the Inter-parliamentary union and member of European Council. During the wars in 1990’s on the former Yugoslavia territory he acted with special attention and determination in doing good for people who suffered from aggression. He placed his hard work, his reputation and above all his generous courage to the task of saving lives and helping those in greatest danger. The foundations of his actions were the spreading of knowledge, linking professionals on the ground to help and attempting to create “effective knowledge” everywhere.\n\nHaving decided to act for the good of those that suffered at any cost and in the most difficult of war circumstances Dr. Lang co-organised the so-called “Libertas” convoy to bring humanitarian aid to Dubrovnik during the ferocious 1991 siege of the city by Serb aggressor; he protected war prisoners in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1991-1995 by organizing care and protection of Bosnian refugees in their hundreds of thousands who fled Serb aggressor and came to war-torn Croatia. In late 1993 he organised and led one of the largest and boldest humanitarian aid operations in European history: the so-called “White Path” lives-saving action for Nova Bila and Silver Bosnia/Bosna Srebrena (Bosnia and Herzegovina) aimed at helping Croats (multitudes of whom had been massacred or ethnically cleansed from the area) and all other suffering peoples of Central Bosnia. He organised and carried out many other humanitarian aid actions during the war in Croatia.\n\nIn 2012, Lang criticised the statements of Croatian President Ivo Josipovic when the latter addressed the Israeli Knesset on February 2012 and apologized for the crimes committed against the Jews in Croatia during World War II. Lang accused Josipovic of left wing Antisemitism and of insulting Croats, Jews and Franjo Tuđman for not recognising the communist crimes of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia against the Croats and Jews. Lang stated: “Josipovic spoke in the Knesset without truth, justice, accountability and good for Croatia, Israel and the world. President Ivo Josipovic was supposed to deliver a speech in Israel about the two small nations who have shown that there are no small nations. Members of the Knesset should have heard about the pride of Croats from the man whom the Croatian people entrusted to speak about the truth and good, to present the Croatian experience of suffering, trials, persecutions and slander, with the aim of joint efforts for the good of our peoples and for the good of all mankind.”\n\nThere were many stations in the life of Dr. Slobodan Lang at which, because of his personal decision to make a difference in life, many human lives have been saved. The founding of the Croatian Network of Healthy Cities, the mine Old Square at Kosovo, Convoy Libertas to Dobrovnik, prisoner of war camps, convoys of love and peace, the building of Nova Bila hospital, action Save Lives After Military Operation Storm in Croatia, the return to Cazin area, founding of the Faculty of Medicine in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, advocating for the Hague prisoners, traveling exhibition Wounded Jesus, dedication to public health throughout his adult life, etc. Through all these and many more activities the power of the Good was mobilised and people who suffered terribly, who were humiliated and whose lives were at risk – were helped. Dr. Slobodan Lang made an unforgettable difference for the good of the human race. Rest in peace – great man! Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps. (Syd)\n\nI choose this story to mark the 2016 International Women’s Day – 8 March 2016.\n\nIt’s a story of courage, determination and enthusiasm to achieve in a country where the economy yields large unemployment figures that point to a bleak personal and community future, young people leaving the country in search for jobs elsewhere… Well I think Ana and Maja from the beautiful Zadar in Croatia are just fantastic!\n\nThese two brewers in Croatia have created Croatia’s first women-run co-operative brewery, aiming to produce delicious, natural beer (“Blond”/reportedly comparable to American Pale Ale however its secret ingredient makes it so much tastier) while supporting their local community – in the coastal Zadar area! And what a hit it promises to be – it’s in this area that lots beer gets drunk in summer with great music festivals and famous dance parties that attract hundreds of thousands of young people from all over the world. So can’t go wrong – right? Well almost! They just need a little more money to help set up fully so they have decided to raise Start-up funding through the well tested and tried Crowdfunding online. After perfecting their recipe and recruiting new members, the next step was to make a deal with another local brewer to create the mutual brewery itself. They launched a crowdfunding appeal, story raising the target of US$8,000 in just seven days and have extended that target to US13,000, which is making solid headway to achievement. The money will be used to buy two 1000 litre fermenters, bottles, labels and cases.\n\nThey’ve now almost reached 80% mark of their extended fundraising goal so your help is appreciated I am sure if you are so kindly inclined and I trust many are.\n\nAna Teskera and Maja Sepetavec, from Zadar on the Dalmatian coast, run BRLOG: a craft beer brewery that started off in their garages and balconies, and is expanding rapidly.\n\nTheir online crowdfunding promotion says that they chose to start the business as a cooperative because “a cooperative is a way to transform the talents of two women with brewing skills into an inclusive, organic group of people who can construct, program, book-keep, write business plans, and create..\n\nThis is how we want to change the world. Individually we are little, working together in cohesion, we are a force of varied and crafty skills. If a group of people from Zadar can do it, the world can too.”\n\nZadar, like all Croatian coast, thrives through summer months but as the weather cools and tourists return to their home countries, Zadar needs its own enterprises to keep it vibrant and strong. And their cooperative will certainly contribute to that with new jobs and a tasty beer to boot. As well as producing the beer, Ana Teskera and Maja Sepetavec believe the BRLOG helps the town.\n\nAna and Maja consider that the cooperative will enrich the local community in the way they know best – through production. They are a beer brewery startup and a social enterprise. Indeed, community funding via crowdfunding is likely to give to that society a boost in courage and will to keep creating new jobs in other industries right there where they live, not just startup funds for one cooperative.\n\n“We are two women who brew our own beer. Not only for the taste, but for the sheer pleasure of making it,” they say. “From our brewing hobby came an idea, and from that idea – Croatia’s first co-operative craft brewery.”\n\nThe pair say working co-operatively has allowed them to be greater than the sum of their parts, and build “an organic group of people who can construct […] book-keep, write business plans, and create”.\n\nBeginning as a pair, there are now ten other members involved in the co-operative.\n\n“Individually we are little, working together in cohesion, we are a force of varied and crafts skills. If a group of people from Zadar can do it, the world can too,” reports James Sullivan of Cooperative News.\n\nThe blond ale they produce is free from preservatives, unpasteurised, and made up of four different hops and three varieties of malt.\n\nTo help tempt more backers for the project, the two women also offer a service known as ‘kegerator’ – transforming old fridges into beer taps, providing a case of their beer and installing the newly kitted-out fridge in people’s houses.\n\nThe two women say that until recent times, the process of brewing beer has been considered divinely guided, and the domain of women. Only more recently, since brewing became commercialised, did it become male-dominated. They’re aiming to redress that balance.\n\n“Craft beer is a product somebody personally stands behind, a product that can only be made when the makers show persistence, hard work, diligence, courage and friendship,” they say. “In a word: BRLOG!” Things that happen in a DEN (BRLOG in Croatian)!\n\nAnd I say congratulations young ladies and happy International Women’s Day! Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps. (Syd)\n\nLast week from March 9, Croatia closed its borders to most refugees/migrants transiting to northern Europe through Croatia in a bid to close the so-called Balkan route, which starts in Turkey via boats to Greece then up to Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Germany … used by hundreds of thousands of people seeking a new life in Europe. Many genuine refugees among them but reportedly more illegal migrants. This move by Croatia to close borders means that only those seeking asylum immediately after crossing the border into Croatia are permitted through (and there are very few of those as most want to go North to more affluent countries) as well as emergency (humanitarian) cases needing medical treatment they cannot obtain in a country they’re already in (e.g. Serbia). Slovenia closed its borders at the same time as Croatia and so has Macedonia on the Greece side. Serbia has announced it will follow the lead of other countries on the route and close its borders. Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel has last week announced Germany would send away, deport, all those found to fail the asylum test and are confirmed to be among those seeking a better life rather than necessary protection. Certainly the “sending back” moves have already caught on like “a house on fire” – tens of thousands are already being sent back to Greece not only from Germany but also from other countries on the route, having Greece rightfully worried that its tourism industry will suffer a terrible blow because of the bottlenecks being created with refugees/migrants stuck in one place.\n\nThe moves to shut down the main route used by the vast amount of refugees/illegal migrants hoping to find asylum or better economic prospects in Northern Europe came barely a day after the EU and Turkey agreed to a proposal aimed at easing the crisis.\n\nSlovenia’s and Croatia’s officials have stated during the week that foreigners meeting the requirements to enter the country, those who want to claim asylum and migrants selected on a case-by-case basis on humanitarian grounds and in accordance with the rules of the Schengen zone would be accepted through. While Croatia is not yet a member country of the passport-free Schengen Zone it’s evident that it’s application to become one involves proving worthiness at these times of this overwhelming refugee crisis and this is done via closing the borders to contribute to this domino effect occurring within the Schengen Zone and designed to stop or seriously disrupt the flow of refugees/migrants into the EU.\n\n“Apparently Europe has decided to start a new phase in resolving the refugee crisis. It was concluded that on the Schengen Zone borders the Schengen rules would be applied,” Croatian Interior Minister Vlaho Orepic told RTL commercial television 9 March 2016. “The border of Europe will be on the Macedonian-Greek border and we will respect the decisions that were made,” he said, while rejecting the notion that Croatian army should be sent to the border with Serbia as well. Minister Orepic was adamant that his police force can handle the crisis at the borders at this stage.\n\nMore than 1 million people have crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece since the start of 2015, many from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, and most aiming to reach wealthy Germany and Scandinavia, causing deep divisions among EU members about how to deal with Europe’s worst migration crisis since World War II. More than 650,000 have transited across Croatia since mid-September 2015 and as the weather warms up the fears rise that the influx of refugees and illegal migrants may become so overwhelmingly huge that it will seriously and fundamentally threaten the lifestyle and security of Europe’s citizens.\n\nThe bottleneck currently ballooning in Greece at the border with Macedonia, in particular, of some 40,000 stuck at the Greek-Macedonian border, is already showing serious signs of unrest and low-level violence that could easily escalate. A transit camp at the border in Greece, for instance, designed to hold 2,000 people, Indomeni tent camp, is now busting with some 14,000 lying in mud and battling for a piece of bread. Macedonia said it would only grant entry to the number of refugees that will be allowed to transit through neighboring Serbia and further into Europe, hence only a few dozens have been trickling across from Greece to Macedonia per day during the past few days.\n\nAt talks in Brussels on Monday 7 March, the EU agreed in principle to a Turkish proposal to take back all illegal refugees landing on the Greek islands and the price negotiated, or payment to Turkey is running into billions of euros. Newly arrived refugees in Greece in their thousands continue to head to Macedonia despite being confronted by a closed border and rain-soaked camps where conditions are squalid, human misery and unrest get larger by the hour.\n\nThe actions being taken by Brussels (EU) suggest that it’s only, or mainly, concerned with the interests of its military circles particularly the Schengen Zone, not people, in desperate bids to save itself within the demographic and freedom of movement parameters it set itself decades ago and Croatia is most desirous of being counted in. Because of this, and Brussels’ inability to reach consensus between EU member countries with regards to sharing the burden of refugees from the Middle East etc., many have in recent months/year predicted the collapse of European Union as inevitable. Some say that it’s only a matter of time when the collapse will happen\n\nCui bono? To whose advantage?\n\nNicholas Bonnal of the French Boulevard Voltaire publication says that “the Austrian newspaper Info-Direkt shows that, according to a source of Viennese intelligence, smugglers of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to settle in Europe could be paid by the Americans…” Suggestions are afoot in this article that creating and organising chaos, such as the one occurring with the unsustainable influx of migrants and refugees into Europe, is a perfect example of political terrain for ruling by chaos. Only a handful of politicians would then rise above and rule and they are the ones with the knowhow in applying the principles of Neo-Machiavellianism.\n\nWhatever the realistically based theories and/or political conspiracy theories regarding the European refugee/migrant crisis exist one thing remains blatantly obvious: people are suffering. And it’s not just one side that’s suffering. People are suffering on both sides: those fleeing into Europe (the refugees/migrants) and the European people who largely fret that their standard of living will violently be reduced to unwanted levels as hundreds of thousands of people needing sustenance and care from the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan…approach.\n\nEuropean Union is truly stuck between a rock and a hard place – the natural instinct is to assist and help the needy and the political responsibility of those in power is to protect the lifestyle of those who elected them into power! The two cannot be reconciled without a major shift in attempts to address and solve this seemingly chaos feeding impasse.\n\nBrussels has the capacity to address the crisis to an end that would not mean the collapse of the EU and certainly the latest move to close borders (reportedly criticised by Germany’s Angela Merkel who has otherwise been unsuccessful in the past months to convince EU states to share the refugee load) and negotiate with Turkey to take back the illegal migrants and to keep refugees there as much as possible for a rather hefty payment of billions of euros seems to suggest that the EU is beginning to exert some strong directional force with view to “saving” the EU from crumbling under the pressure. The challenge posed by the refugees and migrants to the EU could, therefore, serve as a positive impetus for Europe to catch up on some long-neglected internal homework like bolstering controls on its external borders, deepening political integration between its member states/kicking off with a greater political unity of sorts, and taking serious moves toward common foreign and security policies. If voters (the people of EU) see these moves as successfully handled then those steps could breathe new life into the European Union idea, strengthen it to the point of prolonging its stable existence as a true union and even spur growth; and true, refugees capable of working could positively contribute particularly in a widened entrepreneurial sense.

(Syd)\n\nCharles, The Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, landed Monday 14 March in Croatia’s capital, Zagreb, for a two-day stay before proceeding to Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo.\n\nThe British royals are expected to promote peace and reconciliation in the region where some 100,000 people died during the 1990’s war and over a million were displaced. There have been fears Balkan tensions could be fueled by the ongoing migrant and refugee crisis.\n\nThe region has seen a huge influx of refugees from Syria, now mainly confined to the borders, but the royal visit will not see Charles meeting those fleeing war, as he has done on recent trips to Jordan.\n\nThe Duchess will carry out a number of events highlighting the work of those combating sexual violence, an issue she has championed for a number of years, while the Prince will also focus on a key issue he has supported, inter-faith dialogue.\n\nThere was “incredible” excitement in Croatia over the visit, even more excitement than what a visit from the United States president – certainly for countries in this region, Ian Cliff, the British Ambassador to Croatia had commented to UK Daily Mail.\n\nHe continued: “It is a renewal of contact at this particular Royal level, between Britain and Croatia, after a gap of 20 years.”\n\nOn a political level capturing significant historical facts the revelling for the British Royal’s visit to Croatia so close to the May commemoration of the Bleiburg massacres of May 1945 – is simply non-existent. Croatian people, Croatian history, would largely expect at least an acknowledgment if not an apology for the terrible, terrible deeds that occurred under the British watch at Bleiburg and around it mid- May 1945. In that time in history the British army administering that part of post-WWII Austria, instead of carrying out the promised assistance for a safe passage to refugee camps in the “West” forced the hundreds of thousands of unarmed Croatian soldiers, civilians with women and children fleeing Josip Broz Tito’s communist Yugoslavia – back to Yugoslavia and into certain death by massacres and mass murders.\n\nBut still, the moments of excitement for the Royal visit to the Croatian town of Osijek in Slavonia (the region of Croatia that suffered terrible damages and deaths during the 1990’s war of Serb aggression and managed to reintegrate the Serb occupied Croatian territory through the process of peaceful reintegration) are aplenty but they also bring mixed-feelings and slight unease. That is, Prince Charles’ great-great-grandfather Francis Duke of Teck – father to the British Queen Mary consort to King George V, mother to Edward VIII and George VI, grandmother to Queen Elizabeth II and great-grandmother to Charles, Prince of Wales – was born in Osijek (then known as Esseg), Croatia in 1837 (which then belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire) but that fact had been kept mysteriously under the covers for generations.\n\nIt was from Osijek that Francis Duke of Teck moved to London as young man in 1866 with little means and no wealth but those facts had for a long time been concealed from the world’s public until a few years ago when the English Wikipedia published them, and this part causes a certain unease with the public in Croatia as if the Royal family have not been upfront intentionally about the “immediate” family history, rather citing Vienna as Duke of Teck’s birthplace. Perhaps Vienna was more “posh” a place in the Austro-Hungarian Empire but for goodness sake – birth place is a birthplace!\n\nFrancis, Duke of Teck was a member of the German nobility House of Württemberg; he was created Duke of Teck in 1871 by King of Württemberg. Count Francis von Hohenstein was his title at birth. He was educated at the Imperial Austrian Academy of Engineers from 1849 to 1853 and joined the Imperial Austrian Army as a lieutenant in the 1st Lancers in 1854. Without succession rights to the throne, Francis was not acceptable as a husband for princesses in most of the European royal houses. He further had little income in comparison with other European princes. He thus married into a richer family, by marrying his father’s third cousin (in descent from King George II of Great Britain) Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, the younger daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and a granddaughter of George III, who was known as ‘Fat Mary’ because of her wide girth. That, together with the fact that she was (by 1866) already in her thirties meant that Mary Adelaide was also short of choices for marriage. The marriage though was by all accounts a happy one and produced three sons and one daughter – Mary, even if wealth was not always there.\n\nNot many are aware of this connection the British Royal Family has with Croatia and it’s a detail that doesn’t leave any significant mark on the earth Croats walk on, or the world for that matter, but what could be positively significant from this visit is if after seeing the devastation still visible in Croatia from the 1990’s war of Serb aggression, his visit to Serbia and Kosovo does make a positive impact upon Serbia when it comes to their acknowledgement of the aggression and wrong-doing with view to moving forward in reconciliation.\n\n(By the way, the British Royal family also has family connections in Serbia with King Aleksandar Karadjordjevic of crumbled Kingdom of Yugoslavia marrying 1922 Queen Victoria’s great-granddaughter Maria [Romanian royal family]). Furthermore, the British representatives in the European Commission and the UN were among the loud ones who imposed various arms embargoes, so Croatia couldn’t defend itself from Serb aggression in 1990’s with any decent arms build-up, and various rules and ludicrous theories about how Croatia should/could be carved up into zones to give away parts of its territory to Serbs/Serbia etc and were very active and acted against Croatian independence from communist Yugoslavia. One only needs to think back of Lord Peter Carrington, Lord David Owen, Lord Paddy Ashdown – so much devastation to Croatia’s independence and democracy plights done by these three.\n\nNo wonder the relations between the countries haven’t been too close politically for 20 years. Perhaps Prince Charles can inject some true warmth in this but I do doubt it. It would be such a treat for justice if, at least, Britain did apologise to Croatia for being instrumental in the start at Bleiburg May 1945 of terrible communist crimes against Croats. On his visit to Osijek, his great-great-grandfather’s birth city Prince Charles was reportedly very friendly and took great interest in the agricultural produce, homemade products and trades exhibition organised in his honour. How much this “fly-through” visit will impact the future by clarifying the past is anyone’s guess but I do believe much more is needed for visible positive steps in reconciliation of 1990’s war and its aftermath than this. Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps. (Syd)\n\nIn late 1980’s and early 1990’s it was the conservative, centre-right political ideology that gathered 94% of Croatia’s voters behind Croatian Democratic Union/HDZ to vote for and fight for Croatia’s secession from communist Yugoslavia and Croatia’s independence as sovereign and democratic state. Under the leadership of its first president, Franjo Tudjman, Croatia was set on a path that would see the shedding from all aspects of public life and administration of remnants of communist habits and detrimental processes. Tudjman’s speeches contained recipes for Croatia to develop and grow into a democracy including using foreign consultants from developed democracies, training Croatian leaders political and business in leading the changes that had to occur if Croatia was truly to move away from communist regime of Yugoslavia, etc. But Tudjman died just a year after the final piece of Croatia’s sovereign territory occupied by Serb aggressor was re-integrated into Croatia. Tudjman’s HDZ lost government as well a couple of months after his death, much so due to the communist lobby that had become strong with Stjepan Mesic’s leadership and public lobby. In early 2000 the League of Communists/known as Social Democrats by then won government and Stjepan Mesic became the president. Of course, any plans to shed communist Yugoslavia from Croatia’s public administration and government initiatives disappeared into the dark of night.\n\nEvery time general elections came around after that there have been high voter expectations and conservative election candidates’ promises that an incoming conservative government if elected would deal decisively in stemming out the remnants of communism that stifle progress both economic, social as fit in a well-functioning democracy. Dealing with communist crimes and putting lustration in place were among the formally and informally bandied ways of cleansing Croatia’s democratic future from past communist habits and processes and so too were legislative changes needed to accommodate progress and a vibrant, entrepreneurial, economically viable and prosperous Croatia. Ivo Sanaders’ HDZ government (December 2003 to January 2008), whose leader ended up in courts for corruption, and that of Jadranka Kosor’s (July 2009 to December 2011) made no strong moves in this direction and, indeed, they continued with the alienation of the Croatian diaspora (that amazing resource of positive support Croatia had harnessed in the 1990’s and without which Croatian independence would simply not have been achieved) started in 2000 by Stjepan Mesic and Ivica Racan’s Social Democrat/Communist League prior government. Then came the Zoran Milanovic Social democrat/Communist League led government in late 2011 to January 2016 and it, of course, was not in the business of shedding from Croatia the ideals of communist Yugoslavia it still held close to its heart. To be fair though, there were certain legislative changes that needed to be brought in during this mandate as essential part of the path to EU membership, however, even these changes of legislative nature did not change the hearts of former communists – Croatia was and is still riddled with red tape and behaviours at public administration levels that, in essence, stifle progress and democracy. Zoran Milanovic’s government coincided with communist Ivo Josipovic’s presidency, who won office after Stjepan Mesic held two mandates – so conveniently positioned to evade the necessary changes away from communist past. Centre-right aligned president of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic was inaugurated in February 2015 and she brought with her an apparent wealth of experience and democratic wisdom from having studied and worked abroad for many years. Then came the new government in Croatia in January 2016, mainly consisting of conservative centre-right HDZ but in coalition with MOST independent list with prime minister Tihomir Oreskovic as the leader alighned with no political party but, like Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic, bringing in a wealth of corporate, business and entrepreneurial knowhow picked-up through working abroad in the “real and competitive business world” of the world.\n\nThe 2016 new government was ushered in with high expectations from the public for tackling the remnants of communism that stifle democratic progress, healthy public dialogues and economic development. Lustration, condemnation of communist crimes, legislative and procedural changes to aid and ease the process of investments and economic growth, tapping into the potential and significantly positive knowledge, economic and demographic resources that lie with the diaspora are just some examples of the plethora of measures popularly thought of as necessary to carry Croatia into the originally drawn plans for democracy, freedom and prosperity. But the evidently desired progress in moving away from communist habits is not yet visible to the originally desired degree and constant suspicions as to the democratic intentions of some politicians of note keep reverberating in Croatia’s public life. As to harnessing the resources from the diaspora for the betterment of Croatia, for movement far away from communist tracks, nothing solid or reassuring is seen on the horizon: just lots of talk from politicians and leaders but little if any right action.\n\nSlobodna Dalmacija’s journalist, Tihomir Dujmovic, has recently in his article “America” addressed so eloquently and so clearly the detrimental, stifling effects of communism in Croatia.\n\n“…I have roamed across America…listened to the destinies of hundreds of displaced Croats. Hundreds of sad destinies caused by communist sadism, which forced thousands of Croats to establish their homes far away from their beloved country,” writes Dujmovic and continues: “As far as possible away from Tito’s terror! …When I watch our people in America, when I compare them in their past years to us and when I watch our former poor that have regularly achieved a decent life living abroad, a person cannot but curse communism … It is here (in America) that we can truly see what Tito had done to us, it’s here that you can see in what misery and poverty our parents lived at home (in Croatia) and we with them, it’s from here that you can truly see the level to which the (communist) system had destroyed us…In that sense, today as a state we are really not doing anything else except correcting the mistakes that communism brought us.\n\nIn the first instance, the communist mentality that is not being extinguished…for example look the Cadastre registries…they (communists) took your land, invented the Cadastre and entered their names into the land register! We have not to this day solved this question. And there is a whole sea of similar topics.\n\nWhen you listen to our people living abroad and when you listen to their counterparts in Croatia the first thing you see is a mound of zombies in the homeland whose every business enterprise has been nailed down with a hammer. In Cleveland I met Ivan Katic who has been living there for 40 years, he started without a single dollar in his pocket and without high diplomas, but his business spirit is such that he now employs a hundred people and his annual business turnover is $30 million. Look at him and his business sense that was developed by America, the standard America permitted, and then look at his counterpart in Slavonia, from where he went to America, and you will see what communism has done to this nation. If you were not a part of the communist elite, in order to live like a man, in order to be permitted to earn money, in order to develop your own business sense, in order for your children to be educated outside the communist ideology, you had to go thousands of miles away from that hellish fire.\n\nSo, what have our people found in America? Nothing except the opportunity Tito had not given to them. The opportunity to work and earn well, an opportunity to develop without needing to sell their soul to the Party! I watch them and I watch my parent’s generation and I can grab with my hands that crime that was perpetrated here (in Croatia). Because communism took away our soul, killed all creativity, nailed to the ground all business entrepreneurship, crushed the national conscience and destroyed the work culture, which our grandparents fundamentally had.\n\nSo, while Tito’s satraps masochistically taunted us, America and the West offered their hand to the Croats who knocked on their door, offered their hand to their creativity, rewarded and encouraged their entrepreneurship and let them attend church and hold the Croatian flag with pride, without being followed by secret police…That’s why I hold communism and Yugoslavia in contempt because they have stolen half a century from us. Because they murdered generations and stole their opportunity to live like people. Thousands of Croats would not have moved from their villages were they permitted to live like people, thousands upon thousands of Croats would not have left the land had there not been talk of impending liquidations of biblical proportions during the first days of revenge in 1945…They decided how much land you will cultivate, they decided how many square meters you will live in, they decided what you may sing and when you could revel. With what right? With the right of a pointed gun to the head! With head jerking towards Huda pit (mass grave of mass murders/communist crimes), in which you will end up if you don’t stop saying what you think. There’s still a sea of emotions towards the homeland within the Croatian diaspora, a sea of good will to return and, once again, it is the homeland’s move. This is the time of crossroads and truly the last chance for the homeland to offer it hand towards the emigrated Croatia that has been waiting for too long for that hand.”\n\nWhile Dujmovic may have omitted to address the contribution Croatian diaspora could make to a better and more prosperous Croatia without necessarily returning to Croatia to live, the clear message remains: the governments of Croatia have done nothing much since the death of Franjo Tudjman (1999) to truly make the diaspora a continuing active, equal and vibrant part of the imagined prosperous Croatia. Not counting those individuals living in the diaspora continuing to contribute to the betterment of Croatia the lack of large-scale involvement from within Croatia towards diaspora is alarming and detrimental to Croatia in every way. Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps. (Syd)\n\nCroatia’s former president, that politically communist leprosy, Stjepan Mesic is finally it seems getting some just deserts. Slowly but surely his public presence of political authority seems finally destined to die a death of starvation. Disappear. His communist colleagues in power had some years ago secured that he has and maintaines the office of former president for life!\n\nSo, for this year’s budget Mesic’s office was to be provided 777,000 kuna/similar amount every year. That is almost 12 years average salaries in the country where most ordinary worker earn much less and pensioners even less. After the release of the draft budget last week, Bridge coalition headed by Bozo Petrov (deputy-rime Minister) announced an amendment to the effect that it would reduce the amount provided to Mesic’s office by 600,000 and redirect that money to the needs of civilian invalids of the Homeland War.\n\nAnd, indeed, on Monday 21 March new Croatian government budget containing the above amendment for cutting the funds to the former president’s office was passed in parliament with a majority of votes. Most Social Democrat/communist opposition voted against without a hope of succeeding. Mesic is on his way out of public life as propped by taxpayer money.\n\nWhat a great gesture! Hoorah!\n\nOne more communist vein funded by the government – down!\n\nSuch a hefty cut to government finance practically means that the running of Mesic’s office as former President is severely disabled and incapacitated.\n\nCelebrating this denial or withdrawal of funds for Stjepan Mesic’s office of Former President has roots in many underhanded, rotten and treasonous activities pinned to him. His arrival in 2000 as president of Croatia after Franjo Tudjman’s death marked the end of unity among the Homeland War veterans, unity with diaspora, end of free expressions of patriotism and national identity… Mesic had resumed with moves to criminalise Croatia’s Homeland War and throw mud and lies against Franjo Tudjman and other leaders who fought for secession from communism. Mesic continued to be an embarrassment. He sent dozens upon dozens of Homeland War generals into forced retirement – the process of destruction of the Croatian military-defense structure had commenced. He opened classified presidential archives after Tudjman’s death to British journalists and secret services, on purpose omitted parts of archives that would indicate any proper procedures undertaken in war by the Croatian defense forces and leaders, went to the Hague International Crimes Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia to give secret testimony against Croatia (which thus sadly went unchallenged by the Croatian professionals, officials or people in many parts); he sowed fear with his lies and innuendoes of crimes among the veteran population to the point when veterans were no longer certain of their freedom or existence. He, Mesic, knew how to divide and conquer – hence ten years at the helm as president.\n\nHis evil aim was to detudjmanise Croatia, kill every idea of the defensive Homeland War and proceed with the destruction of independent and democratic Croatia envisioned by Franjo Tudjman and supported by majority.\n\n” It’s a futile attempt to fight against my beliefs, primarily against the firm commitment to anti-fascism, by practically abolishing my office,” Mesic said last week when the amendment to cut the government funding for his Office of Former President was announced. “For neither the parliament nor the government can abolish me. While I live, I will consider it our duty to work for the benefit of the country, which I had the honor of serving as president for ten years,” Mesic stressed that his office will not close! Why would taxpayer money go on funding him and his office when its work is against Croatian independence and democracy for which thousands lost their lives and glorifies communist (which he calls antifascist but has nothing to do with antifascism)!\n\nMesic’s reaction to the passing of the budget in parliament on Monday 21 March was: “It should be clear to everyone that the office of former president is not in question here … I am in question. That is a reckoning with me. I have never spent any big millions nor will taking away my right to use the Office save millions. My office costs around 800,000 kuna per year. Whatever these people do, whether it is the HDZ leadership, which undoubtedly stands behind this, or ‘protruding players’ like Bridge coalition and Party of Rights, they will not shut me up.”\n\nThe whole point of lustration, getting rid of highly positioned people in communist Yugoslavia from high positions in democratic Croatia, is a key element in succeeding with democracy and economic progress. Stepan Mesic may be adamant to keep on doing what he is doing outside of the state funded office but that is an entirely different kettle of fish. The international players or leaders will know he is not supported by the government and will hopefully cease wanting to deal with him on political and business issues important to state.\n\nSo, this is one of the best news I have heard for months coming out of Croatia. Finally Croatia’s leadership has stepped up to the mark and publicly declared, where it counts – in the public purse of taxpayer money – that it will no longer pay for Mesic’s work as it serves no positive value for Croatia’s democracy and economic progress etc. This step has the hallmarks of lustration even though the Office of Former President is not in the strict sense an office of public service. Those hallmarks are in the shedding of communist damaging effects from where it counts in Croatia as Stjepan Mesic together with a well state-funded office did leave domestic and international impressions of power closely tied to governmental power.\n\nPrime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic thanked members of Parliament and his team of ministers for passing the budget on Monday. He expressed trust in the new budget and hopes it will be a solid foundation upon which to build a solid future for Croatia.\n\nGood for you – Croatia! Get rid from public influence of that political rot and communist current like the former president Stjepan Mesic. Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps. (Syd)\n\nFor me, Easter means the time of the greatest of joys, the time of new life and new hopes, the time of (nature) awakening, possibly new decisions, positive thinking and beautiful traditions that confirm where I come from and who I am. It is like that for most people in Croatia; an opportunity to gather the family and remember that love keeps us together. It is like that in every country celebrating Christianity and every country has its own special “little” things of culture and tradition that make is distinct.\n\nOne of the things that mark Croatian Easter tradition is definitely home made dyed eggs. In Croatia, they are called pisanice (literally translated into English: written upon). This Slavic egg decorating custom dates back to pagan times. Almost every home has their own home-dyed eggs and when visiting your friend’s or family house during Easter time, it’s tradition to bring some of your home made dyed eggs. Then they are exchanged and brought home as a souvenir from every visit.\n\nOn Easter day, a traditional game is played in which at least two people choose eggs and hold them vertically while one person lightly taps the end of the other egg with their end, to see whose will crack. Anyone whose egg cracks must choose another and then tap the other person’s egg, and they continue until all the eggs have been used and cracked but the last one. Whoever holds the strongest egg in the end, which has not been cracked, wins.\n\nEggs are a symbol of spring awakening and new beginnings, new life. The most popular “old-fashioned” way to dye eggs is to boil a pot of water together with a lot of red onion skins, which will give the eggs orange/red colour. The next step is to take each egg and put a clover or parsley leaf on its surface. Here’s where it gets interesting: you secure the leaf not by gluing it to the egg, but by putting everything into nylon tights. You put everything into a pot of boiling water with onion skins and cook. The tights not only secure leaves, but also let the water colour the eggs. Or, if you want striations on eggs then wrap onion skins around the raw egg held by elastic band or kitchen twine before dropping the room-temperature raw egg into boiling water. When they’re done, let them cool, remove the tights and leaves and you’ll get a red egg with leaf print on it; or striations if you boiled them with onion skins tied to them. It’s quite decorative and the process is fun. Another traditional way of decorating Easter eggs is to use hot liquid wax and pencil-like instruments. You need to make sure that eggs are clean and dry. You take wax and melt it, dip your pen into the melted wax and draw different patterns on eggshells. Then you cook them in coloured water- the wax will melt and leave beautiful designs, while the rest of eggs will be coloured. In the end, polish it with some vegetable oil, the colour will be nice and shiny.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are those absolutely beautiful Croatian giant Easter eggs that adorn city squares in Croatia and museums throughout Europe – these works of art are always the product of groups of Croatian naïve artists and usually depict cultural, environmental and religious parts of local life.\n\nOne of the joyous Easter traditions (especially for children) is egg hunt on the Easter morning. Parents tell the children a rabbit tale: the story of the Easter rabbit who leaves eggs in the garden and chocolates for children. Every Easter morning, they search for eggs and chocolate presents, all excited.\n\nAs far as the food is concerned, traditionally ham and eggs are eaten, with radishes, spring onions and horseradish sauce. The day before Easter, Roman Christians go to a late night mass carrying a basket of traditional food (bread, ham, eggs). During the mass, priests bless the food, which are kept for the next morning to eat. An Easter Sunday would not be complete in Croatia without the special, exquisitely tasting Easter cake or Easter bread – a tasty reward after the season of Lent, penance and going without ones favourite or chosen treats as form of fasting.\n\nHappy Easter Everyone! Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps. (Syd)\n\nA couple of days ago I was alerted to an article in one of the biggest newspapers and news portals in Croatia – “Slobodna Dalmacija” – published 27 March 2016 and dealing with the ruination by “mysterious” public administration moves of a 10 million kuna (1,300.000 euro) business set up by a man born in Germany to Croatian parents, who decided to go and live in Croatia and invest into business.\n\nComing to Croatia from the diaspora to invest and thus contribute to the betterment of Croatian economy, to contribute to a decrease in unemployment … is the stuff of “politicians’ dreams come true” in Croatia. Or so it would seem! They – the politicians – have been talking about this kind of stuff for twenty years! They have been inviting and calling the diaspora Croats to come and invest in Croatia incessantly. No matter which political camp (centre-right or centre-left) was in government, say since 1995 when armed conflict/war finished, they all have consistently failed to show and demonstrate clearly which parts of the Croatian (read: former communist) business and investment culture has fully changed to accommodate such a return of Croats-with-money from abroad – or any investment for that matter. Mistrust in Croatia’s red tape continued and continues even if there have been ample cases where such barriers were not an obstacle to successful investments.\n\nThe case of Kristijan Begic from Germany seems to justify that mistrust and powers that be in Croatia must set about correcting such wrongs. Kristijan Begic and his wife Zorana had reportedly purchased land from the Sibenik council to build a factory for the manufacture of Harley-Davidson motorbike parts. Initial difficulties with building the factory due to the council’s failure to subdivide the land prior to selling it (!) were eventually ironed out – it took three and a half years to iron this pathetic blunder of either incompetency or carelessness out! Begic then got five years within which to build the factory on the purchased land but, pending the building of the factory, he commenced business operations away from the building site, employed staff and promptly paid the tax. Then the following year – 2015 – their accountant discovered that the company could no longer pay wages to its employees because the company was wiped off the company register and its “tax file number” (OIB/PIN) had been cancelled!\n\nDespite the fact that the company had paid its due tax and received the certificate for it, the company was wiped off the company register as if it was inactive and non-trading! Trying to find out who within the relevant public service had made such a terrible mistake was impossible – and apparently untraceable! Kristijan and Zorana are left to take the matter to court and sue an “unknown” public servant for unwarranted and unjustified deletion of their company from the register and the deletion of its tax file number, or perhaps sue themselves in order to get to the bottom of it and restore their company!\n\nThis is the stuff nightmares are made of!\n\nAn embarrassment for all politicians who keep inviting the diaspora to invest in Croatia! So I hope this government gets its act together and intervenes as, after all, the error is in public administration and not in private person.\n\nThese terrible moves were undoubtedly made under the pro-communist Social Democrat led former government but no attempts by the new government seem to have been made to restore the company in the company register, locate the nasty culprit in the public administration office who cancelled the business unlawfully and demonstrate to the public and the diaspora that sound policing and monitoring of business administration is in place.\n\nSo what does this example tell us? The main point is that the diaspora is and has been ready to help Croatia boost its economic fortunes but Croatia is not ready for this. Instead of inviting the diaspora almost ad nauseam, to return to Croatia, without making lasting changes in Croatia, Croatian politicians in power should roll up their sleeves and start changing Croatia within, truly moving away from the communist culture and habits – not just in words. Start working at earning the trust of the diaspora to put its hard earned money where Croatia needs it!\n\nIt is clear that the government or presidential advisers for the diaspora employed so far in Croatia during the past twenty years have failed miserably at assisting the homeland society and ingrained pathetic culture customer relations change. Perhaps the reasons for this lie in both the questionable qualifications of many advisers (many of whom had not “made it” in the diaspora when it comes to public administration and managing key social/cultural changes) and in the lack of political will to bring about changes at grassroots levels, i.e. attitudes and practices of those manning public office desks and benches.\n\nThe Begic case I believe bears witness to today’s much lamented and deplored gap between rhetoric and practice of democracy. This case demonstrates that there is a great deal of foot-dragging on the issue of operational democracy in Croatia for, after all, in which democracy of the world does the recipient of an error made by a public servant need to take the error to court to correct it without the capacity of having the matter corrected outside a court when all needed supporting facts to correct the “administrative” error are there (?). Perhaps the error was made with purposeful malice and jealousy – a pathetic public servant being jealous of someone’s success (?) or sabotaging investments from the diaspora (?) – wouldn’t put it past the communist culture in public administration. But even if it is the latter the victim of such and administration error should not need to take the matter to court but have the right to have it addressed with the particular public department’s complaints resolution or other similar processes.\n\nJudging by this case, complaints to a public department in Croatia seem to get the same treatment as “spitting in the wind” gets!\n\nWithout a doubt, the period between the late 1980’s and early 1990s was indeed one of the most remarkable periods in recent history of world political economy as it sentenced to death and executed the Communist rule in much of Eastern/ North and South-Eastern Europe, and steered into motion the beginning of the end of the so-called Cold War. The countries in transition from communism, including Croatia, embraced en mass the ideology of Western liberal political economic system. For some of these countries the decision to go democrat was, of course, not so much a decision made out of heart-felt conviction and commitment to democracy as it was to dance with the tune of the time for it was the only game in town that shed a light into possible betterment of ones living standard (closer to the one seen in the West) than what communism/socialism had allowed most. Besides the motive of economic prosperity “for all” to transition into democracy Croatia wanted independence and sovereignty – out of the oppressive and burdensome federation of states bound into Yugoslavia.\n\nSo, a new Constitution (first version) was written for Croatia and passed in the parliament in December 1990, with all required or a good amount of democratic values and principles within it. The speech made by president Franjo Tudjman at the time contained the main aspects of the daunting task of Croatia’s translating the democratic principles and values into practice. Of course, the war of aggression against Croatia soon followed and any orderly transitioning of public administration culture and habits dragged from Yugoslav communist era was to suffer severely for at least a decade, or until 1998 when the last piece of Serb-occupied Croatian territory was reigned back into Croatia’s sovereign borders. But after that time – there is absolutely no acceptable excuse for Croatia’s public administration to be dragging its feet so badly in getting rid of red tape and anti-customer culture rooted in almost all government owned businesses or departments since the very first days of communist rule after WWII.\n\nIt seems blatantly clear that in Croatia – on levels of government or public administration – there’s still a good deal of a kind of tabula rasa approach that existed when it emerged from communist Yugoslavia, which assumed that somehow the communist past had been swept away in the dramatic moments of 1990/91 – at the secession from communist Yugoslavia. While the laws have been changed to accommodate the Constitution for a democratic order the damaging communist culture and habits have not been addressed and dealt with at the same time.\n\nThe euphoria unleashed by the events of 1989-1990, secession from communist Yugoslavia, caused many to forget (or ignore purposefully) that ways of doing business or serving the public sustained by the communist regime are not the sort of qualities conducive to free societies, democratic political orders, or their supporting market economies. In short, communist culture and habits are obstacles to the emergence of a functioning, democratic civil society, perpetuating a dysfunctional institutional and political culture. In other words, because of the strong and un-policed communist heritage the post-Communist Croatia still functions abnormally and its economic systems, in particular, suffer serious impairments or deficits due to the maladaptive nature of the communistically institutionalised behaviour for a democratic order. The dysfunction comes from the interactions of the historical experiences, institutions, and traditions amassed during almost half a century of communist regime prior to 1990.\n\nMoving from command to market economy has not been easy and, as one would expect in such circumstances, failures are aplenty. But now, Croatia must absolutely ensure prevention of the appalling behaviour of public administration towards the diaspora (and all investors) as seen in abovementioned case Begic and the only way of doing this is to mount vigorous ongoing measures and procedures and “policing” that will ultimately reduce or eradicate the communist culture still sitting undisturbed behind government offices’ benches and desks. Otherwise inviting the diaspora to come and invest in Croatia will become the fodder of comedians and satire, irreparably damaging the relationship that still gives so much hope for a better future in Croatia.

(Syd)\n\nTravesty of justice and biased blindness to facts\n\nDespite the fact that the Serbian ultra-nationalist pusher of a land-grabbing-by-any-means Greater Serbia, Vojislav Seselj, sowed and incited hatred against Croats and Muslims (Bosniaks) in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina during early 1990’s, recruited Serb Chetnik, utterly cruel and barbaric, bloodthirsty militia in Croatia, that culminated in a long, brutal war of genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass murder, rape, concentration camps, pillage… the Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague pronounced him Thursday 31 March 2016 innocent of all charges. The majority of judges, Judge Lattanzi dissenting, concluded “that the objective of the creation of Greater Serbia was more of a political venture than a criminal project… that crimes had been committed by Serbian forces in the process, but that they were not inherently linked to the fulfilment of the purpose of Greater Serbia…”\n\nTwo out of three judges (Judge Jean-Claude Antonetti, Judge Mandiaye Niang) – Judge Flavia Lattanzi dissenting -dared to conclude the above knowing the facts that Seselj acted in times of Slobodan Milosevic’s Serbia that called upon ethnic cleansing and creation of ethnically pure regions of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina; knowing that it was Seselj who shouted in 1991 to Serbs picking up weapons to attack Croatia that “no Ustasha can leave Vukovar alive…” (calling all Croats Ustasha – a WWII political independence movement in Croatia); knowing that only one week before the same Tribunal (ICTY) convicted Serb Radovan Karadzic, the wartime leader of the Bosnian Serbs, to 40 years imprisonment on charges of murder, extermination and genocide (based on same Greater Serbia “political venture”)!\n\nFurthermore, the majority judgment argues that Seselj’s men might have been present in contested regions (regions of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina), not to force Bosniak Muslims and Croats out of areas claimed for a Greater Serbia, but on “humanitarian grounds”. So, his calls for murder, extermination and ethnic cleansing (acted upon by his men) were simply a means of “galvanising Serb forces”.\n\nCan you believe this travesty of justice and blindness to facts!?\n\nHis men followed his calls – murdered, raped, forcefully deported, imprisoned, humiliated, plundered…and that was “OK” according to the two judges because it was a political venture! It was “galvanizing” the political venture!\n\nThe “political venture” ICTY Trial Chamber shamefully endorses\n\nAs a reminder, the indictment against Seselj included “the participation in a joint criminal enterprise (JCE). The aim of the JCE was for the permanent forcible removal of a majority of the Croat, Muslim and other non-Serb civilian populations from parts of Croatia, BiH and from the province of Vojvodina in the Republic of Serbia. Acting alone and in concert with other members of the JCE, Šešelj is alleged to have participated in the recruitment, formation, financing, supply, support and direction of Serbian volunteers connected to the SRS and/or Serbian Chetnik Movement. He is also accused of having participated in the planning and preparation of the take-over of towns and villages in Croatia and in a number of municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and the subsequent forcible removal of the majority of the non-Serb population from those areas. In addition, he stands accused of having recruited Serbian volunteers connected to the SRS and indoctrinated them with his extreme ethnic rhetoric so that they engaged in the forcible removal of the non-Serb population in the targeted territories through the commission of crimes as specified in the indictment, with particular violence and brutality.\n\nFinally, the indictment states that, in his inflammatory speeches, he instigated Serb forces to commit crimes, encouraged the creation of a homogeneous “Greater Serbia” by violence, and thereby participated in war propaganda and incitement of hatred towards non-Serb people…”\n\nThe crimes he was indicted for, he incited and called for, did actually occur and include:\n\n• the deportation or forcible transfer of tens of thousands of Croat, Muslim and other non-Serb civilians from large areas in BiH, Croatia and Serbia (Croats living in Serbia/Vojvodina region in particular and Muslims in Kosovo region;\n\n• the murder of many Croat, Muslim and other non-Serb civilians, including women and elderly persons, as well as the deliberate destruction of homes, other public and private property, cultural institutions, historic monuments and sacred sites of the Croat, Muslim and other non-Serb civilian populations in the municipality of Vukovar in Croatia, and in the municipalities of Zvornik, “Greater Sarajevo”, Mostar and Nevesinje in BiH;\n\n• the torture, beating, robbery, sexual assaults, and perpetuation of inhumane living conditions against Croat, Muslim and other non-Serb civilians by Serb soldiers during capture and in the detention facilities;\n\n• the direct and public denigration through “hate speech” of the Croat, Muslim aand other non-Serb populations in Vukovar Zvornik and Hrtkovci on the basis of their ethnicities\n\nWould Adolf Hitler be acquitted?\n\nThis acquittal of Seselj of all charges, not even mentioning complicity and accessory to crimes, does cause one to conclude (as a colleague blogger Vladimir Lusic did) that (using this ICTY judgment as a precedent) Adolf Hitler would be found innocent of all charges also. Hitler also delivered loud and strong political speeches, talked about the greatness of the Third Reich, decided which ethnic group should live and which should die in the name of the Third Reich, held a gun at his waist from time to time…just like Seselj! Only Seselj didn’t have the Third Reich – for him it was Greater Serbia.\n\nEvidence has it that Seselj did much more than engage in politics. His militia was widely feared as murderers, rapists and looters. In the Croatian war in 1991, Seselj said his men had used a rusty spoon to scoop out the eyes of their enemies, though he later claimed this was black humour.\n\nWhen they marched into Vukovar in 1991, intent on murdering as many Croats as they could Seselj’s militia sang: “Slobo, Slobo, send us some salad, there will be meat we will slaughter the Croats” (Slobo meaning Slobodan Milosevic). And sure enough by 18 November 1991 Vukovar was ethnically cleansed of Croats and other non-Serbs and hundreds perished in genocidal mass murders – other places in Croatia and BiH soon suffered the same destinies.\n\nAnd remember: all Croatia wanted to do was to secede from communist Yugoslavia!\n\nWide and serious worldwide ramifications for international justice\n\nIt’s not far fetched to say that the ICTY judges’ (who delivered such a judgment) reasoning will have wide and serious ramifications for the international justice. Such a judgment endorses all political “ventures” even those that incite hatred and mass murder and genocide… Will the coalition of allies dare to fight against IS in the Middle East from now on, for example?\n\nThe verdict already encourages nationalist Serbs to argue that their side did nothing wrong in the war. Jubilation in the streets of Belgrade and elsewhere has been ecstatic – the Serbs sentenced at The Hague so far for crimes against humanity, war crimes … do not seem to matter now! Serbian Republic political entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina, created on genocide for which Karadzic received 40 years imprisonment last week is now just about pronounced acceptable part of Greater Serbia! The arguments brought down by the majority judges at the ICTY in Seselj’s case will, without doubt, be matched by all political ventures throughout the world, no matter what gruesome destinies and sufferings they bring to innocent people.\n\nThe arguments have dumped the right to self-determination of every nation into the garbage bin.\n\nEven if the ICTY Prosecutor, under Serge Brammertz, may have done a very sloppy job in Seselj’s case during and before the trial, as the judges might suggest, and this sloppiness may have been purposeful, the judgment is still outrageous and shocking. Let’s hope Brammertz’s team do some serious work on identifying grounds for an appeal against this judgment and if it doesn’t then Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina governments need to find those grounds, quick smart.\n\nAs Luka Misetic, US based attorney who represented Croatian General Ante Gotovina at the ICTY, reminds us: “There is little doubt about Seselj’s role in Joint Criminal Enterprise to create Greater Serbia by means of displacement of the non-Serb civilian population. This was already confirmed by the Trial Chamber in the Martic Judgment (Milan Maric, 2007, PDF), which at paragraph 446 found: ‘The Trial Chamber therefore finds that at least Blagoje Adzic, Milan Babic, Radmilo Bogdanovic,Veljko Kadijevic, Radovan Karadzic, Slobodan Milosevic, Ratko Mladic, Vojislav Seselj, Franko ‘Frenki’ Simatovic, Jovica Stanisic, and Captain Dragan Vasiljkovic participated in the furtherance of the above-mentioned common criminal purpose.’”\n\nOne finds it difficult to accept that the two out of three judges who delivered an exonerating verdict for Seselj seemingly decided to ignore the previous findings of its own Tribunal on the matter and is getting away with it.\n\nIn the Twitter words of Eric Gordy, a London based sociologist and reportedly very knowledgeable about war crimes in the Balkans, the Seselj verdict is “a great victory for bloated, violent lunatics everywhere.” Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A. Ps. (Syd)\n\nJack Sparrow’s words (from the movie “Pirates of the Caribbean”) “Take what you can, give nothing back” seems to have the been the motto dished out equally by an enormous number of world’s leaders or distinguished persons regardless of the fact that these leaders are engaged in conflicts between each other, have wide or opposing ideological differences and place barriers against each other in the world. Seems they are no different to common villains, crooks and thieves and what truly irritates is that they, for instance, drive on the roads built with tax payments they contribute zero to, their kids attend schools tax income contribute to but their companies’ contribute zero to, etc.\n\nHow else could one look at the astonishing and shocking revelation by the German Suddeutscher Zeitung newspaper that leaked Sunday 3 April 2016 the so-called Panama Papers, containing millions of documents and data as to how some of the world’s most powerful have been hiding money in offshore accounts in order to avoid paying tax in their own countries or countries where profit from business is made or business owners reside in…\n\nPanama Papers “list” contains the names of relatives and associates of former and current heads of state and government from at least 35 countries, from Angola, to Iceland, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro, Ukraine, Spain, Syria, Israel, Saudi Arabia, China, India, Pakistan, Japan, Argentina … It was only in 2013 at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland when the British Prime Minister said: “We need to shine a spotlight on who owns what and where money is really flowing.” He promised, with fellow world leaders, to fight the “scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance”. Such behaviour was no longer acceptable, he said and now in 2016 his late father Ian Cameron is named on the list of Panama Papers, i.e. holding offshore companies to be involved in tax evasion…Cameron will argue he personally had no benefit from his father’s offshore companies but the question does remain whether it’s acceptable to have a leader of a government who stems from a family that engaged in tax evasion however legal that taxation evasion set-up might have been? The leaked Panama documents reportedly show how Ian Cameron employed dozens of people in the Bahamas to sign off on matters relating to his company Blairmore Holdings Inc., which managed tens of millions of pounds of assets. The company is based in the Bahamas but was incorporated in Panama, where it has been a longstanding client of the law firm at the centre of the controversy, Mossack Fonseca.\n\nThe world’s spotlight is now being shone on the extraordinary client base of Panamanian-based Mossack Fonseca (MF), the world’s fourth largest offshore law firm. A yearlong study by more than 370 journalists from 109 media organisations in 76 countries of a leak from MF of 11.5 million documents has shed new light on a secret world awash with cash salted away from prying eyes. Much of it, if not most, is concealed perfectly legally we are told, but under the sort of tax “efficient” arrangements mostly associated with the very rich, and by, among others, a clatter of politicians who would rather continue to pretend to their citizens that they are of modest means, says the Irish Times.\n\nIn this underworld of big money and power capitalism is mobile and morality appears tedious. In the world of global capitalism money knows no boundaries, and the wealthy make the laws. Limits and laws are only for the poor, the average and the stupid, it transpires. Refugees disturb us because they are visible. Tax Refugees do not concern us, because they are powerful enough to disappear and stay out of sight. The West, which is so proud of its values, is closing down its borders to the persecuted people in search of a better life, but readily accepts dirty money in search of a better place to invest.\n\nThe real owners of this sea of wealth unveiled via the Panama Papers, much lodged in tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, are carefully hidden behind nominees and bearer bonds. But by tracking contacts and associates, 12 national leaders have been identified so far, who through immediate family or crony circles, are involved in the beneficial ownership of offshore companies created by MF. These include Russia’s president Vladimir Putin; China’s president Zi Jinping (and eight current or former members of the party politburo); Pakistan’s prime minister Nawaz Sharif; Ukraine’s president Petro Poroshenko; and Iceland’s prime minister Sigmundur Davíd Gunnlaugsson (resigned position due to Panama Papers scandal on 5 April)…new names to emerge any day now as leaked documents are sifted through.\n\nIn some cases, drug dealers, blacklisted international sanctions breakers, fraudsters, money launderers and arms dealers, are said to also be reaping the benefits of this web of financial secrecy. They are facilitated by MF and banks that assure the public that they are neither aware of nor complicit in any illegality.\n\nAs to the three Croatia-based firms identified in the Panama Papers the Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic has stated 4 April 2016 that “we have not yet seen which companies these are, our finance ministry has offices that will investigate and check the allegations and if proven true, we will communicate that to the public.” Oreskovic commented that he was aware of the fact that money laundering was a big problem and that there are criminal elements that exist but that “it’s most important that the country has a system that monitors that.”\n\nThe Croatian Finance Minister Zdravko Maric said Monday 4 April 2016 that his Ministry “was carefully following developments regarding the Panama Papers scandal and was taking all measures and activities envisaged by the relevant laws regarding information on the possible involvement of Croatian companies or nationals in the scandal,” reported HINA Croatian news agency.\n\nIt’s important to note that offshore structures created to reduce taxes are legal in many cases and corruption in the criminal act for is not necessarily involved but there is not doubt that moral corruption is! There is no doubt that political corruption and hypocrisy is involved for how could any honest and decent political leader call for people to pay taxes and yet personally try to avoid paying it himself/herself or minimise it. The hundreds of journalists across the world working through the papers have uncovered plenty of apparent illegal activity so far, and I await with great interest the investigations in Croatia about the three companies reportedly keeping their cash stash well salted, avoiding taxers, in offshore accounts set up for them by the Mossack Fonseca. Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps. (Syd)\n\nThere is a repugnant movement by a group of “cultural workers”, so-called “the Culturals 2016”, that’s placing justice for all victims at further peril, gaining some ground in Croatia around this time of commemorating the anniversaries of the WWII murders and Holocaust at Jasenovac (late-April) and of the mass murders and exterminations that occurred at Bleiburg and Way of the Cross immediately and months after WWII (mid-May). The Culturals 2016 or this group of a hundred or so people such as artists, writers, actors…call themselves “the soul of Croatian culture” and, as such, they want Croatia’s Minister for culture, Zlatko Hasanbegovic, out!\n\nIt’s beyond my decency and common sense to accept the fact that a couple of hundred artists, actors or writers are the soul of the culture of any nation, let alone Croatia. The soul of the culture is all the people of a nation, not a couple of hundred individuals with personal artistic expressions, mostly insignificant in the overall culture corpus of a nation. So, really, the Culturals 2016 represent themselves and appear as an extended arm of still active former communists of Yugoslavia in whose interest it is to hide the truth of communist crimes.\n\nThe political, not cultural, initiative “the Culturals 2016” driveled on last week at a gathering in Zagreb they called “the contextualisation of historical revisionism” and attempted to voice a number of implications of what they call historical revisionism in the form of persistent insistence by the “governing elite” to equalize and justify claims of an existence of two totalitarianisms, the fascist and the communist, have, and that the Ustashi regime (WWII regime that fought for the independence of Croatia) can easily be hiding in this rhetoric could have serious consequences upon the general social climate.\n\nThe fact that communism was and is regarded as a totalitarian regime worldwide (apart from within the countries still ruled under communism) has no meaning nor validity for these “Culturals 2016”. But, that is not surprising, for their culture is and always was that of the communist ilk.\n\nDjurdja Knezevic, an unimpressive writer and historian, often pushing the feminist hard-line, a member of “the Culturals 2016” said at the gathering that the aim of the group was to “bring down Croatia’s minister for the culture, Zlatko Hasanbegovic…”.\n\nThe Culturals 2016 hold the attitude that the reinterpretation of events in the recent history of the region (former Yugoslavia) and their revision, especially through equalsation of the two regimes, e.g. “I am anti-fascist and anti-communist”, seem to be building a new national form that threatens the annulment of all existing ideological divisions and taking the Croatian society into an ideological monolith.\n\nSince justice for all victims defines such a future ideological monolith – it is most welcome and essential!\n\nThere is no reinterpretation of the events there is only the insistence on justice for all victims, on prosecuting and condemning communist crimes and showing up communism for what it truly was – murderous regime that murdered innocent people because of their political allegiances – just like the insistence of prosecution and condemnation of the Holocaust crimes had done for Nazi/Fascist WWII crimes.\n\nWhen coupled with the recent announcement by representatives of the Jewish Councils and Serbian National Council in Croatia that they will not attend the commemoration of the victims of the Holocaust at Jasenovac, and their anti-prosecution-of communist-crimes pal from Israel’s office of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, Efraim Zuroff, who keep banging on with lies about a supposed emergence of Ustashi (read pro-Nazi) regime in Croatia in order to stifle efforts for justice of victims of communist crimes, we see clearly that justice for the victims is not on the minds of these “do-gooders” of the communist ilk. They are bringing politics into what should be an event of regret, sorrow, and piety for victims of crimes regardless of who had committed the crimes.\n\nCroatia’s minister for culture, Zlatko Hasanbegovic, against whom the malicious and baseless accusations of “historical revisionism, relativisation of the Ustashi regime and negation of the Holocaust” are being made delivered replies or comments at a launch of a book purporting to contain the truth of WWII Jasenovac camp as follows: “We need to approach this subject seriously and without political provocation… we need to address not just this topic but many other contentious topics, a kind of historiographical adjudication without any illusion that any one of us has the monopoly on the final truth.”\n\nThe First Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia Tomislav Karamarko said that “the victims of totalitarian regimes do not deserve boycott,” and called for unity across Croatia. On his Facebook page he wrote: “I call upon all those who have announced their boycott of the Jasenovac commemoration to reconsider their decision and that the respect towards the victims and a repeated condemnation of the totalitarian regime become more important to them than cheap daily politicisation whose effects, at any rate, don’t last more than two or three days…”. A most impressive statement that pours confidence in the pursuit of that final truth Croatia must underline and confront when it comes to its WWII and post-WWII periods of history.\n\nWhile the communists of Yugoslavia with their allies in the West had usurped and held on to the monopoly of what they called “the truth” of WWII and post-WWII Croatia (Yugoslavia) the final truth mentioned by Croatia’s minister Hasanbegovic accepts no master but the real truth – the one we have yet to stand before. Participating Communists in communist crimes and their descendants have a great deal to lose, particularly if serious research (prohibited under communist Yugoslavia regime) into claims that the communist Partisans murdered more people at Jasenovac than what the pro-Nazi Ustashi did, confirms these claims. Hence, one can understand the vicious energy of hate, falsehoods, jitters and panic emanating from this pro-communist camp in Croatia – but one cannot, must not, accept it nor let it win. The final truth takes no sides only its own! Bless you – Minister Hasanbegovic! Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps. (Syd)\n\nApril 2016 marks the month of the 20th anniversary of Australia’s worst massacre by a single gunman (at Port Arthur, Tasmania) – and the 20th anniversary when the son of Croatian immigrants in Australia, Walter Mikac, became widely known, a household name and the national symbol of the Port Arthur Massacre. Walter Mikac lost his wife and two daughters on that 28th day of April 1996 at Port Arthur when a deranged gunman (whose name I will not mention here out of respect for the victims and their loved ones) went on a killing spree armed with semi-automatic assault rifles and killed 35 people and wounded 18. Out of that tragedy, out of Walter Mikac’s profound grief arose giant and brilliant legacies of tight gun ownership control laws, of love and remembering through a charitable foundation he set up that has so far helped more than 1.5 million children who are victims to violence worldwide.\n\nWalter Mikac , born in 1962 Melbourne, the son of Croatian immigrants, married nursing sister, Nanette ‘Netty’ Patricia Mikac (nee Moulton, born 1960 Shepparton, Victoria) in 1985 in Melbourne. After Alannah ‘Lani’ and Madeline ‘Maddie’ were born, the family moved in 1994 to the town of Koonya, near Nubeena in Tasmania, where Walter became the local pharmacist and Nanette occasionally helped behind the counter. On Sunday morning 28 April1996, Nanette and her two daughters went to picnic at the picturesque Port Arthur Historical Site, only ten minutes by car from their home, while Walter went to play golf nearby. In the early afternoon, Walter and his golf friend heard gunshots from the Port Arthur site but continued playing their game, thinking that the gunfire was due to a re-enactment of some historical event.\n\n“Not long after, our family friend and local GP, Dr Pam Ireland, came and told me what had happened. She took me to the site, insisted the police let us through, and took me to see my family. For acceptance, that was very important. It meant there was no need for someone to describe or hide the details. I was able to hold each of them. The police didn’t cope with that very well, but Pam’s insistence made that happen, “ Walter said during a recent interview.\n\n“I truly believe the power of love and creation will always triumph over the power of destruction and revenge,” he said.\n\nMikac struggled hard and no matter how hard he tried he could not understand what allowed someone to kill that many people at the same time without being stopped! This terrifying puzzle led him to write a letter to the then-Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard focusing on the need to prevent such carnage in the future, highlighting the need for tough gun controls. If people didn’t have such powerful guns in their possession or easy access then such massacres would not have a chance of occurring. Prime Minister Howard phoned Mikac the next day after receiving the letter and subsequently read it to a police ministers’ meeting to get some resolution about changing Australia’s gun laws.\n\nThe resulting gun reforms were a big thing. The laws were changed across Australia and many different types of guns were banned from civilian ownership and over 640,000 weapons were bought back by the Australian Federal Government and destroyed. It became harder to apply for a licence to own a firearm and difficult to own more than one. Prior to this legislative change, prior to prior to Port Arthur massacre, there had been 11 mass killings/shootings in Australia in 10 years – since then not a single one.\n\nAround this 20th anniversary of Port Arthur massacre there have been some moves to relax Australia’s gun ownership laws somewhat. At times of terror attacks and “ingrown IS terrorist cells” and increased violence in the streets why would anyone want to change the laws that have been keeping Australians safe for the past twenty years. But, regretfully, like it or not, lunatics and those who want to make money in gun sales – do exist. Hence, Mikac is currently very active and has started a petition for Australia to keep its tight gun laws. The legacy of tight gun laws that arose form Mikac soon after the Port Arthur mass killings two decades ago – lives today. Petition link click HERE.\n\nAlannah and Madeline (Mikac) Foundation was set up in 1997, a year after the Port Arthur massacre, and with Crown Princess Mary of Denmark (an Australian, a Tasmanian) as its ambassador the charity has spread to help children victims of violence and bullying beyond the shores of Australia. This too is a legacy, which arose out of the Port Arthur massacre, and the terrible grief it caused.\n\nIn 2001 Mikac married again and has a new family but the one so tragically lost at Port Arthur twenty years ago still lives and shines in his legacies and daily existence: in tough gun laws and in the Alannah and Madeline Foundation that helps so many children who suffer violence and works at preventing bullying as well as initiating programs that prevent violence. Furthermore, Mikac has written a book “A Circle of Life: replacing hardship with love” and is a motivational speaker of note. “A Circle of Life” is a collection of reflections on love and loss that focuses on the power of love to overcome obstacles, to heal suffering and to provide hope for the future. He also published “To Have and to Hold”, telling of the loss of his family in the Port Arthur massacre in 1996.\n\nUpon setting up the petition for tough gun laws Mikac recently said there was no reason for Australians to own semi-automatic or automatic guns as legalising these weapons would only raise the risk of danger and death for more Australians. He said it was his own personal goal, as well as the Alannah and Madeline Foundation’s, to ensure no one else experienced the trauma that he went through 20 years ago.\n\n“A significant legacy and one of the only good things to come of the 1996 Port Arthur tragedy, the day I lost my wife and children, was the establishment of the National Firearms Agreement 1996,” Mikac said.\n\nCould not agree more and trust this legacy will hold its ground, for the safety of all, for many many decades to come. Respectfully I bow in respectful memory of all those who perished at Port Arthur in April 1996. Ina Vukic, Prof. (Zgb); B.A., M.A.Ps.
