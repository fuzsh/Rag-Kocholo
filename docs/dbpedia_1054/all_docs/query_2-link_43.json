        "text": "Grounding of research. Tourism is determined as travel for recreational, leisure or business purposes. The World Tourism Organisation (WTO) defines tourists as people “travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes” (UNWTO Technical Manual, 1995).Nowadays tourism is perceived as a mass phenomenon of the contemporary life, penetrating all spheres of it, capable of changing the economic, social and cultural environment and surrounding world. Today the concept of tourism is much wider than the above presented definition. Practically it is a global aggregate of relations and unity of connections and events following the tourist in his/her travel. Research problems. Tourism acts as a social-economic development of the catalyst, so important for the development of this activity. The article also deals with the use of modern technology, the analysis of economic and social indicators.The aim...\n\nIn modern world ‘Tourism’ has become a popular global leisure activity. It can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries. People love to travel, so much so that in 2014 over 1.1 billion people crossed the world by air, land and sea. Tourism has become a booming global business and we all can benefit from it. However, the planet is fragile and it’s essential to understand that least possible harm must be done to the natural environment, valuing and protecting the local culture. Tourism allows wealth to be injected into a community in a variety of ways. The great benefit of this industry is that it’s extremely labour intensive, and many of the businesses that operate within it are only small businesses and micro operators. It’s also great for individual travelers, because with a booming tourism industry there are lots to do, plenty of places to stay, and as a result more and more tourists are drawn in. Though ‘Bangladesh is endowed with enchanting scenic beauty, mighty rivers, sun beaches, historical relics and colourful tribal life’ yet, even after 44 years of independence, tourism in this country didn’t develop as expected. Potentials are still ajar and Bangladesh can reap the benefit of world-wide development of tourism as a fast-growing industry.\n\nSome researchers perceive tourism as a process which creates dependency and causes loss of socioeconomic and environmental control, and is harmful to traditional sociocultural structures. For others it is clearly an opportunity for development and convergence among societies. The main consequences of tourism are economic, sociocultural and socio-ecological ones. These directly affect the natural and cultural landscape, as well as the inhabitants of the destinations. ‘Proper management' can unite the local community; strengthen the historical memory and promote the recognition that the landscape is a legacy worth preserving. If local people can learn to appreciate the need for regulation and careful development of cultural tourism then it is possible to have an alternative to the strategies of convenience, based upon the view of tourism only for profit. Designing tourism to serve heritage and local sustainable development not only helps to conserve the resources that make it possible, but also complies with the ethical duty to guide social perception towards awareness and respect, which in turn will lead to sustainability. The ideas offered in the papers of this book are selections from those presented at a series of conferences organised by the Wessex Institute of Technology. By means of case studies and theoretical developments, the authors attempt to present methods designed to minimise the impacts of tourism and encourage its positive effects. Some ideas in the book discuss the role of local communities, their participation in development management, the singularities of community tourism, planning, local governance and the relationship between socio-economic benefits and impacts.\n\nTourism plays a relevant role in the economy of countries, as it provides economic movement, income, revenue and is capable of promoting cultural diversity. However, nowadays, due to advances in technology and globalization, society is experiencing complex sequential transitions. These transformations have repercussions in all areas, such as economic, social, political, cultural, legal. Despite the recognition of tourism as an extremely relevant activity for all countries and their respective societies, there are many adversities to be aligned today. Problems such as safety, roads without structure, lack of infrastructure at tourist points, adequate information for tourists, lack of organization by the Government to receive tourists, among others. In this sense, the present work intends to analyze the dynamics and challenges for major tourist destinations, considering the current scenario of world society. It can be deduced that there is a lack of analysis and research that enable the implementation of policies and actions in the tourism sector, in order to make it possible to overcome the challenges and enjoy the benefits brought about by tourism. In addition, adequate investments are required so that the tourism sector is able to overcome the challenges that arise in the contemporary context, resulting from new dynamics and social demands.\n\nThe objectives of this study were to explore tourism as one of the fastest growing segments of the tourism industry, and to be more involved in their development strategies, as a means of economic diversification, employment growth and higher standards of living. The idea is that tourist destinations are essentially present as an institutional framework for tourism development design concept. Materials and methods relevant methods and techniques in the monitoring of the literature. Research findings are described in the capacity of certain features, presented in direct relation to the engagement of the identified and selected resource base for tourism development. Explored the concept and classification of tourism resources, tourism resources evaluation, internal and external factors evaluation, the concept of creating a tourist destination with the elements and types of tourist destinations, tourist destinations and development of tourism products and destinations. Contribution to research is reflected in application importance and its results can be incorporated into the official tourism development strategy.\n\nTourism is one of the fastest growing economic activities and Smokeless industry in the world. It produces Products, Services, Employment, Foreign Currency and Investments. Tourism helps to develop overall National Economies, Accelerate Development Process, Highlights and saves Cultural Heritage and acts as a Bridge in International Peace and Harmony. The present research is based on Secondary source, data has been collected from various research papers, websites, articles and authentic Journals, to explore the impacts of Tourism on J&K State i.e., Host community. The present paper focuses on the tourism of J&K and highlight its dynamic impacts on the economy, environment, service and the socio-cultural on the host community. Tourism is an industry which has enormous economic impacts. It is also an industry that has many social and cultural impacts as well. Moreover, development of Tourism within a host community often has different impact, these impacts have been discussed both in positive and negative way. The main aim of the present paper is to development the tourism industry in a host community by maximizing positive impacts and minimizing potential negative impacts."
