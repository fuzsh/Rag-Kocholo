        "text": "A study was conducted in Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam, Pakistan. M1 population of two varieties (DS- 75 and Giza-3) of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), (2n = 2x = 20) derived from four irradiation treatments (Co 60 gamma source with 10, 20, 30 and 40 kR) was critically examined for seedling emergence, days to 50 percent flowering, plants with abnormal leaves and stems, earhead length, 1000-seed weight and grain yield per plant. Genotypes varied significantly (P &lt;0.01) for all characters. Irradiation treatments were instrumental in creating significant variability for all traits except earhead length, indicating that varieties did not perform uniformly across different gamma rays treatments. However, variety x treatment effects were non-significant for earhead length as well as for 1000-seed weight, indicating stability of performance for both characters across different irradiation treatments. Mutagenic treatments shifted mean val...\n\nThe cloves of garlic (Allium sativum L.) were exposed to variable doses of gamma rays ranging from 10 to 150 Gy in order to assess their effects on plant growth, morphological variation, biochemical, and molecular traits. There was a clear correlation between gamma radiation doses and plant growth. Pigments fractions and total carbohydrate contents were also decreased with increasing γ- radiation doses. The level of Proline contents and the activity of antioxidant enzymes; CAT, POD, PPO, and SOD showed gradual increase with increasing the level of γ- radiation up to 100 Gy and thereafter decline. It is interesting to note that abundance of Alliinase gene transcripts which was gradually reduced with the increase of γ-radiation doses\n\nThe cloves of garlic (Allium sativum L.) were exposed to variable doses of gamma rays ranging from 10 to 150 Gy in order to assess their effects on plant growth, morphological variation, biochemical, and molecular traits.

The somaclones performed better with regard to vegetative and reproductive characters while axillary buds irradiated with lower dose of gamma rays (10 and 30 Gy) were more vigorous in terms of number of leaves and petiole length. Whereasaxillary buds irradiated with higher dose of gamma rays (50 and 60 Gy) showed abnormal fruit development, reduced growth, small leaf area and fruit size. A total of six variants were obtained on screening the somaclones and irradiated plantlets on the basis of phenotypic characters, fruiting characters and Single Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. The frequency of variants was higher (3.22%) in soamclones than in irradiated plants (2.75%) obtained from axillary buds. These finding would be helpful in providing a powerful technological tool for the improvement of clonally propagated crops. Bangladesh J. Bot. 51(3): 555-563, 2022 ...\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the cytogenetic consequences of exposing root tips of Allium cepa (onion) to varying distances and durations of radiation from the projector and treatment with sodium azide and distilled water using standard methods. The sodium azide and distilled water served as positive and negative controls respectively. Results obtained in this study revealed that radiations from the projector induced eleven chromosomal aberrations which included; binucleate cells, sticky chromosomes, vacuolated cells, star metaphase, bride chromosome, vagrant chromosome, faculty polarity, C-mitosis, spindle fibre disturbance, ghost cells, and fragmented chromosomes. This suggests that radiation from the projector poses danger to genetic systems. The higher mitotic index of irradiated onion root tip cells compared to negative control groups indicates that radiation from the projector exhibited a promontory effect on cell division. The findings in this study revealed tha...\n\nPlants are the main supportive human being system. Under insistently exposure to mutagens, such as low ionizing doses radiation, enhance level UV-B radiation, chemicals, heat, drought, and cold, they are enforces either to adapt either to die. Ordinarily is accepted that the living organisms under the influence of environmental stress factors, always acquire adaptive responses, but the available data still stay controversial. The effects of chronic exposure on living organisms and populations still stay insufficiently explored, and denote a much needed field of research. The aim of a review is to summarize published data for consequences of chronic ionizing radiation on plant growth and development. Epigenetic and genetic alterations were registered in plants arising under combined influence of different environmental stress conditions. Nevertheless, there are still not enough information for the combined effects of ionizing radiation, enhance level UV-B radiation, which are already registered as results from climatic changes and so expected to have important role in the future on plants populations. The increased pollution of the environment is out of the doubt, but the knowledge about mechanisms and the range of plants to adapt is still insufficient."
