This document is an edited collection of papers on the topic of minorities in the Balkans from 1804 to 2004. It includes analyses of minority policies of various Balkan states throughout this period, such as Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires. The papers examine the evolution of minority rights and national consciousness over time, as well as the relationship between states and their majority/minority populations in the context of nation-building processes in the Balkans. The collection provides historical perspectives on issues like nationalism, national identity, and interethnic relations.",
