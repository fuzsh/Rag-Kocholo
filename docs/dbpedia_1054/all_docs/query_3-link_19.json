        "text": "Just like other national markers that classify literary discourse, the term Yugoslav literature(s) functions as a prominent ideologeme of methodological nationalism. Historically, ethno-lingual markers delineated the subject area of literary history, shaped its research methods and interpretative narratives, while the discipline – mediated through education – reinforced the ideological impact of ethno-lingual denominations upon the society. Connected to the earlier and related term Illyrian, the attribute Yugoslav belongs to variegated phenomena of Slavism. In the era of modern nationalism, various kinds of Slavism emerged in the Habsburg Empire. They expressed the tendency of the subordinate Slavic peoples to create actual or imaginary alliances that relied on the ethnonationalist notion of kinship. By calling for such reciprocity, minoritarian national movements believed to strengthen their position in the Empire in which the national movements of the German and Hungarian bourgeoisie prevailed. In the Yugoslav kingdom, established after the nationalist-driven collapse of Austria-Hungary, and in the Socialist Federal Republic Yugoslavia, a winner over WWII Nazism and Fascism, the term Yugoslav literature supported integralism and unitarism. It suited the official state ideologies that attempted to master particularisms of the constitutive nations. The plural variant of the term, Yugoslav literatures, is a more recent compromise concept. Stemming from Leninist idea of the self-determination of nations, the plural term enabled to recognise and foster the existence of an interliterary community composed of individual literatures of Yugoslav nations and nationalities. Surprisingly, a preliminary survey has shown that, in its fundamental works created in the first and second Yugoslavia (from Ocvirk’s Theory of Comparative Literary History of 1936 to Kos’s 1987 Comparative History of Slovenian Literature), the Slovene comparative literature avoids discussing Yugoslav literature(s), whereas it freely uses the expressions European or world literature in singular. The reasons why Slovene comparative studies persistently neglected the closest neighbourhood of Slovene literature are manifold. They range from methodological concerns (a break with the tradition of Slavic philology and a reorientation to cultural and spiritual history) through disciplinary divisions of labour with Slavic studies to ideological underpinnings (the affiliation of Slovene literature to the Western and Central Europe and distancing from the South or East). The paper will explore why the concept of Yugoslav literature(s) figured as a blind spot of Slovenian comparativism. Why it was not studied either as the closest other of the national literature nor as its historical-political context or, at least, a typological analogy?\n\nEthno-lingual markers such as Yugoslav literature(s) delineate the subject area and method of literary history, whereas the discipline, in turn, is instrumental in the ideological grounding of collective identities. The tension between the singular and the plural notion of Yugoslav literature(s) results from the historical contradiction between the idea of national unity based on ethno-linguistic kinship and the coinciding cultural notions of the nation. The notion of Yugoslav literature(s) escapes the monolingual paradigm endemic to national literary histories. It requires a comparative perspective. However, Slovenian comparative studies largely neglected Yugoslav literatures because of methodological concerns (a 19th-century break with the tradition of Slavic philology), disciplinary divisions of labour, and ideological underpinnings (the affiliation of Slovenian literature to the West and distancing from the South-East). At the expense of emphasizing the big Other represented in the notion of Europe, comparative literature in Slovenia overlooks the small other of the nearby South Slavic area. Yugoslav literature(s) are best understood in the framework of Ďurišin’s comparatist notions of interliterariness and interliterary community. Yugoslav interliterary community arose in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries through the integration of heterogeneous cultural traditions that used to develop within historically diverse, even conflicting global areas of imperial and religious influence. Yugoslav specificity lies precisely in the internal heterogeneity of the ethnolinguistically related and mutually understandable literary cultures.\n\nThe purposefully ugly title of my paper points to two frameworks within which I propose to discuss the construction of three literary systems whose existence has, for various reasons, been contested, and which cannot be called \"national\"in any straightforward sense of the word. Bosnian (or, to be more precise, Bosnian-Herzegovinian), Yugoslav, and Post-Yugoslav literatures seem to be, at this particular point in time, to a greater or lesser degree, cultural and political orphans; and yet, some literary texts and phenomena can scarcely be understood without at least hypothesising those contexts. The two theoretical frameworks which could enable the methodological stabilisation of those contexts for the purposes of understanding the complexities of literary texts and phenomena are Svetozar Petrović\"s suggestion that \"our literatures\" can best be understood as structurally similar in their historical development to the literatures of other colonised nations (rather than to the major European national literatures, such as French or English), and Itamar Even-Zohar\"s idea of literary polysystems. Both Petrović and Even-Zohar provide us with theoretical concepts to analyse literary systems which contain marked differences between the centre (or several centres) and the margins (or even several degrees of margin), and include multilingualism as part of their corpus, all of which can be applied to all three polysystems, even though I shall mainly focus on the comparison between the Bosnian-Herzegovinian and the Yugoslav one.\n\n\"The article urges abandoning the outdated concept of a synthetic national “grand narrative” of literature and replacing it with a listing concept. The motivation for changing the literary historical paradigm derives from a) the sharp increase in the number of publications, which are no longer manageable in the traditional manner, b) public Internet access to large bibliographic and text collections and tools for manipulating them, c) the practice publishing encyclopedic literary scholarship in Wikipedia, d) cognizance of apprehension of the world as a list. The opportunity exists for a literary history composed as a mosaic or mycelia in the framework of Wikipedia’s sister pages Wikibooks, Wikisource, and Wikiversity, which motivate students’ and other interested humanists’ participation in literary studies. There are ample qualified experts. The change is fitting for the information society, which is based on distributed cooperative, networked knowledge production and the end of the exclusivity of aesthetic selection.\"\n\nThe analysis of the works of Balkan writers such as Ivo Andric, Niko Kazantzakis, and Ismail Kadare takes on a special significance in terms of assessing cultural Balkanism and its implications. The purpose of this paper is to understand if there is a common theme or shared elements in the literature and the three abovementioned writers of the Balkan countries. The review is based on the qualitative approach of the study, combining analytical method, which is used to collect data from the works of three authors from three different countries of the Balkan Peninsula to better understand the common social, cultural, and literary elements and motives of their work, followed by the comparative method, which is used to further analyze the topic and find counteracts regarding the hypothesis of the existence of the concept of Balkanism in the literature of the different countries of the Penninsula. Each of the authors has created his own reality. The redemption and construction of the ruin..."
