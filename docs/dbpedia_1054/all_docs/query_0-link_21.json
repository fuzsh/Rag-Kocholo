And in the middle of the latest Yugo¬ slav war—Europe’s worst blood bath since World War II—Serbian politicians, propa¬ gandists, and revisionist historians have made a cynical attempt at replacing the miss¬ ing piece by rewriting the Holocaust record. They claim that Serbs were not Nazi collabo¬ rators in genocide, but purely victims of the same atrocities that befell the Jews; and that Serbian aspirations for a Greater Serbia are not driven by a murderous, nationalistic ha¬ tred, but rather are propelled by a victim’s desire to lay claim to a safe homeland, a Serbian Promised Land. Thus has the cur¬ rent spilling of blood been justified. Philip J. Cohen argues that the existence of such a propaganda campaign, emanating from Belgrade, began in the earliest days of the post-World War II era and, since then, has been reflected in the world media, as well as in popular commentary and schol¬ arly analysis. More astonishing is that this campaign has been widely successful, par¬ ticularly in Israel. In attempting to not only establish but also explain the Serbian record during the Nazi occupation, Cohen takes his reader back into nineteenth-century Serbia to un¬ cover the foundation of a political and so¬ cial system that was partly built on ethnic prejudices and the glorification of violence. The rise of Serbian fascism m the 1930s was therefore inevitable—predetermined by the politics of power- and land-grabbing.

Cohen is the second in the series on East¬ ern European Studies and follows Norman Cigar’s Genocide in BosniaHerzegovina: The Policy of Ethnic Cleansing. It will be up to historians, Balkanologists, and political scientists to sort out the impact of Cohen’s study upon their disciplines. In the following pages, I intend to discuss briefly the larger, contextual significance of this study. The most important context, of course, is that the current Balkan War raged (and continues still) even as Cohen was writing this book. The now standard responses to the current Balkan War can be summa¬ rized as follows: All sides are equally guilty; the fighting is horrible, but we can’t do anything to stop it; the bloodshed is contained in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, so it has no larger meaning for those who do not live there. These rationalizations have eased Western consciences in the short-run, but will not stand up to honest scrutiny in the long run. In the first place, respected Western fact-gathering organizations have concluded that the overwhelming majority of the atrocities and one hundred percent of the genocide in the current Balkan War were committed by Serbs. Geno¬ cide is the most serious of international war crimes, and the West failed to put a stop to it. Second, and in contrast to other instances of genocide, this one in the Balkans was televised. Thus, the rationalization given for geno¬ cide in World War II, that “we didn’t know,” does not hold for the genocide in the Balkans. Thanks to the information revolution, nearly everyone in Western countries knows about this genocide. But this fact raises serious moral issues, ranging from the question, Would genocide in World War II have been stopped had people known about it? to, Why did knowledge of\n\nXIII\n\ngenocide in 1990 not lead to the appropriate moral action to put a stop to it? Third, the current Balkan War became internationalized early because of the involvement of NATO, the United Nations, Russia, much of the Is¬ lamic world, and many European Nations. It is already a “world war,” not in the sense of many countries going to war with each other but in terms of the focus, money, alliances formed (Russia, Serbia, and Greece against the West) and alliances discredited (such as NATO, the CSCE, the Euro¬ pean Community, and the UN). The evil of mostly secret genocide in World War II led to numerous scholarly efforts to understand the minds of the Nazi criminals who were responsible for it. The evil of the highly visible genocide in the Balkans in the 1990s must eventually lead to scholarly efforts to understand not only the minds of the criminals who perpetrated it, but also the minds of those who stood by, watched it, and failed to stop it. Cohen’s study is significant primarily because it is on the cutting edge of such coming anatomies. I use the word anatomy deliberately, harking back to Erich Fromm’s The Anatomy of Human Destruction, in which he examined the criminal minds of Hitler, Himmler, and Stalin. But for rea¬ sons stated above, the circumstances surrounding genocide in the Balkans have changed because of massive media coverage. In this contemporary context, Cohen’s study is a double-edged sword: In line with Hannah Arendt, Erich Fromm, and others who analyzed the “minds of the criminals” in the Nazi era, he examines outpourings from the mind of the indicted Serb war criminal. But in addition, and in contrast to previous studies in genocide, Cohen’s study probes into the reasons why Western intellectuals were generally taken in by the rationalizations for genocide offered by in¬ dicted Serbian war criminals. The rationalizations I am referring to include the following by Rado¬ van Karadzic: The Serbs were forced to commit preemptive genocide against Croats and Muslims due to fears that stem from atrocities commit¬ ted by the World War II Croatian Nazi collaborationist regime, the Ustasha, and to fears of Bosnian Muslims harking back to the Turkish victory over the Serbs in 1389. Karadzic’s right-hand man, Gen. Ratko Mladic, adds that the Serbs have been the West’s consistent allies. For example, Roger Cohen writes in the New York Times: General Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serbs, accused NATO of attacking the Serbs in a more brutal way than Hitler. . . . The reference to Hitler by General Mladic underscores the way in which the Serbs’ war-ravaged history, marked at times by stoical heroism, and their contribution to allied victories in two world wars, has been repeatedly\n\nXIV\n\nSERIES EDITOR’S STATEMENT\n\ninvoked by political and military leaders. . . . They ask why the Serbs are thus persecuted and conclude that it is all an American-led plot against them. . . . They have suffered unduly. (September 8, 1995, p. Ai) As David Riesman suggests in his foreword, Philip Cohen shows that real history in the former Yugoslavia is much more complex: The crimes of the Croatian Ustashas were terrible, but the Serbian Chetniks also collaborated with the Nazis in addition to opposing them at times during World War II. Serbia was not just occupied by the Nazis, but it actively collaborated with them. But any respectable historian and journalist should know that puppet regimes in World War II Yugoslavia, including that of Serbia, collaborated with the fascists. This should not be surprising given the larger context of fascist collaboration even by America’s allies, France and Italy. The ratio¬ nalizations and distortions offered by Serbian war criminals in the 1990s should have been challenged and debunked on scholarly grounds prior to the publication of Cohen’s book, but clearly were not. Most commentators who denounced Serbian atrocities in the 1990s nevertheless reserved sym¬ pathy for Serbian fears of Croats and Muslims that led them to commit evil—as if others would not have good grounds to fear the Serbs based upon their history. This widespread acquiescence by Western intellectuals and journalists really raises the haunting question of how post-World War II genocide is possible. Even with regard to the Holocaust, one ought never to forget that the standard cliche, “we didn’t know,” was more a rational¬ ization than a truism. Too many Germans and non-Germans had more than ample reason to suspect that the fate of the Jews as they were carted away from their residences would be none other than the fate of the men¬ tally retarded in 1935, the burning of whose corpses, as Lucy Dawidowicz points out in her War Against the Jews, could be smelled in major popula¬ tion centers in Germany from the mid-thirties onward. Similarly, one had ample reason to suspect the fate of Bosnian Muslims, whose bodies con¬ tinue to be found in massive graves, given past Serbian rhetoric and Serbian actions taken against Muslims earlier in this century. Having raised the question of why historians and other intellectuals failed in making the connections and analyses mentioned above, I leave it up to the reader to decide upon an answer. I will close with the observation that path-breaking works in all disciplines are frequently made by outsiders who are marginal to mainstream disciplines. The Nobel-Prize winner, Rene Dubos, demonstrates this convincingly in his Mirage of Health, wherein he shows that major medical and public health achievements were not made\n\nSERIES EDITOR’S STATEMENT\n\nXV\n\nby the medical profession. The celebrated American sociologist, David Riesman—who came to sociology from law—has argued that the stranger to an established discipline necessarily introjects an appreciable dose of objectivity into discussions because he or she remains free of the prejudices and paradigms that eventually stifle objectivity in any profession. Cohen’s pathbreaking study follows in the distinguished tradition established by two other physicians who made major contributions to the social scientific understanding of human evil, Erich Fromm and Robert J. Lifton. The result of Philip Cohen’s meticulous and excruciatingly well-documented study is bound to be the realization that this time, we cannot deny that we know.\n\nStjepan G. Mestrovic Series Editor\n\nXVI\n\nSERIES EDITOR’S STATEMENT\n\nPhilip Cohen has shown a remarkable ingenuity in finding source material not only in arcane sources in the former Yugoslavia but also by pursuing leads that take him into nineteenth-century British parlia¬ mentary proceedings and a Jewish Encyclopedia in the United States from before the First World War. The Nazis were meticulous in keeping records; so too, according to this volume, were many officials in what was once Serbia and the other arenas that then made up the former Yugoslavia after the Second World War. And if there is a statistic to be found as to the number of Jews living in a certain region of Serbia—or the number of Ustashas who were trained in Italy—those figures will be found in proper setting in this volume. It will be astonishing to contemporary readers to find that the term ethnic cleansing was used by militant Serb nationalists well before the cur¬ rent assaults in Croatia or Bosnia and Herzegovina. Indeed, there is not much new but much that is tragic in Serbian actions going back to the last century. This reader had already, through diligent but amateur scrutiny, con¬ cluded that the Serbs now engaged in warfare and ethnic cleansing are pri¬ marily Serbs from peasant backgrounds—-Hill or Mountain Serbs, not the cosmopolitans of Belgrade, or indeed the cosmopolitans of cosmopolitan Sarajevo.1 An understanding of this limited sensibility has been intensified and strengthened in these chapters, which further serve as a reminder that the pan-Yugoslav fascist movements had Serbian and, to a lesser extent, Slovenian roots. A minor puzzle in the book is the news that not only the Nazi Party and the German intelligence services supported the anti-Semitic\n\nand anti-capitalist movements in Serbia, but also the German industrial firms. One must ask why these companies supported National Socialism. Perhaps they realized that this movement would eliminate competitors and not be the threat indicated by the label National Socialism. What this reader finds remarkable is the expedition with which Serbian intellectuals and propagandists change their tune: first, to support the Na¬ zis while the latter held power; then, in some cases, to turn to the Partisans and become influential under the regime of Tito; and now, to claim that the Serbs were the greatest friends of the Jews in the former Yugoslavia. What is startling about this facility is also the fact that, as this volume makes fully explicit and documents, Serbian nationalism was subordinate to German National Socialism and, in much smaller measure, to Italian Fascism. One must ask: what kind of nationalism is that? It is a national¬ ism with a remarkable degree of subordination. But it also becomes clear to the reader who has even the slightest background in the area that intel¬ lectuals—it is astonishing how many officials of the Serbian and Yugoslav ministries held doctoral degrees—were able to swing the peasant popula¬ tion easily through maniacal anti-Semitism, in which the small number of Jews in Belgrade and in a few towns were given majestic power in capital¬ ism and in communism alike, as in other familiar anti-Semitisms in the Western World. Often it was only European intervention, British in many cases, that led to the lessening of anti-Semitic regulations during the peri¬ ods of Serbian independence. The author’s scrupulousness makes clear that he is not “anti-Serb” out of zealotry. He recognizes instances of Serbian public and private decency and also examples of Croatian anti-Semitism and treachery. But, as his ac¬ count makes clear, there is an important cultural difference between Serbia and Croatia: it is in Serbia that illiterates could rise to leadership and even to the monarchy—something inconceivable in better-educated Croatia and Slovenia. Moreover, the Serbian Orthodox Church authorities are in many cases the leaders of the pan-Serbian movements and, despite their educa¬ tion, or perhaps in some respects with the aid of their education, are fiercely and actively anti-Semitic. Again and again, Orthodox Church lead¬ ers take principal part in the political culture.2 There are also, not surprisingly, Serbian crimes against Muslims on behalf of what the Chetnik directive of December 20, 1941, specified as an “ethnically pure” Greater Serbia cleansed “. . . of all national minorities and non-national elements” (see chapter 2). One of the contributions of the volume is to show that the Chetniks are mistakenly portrayed as anti-fascist and even protective of the Jews. Philip Cohen describes a much more complicated set of constellations.\n\nXVIII\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThere are ever so many vignettes in this volume which will haunt the reader. One that particularly struck me was the attack on October 23, 1940, by the White Eagles of the Zbor Youth Movement at Belgrade Uni¬ versity. Revolvers were put to the necks of professors, and unarmed stu¬ dents were stabbed with knives—according to this volume, a favorite Serbian weapon—as the attackers hailed Hitler and Mussolini and screamed “Down with the Jews!” (See chapter 1). The author goes back generations in Serbian history and, indeed, in the history of the region, to trace the routes of Serbian nationalism, the epochs of anti-Semitism in the last century, and the rise to power of illiter¬ ates. In so doing, these chapters show again the hegemony of the non¬ cosmopolitan Serbs, whose very lack of education could seem to be an asset, but also makes them vulnerable to the ideologies created by Serbian intellectuals leaning a century later toward Hitler and, to a lesser degree, toward Mussolini. At this point I need hardly say that the volume will be useful to scholars specializing in the history and current politics and policies in the Balkans and in Serbia in particular. But the book will be useful to a far wider audi¬ ence, for whom it will bring scrupulously gathered material—not pre¬ viously available—which required a felicity with language and an ingenuity in what might be regarded as detective work to find. This semi¬ amateur reader had no difficulty whatever in following the text, but only a difficulty in putting it down, because it is so absorbing! I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this book in that it might affect contemporary judgments in the United States and elsewhere. The fact that the author is Jewish should not matter. But in this case it does because, for example, the government of Israel has refused to recognize Croatia, blaming it for persecuting and killing Jews, but has exempted the Serbs from blame. The author cites Jewish scholars who have been con¬ vinced by the exceptional propaganda talents of the Serbs that Serbian forces defended the Jews against the Nazis. Such beliefs are in contrast to the reality made clear in this volume: the Serbians were anti-Semitic long before there were Nazis, and the Serbs in part made use of the Nazis and in part were captivated by them because of the shared ideologies of German National Socialism and Greater Serbian expansionism.\n\nDavid Riesman Henry Ford II Professor of Social Sciences Emeritus Harvard University Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nFOREWORD\n\nXIX\n\n.\n\nAs the twentieth century draws to a close and Serbia finds itself at war for the fifth time in this century, historians have drawn attention to the haunting parallels between Serbia’s role in the Balkan Wars of 1912-13 and the events of the 1990s. To be sure, the primary strategic goals of the Serbian leadership regarding territorial expansion and the extermination of “alien populations” were present in the two Balkan Wars. The same determination among the Serbian leadership to create an ethnically homo¬ geneous Greater Serbia was also found during the two world wars. The similarities between Serbia’s record in World War II and developments in the 1990s are striking—and critical to an understanding of present-day Serbian nationalism. This study examines Serbia’s World War II record, a neglected historical issue, and delineates the historical continuity of stateorchestrated genocide and expansionist nationalism in Serbian political culture from the pre-twentieth century to the present day. To date, the internal history of Serbia in the Second World War has received only superficial treatment in English-language studies. Serbia’s role in World War II, a complex period of history, is often clouded by a mythology that casts the Serbs as synonymous with anti-Nazi resistance and the Croats and Bosnian Muslims as synonymous with pro-Nazi collab¬ oration. Such a conventional wisdom, however, is not borne out by the historical record. A central thesis of this book is that the mainstream of Serbia’s political, intellectual, and religious leadership collaborated extensively with the Axis powers, contrary to the mythology of resistance as promoted by subse¬ quent official accounts. The Serbian establishment participated actively in\n\nXXI\n\nthe Holocaust against Serbia’s Jewish community. Key societal institutions involved in the extermination of Serbia’s Jews included the Nazi-backed regime of Gen. Milan Nedic, the Serbian fascist movement Zbor, and vari¬ ous Serbian state security forces, including the Serbian State Guard, the Serbian Volunteer Corps, the Belgrade Special Police, the Serbian Gestapo, as well as the Chetnik guerrilla bands of Kosta Pecanac, and the Chetniks of Draza Mihailovic. It is well known that the nominally “Yugoslav” Chetniks, committed to the formation of Greater Serbia, operated in Slovenia, Croatia, BosniaHerzegovina, Montenegro, and Macedonia, as well as Nedic’s Serbia. It is not so well known, however, that Serbia’s collaborationist institutions— including the Serbian Gestapo, Serbian State Guard, and Ljotic’s Serbian Volunteer Corps—also operated beyond the borders of Nedic’s state with the knowledge and approval of the Axis occupying powers. At the urging of prominent Serbian intellectuals and leaders, Serbs in Serbia and Montenegro collaborated extensively with the Nazis and Italian fascists in suppressing the resistance or in conducting a mode of resistance that was passive in comparison to that in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Outside of Serbia and Montenegro, ethnic Serbs were divided between the largely Axis-collaborating Chetniks and the far more vigorous Partisan re¬ sistance. In the Croatian puppet state, there was widespread rejection of the Nazi-installed Ustasha regime among the Croats and Muslims as well as Serbs, who progressively consolidated a Partisan resistance. It was only after the withdrawal of the Germans and the overthrow of the Nedic regime by advancing Soviet forces and their Partisan allies in October, 1944, that the Serbs in Serbia began to join the Partisans in large numbers. These new Partisans included tens of thousands of former Nazi collaborators re¬ sponding to Tito’s promises of amnesty, as well as to the call of the Serbian king-in-exile—reluctantly and under British pressure—for Serbian Chet¬ niks to join Tito’s forces. With the German withdrawal in October, 1944, the war in Serbia ended six months before it would end in Croatia, BosniaHerzegovina, and Slovenia. After the war, the British forcibly repatriated tens of thousands of “Yu¬ goslavs” from Bleiburg, Austria. This led to massacres, carried out by the Communists, of many of the repatriated Croats and Slovenes, and even a number of Chetniks. The “Bleiburg” massacres of May and June, 1945, had less to do with the punishment of collaboration (most of the victims were innocent peasants) than with the institution of state terror to ensure the Communists’ postwar monopoly of power. The massacres also served another purpose for Tito’s Communist Party; for Serbian Chetniks had risen in the Partisan ranks near the war’s end, and the massacres—primar-\n\nXXII\n\nPREFACE\n\nily a Serb-driven blood-letting—helped cement Serbia’s adherence to the Communist movement, which Serbia had mostly opposed. Without Ser¬ bian adherence to the party, the reconstitution of the Yugoslav federation under Communist auspices would have been impossible. Tito made further concessions to Serbia by reestablishing Belgrade as the administrative cen¬ ter of Communist Yugoslavia. These events led to Serb numerical domination of Yugoslavia’s Communist Party and provided the window of opportunity for a substantial core of former Serbian Nazi collaborators to attain influential positions in the postwar Yugoslav government. Although some of the most prominent Ser¬ bian pro-Axis collaborators were condemned and punished after the war, Tito nevertheless allowed a significant degree of historical revisionism by Serbian apologists rather than risk antagonizing this much-needed constit¬ uency. The portrayal of wartime Serbia as primarily anti-Axis, as innocent of complicity in the Holocaust, and as a victimized nation would shape significantly its postwar affairs. Particularly in the years following Tito’s death in 1980, the reinvention of Serbia’s role in World War II became a crucial factor in its efforts to win foreign sympathy and support for a re¬ vived nationalist agenda. As a consequence of having reinvented its past ethnic policies, the way was cleared for Serbia once again to commit genocide. Since 1991, Serbia, first covertly and later openly, has conducted a systematic campaign to destroy non-Serbian culture in the region. Ethnic- and religious-based expulsions and the mass murder of civilians throughout the territories coveted by Serbia have taken place—most notably in Croatia and BosniaHerzegovina but also in the Albanian-populated province of Kosovo, in the predominantly Muslim-inhabited region of Sandzak along the SerbianMontenegro border, and to a lesser extent in the Vojvodina province, home to a substantial population of Hungarians, Croats, and other minorities. At the same time, the Belgrade regime has mounted an intensive propa¬ ganda campaign through media and diplomatic channels to justify Serbia’s aggression against neighboring countries and non-Serbian populations, to gain political support from the international community, to undermine sympathy for Serbia’s victims, and to portray the victims as responsible for the war. A key aspect of this propaganda campaign has been the representation of Serbs as an oppressed and endangered people rising to their own de¬ fense—and sharing a moral position with the Jews of the post-Holocaust era. Thus, while Serbian opinion makers have portrayed the Serbs as the purest of victims in the Second World War—indeed, Serbs constituted ap-\n\nPREFACE\n\nXXIII\n\nproximately half of all Yugoslav war losses—they simultaneously have concealed the genocide carried out by various Serbian parties against vari¬ ous ethnic communities. And they have failed by design to give an honest accounting of Serbia’s own responsibility for the Holocaust. Most Serbian historians have neglected the extensive documentation recording Serbia’s collaboration with the Nazi regime, perhaps for fear of shattering conventional views which have become ingrained in official and popular Serbian historiography. This work examines an important part of the historical record and challenges more than half a century of Serbian historical revisionism. I am indebted to those individuals who assisted in collecting documenta¬ tion, reviewing the manuscript, providing helpful discussion and criticism, and offering professional skills in translation and research. I am also grate¬ ful for the library skills of Ivan Miletic, the translations of Anto Knezevich and Branimir Anzulovic, and the editorial skills of Katherine J. Rosich and Alan F. D. Potter. Henry L. de Zeng IV conducted critical research on miliV\n\ntary history, and Ljubica Stefan provided me with essential documentation on the Holocaust period in Serbia. The Cartographic Service Unit of the Department of Geography at Texas A&M University provided the maps.

Standard Croatian is written in the Latin alphabet with special diacritical marks. Standard Serbian is written in Cyrillic (somewhat different from the Russian Cyrillic alphabet) but transliterates easily into Latin letters. Those consonants for which the pronunciation differs from English usage are shown in the table. For Croatian and Serbian words, proper spellings, rather than English transliterations, are used. Exceptions are “Ustasha” and “Chetnik” for V\n\nwhich the common English spellings are used, rather than Ustasa and Cetnik. Accordingly, the plurals of Ustasha and Chetnik are obtained by the English convention of adding a final “s,” rather than the grammatically correct Ustase and Cetnici. For geographical names, familiar English designations are used when¬ ever possible. Thus, Croatia is preferred to Hrvatska, and Belgrade to Beo¬ grad. Where familiar English designations do not exist, place names follow local usage, so that the Macedonian capital is called Skopje, rather than its Croatian or Serbian version, Skoplje. In direct quotations, the original spellings are preserved. For example, Servia, rather than Serbia, appeared in English-language texts until the early twentieth century. c\n\n=\n\nts, as in “tsar”\n\nc\n\n—\n\nch (soft), as the “t” in “future”\n\nc\n\n=\n\nch (hard), as the “tch” in “watch”\n\ndj\n\n=\n\n/ (soft), as the “g” in “fungicide”\n\nXXV\n\nd\n\n=\n\nj (soft), as the “g” in “fungicide”\n\ndz\n\n=\n\nj (hard), as the “j” in “jar”\n\nh\n\n=\n\nmore guttural than English and always pronounced\n\nXXVI\n\nj\n\n=\n\ny, as in “yes”\n\nlj\n\n=\n\nas the “li” in “medallion”\n\nnj\n\n=\n\nas the “ny” in “canyon”\n\nr\n\n=\n\nlightly rolled\n\ns\n\n=\n\nsh, as in “she”\n\nz\n\n=\n\nzb, as in “Zhivago”\n\nPRONUNCIATON GUIDE\n\nSerbia's Secret war\n\nThe Plan for Greater Serbia The idea of an ethnically homogeneous Greater Serbia, deeply rooted in Serbian political culture, was first codified in 1844 by Ilija Gara¬ sanin, then an influential minister in the Principality of Serbia under the crown of Prince Aleksandar Karadordevic.1 Garasanin s internal memoran¬ dum titled “Nacertanije” (The Outline)—a blueprint for the creation of Greater Serbia through the conquest of lands inhabited by Bulgarians, Macedonians, Albanians, Montenegrins, Bosnians, Hungarians, and Croats —was kept secret until 1906.2 In the introduction, Garasanin asserts that “a plan must be constructed which does not limit Serbia to her present borders, but endeavors to absorb all the Serbian peoples around her. J Else¬ where in the document, Garasanin, in regarding Croats and Slavic Muslims as Serbs of the Catholic and Islamic faiths, describes various strategies for the bloodless conquest of neighboring populations: Special attention must be paid to the problem of diverting the peoples of the Roman Catholic faith [Croats] from Austrian influence, and evoking a sympathy for Serbia. Through the Franciscans there, this goal would be best achieved. The Franciscans must be won over to the idea of the union of Bosnia and Serbia. To this end, several prayer books and hymnals should be printed in Belgrade, as well as prayer books for Orthodox Christians [Serbs] and anthologies of national songs which would be in the Fatin alphabet on one side and Cyrillic on the other. As a third step, it would be advisable to print a short and general history of Bosnia, in which the names of some Bosnians who converted to the\n\n3\n\nMohammedan faith [Slavic Muslims] and their renowned deeds would be included. . . . Through the printing of these and similar patriotic works. . . . Bosnia will be liberated from the influence of Austria and incline more to Serbia. Croatia and Dalmatia, in this way, would pro¬ cure books which would be impossible to print in Austria. The natural result would be a merger of these lands in a closer relationship with Bosnia and Serbia.4 Notably, Garasanin’s program for the expansion of Serbia called for the extension of Serbian domination to regions in which Serbs, if present at all, constituted a minority of the population. Although “The Outline” implied merely the political assimilation of the various non-Serbian peoples living within the envisioned Greater Serbia, by regarding these non-Serbian populations as really Serbian, it set the stage for treating them as traitors to the nation in the event that their politi¬ cal allegiance and cultural conformation were not voluntarily forthcoming. In 1902, Nikola Stojanovic (1880-1965), a lawyer, politician, and newspa¬ per publisher, also commented on Croatian assimilation in a piece titled “Do istrage vase ili nase” (Until Your or Our Extermination): The Croats . . . are not and cannot be a separate nation, but they are on their way to becoming—Serbs. By taking Serbian as their literary language, they have taken the most important step towards unification. Also, the process of merging continues apart from the language. By reading every single Serbian book, any folk song, by singing any Serbian song, an atom of fresh Serbian democratic culture is passing into their organism. . . . This struggle must be fought until extermination, yours or ours. One party must succumb.5 After first appearing in Belgrade, the same piece was published in the Cro¬ atian capital of Zagreb, causing violent demonstrations.6 Hardly an ab¬ erration, however, Stojanovic’s refusal to recognize a Croatian identity independent of the Serbs was echoed in Serbian elementary and secondary school textbooks of the period, which rarely mentioned the existence of Croats at all. When mentioned, Croats were designated as Serbs of the Catholic faith.7 In 1937, an official memorandum titled “Iseljavanje Arnauta” (The Expulsion of the Albanians) emerged from the mainstream Serbian politiV\n\ncal establishment. It was written by Vasa Cubrilovic, a political adviser to the royal Yugoslav government and conspirator in the 1914 assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the event which helped\n\n4\n\nSerbia’s secret war\n\nspark the First World War. “The Expulsion of the Albanians” argued that Hitler’s and Stalin’s success in expelling Jews and others presaged the suc¬ cess of a plan to render the lives of Albanians so intolerable and terrorfilled that they would leave for Albania and Turkey: If Germany can evict hundreds of thousands of Jews, if Russia can transport millions of people from one part of the continent to another, a few hundred thousand evicted Albanians will not provoke a world war. The deciding bodies must know what they want in order to carry through with their plan and not worry about world opinion. . . . The only effective way is evicting Albanians from their triangle [Debar-Rogozna-Nis] en masse. To cause the massive emigration the first prerequisite is to generate fear. It can be created in many ways. It is well known that Muslim masses are generally easily susceptible to influences, especially religious, that they are gullible and even fanatical. Therefore, for the Albanians to emigrate, it is necessary, first of all, to win over their clergy and men of influence, either by money or by threats. Agitators should be found as soon as possible to promote eviction, especially if Turkey is willing to give us some of these agitators. . . . The second condition is the pressure by the state apparatus. It should make the utmost use of all legal means in order to make the Albanian existence here as bitter as possible: fines; arrests; the ruthless application of all the police sanctions; punishments for smuggling, cut¬ ting trees and letting dogs loose; forced labor; . . . Old deeds should be rejected, land registry should be stopped, but all the taxes as well as all public and private debts should be ruthlessly collected. The use of state and community pasture lands should be banned; all concessions . . . should be abolished; they should not be granted monopoly licenses and should be fired from state, private and self-employment. . . . Sanitary measures, such as the forceful implementations of regulations even in¬ side their homes, knocking down the walls and high fences around their dwellings, the rigid implementation of veterinary laws which would continually prevent the selling of cattle at the market and so forth can all be done effectively and practically. Albanians are most sensitive in religious matters. That is where we should hit hardest. It can be done by molesting their clergy, plowing their graveyards. . . . Even private initiative can have great effect. Our colonists should be given arms, if necessary. The traditional Chetnik method should be used in those areas. Chetnik actions there would need secret support. A horde of Montenegrins from the mountains should be sent down to\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n5\n\nprovoke massive clashes with the Albanians. . . . With the help of our secret forces the conflict should be prepared in advance. It should even be encouraged, which will not be difficult if the Albanian resistance is fierce. The whole case should be calmly presented as a conflict between clans and tribes and if necessary, it should be characterized in economic terms. In extreme cases, some local uprisings can be provoked which would later be put down by blood—the most effective means. This should not be done directly by the army, but rather by our colonizers, that is, Chetniks and Montenegrin tribes. There is one more method which Serbia very effectively used after 1878, the secret burning of Albanian villages and town quarters.8 V\n\nAn insight into the racist mindset that Cubrilovic represents is offered by his proposed Serbian eugenics program to improve Montenegrin genetic stock by cross-breeding with Serbs: The very first question is, who should colonize there?. . . As a means of pushing out Albanians, the Montenegrins are the most convenient because they are most similar to the [Albanians] in mentality and tem¬ perament. They [the Montenegrins] should be accompanied by Serbs from Lika [the Croatian hinterland north of Dalmatia], the krajina [the V\n\nCroatian border], [and the Serbian towns of] Cacak, Uzice, and Toplica. This should be done because the Montenegrins lack the neces¬ sary work habits and organization and in order to break their mountain community by intermixing and cross-breeding Montenegrins with the Serbian people from various parts of the Dinaric Mountains to create a new breed, less Montenegrin and more Serbian.9 Cubrilovic’s suggestion in the 1937 memorandum that the Chetniks could be organized and secretly assisted by the government to shed Al¬ banian blood while the official army maintained its distance was not with¬ out precedent. During the Balkan Wars of 1912 (against Turkey) and 1913 (against Bulgaria), when Serbia annexed Kosovo, the Sandzak, and Macedonia, the Chetniks were responsible for the worst atrocities, pri¬ marily against civilians, following in the path of the Serbian Army’s mili¬ tary campaigns.10\n\nEthnic Cleansing for Greater Serbia The concept of ridding Serbia of “Turks” (among Serbians, a pejorative term for Muslims) had been a recurrent theme in Serbian politi¬ cal culture since the nineteenth century. Even before the independence of\n\n6\n\nSERBIA’S SECRET WAR\n\nSerbia in 1878, Serbs had driven Muslims from their homes and expropri¬ ated their properties.11 After 1878, so many of the Muslims who had popu¬ lated many towns and fortresses in Serbia vanished in a series of expulsions and massacres that, by the eve of the Balkan Wars, Serbia was virtually Muslim-free. After Serbian statehood, nearly all of the hundreds of mosques that stood in this former Ottoman principality were systemati¬ cally destroyed.12 During the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, the term cleansing was used explicitly to describe Serbia’s method of acquiring territory.13 In northern Albania Serbian and Montenegrin fighters turned whole villages into crematoriums, where women, children, and the disabled were burned alive.14 Their brutality was vividly portrayed in the eyewitness accounts of M. Edith Durham, a British war correspondent and nurse, who adminis¬ tered care to Montenegrin soldiers. Durham reported that Montenegrins and Serbs routinely mutilated the Albanian, Turkish, and Bosnian Muslim civilians, and she particularly noted their practice of cutting off the noses and upper lips of their still-living victims: [The Montenegrins] all gloried in their bestiality, and related in detail their nose-cutting exploits, imitated the impaling of a Turk upon a bay¬ onet, and the slicing off of his nose and upper lip, and they shouted advice to the still living man: “Go home and show your wives how pretty you are!” All, with very few exceptions, had taken noses. An old man of seventy had only taken two, but excused himself on the grounds of having fallen ill at the beginning. . . . A Russian surgeon, the only foreign doctor who had been allowed in the Kosovo district, came to work with us for a few days, and corrob¬ orated the [Montenegrins’] statement that they had scarcely left a nose on a corpse between Berani [Montenegro] and Ipek [Kosovo]. Some warm partisans of Montenegro have declared that they do not see anything horrible in the mutilation of dead bodies . . . but the men’s own account was that they mutilated the wounded before giving them a final bayonet prod. . . . A report came to me that ... in Kosovo [region] the ground in many places was simply strewn with the bodies of women and chil¬ dren. ... I did not . . . attach much belief to the report till a Servian officer turned up at the dinner table, and related, with glee, the valorous deeds of the Serbs. “We have,” he boasted, “annihilated the Ljuma tribe.”15 Durham further described how Serbian troops had tortured civilians with slow death, simply for their own entertainment. The following episode oc¬ curred in the village of Arzi from 1912 to 1913:\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n7\n\nWhen passing through the village in November, the Serbs had merely disarmed the people who had not resisted. But when the troops re¬ turned in April, they amused themselves by bleeding some of their de¬ fenceless victims to death. [The villagers attested:] “Not quickly, as you do sheep, but slowly. They made little cuts on the wrists and elbows and on the necks so that they should be a long time dying.” Some women, with hideous and vivid pantomime, described the manner of the cuts and how the Serbs had danced round the dying victims and imitated their last shudders. . . . Nor were the Serbs themselves ashamed of their exploits, for a Serb officer told a doctor I know, that he had helped to bury people alive in Kosovo.16\n\nRepression and Persecution in the First Yugoslavia The pattern of Serbian persecution of Muslims continued after the creation of Yugoslavia in 1918, when the acquisition of BosniaHerzegovina brought a sizable Slavic Muslim population under Serbian rule. During the first years of Yugoslavia, Serbian Chetniks, encouraged by the government, terrorized and murdered the Slavic Muslims in eastern Herzegovina. In 1924, Serbs massacred several hundred Slavic Muslims in the Sandzak (which had been seized by Serbia in 1913), also with the en¬ couragement of Serbian authorities.17 From the first days of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, virtually the entire state apparatus was in the hands of the same Serbian ruling class that had run the small pre-1918 Serbian kingdom. For example, in the first twenty-four Yugoslav governments (1918-29), Serbs held the post of prime minister 97 percent of the time; defense minister, 100 percent; interior minister, 92 percent; foreign minister, 83 percent; fi¬ nance minister, 98 percent; education minister, 83 percent; and justice min¬ ister, 87 percent.18 Croats had comprised over 15 percent of the generals and admirals in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces, and Croatian regi¬ ments had a centuries-long reputation for military prowess. Nevertheless, in Royal Yugoslavia only Serbian military traditions, governing everything from uniform and rank to regulations, were maintained.19 Serbian officers were retained automatically in the new Yugoslav army, while those of Cro¬ atian or Montenegrin background (or even Serbs from Croatia) needed to apply to join. If accepted, often these former Austrian-Hungarian officers or soldiers were given reduced pay and sent to distant posts.20 Former Austro-Hungarian officers with at least twelve years of education occupied ranks inferior to those of younger Serbian officers, often unschooled peas¬ ants. Although the Latin script of the Croatian language was recognized\n\n8\n\nSerbia’s secret war\n\nalong with the Cyrillic script under the constitution, the use of the Latin alphabet by the Croatian officers was taken as evidence of antipatriotism and even punished. Montenegrins, however, were soon accepted as brother Serbs, while Croats, who had served as former Austro-Hungarian officers, resigned. By the eve of World War II, 161 of 165 generals in the Royal Yugoslav Army were Serbs or Montenegrins.21 Immediately after the declaration of the Yugoslav state in December, 1918, the Serbian army and police were installed throughout the former AustroHungarian lands—including Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, and Vojvodina—as had been done in Macedonia and Kosovo upon their an¬ nexation by Serbia several years earlier. Serbian forces imposed a brutal martial law on the civilian non-Serbian populations, who were treated as enemies, and whose lands were treated as Serbian conquests. For example, an edict of April 28, 1919, plainly stated: “The inhabitants of enemy dis¬ tricts, occupied by the army, are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts.”22 Such justice was administered under Serbian military codes, which were never publicized. Daily beatings with clubs became common¬ place in Croat- and Muslim-populated areas.23 Not uncommonly, innkeep¬ ers and waitresses were taken to military barracks and beaten for refusing to use “Greater Serbia” as a designation for Yugoslavia.24 The military rou¬ tinely pillaged private property, confiscated boats without explanation or compensation, and confiscated guns from respected burghers. Some local Serbian military commanders even devised their own rules for corporal punishment. One Lt. Col. Petar Teslic, commander of the Zagreb Infantry Regiment, prescribed his own penal code: affronts to the king were punish¬ able by twenty-five blows, plunder would be punished “immediately on the spot” by firing squad, and “He who beats mildly will have the same num¬ ber of sharp blows measured to himself.”25 Serbian authorities routinely imprisoned and murdered Croatian polit¬ ical leaders and prominent intellectuals.26 The most significant of these po¬ litical murders took place on the floor of the Parliament in Belgrade on June 20, 1928, when Punisa Racic—a deputy of the Serbian Radical Party and the former president of an extremist Chetnik organization—pulled out his revolver and shot five members of the Croatian Peasant Party for de¬ nouncing government corruption.27 Two victims died immediately, and the popular leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, Stjepan Radic, died six weeks later. As punishment, Racic spent a period confined to his home. Radic was then succeeded by Vladko Macek, who demanded Croatian autonomy, called for a new federal constitution, and conducted a rump parliamentary session in Zagreb. In response, on January 6, 1929, King Aleksandar Kara-\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n9\n\ndordevic jailed Macek, abolished the Constitution of 1921, dissolved the Parliament, and outlawed all political parties. He also proclaimed a royal dictatorship and changed the name of the country from the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes to Yugoslavia, in an apparent move to annihi¬ late the identity of the constituent nations of the Serbian-ruled kingdom.28 Under Aleksandar’s dictatorship, the Serbian ruling circles consoli¬ dated their control over the military, police, and legal apparatus. The press was rigidly censored, and the campaign of repression—especially against the Croats and Macedonians—intensified. Typically, taxation in Croatia and Slovenia was often ten times greater than in Serbia, but the revenue was devoted almost only to Serbian agriculture, commerce, industry, rail¬ roads, and government employees.29 A dissident Serbian lawyer in Belgrade, Rajko Jovanovic, decried Yugoslavia’s systematic, state-sponsored violence in a pamphlet titled Glavnjaca kao sistem (The Glavnjaca Prison as a System). According to Jovanovic’s documentation, the first ten years of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes were marked by twenty-four political death senten¬ ces, about six hundred political assassinations, thirty thousand political arrests, three thousand political emigrants, and numerous political expul¬ sions. The overwhelming majority of political victims were Croats, Mace¬ donians, and Albanians.30 Jovanovic was the first in the country to collect systematically the evidence of Yugoslav terror. The political murder of the Croatian historian Milan Sufflay in early 1931 prompted international protest. His murder, carried out by two po¬ lice agents, followed years of threats against his life for advancing the opin¬ ion that the Albanians, descended from Illyrian ancestors, were earlier inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula than the Serbs and Croats—a belief V\n\nwhich ran counter to official Serbian history. Sufflay’s murder was carried out by two police agents on the orders of Nikola Jukic, a member of the pro-Serbian organization Mlada Jugoslavia (Young Yugoslavia), and ar¬ rangements for the murder had been worked out one week earlier in the home of Gen. Beli Markovic, the Serbian military commander of Zagreb.31 On February 18, 1931, the official Yugoslav newspaper Nasa sloga (Our Unity), published in the coastal town of Susak (today, part of the city of Rijeka), announced that “skulls will be split.” That very evening in Zagreb, V\n\nSufflay’s skull was smashed open by an iron rod. V\n\nPrompted by the murder of Sufflay, Albert Einstein publicly con¬ demned King Aleksandar’s campaign of “horrible brutality” and “terror¬ ism” against the Croats. This condemnation made the front page of the New York Times in May, 1931, when Einstein and Heinrich Mann, the brother of novelist Thomas Mann, issued a joint appeal to the Paris-based\n\n1o\n\nSerbia’s secret war\n\nLeague for the Rights of Man to intervene on behalf of the Croats and to “muster all possible aid to protect this small, peaceful and highly civilized people.”32 In the portion of Macedonia that Serbia occupied in the Balkan War of 1913 and conveniently renamed “Southern Serbia,” Serbian authorities undertook a program to “Serbianize” the Macedonian population through the destruction of Macedonia’s centuries-old cultural and religious heri¬ tage. In Black Hand over Europe, Henri Pozzi describes the cultural state of Macedonia upon its becoming a Serbian province in 1918: Macedonia had more than 700 churches; she also possessed 86 colleges or secondary schools, with 2,800 students and 460 professors; 556 pri¬ mary schools with 33,000 scholars and 850 teachers. The convents and churches contained inestimable treasures—the fruits of a thousand years of Macedonian culture and thought. The churches, monasteries and schools have been confiscated, all the priests, all the teachers have been expelled, imprisoned, or deported into Old Serbia. The churches and monasteries, which even the Turks themselves had respected, have been pillaged from top to bottom.33 As part of the program to extend Serbian control to Macedonia, the Serbian language was forcibly imposed on the population, and Macedo¬ nian surnames were changed to Serbian forms.34 Brutal police measures were applied systematically. Common methods of interrogation included crushing toes with a hammer, drilling teeth, and mutilating men’s and women’s genitals. Prisons were filled with men, women, and children crowded in cells too small to permit movement. Macedonian women were typically whipped, beaten, and raped, but also subjected to gruesome tor¬ tures, such as pouring fuel on their armpits and loins and setting them on fire.35 Such atrocities were instituted as policy by Zika Lazic, the chief of the state police (and later the Yugoslav minister of the interior), of whom the following description was offered by a French author: I was at Belgrade, in July 1932, dining at the Excelsior Restaurant be¬ hind the royal palace. . . . Lasitch [Lazic] came to sit down next to us. . . . He had just returned from Macedonia where he had been or¬ ganising the State Police. I noticed one thing particularly, all the while he was animatedly telling us risque stories about women, he did not stop picking little flies from the table cloth which he would hold for a moment struggling between his fingers. Then, without stopping his flow of talk, gently one by one, he tore off their wings, and with the end of his cigarette, tapping lightly, unhurriedly, he forced them to crawl by\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n11\n\nburning their abdomens. “With the Macedonian women also,” he said to us, “in order to render them amorous, when they are insensible, we place hot irons on a good spot”36\n\nThe Serbian Fascist Movement oftiie 1930s As elsewhere in pre-World War II Europe, fascist movements emerged in Serbia during the early 1930s. Relatively little, however, has been written in English about that stage of Serbian history. This was a tur¬ bulent period, marked by political strife within Yugoslavia, economic crisis throughout Europe, and the rise of fascism in several nearby countries, such as Italy, Germany, Hungary, and Romania. In Yugoslavia, the major fascist groups—distinctly pro-Serbian in character and primarily Serbian in composition—arose in response to and in support of Aleksandar Karadordevic’s royal Yugoslav dictatorship, declared on January 6, 1929.37 Sup¬ porters of a Serbian monarchy, these groups—most notably, Zdruzenje borcev Jugoslavije (Association of Fighters of Yugoslavia), originally formed in Slovenia; Jugoslovenska akcija (Yugoslav Action); and the Jugoslovenski narodni pokret Zbor (Yugoslav National Movement Zbor)— would reach the zenith of their influence during the Nazi occupation of Serbia (1941-44).38 The Yugoslav Action movement was formed in Belgrade in 1930 and, within three years, was calling for a totalitarian state. Soon, the Yugoslav Action adopted symbols imitative of the Nazis. Appropriating a blue swas¬ tika as their symbol and the raising of the right hand as their salute, they attracted considerable interest in Berlin. In 1934, Viktor von Heeren, the German envoy in Belgrade, reported to his Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the Yugoslav Action “shows a kinship with National Socialism, even in its external characteristics.”39 Velibor Jonic, who would later play a promi¬ nent role in the Zbor and was a minister in the Serbian collaborationist governments of Acimovic and Nedic, was elected secretary-general of the Yugoslav Action.40 Older than the Yugoslav Action but similar in outlook was the Zveza slovenskib vojakov (Union of Slovene Soldiers), which was formed in 1929 to support King Aleksandar’s newly declared dictatorship and, by the end of 1930, was renamed Zveza bojevnikov (Union of Fighters). By July, 1931, the Union of Fighters had the official approval of the administration of Banovina dravska (Slovenia). This paramilitary organization included World War I volunteers, Serbian Chetniks, and Yugoslav reserve officers (primarily Slovenes and Serbs). As the organization grew, it increasingly attracted individuals from political parties that had been banned by Alek-\n\n12\n\nSERBIA’S SECRET WAR\n\nsandar for their alleged anti-state activities, and for this reason, in 1933, the Union of Slovene Soldiers was itself disbanded by official decree.41 Nevertheless, in December, 1933, the organization was revitalized and united with several other soldiers’ organizations—the Union of Volunteers, the Association of Reserve Officers and Warriors, the Association of War Military Invalids, and another banned organization, the Union of Fight¬ ers—to form Zdruzenje borcev Jugoslav!] e-Bo] (Association of Fighters of Yugoslavia). Like the earlier Union of Slovene Soldiers, it was formed with the intent of supporting the royal Serbian dictatorship. On October 13, 1934, in Belgrade, representatives of various pro-fascist organizations met, including the Yugoslavia Action, the Ljotic-led Otadzbina (Fatherland), the Serbian Herzegovinian movement Zbor (Rally), the Budenje (Awaken¬ ing) movement from Vojvodina, the Slovenian movement Borci (Fighters), and Zveza bojevnikov (Association of Fighters).42 Each participating group agreed to dissolve itself and create a unified movement. The thirteen signa¬ tories to this agreement included Ratko Parezanin, Velibor Jonic, and Dorde Peric, all of whom would later hold official positions in the Nazicollaborationist Serbian governments of 1941-44. Three days after the signing of this agreement, King Aleksandar was assassinated, which further destabilized the political situation in Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia. On December 4, 1934, in the interest of forming a stronger, unified panYugoslav movement, the leadership of the Association of Fighters of Yugo¬ slavia met in Zagreb with other like-minded groups, including the one led by Dimitrije Ljotic, a critical figure in the history of the Serbian fascist movements.43 Dimitrije Ljotic, the son of the Serbian consul to Salonika (Greece), had been religious in his youth and was strongly influenced by the Christian doctrine of nonviolence as advocated by Russian author Leo Tolstoy. After completing his law studies in Belgrade in 1913, Ljotic was sent to Paris to study, financed by King Petar I Karadordevic.44 After 1913, while studying at the Institute of Agriculture in Paris, Ljotic came under the influence of Charles Maurras, whose social and political philosophies were a rejection of the French Revolution, democracy, and individualism and would sup¬ port Hitler and inform the ideology of the Vichy French government of Henri Philippe Petain.45 During the years of World War I, Ljotic rejected Tolstoy’s doctrine of nonviolent Christianity, as he reflected on “how people can be led.” He began to believe that Providence had destined the Serbian people for “a certain grand role,” a recurrent theme in his writ¬ ings.46 Ljotic served in the military until 1920, also working concurrently for\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n•13\n\nthe Yugoslav intelligence service of the Fourth Army District in Croatia.47 In 1919, the commander of the Fourth Army District was Gen. Boza Jankovic, the founder and first president of Srpska narodna odbrana (Serbian National Defense), a pan-Serbian organization closely connected with the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. However, since Jankovic was old and infirm, the real power was in the hands of his chief of staff, Col. Milan Nedic. Intimately connected with this web was Ljotic’s and Nedic’s common friend, Stanislav Krakov, the Fourth Army District code officer responsible for sending secret-coded reports from Croatia to the Su¬ preme Command in Belgrade.48 In 1920, Ljotic joined the Radical Party of Nikola Pasic, stating that it was “God’s will.”49 A staunch believer in the Karadordevic dynasty and supporter of King Aleksandar’s dictatorship, Ljotic in 1929 received his first of several audiences with the king. His loyalty was ultimately rewarded when he was appointed minister of justice on February 16, 1931. Four months later, Ljotic submitted to Aleksandar a written proposal of a new Yugoslav constitution established on the model of Germany and Italy. The King rejected this.50 On August 17, 1931, the government decided to create one government-backed political party. Ljotic, who opposed the creation of any party, resigned from his post. According to Ljotic’s memoirs, he kept the king informed of his future political plans at the king’s request.51 Ljotic established contacts with three pro-fascist groups organized re¬ spectively around three newspapers which began in 1934: the weekly Otadzbina, published in Belgrade; the monthly Zbor, published in Herze¬ govina; and the weekly Budenje, published in Petrovgrad (modern Zrenjanin, Vojvodina).52 Ljotic himself was\n\na contributor to\n\nall three\n\npublications, and he became particularly influential among the Otadz¬ bina group. At the December, 1934, meeting in Zagreb, attended by the Association of Fighters of Yugoslavia and others, Ljotic and his group prevailed in assum¬ ing leadership, in part because of his connections with the Royal Court. The name Zbor was adopted for the entire movement.53 The following month, in an act of intended symbolism, the Yugoslav National Movement Zbor—which merged the Yugoslav Action from Zagreb, the Fighters from Ljubljana, and the Awakening from Petrovgrad—was officially established in Belgrade on January 6, 1935, the sixth anniversary of the imposition of King Aleksandar’s dictatorship.54 Soon, the members of the new, unified Zbor movement elected their leadership: Dimitrije Ljotic as president, Juraj Korenic as first vice presi¬ dent, Fran Kandare as second vice president, and Velibor Jonic as secretary-\n\n14\n\nSERBIA’S SECRET WAR\n\ngeneral. The Belgrade-based Otadzbina became Zbor’s official newspaper in February, 1934. The stated program of Zbor was the imposition of a planned economy and “the racial and biological defense of the national life-force and the family”—a formulation which corresponded closely to Hitler’s own ideology.55 Concerning the question of nationalities and their rights within Yugoslavia, Ljotic firmly opposed any dialogue with the Croats or any other nationals within Yugoslavia. Not all constituent groups were enthusiastic about their membership in the new, unified Zbor movement. Although members of the paramilitary Association of Fighters of Yugoslavia were divided on whether to join the unified Zbor, their leadership unanimously decided in favor. The leadership of the Yugoslav Action, on the other hand, decided not to join.56 Although the Yugoslav Action and Zbor movements operated indepen¬ dently, both were openly supportive of Hitler’s National Socialism and ad¬ vocated warm relations with Germany, which was noted with interest by German envoy Viktor von Heeren.57 Von Heeren’s enthusiasm was echoed in the communique of still another German observer: “The movement Zbor represents a kind of national-socialist party. ... Its principles are the struggle against Freemasons, against Jews, against communists, against Western capitalism.”58 Tjotic’s Zbor movement began to receive financial support from German industrial firms and the German intelligence services as early as 1935.59 When founded, the new Zbor movement was illegal, since political parties, with few exceptions, had been banned in Yugoslavia since 1929. On September 2, 1935, Velibor Jonic and attorney Milan Acimovic peti¬ tioned the Ministry of the Interior to officially approve Zbor. On Novem¬ ber 8, 193 5, the Ministry of the Interior communicated official government approval of the Rules and Program of the Zbor and recognized it as an official political party.60\n\nLjotic enjoyed close relations with the Serbian Orthodox Church, in which he held an official position. As a member of the Patriarchal Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, Ljotic established a close and longlasting association with the highly influential Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovic. Under Ljotic’s influence, Bishop Velimirovic’s clerical organization Bogomoljci (Devotionalists) officially joined Zbor, and some of Velimirovic’s followers became Zbor functionaries.61 As the Zbor movement continued to grow, it attracted the offspring of orthodox priests, police, government officials, and wealthy farmers. Ljotic also drew into the organization more than a dozen high officers from the\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n15\n\nRoyal Yugoslav Army, including Col. Kosta Musicki, who would later command the Serbian Volunteer Corps.62 In 1937, Ljotic promoted his loyal collaborator Stanislav Krakov to the chief of the Propaganda Section of the Zbor. Krakov, who would later become editor in chief of the collaborationist Belgrade newspaper Obnova, was a student of Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf, to which he referred admir¬ ingly.63 The Zbor participated in the 1935 and 1938 Yugoslav elections. In the National Assembly elections in May, 1935, Zbor offered 8,190 candi¬ dates throughout Yugoslavia. This list of candidates was officially ap¬ proved by the Yugoslav government, as were three other lists: that of the Yugoslav government, led by Bogoljub Jevtic, premier and minister of for¬ eign affairs; that of the United Opposition, led by Vladko Macek, leader V\n\nof the Croatian Peasant Party; and that of Bozidar Z. Maksimovic, the recently resigned justice minister and a Radical Party dissident. In the elec¬ tions of 1935, Ljotic’s candidates received less than 1 percent of the 2,778,172 votes cast. The candidates led by Bogoljub Jevtic won the elec¬ tions with 62.6 percent of the vote.64 Only a month later, however, Prince Pavle replaced Jevtic with Milan Stojadinovic, who formed his own politi¬ cal party, the Yugoslav Radical Union. Stojadinovic headed the royal Yugo¬ slav government as premier from June, 1935, until February, 1939. Stojadinovic initially led with political flexibility and pro-democratic rheto¬ ric. He relaxed police oppression, abandoned censorship of the newspa¬ pers, and granted amnesty to political prisoners.65 By 1937, however, his government increasingly emulated the fascist models of Italy, Hungary, Ro¬ mania, and Germany. Stojadinovic established pro-regime trade unions, as was the practice in Germany and Italy. He organized the “green shirts,” a paramilitary youth group in imitation of Germany’s brown shirts and Italy’s black shirts. Special salutes were introduced, and Stojadinovic’s intelligence service intensified its surveillance of the citizenry, while ignoring Germany’s growing espionage of Yugoslavia.66 Stojadinovic advocated closer relations with Hitler and, like Ljotic, he proved unsympathetic and uncompromising in handling Croatian complaints of government corruption and demands for increased autonomy.67 Indeed, with time, Stojadinovic’s ideology be¬ came less distinguishable from that of Ljotic, and, perhaps because their political agendas converged, Stojadinovic and Ljotic became political adversaries.68 Ljotic repeatedly attacked Stojadinovic though Zbor publications, ac¬ cusing him of various acts of treason against Yugoslavia—and even charg¬ ing him with involvement in the 1934 assassination of King Aleksandar. Stojadinovic, in turn, attempted to discredit Ljotic by disclosing that Ljotic\n\n16\n\nSerbia’s secret war\n\nwas funded by Germany.69 Some of the compromising materials used against Ljotic came from Marshal Hermann Goring, the head of the Ger¬ man air force and a Stojadinovic supporter.70 A number of Zbor function¬ aries were already questioning Ljotic’s effectiveness as a leader, and, since 1935, some of the Union of Fighters and some Zbor members already had left Lj otic’s movement.71 To further weaken Zbor, Stojadinovic offered money and power to a number of its most prominent members. Indeed, at the end of 1937, Ljotic purged a number of high-ranking Zbor leaders, who soon reemerged in official or semi-official positions in the Stojadi¬ novic government. Danilo Vulovic was appointed to a ministerial post in the Stojadinovic government. Borde Peric, the Zbor press section chief, soon headed the semi-official Yugoslav news agency, Avala. Danilo Gregoric, the Zbor pro¬ paganda section chief and supreme youth leader, was installed as the editor in chief of the government journal Vreme (Time) and was furnished with a home, a luxury automobile, and money. Velibor Jonic, the secretarygeneral of the Zbor movement, became a teacher in the royal court.72 The defections of Peric, Jonic, and Gregoric, all of whom would play prominent roles during the German occupation, advanced the careers of still other Zbor members, who would later assume influential positions in wartime Serbia. For example, Gregoric was replaced by Ratko Parezanin, later the editor in chief of the collaborationist Nasa borba, and Jonic was replaced by Milorad Mojic.73 (The reconciliation between Ljotic and the defectors from Zbor would occur during the German occupation, when they would once again unite on the same political platform.) Ljotic repeatedly used the Zbor organ Otadzbina to attack Stojadi¬ novic, who, in turn, frequently banned issues of Otadzbina. By the end of 1939, almost all Zbor publications, including Otadzbina, Nas put, Vibor, Zbor, and Budenje, would be banned. In 1938, during the months preced¬ ing the elections, Stojadinovic prohibited Zbor rallies and newspapers, seized Zbor propaganda materials, and arrested Zbor leaders. In Septem¬ ber, 1938, Royal Yugoslav Gendarmes opened fire on a crowd of Zbor supporters, killing at least one person, and Ljotic was arrested.74 On October 10, 1938, Stojadinovic’s government dissolved the Na¬ tional Assembly, proclaimed new elections, and arrested some members of Zbor. Ljotic asserted that the authorities were “arresting us not because we have deserved arrests but because they want in this way to prevent our participation in the elections.”75 Indeed, speaking with one high-ranking Zbor member, Stojadinovic indicated that he would not tolerate the exis¬ tence of Zbor because “what the Zbor wants is what I want; therefore, there is no place for Zbor. In the autumn, I will have militarily trained\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n17\n\nyouth in uniforms. And then I will go to the elections .”76 In response, Ljotic published a brochure. Titled “A Message to the Fascist Apprentice,” it criti¬ cized Stojadinovic for, above all, lacking originality of thought and pur¬ pose; Stojadinovic was merely an imitator of Mussolini and the “hero and martyr,” Adolf Hitler, while Ljotic claimed for himself an equal status with both Mussolini and Hitler as an innovator of native fascism.77 The elections of December, 1938, offered three candidate lists: that of the Stojadinovic government, that of the Croatian leader Vladko Macek, and that of Dimitrije Ljotic. Of the 3,039,041 votes cast, these lists won fifty-four, forty-five, and one percent of the vote, respectively.78 Zbor’s poor showing among the Serbian voters in 1938 cannot be interpreted as a pop¬ ular rejection of fascism, since the majority of Serbian voters, in fact, elected the pro-fascist candidates running under Milan Stojadinovic. In the election battle between the two pro-fascists, Stojadinovic’s victory over Ljotic was due to several factors: Stojadinovic’s advantage of incumbency; his pre-election public attacks on Zbor; the arrests of its leaders and the suppression of its publications; and Stojadinovic’s courtship of key Zbor leaders. Notably, in the Croatian regions, including areas with a Serbian population, Macek’s list won nearly seventy percent of the 1,373,296 votes cast.79 In February, 1939, however, due to the heightened internal crisis resulting from Stojadinovic’s failure to resolve the Croatian national question, Prince Pavle removed him as premier. Stojadinovic’s dismissal dismayed the Reich authorities in Berlin, for, on Hitler’s orders, the Volksdeutscbe (ethnic German) minority of Vojvodina, roughly five hundred thousand, had voted en bloc for Stojadinovic.80 The Italian authorities also were upset by Stojadinovic’s removal, since Stojadinovic had made a secret agreement with Mussolini acknowledging Italy’s territorial aspirations in Albania in exchange for Mussolini’s restraining of Ustasha activities. Stojadinovic was replaced by the undistinguished but more malleable Dragisa Cvetkovic. The Germans’ disappointment was partially assuaged when Aleksandar Cincar-Markovic, Stojadinovic’s ambassador to the Third Reich, was appointed foreign minister in the new government. CincarMarkovic was unabashedly pro-Hitler, and he would collaborate with the Germans throughout the Nazi occupation of Serbia.81 In August, 1939, Gen. Milan Nedic was appointed minister of the army and the navy in the Cvetkovic-Macek government. Ljotic frequently contacted Nedic, who happened to be a relative of his, through Col. Milos Masalovic, who was Nedic’s chief of cabinet and a Zbor member.82 With the assistance of Masalovic, the Zbor organ Bilten (Bulletin) was published illegally in the military printing house and was distributed throughout Yu-\n\n18\n\nSerbia’s secret war\n\ngoslavia by Serbian military couriers. Ljotic was its editor in chief and main contributor, and from March, 1939, to October, 1940, fifty-eight issues of Bilten appeared.83 The later issues were printed in nearly twenty thousand copies each. Bilten proved especially influential in the Royal Yugoslav Army, and Ljotic particularly was satisfied to exert influence among young trainees in the military academy as well as among certain high-ranking officers. Ljotic’s other writings from these same months revealed an unbridled admiration for Adolf Hitler as the savior of Europe. For example, soon after Germany’s occupation of Czechoslovakia in March, 1939, Ljotic wrote an article, “Behind the Dark Clouds God’s Golden Sun Shines,” in which he proposed that this seemingly gloomy day for Slavdom actually represented salvation: That day, March 15,1 was returning home by a train. I was completely alone in the whole car. It was getting dark. I was wondering why did I not feel depressed. Just the opposite. I was wondering why I felt some crazy confidence during a day so difficult for Slavdom . . . and then I understood why was I not depressed. Hitler is an instrument of God’s Providence.84 In 1939, Vladko Macek, the president of the Croatian Peasant Party, engaged in five months of negotiations, under the instructions of Prince Pavle, with Serbian counterpart Dragisa Cvetkovic. These negotiations were intended to address the growing list of Croatian grievances. The result was the Cvetkovic-Macek Sporazum (Agreement) of August 26, 1939> which created a semi-autonomous Croatian political unit, Banovina Hrvatska, within Yugoslavia that would remain closely tied to Yugoslavia through finance and banking, the military, foreign policy, and joint legisla¬ tion. Prince Pavle then replaced the Stojadinovic government with the Cvetkovic-Macek government. The terms of the 1939 agreement, however, were never fully imple¬ mented, and many Serbian members of the Yugoslav government remained vehemently opposed to any concession to the Croats. Indeed, the agree¬ ment stimulated activity among various political groups advocating Greater Serbia. One such group, the Serbian Cultural Club, included such notables as Vasa Cubrilovic (author of “The Expulsion of Albanians”) and Nikola Stojanovic (author of “Until Your or Our Extermination”). During one of his frequent speeches at the Serbian Culture Club, Ljotic blamed the Croats for the internal problems of Yugoslavia and suggested that the Ser¬ bian military should crush any movements which threatened the hegemony of Serbs. Speaking for the Zbor movement, Ljotic repeatedly attacked\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n19\n\nCvetkovic for making concessions to the Croats.85 On foreign policy, Ljotic maintained that Yugoslavia should support the Axis powers and make a sincere gesture of friendship toward the Third Reich by removing the in¬ fluence of Jews and Freemasons on Yugoslav policy.86 The Zbor movement, long funded by the German industry and intelli¬ gence services, was infiltrated by the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei, or the Secret State Police), the Abwehr (German military intelligence), and the SS (Scbutzstaffel, or Protective Formation). Ljotic’s contacts with the SS were specifically through the SD (Sicberbeitsdienst), the branch of the SS that would engineer the Holocaust. The German spy network had also infiltrated the Stojadinovic government. For example, ministers Ante Mastrovic, Buro Cejovic, and Dusan Pantic were all clandestinely connected with the SS Reichssicherbeitshauptamt (RSHA, the Reich Security Central Office) in Berlin, where the Yugo¬ slav section was headed by Karl Kraus and his assistant Hans Helm. Their agents also included Dusan Pantic, Stevan Klujic, and Lazar Prokic (future publishers of the Nazi propaganda magazine Signal), as well as Milan Acimovic, Dragomir (Dragi) Jovanovic, and Milan Banic, all of whom would play prominent roles in the collaborationist Serbian governments.87 Ljotic himself played a central role in this German spy network and would later assist Kraus in establishing contacts with Milan Nedic.88 On October 23, 1940, at Belgrade University, the Zbor youth move¬ ment, known as Beli orlovi (White Eagles), violently clashed with proCommunist students of the Department of Technology. Members of Slovenski jug (Slavic South), another Serbian nationalist group, also partic¬ ipated in the two days of bloody attacks on students and professors, punc¬ tuated by slogans such as “Long live Ljotic!” “Heil Hitler!” “Viva il Duce!” “Down with the Jews!” “Down with the Freemasons!”89 The po¬ lice, who had foreknowledge of the attack, were withdrawn from the area.90 The university president, Petar Micic, sympathized with Zbor. The riots were orchestrated by Ljotic, who hoped that the crisis would provoke the imposition of the equivalent of martial law at the university, thereby bringing Belgrade University under more centralized control.91 However, the plan backfired, generating public outrage, and the royal government in response further curtailed Zbor activities. On October 24, 1940, the royal government quietly revoked Zbor’s legal status, leaving even the Zbor unaware of its decision. On November 2, 1940, the Ministry of the Interior sent a list of Zbor members to all district administrators. The next day, the administration of the City of Belgrade entered the headquarters of the secretariat of the Zbor movement and in-\n\n20\n\nSERBIA’S SECRET WAR\n\nformed Zbor members that their organization had been disbanded. Yugo¬ slav police were ordered by the government to search for and compile lists of Zbor functionaries.92 The police often instructed Zbor members to deny their affiliation with Zbor, however. Many did so, with the result that rela¬ tively few Zbor members were confirmed to exist in Yugoslavia. During October and November of 1940, only about 160 members of Zbor were arrested.93 Macek’s Croatian constituency regarded Ljotic as an enemy of Croats. In¬ deed, Ljotic repeatedly wrote letters to Prince Pavle, urging him to annul the semi-autonomous Croatian Banovina that was created as the result of the 1939 Agreement. In a characteristically shrill tone, Ljotic wrote to Prince Pavle: “Stop the Croatian experiment immediately .”94 Pavle—who had labored to achieve internal stability—ordered the prosecution of Ljotic, largely because of Ljotic’s militantly anti-Croatian stand. Actions against Zbor, particularly against Ljotic, however, were un¬ dertaken with some trepidation, lest the Germans be provoked. Although the government investigation concluded that Zbor was guilty of high trea¬ son and accepting funds from another country (Germany), Ljotic was never arrested but instead was placed under surveillance from which he soon escaped. Ljotic hid with friends in Belgrade and maintained frequent com¬ munications with Milan Nedic and Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovic.95 On November 6, 1940, the same day that police actions were initiated against the Zbor, Pavle had obtained the resignation of the minister of the army and navy, Gen. Milan Nedic, because of his advocacy of a strong alliance with the Axis powers.96 Following Nedic’s resignation, and despite police surveillance, there appeared additional issues of Ljotic’s Bilten sup¬ porting a pro-Axis foreign policy and criticizing the government’s contin¬ ued tolerance of Jews and Freemasons. Ljotic also attacked the pro-British elements of the government who would oppose the signing of the Tripar¬ tite Pact.97\n\nThe Tripartite Pact and the 1941 Coup The Tripartite Pact, which formalized the Axis alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, was signed in September, 1940. Soon after, Ber¬ lin began to urge the Yugoslav government to join the Axis, and, once Bul¬ garia’s King Boris signed the pact, this pressure intensified. From the beginning, Hitler’s preferred course of action was the preservation of Yugo¬ slavia rather than the creation of an independent Croatian entity. Most German leaders were pro-Serbian, inspired, in part, by the warm welcome\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n21\n\ngiven to Hermann Goring in Belgrade, when he represented Germany at the 1934 funeral of King Aleksandar.98 Pro-Serbian views were also held by Franz Neubacher (the German consul-general highly respected by Goring), Viktor von Heeren (the Belgrade ambassador), and Paul Schmidt (the chief of the Press Section of the German Foreign Ministry). Schmidt had been particularly influenced by Danilo Gregoric, who, as a member of the Zbor and the editor in chief of the government journal Vreme, had become his principal source of information on Yugoslavia. According to the postwar writings of a German intelligence officer, Gregoric had led Schmidt to pub¬ lish “a number of pro-Yugoslav articles in the German press,” his primary object being to awaken a sympathetic interest in Hitler and the other leaders for Yugoslavia and, in particular, for the Serbs. He lauded the centuries-old and heroic struggle of the valiant Serbian people against the Turkish oppressor, the military virtues of the warlike Serbs, their chivalrous characteristics and so on, and succeeded in mak¬ ing quite a plausible case for a moral relationship which he professed to see between Germans and Serbs. By this means he greatly strength¬ ened the pro-Serb feeling which already existed among the German leaders. Hitler himself repeatedly declared that he regarded an alliance with the brave and warlike Serbs as an object particularly worth striv¬ ing for. The Croats, on the other hand, had no really influential man in Berlin to plead their cause.\" On March, 4, 1941, Adolf Hitler and Prince Pavle met at Berchtesgaden, Germany. In return for Yugoslavia’s joining the Tripartite Pact, Hitler agreed to a number of Prince Pavle’s demands: that Salonika would be ceded to Yugoslavia, albeit after the war; that Yugoslavia’s territorial integ¬ rity would be protected against invaders, particularly Italy; that Yugoslavia would have no obligation to enter the war on behalf of the Axis; that no Axis arms or troops, not even the wounded, would cross Yugoslavia’s terri¬ tory; and that the terms of the agreement would be published. Hitler con¬ sented to all terms except the last.100 Two days later, on March 6, Prince Pavle convened a meeting of the Crown Council (the executive committee of the cabinet) in Belgrade to con¬ sider Hitler’s offer.101 After hearing the minister of the army and navy, Gen. Petar Pesic, state that he favored collaboration because Yugoslavia was in no position to defend itself militarily, Macek asked whether German prom¬ ises could be trusted, and Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Markovic replied that they could. On March 10, a second Crown Council meeting was called to consider the pact. At this meeting, Milan Antic, minister of\n\n22\n\nSERBIA’S SECRET WAR\n\nthe Royal Court, proposed that Yugoslavia insist on not only the annex¬ ation of the Greek port city of Salonika, but additional Greek territory as well. Macek and Kulovec both strongly refused to be party to plans for territorial aggrandisement.102 On March 20, the Crown Council met for the last time to vote on the Tripartite Pact. Attending the meeting were six Serbian high officials, one Slovene, and one Croat.103 The Slovene, Fran Kulovec, was concerned over Slovenia’s borders with Austria and Italy and was the first to suggest sign¬ ing the pact. The Croat, Vladko Macek, asked if refusal to sign would mean war with the Axis, and Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Markovic replied that it would. The willingness of the Croatian and Slovenian repre¬ sentatives to sign the pact was contingent on the understanding that they were prepared to renounce it once Yugoslavia’s forces were built up to the point that the country could defend itself.104 The Crown Council then voted unanimously in favor of signing the Tripartite Pact. On the same day, the cabinet voted to accept the pact, sixteen to three.105 By March 23, rumors of a planned coup d’etat had reached Prince Pavle and Cvetkovic; one of the coup plotters, General Simovic, warned Pavle that he would not be able to restrain his officers from bombing the Royal Court if the Tripartite Pact were signed. On March 25, 1941, Cvet¬ kovic and Cincar-Markovic, representing Yugoslavia, signed the Tripartite Pact in Vienna. Not present at the signing was Macek, the leader of the Croatian majority party, who refused to attend the ceremony, stating be¬ forehand that “even four oxen couldn’t drag me to go.”106 The next morning, Yugoslav newspapers reported the signing of the Tripartite Pact. As foreign radio stations broadcast the news, demonstra¬ tions broke out in the streets and schools throughout Yugoslavia.107 Then, during the early hours of March 27, a group of Serbian officers carried out a coup against Prince Pavle and installed seventeen-year-old Petar II Karadordevic as the ruling king. The same day, Simovic appointed Mom¬ cilo Nincic, the president of Nemacko-Jugoslovensko drustvo (GermanYugoslav Society) of Belgrade, who had excellent connections with official Italian circles, to be the Yugoslav foreign minister. Although Nincic’s ap¬ pointment met strong opposition from the Croatian leadership and the Independent Democrats—a Serbian party with a history of cooperation with the Croatian Peasant Party—Nincic had the almost unanimous sup¬ port of the Serbian ministers.108 Following his appointment on March 27, Nincic’s first order of busi¬ ness was to assure the German ambassador, Viktor von Heeren, that Yugo¬ slavia would uphold the terms of the Tripartite Pact.109 Unaware of this double game, British prime minister Winston Churchill proclaimed that\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n23\n\n“early this morning the Yugoslav nation found its soul” and officially rec¬ ognized the Simovic government on the very day of the coup.110 In Serbian nationalist historiography, the March 27 coup has been in¬ terpreted as a popular Serbian revolt against the Tripartite Pact. The coup, however, was the work of the British intelligence service and a handful of British-funded high-ranking Serbian officers.111 The motivations of the British and the Serbs were quite different. While the British sought to un¬ dermine Yugoslavia’s cooperation with the Axis, the Serbian officers wanted to remove Pavle largely because of his accommodations to the Croats. Moreover, there was a rival coup faction, which was entirely proGerman and supported by Ljotic’s Zbor. Whatever their differences in for¬ eign policy, the internal policy of both coup factions was the same: the installation of a Serbian military dictatorship. Toward the end of 1940, the Zbor counterconspiracy revealed their plans to the German intelligence service, but Hitler refused to support the plot. Since Hitler was already working toward establishing closer cooperation with Yugoslavia’s Prince Pavle, to support a putsch not only would have been superfluous, but po¬ tentially harmful as well.112 The British involvement in the preparations for the coup had begun several months earlier, in the summer of 1940, when the British govern¬ ment tried openly to influence the ruling group, which included Prince Pavle, Cvetkovic, and Macek, while covertly supporting the Serbian nation¬ alist-oriented opposition that wanted to overthrow Pavle. The British culti¬ vated contacts in Yugoslav military and political circles through business contacts, diplomacy, and the British intelligence service—the Special Oper¬ ations Executive (SOE). For example, T. G. Mapplebeck was a member of the British embassy and a businessman whose joint British-Serbian aviation firm supplied military equipment to the Yugoslav Air Force. Mapplebeck forged close links with a number of high-ranking officers, including the three generals who plotted the coup and to whom he channeled funds from the British government.113 The SOE also provided funds to and bribed key leaders of the Serbian Agrarian Party and the Democratic Party. Months before the coup, the SOE had delivered a railroad car full of weapons and radio communication equipment to the Serbian Agrarian Party. The SOE had also infiltrated a number of Serbian nationalist organizations such as the Chetniks, the vet¬ erans associations, the Order of the White Eagles with Swords, and Narodna Odbrana (the National Defense), headed by Ilija Trifunovic-Bircanin, the influential president of all Chetnik organizations (and later war crimi¬ nal). The SOE established especially close ties to Trifunovic-Bircanin and\n\n24\n\nSerbia’s secret war\n\nfunded his organization whose origins were in the conspiracy to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand.114 Three air force generals on the British payroll—Borivoje Mirkovic, Dusan Simovic, and Bogoljub Ilic—would play a critical role in the March 27 coup. Simovic had first considered a coup against Prince Pavle in 1938, when the Yugoslav government was negotiating a concordat with the Vati¬ can, an initiative bitterly opposed and ultimately prevented by the Serbs. Again in 1940, in planning the March 27 coup, Simovic had also received guarantees of support from the Russians and intended to foster closer ties between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Mirkovic, who would become the principal commander of the coup, was a strong supporter of Greater Serbia and had resolved years earlier to oust Pavle in favor of Serbian mili¬ tary rule. Mirkovic saw Pavle as too liberal and too conciliatory to the Croats’ demands for more independence from Belgrade. It is doubtful that Mirkovic’s sentiments were particularly anti-German, since in his own quarters he prominently displayed a signed photograph of his fellow air¬ man, Marshal Hermann Goring. Mirkovic, in turn, recruited his friends, the Knezevic brothers, each of whom provided useful contacts with the V\n\nBritish. Maj. Zivan Knezevic commanded a Royal Guard infantry battal¬ ion, and Professor Radoje Knezevic was prominent among intellectuals in the influential Serbian Cultural Club.115 The plotters considered two plans for the coup. In one plan, the coup would be executed before the signing of the Tripartite Pact. Prince Pavle would remain in power but would be forced to replace the Cvetkovic gov¬ ernment with an entirely Serbian government, which would exclude the participation of Croats or Slovenes. The new government would be led by Gen. Dusan Simovic. According to the second plan, the coup would be executed after the signing of the Tripartite Pact. Pavle would be expelled, young King Petar II would be proclaimed the ruler, and the government led by Simovic, including Croats and Slovenes, would declare a general mobilization. This plan was adopted on March n.116 By March 24, while the Yugoslav delegation was en route to Vienna for the signing of the pact, the British intensified pressure on the plotters to go forward with the coup. The SOE was reassured by Chetnik leader Trifunovic-Bircanin that plans for the coup were well advanced. As late as March 26, T. G. Mapplebeck persuaded General Mirkovic to proceed with the coup within forty-eight hours.117 The almost bloodless coup d’etat (one gendarme was killed) began late on March 26 and was completed by the early hours of the next morning. At the time of the coup, Prince Pavle was in Zagreb, where Macek offered\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n25\n\nto lead Croatian troops in a march on Belgrade to crush the rebellion. Pavle, however, rejected Macek’s offer, which he saw as carrying the risk of civil war and as jeopardizing the unity of Serbs and Croats. Following Simovic’s demand, Prince Pavle returned to Belgrade and tendered his re¬ signation. Simovic, as the new premier, announced the formation of his government, which included Vladko Macek as a vice-premier—a move intended to prevent Croatian opposition to the coup. In fact, Simovic’s announcement of Macek’s inclusion in the coup government was under¬ taken before the Croatian leader had been contacted at all. On April i, Macek convened a meeting of the leadership of the Croatian Peasant Party and insisted that Croatia must defend Serbia in the event of war, and this was affirmed in a unanimous resolution. Summoned by Simovic, Macek proceeded several days later to Belgrade, where, seeing no alternative, he reluctantly joined the coup government.118 The other vice-premier of the newly formed Simovic government was Slo¬ bodan Jovanovic of the British-funded Serbian Agrarian Party. The events that followed, however, bore little resemblance to British expectations. The new government not only continued the policy of accommodation to Hitler but began to recruit Serbian pro-Axis supporters. In one of its first acts, the coup government released all of Ljotic’s followers from prison and halted judicial proceedings against them. Moreover, the newly appointed minister of the army and navy, Gen. Bogoljub Ilic—one of the British-funded coup leaders and known as notoriously hostile to the Croats—promptly invited Ljotic, the vocal Nazi supporter, to join the new government. Ljotic had previously been encouraged to join the new government by Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovic, who had foreknowledge of the impending coup d’etat. How¬ ever, Ljotic was excluded from the new government, largely due to the V\n\nobjections of Branko Cubrilovic, a Freemason undoubtedly offended by Ljotic’s anti-Masonic demagoguery and a friend of Simovic. Although Ljotic himself did not join, a number of his followers were accepted into government service. For example, during the first hours of the coup, Col. Milos Masalovic, a member of the Zbor movement, presented himself for duty. Previously dismissed in 1940 from military service—along with Mi¬ lan Nedic—by Prince Pavle’s government for his strong pro-Axis views, Masalovic was reactivated and appointed the commander of the Infantry Regiment of the Royal Guard.119 Thus, the March 27 coup d’etat, carried out by a relatively small num¬ ber of conspirators, was more a testimony to the efficacy of the British intelligence service and the opportunism of its plotters than to any wide¬ spread popular Serbian sympathy for the Allied cause. In reality, the coup\n\n26\n\nSERBIA’S SECRET WAR\n\nwas never so clearly anti-Axis as it was anti-Pavle and anti-Croatian, and from the beginning it was in part driven by pro-Axis Serbs. Despite revi¬ sionist attempts to portray pre-World War II Serbia as staunchly anti¬ fascist, Serbia indeed bred its own fascist movement.\n\nRoots of Serbian Fascism\n\n27\n\nThe effect of the March 27 coup was felt in Berlin. Hitler, who was at this time preoccupied with his plans to invade Russia and considered German-Yugoslav issues settled, became furious, having worked to reach an agreement with Prince Pavle.1 Hitler had little confidence in coup leaders supported by Great Britain, despite their immediate overtures to the Third Reich. Publicly attributing the coup to “Communists,” Hitler resolved to impose his own brand of stability in the Balkans.2 On April 6, 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. The Italians immediately implemented long¬ standing designs and annexed most of the Croatian coast. To encourage the cooperation of Hungary and Bulgaria, Hitler had offered them parts of Yugoslav territory to which they had claims or aspirations. Hungary an¬ nexed Backa (Vojvodina), Medimurje and Baranja (Croatia), and Prekomurje (Slovenia). Bulgaria received most of Macedonia, part of eastern Serbia, and a small part of Kosovo. The Royal Yugoslav Army had been poorly equipped and poorly trained. Most of the weapons and uniforms were World War I-era, and the air force consisted of World War I-vintage biplanes with open cockpits. Furthermore, almost all of the Yugoslav commanding generals—virtually all Serbs—were opposed to fighting the Nazis and sought an armistice.3 The Axis forces easily prevailed—and were surprised by the lack of resistance. By April 12, the first German units had reached Belgrade. On April 14, the supreme command of the Royal Yugoslav Army ordered its units to stop fighting and sought a truce with the Germans, who demanded instead\n\n28\n\nThe Partition of Yugoslavia 1941—45 Legend 1939 Yugoslav border iiiiniiiiiimiiii\n\nGerman-Italian demarcation to Germany to'ta'y to Albania\n\nV///A\n\nto Hungary\n\nKSSSS]\n\nt0 Bulgaria\n\nADRIATIC SEA\n\n100 Miles\n\nan unconditional surrender.4 The same day, the king and his family were evacuated from the air base in Niksic, Montenegro, to Greece. Before de¬ parting, King Petar named Gen. Danilo Kalafatovic the military chief of staff. On April 15, Prime Minister Simovic and his cabinet decided that the government should not capitulate and that only the military should surrender. Simovic and his cabinet then joined King Petar II in Greece, from where the royal government-in-exile would ultimately relocate to London. Two days later, when German troops captured the military command head¬ quarters in the town of Pale, near Sarajevo, Kalafatovic designated Gen. Radivoje Jankovic and Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Markovic to sign the unconditional surrender in Belgrade. During the twelve days of onslaught, the Germans took 345,000 Yugoslav soldiers as prisoners of war, while German losses were light: 151 killed, 392 wounded, and 15 missing in action.5 Most of the several dozen captured officers from Ljotic’s Zbor movement were soon released.6 Ljotic received written notice from the German authorities assuring his freedom.7 Serbian nationalists—including coup leader General Simovic and even King Petar himself—blamed Yugoslavia’s failure to resist the Axis invasion on “fifth columnist” Croats; the primary failure of the Yugoslav Army and its virtually all-Serbian leadership was ignored.8\n\nSerbian State\n\n•\n\n2.9\n\nThe German division commanders prior to the invasion did not have instructions on how to administer the conquered territories.
