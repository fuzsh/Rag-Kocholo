During the SFRY period, the town was renamed Titov Vrbas (meaning \"the Vrbas of Tito\"), after Josip Broz Tito. Like all other towns in Socialist Yugoslavia named after Tito, the first part was dropped once the new states were formed during the early 1990s.\n\nIn Rusyn, the town is known as Вербас, in Hungarian as Verbász, in Croatian as Vrbas, in German as Werbass, and in Turkish as Verbas.\n\nHistory\n\nVrbas was mentioned first in 1213 as Orbaszpalota,[citation needed] under the administration of the Kingdom of Hungary. According to other sources, it was mentioned first in 1387.[3] In the 16th century it became a part of the Ottoman Empire. During Ottoman administration it was populated by ethnic Serbs.[4] Since the end of the 17th century, Vrbas was under administration of the Habsburg Monarchy, and, according to 1720 census, it was populated exclusively by Serbs.[5]\n\nAfter 1784 many Germans settled in the town. Before settlement of Germans, the population of the town included about 250 Serb families.[6] Germans founded a new settlement named Novi Vrbas (New Vrbas) near old (Serb) settlement which then became known as Stari Vrbas (Old Vrbas). In 1910, population of Novi Vrbas was mostly composed of ethnic Germans, while population of Stari Vrbas was ethnically mixed and was mainly composed of Serbs and Germans.[7]\n\nIn 1918, Vrbas became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). The town was under Hungarian occupation between 1941 and 1944. As a consequence of the World War II events in Yugoslavia, the German population fled from the town after this war.
