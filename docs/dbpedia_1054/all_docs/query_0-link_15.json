The earthquake was felt in all parts of Serbia. Two persons were killed and about a hundred people were injured. Many houses, towers, schools, medical and cultural institutions were damaged in the earthquake.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence of Serbia will receive 1 million USD in aid, and through the IMET program, dealing with education and training of officers, the ministry can count on additional $ 900,000, said Defense Minister Dragan Sutanovac in Washington.\n\nDefense Minister Dragan Sutanovac with the delegation of MoD participated in the second Security Forum in Halifax, Canada hosted by the Government of Canada and the U.S. German Marshall Fund.\n\nWe have currently some 90 % of professional soldiers in our ranks, which signals that we are approaching the realization of strategic objectives and commitments.

Today, the Military Security Agency is a modern agency trained and ready to respond to modern threats and risks which uses modern mechanisms for collecting data, fully consistent with the highest international standards of human rights.\n\nSix school-fighter planes Galeb G-4 have been taken over from Montenegro adhering to the Agreement on the exchange of resources and documents between the two governments, which was signed on 14 April this year at Batajnica airport by Ministers of Defence of Serbia and Montenegro Dragan Sutanovac and Boro Vucinic respectively.\n\nPhoto-coverage of the exercise \"SAVA 2010\" and \"Jesen 2010\"\n\nHido Biscevic, Secretary General of the Regional Cooperation Council, in an interview to ODBRANA magazine points out that the Council promotes mutual cooperation and European and Euro-Atlantic integrations of the South Eastern Europe with the aim of encouraging development in the region for the benefit of its citizens.

Not sparing their fellow participants, the academics from the region during this four-day seminar argued about the positive and negative aspects and experiences of countries in the Euro-Atlantic integration.\n\nSerbia’s opening to the world and the increasingly more active involvement in the Partnership for Peace, has opened the doors of many countries not only to the professional members of the Ministry of Defense and the Army, but also for future officers, cadets of the Military Academy, which in this way, even while studying, have a chance to look at different systems of military education and the living and working conditions of their counterparts in foreign countries. This time they were on a study tour to the Czech Republic.\n\nHistory seems to have omitted a lesson or two in the story abbot winners and losers.

That the costs of serving the Army in peace and participation in international missions have become too heavy a burden for the British can be seen from a new Strategic Defence Review for the period up to 2015 which stresses cost reduction as its priority.\n\nLazar Ristovski, actor, screenwriter, director and producer, said in an interview to ODBRANA: I am a small man, who is trying to make it big, and at the same time I was a great man, who is seeking to be happy on daily basis as any ordinary man.
