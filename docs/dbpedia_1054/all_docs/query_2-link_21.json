        "text": "Alek is desperate because Teodora has left him after a three-year relationship. Suffering and apathetic, he mentions suicide constantly; he simply does not want to accept that the relationship is over. He has self-pitying sessions with his friend Bane every day. Despite Bane's advice, Alek keeps calling Teodora, who has fallen in love with Nemanja. However decisive and tough Teodora is when she is with Alek, she is indulgent and helpless when she's with Nemanja. Nemanja is not in love with her but with Marina, a girl a few years younger than he is; Marina, in turn, is not in love with him but is very attracted to Alek's \"Slavic depression.\" She doesn't know that his \"desperation charm\" comes from his failure with Teodora; she thinks he was born like that.\n\nThe act of a woman with a broken nose, who suddenly jumps out of a taxi and throws herself off the bridge in Belgrade, connects the lives of three witnesses. The suicide attempt becomes the existential catalyst to the misanthropist taxi-driver Gavrilo who tries to avoid any kind of emotional commitment, the school teacher Anica, stubbornly rejecting the attentions of one of her students, and the wacky pharmacist Biljana, who realizes that the man she's about to marry isn't The One. Each of them bears a wound from the past, a trauma they haven't yet found the courage to face. And it's here on the bridge, linking the old city with New Belgrade, that their road to recovery begins. Interwoven story becomes gently optimistic in its philosophy, yet remains credible throughout, deeply rooted in the reality and human nature.\n\nUros is a distinguished award winning writer, and a former professor, who lives with his wife and son in Belgrade. Uros is plunged in a creative crisis since years and is not able to write a book. His wife, an architect, supports the whole family during this period. Unhappy with this arrangement she seeks solace in an extramarital relationship. When Uros finds out his wife has a lover, he wants to leave home quietly but then he decides to take drastic action to keep the family together.\n\nCar mechanic Zivota, who deals open-heartedly with his customers, goes through many adventures. Some are funny, some are sad, some reveal beauty and others human misery. In the end he gets tangled up himself, and not without bitterness he tries to change his ways, trying to become like his competitor across the street who has adapted to modern times: strictly business. But people who come to him need him just the way he is.\n\nThis dramatic and yet comical story sorrounds a good-hearted young man who wants to get married to a girl he loves but can't get a good job, home of his own, and both of their parents aren't helping the cause either. Story about crushed hopes and dreams of a better life that can hardly happen.\n\nDr. Ilic works in the hospital for compulsory treatment of alcoholics. By conducting his own \"special treatment\" through physical exercises, apple eating, the healing effects of listening to Wagner's music and psychodrama, a group of six patients have been taken to visit the brewery where there is a problem of alcoholism in the workplace. The events that followed reveal that the doctor used his own way of treatment in order to express his own essentially despotic and hypocritical personality.\n\nBosko Pavlovic AKA \"Bole Kalifornija\" (Dragan Bjelogrlic) is a charming con artist in this atmospheric, light and non pretentious piece of movie making. As the narrator, police inspector Gavric (Gordan Kicic) meets with an associate of \"Bole\" at the Belgrade airport named Misa Grof (Zoran Cvijanovic), a story about Bole and his exploits begins to unravel. Bole is a serial con artist, who meets mostly older and will situated women on trains, then tricks them into liking him and disappears as soon as he has had a chance to get some of their money. As the noose around Bole tightens from the police and thugs hired by a well placed brother of a women he scorned, we begin to learn more about his life, motivation and his self perception. In a somewhat predictable turn of fortunes at the end, Bole has to pay the price for his misdoings before he finds his Eldorado. A funny, simple and focused tale that does not pretend to be more than it is, this movie delivers.\n\nOlja is a high-school history teacher married to a painter whose latest exhibition provoked violent reactions from Serbian nationalists. One night, a group of masked hooligans attacks her. They film the attack and upload the clip to YouTube. The next day Olja discovers that some of her students were responsible. She takes away their mobile phones and hastily decides to lock them in the school building, then disconnects the school phones and the Internet. Trapped in the school, students start to communicate with one another to try to solve the problem together. That night, a generation that was written off before they were even given a chance learns more than they expected about themselves and their classmates.\n\nA dark ethnic comedy about a Montenegrin teenager who is sent to Serbia in order to evade a blood-feud caused by his father's reckless behavior. Little does he know that even greater dangers await for him. In Belgrade he will face both the men who want to go after him and this metropolis' very own nightlife and foxy ladies. And in cities like Belgrade - women and nightlife can be deadlier than a bullet.\n\nNikola is a man who knows how to really enjoy life; he's even able to rouse sympathy for his sinful ways. His brother, Braco turns a blind eye to his philandering although, with a broken marriage behind him, he doesn't have a clear conscience, either. Is there anything positive to be said about infidelity, or does it simply deserve the utmost contempt, particularly when it's more premeditated than spontaneous?"
