Fans of the BBC’s lesbian-themed Lip Service mourned Laura Fraser’s sudden departure from the show’s second series, especially since creator Harriet Braun and company disposed of her character Cat in what, for many, felt like an incredibly cynical and sadistic move. But Fraser shippers can rejoice because the Scottish actress, who also played lesbian in the adorable, gastronomically enticing Nina’s Heavenly Delights, has landed a key role on AMC’s critical darling Breaking Bad’s 5th season, Entertainment Weekly reports.

Breaking Bad’s executive producer Vince Gilligan told EW that Fraser will play Lydia, a “former associate of Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) who’s integral to the proceedings of season 5,” as well as someone who is “nervous about her place in the world.”

In addition to her Sapphic roles Fraser has starred in HBO’s historical suffragette flick Iron Jawed Angels as well as Julie Taymor’s controversial Titus.

Breaking Bad season 5 premieres July 15 on AMC.
