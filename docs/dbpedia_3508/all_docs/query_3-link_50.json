        "text": "BREAKING Bad star Laura Fraser is set for a dramatic telly return on new BBC drama series Pact.\n\nThe Scots actress, 45, takes the lead role of Anna in the shock show which follows the aftermath of a young brewery boss being found dead.\n\nGlasgow-born Laura was last seen on the small screen in an episode of Doctor Who at the start of last year.\n\nBut now she’s looking forward to seeing what people think of Pact, which also stars Coronation Street favourite Julie Hesmondhalgh and Ray Donovan actor Eddie Marsan.\n\nLaura, who played Lydia Rodarte-Quayle in the iconic Breaking Bad series, says: \"Anna and her friends from the brewery play a drunken prank on their much-hated boss after a work party.\n\nEmmerdale signs up RuPaul’s Drag Race UK winner The Vivienne for special role\n\n\"This snap decision has horrifying consequences - one moment of poor judgement threatens to ruin the lives of Anna and everyone around her and then facing the aftermath of her drunken behaviour puts her under this extreme pressure as she’s presented with this massive moral dilemma.\n\n\"I play Anna who is about to turn 40. She’s re-evaluating her life, she feels like she’s achieved nothing - she had her kids young and she’s only now getting the confidence to go for a promotion at the brewery where she works with her friends Nancy, Lou and Cat.\"\n\nIn the programme, Anna, Nancy (Julie Hesmondhalgh, Louie (Eiry Thomas) and Cat (Heledd Gwynn) must form a fragile pact of silence, bound by a secret that will change their lives forever.\n\nAnna's police officer husband Max (Jason Hughes) investigates Jack’s (Aneurin Barnard) unexpected death alongside his fierce superior DS Holland (Rakie Ayola) unaware that his own wife and her best friends are at the heart of a conspiracy.\n\nWhile brewery worker Tish (Abbie Hern) becomes increasingly suspicious of her co-workers, Jack's estranged father Arwel (Eddie Marsan) struggles to conceal dark family secrets.\n\nEddie Marsan hopes that viewers find the series as gripping as he did while filming it.\n\nHe adds: \"It’s really gripping. When I read the script, and what I’ve seen from the performances of the cast and the way it’s directed, I think it unravels very slowly and it’s compelling and you can’t wait to find out what happened.\n\n\"It’s fascinating and it’s a fascinating study of a group of women dealing with what happened and trying to deal with it collectively.\"\n\nThe Pact starts on Monday, May 17 at 9pm on BBC One"
