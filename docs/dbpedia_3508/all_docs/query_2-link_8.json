        "text": "Calling all foodies! “Iron Chef” meets lesbian love in this romantic comedy from documentary filmmaker and 1993 Frameline Award recipient Pratibha Parmar (director of past Festival favorites Khush and Jodie: An Icon) in her first narrative feature film. Closeted Nina returns home to Glasgow for her father’s funeral only to discover that her family’s Indian restaurant is in jeopardy. Despite a resentful brother, grieving mother and a younger sister more interested in Scottish dancing than cooking, Nina is determined to save the family business. What better way than by winning the curry cook-off sponsored by the local Indian television station?\n\nLuckily for Nina, she’s convinced her old schoolmate Lisa to help her in her scheme. The two eye each other at the local club, but it’s in the kitchen, grinding spices and chopping chilies, that things really heat up. As the contest approaches, Nina’s entire Scottish-Indian clan rallies behind her, along with her best friend Mohan, who’s preparing for a Bollywood dance competition of his own. But will Nina tell her family that Lisa’s been helping with more than just the cooking? Or will her reluctance to follow her heart sabotage Nina’s quest for curry perfection?\n\nWith musical numbers, benign ghosts and two leading ladies who are easy on the eyes, Nina’s Heavenly Delights is sure to delight anyone who likes their romance with a side of family reconciliation. — MONICA NOLAN"
