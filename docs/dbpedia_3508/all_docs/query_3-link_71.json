        "text": "Popular Scottish actress Laura Fraser (of Breaking Bad, Traces and Crime fame) is to take the lead role in new York-based crime show, Patience.\n\nThe series has begun production in Belgium before moving to the historic English city. It will air in the US on PBS, but no UK channel has been revealed… yet. PBS has close ties with Acorn and others in the UK.\n\nFraser plays Detective Bea Metcalf, who forms an unlikely duo with Purvis’ young autistic police archivist, Patience Evans. Their investigations unfold against the backdrop of the historic city of York.\n\nPatience works in the criminal records department of Yorkshire Police, cataloguing and filing the evidence produced during major cases, and is a brilliant, self-taught criminologist with an instinctive eye for crime scenes and a passion for problem-solving. Metcalf is the first person to spot and utilise Patience’s talent, which opens a door into a whole new world for the archivist.\n\n(Sounds a bit like Astrid to us.)\n\nMore news as we get it."
