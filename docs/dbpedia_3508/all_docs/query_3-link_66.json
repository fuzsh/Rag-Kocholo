        "text": "Cliff said on 13/Aug/13\n\nIn the 1st episode of Breaking Bad's final season, there's a scene at the car wash where Anna Gunn (Skylar) comes up and threatens Laura's character (Lydia). The height difference between the two ladies (both in heels) was pretty extreme - easily 9 inches, as Anna was looking way down at her. Very intimidating. I'll say she's likely 5'1\".\n\nLo sgozzatore said on 15/Jan/13\n\nCould she be just 5'1? She looked so short on Breaking Bad. Dean Norris looked tall in comparison (and she had big heels)"
