        "text": "I wanted to like it, but this new Glasgow-set drama really is weak, with stilted dialogue, underwater acting and some of the most timid, tepid gay kissing ever recorded on screen. Shelley Conn plays Nina, a young south Asian woman who returns to Glasgow for the funeral of her restaurateur father, only to fall in love with Lisa (Laura Fraser), whose own father is controversially going to buy out the place in settlement of a debt. Conn and Fraser do some tentative snogging but they look as if, on the shout of \"Cut!\", they sprang apart and ran away for their respective bottles of Listerine."
