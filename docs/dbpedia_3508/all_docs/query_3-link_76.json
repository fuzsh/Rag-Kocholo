        "text": "\"Breaking Bad\" fans took an immediate interest in ​​Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser) upon her first appearance during Season 5, Episode 2 (\"Madrigal\"). The character is known for her strained behavior, dangerous business relations with Gustavo \"Gus\" Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), and strong appreciation for the sugar substitute Stevia.\n\nEven though Fraser eventually became essential to the AMC series and its spin-off, \"Better Call Saul,\" the actress was not a \"Breaking Bad\" fan before playing the mother of one. During a 2012 Vulture interview, Fraser acknowledged that she did not start consuming episodes until her co-star Jonathan Banks, who played Mike Ehrmantraut, encouraged her to do so while they were filming Season 5. She shared that Banks had implored her to get familiar with the series as she continually asked questions about his character. \"I kept going, 'What have you [Mike] been up to? What's your game?' And he's like, 'Well if you watch the show,'\" recalled Fraser.\n\nThe Scotland native then suggested she believed watching \"Breaking Bad\" would affect her portrayal of the Madrigal Electromotive GmbH executive. \"I was wanting to stay in the world that I was reading from in the script. But after that first episode I went and watched the whole thing, because at that point I was like okay, I'm a part of it. I couldn't resist any longer,\" shared the actress.\n\nIn the \"Vulture\" interview, Laura Fraser spoke about working alongside Jonathan Banks. She revealed that while he does not share his character's hardened personality, she initially felt nervous in his presence. \"I was very scared of him the first day of filming, absolutely terrified of him,\" the actress explained. \"And he was very playful with me and very kind, but because we shoot so fast and I had to concentrate so hard, and because of my nerves on my first day, I was just kind of in character.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Gold Derby, Fraser shared that she did not feel at ease on the \"Breaking Bad\" set upon first being hired. She described the experience as being a late attendee at an incredible event, adding that while she was excited, she felt fearful and somewhat insecure. The \"A Knight's Tale\" star noted that she channeled her genuine anxiety into how she played the character. \"It was great actually to be nervous because I was able to use those nerves for Lydia, one of the most nervous people ever,\" she related."
