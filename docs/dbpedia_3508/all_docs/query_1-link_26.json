        "text": "THIS movie’s heart is in the right place, which is one way of saying it’s terrible.\n\n“Nina’s Heavenly Delights” is an excessively earnest and obvious “heartwarming” story of Nina Shah (Shelley Conn), a London girl returning home to Glasgow upon her father’s death.\n\nHe taught her how to cook and won awards for serving some of the best Indian food in Britain, so even as the family restaurant is about to be sold, she rolls up her sleeves, reaches for the coriander and prepares to honor her dad’s memory by winning another award for his famous curry.\n\nAlong the way, she falls in love and gossips with a transvestite friend as the script dishes out some of the blandest dialogue (“I’ve never felt this before,” “Go with your heart”) ever uttered. The food sure looks good, though.\n\nRunning time: 96 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexual situations). At the Quad, 13th Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues."
