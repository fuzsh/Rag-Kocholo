Nina Shah (Shelley Conn) is a feisty young Indo-Scottish woman with an identity crisis, who left home under a cloud after a row with her father. When her father dies unexpectedly, Nina is forced to return home to run the family-owned curry house, The New Taj. This reunites her with her childhood friend Bobbi (Ronny Jhutti), a Bollywood drag queen, and brings her face-to-face with Lisa (Laura Fraser), a charismatic young woman who now owns half of the restaurant. Nina embarks on a personal mission to win back the family business and to fulfil her father’s secret wish of winning the ‘Best of the West’ curry competition. But Nina’s feelings are thrown into turmoil when she realises she is falling in love with Lisa. Can she win both prizes?"
