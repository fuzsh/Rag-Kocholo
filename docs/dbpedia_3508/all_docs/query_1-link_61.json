When her father dies suddenly, Nina is forced to return and run the family owned Curry House. This reunites her with her childhood friend Bobbi, a Bollywood drag queen and brings her face to face with Lisa, a charismatic young woman to whom Nina's father sold 50% of the restaurant. \r\n\r\nNina embarks on a personal mission to win the ‘Best of the West’ curry competition, a highly coveted prize in the world of Indian cuisine. But Nina’s feelings are thrown into turmoil when she realises that she is falling in love......with Lisa! Can she win both prizes?\r\n\r\n\"Parmar's film is light and sweet, comfort food dressed up with a dash of exotic spice.\"-Maitland McDonagh, Time Out",
