        "text": "Laura Fraser arrives at a restaurant in her home town of Glasgow in a sweaty, apologetic heap. She has no need to be sorry – she is barely one minute late. ‘I am sweating like an absolute beast,’ she says, flapping a worn black T-shirt theatrically. ‘It is ridiculous: I can’t run any more. I ran from my house – which is, realistically, a 22-minute walk away – and made it in 11 minutes. I’m such a latecomer, it is terrible. I’m really trying to fix it.’\n\nShe looks up from discarding a king-sized black quilted coat and beams. Casually dressed in black leggings and flat brown boots, Laura has none of the airs that you might expect from a Bafta-nominated actress whose career has spanned more than two decades and whose film co-stars have included Leonardo DiCaprio (The Man in the Iron Mask), Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky), Anjelica Huston (Iron Jawed Angels), Sir Anthony Hopkins (Titus) and the late Heath Ledger (A Knight’s Tale).\n\nFans of Breaking Bad will remember her brilliant performance as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, the highly strung black marketeer who meets an untimely end via a poisoned cup of tea. Before settling down, Laura has a couple more apologies to make.\n\nOne is for the state of her hair, which has been tidied in a bun beneath a tweed flat cap. Another is for her nails, painted pillar-box red. ‘They are so blunt,’ she admonishes herself. ‘I never wear this colour. I was doing nails with my daughter.’ (Married to the Dublin-born actor Karl Geary, she has a 10-year-old, Lila).\n\nWe are here to discuss her part in BBC One’s addictive miniseries The Missing, which reaches its finale on Wednesday. Previously, viewers have witnessed a highly emotional, horror-filled plot, based on the grisly fallout from a child’s abduction.\n\nIn this, the second series, a new cast has been gathered, and the story centres on three missing children. Six million tuned into the first episode – a million more than the average audience for the first series – to watch Laura play Eve Stone, a sergeant in the Royal Military Police, tasked with investigating the disappearance of schoolgirl Alice Webster.\n\nSo far, Eve has had an affair with Webster’s father, given birth to her own sister’s baby as a surrogate and learned that her father, a brigadier with dementia, could be implicated in the disappearances. Her performance is compellingly understated, as she navigates the role of an emotionally closed, slowly disintegrating woman.\n\nLaura feels she’s quite the opposite of Stone – whose sharing of a name with an inanimate object is, she suggests, no coincidence. ‘I am someone who likes to talk about every emotion I have, every moment I am having it,’ she says in a strong and lightning-quick Glaswegian brogue.\n\nAs with the furore that surrounded Breaking Bad, she is getting used to fans stopping her in the street to ask how it ends. ‘With Breaking Bad, it took six months to a year for people to come up to me. This time, it’s the next day or two days later. People come up, which is…’ – she pauses – ‘…OK. It is positive. Most people just say they are addicted and it’s really grisly but they are loving it. It is so dark.’\n\nFurther darkness was provided by the filming, much of which took place in Germany’s Vogelsang military training centre, in old Nazi buildings – a setting she found ‘disturbing’ and unnervingly ‘ornate and grand’. ‘Maybe I am putting that on to it because of the thoughts and actions of what went on in there. It added another layer.’\n\nThis second series hit our screens just a month after the final episode of the BBC four-parter One of Us, an absorbing Highlands-set whodunnit by The Missing’s writers, brothers Harry and Jack Williams. In it, Laura played a detective, Juliet.\n\nAnd she’s just finished filming ITV’s forthcoming six-part serial-killer drama Loch Ness, in which she plays yet another police officer – this time one from a small town, grappling with her first murder case. Do casting agents think she’s in the wrong profession? ‘I am starting to think I would be a really good detective,’ she laughs.\n\nThe Missing has established what some have suspected for a while: that the 40-year-old is on a bit of a roll. In the three years since Breaking Bad wrapped, she has developed a knack for choosing, if not leading parts, projects that become box-set gold. Some call it the Breaking Bad effect.\n\nCertainly, after the high-profile films of her early 20s, before her casting in that hit, Laura was lost in a wilderness of forgettable TV shows and minor movies. She married in 2003, had her daughter and, on her agent’s advice, moved to New York in 2011, to try to break into US TV.\n\n‘I was really excited to get [Breaking Bad] because I hadn’t worked for about a year,’ she says. ‘I was just getting rejected. I was doing the rounds of casting directors. It felt like starting again, except I wasn’t 20. I was getting really downhearted. It was mostly going to offices and going on tape, and seeing lots of people – younger, thinner versions of yourself – in the corridors and being like, “Oh, Jesus.”’\n\nHer casting as professional ball-breaker Lydia came at exactly the right moment. Laura joined Breaking Bad for the last of its five seasons (broadcast in two halves, in 2012 and 2013) and won critical acclaim for her visceral performance. Many thought she was one of the best things in the show, and she shared a gong for ‘outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series’ at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2014.\n\nHowever, it nearly didn’t happen. Not long before Laura sent off her audition tape for Lydia, she had been given the part of Jessica Brody, the wife of Damian Lewis’s character, in the pilot for Homeland. The day after it was commissioned as a series, Laura received a call to say she’d been dropped.\n\nShe was later replaced by the Brazilian actress Morena Baccarin, who co-creator Alex Gansa described as ‘more vibrant, more sexual’. It was, understandably, a tough pill to swallow. ‘With most pilots, somebody gets kicked out,’ she admits, ‘but it’s not very common in the UK. I had never heard of it and took it totally personally, not realising it is usually an internal political thing.\n\n'At the time, you just feel like such an arse. It’s so public and I felt humiliated. I put a brave face on but cried for about a week. It was so embarrassing. Now I am so glad it happened because it definitely made me work harder and realise I was much stronger than I thought it was.’\n\nHer subsequent castings vindicated her decision to stay in the profession and meant she has learned to savour success. ‘At the moment, I’m getting offers and don’t have to do auditions. So I’m loving it. I know it is a luxurious position to be in.’\n\nBorn and bred in Glasgow, she grew up with two brothers and one sister. Her father, Alister, had a building company and her mother, Rose, is a former nurse. She knew from a young age that she was destined for acting. ‘I think it was a way to have an outlet for feelings and emotions, and explore them legitimately,’ she says. ‘I don’t know whether it is a Scottish thing, but you don’t really discuss feelings.’\n\nShe acted at her local youth club and attended Glasgow’s Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire), before landing a first big role at 19: she played a young Glaswegian girl who gets embroiled with a gang in 1996’s Small Faces, alongside future Grey’s Anatomy star Kevin McKidd.\n\nFollowing the Bafta-nominated film’s success, Fraser moved to London and continued working, appearing in Stephen Poliakoff’s headline-baiting The Tribe (1998) with Joely Richardson and Anna Friel. She and Friel became best friends and moved into a flat together. But Laura started partying ‘ridiculously’ hard.\n\nIn the past, she has spoken openly about taking drugs and the alcohol-fuelled lifestyle that enveloped her. Was there a moment when she realised she needed to rein herself in? ‘For me, it wasn’t a choice. I was very remote from myself. I wasn’t connected at all to what was really going on.\n\n‘I would be partying, partying, partying and then sort of vaguely touch on the sense that I was not actually very happy. And a wee bit lonely. When you are partying too hard, it is usually because something is wrong.’ She says her marriage to bar owner and actor Geary in 2003 helped her find equilibrium, which she has maintained since.\n\nWhen not acting, Laura lives for yoga and hiking. ‘I am a daytime person. It feels boring to say but it doesn’t feel boring in my life. I feel really invigorated.’ She talks proudly of how, next year, Geary will publish his first book, Montpelier Parade, about a young boy’s struggles in Dublin.\n\nAs the mother of a 10-year-old girl, she also feels passionately about body image. Of her time in America, she recalls, ‘Sometimes, when I was doing audition tapes, I was asked to do the tape again – not for performance, but just to wear more make-up or different clothes.\n\nOne time, for an American TV job, they asked me if I would come into the office to meet the producers and wear clothes like I wore in Breaking Bad, i.e. skirts, suits and heels. I was like, “No, if you want to f—ing see me in those clothes, watch Breaking Bad. I’m not going to come into your office and parade around like a f—ing moron.”’\n\nShe apologises for the outburst and the expletives. ‘It makes me so angry. I said no and got the job anyway. I feel like, for God’s sake, would they ask the same of a guy?\n\n‘Now I’ve let go of the weight thing,’ she continues. ‘It was a really big deal in my 20s, and not so much in my 30s. But now, when I get that old conditioned thing before a job, thinking, “You better lose a few pounds,” I am like, “You better not lose a few pounds. That is the weight you are. You are perfectly healthy. Your BMI is good and you are happy.”’\n\nHer decision to return to Scotland in May last year was born of a reluctance to send her daughter to be privately educated in the US. Lila’s school in upstate New York was closing, owing to lack of funding, and the alternative ‘looked like a prison’.\n\n‘I don’t really agree with sending a kid to private school,’ she explains. ‘I think it is unfair. I would rather try to help the school that she’s in provide a nice education for all the kids in the area, rather than going, “Oh, my daughter will be OK – but I don’t know what you guys are going to do.”’\n\nBefore she leaves, I try once more to elicit information about The Missing. Where might schoolgirl Alice Webster turn up – or will she even turn up at all? For a moment, Laura looks as though she is going to relent, until a shout comes from a table across the room: ‘Don’t tell her! We know who you are. We watch it too!’ Laura covers her mouth and shakes with laughter. ‘Thank God I didn’t say,’ she exclaims – saving herself, like all great detectives, in the nick of time."
