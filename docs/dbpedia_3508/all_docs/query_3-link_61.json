        "text": "Laura Fraser of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul will be starring in a new Channel 4 drama.\n\n6-part police crime drama, Patience, also features Ella Maisy Purvis (Kind of Spark, Malpractice).\n\nFilming has just wrapped up in York, where Patience Evans (Purvis) works in the criminal records department of Yorkshire Police, cataloguing and filing the evidence produced during major cases.\n\nAs a young autistic woman, âshe craves routine and order, relishing the solitude and structure her job provides but she yearns for more.â\n\nDetective Bea Metcalf (Laura Fraser) is the first person to spot and utilise her talent, which opens a door into a whole new world for her.\n\nPatience attends a regular support group for autistic adults where they discuss the barriers in operating in a neuro-typical world and how best to navigate it. All neuro-divergent characters within the series are played by neuro-diverse actors, including the title role of Patience.\n\nâI’m incredibly honoured to bring Patience Evans to life in this ground-breaking drama,â said Purvis.\n\nâAudiences can look forward to an authentic representation of a young autistic woman that is written with nuance and detail, but also that challenges the norms of the neuro-typical world. Patience is a character full of depth, intelligence, and an unwavering passion for justice, and I can’t wait for viewers to join her on this thrilling journey.â\n\nLaura Fraser added:\n\nâPatience is full of intriguing mysteries and unusual crimes, but also looks at detective Bea Metcalf’s working relationship with a young woman who experiences life in a different way to her own, and also the friendship that develops between them.â\n\nPatience is adapted from the original hit French series Astrid and Raphaelle and is a co-production of JLA Productions. The series will be distributed worldwide by Beta Film and is being produced in association with Happy Duck Films. It is also supported by the Belgian Tax Shelter.\n\nIt was acquired for Channel 4 by Polly Scates, Head of Acquisitions, and is directed by Maarten Moerkerke (13 Commandments).\n\nMatt Baker (Hotel Portofino, Professor T, Suspect) heads up the writing team and is joined by Stephen Brady (Professor T), Sarah Freethy (The Porcelain Maker) and Daniella DeVinter (Before We Die S2), all of whom have personal experience relating to autism. Jo McGrath and Walter Iuzzolino executive produce for Eagle Eye Drama.\n\nâWe are proud to be making a mainstream crime series built around an exceptional neurodivergent protagonist called Patience,â said Jo McGrath, Chief Creative Officer, Eagle Eye Drama.\n\nâThe character is beautifully brought to life by Ella Maisy Purvis a compelling young actress who will captivate audiences. Weâre delighted to be working with Channel 4, a broadcaster whose championing of diversity in all its forms has always been at the very heart of its DNA.â\n\nFilming has taken place in York and Belgium and transmission details have yet to be confirmed."
