        "text": "Art Malik is an actor with over three decades of experience, equally comfortable on\n\nscreen as he is on stage. He began his acting career at the Guildhall School of Music\n\nand Drama and quickly went on to work at the RSC and the Old Vic Theatre Company.\n\nIn 1982 Malik acted in the multi award winning drama series The Jewel In The Crown, where he was nominated for a Bafta in his role as Hari Kumar. This role\n\nsecured him a position in the Academy and David Lean’s Bafta/Oscar winning A\n\nPassage To India (1986).\n\nMalik’s film credits include many blockbuster studio films such as the James Bond film\n\nThe Living Daylights, Wolfman, John Carter, Sex In The City 2 and starring\n\nwith Arnold Schwarzenegger in James Cameron’s True Lies. It was a global success\n\nas well as being the most expensive film of all time.\n\nThroughout his career, he has always shown a huge fondness for supporting\n\nindependent films, particularly in Britain, and has appeared in many including A\n\nClockwork Mice (1985), Fakers (2004), Dean Spanley (2008), Franklyn (2008), Nina’s Heavenly Delights (2006), Everywhere And Nowhere (2011)\n\nand Ghosted (2011).\n\nHe has had many appearances on the West End, from Tom Stoppard’s Indian Ink at\n\nthe Aldwych (which also had a US stint at ACT in San Francisco) to Art at the Wyndham\n\nand recently the critically acclaimed, award winning Royal Court Theatre’s production of\n\nThe Seagull which successfully transferred to Broadway (2008).\n\nBoasting over 100 credits across his career, Malik has also starred in many TV dramas\n\nincluding the classic Jackanory series (1993/2005), The Far Pavillions (1984),\n\nHarem (1986), Stolen (1990), Messiah (2001), Ben Hur (2010), The Nativity (2010), Poirot (2010) and Upstairs Downstairs (2011).\n\nHis last stage appearance was at the Edinburgh Festival in 2011 in a newly\n\ncommissioned play Rose. This turned out to be somewhat of a family affair with his\n\ndaughters; acting with Keira, while Jessica produced this well received two hander.\n\nIn 2011 he was Executive Producer on Ghosted, a critically acclaimed low budget\n\nbritish prison drama, which went on to win a Best Director award for Craig Viveiros at the\n\nNew York Film Festival (2012).\n\nThis year saw his long awaited Bollywood debut in the bio-pic, Baagh Milka Baagh, currently doing extraordinary business in India and globally."
