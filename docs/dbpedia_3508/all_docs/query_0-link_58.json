An expansion of this format has been used (unacknowledged or in ignorance) by the makers of the animated movie Hoodwinked, an extremely funny treatment of the 'Little Red Riding Hood' story as a combined police procedural movie and private eye whodunit.\n\nThe Wolf, Granny, the Woodsman and Red Riding Hood are arrested in Granny's woodland house and under interrogation by suave frog gumshoe Nicky Flippers (i.e. Nick Charles) and thick bear cop Chief Grizzly, they provide Rashomon-like explanations for their presence there. There's no attempt to match the magical, deconstructive subtleties of the Neil Jordan-Angela Carter The Company of Wolves, but the film is a lovely entertainment, full of verbal and visual wit. Its 81 minutes whizz by.\n\nThe week's other welcome surprise is Lu Chuan's The Mountain Patrol, a Chinese ecological adventure in the manner of those stories about ivory poachers in Africa, buffalo hunters in North America and Nicholas Ray's Wind Across the Everglades, in which Audubon Society agent Christopher Plummer pursued rare-bird thief Burl Ives. Here, in the Nineties, a photojournalist from Beijing comes to the Tibetan plain of Kekexili at the roof of the world to write about a local team of amateur conservationists who do relentless battle with poachers. These predators use automatic weapons to slaughter rare antelopes for their valuable pelts.\n\nIt's a compelling story of dedicated men, under the leadership of the charismatic Ri Tai, who endure appalling weather and risk their lives to save this endangered species. The setting is awesome in its majestic bleakness and there are unforgettable images and incidents (a patrolman sinking into quicksand, for instance), though the narrative gets a little ragged towards the end. The film concludes with the news (good, if true) that Kekexili is now an official nature reserve and the Tibetan antelope thrives again.\n\nThe Mountain Patrol is a work of art. Zidane: A 21st-Century Portrait is an art work, which is to say it's a self-conscious piece by a two video installation artists, Paris-based Philippe Parreno and Scotsman Douglas Gordon. Throughout a 2004 match between Real Madrid and Villarreal, they focused 17 super-35mm cameras on the home side's star midfield player, Zinedine Zidane. We see him in close-up and long shot; take in a lot of his shirt ('Zidane 5' on the back, 'Siemens Mobile' on the front) and his boots (enough to satisfy the most desperate foot fetishist); watch him spit, sweat, gesture, shout, pull up his socks, smile (twice), laugh at an unexplained joke (once), show some brilliant ball control; set up a goal (though the directors have to cut in a TV clip to show Ronaldo scoring it); and finally witness him joining a fight and getting a red card.\n\nAlong the way, there are subtitles quoting Zidane on his craft in terms not entirely unlike the gnomic reflections of his fellow Frenchman, Eric Cantona. It's hypnotic, self-indulgent and lacking in context, rather like doting parents at a nativity play concentrating on their daughter's Mary or their son's Joseph to the exclusion of the other performers and the Gospel message. But you do want to talk about it afterwards.\n\nThe week has brought two other oddities from Europe. Written, directed and edited by maverick German film-maker Fred Kelemen, Krisana (Fallen), is a sort of detective story made in severe monochrome, in which a lonely clerk in the Latvian state archives investigates the life of a woman he has seen throw herself from a bridge at night. With long takes and calculated longueurs, it becomes a homage to Antonioni's Blow-Up in a less-than-swinging Riga, where the national suicide rate is an unsurprising 700 a year.\n\nI would guess that Kelemen is a devotee of the slow, lugubrious black-and-white films of cult Hungarian director Bela Tarr, who has acted as producer on Johanna, an original movie opera directed by 30-year-old Kornel Mundruczo. This updates the story of Joan of Arc, spiced with a dash of Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves. The setting is an oppressive underground hospital where Johanna, a recovering drug addict, is taken on as a nurse. She develops miraculous healing powers that involve her having sex with the patients, which naturally makes her a big hit in the male geriatric ward.\n\nEqually naturally, this gets up the stethoscopes of the medical staff, whom we're supposed to hate for their lack of faith and imagination, in the way we're brought up to despise the clerics who tormented St Joan. An audacious failure.\n\nClick is the latest in a string of comedies descending from A Christmas Carol in which people change their lives after glimpsing their dismal futures. In this case, Adam Sandler, at his least lovable, plays a workaholic New York architect who neglects his family. A mysterious inventor played by Christopher Walken and called Morty (i.e. death) gives him a magic remote control that enables him to visit his past and future and to telescope time. There are more farts and embarrassing sex jokes than laughs - far more.\n\nThe other three films are low-budget, cliched stories set in ethnic communities. The most bearable is Echo Park L.A. in which a 14-year-old Mexican-American girl is banished by her religious father when she becomes miraculously pregnant, as she's apparently still a virgin. She moves in with an understanding old uncle and a gay cousin and eventually they all forgive and go on living and loving.\n\nLife and Lyrics and Nina's Heavenly Delights are set respectively in London's black community and Glasgow's Indian community and turn on desperately fought competitions. In the deadly serious Life and Lyrics, everything leads to a south London rap contest and involves the usual ingredients of current black cinema - guns, bling, dreams of musical careers, a hypergamous affair between a bitter, uneducated guy and an upwardly mobile woman, vicious loan sharks, a climactic killing etc. The one humorous moment occurs when a thick rapper (white) confuses Cameron Diaz with carpe diem.\n\nIn the sentimental foodie comedy Nina's Heavenly Delights, feisty young Indian heroine Nina Shah, who fled to London from an arranged marriage, returns to Glasgow for the funeral of her beloved father. Trying to hang on to the Taj Mahal, the family's debt-ridden restaurant, she enters the televised Best of the West curry competition, her chief rival being the posher Jewel in the Crown eaterie owned by smooth Art Malik.\n\nAlong the way, she slides into a lesbian affair with a beautiful Scots girl and fellow cook. (The film might well have been called 'My Beautiful Balti House'.) But should they make their love public? Nina's dad had told her that in life as in the kitchen, 'you must always follow your heart', and she's shown the way by her brother, her gay confidant, her sister and her mother who suddenly and happily confess to secret loves and clandestine activities. Not since the last major amnesty in Ulster have so many people come out at the same time."
