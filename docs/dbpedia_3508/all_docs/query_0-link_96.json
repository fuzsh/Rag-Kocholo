        "text": "Shinji Ushiro’s hectic anime ‘Strait Jacket’ takes a premise that requires a suspension of disbelief plus VAT, welds it to a hefty chunk of mythology and tries to make the whole thing fly with a script that’s this close to having its certificate of airworthiness rescinded.\n\nFirst things first: the set-up. In an alternative history, an experiment harnesses the power of “mythical magic” (as opposed to what other type?) and brings it into the real world. As a consequence, controlled usage of magic in military, industrial and scientific areas renders the world of 1899 technologically and socially advanced. Cars are commonplace; weaponry is as high-tech as one would expect in the kind of anime where lots of things get blown up; and the standard of living is generally high. Except, of course, for the poor bastards who are in the wrong place at the wrong time when the shit-blowing-up shit goes down. (I’ve got to stop using phrases like that; it’s no wonder I’m not getting that ‘Culture Show’ gig.)\n\nThere’s a flipside to magic, though. Uncontrolled applications of it result in the creation of demons. To combat them, the government deploys a counter-terrorismdemonism unit called Black Dog. (Whether or not it’s been a long time since they rock and rolled is something the script leaves unexplored.) Black Dog consists of “tactical sorcerists” (yup, that’s what the film calls them and I can assure you that I was totally unable to type “tactical sorcerists” without sniggering) who use strong magic against the demons. To protect themselves from the negative aspects of the magic, they wear protective suits – the strait jackets of the title – which make them look a bit like Iron Man but without the glossy red paint job.\n\nThe exposition of all this rigmarole accounts for more of scant 76-minute running time than is entirely necessary. And that’s before you even take into account the red-herring subplot about a group of insurgents.\n\nIdealistic young operative Nerin Simmonds reluctantly enlists the help of unlicensed tactical sorcerist (nope, still unable to type it with a straight face) Rayotte Steinberg when a particularly nasty demon starts laying waste to a hospital and Black Dog are otherwise engaged. Steinberg’s methods are notoriously destructive to the point of suicidal. He travels with a young witch, Kapel Theta (the script doesn’t make it clear if this is her actual name or just the sorority she belongs to) who holds a grudge against him for the death of her parents.\n\nIsaac Hammond, the clean-cut square-jawed poster boy for Black Dog, also has reason to hate Steinberg. And Steinberg himself, all moody angst and brooding silences, is seeking redemption through death for a guilty act he has been carrying around for over a decade.\n\nPhew! All dramatic stuff, right?\n\nThe essential problem with ‘Strait Jacket’ is that it plays like an origin story (how Kapel Theta meets Steinberg; how Nerin meets Steinberg; and why Steinberg’s a miserable bastard) and all but avoids the main narrative thrust of Hammond’s discovery of corruption in high places and Hammond and Steinberg’s inevitable stand-off in its haste to throw Steinberg, Kapel Theta and Nerin together, presumably with the intent of sending them off on myriad thrilling and exotic adventures.\n\nI say presumably, because the end credits roll at this point.\n\nThere are other, minor, niggles – such as the lack of specificity vis-à-vis the film’s setting (the backgrounds suggest Victorian London, names like Schumann and Ottoman hint at Germany or Austria, and the cars and the banter between Black Dog squad members come across as distinctly American) – but in the main ‘Strait Jacket’ frustrates purely because it seems like an extended overture, only for the orchestra to pack up their instruments and go home, leaving the audience sitting there perplexed, wondering what happened to the actual opera. Moreover, the point of view flips around without ever fully deciding on who the main character is. It seems like Nerin to begin with; however, she’s sidelined whenever Steinberg does his thing. Then the focus shifts pretty heavily to Hammond in the last third.\n\n‘Strait Jacket’ also frustrates because there’s a sense of squandered potential. Steinberg and Phi Beta Kappa Kapel Theta’s relationship crackles with tension; Nerin has the makings of a headstrong heroine yet the script never gives her her moment of glory; the conspiracy element is abandoned almost arbitrarily without Hammond resolving whether he’s uncovered the full extent (is there an even more sinister eminence grice lurking in the background?); and potentially interesting supporting characters such as seemingly retired tactical sorcerist (damn it; sniggered again!) Filisis Moog are never developed. (And when you’ve got a character called Filisis freakin’ Moog, it ought to be a legal requirement that you give them something interesting to do.)\n\nIf anyone knows whether ‘Strait Jacket’ has any sequel, or was developed as a multi-episode manga, please do the comments box thing and let me know. As mildly disappointed as it left me, ‘Strait Jacket’ painted a world I’d like to revisit.\n\nAfter the angst-ridden lesbian coming of age drama ‘Lost and Delirious’, reviewed yesterday, here’s a lesbian drama that’s virtually angst free. In fact it’s closer in tone to a rom-com than a drama. And there are no coming of age heartaches either. There is, however, a cookery competition.\n\nFollowing her father’s death, Scottish-Asian Nina (Shelley Conn) returns to her native Glasgow after fleeing from an arranged marriage three years previously. She discovers her mother pining for an old flame, her siblings guarding secrets they’re convinced said matriarch will disapprove of, and the family-owned restaurant under threat from rival chef Raj (Art Malik). Resistant to her family’s initial antagonism and determined to keep her father’s spirit alive, Nina teams up with her brother’s is-she-isn’t-she girlfriend Lisa (Laura Fraser) to reopen the business and enter a culinary competition that could save them from Raj’s take-over. Although romance is the last thing on Nina’s mind, the chemistry between her and Lisa is too strong to ignore.\n\nI made the mistake of watching ‘Nina’s Heavenly Delights’ two days before payday, with just £1.13 in the bank and not a chance in hell of getting a takeaway let alone trolling up to a restaurant, casing out the menu and ordering the works. I sat through 91 minutes of pure feelgood fuzziness, DoP Simon Dennis framing the food as gorgeously as he frames the smouldering looks between the never-beaten-with-the-ugly-stick leads, with my stomach rumbling and my saliva glands working overtime.\n\nAs a food film, I’d put ‘Nina’s Heavenly Delights’ up there with ‘Ratatouille’ and ‘Big Night’, both of which necessitated me going directly from the cinema to a restaurant. (Unlike ‘La Grande Bouffe’ and ‘The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover’, both of which rendered me a poster boy for Weight Watchers for several days afterwards.)\n\nAs a romantic drama, it’s not as overpoweringly passionate as ‘Desert Hearts’ or as quirkily entertaining as ‘Better than Chocolate’. Its more humorous elements lack the self-aware smarts of ‘Kissing Jessica Stein’. And yet, for all its hokeyness, Pratibha Parmar’s film is as lovingly created as its heroine’s cuisine.\n\nOn paper, it comes across a lesbian romance with a foodie subplot; in actuality, the cookery competition is the narrative be-all-and-end-all, with Nina and Lisa’s falling in love simmering away (pardon the pun) in the background. This actually turns out to be the film’s strong point. With Nina and Lisa ostensibly straight at the outset and facing up not only to their feelings but their sexuality, the potential for angst and/or navel-gazing could have been significant. Parmar, however, focuses on the competition/underdog aspect (‘Nina’s Heavenly Delights’ probably has more in common with ‘Rocky’ than ‘Desert Hearts’) and lets things develop organically between Nina and Lisa.\n\nConn and Fraser are eminently likeable and convincing in the lead roles. The supporting cast nail it, with a “man of the match” award going to Ronny Jhutti as Nina’s camp best mate Bobbi, leader of a transvestite dance troupe. The finale is as predictable as a join-the-dots puzzle, but no less enjoyable for all that. To further the obvious analogy, ‘Nina’s Heavenly Delights’ is a modest little film – more an entrée than a banquet – but it’s a delicious treat.\n\nPosted to coincide with Mischa Barton’s 25th birthday.\n\nIn an ideal world, ‘Lost and Delirious’ would have been made in the ’50s, shot in sumptuous and utterly artifical Technicolor and been directed by Douglas Sirk. It would have been implicit but bubbling with repression. It would have starred twenty-something actresses in pigtails passing themselves off as teenagers. There wouldn’t have been a softcore sex scene of the Zalman King school. It would have been 100 minutes of gorgeous, borderline hilarious melodrama.\n\nAs it is, though, ‘Lost and Delirious’ was made in 2004, filmed in an autumnal palette and directed by Leà Pool. The only implicit thing about it is what actual purpose the supposedly main character serves. It stars Piper Perabo, Jessica Paré and Mischa Barton (summat about their ages). And there’s a softcore sex scene between two of the leads that’s all close ups of breasts and thighs and intertwined legs. I mention this to point up the comparison; any increase in my blog traffic is purely coincidental.\n\nThe first scene has our heroine and intermittent narrator Mary (Barton) driven to a boarding school by her emotionally distant father and his emotionally not-there-at-all new wife. Mary is depressed at the prospect of living away from home and by her inability, on occasions, to remember her late mother’s face. At the boarding school – which seems to be stuck in a ’50s time-warp with its perky gels and matronly staff members (if someone had said “good-o” or “jolly hockey sticks”, I wouldn’t have been surprised) – Mary finds herself sharing a room with the popular Victoria (Paré) and rebellious free spirit Paulie (Perabo).\n\nA lot of time is spent on Mary finding her feet, bonding with her new friends, having her mind and emotions piqued by education (for the first twenty minutes or so, I was convinced I was watching a mash-up of ‘Mr Holland’s Opus’ and ‘Desert Hearts’ – and wondered when they were going to get cracking with the good bits from ‘Desert Hearts’) and forming a tentative friendship with avuncular gardener Joe (Graham Greene), whose horticultural talents remind Mary of her mother and who becomes an ersatz parental figure, imparting wise homilies and yada yada yada.\n\nThen the filmmakers remember that this is a lesbian coming of age drama and throw in a softcore sex scene of the Zalman King school to demonstrate that Victoria and Paulie are more than just room-mates. They also like to make out in voluptuous close up. (To anyone arriving at this site having Googled “lesbian coming of age drama”, “intertwined legs” or “make out in voluptuous close up”: welcome. I post film reviews. There are sometimes screengrabs of a salacious nature. Like the one below.)\n\nSo: the coming-of-age/Mary’s enlightenment plot strand segues without so much as a by-your-leave into a romantic drama in which Victoria and Paulie’s relationship plays out against Victoria’s struggle with the social and academic requirements her nouveau riche family have placed upon her – a set of circumstances alien to the couldn’t-care-less Paulie. But before this aspect of the film can develop, Victoria’s prissy younger sister discovers them together and Victoria, fearing pariah-hood at school and worse from her parents, not only backs off from Paulie but makes a pretence at a torrid relationship with a boy from a neighbouring school, talking up her avowedly heterosexual exploits in front of the other girls as a face-saving exercise.\n\nThere’s an incredibly powerful scene – in fact, the last poignant scene the film offers before it hares off into melodrama – where Victoria tries to keep it together while she strives to convince her sister that there’s nothing between her and Paulie. After several excruciating minutes, her sister buys it and promises to smooth everything over with her friends (effectively quelling any nascent rumour-mongering), at which point Victoria turns and walks away, her face crumpling, tears springing to her eyes.\n\nThe tragedy is that Paulie never witnesses this. All Paulie knows is that Victoria suddenly drops her like the proverbial hot potato. As a forty minute short and the end credits rolling after this scene, ‘Lost and Delirious’ would have made an understated but devastatingly effective point about social convention, familial expectation and petty bigotry and how all of these things are just so much bullshit. Unfortunately, the film continues for another hour , painting Victoria as the villain, Paulie as the victim and Mary as the poor dumb schmuck caught inbetween.\n\nAnd for a short while, it seems like even this turn of events might be effective. Victoria confides in Mary and counsels her that Paulie will need her support to carry on. Paulie, however, takes Victoria’s rejection as a call to arms and is prepared to go any distance to get her back, calling upon Mary to assist her. Okay, I was thinking at this point, so we’re into ‘The Go-Between’ territory, but with a Sapphic twist. Fair enough.\n\nExcept that ‘Lost and Delirious’ then becomes a study in Paulie’s mental instability as her behaviour grows increasingly unpredictable and self-destructive. Come the last reel, we’ve been treated to not just one but two squirmily embarrassing scenes of Paulie publicly declaring her affections and this is before we’ve even got to the SPOILER ALERT duel/immediate aftermath SPOILERS END.\n\nWhich is where we came in. ‘Lost and Delirious’ plunges into such hyper-emotional realms that it demands the Douglas Sirk treatment. Pool, however, shoots the whole thing in such low-key fashion that the narrative developments of the last third come across as risible and unconvincing. A subplot involving Paulie’s nursing back to health of an injured raptor provides a metaphor so bluntly hammered home as to be rendered facile.\n\nSo why am I writing about ‘Lost and Delirious’? Why have I expended almost 1,000 words on it already? Two reasons: (i) even in today’s post-‘Brokeback Mountain’ era, films with an LGBT focus are still relegated to the arthouse circuit, therefore even a flawed or moderately successful example is worth shouting about; and (ii) the leads acquit themselves very well.\n\nParé excels despite the script painting her as a bitch plus VAT for the latter stages of the film. Perabo, who is incrementally establishing herself as a damn good actress despite having ‘Coyote Ugly’ on her CV, gives it her all as the live-for-the-now outsider. Barton’s role is utterly thankless – ‘Lost and Delirious’ was adapted from a novel but without the realisation that an entirely passive narrator, though a highly effective literary device, is a bad move cinematically – and yet she aces it, capturing every nuance of Mary’s confusion, frustration (let’s face it, her peregrinations between Paulie and Victoria are a no-win situation) and basic humanity.\n\nParé and Perabo, then, get the showy roles. But it’s Mischa Barton who ties the whole thing together.\n\nThe ‘Ginger Snaps’ sequel and prequel were apparently filmed back to back, albeit from scripts by different writers and with different directors at the helm. I’m not sure at which point during pre-production someone said, “Hey, let’s make ‘Unleashed’ a gritty, institutional movie and ‘Ginger Snaps Back’ a costume drama,” but I wish I’d been a fly on the wall. I’d love to know how that idea got sold.\n\n‘Ginger Snaps Back’ is a prequel in the way that Neal Stephenson’s ‘System of the World’ trilogy is a prequel to ‘Cryptonomicon’. There’s a thematic connection, but the two works are set centuries apart.\n\nIt’s some time in the 19th century and a depleted retinue of traders and British troops, along with their native Indian guide, are holed up in a fort besieged by – you got it! – werewolves. They’re awaiting the non-return of a party dispatched to secure provisions. No prizes for guessing that these poor unfortunates became provisions for the lycanthropes. Into their midst, seeking shelter and confused by the ramblings of a shaman they meet en route, come Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins).\n\nRetaining the character names from the original was pretty much a given (they had to get the words “ginger” and “snaps” into the title, after all); however, this saddles ‘Ginger Snaps Back’ from the off with the stigma of being little more than an historically transplanted remake. Maybe this is why it gets the least love out of the whole trilogy. I have read precious few good things about ‘Ginger Snaps Back’. The general consensus is that ‘Unleashed’ is a decent stab at a sequel, while ‘Back’ is all but superfluous.\n\nGood job, then, that I’m not afraid to take a minority opinion. For my money, ‘Ginger Snaps Back’ is a terrific little movie. A couple of flaws, sure – mostly notably in the occasional slide into contemporary dialogue and attitudes that belie the period setting – but a definite improvement on ‘Unleashed’ and worthy to keep the company of the original.\n\nWhat the period setting achieves is a negation of the suspension of disbelief required to introduce a werewolf into a suburban Canadian milieu in ‘Ginger Snaps’. Folklore and superstition are writ large here. Ginger, in particular, is presented as a Little Red Riding Hood figure. Although the innocence associated with that fairytale character is soon savagely subverted. Ginger and Brigitte are warned by a shaman they encounter in the wilds to “Kill the child, save the sister”. Their next encounter is with a tracker (Nathaniel Arcand) in the pay of the British; a man seemingly at one with the natural world.\n\nAt the fort, an atmosphere of mistrust and a knife-edge tension prevail. The commanding officer barely retains command, while his right-hand-man presents as a human time bomb already down to the last few seconds. The surgeon, Murphy (Matthew Walker) devises a test to determine whether outsiders are infected with lycanthropy (which makes for a couple of tense moments reminiscent of the infected blood/heat experiment in ‘The Thing’), whereas the Reverend Gilbert (Hugh Dillon) revels in each new attack or loss of life, giving it some “judgement of the Lord” hyperbole with the hellfire and brimstone turned up to 11 at every available opportunity.\n\nThe Murphy/Gilbert science/religion schism recalls the science/animalism angle of the first movie (Brigitte painstakingly attempting to find a cure/Ginger embracing her newfound feral instincts), while the confined locale compares with the clinic setting of ‘Unleashed’. It’s pushing it a bit to suggest that ‘Ginger Snaps Back’ offers a synthesis of the two preceding films, but it certainly has a lot going on for a low-budget 90-minute horror film.\n\nIt also looks good for a low-budget production. Director Grant Harvey exploits the claustrophobic setting effectively, the slow-burn establishing of conflict in the traders’ and soldiers’ interrelationships makes for a powder-keg atmosphere, and the inevitable lupine attack is tensely built up to and impressively staged. Perkins’ characterization is much more interesting and watchable than the sullen, grungy anti-heroine that slouched through ‘Unleashed’ and it pretty much goes without saying that having Isabelle back in the spotlight helps things immeasurably.\n\nAs with ‘Unleashed’, the major sin that ‘Ginger Snaps Back’ commits is simply following on from such an accomplished and ballsy film as the original. Naturally it’s not as good as ‘Ginger Snaps’. How many sequels better the originals? Precious few once you’ve got ‘The Godfather Part II’ and ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ out of the way. How many third instalments manage to keep the material interesting and seem essential in their own right rather than just part of a franchise? Precious few once you’ve got ‘Toy Story 3’ out of the way.\n\n‘Ginger Snaps Back’ is a sadly overlooked and underrated movie. It’s ripe for rediscovery.\n\nThe ‘Saints and Soldiers’ DVD case trumpets its status as Best Picture winner at seven different film festivals. The font is small and the white typeface kind of blends in with the snowy cover image, but if you squint hard enough, you make it out: Marco Island Film Festival, Ojal Festival, Heartland Film Festival, Winslow Film Festival, San Diego Film Festival, Sacramento Festival of Cinema and Long Beach International Film Festival.\n\nNah, I’ve never heard of half of them either.\n\nKnowing little about the film other than that most of the cast are affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I sat down to watch it with a vague sense of trepidation. Would it prove a genuine cinematic achievement or a theological propaganda piece?\n\nThe religious elements, to my relief (the soldiers might have been in foxholes, but I wasn’t, so my atheism remained intact), were synthesized into the story and given a moral/humanist context rather than rendering ‘Saints and Soldiers’ the cinematic equivalent of a couple of way too neatly turned-out Jehovah’s witnesses turning up on your doorstep on a Saturday morning when you’re nursing a hangover and just wanting some peace and quiet.\n\nBut what of its cinematic achievements? On the whole, it’s a fairly well realized piece of filmmaking given its small budget (three quarters of a million) and the fact that, as a result, Utah had to stand in for the Ardennes. Directed with a keen eye by Ryan Little (he was also cinematographer), generally well acted and unexpectedly tense during its closing scenes, it’s a decent movie that might have been a damn good one but for a couple of flaws. Only a couple, mind, but they’re jarring enough to be significant.\n\nThe opening scene, based on the Malmedy massacre in 1944, is very well done, establishing its cast of beleaguered American soldiers as everyday guys just trying to survive and presenting the Germans as more than mere rent-a-Kraut clichés. One moment of panic leads to bloodshed and our four mismatched survivors – guilt-ridden Christian Corporal Nathan “Deacon” Greer (Corbin Allred), pragmatic Staff Sergeant Gordon Gunnerson (Peter Holden), cynical medic Steven Gould (Alexander Niver) and lugubrious Private Shirl Kendrick (Lawrence Bagby) – plunge into the Ardennes forest and desperately try to evade German patrols.\n\nSo far so good: a seldom-mentioned wartime event as backdrop, some neatly seeded visual hints as to the source of Deacon’s guilt, and a personality clash between Gould and Deacon shaping up tensely. Plus Little’s ability to conjure images of wintry desolation that wouldn’t be out of place in ‘Ivan’s Childhood’.\n\nAbout a third of the way in, however, Little and scripters Geoffrey Panos and Matt Whitaker seem to lose faith in the dramatic potential of their survival-behind-enemy-lines narrative and throw in a downed British flyer, Oberon Winley (Kirby Heyborne), in possession of critical information that could change the course of etc etc etc. The sudden lurch into against-the-clock thrilleramics never quite convinces.\n\nNor does Heyborne’s performance. Quite apart from the only British character in the movie being called Oberon Winley (which is about as facile as if they’d called one of the Germans Fritz Wienerschnitzel), Heyborne’s attempt at an English accent is so bad it tips the whole thing into parody. Particularly when he’s served with an already fuck-awful line like “Well, you chaps have been super, but I must be off” and it comes out as “Weyell, yeeew chips hiv bayn soopah, but Eyh mist be orf.” Every time the guy opens his mouth, it’s ‘Goon Show’ territory. And unfortunately he opens his mouth a lot during the last two-thirds of the film.\n\nAs a thirty minute short without the comedy Brit and the naff top-secret info MacGuffin, ‘Saints and Soldiers’ could have been world-class. At feature length, it’s something of a noble failure. Still, it went over big at Marco Island and Ojal."
