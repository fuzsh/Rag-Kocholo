        "text": "Glenn Fink\n\n05/12/14\n\nMina vs. Nina: Mixed Relationships and Their Effects on Diasporic Cultures\n\n(For the purposes of this paper I’ll refer to Indian Americans and those of Indian origins as “Indian,” and will use “African” the same way, with its parallel caveats. )\n\nAfter watching Mississippi Masala, I wanted to write a paper about the relationship between Mina and Demetrius, and explore the differences between the two partners in this mixed race relationship, as well as outside reactions. As part of my analysis, I decided to use a second film, Nina’s Heavenly Delights, for comparison purposes, and focus on the diasporic influence and also the location’s cultural setting. In Mississippi Masala, Indian Mina falls in love with a black man, Demetrius, and creates an unwelcome stir in both related Indian and African families. In Nina’s Heavenly Delights, Indian Nina leaves London to come back to her family in Maryhill, Scotland, and falls in love with a scotch white woman, Lisa, with far more positive results. Both movies have at their core a young Indian woman who has never actually been to India, who gets into a relationship with someone of a different race, despite their parents’ hopes for a future with an Indian groom. The issues that result in their respective communities are influenced by the diasporic setting and the cultural norms of the locations where they have settled.\n\nMississippi Masala constructs a deep south for us constructed mostly of whites, Indians, and Africans. Both Indians and African are mistaken for latinos by each other. The white people are generally and systemically racist, with a superior attitude towards any colored people, and they also have all of the influence. Most have the luxury of not having to work all that hard for their money. Africans, on the other hand, work menial jobs for a living, unless they’re unemployed or retired. And those Africans that succeed are not necessarily embraced by other Africans. The Indians in the film mostly center around motels that are Indian-owned, and some (but not all) have more wealth than the Africans. The Indians, in general, consider themselves better than the Africans. The Africans do not appear to think of themselves as superior to anyone.\n\nFirst, we’ll look at how the whites in the film are portrayed. Demetrius meets Mina during their car accident. Demetrius’s truck is pushed into a white man’s pickup truck, and the white comes out and calls him “Boy” in his angry tirade. No one bats an eye, so this is apparently an accepted norm. Later at Ms. Morgan’s restaurant, Williben is a waiter, and the camera shows him in the prominent foreground as he opens the curtains to two private rooms to reveal two groups of whites partying, who wave him off. He moves on to an older white couple who stay all night, ask for a doggy bag, and fail to leave him a tip. While this is happening, Demetrius greets Ms. Morgan. Williben’s sister Rose has noted that Ms. Morgan doesn’t even say hello to her when they pass each other on the street, but Ms. Morgan smiles warmly at Demetrius and gladly lets him go into the employee area to meet his father. After he leaves, she whispers to her puzzled older white employee that Demetrius is “the good one” of Grace and Williben’s two sons. “We helped him start his own business” by speaking to the bank, she says. “You know how they are with the references and all.” It’s implied that Demetrius’s color would have kept him from getting a loan without the white intervention on his behalf.\n\nA white hotel owner complains on the phone to the police about the noise being made by Anil and Chandra’s wedding party. “Send ’em back to the reservation, that’s what I say,” says an older white man. The hotel owner replies “They’re not that kind of Indian.” The whites in Greenwood do not differentiate races that are not white, although we soon find that no one is very good at differentiating the races in Greenwood. Later, we see the same older white man commenting on the Indian consternation over the romance: “Are y’all having nigger troubles? Ha ha ha!”\n\nThe white people in charge make things tough on Demetrius after word of the relationship gets out. One says to him, “The Chamber of Commerce needs responsible people.” A particularly condescending scene happens when Demetrius and Tyrone meet the white bank loan officer, and he informs them their van may be repossessed. He says, “For whatever reason, you seem to have lost your local clients. Now boys, let me tell you something. In my life, I’ve worked hard for what I’ve got. I want to see you work hard for what you get, too.” The message is clear. You boys don’t work hard. You’re lazy. You don’t know the value of work. Meanwhile, the man behind the desk is telling us that has worked hard for what he’s got, but this message does not feel accurate.\n\nWhites in the community aren’t the only ones with a superiority complex. Harry Patel’s mother has one, too. As Mina dresses for Anil and Chanda’s wedding, Kinnu makes clear she would like Mina to consider marrying Harry Patel. Mina says “Face it Ma, you’ve got a darkie daughter. Harry’s mother doesn’t like darkies.” At the wedding, Harry greets Mina with enthusiasm, even if his own mother is not so enthused when she sees them together. Meanwhile, Chanda’s mother gossips, saying Mina has no shot with Harry because “you can be dark and have money, or you can be fair and have no money, but you can’t be dark and have no money and expect to get Harry Patel.” Nonetheless, Mina and Harry leave together, with Kinnu’s happy blessing. They leave during the prayer following Kanti’s words, “Even though we are 10,000 miles away from India, we should not forget our roots, our culture, our tradition, and our gods.”\n\nMina and Harry then go to the only place open late in “this part of town” – The Leopard Lounge – a club geared towards Africans. No other races are observed in the scene. Harry engages his car alarm before they go in. Inside, Mina is spotted by an African ex-co-worker, who is surprised to see Mina there. She asks the couple to dance, but Harry declines, aghast at the suggestion. While Mina dances, Harry becomes uncomfortable in the club. After Demetrius asks Mina to dance, Harry wants to leave, but Mina stays, making Harry angry. When Tyrone sees Mina at the bar with Demetrius, he tries to pick her up. She is placed directly between the two men for this scene. Tyrone mistakes her for being mexican, and asks why she’s “punishing herself” living in Mississippi. He is clearly interested in having her, even as he almost instantly scopes out another woman after Mina leaves.\n\nThis scene is followed by two more interesting commentaries. The first is a shot of Anil and Chandra in bed on their wedding night. Her eyes are closed. He gently touches her face, and she swats him like a fly in his face. Apparently, arranged marriages can have drawbacks.\n\nLater, Harry’s mother phones Kinnu to complain about Mina’s rudeness at the club, which concerns Kinnu particularly because she owes Harry’s family money. Economics become a part of the equation. It appears Harry’s family is well off. Perhaps this is another reason why Kinnu would like to see that relationship flourish. But maybe Kinnu also wants to one-up Harry’s mother. She tells Mina, “You should have seen his mother’s face when you two left.”\n\nJigna Desai notes in her piece “When Indians Play Cowboys” in Beyond Bollywood that “(Mississippi Masala) turns to mobility and the (romance) as a resolution to displacement and exclusion” and that “Diaspora as exile is rejected in favor of diaspora as the frontier” (Desai 73). In this way, we can analyze the behavior of the Indians towards the Africans, and get some sense of how they have learned to cope with their circumstances as residents of Mississippi, and their attitudes towards Africans. Jay in particular has problems with Africans resulting from his own emotional baggage. When Demetrius meets Jay towards the end of the film, he notes that where Jay’s family came from, they could have been as “black as the ace of spades,” and as soon as they arrive here, they start “acting white.” He emphasizes to Jay that “I know you and your daughter aren’t but a few shades from this (points to his cheek) right here.” Jay has a flashback to his arrest in Africa, and his being stuffed in a trunk, as Demetrius walks away.\n\nDuring the Indian prayer the morning after the wedding, Kanti says, “Oh lord, grant peace to every living creature under the sun.” As he says this, a black dog calmly and stealthily walks away with the shoe of one of the participants. This foreshadows the problems the community will face with the mixed race romance. Later, Jammubhai brings tea to Demetrius and Tyrone in the hope of dissuading ideas of a lawsuit. Demonstrating his own racism, he says “Your people are very good at sports, no?” He mentions Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Freddie Brown, and by accident, Macho Camacho, a latino star, as examples of Africans that excel in sports. When this is pointed out to him, he says, “Black, brown, yellow, mexican, puerto rican, all the same. As long as you’re not white, you’re colored.” He tells them “All us people of color must stick together.” This doesn’t ring true, however, after word of the romance gets out and he cancels his contract with Demetrius.\n\nAfter the wedding scene, Pontiac, Jammubhai and Jay get drunk together. Pontiac says, “Jay, in Uganda, you were the champion defender of blacks. But the same blacks kicked you out.” Jay, drunk, picks up the phone “To tell the person living in my house (in Uganda) to GET OUT.” Jay could be trying to conquer the inadequacy he felt from being exiled from Uganda by feeing superior to Africans, who should not dare to dirty his home now with their occupancy, 18 years after he was removed. We know that Jay was upset at Okelo for telling him that Africa was now for black africans under Idi Amin’s regime. Jay tells Mina this is why they left Uganda. “That’s what it all came down to. The color of my skin.”\n\nAn interesting contrast to the attitudes of the white and the Indians are the attitudes of the Africans. Starting in Uganda, we see Okelo rescue his lifelong friend Jay from prison or worse, and Jay does not appreciate this gesture for what it is at the time. It is suggested later in the film that Okelo may have paid for that loyalty with his life. Jay clearly resents Okelo, even if it’s not clear why, until we factor in that at a time of helplessness, he is helped by an African.\n\nBack in Mississippi, Dexter openly blames the whites for his lack of job opportunities, but Demetrius doesn’t buy it. He thinks Dexter is making excuses for his lack of effort. The viewer is not privy to the truth. We get a look inside Dexter’s frustration when he relates the story of writing “Kill the crackers” on a public computer and then not being able to erase it. Demetrius has good reasons to blame whites and Indians for his own problems by the end of the film, but he never does.\n\nTyrone continues to try to woo Mina at their family picnic/birthday gathering for Williben. He tells Demetrius, “Maybe when Alicia come back to you, you can pass Mina on to me.” It seems likely that Tyrone is only interested in having a fling with her. But everyone at the picnic likes Mina. Rose smiles to herself when Demetrius is protective of Mina, asking Dexter to stop asking her so many questions while she tries to eat. She is less happy to see Alicia when she arrives late to the party and condescends to Mina. At the end of the picnic, Williben affectionately says to Mina, “Come see us again y’hear?” But he is also excited when Alicia arrives. In an earlier scene, he’s told Demetrius that Alicia has “always been a part of this family. She always will be so long as I’m alive.” There’s no question that Williben would like to see a reconciliation between Alicia and Demetrius.\n\nDuring the meal, Williben asks Mina why Indians are in Africa, and it comes out that Indians were initially slave labor in Uganda. When Mina states she’s never been to India, Dexter notes, “You’re just like us. We’ve never been to Africa.” The message is that we are in America now, and american culture is influential towards happenings in the film. This is reinforced by the relationship Jay had with Okelo. As children and for most of their adult lives as friends in Uganda, Jay and Okelo did not care about being from different races. Idi Amin’s exile order changed their relationship. But in America, things may never have been equal. And considering further that America was a destination for African slaves, this has to be a major player in what shapes racial attitudes in the deep south, where slavery lasted the longest and was ended only after a war.\n\nRose also has a moment alone with Mina. She mentions that Demetrius would be studying at Jackson State if his mother hadn’t died, and he didn’t trust Dexter to take care of their aging father. Foreshadowing events to come, she also says “Sometimes no matter how hard you work, things (go) wrong. That’s when you got to know how to make them right again.”\n\nDovetailing with the revelation about Demetrius not attending college is Jay’s pleading with Mina to attend college. But similarly, she thinks of her family first, and is concerned about creating a financial burden by going to school. In this way, both Demetrius and Mina are stuck in Greenwood thanks to the circumstances of their respective families, and the loyalty they feel towards them.\n\nBetween Mina and Demetrius, there is at first some uncertainty about how to relate to each other, and it’s unclear whether it’s racially based or not. When Mina calls Demetrius to thank him for the ride, he initially thinks it might be motivated by concern over being sued, but it’s not. On the other hand, when they both meet in Biloxi, she says “I don’t do this every day.” He responds, “What, you think I do?”\n\n“How should I know?”\n\n“I think you got the wrong idea about me. My name’s Demetrius, not Tyrone.”\n\nAs they spend a day together, Mina tells him that people always come to their hotel and say, “Not another goddamned Indian.” He responds by saying she should pick her battles, or in his words, “Racism, or Tradition, is passed down like recipes, and the trick is you got to know what to eat, and what to leave on the plate.” When they are in bed together naked, that scene is lit so that their skin tones are strikingly similar. Mina awakes in the middle of the night after a nightmare about Idi Amin announcing how terrible asians were for Africa, and the last image before she awakes is of a dead African.\n\nThings go awry in the morning when Anil spots Demetrius’s truck outside a motel room and catches the two young lovers in bed. Charging into the room, he says “Leave our women alone!” Anil also announces to Kanti later, as he kicks Jay and family out of the motel, that he is an american, and if Kanti doesn’t like it, he should go back to India. Anil’s racial attitude appears to be americanized. And the fallback that comes from the romance is fierce.\n\nIn the police station waiting room, Tyrone goes to greet Jammubhai, but is brushed off. The Indians sit on one side, while Tyrone sits on the other side. The divisions have now been drawn. As Tyrone drives Demetrius back, he tells him, “you better leave them fuckin foreigners alone man, they ain’t nothing but trouble. United we stand, divided we fall… but if you fall in bed with one of their daughters, yo ass gonna swing.” This lynching reference comes just before we hear Indian music from a passing Indian hotel enter the scene. The song is from Shree 420, about always being Hindustani at heart, no matter what your circumstances. It’s the same song we heard on Kinnu’s tape recorder when the bus in Uganda was stopped and she was singled out and traumatized by the African troops.\n\nMeanwhile, Mina tries to explain her feelings to her parents, who are upset that she had a relationship with an African. As Mina says in frustration, “I love him. That’s not a crime is it?” Kinnu says, “You call this love when all you’ve done is bring such shame on our heads?” Jay adds, “Have the decency at least to be sorry!” When Kinnu asks, “What about his family?” Mina responds with, “This is America, Mom. No one cares!”\n\nUnfortunately, people do care. We hear a string of gossipers following this scene. An Indian woman (Mira Nair in a cameo) says, “Can you imagine dumping Harry Patel for a black?” A young black woman says to Demetrius, “You let down a family, your community, your entire race. I don’t see no shortage of black women around Greenwood.” Williben says to him, “What’s wrong with you boy, don’t you know the rules?”\n\nAunt Rose chides Williben for his words. “All you and the rest of them want is that he should know his place and stay in it. But the days of slavery, they over Williben!” Dexter tries to show support, with mixed results. “People say to me, your brother deserve what happened. Your brother think he large now. Your brother think he got himself a white chick. But they just a bunch of insane to the brains.” Demetrius’s barber also chimes in his reflection. “Black folks don’t like to see other black folks do good.”\n\nBefore Mina and Demetrius run off, Jay tells Kinnu, “Mina is free to love anyone she chooses” but he still has “responsibility as her father.” He chides Demetrius for him and Mina trying to “change the world, but the world is not so quick to change.” Williben chides Mina when she comes looking for him, saying, “Young lady, you’ve caused enough problems in my son’s life, and I don’t need you to cause problems in mine.” Nonetheless, he at least gives her a hint about how to find him, which proves crucial to the ending of the film, when they run away together.\n\nWe can compare this set of events to similar events set in Scotland. In Nina’s Heavenly Delights, Nina returns to her parents’ home in Scotland upon news of the death of her father, Mohan Shah. She arrives just too late for the funeral. Her absence from her family’s life is highlighted in his eulogy. We learn that she left for London on the day that she was to be wed in an arranged marriage to Sanjay, three years earlier. In the time since, her father had developed a gambling problem and lost half of his successful restaurant, The Taj Mahal, in a bet to Lisa’s father. Nina’s mother Suman blames Nina partially for her father’s early demise, saying that she broke his heart by leaving.\n\nHer brother Kary wants to open a convenience store with the money earned from the sale of her father’s restaurant. The buyer would be Raj, who is Sanjay’s father. Not so coincidentally, he is also the one Suman names as her real true love in life by the end of the film. She didn’t love Mohan the same way when they met, and her love for him never reached the same level as her love for Raj. This is significant because it gives Nina’s mother not just an economic incentive for Nina marrying Sanjay. It also fulfills what she seems to view as a lost opportunity in her own life, which can be partially righted through projection on her daughter.\n\nWhen Nina enters Best of the West to try to finish winning the “hat trick” for her dad, Suman is upset with her for coming back and “disrupting our lives and creating heartbreak.” Kary is upset as well, and says Raj will beat her and she’ll humiliate them “all over again.” It is possible Kary is only upset about potentially losing the money from the restaurant sale.\n\nSuman is resentful that Nina left and caused her father humiliation and a broken heart by running from the marriage to Sanjay. She tells Nina it would have meant the world to her father if she had come back while he was still alive. When Nina asks about her own heart, her mother says they only wanted what was best for her. But she also states “we all do things we don’t want. There is no ‘why’.” This is similar to what Lajjo said to Simran in DDLJ when her marriage to Kuljit was impending, and also a similar sentiment to Kinnu’s reflections on why Mina should marry Harry Patel. Nina expresses her frustration: “They had it all mapped out for me. Marry Sanjay, have lots of little Sanjays, we’d have the Taj and the Jewel… they saw us as this power cooking couple.”\n\nWe don’t know how Nina’s father would have reacted to her relationship with Lisa, but we get clues. Nina reads his written words, “Always follow your heart.” She’s more concerned about her mother, Suman, who would still like for Nina to marry Sanjay. Just like in MM, the female is feeling pressure from her mother to arrange a marriage with another Indian, at least partially for economic reasons. Suman is upset that Nina gave up on a future with Sanjay, since Raj and her mother are so close. And she tells Nina not to rely on Raj buying the restaurant if he has to wait through a competition. “Raj won’t always be here. Not if we keep turning him down.”\n\nAt the Chutney Queens drag show, Nina unexpectedly runs into Lisa, who is there with Kary. At this point we are led to believe Kary is pursuing Lisa, making Lisa strictly off limits to Nina. However, he confesses to Nina that he is secretly married to Janice, who appears to be a white scotch woman just like Lisa. This clears the path for Nina to pursue Lisa, and they soon consummate their new relationship. Lisa wants to tell everyone about it, but Nina is still afraid to go public with their relationship. She wants to stay in London now, but she is afraid her mother will react to the relationship by saying “not under her roof” and kick her out, alienating her again from her family.\n\nNina’s younger sister Priya also has a secret that she is afraid will cause her mother to get upset. She is an expert-level Scottish folk dancer. It apparently upset her father so much that he banned her from doing it. So, all three of Suman’s children are keeping secrets from her. But as they get ready to head to the TV studio for the competition, Priya reveals this secret to Suman. Her mother approves. Then Kaya confesses his marriage to Janice. Suman reacts to these revelations by saying, “Seems I have a lot to learn about love. My children seem to understand it much better than I do.” She asks if there are any more bombshells, but Nina declines to reveal her new relationship, which disappoints Lisa.\n\nUnbeknownst to Nina at this time, Suman is already aware that a romance is brewing with Lisa. But during the competition, Sanjay tells Lisa that Suman would never allow the relationship, and if they told her about it, Nina would lose her family again. We are not really sure if the reason for this would be that Lisa is white, though it seems unlikely given the reaction to Kary’s marriage. The homosexuality of the relationship also seems unlikely to be a serious problem, considering how accepting Suman is of Nina’s drag queen friend, Bobbi. Perhaps it’s just that she wouldn’t be marrying Sanjay, which seems like the most self-serving explanation from his point of view.\n\nWhen Sanjay’s effort succeeds in upsetting Lisa enough for her to walk off set, Nina follows, and Suman follows Nina. “Don’t make the same mistake I did,” she says. Regarding Mohan, “He wasn’t the one.” Then she says “The only thing that matters is love.” This is an about-face from her earlier musings on love, when she said, “Love isn’t the be-all and end-all, Nina. You could have learned to love Sanjay.” Suman reveals that she did not initially love Nina’s father. But her attitude has changed. With her mother’s approval in hand, Nina and Lisa go on to win the competition. They finally reveal their relationship to the world. As the scene fades, the model Taj Mahal shines brightly in closeup.\n\nWe don’t get any sense of how a homosexual relationship would be greeted in Greenwood, but it does not seem to be a big issue in Glasgow. Europe does not seem to suffer the same level of issues with homosexuality or racism that the deep American south does. It’s still an issue, but a much more manageable one. We don’t actually see anyone onscreen giving Bobbi, Nina or Lisa a hard time for being gay. It never comes up as even a potential problem for anyone in Nina’s family. Most of the conflict in NHD comes from Nina’s reluctance to sell the restaurant, rather than her relationship with Nina. It ties into her non-relationship with Sanjay. The issue of race also seems to be a non-issue, in stark contrast to MM. When Kary announces he’s married a woman named Janice, we see no flicker of concern from Suman regarding the likelihood that Janice is a white woman.\n\nIt seems clear from these two films that location makes a difference when gauging what the reactions of a diasporic family are going to be when their offspring enter into a serious relationship that is not with another Indian, or a relationship that is not somehow pre-arranged. Western culture eschews arranged marriages, and it’s clear in both films that such alignments are doomed to failure. But the expectations in their adopted locale are likely to have a strong effect on the reactions of the diasporic families involved.\n\nWorks Consulted\n\nDesai, Jinga. “When Indians Play Cowboys: Diaspora and Postcoloniality in Mira Nair’s Mississippi Masala.” Bollywood and Beyond.
