        "text": "891.001 Pahlavi, Reza Mohammad/8–1544\n\nThe Shahanshah of Iran (Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi) to President Roosevelt 75\n\nMy Dear Mr. President: I was distressed to hear, by your letter of February 10th, that you had been laid up for some time with an attack of the “flu” and hope you are now enjoying the best of health and strength.\n\nYou will need all your accustomed vigour and energy to bring to final accomplishment the colossal and unprecedented efforts your country is making, under your brilliant leadership, for the early termination of the war and the establishment of a just and lasting peace.\n\nIt was indeed a source of regret to me that circumstances, over which I had no control, deprived me of the pleasure of seeing more of you in Tehran and extending to Your Excellency the warm hospitality which my people and I like to show to illustrious friends of Iran.\n\nIt is, I assure you, more than ever the firm intention and earnest desire of my government and myself to intensify the cooperation of the United States of America with Iran, now and after the war. The confidence happily existing between our two nations should create an atmosphere of more comprehensive understanding and mutual aid.\n\nMr. Abol-Hassan Ebtehadj, Governor of our National Bank, the bearer of this letter, who is our delegate to the Monetary Conference76 to be held shortly in your country, will be able to furnish all necessary details on this and other subjects. A frank exchange of views between him and the members of Your Excellency’s Government will, no doubt, be extremely useful.\n\nWith all good wishes for the continued success of your arms and assurances of my highest esteem, I am, my dear Mr. President, always yours sincerely,"
