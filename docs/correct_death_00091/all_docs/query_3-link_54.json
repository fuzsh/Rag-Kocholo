        "text": "In 1974, two French doctors were called to the Iranian capital, Tehran.\n\nThe doctors — specialists in blood diseases — had been asked to assess a government minister with cancer, but the appointment was odd.\n\nThe minister didn't seem to want their professional advice, he just wanted to have a nice lunch with the doctors and a chat.\n\nBut it was all a ruse. As the dinner was ending, they were taken into another room to see their real patient — the Shah, Iran's King of Kings.\n\nIranian culture is extremely secretive about illness — even more so when it's the king who is sick.\n\nThe Shah was in his 33rd year as his country's absolute monarch. In the eyes of the West, he was a benevolent dictator.\n\nHe was in his 50s, handsome and fit, but told the doctors he'd felt a lump on his left side under his ribs.\n\nHe wanted them to find out what it was, without leaving a paper trail. No X-rays, no scans, no charts, no notes.\n\nThey did some tests, and diagnosed him with cancer — leukaemia.\n\nThis cancer diagnosis led to a Shakespearean tragedy that not only brought about the end of the Iranian monarchy, but also directly led to the situation we are in today, where Iran has, for 45 years, been the arch-enemy of America.\n\nSince the Iran-backed group Hamas attacked Israel in October, both Israel and the United States have been striking other Iran-backed militant groups around the region, in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile those groups have been accused of attacking American military bases and navy ships.\n\nOpen warfare between the US and Iran becomes more and more likely by the day, and it all began in the spleen of one man.\n\nDaddy issues\n\nMohammad Reza and his twin sister were born in 1919 to a military officer with no connection to the royal family.\n\nHis father was ambitious and violent — he liked to kick insubordinate subordinates in the testicles if they didn't follow his orders.\n\nWhen Mohammad was six, his father led a military coup against the sitting Shah, and seized the crown of Iran.\n\nThe young crown prince had a difficult childhood.\n\nThe new Shah thought that if fathers showed affection to their sons it could lead to homosexuality.\n\nHe didn't want this for his favourite son Mohammad, so he basically ignored him until he was a teenager.\n\nHis twin sister became the more dominant of the two. Mohammad was reclusive, and many described him as \"sad\".\n\nDuring World War II, the British and Soviets invaded Iran and forced his father to abdicate. At the age of 22, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi became Shah of Iran.\n\nMan of the people... sort of\n\nMohammad Reza was very ambitious about what he could achieve as Shah.\n\nHe saw himself as a man of the people, of sorts. He would drive around the streets of Tehran in one of his many sports cars and chat with average Iranians.\n\nHe vowed not to be crowned until his people were educated, well-fed and lived lives equivalent to Europeans.\n\nThankfully, the enormous oil reserves found under the Iranian desert made that a real possibility.\n\nThe Shah intensified the modernisation program started by his father.\n\nSupported by the British and American connections he'd made during the war, he spent big on road, rail, health, education and defence projects.\n\nBut his reputation as a man of the people didn't last.\n\nIn 1948 while out in public, he was shot, and he withdrew from contact with the public.\n\nAnd after a coup in 1953, the Shah decided he couldn't trust a government to deliver his modernisation plans, so he dispensed with democracy altogether.\n\nModernisation at any cost\n\nThe Shah decided he would modernise the country through sheer force of will.\n\nThe feudal system was abolished and gradually, the big estates of wealthy landowners were shared among their former serfs.\n\nHe believed that once the country was industrialised, it would be ready for democracy.\n\nBy the mid-70s, Iran established itself as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.\n\nWomen were able to work and vote, and many young people wore 70s European fashion.\n\nHis regime was celebrated by western leaders, but it was far from perfect.\n\nThe Shah surrounded himself with 'yes' men, and led a regime many would later describe as \"remarkably repressive\".\n\nHis position was protected by the fast-growing military and agents of the SAVAK secret police, who kidnapped and tortured political opponents.\n\nCareening toward collapse\n\nAfter his cancer diagnosis at the age of 54, the Shah feared his teenage heir would be unable to complete his modernisation efforts. The plan would have to be accelerated.\n\nGovernment spending increased. He started lending huge amounts of money to neighbouring countries, hoping to increase the general stability of the Middle East by making everyone richer.\n\nWith American help, he set up a nuclear energy program, hoping to fast-track his country into superpower status with nuclear power and possibly nuclear weapons.\n\nTo secure his family's position, he entered into a number of spectacular arms deals with Western countries.\n\nBut many Iranians were upset by his leadership. Persian culture had a 2,500 year old history, and the Shah was trying to replace that in the few years he had left.\n\nHis reforms were also undermined by corruption and the secret police became more brutal. Months of violent riots and protests followed.\n\nIn February 1979, 45 years ago this week, the revolution was complete.\n\nThe monarchy collapsed, the Shah fled the country, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an Islamic religious leader, took control.\n\nRefuge and retaliation\n\nThe Shah was in a predicament.\n\nOther countries were building relationships with Iran's new rulers, and didn't want to anger them by giving the Shah refuge.\n\nHe was forced to bounce from country to country, all the while becoming more and more unwell.\n\nYears of trying to keep his condition a secret had led him to get worse medical care than even a middle class Iranian would have been able to get.\n\nHe wound up in Mexico, where the doctors thought he had malaria, and suggested he be transferred to New York for specialist treatment.\n\nAnd despite the risk that this would seriously irritate the Ayatollahs, president Jimmy Carter agreed.\n\nAs expected, it did irritate the Ayatollahs. The chief justice of Iran's new Revolutionary Court put a bounty on the Shah's head and issued this statement:\n\n\"I have asked all Muslims and Iranian students in the United States to wait outside the hospital, and then go inside and take him away.\n\nA legacy of sanctions\n\nNobody killed the Shah in New York, but in Tehran, a large group of Iranian students decided to take vengeance on the Americans, through their embassy.\n\nArmed students took over the US Embassy, and held 52 diplomats hostage.\n\nThey demanded Washington send the Shah back from America, but the United States refused.\n\nThe US piled crushing sanctions onto the Iranian economy to try and force the government to send the hostages back.\n\nThe hostages were released the hour after president Carter left office — a deliberate punishment against him.\n\nBy then, the Shah was dead, and the damage was done. The hostage crisis led to sanctions, and the sanctions were never lifted.\n\nThe US and Iran have been enemies ever since.\n\nThis is the lasting legacy of the Shah.\n\nHe's a man who instituted sweeping reforms, many of which — the giant military, the nuclear program, the secret police — are now keeping the Ayatollahs in power.\n\nHe is also a man who was supported, then harboured by America, leading to a retaliation. And a lasting atmosphere of hostility between the US and Iran.\n\nSo far, the tension has not exploded into open warfare.\n\nHopefully it stays that way."
