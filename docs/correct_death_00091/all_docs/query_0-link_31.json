BURTON 182 PREFATORY NOTE Centenary of the Royal Asiatic Society provides an occasion for surveying the progress of the Society since its foundation, and its literary output during the period of its existence. A model for such an undertaking has been furnished by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in its Centenary Review of the Researches of the Society, published in 1885, the utility of which has been demonstrated by experience. The Council of the R.A.S. decided, therefore, to celebrate its Centenary by issuing a work on somewhat similar lines, and were fortunate in finding one of their number, Mr. F. E. Pargiter, willing to undertake the tedious task of compiling it. He has earned thereby the gratitude of the Society, and, they hope they may add, of Orientalists everywhere. The principles which he has followed were adopted after careful consideration, due regard being given to the fact that owing to the enormous progress made in these subjects, and its constant acceleration, much of the material contained in the Society's publications has now only historical interest. A few portraits have been introduced of celebrities connected with the Society, including its founder, Colebrooke, and Lord Reay, who was its president for twenty- three years, during which the membership steadily increased, though even now it falls far short of what the vast Oriental interests of the British Empire might seem to demand. The Editor desires to acknowledge with gratitude the assistance given him by various colleagues, especially the Rev. Professor Margoliouth, Mr. W. Foster and Mr. A. G. Ellis, who has contributed a brief description of some of the Society's possessions. THE PRESIDENT AND COUNCIL. April, 1023. A BRIEF HISTORY of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1823 to 1923 The Koyal Asiatic Society was founded by Henry Thomas Colebrooke, the eminent Sanskrit scholar, in March, 1823. Similar societies had been already established elsewhere. The Asiatic Society had been founded by Sir William Jones at Calcutta in 1784, the Literary Society of Bombay by Sir James Mackintosh in 1801, and a similar society at Madras by Sir John Newbolt and Mr. B. G. Babington, the Societe Asiatique at Paris in 1822, and a Batavian Society as early as 1779. H. T. Colebrooke, Sir G. T. Staunton, Sir J. Malcolm, Sir A. Johnston, and others interested in Oriental matters met in January, 1823, and as \" Original Members \" drew up their proposals and appointed a committee to carry them out. Accordingly a prospectus was issued, and a circular letter fixing the first general meeting for 15th March, 1823, and mentioning the agenda, chiefly the election of a Council and officers. The prospectus, dated 16th January, 1823, pointed out as a matter for surprise, that no Society for the advance- ment of Oriental learning like that in Bengal had been founded by those who had returned from India ; research in Oriental matters had a peculiar attraction, and the literature of the Chinese was almost untrodden ground ; and an association of intelligent persons might encourage research, extend inter- course between Europe and Asia, and lead to results reciprocally beneficial. It proposed therefore \" to found a Society upon an enlarged basis, that may embrace the views and be adapted to the pursuits of all persons whom it may be desirable to associate, whether their tastes should lead them into historical and antiquarian research \" or in other directions. Vlll HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY The meeting took place on 15th March, 1823, at the Thatched House, St. James Street, and H. T. Colebrooke was called to the chair. He inaugurated it with a discourse, explaining the views and purposes of the Society. It was instituted for the investigation of the sciences and arts of Asia, with the hope of facilitating ameliorations there and of advancing knowledge and improving the arts at home. Asia was the most anciently and most numerously peopled region of the globe, and the range of research would comprise the whole of it and be as various as its peoples. The scope would embrace both ancient and modern times, and include history, civil polity, institutions, manners, customs, languages, literature, and science ; in short, the progress of knowledge in Asia and the means of its extension. It would not be confined to the geographical limits of Asia, but include the connexions of Western Asia with foreign countries as in the spread of Mohammedanism ; and nothing which had engaged the thoughts of men would be foreign to the Society's inquiry within those limits. This discourse was approved and published. The Society was formally constituted as the \" Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland \". The King consented to be its Patron. The Marquess Wellesley and the Marquess of Hastings became Vice-Patrons, and the President of the Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India was ex qfficio a Vice-Patron. The Council was formed of twenty-five members, elected annually by ballot, and from them the officers were chosen. The President was the Rt. Hon. Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, M.P. (President of the Board of Control), the Director H. T. Colebrooke, and the Vice- Presidents four, with a Treasurer and Secretary. The Society included nearly every Oriental scholar of note resident in England, and its numbers were then or soon afterwards 324, of whom 217 were paying members. The Council was directed to frame regulations, to provide a suitable place for meetings, and to obtain a Charter of Incorporation. Accordingly SIR GEORGE THOMAS STAUNTON, BART. One <tf the Original l^ice Presidents, 1823. [To fare i) mi. HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY IX regulations were framed, and were sanctioned at the next meeting on 19th April. The King granted the title \" Royal \", and the Society became the \" Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland \" at the meeting of 7th June, 1823. The Council took the lease of 14 Graf ton Street, Bond Street, at a rental of 225, and entered into possession of it on 15th January, 1824. The Charter of Incorporation was granted on llth August, 1824. By it the Council is to consist of the President and not more than twenty-four nor less than five councillors ; general meetings must elect the Council annually from among the members, and make by-laws ; while the Council has sole management of the income, funds, and all other affairs, subject as regards lands and tenements to general meetings. Membership was of five kinds : \" resident \" members were those whose usual abode was in Groat Britain and Ireland; \" non-resident \" members were British subjects usually residing elsewhere ; \" honorary \" members were foreigners of eminent rank or persons who made distinguished contributions ; \" foreign \" members were non-British subjects, non-resident in the British Dominions in Europe, not exceeding fifty ; and \" corresponding \" members were persons not living in the British Isles who were likely to communicate valuable information. All had to be elected at general meetings. \" Residents \" paid an admission-fee of 5 guineas and a yearly subscription of 3 guineas ; \" non-residents \" paid 20 guineas on election, and no annual subscription ; and all others were free. Highly ornate diplomas were given to the honorary members, and other diplomas to corresponding members. The Society met generally monthly, except from July to November, and members were balloted for, business transacted, and papers read ; but after the report of the earliest meetings, no account of the meetings appears till 1834. The annual meetings were held in May. The East India Company subscribed 100 guineas yearly, and the Society received liberal donations of books and articles X HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY of value or interest (and also of money), with which it formed a library and a museum ; and a Librarian was appointed. Over 150 such donations had been made by 1834. The Council entered with ardour on the practical measures advocated in the Inaugural discourse, and established a \" Committee of Correspondence \" sometime during the years 1824-6, with Sir Alexander Johnston (formerly Chief Justice of Ceylon) as Chairman, two Deputy-Chairmen, twelve members, and a Secretary. Its objects were to receive intelligence and inquiries relating to the arts, sciences, literature, history, and antiquities of Asia and especially of India, to discover new sources of information, and to furnish applicants with information. Any person, not residing in the British Dominions in Europe, who made valuable communications, might be elected a \" Corresponding \" member. It opened correspondence with scholars and others in other countries, some of whom became such members. The Society issued its first publication, called \" Trans- actions, Vol. I \", in quarto form in 1827. This contained the Report of the first general meeting, the Charter, the Inaugural discourse, and papers read from the beginning till March, 1827 ; and was prefaced by an advertisement that the Council in selecting papers for publication was guided by the importance or singularity of the subjects, but did not guarantee the certainty of the facts or the propriety of the reasonings. It concluded with meteorological observations and lists of donations. The Society then had four royal \" honorary \" members (the Duke of York, the King of Oude, the Prince Royal of Persia, and the Raja of Tanjore), 4 Vice-Patrons, and 373 resident and 59 non- resident members, from whom was elected the Council of 25, including the President, Director, 4 Vice-Presidents, and the Treasurer, Librarian, and Secretary. The collections of Oriental MSS. in public and private libraries in England had attracted the attention of Continental scholars, many of whom found it necessary to come here HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY XI to prosecute their studies successfully. A scheme was formed in 1827 to raise a fund, search for and make public all that was valuable in the literature of Asia and especially of British India, and so advance Oriental learning by publishing, free of cost to the authors and at a moderate price, translations of approved works in Oriental languages, accompanied generally by the original texts. The Council associated itself with the scheme, and appointed a Committee to superintend it. Thus was formed the \" Oriental Translation Committee \" with the \" Oriental Translation Fund \" about the beginning of 1828. It had the King as Patron and 21 Vice-Patrons, and consisted of Sir Gore Ouseley as Chairman, 5 Deputy-Chairmen, 8(5 members, and an Auditor, Treasurer, and Secretary. The Society passed the East India Company's subscription of 100 guineas over to it. This Committee issued its prospectus appealing to the public for support, and received it munificently from the East India Company, the Universities, and public bodies, so that it obtained over 100 subscribers of 10 and 5 guineas with a total fund of more than 1,100. It proposed to give annually four rewards in money, from 50 to 100 each, and four gold medals of the value of 15 guineas each, for works deserving of distinction, and to supply the published books free to subscribers of 10 guineas, and on very advantageous terms to those of 5 guineas. It dispatched its prospectus throughout India and to all Eastern countries, and asked the Governor-General of India and the Asiatic Society of Bengal to appoint an efficient Corresponding Committee at Calcutta, seeking by all these efforts and by communication with Governors, scholars, and others to obtain original MS. texts and translations. The Committee reported its progress to the Society annually. Its first report in May, 1828, stated it had already received MSS. and put certain works in hand ; and <bhe second in March, ] 829, showed how far-reaching and elaborate had been its efforts. Xll HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY The second volume of the Transactions was published in 1830, and contained papers read from April, 1827, to July, 1830. with appendices about the Eegulations, Translation Fund, etc. The Bombay Literary Society and the United Literary Society of Madras became integral parts or branches of the Society, but remained independent in administration and funds. The third volume, comprising papers read from March, 1830, to December, 1833, was issued in three parts in 1831, 1833, and 1834. But the mode followed in publishing the \" Transactions \" was inconvenient as regarded restrictions on the subjects, the quarto form and uncertain periods of issue, hence the Council introduced a quarterly issue in octavo form, less limited in scope, with the title of \" Journal \", and published the first volume in 1834, prefacing it with the caution that was prefixed to the first volume of the \" Transactions \". It gave also, for the first time, a regular report of the meetings from 7th December, 1833, the election of members, accounts, donations, reports, rules, and abstracts of papers read, together with comments. The Society then comprised 1 honorary, 355 resident, 52 non-resident, 80 foreign, and 27 corresponding members. The income during 1833 was 1,424, and the expenditure 1,059. The museum was open on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Journal bore on its title-page the vignette of a banyan- tree with an elephant standing under it, and the motto \" Quot rami tot arbores \". The Committee of Correspondence had continued its investigations through travellers, Government agents, and others ; it had branches in Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, and Rome, and Professor F. A. Rosen was its German Secretary. The Oriental Translation Committee published 30 volumes in its first four years, and 14 soon after June, 1832. Its receipts in 1833 were 1,565, its disbursements 1,487, and its assets 5,746. It comprised .members resident in all countries ; and one of its most promising fields was the PROFESSOR HORACE HAYMAN WILSON. Director, 1837-60; President,* 1 855-59. [To face p. xii. HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY Xlll Buddhist and Sanskrit MSS. in Nepal, where Brian Houghton Hodgson was a generous contributor. The quarterly publication of the Journal effected a yearly saving of about 200, and increased the circle of readers, and non-resident members were allowed in 1835 6 the option of paying a subscription of two guineas annually. Many of its members during these early years were Fellows of the Royal Society, though they do not appear to have been predominantly scientific. The Chairman of the Court of Directors became a Vice-Patron ex officio. The Society began exchanging its publications with those of other Societies in 1834. It sought in 1828 to get a site from the Government but unsuccessfully ; and again in 1833 to get accommodation for itself in some public building, and received some hopes of favour from the authorities, but its claim was disallowed in 1837. Similar efforts were made afterwards at various times, but it has never received any such benefit from the State. The Committee of Correspondence turned its attention in 1834 -5 to two objects, collecting materials for the history of the Carnatic and the best means of introducing the sciences of Europe among the Hindus there. Trade with India was thrown open in 1833, and trade in tea and other goods with China in 1834. The Society then, in pursuance of its practical aims, established a \" Committee of Agriculture and Commerce \" on 16th July, 1836, consisting of the President, Vice- Presidents, members of Council, and ten others. It had a separate fund and rules, members of the Society paid a subscription of one guinea, and Dr. Royle became its Secretary. It busied itself at once with important commercial products, coflee, sugar, opium, cotton, salt, wool, dyes, oil, etc., and sent out Queries. It thus elicited in 1837, and afterwards, much useful information about those articles and their improvement, especially from Madras, which was the most prominent Province for the Society, and entered into communication with the Horticultural and Agricultural XIV HISTORY OP THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY Societies of India and England. It submitted reports at the Society's annual meetings, and they contain much matter of interest. Dr. Royle began to collect a museum of products, but the East India Company secured him as a Secretary and took him away to collect for its museum in Leadenhall Street and to write on Indian Botany about 1839, and that brought the Committee's activities practically to a standstill soon afterwards. The Oriental Translation Committee continued its publica- tions, and made a notable advance in Vedic studies by printing Professor Rosen's edition arid translation of the first book of the Rigveda in 1837. The success of the Journal and its regular issue, however, were not maintained, apparently because of the lack of enough papers of merit and the decadence of the early interest and enthusiasm, the supporters fell off, and the Society's pecuniary means caused anxiety in 1839 and subsequent years. Major-General Sir Henry Worsley gave the Society 1,100 in 1836-7 ; and Mr. James Alexander 400 in 1843-6. The Presidents generally held office for three years, but all the other officers, though elected annually, retained their positions ordinarily for indefinite periods, as the lists in the Appendix will show. The rules were revised, and members were allowed to compound for their subscriptions. The Journal often appeared only biennially, and all the annual reports do not seem to have been published. Volume VILI was issued in 1846, with an Index to the Transactions and the eight volumes of the Journal. The Literary Society of Bombay changed its name to the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1838. The Ceylon Society became another branch in 1845, and the Asiatic Society of China was founded at Hong Kong by Sir J. F. Davis in 1847. Studious interests were growing in the East, but at home the number of members who paid annually continued to fall, and the Jists published do not show the real diminution and loss, because they include HISTORY OP THE HOYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY xv those members who had compounded and those non-residents who paid no yearly subscription, and because the names of defaulters appear to have been included for some years before being removed. In order to improve the position, it was proposed in 1847 that a better house with greater facilities for the growth of the library and museum should be taken, that the Court of Directors should be asked for increased support, and that lectures should be instituted. The Court raised its contribution from 100 to 200 guineas, and the Society took the lease of 5 New Burlington Street in 1848. Lectures were delivered then or soon afterwards, yet apparently rather irregularly, and informal evening meetings were introduced some years later. The first President, Mr. Wynn, continued by re-election for eighteen years till 1841, but for fifty years after that the Presidents changed frequently, seldom holding office longer than three years and often holding for shorter periods. The Directors were re-elected more permanently. H. T. Colebrooke retained his position for fourteen years till his death in 1837, and his successor, Professor H. H. Wilson, for 23 years till his death in 1860. Similarly with the other officers. The practice was to re-elect them year by year as long as they were willing to serve ; and thus some of the Treasurers, Secretaries, and Librarians retained their duties for many years, as will appear from the lists of officers in the Appendix. This was the time of the great Cuneiform discoveries. Tavernier, Chardin, Niebuhr, and others had published copies of various Persian cuneiform inscriptions, and Grotefend, St. Martin, and others had deciphered some of the letters, but Major (afterwards Sir) Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, while resident in Persia, copied some of the most interesting cuneiform inscriptions, and especially the great inscription of Behistun, which contained matter new and more than all published before. Jle first communicated his discoveries in 1*838 to the Societv, and a memoir on them was received XVI HISTORY OP THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY from him in 1839. He promised his results to the Society, yet was anxious that they should not be published till completed ; but the labour occupied years, and meanwhile Botta, Layard, and others were augmenting cuneiform acquisitions at Nineveh and Babylon, and scholars were studying them. In 1844 Bawlinson had solved the problem of thoir decipherment. His results were announced in 1816, and Volumes X and XI of the Journal were assigned to them. Parts I and II of Vol. X were published in 1846-7, but Part III not till later. The Journals became somewhat irregular then, because of delay in these cuneiform contributions, and the particulars are partially cleared up in the Obituary Notice of Rawlinson. Vol. XI was issued in part in 1850, and more material appeared in Vol. XII the same year. His results were doubted, and there was a great wave of incredulity for a long time, but the Society lent him its influence and opened its purse ; and the romance of his discoveries captivated general opinion about 1849. The Society as their main introducer to the public became the centre of a great literary movement, the most eminent men, headed by the Prince Consort, attended its meetings, and the publication of Rawlinson's results was subsidized by a national grant of 500 in 185 L and again in 1852. Vol. XIV was also reserved for this matter, and was published in part in 1853. Vols. XI and XIV, however, were never completed. The former, containing Rawlinson's ancient Persian work, was left unfinished, because the important discoveries made at Nineveh placed in his hands an immense amount of new material while the Persian inscriptions had been fully investigated. The great labour of investigating the new material prevented him from continuing the volume, and he was of opinion that its subject had been exhausted by other students. Vol. XIV on the Assyrian and Babylonian inscriptions was interrupted by his departure on an important MAJOR-GENERAL SIR HENRY CRESWICKE RAWLINSON. Director, 1862-95; President, 1869-71 and 1878-81. [To face p. xvi. HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY XV11 Government mission to Persia, the duties of which and the laborious task of editing and publishing the Assyrian and Babylonian inscriptions in the British Museum proved an irremovable obstacle to continuing the volume. He was persuaded that, considering the very great advances made in the study since the first part was printed, any attempt to com- plete the volume would result in a very unequal patchwork. The Council therefore issued printed notices, apparently in 1861, to be bound up with the published parts of these two volumes, explaining why they were left incomplete. Notwithstanding the interest aroused by those discoveries, the falling off in the membership continued. The Rules were revised in 1850 : further elections of \" foreign \" and \" corresponding \" members were abolished ; \" honorary \" membership was instituted instead for distinguished men ; non-resident members who came home would pay only the non-resident subscription unless they resided in or near London ; new non-resident members paid only one guinea and received the Journal ; and informal evening meetings were held soon afterwards. A prize offered in 1856-7 for a version of the inscription of Tiglath Pileser I drew four essays, which were published in the Journal, but a prize of 300 offered by Dr. John Muir in 1857 for the best account of the Vedanta philosophy attracted no competition. In 1858 papers were rare, articles about India being given to other Societies, and the local Asiatic Societies in the East appropriated local research that might otherwise have come to the Royal Asiatic Society ; and, though the China Branch at Hong Kong, founded in 1847, died of inanition in 1859, yet the North China Branch was inaugurated at Shanghai by the Rev. Elijah Coleman Bridgman in 1857 and was vigorous. The number of members paying annually sank nearly to 140 in 1859, the general activities of the Society were partially paralysed, and the Translation Fund and the Committee f\\i Correspondence fell into neglect. It seems also that the character of the Society was changing, xviii HISTORY Otf THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY for on the one hand the practical aims and efforts to aid commerce, with which it started, tended to become exhausted, and on the other hand it was developing more towards learned research which hardly interested the public in their general ignorance of Oriental studies. The transfer of India from the East India Company to the Crown after the Mutiny had also a prejudicial effect, and the Company's yearly subsidy of 200 guineas, which the Government continued at first in 1859, was reduced to half later that year, while the Society's house cost nearly 400 yearly, as it had relied on the permanence of that support. In these circumstances, an effort was tried by a Circular to make the Society better known, and some members who had compounded gave temporary assistance to the funds in 1861. The East India Company had for some years grown indifferent about its museum of products, and Dr. Royle, its custodian, died in 1858 ; so the Society sought to remedy the decay. It reconstituted its Committee of Agriculture and Commerce in 18G1 ; the Committee of Correspondence was revived, the Oriental Translation Committee showed some activity, and the Journal was again issued quarterly that year. The extinction of the East India Company's munificent patronage, however, depressed Oriental studies, and was deplored, yet the Society made representations and regained heart when the Government restored the full 200 guineas subsidy in 1861. The Rules were amended in 1862. Honorary members received the Journal and were made admissible to the Council and its offices, the Journal began to notice works of merit published on Oriental subjects, and further exchanges of publications were arranged with other learned institutions. Sir Henry Rawlinson was chosen as Director in 1862, and held the office for thirty-three years till his death in 1895 ; and the interest in cuneiform discoveries was such that the membeis of the Society generally requested him at the meetings to give them the latest results of cuneiform research. HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY xix Hitherto the Secretary had been assisted by a clerk, but in 1863 the two positions and salaries were combined, and Professor Eost became the new Secretary. The measures taken gradually restored something of the Society's vigour, and were reinforced by the interest displayed by the Founder's son, Sir T. E. Colebrooke, during his Presidency in the years 1864 to 1867. Volume XX of the Journal was published in 1863, and in 1865 the Society began a new series of the Journal in similar volumes, the vignette on the front page retaining the banyan-tree and motto, but omitting the elephant and this has continued to the present day. The volumes of the new series were numbered up to XXI of 1889, but since then the numbering has been discarded, and the volumes are distinguished by the year. The Sanskrit Text Society was instituted at the same time, in order to diffuse an interest in Sanskrit literature. The lease of the Society's house, 5 New Burlington Street, neared its end, and, as the fresh terms proposed were unfavour- able, the Council took the upper portion of 22 Albemarle Street on a 23 years' lease, and held its 46th annual meeting there in May, 1869. The change saved about 70 yearly. The library, which continued to grow from year to year, was housed there, but the museum could not find room there. The East India Company's museum had been removed to a Government building about 1860, and the Society's museum was transferred to the India Office temporarily. It may be mentioned that the Suez Canal was formally opened in November, 1869, and the Society was invited to be represented at the ceremony. It appointed a delegate, but unfortunately illness prevented him from proceeding there. It would be interesting to investigate what influence that event may have had on the history of Oriental research. The Council had taken notice of the neglected state of ancient Hindu monuments in 1844, and prayed the East India Company that drawings and descriptions of them might be prepared. That was approved, but little was done. XX HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY In 1861 General Alexander Cunningham drew attention thereto, and the Government appointed him to survey all the principal sites in North India, and in 1870 to make a general archaeological survey. The Statistical Department of India was instituted in 1871, with Mr. (afterwards Sir) William Hunter as Director-General of it. In 1872, Dr. Burgess started the \" Indian Antiquary \". Archaeological research was thus developing there. Interest in Oriental studies in England, however, was, small then, and a decline in the Society's fortunes set in after 1868. This seems to have been partly due to the starting of numerous periodicals and reviews, which remunerated scholars and writers for articles and so obtained valuable contributions, while the Society received less important articles, and so its Journal lost in public interest. The sale of the Journal brought in some income till 1864> but then it seems the publisher undertook all the risks, and kept all the surplus copies, and the Society received practically no profit for twenty years. A committee was appointed in 1871-2 to increase the usefulness of the Library, which had grown steadily and has always grown, chiefly by gifts, for the sums that the Society could spend on it were small. The written catalogue was revised, and a descriptive list of MSS. prepared. The Society was gratified in 1872 in that Cambridge established two new Triposes, Semitic and Indian, and it appealed to Oxford for a more efficient chair of Semitic languages. In 1873 the Society attained its fiftieth year, and the Annual Report briefly reviewed its principal achievements, which (it declared) interested the scholar, improved our knowledge of India and its past ages, and provided materials useful to the legislator and statesman. The second International Congress of Orientalists was held in London in September, 1874, and the Society's rooms were its headquarters. Yet the decline continued, and the Society reached its lowest ebb in 1876 with only about 140 paying members. The PROFESSOR SIR MONIER MONIER-WILLIAMS. j4 Vice-PresidenL HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY XXI Oriental Translation Fund had come to a stoppage, and the Committees of Correspondence and of Agriculture and Commerce seem to have fallen into disuse. Mr. Vaux was appointed Secretary in 1877, and also editor of the Journal, and then the tide turned through his ability and assiduity, and the members rose again. More interest in the literature of the East began to be manifested among the educated, which was apparently due in no small measure to the stimulating lectures and writings of Professor Max Muller. The Journal of 1876 contained a long account of all Oriental work done, and that feature was repeated till 1886. A catalolgue of the Chinese works in the library was prepared in 1880. The old arrangement by which the Society published its Journal at its own cost was re-established about 1884 ; it stocked and sold its own publications, and since then the profit from the Journal has been a steady item of income. Sir John McNeill, the last of the Original members, died in 1883. The growth of the Society has been almost continuous from that time, and it has drawn in other Societies. The Asiatic Society of Japan, which was established about 1875, became affiliated to it, and the newly formed Straits Asiatic Society became the Straits Branch in 1878. Lastly, the Korean Branch of the Society was founded in 1900-1. Professor Monier Williams greatly stimulated Oriental learning by founding the Indian Institute at Oxford in 1884, and in consequence largely of his advocacy the Honour School of Oriental Studies there was established in 1886. For many years the Council had supported a proposal for an Indian museum, which might be combined with some advantage to the Society, as it did in 1861 after the Govern- ment took over the library and museum of India House. The Society's museum was removed from the India Office to the Victoria and Albert Museum at South Kensington, and it protested in J879 against the suggestion that the collection of Indian objects should be broken up, but it seems XXli HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY that, while the greater part of the Society's contribution (some 290 articles) have been retained there, some objects have been transferred to the Bethnal Green Museum and some, perhaps, to the British Museum. The improvement in the Journal was continued by Vaux's successor, General Sir F. J. Goldsmid, in 1886, who introduced into it the useful \" Notes of the Quarter \", giving varied information about Oriental matters. Among the Notes appeared miscellaneous communications under the sub- heading \"Correspondence\" in 1886, which was constituted a distinct and large heading in 1888. Obituary notices, which had been all included together in the annual reports, were now published separately every quarter. Professor T. W. Rhys Davids, who had founded the Pali Text Society in 1881, next became Secretary and Editor in October, 1887, and held the office till September, 1905. Under his long and scholarly care the quality of the Journal and its articles improved further. The elaborate accounts of Oriental work in the Journal were discontinued, and \" Reviews \" of books dealing with Oriental subjects took their place in 1888. Since then there has been no lack of valuable papers, contributed by scholars at home and by others who have acquired intimate knowledge of Eastern countries by long service there. The Journal has appeared every quarter, and has risen to acknowledged excellence with a wide and attractive range of subjects. The Rules were revised in 1888. The distinction between \" resident \" and \" non-resident \" was modified for future members. Residents henceforth were only those who had a residence or place of business within fifty miles of Charing Cross, arid all others were non-residents. The yearly sub- scription due from the former remained three guineas, but that from the latter was raised to thirty shillings. Provision was also made for electing \" extraordinary \" members from among Oriental diplomatists who would take an enlightened interest in the Society. An Index to all the publications from the HISTORY OP THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY xxiil beginning was compiled out of all the annual indexes and issued in 1888, and it included authors who wrote in \" Asiatic Researches \". Libraries were permitted in 1889 to become subscribers to the Journal, and steadily availed themselves of the option, until they number fully 165 at the present time. Professor Sir M. Monier-Williams urged in 1890 the need of a uniform system of transliteration for Oriental languages, and the Society through its Transliteration Committee induced the Tenth International Congress of Orientalists at Geneva in 1894 to approve a scheme ; and it has come into general use since then. Lists of important MSS., Malay, Persian, Arabic, Tibetan, arid Burmese, were prepared in 1892, and catalogues of the books and pamphlets in the library were printed the next year. Lord Reay was elected President in 1893, and held the office by re-election for nearly thirty years, to the Society's great benefit, till his death in 1921. During the past thirty years tne society's position has been one of stability, expanse, and influence, so that it has been able to propose or undertake various beneficial projects and enterprises. Thus it has advocated the promotion of Oriental studies in the Universities, and the necessity of founding a school for them in London w r as urged in 1894 and pressed from time to time. The Society, while it honoured foreign scholars by electing them as Honorary members, had no means of rewarding British erudition, and so proposed in 1897 to establish, in honour of Queen Victoria's Jubilee, a Fund to award a gold medal to a distinguished British scholar every third year. In this Mr. (afterwards Sir) A. N. Wollaston took a leading part. It was welcomed, money was subscribed, and the first medal was awarded to Professor E. B. Cowell that year. The requisite capital, the \" Gold Medal Fund \", of 300 was secured in 1900 under a trust deed. A further contribution of 1,225 was received from India that year, and was halved in 1903 to form two funds, the \" Prize Publications Fund\" and the \"Public XXIV HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY Schools' Gold Medal Fund \", the income from the former defraying the publication of works of original research, and that from the latter providing a prize medal for an essay on some Indian or Oriental subject to be competed for yearly among boys of the Public Schools, so as to interest Public School boys in our Indian dominions. The subsequent Gold medallists have been Dr. E. W. West in 1900, Sir William Muir in 1903, the Kev. G. U. Pope in 1906, Dr. (now Sir) G. A. Grierson in 1909, Dr. J. F. Fleet in 1912, Mrs. Agnes Smith Lewis and Mrs. Margaret Dunlop Gibson jointly in 1915, Mr. Vincent A. Smith in 1918, and Professor H. A. Giles in 1921. The Schools' prize medal was awarded first in 1904, and every year since then. It has been won by Eton College five times, by Merchant Taylors School four times, by Denstone College thrice, and by Harrow, Eugby, Marlborough, and other schools once each. Six books have been issued under the Publications Fund. An attempt to resuscitate Oriental translations was made in 1890, but failed. A new \" Oriental Translation Fund \" was then generously started by Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot at his own cost in 1891, supplemented afterwards by Lord Northbrook and Mr. E. T. Sturdy, and he conducted it, publishing eleven volumes before his death in 1901. He then made over the whole enterprise with some additional money to the Society, and since then the Society has managed the Fund, using the proceeds of the sale of the translations issued to defray further publications. Twenty-nine volumes have thus appeared. In order to encourage research and augment knowledge the Society introduced the \" Monograph Fund \" in 1902, and bore the cost of printing the first work by Colonel G. E. Gerini (jointly with the Royal Geographical Society), and the whole cost of the second work. Since then the Fund has been self-supporting, the receipts from the sale of published books providing the means of printing fresh treatises. It has issued eighteen volumes. In 1901 the Council laid before the Government of India THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD REAY. President, 1893-1921. [To face p. xxiv, HISTORY OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY XXV a carefully thought out scheme for the yearly publication of an \" Indian Records Series \", to contain the material documents out of which a history of India may eventually be constructed. The Government assented, and further approved in 1903 a detailed list of suggestions as regards the first volumes to be published. The eleventh International Congress at Paris in 1897 suggested that an International Association for the archaeo- logical exploration of India should be founded. This was worked out by a committee, and approved by the British Government with certain conditions ; and was followed by the establishment of the Archaeological Department in India. The Congress held at Rome in 1899 accepted the scheme, and advocated the collection of funds for it. The English and other national committees were constituted the next year, and contributions here were received by the Society. These amounted to 218 in 1916. As international co-opera- tion was impossible then, this sum was devoted to research on the Nalanda site. At the Congress held at Hamburg in 1902, the Society's office was declared to be the permanent bureau of the organizing authorities of such Congresses in future, since it was the only Oriental Society that had an office. An Index to the Journals of 1889 to 1903 was published in 1904, and Miscellaneous Notes took the place of \" Corre- spondence \" in the Journal at the same time. Miss C. Hughes (now Mrs. R. W. Frazer) was appointed in March, 1905, to succeed Professor Rhys Davids as Secretary and editor when he resigned in the following September, and under her gracious direction the Journal suffered no diminution. Dr. Codrington drew up a catalogue of the Society's pictures, busts, and other art possessions in 1916. King Edward announced that his Coronation would take place in July, 1902, and many Chiefs and Princes of India came to England to attend it. The Society celebrated the occasion by arranging a banquet in their honour in London XX Vlll HISTORY OF THE HO YAL ASIATIC SOCIETY a medal to be awarded on conditions that are yet to be laid down. The seventeenth International Congress of Orientalists, that was fixed to be held at Oxford in 1915, became impossible; but the Oriental Societies of the Allied nations, France, Britain, Italy, and the United States, arranged to meet in joint sessions every year, and the first sessions was held under the Society's auspices in London in 1919. The Society attained its hundredth year on 15th March, this year, and now welcomes them to participate in its Centenary celebrations in July.

PREFACE TO THE INDEXES The main portion of this Centenary Volume consists, as decided by the Council, of Indexes, in which are mentioned all the articles and miscellaneous notes (except notes of no permanent importance) that have been published during its hundred years' exisioncp in the Society's Periodicals, the Transactions (from 1827 to 1833) and the Journals (from 1834 onwards), together with the names of all the authors. The material is dealt with in two ways, according to regions and according to authors, so that the former method brings together for each region all that has been published about it, and the latter shows what each author has contributed. In the first two Indexes the whole field of the Society's researches is divided according to regions or countries, and, since the articles and notes relating to India are almost as copious as those of all the other regions combined, all those regions have been placed together to form the first Index, and India itself fills the second Index. In the former the regions are arranged alphabetically, and under each are placed, chronologically, all the articles and notes that relate to it. In the latter all the material regarding India has been divided into large \" subject-heads \" and the minor \" States \" included within its bounds, these heads and States are arranged alphabetically, and under each are brought together, chronologically, all the articles and notes concerning it. The third Index sets out alphabetically the names of all the authors, whose articles or notes appear in the first and second Indexes, and under each name is collected, chronologically, all that he contributed. The notes are distinguished from the articles by the sign prefixed to them. Articles and notes sometimes deal with more than one region or one subject, and in such cases they are entered either under the several regions or subjects or under the main region or subject, according to the importance of their i 2 PREFACE TO THE INDEXES references, or otherwise under a general head \" Sea, geography, travel, and commerce \" in Index I, or \" Trade and commerce \" in Index II. Further, articles and notes sometimes occur, which are general in their scope and cannot be definitely assigned to any particular region in Index I or subject in Index II, and for them a heading \" Miscellanea \" is provided in both Indexes, but its scope is quite different in the two Indexes, because the system of classification in the Indexes is altogether different. The ancient condition of Western Asia was wholly diverse from its modern condition, because, mainly, of the conquests of Mohammedanism ; hence the rise of that power has been taken as a dividing epoch, all prior thereto being classified as \" ancient \", and all posterior as \" modern \", in Palestine and Syria, Mesopotamia and Persia. In India also the Mohammedans introduced a wholly new age ; hence the beginning of their serious invasions, about A.D. 1000, has been treated as a dividing epoch there also, and the subjects of geography, Hinduism, history, and linguistics are separated into \" ancient \" and \" modern \". In the first two Indexes authors are cited merely by their initials and surnames, omitting all titles and honours. This has been found convenient for simplicity and uniformity, to avoid the variations that occurred as authors rose in rank or honours, with a few exceptions where the initials are not known. This simplification is compensated for in the third Index, where to each author's name is added (as far as known) his title and the highest dignity attained to by him. The Journals record the deaths of the Society's distinguished members and contain obituary notices of them. When they have contributed to the Journal, the obituary is noted by the letters \" Ob.\" at the end of their list of contributions in Index III ; but in not a few cases, they made no contributions and so would not appear in the Index, yet, since they were accorded such a mark of distinction and remembrance, they have also been admitted to the Index' and the obituary noted. EXPLANATIONS 3 The volumes are cited according to the years when they were published, so as to reduce the Transactions (1827-33), the Journal (1834-63), the Journal in the New Series (1865 onwards), which was numbered till 1889 by volumes and afterwards by the year, all to one uniform system. Volume XIV of the Old Series was published long after its proper time without any year stated on its title page and so can be cited only as XIV.
