According to a confidential document from the Office of Policy and Plans, the purpose of the visit was “to discuss matters of mutual interest to Iran and the U.S.”\n\nRichard Nixon first met the Shah in 1953 when he visited Tehran as Vice President. A friendship developed between the two leaders that lasted until the Shah’s death in 1980.\n\nIn May of this year, the Nixon Foundation held an event to commemorate President Nixon’s visit to Iran in May 1972.
