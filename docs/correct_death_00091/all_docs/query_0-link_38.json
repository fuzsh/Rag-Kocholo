Today in Iran both culture and common sense are undergoing change. This book examines that transformation, particularly the part played by religion. The focus is on religious education, both learned and popular, and its function in molding character and thereby reinforcing the common sense. 'This function is what the Greeks called paideia, and what today we might call the anthropology of education, taking \"education\" in its broadest sense. Paideia, or the anthropology of education, should include a series of questions critical to understanding how common sense changes: intellectual questions (about the organization of culture, the filiation and sponsorship of ideas), sociological questions (about the interest groups and power relations that cause ideas to succeed or be popular at one time rather than another; about the recruitment, training, and employment of culture carriers), and historical questions (about the reorganization of culture through new goals and new institutions). The contemporary change in Iran exhibits parallels to and differences from modern European and American history. The parallels lie in the challenge of science and technology to religious fundamentalism and in the changes in social consciousness encouraged by modern education and a more modern class structure or division of interest groups. The differences result from'the suppression of the ConstitutioGal Revolution at the turn of the century and a return, from 1925 to 1978, to an authoritarian, albeit modernizing, monarchy, as well as from a still very underdeveloped industrial economy and a demographic explosion. This last means an infusion into the national 'political arena of a very young population\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nPre/ace\n\nimbued with a popular religious culture and an enthusiastic attitude toward modern technology. The young people coming into the modern labor market from the villages and towns of Iran, literate and with modern education, retain a profound respect for Islamic morals and tradition, if not necessarily for the scholasticism of their religious leaders. Their cultural identity is rooted in the past, their vision turns toward the future. The social and cultural contradictions and tensions of modern Iran were dramatically catapulted into international attention by the 19771979 revolution, which ousted the Pahlavi dynasty. The revolution drew on two legacies: the repeated attempts at a bourgeois revolution (1905, 1952), and the repeated use of religiously phrased protest. The factions joining in the revolution disagreed sharply over the ultimate goals and definitions deriving from the Islamic and secular legacies. It is particularly with the religious legacy that this book is concerned, and more generally with the transformation of the Islamically informed consciousness of the majority of Iranians. The town of Qum is the focus of study because it is Iran's university town for religious leaders. Even if much of what is taught there is denigrated by some of the youth as scholasticism, it is nonetheless the central reference point for the elaboration of other interpretations of Islam held by the various segments of the population. Chapters 3 through 5 of this book have circulated since 1976 under the title' 'The Qum Report.\" They remain essentially as written at that time: a portrayal of pre-1978 Iranian Shi'ism under a monarchy that tried to repress it. Qum has a particular mystique. It is a repository of the Shi'ite tradition, a center of conservatism rejected by many Iranians and lauded by others; and it served as a focus of opposition to the shah on moral grounds. The atmosphere of Qum in 1975 was one of siege and courageous hostility to a state perceived to be the stronger, but morally corrupt, opponent. The ambience was picturesquely and symbolically marked in the garb of past centuries still worn by the religious leaders: the turban, beard, qaba and 'aba (under- and over-cloaks), and open-heeled slippers. Under Reza Shah Pahlavi (1925-1941) this traditional dress was forbidden to all except the clergy, in part a concession and in part a marking for slow destruction of what Reza Shah found backward and repugnant. The research on which The Qum Report is based was conducted in Iran during 1975 as part of the Islam and Social Change Project of the University of Chicago, under the direction of Professors Leonard Binder and Fazlur Rahman. Funding was provided by a Ford Foundation grant. Professor Shahrough Akhavi, a research partner in Iran, is preparing a complementary volume. In 1977 chapters 1 and 2 were added and the title was changed to \"Persian Paideia\" to focus attention not only on the traditional education system of the madrasa (Islamic seminary or college), which is rooted in a common tradition with our own Western traditions, but also on Shi'ism\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nas a moral tradition, as a nationalist tradition, and as a pedagogy of the oppressed. Its powerful psychological ambivalences-the dialectic between reliance on both reason and faith, between adoration and hatred of the West, between assertion of dignity and fear of inferiority-is not unlike the similar economic, psychological, and cultural dominations analyzed by Frantz Fanon, Abdullah Laroui, O. Mannoni, and Albert Memmi. That paideia is a Greek rather than a Persian word was appropriate to the long-standing debate between Iran and the West, honored in the madrasa curriculum through the continued study of the peripatetic philosophers and the response found to them in the Persian mystical philosophies of illuminationism (ishraql). (The title was as well a tribute and an aspiration to emulate in a small way Werner Jaeger's magisterial Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture.) In February 1979 chapter 6 was added to sketch the Shi'ite symbolic structure of the revolution. Fuller studies of the revolution will be needed in the future to sift out the many enigmas and premature interpretations behind what has been watched on television by a fascinated world. One thing is reasonably certain: Iran will continue to be a model, in the 1980s as it has been in the 1970s, for thinking about the developing world. In the 1970s the country was a major test case for modernization theory. It was the case where the constraint of capital theoretically was removed and which therefore was thought to have the best chance of relatively rapid transformation from a third-world country into the modern industrial first world. Many reasons will be adduced for the failure of this model in Iran. Among them are what I have playfully called the \"oriental despotism paradox\": the contradiction between using top-down \"directed social change\" to speed development and protect against reaction, and the local level initiative and commitment on which self-sustained growth eventually depends. The paradox is trying to suppress and stimulate local initiative at the same time. Oil revenues essentially made the government independent of any need to be directly responsive to its citizenry. In the 1980s Iran will continue to be a major test case of conditions of rapid social change and demographic explosion (half the population is under seventeen), where people feel themselves oppressed by an alien culture or world economy and use their traditional religious and cultural heritage as a vehicle of moral protest. What is at issue is the construction or reconstruction of a meaningful world in which people do not feel devalued by an alien culture, but can feel a sense of continuity with their own past and feel proud of their identity. My interest in going to Qum grew out of an earlier research project in the town of Yazd during 1969-1971, a crucible of four major religious traditions of Iran: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Bahaism, and Islam. In describing those four groups of people and their traditions, I wanted further to pursue Iranian Shi'ism to one of its pedagogical centers-as I had pursued Zoroastrianism to Bombay, Surat and Nausari in India-\n\nx\n\nPre/ace\n\nnot only because Islam was a multilayered and complex tradition, which could reward a lifetime's study, but primarily because Shi'ism was a powerful social force passively mobilized against the shah and critical to any understanding of the future social dynamics of Iran at the local level. The empirical field report, \"Zoroastrian Iran between Myth and Praxis\" (Fischer 1973), dealt with all four groups; the title was.intended to underscore the construction of Iranian identity from its roots in a pre-Islamic Zoroastrian empire to its aspirations for the future. Religion, I had been trained to believe, provided a reservoir of symbolic terms people could use to create a meaningful world. Despite the powerful currents and antagonisms, Yazd and Iran in 1970 were symbolically stagnant: it was a world of myth not action. Praxis, Aristotle's term popularized by Marx, was an action which changed its agent, as opposed to poesis (of which mythos was one form), a fabrication which leaves agent and object separate. In 1970 Iran was poised for praxis. To be sure there was social change, and the shah attempted to elevate the Zoroastrian heritage into a nationalist symbolism, but the Islamic clergy (u/ama) effectively blocked it from becoming a mobilizing vehicle: it was merely myth. In 1977-1979 an Islamic praxis began; wherever it leads it will probably leave Iranian Muslims and Shi'ism, as well as Iran, changed. The new constitution calls for territorial integrity, Islamic brotherhood of all men, political and economic unification of all Muslims, and establishment of Ja'fari or Twelver Shi'ite Islam-as well as other goals of social justice and internal organization: enough contradictions to generate lively debate for some time to come. Many people have helped in the preparation of this study and in formulating my thinking. Special thanks are owed to my research assistant, Mehdi Abedi, a member of the young revolutionary generation, who in the final three months of the field work guided me expertly through the thickets of Shi'ism and the social networks of the ulama. He is responsible for much of my enthusiastic appreciation for Islam, an appreciation he had encouraged five years earlier during the previous field work in Yazd. Needless to say, although he served as a crucial soundingboard and helped mold my perceptions, he cannot be held responsible for my mistakes and misapprehensions. All of the Persian and Arabic texts and writings referred to have been translated with his help (and commentary). Appreciation is owed to various helpful people in the Iranian Ministry of Science and Higher Education, in the 'several city and provincial agencies in Qum, and in the Office of Religious Endowments in Tehran and Qum, especially the staff in Qum who helped me circumvent the redtape obstructions of their superiors. Above all, this research could never have been pursued without the aid\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nof the establishments of the three maraji'-i taqlid in Qum: Ayatullah Sayyid Mohammad-Kazem Shariatmadari, Ayatullah Sayyid Shahabuddin Marashi-Najafi, and Ayatullah Sayyid Mohammad-Reza GolpayeganL I am particularly indebted for the kind personal help I received from the first two and from Ayatullah Naser Makarem, Sayyid Hadi Khosrowshahi, Shaykh Mortaza Haeri-Yazdi, and Sayyid Shamin usSibtain Rizvi. For help on various parts of the manuscript, I am grateful to Shahrough Akhavi, Said Arjomand, Mangol Bayat-Philip, Anne Betteridge, Leonard Binder, Michele de Angelis, Dale Eickelman, Shmuel Eisenstadt, Byron and Mary Jo Good, William Graham, Nikki Keddie, Muhsin Mahdi, Margaret Mills, Jacques Waardenburg, Nur Yalman, and Marvin Zonis. My understanding of events described in chapter 6 and the epilogue gained much from numerous discussions with Ervand Abrahamian. To anthropologists and linguists, especially to Mary Catherine Bateson and William Beeman, my apologies for not sticking fast to a transcription of Persian as it is spoken. Because the subject matter has direct linkages to Arabic, the language of the Qur'an and of religious scholarship, it was decided to use a transliteration. Contemporary names have been left as Persians normally transliterate rather than according to the scholarly system - Taleghani rather than Taleqani - with some exceptions for consistency: thus Khomeyni because shaykh rather than shaikh is used. For help with the transliteration I am indebted beyond adequate words to Wheeler Thackston, Jr. Full diacriticals, for reasons beyond our control, are preserved only in the glossary. Nonspecialists should be forewarned that some of the diacriticals are crucial: rawda is pronounced rawza. Elaine Akhavi, in her passionate and intensely vital way, desperately wanted to share with Iranian Muslims the similar struggles which many East European Jews underwent in the last two generations. I hope this book, which she was not able to live to see, contributes to the dialogue she envisioned and conveys the sense of experiential reality she sought to capture in her art. I treasure her enthusiasm for chapter 3 of this book and her comment: \"Don't let them make you change a word.\" Finally and most importantly, two models and mentors have inspired and sustained me intellectually as well as emotionally for many years. In a number of ways, what follows about logic and- validation, about history and social differentiation, and about liberalism and religious meaning grows out of a deep and continuing dialogue with a geographer and historian, and with a mathematician and geodesist: my parents, Eric and Irene Fischer.

Throughout the past century, events and movements in Iran have provided some of the most cited examples for social theory. Ever since, at least: the Constitutional Revolution of 1906-1911, the forced modernization under Reza Shah Pahlavi, the nationalist anti-imperialist movement under the Mossadeq government and its repression under the Pahlavi restoration of the 1950-1970s. In the1960s and 1970s Iran was a major exemplar for thinking about theories of modernization. Limits on development due to scarcity of capital were said to be removed because of oil revenues, but at the same time Iran illustrated the distortions these revenues introduced. The enclave treatment of oil, with revenues going directly to state coffers-thus bypassing more stabilizing revenues produced by the taxation and representation of expanding sectors of enfranchised citizens in the new economy (the model of reform in nineteenth-century England, for instance)-led to an unstable authoritarian form of government not unlike other oil enclave formations in Nigeria, Venezuela, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and perhaps even the Soviet Union.! In the 1980s Iran became a major exemplar for theories about social revolution. It became a model for examining the changes in the possibilities for social revolution in the late twentieth century as contrasted with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conditions in Europe for the socalled bourgeois and proletarian revolutions theorized by Karl Marx, V. I. Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Antonio Gramsci, and the many builders of social democracy in Europe. The Iranian revolution was also a model that contrasted with the so-called peasant or Maoist revolutions of the mid-twentieth\n\nI\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxiii\n\ncentury, shifting attention back again from agrarian to urbanizing, industrializing, and knowledge-based social formations. Above all, Iran continues to occupy a unique place in the Muslim world, a continuing cynosure of attention and focus of constant commentary, much of it misconceived, stereotyped, or simply ill-informed. 2 The study on which this book was based originally circulated as The Qum Report, then as Persian Paedeia, before settling into a title amplified by the 1977-1979 revolution, Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution. It originally had two introductions with two different audiences in mind. One introduction addressed Iranians who had allowed me into their lives at a formative period in my own life, and who thus contributed to my own moral, philosophical, and political sense of self and purpose. The other introduction addressed my fellow Americans, academics, social scientists, and the well-educated, well-traveled, reading publics amid whom I grew up in the professional and bureaucratic classes of Washington, D.C., and in the academies of the University of Chicago, the London School of Economics, the Johns Hopkins University, and Harvard University. Publishers, being what they are, refused, of course, the very idea of double audiences. The Qum Report had a certain drawing power reflected in its \"from the front lines of political conflict\" title. First notices came in columns by Joseph Alsop in The New Yorker, and in the unacknowledged background to Bruce Mazlish's psychobiographical article on Ayatullah Khomeyni in New York magazine, which was done in the mode of his earlier path-breaking psychobiographies of nationalist leaders with origins not purely of the nations they came to represent and lead, thus psychologically playing upon powerful ambivalences, erasures, and purifications. My own effort to unpack the rhetoric, political uses, and power of Khomeyni's persona and charisma sought explanation in four Iranian frames of interpretation: biography, persona, politics, and gnosis. This approach insists on the interaction of multiple levels of explanation or interpretive framing (Fischer 1983). The second title, Persian Paedia, attempted to convey a broader sense of the civilizational and epistemological richness of a set of historical horizons in dialogue with \"the West\" (as well as \"the East\") even before the classical Greek worlds that are often taken to be foundational for Euro-American civilization. But it is, of course, the debate tradition (\"dispute,\" disputation, bahs), highlighted in the third and final title (common to all the scholastic religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, and Confucianism), that would provide much, but not all, of the language for the coming revolutionary process. Two other key media of the revolution, in addition to the literate and oral disputation technologies, were the social drama technologies, as well as the systematic techniques of symbol and paradigm formation and interpretive framing. Social drama unfolded in two temporal forms. There was a fourteenmonth temporality of \"the revolution proper,\" which, in their phases and dynamics, paralleled in very interesting ways the four bourgeois revolutions\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nschematized by Crane Brinton in his 1939 Anatomy of Revolution. Those phases could also be analyzed in terms the anthropologist Victor Turner proposed more generally for dramaturgical social processes, in which conflicts that initially seem unique, upon reflection display processual forms and phases. Turner was particularly interested in the periodic and generational conflicts that repetitively erupt within the building pressures and tensions of ongoing social structures. But he was later also interested in understanding similar cases under conditions when those social structures themselves begin to shift or become re-embedded within new, larger scale colonial and neocolonial conditions. One cannot, however, understand the fourteen-month revolution proper without understanding the century-long social revolution from the 1870s to the 1970s (which continues its slow pace today). This longer temporality of social revolution has quite interesting parallels with-as well as some important differences from-the account of social revolution that Marx sketched in his dramaturgical essay on the French revolution(s) in The Eighteenth Brumaire ofLouis Bonaparte, the essay that Claude Levi-Strauss said he reread before beginning any new writing project to tease out the longterm structural changes that underlie surface, nonenduring changes. Paradigms of symbol formation and interpretive framing-this centurylong social-processual revolution is narrated in quite different ways by different social actors, drawing upon alternative left, liberal, or Islamist genealogies (Fischer 1987, 1993). It is therefore critical also to focus attention on the rhetorical and symbolic paradigms used to recruit and mobilize the revolutionary process proper in the fourteen months from November 1977 to February 1979. These were drawn from symbolic forms central to certain of the class-linked religiosities of Iran. Among the most important is the Karbala Paradigm, which provided a psychology of stoic determination to fight for social justice even against overwhelming odds. The Karbala Paradigm is enacted in many public theatrical forms from the passion plays and processions of the first ten days of Moharram, to the framings of popular preachments or sermons (rawzas) used on many occasions throughout the year. Teenagers in religiously conservative communities enjoy imitating the styles and quirks of the most popular preachers, much like they would pop stars. Symbolic systems can be deep and enduring, but they are not static, nor do all segments of a society appeal to them in the same degree or in the same way. During the revolution, the mourning for Husayn was transformed into an active witnessing (marches, demonstrations, confrontations), and after the revolution the state and its charismatic leader, Khomeyni, tried to rechannel the witnessing back into more patient forms, less threatening to their own management of the gaps between promise and reality. Different classes or segments of society adopt different forms of religiosity, and one of the functions of religious language is to coordinate these differences, at times helping to align them, make them feel unified, and reduce the differentiations that otherwise serve as identifying marks of competition,\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxv\n\ndebate, dialogue, and differential sense of self and group among them. Theorists with little on-the-ground experience, who locate the difference in the Iranian revolution primarily in Shi'ism or Islam, are often led astray by an oversimplified account of religion or ideology when what they need is an appreciation of the internal divisions, competitions, and struggles for dominant interpretations of the symbols in play.\n\nTargeted Ethnography We can create a Husayn Sabzian with a wide angle lens who dissolves into his social background and becomes a statistical sample; or with a telephoto lens we can separate him from the background so that he stands out. Which is realism? .Through color, lens, frame, picture size, story line, acting, we create a reality different from the rest, and thus preserve our own interpretation.... Social realism in the Eastern bloc, neo-realism in Italy, magical realism in Latin America-all point to the fact that realism is not a singular . -Mohsen Makhmalbaf, \"Realism in the Whole ofRealism: On the Pretext ofReviewing Close Up, Directed by Abbas Kiarostami\"\n\nQum was a strategic site for the study of these rhetorical and symbolic paradigms, but it could not be the only ethnographic locus for this study. Qum was the seminary town of Iran for training religious leaders, an important node in the circuits of sending out preachers and imams around the country, a central router in exchanges among the establishments of the leading ayatullahs in Najaf (southern Iraq) and other parts of Iran, the second most important shrine town in Iran (after the tomb of the eighth Imam in Mashad), and-in accord with the fact that social power often comes from paradox or social tension-a mausoleum site for Persian royalty, particularly of the previous Qajar dynasty. As a town it provided a microcosm of social tensions in those between the seminarians and the town folk. It also played various roles in national politics, from the shrine providing a place of neutral refuge (bast) from pursuit by state authority, to gradually becoming, since thel920s, with Najaf in southern Iraq, the focal establishment of a religious counter-elite to the royal state. By the time I did the study in Qum, I had already lived for two and a half years in another conservative town, Yazd, in the center of Iran. Home to the largest population of village and traditional Zoroastrians, one of the oldest Jewish communities in Iran, an important Bahai community, Yazd was also another conservative center of Shi'ism passively mobilized against the Pahlavi regime-the current President, Ayatullab S. Muhammad Khatami, is the son of a former Ayatullab ofYazd, Ayatullab S. Abbas Khatami (Fischer 1973, 1990: 61-62). I had a sense of how both the social networks and the ideology of Shi'ism radiated out from Qum, in what ways Qum was quite different and distinctive from all other places in Iran, and how it was central to the tensions of all those other places. Moreover, my fieldwork in Qum was part of a larger comparative project on madrasas in the Islamic world. This project was designed to\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\npair an American research student with a native research peer. My companion in Iran was Shahrough Akhavi, an American educated dual citizen (Iranian and American) who did the complementary leg of the fieldwork in Tehran, the political capital ofthe country, where so many ofthe previous political science field projects had attempted to map the institutional structures and (in)stabilities of the Iranian state and of the society it attempted to govern and reform (Akhavi 1980; Bill 1972; Binder 1962; Cottam 1964; Zonis 1971; for a more recent update, see Brumberg 2001). The larger project was a comparative study ofmadrasas also in Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, and Turkey, directed by Fazlur Rahman and Leonard Binder. In the history of social science projects, thus, it lies between the team and area-study projects of the 1960s, and the multi-locale, multi-sited ethnographies that George Marcus and I promoted in Anthropology as Cultural Critique (1986, 2nd edition 1999). Many have been tickled by the final anecdote in this book, where I evoke a dialogue between Ayatuallah MohammadKazem Shariatmadari and Claude Levi-Strauss, albeit in the mode of reflecting upon my shortcomings as young research student and of humanist anthropology in a hard, practical world. This evocation, like the opening anecdote, of my debate with Ayatullah Beheshti stands for a chess-gamelike dialogue of position-taking both among the scholastic-religious traditions, and also between these historical, scholarly formations with the contemporary literary-critical readings and reflections of James Joyce, Jacques Derrida, Edmond Jabes, Emmanuel Levinas, and others, which I elaborate more fully in the sequel, Debating Muslims: Cultural Dialogues in Postmodernity and Tradition. Media Theory There is no lack of knowledge, said the guide, But then it is dispersed 'mongst all the folk. -Firdausi, Shahnameh\n\nIranian cinema has reemerged in the 1990s as the most talked about cinematic tradition on the international film festival circuits, replacing Italian neorealism of the 1950s, East European neorealism or surrealism of the 1960s, French New Wave of the 1970s, and Chinese fifth generation film of the 1980s. Cinema is of interest in its own right but also as one of a set of new activated media. Poster art, cartoons, graffiti, slogans, songs, and poetry also draw upon and reinvent older traditions of Iran and abroad. Together all these media create lively public visual and sound spaces. The cover of Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution shows one of the extraordinary posters from the Iranian revolution of 1977-1979, one that draws upon the Persian miniature tradition of painting, as well as upon Qur' anic and Biblical stories and imagery, and a rich tradition of satirical political cartoons. I hese posters vividly register the coming together of a contemporary hybridity composed with strands of Shi'ite imagery in a palate of green, black, 1\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxvii\n\nwhite (and red); of third world revolutionary imagery and poster-making in red, white, and black; and of commercial art styles from Hallmark card saccharine to heavy metal in psychedelic colors (Fischer 1989; Fischer and Abedi 1990: chapter 6; see now also Chelkovsky and Dabashi 2000). The posters are part of the small media-cartoons, graffiti, wall notices, banners, songs, slogans, couplets, poems-that helped fill visual and sound space: public maidans and demonstration routes, walls and billboards, building interiors and roadside exteriors. These cinematic and small media, in tum, playoff earlier poetry, parables and proverbs, short stories and novels, epic narrations (naqqali) and oral storytelling: reworking, commenting, layering; creating allusions and references, reminders and juxtapositions, memorials and immemorials (Fischer 1984,2001,2002). The transfers from oral-life worlds to literate ones to secondary or electronic oral ones are not relations of replacement, but postings back and forth across horizons and experiences. The sequel volume, Debating Muslims, registers this in its series of illustrations, beginning with the same poster from the front cover of Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution, but with inserted cameos of Sayyed Mahmud Taleghani and Dr. Ali Shariati, efforts by factions within the revolution to claim the legacies of these leaders of the 1970s, and to claim the legacies of both revolutions: 1977-1979, 18731979. The front and back covers of Debating Muslims juxtapose two images of Muslim debate: one from Meshkini's famous miniature painting of Noah's Ark (a hybridization of Mughal and Persian painting, Biblical and Qur' anic story [254]), the other a photograph of the two authors, one reciting while holding a copy of Firdausi's Shahnameh, the other recording, inscribing, listening. The juxtaposition signifies a dialogue of painting and photography, orality and literacy, Islamic and pre-Islamic, Iranian and American. The images are transforms: sage and king, sacred and profane, knowledge and power; cultural performer-guide-expositor and anthropologistrapporteur; Iran and Houston). The primary media of Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution are theatrical performance media. They include: processions, passion plays, and rawdas (preachments that were simultaneously entertainment, politically coded, and community-building); oral debates in madrasas disciplined by rules of inference, deduction, and chains of differentially trustworthy authoritative hadith and sunnat; spatial and protocol choreographies of shrines and Ayatullahs' reception rooms. Social dramas of revolution and of political struggle are also theatrical performance media. The \"Karbala paradigm\" (foundational story of Shi'ism of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn at Karbala) enacted the philosophical and emotional power and charisma of Shi'ism in contrast to Sunni interpretations of Islamic history. Deployment of the Karbala paradigm in the revolution also was an exemplar of the explosive power of symbolic or theatrical politics that a decade later would help, in secular forms, to push the former Soviet Union into implosion (Fischer and Grigorian 1993).\n\nxviii\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nEqually important to developments in the 1980s after the revolution were the devastations and the displacement of refugees across Iran from the eight year Iran-Iraq War, and the Russian invasion of Afghanistan (followed by American-Pakistani-Saudi supported guerilla war that drove the Russians out, followed then by a civil war, and the coming of the brutal, fundamentalist regime of the Taliban). These wars on the borders in Khuzistan, Kurdistan, and Afghanistan became subjects of Iranian films in the 1990s, films that challenged both the religiosity of the hard-line religious conservatives in Iran and the jingoism ofAmerican and Russian nationalisms with a quiet, stoical humanism (occasionally also, in quiet background cues, drawing on the Karbala paradigm in a more philosophical fashion), and recognizing both the importance and the limitations of that humanism (Fischer 2003). While there is a continuity between the New Wave cinema of Iran in the 1970s and the films of the 1990s, there are some interesting discursive and ethnographic differences. As part of the analysis of discursive class differences in the period leading up to the revolution of 1977-1979, it was useful to track the incomprehension between two intelligentsias. The so-called \"roshan-fekr\" or \"enlightened\" intelligentsia had its roots in, or drew for cultural purposes on, a village and traditional past, but its education, audience, and aspirations were in urban, secular and Euro-American arenas. It was a liminal stratum of the bourgeoisie caught betwixt and between. It had created a discursive tradition of surrealism, elaborated in the wake of Sadeq Hedayat's haunting and powerful short stories and his masterwork novella, Buf-e Kur (The Blind Owl). This \"surrealism\" differed from French surrealism: its distinctive Persian emotional and philosophical registers were used as vehicles for cultural politics, for allegorical and indirect political engagement. The alternative intelligentsia, from the religious madrasas and theological colleges, saw nothing in this discursive formation but nihilism. And in mirroring fashion the roshan-fekran saw nothing in the discourse of the politically engaged religious intelligentsia but repetitions of obfuscating akhunds. The religious leaders, however, understood the power of the media, and that for any real change in society, they needed to control and use the media. Cultural and media politics were high on the agenda of the revolution. Although in both the visual media of cinema and prose forms of short story and novel there was mutual incomprehension in the 1970s, after the revolution, when cinema revived in the mid 1980s, the cinematic tactics of the New Wave came to be wielded as a vital discursive thread of new story and image formation by such filmmakers as Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Abbas Kiarostami, Dariush Mehruji, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, Tahmineh Milani, Kianush Ayyari, Ebrahim Hatamikia, and younger directors at the tum of the twentyfirst century such as Bahman Qobadi, Marziyeh Meshkini, and Samira Makhmalbaf. These films participate in the shift that Gilles Deleuze has called the shift from movement-image to time-image, from plot driven genre film to more inventive film that experiments with the different sensory and\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxix\n\nperceptual dimensions of story-telling. Thus, interestingly, the war films from the Iran-Iraq War period do not focus on or demonize the enemy, but rather focus on the Persian themes of stoicism, self-care, and care for others (Sohrabi 1995). And, in general, traditional frames such as religion are only evoked as cultural resources, but the films themselves play with their own humanist narrations: constructing, deconstructing, trying alternatives, forging new stories. As Theodor Adorno argues in his book Aesthetic Theory, \"Artworks recall the theologumenon that in the redeemed world, everything would be as it is and yet wholly other\" (6). I call this \"filmic judgment and cultural critique: the work of art, ethics, and religion in Iranian cinema\" (Fischer 2001,2002,2003; see also Dabashi 2001; Naficy 2001). Cinema operates in transnational circuits, and the new media of the 1990s-the Internet and the increasing connectivity of satellite televisionbegan slowly also to have an effect both inside Iran and in further keeping the connections with Iranian diasporas live. One of the more interesting experiments was the Quixotic but effective initiative by California-resident Zia Atabay, journalist Ali Reza Meybodi, and satirist Ali Fakhredin (Ali Dean) as the irascible mulla \"Hajji,\" to air satirical, cultural, and call-in shows by satellite television (Lewis 2002). Iran responded by jamming the Eutelsat satellite, Hot Bird 5, which carried NITV, disabling the entire satellite jointly owned by French, British, Italian, German, and other European telecommunication companies. Further technological attack and counterattack ensued: to jam the signal, Iran needed to track the uplink, which was forwarded via a ground site in Germany. By moving the uplink to New Jersey, NITV could avoid the jammers in Iran. After the September 11,2001 attacks on New York's World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon in Washington, NITV called for Iranians to show solidarity with the U.S. by carrying candles into the streets. They did, and many were arrested for doing so. Because of the burn rate of capital, NITV will probably have to turn to a scrambled signal and subscription based business model. One wonders how NITV and rival satellite channels, some perhaps backed by the Iranian government, will add layers to the emergent civil society of Iran in the coming years.\n\nPersian Paedeia: Madrasas, Educational Systems, and Civil Societies Ayatullah Shariatmadari ... very patiently and good humoredly allowed me to elicit his genealogy. When I was done, he asked, with a wry twinkle in his eyes, \"Now about this science of anthropology, tell me: is it cooked or raw (pokhta ya napokhta) ?\" -Michael Fischer, Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution\n\nOne of the most important baselines \"to think with\" that this volume documents is a religious education system, out of which the Islamic revolution of Iran partly emerged, but that also stands in very sharp contrast to the fundamentalist madrasas of much of the Muslim world in the 1990s.\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nOne of the contributions of this volume, and its sequel (particularly the second chapter of Debating Muslims, \"Qur' anic Dialogics: Islamic Poetics and Politics for Muslims and for Us\"), remains the stress on the critical apparatus of the debate and disputation system of the madrasas. It stands in contrast to the rote learning said to characterize madrasas in other parts of the Islamic world (Eickelman 1978 on Morocco; Heffner 2000: 34 on Indonesia; see various documentary footage from Pakistan madrasas in the aftermath of September 2001, and the marvelous scene of an Afghan madrasa in Mohsen Makhmalbaf's fiction film Qandahar [2001]), and indeed in contrast to the rote learning that was promoted in parts of the secular educational system. (In some countries, madrasas at the primary level were given the task of teaching basic literacy. As such they were incorporated as feeders into the state systems and were part of the development strategies of the state and international literacy programs.) In Iran, the struggles over methods, tools of critical evaluation (from grammatical and rhetorical analysis to evaluation of sources and of contexts of enunciation), and new subject matters were features of both the madrasa system and the secular state systems. It was striking that the higher echelon religious teachers usually sent their sons to study at the universities, recruiting their new students rather from the lower classes in a system of upward mobility. Many of the new generation religious leaders had a dual education in both madrasa and secular university, and the best of their students were encouraged to do the same. Indeed, today the religious seminaries of Iran no longer admit students who do not first have high school diplomas. It is not accidental that the setting of a madrasa in S. Reza Mir-Karimi's fiction film Zir-e Nur-e Mah (Under the Light of the Moon [2001]) provides a contrast with the madrasa in Makhmalbaf's Qandahar. Mir-Karimi's film follows the ambivalences of a maturing student as he goes on a picaresque journey (meeting a series of people who advance the protagonist's understanding) among the homeless. These people sleep and eat in a makeshift camp under a bridge; however, they teach the young man about mutual care and support under the harshest of conditions, including the way that religion fits into life in a different way than his fellow students might imagine in their scholastic studies in the madrasa. The madrasa fits here in a very different point in the life cycle, educational sophistication, and moral growth than the madrasa pictured in Qandahar. For an American, it has echoes and possibilities of the social calling of the 1960s street ministries. It gestures, perhaps, as well toward the role of religious organizations in providing social services, which also has been an important part of the Islamic revival's political power in the Islamic revolution of the 1980s in Iran and elsewhere in the Muslim world. But here this social calling of religion is matured into a filmic space for individual moral development and for critical thought that does not fail to question religious authority and institutions by holding them up to the conditions of societal needs: a space of filmic judgment and cultural critique.\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxxi\n\nThe point here is not that the madrasas of the 1970s were already retooled for the modem world or ideal crucibles for critical thinking. Rather the point is that critical debate has grounds within Islamic scholarly traditions and is not just an import from the outside. Nor can the changes in the madrasa system be viewed in isolation even within Iran. Challenges came in terms of job preparation from the secular schools, but in intellectual and emotional terms as great a challenge came from charismatic lay religious reformers outside the madrasa system, of whom the most important was Dr. Ali Shariati. Shariati challenged students in both secular high schools and madrasas to think through the meaning of Islam in the modem world for themselves. He showed them that they could incorporate Western thinkers into their frames of reference without giving up Islam, that they could partake in debates on the world stage, not just within traditionalized worlds. The call to think for themselves, to not blindly follow ill-educated mullas, to read the sources for themselves-this was powerfully appealing to the literate young. Literacy freed them from mullas as gate-keepers of truth and knowledge, democratized argumentation, and empowered them as carriers of new ways of thinking within their families as well as in society at large. Like most leaders of Islamic modernist movements, Shariati was not a cleric. The call could be a double-edged sword: liberating for free and critical debate, but also easily slipping into slogans and ideological enthusiasms without internal dialectical, critical, or institutional checks. But in the 1970s, this felt to many of the students in the madrasas, as well as in high schools, to be a lesser danger than the closed worlds of the old madrasa curricula and madrasa institutions that had been under negative pressure from the state for decades. In the ensuing years, efforts have been made to use the new electronic media to make the critical apparatuses of the Shi'ism more easily searchable. A Computer Research Center in the Faiziyeh seminary has been making books and responsa ifatwas) available on CD-Rom, including word and subject indexes for books of philosophy, logic, and jurisprudence (jiqh). Web site construction is also under way (Hilsum 1998). As Jacques Derrida has argued in another context, such electronic media have the double-edged effect of both extending and undoing efforts at ideological dissemination. By contrast to this refreshing and renewing the work of the madrasas in tandem or in competition with high schools and universities (which themselves after the revolution were put through a \"cultural revolution\"), one striking feature of many parts of the Islamic world in the 1990s was the degree to which educational systems were allowed to devolve out of both state control and an environment of competition with secular schools, and into rote learning and mere Islamic indoctrination. Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia in the 1990s provide four striking contrasts to Qum of the 1970s as well as to their own national and transnational settings in the 1970s. In Malaysia, what was once a vigorous reformist youth movement led by Anwar Ibrahim, funded in part by the Saudi Islamic World Youth Organization, became integrated into the state\n\nxxii\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nstructure, and Islamization became the code for affirmative action for Malay (against Malaysian-Chinese). In the 1990s Malaysia became a site of novel privatization, transnationalization, and franchising of education (Lotfalian 1999). Indonesia's pesantrans, or Qur'anic boarding schools (given a classic account in Clifford Geertz's Religion of Java), have recently spawned some fundamentalist variants. In the aftermath of the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington on September 11, 2001, and President George W. Bush's war on terrorism, attention has been directed towards a large (1,600 students) pesantran in Solo, headed by Abu Bakr Baasyir, \"Abdus Samad,\" where members of the Southeast Asia-wide Gema'a Islamiyya militant network have trained, and made connections with the militant madrasas and fighting groups based in Pakistan. Baasyir was jailed during the 1980s for advocating an Islamic state, and his brother-in-law leads the Surakarta Islamic Youth Front that went through hotels in town after September 11 looking for Americans \"to protect them.\" Solo has been the site of communal riots in recent years, particularly the burning of Chinese properties. (On Islam and democratization and the spread of both pesantrans and madrasas across Indonesia as channels for rapid dissemination of modernist-Islamist ideologies in Indonesia, see generally Hefner 2000; but no good account exists of such radical pesantrans or madrasas aside from current journalism, e.g., Bonner and Mydans 2002; Bonner 2002; Perlez 2002.) Pakistan's Deobandi madrasas have received the most attention from journalists as Taliban and al-Qaeda preparatory schools for fighters in Afghanistan, and for militant groups in Kashmir and in Central Asia. In 2002 there were approximately six hundred thousand students in these schools, of whom seventeen thousand were Afghanis and sixteen thousand were Arabs, and another thousand were \"other foreigners\" (JehI2002). Described as performing an important social function of giving meals and shelter to Afghan refugee boys as well as to poor Pakistani village boys, and supported with Saudi funds (until these were cut off when the madrasas supported the attacks on Saudi Arabia for allowing American troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia), they are also described as having little pretense to teaching anything except rote memorization of the Qur' an and militant ideology. The connection of these Pakistani madrasas, primarily along the border with Afghanistan from Baluchistan to the Northwest Frontier, to the original Deobandi madrasa in Uttar Pradesh, India, founded in 1866, has been disavowed to the media by scholars associated with the latter, particularly regarding violence and jihad. The dars-i nizami curriculum as modified by the Deobandis is said to be fossilized with a prohibition against the introduction of any new texts written in the last two centuries. But while there may be no new texts of fiqh or usul, many religious and political tracts have been written, and the Deobandi movement has also factionated into at least two main streams. The anti-colonial, anti-Western, nationalist tendency led by Husain Ahmad Madni (1879-1957), which remained strong\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxxiii\n\nin Pakistan, has consistently sounded similar to current day rhetoric. Since the days of the anti-colonial movement, there has been a tradition of closing schools to let students take part in political demonstrations. In any case, these madrasas have been part of the cynical use of Islamic fundamentalism by the Pakistani state, the Saudis, and the United States. This has now turned savagely back upon the U.s. and contributed to the sectarian and class violence, and deterioration of education and civil society in Pakistan (Hoodbhoy 1991; Malik 1996; S. V. Nasr2001; Rashid 2000; Bonner 2002).3 The Deobandi madrasas, and the associated JUI (Jamiyyat-i 'Ulama-i Islam) party, are not the only madrasas or fundamentalist party influential in Pakistan. The JI (Jama'at-i Islami) party founded by Sayyid Abu'l-A'la' Mawdudi (1903-79), and now led by Qazi Husain, is a more modernistfundamentalist, and middle-class, reform movement. In recent years, the JI has expanded its own madrasa network and pursued a \"revolutionary\" cadre-style party structure among the elites of the bureaucracy and military, in addition to pursuing electoral politics. There is also the Ahl-i Hadith movement, which supports the militant Lashkar-e Taiba. Other important movements are the Tablighis, who have a strong base among small businessmen, and the Barelwis, who have a more sufi saint-and-follower organizational structure. Twenty years after the University of Chicago Islam and Social Change Project focused on the then Maulana Maudidi-inspired fundamentalist madrasas (M. Ahmad 1980; see also Rahman 1980), the militant madrasas today are said to have turned more violent and \"jihadist.\" (On the Pakistani madrasas connections to Central Asia, as well as the radicalization of Central Asian Muslims who served in the Russian army in Afghanistan, see Rashid 2002a, 2002b). In 2002, Pakistan, under the Presidency of General Pervez Musharraf, has announced policies to regulate and monitor the madrasas. A key dilemma is that pressuring the madrasas may generate strong resistance especially if nothing is done about the deteriorating state public schools. Saudi Arabia presents another kind of comparison and contrast with Iran. An oil producing rentier state, somewhat like, but with a different social structure than, Iran, money for Saudi citizens was not an issue in the 1980s, not an issue until after the Gulf War against Iraq, and even then it was primarily a long-term planning problem rather than desperation. The clearest comparison with Iran in the 1970s is the double-edged sword of success in raising literacy to over ninety-percent among the young generation, and increasing the number of university graduates from 2,500 in 1970 to 200,000 a year by the end of the 1990s, at least a third of whom cannot find jobs consonant with their sense of entitlement. These numbers are similar to Iran's twenty years ago, when 300,000 high school graduates sat exams for 30,000 places in university; the best and the brightest went to the U.S. for university education, or to Europe and India. The structural alienation and political discontent is similar. It is also similar, perhaps, to the universityeducated students recruited to the militant jama'at islamiyya groups in\n\nxxiv\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\n1970s Egypt. But Saudi Arabia (with tacit U.S. support) has allowed the educational system to be occupied by reactionary clerics. In the 1970s, conventional wisdom assumed that the more conservative Wahhabi clerics were being gradually marginalized in all institutions of the state, and being replaced by professional technocrats. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attack on the U.S. by fifteen Saudis and four others, attention refocused on the virulence of not only popular preachers and columnists in the state controlled newspapers, but also on what the public schools were teaching. Tenth-grade classes in public high schools nationwide, it was reported, are given a Ministry of Education textbook, Monotheism by Sheikh Salleh AI-Fawzan, full of violent anti-Christian and anti-Jewish interpretations of Islam. About Judgment Day, for instance, it proclaims, \"The Hour will not come until ... Muslims will kill all the Jews\" (Sennott 2001: AI). The alienation and militant calls for violent jihad are most intense in those areas bypassed by the economic boom of the 1970s, especially the southwestern areas along Highway 15, whence came twelve of the fifteen Saudi hijackers (of the nineteen total) who seized four commercial airliners on September 11, 2001, (the eightieth anniversary of the Caliphate's abolition, noted Osama bin Laden) flying two into the World Trade Center towers in New York and one into the Pentagon near Washington, D.C. (the fourth crashing in Pennsylvania) killing approximately three thousand civilians. The excuse that attacks on the U.S., Jews, and Christians are just a pressure valve in a country where political debate is minimal or indirect, has, as with the cynical use of Islam in Pakistan, turned to bite its sponsors. Indeed, Osama bin Laden taunted the Saudi leadership in his videotapes by repeatedly invoking the names oftribes-al-Shahri, al-Ghamdi, al-Hazmi-from which the hijackers came as if to signal that he could mobilize internal resentment against the regime and drive a wedge between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. The latter is a tactic like what the Iranian students used to great effect in taking the American hostages in order to stop any rapprochement between the interim revolutionary government and the U.S. (or the subordinating political-economic forces represented by trade with the U.S.). As much as the anger of this region may be directed towards the U.S., Jews, and Christians, it is also directed at the internal colonization within Saudi Arabia. The southwestern region is often denigrated by other Saudis as \"primitive,\" and the new five-star tourist industry in Asir is felt by locals to reinforce these inequities by providing only service jobs, making the locals servants to richer Saudi elites. 4 Highway 15, between Taif and Yemen, built by Osama bin Laden's father, is a favorite road for bored Saudi youths to race and crash their big American cars and a corridor for the passage of those involved in the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen and the bombers of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Saudi Arabian public schools are not madrasas, and it would be interesting to know what is taught in the seminaries that train the Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia, as well as their connections to the madrasas in Pak-\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxxv\n\nistan and to Central Asia. Educational systems are not just marginal institutions, but have powerful consequences for civil society, both national and transnational. It is crucial to understand that these militant educational settings do not represent Islam in general. It may seem ironic that the clearest way of making this point is to look closely at Iran's madrasas in the 1970s as described in this volume. Iran's madrasas described here were undergoing modernization in an attempt to compete with secular public and private high schools and universities. In the madrasas described here, I try to provide a feeling for how students were trained, how they were taught to analyze texts, how they sharpened their critical skills through arguing in pairs, and through engaging their teachers in debates. The term \"dispute\" in the title is crucial for the local sense of pedagogy, critique, and political stakes. I try to provide a comparative understanding of the disputation traditions in the medieval traditions of Christianity, the talmudic ones of Judaism (formed together with Islamic interpretive methods in Babylonia or today southern Iraq), and the Islamic ones of the Shi'ite madrasas. In the sequel, Debating Muslims, written with Mehdi Abedi, who was a research assistant for this volume as well, we extend the analysis by exploring both the debates between Dr. Ali Shariati and Morteza Mutahheri, and more importantly why Ayatullah Khomeyni was unable, by his own account, to show firm textual grounds for political rule by the clerics, and how he was forced instead to argue \"arbitrarily\" (with no firm textual authority) the intent of lines interpreted otherwise by tradition. In fact, Khomeyni's arguments drew from Western political theory as well as Islamic sources, just as his understanding of Islam drew from mystical as well as rational sources. (Hence the importance of understanding the powerful paradoxes of his persona and charisma analyzed in \"Imam Khomeini: Four Levels of Understanding\" [Fischer 1983].) As symbolically powerful is the remarkable fact that Ayatullah Ali Khamaene'i, who became the supreme leader (velayat-efaqih) after Khomeyni, is widely recognized not to have earned the title Ayatullah by traditional scholarly or institutional standards (technically, in 1970s language he was a Hujjat aI-Islam), and indeed many would argue that events have come to pass as Ayatullah Shariatmadari warned they might in this volume. And yet, the extraordinary aspect of the Iranian revolution is that, however glacially, the underlying demographic, educational, and generational dynamics have continued to push the revolution forward in a democratic direction. The election, twice now, of President Muhammad Khatami is a continuing powerful expression of this process, even if it is still blocked by powerful reactionary clerics who control the security and judicial systems and much of the parallel institutional structure. Iran may yet prove to be a leader in an escape from what has been a fundamentalizing direction of politics in the Islamic world where, in places other than Iran, Islamic welfare and fighting organizations have stepped into voids of the disintegration of state ser-\n\nxxvi\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nvices, and the creation of \"sacrifice zones\" outside the enclaves of wealth and transnational trade. This was the fear of the 1980s articulated by such intellectuals as the Palestinian Ibrahim Abu-Lughod (1966), the Moroccan Abdullah Laroui (1976), and the Pakistani Fazlur Rahman (1980). In the Iran of the 1970s, where less dire circumstances prevailed, and a more classic form of revolution unfolded, we can perhaps hope for a more Islamic liberal future. It is a different model and historical trajectory than the hopes for liberal Islam in other parts of the Islamic world: \"civil Islam\" in Indonesia (Heffner 2000), or a possible de facto pluralism and Islamic liberalism in Egypt constructed out of contending groups holding each other in check, rather than sudden procedural democracy or any of the other sudden \"solutions\" proposed by various contending ideologies (Binder 1988).\n\nTheories of Revolution and Social Changes The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living. And just when they seem engaged in revolutionizing themselves and things, in creating something that has never yet existed, precisely in such periods of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service and borrow from them names, battle cries and costumes in order to present the new scene of world history in this time-honored disguise and this borrowed language. -Karl Marx, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\n\nYou usually had two sorts of Arab operatives to deal with: one set acted as if having an agent from Iran was like having the Prophet's own right-hand man at the helm, while the other lot were pugnacious and sneering, treating the Persians as if the ancient battle of Qaddissiyah between the two races had never ended.... The man who had answered him in Persian said, \"He says you've come here to spy.\" \"Well, we all have to get to America somehow.\" ... \"He's a Pakistani. Another whiz from over there. They say if it had been his job the WTC building would have come undone in half a minute.\" -Salah Abdoh, The Poet Game\n\nIn my writings on the Iranian revolution, I sketched out a series of explanatory frames or models, which I thought needed to be factored together into multicausal models to help ask informed questions for continuing to monitor and make sense of an ongoing social process. Among these questions are those that consider generations of Islamic response to Westernization, colonialism or neocolonialism, the history of Iranian revolutions, the structural patterns of revolutions, the institutional dynamics of Shi' ism, and the social agendas being contested and proposed. The revolution of 1977-1979 was the fifth time since 1873 that an alliance of secular and religious forces had come together either to force a change in the political system or in major policy directions; it was the first time, however, that the religious forces were able to play the dominant partner.\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxxvii\n\nIn a comparative essay on Islamic movements over five generations from the 1870s to the 1970s and from the Maghreb, or North Africa, in the west to the Indian subcontinent in the east, I sorted through a class and generational analysis (chart 1). Organizationally, the Islamic movements of each generation provided both positive legacies and new problems for the succeeding generations. With renewed (and lay) ijtihad (interpretations for new conditions) and sociopolitical engagement in the eighteenth and nineteenth century came also a weakening of older evaluative skills, and as yet a lack of new technocratic ones. In the next generation of the modernist reformers (Afghani, Abduh), science and technology and tutelary democracy became slogans, but the political economy of dependency was severely underestimated, and an elitism vis-a-vis the lower classes was cultivated. In the mid-twentieth-century, neofundamentalism brought political organization of the masses and a kind of ademocratic populism (Muslim Brotherhood, Maududi's Jamiat-i Islam) with a continuing devaluation of traditional evaluative skills and a totalitarian anti-pluralist attitude towards those who were not members of the organization. In the post-World War Two generation, Islamic socialism brought ideals of economic reconstruction and social welfare as responsibilities of the state, but dictatorial means were reinforced and these decayed into corrupt authoritarianisms. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Islamic resurgence brought movements against corruption and searches for moral identity, but where these became instituted in states (Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia provide very different modes of established state Islam) there was an inability to live up to ideals ofjustice (renewed corruption), and a lack of clarity about strategies for the economy and social welfare. Within Iranian history over the past five centuries, a similar structural analysis of cleric-led struggles could be done sorting by factions, organizational form, and political engagement with the state (chart 2). Across the western Islamic world in the past century, there has been a shift of class power from the shahs, sultans, and upper elements of the patrimonial structures of the Safavid-Qajar-Pahlavi and Ottoman empires into the hands of the bureaucratic and petite bourgeois classes. The locus of the dramatic moments of these structural changes occurred in the politicized arenas of the big cities, where masses of urbanizing peasants and overeducated, underemployed, declasse bourgeoisie could be mobilized in demonstrations that had the power to constrain, if not change, political power. At times, as in the Iranian revolution, these became the sites to demonstrate that political and social power had already shifted. The comparative canvas allowed for a mapping of religiosities as they varied by class and social segment, and as they were reformatted and reformulated under changing conditions. Against this broad comparative canvas, the changes within Iran could be sketched with sharper focus. The earlier essay \"Islam and the Revolt of the Petite Bourgeoisie\" (Fischer 1982), was inspired both by Marx (the ideas of a social revolution across generations with organizational learning across countries and regions; structural changes being confirmed and legitimated\n\nxxviii\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nChart 1.

A later essay \"The Iranian Revolution: Five Frames for Understanding\" (Fischer 1993) sketched overlays of five structural temporalities or social dramatic forms of unfolding. Two of these were the five generational analysis and the five centuries of cleric-led struggles in Iran. The third reminds that revolutions have a processual form-they are not events, but unfold over time-and asks whether this revolution fits into the pattern of other revolutions. There were two temporalities of revolution as outlined above, and elaborated in Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution: a drama of a short (fourteen month) unfolding, and a structural process of a century-long unfolding. Neither are deterministic, both can have alternative paths and outcomes, and even retrospectively can be given alternative accountings, and recontextualizations. The fourth frame is the Shi'ite form of this revolution-the power of symbols and drama, rhetorical framing and persuasive cultural interpretations-which served as the mobilizing idioms. The fifth frame resides in the social agendas of the revolution, which are still two decades later being fought over, and which is why this book ended not with the triumphalism of the revolution proper, but with \"victory and its problems,\" with the challenges that the revolution had put on the public agenda for itself. These included political development, economic policy, social and cultural policy, and foreign policy. Concerning political development, it is worth recalling that the initial slogans ofthe revolution in 1977-1979 were: to implement the 1905 Constitution, to allow Parliament to be more than a rubber stamp, to implement the clause allowing mujtahids to veto legislation that violated Islam, to allow open trials and due process, and to have political pluralism, decentralization, and regional autonomy. With the radicalization of the revolution during 1979-1981, a new Islamic constitution replaced the 1905 Constitution. As the revolution took over the institutions of the state, the dominant Khomeyni faction of the revolutionary coalition (initially the Islamic Republican Party) created parallel institutions to the existing state institutions to enforce its revolutionary goals in a classic maneuver. So, for instance, the Revolutionary Guards became a parallel military force, and revolutionary committees were set up in ministries and economic enterprises. Slowly the Islamic Republic consolidated, and there was later a slow movement toward a more democratic process, albeit hampered by oversight institutions controlled by the more theocratic wing of the revolution. Still, by the end of the 1990s, the more democratic forces had twice overwhelmingly elected a President ofthe Islamic Republic, Ayatullah Muhammad Khatami, who had campaigned on the slogans ofcivil society and open democracy. (See also Brumberg 2001 for an account of the political maneuvers since the revolution to \"reinvent Khomeyni.\") Regarding economic policy, the original goals of the revolution con-\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxxxiii\n\ncerned the reduction of oil production so as to utilize more effectively the revenue to stimulate other domestic economic production, and the reorientation of trade in order to break out of dependency relations with the U.S. and Europe. The eight-year war with Iraq during the 1980s forced Iran's economy into a nationalization of banks and industry in a kind of command or state capitalism, from which it is only gradually trying to free itself. Social and cultural policy-women's rights, the position of minorities, land reform, wealth redistribution, and cultural revolution through reform of education and control of the media-all continue to be heavily contested. The demographics of a population explosion with a majority under the age of having firsthand memory of the revolution seems to suggest that the puritanical and theocratic reaction of the 1970s and 1980s will wane, allowing Iran's more tolerant traditions to reemerge. But such predictions are notoriously unstable in environments of continuing difficulties in the political economy. As concerns foreign policy, early foreign policy goals of the Islamic Republic dealt with asserting independence of action and escaping the subordination felt to ensue from supplying oil to the U.S. and Europe by changing the configuration of foreign trade. A degree of success in this area came from increased trade with India, South Africa, and East Africa. A corollary of this objective was the protection of the revolution from external attack (the Iraqi invasion) and being drawn back into the same political economy relations with the U.S. and Europe that the revolution sought to break. The seizure of the American personnel as hostages was a dramatic gambit to ensure this break (as well as helping to pass the highly contested new Islamic constitution). As often noted, this was also a media event, with demonstrations being skillfully staged in front of rolling American news cameras. Assassination of dissidents in Europe and the U.S. was also a tactic used to discourage the kind of mobilization abroad that had helped topple the shah. (Shapur Bakhtiar in Paris in 1991 and Ali Akbar Tabataba'i in Washington, D.C. in 1980 were two of the higher profile of some twenty plus assassinations.) Active \"export of the revolution\" was another foreign policy goal that emerged with the Khomeyni faction's consolidation of the revolution, albeit, initially, largely by demonstration effect and cultural propaganda. The example of \"Khomeyni\" reenergized Islamic fundamentalist groups elsewhere with the hope that seizure of the state and the creation of an Islamic state were possible. Appeals to African-Americans to rise up against the u.s. fell on deaf ears, but an artistic legacy of this propaganda and cultural effort may be seen in the early stamp issued by the Islamic Republic of Iran on which the faces of Bilal, the first muezzin of Islam, and Malcom X are fused (see Fischer and Abedi 1990: 254). Direct export of the revolution was considerably less successful. Shi'ites were arrested in Bahrain in 1996 for plotting a coup, and there was repeated conflict with the Saudis during the annual hajj in Mecca over using that global meeting as a stage for mobilization. In the 1980s, Iran supported\n\nxxxiv\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nHezbollah and Islamic Jihad in Lebanon, the latter claiming responsibility in 1983 for the suicide car and truck bombings in Beirut of the U.S. Embassy (killing 69), the U.S. Marine barracks (killing 243), the French paratroop headquarters (killing 58), and in Sidon an Israeli military building (67 died). After the end of the Iran-Iraq War, open as well as covert use of funding and weapons supply to Islamic movements elsewhere began to increase. By the 1990s, a RAND corporation analyst claims Iran was spending $100 million per year in support of terrorist groups abroad, and providing in Iran training camps for several groups (Hoffman 1998) . By 1996, Iran was sending three cargo jets a month to Damascus with weapons for Hezbollah. Iran also supported Shi'ite and Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan, becoming even an ally to the U.S. of sorts in the ousting of the Taliban in 2001-2002. In December 2001, a ship off Israel was seized while attempting to smuggle weapons from Iran to the Palestinians. Iran's participation in the growing use of international terror by resistance and insurgency movements and by states using terror as a covert form of foreign policy is difficult to track given both its covert nature and its contested status within the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It appears that such operations as the smuggling of arms to the Palestinian Authority-not just to Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad-are further internally contested policies between the so-called conservative hard-liners and the proponents of President Khatami's efforts to open relations to the West. What remains clear is that the current generation of violence has become increasingly sophisticated, the world a more dangerous, not less dangerous, place in the past twenty years, particularly for the Middle East from the Levant to Central Asia, with Iran caught in the middle, caught in the crosscurrents, but also an active player both trying to protect itself and work its way through an often deadlocked revolution. Future(s) Any film is like a poem, it is not interesting just to repeat. And that is what Iranian cinema is doing, like poetry bringing out something different. ... Film should depict reality and transform it. ... Something happens in front of the camera, and it is the first moment it happens, new life takes shape in front of the camera. Samira Makhmalbaf, in Meysam Makhmalbaf's How Samira Made the Blackboard\n\nNonetheless, for Iran I remain an optimist: it strikes me that the Iranian revolution, while excessive during its Terror, was never as bloody as it was portrayed to be by its opponents (not as bloody as the French or Russian revolutions for instance), and that despite the many terrible events and hardships the Iranians have had to suffer over the past several decades (including the very bloody Iran-Iraq War ), there does seem to be a long duree process toward transformation. Above all, I think Ayatullah Shariatmadari will be proven correct: the hard line religious leaders have discredited themselves and the idea of a theocracy. The young generation of Iran will decide. We\n\nIntroduction to the 2003 Edition\n\nxxxv\n\nwill see in the coming years what the balance will be between those who continue the revolutionary guards and other parallel institutions of the revolution (including the Committee for Special Operations5 of the Ministry of Intelligence named in the German arrest warrant for Ali Fallahian, the Minister of Intelligence, in the case of the assassination of three Kurdish dissidents and their translator in Berlin in 1992; Fallahian also is named with three others in an Argentine indictment for the 1994 bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish community center that killed eighty-five and the 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires that killed twenty-eight) versus those who have so vocally rallied to the call of President Khatami for building a new and open civil society. Although a firm political secularist, I am unpersuaded that a society must choose to be either secular or religious: I live, after all, in a majority Christian country, where Christian politicians are held in check by strong traditions of separation between church and state. Separations of dowlat (government) and din (religion) have also operated through the history of Muslim polities. Increasingly culturally and religiously diverse citizens get along because of separations between church and state, democracy, and civil society. And it works particularly well when we can share one another's traditions, which serve as reservoirs of generations of human experience and ethical struggle, rather than as to-the-death-dogmas. Iran's struggles to achieve its own balances of social justice and tolerance, economic and social well-being, and sense offair play in the community of nations draw upon its considerable cultural resources and experiences, much of which over the centuries it gifted to the fund of humanistic stories and understandings of both Western and world-wide civilization. Notes 1. Exports of oil and gas provided two thirds of Soviet exports to the capitalist world in the 1980s; ninety percent of the exports were oil, gas, raw materials and precious metals-\"an external trade structure typical of underdeveloped countries\" (Castells 1998: 6,21). There were ofcourse other sources ofdistortion in what Castells calls a statist system of surplus value appropriation, in which \"about 40 percent of industrial production was defense related, and the production of enterprises that were engaged in the military-industrial complex reached about 70 percent of all industrial production (ibid 22). The similarity is to the revenue stream that protected the state, for a time, against demands from the citizenry for decision-making participation. 2. This continues to be an important caution, but see Pinto (1999) for a sobering reminder that policy debates contain quite a range of positions. The United States tends to guide foreign policy by economic and political considerations alone, but in the field of contestation over how to respond to, for instance, the use of international terrorism by \"political Islam\" targeted often at the U.S. in the Middle East, there are a range of confrontationalist and accomodationist positions. 3. Pakistan's literacy rate, barely 30 percent, is below that of Haiti, Rwanda, and Sudan according to UN figures, and its spending on education has declined to around two percent of GNP, far below that of Bangladesh, Iran, or Turkey.
