Their is a legend that states they were originally descendants of Persian nobles, whom lost their position when the Arabs defeated the Persians. According to the legend the last Sassanid emperor Yazgirid III recruited Jatts and Baluch soliders in order to be used against the Arabs. Thus these people were ennobled, and this was in order to defeat the Arabs. However the Arabs defeated them in the wars, and todays Gypsies are descendants of those knights who had fought for the Persian empire. The Iraqi Gypsy have some Zoroastrian influence upon their religion in which fire is considered scared, and their continual battle between good and evil.\n\nThe Iraqi Gypsy speak the Romani langauge, which has large amounts of Persian and Arab, loan words\n\nThe Iraqi Gypsies trace their origins to Northern India, and Southern Persia.

A story frequently found in the sources, from Ebn al-Moqaffaʿ onward, states that Sāsān was the son of the ancient Persian ruler Bahman b. Esfandīār, but, being displaced from the succession, took to a wandering life and gathered round him other vagabonds, thus forming the sons of Sāsān. Another explanation says that the Persian nation as a whole took to begging and vagabondage after the Arab conquest of the 1st/7th century and excited pity by claiming to be descendants of the dispossessed Sasanian house, and the process whereby the name of a fallen dynasty is satirically or ironically applied to a subsequent group seems psychologically possible. Further etymologies have been sought in Sanskrit and in Persian itself (see Bosworth, I, pp. 22-24).\n\nThe Banū Sāsān, as depicted for us in such works of Arab adab literature as those of Jāḥeẓ, Ebrāhīm b. Moḥammad Bayhaqī, Abū Dolaf, and the maqāmāt of Badīʿ-al-Zamān Hamaḏānī and Ḥarīrī, must have rangedwhether in groups or as individualsall over the Islamic lands and as far as the borders of India. Specifically in regard to the Iranian lands, the beggar leader Ḵāled b. Yazīd in Jāḥeẓs Ketāb al-boḵalāʾ boasts that he has in the course of his life headed bands of robbers and desperadoes from the outlaws and bandits of Jebāl, of the Baṭṭ river region in Ḵūzestān, of the Kūfečīs (q.v.) of Kermān and Baluchistan, and the pirates of Qīqān of the Makrān coast. In almost all the literature relevant to the Banū Sāsān, the Kurds are singled out as the nation of predators and brigands par excellence, and Ḵāled b. Yazīd in his enumeration of the beggar leaders mentions Jaʿfar Kordī among various others with Persian names, such as Banjawayh, Ḥammawayh, Sahrām, Saʿdawayh, Mardawayh, etc. From Abū Dolafs poem (see below), it emerges that the Kābolis (or perhaps in this context, the Indians in general) were especially famed as jugglers and conjurors (see Jāḥeẓ, Boḵalāʾ, ed. Ṭaha Ḥājerī, Cairo, 1958, pp. 46, 50, tr. Ch. Pellat, Le livre des avares, Paris, 1951, pp. 66, 71; Bosworth, I, pp. 34ff., 93-94, 171)."
