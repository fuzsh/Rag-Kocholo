This document provides an overview of the history and development of comparative religion as an academic discipline. It discusses early theories from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia about the origins of religion. It then outlines how Greek philosophers like Xenophanes and Lucretius began critically examining religious beliefs and practices. The document also describes how religious syncretism in the Graeco-Roman world led to comparisons between deities of different religions. Finally, it mentions theories from later thinkers like Maximus of Tyre about how religion originated from humanity's need to conceptualize the divine.",
