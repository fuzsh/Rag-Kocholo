        "text": "In the ancient Near East, small stamps and cylinders with carved or molded designs were used as emblems of status or author ity. Their impressions on lumps of clay, called sealings, served to indicate ownership or rights over goods, and to control access to containers or storerooms. While seals and sealings have long held an artistic interest because of their designs, more recent studies have also begun to recognize the value of such artifacts as a means of recon structing aspects of economy and society. Most of the seals in museums and private collections today have been purchased and are without an ar chaeological provenience. Isolated from their cultural context, such artifacts are of limited value, even for traditional studies of style. The 9th century Citadel of Hasanlu affords an unusual opportunity to study a corpus of seals and sealings with controlled stratigraphic con texts, which provide them with a precise archaeological and cultural setting.\n\nIn this paper I would like to illustrate a synthesis of the results from my PHD Research on the amulets of Kerma Culture emerged during the excavation conducted by G. Reisner. The first aim of my research is describing, in a systematic way, these materials which have only been partially studied and published until now. The study of the amulets is essential because it provides important information relating to the symbols, to their protective value, and helping us to know a still unknown pantheon that could be very complex, born about by Nubian features combined with Egyptian and southern elements. Some types of amulets found in the storerooms are comparable to the Egyptian ones, but others seem to be distinctive of the Kerma culture. Finally the amulets can be a window onto the material culture of a civilization: give us insights into the culture’s social hierarchies, religious beliefs, natural resources and technological capabilities.\n\nDuring the 2014 campaign of the Danish-German Northwest Quarter Project in Jerash a small metal capsule was found in a house destroyed by an earthquake in the mid-8th cent. ce. The capsule, which retained traces of textile fibres, was conserved and proved to contain a tightly-rolled strip of silver foil (lamella) which, on removal, turned out to be inscribed with letters of Semitic character. Since it could not be unfolded manually, it was submitted to computed tomography and ‘unfolded’ digitally by means of special software. This article presents the lamella and its capsule as well as the archaeological context, a private house sealed by an earthquake in the mid-8th cent. ce on the eastern terrace of the Northwest Quarter in Jerash. The lamella, which also contains a few charaktêres (magical signs), is interpreted as a magical amulet, which stands in a Semitic and Greco-Roman tradition but in this case surely stems from the Umayyad period."
