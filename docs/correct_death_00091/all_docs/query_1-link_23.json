        "text": "WASHINGTON – Dying from cancer a quarter-century ago, the deposed shah of Iran pressed on me a fundamental point about his nation that has become even more vivid over the last two weeks. It sheds new light on the present tense confrontation between Iran and the world’s great powers.\n\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi died a few weeks after our 1980 conversation in Cairo. He may spin in his grave at a re-examination of the hidden meanings in his words, which were originally squeezed into a news story on many of the topics we discussed. As with life, daily journalism frequently requires a rush past the obvious.\n\nBut Iran is a place where reality may come not in words but in meaningful details that underlie – and often belie – the words.\n\nFooling foreigners and adversaries is an ancient Persian art form.\n\nSaying exactly what you mean is a crude and dangerous way to talk, or negotiate.\n\nBeneath the shah’s paranoid descriptions of how the British and American governments deliberately brought down his regime in 1979 lay such a telling detail. It surfaced again as I watched President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bluster his way through the histrionic release of 15 British military captives and then defy the world anew over Iran’s nuclear ambitions.\n\nThe detail was that the shah blamed London much more than he blamed Washington for his fate. The Americans had been children playing at complicated games of power and espionage, while imperial Britain purposely mounted an ill-fated plot to win favor with the ayatollahs who had toppled him. It could not have been otherwise, the shah asserted.\n\nThe 15 captives grabbed by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Iraqi waters on March 23 simply may have been targets of opportunity. But I doubt it. Ahmadinejad seized on their nationality in ways that suggest that the imprint of the colonial era has not faded much from the Iranian political subconscious since the days of the shah. It still pays to twist the British lion’s tail, even in nations where imperial control was largely indirect and economic.\n\nSubmerged history also plays an important role in the confrontation over Iran’s determination to control uranium enrichment on its own soil despite international fears that Iran’s secret goal is to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nEvery discussion I have had with Iranian officials on the nuclear program has included a pointed reminder that it was the shah – with American and French encouragement – who started the nuclear energy program that Ahmadinejad and the ayatollahs are carrying forward.\n\nThese officials leave hanging this political fact of life: Their giving up control of the enrichment of uranium would open them to charges of being less nationalistic than was the shah.\n\nThe historical force of past intervention in Iran’s affairs is obviously no justification for the kidnapping of British sailors and marines, of pursuing nuclear weapons or of supporting terrorism in Iraq, Israel and elsewhere. But it is important for Americans to recognize how deep the imprint of the past runs and how demagogues exploit it when they are in trouble. It will take broad and sustained campaigns of political and economic pressures to force change.\n\nThis is how I interpret the bombast of Ahmadinejad and others in his regime in grabbing hostages again and in threatening to pull out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and cut off negotiations if the United Nations continues its condemnations of Iran’s nuclear program. The meaningful detail in Iranian threats not to talk to the West is that the Iranians are still talking to the West, however theatrically and unconvincingly.\n\nThis demonstrates that the financial and diplomatic pressures orchestrated by the Treasury and State departments are taking their toll on Ahmadinejad’s regime. They should be continued and intensified where possible. Among those voting against Tehran on the latest Security Council censure were South Africa, which often breaks with the West on political issues to bolster its nonaligned credentials, and Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation.\n\nThose votes were body blows to Tehran’s pretense that the nuclear dispute is a continuing victimization of Third World peoples and resources by rapacious Westerners. So is the visible irritation of Russia’s Vladimir Putin with Iran’s refusal to consider his offers to guarantee Iran access to peaceful nuclear energy.\n\nThe diplomatic effort to assemble a united international front against Iran is paying off. One sign: President Bush displays no sense of urgency about having to decide on military action against Iran, recent visitors to the White House report. History, ancient and recent, shows that his best option is to continue on the high road.\n\nJim Hoagland’s e-mail address is jimhoagland@washpost.com.\n\n(c) 2007, Washington Post Writers Group"
