All that has remained and ﬂowing is the body— bold, braving the elements, corporeal, canonic, mythic— as if it began in the inﬁ nity of a nowhere and is headed toward the immortality of somewhere else. Karun is some 450 miles long on the map and the only navigable river in my homeland. It originates in the Zard Kuh mountain range of the Bakhtiari region in the Zagros Mountains, and after receiving many tributaries it ﬂows through my hometown of Ahvaz on its way to the Persian Gulf. The blood of our homeland in southern Iran is brown, you might say, by the commanding color that Karun so convincingly projects in and of itself. Karun is the color and conviction of faraway mountains— invisible, imagined, dormant in the twists and turns of the silent river. It is ponderous, meditative, and conﬁdent, knows where it is going, minds its own business— all the while generously nourishing us as if entirely unbeknownst to itself. Is it because of the enduring memories of Karun, the invisible matrix of its time and space mapped repeatedly on the dawning of its visible aspects, now all carved with conﬁdence and assurance into the rhythm and ﬂow of my being, that I also have an atemporal and yet tactile sense of my mother tongue, and the literature, prose, and poetry that goes with it, at once ﬂowing and stationary, timeless and timely, evident and effusive— the enduring music of a language and literature that I began sensing and then learning from my mother’s lullabies, continued learning\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nuntil the day I decided what quatrain from Omar Khayyam should be carved on her gravestone, and then learned again in the nights I sang the same lullabies to my own children in New York or taught Persian literary masterpieces to my students at Columbia University, and will continue to learn until the day that they will be lost but still palpable to me in the invisibility of my own death and dying, and from there to the memories that my children will carry from me? But helpless pieces in the game He plays Upon this chequer-board of Nights and Days He hither and thither moves, and checks . . . and slays Then one by one, back in the Closet lays.\n\nI write this book on Persian literary humanism (Adab) as it has emerged and spread over the last 1,400 years, like a mighty and magniﬁcent river, from Bengal to Istanbul and from central Asia to the eastern coasts of Africa, and with the contemporary map of Iran as its epicenter, by way of a historical retrieval of an otherwise ahistorical phenomenon code-named “literature.” What you will see and sense is a river running under your feet, like Karun under mine, while what you will feel and form in your mind is the abiding presence of where it has been and where it is headed: that is the paramount image in my mind as I begin to tell my story of Persian literature, a river whose mighty and majestic aspect will soon dawn on you and you will have an abiding sense of where it has been and where it is headed. I will have you sail on that river— claiming, naming, feeling, sensing it. Persian literature is a living organism, just like a river, and telling its story requires a ﬂuidity of narrative that comes to terms with its existential immediacy, as if it had no history, and yet is fully aware of the expansive history that it tacitly ﬂaunts. Like the Karun River, Persian literature is ﬂowing from an inﬁ nity of historical sources, comes to you with the massive volume of its abiding presence, and leads to the immortality of a yet-to-be-named sea. Adab is one of the richest and aesthetically most provocative words in Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and Turkish. In all of these languages, with slight variations in both pronunciation and connotations, it suggests a commanding allusion to proper etiquette, ﬁ nesse, ﬂair, grace, or the art of living gracefully— a grace that extends from the way you speak and think, to the manner in which you clothe and carry yourself, to the disposition of your character and culture. The German Bildung is probably\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nthe closest word in any European language to what Adab means in Persian and its adjacent languages. But Adab, at the same time, categorically relates to literature as belles-lettres, literature as the summation of all linguistic arts that are beautiful and make for equally beautiful living, an art that informs a literature that becomes a testimony of your having achieved (not inherited) a living grace. It is this rich range of the connotations of Adab, which I translate as “literary humanism,” that I wish to convey in this book as the running leitmotif of Persian literary imagination, and thereby the Iranian cultural heritage. Adab is apt for the literary disposition of the writing we call “literature,” because it embraces life and letters, body and book, manners and matters, society and solitude, wish and will, code and character. What I ultimately plan to demonstrate in this book is that the literary subconscious of a civilization is its paradoxical undoing, which may in fact account in part for the active hostility of the masculinist aspect of the dominant Arabic culture early in Islamic history against the consistently feminized Persian language and literature, character and culture, “accusing” Persians not only of effeminate delicacy and sexual misconduct (as now aptly demonstrated by Joseph Massad in his Desiring Arabs) but also of scientiﬁc and philosophical inaccuracy— a charge that may in part at least account for such leading Iranian scholars and scientists as al-Biruni, Ibn Sina, and al-Ghazali opting to write most of their important and canonized work in Arabic. This theological, philosophical, and scientiﬁc shunning of the Persian language (to which, of course, there are a number of exceptions), ipso facto posited Persian literary humanism as the modus operandi of a mode of being, writing, and reading safely distanced from the sanctiﬁed language of the Quran and the masculinist rectitude of Islamic scholasticism that it had historically occasioned. This historic condition thus ascribes to Persian literary humanism an effectively feminine disposition, even as it remained in a by-and-large male-dominated domain. That effectively feminine subconscious of a decidedly masculinist civilization has given Persian literary humanism a subversive disposition by being ipso facto narrated from a hidden and denied, repressed, and thus paradoxically ﬂamboyant and deﬁant vantage point. The proposition of Adab as the literary subconscious of a masculinist civilization posits the subject that it invokes as creatively unstable and always already somewhere else, beyond the command and control of any sacred certitude.\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nThe name Karun is probably a modern corruption of Kuhrang, which means “the color of mountain.” A river that looks like a mountain in motion and carries the memories of its mountainous origins in the running ﬂuency of its color is the image that Persian literature has projected of itself throughout its long and generous history. Karun is also identiﬁed with the Biblical river of Pishon, which along with the Tigris, Euphrates, and Karkheh (“Gihon”) constitutes the four rivers of Eden. To think that the river that runs quietly through my hometown and over which I traveled all my childhood and adolescent years was also one of the four rivers that ran through Eden! The idea radically compromises one’s sense of time and space, rhythm and harmony, and sense and sensibility, and teaches you, above all, humility, as you pick up your proverbial pen, dip it into Karun, and write the aleph that anticipates the beh, dreaming of the sea with no name.\n\n. . . and thus I put one brick upon another In the house of the blind So when the sun rises tomorrow I can sit them down under a canopy . . . Nima Yushij (1896–1960)\n\nq\n\nIntroduction The Making of a Literary Humanism\n\nO NCE UPON A TIME , so says the sagacious and always jovial poet Sheykh Mosleh al-Din Sadi (ca. 1209–1291) in his Golestan (composed in 1258), there was a king who one day in a rage ordered the execution of a foreign slave in his custody. The condemned man began cursing the king in his native tongue, for he was now convinced he would be killed, and so he let go his fears and told the monarch what he thought of him. The king did not understand the language in which the condemned man spoke, so he turned to his courtiers and asked for a proper translation. There was a good-hearted vizier in attendance who said, quoting a passage from the Quran (3:134), “Your Majesty, he says: ‘Those who spend in prosperity and in adversity, who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily, Allah loves the good-doers.’ ” The King was pleased with this translation and, properly admonished by its wisdom, summoned his magnanimity and forgave the condemned man. There was another vizier in attendance who was an adversary of the good-hearted vizier. He instantly turned to the king and said, “People of our rank and position should never lie to His Majesty. This man was not praising you or asking for forgiveness; he was cursing His Majesty and abused His Most Royal name.” The king was saddened by this remark and said, “That lie was far more appeasing to me than this truth, for that lie was meant to solicit a good deed, while the source of your truth was to do evil, and wise men have said, ‘a judicious lie is better than a seditious truth.’ ”1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nSa©di: The Mind of the Moralist They say if something catastrophic were to happen, and the entire Persian literary culture were to disappear from the face of the earth, and all that remained was the text of Sadi’s Golestan, that lost civility could be constructed anew.2 There are those who even believe that claim need not be limited to Ira nian civilization— that civility as such, justice, grace, tolerance, and a harmonious and happy humanity at large are all embedded in Sadi’s poetry and prose, in the Adab that he personiﬁed and helped make into a literary-humanist institution in Iranian (and by extension Islamic) culture. Medieval Persian literature, as best represented by and in Sadi, is replete with gems of worldly wisdom, at the heart of which always dwells the twist of a verbal pun informing a moral paradox, where harmful truth-telling, for example, must yield to the wisdom of a white lie. Only in the literary space— with poetic license— thus crafted and made viable can a lie be celebrated and privileged over truth, by way of a mere parabolic coil whipping at the adjectival spin of a morally superior lie to an ethically compromised truth. But how is that possible, and what would such a paradox do to the commanding mandates of a religion like Islam, a holy text like the Quran, or a divine emissary like Prophet Muhammad? How do we, or can we, account for a sustained legacy of literary humanism in the bosom or context or even the neighborhood of commanding doctrinal beliefs, strict juridical injunctions, expansive metaphysical mandates— all summoned under the word “Islam”? Were Iranians— or even more widely those who composed, spread, read, and celebrated Persian literature, Sadi chief among other poets and prose stylists— not Muslims? Of course they were— not all of them, but most of them. Persian literary humanism, I propose, was neither despite nor because of Islam. It was, as it remains, the literary manifestation of a cosmopolitan urbanism, rooted in successive empires, that emerged in the aftermath of the Muslim conquest of the mid-seventh century. Persian literary humanism—where those who produced and received it have come into being— spells out an entirely different universe of moral and ethical obligations, where, if you can poetically stage it, “a judicious lie,” as Sadi says, “is better than a seditious truth.” To dwell in that universe, to come to terms with the possibilities of such noble lies, we need to\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nknow who and what and where and under what circumstances was conceived and crafted this wise and perspicacious poet and prose stylist: Sheykh Mosleh al-Din Sadi Shirazi. The Master, the Perfect Model, the Truthful, the Prince of Speech, the Most Eloquent Speaker: medieval and modern biographers cannot praise Sadi enough when naming or citing him. Abu Muhammad Moshref al-Din Mosleh ibn Abdullah ibn Musharraf al-Sadi al-Shirazi was his full honoriﬁc name.3 He is the singularly celebrated poet and master prose stylist of the thirteenth century— the very model of eloquence that deﬁ ned the beauty and grace of the language that to this day carries his seal and signature. As one literary historian put it, it is not very strange that the Persian-speaking world today speaks the same language that Sadi wrote some 750 years ago, for we simply mimic his Persian.4 Sadi was widely known and deeply loved and admired by his contemporaries. Royal courts sought his company, and poets from around the Muslim world paid him homage and imitated his poetry or else admonished themselves for daring to put pen to paper while he was still living. His two most famous books, Bustan (1257) in poetry and Golestan (1258) in highly stylized prose and poetry, universalized his fame, while his Persian lyrics and Arabic panegyrics made him a household name among the literati from one end of the Islamic world to the other. Now: Who exactly was this Sadi— and what do we know about his life? Not much— and what is known is not entirely reliable. He was born and raised in Shiraz, went to Baghdad to study at the famous Nizamiyyah university, traveled widely in the region, and eventually returned to Shiraz, where he was very popular at the royal courts in the Fars region. Consulting all the extant biographical and hagiographical dictionaries about Sadi, two factors are paramount in any reading of his life: ﬁ rst, that throughout his writings he keeps placing himself in his stories with such an easy matter-of-factness that you think he was indeed there and was a participant observer in what he is describing— he is in the Grand Mosque of Damascus in one story, arrested by the Crusaders in another, and wandering in India or central Asia in yet another story. But generations of scholars have long since determined that these are in fact narrative tropes for dramatic purposes and should not be taken at face value.5 The second factor is that Sadi’s admirers and successive generations of biographers have kept adding items to his biography\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nout of love and admiration for him. If we were to take all these anecdotes at face value, we would believe he traveled widely from India to Syria and from central Asia to Yemen and North Africa— and once he was even arrested by the Franks in Syria during the Crusades, whereupon a friend rescued him from bondage and gave his daughter to him in marriage. When we say “Sadi,” we refer to a narrative trope made up of all these citations and posited as the master poet of a vast literary tradition that has consistently canonized and celebrated him. These two conﬂating factors need to be summoned and added to the historical circumstances of Sadi’s time and place. The almost century-long life of Sadi was spent during the tumultuous epoch of the Mongol invasion, when the Islamic (Iranian) world saw the deeply traumatic collapse of the Seljuqid dynasty, which ruled over much of the Muslim world from the early eleventh to the late twelfth century, and with it the ﬁ nal demise of the Abbasid caliphate (750–1258). Consider the major landmarks of the Mongol conquest to recognize a new meaning for the term ﬁ n de siècle: the fall of Bokhara (1219) in the northeasternmost part of the Seljuqid empire, followed by the fall of Samarqand (1220), Neishabur (1221), and Isfahan (1227), the destruction of the Ismaili strongholds (1256), and ultimately the sack of Baghdad and the fall of the Abbasids (1258)6 — and you can imagine the range and depth of the seismic changes that effectively ended the classic age of Islam. Sadi was a product of this time—with the urgency of the time written into the fabric of his prose and poetry. What has remained for posterity about Sadi as a person is a strange but joyous mélange of biography, hagiography, and mythology through which a people’s favorite poet was assimilated and absorbed into his texts, whereby he was transformed from a person and a name into a phenomenon and a citation. On this collectively creative site, history is made effective and meaningful only to the degree that it is at the service of the literary event, which has enabled that history by way of implicating it into a story that makes more sense for a poet who is then collectively canonized. On the site of that canonization, Sadi as a poet and prose stylist is transformed into the mind of a moralist who in turn posits a vast topography of sentiments and ideals for a people to behold and uphold. As Philip Rieff demonstrated in his Freud: The Mind of the Moralist (1959), Freud had turned the classical take on body/mind and individual/society upside down in his psychoanalytic theories and thus\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\ncrafted a constellation of the psychic drama driven by instinct that drove the world in one direction or another. Similarly, Sadi as a moralist became a mirror of an entire people in which they saw and upon which they projected what they were and what they wanted to see at one and the same time. This primacy of the literary act over the historical narrative, the sovereignty of the poetic over the political, is what I believe to be the guiding principle of coming to any historical terms with a literary imagination a people continue to believe to represent what is best in them. Sadi was willed— in person, persona, poetry, and prose— by the collective subtext of Persian literary humanism. The assimilation of Sadi’s biography into the mind of the moralist that he was and the prose and poetry that he left behind produced a literary heteroglossia through what Bakhtin would call “the dialogical imagination,” which was subsequently embedded in the hybrid nature of the language (polyglossia) with which he is remembered.7 On the surface of that literary act, the mind of the moralist becomes the nexus classicus of a people’s moral imagination (their Durkheimian collective consciousness incarnate) in which a noble lie will be understood as better than a troubling truth without any moral qualms— and on the basis of which an entire literary humanism is made possible and sui generis. The heteroglossia that results from the historical dialectic between the context and the text translates into the hybridity (polyglossia) of literary utterances that makes up a literary tradition. In such utterances, Sadi’s words are always already animated by the emerging intentions of their readers. This is how, in Sadi’s case, the mind of the moralist was at once literary in its disposition and moralizing in the collective consciousness of the people, who in loving and quoting and procreating him in effect celebrated their own repressed aspirations and thus collectively enacted a nonprophetic, self-revelatory act of prophecy, which in turn ipso facto detranscendentalized the sense of the sacred.\n\nLiterary History sans Historicism Perhaps the most famous poem of Sadi known globally is one from his Golestan, in which he speaks of the brotherhood/sisterhood of humankind: The children of Adam are limbs of but one body, Having been created of but one essence.\n\n6\n\nIntroduction When the calamity of time afﬂ icts one limb, The other limbs will not remain at ease. If thou hast no sympathy for the troubles of others, Thou art unworthy to be named human.8\n\nIn the Persian original, that very last word, which is usually translated as “human” (the same word at the root of “humanism”), is Adami. The last two lines of the poem in the original are: To kaz mehnat-e digaran bi-ghami, Nashayad keh namat nahand Adami.9\n\nLiterally: Thou who art indifferent to others’ misfortune, You are unworthy to be named human.\n\nThe very last word of the last hemistich, “human being,” marks a peculiar construction in Persian. The word Adami, which is usually translated as “humanity” or “being named human,” escapes immediate attention but (perhaps precisely for that reason) demands a closer scrutiny. I say the construction is “peculiar,” because that last “i” after Adam posits a very strange intonation in the Persian original. “Adam” quite obviously means Adam, the ﬁ rst human being in the Bible and in the Qur’an, the man God created from naught and in his own image, and into whom he breathed from his own breath. From the word Adam we have the abstract noun of Adamiyat, which means—now degendered beyond the “Adam-Eve” divide— humanity or humanism or the condition and quality of being a human being. But instead of the usual Adamiyat, the simpler and more poetic (though less philosophical) construction of Adami cast onto that little “i” at the end of the word the daunting task of creating an attribute out of Adam—for Adami means both a human being and the state of being a human being, or just “humanity” or even “humanism,” if we were to allow ourselves a bit of leeway. Paramount in the word Adami, however, is Adam— biblical and Quranic, prehistoric and atemporal, and yet precisely in that designation the atemporal origin of temporality, of time, of history. Time begins with Adam and so does history. So in the word Adami we have embedded Adam, the ﬁ rst human being, from time immemorial, that makes the memorial time possible, history afoot. Humanity, as evident and present in the word Adami, is thus made historical by its ahistoricality, a literary act, in other\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nwords, exuding with temporality made temporal. In being so fragile, Adami fragments its own history into indeterminate pieces. Adami is a literary act, a poetic implosion, that makes the evidence of historicality embedded in the verbal utterance without yielding to historicism. That literary fact implicates any attempt at literary historiography. If the literary history of a people ought to be told more like an openended epic than a closed-circuit panegyric, then that epic is habitually punctuated with lyricism. This is not to suggest that lyricism, in and of itself, has no narrative place in literary history. Quite to the contrary: almost everything about Persian literature—modern and medieval— carries an indelible mark of lyricism on it. It has emerged as something of a second nature to the subtext of the language and its self-perception of itself. Be that as it may, the drama of a national, regional, and above all imperial literature, long in the making, demands a certain global awareness of its epic proportions. But does the epic disposition of a people’s literature amount to a “literary history”? That little “i” that gives a literary disposition to the biblical and Quranic ahistoricality of Adam/human is the answer— and so is the hidden miracle of any language and literature that gives birth and breeding to that very little sound that makes the apparition of an immortal humanity suddenly emerge out of the mortal human. Evident in that one word—Adami, humanity and humanism— and mapped out on a global scene, as the vast and mighty Abbasid and Seljuqid empires were crumbling and the Mongol empire was ﬂexing its overextended muscles, Sadi performs the Persian language and stages the literary prowess of his mother tongue with equal might and commanding manner. In doing so, and for ages to come, Sadi becomes Persian literary humanism incarnate: precise, graceful, expansive, delicate, balanced, and judicious, exhibiting the brevity that is the soul of his wit, and above all wise and worldly. He performs Persian prose and poetry like two melodious instruments, harmoniously staging that perfor mance, and thriving at showing off his command of the language, which becomes performative in his capable hands and serves, at face value, no other purpose than that very performance, the audible delight of the reader/performer of Sadi. Sadi becomes exemplary for generations of poets and prose stylists to come; he cast his shadow upon the literary masters who preceded and followed him— bringing them all under the wide and spacious canopy of one single literary event: Adab- e\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nFarsi (Persian literary humanism). “Sadi is the absolute ruler of the realm of speech,” in the judicious and rare words of Mohammad Ali Foroughi, “and no one else can compare with his command of elocution. Speech is like wax in his hands, expressing every meaning with phrases that are impossible to surpass in beauty and brevity. . . . His prose tastes like poetry, his poetry is as ﬂuent as prose. . . . In other words, because of Sadi, Persian poetic and prose diction were rescued from a false binary and became one.”10 To emphasize Sadi’s penchant for the surface beauty of the language, and his happiness in dwelling there, is not to ignore his uplifting ideas and graceful thoughts, for he is full of morals and manners, but they are entirely tangential to that paramount performativity of the language itself— and all else becomes poignant and powerful by virtue of Sadi’s perfor mance. That perfor mance is literary, ahistorical, a temporal pause running through its atemporality. Embedded in that literary performativity of Sadi, and the literary humanism that he best represents, is an always already hidden core of evident historicality that need not be exhausted, exposed, or overextended by or in any historical narrative. Humanism as the prose and poetry of historicality is something that becomes evident in and through the course of Persian literary humanism.11 That thrust of historicality on the act of the literary amounts to a literary history without historicism— lyricism keeping historicism at bay, thus recognizing the decentered subject at the heart of the literary act. Here the literary act has no history, and subjecting it to history (as practically all “histories of Persian literature” do) inadvertently assigns a false totalizing subject to its amorphous narrative, whereby the historical narrator becomes the historical narrative of the literary. The literary act would command and claim that effective (and affective) history, as it must, if by history we were to mean more a genealogy of here and now rather than an archeology of there and then— and it does not, if we were to dwell on the moment of its creative spontaneity (which is here now and gone the next moment)— however framed within the institutions of power and formality that craft and canonize it. Can the twain meet— the historicity of the craft and the spontaneity of its creative moment? Much of Persian literary historiography, as we have received it and keep producing it today, is precisely one of an archeology of what was rather than a genealogy of what is. By keeping historicism at bay, seeing through the historicality of the literary act, we will not only retrieve the literary act as and for\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nwhat it is, but also refrain from inadvertently ascribing to it a false organizing subject. Literary humanism as the modus operandi of a dialogical imagination that thrived on its polyglossia to become a self-revelatory reality, and thus ﬂaunting a self-evident historicality minus historicism, is what will drive this sustained reﬂection on one of the most magniﬁcent manifestations of an aesthetic subtext trying to make sense of a senseless universe. Keeping historicism at bay while retrieving the historicality of this literary imagination will also prevent attributing to it a false organizing subject.\n\nHumanism sans Scholasticism One of the most memorable and oft-quoted passages in Golestan is the story of a quarrel between Sadi and a belligerent Interlocutor who was denouncing the rich and the powerful for being selﬁsh and obnoxious, against Sadi’s insistence that they were in fact generous, kind, and worthy of the gratitude of the poor and the weak. In Jedal-e Sa©di ba Modda©i (The Quarrel of Sa©di with the Interlocutor), we witness Sadi at his absolute storytelling best—in effect telling a whole drama in a few short strokes with wit, precision of dialogue, and full dramatic diction, using an almost uncanny cinematic technique to tell an entire episode in a few judicious cuts. Sadi, as the narrator, chances upon a Dervish who had launched a ﬁerce denunciation of rich and powerful people in a gathering. Sadi intervenes and mildly admonishes him, testifying that rich people are in fact kind, generous, and attentive to their duties to the needy and the weak. Sadi the narrator then proceeds to give an account of the crescendo of their heated debate that soon becomes a ﬁerce quarrel and eventually degenerates into physical assault. The two are then taken to a judge, who upon hearing the story admonishes them both by telling Sadi that there are indeed selﬁsh among the rich and not all are generous, and then turning to his Interlocutor and telling him that yes there are such selﬁshly rich and powerful people, and yet there are exceptions among them.12 Who is the narrator and who are the actors in this short drama? There is one narrator (Sadi) and three actors (Sadi, his Interlocutor, and the Judge), and they are all the creatures of Sadi’s storytelling mind, and yet they are all there as the dramatis personae of a literary\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nrealism unsurpassed in brevity and power of persuasion. At the hidden heart of the drama— all three protagonists of which are represented with almost identical conviction— is the creative effervescence of that very fragile Adami who sits at the center of Sadi’s moral imagination. Even Sadi himself is implicated in the act of narration—when he says “I,” that “I” is already implicated inside the narrator’s story and compromised by it, its subjection metamorphic. The autonomous fragility of that Adami, entirely independent of the God/man binary and their respective reﬂections upon each other, which sustains the course of Islamic metaphysics, is what makes Sadi’s literary humanism plausible. Done in a swift and solid parabolic language, and above all through the indeterminacy of a knowing subject who is telling all these stories with equal conviction (and thus with no conviction at all), the teller of these tales becomes a self-effacing narrator dissolved into naught precisely at the moment when he is telling his tale. The frivolity of the teller of tales— that he too becomes a persona in the dramatis personae— translates into the indeterminacy of the knowing subject, exposing the fragility of Adami at the heart of its humanism. Persian literary humanism (Adab) is a narrative institution unto itself, irreducible to any metaphysical certainty that is Zoroastrian, Manichean, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Gnostic, agnostic, or above all Islamic in origin and destination— though all these religious traditions, in one way or another, lend their mores and metaphors to its creative and effervescent making. That this literary humanism developed almost simultaneously with Islamic scholasticism (from jurisprudence and theology to philosophy and mysticism) was the result of a social and intellectual history that afforded one otherworldly and the other worldly audacity. What also makes literary humanism historically anchored and yet immune to reductionist historicism is its classical juxtaposition against Islamic scholasticism. Literary humanism and Islamic scholasticism have been posited as the two legs, the yin-yang, of medieval intellectual history—well beyond the boundaries of the Muslim world and into Christendom.13 In my reading of Persian literary humanism, I will mark it as being distinctly at the opposite end of Islamic scholasticism, informed by but categorically irreducible to it, if by no other force than by virtue of the critical factor of the primacy of language and the fragility of the subjects (in plural) that have occasioned it. The principal language of Islamic scholasticism was Arabic; Persian literature\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nwas in Persian— a constitutionally noncanonical language when placed next to the canonized Arabic. The systematization of religious learning into Islamic scholasticism, which extended from theology to jurisprudence and from there to philosophy and mysticism, had an entirely different vision of the world than that of literary humanism. Their location adjacent to each other marked their differences even more clearly. A principal inspiration behind the writing of this book on Persian literary humanism is the magisterial work of my late teacher George Makdisi (1920–2002) and his two seminal volumes The Rise of Colleges (1981) and The Rise of Humanism (1990), the former about Islamic scholasticism and the latter about literary humanism (both with references to the Latin West)—the two institutions that he saw as a twin project.14 Makdisi considered “humanism and scholasticism . . . [as] two movements that dominate the intellectual history of classical Islam.” Whereas scholasticism required “a study of the scholastic movement, with its representatives, its institutions, its ‘license to teach,’ the doctorate, and the scholastic method leading to it,” the study of humanism dealt “with its representatives, its institutions, its ‘art of dictation,’ and its emphasis on books for autodidacts.”15 In Makdisi’s correct estimate, scholasticism was geared toward a “license to teach,” while humanism was for “the autodidacts,” meaning the institution of the former was formal and legislative, while the practice of the latter was informal and out of joint. In relation to power, one might suggest scholasticism was deﬁ nitive and stabilizing, while humanism was deﬁ nitely indeterminate and paradoxically destabilizing— serving and subverting power at one and the same time. George Makdisi believed that “in classical Islam, each of the two movements has its raison d’être, distinct from the other; yet both sprang from concern for a common source: the Sacred Scripture.”16 I disagree with this presupposition— and during the time I was George Makdisi’s student and for years later, we had many lively discussions over this crucial matter. While the Sacred Scripture did indeed provide the raison d’être of scholasticism, I believe this was not the case with humanism. Though perfectly respectful of the Muslim Sacred Scripture, as of that of others, the humanists did not take it as their raison d’être. I believe that not the Sacred Scripture but the social conditioning of the vast and diversiﬁed Abbasid empire (750–1258) was the raison d’être of the rise of humanism. George Makdisi did make his case in the case of\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nArabic humanism, and very eloquently so, and now I would like to make mine with Persian, though with a perspective rooted in and yet divergent from his. Without his exquisite scholarship, I must acknowledge at the very outset, none of these discussions about Persian or any other literary humanism would have been possible. Makdisi believed that “the history of their [scholasticism and humanism] developments is one of interaction in which there was conﬂ ict, but never a clean break.” The notion of a “break” (let alone a “clean break”) between scholasticism and humanism implies an effective epistemic codependency, with which assumption I disagree, for I see the rise of these two institutions from two different provenances. Islamic scholasticism emerged from the formal and organic need for the foundation of Islamic doctrines at the heart of the successive Islamic juridical regimes laying claims on successive empires; humanism was the result of the societal formation of a multicultural and polyvocal urbanism entirely independent of the political needs of those empires and deeply rooted in their cosmopolitan characters. Scholasticism was the active formation of an “ideological” disposition to sustain multiple Islamic empires; humanism was the organic growth of a cosmopolitan societal formation that gave expression to its extra- and nondenominational intellectual urbanism. Every time empires reached for scholasticism, they received something in return (legitimacy); every time empires sought to appropriate humanism, they did so at the risk of losing something (legitimacy). In Golestan Sadi says, “One cannot trust either the friendship of monarchs or the good humor of infants, for one is changed with a mere suspicion and the other after a short nap.”17 He was of course right— but he was also projecting, for the same is true about the friendship and humor of poets: they would praise a monarch to high heaven one day and cast him to the lowest depth of hell the next. In no uncertain terms, Sadi knew that “kings are much more in need of the good advice of the wise than the wise in need of proximity to kings.”18 Makdisi believed that humanism “arose because of deep concern for the purity of the classical Arabic of the Koran as the living language, as well as the liturgical language, of Islam.” I concur with the concern for classical Arabic that literary humanism in its Arabic vintage harbored, but not necessarily, or exclusively, as a medium of the Qur’an, but in and of itself, language qua language, language as the modus operandi of eloquence, of art, as the material of a literary project. Makdisi held,\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nand rightly so, that “scholasticism owed its rise to a struggle between opposing religious forces, the conﬂ ict coming to a head in the third-/ ninth-century inquisition (mihna), over a century after the dawn of humanism.” In other words, Makdisi dates the formation of humanism (as a project and a mode of thinking and being) over a century before the rise of scholasticism. This point I in fact use as proof of my position, that the rise of humanism was entirely independent of those religious concerns and arose long before them. Makdisi put the argument succinctly and beautifully with the centrality of the Holy Scripture but disregarded that the Quran was a “sacred” text for scholasticism, while it was the mere model of linguistic and literary eloquence for humanism. Makdisi held that “both movements aimed for orthodoxy: humanism, for ‘orthodoxy’ in language; scholasticism, for orthodoxy in religion.”19 Precisely. Humanism had no concern for or against religious orthodoxy. Makdisi was wrong when he said, “The two movements had their roots in religion” but partially right when he said these movements “owed their impetus to external forces. For humanism the external force was the inﬂuence of foreign tongues on that of the Arabians. For scholasticism it was the inﬂuence of Greek philosophy on the development of the Prophet’s religion.”20 For humanism, I believe, the inﬂuence of foreign tongues was of course crucial, but those foreign tongues— from Syriac and Greek to Pahlavi and Sanskrit—were themselves the result (as much as the consequence) of a massive imperial cosmopolitanism that was conditioned by successive Islamic empires, that of the Abbasids (750–1258) in particular. For the formation of Islamic scholasticism the inﬂuence of Greek philosophy was of course equally crucial, but so was the inﬂuence of Jewish theology, Buddhist monasticism, or Persian Zoroastrianism. All these external factors were calibrated by the internal dynamics of an “Islamic” empire that had to connect its emperor/caliph to some sort of ideological explanation for which the scholasticism that he chieﬂy sponsored became a crucial conduit. But he also, through the intermediary ofﬁce of his (mostly Persian) vizierate, promoted humanism as the more immediate modus operandi of his might and majesty.21 The Persian vizierate became the conduit of transformation of tribally based Islamic conquests—from the Arab Abbasids to the Turkish Seljuqids— on the Sassanid model of cosmopolitan world empires. George Makdisi was partially correct that “humanism began as a scholarly philological movement back to the purity of the Arabian\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nlanguage, at its source in the Arabian Peninsula, untouched by foreign matter”— but the implication that “foreign matter” may indicate a certain sense of xenophobia or anxiety of untouchability on the part of the humanists is categorically wrong, for humanism in fact began as a revolt against patently racialized tribalism of the Umayyad period (661– 750), paving the way for the literary cosmopolitanism of the Abbasids. Humanism— in both its Arabic and Persian vintages— remained true to the centrality of language and eloquence only so far as it served its raison d’être within a vast multicultural and cosmopolitan empire, for which Arabic had become a lingua franca, in the making of which expansion of tribal Arabic Persian-speaking Arabist humanists were key elements. The transformation of tribal Arabic into the lingua franca of a vast empire had its own power and purpose, in which “the purity of the Arabian language” had certain worldly limitations— not just in Arabic humanism but in fact in the Arabic used by scholasticism as well. Makdisi was also partially right that “scholasticism was a scholarly religious movement, away from the excesses of a philosophical theology inspired by Greek thought, towards a juridical theology more in conformity with the nomocracy of Islam.” Partially, I say, because that nomocracy (primacy of law) was only one of the authorizing discourses of Islam, which Makdisi privileged (for reasons peculiar to his intellectual predisposition and not deﬁ nitive to the vast panorama of Islamic intellectual history) over the logocentrism of Islamic philosophy and the homocentrism of Islamic mysticism. Makdisi looked at Greek philosophy only as an impetus for the reactive formation of Islamic scholasticism, and that only so far as Islamic nomocentrism (Fiqh, Shariah, and Ashari Kalam in par tic ular) sought to overcome it, and never took Islamic philosophy (logocentrism) or mysticism (homocentrism) seriously into his full vision of Islam. Even more ﬂawed was Makdisi’s attempt to assimilate even humanism into the bosom of Islamic scholasticism. Makdisi was entirely correct that “the Sacred Scripture supplied the substance of Scholasticism” but partially wrong that it also “served as a model for humanistic eloquence.”22 For that model was always already stripped of its divine disposition and brought into the mundane human domain of humanism. For scholasticism the Sacred Scripture was divine revelation; for humanism it was a superior model of linguistic eloquence. These speak of two vastly different normative dispositions—\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\none posits an absolute alterity as the absolutist subject of being; the other dismantles any authorial subjection that comes its way. Makdisi confused the raison d’être of humanism and scholasticism because of their common source in Arabic language. He made that mistake because he never seriously considered the equally important domain of Persian (or Turkish or Urdu) literary humanism. The Arabic language of Arabic literary humanism and the Arabic language of the Qur’an and of the scholasticism it caused and occasioned confused Makdisi to the point that he did not see the categorical difference of language in one vis-à-vis the other. Makdisi by intellectual disposition and linguistic competence had an Arabic-centered and westward view of Islamic civilization, which was both the source of his exquisite scholarship and the blind spot in his insights. He believed that “the combined periods of rise and development of both movements [humanism and scholasticism] stretch roughly from the ﬁ rst/seventh century to about the eighth/fourteenth. Both movements begin in eastern Islam, and move westward from Iraq, to Syria, Egypt and the rest of North Africa, Spain and Sicily, and from there to other parts of the Christian West.”23 This was his crucial mistake, that he looked westward and that as a Christian he was preoccupied with the movement of humanism westward and toward Christianity and the Latin West. In doing this, he categorically missed the Persian domain of literary humanism, eastward from Baghdad, to Shiraz and Isfahan, Hamdan and Khurasan, Herat, Tashkent, and Samarqand, and all the way to Bengal and back eastward to the Ottoman domains. This eastward movement of literary humanism on its Persian wings had nothing to do with the Latin West. It had everything to do with the multifaceted domains of Islamic civilization itself. The undue anxiety of inﬂuence, that “Islam” had inﬂuenced “the West,” and the ﬂawed Arab-centric reading of the spectrum of Islamic civilization combined to send the great Makdisi off on the wrong track. Makdisi’s preoccupation with proving the inﬂuence of Islamic humanism on the Latin West was a major animus of his scholarship. “The arrival of the two movements in the Christian West was at about the same time, in the second half of the eleventh century; but the sequence of their full development was the reverse of that of Islam.” His attention to the Latin West inevitably forced the direction of his reading of both humanism and scholasticism westward, where he was adamant to prove Islamic inﬂuence. “The evidence is overwhelmingly,” he believed, “in\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nfavor of the reception of both movements, scholasticism and humanism, from classical Islam by the Christian Latin West. It is generally known that this inﬂuence existed in such ﬁelds as philosophy and medicine, mainly because of the translation of books in those and other ﬁelds of the sciences, from Arabic to Latin, as well as the adoption of Arabic terms. It is however not generally known that books in the ﬁeld of humanistic studies have also been translated from Arabic to Latin and other European languages, and that terms of humanism in the West are terms of classical Arabic humanism.”24 Makdisi’s preoccupation with the direction of that inﬂuence in humanism and scholasticism was of course a reaction to the presumed centrality of “the West” in the Mediterranean cultural universe and would make sense by way of offering a different take on the genesis and disposition of that universe. But it becomes positively distracting and distorting when the focus is shifted to the character and disposition of both scholasticism and humanism in the Muslim world itself. Here Makdisi made the crucial mistake of not seeing humanism as an institution sui generis, because he never considered Arabic humanism in its immediate neighborhood of Persian (or Turkish or Urdu) literary humanism, and the Arabic language of Arabic literary humanism and the Arabic language of the Qur’an and the scholasticism it had occasioned misdirected him toward a common course of causality for both. Persian literary humanism— as indeed Arabic, Turkish, or Urdu— emerged as the self-revelatory aesthetic subtext of an entire civilization with an assured historicality that was embedded in its parabolic language. The overriding indeterminacy of the knowing subject at the heart of this literary humanism— an always self-effacing narrator (an Adami) that becomes the alter ego of his audience—made of this literary humanism an institution that was the binary opposition of nothing, for it was rooted in the cosmopolitan character of successive empires with a worldly disposition to their will to power. If Islamic scholasticism was in the business of sustaining and regulating those empires, multiple literary humanisms (in the plurality of languages and cultures that peopled those empires), the Persian included, were in the habit of disturbing their dreams, while entertaining their courts. Persian literary humanism was a Trojan horse—world conquerors invited Persian poets and literati to their courts as their victory trophies at their own risk, for they never knew—no one ever knows—when the courtiers\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nwere fast asleep what swordsmen existed in the belly of those handsomely crafted panegyrics to wreak havoc on what delusions of power.\n\nLiterary Humanism in the Face of Philosophical Antihumanism It is impossible to exaggerate the beauty, elegance, and Dionysian ecstasy running through Sadi’s lyrical poetry. There are three undisputed masters of Persian ghazal: Sadi, Rumi, and Hafez. But while Hafez’s ghazals exude a powerful philosophical resonance, and Rumi’s a mystical, Sadi’s ﬂaunt a robust and physical worldliness. Physical love and expansive eroticism— an eroticism that is unabashedly and freely bisexual and homoerotic at one and the same time (for in Persian there is no genderspeciﬁc pronoun)— are the deﬁning tropes of Sadi’s lyrical poetry. Not a knowing but a lyrical subject remains evasively at the center of Sadi’s ghazals. The notion of a unitary— autonomous and purposefully conscious— subject entirely disappears at the instant of reading a ghazal by Sadi. As the author of all metaphysical certainties, the knowing subject will get lost in the labyrinth of Sadi’s lyricism, where he chases after a butterﬂy that makes him dance to its colorful rhythm entirely unbeknownst to himself. The lyrical undoing of the unitary subject (as the core concept of all metaphysics) is deﬁnitive in Sadi’s poetry. The inebriated consciousness and the worldly unreliability of that lyrical subject displace the all-knowing subject at the center of all scholasticism— Islamic or otherwise. The multiply split lyrical subject is constituted by not just a double, but a manifold, bind— at once alienated from itself (for it is always somewhere else) and yet paradoxically self-discovering (for there it discovers its alterity). As it leaves the realm of the real and enters into the imaginary, the lyrical subject becomes self-metaphorizing, allegorical to itself. Here the subject is a lyrical construct, interpolated by the effects of a soft power it imagines and dismantles at one and the same time. Notice the poetic dissolution of the lyrical “I” as I do an almost verbatim translation of one of Sadi’s most famous ghazals: I will never rise from this drunkard ecstasy for as long as I live For I did not even exist when you sat so sovereign upon my heart. You are not like the sun, now visible now not, Others come and go, you just stay the same. So many sad stories I had to tell when I am away from you, But once you showed up you close all doors to complaint.\n\n18\n\nIntroduction Come and visit your friends for seeing you once Is a thousand times better than writing a greeting or sending a gift. Come and see me now that you have broken my heart from separation, And be a cure to my ailing heart, caught in your snare. No wonder you will strike at the heart of your enemies on the day of battle, When you break the heart of your friends when away from them. As for you the learned man of law— leave us to God! You have your abstinence and piety, and leave me to my love and ecstasy. You should abandon your knowing heart to a person you love, For once you have a direction to pray to, you will never take yourself so seriously. When fortune and success are not gained by striving too hard, What are we to do except to serve and be obedient. Complaining from separation from those you love and the hardship of the world Is unbecoming of you, Sadi, cut yourself short and be free.25\n\nSadi’s lyrical subject is epiphenomenal. That lyrical subjective is deﬁ nitive to the makeup of Persian literary humanism. But how would that lyrical subject posit the literary humanism that it sustains vis-à-vis a historical antihumanism that today dismantles any solid supposition of a knowing subject— the writer or the reader—who will encounter and counter that literary humanism? There is no writing (about) any literary humanism today without facing that philosophical conundrum. The active retrieval of Persian literary humanism for a contemporary audience living consciously in the present age faces the fact of a philosophical antihumanism that would make it look, ipso facto, archaic, exotic, or at best a casual walk down the halls of a museum. It is not. It should not be. That philosophical antihumanism, deeply rooted in contemporary self-awareness of the globe, must be faced directly before that literary humanism is allowed to present and posit itself. The death of the Christian God (Nietzsche) as an omniscient subject of the European history in the nineteenth century and the subsequent death of the European man (Foucault) as an autonomous subject in the twentieth on the same continent and upon the same moral clime are matters of domestic European provenance and scarce have had reason to reach the metaphysical underpinning of worlds stretched to the colonial\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nedges of that self-centered metropolitan imagination. When the Christian God and his counterpart the European man were declared dead, the news barely reached or when it did even less did it matter at the colonial edges of European postmodernity. Though the philosophical propensity toward antihumanism took a particular poignancy in the post-Holocaust anxiety of Europe, and rightly so, the challenge that the centrality of an all-knowing subject at the heart of Enlightenment humanism of JeanJacques Rousseau (1712–1778) and Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) faced goes back to the middle of the nineteenth century. As early as 1843, Karl Marx had criticized the notion of an abstract “human” in “On the Jewish Question,” in which he had questioned the entire notion of “rights” as an expression of the capitalist mode of production, a proposition that had reduced humans to mere abstraction. By 1887, in his Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche too had equated “humanism” with the theology of the weak. Later in the nineteenth century, in his psychoanalytic theories, Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) had excavated deep into the unconscious of the knowing subject and demonstrated its nonrational disposition. If the European Enlightenment invented the “human” in particularly poignant and powerful and all-knowing terms, almost coterminous with that momentous event were the critics of that assumption, from Marx and Nietzsche to Freud and Dostoyevsky, who exposed the fault lines of the “human” that had made that very narrative possible. Midway through the twentieth century, philosophical antihumanism was to ﬁnd even deeper grounds. In his philosophical project, Martin Heidegger rejected the notion of humans as autonomous agents and criticized the grounding of philosophy in abstract consciousness, most ostensibly in fact in his “Letter on Humanism” (1946). Addressing the question Jean Beaufret had addressed to him, “Can we restore meaning to the word ‘humanism,’ ” Heidegger responded, “I wonder whether that is necessary. Or is the damage caused by all such terms still not sufﬁciently obvious?”26 For Heidegger the assumption of “I think” as the condition of human liberty and autonomy is fundamentally ﬂawed, given his philosophical rejection of the Cartesian cogito. After Heidegger, Louis Althusser (1918–1990) revived the Marxist rejection of individual consciousness and retrieved its reliance on social relations and collective behavior in the manufacturing of the dialectical making of the knowing subject. After Althusser, Jacques Derrida outlined, beginning in 1967 with his De la grammatologie (Of Grammatology), the philosophical contours\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nof the decentered subject due to the uncertain disposition of language that enables the very possibility of speech. Almost simultaneous with Derrida, Foucault underlined in his Les Mots et les choses (Order of Things) (1966), as had in fact Thomas Kuhn in his Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolution (1962) before him, the epistemic/paradigmatic nature of knowledge production that has accidentally centered “man” as its knowing subject and that it was about to overcome it. By declaring “The Death of the Author” (1967), Roland Barthes pronounced the death of the selfsame man. In telling the story of Persian literary humanism one cannot pretend that this long and powerful philosophical antihumanism did not exist, for that pretension will ipso facto render any such history as an exercise in either Orientalist fantasy or else nationalist historiography of an entirely outdated provenance. Positing Iran or Islam in its current postcolonial condition does not entirely resolve the issue either, for the larger philosophical problem of antihumanism is not the only obstacle that the writing of a Persian literary humanism faces. There is another, even more urgent, issue that is more immediate in its own vicinity. It is impossible to imagine the making of Persian literary humanism in the context of successive imperial iterations without coming to terms with the fact that “Persian” literary humanism has been achieved at the heavy cost of repressing, denying, dismissing, belittling, and denigrating the non-Persian elements within the Iranian cultural universe. The eloquence of Persian literary humanism, precisely by virtue of its successive imperial iterations, is predicated on the silencing of non-Persian languages and dialects under the reign of the same dynasties that enabled and privileged Persians as the ornament of their courts. Based on Middle (Pahlavi) and Ancient (Avestan) Persian, the Modern Persian (the Islamic period) was intensely aware of its imperial pedigree and thus fed itself into successive dynasties in its Islamic history. As an ancient imperial language, Persian posited itself against the emerging dominance of Arabic, which soon became the lingua franca of successive Muslim empires. Next to Arabic (which in both scholasticism and humanism emerged as the imperial language of successive Islamic empires), Persian was soon to be rivaled by Turkish— after Persian served generations of Turkic dynasties such as the Ghaznavids and the Seljuqids as their courtly language of administration— as the imperial language and literature of three almost simultaneous empires: the Ottomans, the Safavids, and the Mughals. Persian was thus no mere “vernacular\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\ncosmopolitanism” settled to and satisﬁed with that dubious designation. It always carried its cosmopolitan imperialism up its sleeve, as it were. Equally important is the emplotment of the rise of Persian literary humanism next to the politically dominant Arabic cosmopolitan imperialism—in administrative, scientiﬁc, scholastic, and humanist traditions. It is only next to that Arabic cosmopolitan imperialism that Persian would look like a “vernacular cosmopolitanism” by virtue of its decidedly peripheralized neighborhood with respect to Arabic. Retrieving Persian literary humanism during an antihumanist philosophical age thus posits a double bind: marking its modern anticolonial humanism as a bona ﬁde project by way of recognizing its ancient and medieval imperial pedigree. As Persian became peripherally vernacular and the language of cultural resistance to Arabic imperialism next to an imperial Arabic in the western Islamic world, so non-Persian languages and dialects became equally (if not more) peripheralized and silenced next to the imperial Persian in the eastern Islamic world. That historical fact gave Persian language and literature their innately paradoxical and split subject positions, which in addition to the centrality of the lyrical subject in its narrative makeup have posited Persian literary humanism as a mimetically transient act predicated on both politically unstable and aesthetically contingent modes of subjection. These historical particularities of Persian literary humanism give it a uniquely poignant position when it comes to facing the philosophical antihumanism of our own time, for the rise of antihumanism in its European context was predicated on the constitution of the sovereign subject—from Aristotle to Kant— as the prima facie evidence of the all-knowing cogito facing an all-knowable world. The multiply split subject—from its lyrical to its conﬂ icted dispositions— at the heart of Persian literary humanism was never predicated on an all-knowing, self-appointed agency, nor did that absolutist assumption of agency ever cause any havoc around the globe (from colonialism to the Holocaust), for it to be now reprimanded and robbed of its troublesome sovereignty. The lyrical subject is constitutionally amorphous, and the paradoxical subject position—weak and vernacular next to imperial Arabic, imperial and cosmopolitan next to all other subimperial languages to the east of the Islamic world— disallows any assumption of absolutist sovereignty. The result is the centrality of a fragile Adami who was never imagined to have the illusion\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nof sovereignty to begin with for a philosophical rise of antihumanism— from Nietzsche and Heidegger to Derrida and Foucault— to come and put it in its right place. In its self-rupturing fragility, Adami is the epitome of what the contemporary Italian phi losopher Gianni Vattimo calls “il pensiero debole” (weak thought). It thinks, but softly.27 To see more clearly through these particularities of Persian literary humanism, we will greatly beneﬁt from a closer look at one of the most astute theorists and staunchest defenders of (literary) humanism of our own time. In the age of philosophical antihumanism of varied origins and as a leading literary critic of his generation, Edward Said remained a politically steadfast and theoretically beleaguered humanist. In this theoretical belligerence he was of course up against some mighty philosophical forces—from Husserl and Heidegger to Derrida and Foucault, from poststructuralism to postmodernism. On many occasions, Edward Said responded extensively to charges of “residual humanism” in his work, in his groundbreaking Orientalism in particular. In his 1995 afterword to Orientalism, he wrote, “among American and British academics of a decidedly rigorous and unyielding stripe, Orientalism, and indeed all of my other work, has come in for disapproving attacks because of its ‘residual’ humanism, its theoretical inconsistencies, its insufﬁcient, perhaps even sentimental, treatment of agency. I am glad that it has! Orientalism is a partisan book, not a theoretical machine.”28 This was of course a decidedly political response and not a theoretical argument— a reaction that nevertheless remains a testimony to the centrality of the issue in Edward Said’s work. In his 2003 preface to Orientalism, Said continued to insist on this humanistic predilection: “My idea in Orientalism is to use humanistic critique to open up the ﬁelds of struggle. . . . I have called what I try to do “humanism,” a word I continue to use stubbornly despite the scornful dismissal of the term by sophisticated post-modern critics.”29 Said’s “stubborn humanism,” as he put it, came to a ﬁ nal theoretical articulation in his ﬁ rst posthumous book, Humanism and Democratic Criticism (2004), in which he resumes a dialogue with James Clifford’s detection of the central paradox of the sovereign subject and essentialism in Orientalism. Early in Humanism and Democratic Criticism, Said admits: In many ways Clifford was right, since during the 1960’s and 1970’s the advent of the French theory in the humanistic departments of Ameri-\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\ncan and English universities had brought about a severe if not crippling defeat of what was considered traditional humanism by the forces of structuralism and post-structuralism, both of which professed the death of man-the-author and asserted the preeminence of antihumanist systems such as those found in the work of Lévi-Strauss, Foucault himself, and Roland Barthes. The sovereignty of the subject— to use the technical phrase for what Enlightenment thought did with Descartes’ notion of the cogito, which was to make it the center of all human knowledge and hence capable of essentializing thought in itself—was challenged by what Foucault and Lévi-Strauss carried forward from the work of thinkers such as Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, and the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. This group of pioneers showed, in effect, that the existence of systems of thinking and perceiving transcended the power of individual subjects, individual humans who were inside those systems (systems such as Freud’s “unconscious” or Marx’s “capital”) and therefore had no power over them, only the choice either to use or be used by them. This of course ﬂatly contradicts the core of humanistic thought, and hence the individual cogito was displaced, or demoted, to the status of illusory autonomy or ﬁction.30\n\nHaving made this admission, Edward Said then proceeds to articulate his vision of humanism, pointing out that he did not agree with “the argument put forward in the wake of structuralist antihumanism by postmodernism or by its dismissive attitudes to what Jean-Francois Lyotard famously called the grand narratives of enlightenment and emancipation.”31 Instead, he insists that there is a kind of nontotalizing, nonessentializing humanism that he advocates and describes as being critical of humanism in the name of humanism, and that schooled in its “abuses by the experiences of Eurocentrism and empire, one could fashion a different kind of humanism that was cosmopolitan and text and languagebound in ways that absorbed the great lessons of the past from, say, Erich Auerbach and Leo Spitzer and more recently from Richard Poirier.”32 Said then spends the rest of his book articulating the particular terms of his democratic criticism, “text and language-bound” (literary) as it is, paving the way toward a more inclusive humanism by opening it up to other, repressed, forms of humanism. This defense of humanism by Edward Said, in effect trying to separate humanism as such from European and Eurocentric humanists, did not sit well even with his closest followers. “So, who is responsible for the divorce of the cultural realm from questions of power,” asks Rajagopalan\n\n24\n\nIntroduction\n\nRadhakrishnan in a poignant criticism of Edward Said’s persistent defense of humanism, in which he points “the ﬁ nger quite steadily at humanists and intellectuals. These are the folks who have set up a kind of ‘camouﬂage’ whereby literature is always already exonerated from its real, and often brutal, implications in the real world of power, empire, dominance, exploitation, suffering, and subjugation.”33 Radhakrishnan rightly identiﬁes the root cause: “If humanists and intellectuals . . . are to blame, what then of ‘humanism’ as a historic-political, culturalideological, and epistemic domain that generates these humanists?”34 While Michel Foucault had systematically targeted humanism as the modus operandi of a beleaguered modernity that ipso facto also entailed ethnocentrism, Eurocentrism, and colonialism, Edward Said took pains to make a distinction between humanism and humanists. But Radhakrishnan insists that “the abuses that were committed in the name of humanism, contrary to Said, I would argue were very much in the spirit of humanism: the abuses are a form of compliance in the ‘essentialism of humanism,’ its anchorage in the a priori of the dominant discourse of the West.”35 As Radhakrishnan rightly recognizes, Said’s answer to this dilemma was never even to his own full theoretical satisfaction. But at the end, “Said does give us an answer,” Radhakrishnan admits, “and that answer is profoundly literary. The cosmopolitan reality is text and language bound. It is in the domain of literature and aesthetics that the cosmopolitan worldview is realized as an ideal order. . . . Cosmopolitanism is aesthetic/literary humanism at its subtle best.”36 This direction of humanism toward literary humanism opens a liberating venue, for in it both Said and Radhakrishnan are paving the ground for a much wider and potentially more globally democratic domain of dealing with philosophical antihumanism and the epistemic crisis that the assumption of a sovereign subject has faced. To face that challenge, Said, to be sure, did more than just posit the literary as the domain in which humanism can be salvaged. To see the signiﬁcance and the direction of Said’s solution, however, we ﬁ rst need to remember Fanon’s. “Leave this Europe,” Fanon demanded, “where they are never done talking of Man, yet murder men everywhere they ﬁ nd them, at the corner of every one of their own streets, in all the corners of the globe. For centuries they have stiﬂed almost the whole of\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nhumanity in the name of a so-called spiritual experience. Look at them today swaying between atomic and spiritual disintegration. . . . When I search for Man in the technique and the style of Eu rope, I see only a succession of negations of man, and an avalanche of murders.” Predicated on this bitter and battle-fatigued recognition, Fanon’s solution was inaugural: “Let us waste no time in sterile litanies and nauseating mimicry. . . . Let us decide not to imitate Europe; let us combine our muscles and our brains in a new direction. Let us try to create the whole man, whom Europe has been incapable of bringing to triumphant birth.”37 One might argue that Edward Said spent a lifetime trying to answer Fanon’s last call in the making of his own literary humanism, the democratic supplementarity of European humanism, and not a radical reversal or abandonment or dismantling of it altogether. The supplementarity that Said contemplated might be considered a potential summation between the empirical of Eurocentrism and the transcendental of an open-ended literary humanism that sublated Europe to the world. His project in the end was to help transform humanism into multiple sites of varied humanisms (in plural) and thus turn the project into an open-ended organicity that consistently corrected its own blind spots. Said’s criticism of the limited imagination of Eurocentric humanism pushed forward by calling for the organic growth of the project by multiplying it into other non-European humanities. Referring speciﬁcally to the two works of George Makdisi on the rise of humanism in Islam, Said joins him in criticizing Eurocentric scholars like Jakob Burckhardt and Paul Oskar Kristeller for having located the rise of humanism exclusively in Europe, disregarding at least 200 years of history of humanism in Muslim contexts.38 Literary humanism for Said thus emerged as the modus operandi of overcoming the conundrum of antihumanism— a form of literary humanism, of course, that itself did not fall into the trap of nationalist identitarianism of one kind or another. It therefore seems to me that we must begin to rid ourselves, consciously and resolutely, of the whole complex of attitudes associated not just with Eurocentrism but with identity itself, which can no longer be tolerated in humanism as easily as it was before and during the Cold War. Taking their cue from the literature, thought, and art of our time, humanists must recognize with some alarm that the politics of identity and the\n\n26\n\nIntroduction nationalistically grounded system of education remains at the core of what most of us actually do, despite charged boundaries and objects of research.39\n\nThat warning is particularly noteworthy in the case of Persian literary historiography, which has been invariably tied to Iranian nation-building projects and national identity politics, whether sponsored by the Pahlavi monarchy (1926–1979), the Islamic Republic, or even anticolonial and anti-totalitarian literary narratives. Contrary to these projects, the historical fact of Persian literary humanism is that its worldly domain has always been cross-national and transnational, and in fact, it has been the poetic subtext of successive imperial mappings of the region and attained at the heavy cost of silencing subnational languages and literatures.40 So as the literary canons and varied iterations of humanism are multiplied and expanded, so Edward Said thought, so must the emancipatory politics of literary humanism be wedded to larger domains beyond national boundaries. In the course of this book I will demonstrate that Edward Said’s project for expanding and multiplying humanism in varied, “nonWestern,” directions, and thus saving it, ultimately fails and does not resolve the far more serious theoretical problem that humanism as such faces today. At the heart of contemporary philosophical antihumanism remains the enduring crisis of the all-knowing subject, a crisis that by simply driving the site of humanism in multiple directions we are not resolving, but are in fact exacerbating. The literary answer to that philosophical crisis must be sought elsewhere. It is the nature of the literary act and the precarious disposition of its varied and multiple subject positions that are the deﬁ ning modes of literary humanism, and it is in those terms that literature qua literature does not face the cul de sac of philosophical antihumanism. What will sustain my course of argument throughout this book is the proposition that Persian literary humanism was an epiphenomenon, for no false authorizing subject, partaking in the absolute alterity of any viable God-term as its absolutist transcendence, had authorized either its nomos/law or its logos/reason (not to be confused with logos/sokhan of Persian literary humanism)— for it had claim to none. All of these varied strategies can be, by way of a poetic metaphor, seen as predicated on the moment when Sadi admonishes his readers:\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\n“You should abandon your knowing heart to a person you love / For once you have a direction to pray to, you will never take yourself so seriously.” Redirecting the presumption of the knowing self to the certainty of an unknown alterity: precisely there, upon that lyrical turn is the subject forever decentered.\n\nThe Decentered Subject of Persian Literary Humanism Sadi’s Golestan is divided into eight chapters. That division is not by later editors and is integral to the text. Sadi in his introduction, and in his own narrative voice, says that he has divided his book into the following eight chapters: “On the Manners of Kings,” “On the Ethics of Ascetics,” “On the Virtues of Abstinence,” “On the Beneﬁts of Silence,” “On Love and Youth,” “On Weakness and Aging,” “On the Inﬂuence of Education,” and “On the Proper Etiquette of Companionship.” He has divided his Golestan into eight chapters, he says, just like Paradise, which has eight gates.41 Eight gates into Paradise— and eight entries into Golestan. It is easy to see a number of formal binaries in operation in these titles and divisions—kings and beggars, youth and aging, eloquence and silence, companionship and solitude, and so on. In each set of binaries, and indeed throughout the text, Sadi seeks to strike a balance, a golden mean, that comes together from avoiding the extremities of two goods that become evil when carried too much to their own ends— such as in his famous dictum that “two things are the signs of a dull wit: speaking when you ought to be silent, and silence when you ought to speak!” The lyrically and loquaciously fragile subject, narratively held together for the ﬂeeting moment at the heart of Sadi’s moral imagination to suggest a dictum, is thus posited not by an avoidance of two evils in the vacated space of their absence, but in fact by the ability to hold two divergent and opposing goods (silence in its time and eloquence in its time) from running to their evil consequences. The judicious choice, as a result, requires a constant vigilance that enables a versatile agency, a supple subject. What is evident but dispersed in the logic and rhetoric of the organization of the Golestan chapters is also a narratively hidden balance that holds the whole text, and with it the moral of all its stories, together. There is also a more immediate (again hidden) metaphor that anticipates all these narrative mis-en-scènes in Golestan. The whole structural architecture of the text, as it is, is contingent on the preparatory staging of it\n\n28\n\nIntroduction\n\nin a famous prolegomena in which Sadi informs his readers how it happened that he decided to write this book. After an elaborate, exceedingly verbose, and patently eloquent introductory showcasing and ﬂaunting of his exquisite command of Persian and Arabic prose and poetry, Quranic allusions, and ancient wisdom, Sadi informs his readers that at the age of ﬁ fty, when his reputation as a great poet and prose stylist was in fact at its height, he decided to become a recluse and to live the rest of his life in solitude and silence. One of his friends (here partaking in a very common narrative trope) comes to pay Sadi a visit precisely at the moment when he had sworn to solitude and silence. Initially Sadi refuses to talk to this friend. But after a while he yields to his friend’s request and speaks and tells him of his decision. The friend is of course astounded and saddened to hear this decision and insists that Sadi should do no such thing and must resume being the model of eloquence that he is, for “a tongue hidden in a mouth is like a key to the treasure trove of an eloquent person.”42 While they are engaged in this conversation, the two friends leave Sadi’s house for a walk. This incident is happening during the season of spring in Shiraz and the two friends go for a casual stroll around the city and end up spending the night in a beautiful garden of a mutual friend, where they have a memorable banquet. In the morning, when they are about to leave, Sadi notices that his friend has put together a bouquet of freshly cut ﬂowers to take home. At this point Sadi turns to his friend and tells him not to bother with these fresh ﬂowers for in a few days they will perish. “What am I to do,” the friend asks, to which Sadi says, “for the delight of those who will observe and to teach eloquence to those who will read it I will write my Golestan, upon whose ﬂowers the wind of autumn will have no affect, and the passage of time will never turn the feast of its spring to the frigidity of the winter.” Golestan, literally “ﬂower garden” (or “rose garden”), is thus composed of ﬂowers that will never perish. Sadi ﬁ nishes his introduction by telling his readers that the spring season in Shiraz was still around and fresh ﬂowers abounding when he had ﬁ nished his Golestan. There is something metaphor ical ly urgent, fragile, and ephemeral at the heart of Sadi’s Golestan and the narrative cause of its composition— so that one reads every line, every poem, every story with that lingering sense of urgency (of a ﬂower now beautiful and aromatic and gone the next moment) on one’s mind. The entire opening gambit of Golestan\n\nIntroduction\n\n29\n\nbegins by offering eight chapters of the book as if offering eight gates to Paradise, sustains the agential autonomy of the moralist entirely contingent on the delicate balance of not allowing two contrary goods (silence and eloquence) to result in evil consequences, continues with a paradoxical citation of eloquence describing a poet’s decision to be silent, and concludes with leaving the enduring memory of fragile and perishable ﬂowers lingering on every word and phrase that is gathered in Golestan. What remains throughout the text is the idea of eloquence emerging from silence and creating metaphoric ﬂowers (in prose and poetry) that will never die, and yet precisely by virtue of the aroma of that metaphor the allegory of the freshly cut ﬂowers remains hanging from the diction of the prose and poetry that is Golestan— celebrating endurance in impermanence, beauty in fragility, immortality in mortality. The fractured subject that permeates this narrative is deﬁ nitive to the ﬁctive transparency of Persian literary humanism. When we look at Persian literature in general, a number of key factors deﬁ ne its par tic ular idiomaticity— all of them coming together to constitute an entirely uncertain and wavering subject deﬁ ning the horizons of its open-ended manners and modes of signiﬁcations, intelligibilities, and symbiosis of signs and meanings. If lyricism were to be considered the deﬁ ning moment of this literature (Sadi, Rumi, and Hafez), the uncertain gender of the beloved emerges as the destabilizing force that ascertains its poetic disposition, in which masculinity and femininity are decidedly undecided. The lyrical subject— thus made metaphorical ly fragile— at the heart of Persian lyricism is ipso facto decentered, unreliable, evasive. That already decentered subject is further fragmented and made uncertain by the gender-neutral Persian pronoun, which becomes frivolously interpolated with the bisexuality and homoeroticism vastly evident in Persian lyrical poetry. This homoeroticism becomes particularly poignant in the ghazals of Rumi, whose poetry further exacerbates, obfuscates, and camouﬂages this decentered subject. If, alternatively, we were to consider the epic proportions of Persian literature (Ferdowsi in particular), it will emerge as the literary heritage of an imperial conﬁdence now cast in the form of ﬁguratively dominated subjects when placed next to the triumphant (colonizing) Arabic language and literature— a fact that paradoxically casts Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh as the triumphant memory of a rebellious people remembering themselves at the time of their political defeat. This exposes yet\n\n30\n\nIntroduction\n\nanother layer of a split subject writing Persian literary humanism— at once politically defeated and poetically triumphant. The entire spectrum of Persian literature thus appears as an expansive event spreading eastward into successive empires from Iran to central to south Asia, and yet localized by virtue of its neighborhood to the political triumphalism of Arabic literary, scientiﬁc, and scholastic traditions moving westward into the Mediterranean domain. In the very same vein, Persian literary imagination appears as an imperial cosmopolitanism made to look vernacular by virtue of being adjacent to the mighty Arabic cosmopolitanism that had already laid a solid claim on the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, in the body politic of three globalized empires of the Ghaznavids (tenth to twelfth century), the Seljuqids (early eleventh to late twelfth century), and the Mongols (thirteenth to fourteenth century) Persian literature ﬂourished into a manifest imperial imagination staging its otherwise latent defeats— a paradox that made Persian poets and literati creatively passive-aggressive in overcoming and outstaging their Arab counterparts. The fragmentation of the authorial subject moves from lyrical and epic into panegyric (chief among its medieval master practitioners Manouchehri, Onsori, and Asjadi) romance (Nezami Ganjavi in par tic ular), and ﬁ nally comes to a crescendo, in terms of its varied narrative dispositions, in the abundance of the karamat literature dealing with saintly miracles (with Sanai, Attar, Rumi, and Jami as the main beacons). The magic/realism that informs the creative imagination of the karamat (miracle literature) dances around any possibility of a centered subject that might come its way. What in fact we are witnessing in the karamat literature, with Farid al-Din Attar’s (1145–1221) Tadhkirat al-Awlia (Biographies of Saint) and Muhammad ibn Munawwar’s Asrar al-Tawhid ﬁ Maqamat al-Sheikh Abu Sa©id (Secrets of Uniﬁcation: On the Spiritual Attainments of al-Sheykh Abu Sa©id), composed in 1178, is the complete breakdown of any presumed logical connection between the signiﬁer and the signiﬁed— in which the act of signiﬁcation can mean very little outside the sacred narrative. As is evident in these seminal texts, which are among the absolute masterpieces of Persian prose, the karamat literature basically attributes the knowledge of the unseen and of the unheard to Suﬁ saints and also attributes to them solid command over the animal kingdom and other strange and extraordinary abilities that\n\nIntroduction\n\n31\n\nsimply break down any and all assumptions of reason. Whether these attributions are read literally or ﬁguratively, their allegorical disposition gives them the character of a magic/realism that suspends any assumption of a centered reason or a knowing subject.43 There are many other aspects of Persian literary humanism—when considered as a miasmatic movement across genres, generations, and historic spans— that speak to the amorphous disposition of their multiple narrating subjects, such as the fact that in the case of the karamat literature many miraculous attributions have been added to the text by subsequent generations, which fact makes the question of single and identiﬁable authorship entirely untenable. The result of all these varied factors in the making of Persian literary humanism is that the narrating subjects are not just always ﬁguratively decentered—they are in fact positively miasmatic, narratively performative, dialogically imperceptive, and above all hermeneutically contingent on shifting audiences that receive or canonize them in one way or another. Compared to the vast whirlwind of decentered subjectivity thus narratively and poetically performed in Persian literary humanism, what today passes as a radical critique of the subject is in fact exceedingly limited and even arrested. The combined effect of multiple and metamorphic modes of decentered subjection feeds on itself to make the emotive center of Persian literary humanism always amorphous, invariably somewhere else, with never a single all-knowing subject in sight to question and/or dismantle. In contemporary deconstructive works of theorists like the distinguished feminist phi losopher Judith Butler, in which the site of the body is examined as the stage of gendered performances, this playful mode of decentered subjection in literary arts placed outside the horizons of “English and Comparative Literature” (by way of what Gayatri Spivak has aptly called “sanctioned ignorance”) results in a critique of the subject that has been entirely ﬁ xated into just one form or another (race, gender, or class) and not the combined effect of all and more. Judith Butler’s move to emphasize the role of acting in performing gender appears as critical only when compared to the foundational metaphysical thinking that Derrida (the principle philosophical inspiration for Butler) has sought to dismantle. But compared with the playful frivolity of incessant and open-ended desubjections deﬁ nitive to a literary imagination that like many others has been made alien, inaccessible,\n\n32\n\nIntroduction\n\nexotic, and peripheral— or else turned into an object of curiosity for “world literature”— such moves in fact remain limited within a very narrow European philosophical provincialism. Take the homoerotic and cross-sexual ambiguity of the object of desire in Persian lyricism alone (one among a multitude of other literary idiomaticities) and see how it preempts any notion of a ﬁxed, gendered, and autochthonic subject position, the way that, for example, Judith Butler proposes gender, sex, and sexuality are socially performed and ritually ﬁxated. The proposition that “the materiality of sex is constructed through a ritualized repetition of norms”44 leaves much more than “sex” outside of similarly ritualized repetitions, to which the subject, dodging here, might retreat. The principal target of Butler’s critique, and quite rightly so, is of course the formation of a mode of “humanism” that is predicated on that repressively solidiﬁed, identiﬁed, undifferentiated, and consolidated subject: The ideal of transforming all excluded identiﬁcations into exclusive features— of appropriating all difference into unity—would mark the return to a Hegelian synthesis which has no exterior and that, in appropriating all difference as exemplary features of itself, becomes a ﬁgure for imperialism, a ﬁgure that installs itself by way of a romantic, insidious, and all-consuming humanism.45\n\nThat identiﬁcation of humanism with imperialism, through the intermediary functioning of an undifferentiated subject, is the central and poignant issue here, an obstacle that Edward Said dies not being able to resolve, except through stubborn persistence on trying “to correct” humanism. But the presumption of that undifferentiated subject is also where Persian literary humanism radically—far more radically than anything imagined here in Butler’s critique— parts ways with her (and others’) critique of humanism. The lyrically depunctuated subject of a literary act that is always already decentered is not autochthonic, because it never originated where it is found, whereas in the ritualized subject position of gender and sexuality, the way Judith Butler understands it, it is. Borrowing from Foucault’s notion of “regulative discourse,” Judith Butler in her widely celebrated Gender Trouble (1990), and later in her Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of “Sex” (1993), has argued that through the repetitively stylized social acts, performances of gender, sex, and sexuality are ritually produced, regulated, and made to\n\nIntroduction\n\n33\n\nlook natural, and thus manage to masquerade themselves as ontologically solid. In the received and reconstituted “frameworks of intelligibility” socially sanctioned behaviors thus become innately “natural.” Performing regular and regulated stylized actions stages the gender for political foregrounding in relations of power. The performative disposition of the act makes it at once natural and even ontically self-evident. The iterability (Derrida’s term) of the act, meanwhile, systematically ritualizes the social production of gender and sexuality under the constant threat of ostracism. By being effectively heterochthonic (as opposed to auto- and not homo-), the lyrically emancipated subject at the heart of Persian literary humanism mimetically camouﬂages its evasive positions. It is nowhere to be found. The idea of subject formation as performance was of course not entirely new or original, and some three to four decades before Judith Butler, the Canadian sociologist Erving Goffman had already done extensive work in the ﬁeld of symbolic interactionism in such groundbreaking works as Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior (1967), The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959), and ultimately in his Behavior in Public Places: Notes on the Social Organization of Gatherings (1963), he sought to decode the “body idiom” in various daily interactions. The advantage of Goffman’s much more socially (rather than discursively) based arguments, which even he in 1959 thought “hardly novel,”46 are that he had theorized the theatricality and the performative disposition of selves in varied public domains, emphasizing the dramaturgical analysis in social interactions. Goffman considered these public performances as integral to the socialization process, performances that are “idealized” in multiple ways. That these perfor mances are codiﬁed and hegemonic (and thus gender and sexuality forming, among other things) is perfectly evident in Goffman’s assertion that “when the individual presents himself before others, his per for mance will tend to incorporate and exemplify the ofﬁcially accredited values of the society, more so, in fact, than does his behavior as a whole.” That very fact is equally evident in an earlier American sociologist Charles Cooley’s assertion, made back in 1922 and upon which Goffman relies, that “if we ever tried to seem a little better than we are, how could we improve or ‘train ourselves from outside inward?’ ”47 That training “from outside inward” is precisely where performativity of the public act becomes integral to the formation of the subject and her/his socially constituted corporeality. That\n\n34\n\nIntroduction\n\ncorporeality is always contingent on public perfor mances. Goffman had in fact likened social interaction to theatrical performances in which we even have a front stage, where the social actors perform what they gather to be positive and acceptable roles, in front of an audience, while in the backstage they kept what they thought was a more hidden or private repertoire of who and what they were— a place where the persons of the public personae, as it were, can be themselves and discard their public personae. In both Butler and Goffman, and before them in Charles Cooley, we are of course entirely in bourgeois (or what Goffman rightly called “Anglo-American”)48 social domains, and the crucial factors of literary traditions in imperial formations do not enter their reading of subject formation. In speciﬁcally European philosophical terms, the critique of humanism in contemporary European philosophy is ultimately predicated on a radical questioning of the unitary, autonomous, and undifferentiated subject that was at the center of the Cartesian (and later Kantian) cogito as a core concept of metaphysics. Following the Freudian explorations of the unconscious and Heidegger’s positing of Dasein, any notion of the autonomous (all-knowing) subject was altogether suspect. Jacques Lacan, building on Freud’s psychoanalytics, posited a “split subject” that is always limited by a double bind when leaving the real and entering the imaginary. Meanwhile, in the political and social realm, the combined effect of Althusser, Foucault, and Bourdieu was to posit the subject as an ideological construction and as the “effect” of power and “disciplines.”49 But beyond the limits of these legitimate critiques of the subject and the humanism that it posits, retrieving a literary humanism that at once informed and subverted vast cosmopolitan empires— by always remaining their alter ego, so that the very empires they helped legitimize carried within them the seeds of their own undoing—points to an entirely different mode of subject de/formation. When we open the domain of subject formation to Persian literary humanism, we ﬁ nd that the decentered subject has a much wider spectrum of operation and never presumed to be unitary, autonomous, or undifferentiated. Quite to the contrary, the decentered subject was expressed in multiple terms, not the least of which was the miasmatic cross-gendering of Persian language and literature. What I ultimately plan to demonstrate in this book is that the literary subconscious of a civilization is its paradoxical undoing, which may in fact in part account\n\nIntroduction\n\n35\n\nfor the active hostility of the Arabic masculinist culture against the consistently feminized Persian language and literature and character and culture, “accusing” Persians not only of effeminate delicacy and sexual misconduct50 but also of scientiﬁc and philosophical inaccuracy— a charge that may in part at least account for such leading Ira nian scholars and scientist as al-Biruni, Ibn Sina, and al-Ghazali opting to write most of their important and canonized work in Arabic.\n\nThe Case for Literary Worldliness Early in his Bustan, Sadi describes the reasons behind the composition of one of his two most famous texts—this entirely in poetry. “I have traveled all around the world,” he says, “Have been in the company of many people.” I have much learned from every corner of this world, From every crop I have gathered a share. I know of no people more noble Than the people of Shiraz— may their land be blessed! To anoint the noble people of this land, I have recollected what I have learned from Syria to Anatolia! For I thought it unfair from all those orchards To go empty-handed to my friends.51\n\nSadi is the worldliest of Persian poets and literati— so much so that traveling and getting to see the world, crossing boundaries, dwelling in alien or familiar, inhospitable or even hostile territories became metaphoric to his name, literary reputation, and work. Not only in his Bustan and Golestan, but throughout all his prose and poetry, a worldly disposition, a global vision, animates his vast cosmopolitan wisdom. Shiraz remains his hometown, which he deeply loves, and to which he always returns, both physically and metaphorically. But he always returns to Shiraz only to leave it. Not just the speciﬁc places that he visited, or imagined himself to have visited, but the world, the idea of the world, found a happy and wise habitat in his work and through it in the literary humanism that he best represented. In his cosmopolitan worldliness, Sadi is deﬁ nitive to Persian literary humanism— a multifaceted, cross-historical, and self-transformative phenomenon that was produced by generations of poets and prose stylists in dialectical negation of their location at successive imperial and\n\n36\n\nIntroduction\n\ndynastic courts, from the Samanids (819–1005) to the Qajars (1794– 1925)—in effect a Trojan horse too precious for monarchs and emperors to ignore, and yet too unruly to rein in with any courtly culture. The decentered and polysemous subjects that animated Persian literary humanism ultimately resolve themselves via an aesthetic cosmopolitanism, an expansive worldliness, that becomes the poetic subtext of a universalizing history. The language and diction of Persian literary humanism were and remained courtly, formal, and imperial, serving the cause of political imperialism, claiming a pre-Islamic pedigree, and yet at the same time positing a moral imaginary that ipso facto discredited any political power that laid a claim to them. While the mosque/ madrasah (colleges) became the site of Islamic scholasticism, the court emerged as the domain of literary humanism, which served and subverted it at one and the same time. The making of Persian literary humanism over the last 1,400 years was the product of a creative imagination institutionally embedded in an imperial worldview that politically facilitated and normatively engendered its worldly character. The most immediate memory of Iran after the Arab conquest of the mid-seventh century was that of the Sassanid empire (224– 651), which assumed wider and more fantastic proportions the more Iran as a self-conscious world plunge"
