        "text": "73 years ago, on 12 February 1951, two days before the most romantic day of the modern calendar, the Shah of Iran married Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari at the Golestan Palace in Tehran. Just seven years later, in 1958, the couple divorced and Soraya would inherit the epithet ‘the princess with the sad eyes’.\n\nThe story goes that the recently divorced prince, who was formerly married to Princess Fawzia of Egypt, had ‘fallen in love’ with a picture of the 18-year-old Soraya and hastily invited her to his palace to have dinner with the queen mother, Tadj ol-Molouk. Following the evening, Soraya’s father reportedly told her: ‘The Shah liked you very much. Are you ready to marry him?’ The next day, the couple were engaged, with the Shah proposing to Soraya with a 22.37 carat diamond engagement ring.\n\nSoraya’s German and Catholic upbringing made her the object of ‘much distrust’ in the country, with Muslim clerics saying the Shah should not marry this ‘half-European girl’ who was not raised a Muslim. Many years later Soraya would write: ‘I was a dunce. I knew next to nothing of the geography, the legends of my country; nothing of its history, nothing of the Muslim religion’.\n\nRead More\n\nWho was the Countess of Rosse, Princess Margaret’s glamorous mother-in-law?\n\nAnne Parsons, Countess of Rosse, who died 31 years ago this week, was mother to photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, who wooed Princess Margaret\n\nAfter the bride was taken ill by a bad case of typhoid fever, the wedding was postponed from 27 December 1950 to 12 February 1951, two years after their initial meeting. Although Soraya wasn’t entirely well by the second date, the decision was made that the wedding must go ahead. As legend goes, the Shah brought her a jewel every day during her battle with typhoid, placing his gifts on her pillow.\n\nThe nuptials took place at Golestan Palace. The bride wore a Christian Dior gown, made with 37 yards of silver lamé studded with pearls, 6,000 diamond pieces, and 20,000 marabou feathers. She matched the dress with a jacket and veil for the ceremony, with the creation reportedly weighing 20 kilograms. In fact, so heavy was the dress that midway through proceedings one of Soraya’s ladies-in-waiting took scissors to the train in an attempt to make it lighter.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, both jacket and veil were exchanged for an emerald and diamond parure and the crown jewels were added. Given it was mid February and the palace was unheated, by the evening the bride was given a mink cape to keep her warm and wool socks to hide beneath her dress.\n\nRead More\n\nBy invitation of the Maharaja of Jaipur: rent a royal suite in Jaipur’s city palace now\n\nFor over £6000-a-night you can live like a maharaja – with a private butler, of course – in Rajasthan’s Pink City\n\nSeven years later, after Queen Soraya had failed to provide the Shah with a male heir (doctors had informed her she would not be able to conceive ‘for many years’), the couple were forced to separate. In 1958, the Shah tearfully announced their divorce; Soraya said it was ‘a sacrifice of my own happiness’.\n\nA year later he married again, to Farah Diba, with whom he had four children, including two boys. Ironically, his heir turned out to be ‘unnecessary’. Following the political uprisings in 1978 and 1979, the Islamic Republic succeeded his regime. The Shah died a year later in July 1980.\n\nWith the title of HRH Princess Soraya of Iran and ample financial support, the princess lived out her life as a globetrotting socialite in Europe. She even had a brief stint as an actress, starring in the 1965 movie I tre volti (The Three Faces). She also appeared as a character named Soraya in the film She.\n\nDuring her final years, Soraya lived in Paris on 46 avenue Montaigne. She often attended parties hosted by the Duchess de La Rochefoucauld and enjoyed drinking at the bar of the Hotel Plaza Athénée, located opposite her apartment. She was often accompanied by other glittering society figures, including another Parisian socialite of the era, Lily Claire Sarran.\n\nDespite her gilded lifestyle, Soraya was unable to find genuine happiness: a romantic relationship with director Franco Indovina was cut short by his tragic death in a plane crash. When she found out that her former husband lay dying of cancer in the late seventies, she wrote to him, saying she still loved him and would like to see him. He wrote back, expressing his desire to see her too. By the time she reached him in Iran, he was already dead. The love story between them led to historian Abbas Milani describing the pair as true ‘star crossed lovers’."
