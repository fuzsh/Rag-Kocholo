Index of Surjects 555 FOREWORD \"If you steal from one author, it's plagiarism; if you steal from many, it's research.\" Wilson Mizner After eight years, later than anticipated, I present here the sequel and completion of my Introduction to tJie Old Testament. The unexpectedly warm reception and generous appraisal of that book had encouraged me to write an Introduction to the Apocrypha in the same style and for the same public; but after completing it, I could not resist the temptation to preface it with a history of the period in which the Apocrypha were written. The incredibly favorable reviews and astonishing wide circulation of the first volume produced in me a sense of duty — a most distressing feeling — urging the completion of the work. In addition to what seemed to me a royal command to undertake this considerable labor, I may adduce two other reasons as my excuse for inflicting on long-suffering readers another bulky tome. First of all, like other writers of manuals, I was convinced (O blissful illusion! ) that my book was needed, for no other book in existence pre- sented the same information quite as well! Otherwise no university instructor who does not expect academic promotion or other advantages from his book, would ever submit to the labor and mental agony involved in its preparation — unless he was utterly insane. When I began to teach a course on \"The Intertestamental Period\" at the Boston University School of Theology twenty-five years ago, I could find no textbook for my stu- dents except the five-volume antiquated English translation of Emil Schiirer's great Geschichte des Judischen Volkes, out of print in English and German; I had luckily purchased a copy of the last German edition, and thus prepared a lecture course! The second reason is merely the momentum derived from the fun of teaching that course through the years. If the students had not shown interest in the subject and given me every encouragement, I might merely have written an introduction to the Apocrypha. Here instead are two books in one: a summary of the history, religion, and literature of Judaism from 200 b.c. to a.d. 200 ( much briefer than Schiirer's ) ; and an introduc- tion to the Apocrypha (much more detailed than Schiirer's or any other known to me ) . Although New Testament problems and publications have xii FOREWORD remained outside the scope of the book, it may possibly help students understand the world in which Christianity arose, and thus supplement my friend Morton Scott Enslin's excellent Christian Beginnings (Harper, 1938). This book is \"research\" only as defined by Mizner above; the victims of my \"scholarly\" depredations have been duly mentioned, and are here thanked for invaluable help; notably so in the field of Hellenism. As I strayed into it with the best of motives, I hoped Cervantes was right when he said that heaven always favors good intentions (Siempre favorece el cielo los buenos deseos), although fully aware of their alleged use in paving hell. It is now my pleasant duty to express my appreciation to Miss Julie Eidesheim for her expert editorial work on the manuscripts of both my books; to my former students Ralph Lazzaro (instructor in the Harvard Divinity School) and Dr. Morton Smith, for reading the whole manuscript of this volume critically; another former student, Mr. Herbert Yarrish, read some chapters of it. My learned Harvard colleague and good friend, Professor Robert P. Blake, generously read the book in proof. My wife not only bore patiently the tedious clatter of my typewriter and my morose mood during the preparation of the book, but, besides encourag- ing me at all times, took upon herself the correction of the proofs and the preparation of the indices. In partial payment of the costs of publication, the Lucius N. Littauer Foundation, the Harvard Semitic Museum, and Mr. G. A. Pfeiffer have generously contributed funds. To them all, and particularly to Mr. Pfeiffer to whom the book is dedicated in appreciation of constant help and counsel, I express here my deep and lasting gratitude. January, 1949 R. H. P. PART I JUDAISM FROM 200 b.c. TO a.d. 200 A. PALESTINIAN JUDAISM CHAPTER I POLITICAL HISTORY The independence of the Judeans came to an end in 586 B.C., when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and deprived the Davidic dynasty of its throne. Except for the brief Maccabean interlude (141-63 B.C.), the Jews never again (until 1948) had a government of their own which was not subject to alien authority. Nevertheless, alone of all ancient nations, the Jews did not lose their nationality when they were deprived of land and state. A small country on the main line of communication between the valley of the Nile and the lands of the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, Palestine was destined to be the battleground of the great empires sur- rounding her: Egyptians, Hittites, Syrians, Assyrians, Babylonians fought for the possession of this buffer state, until it passed under the rule of the great empires of the Persians (538-332), of the Greeks (332-141), of the Romans ( 63 b.c.-a.d. 395 ) , of the Byzantines ( 395-636, except for the period 614-628 when Palestine was ruled by Chosroes II, the last great Sassanian king of Persia), of the Caliphs (636-1099). Following the ephemeral kingdom of the Crusaders (1099-1187), after various vicissi- tudes, Palestine was governed by the Ottoman Turks ( 1516-1917, except for the Egyptian rule in the years 1833-1840) and the British (since 1917; as a mandate of the League of Nations, from April 25, 1920, to May 15, 1948 ) . It was only when no great empire had the urge and the capacity to conquer Palestine that the country enjoyed a breathing spell under its own native rulers: this actually happened only before 1500 B.C., then while the Israelites and Judeans were in power (ca. 1150-586 B.C.), and finally under the Hasmoneans (141-63 B.C.). The significance of the Jews in history (aside from their contributions to culture) is primarily due to their unparalleled success in preserving a strong national feeling, based on literature and religion, after the loss of political independence. We may even say that after 586 b.c. the history of the Jews is primarily a process of trial and error aiming at national survival; at last about a.d. 200 all other means for the preservation of the nation were discarded in favor of Rabbinic Judaism. Military uprisings, apocalyptic dreams of a future triumph over the Gentiles, avoidance of mixed marriages, punctilious performance of the Temple rites, and other 5 6 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES remedies eventually proved less effective than the study and observance of the Law, as promoted in school and synagogue. The Jews survived primarily as \"the people of the Book\"; their history after a.d. 70 is pri- marily the history of their literature. Their self-preservation as a people depended on the preservation of their national religion, the practice of which included the observance of ancient customs which originally did not always have a direct connection with the worship: thus dietary laws, sabbath, and circumcision were ancient practices the original significance of which had been forgotten for centuries; but by remaining faithful to such customs inherited from tiieir ancestors the Jews incidentally separated themselves from the Gentiles and in turn were regarded with scorn or hostility by the other subjects of the Hellenistic and Roman rulers. Of external facts in the life of the Palestinian Jews from 586 to the events preceding the Maccabean rebellion ( 175 b.c. ) almost no informa- tion has survived, except what may be gleaned from Haggai, Zechariah 1-8, Nehemiah's Memoirs, and possibly — but not certainly — the Book of Ezra. From Haggai and Zechariah we learn that the Temple was rebuilt in 520-516; and also that some Jews, stirred by the widespread insur- rections raging when Darius (521-485) ascended the Persian throne, believed that the Lord was shaking the kingdoms in order to give to the Jews independence and dominion. So certain did this hope seem to a group of Jews, including apparently Haggai and Zechariah, that they proceeded to crown Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, as the Messianic king. But Darius conquered all his enemies and the Persian authorities in Jerusalem \"liquidated\" the unfortunate Zerubbabel at once, even though they granted to the Jews complete freedom in religious and cul- tural matters. This liberalism of the Persian rulers, nay, their special manifestations of favor toward the Jews,1 are conspicuous in Nehemiah's work ( 444 b.c. ) , when he revived the pitiful congregation in Jerusalem through restora- tion of its fortifications (apparently dismantled by a hostile neighboring people) and through social and spiritual reorganization. Modern historians and Jewish tradition begin a new epoch in the time of Nehemiah. But while Jewish tradition extols Ezra as the restorer of the Law that Moses had received from God, modern historians ( at least since the critical researches of A. Kuenen, W. H. Kosters, and C. C. Torrey) are apt to express doubts about Ezra's contribution and to place more emphasis on Nehemiah's activity. In any case, the Persian government 1 See B. Meissner, Die Achamenidenkonige und das Judentum ( Sitzungber. d. Preuss. Akad., Phil. -hist. Kl., 1938, pp. 6-26). A tragic illustration of Persian concern for the Jews may be detected at Elephantine in Upper Egypt, where a Jewish colony thrived during the Persian rule of Egypt but appears to have been extermi- nated when Egypt became independent in 404 B.C. POLITICAL HISTORY 7 (538-332 b.c), by protecting Judea from external aggression and internal tumults and by allowing the Jews full autonomy in their religious and cultural development, was ideally suited to further the transition from kingdom to nation, from state to holy congregation. The publication of the final edition of the Law of Moses (the Pentateuch) about 400 B.C. proved far more significant for the future than the rebuilding of the Temple (520-516), for eventually the Law brought into being the syna- gogue— the most vital and original institution of Judaism. The Pax Persiana not only furthered the growth and diffusion of early Judaism, ( as later the Pax Romana was to become a condition for the expansion of Christianity), but, as E. Meyer has observed, tended to transform local deities into cosmic gods, national cults into personal and universal reli- gions— a tendency which the Jews, in spite of their concern with the preservation of nationality and religion, could not evade; on the contrary, with Jeremiah and the Second Isaiah ( Is. 40-55 ) Judaism was disclosing at least in germ the characteristics of a personal and universal religion even before Cyrus conquered Babylonia in 538. Owing to historical circumstances, two apparently contradictory tend- encies appear in Judaism during the Persian period. On the one hand, the Second Isaiah proclaimed that Jehovah was the only God in existence, hence his worship should eventually become the sole religion of man- kind. On the other hand, however, the apocalypses proclaimed the future subjection of all nations to the Jews and the Law served to separate the Jews from the Gentiles. This contradiction appears in all religions which claim sole and absolute validity: of necessity they are utterly in- tolerant of other cults, but at the same time zealous in missionary work leading to the conversion of all men to the true religion. Such attitudes, unless clothed with great tact and circumspection, inevitably provoke animosity on the part of outsiders: the hostility of the Alexandrians and others against the Jews in the Hellenistic and Roman periods is in a sense the reaction to Jewish enthusiasm and conviction. In these remarks on the Palestinian Jews during the Persian period, the familiar traditional topics of the \"Exile,\" the \"Return,\" and the \"Restoration\" have been deliberately omitted, as also the work of Ezra. These notions we owe to the Chronicler, writing about the middle of the third century. They reflect his dogmas rather than his historical informa- tion, and they have prevailed so long simply because no historical sources have been available aside from Haggai, Zechariah, and Nehemiah. These writings, however, sufficiently prove that the actual course of events was far different from the idealized picture conceived by the Chronicler's vivid imagination. All that can be said is that an insignificant minority of the Judeans was exiled by Nebuchadnezzar, that even if Cyrus allowed the Babylonian Jews to return, extremely few were 8 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES sufficiently heroic to leave a prosperous country in which they were acquiring wealth to go to the far-from-fruitful ruined homeland around Jerusalem. Thus Judea remained destitute until after Nehemiah had come to reorganize and encourage the dejected congregation depicted in the Book of Malachi. 1. Hellenistic Domination (332-175 B.C.) With lightning speed Alexander of Macedon conquered the Persian Empire of Darius III. His decisive victories were at the Granicus River near Troy (334), at Issus (333), and at Gaugamela near Arbela (331); Tyre was captured after a siege of seven months and Gaza fell after two months in 332; in the same year Jerusalem surrendered to the Greeks without a struggle.2 So Alexander \"advanced to the ends of the earth, and took spoils from many peoples; and the earth was quiet before him\" (I Mace. 1:3; cf. Dan. 8:5-7). But the storm broke at the death of the young conqueror in 323. \"And when he [the he-goat] was strong, the great horn [Alexander] was broken; and in its place there came up four others [cf. LXX] [Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus I, and Ptolemy I] toward the four winds of heaven\" (Dan. 8:8; cf. 11:3 f. ). Alexander's empire was not divided into four parts immediately after his death, as one might assume from Daniel's vision. Ptolemy I Lagos (305-285 [d. 283] b.c. ) made himself king of Egypt and founded a dynasty which remained in power there until the Roman conquest in 30 b.c. Lysimachus was the master of Thrace, Antipater (soon followed by his son Cassander) ruled Macedon and Greece. Seleucus at first lost Babylonia, his portion of the empire, but he recovered it in 312. The lust for conquest of Antigonus, the ruler of Phrygia, brought about a coalition of the other Diadochi (or \"successors\" of Alexander) against him and, after a period of hostilities in which the fortunes of war fluctuated, Antigonus finally met his end at the decisive battle of Ipsus (Phrygia) in 301. Then was the empire divided between Lysimachus, Cassander, Seleucus, and Ptolemy. During this time (323-301) Palestine, like other buffer states located between contending kingdoms, passed in rapid succession from the possession of Ptolemy (who took it from Laomedon in 320) to that of Antigonus (315), and so forth. Ptolemy defeated Demetrius, son of Antigonus, at Gaza (312), but lost Palestine again a year later: the victory, however, allowed Seleucus to reconquer Babylonia and thus found the Seleucid kingdom. The year 312-311 fixes the Seleucid Era, 2 The dramatic story of Alexander's meeting with the high priest Jaddua ( Josephus, Antiquities 11:8, 4 f . [§§325-329]) is not a legend, but fiction pure and simple. POLITICAL HISTORY 9 according to which events are dated in I Maccabees (1:10; 7:1; 10:1; etc.) and in later histories. But after the battle of Ipsus, Ptolemy occupied Palestine and Phoenicia, which remained under the rule of the Ptolemies of Egypt for over a cen- tury— until Antiochus III the Great (223-187) conquered these lands for the Seleucids of Syria (Dan. 11:13-16) through his victories at Gaza (200) and Panium or Banias (198), where Caesarea Philippi was to be built. Jewish history under the Ptolemies is utterly obscure. The author of Dan. 11:6-12 (our best historical source, as explained by Porphyry and Jerome) knows of no events in this century other than matrimonial diffi- culties and mutual hostilities between Ptolemies and Seleucids. The Jews were apparently granted considerable autonomy and were allowed to develop their culture undisturbed, as long as they paid the taxes and remained submissive. The Jews, however, were chafing under foreign domination, despite their apparent obedience to their Ptolemaic rulers: we are told that they welcomed Antiochus III in 198, giving him all possible aid. They imagined to have gained something through the change, but this illusion was short-lived. Disastrously defeated by Lucius Cornelius Scipio at Magnesia in 190 B.C. (Dan. 11:18), Antiochus was forced to pay Rome an enormous indemnity, and died ( 187 ) while plundering a temple in Elymais ( Dan. 11:19). His son Seleucus IV (187-175) sent forth an exactor (Dan. 11:20), Heliodorus, to raise funds due to Rome (cf. II Mace. 3), but Seleucus IV was eventually assassinated by him (Dan. 11:20); his brother Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164) succeeded him. The new king, by adding to the fiscal burdens ( weighing heavily on the Jews since the battle of Magnesia) forcible Hellenization and proscription of Judaism, precipitated the Maccabean revolt (Dan. 11:21-45). 2. The Maccabean Rebellion (175-142) In a keen analysis of the historical sources, Elias Bickermann (Der Gott der Makkabder, pp. 17-35. Berlin, 1937) has discovered four con- flicting explanations of the Maccabean rebellion, dictated by bias or circulated as propaganda. 1. Pagan Theories, a. The Seleucid theory justified the oppressive measures of Antiochus Epiphanes through a previous rebellion of the Jews, who had sided with the Ptolemies against Antiochus during his Egyptian campaign of 168. This version transfers the plundering of the Temple in 169 to 168, when Jerusalem was attacked and Judaism pro- scribed. Thus the sacrilegious robbing of a temple was justified in the eyes of the Greeks and Romans. This version was presented presumably 10 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES in lost parts of Polybius, in allusions by Tacitus, and in sections of II Maccabees and Josephus. b. The Anti-Semitic theory is an interpretation of the preceding one and is found in Diodorus 34:1 and Tacitus, Histories V, 8; it is attacked by Josephus (Against Apion 11:7 [§§90-97]). According to this version, Antiochus led a crusade against Jewish barbarism as the champion of Hellenic culture. 2. Jewish Theories, a. In opposition to the official Seleucid explana- tion, Daniel, II Mace. 1:7, and in a measure II Maccabees in general, regard Antiochus as insignificant (being merely, in Isaiah's words, \"the rod of God's anger\") and attribute the misfortunes of the Jews to a divine judgment against them: not Antiochus, but the Lord punishes the Jews (cf. II Mace. 5:17 f.). b. In contrast to the anti-Semitic theory, I Maccabees (which was written to glorify the Maccabees) regards the persecution of the Jews as an outburst of abominable pagan fury abetted by apostate Jews: \"And there came out of them a wicked root, Antiochus Epiphanes . . . there went out of Israel wicked men ...\" (I Mace. l:10f. ). The world is rent asunder into God's people and the heathen; the gulf between them is impassable. Israel, the innocent victim of pagan attack, is certain that God will destroy its foes (I Mace. 4:8-11). These four theories, as Bickermann shows (op. cit., pp. 36-49), have been variously advanced by theologians and historians through the cen- turies, down to our own time. On the basis of our sources, we may attempt to summarize the course of events impartially (if possible) as follows : While in 180 Seleucus IV had failed to obtain large sums from the Jews through Heliodorus' ill-fated attempt to plunder the private funds deposited in the Temple (assuming a kernel of truth in II Mace. 3),3 Antiochus IV Epiphanes4 found it more profitable to sell the office of high priest to the highest bidder. Soon after his accession, Antiochus deposed the high priest Onias and appointed in his place his brother Joshua (who took the Greek name of Jason). Onias had faced the opposition of the Tobiads, strong supporters of the Seleucids and of the Hellenization of the Jews. Onias offended his friends, the opponents of the Tobiads, by going to Antioch for help, thus making it easy for Jason, the most ardent of the Hellenizers, to supplant him. Jason collaborated with Antiochus not only in raising funds but also in furthering Greek 3 See E. Bickermann, \"Heliodore au temple de Jerusalem\" (Annuaire de Vlnstitut de Philologie et d'Histoire orientates et slaves VII [1939-44] 5-40). 4\"[77ieds] epiphanes\" means \"[the god] who manifests [or reveals] himself.\" Polybius (XXVI, 10; quoted by Athenaeus X, p. 439) reports the sarcastic pun \"epimanes\" (madman). POLITICAL HISTORY 11 customs among the Jews, in accordance with the king's policy to intro- duce a uniform Greek culture throughout his realm (I Mace. 1:41-43). For Jason not only paid to Antiochus 440 talents of silver for the office of high priest, but he also promised 150 more if he were allowed to build a gymnasium and an ephebeum (II Mace. 4:8 f. ).5 Having been granted these requests, Jason proceeded to build a gymnasium under the citadel and induced young noblemen to wear the petasus (the broad-brimmed Greek hat); young priests forsook the altar to compete in discus throwing (II Mace. 4:10-15; cf. I Mace. 1:13 f.). Some young Jews even submitted to surgery to disguise their circum- cision while exercising nude in the palaestra (I Mace. 1:15). Thus East and West met in Jerusalem, but could not be combined. For such Greek innovations as athletic exercise, sport, bathing for hygienic purposes, nudity in the presence of others, wearing hats with a rim were pro- foundly repellent in the Semitic world, particularly to the Jews, whose customs, hallowed by the observance of centuries and traced back to divine revelation, seemed irreconcilable with such Greek practices.0 The conservative Jews, horrified by what they considered a repudiation of the divine covenant and a union with the heathen (I Mace. 1:15; cf. II Mace. 4:11), banded themselves together under the name of Hasidim (Pious; Asidaioi in Greek), regarding the Hellenizers as wicked apostates; in all probability out of this movement eventually arose the Pharisees. After three years in office (175-172 or 174-171), Jason was deposed and fled into Trans jordania: a certain Menelaus (Menahem) outbid him in Antioch by three hundred talents of silver (II Mace. 4:23-26). He is said (loc. cit.) to have been the brother of Simon, a high Temple official (II Mace. 3:4 ),7 and was obviously the leader of the Tobiads, although not necessarily related to them by blood. Menelaus found it difficult to raise the enormous sum he had promised, even though he had few scruples about appropriating Temple vessels and selling others to 5 It is generally assumed that the last words of II Mace. 4:9 mean that Jason also petitioned for the Jews of Jerusalem the title of \"Antiochenes,\" or citizen of Antioch, the capital of the kingdom. Another explanation is that Jerusalem should be named \"Antioch.\" E. Bickermann (Gott der Makkabaer, pp. 59-65), however, argues that these interpretations are not correct: the text means \"to register the Antiochenes in Jerusalem,\" i.e., to organize them into a politeuma or demos (a corporation with certain civic rights), not merely a club or an association. 6 When Jason sent a gift of three hundred drachmas to Tyre on the occasion of the quinquennial games in honor of Heracles, the envoys refused to have the money used for the sacrifices and had it assigned to outfitting the navy (II Mace. 4:18-20). 7 Simon ( and consequently Menelaus ) was a Benjamite according to the Greek text of II Mace. 3:4, but a member of the Bilgah (Neh. 12:5) priestly family according to the Latin text. On the other hand, \"Benjamin\" may be a corruption of \"Miniamin,\" an order of priests (cf. G. F. Moore, Judaism, Vol. 1, pp. 52-58). F. M.

But there is reason to doubt that, according to II Mace. 4:33-38, he induced Andronicus to assassinate the former high priest Onias III, who in the illusory security of Apollo's temple at Daphne was thundering against the spoliation of the Temple. In spite of all opposition and of his financial difficulties, Menelaus was becoming more and more a persona grata to Epiphanes (even if not all of II Mace. 4:39-50 is historical). In the late summer or fall of 169, Menelaus even allowed Antiochus, returning from his first Egyptian campaign, to plunder the Temple of all treasures, even stripping gold plating from the facade (I Mace. 1:20-24; Dan. 11:25-28; cf. II Mace. 5:15 f., where the sacrilege is dated erroneously one year later). The value of the booty is said to have been 1,800 talents of silver (II Mace. 5:21). A year later (168) Antiochus was achieving military success in his second campaign against Egypt when the Roman legate, Popilius Laenas, handed him an ultimatum from the Roman Senate and forced him to withdraw his troops at once (Polybius XXIX, 11; cf. Dan. 11:29 f. ). The bad temper of Antiochus was not improved by reports that Jerusalem was seething with tumults (II Mace. 5:11). What actually happened is not entirely clear, but the account in II Mace. 5:5-8, which is our sole source of information, is probably based on fact. The Jews were divided into two parties: the great majority, opposed to Hellenization and to Antiochus, was pro-Egyptian at heart; the Tobiads and their supporters, under the leadership of Menelaus, were loyal to Antiochus and con- sequently anti-Egyptian. Under these circumstances it was not difficult for Jason, when Jerusalem was stirred by the false rumor that Antiochus was dead, to seize the city with a force of only one thousand men. He presented himself, we may surmise, as the leader of the Oniads and forced the Tobiads to seek refuge in the citadel. But Jason soon threw off the mask and revealed himself as animated by self-seeking ambition rather than by a constructive national program: he soon began to, slaughter without mercy the very citizens who were opposed to Menelaus ( presumably because they detested Jason's ardor for Hellenism ) . Finally, driven out friendless, he wandered about for a time and died among the Spartans. Whether Antiochus was right or wrong in regarding these dis- orders as open rebellion against his rule, it is generally admitted that the commotion arose from party politics more than from the conflict between Judaism and Hellenism. The king sent Apollonius the \"mysarch\" (Mysian commander) to Jerusalem with an army of 22,000 men (II Mace. 5:24).8 After slaying 8 The name \"Apollonius\" is not given in I Mace. 1:29, where through an error \"collector of tribute\" is given instead of \"mysarch\" (J. Wellhausen, Nachricht. d. Gesellsch. d. Wi&sensch. zu Gdttingen 1905, p. 161). POLITICAL HISTORY 13 treacherously many of its inhabitants (5:25 f.; I Mace. 1-30), he de- molished the city walls and many houses (I Mace. 1:31), and south of the Temple, on the eastern hill,9 he built the Acra (1:33) which was not only, according to the meaning of the word, a fortified citadel or acropolis occupied by a body of troops, but a miniature city (\"polis\") inhabited by pagan Syrians (I Mace. 3:45; 14:36) and pro-Syrian Jews — a group called \"a sinful nation, wicked men\" (1:34; cf. 6:21-24). These \"sons of the Acra\" (4:2) remained a thorn in the flesh of the pious Jews (1:36), a humiliating symbol of alien domination, for almost thirty years (until 142-141). Soon after (or in 167, a year later, according to E. Bickermann), Epiphanes, realizing that ultimately the Jewish opposition to him was rooted in religion, decided to proscribe Judaism. As the Samaritan temple was dedicated to Zeus Xenios, so the Temple in Jerusalem became a sanctuary of the Olympian Zeus (II Mace. 6:1 f). \"The abomination of desolation\" (Dan. 9:27; 11:31; 12:11; I Mace. 1:54) is a sarcastic dis- tortion of the Semitic name (\"the Baal of Heaven\") of the Olympian Zeus and indicates a small Greek altar in his honor erected over the large altar of sacrifices. Swine were offered thereon in December, 168. The high priest Menelaus and his subordinate clergy ceased to officiate in the Temple: the Jewish cultus had come to an end. At the same time all religious observances ordained in the Law of Moses were forbidden in Palestine (but not elsewhere in the Seleucid kingdom) under penalty of death, notably circumcision, Sabbath rest, celebration of the festivals. The mere possession of a scroll of the Law was a capital offense, for the edict ordered the destruction of every copy of the Pentateuch. Conversely, the worship of heathen gods became compulsory, and altars for this purpose were erected all over the land.10 The reaction of the Jews to these detestable measures and to the resulting religious persecution — perhaps the first in history — was three- fold. Some, either through inclination or through fear, forsook the religion of their fathers and complied with the royal edict (I Mace. 1:43, 52). The Hasidim, or Pious (Asidaioi in I Mace. 7:13; II Mace. 14:6), on the contrary, offered passive resistance to the new law and, either secretly in the towns or openly in the wilderness, continued to obey the Mosaic statutes, preferring to die rather than violate even the least of the dietary commandments (I Mace. 1:62 f. ). Their motto is well ex- pressed in the Book of Daniel ( 3 : 17 f . ) , which a Hasid composed to 9 On the location of the Acra see E. Schurer, Geschichte, Vol. 1, p. 198, n. 37; also the map Plate XVII, C in The Westminster Historical Atlas of the Bible edited by G. E. Wright and F. V. Filson (Philadelphia, 1945). 10 For all these measures see especially I Mace. 1:41-64 and II Mace. 6:1-11; and also Dan. 7:25; 8:11 f.; 9:27; 11:31-33; 12:11; Josephus, Antiquities 12:5, 4 (§§251-254). 14 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES encourage loyalty to the Lord at any cost during th ; persecution: whether their God would deliver them from the king's hand or not, they would not serve his gods. Some of the Hasidim died valiantly as martyrs for their faith (I Mace. 1:60 f.; 2:29-38; Dan. ll:32b-33, 35) and thus became the heroes of the earliest Golden Legend (in II Mace. 6:10-7:42; cf. IV Mace). Finally, a third group, chiefly rural, under the leadership of Judas Maccabeus decided to defy openly the royal edict and to fight for their faith.11 In the mountain village of Modin (now el-Medije), between Jerusalem and the sea, lived \"Mattathias, the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem . . . And he had five sons\": John, Simon, Judas Maccabeus, Eleazar, and Jonathan (I Mace. 2:1-5). When a royal officer came to Modin to enforce the decree ordaining pagan sacrifices for the Jews, Mattathias in his zeal killed a Jew who was ready to perform the ceremony as also the officer, and fled forthwith to the mountains with his sons leaving all his property (2:15-28). Thus began the Maccabean rebellion which, after the death of Mattathias in 167-166 (2:69 f. ), was led by his son Judas Maccabeus. After the king's troops had massacred about a thousand Hasidim on the Sabbath (2:29-38), Mattathias and the Hasidim decided to fight for their lives on the Sabbath; they went through the country attacking apostate Jews and pagans, pulling down altars, circumcising infants, and generally upholding the observance of the Law of Moses (2:39-48). The Syrian authorities underestimated the valor of Judas, who \"was like a lion in his deeds, like a lion's whelp roaring for his prey\" (3:4), and the difficulties of the mountainous terrain, ideally suited to the guerrilla warfare in which Judas excelled. So the Maccabees were success- ful in defeating the Syrians under Apollonius, whose sword Judas carried henceforth (3:10-12), and in driving back Seron at the pass of Bethhoron (3:13-24). While in 166-165 Antiochus Epiphanes was engaged in a campaign against the Parthians (3:31, 37), Lysias as his regent in Syria (3:32-36) sent Ptolemy, Nicanor, and Gorgias, at the head of a consider- able army, against Judas (3:38-41). After religious and military prepara- tions for a battle which seemed hopeless, Judas met the enemy at Emmaus (3:42-60). While Gorgias was marching against the Jewish 11 In principle there was an irreconcilable difference between the Hasidim, relying on divine help, and the Maccabees, relying on military and diplomatic measures. Consequently the Hasidim at first mistrusted Judas and his \"little help\" (Dan. 11:34a), observing that he welcomed to his ranks men whose valor excelled their faith and morals. But eventually, during the emergency, the Hasidim gave their support to Judas (I Mace. 2:42-44; cf. 7:12 f.; II Mace. 14:6) and even consented to fight in self-defense on the Sabbath (I Mace. 2:40 f. ): thus, as the Book of Enoch (90:6-9) says symbolically, horns grew on the little lambs. But after 164 the Hasidim and the Maccabees disagreed more and more. POLITICAL HISTORY 15 position with a strong body of troops, Judas suddenly attacked the enemy camp at Emmaus; Gorgias, upon his return, seeing the camp in flames and Judas ready for battle, fled into Philistia (4:1-25). A year later, in the fall of 165, Lysias intervened in person. He circled Judea and camped at Beth-zur (Bethsura), south of Jerusalem (I Mace. 4:26-29). Divergent conclusions in regard to the ensuing events have been reached by historians, unable to reconcile the conflicting reports of I and II Maccabees. The following account seems the most probable to the present writer. Whether Lysias and Judas fought an inconclusive battle (nay, whether a decisive victory was won by Judas, according to I Mace. 4:34 f.) or not, Lysias entered negotiations with Judas and, possibly through the friendly intervention of a passing Roman embassy, a peace treaty abrogating the proscription of Judaism was signed with the approval of Antiochus Epiphanes (II Mace. 11). So Judas and his men went up to Jerusalem and cleansed the Temple, where for three years sacrifices had been offered to the Olympian Zeus: the worship of Jehovah was inaugurated anew, according to I Mace. 4:52, on the 25th of Chislev (December) of 165 — on the very day in which it had been profaned three years before (4:54). The day was celebrated annually ever since as the Hanukkah ( Rededication ) Feast (4:59; II Mace. 1:9; 10:1-8; Ps. 30, superscription; John 10:22). Josephus (Antiquities 12:7, 7 [§325]) says that it is called \"Lights\" (phota); the illumination of the houses during eight days is indeed characteristic of its celebration.12 The achievement of religious liberty should have marked the end of the hostilities begun for this purpose, particularly since Antiochus Epiphanes died in 164. It appears, in reality, that the Hasidim became again pacifists. But the Maccabees, as J. Wellhausen says, \"did not turn immediately from wolves into lambs.\" They soon had occasion to wage war again because of pogroms in regions where the Jews were a small minority :because the Acra continued to dominate Jerusalem, and because Judea was still subject to the Seleucids. The Book of Daniel reflects only the struggle for religious freedom before 164, the Book of Judith both that and the war for political independence ended in 141, and finally the Book of Esther the campaigns for vengeance against the enemies of the Jews following 141. After fortifying the Temple hill in Jerusalem and Beth-zur at the southern border of Judea (I Mace. 4:60 f. ), Judas fought successfully 12 H.

University of Pennsylvania Press, 1946. 16 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES against neighboring peoples, the Idumeans, the \"Children of Baean\" (unknown), and the Ammonites (5:1-8). The Gentiles in Gilead (Trans- jordania) and Galilee countered by persecuting the Jews in their midst, until Simon attacked them in Galilee and Judas in Gilead. The Jews in both regions were brought to Judea for safety (5:9-54). At the same time, however, Joseph and Azarias, who had been left in command in Jerusalem, were defeated by Gorgias when they attempted to attack Jamnia (5:55-64). During a second campaign against the Edomites, Judas took Hebron and, in Philistia, destroyed the temples of Ashdod (Azotus; 5:65-68). When young Antiochus V Eupator became king under the tutelage of Lysias at the death of Antiochus Epiphanes in 164-163 (6:1-17; cf. the legends in II Mace. 1:13-16 and ch. 9), Judas rashly decided to besiege the Acra in Jerusalem (6:18-27). But Lysias and the young king defeated Judas at Beth-Zacharias (south of Bethlehem), captured Beth- zur, lifted the siege of the Acra, forced Judas to accept terms of peace, and razed the fortifications around the Temple (6:28-63). The freedom of religion was confirmed again, and Menelaus was removed from the high priesthood and executed. In 162-161 Demetrius I Soter, the son of Seleucus IV and therefore the cousin of Antiochus V, escaped from Rome, and became king after ordering the assassination of Lysias and Antiochus V (7:1-4). Alcimus ( in Hebrew Jakim, abbreviated from Eliakim ) led a delegation of Hellen- izing Jews to Demetrius, was appointed high priest, and was installed by Bacchides with the approval of the scribes and the Hasidim — for Alcimus was of the seed of Aaron. Although Judas and his band had been forced to leave Jerusalem, Alcimus foolishly killed sixty Hasidim who had formerly supported the Maccabees; consequently he lost all support in Jerusalem and had to appeal to Demetrius for help (7:5-25). The king sent Nicanor at the head of the army, but he was defeated by Judas and was slain at the battle of Adasa, near Beth-horon, on the 13th of Adar (7:26-50; cf. II Mace. 14-15) — an event celebrated annually (7:49) on the day before Purim (II Mace. 15:36; Esth. 9:20-32). For a time Judas was again at the head of his nation and he may have attempted to strengthen his position through negotiations with Rome (even though the dossier in I Mace. 8 can hardly be authentic). But when Demetrius sent a powerful army under the command of Bacchides, Judas could not prevail and fell fighting valiantly at Elasa in 161 (9:1-22). The Hellenizing party led by Alcimus was again in control (9:23-27), but the Maccabees chose Judas's brother Jonathan as their military leader (9:28-31). For the moment, however, they could merely live as free- booters in the wilderness of Tekoa (9:32-34), as David had in his outlaw days: whenever robbed, they raided in revenge (9:35-42). Bacchides was unable to cope with Jewish guerrilla bands (9:43-49), but he forti- POLITICAL HISTORY 17 fied a number of garrison towns in Judea and took hostages (9:50-53). Alcimus tore down the wall in the Temple courts separating Jews and Gentiles, but died soon after; and Bacchides returned to Antioch (9:54-57). At the request of the Hellenizers, Bacchides returned two years later (in 158), but could accomplish nothing against Jonathan; so he made peace with him and never came back (9:58-72). Thus during the following five years ( 158-153 ) Jonathan was left undisturbed in Michmash and consolidated his power (9:73). Except for a few aristo- crats, the Jewish nation was generally opposed to Hellenization and accepted more and more the leadership of the Hasmoneans who succeeded Judas. At the same time the Seleucids, through their dynastic quarrels, not only became less and less able to lend support to unpopular Helleniz- ing high priests, but were forced to make concessions to the Hasmoneans in order to obtain their help. An Ephesian youth of low birth, Balas, pretended to be the son of Antiochus Epiphanes. Aided by the enemies of Demetrius I (Attalus II king of Pergamum, Ptolemy VI Philometor of Egypt, Ariarathes V of Cappadocia), officially recognized by the Roman Senate, and supported by the Syrians opposed to Demetrius, Balas took the name of Alexander and in 153 began his fight for the Syrian throne. In this emergency Demetrius granted Jonathan the power to raise troops and free the hostages, withdrew the Syrian garrisons in Judea except those at Beth-zur and in the Acra, and allowed Jonathan to fortify Jerusalem (10:1-14). But Balas Alexander offered far greater concessions to Jonathan for his help: he appointed him high priest and sent him a purple robe and a golden crown. So Jonathan, clad in the sacred vestments, officiated at the Feast of Tabernacles in 153 (10:15-21) and wisely rejected all the other alluring promises of Demetrius I (10:22-47), who died fighting in 150 (10:48-50). In the same year Jonathan was greatly honored: when Balas married Cleopatra, the daughter of Ptolemy VI, he was appointed strategos and meridarches (military and civil governor) of Judea (10:51-66). Jonathan remained loyal to his benefactor even after a legitimate claimant to the throne, Demetrius II Nicator (son of Demetrius I), appeared in 147. When Apollonius, the governor of Coele-Syria, passed over to Demetrius and challenged Jonathan, the latter was victorious at Joppa and Ashdod (where the temple of Dagon was destroyed), and received from Balas the city of Ekron as his reward (10:67-89). But when Ptolemy VI turned against his son-in-law Balas and took away from him his daughter Cleopatra, giving her to Demetrius II in marriage, Jon- athan's help could not save Balas, and he was assassinated in 145 (11:1-19). Jonathan, however, felt strong enough to besiege the Acra and to demand of Demetrius, as the price of lifting the siege, three districts of 18 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES Samaria and complete freedom from taxation, except for a payment of 300 talents (11:20-37). Such concessions, soon to be increased, indicate how low had sunk the power of the Seleucids — and how cleverly Jonathan took advantage of their plight. A former general of Balas, Tryphon, brought Antiochus VI (son of Balas) from Arabia, to rule in place of Demetrius II (11:38-40). When a rebellion broke out in Antioch against Demetrius, he was saved from death by three thousand Jewish soldiers sent to his help by Jonathan (11:41-51). •' In 144, when Demetrius failed to keep his promises to Jonathan (11:52 f. ) and was sorely pressed by Tryphon (11:54-56), Jonathan gave his support to Antiochus VI and Tryphon (11:57-59) and proceeded to subject Philistia to them (11:60-62). He defeated an army of Demetrius at Hazor in Galilee ( 11:63 f., 67-74a) while his brother Simon forced the capitulation of Beth-zur ( 11:65 f.).13 When the forces of Demetrius rallied at Hamath on the Orontes, Jonathan scattered them again (12:24-30). On his way back he punished the Zabadean Arabs in the Lebanon (12:31) and passed through Damascus (12:32). Simon had taken Ashkelon and occupied Joppa ( 12:33 f. ). Then Jonathan set about fortifying Jerusalem and other towns of Judea (12:35-38). Jonathan and Tryphon did not trust each other, for each sought only his own advantage in their alliance against Demetrius. When Tryphon came to Scythopolis (Beth-shean) in 143, Jonathan met him with a strong army; but overcome by flattery and false promises, Jonathan came to Ptolemais and was cast into a dungeon (12:39-53). Simon, who was strategos (military governor) of the coastal districts from the Ladder of Tyre to the Egyptian border (11:59), hurried to Jerusalem and was elected leader in place of his brother Jonathan (13:1-11). Simon sent money and hostages to Tryphon for the liberation of Jonathan, even though he had reason to mistrust Tryphon (13:12-19). Actually Tryphon, far from keeping his word, tried to invade Judea, had Jonathan killed in Bascama (13:20), and — after assassinating Antiochus VI — made himself king ( 13:31 f. ). Simon, while continuing the fortifica- tions begun by Jonathan, obtained concessions from Demetrius II, and conquered Gazara, the ancient Gezer,14 making his son John Hyrcanus 13 According to I Mace. ll:74b-12:23, Jonathan interrupted this campaign to go to Jerusalem and send friendly embassies to Rome and Sparta. The dossier in ch. 12 is no less suspect to some scholars than the one in ch. 8. On Beth-zur see: O. R. Sellers and W. F. Albright in BASOR No. 43 (October 1931), pp. 12-13; O. R. Sellers, The Citadel of Beth-zur. Philadelphia, 1933. 14 The excavations on the site have disclosed a curious sidelight of Simon's occupa- tion of Gezer. One of the Gentiles in the city, obviously forced by Simon to work at the construction of a government palace, inscribed an imprecation on a stone that he placed into the wall. The inscription, written carelessly in Greek, reads as follows: \"(Says) Pampras, 'May fire (?) follow up Simon's palace.'\" See: R. A. Stewart Macalister, The Excavations of Gezer, Vol. I, pp. 211 f. London, 1912. POLITICAL HISTORY 19 governor thereof (13:53; cf. 16:1, 19, 21). Finally, by forcing the capitulation of the Acra in Jerusalem on the 23rd of Iyyar (May), 142 (an annual celebration for two or three centuries), Simon made the Jews independent from the Seleucids (13:33-52): thus \"was the yoke of the heathen taken away from Israel\" (13:41). 3. The Rule of the Hasmoneans (142-63) The chief merits of Simon (according to 14:4 f., and the ode in his honor in 14:6-15) were the securing of Joppa as a Jewish harbor and the conquest of Gazara, Beth-zur, and the Acra: thus he made Israel prosperous, pious, and strong. In September, 141, a grateful nation con- ferred upon Simon and his descendants the legitimate and permanent authority as ruling high priests ( 14:25-49) :15 thus the rule of the Has- monean dynasty received national recognition. As the first independent ruler of his family, Simon was probably the first to establish an era according to which documents were dated (13:42) — possibly the era of Jerusalem as an independent city rather than of Simon's first year of rule — indeed the first to be recognized by the Roman Senate as a friendly independent ruler (14:16-19, 24; 15: 15-24 ).16 When in 138 Demetrius II, after long wars with the Parthian king Mithridates I, was taken prisoner, his brother Antiochus VII Sidetes wrote from Rhodes confirming the authority of Simon (15:1-9) and besieged Tryphon in Dor, Phoenicia (15:10-14, 37). Certain of his final victory over Tryphon, Sidetes, however, refused Simon's help and ordered him to return the conquered cities of Joppa and Gazara, as also the Acra in Jerusalem, or pay for them an indemnity of 1,000 talents of silver (15:25-31). Simon offered only 100 talents (15:32-36). So Cendebeus was sent against the Jews, but Judas and John, the sons of Simon, defeated him, and the attack was not renewed in Simon's lifetime (15:38-16:10). Like his brothers, Simon died a violent death: his son-in- law Ptolemy, governor of Jericho, assassinated him together with his two sons Mattathias and Judas in 135 (16:11-17). But John Hyrcanus, who was in Gazara, was warned in time and became high priest in the place of his father (16:18). John Hyrcanus ( 135-104 )17 began his rule inauspiciously, but succeeded in ending it with the Jewish state at the height of its power. He failed 15 Psalm 110, which in Hebrew has the acrostic \"Simeon\" and contains the divine oracle, \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\" (the Hasmoneans were not sons of Aaron), may have been composed for this occasion. 10 O. R. Sellers and W. F. Albright (BASOR No. 43, p. 13) have concluded from the excavations at Beth-zur that Simon did not coin money, despite I Mace. 15:6. H. Willrich (ZAW N.F. 10 [1933] 78 f.) agrees with this conclusion. 17 Our principal sources of information for Hyrcanus ( since his history, named in I Mace. 16:23 f., has not survived) are Josephus, Antiquities 13:8-10 and War 1:2. 20 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES to punish Ptolemy because the latter was holding his mother as a hostage. Worse still, in the year 130 (or, less probably, 134) Antiochus VII Sidetes, who had been defied by Simon, attacked Hyrcanus in person, devastated Judea, besieged Hyrcanus in Jerusalem, and forced his capitu- lation and the payment of a considerable indemnity. Soon afterward Hyrcanus was forced to accompany Sidetes in his campaign against the Parthians. But the king's death in 129, when he threw himself from a cliff to escape captivity, was fortunate for the Jews. Then ended, however, the rule of the Seleucids east of the Euphrates. The unpopular weakling Demetrius II, who had been freed by the Parthians, now ruled in place of his able brother, Antiochus VII. Stupidly Demetrius began to war against Ptolemy VII Physcon, and the latter, according to accepted tactics, set up against him a fraudulent pretender who, like Balas, called himself Alexander, but in Syria was known as Zabinas (meaning \"bought and paid for\"). Demetrius was defeated and was assassinated on the point of landing at Tyre (125). His son Antiochus VIII Grypus (125-113, 111-96), however, succeeded in ridding himself of Zabinas (122), but was driven away in 113 by his cousin Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, son of Sidetes (113-111, 111-95). Even when Grypus occupied most of Syria in 111, Cyzicenus remained the master of Coele-Syria until his death in 95. Such dynastic dissensions were most advantageous to Hyrcanus, who became again an independent ruler at the death of Antiochus VII Sidetes (129) and, as Josephus (Antiquities 13:10, 1) says, contributed nothing to later Seleucid kings either as a subject or as a friend. Like his pred- ecessors, he negotiated with the deceitful pretender (Zabinas) rather than with the real Seleucids. In any case, Hyrcanus knew how to take advantage of the plight of that dynasty to enlarge the borders of his limited province. The Hasmoneans had progressed from the attainment of religious freedom to the elimination of the high priestly aristocracy, to political independence, and, after some attempts by Jonathan and Simon with limited results, to conquest under Hyrcanus. With the manifest intention of restoring to the Jews the kingdom of David in its whole extent, John Hyrcanus fought successfully in the east, north, and south. After conquering Medaba and Samaga in Trans- jordania, he captured Shechem and the Samaritan temple on Gerizim, sub- jugating the Samaritan sect. The Idumeans were subjected and forced to adopt Judaism. The attack on Samaria, which was a Greek city, caused him more trouble, but after a siege of one year he razed it to the ground (fulfilling the prophecy in Mic. 1:6), in spite of the opposition of Antiochus IX Cyzicenus (whose intervention seems to have been frus- trated by the Romans). At the same time he gained possession of Scythopolis ( Beth-shean ) . POLITICAL HISTORY 21 Hyrcanus was followed at his death by his son Aristobulus ( 104-103 ).18 According to Josephus, the new ruler imprisoned his brothers (with the exception of Antigonus ) and his mother.19 The lady he let starve to death in prison; his brother Antigonus, whom he dearly loved, he slew when, through a diabolical plot, he came into his presence fully armed. He is said to have died brokenhearted over this unjust execution. Notwith- standing these family tragedies ( if they be historical ) , he is said to have been an able ruler. He was the first of his line to adopt the royal title, although his coins are inscribed in Hebrew, \"Judah the high priest, and the chebar ( = senate or congregation) of the Jews.\" Aristobulus (or his father) must have secured a foothold in Galilee and begun to Judaize it, for he forcibly circumcised the Itureans in the Lebanon. At his death, Salome Alexandra, his widow, freed the brothers from prison and married the oldest, Janneus (Hebrew, Jonathan) Alexander ( 103-76 ) , who was then twenty-four years of age ( thirteen years younger than she was ) .20 Psalm 2, having the Hebrew acrostic \"For Janneus A. and his wife,\" was probably sung at the wedding and coronation ceremonies; if so, it correctly anticipated the main aim of Janneus — to break the heathen with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel (Ps. 2:9) in order to restore David's kingdom to its full extent. He began his campaigns with an attack against Ptolemais (ancient Akko) on the coast. The inhabitants appealed for help to Ptolemy Lathyrus, who was in control of Cyprus after his mother, Cleopatra III, had driven him out of Egypt. Defeated by Lathyrus in 100, Janneus was saved from complete disaster by the forces of Cleopatra, although this queen was at first inclined to retain control of Palestine. Far from discouraged, Janneus began operations east of the Jordan, where he conquered Gadara and Amathus; continued them in Philistia, where he took Raphia and Anthedon; and destroyed Gaza after a year's siege (96). About a year later Janneus returned to Transjordania, but he came into contact with the powerful kingdom of the Nabateans in Edom (the capital was Petra). The Nabatean king, Obadas, objected to Jewish interference in the lands of Moab and Ammon, which he regarded as his own sphere of influence; he completely destroyed the army of Janneus in a ravine (94). The bitter resentment in Jerusalem against the bellicose high priest, 18 Chief sources of information on Aristobulus: Josephus, Antiquities 13:11; War, 1:3. 19 J. Wellhausen surmises, not without reason, that they were his stepbrothers and stepmother. 20 Our chief sources for Janneus are Josephus, Antiquities 13:12-15; War 1:4. 22 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES whose passion was besieging cities,21 broke out in a violent rebellion when Janneus returned to his capital without his army. It is not certain that the Pharisees, usually pacifists, were now the instigators of violence: in any case the rebels hired Demetrius III Eucerus ( son of Grypus ) and defeated Janneus in a decisive battle (88). A patriotic reaction, at the sight of the Jewish king wandering as a fugitive in the mountains, turned the tables after Demetrius departed: six thousand Jews went over to Janneus and he was able to regain his throne and wreak bloody vengeance on his enemies. Hostility from without began anew after the crushing of internal opposition. In 86 Antiochus XII Dionysus (son of Grypus) wished to cross Judea in order to attack the Nabatean king Aretas in his own country. Janneus, instead of helping him defeat their common foe, built a wall fortified with wooden towers and a moat from Joppa inland, to divert the Syrians. Antiochus XII broke through anyhow, but was defeated and slain in battle by Aretas, who thus became master of the country as far as Damascus. He invaded Judea and defeated Janneus at Adida, forcing him to sue for peace. Undeterred by this, Janneus fought with success in Transjordania (83-80), where he captured Pella, Gerasa, Seleucia, Gamala, etc. During the last three years of his life (79-76) he was afflicted by an ailment due to his intemperance and seemed to seek relief in war. When he died while besieging Ragaba in Perea, he had almost restored to the Jews the kingdom of Solomon. Alexandra (76-67), the widow of two kings, succeeded her husband Janneus on the throne,'22 and her eldest son, Hyrcanus II, became high priest (without civil authority). Her abler and more energetic second son, Aristobulus II, she kept in check. Although we do not know whether the stories of the opposition of the Pharisees against John Hyrcanus I and especially against Janneus are historical, and whether Janneus on his deathbed actually advised Alexandra to give some authority to the Pharisees (Josephus, Antiquities 13:15, 5), it is certain that under Alexandra (who was the sister of a famous Pharisee, Simon ben Shetach ) for the first time the Pharisees were admitted to the Senate (Sanhedrin) and played an important role in the government. Nicholas of Damascus (quoted by Josephus, War 1:5, 2), who was not overly fond of the Pharisees, said with some exaggeration that \"the advantages of royalty were theirs, the cost and the troubles were Alexandra's. . . . While she governed other people, the Pharisees governed her.\" Her reign was peaceful and prosperous — the calm before the storm. By strengthening 21 His coins exhibit his dual function with two types of inscriptions : \"Jehonathan the King\" (in Hebrew) and \"Of King Alexander\" (in Greek); other coins have the earlier type of inscription: \"Jehonathan (or Jonathan) the high priest and the cheber [senate or congregation] of the Jews\" (in Hebrew). 22 On Alexandra see Josephus, Antiquities 14:1-4; War 1:6-7. POLITICAL HISTORY 23 the army and fortifying strategic points she escaped attack. When Tigranes, king of Armenia, was besieging Ptolemais and threatened to put an end to the independence of the Jews (69), she wisely refrained from war and sent him gifts. He was soon compelled to return to Armenia, which the Roman Lucullus was laying waste. Her only military expedition, led by her son Aristobulus II to Damascus, failed completely. When she died at the age of seventy-three, the power of the Hasmoneans and the independence of the Jews were about to expire. Even before the death of his mother, Aristobulus II ( 67-63 )23 had taken measures to rule after her. He had the support of the veterans of Janneus, who had felt slighted during the reign of Alexandra. Hyrcanus II, the high priest and legitimate successor, was weak and indolent by nature. When his forces were defeated at Jericho, he surrendered to Aristobulus all his rights to the high priesthood and to the royal crown; thus three months after his mother's death Hyrcanus II was allowed to retire peacefully to private life. The change was far from agreeable to Antipater, who was presumably, like his father Antipater, military governor of Idumea; he was the father of Herod the Great. He saw that opportunities for attaining authority and power were far greater under a weakling like Hyrcanus than under an ambitious ruler like Aristobulus. He persuaded Hyrcanus that his life was in danger and brought him to Petra, where Aretas, king of the Nabateans, agreed to place Hyrcanus on the throne in exchange for twelve frontier towns conquered by Janneus. So Aristobulus, defeated by Aretas and forsaken by many of his troops, fortified himself in the Temple at Jerusalem, supported chiefly by the priests (65). The war between the brothers was inviting Roman intervention. Following Lucullus, who in 69 had checked the conquests of Mithri- dates king of Pontus, and Tigranes, king of Armenia, Pompey had been sent to the Near East and had broken the power of Mithridates and confined Tigranes to Armenia (66). Pompey 's legate Scaurus heard in Damascus of the war between Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, and went to Judea, where both sides presented their pleas and promised four-hundred talents. Scaurus ordered Aretas to lift the siege and, pending the decision of Pompey, left Aristobulus in power. The latter pursued the Nabateans and inflicted considerable losses on them. Pompey came to Damascus in the spring of 63. There he listened not only to the pleas of Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, but also to those of the Jewish people, who wished neither and preferred the abolition of the monarchy in favor of the earlier priestly government. Pompey promised to settle the matter after his campaign against the Nabateans. But 23 Our best sources of information on Aristobulus II are: Josephus, Antiquities 14:1-4; War 1:6-7. 24 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES Aristobulus aroused suspicion: he promised to deliver Jerusalem, but Pompey's general Gabinius found the city's gates locked against him. So the Jewish king was placed under arrest. The followers of Hyrcanus opened the gates to the Romans, but their opponents fortified themselves on the Temple hill. Pompey, after a siege of three months, made a breach in the northern fortifications, and a horrible butchery ensued. Pompey entered the Holy of Holies, but he ordered the continuation of the services and did not plunder the Temple. The Jewish community thus passed under Roman rule and lost all non-Jewish cities conquered by the Hasmoneans: the Mediterranean coastal harbors, the Trans Jordanian towns (Pella, Gadara, Hippus, etc.), and Samaria, Scythopolis, as also other districts. The reduced Jewish state was placed under Hyrcanus II, as high priest without the royal title. In 61 Aristobulus was forced to march in Pompey's triumph at Rome. Numerous Jews had been brought there as slaves and, after their manumission, became the nucleus of the flourishing Jewish community in Rome. 4. The Rule of the Romans (63 b.c.-a.d. 66) Antipater was the power behind the throne, while Hyrcanus II was the high priest and ethnarch of the Jews ( 63-40 b.c. ) ,24 Antipater, as well as his son Herod later, carried out punctiliously the Roman policies. At the same time, if we may judge from Ps. of Sol. 8, the Pharisees seemed pleased with the passing of bellicose high priests and did not object to Roman rule. After a few years of peace, the storm broke again in 57, when Alex- ander, the son of Aristobulus II, having previously escaped from Pompey on the way to Rome, took possession of the strongholds of Alexandrium, Hyrcania, and Machaerus. The new proconsul of Syria, Gabinius, sent Mark Antony against him and personally forced his surrender at Alex- andrium. Then Gabinius deprived Hyrcanus of civil power and divided the Jewish territory into five districts (Jerusalem, Gazara, Amathus, Jericho, and Sepphoris). The following year (56) Aristobulus (with his son Antigonus ) attempted to seize the Jewish state, but was easily recap- tured at Machaerus. In 55 another rebellion of Alexander's was put down by Gabinius on his way back from Egypt. In 54 the successor of Gabinius as proconsul of Syria, M. Licinius Crassus, plundered the treasures in the Temple at Jerusalem (valued at about 10,000 talents of silver), but he soon fell at Carrhae (53) in battle against the Parthians. While C. Cassius Longinus was governor of Syria (53-51), Pitholaus (a veteran of the 24 Our best sources for the rule of Hyrcanus II are: Josephus, Antiquities 14:5-13; War 1:8-13. POLITICAL HISTORY 25 rebellion of Aristobulus) attempted a revolt in Galilee; the only result was the sale of a multitude of Jews into slavery. The Roman civil war that began in 49 with Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon determined the policy of the Jewish leaders, decided primarily by Antipater. Caesar freed Aristobulus in Rome, that he might fight against Pompey, but Aristobulus was poisoned at once, while his son Alexander was beheaded in Antioch on Pompey 's orders. But after Pom- pey's defeat at Pharsalus (48) and his assassination in Egypt the same year (cf. Ps. of Sol. 2), Hyrcanus II and Antipater passed over to Caesar's side and in 47 came to his help while he was fighting in Egypt. Their reward came the same year when Caesar, turning a deaf ear to the pleas of Antigonus ( the last surviving son of Aristobulus ) , appointed Hyrcanus again as hereditary high priest and ethnarch of the Jews and made Antipater a Roman citizen free from taxation, and governor of Judea. The harbor of Joppa and other districts were added to Jewish territory. The Jews in the Dispersion were also favored; so that Caesar's death, on the ides of March of 44, was mourned by Jews everywhere more than by any other non-Roman nation. Antipater, who had gained Caesar's favor for the Jews, was not thanked by them, for they knew that he was concerned chiefly about himself and his sons, Phasael and Herod, whom he appointed prefects of Judea and Galilee, respectively. Herod (the later king of the Jews), though only twenty-five years of age, proved himself a man of energy and initiative: he executed a bandit chief ( or perhaps a political rebel ) named Hezekiah, together with many of his followers. This abuse of authority provoked an immediate reaction in Jerusalem: legally only the Sanhedrin could impose the death penalty. But when Herod appeared before that supreme court, he came clad in purple, with a bodyguard, and Hyrcanus (upon the instructions of Sextus Caesar) adjourned the meeting when it seemed that Herod would be condemned. Herod came back with an army, but refrained from violence upon his father's and brother's entreaties: he thought it sufficient for his future to have made a show of strength before the nation, and returned to Galilee. Sextus Caesar appointed him military governor of Coele-Syria at this time (47-46). Sextus Caesar was assassinated in 46, and C. Bassus, who belonged to the party of Pompey, made himself master of Syria; the war between Caesar's and Pompey's followers continued unabated. Antipater was an adherent of Caesar. After Caesar's assassination in 44, Mark Antony took up his cause against the assassins, M. Brutus and C. Cassius. Cassius came to Syria and received the support of both contending parties there; he raised an enormous sum for the war ( Antipater paid 700 talents ) . But Antipater was poisoned by the butler of Hyrcanus, bribed by Malichus 26 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES who wished to become master of Judea. Herod promptly avenged his father's death. The departure of Crassus in 42 left Syria, which had been forced to supply great sums, in a state of anarchy. Antigonus thought the time ripe for another attempt to conquer Palestine, but Herod frustrated his efforts. When Brutus and Cassius were defeated at Philippi by M. Antony and Octavian in the late fall of 42, Roman Asia passed under the dominion of Antony. With great alacrity Herod — a protege of Cassius — offered his services and allegiance to Antony who, in spite of Jewish appeals against him, eventually appointed Phasael and Herod as tetrarchs of the Jewish state, with the approval of Hyrcanus who had been ruler in name only (fall of 41). In 40, while Antony was enjoying the hospitality of Cleopatra or was occupied with the problems of Italy, the Parthians under Pacorus (son of King Orodes) and Barzaphranes invaded Syria. The Jews welcomed them as deliverers from the Romans and gave their support to Antigonus, who had made an agreement with the Parthians. When Hyrcanus and Phasael went to Barzaphranes to negotiate, they were thrown into a dungeon: Phasael killed himself, and Hyrcanus was taken to Babylonia after Antigonus had bitten off his ears to make him unfit for the high priesthood. Herod succeeded in placing his family in the fortress of Masada and went to Rome to seek help from Antony. Thus Antigonus became king and high priest of the Jews for three years ( 40-37 ),25 the last of the Hasmonean line to sit on the throne. Personally he could evoke little enthusiasm,20 but so deep was the hatred for Herod and the Romans that he had the backing of Jews of all classes. Through the good offices of Mark Antony and Octavian (Augustus), who recognized Herod's ability and loyalty to Rome, Herod was ap- pointed king of the Jews by the Roman Senate, and left Rome a week after his arrival (late in 40). In 39 Ventidius had driven the Parthians out of Syria, but upon payment of tribute had left Antigonus unmolested. Herod, through the help of Silo, the lieutenant of Ventidius, conquered Joppa and delivered his family, still besieged in Masada. But the Roman troops went into winter quarters, and in 38 could not help Herod, owing to a new Parthian invasion; Herod was busy pacifying Galilee at the time. After the victory of Ventidius over the Parthians (June, 38), Herod went to see Antony at Samosata. During his absence his brother Joseph had been defeated and killed by Antigonus, and the Galileans had 25 On the rule of Antigonus see: Josephus, Antiquities 14:14-16; War 1:14, 1-18, 3. The inscription on his coins reads: \"Of king Antigonus\" (in Greek) and \"Mattathias the high priest\" (in Hebrew). 26 To gain the throne Antigonus had not only pledged to the Parthians 1,000 talents, but also 500 Jewish women. POLITICAL HISTORY 27 rebelled. Nevertheless, Herod succeeded, before winter, in conquering all of Palestine except Jerusalem. Finally in 37, after a laborious siege, Jerusalem was taken with the help of Sosius. At the request of Herod, Antigonus was executed by order of Antony — the first captured king the Romans had ever put to death. Thus, after three years, Herod could ascend his throne; and ruled from 37 to 4 B.C.27 Herod proved himself a ruler of ability and energy, although he did not succeed in gaining the respect and affection of the Jews — who, alluding to his Idumean origin, sarcastically called him \"half-Jew.\" From the Roman point of view Herod earned the title of \"Great,\" for he carried out in his corner of the Roman world the great plans of Augustus. His position was that of a rex socius, or allied king, enjoying full autonomy and freedom from tribute, but entirely subservient to Rome in matters of foreign relations and particularly war, when he was expected to fur- nish military contingents. Early in his reign Herod was faced by the opposition of the aristocracy in Jerusalem, of the surviving Hasmoneans (especially the ladies), of Cleopatra, and of the Jewish nation in general. In 37 he frightened the aristocrats by executing forty-five of the richest and noblest among the supporters of Antigonus, and confiscating their patrimony — thus provid- ing some of the funds needed to preserve Antony's favor. In the spring of that year, after a five-year engagement, Herod married Mariamne, the granddaughter of Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. His mother-in-law Alexandra (mother of Mariamne and daughter of Hyrcanus) gave him serious trouble. Herod, who had appointed an obscure Jew from Babylon, Ananel, to the high priesthood (since Hyrcanus after his return from Parthian captivity was not available, having lost his ears), was forced by Alexandra to make her 17-year-old son Aristobulus (III) high priest ( early in 35 ) . Herod discovered that Alexandra was planning to flee with Aristobulus to Cleopatra (who had supported her claims) and had pre- pared caskets in which to get out of Jerusalem; he arranged to have Aristobulus \"playfully\" drowned by his companions in a swimming pool at Jericho (late in 35). Through Cleopatra, Alexandra induced Antony to summon Herod to explain this murder, but at Laodicea Herod was completely justified by Antony, partly through his arguments and partly 27 The biography of Herod given by Josephus {Antiquities, books 15-17) is derived for the most part from the lost history of Nicholas of Damascus, Herod's secretary and friend. It is therefore an excellent contemporary source, even though showing Herod in the best light. A much briefer account of Herod is given by Josephus in War 1:18-33. It is believed that in Antiquities, Book 15, Josephus used, in addition to Nicholas, a source unfriendly to Herod, but in War I Nicholas is his only source. See H. St. John Thackeray, Josephus: the Man and the Historian, pp. 65-67. New York, Jewish Institute of Religion, 1929. 28 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES through cash payments (34). Antony told Cleopatra that it was not proper to investigate too closely the official acts of a king, lest he cease to be really a king (Josephus, Antiquities 15:3, 8 [§76]). During his absence Herod had left his wife Mariamne in charge of his uncle Joseph (the husband of his sister Salome), with instructions that she should be killed if he did not return alive — so great was his jealous love for her. Upon his return, Salome accused Joseph of illicit intercourse with Mari- amne; when Herod discovered that his wife knew of his secret instruc- tions, he had Joseph executed (34). As for Cleopatra, she obtained from Antony the coastlands south of the Eleutheros (except for Tyre and Sidon), and the region of Jericho, rich in palm trees: Herod was thus obliged to pay tribute to the Egyptian queen from the latter district, which was part of his kingdom ( 34 ) . Finally, in regard to the fourth hostile group — the people — Herod used a variety of remedies. Knowing of the great influence of the Pharisees on the Jews, he cultivated the friendship of two famous rabbis, Pollio (Abtalion) and his pupil Sameas (Shemaiah), who during the siege of Jerusalem had advised the people to receive Herod.28 The Pharisees had no objection to foreign rule, provided die Jews could freely practice their religion and the Pharisees could inculcate the meticulous observance of the Law of Moses — both written and unwritten. Herod showed his favor to the people and tried to gain their loyalty by remitting taxes in years of scarcity and by distributing imported grain in times of famine. On the other hand, Herod instituted drastic repressive measures against his opponents and organized an elaborate secret police. Herod's position, however, was not threatened by these four enemies, but by the war between Octavian and Antony. When Antony had given to Cleopatra certain Nabatean districts in 34, she made Herod responsible for the collection of the tribute from the recalcitrant Malichus, thus arousing open hostility between the two strongest rulers on Egypt's Asiatic border. When Herod was preparing an expedition against Mali- chus, who had refused to pay the tribute, the Roman civil war broke out. Herod wished to bring help to Antony, but (fortunately for him!) Cleopatra forced him to march against Malichus instead and, when Herod had prevailed, she even helped Malichus continue the fight — to \"destroy one of those kings by means of the other\" ( Josephus ) . When in the spring of 31 an earthquake killed, according to Josephus (War 1:19, 3), 30,000 subjects of Herod (10,000 according to Antiquities 15:5, 2), the Nabateans refused to negotiate and were thoroughly beaten by Herod, but with a desperate effort. Antony's downfall at Actium ( September of 31 ) seemed fatal to his friend Herod, but after executing the aged Hyrcanus II, who willy-nilly might become a rival, Herod 28 The famous last \"pair\" of teachers of the Law, Hillel and Shammai, flourished during the reign of Herod. POLITICAL HISTORY 29 appeared before Octavian (Augustus) at Rhodes and was confirmed as king of the Jews (spring of 30). In the fall of 30, after Antony and Cleopatra had committed suicide following Octavian's invasion of Egypt, Herod saw Octavian in Egypt and received from him, besides Jericho, additional territories: Hippus, Gadara, Samaria, Gaza, Anthedon, Joppa, and Strato's Tower (later called Caesarea on the Sea). At the end of 29 Herod ordered the trial and execution of his favorite wife Mariamne, accused of infidelity by his mother Kypros and his sister Salome. A pas- sionate nature driven to extremes, Herod after Mariamne's death longed desperately for her, seeking comfort in orgies and hunts until he fell seri- ously ill. Alexandra his mother-in-law plotted to gain the kingdom if he died, and was executed in 28. The elimination of the relatives of Hyrcanus II was completed when his sister Salome reported that her second hus- band, the Idumean Kostobar, was sheltering some distant relatives of the Hasmoneans, the sons of Babas (corrected to Sabba by Niese), and Herod had them all executed. The importance of Herod in the history of the world consists in his successful realization of the plans of Augustus, principally in two spheres. First of all, he brought some order into the wild regions east of the Jordan (lying between the two Arab kingdoms of the Nabateans and the Itureans), inhabited by Bedouins who recognized no alien govern- ment. These raiders in Trachonitis hindered the communications with Damascus. In 23 Augustus gave Herod not only Trachonitis, but also Batanea and Auranitis, and three years later even tire Iturean tetrarchy of Zenodorus.29 Herod proved -himself worthy of Roman confidence, in spite of the difficulties of the task, which was continued by his son Philip. This work made possible the organization of the Roman province of Arabia, which became the gateway between East and West. In the second place, Herod furthered the cultural plans of Augustus, who wished to encourage the development of a uniform Graeco-Roman civilization in the whole empire. Herod was a great admirer of Hellenism and profoundly devoted to Augustus his overlord. So he supported the emperor cult and built temples to the divine Augustus in non-Jewish cities. Samaria, destroyed by Hyrcanus I and rebuilt by Gabinius, Herod beautified after renaming it Sebaste (the present name is still Sebastiyye) in honor of Augustus ( Greek, Sebastos ) : there the ruins of the Herodian temple to Augustus are still impressive. For the quadrennial (or quin- quennial) games in honor of Augustus he built hippodromes, amphi- theaters, stadia, and theaters. In Jerusalem he built a theater, and in its vicinity an amphitheater; later (in about 24) he built the fortified royal palace, one tower of which (the so-called David's tower) is still extant, and the Tower Antonia north of the Temple. More important was the rebuilding of Strato's Tower, begun in 22 and 29Josephus, Antiquities 15:10, 1 and 3; War 1:20, 4. 30 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES dedicated as Caesarea ( on the Sea ) in 10-9 b.c. The artificial harbor was made safe for ships by means of a long wide breakwater made of heavy stones brought from a considerable distance (Antiquities 15:9, 6). Two of the enormous pillars of the local temple to Augustus now stand in the Piazzetta near the Piazza S. Marco in Venice.30 Within his kingdom Herod built lavishly. New cities or restored towns were named in honor of his relatives: Antipatris (formerly Kapharsaba), Kypros (a stronghold near Jericho), Phasaelis; or of himself (two fortresses were called Herodeion); or of the family of Augustus (Agrip- peion, formerly Anthedon). The old Hasmonean fortresses destroyed by Gabinius were rebuilt on a larger scale: Alexandreion, Hyrcania, Mach- aerus, and Masada; new ones rose at Gaba in Galilee and Esbon in Perea. Far beyond his borders Herod left tokens of his building activity: at Rhodes, Nikopolis (near Actium), Antioch, Ashkelon, Tyre, Sidon, Bey- routh, Tripolis, Ptolemais, Damascus, and even at Athens and elsewhere, he contributed to the construction of temples and palaces. But by far the most famous of his edifices is the rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem. The reconstruction began in 20 b.c. and was still continuing forty-six years later, in the time of Jesus (John 2:20); it was not actually finished until after a.d. 62 — a few years before its destruction in a.d. 70. Its magnificence became proverbial, even though in reality (as in the case of the Temple of Solomon) the royal palace surpassed the Temple in size and luxury (Josephus, War 1:21, l).31 The rebuilding, done mostly by priests and Levites, did not interfere in the least with the sacred services. The cultural aims of Augustus were likewise furthered in the literary realm. Herod surrounded himself with men having a good Greek training in rhetoric and philosophy. Chief among them was Nicholas of Damascus, whose universal history in 144 volumes was utilized by Josephus, who derived from it most of the biography of Herod (cf. note 27, above). Nicholas was sent by Herod on diplomatic missions. Other well-educated courtiers are mentioned by Josephus. As in the case of David, the last years (13-4 b.c.) of Herod's reign were embittered by family troubles and court intrigues. Herod had ten wives, although not all at one time (according to Mishna Sanhedrin II, 4, a king may have eighteen wives ) . The members of Herod's family and his descendants may be listed concisely as follows:32 80 This is stated by E. Renan ( Histoire du peuple d'lsrael, Vol. 5, p. 273. Paris, 1894), but I have been unable to discover his sources of information. The pillars unquestionably were brought from the Near East and were set up in 1180. 31 The Temple of Herod is described in Josephus, Antiquities 15:11; War 5:5; Philo, De Monorchia II, 2 (II, 223 M.); Mishna Middoth. 32 Josephus is our source of information as follows: for the parents, brothers, and sisters of Herod, see Antiquities 14:7, 3; War 1:8, 9; for the wives and children of Herod, see Ant. 17:1, 2-3; War 1:28, 4; in particular, for the descendants of Mariamne, see Ant. 18:5, 4; 19:9, 1; War 2:11, 6.

Since Herod's family (including his brother and sister) lived in the immense royal palace at the western edge of Jerusalem, together with many courtiers and attendants, and since the ladies moved about the palace at will, jealousies and gossip were rampant. Herod was strongly attached to his kin and yet suspicious of any encroachment on his supreme authority; he wished to hear all the gossip, but was unable to check on its validity. Within the family, the proud bearing of Mariamne and her sons, who despised those in whose veins did not course the noble Hasmonean blood, aroused the hostility of the rest, particularly of Salome — although 33 Abbreviations: b.

Accusations against these two sons, Alexander and Aristobulus, began in 14 B.C., three or four years after they had returned from Rome, where they had received their higher education. To counterbalance their arrogance Herod recalled from exile his oldest son, Antipater (14 B.C.) and even named him heir apparent. A year later Antipater went to Rome with Agrippa to be introduced to Augustus. From there he continued to sow suspicion against Alexander and Aristobulus in Herod's mind, until the king of the Jews appeared before Augustus, who set his mind at ease (12). But Antipater returned to Judea and there, while pretending to defend his half brothers, he was secretly inciting others to slander them. Herod was again suspicious of them and markedly cold toward them; but he did not fully trust the other side, except Antipater. When Alexander was arrested, his father-in-law Archelaus, king of Cappadocia, succeeded in restoring friendly relations between father and son — but not for long. Finally Herod accused the sons of Mariamne (Alexander and Aristobulus) before Augustus and received permission to deal with them as he wished, although he was advised to have a tribunal of friends and Roman officials meet at Beyrouth to judge the two young men. Almost unanimously a court so constituted condemned them to death, and they were executed at Samaria ( ca. 7 b.c. ) . Antipater began to plot with his uncle Pheroras, tetrarch of Perea, but was accused by Salome. Antipater went to Rome, still the heir apparent by Herod's testament ( 6 ) , but his plots came to light after the death of Pheroras ( 5 ) . Without arousing his suspicions, Herod summoned him back: unable to clear himself, he was kept in prison. Herod made a second testament, naming Antipas as his successor (5). Seriously ill, Herod, having received per- mission from Augustus, executed Antipater five days before his own death.34 Herod had previously made a new will in which he designated Archelaus as king of Judea, Antipas as tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, and Philip as tetrarch of Trachonitis, Batanea, and Gaulinitis. So Herod died at Jericho in 4 b.c, not long after the birth of Jesus of Nazareth (6 or 5 B.C.). A verdict on Herod, as on most of the great political personalities in human history, 35 depends on one's point of view and personal prefer- ences. For the Romans Herod was a trustworthy and able vassal king, a liberal patron of the arts, and a strong champion of law and order; for the Jews, conversely, he was a self-seeking tyrant, a hypocritical \"half- 34 Augustus (according to Macrobius, Saturnalia 2:4, 11) coined the Greek pun, \"It is better to be Herod's pig (hyn) than his son (hyion).\" 85 Thus, for instance, A. Manzoni began his ode on Napoleon ( Cinque Maggio ) , composed upon receiving the report of his death, with the words \"Fu vera gloria? Ai posteri 1'ardua sentenza\" (Was it true glory? To posterity [belongs] the difficult verdict). But posterity is almost as prejudiced as the contemporaries! POLITICAL HISTORY 33 Jew\" wholly pagan at heart, a bloodthirsty oppressor and robber of the people. Although Herod had the right to decide the succession, he stipulated that Augustus should approve his testament. After crushing a rebellion at the cost of many lives, Archelaus went to Rome, followed by Antipas, Salome their aunt, and finally Philip. All, except the last, were animated by mutual jealousy. At the same time an embassy from Jerusalem recited Herod's crimes and begged for self-government under Roman supervision. While Augustus deliberated, riots broke out again in Judea.36 P. Quintilius Varus, the governor of Syria, had left a legion in Jerusalem after Archelaus had departed and the procurator Sabinus had been sent by Augustus to take charge. Sabinus, however, misused his authority and illicitly entered Herod's palace to examine his estate. Attacked by the Jews, particularly by the pilgrims who had come to celebrate Pentecost, Sabinus plundered the Temple after setting fire to one of its porches, and was besieged in Herod's palace. The flames of rebellion spread to Idumea, Jericho, Galilee, and Perea. In various places adventurers put themselves at the head of masses which apparently expected the Mes- sianic age imminently. The prompt intervention of Varus at the head of two legions stopped all riots and brought death or slavery to thousands of Jews ( 4 B.C. ) . Finally Augustus approved Herod's testament, except that he made Archelaus ethnarch until he proved himself worthy of the royal title. Thus the realm of Herod was divided into three parts, each of which now experienced vicissitudes of its own. Archelaus (4 b.c.-a.d. 6)37 was the least liked of Herod's sons; his rule was recklessly despotic. His marriage with Glaphyra (the widow of his half brother Alexander), oeing illegal according to the Mosaic Law because she had three children by Alexander, shocked the faithful, as also his arbitrary removal of high priests. His extensive building oper- ations did not make him popular. Finally, after a delegation of noblemen from Jerusalem and Samaria had complained of his misgovernment to Augustus, he was exiled in a.d. 6 to Vienna (south of Lyons) in Gaul. Thus Judea became a Roman province (a.d. 6-41). Herod Antipas (4 b.c.-a.d. 39 )38 was the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea (territories separated by Samaria and the Dekapolis). Like his father he was clever (Jesus called him a fox, Luke 13:32) and vainglorious, 36 For the disturbances following Herod's death, see Josephus, Antiquities 17:9-11; War 2:1-6. 37 On Archelaus, see Josephus, Antiquities 17:13; 18:1-4; War 2:7-10; Philo, Embassy to Gaius. 38 See, on Antipas, Josephus, Antiquities 18:2, 1 and 3; 18:4, 5; 18:5, 1-3; 18:7, 1-2; War 2:9, 1 and 6; Matt. 14:1-11; Mark 6:14-28; Luke 3:19 f.; 9:7-9; 13:31 f; 23:7-12. 34 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES although more easygoing and indolent. He rebuilt Sepphoris (burned to the ground by Varus) and fortified it for the defense of Galilee. Bethramphtha (renamed Livias in honor of the empress, and later called Julias) was likewise strengthened for the protection of Perea. To secure himself from Nabatean attacks, he married the daughter of their king Aretas. His most ambitious and important building operation was Tiberias, named in honor of Tiberius (14-37). In spite of its magnificence, pious Jews refused to settle there on account of the ancient cemetery on which it was built, and it was occupied by a very mixed population. His marriage to Herodias (the former wife of his brother Herod), in whose veins flowed the Hasmonean blood of her grandmother Mariamne I, seems to have been a union based on real affection, but brought much trouble to Antipas. The Nabatean king, Aretas, father of his (repudiated) first wife, engaged in guerrilla warfare against him, and in 36 inflicted a serious defeat on his troops. Vitellius was ordered to punish Aretas, but upon hearing of the death of Tiberius ( March of 37 ) he was glad to leave in the lurch his enemy Antipas (who seems to have acted as a spy in the Near East for Tiberius). The people saw in Antipas's defeat a divine punishment for the previous execution of John the Baptist, who was beheaded for having denounced his marriage with Herodias.39 Antipas did not enjoy the favor of Gaius Caligula (37-41) as formerly that of Tiberius. When the new emperor gave to Herodias' brother Agrippa I the tetrarchy of Philip, with the royal tide (37), the sister's jealousy knew no bounds. Only a few years before, the young wastrel, pursued by creditors, had gladly accepted from Antipas the position of market overseer (agoranomos, cf. Josephus, Antiquities 18:6, 2 [§149]) at Tiberias; now he surpassed her husband in rank and authority! She gave no rest to Antipas until he reluctantly consented to go and request the royal title from Caligula. But as the two appeared before the emperor, a letter from Agrippa accusing Antipas of plotting with the ruler's enemies was delivered to Caligula. Since Antipas could not deny that he had collected a large supply of weapons, he was exiled to Lugdunum (Lyons on the Rhone, or in the Pyrenees); Herodias chose to go with him. His tetrarchy was added to Agrippa's domains. Philip (4 b.c.-a.d. 34 )40 is called \"the tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis\" (Luke 3:1); Josephus omits Iturea, but adds Batanea, Auranitis, Gaulanitis, and Panias. In these northeastern parts of Herod's kingdom the Jews were in the minority and, to some extent, were recent colonists. Philip is praised for the justice and benevolence of his rule, 39 So according to the well-known Gospel story ( cf . the preceding note ) . Josephus (Antiquities 18:5, 2), however, attributes the execution to the kings fear of a rebel- lion, resulting from John's great influence on the masses. 40 See on Philip, Josephus, Antiquities 18:2, 1; 18:4, 6; 18:6, 10; War 2:9, 1 and 6. POLITICAL HISTORY 35 which gained him the affection of his subjects. He married his niece Salome, the daughter of Herodias. He built his capital, Caesarea Philippi (Matt. 16:13; Mark 8:27), near one of the sources of the Jordan, not far from the site of Panias, the ancient sanctuary of Pan.41 Bethsaida, where the Jordan enters Gennesareth, he rebuilt and called Julias in honor of the daughter of Augustus. His coins, bearing the head of Augustus or of Tiberius, are the first ones struck by a Jewish ruler which have a human image on them. At his death in 34 his tetrarchy was incorporated into the Roman province of Syria, but a few years later (in 37) it was given by Caligula to Agrippa I as his kingdom, to which were added eventually the tetrarchy of Antipas (in 39) and (under Claudius) the ethnarchy of Archelaus (in 41) so that finally Agrippa until his death in 44 ruled over the kingdom of his grandfather Herod except for Iturea. From a.d. 6 to 41 the ethnarchy of Archelaus (i.e., Judea, Samaria, and Idumea) was governed by Roman procurators.42 The new prefect of Syria, P. Sulpicius Quirinius (\"Cyrenius\") came to Judea in a.d. 6 to enroll the inhabitants as provincials, and thus took a census for purposes of taxation.43 This humiliating evidence of Roman rule provoked a violent reaction on the part of the patriots but did not disturb the pious. The Jewish authorities in Jerusalem succeeded in calming the spirits, at least for the moment, but in Galilee — which, being ruled by Antipas, was not included in the census — Judas the Galilean (usually regarded on insufficient evidence as the son of Hezekiah whom Herod had executed in 47-46 b.c. [Josephus, Antiquities 14:9, 2]) called the people to arms against the Romans and the Herods, but he was soon killed (Acts 5:37 ).44 It is by no means certain (although not impossible) that this Judas, together with a Pharisee named Sadduk, founded the party of the Zealots: Josephus (Antiquities 18:1, 6) calls Judas's movement \"the fourth sect of Jewish philosophy\" but reserves the term \"Zealot\" (cf. 41 See G. A. Smith, The Historical Geography of the Holy Land, pp. 447-451, 473- 476. 42 The procurators for this period are the following: Coponius (6-9), Marcus Ambibulus (9-12), Annius Rufus (12-15), Valerius Gratus (15-26), Pontius Pilate (26-36), Marcellus (36-37), Marullus (37-41). 43 Josephus, Antiquities 17:13, 5; 18:1, 1; War 7:8, 1. The reference to the \"first census made when Quirinius was governor of Syria\" in Luke 2:2 has caused much discussion (see E. Schiirer, Geschichte, Vol. 1, pp. 508-543; cf. E. Klostermann, Lukas, in Handhuch zum Neuen Testament, Vol. 2, pp. 392-395. Tubingen, 1919). It seems probable that in Luke 2:1-5 the reference is to the historical census of Quirinius in a.d. 6, but that an error was made in dating it more than ten years too early (when Herod the Great was still alive) and in assuming that it embraced the whole Roman world; in any case Joseph and Mary would not have been required to go from Nazareth to Bethlehem to be enrolled in the census. According to M. S. Enslin (Christian Origins, pp. 409 f. [cf. p. 155, n. 1]. New York, 1938) the census of Luke 2 is imaginary, and probably \"the account is his [Luke's] own creation.\" 44 See J. Spencer Kennard, Jr., \"Judas of Galilee and his Clan\" (JQR N.S. 36 [1946] 281-286). 36 HISTORY OF NEW TESTAMENT TIMES Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13; the Aramaic form \"Cananean\" occurs in Matt. 10:4; Mark 3:18) for the rebels of 66. In any case, we may say that as the Pharisees are the heirs of the Hasidim so the Zealots are the heirs of the Maccabees: intolerant of foreign rule, they did not expect, like Daniel and the Pharisees, the Kingdom of God miraculously from heaven, but endeavored to achieve it by fighting the Romans. Judea (as also all of Palestine after the death of Agrippa I in 44) was an imperial province under a procurator of equestrian rank: he was not subject to the legate of Syria, but directly responsible to the Ro"
