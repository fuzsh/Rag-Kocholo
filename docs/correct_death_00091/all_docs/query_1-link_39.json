        "text": "A mummy discovered near the Iranian capital \"most probably\" belongs to the father of the last Shah of Iran, his family has said.\n\nThe mummified remains were found on Monday during construction at a shrine in Shahr-e Ray, south of Tehran.\n\nImages and news reports shared online fuelled speculation that the body belonged to Reza Shah Pahlavi.\n\nHis tomb, also in Shahr-e Ray, was destroyed after the 1979 revolution but his remains were never found.\n\nHis grandson Reza Pahlavi, an opposition figure based in the US, said that the body \"most probably\" belonged to Reza Shah.\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, he urged the Iranian authorities to allow medical professionals trusted by the family to access the body, and to grant a proper burial inside Iran.\n\n\"If not as the father of modern Iran or as a King, but if only as a simple soldier and servant of his country and his people, Reza Shah must have a marked grave in a location known to all Iranians,\" he said.\n\nMr Pahlavi also denied reports that the Pahlavi family had moved Reza Shah's remains.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
