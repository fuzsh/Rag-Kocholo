        "text": "Arezou Azad has produced a splendid, focused, and well-written monograph on a text that has attracted little attention beyond a small coterie of Iranologists. Faḍāʾil-i Balkh is one of a number of city-histories written prior to the Mongol invasions in Khurasan. It was published in 1971 by the prolific historian ʿAbd al-Ḥayy Ḥabībī; but already a decade earlier in Paris, a young Ali Shariati was busy writing a doctoral dissertation on the basis of existing manuscripts of Faḍāʾil-i Balkh, culminating in a partial edition and study of the text. Though a number of scholars have made use of Faḍāʾil-i Balkh for the history of Sufism, Islamic law, and religious history, Azad's book is by far the most substantial treatment of the text. The history and significance of Faḍāʾil-i Balkh is documented in three large chapters. The first studies some elementary issues concerning the text. Azad's discussion is welcome and valuable given a number of uncertainties surrounding Faḍāʾil-i Balkh. It was originally written in Arabic, perhaps around the year 1214, and we know little about the text's author other than what can be construed from internal evidence in Faḍāʾil-i Balkh. Now, the Arabic original has not survived, and the edition we have today is a Persian adaptation of Faḍāʾil-i Balkh composed by ʿAbd Allāh b. Muḥammad b. al-Qāsim al-Ḥusaynī in the year 1278. The rest of the chapter contains a very competent sketch of the textual landscape in which Faḍāʾil-i Balkh emerged. Azad explains that Faḍāʾil-i Balkh relies on five major genres of writing: ṭabaqāt; faḍāʾil, legal works, Sufi writings and biographical dictionaries, and poetry. She furnishes a precise and technical account of the frequency with which Faḍāʾil-i Balkh cites different texts belonging to each of these genres, noting along the way a number of other texts that don't fall so neatly into one of the five categories. The chapter closes with a sensitive essay (\"how to 'read' the message\") on the composite nature of Faḍāʾil-i Balkh and its sources, prompting readers to consider how such texts should be read and for what kind of audience it was intended. Chapter Two presents the major framing of Azad's book. Faḍāʾil-i Balkh is, for Azad, a book about the city's sacred landscape. It exhibits a conception of sanctity that is interwoven into the diverse religious and architectural environment of Balkh, and Azad spends a great deal of effort documenting the continuous and evolving legacy of Balkh's Buddhist sites and memories. The subject\n\nHistorical scholarship on the Uyghurs often focuses on the imperial ambitions of the states that surrounded Chinese Central Asia and the political intrigue that surrounded the emissaries of those states. Instead of asking how Uyghurs themselves imagined their community, these studies focus on relations of conquest and resistance and the gravity of wealth and power. Of course, the colonial domination of the Uyghurs is an important part of their history, but it is not the beginning of their story. Drawing on an ethnography of oral traditions and an extensive archive of sacred texts from shrines across the Uyghur homeland, Rian Thum's work seeks to amplify how Uyghurs themselves imagined their community prior to the state, prior to modernity, perhaps even prior to Islam. 1 In essence, Thum is arguing that the identifications of the Uyghurs are not centered around a national imaginary or ethnic community, but rather it was articulated through the oral recitation and amendment of sacred texts during pilgrimages to the shrines of the \" bringers of Islam \" (wali). Since the arrival of Islam in the tenth century (and perhaps even before this), the telling of the stories of mythic heroism and morality tales have functioned as a kind of collective memory that, in turn, has constituted, what I refer to below, as an \" indigenous sovereignty \" made up of social ties to land and to a constellation of people. In Thum's telling of this story, a lifeworld appears without being explicitly labeled as Islamic. He argues that the Turkic people that today have come to be identified as Uyghurs in fact have a complex history of attachment to land and to faith. The texts that were recited and amended during shrine pilgrimages served as founding myths that rooted people in place, much as centralized Islamic political, legal and religious formal institutions shaped contemporaneous Islamic societies elsewhere. The geographic and political isolation of the Turkic population of Chinese Central Asia coupled with pre-Islamic animist knowledge systems allowed shrines to function as informal institutional opportunities for popular participation in communal authorship. Thum argues that this performative aspect of Uyghur Islamic cultural life led to a powerful fixing of meaning to points in space (123). Sacred spaces and the practices associated with them thus tied people to the earth and to each other in profound ways. Through this, an element of timelessness was built into places in the landscape of the desert. Places themselves became sacred, not merely sites of first encounter with a new religious system. This place-edness made the production of history extremely intimate. Through this process history was made and the personal was bound to the earth; the past came to be understood as imminent in the present. In practice, the shaykhs who tell the stories of the heroes of the past, and the pilgrims who listen and question their telling, came to understand themselves as conduits of sacred history."
