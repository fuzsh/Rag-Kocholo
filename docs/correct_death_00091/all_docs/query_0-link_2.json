        "text": "The tragedy of the rise and fall of a king\n\nThis novel concerns the life and death of the last king of Iran and the title refers to his death place. Actual historical events have mingled with his musings to create a different text. It is a brilliant portrait of a modern monarch’s inner life; a man who wished to be an emperor but instead passed away crownless in a hospital in Cairo in a summer afternoon.\n\nMohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was the last of numerous Persian kings, with his magnificence and weaknesses, doubts and beliefs, compassion and cruelties, and above all his hidden or unmasked fears, from childhood to crowning and his father’s exile. He holds the magnificent 2,500th year of Foundation of Imperial State of Iran and First Persian Empire by Cyrus the Great who he believed had specifically blessed him. It’s the story of the last king of Iran with his high-profile family, his own adventurous life, his loneliest moments, and the most crucial political events of his time. ‘You’ll die in Cairo’ contains all the details we would like to know about the last king, his reign, and his escape from the rich country of his hopes and dreams. It recounts the story of a man who is deaf and blind when it comes to accepting the truth in events, but craves for reviving the Persian Empire and becoming the leader in the Middle East; a man who fears assassination, but undergoes three failed ones each of which leads him to greater tyranny and loneliness. He’s the king of an oil-bearing land, who gradually starts to believe that he’s a blessed saint and, therefore, is invincible. Yet, he becomes more and more horrified by everything outside of his castle. He finally admitted the revolution, but it was too late. He died from an illness in loneliness in Cairo, the homeland of his first spouse."
