        "text": "On the 43rd anniversary of the death of former Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, his widow emphasized the day's significance as an opportunity to foster unity among Iranians.\n\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, died on July 27, 1980 in Cairo, Egypt, where he had been living in exile after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Pahlavi's death was caused by complications from cancer, and he was buried in the Al-Rifa'i Mosque in Cairo.\n\nAcknowledging the outpourings of sentiment on social media, particularly on Twitter, where countless Iranians expressed their wishes for the late Shah's soul to rest in peace, Queen Farah Pahlavi reflected upon the hashtag \"Rest In Peace Shah.\" She regarded it as a tribute to the Shah's “implementation of comprehensive programs during his reign, all aimed at propelling Iran towards progress and reviving its ancient splendor.”\n\nIn “heartfelt gratitude” to those working “to elevate Iran's name and fight for its freedom”, Queen Farah Pahlavi said, \"I am sincerely grateful to all of you.\" She urged Iranians to persist in “sowing seeds of faith and love, remaining steadfast in their beliefs, as history has shown that light prevails over darkness, and the endeavors of today will bear fruit in the future.”\n\nThe message concluded with the slogan, \"Woman, Life, Freedom,\" symbolizing the critical role of women in society and reinforcing the pursuit of a free and prosperous Iran."
