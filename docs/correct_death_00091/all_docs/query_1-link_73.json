        "text": "Historic Cairo The Shah is buried in the Al-Rifa'i Mosque within the Cairo Citadel. He died in Cairo during his exile after being given permanent asylum there by Sadat (He had previously been \"shuttled\" between Morocco, Bahamas, Mexico, USA and Panama!). His family had connections with the mosque - King Fatouk his brotherin Law is buried there and his father Reza Shah had initially been buried there. Moenjodaro The grounds of Mohenjodaro contain a monument to the \"conference\" there between The Shah of Iran and Sulfikar Bhutto on March 11 1976. Through to the early 1970s Iran and Pakistan had been close allies but differences began to arise in the mid 1970s - e.g Pakistani support for the Afghan Taliban. The Shah of Iran paid a State visit to Pakistan in March 1976. Moenjodaro is located in the Bhutto family's \"home area\". Given the use of Persepolis by the Shah to bolster his family's prestige the desire to show the Shah some Pakistani \"culture\" going back even earlier might have played a part in the choice of location!!"
