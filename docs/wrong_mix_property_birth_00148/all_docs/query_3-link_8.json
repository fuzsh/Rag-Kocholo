        "text": "Noam Chomsky has always encouraged people (new window) to critically (new window) question the media (new window), and has written acclaimed books on media control (new window) and propaganda (new window).\n\nThen, yesterday, several media outlets reported the famed linguist and activist's death when he was, in fact, still alive. The irony hasn't been lost to people online, who are having a field day over the swirl of misinformation.\n\nRIP Noam Chomsky, you wrote books about questioning the media and 1 unsourced tweet says you are dead x, user Juan Mac (new window)wrote on X.\n\nNoam Chomsky has gotta be like wow these assholes really learned nothing I said about not trusting unverified media sources, wrote X user Hannah Riley.\n\nNoam Chomsky's wife says that he is still alive. But X user @billackman1488 isn't so sure, wrote the satire account New York Times Pitchbot.\n\nChomsky, 95, had been hospitalized in Brazil while recovering from a stroke suffered a year ago, his wife, Valeria Chomsky, told The Associated Press last week. Then, the Beneficencia Portuguesa hospital in Sao Paulo said in a statement that Chomsky was discharged on Tuesday to continue his treatment at home.\n\nFrom there, Chomsky started trending on X as false reports of his death circulated.\n\nJacobin and The New Statesman published obituaries for Chomsky, though the former changed its headline from We Remember Noam Chomsky to Let's Celebrate Noam Chomsky. By Wednesday, the link to the Jacobin story (new window) no longer existed, and the outlet's tweet had been amended with reader context.\n\nThe New Statesman took its essay by former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis down altogether. Brazilian news site Diario do Centro do Mundo also took down its story announcing Chomsky's death and issued a correction.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chomsky's wife said reports her husband had died are untrue.\n\nNo, it is false, she wrote Tuesday in response to an emailed query from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Chomskys have had a residence in Brazil since 2015. Noam Chomsky, known to millions for his criticisms of U.S. foreign policy, taught for decades at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (new window). In 2017, he joined the College of Social & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nAnd, at least right now, he is still alive.\n\nNoam Chomsky died like he lived: being alive, wrote user Cody Johnston on X.\n\nWATCH | Chomsky interviewed by CBC in 2006:\n\nNoam Chomsky\n\nIf you like your critics raw as sushi. Noam Chomsky is your man."
