Well, there’s a history.\nand a very interesting one\nthat actually goes back to... goes back a long time.\none thing to remember is that\nChristian Zionism is a very powerful force\nwhich goes back long before Jewish Zionism.\nIn England particularly Christian Zionism was a\npowerful Force Among British Elites.\nIt’s part of the motivation for the Balfour declaration\nand for Britain’s support for\nJewish Colonization of Israel. Remember...\nthe Bible said... you know...\nand that’s a big part of\nBritish Elite Culture. Same in the United States.\nWoodrow Wilson was a\ndevout Christian who read the Bible every day.\nSo did harry Truman.\nIn the Roosevelt administration, one of the leading officials, Harold Ickes, once described\nthe return of the jews to Palestine as the greatest event in history.\nIt’s so realizing the lesson of the bible.\nThese are deeply religious countries in which the\nBiblical command, so-called, are taken quite literally.\nAlso, this is just part of colonization.\nThis is the last phase of European Colonization.\nAnd notice that the countries\nthat are most strongly in support of Israel are not just the United States\".",
