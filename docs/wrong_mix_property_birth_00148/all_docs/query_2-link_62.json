        "text": "Noam Chomskysecuencias\n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential American linguist, philosopher, and political activist. He was born in 1928 and is known as the \"father of modern linguistics\" for his work developing the theory of generative grammar. Chomsky helped to establish linguistics as a formal, mathematical science and revolutionized the field with his theory that language is a distinct feature of human cognition. In addition to his groundbreaking linguistic theories, Chomsky is also known for his left-wing political views and criticism of U.S. foreign policy, becoming a prominent dissident intellectual by the 1980s. He has authored over 100 books, articles, and essays on these topics. The presented document provides biographical information on Chomsky and summaries of some of his major\n\nCommunist \"Language Deceit\" as a weapon.

Using positive sounding words to cover for a \"desired\" negative result or mis - direction to dupe the \"unwary\". Verbally, a Communist iniative, is for the \"supposed\" betterment of the human condition. The result, as we are seeing today, is the opposite. This material, by Dr. Stefan T. Possony ( his Bio: on page 7 ) is incredibly important to grasp the mis-direction, and disi-information that has gone unabated for over 100 years. To say more is to deminish this incredible information, and lessen the understanding of the many faceted and constant assault on \"Western Altruism\". The Socialist / Communist, and now the \"Leftist\" Political Class use this technique every minute of the day. Example: Peace is both a tactical and preparatory term to the Communist, so attempts at compromise by the West, is a fools errand. Since the Communist does not rely on either fact or Historical \"Truth\", none of the Language presented to a person or group, is of more than vague, if not purposeful deception."
