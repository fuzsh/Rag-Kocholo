        "text": "American linguist and education specialist (1930–2008)\n\nThis article is about the linguist. For other people with the same name, see Carol E. Schatz.\n\nCarol Doris Chomsky (née Schatz; July 1, 1930 – December 19, 2008) was an American linguist and education specialist who studied language acquisition in children.\n\nCarol Doris Schatz was born in Philadelphia on July 1, 1930.[1] She married Noam Chomsky in 1949, the two having known each other since she was five years old and he was seven. Her mother had been a teacher at a Hebrew school where his father was the principal.[2] She was awarded a bachelor's degree in French from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951.[1]\n\nThe couple spent time living in HaZore'a,[3] a kibbutz in Israel. Although enjoying themselves, Noam Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and anti-Arab racism that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community. \"It also was way before there were even words about women's rights\" according to Judith Chomsky, wife of Noam Chomsky's younger brother.[2] Despite Carol's interest in becoming a mechanic or driving a tractor at the time of the young couple's stay in 1953,[2] they returned to the United States.\n\nShe earned a doctoral degree in linguistics from Harvard University in 1968, having attended the school in order to ensure that she would be able to make a living in the event that her husband were sent to jail for his active opposition to the Vietnam War.[1]\n\nChomsky's best-known book is The Acquisition of Syntax in Children From 5 to 10 (1969). The book investigated how children develop an understanding of the underlying grammatical structure of their native language, as well as how they use this skill to interpret sentences of increasing complexity as they get older. Despite earlier scientific beliefs that children complete their acquisition of syntax by the age of five, Chomsky's research showed that children continue to develop the skills needed to understand complex constructions beyond that age.[1]\n\nAs part of her research to understand how children develop the ability to read, she developed a method in the late 1970s called repeated reading, in which children would read a text silently while a recording of the text was played. The child would repeat the process until the text could be read fluently without the tape.[1] Research showed that four readings accompanied by a recording could be enough to provide added reading fluency for most children. More than 100 studies have been performed on the technique, with most finding statistically significant improvements in reading speed and word recognition.[4]\n\nShe served on the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Education from 1972 until 1997.[1]\n\nChomsky died of cancer on December 19, 2008, at her home in Lexington, Massachusetts. She was 78 years old.[1]"
