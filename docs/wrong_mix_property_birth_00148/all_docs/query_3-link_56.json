It is a right for all nations, not aâprerogativeâreserved to aâfew. Democracy takes different forms, and there is no one-size-fits-all model. It would be totally undemocratic to measure the diverse political systems in the world with a single yardstick or examine different political civilizations from a single perspective. The political system of a country should be independently decided by its own people. â\n\nThe United Statesâ system of democracyâis derived from its own practices. This system is unique, not universally applicable, and it is far from perfect. However, over the years, the US,âdespite theâstructural flaws and problematic practiceâof its democratic system, has claimed itself asâthe âmodel of democracyâ. It has incessantly interferedâin other countriesâ internal affairs and waged wars under the guise of âdemocracyâ, creating regional turbulence and humanitarian disasters. â\n\nBased on facts and expert opinions, this report aims to expose the deficiencies andâabuse of democracy inâthe USâas well as the harm of its exporting suchâdemocracy. It is hoped that the USâwill improve its own system and practices of democracy and change its way of interacting with other countries. This is in the interest of not only the American people, but also the people of other countries. If no countryâseeks toâdictate standards for democracy, impose its own political system on others or use democracy as a tool to suppress others, and when all countries can live and thrive in diversity, our world will be a better place.\n\nI.âWhat is democracy?\n\nDemocracy is a term that derives from the ancient Greek language. It means ârule by the peopleâ or âsovereignty of the peopleâ. As a form of government, democracy has been practiced for over 2,500 years, though in different forms, such as direct democracy of the ancient Athenianâcitizens and representative government in modern times. Democracyâis a manifestation of theâpolitical advancement of humanity.\n\nDemocracy is not an adornment or publicity stunt; rather, it is meant to beâused to solve problems faced by the people. To judge whether a country is democratic, it is important to see whether its people run their own country. In addition to voting rights, it is important to see whether people have theârights to extensive participation. It is important to see what promises are made in an electionâcampaignâand, more importantly, how many of those promises are honored afterwards. It is important to see what political procedures and rules are instituted by a countryâs systems and laws and, more importantly, whether these systems and laws are truly executed. It is important to see whether the rules and procedures governing the exercise of power are democratic and, more importantly, whether power is truly put under the oversight and checks of the people.\n\nA functional democracy must have a full set ofâinstitutional procedures; more importantly, it should have full participation of the people. It must ensure democracy in terms of both process and outcomes. It must encompass both procedural and substantive democracy, both direct and indirect democracy.âIt must ensure both peopleâs democracy and the will of the State. If the people of a country are only called upon to vote and then are forgotten once they have cast their votes; if the people only hear high-sounding promises during an election campaign but have no say whatsoever afterwards; or if they are wooed when their votes are wanted but are ignored once the election is over, then such a democracy is not a true democracy.\n\nWhether a country is democratic should be judged and determined by its own people, not by a minority of self-righteous outsiders.\n\nThere is no perfect system of democracyâin the world, nor is there a political system that fits all countries. Democracy is established and developed based on a countryâs own history and adapted to its national context, and each countryâs democracy has its unique value. Members of the international community should engage in exchanges and dialogues on democracy on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and work together to contribute to the progress of humanity.\n\nII.âThe alienation and three malaises of democracy in the US\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the development of democracyâin the USâwasâa step forward. The political party system, the representative system, one person one vote, and the separation of powers negatedâand reformed the feudal autocracy in Europe. The well-known French writerâAlexis de Tocquevilleârecognized this in his bookâDemocracy in America. The Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, abolitionist movement, civil rights movement and affirmative action were highlights in the advancement of American democracy. The principle of âgovernment of the people, by the people and for the peopleââarticulatedâby Abraham Lincoln isârecognized worldwide.\n\nHowever,âover the years, democracy in the USâhas becomeâalienated and degenerated, and it has increasingly deviated from the essenceâof democracy and its original design. Problems like money politics, identity politics, wrangling between political parties, political polarization, social division, racial tension and wealth gap have become more acute. All this has weakened the functioning of democracy in the US.\n\nThe USâhas often used democracy as a pretext to meddleâin other countriesââinternal affairs, causingâpolitical chaos and social unrest in theseâcountries, and underminingâworld peace and stability and social tranquility in other countries. This makes many people in the USâand other countries wonder if the USâis still a democracy.âThe world needs toâtake a closer look atâtheâcurrent state ofâdemocracyâin the US, and the USâitself should also conductâsome soul-searching.\n\n1.âThe system fraught with deep-seated problems\n\nThe USâcalls itselfââcity upon a hillââand a âbeacon ofâdemocracyâ; and it claims that its political system was designed to defend democracy and freedom at the time of itsâfounding. Yet, the vision of democracy has lost its shine in the USâtoday. The self-styled American democracy is now gravelyâillâwith moneyâpolitics, elite rule, political polarization and a dysfunctional system.\n\n(1) American-style democracy has become âa game of money politicsâ\n\nThe American-style democracy is a rich menâs game based on capital, andâis fundamentally different from democracy of the people.\n\nOver a hundred years ago, Republican Senator from Ohio Mark Hannaâsaid ofâAmerican politics: âThere are two things that are important in politics. The first is money, and I canât remember the second.ââMore than one hundred years have passed, and money has not only remained âthe currencyââin US politics, but also become even more indispensable. For example, the 2020 presidential election and Congressional elections cost some US$14 billion, two times that of 2016 and three times that of 2008;âindeed, they are known as the most expensive elections in American history. The cost of the presidential election reached another record high of US$6.6 billion, and the Congressional elections cost over US$7 billion.\n\nThe fact that the American peopleâhave toâface is that moneyâpolitics has penetrated the entireâprocess of election, legislation and administration. People in fact only have a restrictedâright to political participation. The inequality in economic status has been turned into inequality in political status. Only people with enough capital can enjoy theirâdemocratic rights provided by the Constitution. Moneyâpolitics have increasingly become an âirremovable tumorââin American societyâand a mockery ofâdemocracyâin the US.\n\nA US Senator had a sharp observation,ââCongress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress.ââAccording to statistics, winners of 91% of US Congressional elections are the candidates with greater financialâsupport. Big companies, a small group of rich people, and interest groups are generous with their support and have become the main source of electoralâfunding. And thoseâso-called representatives of the people, once elected, often serve the interests of their financial backers. They speak for vested interests rather than the ordinary people. â\n\nIn March 2020, Robert Reich, Professor of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley and former Secretary of Labor, published a book entitled The System, Who Rigged It, How We Fix It. According to him, the American political system has been hijacked by a tiny minorityâover the past four decades. Political donations are almost seen as âlegitimate briberyâ. They enable the rich to have more political clout. During the 2018 midterm elections, the huge political donations, mostly coming from the top 0.01% ultra-rich of the American population, accounted for over 40% of campaign finance. Money politics and lobby groups are restricting channels for ordinary Americans to speak out, whose voices expressing genuine concerns are overshadowed by a handful of interest groups. The oligarchs would enrich themselves with the power they have got while totally ignoring the interests of ordinary Americans.\n\nOn 23 September 2020, in an interview with Harvard Law Today, Harvard Law School Professor Matthew Stephenson said that the US is by no means the world leader in clean government, and certain practices related to lobbying and campaign finance that other countries would consider corrupt are not only permitted but constitutionally protected in the US.\n\n(2)âââOne person one voteâ in name, ârule of the minority eliteâ in reality\n\nThe US is a typical country dominated by an elite class. Political pluralism is only a facade. A small number of elites dominate the political, economic and military affairs. They control the state apparatus and policy-making process, manipulate public opinion, dominate the business community and enjoy all kinds of privileges. Since the 1960s in particular, the Democrats and Republicans have taken turns to exercise power, making the âmultiparty systemâ dead in all but name. For ordinary voters, casting their votes to a third party or an independent candidate is nothing more than wasting the ballot. In effect, they can only choose either the Democratic candidate or the Republican one.\n\nIn the context of Democratic-Republican rivalry, the general publicâs participation in politics is restricted to a very narrow scope. For ordinary voters, they are only called upon to vote and are forgotten once they have cast their ballots. Most people are just âwalk-onsâ in the theater of election. This makes âgovernment by the peopleâ hardly possible in US political practice.\n\nNoam Chomsky, a political commentator and social activist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out that the USâis a âreally existing capitalist democracyâ, where there is a positive correlation between peopleâs wealth and their influence on policy-making. For the lower 70% on the wealth/income scale, they have no influence on policy whatsoever. They are effectively disenfranchised.\n\nRay La Raja, Professor atâthe University of Massachusetts,ânotes in an article forâThe Atlanticâthat Americaâs current system is democratic only in form, not in substance. Theânominating processâis vulnerable to manipulation by plutocrats, celebrities, media figures and activists. Many presidentialâprimary voters mistakenly back candidates who do not reflect their views.\n\n(3) The checks and balances have resulted in a âvetocracyâ\n\nAmerican political scientist Francis Fukuyama points out in his book Political Order and Political Decayâthat there is an entrenched political paralysis in the US. The US political system has far too many checks and balances,âraising the cost of collective action and in some cases making it impossible altogether. Fukuyama calls the system a âvetocracyâ. Since the 1980s, the âvetocracyââof the USâhas become a formula for gridlock.\n\nTheâUS democratic process is fragmented and lengthy, with a lot of veto points where individual veto players can block action by the whole body. The function of âchecks and balancesâ, which was purportedly designed to prevent abuse of power, has beenâdistorted in American political practice. Political polarization continues to growâas the two parties drift further apart inâpolitical agenda andâtheirâareas of consensus have reduced significantly. An extreme case is the fact that âthe most liberal Republican now remains significantly to the right of the most conservative Democratâ. Antagonism and mutual inhibition have become commonplace, âvetocracyââhas defined Americanâpolitical culture, and a vindictive âif I canât, you canât eitherââmentality has grown prevalent.\n\nPoliticians in Washington, D.C.âare preoccupied with securing their own partisan interestsâand donât care at all about national development. Vetoing makes one identify more strongly with their peers in the same camp, who mayâin turn giveâthem greaterâand quickerâsupport. Consequently the two parties are caught in a vicious circle, addicted to vetoing. Worse still, theâgovernment efficacy is inevitably weakened, law and justice trampled upon, development and progress stalled, and social division widened. In the US today, people are increasingly identifying themselves as a Republican or a Democrat instead of as an American. The negative impacts of identity politics and tribal politics have also spilled over into other sectors of American society, further exacerbating âvetocracyâ.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center report in October 2021âbased on a survey of 17 advanced economies (including the US, Germany and the Republic of Korea), the USâis moreâpolitically divided than the otherâeconomies surveyed. Nineâinâten US respondents believe there are conflicts between people who support different political parties, and nearly 60% of Americans surveyedâthinkâtheirâfellow citizens no longer disagree simply over policies, but also over basic facts. â\n\nJungkun Seo, Professor of Political Scienceâat Kyung Hee University, observes that asâpolitical polarizationâintensifiesâin the US, the self-cleaning process of American democracy, whichâaims to driveâreform through elections, will no longerâbe able to functionâproperly. With theâSenate trappedâin aâfilibuster, the US Congress no longer serves as a representative body for addressing changesâin American society throughâlegislation.\n\n(4) The flawed electoral rules impair fairness and justice\n\nThe US presidential election follows the time-honored Electoral College system, where the president and vice president are not elected directly by popular vote, but by the Electoral College consisting of 538âelectors. The candidate whoâachievesâa majority of 270 or more electoral votes wins the election.\n\nThe flaws of such an electoral system are self-evident. First, as the president-elect may notâbe theâwinner ofâthe national popular vote, there is a lack of broaderârepresentation. Second, as each state gets to decide its own electoral rules, this may create confusion and disorder. Third, the winner-takes-all system exacerbatesâinequality among states and betweenâpolitical parties. Itâleads to a huge waste of votes and discourages voter turnout. Voters in âdeep blueââand âdeep redââstates are oftenâneglected, while swing states becomeâdisproportionately moreâimportant where both parties seek to woo more supporters.\n\nThere have been five presidential electionsâin US history in which the winners of nationwideâpopular vote were not elected the president. The most recent case was the 2016âpresidential election in whichâRepublican candidate Donald Trump won 62.98 millionâpopular votes or 45.9% ofâthe total, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton wonâ65.85 million or 48% of popular votes. Although Trump lost the popular vote, he won 304 electoral votes while Clinton securedâonly 227, which gave Trumpâhis presidency.\n\nAnother flaw of the electoral system widely acknowledged by the US public is gerrymandering. In 1812, Governorâof Massachusetts Elbridge Gerry signed a bill in the interest of his own party, creating in hisâstate anâodd-shaped electoral districtâthat was compared to aâsalamander. Such practiceâwas later called gerrymandering, which refers to an unfair division ofâelectoral districtsâin favor ofâa particularâparty to win as many seats as possible and cement its advantage.\n\nThe USâconductsâa census every ten years. Following the completion of the census, redistricting or the redrawing of electoral district boundaries will take place underâthe principle of maintaining roughly equal population in every voting districtâwhile considering demographicâshifts. Under theâUS Constitution, eachâstate legislature has the power to redistrict. This leaves room for the majority party in state legislatures to manipulate the redrawing of electoral districts. Two principalâtactics areâoftenâused in gerrymandering. One is âpackingâ, i.e. concentrating the oppositionâpartyâs voters in a few districts, thus giving up these districts to secure the others. The other is âcrackingâ, i.e. splitting up areas where the oppositionâpartyâs supporters are concentrated and incorporating them into neighboring districts, thus diluting votes for the opposition party.\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Democratic-governed state of Oregon became the first in the country to complete redistricting. Electoral districts firmly in the hands of the Democratic Party have increased from two to four, and swing districts reduced from two to one.âThis means that the Democratic Party can control 83% of the stateâs congressional districts with 57% of voters. On the contrary, the Republican-controlled state of Texas, with new electoral district boundaries determinedâon 25 October 2021, has seen districts held by Republicans grow from 22 to 24 and swing districts shrink from six to one. The Republican Party now occupiesâ65% of state House seats with just 52.1% of voters.\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll in August 2021, just 16% of US adultâcitizensâsayâthey thinkâtheir statesââcongressional maps would be drawn fairly, while 44% sayâthey think the maps would be drawn unfairly and another 40% of adults sayâtheyâareâunsure if the maps will be fair. As US politics growsâmore polarized, bothâthe Republican and Democratic parties are seeking to maximize their own interests, and gerrymandering becomes the best approach.\n\nTheâsuperdelegate system of the Democratic Party is also an impediment to fair election. The superdelegates include major Democratic leaders, members of the Democratic National Committee, Democratic members of Congress, and incumbent Democratic governors, and are seated automatically.âThe superdelegates may support any candidate they choose or follow the will of the Party leadershipâwithout giving any consideration to theâwishes of the general public.\n\nThe late political analyst Mark Plotkin wrote on The Hill that the âDemocratsââsuperdelegate system is unfair and undemocraticâ, and âthe process of eliminating this elitist exercise should immediately beginâ.\n\n(5) Dysfunctionalâdemocracyâtriggersâtrust crisis\n\nThe American-styleâdemocracy isâmoreâlike a meticulously set up scene in Hollywood moviesâwhereâa bunch of well-heeled characters publicly pledge commitment to the people, but actually busy themselves with behind-the-scene deals. Political infighting, money politics, and vetocracy make it virtually impossible for quality governance to be delivered as desired by the general public. Americans are increasingly disillusioned with US politics and pessimistic about the American-styleâdemocracy.\n\nA Gallup survey in October 2020 shows that only 19% of the Americans surveyed are âvery confidentâ about the presidential election, a record low since the survey was first conducted in 2004.\n\nIn November 2020, an online Wall Street Journal report argues that the 2020 general election can be seen as the culmination of a two-decade decline inâfaith in democracy in the US.\n\nAccording to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, only 16% of Americans say democracy is working well or extremely well; 45% think democracy isnât functioning properly, while another 38% say itâs working only somewhat well. A Pew Research Center survey finds that just 20% of Americans say they trust the federal government just about always or most of the time.\n\nA Brookings online article in May 2021 indicates that the certification of the 2020 election results by all 50 states still leaves 77% of Republicanâvotersâquestioning the legitimacy of President Bidenâs election victory due to allegations of voter fraud. This is the first time such things happen since the 1930s.\n\nA CNN poll in September reveals that 56% of Americans think democracy in the US is under attack; 52% reply they are just a little or not at all confident that elections reflect the will of the people; 51% say itâs likely that elected officials in the next few years will overturn the results of an election their party did not win.\n\nA 2021 Pew survey conducted among 16,000 adults in 16 advanced economiesâand 2,500 adults in the US shows that 57% of international respondents and 72% of Americans believe that democracy in the US has not been a good example for others to follow in recent years.\n\n2.Messy and chaotic practices of democracy\n\nThatâdemocracy in the US has gone wrong is reflectedânot only in its systemâdesignâandâgeneral structure, but also in the way it is put into practice. The USâis not a straight A student when it comes toâdemocracy, still less a role model for democracy. The gunshots and farce on Capitol Hill haveâcompletely revealed what is underneath theâgorgeous appearance of the American-styleâdemocracy. The death of Black American George Floyd has laid bare theâsystemic racism that exists in Americanâsociety for too long, and spurred a deluge of protests rippling throughout the country and even the whole world.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic remains out of controlâin the US, the issue of mask-wearing and vaccination hasâtriggered furtherâsocial division and confrontation. Dividends of economic growthâare distributed unfairly, and income growth has stalled for mostâordinary peopleâforâa long period of time. The American-styleâdemocracyâcan hardlyâuphold public order and ethics, nor advanceâpublic well-beingâto the fullest.\n\n(1) The Capitol riot that shocks the world\n\nOn the afternoon of 6 January 2021, thousands of Americansâgathered on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C. and stormed the Capitol building in a bid to stopâthe joint session of the Congress fromâcertifyingâthe newly-elected president. The incident interrupted the transfer of US presidential power, leaving five dead and over 140 injured. It is the worst act of violenceâin Washington, D.C. since 1814 when the British troops set fire to the White House, and itâisâthe first time in more than 200 years that the Capitol was invaded. Senate Republican leader described it as a âfailed insurrectionâ. A scholar fromâthe US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)âexclaims thatâthe US is not nearly as unique as many Americans believe, and that the Capitol riot should put an end to the notion of American exceptionalism, of an eternal shining city on a hill.\n\nThe assault on the Capitolâhas undermined the three major bedrocks ofâthe American-styleâdemocracy.\n\nFirst, âdemocracyâ in the US is not democraticâas it claims. The refusal of some US politiciansâto recognize the election results andâtheir supportersâ subsequent violent storming of the Capitol building have severely undercut the credibility of democracy in the US.\n\nSecond, âfreedomâ in the USâis not free as it claims.âTwitter, Facebook and other social media platformsâsuspended theâpersonal accounts of some US politicians, a de facto announcement of their âdeath on social mediaâ. This hasâbust the myths of âfreedom of speechââin the US.\n\nThird, the ârule of lawââin the US is notâbound by the law as it claims. The totally different attitudesâtaken by US law enforcement agencies toward the âBlack Lives Matterââ(BLM) protestsâand the Capitol riot are yet another reminder of the double standards in the US ârule of lawâ.\n\nThe assault on the Capitol sent shock waves throughoutâthe international community. While deploringâthe violence, many people also expressed disappointmentâat the US.\n\nBritishâPrime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that what happened in the US Capitol were âdisgraceful scenesâ.â\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that âin one of the worldâs oldest democracies ... a universal ideaâââthat of âone person, one voteâââ is undermined.ââ\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa commentedâthat it âshook the foundationsââof democracy in the US.\n\nFormer Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono tweeted that the political farce in the US offers much food for thought, and that there is no perfect democracy, especially when it comes to its practices. â\n\n(2) Entrenched racism\n\nRacism is an indelible blotâon democracy in the US. While advocating âall men are created equalâ, the founding fathers of the US left the institution of slavery untouched in the Constitutionâof 1789. Today, although racial segregation has been ostensibly abolished in the US, white supremacy is still rife and rampant across the country. Discrimination against Black Americans and other racial minorities remains a systemic phenomenon.\n\nAmerican society has experienced relapses of its malaise of racial discrimination from time to time. On 25 May 2020, George Floyd, a BlackâAmerican, lost his life in Minnesota because of law enforcement violence by the police. âI canât breatheââââFloydâs desperate plea for life before his deathâââsparked public outrage. Afterwards, protests and demonstrations erupted in about 100 cities across the 50 states of America, demanding justice for Floyd and protesting against racial discrimination. The demonstrations continued more than 100 days after the incident.\n\nWhat happened to George Floyd is merely an epitome of the tragic plight of Black Americans over the past centuries. Sandra Shullman, Past President ofâthe American Psychological Association,âsays thatâAmerica is in âa racism pandemicâ. The dream of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. remains unrealized.âAccording to an editorial ofâThe Indian Express, a mainstream newspaper of India, American racism has endured, subverting the countryâs deepest democratic institutions in the process.\n\nIn February 2021, Stanford News, a website of Stanford University,âcarriedâan article examining systemic racism in the US. The articleâsuggestsâthat in education, youth of color are more likely to be closely watched; in the criminal justice system, people of color, particularly Black men, are disproportionately targeted; and in the economy and employment, from who moves forward in the hiring process to who receives funding from venture capitalists, BlackâAmericans and other minority groups are discriminated against in the workplace and economy-at-large. A study by the University of Washington findsâthat around 30,800 people died from police violence between 1980 and 2018 in the US, which is about 17,100 higher than the official figure. It also indicatesâthat African Americans are 3.5 times more likely to be killed by police violence than white Americans.\n\nThe anger erupting across America is not just Black anger, but across racial lines. An article published on the website of The Jerusalem Postâof Israel notesâthat American Jews are concerned about right-wing antisemitism and violence driven by white supremacist groups. According to annual surveys conducted by the American Jewish Committee, in 2020, 43% US Jews feel less secure than a year ago, and in 2017, 41% say antisemitism is a serious problem in the US, up from 21% in 2016, 21% in 2015, and 14% in 2013.\n\nThe bullying ofâAmericans of Asian descentâis increasing in the US. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there have been growingâcases of Asian Americans humiliated or attacked in public places. Statistics from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation indicateâthat hate crimes against people of Asian descent rose by 76%âin the USâin 2020. From March 2020 to June 2021, the organization Stop Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Hate received over 9,000 incident reports.âA survey of young Asian Americansâonâthe National Broadcasting Companyâ(NBC)âwebsite showsâthat in the past year, a quarter of young Asian Americans became targets of racial bullying, nearly half of the respondents expressed pessimism about their situation, and a quarter of the respondents expressed fear about the situation of themselves and their families.\n\n(3)âTragic mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nWith the bestâhealth and medical resources in the worldâas it claims, the USâhas beenâa total mess when it comes to COVID response.âItâhas the worldâs highest numbersâof infections and deaths.\n\nAccording to figures released byâJohns Hopkins University, as of the end ofâNovember 2021, confirmed COVID-19âcases in the US had exceeded 48âmillion, and the number of deaths had surpassedâ770,000,âboth the highestâin the world.\n\nOn 8 January this year, 300,777 new confirmed casesâwere reported, a record single-day increase sinceâtheâCOVID-19 outbreak in the US. On 13 Januaryâalone, 4,170 Americans died of COVID-19, far exceedingâtheâdeath toll of theâ9/11âterrorist attacks.\n\nAt the end of November, theâaverage daily increase of confirmedâcases in the US had climbedâto overâ70,000, and daily death tollâto over 700.\n\nOne in every 500 Americans have died of COVID-19. Up to now,âCOVID-19âdeathsâin the US haveâsurpassed its total death toll fromâthe 1919 Influenza Pandemic, and itsâcombined deaths in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIf the USâhad taken a science-based response, a lot more lives could have been saved. The pandemic, as epidemiologist and former head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention William Foege put it, isâaââslaughterâ.\n\nThe pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the USâeconomy. The rate and scale of business shutdown and unemployment in the country are beyond imagination, leaving a large number of Americans jobless. Peopleâsâanxiety and sense of powerlessness has been exacerbated by growing factors of social instability.\n\nThe COVID Hardship Watch released by the US Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on 29 July 2021 suggests that while there have been improvements over the situation in December 2020, hardship is widespread for Americans in the first half of 2021. Some 20 million adults live in households that have not got enough to eat, 11.40 million adult renters are behind on rent, facing the risk of being evicted.\n\nAs indicated in the statistics released byâthe US Census Bureau, by 5 July 2021, at least one member in 22% of all households with underage dependents had lost their source of income.\n\nUS consumer confidence has dropped substantially, and progress in job market recovery has stalled. Institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Oxford Economics have significantly revised down growth forecasts for the US economy. At the same time, the pandemic, coupled withâthree rounds of massive economic stimulus plans, among other factors, has caused port congestion and supply shortages, pushing inflation higher. In October of this year, US CPI surged by 6.2% from a year earlier, marking a year-on-year rise of no less thanâ5% for six consecutive months, and a record high since 2008.\n\nThe root cause of the continued spread of the coronavirusâin the USâis not a dearth of science,âbut the refusal to trustâand rely on science. For the sake of elections, some politicians have prioritizedâpartisanâinterests over national interests, politicizedâpandemic response, and focused on shifting blames on others. The federal and state governments have failed toâgalvanize a concerted response to the pandemic, and are mired in infighting instead. As a result,âpandemic response measures have been severely politicized. The choices with regard to vaccination and mask-wearing have become a bone of contention betweenâtheâparties and among the people. There appears a growingâtrend ofâanti-intellectualism.\n\nA report by the French newspaper Le Mondeâobservesâthat the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the fragility of democracyâin the US. The extremely expensive health system, reserved for the rich and leaving the poorest without social security, has made this country, yet one of the most developed in the world, fall behind due to social injustice. This is a typical case of a democratic drift that makes it impossible to effectively manage a crisis.\n\nStanford News notesâthat, in the area of public health,âthe COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted communities of color and has highlighted the health disparities between Black Americans, whites and other demographic groups.\n\n(4) Widening wealth gap\n\nThe USâis moreâpolarizedâthan any other Westernâcountryâinâterms of wealth distribution. Its Gini coefficient hasâincreased to 0.48 in 2021, almost theâhighest in 50 years. As revealed by reportsâofâtheâInstitute for Policy Studies, a USâthink tank, the combined wealth of US billionaires soaredâ19-fold between 1990 and 2021, while over this same period, USâmedian wealthâonly increased 5.37%.âTheâharsh reality in the US is the rich is becoming richer, and the poor poorer. â\n\nAccording to Fedâs October 2021 statistics, the middle 60% of US households by income, defined as the âmiddle classâ, saw their combined assets drop to 26.6% of national wealth as of June this year, the lowest in three decades, while the first 1% had a 27% share, surpassing the âmiddle classâ.\n\nA report by UC Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez shows that in terms of average annual income, Americaâsâtop 10% rich earn over nine times as much as the bottom 90%; theâwealthiestâ1% are about 40 times moreâthan the bottom 90%;âand the ultra-wealthy top 0.1% are 196 times of the bottom 90%.\n\nThe stimulus policy that the US has introducedâin response to COVID-19 has, while pushing up stock markets, further widened the gap between the rich and the poor. The wealth of US billionaires has grown US$1.763 trillion, or 59.8%, over the 16 months since the COVID outbreak in the US. The wealthiest 10% now own 89% of all US stocks, registering a new historic high.\n\nThe wealth polarization in the USâis inherent to its own political system and the interests of the capital that its government represents. From the âOccupy Wall Streetââmovement, to the recent âHarambe stares down Wall Streetâs Charging Bullâ, the American people have never stopped condemning theâwideningâwealth gap. Yet, nothing has changed. Those governing the US choose to do nothing about the growing wealth inequality. And the pandemic has further exposed a rule in American society ââcapital first and the rich first.\n\n(5) âFreedom of speechâ in name only\n\nIn the US, the mediaâisâjuxtaposed with the executive, the legislative and the judiciary as the âfourth branch of governmentâ and journalists are consideredââuncrowned kingsâ. Though US media organizations claimâto beâindependent from politics and serve freedom and truth, theyâare actually serving financial interestsâand party politics.\n\nAâfew media conglomeratesâmaintain control of the US newsâmediaâand haveâmorphedâintoâaâpolitical force with outsize influence.\n\nUnder the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the federal government is requiredâto relax regulation over the ownership of mediaâoutlets. This has led toâan unprecedented wave of mergersâandâa crippling erosion of the diversity and independence of the US media. The drasticâreduction in the number of media outlets hasâenabled a few companies to expand into monopolies.\n\nIn the US, a few media conglomerates areânowâin control of over 90% of media outlets, nettingâthem an annual profit even higher than the gross domestic product (GDP) of some developing countries.\n\nThese media behemoths, while eager to make moreâbusiness footprints, have extendedâtheir reachâinto American politics, attempting to sway political processes through lobbying, public relations campaign or political donations. â\n\nTheâUSâmediaâmonopoliesâhaveâbecome âinvisible killersââof civil and political rights.\n\nRobert McChesney, a leading US scholarâinâthe studies of political economy of communications andâprofessor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, notesâin his book Rich Media, Poor Democracyâthat media companies, profit-driven by nature, confine people to the world of entertainmentâprograms, depriving their access to diversified information, distracting their interest in public affairs,âdiminishing their ability toâdistinguish between right andâwrong,âand muting their voice in the decision-making of social policies.âIn an American society dominated by media narratives, traditional notions of civic and political involvement have shriveled. Depoliticization has turned democracy into a political game without citizens.\n\nA report in Miamiâs New Heraldâarguesâthatâasâthe media is controlled byâtheâelite and conglomerates, people are not able to distinguish between factsâandâpolitical propaganda.ââââ\n\nThe US mediaâis no longerâa âgatekeeperâ of democracy. Theâpolitical wranglingâbetween the Leftâand Right in the US mediaâhas furtherâentrenched the estrangement and division between theâtwoâparties and between the elite and the mass public.âIt has aggravatedâpolitical polarizationâin the US, pushing the political Left further left and the Right further right. And it has fueled the spread of extremist ideologiesâandâpopulism in the US.\n\nAccording to a study byâSejong Institute, a think tank in the Republic of Korea, over 80% of conservative voters in the US see newsâreports by mainstream media outlets, such as New York Times,âas false information and have a biased trust in media.âVoters believeâin only a few mediaâoutlets and would ignore communications at the nationalâlevel. Levelheadedâdiscussions and consensus-building have been replaced by megaphone politics and negative partisan strife.\n\nThe Digital News Reportâ2021âissuedâby the University of Oxford and Reuters Institute indicates thatâamong 92,000 online news consumersâsurveyed in 46 markets, those in the US have the lowest level of trust inânews, a mereâ29%. â\n\nIn the information age whenâtraditional media is on the decline, social media has become a newâfavoriteâfor the general public. Yet,âlike traditional media, social mediaâis also under the control of big capital and interest groups. To increase their website traffic, social media sites use algorithms to create âinformation cocoonsâ, leaving extreme content unchecked and uncontrolled. This drives users toward self-reinforcing their existing views, exacerbates identity politics, and further divides public opinion.\n\nIn October 2021, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen leaked tens of thousands of pages of explosive internal documents of Facebook. She disclosed to Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) that Facebook would not hesitate to sacrifice public interests to keep users on its platform and make profits. Facebook has become a main platform for social extremists and is fraught with hate speech, disinformation and misinformation. Action is only taken onâ3-5% of hate and about 0.6% of violence and incitement on the platform.\n\n3.âDisastrous consequences of US export of its brand of democracy\n\nWithout regard to huge differences in the level of economic development and in the historical and cultural backgrounds of countries around the world, the US seeks to impose its own political system and values on other nations. It pushes for what it calls âdemocratic transitionâ, and instigates âcolor revolutionâ.\n\nIt wantonly interferes in other countriesâ internal affairs and even subverts their governments, bringing about disastrous consequences for those countries. In other words, the US has attempted to model other countries after its own image and export its brand of democracy. Such attempts are entirely undemocratic and at odds with the core values and tenets of democracy. Without producing the expected chemistry, the American-styleâdemocracyâhas turned out to be a âfailed transplantâ that plunges many regions and countries into turmoil, conflicts and wars.\n\n(1)âThe âcolor revolutionsâ undermine regional and national stabilityâ\n\nThe US hasâa habit of interfering in other countriesâ internal affairs in the name of âdemocracyâ and seeking regime change to install pro-USâgovernments.\n\nA former senior CIA officialâonceâtalked about making people âwhat we want them to beââand âfollow our directionsâ, and the possibility of confusing peopleâs minds, changing their values, and making them believe in the new values before they know it.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Michael Pompeo openly admitted âI was the CIA director. We lied, we cheated, we stole. We had entire training courses. It reminds you of the glory of the American experiment.â\n\nThe USâhas developed a systemâof strategies and tactics for âpeaceful evolutionâ. It would start with âcultural exchangesâ, economic assistance, and then public opinion shapingâto foster anâatmosphere for âcolor revolutionâ. It wouldâexaggerate the mistakes and flawsâof incumbent governmentsâto foment publicâgrievances and anti-government sentiments.\n\nIn the meantime, it would brainwash local people with American values and make them identify with Americaâsâeconomic model and political system. It would also cultivateâpro-US NGOs and provide all-round training to opposition leaders. It wouldâseize the opportunity ofâmajorâelections or emergenciesâto overthrowâtargetedâgovernments throughâinstigating street political activities.\n\nIn recent history, the US has pushed for the neo-Monroe Doctrine in Latin Americaâunder the pretext of âpromoting democracyâ, incitedââcolor revolutionââin Eurasia, and remotely controlledâthe âArab Springââin West Asia and North Africa. Theseâmoves haveâbrought chaos and disasters to many countries,âgravely undermining world peace, stability and development.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, people have long been under no illusion aboutââthe American-style democracyâ. Any attempt of the US to promote its self-styled âmodel of democracyâ would be only self-defeating and self-humiliating.\n\nIn 1823, the US issuedâthe Monroe Doctrine, declaringââAmerica for the Americansâ and advocating âPan-Americanismâ.\n\nIn the following decades,âthe US, under the excuse of âspreading democracyâ, repeatedly carried out political interference, military intervention, and government subversion in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe US pursued a policy of hostility towardâsocialist Cubaâandâimposed blockade againstâthe country for nearly 60 years, and subverted the government of Chile under Salvador Allende.âThese were blatant acts ofâhegemonism. âMy way or no way.â Thatâs the US logic.â\n\nSince 2003, Eastern Europe and Central Asia have seen the âRose Revolutionâ in Georgia, the âOrange Revolutionâ in Ukraine, and the âTulip Revolutionâ in Kyrgyzstan. The US State Department openly admitted playing a âcentral roleâ in these âregime changesâ.\n\nIn October 2020, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service revealed that the US planned to instigate âcolor revolutionââin Moldova.\n\nThe âArab Springâ that started inâ2010 was an earthquake that shook the entire Middle East. The US orchestrated the show behind the scene, and played a key role. The New York Times revealed in 2011 that a small core of American government-financed organizations were promoting democracy in âauthoritarianâ Arab states. A number of the groups and individuals directly involved in the âArab Springâ revolts received training and financing from US organizations like the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute and Freedom House.\n\nMustafa Ahmady, an African and international affairs specialist in Ethiopia, contributed an article to Ahram Online entitled âPromised Landsâ, explaining that it was largely due to Obamaâs famous statement âNow means nowâ that furious Egyptian protesters overthrewâMubarak, and that they paid a heavy price as a result of the political change.\n\nSeeing what the US had done, the Arab people have come to realize that the US wants to force a stereotyped model of democracy on them regardless of their own will.\n\nIn countries forced to copy and paste American values, there is no sign of true democracy, true freedom, or true human rights. What have been left in these countries are prevailing scenes of persisting chaos, stagnation and humanitarian disasters.\n\nThe US export of its values has disrupted the normal development process in the recipient countries, hindered their search for a development path and model befitting their national conditions, brought political, economic and social turmoils, and destroyed, one after another, what used to be other peoplesâ beautiful homelands.âTheâturmoils, in turn, have given rise to terrorism and other long-term challenges that threaten and jeopardize regional and even global security.\n\nAs suggested by the French website Le Grand Soir, democracy has long become a weapon of massive destruction for the US to attack countries with different views.\n\nThe US applies different standards in assessing democracy of its own and other countries. It praises or belittles others entirely according to its own likes or dislikes. Following the Capitol attack on 6 January 2021, an American politician compared the incident of violence to the 9/11 terror attack, calling it a âshameful assaultââon the US Congress, constitution and democracy. It is ironic that in June 2019 the same politician called the violent demonstrations at the Hong Kong Legislative Council building as a âbeautiful sight to beholdââand commended the rioters for their âcourageâ. What a blatant double standard.\n\n(2)âThe US imposition of its brand of democracy causes humanitarian tragediesâ\n\nThe US export of its brand of democracy by force hasâled to humanitarian disasters in manyâcountries. Theâ20-yearâUS war in Afghanistanâhasâleft the country devastated and impoverished. Aâtotal of 47,245 Afghan civilians andâ66,000 to 69,000 Afghan soldiers and police who had nothing to do with 9/11 attacks were killed in US military operations, and more than 10 million people were displaced. The war destroyedâthe foundation for Afghanistanâs economic development and reducedâAfghansâtoâdestitution.\n\nIn 2003, the USâlaunched military strikes against Iraq for its alleged possession ofâweapons of mass destruction. The civilian death toll of theâIraq warâis betweenâ200,000 andâ250,000, including over 16,000 directly killed by the US military. More than aâmillion people lost their homes.âMoreover,âthe US troopsâseriously violated international humanitarian principles, as evidenced by the frequent incidence of prisoner abuse. Until now theâUS has not been able to produce any credible proof of Iraqâs possession of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAccording toârecordsâavailable, 33,584 civilians were killedâin war and conflict in Syria betweenâ2016 andâ2019. Among the victims, 3,833 were directly killed inâbombings byâthe US-led coalition and half of them were women and children. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) reported on 9 November 2018 that theââmost accurate air strike in historyâ launched by US forces on Raqqa alone killed 1,600 Syrian civilians.\n\nIn 2018, the USâlaunchedâairstrikes on Syria again for the purpose of, what they called,âpreventing the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. Butâthe âevidenceââof the alleged use of chemical weaponsâby the Syrian governmentâturned out to be a fake videoâfootage directed and producedâby the White Helmets, an organization funded by intelligence agencies of the US and other countries.\n\n(3)âThe abuse of sanctions breaches international rules\n\nUnilateral sanction isâaââbig stickâ the US wields in dealing with other countries. Over many years, the USâhas exercisedâits financial hegemony andâabused itsâtechnological clout to carry out frequent, unilateralâbullyingâagainst other countries.\n\nThe US has enacted some draconian laws, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, and the Countering Americaâs Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, andâissued aâseries of executive ordersâto target and sanction specific countries, entitiesâor individuals.\n\nTheâambiguous rulesâcontained in these acts and executive orders,âsuch as the âminimum contacts principleâ and âdoctrine of effectsâ,âare in fact a willfulâexpansion ofâthe jurisdiction ofâUSâdomestic laws.\n\nThese acts and executive orders make it possible for the US to abuse itsâdomesticâchannels for prosecutionâand exercise âlong-arm jurisdictionâ over entities and individuals in other countries. The two most prominent examples are theâcase of French company Alstom and thatâof Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.\n\nStatistics show that the Trump administration had imposed over 3,900 sanction measures, which meansâthe USâwielded its âbig stickâ three times a dayâon average. As of fiscal year 2021, the entities and individuals on USâsanction listsâtoppedâ9,421,â933% higher compared to fiscal yearâ2000.\n\nThe US unwarrantedâunilateral sanctions and âlong-arm jurisdictionâ have gravely undermined the sovereignty and security of other countries, severely impactingâtheir economic development and peopleâs wellbeing. The sanctions and âlong-arm jurisdictionââconstitute a gross violation ofâinternational law and basic norms of international relations.\n\nThe US sanctions against other countries have continued unabated into 2021.\n\nThe US administration, in collaboration with its European allies, have ramped up containment and suppression against Russia, imposed blanket sanctions allegedly in response to the Navalny incident and alleged Russian cyber attacks and interference in US elections, among others, and launched a diplomatic war by the expulsion of Russian diplomats.\n\nWith regard to issues such as the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project and theâdigital service tax, the US hasânot hesitated to sanctionâeven its European allies.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the China-US phase one trade agreement, the US has taken further measures to suppress and contain China. It has placed over 940 Chinese entities and individuals on its restricted lists. According to statistics fromâthe Office of Foreign Assets Controlâ(OFAC)âof the US Department of the Treasury, as ofâ19 Octoberâ2021, a total of 391 entities and individualsâfrom Chinaâ(including Hong Kong and Macao)âhave been sanctioned by the US.\n\nIn an article published in the September/October 2021 issue of Foreign Affairs, Daniel Drezner, Professor at Tufts University and Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, criticizesâsuccessive US administrations for using âsanctions as the go-to solution for nearly every foreign policy problem.â He notes that sanctionsânot only are ineffective, but also âexert a humanitarian tollâ, and thatâthe United States of America has become the âUnited States of Sanctionsâ.\n\nUS unilateral sanctions are a continuous, grave violation ofâhuman rights of Americans and other peoples. The worst example is the protractedâUSâblockade against Cuba.\n\nFor more than 60 years, inâtotal disregard of the many resolutions of the UN General Assembly, the US hasâcontinuedâitsâcomprehensive blockade against Cuba based on its embargo policies and domestic laws such as theâTorricelli Actâand theâHelms-Burton Act.\n\nThe Cuba blockade is the longest and cruelestâsystemic trade embargo, economic blockadeâand financial sanctions in modern history. The blockade has been gravely detrimentalâto Cubaâs economic and social development, causing US$100 billionâdirect losses to Cubaâs economy.\n\nUS blockade and sanctions against Iran began inâlate 1970s. Over the past 40-plus years, US unilateral sanctions have increasedâinâbothâintensity and frequency.âThey have gradually evolved into a rigorous sanction regimeâthat coversâfinance, tradeâand energy,âand areâtargeted at bothâentitiesâand individuals. The purpose is to intensifyâpressure on Iran from allâdimensions.\n\nIn May 2018, the US government announced its unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and soon after resumed and expandedâsanctions against Iran. Many countries and relevant entities have beenâforced to give up their cooperation with Iran. A large number of foreign oil enterprises left the country. Iranâsâmanufacturing industry has been unable toâkeep upânormal operations. The country has sufferedâeconomic slowdown, coupled with heightened inflationâand massive currency depreciation.\n\nThe USâhas imposed sanctions onâBelarus, SyriaâandâZimbabwe,âamong others,âover the years, and ratcheted upââmaximum pressureâ againstâthe DPRK, Venezuela, etc.\n\n(4) The âbeacon of democracyâ draws global criticism\n\nThe people of the worldâhave aâdiscerning eye. They see very well the flaws and deficiencies ofâdemocracyâin the US,âhypocrisyâin exporting USââdemocratic valuesâ, and USâacts of bullyingâand hegemony around the world in the name ofâdemocracy.\n\nA Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson once notedâthat the USâisâaccustomed to posing as theââglobal beacon of democracyââand urging everyone else to take a humane approach to what theyâcallââpeaceful protestsâ, but adoptingâcompletelyâopposite measures at home. She further notedâthat the USâis ânot a beacon of democracyâ, and that the US administration âwould do well to, first of all, listen to its ownâcitizensâand try to hear them, instead of engaging in witch-huntsâin their own countryâand afterwards talking hypocritically about human rights in other countriesâ. The US isâin no position to lecture other countries on human rights and civilâliberties, she noted.\n\nIn May 2021, Latana, a German polling agency, and the Alliance of Democracies founded by former NATO Secretary General and former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, released aâDemocracy Perception Indexâwhich is based on a survey of over 50,000 peopleâin 53 countries. The findings revealâthat 44% of respondentsâare concernedâthat the USâmay pose a threat to democracy in their country, 50% of Americans surveyed are concernedâthat the USâis an undemocratic country, and 59% of US respondentsâthink that their government acts in the interest of a small group of people.\n\nIn June 2021, Brian Klaas, Associate Professor of Politics at University College London, contributedâan article toâTheâWashington Postâentitled âThe world is horrified by the dysfunction of American democracyâ. The article quotesâdata from Pew ResearchâCenter, which suggestâthat âAmerica is no longer a âshining city upon a hillâââandâthat most US allies see democracy in the US as âa shattered, washed-up has-beenâ, and that 69% of respondentsâin New Zealand, 65% in Australia, 60% in Canada, 59% in Sweden, 56% in the Netherlandsâand 53% in the United Kingdom do not think that the US political system works well. More than a quarter ofâpeople surveyedâin France, Germany, New Zealand, Greece, Belgium and Sweden believe that American democracy has never been a good exampleâto follow.\n\nA report by the polling agency Eupinionsâindicatesâthat the EUâs confidence in the US system has declined, with 52% of respondentsâbelievingâthe US democratic system does not work;â65% and 61% of respondentsâin France and Germany hold the same view.\n\nInâSeptember 2021, Martin Wolf, a renowned British scholar,âpointed outâin his article âThe strange death of Americanâdemocracyâ contributed toâThe Financial Timesâthat the US political environment has reached an âirreversibleâ point, and âthe transformation of the democratic republic into an autocracy has advancedâ.\n\nIn November 2021, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, a Sweden-based think tank, released The Global State of Democracy listing the US as a âbacksliding democracyââfor the first time. The SecretaryâGeneral of the institute said that âthe visible deterioration of democracy in the United Statesâ is âseen in the increasing tendency to contest credible election results, the efforts to suppress participation (in elections), and the runaway polarizationâ.\n\nIndian political activist Yogendra Yadav pointsâout that the United States is not âan exemplar of democracyâ, that the world has realized that the US needs to reflect on its democracy and learn from other democracies.\n\nMexican magazine Procesoâcommentsâthat behind a seemingly free and democratic facade, the USâsystem of democracy has major flaws.\n\nSithembile Mbete, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political Sciences at the University of Pretoria, writesâinâanâarticleâpublished inâMail and Guardianâthat âmany of the markers of free and fair elections â a universal votersâ roll, centralized election management, uniform rules and regulations â are absent in the American system. Much of what we Africans have been trained to recognize as good electoral conduct has never existed in the US.ââ\n\nConclusion\n\nAmerica: no longer the beacon on the hill\n\nâ The Times of Israelâ\n\nWhat is now imperative for the US is to get to work in real earnest to ensureâits peopleâs democratic rights and improve its system of democracy instead of placing too much emphasis on procedural or formal democracy at the expense of substantive democracyâand its outcome.\n\nWhat is also imperative for the US is to undertake more internationalâresponsibilitiesâand provide more public goods to the world instead of always seeking to imposeâits own brand of democracy on others, use its own values as means to divide the worldâinto different camps, orâcarry out intervention, subversion and invasionâinâother countriesâunderâthe pretext ofâpromotingâdemocracy.\n\nThe international community is now faced with pressing challenges of a global scale, fromâthe COVID-19 pandemic, economic slowdownâto the climate change crisis. No country can beâimmuneâfrom these risks and challenges. All countries should pull together. This is the best way forward to overcome these adversities.\n\nAny attempt to push for a single or absolute model of democracy, use democracy as an instrument or weapon in international relations,âorâadvocateâbloc politics and blocâconfrontation will be a breach ofâthe spirit ofâsolidarity and cooperation which is critical in troubled times.\n\nAll countriesâneed to rise above differences in systems,âreject the mentality of zero-sum game, andâpursue genuine multilateralism.\n\nAll countries need to uphold peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values ofâhumanity.\n\nIt is also importantâthat all countries respect each other, work to expand common ground while shelving differences, promote cooperation forâmutual benefit, and jointly build a community with aâshared futureâfor mankind."
