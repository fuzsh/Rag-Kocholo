        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Actor Forrest Tucker, a veteran of Westerns and war movies who also played Sgt. O'Rourke in the TV series 'F Troop,' has died of lung cancer at age 67.\n\nThe ruggedly handsome actor died Saturday night at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital, a few minutes after his wife had left following a visit, family spokesman David Isham said Sunday.\n\nHe had been admitted earlier in the week, hospital spokeswoman Linda Tigert said.\n\nThe actor had been hospitalized twice in August, the second time Aug. 21 when he collapsed as he was about to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n'Although an excellent actor in anything, he was known very much for his Westerns,' said William Campbell, a veteran actor who called Tucker a close friend. 'He and Randolph Scott had some of the great screen fights. He was a great actor, no doubt about it.'\n\nTucker was probably best known as the star of the mid-1960s ABC television series 'F Troop,' a farce featuring the gallant but incompetent troopers of Fort Courage.\n\nAs Sgt. Morgan O'Rourke, he spent more time scheming how to make money than defending Fort Courage.\n\nAt 6-foot-5, Tucker was a natural for heroic roles. He was an immaculate dresser and was seldom seen without a carnation in his buttonhole.\n\nComic Milton Berle called Tucker 'a hell of a guy' and a 'really fine dramatic actor.'\n\nBorn in Plainfield, Ind., on Feb. 12, 1919, Tucker started his career in the 1930s as a master of ceremonies at the Gayety Burlesque Theater in Washington, D.C. He was fired when the management found out he was underage.\n\nLying about his age again, Tucker served two years in the Army. Later he returned to work at the Gayety while in high school.\n\nHe then performed in theaters and night clubs throughout the country. Producer Samuel Goldwyn gave him his first break, bringing Tucker to Hollywood in 1940 for his screen debut in 'The Westerner' with Gary Cooper.\n\nAfter a second Army stint during World War II, Tucker built a long and successful movie career. He became known for his portrayal of tough guys in such movies as 'Chisum' and 'Sands of Iwo Jima' with his friend John Wayne.\n\nTucker acted in more than 100 movies, including 'The Yearling,' 'Pony Express,' 'Stagecoach to Fury,' 'The Abominable Snowman,' 'The Crawling Eye,' 'The Quiet Gun,' 'The Night They Raided Minsky's,' 'Final Chapter -- Walking Tall,' 'Plaza Suite,' 'That Championship Season' and 'Showboat.'\n\nHe appeared with Bob Hope in 'Cancel My Reservation' and with Rosalind Russell in 'Auntie Mame.'\n\nHe also appeared in many TV series, including 'Daniel Boone,' 'Gunsmoke,' 'Hollywood Palace' and 'The Dean Martin Show.'\n\nIn 1973, six years after the demise of 'F Troop,' Tucker teamed with Bob Denver of 'Gilligan's Island' for a syndicated situation comedy, 'Dusty's Trail,' which lasted one season. He also was in the short-lived series 'Ghost Chasers' in 1976 and 'The Rebel' in 1979.\n\nOn Broadway, Tucker had his first starring role in 'Fair Game for Lovers.' In 1958 he made his first appearance as Harold Hill in 'The Music Man,' a role he toured with nationally for four years.\n\nSuccessfully tackling nearly every medium, Tucker hosted a popular early morning radio show in Chicago in the mid-1970s. It featured music and interviews with celebrities including Maurice Chevalier and Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nEarlier this year, Tucker married his fourth wife, Sheila Parker, who performed with him in road show of 'The Music Man.'\n\nHe is also survived by three children from his previous marriages, and one grandchild.\n\nServices were scheduled Nov. 1 at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles, Campbell said."
