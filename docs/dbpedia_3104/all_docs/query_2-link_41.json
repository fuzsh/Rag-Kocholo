        "text": "Like the twinkly septuagenarian bank robber in the title, The Old Man & the Gun brims with a rascalâs charm. Itâs an old-fashioned Western in disguise, one in which the bad guy has a good heart. Based on the âmostly trueâ story of Forrest Tucker (Redford), a lifelong criminal who spent most of his life in and out of jail (successfully escaping incarceration 16 times!), this fourth home run from filmmaker David Lowery (Ainât Them Bodies Saints, Peteâs Dragon, A Ghost Story) begins with a string of holdups in Texas and the surrounding area circa 1981, with the unlikely bandits a senior-citizen crew dubbed âThe Over the Hill Gangâ thatâs led by the ever-dapper Tucker. Dressed in a blue suit and tie, topped off by a stylish fedora (with the optional fake mustache), Tucker cordially executes these crimes like a true gentleman, the flash of his handgun a harmless (but effective) prop for pulling off each job as he assures a frightened teller he means no harm (and he truly doesnât). The guy canât help himself â he loves the thrill of the game. Heâs a geriatric adrenaline junkie, playing a high-stakes gamble with the nerve of a young man.\n\nWithout treading on the cute side (this is no Going in Style, with predictable old-fart jokes), the movieâs gentle humor constructively informs its delicate relationships, particularly between Tucker and his would-be love interest, Jewel (Spacek â so good to see her!), and the stumped Dallas police officer trying to track him down, the rumpled John Hunt (Affleck, a stalwart presence in Loweryâs oeuvre). In a telling scene in which Tucker calmly escorts Jewel out of a mall jewelry store with an expensive unpaid-for bracelet still on her wrist, you laugh at the audaciousness of his true-to-form conduct, and yet wince at her realization about the character of the man to whom sheâs attracted. Likewise, another scene in which Tucker impulsively messes with an initially clueless Hunt in a restaurant bathroom initially feels like a Hollywoodized moment (a wry take on Heat, perhaps?), but the lighthearted confrontation belies the old manâs pathological need to play a game of cat and mouse."
