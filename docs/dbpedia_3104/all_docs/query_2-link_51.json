        "text": "Through the years, Martin County has been the residence of many acclaimed, wealthy, famed or otherwise distinguished individuals, but unfortunately, some notorious for criminal activity, even attaining national attention.\n\nProbably none are more infamous, however, than the Ashley Gang, outlaws of the early 1900s.\n\nBut another noted individual of less criminal fame, Forrest Tucker, may be unknown by most Martin Countians, as a perpetual thief, bank robber and skilled prison escapee.\n\nLife of crime begins\n\nBeing a youngster during the Great Depression and the somewhat glorified era of gangsters, cops and robbers, perhaps he was influenced by the fascinating tales in movie newsreels or in print.\n\nTucker's life of crime actually began in Stuart where he lived in those formative days of youth in the 1920s and '30s, continuing for decades afterward, elsewhere in the U.S.\n\nIt is estimated he stole over $4 million during that lifetime 'career' and broke out of various prisons, including Martin and St. Lucie County, a practically unbelievable 18 times, almost escaping on at least a dozen other occasions!\n\nForrest was smart, charismatic, even polite by some accounts, but may have differed from most criminals in that he actually enjoyed the excitement and thrill of the experience.\n\n'Better than Houdini'\n\nHe once claimed to be a better escape artist than Harry Houdini, constantly having to improvise, rather than relying on carefully practiced illusion or trickery as did the famed magician.\n\nTo document some of those escapes, Tucker wrote several unpublished books including “Alcatraz: The True Story” and “The Can Opener” but could not convince any Hollywood producers to make a movie based on the stories.\n\n'The Old Man and the Gun'\n\nIn January 2003, an article written in 1998 by David Grann, “The Old Man and the Gun,” was published in The New Yorker, profiling Tucker from research or interviews.\n\nForrest died in prison in 2004.\n\nAbout 2013, actor and producer Robert Redford read Grann's story, contacted screenwriter/director David Lowery and decided to make a film based on Tucker's interesting adult life of crime, as a polite, gentlemanly, but professional bank robber who seemed to have fun committing the heists.\n\nThe movie premiered Sept. 28, 2018, with the title role played by Redford, also starring Danny Glover, Casey Affleck and Sissy Spacek.\n\nFamily background\n\nForrest's parents, Leroy 'Roy' Morgan Tucker, born in 1890 in Florida, and Carmen V. Silva, also a Floridian, born in 1898, married in West Palm Beach on March 24, 1917; the couple lived temporarily with Roy's parents at 319 Fifth St., Miami.\n\nRoy, who worked for the city gas engineering department, met Carmen Silva while visiting family friends in Stuart, where she resided before the marriage.\n\nCarmen was a very attractive young woman, one of eight children, Ruth, Daniel, Ellen, Hazel, Mabel, Spencer and Veril, born to widower James J. Silva with second wife Ellen Morgan, and half sister to four older siblings from James' first marriage to Emma Hosea in 1890.\n\nThe Silva family moved to Stuart from Lake County, Florida, before 1910; James worked as a tender for the railroad bridge over the St. Lucie River and eventually the auto bridge when completed in 1918.\n\nRoy and Carmen's first child, John Calhoun Tucker, was born Aug. 14, 1918, a second son, Forrest Silva, June 23, 1920 and a third, James Morgan, on Sept. 22, 1923, all delivered at home, 2055 Florida Ave., Miami.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, Carmen's family or friends often visited in Miami and she likewise in Stuart, seeming happy. The marriage became strained, mostly due to Roy's excessive drinking and eventual abandonment of the family. She was granted a divorce in April 1926, attaining total custody of the couple's three sons.\n\nBoys back in Stuart\n\nWith father James' sudden death June 5, 1926, Carmen and the children moved back to Stuart to live with mother Ellen. The boys attended the local school and made friends with classmates Noah Ludlum, Morris Walton, Edwin Coutant, Stuart Gilson, Harold Glass and Larry Butterfield, often visiting each others homes.\n\nThe young boys were active in the scouts club, Forrest especially enjoying the river, even building canoes or sailboats from scrap metal and wood, obtained along the riverbank. With some interest in music, he taught himself to play the saxophone and clarinet.\n\nMother moves to Miami\n\nWithin a few years, Carmen returned to Miami, having married Elijah Walter Brown from Tennessee. Brown owned a large steam shovel company. Carmen held various occupations, including merchant and proprietor of a barbecue restaurant. Their union produced two children, a boy born in 1929, Elijah Jr. and girl, Nora, 1932, both in Miami, but Carmen's three sons by Roy Tucker, lived in Stuart with widow, Ellen Silva.\n\nSilva family pressures\n\nIn 1930, 13 people occupied the Silva's rented $10 a month home on the State Highway in Stuart, including married spouses and grandchildren.\n\nIn 1934, Carmen's mother, Ellen was appointed tender for the newly constructed Roosevelt Bridge. The family, with young Forrest and two sibling brothers, lived at the residence reserved for the bridge tender at the north end of the span.\n\nSon Dan Silva, continued to operate the old drawbridge until its removal a few weeks later, thereafter assisting mother, Ellen, whose responsibilities must have seemed overwhelming.\n\nSituations would be even more complicated as Forrest, age 15, was soon in problems with the law for thievery.\n\nThe Forrest S. Tucker story continues next week in Part 2.\n\nThis column is one of a series, Interesting Stories, Forgotten Facts, by Alice and Greg Luckhardt. Contact them at gandavignettes@gmail.com"
