        "text": "Forrest Tucker joined ABC 36 in June of 2023 as the station’s Weekend Sports Anchor and Reporter.\n\nHe comes to the Bluegrass from Charleston, South Carolina where he was a news reporter and fill-in anchor at WCBD News 2 for two years.\n\nIn the Lowcountry, Forrest covered major court cases, multiple elections and severe weather events among other assignments. He also told several sports feature stories in the community.\n\nIn his free time you can find him cooking up delicious meals, playing soccer at a park and sightseeing around town.\n\nForrest was drawn to Central Kentucky for the chance to cover not just the Wildcats, but also Lexington Sporting Club, Keeneland and high school sports.\n\nWhen watching ABC 36’s Solid Blue Report, just know that Forrest is no SEC rookie. He knows “it just means more.”\n\nIn 2021, he got his degree in broadcast journalism and sports management from the real “Carolina.” Don’t tell him otherwise!\n\nAs a passionate Gamecocks fan, Forrest loves to watch every USC sport he can to cheer on his beloved Garnet and Black.\n\nAside from local news broadcasting, Forrest has experience as a soccer play-by-play commentator, color analyst and team host. He’s worked with the Charleston Battery, Maryland Bobcats and multiple college teams."
