It was low-brow even for an 11-year-old me.\n\nRevisiting it, my opinion hasn’t changed that much. I know there are people out there (including many of you, my dear readers) who really dig this show. And I can see that. Sometimes it feels like “Batman” and the better jokes are for the adults. Sometimes the physical comedy is inspired. And, fuck it, Bob Steele is in the thing!\n\nSo let’s focus on Forrest. He is really good in this! He’s spry! He’s lively and light on his feet. And he seems to be having fun.\n\nThe alternative reality is deadly. Poor Tucker grinding through each episode with a pained expression, hating every pratfall, ever dopey turn by Ken Berry and Larry Storch (a genius!) Instead he appears to be loving it.\n\nWhere’s his damn Emmy?!"
