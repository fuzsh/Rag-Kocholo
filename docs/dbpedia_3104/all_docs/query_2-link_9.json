Claxton and written by Eric Norden and Earle Lyon. The film stars Forrest Tucker, Mara Corday, Jim Davis and Kathleen Crowley. It is based on the 1955 novel Lawman by Lauran Paine.[2][3][4]\n\nIt was also known as 'Fury at Rock River'.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nDoug Sadler (Lee Van Cleef), a cattle rustler comes to town. He's in a secret partnership with saloon owner John Reilly (Tom Brown). They plan to run the stolen cattle into Hell's Canyon, located on land belonging to Ralph Carpenter (Jim Davis). Carpenter and his wife Teresa (Kathleen Crowley) are separated, so Reilly has sent Native American beauty Irene (Mara Corday) to seduce Carpenter. Then Reilly put a flea in the ear of Steven Hardy (Lewis Martin), the town's Eastern born city attorney about \"immorality\". When Hardy tries to serve a warrant for his arrest, in the resulting confrontation Hardy is killed. Sheriff Brandon (Forrest Tucker), who was in love with Teresa before her marriage and was friends with Ralph Carpenter, sets out to arrest Carpenter. However, a lynch mob knocks out the sheriff and hangs Carpenter. Brandon arrests the mob and tricks the city council into stopping another mob that demands the release of the arrested men. Meanwhile, Irene returns to the Carpenter house where she is discovered by Reilly and Sadler, who assault her. At the trial the members of the lynch mob are sentenced to three years in jail. Then Mrs. Carpenter arrives with the news that Reilly and Sadler have killed Irene. In a gunfight Sadler and Reilly are killed. Sheriff Brandon is only wounded and reunited with Teresa.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nForrest Tucker as Sheriff Carl Brandon\n\nMara Corday as Irene\n\nJim Davis as Ralph Carpenter\n\nKathleen Crowley as Teresa Carpenter\n\nLee Van Cleef as Doug Sadler\n\nHank Worden as Sampson\n\nTom Brown as John Reilly\n\nGerald Milton as Lesser\n\nLewis Martin as Steven Hardy\n\nVince Barnett as Undertaker\n\nEdith Evanson as Mrs. Merrick\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was an early movie from Regal Films who made B movies for 20th Century Fox.
