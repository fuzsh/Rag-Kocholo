        "text": "Product description\n\nForrest Tucker (February 12, 1919 - October 25, 1986) was an American actor in both movies and television from the 1940s to the 1980s. Tucker, who stood 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg), appeared in nearly 100 action films in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1941, he played his first lead in Emergency Landing, and the following year he co-starred in the classic Keeper of the Flame. Tucker enlisted again in the Army during World War II, earning a commission as a second lieutenant. He resumed his acting career at the war's end, appearing in the classic 1946 film The Yearling and stealing a few scenes from Errol Flynn in Never Say Goodbye the same year. In 1948, Tucker left Columbia and signed with Republic Pictures. At Republic, he made his breakthrough in Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), as Corporal Thomas, a Marine with a score to settle with John Wayne's Sergeant Stryker. Graduating to top billing, Tucker starred in numerous action films during the 1950s, including Rock Island Trail (1950), California Passage (1950), Rage at Dawn (1955, where he played Frank Reno),The Abominable Snowman (1957), The Quiet Gun (1957), and The Crawling Eye (1958).\n\nNote: These photos are 30, 40, and 50 years or older.
