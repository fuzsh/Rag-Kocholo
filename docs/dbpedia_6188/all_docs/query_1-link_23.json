        "text": "Wednesday 1 January 1840\n\nI bless Almighty God! for having given me as many undeserved comforts during the past year and pray for his merciful protection and guidance through out the one that is commencing, should it be his pleasure to prolong my life to the end of it!\n\nA fine day, without any rain till the evening, when it rained hard between nine and ten o’clock. We were to have drank tea with Mrs Nicholas, but Emma’s cold was so indifferent I sent a note of excuse in the morning and it was fortunate I did, as we should have had a sad, wet, walk home. We were agreeably surprised by a visit from Captain Pyne and Mr W Pyne, who sat some time and were very friendly and pleasant. They came to Bath last night and return home tomorrow. Mrs and Miss Chamier call’d, the former looking better. While they were here Miss Shirley and little Sarah Jane Hale came and staid some time. After Mrs Chamier went, Miss Shirley told us that Mrs C Penneddocke went to Church on Sunday, the day fortnight her husband died!!! and sent out cards of thanks on Monday, the day fortnight he was buried!!!!!! I can hardly believe she can be such an unfeeling little wretch, but Miss Shirley says Mrs Ross told her she had sent a card to her, so she knows it to be true. I am sorry my sympathy and commiseration has been so thrown away! I had a most kind and droll letter from Miss Chambers in reply to mine, in which she says dear Miss Pyne has fix’d to come to Bath the 9th (next Thursday). She forgot to seal her letter! and if the Post Master at Somerton read it, which I have no doubt he did, he must think both Miss Chambers and me very odd people.\n\nThursday 2 January 1840\n\nA beautiful clear sunny morning. Emma did not go out because of her cold, hoping that by taking care it may be well enough for her to go to the Miss Hellican’s tomorrow. I went to Sims’s to enquire for a “Royal Repository” Almanack, which I could not get this year at Rattle and Brines. They had not one, but said they would send to London for one and I should have it on Friday. It began to rain before I got to the bottom of Milsom Street and I returned (as I had not taken my umbrella) till the shower was over and then went to tell Mrs Hibbert that Miss Pyne would be here on the 9th. It rained slightly as I crossed the North Parade, but before I got to the Abbey Church yard it came on so hard I was obligd to take shelter at Moore’s, where I had left my watch to be regulated! As soon as the shower was over I came home, as I was afraid to venture to Miss Workman’s, the shower being so frequent, with bright sun at the same time, quite like April. Miss Hill paid us a long visit. She ask’d us to go to her on Saturday evening. She was going to have the little de Visnes and wish’d us to assist in entertaining them. I said if it did not rain, she might depend on seeing us. I unpack’d and washed three sets of children’s China tea things, which had belonged to my Aunts when they were children. One set is imperfect, with the exception of one cup.\n\nFriday 3 January 1840\n\nWet in the morning, but it held up after breakfast and the streets were tolerably dry for us to walk to the Miss Hellicans’ to dinner at 4 o’clock. Mrs Simpson call’d. She said she had been unwell, or she should have call’d before. There was only ourselves and Miss Workman at dinner at the Miss Hellican’s. We spent a very pleasant day, as we always do there, they are all so kind and attentive. Soon after we went up stair from dinner, Mrs Jane, Miss Hare, Miss Workman and I sat down to Quadrille. When we had play’d one Pool, Mrs Jane and Miss Workman gave place to Mrs Slade and Miss Fanny Hellican. I won 6d. When we were putting on our cloaks the servant said it had been raining very hard the whole evening. Fortunately for us it had subsided into a thick “mizzle” which, tho’ not very pleasant, was better than decided hard rain and only the fronts and bottoms of our cloaks were wet, but the streets were in such a state it was like walking through water. We had at dinner boild sole, fried whiting and lobster sauce, boil’d leg of house lamb, hashed calves head, a pheasant, sea cale, broccoli, carrots and potatoes, mince pies, sweetmeat tarts and one of the richest and most delicious xmas puddings I ever tasted. Chestnuts, medlers, apples, almonds and raisins and biscuits. A Portsmouth News Paper came by the Post, but who from I cannot tell!\n\nSaturday 4 January 1840\n\nA miserable day, thick mizzling rain without any intermission and so dark we could hardly see to work or write. It was so bad we were obliged to have Chairs to go and return from Miss Hill’s, for it was impossible to walk and I thought she would be disappointed if we did not go when she ask’d us to tea, tho’ I am sure it was not worth the 4/- it cost. There was only ourselves and the three young de Visnes and a Miss Menet, a very pretty girl who is staying with them. We play’d at Pope Joan, with which the de Visnes were delighted, never having seen it play’d before. Jane expressd herself very much obliged to us for coming in such bad weather. It was just the same kind of rain when we came home at ten o’clock as it had been all day.\n\nSunday 5 January 1840\n\nA dry but dull looking morning and the streets not so dirty as I expected to find them. We went to St. John’s twice, had Mr Audney to read Prayers and Mr Grove to Preach. While we were at Church the sun came out and it continued beautifully fine the whole day. When we went to Church in the afternoon the old Clerk told us Mr Audney would read Prayers, which we were very sorry to hear, but he afterwards came to tell us that a stranger, a friend of Mr Audney’s would do the Duty, as the latter was not well. The gentleman (and elderly man) read extremely well and I sincerely wish he would take Mr Audney’s place during Mr de Visne’s illness. We sat some time with Miss Workman and call’d on Mrs Chamier, who was up stairs with a bad headache, so we did not see her, and Georgina was not returned from Church, but we met her as we were coming away. Not any rain the whole day!\n\nMonday 6 January 1840\n\nA beautiful day, bright sun and hard frost. Not a drop of rain the whole day!! We went to Brooks the baker to desire he would send a loaf to Miss Pyne on Thursday next and call for orders every day. Call’d at Mrs Chamier’s, found her very much better than I have seen her for a long time past and dear Georgina very well. They ask’d us for tomorrow evening. Came home and dined and then went out again to Miss Workman’s, where we sat some time and had a bit of cake, which was bought as a twelfth Cake for little Henry, only a bread cake, sugared over and as bad a one as I ever tasted. In our way we met Mrs Evans twice and had a little friendly chat with her. We also met the Miss Allens, who said they were coming to us to ask if we would partake of their family dinner on Wednesday. I bought 3 loaves of sugar at Shepphards, one 19 oz at 9d and two 26 oz at 1/9d, £1.14.6 together. Call’d at Mrs Pierrepont’s. She was not at home.\n\nTuesday 7 January 1840\n\nA beautiful day, hard frost and bright sun. Mrs Pierrepont call’d, but scarcely sat down when Major and Mrs Thornton and a lady with them came in and she went away, for which I was sorry, as I wanted to look at a very pretty new bonnet and gown she had on, but had not the opportunity, she was off so quickly. Major and Mrs Thornton sat some time and were very agreeable and pleasant. They said the frost was much more severe in Camden Place than down here, as their cistern and pipes were all frozen, while the water here had not even a thin coat of ice! Freeman went to spend the day with her sister at Carston, I drank tea at Mrs Chamier’s. Emma did not go, as she thought her cold would be increased by going out at night. Freeman walk’d up with me and fetched me at night. I spent a very chearful pleasant evening (tho’ a very cold one). Mrs Chamier was much better and in very good spirits and very kind. Somebody sent us the Times News paper, but I cannot tell who!! The “Times” came from Mr Scott.\n\nWednesday 8 January 1840\n\nAnother beautiful day, but a frost with a vengeance, for the ice did not melt from one of the drawing room windows, notwithstanding as large a fire as could be made, with the addition of the heat of the urn and breakfast, till near 12 o’clock!! and it was “bitter” cold in our bed room. Mrs Slade and Miss Fanny Hellican call’d. Emma did not go out, but I went to Miss Workman’s. She was better than yesterday and in very good spirits. I sat an hour with her and in my way home call’d at Admiral Shirley’s. He was gone out and Miss Shirley was in bed with a very bad cold. Mrs Davis came to the door to me, looking very well and she said she was a great deal better. We were to have dined with the kind Miss Allens, but Emma’s cold was not well enough to allow of her going and I sent a note of excuse. Miss Wilson sent to enquire after us and to hope she should see us soon. I gave Ann the Portsmouth paper to take to her. Sims sent me “The Polite Repository” pocket book, in the place of the Royal Repository, which I have had every year for very many years past, but which is this year discontinued. Freeman paid the young man who brought it 4/-. It does not appear to me to differ in any respect (except in name) from “The Royal Repository”.\n\nThursday 9 January 1840\n\nA very cold thaw and so heavy and dark, I could not see to work but at the window and it had all the appearance of snow, but none fell. We neither of us went out. Mrs Chamier sent to enquire after Emma and I did the same to Miss Shirley, who was better. Ann went between five and six o’clock to see if Miss Pyne had arrived. She brought word back that they came at 3 o’clock, two hours before they were expected, that Miss Pyne was pretty well, but Miss Chambers had a very bad cold. I “niped” one of the 9d loaves of sugar in the evening that I bought at Sheppard’s. There was a very thick fog in the evening, but no appearance of frost, before we went to bed.\n\nFriday 10 January 1840\n\nA beautiful day, but very, very cold. I went out directly after breakfast to Dill’s and brought a small leg of pork and some sausages from them. I went to Miss Pyne’s, who I found looking very well, but poor Miss Chambers has a very bad cold and cough. They both received me most kindly. Mary Ann is very well and delighted to come to Bath again, as is Miss Chambers. After sitting with them more than an hour, I went to the Miss Hellicans’, saw them all. Miss Martha was pretty well again. She and Miss Hare were going to the Picture Gallery. Mrs Jane said she did not feel quite well, but they thought it arose from something having disagreed with her. They were going to have a party to dinner. From there I went to the Post Office to enquire if it was necessary to have stamps for the letters (the Universal Penny Post coming into operation today). They told me it was not. I then went to Mrs Chamier’s. She was not down stairs, but I sat with dear Georgina till she came down. She is looking much better and says she feels so. I sat so long with them that I had not time to go to Miss Workman’s, but call’d at the Miss Allen’s. Found only Miss Janetta at home and in a few minutes two ladies came in and I came away. Found on my return home that Miss Allen had calld here in my absence, but did not come up to see Emma, as she was in a hurry.\n\nI had a note from Miss Wilson to say she had heard from her sister that Dr Quarnier was gone to Clifton and that he would certainly pass through Bath to see us in his way back and to beg we would entreat of him to go to her, as she very much wishes for his advice, having had a distressing attack of her spasms. After I came home, Mr Wiltshire call’d and most kindly brought us each a ticket of admission to the Picture Gallery for the season and a catalogue, so we can go whenever we like. He said he would come tomorrow to sign Emma’s Certificate. The Eyres let their lodging to a gentleman, two ladies and a man servant.\n\nSaturday 11 January 1840\n\nA very fine day, but expecting Mr Wiltshire, I did not go out. Miss Hill and Miss Lawrence call’d and Mrs Charles Barwell and three children, a stranger to me She said that having heard from Mrs Mundy (“my mother in law”) that Dr Quarnier was expected some day this week and that he would certainly call here, she had come to request I would give into his charge the little packet she had brought for him to take to Mrs Munday and she left it here in the chance of the Dr calling. She is a very pleasing lady like woman. While we were at dinner Miss Drewett call’d, so we did not see her, soon after which Miss Wilson came in and sat till half past 4. Both she and we had given up all idea of seeing the Dr and concluded he had not been able to visit Bath. While she was here, Mrs Evans call’d and was very pleasant, as she always is. When she went away, I persuaded Miss Wilson to stay a little longer and she sat down for a short time. When she was going there was a knock at the door and I said “Oh! here is Mr Wiltshire at last”, She replied “Then I’ll stay till he comes up, that I may not meet him on the stairs”, when to our surprise, instead of Mr Wiltshire, in walk’d Dr Quarnier and a gentleman with him, who I think he call’d “Captain Cobb”. They had been to the College to see Miss Wilson, and it was most fortunate that I persuaded her to stay a little longer, or she would not have seen him, which would have distressed her very much. The Dr was all life and spirits, said Eliza was very much better, but could not yet use her right hand. She is staying at Dunannie till he returns and one of the Miss Parkes is staying with her. He goes to Petersfield by tonight’s Mail at eight o’clock. I gave him Mrs Barwell’s parcel for Mrs Munday.\n\nSunday 12 January 1840\n\nA fine day with white frost. I went to St. John’s in the morning. A son of Mr Crutwell’s did the Duty, quite a young man, only in Deacon’s Orders. After Church I sat some time with Miss Pyne and Miss Chambers, the latter’s cold is very bad and her cough very troublesome and Miss Pyne has also a cold. From them I went to Miss Workman’s, who was complaining, but in good spirits and then came home. Found Emma in better humor than when I went out, or she has been since Friday. I did not go to Church in the afternoon, for a thaw having come on, there was so much appearance of snow or rain I was afraid to venture, so we read the Evening Service at home.\n\nWhen we were going to bed, to my astonishment! Freeman said “She hoped Miss Emma had not encreased her cold by going out”, the first intimation I received that she had been out! How detestable such mean concealment is, particularly where there is no necessity for it. Had she told me when I came in that she had been up to Mrs Chamier’s, I should have been delighted to hear it, but no, I was not to know she had been out and would not had not Freeman spoken of it! I have not yet found out the pleasure derived from mean deceit, but all in good time!\n\nI had a most kind letter from dear Henry.\n\nMonday 13 January 1840\n\nA very fine day. I wrote Emma’s Certificate and a note to Mr Wiltshire to ask him to call and sign it, which he did late in the day for him, but he had been to the rehearsal of this evening’s concert at the Rooms, at which Miss Hawes and a Miss Cooper (new) were to sing. Miss Hawes is his favourite singer and he was very much pleased with Miss Cooper. Mrs Pierrepont call’d and sat longer than she usually does. She was going to take Bridger to see old Mrs Pattern and had bought a pound of tea for her. I beggd she would add some sugar, which she kindly said she would. I wrote to Peter Touray with Emma’s Certificate and Ann took the letter and a penny! to the Post.\n\nTuesday 14 January 1840\n\nVery fine till 4 o’clock, when it rained slightly and continued the rest of the day and evening. Emma went to Miss Pyne’s for two hours. I did not go out. Miss Shirley call’d and sat an hour. I had a kind note of invitation from Miss Allen to dine with them on Thursday.\n\nMrs Scott sent us The Times News Paper again, having sent it once before and the Cheltenham Paper twice.\n\nWednesday 15 January 1840\n\nFine in the morning, but the streets very wet and muddy. I did not go out, but Emma went to Miss Workman’s. Mrs Chamier call’d. She did not look so well today,as the last time I saw her and appeared languid.\n\nI wrote to dear Henry and heard from Peter Touray. It began to rain between 4 and 5 o’clock and continued all the evening and Freeman, who was out, said she never in her life saw the mud so bad. It was lucky for us I declined going to Mrs Chamier’s this evening, for we should have had a sad, uncomfortable walk there and home. She asked us either for tonight, tomorrow or Friday evening. I said we would go on Friday. I sent a note to Miss Allen to say we would dine with them tomorrow.\n\nThursday 16 January 1840\n\nFine in the morning. I call’d on Mrs Barwell to tell her I had given the little packet to Dr Quarnier. She was at dinner, so I did not see her. As I was knocking at our own door, the Postman came up with a letter from Mr ? with £5 for Harriett, which I took immediately to Mr Butcher’s and gave it to Mr Bradley. From there I went to Miss Pyne’s. She was pretty well, but poor Miss Chambers’s cold just the same. When I came from there it was raining slightly and before I got to Union Passage, where I took shelter, it pourd. Luckily a man came with a Wheel Chair to the Corridor to see if any person wanted one and I was very glad to take it. While I was out, the dear Miss Allens sent a most kind and friendly note to beg they might send their chair for us or that we would come in one, at their expense, for they could not bear the idea of our walking in such weather. It rained so hard we were obliged to have Chairs, which they would pay for, all that we could say to the contrary and I found if I persevered in refusing to accept the 2/- I should wound their kind hearts, which I would not do for worlds, for they are the among the steadiest and kindest of our friends. No one dined there but ourselves. They were, as they always are, most kind, chearful and agreeable, but Mr Allen, tho very attentive and obliging, was more than usually taciturn and yawny. I could not help wishing he had been engaged out.\n\nWe had fried soals, shrimp sauce, a delicate boil’d turkey and oyster sauce, a roasted chine, which I never saw before, but it was excellent, some of their delicious greens and potatoes, my favourite boiled millet pudding and mince pies, all good of their kind and beautifully dressd. After dinner, oranges, apples, biscuits and almond rusks, which they recommended as being very good, but I did not taste them. Mr Allen eat three or four, so I am sure they were good.\n\nI wrote to Mr Melville.\n\nFriday 17 January 1840\n\nFine in the morning. Emma went to Miss Pyne’s before twelve o’clock to go with her to take the water for the first time. She afterwards walkd with her on the South Parade. It began to rain about two o’clock and continued long enough to make it very muddy. I did not go out till we went to Mrs Chamier’s to tea, when it was beginning to dry in some parts, but in others the mud was very bad. We found Mrs Chamier better. We took the shirt and two chemises that are so beautifully ornamented with curious old point (formerly belonging to Colonel Pyne, an ancestor of Miss Pyne’s) who forfeited very large estates in Somersetshire, by joining the Duke of Monmouth in his Rebellion against Charles 2nd, to shew Mrs Chamier. Both she and Georgina were delighted with them. It was much better walking when we came home than when we went to Mrs Chamier’s. I heard from dear Henry and Peter Touray. I wrote to the latter, to acknowledge the receipt of £53.18.5, the amount of our half year’s dividends and Emma’s half year’s annuity.\n\nSaturday 18 January 1840\n\nA fine looking morning. We went out directly after breakfast to try to get some crimson watered silk, which Miss Parsons sent to Miss Chambers to buy for her. We went to Rigby’s, they thought they had got it, but on looking had not. We then went to Parton and Lanes. They were very civil. They said they were certain it was not to be procured in Bath, it was a thing rarely askd for and being very expensive it did not answer to them to keep it. It might be got in London, but even there it was not always to be had.\n\nWe sat some time with Miss Workman, who complained of her head and we persuaded her to let us call at Mr Gore’s and desire him to go to her, which we did. While we were at his door, it began to rain. I came home, but Emma went to Miss Pyne’s, where she staid to dine and I sent John Cummins with his Wheel Chair to fetch her home in the evening, for it was improper for her to walk, it raind so very hard. I heard from Mrs Keen and wrote to her.\n\nSunday 19 January 1840\n\nA frightful day, pouring rain till 1 o’clock with a wind that shook the house. It was impossible to go out, so we read the Prayers at home, both morning and evening. After the rain ceased, the wind soon dried the pavement, which look’d as if it had been rubb’d with a rubbing stone, it was washed so white and clean. The wind was so violent it was quite alarming and I fear we should hear of great damage on the coast. It was a beautiful moonlight evening till about eight o’clock, when it began to rain and continued all night, at times pouring torrents and the wind frightful.\n\nMonday 20 January 1840\n\nHeavy rain, but it cleard at ten o’clock and was very fine till four o’clock when it began to rain and did not cease afterwards. We went to Miss Workman’s and found her much better from Mr Gore’s prescription. When we left her we attempted to go to Miss Pyne’s, but before we had reached the bottom of Bond Street it began to rain and we turnd back. It was fortunate we did so, for we should have had a sad, wet, walk home. We went into Mr Vezey’s shop to ask if they had any crimson watered or corded silk, saw Mr Vezey’s brother, a very young man, who I had never seen before. He was extremely obliging and said they had both. They did not sell it, but would spare a small quantity to us, being their tenants. It was 10/6 a yard, crimson being dearer than any other colour. I do not suppose Miss Fanny Parsons will like to give that price. The wind was so alarmingly high all night and the rain pour’d in torrents. Miss Shirley call’d while we were out.\n\nTuesday 21 January 1840\n\nVery heavy showers during the day and the wind frightful, almost amounting to a hurricane. Many stones were blown from the house and the police and people in the street were watching the chimneys, which appeard to rock and the house was in almost a constant state of vibration. Some of the gusts appeard as if they would rend the house in two. Mr Keating in Queen Square had six panes of glass blown in, all at the same instant!! The gale did not abate the whole day and night, lasting more than 36 hours!! I fear we shall hear of great misfortunes at sea and on the coast.\n\nWednesday 22 January 1840\n\nFast rain in the morning, but it cleard up after breakfast and the sun shone bright. The wind had abated, but was still brisk enough to dry the streets. We were preparing to to out, a little past two, when it clouded over and there was a violent shower. It did not last long, but it made the streets most uncomfortably muddy. We went to Miss Pyne’s and in our way look’d at the Furs that are to be sold by auction tomorrow. There were a good many muffs, but very few boas. The man said that they had been disappointed in the arrival of a large quantity from London, the waggon by which they were coming having broken down, they would not be in Bath till 6 o’clock this evening and consequently they could not be on view till tomorrow morning, an hour or two before the sale, not one word of which I believe, as I have no doubt they all belong to some shopkeeper in Bath, who wants to raise a little money and takes this method of doing it, under pretence of their being the property of a Bankrupt sent from London. We found Miss Pyne very well and Miss Chambers better, tho’ her cold is still bad and she looks very ill. Mr Kitson sees her every day. We sat some time with them and soon after we came home I had a note from Miss Wilson to say she had just heard from her sister that Dr and Mrs Quarnier were in Bath! and to beg to know if it was true. I sent her word I had not heard of their arrival and I thought I should, if they were really here. Poor soul! She has been,and is still, very unwell. There was a good deal of rain in the course of the evening, but it was delightfully calm. I sent the News Papers to Mrs Chamier. We met Mrs Evans in our way home from Miss Pyne’s. She said she had been very unwell and confined to the house ever since she call’d here a fortnight ago. Mrs Drummond, who returned from London last night, brought me the Law Papers from Henry that were sent to London to prove my right to the money that came from America.\n\nThursday 23 January 1840\n\nWet most part of the day, with heavy showers. We did not go out all day. The wind very rough. I sent the Observer News Paper to Miss Pyne. The wind very high all night.\n\nFriday 24 January 1840\n\nA very wet stormy day. The wind at times frightfully high. About two o’clock it blew a hurricane, with the most tremendous rain I ever saw. It came down in such floods that the streets were quite under water and the violence of the wind was so great that it drove it about in every direction in the air, as if it was battling with it and trying to prevent its reaching the ground. It was the most awful storm I ever saw. When it abated and the water had subsided, there was not a bit of mud remaining in the street. It was washd clean as if people had been employ’d to do it. I had a note from a Miss Mitchell (a friend of Miss Wilson) saying poor Miss Wilson was so seriously ill, that if Dr Quarnier was in Bath, she begg’d I would ask him to go to her immediately and, if he was not here, I would send my medical man, as Miss W had been in excrutiating pain all night and tho’ had applied leeches and her usual remedies, it still continued as bad and they were very much alarm’d about her. I sent the note to Mr Gore immediately, with a request he would go as soon as possible. The weather was too bad to send Ann to enquire if he had been and how he found poor Miss Wilson. Miss Workman sent us her Bath Paper. Mary said her mistress was wonderfully well.\n\nThere was a great deal of thunder and lightening during the hurricane this morning, which I was not aware of at the time.\n\nSaturday 25 January 1840\n\nStill wet and showery with high wind in the morning. It sometimes held up and the sun came out for an hour, but then came rain again! I sent Ann to Mr Gore before breakfast to ask how he found Miss Wilson yesterday. She brought word that there was nothing to be alarm’d at. Mrs and Miss Chamier and Miss Webb call’d. While they were here, Miss Shirley came in. Miss Webb told us that a stack of chimnies was blown down at “Velone” (General Andrews’s) on Tuesday. They came thro’ the roof and forced every thing before them to the Drawing Room, where they broke the magnificent chandelier and did other damage to the amount of a thousand pounds! How dreadfully frightened poor Mrs Andrews must have been. Mrs Chamier ask’d us to spend the evening with her on Monday, if the rain will permit. She and Georgina were in mourning for the Margravine of Hamberg. Miss Shirley staid some time (till nearly five o’clock) after they went away.\n\nI had a note from Miss Chambers to say Mrs Michell died! on Thursday last at half past eight in the morning! It was an event from her great age. Long expected.\n\nSunday 26 January 1840\n\nA very wet morning, the rain too violent to allow of our going to Church and the wind very high. There was now and then a little cessation of rain and a short gleam of bright sun, but it did not last long and the gusts of wind were really frightful. We read Prayers both morning and evening at home.\n\nMonday 27 January 1840\n\nA very fine looking morning with bright sun. We were preparing to go to Miss Pyne’s when it became very dark and a violent shower came on. In the midst of it a note came from Miss Chambers to Emma to beg she would go to them to walk with Miss Pyne as soon as the rain was over. She went, I staid till the streets were a little dryer, but before that took place there were two more showers. At last the sun came out again and I went to Miss Pyne’s. She was comfortably well and Miss Chambers very much better. I sat there some time and left Emma there to walk again with Miss Pyne and I call’d on Mrs Evans, the Miss Allens and Miss Workman. The two former were not at home. I left the “recipe” for netting mittens for Miss Janetta. Miss Workman was very well and in good spirits. The wind was high, but not violent and the streets dry, as we had no more rain till the evening. Mrs Pierrepont call’d and sat some time, as did Mr Wiltshire here at past 5 o’clock. He came to tell us he had heard a bad account of Dr. Cooper, that he so was seriously ill that he was not expected to recover! I hope from my heart that the account is exaggerated. Mr Wiltshire promised to let us know as soon as he heard any thing more. We spent the evening at Mrs Chamier’s and had dry streets!!! and bright stars to go there and tho’ there had been rain in the course of the evening, the streets tho damp, were not muddy when we came home. Miss Workman sent us some of Mrs Jones Graeme’s ham. It is not bad, but not like our own.\n\nTuesday 28 January 1840\n\nWet morning. As soon as it held up, Emma went to walk with Miss Pyne. They returned just in time to escape a hard shower. Miss Janetta Allen call’d, but was frightened away by the darkness of the clouds and I fear she could hardly have got home before the rain poured. Emma was fortunate enough to get home before it began. The wind was very high in gusts all day, but more so in the evening, when it was like great guns. It was so dark for some time about three o’clock, I could scarcely see to write. Emma got me change for the B P B from London, £53.18.5.\n\nThe family went away from Eyres in their own carriage this morning.\n\nWednesday 29 January 1840\n\nA beautiful day. Emma went to Miss Pyne’s directly after breakfast and I went up to Mrs Chamier’s with The Observer. Georgina was gone out and Mrs Chamier had not left her room, so I did not see her. From there I went to Miss Pyne’s, calling in my way at Dills, to desire they would send for the hams tomorrow to smoke. Met Miss Hill and Mrs Hudson, the former told me that Miss Martha Hellican had been blown down in the street last Friday and very much hurt! After sitting a short time with Miss Pyne, we all came out together. We left her and Miss Chambers at the South Parade and we call’d at the Miss Hellicans to enquire after Miss Martha. We only saw Miss Fanny. She told us her sister was very much bruised, but no bones were broken. Her hip is the part most seriously injured and it will be a long time before she is able to walk about again. From there we went up to Mrs Simpson’s and Mrs Thornton’s, both out, met Major and Mrs Thornton in the carriage, near their own house, then to Mrs Chamier’s again, Mrs Hardcastle’s, Miss Haugh’s, Mrs Lowry’s, Mrs Jackson, Mrs Pierrepont’s, Mrs Kipling’s, Miss Shirley’s, Mrs Drummond’s and Miss Workman. They were all out, except Mrs Lowry and Miss Workman. We pass’d half an hour very pleasantly with the former and sat some time with the latter. I came home quite tired, but my dinner refreshed me. We drank tea at Miss Pyne’s. It was very fine and dry to go there, but it rained soon after and the streets were wet to come home, but fortunately it did not rain. Saw Mrs de Visne at the Post Office, who said Mr de Visne was better.\n\nThursday 30 January 1840\n\nA very fine day again. As soon as we had breakfasted, we went with the tickets Mr Wiltshire has so kindly given us for the season, to the Exhibition in Quiet Street. Going so early we had it all to ourselves for some time and when we came away there were only ten people besides ourselves. There are a great many beautiful pictures and I was very much amused and gratified. From there we went to Miss Pyne’s, but did not stay long. Calld at Miss Hellican’s door, “Miss Martha was better, but not able to move.” From there to Miss Drewett, who we found at home, then to Mrs Polwheles. She was gone out to spend the day at Captain Collins’s in Edgar Buildings. From there we went to Miss Hill’s and sat some time with her, in the course of which Mr Horton came in, but did not stay long. When we left her, it look’d so like rain I would not call on Mrs Partis, which I had intended to do, but hurried home, expecting every minute to see it begin, but it did not till about six o’clock, when it made up for its forbearance by pouring all the evening. In our way home we calld at Miss Pearce’s in Milsom Street, with a message from Miss Chambers about Mrs Stuckey’s bombaszine dress. Miss Harrison call’d while we were out. Mary brought Miss Workman’s Bath Paper. Met Mr Davis by the Institution, who greeted us most kindly. He is looking remarkably well.\n\nFriday 31 January 1840\n\nA very fine morning. Emma walk’d with Miss Pyne and brought Miss Chambers back with her. They went out again together to look at Flaherty’s and Eyres Lodgings, as Mrs Stuckey is soon coming to Bath and wishes to be in Milsom Street. The former is 4 guineas a week and 19/6 plate and linen. Eyres 4 and a half guineas a week, without linen and plate, except it was taken for any time when it would be 4 guineas. Miss Hough and the youngest Miss Philingham call’d, the latter (who I suppose is come to spend the Season with her Aunt), looking very pretty.\n\nDill forgot to send for the hams yesterday and Emma had the trouble of going there to say so this morning, when they sent immediately.\n\nSaturday 1 February 1840\n\nHeavy rain the whole day, without intermission. We had a note of invitation from Mrs Polwhele to meet Miss Hill on Monday evening, but I shall send an excuse, for two reasons: first the distance is so great I am sure the amusement will not pay the trouble, and next, I do not wish to increase my tea drinking visits.\n\nSunday 2 February 1840\n\nA very fine morning. We went twice to St. John’s. An old gentleman of the name of Hughes did the Duty in the morning and Mr Awdry in the afternoon. We calld on Miss Workman and Mrs Chamier between the two Churches. Miss Workman very comfortable and Mrs Chamier so much better that she lookd quite herself again. She ask’d us for tomorrow evening, which enabled me when we came home, to write a note to Mrs Polwhele to say we were engaged to her. After the evening service we call’d on Miss Pyne. She was not come home from the Abbey. Mary Ann told us Miss Pyne expected her three nephews, Captain Pyne, William and Colonel Michell tomorrow in their way from Mrs Michell’s funeral at Gloster. We were surprised to see the water so much out all the fields at the bottom of both Parades, being entirely covered, but we were told that the rain poured in such torrents last night that it was astonishing it was not worse.\n\nIt began to rain as we went to Church in the afternoon and there was a hard shower, but was fine again till after we got home, when it began again and lasted all the evening and night, at times violent. Upon the whole it was fortunate Miss Pyne was not at home, for if she had, we should have had a sad, wet, walk.\n\nMonday 3 February 1840\n\nA showery morning, but it cleared up in the middle of the day and the streets dried. Emma went to Miss Pyne’s to walk with her and did not return till near 4 o’clock. We drank tea at Mrs Chamier’s. It was quite dry to go, but about 9 o’clock it came on to blow most violently with torrents of rain. It was quite impossible to walk home and there was great danger in being blown over in a Chair, besides the difficulty of getting one, for the weather was too tempestuous to send any body out to see for one, but luckily a little past 11 we heard men talking and Mrs Chamier, very timely, threw up the window and ask’d if they were engaged. They had just put down a fare and agreed to take us both, which I was glad of, as I thought our two weights safer than one. By the mercy of providence we came home safely, but I was dreadfully frightened, as I really thought we should have been blown over in Russell Street, besides which I was almost stifled, for it was a very small Chair and with Emma in my lap, I could hardly breathe. We left our cloaks and tippets at Mrs Chamier’s that we might have no unnecessary encumbrance in the Chair.\n\nWe had the Devizes paper from dear Mr Scott yesterday and I sent it back to him at Cheltenham today.\n\nTuesday 4 February 1840\n\nA day of hard rain without ceasing. I had a note, while at breakfast, from dear Miss Allen to ask us to dine with them tomorrow and soon after one from Mrs Drummond to say she had just heard from Dr Quarnier that he and Eliza would be with her tomorrow evening! and to ask us to meet them at tea. I wrote her word we were engaged to the Miss Allens, but would call early on Thursday morning. I wrote immediately to Miss Wilson to tell her of the joyful news and enclosed Mrs Drummond’s note. Ann took it to the Post office.\n\nDear Georgina Chamier sent out umbrellas and a note to enquire how we got home. Mary took back the “Observer” and a piece of green oil cloth for Mrs Chamier, which Mr Stacey was so obliging to get for me and which Mrs Chamier very much wanted for her lace work, but did not know where to get it. I am always so glad when I can accommodate her in any way, she is so very kind to us.\n\nOne of Mrs Jones’s maid servants call’d to enquire how we did. She came from Oldbury yesterday and is going back this afternoon. Dear Mrs Jones has got a bad cold, but Maria, Mrs J Graeme and Miss Bowie, who is staying there, are very well.\n\nWednesday 5 February\n\nA dry day, with the exception of a few drops of rain about 2 o’clock. Emma had a head ache come on after breakfast and did not go out. I went to Miss Pyne’s. She was just returned from her walk and very tired. Miss Chambers very well again. I sat some time with them and then went to the Post office with Miss Chambers, who walkd home with me, but was afraid to come in, it lookd so like rain.\n\nMrs Drummond call’d before I went out and brought Dr Quarnier’s letter. He is going on to Mrs Tobin in Devonshire and leaves Eliza with Mrs Drummond till he comes back. The latter askd us to come tomorrow evening. I afterwards met her in the street. She said she was going to ask the Miss Allens, but if [I] would give them a message, it would save her the trouble of going, which I agreed to do. Miss Shirley call’d and sat till it was time to dress. Mrs and Miss Chamier and the dear Allens calld while I was out, the latter to leave the money for our Chairs to them today, which they insisted on our having.\n\nEmma’s head was so bad after she was dressd that she was unable to dine at the Allens and I was obliged to go without her. The dear Miss Allens are always agreeable and Mr Allen was in one of his best humours and very pleasant. At dinner we had a very large hare, a piece of delicious stewd beef, a pheasant, a delicious Cabinet pudding, mince pies, potatoes, greens, Bath and other cheeses and after dinner oranges, apples, figs, damson cheese, almond rusks and biscuits. Emma was in bed when I came home and her head was better.\n\nThursday 6 February 1840\n\nA beautiful day throughout. Emma was better, but not able to go out. I was preparing to go to Mrs Drummond’s to see Eliza, when they came here. Eliza was, as usual, all warmth and affection. She is looking better than I expected to see her, but very pale and thin. She says she is quite well, except her hand (s) which are still so much affected she cannot bend her fingers on indeed use them to any extent. She is going to Bathe and have her hands pumped on and wished me (as Emma was not well enough to go with her and Mrs Drummond) to enquire what time she could have a bath. Just as we were going, Mrs Pierrepont call’d but would not sit down. I thought she went away in a little “miff”, but I hope not. We went first to the Hetling Court Bath, but the woman there was so impertinent and unaccommodating that she would prevent any person going there. She told Eliza she could not have the woman to rub her there, it was not allowed, “she must have her at home”, “but don’t they allow at the other baths” “No, no, where” “Well I shall go and enquire”. We then went to the Old Corporation Baths, where they were altogether as civil and obliging as they were otherwise the Hetling Court. They said it was a common practice to have the Rubber in the Bath Room. They sent to engage her at the hour Eliza wished and in short did every thing that was kind to accommodate her. Mrs Drummond left us there and we look’d into the Pump Room to see if Mr Calbeck was there. As he was not, we went to the White Hart, where he is staying. They shew’d us into a room and Mr Calbeck came to us. He is very old looking and very deaf and is now suffering from a violent inflammation in one of his eyes, caught in coming from London. I walk’d to Mrs Drummond’s door with Eliza and then went up to Mrs Chamier’s, where I sat some time. Mrs Chamier kindly askd us to dine there on Saturday. I drank tea at Mrs Drummond’s. There was a group of 13, all strangers to me, except the dear Miss Allens, (who arrived just after me and we came away together) and Miss Caldwell, who was very gracious. There was Admiral MacKay and two sisters, a Doctor Stamer “DD”, an agreeable man and three other gentlemen whose names I did not hear. I had a Chair to go and return. Mrs Drummond had every thing very elegant about her. Eliza fix’d to call at two o’clock tomorrow to take me to see poor Miss Wilson. The Miss Allens and Mrs and Miss Chamier call’d on Emma while I was out.\n\nFriday 7 January 1840\n\nAlternate sunshine and heavy showers. Just as I had got ready to go with Eliza, Miss Susan Hughes of Devizes was announced. She called here in her way to Mrs Quarnier, but finding I was expecting her here every minute, she said, if not inconvenient, she would sit with us till she came. She was very pleasant and agreeable, more so that I ever saw her before and staid an hour and half when, as Eliza did not make her appearance and her patience being exhausted, she took her leave. As she went out Miss Shirley came in. she said there was no chance of Mrs Quarnier’s coming for some time, as she had seen Lady Belman’s carriage at Mrs Drummond’s door as she passd in her way home. When she came, I found she was in the open carriage and the two covered seats were occupied by herself and Mrs Drummond, so I declined going with them to see poor Miss Wilson, as it was beginning to rain and there is no shelter on the front seat. It was fortunate I did so, for soon afterwards there was a violent shower, in which I must have been wet through. I went in the evening to Mrs Drummond’s, under the idea there would be no one but myself, as Mrs D said “come in your bonnet and the gown you breakfast in.” I did not exactly do that, but I did not take a cap and was sitting with Eliza in my bonnet, Mrs Drummond being up stairs dressing, when the door opened and Mrs Pyne Coffin was announced and in she came, very nicely dressd as for a party. She look’d at Eliza, whom she had never before seen and then at me, who she did not recognise, and then round the room in search of Mrs Drummond and not seeing her was evidently embarrass’d .To obviate, which I, not being able to introduce myself, introduced Mrs Quarnier and we fell into conversation very pleasantly. Presently, down came Mrs Drummond and with apologies to Mrs Coffin for not being in the room to receive her and to Eliza and me for not having told us Mrs Coffin was coming, our different conjectures on Mrs Coffin’s entrance created much amusement, Eliza fancying she had mistaken the house or the evening for which she was ask’d. I thought Mrs Drummond had deceived me and expected a party, but it turned out they were both going to a Ball next door and she was ask’d to take her tea with us before she went. She was extremely agreeable and the evening passd very pleasantly. I made the tea while Mrs D was dressing and when she came down she look’d very elegant, her gown being black velvet, trimmed with beautiful real old fashioned lace, fastened down the front with diamonds, diamond necklace, earrings and spray and ornament in the front of her black velvet hat and white feather. I never saw her look so well, tho’ Eliza did nothing but find fault with her hat and insisted on her taking out the flowers which, in truth, was a great improvement. As soon as they went to the Ball, I went up stairs with Eliza to sit with her while she had her poor hands champood and rubb’d, which occasions her great pain. Freeman came to fetch me between ten and eleven and Eliza had her up in her room to talk to her and give her a commission to procure her a very fine fowl, a pound of tea, six pounds of sugar and a pint of calves foot jelly, all for poor Miss Wilson and a dozen oranges for herself. When I left her she said she should call to take me and the good things to Miss Wilson at 2 o’clock tomorrow.\n\nIt was dry to go to Mrs Drummond’s and to return (tho’ there had been rain between) and it was fortunate it was so, for the wind was too high to allow of carrying an umbrella. Mrs Drummond askd me for tomorrow evening, but I told her we were engaged to dine at Mrs Chamier’s. A gentleman left Mrs Luken’s card, without any address and a most affectionate letter from dear Mrs Vassall.\n\nSaturday 8 February 1840\n\nOccasional showers in the morning, but it cleared up and was dry in the afternoon. I waited till near 4 o’clock, expecting Eliza, when Sarah came to say her mistress had been persuaded not to go out after her pumping and to beg I would send the things to Miss Wilson by a Chairman, which I did by John Cummings. Just as we were putting on our cloaks to go to Mrs Chamier’s to dinner, Mrs Drummond came in to our surprise, for it was half past five. She did not stay more than a quarter of an hour and then we set off. The streets were quite dry and the moon shone bright. We always meet with a kind and warm reception and spent a pleasant day. When we were coming away, we found the rain was pouring in torrents. I had desird Freeman not to fail to send us Wheel Chairs if it raind at eleven o’clock. It was more near twelve and no Chairs, so we prepared to walk home and most fortunately the rain had expended itself and it was so slight when we came away it was not of consequence and had ceased before we reached Russell Street. It had been so violent that the water was rushing down the streets like little rivers and sounded like water falls thro’ the grating of the sewers. Freeman was so glad when we came in dry, as she said it was impossible to get a Chair. Ann had been everywhere in search of one and came home so completely wet through Freeman was obliged to undress her and put her to bed and then she went out herself, but could not get one. We had at dinner fried soals, harrico of mutton, a very fine roasted fowl, potatoes, rice pudding and plum tart. Oranges (the best I have tasted this year) and biscuits. We had not been at home half an hour before the rain came down in torrents. Freeman’s sister Mary came up from Lyme.\n\nSunday 9 February 1840\n\nA wet morning, but it cleard up before Church time and was fine the rest of the day. We were at St. John’s twice. Had a delightful Reader in the morning, a Mr ? who gave us an excellent Sermon beautifully delivered, quite a young man and Mr Awdry in the afternoon. After Church we sat some time with Miss Pyne, who has had a cold. Met Miss Chambers and Mr Randolph at the door as we came out and askd the former to come and see the Procession in honor of the Queen’s marriage tomorrow. We had intended going to the Miss Hellicans’ to enquire after Miss Martha, but met Miss Fanny and Miss Hare. Ask’d them come. We then went to Miss Workman, who was complaining we could not stay long, as we had scarcely time to dine and go to Church again. As we came to our own door, Miss Drewett was knocking at it. She came to ask if she might come tomorrow. She did not stay long, as she knows we dine early. I did not press her to stay, as we had no time to spare. To our disappointment we found dear Mrs Lukin’s card again, still no address, so we determined as soon as we came out of church we would make the tour of the hotels in search of her, having before dinner been to the house in Bennet Street, where she was with Mrs Brown when she was here last year, without success. We ask’d for her at the White Hart, the White Lion, the Grey Hound, the Castle and the York House and found she was at the latter, but was not at home. I left word with the waiter I would send a note. We then went to Mrs Drummond’s in the hope of getting off going there this evening, but could not, as neither Mrs Drummond or Eliza would allow it. We sat there till five o’clock, when Mrs Drummond came out with us to give her little dog a few turns. When we parted she begg’d we would not be later than half past six o’clock, but by the time I had written my note to Mrs Lukin and made a little alteration in my dress, it was seven and we set out. It rained a little but did not till after we got there. After tea, Mrs Drummond went to see her sick old friend, Mrs Boltby and we sat with Eliza, who had not been out all day, not feeling very well and being much disappointed at hearing from the Dr that he would not be able to come till tomorrow evening, instead of this.\n\nWe staid till near eleven. When we came away it was raining, fortunately only slightly, as the wind was so violent we could not hold our umbrellas up without the danger of their being split or our being blown over. When Ann opened the door she told us we had not been gone five minutes before Mrs Lukin call’d again and left word she was very sorry she could not see us, as she was going into Devonshire tomorrow morning at seven o’clock! I do not know any thing that has vex’d me more for a long time past. If she had only put on her card where she was to be found, I should not have been so cruelly disappointed. Freeman’s sisters, Mary and Martha, came from Lyme last night. I saw Mary and shook hands with her before I went to Church. We call’d at Mrs Pierrepont’s but did not go in.\n\nMonday 10 February 1840\n\nA beautiful day, which was fortunate for the poor children and indeed all who were to walk in the Procession in honor of the Queen’s wedding. The show was much better than I expected it would. There were a great number of gentlemens’ carriages and the dear old Bishop look’d so well in his open carriage and four, the front seat of which was completely fill’d by himself and his beautiful lawn sleeves. The back was occupied by one of his sons and Mr Brymer.\n\nWe had a good many people to see “the show”. Miss Hare and a neice of the Miss Hellicans’, Miss Hill, Mrs de Visne, Miss Chambers, Mrs and Miss Chamier, Miss Drewett, Mrs Drummond, Dr and Mrs Quarnier (the Dr having arrived this morning from Devonshire to her great delight), Mr Calbeck and Mr Iveson, who came with Miss Drewett. Every one appeard very chearful and pleased. It continued fine till near five o’clock, when there was a very slight shower, but it soon pass’d off and did not return till the evening and then only slightly. Between 5 and 6 o’clock an immense body of Chartists (who had had a meeting on Beacon Hill) pass’d down the street, with a good band of musick. They were very numerous, I should think two thousand or upwards, nearly half females and I was sorry to see so many respectable men (in appearance) with them! There was a good deal of bustle and talking in the street till twelve o’clock, after which it was very quiet.\n\nTuesday 11 February 1840\n\nA beautiful morning. Emma went to Miss Pyne’s and walk’d with her. I was prevented going out by Miss Hughes sending me a note yesterday to say she was going home today and would try to call here before she went, so I was obliged to stay at home. Poor Freeman was very unwell with one of her sick headaches, the effect of excitement and over exertion yesterday.\n\nMrs Osborne call’d to ask us to speak in her favour to the gentlemen of the Monmouth Street Society. They allowd her mother, old Mrs Pattern, 1/- a week which, of course, ceased when she died and Osborne is very anxious to obtain it. I told her we had not interest, but I would speak to Miss Hill and see what I could do for her. It rained in the afternoon.\n\nWednesday 12 February 1840\n\nA very wet day. Sarah came from Mrs Quarnier to beg Freeman would get another fowl, some more jelly, 1/2 pound of butter and a nice twist and send them by a Chairman to Miss Wilson. Freeman could not get a twist, so sent two Beckford loaves instead. While I was writing a note to go in the basket, one came to me from Miss Wilson to ask when the Quarniers were going and to entreat I would urge the Dr to see her again before he went, as he had not staid more than ten minutes with her when he went to the College on Monday. I enclosed a note from him to her, telling her they should go on Friday and that he would certainly see her on Thursday. The dear Miss Allens call’d and sat some time. Mrs Drummond askd us for the evening, but I said I was engaged, which was a fib, but I did not want to go.\n\nThursday 13 February 1840\n\nA beautiful day. As soon as we had breakfasted we went to Admiral Shirley’s, saw Miss Shirley, but the Admiral was not out of his room. From there we went to Miss Workman, where we sat some time. She was pretty well, then to Miss Pyne’s. She was just come in from her walk and a good deal ?, Miss Chambers a great deal better. We call’d at the Miss Hellican’s door to enquire after Miss Martha. The servant said she was better, but not yet able to walk. It was so beautifully pleasant we went over the bridge and up the Wellington Road to Pulteney Street, where we call’d on Miss Hill and Mrs Partis. The former was not at home, the latter was, but engaged. I left a message of thanks for the list of voters to the Deaf and Dumb asylum, which Mrs Partis had lent me for Miss Hughes and which I returned on Monday. From there we went up to Marlbro’ Street, St. James’s Square and call’d on Miss Harrison, who was not at home, then at Mrs Davis’s, she was engaged, then at Miss Haugh’s. She and Miss Fillingham were at the door coming out. She was very pressing that we should go in and rest ourselves, but I declined it and we walk’d together to the Circus, where we parted. We were going to Mrs Pierrepont’s and overtook her at the top of Gay Street. I askd her to speak to the gentlemen of the Monmouth Street Society in favor of Mrs Osborne and she very kindly gave me a recommendation in writing for her to take to them. From her we went to Mrs Drummond’s. She, the Dr and Eliza were gone to Miss Wilson’s. Both Emma and I were so tired we could not go to Mrs Chamier’s. When we came home we found Eliza had calld here soon after we went out and questioned Freeman very closely to know where we were last night. Mrs Drummond sent to ask us for this evening, but Miss Pyne had done the same in the morning and I had accepted her invitation, besides which Mrs D had a party at dinner and they were all going to the Ball at 1/2 past ten, so I should not have gone there. Just as we had got on our cloaks, Sarah came to say the Eliza sent her love and entreated we would come between seven and eight and she would receive us in her own room at that time. I told Sarah it was quite impossible, but we would see her before she went tomorrow morning. Poor Sarah said “I don’t know what Mrs Quarnier will say, she will be in such a taking.” It was a beautiful moonlight both to go and return from Miss Pyne’s and we spent a very chearful pleasant evening. Mrs Kipling call’d after we came home in the morning and sat a long time. She was very agreeable. She came to tell us that Mrs Carpenter’s married daughter has just got a “little missey” to the great delight of its Grandmama. We met the dear Miss Allens near our own door, as we were coming in.\n\nFriday 14 February 1840\n\nA beautiful morning with bright sun and very white frost and ice, wherever the pavement had been wetted. We got up early and went up to Mrs Drummond’s before breakfast. When we got there Mrs D was making the breakfast and very kindly said she hoped we were come to partake of it, but I said we had breakfasted, as I did not like to intrude. Sarah came to beg we would go up to Eliza. In my way the Dr, who was writing in the Drawing Room stoppd me to give me one of his friendly kisses. Eliza was only just out of bed, so we left her to dress and we went down and sat with Mrs Drummond and the Dr, who were beginning their breakfast, when Eliza came down and had finished hers. She went with us to Finnegan’s, her brother having come in just as we were going out. When we returnd, the Dr was ready to go with her to Mrs Barwell’s. We accompanied them there and took leave at the door. Eliza was so strenuous for us staying with them till they got into the carriage, that I was obliged to say we had not breakfasted. She would kiss us in the street. It was eleven o’clock before we got home. I was hungry and relished my breakfast very much. It continued fine the whole day, but I did not go out again.\n\nSaturday 15 February 1840\n\nA heavy rain the whole day.\n\nSunday 16 February 1840\n\nA fine day. We went to St. John’s Church. Mr Awdry read the Prayers and an elderly gentleman preached an excellent Sermon for the united hospital. Mr Keating held the Plate. We call’d on Miss Pyne, Miss Workman and Mrs Chamier, the latter was not at home.\n\nMonday 17 February 1840\n\nA fine day. We call’d at Mrs Drummond’s. She was complaining of a cold. Met Mr Calbeck there. Call’d at Mrs Chambers.\n\nTuesday 18 February 1840\n\nA dry day, but very cold. We dined at Miss Hill’s, met Miss Coates, (who is staying there), Miss Curtis and her married sister Mrs Collett at dinner and a Mrs Stock came to tea. Spent a chearful pleasant day. It was dry to walk home. We had at dinner Gravy soup, roasted fowls, a ham, veal pie, beef olives, oyster patties, a very nice pudding, mince pies, blancmange jelly, Bath and other cheese and salad, oranges, apples, almond and raisins, biscuits and a nice cake, and cake and wine in the evening. The dear Miss Allens call’d to ask us for Saturday evening to meet Mrs Cozelet Smith, Miss Burmester, Miss Bowles and a Mrs Smith and her daughters from the neighbourhood of Nottingham.\n\nWednesday 19 February 1840\n\nVery cold and dry, but threatening snow. I wrote to Mrs Quarnier and sent the parcel I received from Finegan for her on Saturday, enclosed in a Box of her own to Portsmouth. Ann took it to the White Hart and had it book’d to go by the Celerity Coach tomorrow morning. We drank tea at Miss Pyne’s. It was dry to go and come, but piercing cold. It snow’d a few flakes as we went to Miss Pyne’s, but it did not continue.\n\nThursday 20 February 1840\n\nA very heavy dark day, extremely cold, with frequent flakes of snow. I had a parcel from Miss White, Sarah’s Aunt, with some pieces of furniture for Emma’s patchwork and a few bits of silk for mine. Enclosed was a letter for Sarah and a little packet for Mrs Quarnier, both of which I forwarded by the Post. Emma took them and paid 4d for the packet and 1d for Sarah’s letter.\n\nWe call’d on Mrs Chamier and sat till Georgina’s luncheon was brought in. We then went to Miss Workman’s. I wrote to thank Miss White for her kindness in sending the pieces for patchwork. Mrs Chamier kindly ask’d us for Saturday evening, but we were engaged to the Miss Allens.\n\nFriday 21 February 1840\n\nA fine day, freezing hard and a north east wind that cut one to pieces. We walk’d to Grosvenor Place to see youg Lukin before I answerd dear Mrs Vassall’s letter. Bought a dozen oranges at Miss Grabhams (1/6) to take to him. Found him a sweet boy with very pleasing manners. We did not stay many minutes, as their dinner was ready. As we came out of the parlor, we met Mrs Groves, who press’d us to return and rest, but we declined it. We did not find it quite as cold in returning as in going, the wind being behind us. We went over Bathwick Bridge and call’d on Miss Hill and Miss Coates. They were out, but we afterwards met them. We went to Miss Pyne’s. She told us Miss Chambers was gone to us to ask us to drink tea with them this evening, as we were engaged tomorrow. In our way home we met Miss Chambers. We went to Miss Bode’s to order a pound of German wool for Miss Pyne. Miss Bode shew’d us a most beautiful piece of work she has been doing for a Mrs Dandas “The Goldsmith’s daughter”. It is much more like painting than work. We took Miss Hills and Miss Coates in to see it. We spent a very chearful evening at Miss Pyne’s, as we always do and had some excellent coffee with delicious Devonshire cream, sent her by a friend just arrived from Tiverton. It was intensely cold, both going and coming home, freezing hard, with a cutting north east wind. I bought a beautiful small neck of veal at the butcher’s behind the market. We call’d at Miss Workman’s, but did not sit down. Met Captain W Lye and had a few words, but it was too cold to stand talking.\n\nSaturday 22 February 1840\n\nHard frost and north east wind. Emma walkd to Partis College to see poor Miss Wilson, who she found in bed very unwell still. Miss Harvey walk’d part of the way home with Emma. I sat more than an hour with Miss Workman and Emma and I met at the door at home. Miss Janetta Allen call’d to say Miss Burmester and one of the Mrs Smiths were too unwell to go to them this evening, in consequence of which Mrs Corzelet Smith had excused herself and there would be only ourselves and Miss Bowles and begg’d we would bring our work. She insisted on our coming in Chairs and with her usual kindness left the two shillings to pay for them, making seven shilling they have paid for us in Chair hire! We spent a very pleasant evening and I was sorry when the Chairs came. I do not remember every having seen Mr Allen so chearful and agreeable.\n\nOur neck of veal turned out excellent. Major and Mrs Thornton, Mrs Thackery, Mrs Davis and the Dr call’d in the course of the week but I cannot recollect what days.\n\nSunday 23 February 1840\n\nStill freezing, but a bright sun, tho’ just as cold as yesterday. We were at St. John’s twice. The young man, whose name I have forgotten, read the Prayers and preachd in the morning, Mr Awdry reading the Communion part of the Service. The Sermon was a very good one. We had Mr Awdry again in the afternoon. We call’d and sat some time with Miss Pyne. In our way home we met Miss Hare, Miss Fanny Hellican and her neice and afterwards Miss Chambers. Call’d on Miss Workman, but did not stay long, as we had very little time for our dinner before going to Church the second time. I wrote to dear Mrs Vassall in the evening, to go by tomorrow’s Post.\n\nI heard from Miss Armstrong, but with no better account of dear Mr Scott. They sent us the Devizes News Paper. Mrs Simpson call’d before we came home from Church.\n\nMonday 24 February 1840\n\nA beautiful bright sunshine day, but not at all warmer than yesterday, the wind being in the same quarter and the frost as severe, but it is delightfully healthy and will do a great deal of good. We cannot be grateful enough for the change, after such a continuance of wet. I did not go out all day, but Emma went to Miss Pyne’s and Miss Chambers walk’d with her to Mrs Turner’s. Mrs and Miss Chamier call’d and sat some time. They said they were going to the Play tomorrow to hear Mr and Mrs Wood, but I had a note from dear Georgina in the evening to ask us there tomorrow, as Mrs Wood is not well enough to sing. I had also a note from Miss Hill, enclosing one from Mr Rye, saying he had put Mrs Osborne’s name on the list of Petitioners to the Monmouth Street Society and he did not doubt she would soon be enrolled and receive the Weekly allowance as long as she lives. I wish with all my heart it may be so!\n\nMrs and Miss Polwhele call’d and sat half an hour.\n\nTuesday 25 February 1840\n\nStill very fine and cold. Mrs Osborne came to say the “Monmouth Street Society” had most kindly put her name as a 1/- weekly pensioner for life, for which she was very grateful not only to them, but to us for having interested ourselves in her behalf. We call’d on Miss Pyne and at the Miss Hellicans’ door to enquire after Miss Martha, who is better, but not able to move and then went over the North Parade Bridge to Miss Hill. She was just going to dinner, so we did not sit down, but went directly to Mrs Partis’s, where we staid half an hour. The old lady was pretty well and Miss Hughes quite so. We sat a short time with Miss Workman and then call’d at Mrs Pierrepont’s, who was not at home. Miss Pyne ask’d us to tea tomorrow evening. While we were preparing to go to Mrs Chamier’s a basket came from Mrs Keen containing a fowl and duck and a letter. It was very kind of her. We spent a pleasant evening at Mrs Chamiers, but she was poorly part of it. She ask’d if we would go to her again tomorrow to meet Mrs Bradshaw (a sister of Miss Ash, who lost her husband two or three months ago) and play Quadrille. I told her we were engaged, but Emma said she was sure Miss Pyne would excuse us and we are to try what we can do tomorrow morning. I ordered some roasting and boiling beef from Hales.\n\nWednesday 26 February 1840\n\nA fine cold frosty day. I had a note from Georgina Chamier to say Mrs Bradshaw was going to them this evening and to hope we would meet her. We went to Miss Pyne’s directly after breakfast. She very kindly said it would make no difference to her, provided we came tomorrow evening. When we came home Emma went to Mrs Chamier’s to say we would go there. We went at 7 o’clock. Mrs Bradshaw’s Carriage was just driving from the door. On going up stairs we were introduced to her. She was very chearful even to gay, and as unlike a recent widow as possible, much more resembling an emancipated spoilt school girl at home for the holydays. We sat down to Quadrille almost directly and play’d till the tea was ready, after which we renew’d our pool and continued playing till twelve o’clock, the latter part there were so many beasts, I thought it never would be over, we were obliged to put into the pool so often, to play them out. Mrs Bradshaw’s man waited for her near two hours. She walk’d home as well as ourselves. She appears very good natured, but an oddity and had as much the appearance of a widow as I had. Her hair was parted on her forehead in the present style of wearing it and her cap was quite at the back of her head, shewing the whole division of her hair, with no tie or anything to fasten it on and being in the extreme of the present fashionable shape, it was frequently near falling off and she had three or four most beautiful diamond rings!! not very widow like!! We spent a very chearful evening and had sandwiches, cake and hot punch.\n\nThursday 27 February 1840\n\nA fine day, but I did not go out till the evening. Mrs Drummond call’d early. She was very agreeable, as she always is. She had heard from Dr Quarnier who said Eliza had derived much benefit from the pumping here and was very busy superintending the planting at Dunannie, so I expect to hear of her being laid up again very soon. Just after Mrs Drummond went away, Mr Calbeck call’d, but we did not see him, as we were just going to dinner and later in the day Miss Shirley came in and sat some time. We spent a pleasant evening at Miss Pyne’s. Mrs Stucky and Miss Michel come on Tuesday next, for which I am very sorry,. They bring Fanny Parsons with them to stay with Miss Pyne, for which I am more sorry.\n\nFriday 28 February 1840\n\nA dry, but dull looking day, without sun or frost. Emma went to Miss Pyne’s early, by appointment, to go with her and Miss Chambers to see the lodgings that have been taken for Mrs Stucky at No 10 Pulteney Street, which they like very much. We were agreeably surprised by a visit from Mrs Brymer, who was extremely pleasing and agreeable and look’d very pretty. While we were at tea Mr Wiltshire very kindly sent us 2 tickets for the Pump Room Concert tomorrow.\n\nSaturday, 29 February\n\nA very fine day, but very cold. We saw Mr Wiltshire at the Pump Room and thankd him for his kindness. We also saw Mrs Simpson, the Thorntons and Miss Burmester, but not to speak to them. Went to Moor’s for my brooch, paid 6d for its being mended. Sat with Miss Workman some time in our way home. She ask’d us to drink tea with her on Monday, which we promised to do, provided Miss Pyne did not ask us for that evening. Call’d at the Miss Allens’. We were very much gratified with the music at the Pump Room. Henry Field play’d beautifully and Mr Burnet sang a very pretty ballad of his own composition so sweetly he was encored. Miss Cooper, Miss Patten, Mrs Penley and Mr Lawler also sang. The room was very full, upwards of four hundred, but only 260 paid, the rest being friends of the performers, but that was very well at 5/- a ticket.\n\nSunday March 1 1840\n\nA very fine day, but intensely cold with a rough north east wind. We went to St. John’s twice. Emma went to Miss Pyne’s to walk with her to St. John, it being Sacrament Sunday. Mr Awdry read the Prayers and a Mr Bythesea preached a beautiful Sermon, most pleasingly delivered. We had Mr Awdry again in the afternoon. Mr de Visne was at Church in the morning, but did not do any part of the Duty. We call’d on Miss Workman and sat some time with her. I had intended to go to Mrs Chamier’s after the afternoon Service, but it was so piercing cold and the wind was so high, I would not go. I heard from Miss Wood with a commission to get her two dozen pocket handkerchiefs at Hornbys.\n\nMrs Simpson call’d while we were out.\n\nMonday 2 March 1840\n\nA very fine day. We call’d at Miss Pyne’s who ask’d us to come in the evening. We then went to Hornbys for Miss Woods cambric handkerchiefs. I chose two dozen from “seventy dozen” just brought from London by Mr Tucker, for her at £1.3.6 the dozen and one for ourselves at £1.10.6 the dozen. I also bought 4 yards of muslin for bed room blinds at 3/- and 24 yds of cap ribbons, pink, blue and lilac at 3d a yard. Emma went back to walk with Miss Pyne and I went to Miss Workman’s to excuse our going to her this evening and she ask’d us for tomorrow. From there I went up to Mrs Chamier’s. Georgina was gone to Mr Penby’s Concert and Mrs Chamier was in her room, having just put leeches on her fingers. I went up stairs to her and sat more than an hour with her. We drank tea at Miss Pyne’s. She is expecting Mrs Stukey, Miss Michell and Miss Fanny Parsons tomorrow. Mr Calbeck call’d and was very agreeable. Met Major Thornton in the Market while I was buying the salt fish for Wednesday. He was doing the same and was good humoured and friendly as usual. The Eyres let their lodging to an old gentleman and lady with a man servant.\n\nTuesday 3 March 1840\n\nA very fine day. We went to Hornby’s and got a dozen cambric handkerchiefs for Miss Pyne at £1.2.6 and took them to her. Mrs and Miss Chamier call’d, as did Miss Wilson, who is looking very poorly. The former ask’d us for Friday evening to meet Mrs Bradshaw for Quadrille. We drank tea with Miss Workman, who had in the morning heard of the death of her old friend Mrs Bilke, which distressd her very much.\n\nAsh Wednesday 4 March 1840\n\nA fine day. Emma went with Miss Pyne and Miss Chambers to the Abbey. I went to St. Johns, shook hand with all the de Visnes. Mr Marshall read the Prayers. I went to Hornby’s to pay 7/- for cap ribbon that they had forgot to charge yesterday and then sat some time with Miss Workman. Soon after Emma came home, we call’d on Mrs Brymer, who was not at home. Met Miss Chambers in Laura Place. She was going to see if they had made fires at no 10 in Pulteney Street, where she has taken lodgings for Mrs Stuckey, who is coming this evening. We turnd back with her and look’d at the lodgings, which are very comfortable. I call’d on Miss Drewett. Miss Chambers did not like to go in, so Emma walk’d up and down with her. Of course my visit to Miss Drewett was a short one. We then went to Hornbys with Miss Chambers to get some handkerchiefs for a Mrs Cridland, a friend of hers and then came home.\n\nThursday 5 March 1840\n\nA very fine day. I wrote a long letter to Miss Wood and enclosed one of the Cambric handkerchiefs in it (paid 2d). We calld on Mrs Thackery and found her at home, but fortunately the Misses were not. We did not stay long, as Mrs Thackery had her cloak on to go out. In our way down we calld at Mrs Chamier’s, who was not at home and then in our way to Miss Pyne’s, put my letter to Miss Wood into the Post Office, found Miss Pyne alone, as Miss Chambers was gone out with Miss Parsons, who is a stranger in Bath. We were just coming away when they return’d, accompanied by Miss Michell, who was looking very pretty. From there we went to Mrs Stuckey’s, who receiv’d us very kindly. She likes her lodgings, which appear very comfortable. Dear Miss Allen call’d while we were out. Went to Hornby’s to pay for Mrs Criedland’s handkerchiefs and got 37d of nett for caps at 9d a yard. Miss Shirley call’d. Met Mrs Simpson, who told us that Dr Cooper thought he had received very great benefit from Mr R Smith’s prescriptions “There’s a feather in Reginald’s cap”. Also met Mrs Drummond and walk’d up Brock Street with her. Mrs Harrison’s lodgers went away.\n\nFriday 6 March 1840\n\nA most beautiful day. Miss Chambers call’d early to walk with Emma to the College, who found Miss Wilson, tho better, still very poorly. When she came back, we went to Miss Workman’s and by way of a walk for me, went to the end of Green Park Buildings and then to the end of Norfolk Crescent. In our way there we sat some time with Miss Shirley. The Admiral was not at home. Mrs Pierrepont call’d. She has been confined with a cold and did not look well. Mrs Uniack is staying with her. We drank tea at Mrs Chamier’s, met Mrs Bradshaw and play’d Quadrille till twelve o’clock! I won a 1/-, Emma lost 5/-! Found a note from Miss Haugh on our return home, to ask us to meet “half a dozen friends and play a round game” tomorrow evening.\n\nSaturday 7 March 1840\n\nA beautiful day. I wrote a note of excuse to Miss Haugh. We call’d at Miss Workman’s after dinner and then took a long walk thro’ the Park, all over Salter’s new nursery ground and round the Park home. Saw the Collapsed Head of Jupiter for the first time and do not admire it. All together the Head is very good, but the stone work on which it stands is (to my taste) very much too high and the rocky stones scattered about the base of it have no meaning and have a very ugly and unfinished appearance. I came home very tired, having walkd more than two hours. Miss Workman went out in a Chair and call’d on Mr Templeman and took a long round. Mr Calbeck call’d while we were out. He is going to Devizes for a few days, but returns here before going to Salisbury.\n\nSunday 8 March 1840\n\nA beautiful day. We were at St. John’s twice. Emma went to fetch Miss Pyne and we walk’d home with her afterwards and sat with her till Miss Parsons came home. Met Miss Chambers just as we came out. We call’d on Miss Workman after the afternoon Church and found her pretty well, not the worse for going out yesterday. Miss Pyne ask’d us to tea tomorrow. Met Miss Polwhele in Milsom Street. She told us Mrs Hudson was very unwell.\n\nMonday 9 March 1840\n\nA very fine day. I did not go out in the morning, having an uncomfortable cold in my head. Emma went to Miss Hill’s to enquire after Hudson. She did not see Miss Hill, as she was engaged (preparing for her card party this evening, I imagine). Hudson was better. Miss Pyne! and Miss Chambers call’d. Miss Pyne did not come up stairs, but I went down to speak to her. They came to say Mrs Stuckey and Miss Michell were to meet us this evening. Miss Fanny Hellican, Mrs Slade and Miss Hare call’d while we were at dinner, so we did not see them. Mrs and Miss Chamier call’d. They brought Miss Ashe’s card and a note of invitation to meet Mrs Chamier there on Wednesday to play Quadrille. We drank tea at Miss Pyne’s, met Mrs Stuckey and Miss Michell and pass’d a chearful evening, but I like it better when we are there with only Miss Chambers. We did not come away till eleven o’clock. My cold but indifferent.\n\nTuesday 10 March 1840\n\nA beautiful day again, for which we cannot be sufficiently grateful. We call’d on Miss Ashe to say we would go to her tomorrow evening and were very kindly received by her and her sister, Mrs Bradshaw. We then went to Mrs Drummond’s and spent half an hour very pleasantly with her. From there we went to Mrs Chamier’s, who was not at home. Took her the “Observer” and then to Miss Shirley’s, where out visit was short, as Miss Ross came in and we went to Miss Workman’s and then came home. Found Mrs Stuckey, Miss Michell had call’d while we were absent. Mrs Pierrepont call’d.\n\nWednesday 11 March 1840\n\nA dull, gloomy looking day, but dry. Emma went to walk with Miss Pyne directly after breakfast and did not return till after two o’clock. Old Mr Hughes from Devizes call’d, looking as well and fresh colourd as a young man and said he could outwalk many young men, tho’ he completed his 80th year last November!! We went out at 7 o’clock to Miss Ashe’s, as she requested, but Mrs Chamier did not arrive till more than half an hour after. The tea things were brought in before she came and Mrs Bradshaw made the tea immediately after she came in, and as soon as that was finished, Mrs Bradshaw, Mrs Chamier, Emma and I sat down to Quadrille. Miss Ashe declined playing. We play’d three 5/- pools. I held remarkably good cards and won 7/-, Emma lost 4/6d, not from bad cards but bad play. We had cake and wine and did not come away till half past 11 o’clock, after spending a very pleasant evening. We went and returned in Chairs. Being the first visit, we did not know whether we could change our bonnets for caps. Mrs Bradshaw desired our Chairs not to come till half past eleven.\n\nMrs Harrison let her lodgings to a gentleman and lady and man and maid servant. They came in a Handsome open carriage with hack horses.\n\nThursday 12 March 1840\n\nJust such a day as yesterday, with now and then a faint gleam of sun. Emma went up to Mrs Turner’s directly after breakfast and Mrs Turner sent word she should keep her to dine. Miss Hill call’d and sat some time. Hudson has been dangerously ill, but is better. Miss Chambers and Miss Parsons call’d and were very agreeable. I gave Freeman 2/6d for a poor family. I heard from Miss Wood. I sent Ann at five o’clock to walk home with Emma but she came home just after Ann went away and brought a little bit of the Queen’s Bride cake from Miss Barry, who had a slice sent her from a gentleman who is attached to the “Board of Green Cloth”.\n\nThursday 13 March 1840\n\nA fine day. As soon as we had breakfasted, we went to Miss Workman’s and found her a good deal agitated and affected, having just heard that her late kind friend Mrs Bilke had left her a legacy of a thousand pounds!! which we rejoiced to hear. After sitting some time with her, we call’d at Mirs Kiplin’s. The old lady received us very kindly and shewd us her birds and her Green House. From her we went to Mrs Chamier’s and staid a long time and then call’d on Miss Ashe, who was very obliging and lastly on Mrs Pierrepont, where we met Mrs Drummond, who told us she had heard from the Dr (Quarnier) Eliza was progressing and very busy at Dunannie. They wish’d Mrs Drummond to go to them, to be present at the opening of the floating bridge, which is to take place in a few days. Mrs Pierrepont has a very bad cold and looks ill.\n\nMiss Hare, Miss F Hellican and a nephew and neice of the latter call’d while we were out. Freeman shew’d them Miss Pynes old beautiful work’d shifts and shirt.\n\nMary came from Miss Workman to say she wish’d to see us tomorrow morning. Miss Janetta Allen call’d while we were out.\n\nSaturday 14 March 1840\n\nA gloomy looking day, but it did not rain. We went to Miss Workman’s, who only wanted to see us about having her bonnet altered. From her we went to Miss Pyne’s. She was gone to take the Water and we followed her to the Pump, but met her in Bath Street and walk’d home with her. Miss Chambers soon came in and after eating a bun, we went over the Parade Bridge to Miss Hill’s, where we found Miss Polwhele. There we had a slice of very nice home made cake and heard that Mrs Hudson was very much better. We calld on the Miss Allens’, found only Miss Allen at home, nursing a cold, to go to Mrs Drummond’s in the evening. We call’d at Mrs Pierrepont’s door to enquire after her. John said she was very poorly, but not worse.\n\nSunday 15 March 1840\n\nWe went to St. John’s, Emma going first, to walk with Miss Pyne there. It began to rain between eleven and twelve o’clock and continued the rest of the day. Mr de Visne did the whole Duty. Shook hands with Mr and Mrs de Visne. I was obliged to have a wheel chair home. Emma staid with Miss Pyne in the old Clerks ? room, till the door of the Hetling pump room was opened for her to take the Water, and then she came home, I having sent Ann with the umbrella down to her. She, luckily, met a chair in her way and sent it to take Miss Pyne home. I had a not from Miss Chamier in the evening to ask us to tea tomorrow, as they had prevailed on Miss Workman to come.\n\nMonday 16 March 1840\n\nCloudy with now and then bright sun, but very cold. We neither of us went out. I sent to enquire after Mrs Pierrepont. She was better. We had a succession of visiters, first Miss Braband and Mrs Dyke, the latter particularly pleasant, the former not otherwise, then dear Miss Janetta Allen. While she was here Mrs Slade of Pulteney Street and Miss Hughes of Devizes. As they were going down stairs, Miss Drewett and her constant attendant Mr Iveson came up. They had not been gone long before Mrs and Miss Chamier came. They said Miss Workman had sent to say she did not feel well enough to go to them today, but still they hoped to see us or, if more convenient to us, tomorrow, as Emma’s cold was but indifferent. I said we would go tomorrow. Miss Shirley call’d while we were at dinner. She said she would call again, but did not. Portbury brought two News Papers from Mrs Chamier and I sent 6 back by her.\n\nTuesday 17 March 1840\n\nA very fine day, but a very cold cutting easterly wind. We call’d at Miss Pyne’s for a few minutes and then went to the Miss Hellicans. Found dear Mrs Jane and Miss Fanny quite well and Miss Martha nearly recovered from her accident. Mrs Slade and Miss Hare were not at home, but the former came in just as we were coming away. We walk’d down the Bridge and call’d on Mrs Slade and Miss Hughes, who were not at home and then cross’d Bathwick Bridge and call’d on Mrs Dyke and Miss Brabant in Beaufort Buildings. They were not at home, but Miss Dyke was and was very pleasant. Mrs Dyke came in soon after we got there and was very friendly and pleasant.\n\nEmma took Miss Pyne’s curious work’d shirt and shifts to shew them, with which they were much pleased. We call’d on Mrs Fry, who was at dinner, so we were not admitted. In our way home we met Miss Brabant, who was very gracious and so much obliged by our taking the trouble to walk so far to call on her. She had a gentleman walking with her.\n\nWe spent the evening at Mrs Chamier’s as pleasantly as usual. Miss Pyne ask’d us for tomorrow evening. Call’d at Miss Workman’s, found her pretty well. I heard from Mrs Keen, to get her some more cotton.\n\nWednesday 18 March 1840\n\nA dry day, but threatening rain. Miss Shirley call’d and paid a visit. Miss Drewett also call’d and ask’d us for tomorrow evening. I said we were engaged, for I did not want to go. She then said would we come on Friday. I was obliged to say “yes”. We spent a very chearful evening at Miss Pyne’s, only ourselves. Fanny Parsons was very pleasant. She is going with Mrs Stuckey and Miss Michell to the Ball tomorrow evening, to the Play, Saturday and to the subscription Ball on Monday. We call’d on Miss Pyne and in our way got the cotton for Mrs Keen.\n\nThursday 19 March 1840\n\nA very fine day. Emma went to walk with Miss Pyne and heard that the party to the Ball was put off, Mrs Stuckey being unwell and Miss Mitchell having a cold and sore throat. We call’d at Miss Workman’s, at Mrs Pierrepont’s door to enquire after her, (she was much better and had been out in the Carriage) and at Mrs Dorset Fellows’s, where we spent a pleasant half hour. She ask’d us to tea this evening, but I said we were engaged. I wrote to Mrs Keen and heard from Mrs Wood, Maria’s mother, with directions how to send the handkerchiefs.\n\nMrs Harrison’s lodgers went away.\n\nFriday 20 March 1840\n\nA fine day. I wrote a note to Mrs Wood and did up the handkerchiefs in a small parcel and took them to Mr Tucker, who very civilly said he would forward them to London. I directed the parcel for Mrs Wood to the care of Mrs Nelson, The Bull Inn, Aldgate, London (for Mr Wood of Blakersham). From there we went to Mrs Stuckey’s. She was much better, but Miss Mitchell’s cold still indifferent. While we were there, Miss Chambers came in and we left her there. We call’d at Miss Workman’s. We went to Miss Drewett’s in the evening, met Mr Iveson and play’d Cassino, stupid enough Mr Iveson walkd home with us. While we were out in the morning Miss Wilson call’d. She left word she had been to Mrs Drummond, who she found in bed with a cold. Miss Mitchell gave me a cambric handkerchief to mark for her, with her initials E. D. M. I saw Sir Thomas Fellowes pass down the street!\n\nSaturday 21 March 1840\n\nA beautiful bright day, but very cold. We took some News Papers to Mrs Chamier’s, where we staid some time and then Emma went to walk with Miss Pyne and I went to the Exhibition in Quiet Street, where I had engaged to meet Miss Chambers and Miss Parsons, who had, with Miss Maria Hellican, Miss Hare and Mrs Crickland just got up stairs before me. I staid two hours and a half with them, without sitting down and tho’ I did not feel tired at the time, I felt it in the evening. Both Miss Chambers and Miss Parsons appeard very much amused and pleased with the pictures. Emma was not come home when I returned, but came soon after. I markd Miss Mitchell’s handkerchief.\n\nMet Mrs Evans in the street and had a long conversation with her about Miss Workman and whether she had done anything in her Will for Mary! The clock stopped almost directly after I wound it up. Met Mr Thackery, who was very gracious.\n\nSunday 22 March 1840\n\nSuch a gloomy looking morning we took our umbrellas to St. John’s with us. Emma went to fetch Miss Pyne and I walkd down straight to the Chapel. Mr de Visne did the Duty to a very full congregation. We walk’d home with Miss Pyne, but did not see either of her nieces, as they were not come home from Church. We met Miss Burmester at the afternoon Service, the congregation at which was very small. We call’d at Miss Workman’s in our way home and sat some time with her. Mrs and Miss Chamier had been there just before us. Young Henry kindly sent us the “New Zealand Journal” the 4th time and the 4th number.\n\nMonday 23 March 1840\n\nA wet morning, heavy rain mix’d with snow and a very high wind. The rain blew off between eleven and twelve and the sun shone very bright, but with occasional very heavy black clouds and now (and) then a few drops of rain. I sent to Mr Noble to come and see what was the matter with the clock. A young man came from him, who said it wanted cleaning and took it away for that purpose. We did not go out all day and no one call’d. Mary brought a message from Miss Workman to beg if we went out tomorrow we would call on her. Mr Scott sent us the Devizes Paper.\n\nTuesday 24 March 1840\n\nA bright sunny morning, but it became very dark between 11 and 12 and there was a very heavy shower of snow, succeeded by bright sun and then another Snow Shower, followed by beautiful sunshine again. We did not go out till after dinner, when we call’d on Miss Workman and Mrs Drummond. The latter was too unwell to see any body. We drank tea at Miss Pyne’s, met Mrs Stuckey, Miss Parsons and a Miss Crickland, a good humourd, agreeable girl. Spent a chearful pleasant evening. It was very cold both going and returning. A cutting north east wind all day.\n\nWednesday 25 March 1840\n\nMuch such a day as yesterday. Snow, showers and sun and very cold. We did not go out all day. The dear Miss Allens call’d, as did Miss Shirley. The latter staid a long time. I had a note from Miss Ashe to ask us to meet Mrs Chamier and “play low Loo” on Friday, but as we did not wish to go, I sent word we were engaged. Had a note in the evening from Miss Shirley to ask us to dine tomorrow!! “better late than never”.\n\nI paid Mr Vezey a quarters rent £13.2.6 due today. Sent the “Observer” Paper to dear Miss Pyne and was surprised and concerned to hear on Ann’s return that she was very unwell, having fainted away twice, but Mr Kitson had assured them there was nothing alarming in the attack. Mary Freeman came in the afternoon to meet little Robert Pyne, who was coming from Pitney to school at the College. He came here and had some tea with Freeman (which I was not aware of till after he was gone, as I should have had him with us), after which she and Mary walk’d with him to Grosvenor Place. Mary slept here.\n\nThursday 26 March 1840\n\nA fine morning, but very cold. I sent to enquire after Miss Pyne and Mrs Drummond, the former “a great deal better”, the latter “better than yesterday, but still very indifferent”. We dined at Admiral Shirley’s, only ourselves, very chearful and pleasant, The Admiral went out in the evening and we spent it with Georgina. At dinner, cod and oyster sauce, beautiful roast fowls, sausages, mashed potatoes, broccoli, custardy pudding and a delicious apple tart. Oranges, apples, French plumbs and almonds.\n\nCalll’d on Miss Workman and Miss Pyne. Found Miss Parsons alone in the drawing room, but Miss Pyne and Miss Chambers soon came down, the former much better, the latter but poorly. Miss Mitchell came in to take Miss Parsons to the Catholic College. We sat some time. After they were gone and in our way home, to our astonishment met Dr Cooper in Milsom, looking very ill. He had been to call on us and I wished him to return, but he excused himself on account of his health. Mrs Cooper and Miss Yeatman are with him and they are at number three on the South Parade. He is come to try the Waters. If they agree with him, he talks of staying three weeks. We had a long conversation in the street, which might have continued much longer, but Sir John Smith came up and we took our leave. Miss Yeatman call’d with him, but had left him before we met.\n\nFriday 27 March 1840\n\nA fine day, but extremely cold. Emma was not very well, so I went by myself to call on Mrs Cooper, who received me very kindly, as did the Dr. Miss Yeatman was not at home. I sat a very long time with them, as both they and I had much to say. I never saw Mrs Cooper looking so well as she does now. She is grown very fat, which is a great improvement and she really looks better and younger than when she married. From them I went to Miss Pyne’s and found her better. I then went up with some News Papers to Mrs Chamier’s, met her just at the rooms in her way to us. I went on and sat half an hour with dear Georgina. Mrs Chamier ask’d us to go there this evening (Miss Ashe had put off her Loo party), but as Emma was poorly, I thought we had better not go out at night and she very kindly begg’d, if Emma was well enough, we would drink tea with her tomorrow.\n\nSaturday 28 March 1840\n\nFine, but still very cold. We did not go out till the evening. Dr Cooper call’d and sat an hour and a half and was most friendly and pleasant. Soon after he was gone, the dear Miss Allens call’d. We spent the evening very chearfully at Mrs Chamier’s.\n\nSunday 29 March 1840\n\nA fine morning. We went to St. John’s twice and call’d on Miss Pyne after the morning Service. Miss Chambers was not at home. While we were there, Miss Martha Hellican came in and we left her there. We went to Church earlier than usual in the afternoon and found only the Miss Allens there, with whom we had a long chat before any other person came in. Mr de Visne did the Duty, both morning and afternoon. We walkd with the Miss Alllens to their own house, in our way to Miss Workman’s, where we met Mrs Evans, who was very pleasant and chatty. I had a letter from Mr Pigou enclosing one to him from Mr Stewardson and two Powers of Attorney for me to sign, empowering Mr Stewardson to receive £790!! and remit it to me.\n\nMonday 30 March 1840\n\nA fine day. Emma went to Miss Hill’s and took Miss Pyne’s curious shirt and shifts to shew to Mrs Hudson, who was not well enough to come here to see them. Mr Evans had the kindness to call here relative to the American money. One of the powers must be altered, as they have designated me “Only child of H Chapman”, and the other I must go to Bristol to have witness’d by the American Consul there. I wrote to Mr Pigou and returned him, as he desired, Mr Stewardon’s letter. I also wrote to dear Henry. Miss Hill ask’d us to tea this evening, but I did not feel inclined to go and was fortunate we did not, as it rained in the evening. I had a message from Miss Wilson to say she and Miss Harvey would drink tea with us on Wednesday, if we were disengaged.\n\nEyres lodgers went away.\n\nTuesday 31 March 1840\n\nA showery day. We went half way down Milsom Street, intending to call on Mrs Cooper, but were driven back by the rain. Miss Drewett call’d and while she was here Dr Cooper came. He sat a very long time. He thinks himself better and the Water appears to agree with him. I wrote to Mrs Scott to enquire if Cheltenham was a warm and comfortable situation for an invalid in the winter, at Dr Cooper’s request, as he has some thoughts of wintering there, should he live.\n\nWednesday 1 April 1840\n\nA good deal of rain in the course of the day, so much so we thought it would prevent Miss Wilson and Miss Harvey, but it did not. The former came early in the day and staid with a friend till near 6 o’clock and then came to us, and the latter join’d her here at the time, it having cleared up sufficiently in the afternoon for her to walk in. We play’d at Cassino and they were very chearful.\n\nI heard from Mrs Quarnier, her own writing dated “London”!!!\n\nThursday 2 April 1840\n\nA very fine day. We went early to Mrs Cooper’s and were very kindly received by them all. I had not seen Miss Yeatman before. We sat a long time chatting to the Dr and Miss Yeatman. A Miss Bowles, who we found there preventing any one but herself from speaking to Mrs Cooper. When she rose to go away, I did the same, but the Dr insisted on our staying for “you have not been able to exchange a word with Mary.”, so we sat down and staid half an hour longer. The Dr very kindly asked us when we would come and drink tea. I said any day that they were disengaged and Mrs Cooper said then come this evening. From there we went to Miss Pyne’s, found her alone, did not stay long with her, as we had to go to Pulteney Street, but first went to Moore’s, to have my watch set and then to get some steel pens for Mrs Keen. We then call’d at Mrs Partis’s, who has just lost her sister and was too unwell to see any body, and lastly at Miss Hill’s, who was not at home. Mrs Hudson was better. In our way home we encountered Mrs and Miss Chamier in New Bond Street and we walk’d together as far as the middle of Milsom Street. They had call’d on us, as had Miss Hill and Mrs Pierrepont while we were out. We went to Mrs Cooper at half past six, saw the Dr walking on the Parade and joined him till I was quite tired. We spent a pleasant evening and walkd home a little after ten. The Dr was very desirous that his man should come with us, but I declined it. I heard from Mrs Keen. Her letter was written on one side of the sheet of paper, on the other half of which was a view of the “Earth slide” at Lyme. I wrote to her and enclosed her two of the dozen pens I bought for her this morning. We went to Finegan’s with a message from Mrs Quarnier. Mrs Stuckey and Miss Mitchell call’d so late, they did not go away till a few minutes before 6 o’clock. Met Miss Grevile, a friend of the Miss Hellicans and Mrs Turner’s. She askd if it would be agreeable to exchange morning visits.\n\nFriday 3 April 1840\n\nA very fine day. We went to Miss Workman’s soon after breakfast and paid her a long visit. I have not seen her so well and so chearful for a long time past. Her kind friend Mrs Bilke’s bequest of £10.0.0 was free of the legacy duty and to be paid immediately. From her we went to the Miss Allens’. While we were there Miss Bowes came in, but did not stay many minutes. Miss Allen ask’d us to spend this evening with them. From there we went to Mrs Pierrepont’s. She was out and then to Mrs Chamier’s, where we found Miss Webb. We staid there a long time and then went to Camden Place and call’d at Mr Thornton and Mrs Simpson’s, both of whom were out. In our way home, we call’d at Mrs Drummond’s. She was preparing to go out in a Wheel Chair, so we did not see her. We met Miss Burmester at the Miss Allens’ in the evening, where she appears a great favourite, which she is not of mine. There is a manliness about her, which to me is not pleasant and her voice is particularly unpleasant and harsh. She appears very good temperd. The dear, kind hearted Miss Allens were quite distressd at our waking and when Prudence was putting our cloaks and opend the door for us she “hoped we would have John to walk home with us.”\n\nMr Wiltshire call’d while we were out, which vex’d us, as we have not seen him for some time.\n\nSaturday 4 April 1840\n\nA fine day, but every body said very cold. Neither Emma or I went out. Miss Barry call’d and while she was here Miss Grevile call’d and was very glad to meet her. They both sat some time, the latter long after Miss Barry and was extremely agreeable.\n\nI heard from Mrs Scott.\n\nSunday 5 April 1840\n\nA fine day. I went straight to St. John’s in the morning. Emma went to fetch Miss Pyne. I staid to the Communion, they did not. Saw Miss Grevile, who also staid. When we came out, we found Emma and Miss Pyne at the Hetling Pump. We walkd home with Miss Pyne and found Miss Chambers and William Pyne’s eldest boy Robert there. Robert appears a nice boy, the image of his father. We went to Church again in the afternoon. Mr de Visne did the whole Duty, both morning and afternoon. The Congregation was crowded in the morning and fuller than usual in the afternoon. We sat a long time with Miss Workman. In our way home we call’d at Admiral Shirley’s. They were at dinner, so we did not see them. We met Mrs Slade and Miss Fanny Hellican as we were going to Church the second time. They gave a favourable report of all the family. Miss Workman ask’d us to tea tomorrow.\n\nMonday 6 April 1840\n\nA fine day, but a very high and cold wind. We went out to call at two or three places, but at the top of Milsom Street we met Dr Cooper coming to us. He said if we were going to walk (he) would go with us. We took a long route up to Marlborough Street and call’d on Miss Grevile, who was not at home. We returned with the Dr as far as the White Hart, where we left him and went on to Mrs Cooper’s, where we sat half an hour with her and Miss Yeatman. As we were coming away, Miss H"
