        "text": "I’m very much looking forward to the year ahead, serving as Mayor to this wonderful seaside Town of ours.\n\nAlthough not Bognor Regis ‘born and bred’, I have spent many years here, including beginning my working life, as an apprentice at the old LEC site. Despite spending periods living in France and various other parts of the UK, I’ve always felt a certain draw to Bognor Regis, and am thrilled that this affiliation toward the Town, has led to me becoming your very proud Mayor.\n\nI hope this year will be an extremely insightful and enjoyable one and I’m sure I will learn more about the sterling work of the many charitable organisations, businesses and volunteer sectors, all of which serve to make Bognor Regis the community orientated and diverse place it is.\n\n2022 promises to be an exciting year, with enhancements being made to our tourist spots and of course, the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, coming up very shortly. What an honour it is to be a Platinum Jubilee Mayor!\n\nAccompanied by my Mayoress, Ms. Carole Brett, I look forward to meeting as many of you, our residents, as possible over the course of the next twelve months.\n\nAt the Annual Town Meeting of Electors, held in March 2022, the Chairman of the Policy and Resources Committee, Cllr. Bob Waterhouse, gave the following statement:\n\nI am delighted to present this year’s Budget Report to the Annual Electors.\n\nOur current total Precept for the 2022/2023 year was set at £969,817, a 2.26% increase in the Precept, equivalent to a 2.7% increase for a Band D property, or a £3.47 per annum increase, given the reduction in the Tax Base.\n\nThe Town Council has also prudently managed to increase our Reserves which provide for “rainy day” events and provide for Economic Development to allow for investments to increase our income when, and if, opportunities arise, which are much needed as Central Government funding continues to decline. The Reserves also exist to provide for capital expenditure, as required, when plant and equipment requires replacement.\n\nOne of the most noticeable activities your taxes fund is the Town Force team who maintain the beautiful floral displays across the Town, clear graffiti and keep our Town tidy and attractive, both for us and for visitors to our Town. Town Force also provide income to fund their activities by providing services to nearby parishes and private customers. Without their tireless work the Town would soon become a much less desirable place to live and visit.\n\nWe continue to be proud of our partnerships with outside bodies through which we contribute to CCTV, the seafront lights, the 2-hour free parking initiative, and the Business Wardens, all of which are of great benefit to our Town.\n\nThe Picturedrome, Bognor Regis's historic cinema, which is owned by the Town Council continues its impressive development under its independent operator's management team. Following on from the completion of the fourth screen and its Café, decorative works and adaptions to improve access from its original entrance are nearing completion and the Cinema remains an outstanding asset to the Town's cultural scene.\n\nAn important activity your taxes fund is Grant Aid - this is the mechanism through which Bognor Regis Town Council distributes funding to local organisations to help them carry out their activities to the benefit of residents and local businesses. To illustrate the nature of this support, distribution of funds to applicants as diverse as Citizens Advice, Girlguiding, Making Theatre Gaining Skills, My Sister’s House, St Wilfrid’s Hospice, Bognor Shopmobility, and many others will be made this year as well as event support for the 2022 Jubilee Street Party on the Prom, and the Southdowns Folk Festival. The Town Council has budgeted £46,000 for this financial year’s annual Grant Aid awards with applications invited from July.\n\nIn addition to providing financial assistance to outside bodies to hold their events, the Town Council fund our own events to enable local people to attend them free of charge. These include Funshine Days, Proms in the Park, Drive Through Time, and celebrations for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee this June, for which the Town Council have also signed up to the Queen’s Green Canopy and will be spending £5,000 on commemorative tree planting. We are also honoured to be organising the National Town Crier’s Guild Championship, which will be hosted here in Bognor Regis this summer.\n\nIn addition to organising free events, Bognor Regis Town Council also allocate funds to promoting the town as a whole to visitors, to help boost the economy and therefore helping our businesses. One such way in which this is achieved is through the Town Council’s annual investment is adorning the Town with Christmas Illuminations. These displays are always so well received, with praise given about the quality of the decorations. The Town Council will, once again, be funding the Christmas Illuminations this festive season with displays that it is hoped will be even more spectacular than ever this year.\n\nClimate change has never been more at the forefront of conversation, than it has been over the past twelve months. With COP 26 allowing an international platform for discussions on what urgent actions need to be taken globally, and nationwide initiatives to support tree planting such as The ‘Queen’s Green Canopy’, and the Great British Spring Clean, organised by Keep Britain Tidy, there really are plenty of opportunities for us all to get involved with helping to ‘turn the tide’ on climate change, including right here in Bognor Regis.\n\nThe Town Council declared themselves a Council of ‘Climate Emergency’ in 2019, leading to the formation of the Climate Emergency Focus Group, who work on a variety of projects including rewilding, encouraging sustainable lifestyles, and implementing more ‘bee-friendly’ planting. The group consists of Town and District Councillors, interested stakeholders, and members of the community, and reports to the Town Council’s Community, Engagement and Environment Committee. Local website bognor. today is a great way to stay up to date with the Focus Group’s initiatives and to gain access to the latest climate news and projects, affecting the Bognor Regis area.\n\nBeing a coastal town, a lot of focus, rightly so, is on the impact of climate change on the biodiversity of the sea and marine habitat. Projects such as the ‘Sussex Kelp Restoration Project’ and the Bognor Fishermen’s Association, who are looking to bring back sustainable fishing to Bognor Regis, are just some of the efforts going on right now, at such a pivotal moment in the recovery of our seas after years of litter, pollution, and a decline in sea habitats.\n\nAlthough the issue of climate change seems overwhelming when we look at tackling the issue as a whole, there is plenty we can do as individuals, specifically in our gardens, which will make a big difference. The RHS website contains plenty of tips and advice for make better and ‘greener’ use of our gardens:\n\n·Greening up your garden – Plants more trees, bushes and shrubs, all of which help remove carbo dioxide (a big contributor to climate change). from the atmosphere\n\n·Plant a diverse range of plants in your garden – Planting a variety of plants will help with resilience, ensuring at least some plants will survive in diverse weather. Effort should be made to planting of differing pollinator friendly plants\n\n·Adopt new ways of growing – Share any petrol-powered tools needed and reduce use of these where possible. Green roofs and walls can cool your home in the summer and insulate it in the winter, saving on energy bills too!\n\n·Be water-wise – Use water butts where possible, which not only help with reducing the pressure on drains during flooding, but they also help conserve water during droughts. Avoid using hoses in the summer months\n\n·Avoid peat-based products - Peatlands store huge amounts of carbon, making them a real disaster for trying to combat climate change. Harvesting the peat to use for composts also destroys the biodiversity of the land it’s harvested on. Plenty of good quality peat-free compost is available, at all good nurseries.\n\n·Compost your garden and kitchen waste – homemade compost improves the structure of your compost as well as providing healthier soil. Healthy soil also captures carbon and the less materials thrown away, the less that will end up in landfill, emitting huge amounts of green house gases!\n\n·Reduce- reuse-recycle-reinvest\n\n·Go organic – Avoid use of chemicals in the garden. If necessary, choose products with a lower carbon footprint, such as organic ones\n\n·Beware invaders – Never bring plants home from trips abroad, and only shop for plants at reputably suppliers, to avoid brining new pests and diseases into our local gardeners.\n\nBognor Regis in Bloom, a Working Group of the Town Council, works to actively encourage positive gardening habits. For this year’s Annual Gardening Competition, the Group will be taking into account some of the RHS ‘top tips’ for sustainable and environmentally friendly gardening, in their judging criteria.\n\nRecently holding a ‘Climate Change and Biodiversity’ information Open Day, the Working Group provided visitors with plenty of useful tips and handouts on ‘going green’ in the garden. Sussex Wildlife Trust, Brick Kiln Garden Centre and Bognor Regis’ Tree Warden were just some of the experts at the Open Day, answering questions and making presentations.\n\nThe Working Group also partakes in the ‘Great British Spring Clean’, organised by Keep Britain Tidy, this year working in conjunction with Sussex Wildlife Trust, to record the items collected from their beach clean.\n\nBognor Regis is very proud to have two Tree Wardens, who work hard to not only plant and maintain trees in the Town, but who also want to help educate ‘Bognorians’ on the benefits of trees in the battle against Climate change and air pollution.\n\nIf you are from a local school and would like to book a FREE talk from one of our Tree Wardens, or help with planting trees on your school grounds or you would like more information on Bognor Regis in Bloom and how to join, then please contact the In Bloom & Allotment Committee Clerk, Steve Davis: stevedavis@bognorregis.gov.uk\n\nIn 1746 Richard Hotham set up in business selling hats, the trade for which he is mostly remembered as ‘Hotham the Hatter.’ hence the name of the public house The Hatters in the Queensway and the sun bonnet sculpture on the corner of the Bon Marche shop (now Bonito Lounge) in London Road.\n\nBy the 1750s he moved to improved premises on the corner of the old Hungerford Market in the Strand, the site of today’s Charring Cross Station. It was during this period that Richard Hotham issued copper tokens to advertise his hat selling business, and they bore the Searle Street address.\n\nFor a number of years it was believed that Richard Hotham only had one wife, Francis, however recently it has been discovered that this is not correct. Apparently Mrs. Francis Hotham died in 1760 and was buried on 14th August of that year. Within eight months on 7th April 1761, he was to re-marry this time to Barbara Huddart of the parish to St. Margaret in Westminster. Barbara became Lady Hotham following Richard receiving his Knighthood in 1769 when he was only aged 46. The knowledge of his second wife was to change much of the known history of Sir Richard Hotham and only goes to show, that research should continue, even after all the facts seem to be known!\n\nDuring the 1760’s Richard Hotham joined the East India Company and became known as a ‘ship’s husband’ with four ships under his control. Also around this time he was involved in building property at Merton Place, which was later, the home of Admiral Nelson. He then built Merton Grove, which today would have been near the site of the South Wimbledon Tube Station.\n\nRegeneration is alive and well in Bognor Regis, with many exciting plans now coming to fruition. Place St Maur, which has long been a topic of discussion, will become an innovative and useable plaza area with modern architecture, water features including shallow pools for water play, an area to host events, coastal planting and new seating. Place St Maur will surely become a focal point for activities and events, but will also forge a much-needed link between the Town Centre and seafront.\n\nAnother exciting project already in the first phase of improvements is the ‘levelling up’ project at The Regis Centre. The upgrades planned will allow for the Alexandra Theatre to put on larger shows, provide more comfortable facilities, and therefore increase the number of people using both the Centre, which is fantastic for community groups, and the Theatre, all of which means good news for our Town.\n\nWorks are also imminent on the Sunken Gardens, following public consultation by Arun District Council, to enhance the quality of the landscape and encourage more visitors to the gardens. Along with significant refurbishment to the play area, ramps are planned to be installed at the new southern entrance to the gardens, to improve accessibility for all, with repairs agreed for the current railings, new benches to be installed, poor-quality trees to be replaced and new low-growing ornamental planting to create a centre piece in the middle of the gardens, just a few elements in the works for the ‘new look’ Sunken Gardens.\n\nIt has been so pleasing to see our Town Centre benefit from some eye-catching installations over the last couple of months. From the BID’s colourful banners in London Road and High Street, to the festoon lighting installed at York Road, these projects to improve the visual impact of our Town Centre were made possible by some phenomenal partnership working between the Bognor Regis BID, Bognor Regis businesses, Bognor Regis Town Council and Arun District Council. You might have also noticed the bright vinyl’s at each end of The Arcade, provided by Arun District Council, which have created a welcoming entrance to the Town Centre from the seafront.\n\nWhat a fantastic boost to the already exciting plans for regeneration on the seafront, to hear that Public Realm funding has been awarded to Bognor Regis! West Sussex County Council recently announced the allocation of £431,00 to be spent on improvements at The Esplanade to link with other investments being made to the Town. Upgrading the seafront infrastructure will provide improved public realm and crossing points across the Highway between the beach and the Town, creating an accessible and connected community space.\n\nThe project will look to create “attractive, sustainable, and accessible public spaces, enhancing key areas linking the Town Centre to the seafront, and improve public realm landscape for residents and visitors to enjoy, with new planting, and sustainable urban drainage systems”.\n\nAs well as improving the aesthetics, it is hoped that improvements will support in reducing carbon levels, making Bognor Regis a healthier and ultimately happy place to live!"
