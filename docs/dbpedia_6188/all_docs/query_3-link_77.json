        "text": "Bognor! However one says the name, it doesn’t whisper romance. Although George V felt so braced after recuperating there in 1929 that he bestowed the suffix “Regis”, his supposed last words dismissed the town, in the typically concise and salty language of a Sailor King. His aperçu has stuck in the national consciousness, having been both alliterative and prophetic.\n\nBugger West Wittering has no ring: all white sands and beach huts, it remains as joyously middle class as when the Dimblebys went there for family holidays in the 1950s. Bugger Worthing? Impossible –- despite its association with Oscar Wilde. But Bognor, which greeted the 1960s by opening a Butlins and knocking down much of the town centre, to replace it with singularly charmless redevelopment, has been stuffed.\n\nYet if history has been unkind, the weather hasn’t: it has become the sunniest place in the kingdom. Indeed, if Bognor’s Mediterraean conditions become the norm, this seaside town – like others along the south coast – will have to think hard about its positioning. The time has come to rediscover its heritage as a playground by the sea.\n\nBognor was originally a fishing village. The transformation was begun in the 1780s, when Sir Richard Hotham began buying building plots. Described in The Bognor Guide of 1838 as “a wealthy knight, who in the course of successful commercial speculations, amassed a large fortune”, Hotham was a hatter from south London.\n\nHe was rather less of a success as a promoter of a resort. “No pains were left untried to make Bognor a popular abode,” says the Guide. But “it is a natural propensity of the human mind to deceive itself”, and the economics did not stack up.\n\nWhere Hotham failed, the Regency succeeded. By then, the Prince Regent had made Brighton so raffishly fashionable that the overspill could support the satellite of Bognor, a few miles along the coast. But the stopping and starting meant that the original vision for the town had lost focus. It grew up piecemeal and jolly, but did not cohere.\n\nThe 20th century did not help knit it together. Package holidays saw tourists desert Bognor and Butlins for sun and sangria. It was not the only seaside town to suffer, but some have emerged into the 21st century in a seedy, but more intact state. Visitors to Margate’s new Tuner centre have been stunned by the scale of the town’s Victorian terraces; Thanet sank so low that, mercifully, it escaped the demolition ball. Folkestone still has its lawns and cliff-side gardens: they are forming the basis of a revival. Fashion has already returned to resorts in Cornwall, Devon, Suffolk and Norfolk. Bognor remains stubbornly untouched.\n\nIt has perhaps set its sights low. Now part of a National Park, the countryside around Bognor is miraculously beautiful, having been kept that way through the agency of the Cowdray, Petworth and Goodwood estates. Midhurst is correspondingly affluent. Butlins may have rebuilt itself, but the rest of the town, however sunkissed, remains an enclave of dowdiness. Come on, Bognor, the seaside is meant to fun!\n\nIn these days of rising expectations, it ought also to be chic. You don’t have to be Cannes or Le Touquet to be smart; look what next door Littlehampton have done with their East Beach Cafe – it has won more than 20 design awards. That’s somewhere that the in-crowd like to relax in the sun. Bognor is missing a trick.\n\nAdmittedly, with its pebbly beach, Bognor does not have Ramsgate’s famous sands. But Bognor does have a supreme resource in its pier. Piers were a peculiarly British triumph of Victorian engineering. Other countries had casinos, our answer was the pier (just as the British equivalent of festas, carnivals and bull-running was the village fete). Built in 1865, Bognor’s is a fine example of the genre, albeit in a parlous condition, if not reduced to something of a stump. But let our hopes be as sunny as the West Sussex skies. Bring on the Guggenheim effect. Rebuild the pier; riches will follow."
