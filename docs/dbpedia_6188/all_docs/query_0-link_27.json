        "text": "The Local legacy of saint wilfrid\n\nWilfrid (634-709) is one of the greatest and also one of the most controversial English Saints. He directly influenced the move away from Celtic to the more orderly Roman church practices and is best known for championing and winning the case for the Roman, as opposed to the Celtic method of calculating the date of Easter at the famous Synod of Whitby in 664.\n\nHe became Bishop of York with a See covering the whole of Northumbria, built magnificent stone churches at Ripon and Hexham. He acquired vast landholdings and established monasteries in Northumbria, Mercia, Sussex and the Isle of Wight and converted Sussex, the last vestige of paganism, to Christianity.\n\nHe was the confidant of kings and queens but made many powerful enemies and was twice banished from Northumbria. He made three journeys on foot and horseback through Europe to Rome and was not afraid to seek papal jurisdiction over both crown and church where he felt badly treated. His life was threatened many times being shipwrecked and nearly killed by natives off the coast of Sussex, imprisoned in Northumbria by the king and twice nearly murdered whilst travelling abroad.\n\nWhen Wilfrid was banished from Northumbria in 680 he travelled south seeking the protection of first Mercia and then Wessex royal households but was subsequently banished from each as a result of blood line connections of the royal families back to the Northumbrian crown.\n\nFinally Wilfrid travelled to Sussex and fortunately was welcomed by king Aethelwealh of the South Saxons who presented to Wilfrid an estate of eighty seven hides to form a monastery at Selsey – which in Latin [Insula Vituli Marini] means ‘the island of the seal’.\n\nIn 681 Wilfrid became the 1st Bishop of Selsey and the cathedral seat remained at Selsey until bishop Stigand c 1076 when it was moved to its present site in Chichester.\n\nThe present St. Wilfrid’s Chapel at Church Norton is the 13th century chancel of a large Norman church that is thought to be located very close to Wilfrid’s original monastery and church. The main part of the current church was removed in 1864 and rebuilt in the centre of Selsey as St. Peter’s church to serve the growing population of this seaside resort.\n\nCaedwalla, an exiled son of king Centwine of Wessex, was befriended and helped by Wilfrid c681 and in 685 with a band of lawless followers Caedwalla ravaged Sussex and killed king Aethelwealh before being repulsed. In 686 after becoming king of Wessex he finally subdued the South Saxons and went on to ravage Kent and then the Isle of Wight (he gave a quarter of the island to Wilfrid).\n\nIn 686 king Caedwalla issued a charter confirming the rights and territories previously given to Wilfrid by king Aethelwealh and the estate of the Hundred of Pagham including Shripney, Charlton, Bognor, Bersted, Crimsham, Mundham and Tangmere.\n\nThe handing over of the charter is brilliantly depicted in the Lambert Barnard mural in the south transept of Chichester Cathedral commissioned by Bishop Robert Sherburne (bishop 1508-1536) in the 1530s.\n\nNote: Photograph taken and reproduced with the kind permission of the Dean and Chapter of Chichester Cathedral and no reproduction of these photographs is permitted without their permission\n\nThe Caedwalla charter mentions ‘his [Wilfrid’s] brethren serving God at the church of St. Andrew on the eastern shore of the harbour’ and it is presumed that the remains are next to vicarage of the present church of St. Thomas a Becket, Pagham. The remains are limited to part of the wall between the nave and the chancel and are in are in the garden of Little Welbourne which was built c1706. St. Andrews was secularised in 1626 and ended up being used as a garage.\n\nThe site in Bognor of this very early chapel of the parish church of Pagham is not known and was standing unserved as long ago as 1384. Lindsey Fleming in his History of Pagham states that in 1317 there was an instruction from the Archbishop that the10th July in each year was to be remembered as the dedication festival of Pagham church. In 1538 there was correspondence between the vicar of Bersted and the Prior of Canterbury where the Prior stated that the chapel fell into the sea along with many houses 18 -20 years earlier i.e. about 1520.\n\nIn 1821 a Bognor builder Daniel Wonham erected as a speculation a chapel of ease St. John the Evangelist in the Steyne.\n\nOn Friday 25th January 1822 the Service of Consecration and Dedication of the Chapel of Ease in the Hamlet of Bognor was conducted by his Grace, Charles Manners Sutton, Archbishop of Canterbury (Bp of Norwich 1792, AB Canterbury 1805-28).\n\nThe shield which bears his coat of arms and the shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms, were donated by Thomas Smith of Bersted. After the demolition of the chapel the shield was transferred to the west wall of St. John’s church in London Road and now hangs above the west door entrance to the porch in St. Wilfrid’s church.\n\nA Gothic style tower was added complete with castellated parapet and pointed-arch window and this became a feature of Bognor’s skyline.\n\nThe tower contained a clock and 4cwt bell named “Mary Ann” which had been donated by the Rev Charles and Miss Baumgarten of Aldwick at a cost of £200. Miss Baumgarten also donated a weather vane for the tower and a Captain S H Baumgarten a bible and prayer book for the reading desk.\n\nThe Old Testament part of the 1833 bible was rediscovered in April, 2007 and has now been refurbished. The New Testament section was discovered in May 2008.\n\nIn Fleming’s ‘History of Pagham’, regarding old St. John’s, it states – ‘The tower was added by the liberal aid of the Rev. Charles Baumgarten, also the belfry and tower clock; his sister, Miss Baumgarten, giving £25 towards the handsome vane surmounting the tower’. This confirms that Miss Baumgarten was the Rev. Charles’s sister. In the IGI there is a reference to Mary Anne Charlotte Baumgarten, daughter of Samuel Henry Baumgarten and Ann was baptised at Petworth on 21st August 1805.\n\nThe relationship of Captain Samuel Henry Baumgarten to the Rev. Charles Baumgarten and his sister Mary Ann has yet to be identified.\n\nThere has for some time been talk of a new church to supply the growing necessities of the west end of Bognor, and we hear that all the preliminaries are now settled and that immediate steps will be taken to carry it out.
