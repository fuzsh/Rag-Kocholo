See the model of Hotham Park House, which still stands in Hotham Park. Read how in 1929, after King George V convalesced at Craigweil House, Bognor was bestowed with the royal suffix ‘Regis’.\n\nMary Wheatland\n\nCome and see Mary Wheatland – Bognor’s Famous Bathing Lady, standing next to an original bathing machine in our new Seaside Room.\n\nEsplanade Theatre\n\nFor those who have nostalgic memories of the theatres in Bognor Regis, see the scale model of the Esplanade Theatre, which stood where the skate park now stands just down the road from the Museum.\n\nFamous People of Bognor\n\nHave you found any of the Blue Plaques around the town? Find out about the many famous people that have lived in Bognor.\n\nArt Deco Bus Station\n\nIf you're interested in buses and / or Art Deco, you will love our model of the Southdowns Bus Station, which once dominated the High Street.\n\nRon Simpson Wireless Collection\n\nDo not miss the Ron Simpson Wireless collection and see displays of radios from yesteryear, plus some early TV sets. You can also have a go at sending a Morse Code message. A dressing-up box full of 1920s style clothes allows youngsters to try their Charleston moves in front of the mirror and take a photo or two as a memento of their visit.\n\nResearch Room\n\nThe Museum boasts it’s very own research room, named after late former Chairman, Kay Fall. Open every Thursday from 10am to 1pm during normal Museum opening hours, it can be accessed at other times by prior arrangement. Researchers can access our fantastic, superbly indexed (thanks to the late Shelia Smith) catalogue of thousands of photographs and documents. The room is used for temporary exhibitions and can also be hired for small meetings, for which refreshments can be provided.\n\nWe welcome families and children!\n\nIn addition to the dressing-up box, there are often quizzes to help keep the youngsters busy, a colouring table and a very lazy cat to find. Plus there are three Listen & Learn points where you can listen to a Cobbler, Maid and ex-bus employee. And yes, there a lots of other buttons to press! We also have seasonal events for families at Easter, Halloween and Christmas."
