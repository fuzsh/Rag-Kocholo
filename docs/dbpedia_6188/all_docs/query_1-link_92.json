        "text": "P:01\n\nï»¿\n\nP:02\n\nAbout the Book Twenty years ago, Bill Bryson went on a trip around Britain to celebrate the green and kindly island that had become his adopted country. The hilarious book that resulted, Notes from a Small Island, was taken to the nationâs heart and became the best-selling travel book ever, and was also voted in a BBC poll the book that best represents Britain. Now, to mark the twentieth anniversary of that modern classic, Bryson makes a brand-new journey around Britain to see what has changed. Following (but not too closely) a route he dubs the Bryson Line, from Bognor Regis to Cape Wrath, by way of places that many people never get to at all, Bryson sets out to rediscover the wondrously beautiful, magnificently eccentric, endearingly unique country that he thought he knew but doesnât altogether recognize any more. Yet, despite Britainâs occasional failings and more or less eternal bewilderments, Bill Bryson is still pleased to call our rainy island home. And not just because of the cream teas, a noble history, and an extra day off at Christmas. Once again, with his matchless homing instinct for the funniest and quirkiest, his unerring eye for the idiotic, the endearing, the ridiculous and the scandalous, Bryson gives us an acute and perceptive insight into all that is best and worst about Britain today.\n\nP:03\n\nContents Cover About the Book Title Page Dedication Map Prologue 1 Bugger Bognor! 2 Seven Sisters 3 Dover 4 London 5 Motopia 6 A Great Park 7 Into the Forest 8 Beside the Seaside 9 Day Trips 10 To the West 11 Devon 12 Cornwall 13 Ancient Britain 14 East Anglia 15 Cambridge 16 Oxford and About 17 The Midlands 18 Itâs So Bracing! 19 The Peak District 20 Wales 21 The North 22 Lancashire 23 The Lakes 24 Yorkshire 25 Durham and the Northeast 26 To Cape Wrath (and Considerably Beyond)\n\nP:04\n\nBrief afterword and acknowledgements About the Author Also by Bill Bryson Copyright\n\nP:06\n\nTo James, Rosie and Daphne. Welcome.\n\nP:08\n\nPrologue I ONE OF THE THINGS that happens when you get older is that you discover lots of new ways to hurt yourself. Recently, in France, I was hit square on the head by an automatic parking barrier, something I donât think I could have managed in my younger, more alert years. There are really only two ways to get hit on the head by a parking barrier. One is to stand underneath a raised barrier and purposely allow it to fall on you. That is the easy way, obviously. The other method â and this is where a little diminished mental capacity can go a long way â is to forget the barrier you have just seen rise, step into the space it has vacated and stand with lips pursed while considering your next move, and then be taken completely by surprise as it slams down on your head like a sledgehammer on a spike. That is the method I went for. Let me say right now that this was a serious barrier â like a scaffolding pole with momentum â and it didnât so much fall as crash back into its cradle. The venue for this adventure in cranial trauma was an open-air car park in a pleasant coastal resort in Normandy called Etretat, not far from Deauville, where my wife and I had gone for a few days. I was alone at this point, however, trying to find my way to a clifftop path at the far side of the car park, but the way was blocked by the barrier, which was too low for a man of my dimensions to duck under and much too high to vault. As I stood hesitating, a car pulled up, the driver took a ticket, the barrier rose and the driver drove on through. This was the moment that I chose to step forward\n\nP:09\n\nand to stand considering my next move, little realizing that it would be mostly downwards. Well, I have never been hit so startlingly and hard. Suddenly I was both the most bewildered and relaxed person in France. My legs buckled and folded beneath me and my arms grew so independently lively that I managed to smack myself in the face with my elbows. For the next several minutes my walking was, for the most part, involuntarily sideways. A kindly lady helped me to a bench and gave me a square of chocolate, which I found I was still clutching the next morning. As I sat there, another car passed through and the barrier fell back into place with a reverberating clang. It seemed impossible that I could have survived such a violent blow. But then, because I am a little paranoid and given to private histrionics, I became convinced that I had in fact sustained grave internal injuries, which had not yet revealed themselves. Blood was pooling inside my head, like a slowly filling bath, and at some point soon my eyes would roll upwards, I would issue a dull groan, and quietly tip over, never to rise again. The positive side of thinking you are about to die is that it does make you glad of the little life that is left to you. I spent most of the following three days gazing appreciatively at Deauville, admiring its tidiness and wealth, going for long walks along its beach and promenade or just sitting and watching the rolling sea and blue sky. Deauville is a very fine town. There are far worse places to tip over. One afternoon as my wife and I sat on a bench facing the English Channel, I said to her, in my new reflective mood, âI bet whatever seaside town is directly opposite on the English side will be depressed and struggling, while Deauville remains well off and lovely. Why is that, do you suppose?â âNo idea,â my wife said. She was reading a novel and didnât accept that I was about to die. âWhat is opposite us?â I asked. âNo idea,â she said and turned a page. âWeymouth?â âNo idea.â âHove maybe?â âWhich part of âno ideaâ are you struggling to get on top of?â I looked on her smartphone. (Iâm not allowed a smartphone of my own because I would lose it.) I donât know how accurate her maps are â they\n\nP:10\n\noften urge us to go to Michigan or California when we are looking for some place in Worcestershire â but the name that came up on the screen was Bognor Regis. I didnât think anything of this at the time, but soon it would come to seem almost prophetic. II I first came to England at the other end of my life, when I was still quite young, just twenty. In those days, for a short but intensive period, a very high proportion of all in the world that was worth taking note of came out of Britain. The Beatles, James Bond, Mary Quant and miniskirts, Twiggy and Justin de Villeneuve, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylorâs love life, Princess Margaretâs love life, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, suit jackets without collars, television series like The Avengers and The Prisoner, spy novels by John le CarrÃ© and Len Deighton, Marianne Faithfull and Dusty Springfield, quirky movies starring David Hemmings and Terence Stamp that we didnât quite get in Iowa, Harold Pinter plays that we didnât get at all, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, That Was the Week That Was, the Profumo scandal â practically everything really. Advertisements in magazines like the New Yorker and Esquire were full of British products in a way they never would be again â Gilbeyâs and Tanqueray gin, Harris tweeds, BOAC airliners, Aquascutum suits and Viyella shirts, Keens felted hats, Alan Paine sweaters, Daks trousers, MG and Austin Healey sports cars, a hundred varieties of Scotch whisky. It was clear that if you wanted quality and suavity in your life, it was British goods that were in large part going to supply it. Not all of this made a great deal of sense even then, it must be said. A popular cologne of the day was called Pub. I am not at all sure what resonances that was supposed to evoke. I have been drinking in England for forty years and I canât say that I have ever encountered anything in a pub that I would want to rub on my face. Because of all the attention we gave Britain, I thought I knew a fair amount about the place, but I quickly discovered upon arriving that I was very wrong. I couldnât even speak my own language there. In the first few days, I\n\nP:11\n\nfailed to distinguish between collar and colour, khaki and car key, letters and lettuce, bed and bared, karma and calmer. Needing a haircut, I ventured into a unisex hairdresserâs in Oxford, where the proprietress, a large and vaguely forbidding woman, escorted me to a chair, and there informed me crisply: âYour hair will be cut by a vet today.â I was taken aback. âLike a person who treats sick animals?â I said, quietly horrified. âNo, her name is Yvette,â she replied and with the briefest of gazes into my face made it clear that I was the most exhausting idiot that she had encountered in some time. In a pub I asked what kind of sandwiches they had. âHam and cheese,â the man said. âOh, yes please,â I said. âYes please what?â he said. âYes please, ham and cheese,â I said, but with less confidence. âNo, itâs ham or cheese,â he explained. âYou donât do them both together?â âNo.â âOh,â I said, surprised, then leaned towards him and in a low, confidential tone said: âWhy not? Too flavourful?â He stared at me. âIâll have cheese then, please,â I said contritely. When the sandwich came, the cheese was extravagantly shredded â I had never seen a dairy product distressed before serving â and accompanied by what I now know was Branston pickle, but what looked to me then like what you find when you stick your hand into a clogged sump. I nibbled it tentatively and was pleased to discover that it was delicious. Gradually it dawned on me that I had found a country that was wholly strange to me and yet somehow marvellous. It is a feeling that has never left me. My time in Britain describes a kind of bell curve, starting at the bottom left- hand corner in the âKnows Almost Nothing at Allâ zone, and rising in a gradual arc to âPretty Thorough Acquaintanceshipâ at the top. Having attained this summit, I assumed that I would remain there permanently, but recently I have begun to slide down the other side towards ignorance and bewilderment again as increasingly I find myself living in a country that I donât altogether\n\nP:12\n\nrecognize. It is a place full of celebrities whose names I donât know and talents I cannot discern, of acronyms (BFF, TMI, TOWIE) that have to be explained to me, of people who seem to be experiencing a different kind of reality from the one I know. I am constantly at a loss in this new world. Recently I closed my door on a caller because I couldnât think what else to do with him. He was a meter reader. At first I was pleased to see him. We havenât had a meter reader at our house since Edward Heath was prime minister, so I let him in gladly and even fetched a stepladder so that he could climb up and get a clear reading. It was only when he departed and returned a minute later that I began to regret our deepening relationship. âSorry, I also need to read the meter in the menâs room,â he told me. âI beg your pardon?â âIt says here there is a second meter in the menâs room.â âWell, we donât have a menâs room because this is a house, you see.â âIt says here itâs a school.â âWell, itâs not. Itâs a house. You were just in it. Did you see roomfuls of young people?â He thought hard for a minute. âDo you mind if I have a look around?â âI beg your pardon?â âJust a little look. Wonât take five minutes.â âYou think youâre going to find a menâs room that we have somehow overlooked?â âYou never know!â he said brightly. âIâm shutting the door now because I donât know what else to do,â I said and shut the door. I could hear him making mild bleatings through the wood. âBesides I have an important appointment,â I called back through the wood. And it was true. I did have an important appointment â one, as it happens, that has everything to do with the book that follows. I was about to go to Eastleigh to take a British citizenship test. The irony of this was not lost on me. Just as I was becoming thoroughly remystified by life in modern Britain, I was being summoned to demonstrate that I understood the place.\n\nP:13\n\nIII For a long time, there were two ways to become a British citizen. The first, the trickier but paradoxically much the more common method, was to find your way into a British womb and wait for nine months. The other way was to fill out some forms and swear an oath. Since 2005, however, people in the second category have additionally had to demonstrate proficiency in English and pass a knowledge test. I was excused the language test because English is my native tongue, but no one is excused the knowledge test, and itâs tough. No matter how well you think you know Britain, you donât know the things you need to know to pass the Life in Britain Knowledge Test. You need to know, for instance, who Sake Dean Mahomet was. (He was the man who introduced shampoo to Britain. Honestly.) You need to know by what other name the 1944 Education Act is known. (The Butler Act.) You need to know when life peerages were created (1958) and in what year the maximum length of a working day for women and children was reduced to ten hours (1847). You have to be able to identify Jenson Button. (No point asking why.) You can be denied citizenship if you donât know the number of member states in the Commonwealth, who Britainâs enemies in the Crimean War were, the percentages of people who describe themselves as Sikh, Muslim, Hindu or Christian, and the actual name of the Big Ben tower. (Itâs the Elizabeth Tower.) You even have to know a few things that arenât in fact true. If, for instance, you are asked, âWhat are the two most distant points on the British mainland?â you have to say, âLandâs End and John oâGroatsâ even though they are not. This is one tough test. To prepare, I ordered the full set of study guides, consisting of a shiny paperback called Life in the United Kingdom: A Guide for New Residents and two auxiliary volumes: an Official Study Guide, which tells you how to use the first book (essentially, start at page one and move through the following pages one at a time, in order), and a volume of Official Practice Questions and Answers, containing seventeen practice tests. Naturally, I did a couple of these before reading a word of the study guides and was horrified at how poorly I did. (When you are asked âWhat are Welsh MPs called?â the answer is not âGareth and Dafydd mostly.â)\n\nP:14\n\nThe study guide is an interesting book, nicely modest, a little vacuous at times, but with its heart in the right place. Britain, you learn, is a country that cherishes fair play, is rather good at art and literature, values good manners, and has often shown itself to be commendably inventive, especially around things that run on steam. The people are a generally decent lot who garden, go for walks in the country, eat roast beef and Yorkshire pudding on Sundays (unless they are Scottish, in which case they may go for haggis). They holiday at the seaside, obey the Green Cross Code, queue patiently, vote sensibly, respect the police, venerate the monarch, and practise moderation in all things. Occasionally they go to a public house to drink two units or fewer of good English ale and to have a game of pool or skittles. (You sometimes feel that the people who wrote the guidebook should get out more.) At times the book is so careful about being inoffensive that it doesnât actually say anything at all, as in this discussion, given here in full, of the contemporary music scene: âThere are many different venues and musical events that take place across the UK.â Thank you for that rich insight. (And I donât like to be a smart alec, but venues donât take place. They just are.) Sometimes the book is simply wrong, as when it declares that Landâs End and John oâGroats are maximally remote, and sometimes it is dubious and wrong. It cites the actor Anthony Hopkins as the kind of person Britons can be proud of without apparently pausing to reflect that Anthony Hopkins is now an American citizen living in California. It also misspells his first name. It calls the literary area of Westminster Abbey âPoetâs Cornerâ, perhaps in the belief that they only keep one poet at a time there. Generally, I try not to be overfussy about these things, but if it is a requirement that people who take the test should have a full command of English, then perhaps it would be an idea to make certain that those responsible for the test demonstrate a similar proficiency. And so, after a monthâs hard study, the day of my test arrived. My instructions were to present myself at the appointed hour at a place called Wessex House in Eastleigh, Hampshire, the nearest testing centre to my home. Eastleigh is a satellite of Southampton and appears to have been bombed heavily during the Second World War, though perhaps not quite heavily enough. It is an interestingly unmemorable place â not numbingly ugly but not attractive either; not wretchedly poor but not prosperous; not completely dead in the\n\nP:15\n\ncentre, but clearly not thriving. The bus station was just an outer wall of Sainsburyâs with a glass marquee over it, evidently to give pigeons a dry place to shit. Like many British towns, Eastleigh has closed its factories and workshops, and instead is directing all its economic energies into the making and drinking of coffee. There were essentially two types of shop in the town: empty shops and coffee shops. Some of the empty shops, according to signs in their windows, were in the process of being converted into coffee shops, and many of the coffee shops, judging by their level of custom, looked as if they werenât far off becoming empty shops again. I am no economist, but I am guessing that thatâs what is known as a virtuous circle. One or two more adventurous entrepreneurs had opened pound stores or betting shops, and a few charities had taken over other abandoned premises, but on the whole Eastleigh seemed to be a place where you could either have a cup of coffee or sit and watch pigeons defecate. I had a cup of coffee, for the sake of the economy, watched a pigeon defecate across the way, then presented myself at Wessex House for my test. Five of us were present for testing on this particular morning. We were shown to a roomful of desks, each with a computer screen and a mouse sitting on a plain mat, and seated so that we couldnât see anyone elseâs screen. Once settled, we were given a practice test of four questions to make sure we were comfortably in command of our mouse and mousepad. Because it was a practice test, the questions were encouragingly easy, along the lines of: Manchester United is: (a) a political party (b) a dance band (c) an English football team It took about fifteen seconds for four of us to answer the practice questions, but one lady â pleasant, middle-aged, slightly plumpish, I am guessing from one of those Middle Eastern countries where they eat a lot of sticky sweets â took considerably longer. Twice the supervisor came to see if she was all right. I passed the time discreetly looking in my desk drawers â they were unlocked but empty â and seeing if there was any way to have fun moving a cursor around a blank screen. There isnât.\n\nP:16\n\nAt length the woman announced that she had finished and the supervisor came to check her work. He bent to her screen and in a tone of quiet amazement said: âYouâve missed them all.â She beamed uncertainly, not sure if this was an achievement. âDo you want to try them again?â the supervisor asked helpfully. âYouâre entitled to try again.â The woman gave every appearance of having no clear idea of what was going on, but gamely elected to press on, and so the test began. The first question was: âYouâve seen Eastleigh. Are you sure you want to stay in Britain?â Actually, I donât recall what the first question was or any of those that followed. We werenât allowed to bring anything to the desk, so I couldnât take notes or tap my teeth thoughtfully with a pencil. The test consisted of twenty-four multiple-choice questions and took only about three minutes. You either know the answers or you donât. I presented myself at the supervisorâs desk upon completion, and we waited together while the computer checked my answers, a process that took about as long as the test itself, and at last he told me with a smile that I had passed, but he couldnât tell me exactly how I did. The computer only indicated pass or fail. âIâll just print out your result,â he said. This took another small age. I was hoping for a smart parchment-like certificate, like you get when you climb Sydney Harbour Bridge or do a cookery course with Waitrose, but it was just a faintly printed letter confirming that I was certified as intellectually fit for life in modern Britain. Beaming like the lady from the Middle East (who appeared to be hunting around for a keyboard when last I glimpsed her), I left the building feeling pleased, even a little exhilarated. The sun was shining. Across the way at the bus station, two men in bomber jackets were having a morning aperitif from matching cans of lager. A pigeon picked at a cigarette butt and squeezed out a little shit. Life in modern Britain, it seemed to me, was pretty good. IV A day or so later, I met my publisher, a kindly and much loved fellow named Larry Finlay, for lunch in London, to discuss a subject for my next book. Larry lives in quiet dread that I will suggest some ludicrously uncommercial\n\nP:17\n\ntopic â a biography of Mamie Eisenhower, perhaps, or something on Canada â and so always tries to head me off with an alternative suggestion. âDo you know,â he said, âitâs twenty years since you wrote Notes from a Small Island?â âReally?â I replied, amazed at how much past one can accumulate without any effort at all. âEver thought about a sequel?â His tone was casual, but in his eyes I could see little glinting pound signs where his irises normally were. I considered for a moment. âActually there is a certain timeliness to that,â I said. âIâm just about to take out British citizenship, you know.â âReally?â Larry said. The pound signs brightened and began to pulsate ever so slightly. âYouâre giving up your American citizenship?â âNo, I keep it. Iâll have British and American both.â Larry was suddenly racing ahead. Marketing plans were forming in his head. Underground posters â not the really big ones, the much smaller kind â were springing to mind. âYou can take stock of your new country,â he said. âI donât want to end up going back to all the same places and writing about all the same things.â âThen go to different places,â Larry agreed. âGo toâ â he searched for a name to nominate, somewhere no oneâs ever been â âBognor Regis.â I looked at him with interest. âThatâs the second reference I have heard to Bognor Regis this week,â I said. âThink of it as a sign,â Larry said. Later that afternoon, at home, I pulled out my ancient and falling-apart AA Complete Atlas of Britain (so old that it shows the M25 as a dotted aspiration) just to have a look. Apart from anything else I was curious to see what is the longest distance you can travel in Britain in a straight line. It is most assuredly not from Landâs End to John oâGroats, despite what my official study guide had said. (What it said, for the record, is: âThe longest distance on the mainland is from John oâGroats on the north coast of Scotland to Landâs End in the south-west corner of England. It is about 870 miles.â) For one thing, the northernmost outcrop of mainland is not John oâGroats but Dunnet Head, eight miles to the west, and at least six other nubbins of land along that same stretch of coastline are more northerly than John oâGroats. But the real issue is that a journey from Landâs End to John oâGroats would\n\nP:18\n\nrequire a series of zigzags. If you allow zigzags, then you could carom about the country in any pattern you wished and thus make the distance effectively infinite. I wanted to know what was the furthest you could travel in a straight line without crossing salt water. Laying a ruler across the page, I discovered to my surprise that the ruler tilted away from Landâs End and John oâGroats, like a deflected compass needle. The longest straight line actually started at the top left-hand side of the map at a lonely Scottish promontory called Cape Wrath. The bottom, even more interestingly, went straight through Bognor Regis. Larry was right. It was a sign. For the briefest of periods, I considered the possibility of travelling through Britain along my newly discovered line (the Bryson Line, as I would like it now to become generally known, since I was the one who discovered it), but I could see almost at once that that wouldnât be practical or even desirable. It would mean, if I took it literally, going through peopleâs houses and gardens, tramping across trackless fields, and fording rivers, which was clearly crazy; and if I just tried to stay close to it, it would mean endlessly picking my way through suburban streets in places like Macclesfield and Wolverhampton, which didnât sound terribly rewarding either. But I could certainly use the Bryson Line as a kind of beacon, to guide my way. I determined that I would begin and end at its terminal points, and visit it from time to time en route when I conveniently could and when I remembered to do so, but I wouldnât force myself to follow it religiously. It would be, rather, my terminus ad quem, whatever exactly that means. Along the way, I would, as far as possible, avoid the places I went to on the first trip (too much danger of standing on a corner and harrumphing at how things had deteriorated since I was last there) and instead focus on places I had never been, in the hope I could see them with fresh, unbiased eyes. I particularly liked the idea of Cape Wrath. I know nothing about it â it could be a caravan park, for all I know â but it sounded rugged and wave- battered and difficult to get to, a destination for a serious traveller. When people asked me where I was bound, I could gaze towards the northern horizon with a set expression and say: âCape Wrath, God willing.â I imagined my listeners giving a low whistle of admiration and replying, âGosh, thatâs a long way.â I would nod in grim acknowledgement. âNot even sure if thereâs a tearoom,â I would add.\n\nP:19\n\nBut before that distant adventure, I had hundreds of miles of historic towns and lovely countryside to get through, and a visit to the celebrated English seaside at Bognor.\n\nP:20\n\nChapter 1 Bugger Bognor! BEFORE I WENT there for the first time, about all I knew about Bognor Regis, beyond how to spell it, was that some British monarch, at some uncertain point in the past, in a moment of deathbed acerbity, called out the words âBugger Bognorâ just before expiring, though which monarch it was and why his parting wish on earth was to see a medium-sized English coastal resort sodomized are questions I could not answer. The monarch, I have since learned, was King George V, and the story is that in 1929 he travelled to Bognor on the advice of his physician, Lord Dawson of Penn, who proposed that a spell of fresh sea air might help him recover from a serious lung complaint. That Dawson could think of no better treatment than a change of scene is perhaps a reflection of his most outstanding characteristic as a doctor: incompetence. Dawson was in fact so celebrated for medical ineptitude that a ditty was composed in his honour. It went: Lord Dawson of Penn Has killed lots of men. So thatâs why we sing God save the King. The king chose Bognor not because he held any special affection for it, but because a rich chum of his named Sir Arthur du Cros had a mansion there called Craigweil House, which he offered to the king for his private use. Craigweil was by all accounts an ugly and uncomfortable retreat, and the king liked nothing about it, but the sea air did do him good and after a few\n\nP:21\n\nmonths he was well enough to return to London. If he left with any fond memories of Bognor, he didnât relate them. Six years later, when the king relapsed and now lay dying, Dawson blandly assured him that soon he would be well enough to return to Bognor for another holiday. âBugger Bognor,â the king reportedly said and thereupon died. The story is nearly always dismissed as fiction, but one of George Vâs biographers, Kenneth Rose, maintains that it could be true and that it certainly would not have been out of character. Because of the kingâs short residency, Bognor petitioned to have the word Regis added to its title, and in 1929 this was granted, so that interestingly its supreme elevation and onset of terminal decline date from almost precisely the same moment. Like so much of coastal Britain, Bognor has seen better days. Once upon a time happy, well-dressed throngs flocked to the town for carefree weekends. Bognor had a Theatre Royal, a grand Pavilion with what was said to be the finest dance floor in the south of England, and a much esteemed if not very accurately named Kursaal, where no one was cured of anything but patrons could roller-skate to the music of a resident orchestra and afterwards dine beneath giant palms. All that is distant history now. The pier at Bognor survives, but barely. Once it was a thousand feet long, but various owners took to lopping lengths off it following fires or storm damage so that today it is just a stub three hundred feet long that doesnât quite reach the sea. For years Bognor had an annual birdman competition, in which competitors tried to get airborne from the pier end using various homemade contraptions â bicycles with rockets strapped to the sides and that sort of thing. Invariably the competitors would travel an amusingly short distance and splash into the water, to the delight of the watching crowds, but eventually the shortened pier meant that they were crash-landing on sand and shingle in a way that was more alarming than amusing. The competition was cancelled in 2014 and appears now to have moved permanently a few miles down the coast to Worthing, where the prizes are bigger and the pier actually stands over water. In an effort to reverse Bognorâs long, gentle decline, in 2005 Arun District Council formed the Bognor Regis Regeneration Task Force with the goal of bringing Â£500 million of investment to the town. As it became clear that\n\nP:22\n\nnothing on that scale would ever be forthcoming, the target was quietly reduced first to Â£100 million and then to Â£25 million. These also proved too ambitious. Eventually it was decided that a more realistic target was a sum of about zero. When it was realized that that goal had already been reached, the task force was wound up, its work completed. Now, as far as I could tell, all the authorities are doing for Bognor is just keeping it ticking over, like a patient on life support. But for all that Bognor isnât such a bad place. It has a long beach with a curving concrete promenade, and a town centre that is compact and tidy, if not thriving. Just inland from the sea is a sylvan retreat called Hotham Park, with winding paths, a small boating pond and a toy railway. But that, it must be said, is about it. If you do a web search for things to do in Bognor, Hotham Park is the first thing that comes up. The second suggested attraction is a shop selling mobility scooters. I walked down to the seafront. A good number of people were ambling along, enjoying the sunshine. We were about to have a lovely summer and even now at ten thirty in the morning you could see that this day was going to be, by English standards, a scorcher. My original plan was to stroll west along the front to Craigweil, to see where the king had stayed, but that hope was dashed when I learned that Craigweil was torn down in 1939 and that today the site is lost somewhere beneath a housing estate. So instead I walked east along the promenade towards Felpham because that was the direction that nearly all the other strollers were going in and I assumed they knew what they were doing. On one side stood the beach and a bright, glittering sea, and on the other was a line of smart modern homes, all with high walls to preserve their privacy from us on the promenade. The owners, however, had not solved the obvious problem that a wall designed to keep passers-by from peering in also keeps those on the inside from seeing out. If the occupants of these smart houses wanted to look at the sea, they had to go upstairs and sit on a balcony, but that meant exposing themselves to our gaze. We could see everything about them â whether they were tanned or pale, having a cold drink or a hot one, were tabloid readers or Telegraph readers. The people on the balconies pretended not to be bothered about this, but you could tell they were. It was a lot to ask after all. They had to pretend first of all that their balconies somehow made them invisible to us and then additionally they had to pretend\n\nP:23\n\nthat we were in any case such an incidental part of the panorama that they had never actually noticed us down there looking up at them. That was a lot of pretending to have to do. As a test, I tried to make eye contact with the people on the balconies. I smiled as if to say, âHello there, I see you!â but they always looked quickly away or affected not to see me at all, but rather were absorbed by something far off on the horizon, in the general vicinity of Dieppe or possibly Deauville. Sometimes I think it must be a little exhausting to be English. At all events, it seemed obvious to me that we on the promenade had much the better deal since we could see the sea at all times without having to go to a higher elevation and we never had to pretend that no one could see us. Best of all, at the end of the day we could get in our cars and drive home to somewhere that wasnât Bognor Regis. My plan, after Bognor, was to take a bus along the coast to Brighton, and I was quietly excited about this. I had never experienced this stretch of coastline and had great hopes for it. I had printed out a timetable and carefully selected the 12.19 as the best bus for my purposes, but as I ambled to the bus stop now, thinking I had minutes to spare, I watched in mild dismay as my bus departed just ahead of a cloud of black smoke. It took me a minute to work out that my watch was not right, that the battery was evidently dying. With a half-hour to kill till the next bus, I went into a jewellerâs shop, where a cheerless man looked at the watch and told me that a replacement battery would be Â£30. âBut I barely paid that for the watch,â I sputtered. âThat may explain why itâs not working,â he said and handed it back with a look of majestic indifference. I waited to see if he had anything more to say, if there existed within him the faintest flicker of interest in helping me to get the right time on my wrist and possibly in the process keep his business going. It appeared not. âWell, Iâll leave it for now,â I said. âI can see you are very busy.â If he had any appreciation for my instinct for mirth, he failed to show it. He gave a shrug and that was the end of our relationship. I was hungry, but now had only twenty minutes before the next bus, so I went into a McDonaldâs for the sake of haste. I should have known better. I have a little personal history with McDonaldâs, you see. Once a few years\n\nP:24\n\nago after a big family day out we stopped at a McDonaldâs in response to cries from a back-seatful of grandchildren pleading for an unhealthy meal, and I was put in charge of placing the order. I carefully interviewed everyone in the party â about ten of us, from two cars â collated the order on to the back of an old envelope and approached the counter. âOK,â I said decisively to the youthful attendant when my turn came, âI would like five Big Macs, four quarter-pound cheeseburgers, two chocolate milkshakesââ At this point someone stepped up to tell me that one of the children wanted chicken nuggets instead of a Big Mac. âSorry,â I said and then resumed. âMake that four Big Macs, four quarter- pound cheeseburgers, two chocolate milkshakesââ At this point, some small person tugging on my sleeve informed me that he wanted a strawberry milkshake, not a chocolate one. âRight,â I said, returning to the young attendant, âmake that four Big Macs, four quarter-pound cheeseburgers, one chocolate milkshake, one strawberry milkshake, three chicken nuggets â¦â And so it went on as I worked my way through and from time to time adjusted the groupâs long and complicated order. When the food came, the young man produced about eleven trays with thirty or forty bags of food on them. âWhatâs this?â I said. âYour order,â he replied and read my order back to me off the till: âThirty- four Big Macs, twenty quarter-pound cheeseburgers, twelve chocolate shakes â¦â It turned out that instead of adjusting my order each time I restarted, he had just added to it. âI didnât ask for twenty quarter-pound cheeseburgers, I asked for four quarter-pound cheeseburgers five times.â âSame thing,â he said. âItâs not the same thing at all. You canât be this stupid.â Two of the people waiting behind me in the queue sided with the young attendant. âYou did ask for all that stuff,â one of them said. The duty manager came over and looked at the till. âIt says twenty quarter- pound cheeseburgers here,â he said as if it were a gun with my fingerprints on it.\n\nP:25\n\nâI know what it says there, but that isnât what I asked for.â One of my grown children came over to find out what was going on. I explained to him what had happened and he weighed the matter judiciously and decided that, taken all in all, it was my fault. âI canât believe you are all this stupid,â I said to an audience that consisted now of about sixteen people, some of them newly arrived but already taking against me. Eventually my wife came over and led me away by the elbow, the way I used to watch her lead jabbering psychiatric patients off to a quiet room. She sorted the mess out amicably with the manager and attendant, brought two trays of food to the table in about thirty seconds, and informed me that I was never again to venture into a McDonaldâs whether alone or under supervision. And now here I was in McDonaldâs again for the first time since my earlier fracas. I vowed to behave myself, but McDonaldâs is just too much for me. I ordered a chicken sandwich and a Diet Coke. âDo you want fries with that?â the young man serving me asked. I hesitated for a moment, and in a pained but patient tone said: âNo. Thatâs why I didnât ask for fries, you see.â âWeâre just told to ask like,â he said. âWhen I want fries, generally I say something like, âI would like some fries, too, please.â Thatâs the system I use.â âWeâre just told to ask like,â he repeated. âDo you need to know the other things I donât want? It is quite a long list. In fact, it is everything you serve except for the two things I asked for.â âWeâre just told to ask like,â he repeated yet again, but in a darker voice, and deposited my two items on a tray and urged me, without the least hint of sincerity, to have a nice day. I realized that I probably wasnât quite ready for McDonaldâs yet. The bus service from Bognor Regis to Brighton via Littlehampton is advertised as the Coastliner 700, which makes it sound sleek and stylish, possibly turbo-charged. I imagined myself sitting high above the ground in air-conditioned comfort in a plush velveteen seat, enjoying views over bright sea and rolling countryside through softly tinted glass, the kind so subtly coloured that you feel like turning to the person sitting beside you and saying, âIs this glass lightly tinted or is Littlehampton ever so slightly blue?â\n\nP:26\n\nIn fact, the bus when it wheezed in had none of these features. It was a cramped and airless single-decker filled with hard metal edges and moulded plastic seats. It was the sort of vehicle you would expect to be put on if you were being transferred between prisons. But on the plus side it was cheap â Â£4.40 for the journey to Hove, which was less than I had spent on a pint of lager in London the night before. I was still cautiously excited for I was about to travel through a succession of small and, I hoped, charming resorts: Littlehampton, Goring-by-Sea, Angmering, Worthing, Shoreham. I imagined them as the sort of happy villages that you would find in a Ladybird book from the 1950s â high streets with pleasant tearooms and shops with bright striped awnings selling pinwheels and beach balls, and people walking along holding cones with globes of yellow ice cream. But for the longest time â a good hour or more â we never went near the sea or even any identifiable communities. Instead we rolled through an endless clutter of suburbia on bypasses and dual carriageways, passing nothing but superstores (and thereâs one of the least correct terms in modern British life), petrol stations, car dealerships and all the other vital ugliness of our age. An earlier passenger had discarded a pair of glossy magazines in the seat pocket beside mine and I lifted one out now in a moment of bored curiosity. It was one of those magazines with a strangely emphatic title â Hello!, OK!, Now!, What Now! Not Now! â and the cover lines all seemed to be about female celebrities who had gained a lot of weight recently, though none that I saw looked exactly sleek to begin with. I had no idea who any of them were, but their lives made fascinating reading. My favourite article â it may be my favourite thing in print ever â concerned an actress who took revenge on her feckless partner by charging a Â£7,500 vaginal makeover to him. Now that is what I call revenge. But what, pray, do you get with a vaginal makeover? Wi-fi? Sauna? Regrettably, the article failed to specify. I was hooked. I found myself absorbed in the sumptuously mismanaged lives of celebrities whose common denominators appeared to be tiny brains, giant boobs, and a knack for entering into regrettable relationships. A little further on in the same issue I found the arresting headline âDonât kill your baby for fame!â This turned out to be a piece of advice from Katie Price (a dead ringer for the late model Jordan, if you ask me) to a rising star named Josie. Ms Price is not a writer to mince words. âListen up, Josie,â she wrote,\n\nP:27\n\nâI think youâre absolutely disgusting. Having boobs and getting an abortion doesnât make you famous!â Though intellectually and emotionally I was inclined to agree with Katie on this point, it did rather seem from the article that Josie was living proof of the contrary. The photographs of Josie depicted a young woman with breasts like party balloons and lips that brought to mind those floating booms they use to contain oil slicks. According to the article, she was expecting âher third son in two monthsâ, which I think we can agree is quite a rate of reproduction even for someone from Essex. The article went on to say that Josie was so disappointed at having another boy and not the girl she had longed for that she had taken up smoking and drinking again as a signal of displeasure to her reproductive system. She was even contemplating having an abortion, which is why Ms Price had leapt so emotionally into the fray. The article noted in passing that young Josie was considering book deals from two publishers. If it turns out that my own publisher is one of them, I will personally burn down their offices. I hate to sound like an old man, but why are these people famous? What qualities do they possess that endear them to the wider world? We may at once eliminate talent, intelligence, attractiveness and charm from the equation, so what does that leave? Dainty feet? Fresh, minty breath? I am at a loss to say. Anatomically, many of them donât even seem quite human. Many have names that suggest they have reached us from a distant galaxy: Ri-Ri, Tulisa, Naya, Jai, K-Pez, Chlamydia, Toss-R, Mo-Ron. (I may be imagining some of these.) As I read the magazine, I kept hearing a voice in my head, like the voice from a 1950s B-movie trailer, saying: âThey came from Planet Imbecile!â From wherever they spring, they exist in droves now. As if to illustrate my point, just beyond Littlehampton a young man with baggy pants and an insouciant slouch boarded the bus and took a seat across from me. He was wearing a baseball cap several sizes too large for his head. Only his outsized ears kept it from falling over his eyes. The bill of the cap was steamrollered flat and still had its shiny, hologram-like price sticker attached. Across the brow in large capitals was the word âOBEYâ. Earphones were sending booming sound waves through the magnificent interstellar void of his cranium, on a journey to find the distant, arid mote that was his brain. It must have been a little like the hunt for the Higgs boson. If you took all the young\n\nP:28\n\nmen in southern England with those caps and that slouch and collected them all together in one room, you still wouldnât have enough IQ points to make a halfwit. I turned to the second magazine, Shut the Fuck Up!. In this one, I learned that Katie Price was not perhaps the paragon of wise counsel that I had to this point assumed. Here we were given a guided tour of Ms Priceâs dazzlingly commodious love life. This included three marriages, two broken engagements, several children, and seven other earnest but short-lived commitments â and this was just the most recent fragment of her busy existence. All of Ms Priceâs relationships were stupendously unsatisfactory, none more so than the latest. She had married a fellow named Kieran, whose chief talent, I believe, was an ability to make his hair stand up in interesting ways. Not long after they moved into Katieâs 1,100-room mansion, Katie discovered that Kieran had been romping with her very best (now presumably formerly very best) friend. As if this were not enough (and in Ms Priceâs world very little ever is), she discovered that another of her very best friends was also road-testing Kieran. Ms Price was understandably furious. I think we could be looking at the Buckingham Palace of vaginal makeovers here. Turning the page, I found a heartwarming profile of a couple named Sam and Joey, whose talents I was genuinely unable to identify. I would be interested to know if anyone could. Sam and Joey were evidently very successful, for they were looking for a large property in Essex â âideally a castleâ, a friend reported. It was at this point that I realized that my brain was dripping on to the pages, so I put the magazine down, and instead watched the passing suburban scene outside my window. Gradually, helplessly and with many fitful jerks of the head, I lapsed into the deepest of slumbers. I awoke with a start and found myself in some uncertain place. The bus had stopped beside a town park, large, rectangular and green, and busy with people. It was bounded on three sides by small hotels and apartment buildings, and was open to the sea on the fourth. It was very fetching. Immediately outside my window and running away from the park was a pedestrian lane that looked appealing, too. Perhaps this was Hove. I had heard that Hove was very nice. I stumbled hastily off the bus and wandered\n\nP:29\n\nabout a bit, wondering how I could find out where I was. I couldnât bring myself to approach anyone and say, âExcuse me, where am I?â so I just wandered until I came to an information board that informed me I was in Worthing. I explored the pedestrian lane, called Warwick Street, and had a cup of tea, then strolled down to the seafront, which was dominated by a sensationally ugly multi-storey car park. You do wonder what planning officials think. âHey, Iâve got an idea. Instead of having attractive hotels and apartment blocks beside the sea, letâs put up a giant windowless car park. Thatâll bring the crowds in!â I thought about walking the rest of the way to Brighton, but then I realized that what I could see in the hazy uttermost distance was Brighton itself and it was clearly a long way away â more than eight miles, according to my trusty Ordnance Survey map, and that was considerably further than I cared to go on foot just at the moment. So I got on another bus, all but identical to the first one, and resumed my journey by road. The trip began promisingly enough, but soon the coast road became a long string of scrapyards, buildersâ merchants, car repair shops, and finally a giant power station, as we made our way into Shoreham. We got caught in a long tailback because of roadworks and I fell asleep again. I awoke in Hove, exactly where I wished to be, and exited the bus with my usual stumbling haste. I had recently by chance read about George Everest, the man for whom Mount Everest was named, and learned that he was buried in St Andrewâs churchyard in Hove, and I thought I might look in on his grave. Until I read about old George, I had never paused to wonder how the mountain got its name. It turns out that it should never have been named for him. For one thing, he never saw it. Mountains, in India or elsewhere, hardly played a part in his life at all. Everest was born in 1790 in either Greenwich or Wales (depending on which sources you follow), the son of a lawyer, and educated at military schools in Marlow and Woolwich before being packed off to the Far East, where he became a surveyor. In 1817, he was sent to Hyderabad, in India, to serve as chief assistant on an enterprise known as the Great Trigonometrical Survey. The aim of the project was to survey an arc of longitude across India as a way of determining the circumference of the Earth. It was the lifeâs work of an interestingly obscure fellow named William Lambton. Nearly\n\nP:30\n\neverything about Lambton is uncertain. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography says he was born some time in the period 1753 to 1769 â an arrestingly broad range of possibility. Where he grew up is quite unknown, as are all the other details of his early life and education. All that can be said is that in 1781 he joined the army, went to Canada to survey its boundary with the new United States, and then was dispatched to India. There he got the idea of surveying his arc. He worked on it exhaustively for some twenty years before dying abruptly in northern India in 1823 â though exactly where, when and what of are not known. George Everest merely completed the project. It was important work, but it went nowhere near the Himalayas. Photos of Everest from late in life show a cheerless face almost perfectly encircled by white hair and beard. Life in India didnât much agree with him. He spent twenty years there more or less constantly unwell, suffering from typhus and chronic bouts of Yellapurum fever and diarrhoea. He spent extended periods at home on sick leave. He returned permanently to England in 1843, long before the mountain was named. It is almost the only mountain in Asia to have an English name. British cartographers were generally fairly scrupulous about preserving native designations, but Mount Everest was known locally by a range of names â Deodhunga, Devadhunga, Bairavathan, Bhairavlangur, Gnalthamthangla, Chomolungma and several more â so there wasnât one to fix on. The British most commonly called it Peak XV. No one at the time had any idea that it was the tallest mountain in the world, and therefore deserving of special attention, so when someone put Everestâs name on the map it wasnât intended as a momentous gesture. In the end the trigonometrical survey was found to be largely inaccurate anyway, so Lambton and Everest died having achieved very little. George Everest, incidentally, didnât pronounce his name Ev-er-rest, as everyone says it today, but as Eve-rest â just two syllables â so that the mountain is not only misnamed but mispronounced. Everest died aged seventy-six in Hyde Park Gardens, London, but was carted off to Hove for burial. No one knows why. He had no known connection to the town or to any part of Sussex. I was greatly taken with the idea of the most famous mountain in the world being named for a man who had no connection to it and whose name we donât even pronounce correctly. I think thatâs rather splendid. St Andrewâs is a striking church, large and grey, with a dark, square tower. By the gate stood a large sign saying The Church of St Andrew Welcomes You\n\nP:31\n\nbut the spaces for the vicarâs name, the times of services and the phone number for the churchwarden were blank. Three groups of vagrants occupied the churchyard, drinking and enjoying the sunshine. Two guys in the nearest group were arguing heatedly over something, but I couldnât tell what. I hunted around among the gravestones, but most inscriptions were weathered to the point of illegibility. Everestâs grave has been exposed to the salty air of Hove for almost 150 years, so it seemed unlikely it would survive in identifiable form. One of the two arguing fellows stood up and had a pee against the boundary wall. As he did so, he took a simultaneous interest in me, and shouted questions at me over his shoulder in a vaguely hostile manner, asking me what I was looking for. I told him I was looking for the grave of a man named George Everest. He astounded me by saying, in quite a cultivated voice, âOh, just over there,â and nodded at some gravestones a few feet from me. âThey named Mount Everest after him, but he never actually saw it, you know.â âSo Iâve read.â âStupid fucker,â he said, a touch ambiguously, and hefted his willy back into his trousers with an air of satisfaction. And so ended my first day as a tourist in Britain. I presumed that at least some of the following ones would be better.\n\nP:32\n\nChapter 2 Seven Sisters SOME WOMAN I have never met regularly sends me email alerts telling me how to recognize if I am having a stroke. âIf you feel a tingling in your fingers,â one will say, âyou could be having A STROKE. Seek medical attention AT ONCE.â (The alerts come with lots of italics and abrupt capitalizations, presumably to underline how serious a matter this is.) Another will say: âIf you sometimes canât remember where you parked your car in a multi-storey car park, you are probably HAVING A STROKE. Go to an emergency room IMMEDIATELY.â The uncanny thing about these messages is how accurately they apply to me. I have every one of the symptoms and there are hundreds of them. Every couple of days I learn of a new one. âIf you think you might be producing more ear wax than usual â¦â âIf you sometimes sneeze unexpectedly â¦â âIf you have had toast at any time in the last six months â¦â âIf you celebrate your birthday on the same date every year â¦â âIf you feel anxious about strokes after reading stroke warnings â¦â âIf you have any of these symptoms â or any other symptoms â find a doctor at once. An embolism THE SIZE OF A DUCK EGG is heading straight for your CEREBRAL CORTEX!!â Taken together, the alerts make clear that the best indicator of a stroke is whatever you were doing just before you had a stroke. Lately the warnings have been accompanied by alarming accounts of people who failed to heed\n\nP:33\n\nthe signals. âWhen Doreenâs husband Harold noticed that his ears were red after he got out of the shower,â one might begin, âthey didnât think anything of it. How they wish they had. Soon afterwards, Doreen found Harold, her husband of forty-seven years, slumped face first in a bowl of Weetabix. HE WAS HAVING A STROKE! Harold was rushed to hospital but critical minutes had been lost, and now he is a VEGETABLE who spends his afternoons watching COUNTDOWN Donât let this happen to you!!â I donât actually need memos to know that things are not going well with my body. All I have to do is stand before a mirror, tilt my head back and look up my nostrils. This isnât something I do a great deal, youâll understand, but what I used to find was two small, dark caves. Now I am confronted with a kind of private rainforest. My nostrils are packed with fibrous material â you canât even really call it hair â of the sort you would find in a thick coir doormat. Indeed if you were to carefully pick apart a coir doormat until all you had was a pile of undifferentiated fibres, and shoved 40 per cent of the pile up one nostril and 40 per cent up the other, and took the rest and put that in your ears so that a little was tumbling out of each, then you would be me. Somebody needs to explain to me why it is that the one thing your body can suddenly do well when you get old is grow hair in your nose and ears. Itâs like God is playing a terrible, cruel joke on you, as if he is saying, âWell, Bill, the bad news is that from now on you are going to be barely continent, lose your faculties one by one, and have sex about once every lunar eclipse, but the good news is that you can braid your nostrils.â The other thing you can do incredibly well when you are old is grow toenails. I have no idea why. Mine are harder than iron now. When I cut my toenails, I see sparks. I could use them as body armour if I could just get my enemies to shoot at my feet. The worst part about ageing is the realization that all your future is downhill. Bad as I am today, I am pretty much tip-top compared with what I am going to be next week or the week after. I recently realized with dismay that I am even too old now for early onset dementia. Any dementia I get will be right on time. The outlook generally is for infirmity, liver spots, baldness, senility, bladder dribble, purple blotches on the hands and head as if my wife has been beating me with a wooden spoon (always a possibility) and the conviction that no one in the world speaks loud enough. And thatâs the best-\n\nP:34\n\ncase scenario. Thatâs if everything goes absolutely swimmingly. There are other scenarios that involve catheters, beds with side railings, plastic tubing with my blood in it, care homes, being lifted on and off toilets, and having to guess what season it is outside â and those are all still near the best-case end of the spectrum. Unnerved by my dossier of stroke warnings, I did some research and it appears that there are two basic ways to avoid having a stroke. One is to die of something else first. The other is to get some exercise. I decided, in the interests of survival, to introduce a little walking into my life. And so it was, the day after my trip from Bognor to Hove, that I was to be found fifteen or so miles to the east wheezing my way up a steep hill to a breezy top called Haven Brow, the first in a series of celebrated eminences gracing the Sussex coast and known as the Seven Sisters. The Seven Sisters is one of the great walks of England. (They are the hills on the cover of this book, and are a fair size, as you can see.) From the top of Haven Brow the view is just sensational. Ahead of you stretches a hazy infinity of rolling hills, each ending at the seaward side in a sudden plunge of white chalk. On a sunny day like this one, it is a world of simple, bright elements: green land, white cliffs, deep blue sea, matching sky. Nothing â and I mean, really, absolutely nothing â is more extraordinary in Britain than the beauty of the countryside. Nowhere in the world is there a landscape that has been more intensively utilized â more mined, farmed, quarried, covered with cities and clanging factories, threaded with motorways and railway lines â and yet remains so comprehensively and reliably lovely over most of its extent. It is the happiest accident in history. In terms of natural wonders, you know, Britain is a pretty unspectacular place. It has no alpine peaks or broad rift valleys, no mighty gorges or thundering cataracts. It is built to really quite a modest scale. And yet with a few unassuming natural endowments, a great deal of time and an unfailing instinct for improvement, the makers of Britain created the most superlatively park- like landscapes, the most orderly cities, the handsomest provincial towns, the jauntiest seaside resorts, the stateliest homes, the most dreamily spired, cathedral-rich, castle-strewn, abbey-bedecked, folly-scattered, green- wooded, winding-laned, sheep-dotted, plumply hedgerowed, well-tended, sublimely decorated 50,318 square miles the world has ever known â almost\n\nP:35\n\nnone of it undertaken with aesthetics in mind, but all of it adding up to something that is, quite often, perfect. What an achievement that is. And what a joy it is to walk in it. England and Wales have 130,000 miles of public footpaths, about 2.2 miles of path for every square mile of area. People in Britain donât realize how extraordinary that is. If you told someone in the Midwest of America, where I come from, that you intended to spend the weekend walking across farmland, they would look at you as if you were out of your mind. You couldnât do it anyway. Every field you crossed would end in a barrier of barbed wire. You would find no helpful stiles, no kissing gates, no beckoning wooden footpath posts to guide you on your way. All you would get would be a farmer with a shotgun wondering what the hell you were doing blundering around in his alfalfa. So if there is one thing I enjoy and admire in Britain, it is the pleasure of being on foot and at large in the open air. I was on the South Downs Way, which runs for a hundred miles from Winchester to Eastbourne along the rolling chalk downs of the south coast. I have done most of the trail in chunks over the years, but this is my favourite stretch. To my left were bosomy hills of green and gold, to the right a spangled plane of bright blue sea. Dividing the two were cliffs of brilliant white. You can, if you dare, creep right up to the cliff edge and look over. Generally you find a straight drop down two hundred feet to a rocky beach. But almost no one ever does this. Itâs too unnerving and way too dangerous. These cliff edges are crumbly, so everyone keeps well back. Even frolicking dogs brake and retreat when they see the fall. All along this stretch of coast the path is a grassy lawn, cropped by sheep, sometimes hundreds of yards wide, so even the most absent- minded walker â the sort of person who canât be trusted around automated parking barriers, say â can amble along in a state of blissful unawareness and remain safe. The South Downs Way is not only lovely but getting better. At Birling Gap, roughly halfway between the start of the Seven Sisters and Eastbourne, there used to be a fairly horrible cafÃ©, but the National Trust has absorbed it into its tasteful care and converted it into a paradise for people who look as if they have just stepped out of a Barbour catalogue. Now there is a smart cafeteria full of scrubbed wooden tables and lovely sea views, clean restrooms, a gift shop for people who think that Â£10 is not too much to pay for six ginger biscuits so long as they come in a nice tin, and a small but\n\nP:36\n\ninteresting museum. I went to the museum first and appreciated its intelligence and thoughtfulness. It tells you a great deal about the geology of the Sussex coast, including that it is eroding by two-fifths of a metre a year on average, though Birling Gap itself is tumbling into the sea at nearly twice that rate. Across the way from the National Trust cafÃ© there used to stand an extended terrace of clifftop houses. Now just four houses remain, and house number four looked like it might soon be called Beach Cottage. I was also interested to discover that the Seven Sisters â which are, namely, Haven Brow, Short Brow, Rough Brow, Brass Point, Flat Hill, Baileyâs Hill and Went Hill â donât include Belle Tout or Beachy Head, two of the mightiest eminences of all along this stretch of coast, which meant that I was in the process of climbing nine hills, not seven. No wonder I was tired. Sobered by this thought, I fortified myself with a posh sandwich and bottle of organic soda pop at the National Trust cafÃ©, then returned to the long, lonesome trail. Not long after Birling Gap, the path arrives at a sweeping prospect across the downs that strikes nearly everyone as familiar whether they have ever walked this way or not. It is a view that was immortalized in a Second World War poster by an artist named Frank Newbould. The poster shows a shepherd guiding a flock of sheep across the downs. Below, in the middle distance, is an attractive farmhouse. At the top of a facing hill is the iconic Belle Tout lighthouse. The sea is just visible as a line across a distant valley. The caption says: âYour Britain â fight for it now.â I have always thought it interesting that of all the possible things worth dying for in 1939, it was the countryside that was selected. I wonder how many people would feel that way now. Newbould took a few small liberties in the work â he improved the shape of the hills, tidied up the farmstead, altered the course of the path slightly â but not so much as to render the view fictitious. It is a testament to the British nation that more than seventy years after Newbould painted this expansive prospect, it is as fine now as it was then. Taking the English countryside for granted, assuming that it will always be like this, is almost certainly its greatest threat. The sad irony is that the things that make the landscape of Britain comely and distinctive are almost entirely no longer needed. Hedgerows, country churches, stone barns, verges full of nodding wildflowers and birdsong, sheep roaming over windswept fells, village shops and post offices and much more can only rarely now be\n\nP:37\n\njustified on economic grounds, and for most people in power those are the only grounds that matter. Looked at economically, we donât even need farmers. Farming accounts for just 0.7 per cent of GDP, so if all farming in Britain ceased tomorrow the economy would barely notice. Successive governments have done almost nothing to preserve most of these things. There is a strange, blind, foolish inclination to suppose that the features that make the British countryside are somehow infinitely self-sustaining, that they will always be there, adding grace and beauty. Donât count on it. Belle Tout lighthouse itself nearly didnât survive. It was decommissioned in the early 1900s and became derelict. Canadian soldiers used it for target practice during the Second World War, but mercifully failed to destroy it. After the war it was restored, but by the late twentieth century it was in danger of falling into the sea, so some good soul paid a fortune to have it mounted on rails and moved a safe distance back from the cliff edge. So now it is safe for another few decades until the crumbling cliffs sneak up on it again. After Belle Tout comes a long descent almost to sea level, then a steady climb towards the summit of Beachy Head. Itâs a long haul up a broad grassy strip, rather like walking on a golf fairway, but worth it for the payoff at the top where you get the most sensational views of the famous Beachy Head lighthouse with its jaunty red and white stripes, standing in the sea at the base of the cliffs. At the top of the hill, where it flattens out, is a big layby where coach parties of schoolchildren can get off and scatter a little litter around â itâs a kind of tradition, I guess; school groups come from all over to put their crisp packets and chocolate bar wrappers in the gorse and bracken, bless their sweet, undersupervised little hearts â but I am pleased to say that this was the only place along the entire walk that I encountered litter. After the summit at Beachy Head, there comes a broad, park-like expanse of land with a selection of paths plunging downhill to the old resort town of Eastbourne. The views over the townâs sweeping seafront with its golden beach and scallops of advancing waves are very fine, too, though marred by a single high-rise apartment house called South Cliff Tower, which stands distractingly in the foreground. Itâs a charmless building that should never have been allowed, but there you are. The world is full of shitty things that should never have happened. Look at Eric Pickles.\n\nP:38\n\nIn nearly all other respects, however, Eastbourne is a good place. The promenade is well kept, with big houses and smart hotels on one side and broad beaches on the other â all leading to a good old-fashioned pier, one of the few truly classic piers still standing. Just after my visit, the pier was badly damaged in a fire â seaside piers in England seem to be amazingly combustible; I donât know why â but according to press reports it will be lovingly restored. I most emphatically hope so. It would be a tragedy to see it go. The charm of Eastbourne is that it is so comfortably old-fashioned, and nowhere is that better encapsulated than in a cafÃ© where I always stop called Favoâloso. It is the most wonderful establishment. Inside, it is forever 1957. It is like stepping into a Cliff Richard movie called âSummer Milkshakeâ or âIce Cream Holidayâ or something. Favoâloso is spotless and polished and shiny; it basks in a retro gleam. The food is decent, the servers efficient and friendly, the prices reasonable. What more could you ask? It is my favourite place in East Sussex, if not on the entire south coast. Two days before I left on this trip, I Googled âFavoâloso Cafeâ to check the address and was led, all but inevitably, to TripAdvisor, where I was appalled to discover that most people didnât view it very favourably at all. One recent visitor pronounced himself âDissapointtedâ with the experience. Well, here is a new rule: if you are too stupid to spell âdisappointedâ even approximately correctly, you are not allowed to take part in public discourse at any level. Trawling through the reviews, I found that hardly anybody spoke warmly of Favoâlosoâs carefully preserved atmosphere. In fact, most were critical of the decor, calling it old-fashioned and in need of an update. I do despair. We live in a world that has practically no appreciation for quality, tradition or classiness, and in which people who canât spell even common words get to decide what survives. That canât be right, surely. I was, as a TripAdvisor correspondent might put it, deply trubbled.\n\nP:39\n\nChapter 3 Dover NOW HERE IS a question that is harder to answer than you might think: Is Britain a big country or a little one? Looked at one way, it is self-evidently small, a modest chunk of land floating in chilly waters off the northwestern edge of Europe. Of the total surface area of Earth, Britain occupies just 0.0174069 per cent. (I should note that I canât absolutely vouch for that number. It was calculated for me by my son some years ago for a newspaper article I was writing. He was only about thirteen years old at the time, but he had a calculator with over 200 buttons on it and he seemed to know what he was doing.) By other measures, however, Britain is incontestably substantial. Amazingly, it is the thirteenth largest land mass on the planet and that includes four continents â Australia, Antarctica, America and Eurasia-Africa (which geographers, being anally retentive and unimaginative, classify as a single mass). Only eight islands on Earth are bigger: Greenland, New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar, Baffin, Sumatra, Honshu and Vancouver. By population, Britain is the fourth largest island state, behind only Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines. By wealth, it is second. Measured by decent music, old stony buildings, variety of boiled sweets and reasons for not going to work because of the weather, it is number one by a very large margin. Yet it is only seven hundred miles from top to bottom and so slender in profile that no one in the country is ever more than seventy miles from one of its edges.\n\nP:40\n\nTaken all in all, it has long seemed to me that Britain is just about the perfect size for a country â small enough to be cosy and embraceable, but large enough to maintain a lively and independent culture. If the rest of the world vanished tomorrow and all that was left was Britain, there would still be good books and theatre and stand-up comedy and universities and competent surgeons and so on. (Plus England would get to win the World Cup every time and Scotland would always qualify.) This cannot be said of many other nations. If Canada were the only country to survive, the world would be a nicer, politer place, but there would be way too much ice hockey. If it were Australia, youâd have terrific barbecues and surfing but a greater dependence on Kylie Minogue for musical entertainment than is, with respect, ideal. Interestingly, the thing that made me realize that Britain is an optimal size was the rarely discussed subject of cow attacks. This is a topic that we donât pay as much attention to as perhaps we ought. I first heard about cow attacks some years ago while walking on the South Downs Way with a journalist from a walking magazine. I had just become president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England and he was interviewing me about the countryside. At some point â we were crossing a field in the vicinity of the Devilâs Dyke, near Brighton, if I recall correctly â he mentioned that we should proceed cautiously because there was a bull in our field. âYouâre kidding,â I squeaked, but sure enough, watching us lugubriously from about fifty feet away, was a great rectangular block of beef. âJust walk normally,â my companion instructed in a taut whisper, âor youâll attract his attention.â âBut weâre on a national footpath,â I protested, my sense of unfairness momentarily outweighing my instinct to exit sharply. âSurely a farmer canât put a bull in a field with a footpath through it,â I added. I turned to see what my companion had to say about this and discovered that he was about seventy yards further on and running like hell. I waddled briskly behind him, casting glances over my shoulder, but the bull stayed rooted to his spot. When we were both safely on the other side of the field wall, I repeated my complaint that surely it was not legal to put bulls in fields with footpaths. âActually it is,â my companion told me. âThe rule is that bulls can be placed in fields with public rights of way as long as they are kept with beef cows and not dairy cows.â\n\nP:41\n\nI was of course bewildered by this. âWhy one and not the other?â I asked. âNo idea. But the real danger,â he went on, âis cows. Cows kill a lot more people than bulls.â Whatever is the next level beyond pained incredulity is the level I reached now. For years I had been striding boldly through herds of cows in the belief that they were the one group of animals larger than a chicken that I could intimidate with the shake of a stick, and now this was being taken away from me. âYouâre kidding,â I said again. âAfraid not,â he responded in the solemn tone of someone with experience in the matter. âCows attack a lot.â The next day I did the one thing you should obviously never do. I looked for more information on the internet. My informant was right. Walkers in Britain, it seems, are killed by cows all the time. Four people were fatally trampled in one eight-week period in 2009 alone. One of these unfortunates was a veterinarian out walking her dogs on the Pennine Way in Yorkshire. This was a woman who understood animals and liked them, probably had treats for cows in her pocket â and they still trampled her. More recently, a retired university lecturer named Mike Porter was trampled to death by an angry herd â yes, angry â in a field near the Kennet and Avon Canal in Wiltshire, a place where I had been walking only the year before. âIt looked like they wanted to kill him,â one eyewitness breathlessly told the Daily Telegraph. It was the fourth serious attack on walkers in five years just by this one herd. Now what, you may reasonably wonder, does this have to do with Britain being the right size for a country? Well, stick with me, please. A couple of weeks later I was in Colorado, visiting my son Sam who works in Vail, when I happened to read an article in the Denver Post about a man named Dexter Lewis who had been convicted of going into a bar called Feroâs just before closing time, ordering the bartender and four remaining customers to lie down and then killing them in cold blood as part of a robbery. Now if anyone did anything on that scale in England, it would be front page news across the nation the next morning. But in America a gruesome murder in Denver is unlikely to be news in Memphis or Detroit or anywhere outside Colorado. Those places have murders of their own to be preoccupied with. It wasnât a particularly big article even in the Denver Post.\n\nP:42\n\nThis is when it occurred to me that the issue here is not how often bad things happen, but how often they are reported, which is quite a different matter, of course. In America, a cow trampling would never make the national news other than in highly exceptional circumstances. If, letâs say, Dick Cheney was trampled to death by cows (and we can always dream), that would be national news. But if it was just some guy walking his dog in Sodom, Indiana, no one outside Indiana â probably no one outside Sodom County â would hear about it. There could be a national epidemic of cow tramplings and no one would know it because the news wouldnât travel far enough for trends to become apparent. But in Britain if a single cow tramples a walker anywhere in the country, it will almost certainly make headlines. The story of the veterinarian killed in Yorkshire was reported in all the national newspapers except the Daily Star, and I am guessing that that was only because the people at the Star couldnât spell veterinarian. I like being in a country where when cows attack word of it gets around. Thatâs what I mean when I say Britain is cosy. It is a nice quality for a country to have. The only downside to this is that it means Britons are frightened of things that are never going to happen to them. Cow attacks are actually quite rare. Thatâs what makes them news when they happen. But because people read about cow attacks at regular intervals, they perceive them as being common. As an experiment, I asked several British friends this question: âWhat are the chances if you are walking in a field with cows that the cows will attack you?â Every one of them grew instantly animated, and said something along the lines of âActually, surprisingly good. I read about it in the papers. It happens far more often than youâd expect.â Ask the same question of an American and he would say: âWhy would I be in a field with cows?â Weâll return to this issue in due course, but first letâs pay a visit to Dover. I know I said at the outset that I was going to avoid the places I went to in Notes from a Small Island, but I felt I just had to look in on Dover when I was so close by. I have a peculiar fondness for the place â or if not fondness exactly, a kind of abiding concern â that I canât entirely explain. Partly, I suppose, it is because Dover was where I first set foot on English soil, so in a very literal sense it is the place I have known the longest. I spent my first\n\nP:43\n\nforty-eight hours in Britain there and I quite liked Dover. Of course, I knew nothing else of Britain at that point, but in those days Dover wasnât at all a bad place. It had cinemas and pubs and restaurants and a busy high street. The endless bustle of the ferry port clearly brought people and commerce to the town. But on every subsequent visit I have made to Dover it has visibly deteriorated. I keep hoping to find the buzzing, prosperous little place I first saw, and instead I am greeted by a sad air of ghostliness and decline. In Notes from a Small Island, I wrote about arriving late and looking longingly into the windows of a posh hotel on the front, where people were dining in an atmosphere of elegance far beyond anything I could afford. That hotel was the Churchill. About seven or eight years ago, arriving in Dover on the car ferry from Calais, on an impulse I decided to stop at the Churchill for lunch â to treat myself to a little of the high life that I couldnât afford all those years ago. Well, it was a strange experience. The hotel still strived for an air of poshness, but it was based more on hope than merit. I had the dining room more or less to myself. The menu, instead of being a hefty leatherette book, was just a laminated sheet of the kind you might find in a Little Chef, and it was full of misspellings. I ordered a Caesar salad. When it arrived there was nothing to eat it with. The waitress saw my look of puzzlement. âDo you want some cutlery with that?â she said. âWell, yes,â I answered. âItâs a salad.â âI didnât know if you had your own,â she said grumpily, as if this were mostly my fault, and flumped off to get some. The salad was a kind of lettuce soup with some shredded chicken afloat on it. It was a small consolation to know that however long I live and however many other disappointing salads are placed before me, I would never receive a worse one than this. With respect to Caesar salads, life could only get better. I assumed from this experience that I would not venture into the Churchill again, but now I found myself approaching it once more, as if drawn by some masochistic magnetism, hoping against hope that I would find it improved since my last visit. Alas, the Churchill was closed and out of business. Doverâs last touch of elegance is gone. A man walking past with a little dog told me that the Churchill had closed about five years earlier, though another hotel now occupied part of the old premises. I looked around the corner and he was right, of course. The central part of the old hotel was\n\nP:44\n\nnow called the Dover Marina Hotel. It looked awfully quiet. Most things in Dover look quiet these days. Time appears to be leaving Dover behind. Cheap flights to Europe and the Channel Tunnel are between them slowly killing the ferry business. Hovercraft services to the continent ceased in 2000, and the number of passengers on conventional ferries fell by a third in the following decade, though they seem to have recovered very slightly since then. The loss of business has clearly been a blow to the town, but Dover seems to be doing a pretty good job of its own of running itself down. Not long before my visit, the council installed new benches on the seafront that were designed not to be too comfortable. When asked by the local paper why they had chosen uncomfortable benches, a councillor replied somewhat bewilderingly: âIf they were too comfortable, we would have the gentlemen and ladies of the day lounging on them.â And that is perhaps all you need to know to understand why Dover is dying. I walked to the old South Foreland lighthouse, which was decommissioned some years ago and is now in the care of the National Trust. For a long time this was the highest light in England, though it was the lofty cliff rather than the building itself that made it so. As lighthouses go, this one is pretty squat. South Foreland was the site of an important but forgotten piece of history. It was there that the first electric light in the world was put to use, way back in 1858, long before Thomas Edison brought us the modern lightbulb. The light at South Foreland was an arc lamp, invented by yet another man about whom almost nothing is known, Frederick Hale Holmes. Holmesâs light was too bright for domestic use but perfect for a lighthouse. The equipment was temperamental and expensive, however, and eventually it was given up as too much bother, but for a decade or so this was the one place in the world where you could see an electric light in operation. About a quarter of a century later, South Foreland made history again when Guglielmo Marconi transmitted the first international radio signal from there to a receiver at Wimereux, near Boulogne, in France. I first heard of Frederick Holmes and South Foreland when I was researching another book about five years ago, and visited it then. On that occasion, I was one of a party of three or four people who were shown around by a keen Trust volunteer. The volunteer didnât know much about\n\nP:45\n\nHolmes or Marconi, but he was a fount of knowledge with respect to the mechanical operation of the light. It took one hundred and ten turns of a crank to give two and a half hours of rotation to the light, he told us, and it took forty seconds for the light to make one complete rotation. We also learned that no two lighthouses within a hundred miles of each other had the same light sequences. âGoodness,â we said appreciatively. The man showed us banks of batteries and cogs and things like that. The illumination from the lighthouse was one million candlepower, he said. I was so impressed with the equipment that I took a photograph. He held up a hand like a bodyguard dealing with paparazzi. âPhotography is not permitted,â he said. âWhy not?â I asked, bewildered. âNational Trust policy,â he said. âBut itâs a lighthouse,â I pointed out. âItâs not the Bayeux Tapestry.â âTrust policy,â he said again, more crisply this time, in the tone of a man who would stab his wife in the eye with an ice pick if head office told him it was policy. I was about to explain to him that this is why I get so frustrated with the National Trust, because of its irksome sense of its own perfection, but I imagined my wife pinching me by the elbow and leading me towards fresh air and the distraction of a sea view, so I said nothing more. My wife has spent so many years pinching my elbow and leading me away from officious idiots â many of them in the employ of the National Trust, it must be said â that I no longer need her there. Itâs become a kind of Pavlovian response. So I stepped outside, back into a beautiful clear day, and instantly felt much better. France, 20.6 miles off, was clearly â startlingly â visible. You could practically wave to people in Calais. Many of the older English visitors around me eyed the French coast grimly, not at all pleased to realize it was that close. Most watched it warily, as if they thought it might be secretly inching closer, stealing English water. On this latest visit, however, I arrived to find that the lighthouse was closed, which was probably just as well, all things considered. So I just stood and enjoyed the views. France, I was pleased to note, still seemed to be exactly where I had last left it.\n\nP:46\n\nFrom up here, I could see the shallow smudge of brown that marked the treacherous Goodwin Sands. You wouldnât think it on such a tranquil day, but this is one of the most historically lethal places on the planet, the site of the greatest concentration of shipwrecks anywhere. More than a thousand wrecks are recorded there. The worst incident was on 27 November 1703 when the biggest storm anyone had ever seen drove fifty ships on to the sandbanks, where they were tipped on their sides and smashed to pieces. More than two thousand men died. The Royal Navy lost 20 per cent of its men that night. In Devon, Henry Winstanley, designer and builder of the celebrated Eddystone Lighthouse, was by chance on that lonely rock when the storm broke. He had long expressed a desire to be there during a really big storm. He certainly got his wish, but his belief in the buildingâs impregnability proved to be misplaced. The lighthouse was swept away by winds and waves, killing Winstanley and five others who were there with him. And on that sobering note, letâs move on to London.\n\nP:47\n\nChapter 4 London ONE OF THE mysteries of the London Underground these days is whatever became of the trains on the Circle Line. They used to come along every few minutes, but now generally you wait ages. On this particular morning, when our story resumes, a great many of us had been standing on a platform at Gloucester Road station for about twenty-five minutes without any sign of action on the line at all. âI remember when trains used to go by here,â I said brightly to a man standing beside me. âDonât the trains go by here?â he asked in sudden alarm. He was an American and was evidently new to London and possibly to humour. âI was just joking,â I said gently and indicated the many people standing on the platform with us. âWe wouldnât all be standing here if there werenât really any trains.â âBut we are all standing here and there arenât any trains.â I couldnât think of an answer to this, so I didnât say anything, but instead stared vacantly into space. I used to read the Metro when travelling underground until I realized that staring into space provided about the same level of reward without making my fingers inky. My new American friend was studying a fully unfolded Underground map. He seemed to be giving up on the Circle Line. âWhere do I go to get the Piccadilly Line?â he asked at length.\n\nP:48\n\nâOh, Piccadilly Line trains arenât stopping here just now.â He looked at me narrowly, wondering if this was another of my quips. âTheyâre replacing the elevators, so Piccadilly Line trains arenât stopping at this station for the next six months.â âItâs taking them six months to replace the elevators?â he said in undisguised wonder. âWell, there are two of them,â I answered in a spirit of fairness. I watched him studying his map. âYou may also want to know that the Circle Line doesnât go in a circle,â I added helpfully. He looked up with real interest. âThe trains used to go around in endless circles, but now they all stop at Edgware Road and everybody has to get off one train and get on another.â âWhy?â he asked. âNo one knows,â I answered. âThis sure is a screwy country,â he said. âYes, it is,â I agreed happily. Just then a train pulled in and everyone moved forward to board. âWell, I hope you have a good trip,â I said to my new friend. He got on, but didnât say thanks or goodbye or anything. I kind of hope he got lost, actually. I do like the London Underground. Putting the Circle Line trains to one side (which is evidently what London Underground does with them these days), nearly everything else about it is splendid. People forget how bad the Underground was once upon a time. When I first came to Britain, it was dirty, poorly managed and often unsafe. Several stations â Camden Town, Stockwell and Tooting Bec to name but three â were positively dangerous at night. By 1982, fewer than 500 million people a year, a decline of 50 per cent from the early 1950s, ventured into the Underground. The Kingâs Cross fire in 1987, when thirty-one people died after a discarded cigarette started a blaze in uncleared rubbish beneath a wooden escalator, showed how lamentably undermanaged the Underground had become. Well, look at it now. The platforms are the cleanest places in London. The service is smooth and reliable. The staff, as far as I can tell, are unfailingly helpful and courteous. Passenger numbers have risen to an astounding 1.2 billion a year, which is more than all the aboveground rail journeys in the\n\nP:49\n\ncountry combined. According to Time Out magazine, at any given moment there are 600,000 people on the Underground, making it both a larger and more interesting place than Oslo. I read in the Evening Standard that the average speed of Underground trains is just 21 miles an hour, which doesnât seem very much (unless you travel regularly by train between Liss and Waterloo, in which case itâs like being on a rocket ship), but it all feels pretty brisk, and to convey such a massive number of people over such an enormous and aged system with rarely a hitch is an extraordinary achievement. But then thatâs the thing about London. It does a lot of things supremely well and gets hardly any credit for it. So let me say right here, I think London is the best city in the whole world. I know it doesnât have New Yorkâs electricity and edgy dynamism or Sydneyâs harbour and sandy beaches or Parisâs boulevards, but it has more of almost everything else that makes a city great â greenery, for one thing. Nobody realizes it, but London is one of the least crowded cities on earth. New York has 93 people per hectare, Paris 83, but London just 43. If London were as densely populated as Paris, it would have a population of 35 million. Instead what it has is parks â 142 of them â and more than six hundred squares. Almost 40 per cent of London is green space. You can have all the noise and bustle of a metropolis, then turn a corner and hear birdsong. Perfect. London is arguably the biggest city in the world. Not in terms of sprawl â though goodness knows there is plenty enough of that â or number of inhabitants, but in terms of density and complexity and depth of history. London is not just vast horizontally but vast across time. History has left it sumptuously jumbled. Itâs not even one city but two â Westminster and the City of London â plus a more or less infinite number of subsumed villages, boroughs, districts, wards, parishes and geographical landmarks that cover the map with quaint and appealing names: Parsons Green, Seven Dials, Swiss Cottage, Barking, Tooting Bec, Chalk Farm, the mysteriously Gallic Theydon Bois. Most of its best-known districts â the West End, Bloomsbury, Whitechapel, Mayfair â have no official existence or formal boundaries. They just are. Politically, London is a loose affiliation of thirty-two borough councils and the Corporation of the City of London, its responsibilities divided among a Greater London Authority, a London Assembly, seventy- three parliamentary constituencies and 624 political wards. It is, in short, a great mess. At the head of it all is Boris Johnson, a man whose bumbling\n\nP:50\n\nmanner, whose very hair, is a monument to disorder. And yet somehow it works. It is a truly great city. I had two weeks at my disposal, at least notionally. Both of my daughters had contrived to get pregnant simultaneously (though in separate buildings) and were scheduled to give birth at roughly the same time in different London hospitals, and I was under strict instructions to be nearby in order to â well, I donât know what. Boil water perhaps. Stand around in a willing but useless manner. Who knows? But in the meantime I had two weeks that I could fill in any way I wished so long as I stayed sober enough to drive and didnât stray too far. I decided, impulsively, to start with a trip to Leighton House, home of the Victorian artist Frederic Leighton, on Holland Park Road in west Kensington. I didnât know a thing about Leighton, and I wasnât at all sure if that was my fault or his. It turns out he was the most famous artist of his age. Whoâd have thought? I had walked past the house several times and always thought it looked intriguing â itâs big and has an air of solemn importance, as if this is a house and a person you really ought to know about â so I had put it on my Things to Get Around to Eventually (But Probably Wonât) list. It isnât often I knock something off this list, so I was rather pleased with myself just for thinking to go there. Besides, it was a rainy day: a good day for a museum. I liked Leighton House immediately, not least because my ticket price was reduced from Â£10 to Â£6 on account of my great age. The house is gloomy and grand, but interestingly eccentric; it has, for instance, just one bedroom. In terms of decor it feels a little like a cross between a pashaâs den and a New Orleans bordello. It is full of Arabic tiles, silk wallpapers, colourful ceramics and lots of art, much of it involving bare-breasted young women, which I am always up for. Leighton isnât terribly well remembered now, in part because many of his pictures ended up in odd places like the Baroda Museum in Gujarat, India, and Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, where not many of us go to look at pictures, and in part because his paintings are in any case a little overwrought for modern tastes. Most involve a lot of upstretched arms and pleading faces, and have titles like âAnd the Sea Gave Up the Dead Which Were in Itâ and âPerseus, on Pegasus, Hastening to the Rescue of Andromedaâ.\n\nP:51\n\nBut Leighton was hugely esteemed in his own lifetime. He was elected President of the Royal Academy in 1878, and in the New Yearâs honours list of 1896 he became the first â and so far still only â artist to be ennobled. He didnât get to enjoy the privilege long. He died less than a month later, and was interred in St Paulâs Cathedral as a national treasure, with great pomp. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, always eager to be at least fifty years out of touch, gives him 8,200 words, a thousand more than it gives almost any of his contemporaries. Leighton lived alone in Leighton House for thirty years. His sexuality was always something of a mystery to those who were interested enough to think about it. After decades of apparent celibacy, he seems to have stirred to frisky life after he discovered a young beauty from the East End named Ada Pullen (who subsequently, for reasons unknown to me, changed her name to Dorothy Dene). Leighton scrubbed her up, bought her a fine wardrobe, schooled her in elocution and other cultural refinements, and introduced her into high society. If all that brings to mind Prof Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, it is no accident. George Bernard Shaw is said to have modelled Pygmalion on their relationship. Whether Leighton knew Ms Dene in the full, biblical sense isnât known, but he certainly enjoyed painting her without clothes on, as the Leighton House collection enthusiastically attests. Leightonâs possessions were auctioned off straight after his death and the house itself was knocked about by subsequent owners and then wrecked by a German bomb during the war, so that almost nothing worth seeing was left by the early post-war years, but little by little over a period of decades the house has been put back together so that it is now much as it was in Leightonâs day, and it is quite splendid. I canât say that a great deal of the artwork was entirely to my taste, but I did enjoy the experience very much and when I stepped outside the rain had stopped, the sun was shining and London looked awfully fine, its streets glistening and cleansed (sort of). So each day, without a great deal of thought beforehand, I did things that I had never done at all or hadnât done in years. I strolled through Battersea Park and then along the river to the Tate Modern. I went to the top of Primrose Hill to take in the view. I explored Pimlico and the lost world of Westminster around Vincent Square. I went to the National Portrait Gallery and had tea in the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square. I walked through all\n\nP:52\n\nthe Inns of Court and visited the museum of the Royal College of Su"
