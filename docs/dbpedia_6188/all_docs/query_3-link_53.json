        "text": "Bognor Regis is widely known to be, let’s say, more Bognor than Regis, so let’s not dwell too long on the kind of post-heyday tackiness and deprivation that you can see in umpteen other places on the British coast.\n\nInstead, let’s lie back on the shingle and enjoy the sun, of which there is a lot here, this being Britain’s sunniest town. It’s the kind of bright, golden glow that could make even a literal dump look nice, let alone a figurative one. The hotels look like decommissioned asylums, the Royal family is long gone, and the closest Michelin star is about as far from here as Alpha Centauri – but the sea is sparkling, the air is fresh and the beach goes on for miles.\n\nThese are the attributes that led Richard Hotham, an 18th-century hatter who rose to the House of Commons, to try turning pre-“Regis” Bognor, then a village of fisherfolk and smugglers, into a rival to Brighton. He was relatively successful in that respect, but unsuccessful in his attempt to rename the town “Hothampton” – so his contribution to the annals of the town was, on balance, positive.\n\nAs modern-day visitors learn from a big sign overlooking the station foyer, Bognor acquired its “royal suffix” in 1929. George V, whose then-three-year-old granddaughter is now the Queen, suffered from lung problems and septicaemia and had spent 13 weeks in Bognor while recuperating from an operation. The sea air was credited with his recovery, and the king was presented with a petition to add “Regis” to Bognor’s name.\n\nSome uncertainty enters the story at this stage. He might have said it while reluctantly signing the petition; he might have said it when entreated on his deathbed to return. What’s incontestable (maybe) is that George V, at some point or other, uttered the words “Bugger Bognor!”\n\nNo such thing happened for decades. Indeed, several locals were pleased to see the back of Queen Mary. Protocol dictated that when a member of the Royal family handled goods in a shop, they were offered it as a gift, which meant that, with a lot of time on her hands and not many shops to visit, Mary was inadvertently costing the shopkeepers vast amounts of stock. Rescued from its right royal fleecing, the local retail sector was further boosted by the arrival of Billy Butlin. In the early Thirties, he opened the amusement park that eventually morphed into the mass tourism behemoth that still bears his name.\n\nButlins is much changed from that time, and no longer reels in 6,000 new guests a week. It’s still one of the few extant relics of Bognor’s happier times, though: even the house George V stayed in has been demolished.\n\nThe resort is colourful and self-contained, and lies at the east end of the esplanade. The rest of it seems under-commercialised, compared with other seaside towns: you can get your hot dogs and your Mr Whippy, sure, you can play some mini-golf, but the fairground offering is paltry.\n\nThe effect, though, is that you can go for an unexpectedly tranquil walk here, enjoying the same things that attracted Hotham and George V all those years ago. It’s not so bad here. Bugger “Bugger Bognor.”\n\nSix good reasons to dash to Bognor\n\nThe show\n\nBognor will soon be the scene of a promising-sounding BBC sitcom in which Toby Jones will play a coach driver. Don’t Forget the Driver will be about life in small-town Britain – and death, because a body will be found on Bognor beach – and the joys (and otherwise) of coach travel.\n\nThe museum\n\nThe eccentric Bognor Regis Museum has local history, rocks and fossils, and some kookier exhibitions of old wirelesses and Noddy toys.\n\nThe pier\n\nIt’s been severely truncated over the years by storms and disrepair, but the remains of Bognor Regis Pier feature an arcade and a nightclub.\n\nThe park\n\nHotham’s eponymy isn’t visible in the name of Bognor Regis, but at least he has a park named after him. The boating lake is piddly but the miniature railway is fun.\n\nThe coffee shop\n\nThe esplanade’s Coffee and Bagel Company opened last year and is popular with good reason. Bagels, it turns out, are good, self-contained beach food, and they do a special one for dogs, too.\n\nThe resort"
