I sought 'estimates' in key areas realising the possible problems of\n\nexact answers or sums. In both the application stages and the appeal,\n\nofficers would have spent time and a reasonable estimate of hours\n\nspent could be attempted - the Officers involved will hold such\n\ninformation and can be requested to make an estimate based on\n\nreasonable assumptions, this must apply especially to the Case Officer\n\nfor whom I gather this was an early task in her employment in her\n\nposition.\n\n2. I note there is no mention of the fee(s) paid to Design: South East,\n\nplease rectify the omission.\n\n3. Can you also, as a supplementary, tell me whether the Council\n\nconsidered its legal position and appeal prospects on the basis of\n\nlegal advice as to percentage estimate of appeal success, if not, why\n\nnot and if so, what was such advice?\n\n4. Also, were any other fees expended by the Council to outside persons\n\netc with regard to this application? If so, to whom and what sums?\n\nFollowing this request, I have considered the information supplied\n\ninitially and can provide the following additional\n\nclarification/information and apologise for the delay:-\n\n1. The first application for the Sir Richard Hotham Project was dealt\n\nwith in-house by a Case Officer called D. McEwan; the second\n\napplication for the Sir Richard Hotham Project was dealt with by\n\nClaire Potts. Michael Eastham prepared and submitted evidence for the\n\nHearing and attended the Hearing for the second refused application.\n\nAs previously advised, in terms of case officer time, ADC does not\n\nrecord time spent on individual applications and so it would not be\n\npossible to provide an estimate of staff costs.\n\n2. The Council did refer the second application to Design South East and\n\nADC were invoiced for £1,322 by Design South East. There was also an\n\ninvoice of £1,000 from the Theatres Trust in respect of Advisory\n\nReview for the new theatre.\n\nIt should be noted that a request made under either the Freedom of\n\nInformation Act 2000 or the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 is\n\nfor recorded information held by the Council. There is no requirement for\n\nthe Council to produce information to specifically answer an information\n\nrequest. The Council has stated that it does not record officer time on\n\nspecific planning applications and therefore the Council is unable to\n\nprovide such information.\n\nWith regard to questions 3 and 4 of your request for an internal review,\n\nthese are considered to be new questions and are being dealt with\n\naccordingly. You will receive a response to these items at the earliest\n\nopportunity.\n\nAs I have concluded the internal review of your information request you\n\nnow have the right to appeal to the Information Commissioner if you remain\n\ndissatisfied with the way in which the Council has handled your request.\n\nAppeals should be directed to the Information Commissioner’s Office,\n\nWycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF (telephone: 0303\n\n123 1113).

Also, were any other fees expended by the Council to outside persons\n\netc with regard to this application? If so, to whom and what sums?\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n1. Arun District Council did not consider its legal position and\n\nappeal prospects on the basis of any legal advice as to a percentage\n\nestimate of appeal success.\n\nOfficers recommended that planning permission be granted and there would\n\nhave been no reason to obtain legal advice at that time on the ‘appeal\n\nprospects’.\n\nIt would be a massive resource to seek a legal view of every decision that\n\nis to be taken prior to a potential appeal.\n\nIt was the decision of the Development Control Committee\n\nto refuse the application and all relevant information was presented for\n\nconsideration at the time of determination. Officers subsequently sought\n\nto defend the decision of the Council at the subsequent appeal.\n\n2. No other fees were expended by the Council to outside persons\n\nwith regard to this application.\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the way your request for information has been\n\nhandled, you can write asking for a review of the Council’s response,\n\nwithin the next two months, to the Information Management Team at: Arun\n\nDistrict Council, Arun Civic Centre, Maltravers Road, Littlehampton, West\n\nSussex, BN17 5LF (email [1][Arun District Council request email]).\n\nIf, having exhausted our review procedure, you remain dissatisfied with\n\nthe handling of your request or complaint, you will have a right to appeal\n\nto the Information Commissioner at: The Information Commissioner's Office,\n\nWycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF (telephone: 0303\n\n123 1113; website [2]www.ico.org.uk).
