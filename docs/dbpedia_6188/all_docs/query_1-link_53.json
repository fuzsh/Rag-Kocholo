        "text": "The Waterways & Railways of the East Midlands (September 3rd-7th 2018) tour will visit the Hollingwood Hub centre to hear about the forty-year restoration programme that has returned all but nine miles of the Chesterfield Canal to navigation.\n\nI remember the wrecked state of this canal in the 1970s, and I’ve marvelled at the inspiring work of the Chesterfield Canal Trust in bringing water and boats back to long-abandoned stretches of waterway.\n\nThe first practical preservation project was the restoration of Tapton Lock on the outskirts of Chesterfield, completed by the Chesterfield Canal Society in 1990. This led to the restoration of Hollingwood Lock, near Staveley, in 1993. By 1997, when the Society became the Chesterfield Canal Trust, further locks had been restored, and the visitor centre at Tapton Lock opened.\n\nThe section between Worksop and Shireoaks reopened in 1998, and the entire length from Worksop to the east portal of Norwood Tunnel, including twenty-two listed but dismantled locks, was restored to navigation by 2003.\n\nMajor landmarks in the restoration campaign were celebrated – the opening of the Shireoaks Marina by HRH the Duke of Gloucester in 2000, the completion of navigation between Chesterfield and Staveley in 2002, the opening of the Hollingwood Hub centre in 2011 and the opening of Staveley Town Basin the following year.\n\nSeveral obstacles stand in the way of connecting the two restored navigable sections of the canal – a 1970s housing development at Killamarsh, the M1 motorway and the collapsed Norwood Tunnel. The Chesterfield Canal Partnership, a consortium of local authorities working with the Trust and others, has developed feasible plans to deal with each of these difficulties over the nine remaining miles of abandoned waterway.\n\nRestoring navigation north of Staveley, where an 1892 mineral railway bridge left insufficient headroom for canal traffic, necessitated constructing a dropped pound between two new locks, Staveley Town Lock, no 5a, and Railway Lock, no 5b.\n\nThe intention is to restore the surviving eastern section of Norwood Tunnel, leading to three ponds, created in the landscaping of the former Kiveton Park Colliery, capable of being developed as a marina.\n\nBeyond a 400-metre intact length, the Norwood Tunnel is irretrievable because of subsidence, infilling by the National Coal Board and the construction of the M1 motorway in the 1960s. Instead, a new surface channel is proposed, using an existing farm-road underpass to cross beneath the motorway, with a cutting and locks to reach the level of the existing tunnel and the summit pound at Kiveton Park.\n\nSome aspects of the restoration plans were compromised by the announcement in 2012 of the preferred route for the HS2 railway line. Four-and-a-half years of campaigning by the Trust, strongly supported by members of the public, contributed to the decision to reroute HS2 to an alignment to the east.\n\nForty years of hard work have demonstrated the practicability of restoring a completely abandoned waterway, yet there is still much work to do. Other restorations, such as the Kennet & Avon, Huddersfield Narrow and Rochdale Canals, have led the way; other mutilated waterways in the Trent Valley – the Cromford, Derby, and Grantham Canals – will return to navigation, even if they take decades to accomplish.\n\nHollingwood Hub is owned by Derbyshire County Council and operated by the Chesterfield Canal Trust as a resource for members of the public to use: http://www.chesterfield-canal-trust.org.uk/restoration/hollingwood-hub.\n\nThe coffee shop is open from Wednesday to Sunday and on Bank Holidays.\n\nThe 60-page, A4 handbook for the 2018 ‘Waterways and Railways of the East Midlands’ tour, with text, photographs, maps and a reading list contains a section on the Chesterfield Canal and is available for purchase, price £15.00 including postage and packing. To order a copy, please click here or, if you prefer, send a cheque, payable to Mike Higginbottom, to 63 Vivian Road, Sheffield, S5 6WJ.\n\nThe South Yorkshire Transport Trust at Eastwood, Rotherham, is a much more hard-core enthusiasts’ affair than its companion down the road at Aldwarke.\n\nIts occasional opening days are populated by individuals of a certain age brandishing serious cameras – a stereotype I find it remarkably easy to fit into – and these events seem to attract visiting vehicles from far and wide.\n\nFormerly located in the former Tinsley Tram Sheds, in 2017 the collection moved to a former nut factory. (There’s a health-warning about allergies at the entrance.) It’s a businesslike location that already looks and smells like a bus garage – fragrant with diesel oil, rubber and sun-dried upholstery.\n\nThe core fleet is considerable and includes an immaculate village bus of 1963 from Cyprus, an American school bus dating from 1989, as well as buses that operated away from South Yorkshire – Devon General, East Kent, Eastern National, Lothian and Greater Manchester.\n\nThere is an impressive collection of South Yorkshire double-deckers mostly from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, many of them awaiting full restoration.\n\nIn some cases, their parlous condition is the result of vandal attacks when they were stored in the open. The Eastwood site offers much better security.\n\nAmong the stars of the collection is Sheffield 874 (7874 WJ) of 1960, a tram-replacement vehicle that notched up sixteen years in public service followed by over forty years in preservation, and has run in every single one of those years.\n\nIf South Yorkshire ever instigates an authentic heritage bus service, as London has, here is the fleet.\n\nThe Trust’s website is at http://www.sytt.org.uk.\n\nSouth Yorkshire has two transport museums which grew independently out of an early project to turn the former Sheffield Tramways Company’s Tinsley Tram Sheds into a museum on a nationally significant transport-history site.\n\nAt the present time the oldest purpose-built tram depot in the UK is a tile-warehouse, and there are two separate collections of buses and other transport memorabilia within a couple of miles of each other in the suburbs of Rotherham.\n\nThe South Yorkshire Transport Museum at Aldwarke is family friendly. There’s plenty for children to do, and much to entertain kids of all ages.\n\nIf you’ve lived in South Yorkshire and are over forty this place provides the disconcerting experience of finding once-familiar objects preserved in a museum.\n\nIt has a rich collection of buses, most of them well preserved and the rest under restoration, from across South Yorkshire, as well as tower wagons, towing trucks and other vehicles including two milk floats.\n\nSome of the buses are available for hire, and do a roaring trade in weddings and birthdays.\n\nThere’s even a matchstick model of a railway locomotive.\n\nTucked away in a corner is the lower saloon of a Sheffield tram, no 460 built in 1926. It’s a rare survivor, sold rather than scrapped in 1951, and now repainted in an approximation of the authentic livery. Step inside to look at the models and memorabilia and hear an evocative sound-recording of trams in motion that makes up for its incomplete state.\n\nThere’s also a café, serving hot and cold drinks, sandwiches and snacks, and a shop full of souvenirs and arcana to satisfy the most deep-dyed transport enthusiast.\n\nVisitor information is at https://sytm.co.uk/visit/opening.html.\n\nThe most substantial remnant of Sheffield’s first-generation tram system is the original depot at Weedon Street, Tinsley, built in 1873 for the Sheffield Tramways Company when it opened its first horse-drawn line.\n\nThis very early tramway was founded by the railway contractor Thomas Lightfoot, who also built the Douglas horse-tramway that opened in 1876 and still operates in the Isle of Man.\n\nTinsley Tram Sheds is possibly the oldest remaining purpose-built tram depot in the UK.\n\nWhen the Sheffield Corporation took over the horse-tram company, its first electric trams, inaugurated in 1899, ran between Weedon Street and Nether Edge, with a depot at each end, and for the first few years vehicles were maintained and eventually built at the two depots – mechanical parts at Tinsley, bodywork at Nether Edge – until a purpose-built works at Queen’s Road opened in 1905.\n\nA well-made film of a tram-journey from Beauchief to Weedon Street in 1960 ends with Roberts car 523 disappearing into the tramsheds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0a28Q_78eM [at 16:45 minutes].\n\nAlmost all Sheffield’s trams, including the very last in service and those in the final closing procession in October 1960, ended up at Weedon Street, from where they were towed across the road to Thomas W Ward’s scrapyard.\n\nSheffield people customarily referred to “tramsheds”, though all of them across the city were substantial brick buildings. Apart from Tinsley, they have either disappeared or survive only as sad facades.\n\nAt one time Tinsley Tramsheds was home to Sheffield’s bus museum, until a schism led to one collection moving out to Aldwarke near Rotherham to become the South Yorkshire Bus Museum and the other, the South Yorkshire Transport Trust, eventually moving to Eastwood in a nearby part of Rotherham.\n\nLittle remains of the tram-depot interior: the tracks, inspection pits and overhead gantries that gave exterior access to trams at upper-deck level have long gone. The whole of the spacious interior is currently occupied by a tile-depot.\n\nA glass-half-empty report from the Hallamshire Historic Buildings Society suggests that the building is deteriorating: http://hhbs.org.uk/2017/07/01/trams-to-tiles.\n\nNevertheless, this Grade II-listed relic of transport history, located between the Meadowhall shopping centre and Sheffield’s new Ikea store, close to a retail park and the Sheffield Arena, could be smartened up by a savvy developer.\n\nCracks in the tarmac of the forecourt show that the track-fan and stone setts survive, at least in part, waiting to be exposed.\n\nThe interior is a flexible space with scope for adaptation, and the exterior is capable of restoration as one of the few historic sites remaining in the Lower Don Valley.\n\nI’ve known, ever since the days when I ran country-house tours for Nottingham University, that the people who manage National Trust property contribute to its atmosphere.\n\nSo, on my first visit to the recently acquired Stoneywell, just outside Leicester, the warmth of the welcome was striking even on a chilly autumn afternoon.\n\nThere’s literally nowhere to park at this property, so visitors are greeted with a minibus at the car-park down the lane. There is a shop in the stables, and a modest café in the old laundry which is warmed by the original copper.\n\nStrolling in the garden, a survival of the ancient Charnwood Forest, it’s difficult to remember that the outer suburbs of Leicester are only a couple of miles away to the east, and the M1 motorway is barely half a mile to the west.\n\nThe house itself is an overgrown cottage, hunched into the hillside rather like an upmarket hobbit house. It’s built of local materials, and grows organically from the hillside on which it stands, so that its three floors in fact have six different levels on a zig-zag ground plan.\n\nIt’s a hugely significant building, commissioned by Sydney Gimson (1860-1938), son of the founder of a Leicester engineering company that built steam engines and other machinery. It was completed in 1899.\n\nSydney Gimson bought enough land in Charnwood Forest to provide plots for his older half-brother, Mentor, and his younger sister, Margaret.\n\nHe commissioned his younger brother Ernest Gimson (1864-1919) to design Stoneywell, and employed the architect Detmar Blow (1867-1939) as clerk of works.\n\nBoth Gimson and Blow were devotees of the Arts & Crafts movement: Detmar Blow believed that architects should get their hands dirty, which slowed things down and caused some irritation; Ernest Gimson was closely associated with the Birmingham-born brothers Ernest and Sidney Barnsley, with whom he set up a workshop at Sapperton, Gloucestershire.\n\nFor two generations, until the 1950s, Stoneywell was a country retreat for the summer and Christmas, a place of adventure for the children of the family and their friends, and an opportunity to live a simpler life far removed from their town house and the engineering factory in nearby Leicester.\n\nThis much-loved place was too good to give up, and so passed down the family, on Sidney’s death in 1938 to his son Basil (who taught at Bedales School, where his uncle Ernest designed the library).\n\nA fire destroyed the thatched roof in 1937 but most of the cottage and its contents survived and were restored, with a roof of local Swithland slate, by Basil’s brother Humphrey Gimson (1890-1982).\n\nWhen Basil died in 1953, the house passed to his son Donald (born 1924) who gently modernised it for year-round living: he sold it to the National Trust in 2012 and continues to make periodic visits.\n\nContinuity of ownership means that this exquisite dwelling retains most of its original contents, with tables, chairs, beds and fittings designed and made by Ernest Gimson and the Barnsley brothers.\n\nIt’s a testament to the Arts & Crafts values that William Morris promoted through the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Buildings and the Art Workers’ Guild.\n\nThe simple life is all well and good. Janet Ashbee, wife of the architect Charles Robert Ashbee, writes that the artist Roger Fry tried the simple life but found it too complicated and had to give it up.\n\nThe Gimsons made it work, shinning up narrow staircases and a ladder to bed well into old age.\n\nAnd now its beauty is accessible to everyone – provided they book a timed ticket to prevent overcrowding.\n\nAlof de Wignacourt (1547-1622) is a towering figure in Malta’s history. His name is everywhere on the island.\n\nOne of the most popular of the Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller who ruled the island from 1530, the young Wignacourt first attracted attention at the Siege of Malta in 1565.\n\nAfter his election as Grand Master in 1601 he undertook an ambitious programme of public works to improve and protect the island and particularly its newly-established capital of Valletta.\n\nBetween 1610 and 1620 he constructed, at his own expense, six formidable watchtowers along Malta’s east coast to keep an eye on unfriendly vessels at the crossroads of Mediterranean shipping routes. Four of these survive – the eponymous Wignacourt Tower at St Paul’s Bay (1610), the St Lucian Tower at Marsaxlokk (1610-11), the St Thomas Tower at Marsaskala (1614) and St Mary’s Tower on the island of Comino (1618).\n\nFurther series of watch towers were built by subsequent Grand Masters Giovanni Paolo Lascaris (in office 1636-1657) and Martin de Redin (in office 1657-1660), but they are generally smaller and less elaborate than the Wignacourt Towers.\n\nHis other major engineering achievement was to bring fresh drinking water to the rapidly growing city of Valletta by means of the Wignacourt Aqueduct.\n\nThe preceding Grand Master Martin Garze (in office 1595-1601) had planned an aqueduct to run some sixteen miles from inland springs at Dingli and Rabat, but hadn’t made much progress for lack of funds.\n\nWignacourt took over and largely financed the project, and completed it within five years. The line runs from Attard, maintaining a constant gradient through underground pipes, and crossing depressions with arcades of limestone arches cemented with pozzolana, a volcanic ash of cement.\n\nIt continued to supply water to Valletta and other towns along its route until the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nLong stretches remain as a monument to Wignacourt’s enterprise, along with other structures, such as the Wignacourt Arch, otherwise known as the Fleur-de-Lys Gate, demolished after an RAF lorry ran into it during the blackout in 1943, and reconstructed in 2012-14.\n\nThe community around the Gate takes its name from the three fleur-de-lys that appear on Wignacourt’s coat of arms.\n\nOther surviving structures include inspection towers at St Venera, Ħamrun and Floriana, and a series of fountains including the Wignacourt Fountain in the centre of Valetta.\n\nAlongside these physical achievements, Wignacourt has a claim on posterity as the patron of the artist Caravaggio (1571-1610), whose tempestuous career brought him to Malta in a brief period between 1607 and his expulsion from the Knights’ order at the end of the following year.\n\nDuring this time, as well as the two great canvases in St John’s Co-Cathedral in Valetta, ‘The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist’ and ‘Saint Jerome Writing’, Caravaggio painted a striking portrait ‘Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page’, now in the Louvre.\n\nOpposite Bognor Regis railway station stand two proud survivals of the town’s heyday – the Picturedrome Cinema, built as the Assembly Rooms in 1885, converted to full-time cinema operation in 1918 and still showing the latest releases [http://www.picturedromebognor.com/article.php?sec=cineinfo], and Reynolds’ Furniture Repository, dated 1911 on its façade.\n\nWhen King George V came to convalesce at Craigwell House nearby in 1929, his personal effects were transported by Reynolds, who later duly returned them to Windsor Castle.\n\nBy that time the Reynolds’ family business was already in its third generation.\n\nIt was founded by nineteen-year-old Samuel Reynolds, who set up shop at 13 West Street in 1867, three years after the railway reached the town, and two years after the Pier opened.\n\nHis business grew as “auctioneers, appraisers, house agents, cabinetmakers, upholsterers and undertakers.” It still survives and thrives to this day.\n\nThe cabinet-making business developed directly from coffin-manufacturing into a highly respected funeral-director business, which has continued to expand into branches in Chichester and Littlehampton. They can still provide the horse-drawn hearse which has been in the family for generations.\n\nDealing in real estate included expanding the company’s own premises, so that their High Street furniture store became the largest in town, and behind its art deco façade the interior was last refurbished in 2005.\n\nSelling furniture to Bognor people led naturally to a demand for storing furniture and other valuables, for which the 1911 Repository still provides an up-to-date service with its wooden cubicles from 100 cubic feet upwards.\n\nThe company celebrated its 150th anniversary in style in 2017: https://www.bognor.news/news/business/md-dominic-reynolds-pride-150-years-illustrious-history-prestigious-bognor-business. The patriarch is Norman Reynolds, the founder’s great-grandson; his four sons are all involved – Dominic (furniture), James and Stephen (funerals) and Matthew (finance and accounting).\n\nDominic’s daughter Freya, Samuel Reynolds’ great-great-great-granddaughter, has now joined the company.\n\nNorman Reynolds himself has fifteen grandchildren and one great-grandchild, which suggests that the family are likely to serve Bognor for generations to come: http://www.reynoldsfurniture.co.uk/about-us.\n\nTheir biggest advertisement is the grand repository building directly opposite the railway station at the gateway to the town.\n\nKing George V famously didn’t like Bognor, where he was sent to recuperate after surgery in 1929. After his stay at Craigwell House in nearby Aldwick, he received a petition to grant the town the suffix “Regis” – literally, “of the King”. I can’t possibly tell the story better than Wikipedia, citing Antonia Fraser’s The house of Windsor (2000):\n\nThe petition was presented to Lord Stamfordham, the King’s Private Secretary, who in turn delivered it to the King. King George supposedly replied, “Oh, bugger Bognor.” Lord Stamfordham then went back to the petitioners and told them, “the King has been graciously pleased to grant your request.”\n\nLike many small seaside resorts at the ends of branch lines, Bognor is a rather sad place today, but it has a proud history as a genteel place to relax, founded in the late eighteenth century by the local landowner Sir Richard Hotham, and more energetically developed after the arrival of the branch railway in 1864.\n\nIt’s hardly an accident that Bognor Pier was begun in the same year, designed by Sir Charles Fox and his cousin J W Wilson and opened in 1865. Originally a thousand feet long, it cost £5,000, but was subsequently bought for £1,200 by the Local Board in 1876.\n\nThe Board’s successor, Bognor Urban District Council, were glad to offload it to a private operator, who spent £30,000 dealing with dilapidations and constructing an entertainment complex at the shore end, comprising a theatre with a fly-tower, a picture theatre, an amusement arcade and a roof-garden restaurant, all of which opened in 1912.\n\nDuring the Second World War, from 1943-45, the pier was HMS St Barbara, a naval observation station armed with anti-aircraft guns.\n\nIts history became vexed from the 1960s onwards: repeated changes of ownership meant that maintenance failed to keep up with onslaughts of storm damage.\n\nThough it’s listed Grade II and the pier head building remains in part, only 350 feet of the pier itself survives, and repeated attempts to attract lottery funding for a major restoration have fallen apart.\n\nMost recently, the energetic friends’ group, Bognor Pier Trust, learned that the current owners, Bognor Pier Leisure Ltd (BPLL), would not support a £5,000,000 lottery bid but were committed to maintaining the structure: https://www.bognor.co.uk/news/future-of-bognor-pier-plunged-into-uncertainty-after-owners-withdraw-support-for-5m-funding-bid-1-7653934 and http://www.bognorpiertrust.co.uk/news-articles/no-lottery-bid-bognor-regis-pier.\n\nThe Trust has made a dignified decision to concentrate on other conservation projects in the town, and to remain ready to purchase the Pier if the current owners decide to sell.\n\nWhere that leaves the long-term future of the Pier itself remains to be seen.\n\nThe Friends of Zion Graveyard have made great progress since their inauguration last May: they have secured funds and bought the land from the United Reformed Church, and have continued to clear the graves which had become buried in undergrowth.\n\nIn the course of researching the Zion Congregational Church which stood on the site I’ve become fascinated by the history of the congregation, which stretches back almost continuously to the early history of Dissent in Sheffield.\n\nAttercliffe and Carbrook, two of the three villages in the Lower Don Valley, were centres of Puritan and later Dissenting activity from before the Civil War, when Hill Top Chapel was built as a chapel-of-ease to Sheffield Parish Church (now the Anglican Cathedral).\n\nThere was a college for training Dissenting clergy at Attercliffe Old Hall in the late seventeenth-century, and informal congregations worshipped in several locations north of Sheffield during the eighteenth century.\n\nA temporary chapel was built on the site that became the Zion Sabbath School in 1793, and a permanent building was erected on the opposite side of what became Zion Lane in 1805. The existing Sabbath School building dates from 1854, and a fine Romanesque brick chapel with a tower and spire was opened in 1863. This building was demolished after a fire in June 1987.\n\nThe 1863 chapel was founded on the energetic ministry of Rev John Calvert (1832-1922), who was invited to become minister in 1857.\n\nHis leadership made Zion Church prominent, until its attendances exceeded any other place of worship in Attercliffe. Zion members helped to form branch churches in Brightside and Darnall, and a mission church at Baldwin Street, half a mile away.\n\nWhen Mr Calvert retired to Southport in 1895 he named his house ‘Attercliffe’.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century Zion was the largest Congregational community, measured by membership, in Sheffield: it had four hundred members when the four city-centre chapels had around three hundred each.\n\nTo accommodate the Sunday School and young people’s activities, in 1911 the congregation opened an extensive Institute next to the chapel, designed by the Sheffield architects Hemsoll & Chapman, whose best surviving building is Cavendish Buildings on West Street. When first built, the Institute offered football, cricket, tennis, a gymnasium and a literary and debating section to young members of the congregation.\n\nThis vigorous Christian community filled its extensive buildings for only twenty years. By 1930 the Sabbath School was leased as a printing works, and after the Second World War rooms in the Institute were leased to the Ministry of Works for use by civil-service departments.\n\nGale-damage in 1962 made the church itself unusable, and services moved next door into the Institute. Zion Congregational Church closed entirely at the end of 1969 when the congregation amalgamated with Darnall Congregational Church.\n\nPhotographic evidence shows that the Institute building was completely demolished by July 1977.\n\nThe Church continued to be used as a furniture store until a serious fire on June 22nd 1987 led to its subsequent demolition.\n\nNow only the Sabbath School and the graveyard remain – unobtrusive monuments to a long, proud tradition of Nonconformist worship in north Sheffield.\n\nThree times I’ve travelled by train from Melbourne to Sydney – never, as it happens, in the opposite direction.\n\nI wrote up the first journey in a blog article about my introduction to travel in Australia in 2010-11, when I was completely oblivious of the border between the states of Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nThe second time, the border was very obvious, because I took the train only as far as Albury, where until 1962 you had to change trains because the two states’ rail systems were built to different gauges.\n\nBy my third trip, early in 2017, I felt I was beginning to find my way around. I’m used to the fact that the daytime train from Melbourne’s Southern Cross Station doesn’t always leave on time. Indeed, it often doesn’t arrive until after it’s due to depart.\n\nThere’s a good reason for this.\n\nThe New South Wales’ Railways XPT trains that operate the inter-state TrainLink service are based on the British High Speed Train. The sound of the power cars’ Paxman engines is immediately recognisable to British ears.\n\nThese Australian workhorses have been in use since 1982, whereas the British version began operating in 1976, and with overhauls and modifications both continue to give sterling service.\n\nThe Australian-built version was adapted at the outset for the different conditions down under: the engines are down-rated and the suspension enhanced to cope with inferior track and longer distances; the Australian power cars have headlights at roof level to cope with the darkness of the empty rural areas at night. The trailer cars are completely different from the British Mark III carriages, designed instead under licence from the American Budd company by the Australian builder Comeng.\n\nThe astonishing thing about these 35-year-old veterans is the intensity of their schedules.\n\nWhile one unit runs seven days a week between Sydney and Dubbo and back (287 miles each way), the others run an intensive seven-day carousel between Sydney and Melbourne (637 miles each way, Grafton (in the north of New South Wales, 432 miles each way), Melbourne again, Casino (north of Grafton, 500 miles from Sydney) and Brisbane (over the border in Queensland, 614 miles each way).\n\nDuring this weekly routine each unit is serviced at Sydney only three times.\n\nThere isn’t a great deal of leeway, which explains why departures from Southern Cross are often delayed.\n\nUntil they are replaced sometime in the next few years, these tough trains earn their keep and represent outstanding value for money."
