John Hotham.\n\nBiography\n\nFrom Hullsweb History of Hull:\n\nBefore the thirteenth century dawned, the Hothams had established themselves at Scorborough. They held this under the Percys, who were then at Leconfield Castle. John-de-Hotham was the first to take up residence there, though still under the age of 21. Scorborough was in their possession until it was burnt down in the eighteenth century.\n\nThen we come to the most famous of all Hothams, especially in the annals of East Yorkshire. Sir John Hotham, the first Baronet, Governor of Hull and his son John, usually known as Captain Hotham. The elder Hotham was knighted in 1621 by James I. He also had five wives in twenty-eight years and was returned as Member of Parliament for both Appleby in Westmorland and Beverley. He decided to sit for Beverley as it was nearer, and because he thought he could exercise more influence there. In 1641, the Royalist army had left an arsenal in Hull. King Charles I wrote to Sir John Hotham announcing his intention to join his son, James, Duke of York, who was already in the town. (Hotham had been invested with full authority by both Houses of Parliament, to maintain and retain the guns and ammunition in all circumstances). On 23rd April 1642, he called a meeting at his residence, now called Ye Olde White Hart Inn (dubbed by the then locals, The Plotting Parlour). With a majority vote, the gates of Hull were closed to the King. Sir Hotham tried to explain the divided opinion of the town to him, but he was dubbed a traitor. Civil war was imminent. A three-week Royalist siege of Hull ensued. Sir Hotham escaped but was arrested near his Manor in Scorborough. Taken to London on board the ship 'The Hercules,' Sir John and his son were imprisoned in the Tower. The Commons issued an order that money, plots and good of Sir John and Captain Hotham be seized and £1000 be used to pay the garrison of Hull and £500 to pay soldiers at Beverley.\n\nOn 30 November 1644, Sir John was brought before a court martial at the Guildhall London. His son Durrand of Lockington, who was a lawyer, conducted his defence, though to no avail, and he was condemned to be executed on 16 December.\n\nLady Hotham tried without success for a pardon, but only got a stay of execution until 24 December to give her husband more time to settle his affairs. A petition was sent to the Commons that Sir John's life should be spared, but after some wrangling between the Lords and the Lower House, it was dismissed and the execution was announced for 4 January.\n\nAs Captain Hotham, his son, had also been found guilty and was to be executed on 1 January, it was decided that the father should follow him to the block the next day, 2 January, 1645.\n\nOn the scaffold, Captain Hotham proclaimed the innocence of himself and his father and laid his head on the block. With one blow, his head was severed from his body. His brother, Durand Hotham wrapped it in a scarf and laid it with his body in a coffin. In a similar fashion, also with one blow, Sir John Hotham died at the age of fifty-six and was buried in All Hallows, Barking. This is how the historian A.W.M. Stirling wrote of Captain Hotham's death:\n\n'The night preceding the execution of the young officer, his wife Isabel, from whom he had been separated during his imprisonment, was allowed to visit him in the Tower. She quitted him only in the morning when he was led out to die. And in the dawning of that year, which to the one was to bring death and the other bereavement, the sorrowful couple bid each other a last fare well. Nine months later Isabel gave birth to a son, Henry, but who, the child of tears and grief, sank to an early grave.'\n\nCaptain Hotham left one son, John, 13, who inherited the estate.\n\nJohn Hotham had been married five times; first to Catherine, by whom he had Captain Hotham, Richard, Margaret and Frances; secondly Anne, by whom he had William and Durand; then third to Jane by whom he had several children, all of whom died in infancy; fourth to Catherine, who had 2 children, both of whom died in infancy; and lastly to Sarah Anlaby, in 1634, by whom he had Dorothy (died aged 9 in 1645), Alathea, Sarah and Catherine.\n\nSir John Hotham and Family\n\nBritish Civil Wars\n\nLanded Family and Estate Papers Subject Guide - Hotham family, of Scorborough and South Dalton\n\nwikipedia.org\n\nthepeerage.com\n\nSir John was knighted in 1621 by James 1. He had 5 wives in 28 years and was returned as a Member of Parliament for both Appleby in Westmorland and Beverley.

Sir John Hotham escaped but was arrested near his manor in Scorborough. Taken to London on board the ship \"The Hercules\" Sir John and his son Sir John (Captain) Hotham were imprisoned in the Tower. The commons issued an order that money, plots and good of Sir John and Capt. Hotham be seized and 1000 pounds be used to pay the garrison of Hull and 500 pounds to pay the soldiers at Beverley.

On 2nd Jan. 1645 Sir John was beheaded with one blow at the age of 56. He was buried at All Hallows, Barking.
