        "text": "Hothoom History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon name Hothoom comes from the family having resided in the settlement of Holtham or Houghham in Lincolnshire.\n\nToday, Hotham is a small village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, where \"the manor was for many generations the property of the Hotham family.\" 1\n\nThe name is \"assumed from the place of residence, Hotham in Yorkshire, probably derived from the Saxon word Hod, a hood or covering, and ham, a house, farm, or village, or a piece of ground near a house or village, both of which terms are applicable to the situation of Hotham. Houtham signifies a place at or near a wood, from the Dutch Hout, a wood.\" 2\n\nEarly Origins of the Hothoom family\n\nThe surname Hothoom was first found in Yorkshire, where they claim descent from \"Peter de Trehouse, who assumed the local name of Hotham, and was living in the year 1188.\" 3\n\nThe brisk winds of time have dusted off some rather interesting entries about the Hothoom family. Robert de Hotham was found in the Assize Rolls for Lincolnshire in 1202 and later, Walter de Hothum was listed in the Subsidy Rolls for Yorkshire in 1327. 4\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 included only one entry for the family, that of Robert de Hothum, Yorkshire. John de Hotham was Bishop of Ely, 19 Edward I (during the 19th year of King Edward I's reign.) 5\n\nThe Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 also had only one entry for the family, Johannes de Hothum. 6\n\nWilliam of Hothum, also called Hodon and Odone, (d. 1298), was \"Archbishop of Dublin, an Englishman who joined the Dominican order, and studied at Paris at the convent of the Jacobins, and became licentiate of theology in 1280, and afterwards doctor. He is often identified with the William de Hothum who was a fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1286; but this William is more probably a kinsman who between 1302 and 1306 was a prebendary of Swords in St. Patrick's, Dublin.\" 7\n\nJohn Hothum or Hotham (d. 1337), was Bishop of Ely and Chancellor, \"a younger son of a good Yorkshire family, was a clerk in the service of Edward II, and was when rector of Cottingham in Yorkshire appointed Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer in 1309, and the next year received from the king a prebend at York, and held the office of escheator beyond the Trent.\" 7\n\nEarly History of the Hothoom family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Hothoom research. Another 170 words (12 lines of text) covering the years 1316, 1584, 1610, 1615, 1617, 1621, 1622, 1632, 1645, 1655, 1663, 1672, 1689, 1691, 1693, 1723, 1736, 1738, 1765, 1767, 1806, 1813 and 1855 are included under the topic Early Hothoom History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nHothoom Spelling Variations\n\nHothoom has been spelled many different ways. Before English spelling became standardized over the last few hundred years, spelling variations in names were a common occurrence. As the English language changed in the Middle Ages, absorbing pieces of Latin and French, as well as other languages, the spelling of people's names also changed considerably, even over a single lifetime. Spelling variants included: Hotham, Hothan, Hothum, Hothun and others.\n\nEarly Notables of the Hothoom family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include Charles Hotham (ca. 1615-1672), an English cleric. The Hotham Baronets of Scorborough in the County of York, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1622. The family seat is Dalton Hall, Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire. The boronets include: Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet, of Scorborough (died 1645), English parliamentarian; Sir John Hotham, 2nd Baronet (1632-1689), an English politician; Sir John Hotham, 3rd Baronet (1655-1691), an English politician; Sir Charles Hotham, 4th Baronet (c. 1663-1723); Sir Charles Hotham, 5th Baronet (1693-1738); Sir Charles Hotham, 6th...\n\nAnother 90 words (6 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Hothoom Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Hothoom family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Hothoom family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 42 words (3 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Hothoom family\n\nIn an attempt to escape the chaos experienced in England, many English families boarded overcrowded and diseased ships sailing for the shores of North America and other British colonies. Those families hardy enough, and lucky enough, to make the passage intact were rewarded with land and a social environment less prone to religious and political persecution. Many of these families became important contributors to the young colonies in which they settled. Early immigration and passenger lists have documented some of the first Hothooms to arrive on North American shores: John Hotham, who sailed to Virginia in 1715; Richard Hotham to Philadelphia in 1774; Ann Hotham to New York with her child in 1820; and S. Hothan to Savannah, Georgia in 1820..\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\nLewis, Samuel, A Topographical Dictionary of England.
