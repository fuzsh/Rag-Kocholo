        "text": "Start of Trail\n\nThe start of the trail is Hotham Park House at the south east corner of Hotham Park close to the bandstand. The house was acquired and renovated in 1977 by Mr Abraham Singer and converted into luxury flats which today are private residences.\n\nHotham Park House is Grade II* listed and is surrounded by 9 hectares (22 acres) of parkland which is open to the public.\n\nSir Richard first visited Bognor in 1784 during a period of ill health to take the benefits of sea bathing. The benefits of sea water in the treatment of diseases of the glands was reported by Richard Russell in 1750, thereby starting the trend of the Sussex coast as seaside spas.\n\nAt the start of his grand plans for the town (then a small hamlet), he acquired some 1,600 acres of land for his project. Sir Richard paid £700 for 35 acres immediately west of the current Royal Norfolk Hotel and a field close to Bognor Lodge on which he was to build Chapel House (Today known as Hotham Park House). (1)\n\nSir Richard Hotham was not new to property development. In 1764 he purchased Moat Farm in Merton in Surrey and developed it into Merton Place, which became the future home of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton.\n\nAt Bognor Sir Richard Hotham converted a farmhouse into his first mansion in 1787 named Bognor Lodge. This building was demolished in 1937.\n\nHotham Park House was built to the north of the Lodge in 1792 as his main residence in Bognor. Known then as Chapel House it included a private chapel built at the rear of the house and the clock tower.\n\nFrom 1815, the House was renamed Bersted Lodge (An image of Bersted Lodge from 1841 can be downloaded from RIBA Architecture website Image Pix Ref RIBA85142).\n\nJohn Ballett Fletcher purchased the property on the 18th May 1857 for £8,500, he demolished the chapel shortly after in 1859 but the clock tower was retained.\n\nIn 1899, it was renamed Aldwick Manor by his son William Holland Ballett Fletcher who was Lord of the Manor of Aldwick at the time. He moved to the property in 1900 with his wife Agnes who had an interest in reptiles; her pets included pythons, boa constrictors, small crocodiles and giant lizards. William’s own interest was Arboriculture and he spent a fortune laying out the grounds and planting them with magnificent trees and shrubs. He also built a lake with water lilies and large goldfish. The fruits of his work we see today as Hotham Park. (1)\n\nDuring the war the building was requisitioned and leased to Government ministries.\n\nThe building was acquired by Bognor Regis Urban District Council in 1946 along with the grounds and neighbouring land and opened to the public in 1947.\n\nThe Listed building status describes the building comprising 2 storeys and semi basement, 10 windows Stuccoed Cornice and parapet. 2 large bays, which are linked on the ground, floor by an arcaded verandah raised above ground level. Above the verandah is an iron balcony with hood supported on trellis columns (this was removed during renovations in 1977). The building demonstrates many of the attributes of Regency style.\n\nHothamton Crescent, comprised three separate buildings; Dome House, Mordington and St Michaels’s originally containing seven residences. All three buildings were built by Sir Richard Hotham in the 1790’s with the aim of attracting Royalty to his developing resort away from Weymouth and Brighton.\n\nDome House is Bognor’s only Grade I listed building and was the centrepiece of the crescent. The building is constructed with multi coloured bricks with an imposing front entrance and is surmounted with a plaque of Hothamton Crescent and coat of arms of Sir Richard Hotham.\n\nThe building originally formed three residencies 123 feet long with around 50 rooms and a tea room under the dome. (1) It was designed in size and scale for its intended affluent clientele. Anthony Dale who was an architectural historian described Dome House as one of the finest example of buildings of the period on the South Coast.\n\nSir Richard’s ambition of bringing royalty to his bathing resort came in September 1796 when the then Prince of Wales came to visit his mistress Lady Jersey who was staying at Dome House. (1) The Prince Regent’s daughter, Charlotte, was a summer visitor from 1808 to 1811.\n\nIn 1946 the building was acquired by West Sussex County Council as a teaching centre for troops returning from the War as part of their repatriation.\n\nBognor Regis’s tradition as a centre for Education and learning and the subsequent formation of the Bognor Regis Campus of Chichester University are intertwined as a part of this story.\n\nSt Michael’s on the right and to the south contained two residencies and was the home of Arthur Saunders, the 3rd Earl of Arran (Viscount Sudley), who renamed the building Arran Lodge. It was further renamed Lennox Lodge by Lord George Lennox brother of the 5th Duke of Richmond.\n\nThe Building is Grade II listed and subsequently became a Woodard Foundation school for girls in 1856 but evacuated during World War 2.\n\nTo the left of Dome House is Mordington, formerly known as West Lodge, which again was an impressive building in its time. The House was purchased by Richard Hasler in the 1800’s and remained a family home for over 50 years.\n\nToday all three buildings are part of the Bognor Regis Campus continuing the education and learning heritage.\n\nThe Icehouse was originally part of the Hotham Park Estate and gives you some idea of the size and extent of the original grounds. It is thought to date back to 1792 for storage and preservation of food for the House. The brick structure as seen today would originally been covered with a layer of soil with trees planted around it for shade.\n\nThe entrance is north facing and the vault below ground would have been floored with pebbles for drainage and the vault packed with ice and straw as part of the preservation process. William Fletcher continued to use the Ice House for preserving ice up to about 1914. (1)\n\nThe Ice House is 6 metres deep and about four metres in diameter and is considered to be one of the only surviving undamaged examples of an Ice House in West Sussex. Owned by Arun District Council as part of the Hotham Park estate it was restored in 1970.\n\nThe Ice House completes the Sir Richard Hotham element of Trail 3 and walkers can either carry on and visit the Railway Station and Picturedrome cinema a short walk along London Road. Alternatively walk through the Car Park and explore Hotham Park and explore its many attractions including the Tree Trail, miniature railway, Alice in Wonderland characters, Forest Falls Adventure golf or have a drink or snack at the café."
