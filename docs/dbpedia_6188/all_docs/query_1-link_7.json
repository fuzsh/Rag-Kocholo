        "text": "Sussex is one of the most historic and interesting counties in the UK.\n\nPeople have lived in Sussex for over half a million years, with the oldest human fossil ever discovered in the UK coming from Chichester.\n\nSussex as we know it was founded in 477 AD as the Kingdom of Sussex by Ælle - the first king of Sussex.\n\nThe name 'Sussex' comes from the Old English 'Sūþsēaxe', which means South Saxons.\n\nIt was formed as a Saxon colony and later became an independent kingdom, ruled by the kings of Sussex for about 300 years.\n\nBut how did each of the county's towns and cities get their names, and what did they used to be called?\n\nWe have taken a look at the origin and meaning of place names in Sussex and compiled a detailed list in alphabetical order below.\n\nArundel\n\nName in 1750: Arundel\n\nArundel's name comes from Old English 'Harhunedell', which means \"valley of horehound\".\n\nLocal people however believe the name comes from the Old French word arondelle, meaning \"swallow\".\n\nAs a result, swallows appear on the town's coat of arms.\n\nBattle\n\nName in 1750: Battle\n\nThe town of Battle gets its name from the Battle of Hastings, fought between Harold the Saxon and William the Conqueror in 1066. The battle changed the course of English history, and left a permanent mark on this small town.\n\nBexhill\n\nName in 1750: Bexhill\n\nBexhill was first referred to in 772 AD, then known as Bexelei. It was originally little more than a village atop a hill, and its name literally translates to \"place where the box tree grows.\"\n\nBognor Regis\n\nName in 1750: Bognor\n\nBognor Regis was developed by Sir Richard Hotham in the late 18th century, on the site of the old village of Bognor.\n\nThe name Bognor comes from the old English 'Bucgan ora' meaning Bucge's shore.\n\nThe Regis suffix was added in the early 20th Century, when King George V added it by royal decree.\n\nBrighton\n\nName in 1750: Brighthelmstone\n\nBrighton first appeared written down as 'Bristelmestune', although more than 40 variations have been documented over the years.\n\n'Brighton' was originally an informal shortened form; it gradually overtook the longer name and was in general use from the late 18th century, although Brighthelmstone remained the town's official name until 1810.\n\nBurgess Hill\n\nName in 1750: Burgess Hill\n\nThe town's name comes from the Burgeys family name. The name Burgeys stood for 'bourgeois', which originally meant the inhabitant of a borough.\n\nThe Burgeys owned the hill, and Burgess Hill was named.\n\nThe residents of Burgess Hill could be forgiven for not knowing they live on Bourgeois Hill.\n\nChichester\n\nName in 1750: Chichester\n\nChichester, the only city in West Sussex, was captured towards the close of the fifth century by Ælle, the first king of Sussex.\n\nHe renamed the city after his son, Cissa, and made it the chief city of the Kingdom of Sussex.\n\nCrawley\n\nName in 1750: Crowley\n\nOne of the largest towns in Sussex, Crawley has been inhabited since Roman times.\n\nIn the 5th century, Saxon settlers named the area Crow's Leah, meaning a crow-infested clearing.\n\nCrowborough\n\nName in 1750: Crowborough\n\n'Croh' in Old English meant saffron or golden-yellow colour, and 'berg' meant hill. The yellow flowers of the gorse shrub grow in the Crowborough area, which may have given the Wealden town its name.\n\nEastbourne\n\nName in 1750: East Bourne\n\nThere are Roman buried beneath this town, dating back close to 2000 years.\n\nThe ancient river 'Burne' gives Eastbourne its name, the town East of the Burne. All that remains of the River Burne is a small pond in Motcombe Gardens.\n\nEast Grinstead\n\nName in 1750: East Grinstead\n\nAnother with a simple explanation, East Grinstead's name comes from the Old English 'grene stede' or green place.\n\nHailsham\n\nName in 1750: Hailsham\n\nThis town's name has been spelled in a variety of different ways: Hamelsham, Aylesham, Haylesham, and finally Hailsham.\n\nThe name is believed to have come from the Saxon for \"Haegels Ham\", meaning the 'ham', or settlement, of Haegel.\n\nHastings\n\nName in 1750: Hastings\n\nHastings, the town that gave its name to England's most famous battle, was first mentioned in the late 8th century in the form 'Hastingas'.\n\nThis is derived from the Old English tribal name Hæstingas, meaning 'the followers of Hæsta'.\n\nHastingleigh in Kent was also named after that same tribe.\n\nHaywards Heath\n\nName in 1750: Haywards Heath\n\nThe name Hayward comes from Old English, meaning an person who protected hedged enclosures from wandering livestock, or a 'ward of the hay'.\n\nThere's a local legend that the name comes from a local highwayman by the name of Jack Hayward.\n\nHeathfield\n\nName in 1750: Heathfield\n\nThe home of Olympic gold medallist Jayne Torvill, this town has perhaps the easiest name to track. Heathfield was simply named for the heath field on which it was founded.\n\nHorsham\n\nName in 1750: Horseham\n\nThe first record of Horsham is in 947 AD. The name either means 'horse home' or 'Horsa's home', after a Saxon warrior who was granted the land.\n\nHove\n\nName in 1750: Hooe\n\nOriginally pronounced Hoove, it is only recently that the new pronunciation has caught on.\n\nOld spellings of Hove include Hou, la Houue, Huu, Houve, Huve, Hova and Hoova.\n\nThere is great debate when it comes to the origin of the name.\n\nSuggestions included an Old Norse word meaning hall or sanctuary, an Old English phrase' æt þæm hofe' meaning \"at the hall\"; the Old English 'hufe' meaning shelter; and the Middle English 'hofe', meaning anchorage.\n\nLewes\n\nName in 1750: Lewes\n\nAnglo-Saxons in the 10th century built a motte-and-bailey upon a hill, and so the town of Lewes was born. The name Lewes first appeared in 961 AD, where it appears as Læwe and Laewes. The name means 'hills', from the Old English 'hlæw' meaning hill.\n\nLittlehampton\n\nName in 1750: Little Hampton\n\nA small village known as 'Hantone' appeared in the late 11th century.\n\nLater, as Littlehampton began to grow and develop as a port, the prefix 'Little' was added to 'Hantone' to distinguish it from Southampton further down the coast.\n\nMidhurst\n\nName in 1750: Midhurst\n\nThe name Midhurst was first written in 1186 as 'Middeherst', meaning 'middle wooded hill'.\n\nIt derives from the Old English words 'midd', meaning 'in the middle', plus 'hyrst', 'a wooded hill'.\n\nNewhaven\n\nName in 1750: Newhaven\n\nThe Saxons established a village near the River Ouse in 480 AD named Meeching.\n\nThe Ouse began to migrate eastwards, challenging the boundaries of the village. A new outlet (The Cut) was built on the river's present course, below Castle Hill. After that, the settlement began to be known as the \"new haven\".\n\nPeacehaven\n\nName in 1750: Not established\n\nPeacehaven was founded in 1916 by entrepreneur Charles Neville.\n\nThe town was initially known as New Anzac-on-Sea, to commemorate the ANZAC's (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) involvement in the Battle of Gallipoli.\n\nThe following year, realising that they could come up with a catchier name, the town was renamed Peacehaven.\n\nPetworth\n\nName in 1750: Pitworth\n\nPetworth's name literally means 'the pits in the woods'.\n\nThe name comes from derivation is from the word 'pit' describing a clay pit, plus the Old English word 'worp', which means wood.\n\nRye\n\nName in 1750: Rye\n\nThe name of Rye is believed to come from the old English 'rie', which means bank, or from the West Saxon 'ieg', meaning island.\n\nMedieval maps show that Rye was originally located on a huge embayment of the English Channel called the Rye Camber, which provided a safe anchorage and harbour.\n\nSeaford\n\nName in 1750: Seaforth\n\nThe most popular theory for the source of Seaford's name is a simple one; that the town was named for sitting on a ford near the sea.\n\nSeaford lies between the mouths of the Ouse and the Cuckmere, and could have been named as a ford on either river.\n\nSelsey\n\nName in 1750: Selsei\n\nThe name Selsey is derived from the Saxon phrase 'Seals-ey', which means the Isle of Sea Calves, or seals.\n\nThere have been at least twenty different spellings of the place, including:\n\nSeoles – Old English\n\nSeleisi – Domesday Book 1086\n\nCelesye – Assize Roll 1279\n\nThe town was at one time inaccessible at flood tide, and a boat was stationed at the ferry to take horses and passengers across the water.\n\nShoreham\n\nName in 1750: New Shoreham\n\nDespite what you may think, the name Shoreham probably doesn't actually refer to the shore.\n\nThe word 'shore' wasn't in use until the 14th Century, long after the town was named.\n\n'Scor', pronounced 'shor', was most likely the word that named this town. It is Old English for slope, probably describing Shoreham's position near the foot of Mill Hill.\n\nSteyning\n\nName in 1750: Steyning\n\nLegend has it that a young shepherd, who had to care for his paralysed mother after his father died, built a wheelbarrow to move his mother around in. They set out east towards the rising sun, and when the handle on his wheelbarrow broke, he accepted it as a sign from God to stop at that place and build a church. The handle broke at what is now known as Steyning.\n\nThe Shepherd, St Cuthmann, appears on many of the town's signs.\n\nThe name comes from the Old English 'Stainingas', meaning 'the dwellers ('ingas') at the stone ('stan').\n\nUckfield\n\nName in 1750: Ucfield\n\nUckfield was first recorded as 'Uckefeld' in 1220, an Anglo-Saxon place name meaning 'land belonging to a man called Ucca'.\n\nIt combines an Old English personal name, 'Ucca' with the Old English locational term, 'feld'.\n\nWadhurst\n\nName in 1750: Wakehurst\n\nThe name Wadhurst, first recorded as Wadeherst, is Anglo-Saxon and derives from 'Wada', the name of a Saxon tribe which occupied the area in the 7th or 8th century.\n\nWorthing\n\nName in 1750: Worthing\n\nThe largest town in West Sussex has been populated for over 6,000 years, and contains one of Britain's largest Iron Age hill forts in Cissbury Ring.\n\nThe name means 'place of Woro's people' coming from the Old English name Woro, and 'ingas', meaning 'people of'.\n\nThe town has gone by many names through the years: Weoroingas, Wurdingg and Worthen are just a few."
