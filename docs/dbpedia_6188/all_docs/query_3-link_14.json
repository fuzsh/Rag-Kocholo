        "text": "Here There and Any Old Where\n\nThe newsreel opens with an intertitle \"From Sir Richard Hotham's Bognor - to Bognor Regis of to-day\". The film shows a close-up of Sir Richard Hotham’s gravestone (the founder of Bognor). The intertitle \"How Bognor got its 'Regis'\" introduces scenes of King George V and Queen Mary on the road and arriving at Craigwell for the King’s convalescence. The Queen is filmed attending a church service. This is followed by scenes of crowds lining the streets of Bognor on the King’s departure. Bognor’s tribute to the King on his death shows the Union flag at half-mast, and a slow-marching procession of police, military and fire brigade.\n\nThe title \"Winter\" precedes scenes of people walking on the promenade in winter clothing on a windy day. After rough seas, bathing huts lay strewn in pieces on the beach. Crowds watch as people try to save their goods and the wreckage of the broken huts is seen smashing against the promenade, with further scenes of stormy seas.\n\nA 'Summer cloud burst' leads to scenes of flooding in Bognor Regis town centre and nearby Pulborough. Short scenes from a football match between Bognor and Chichester are followed by scenes of Cricketers at Bognor Cricket Club and onlookers, including a man in a large wicker wheelchair. A title reads ‘The Gresham’ and shows various men and women on a balcony and outside a house. Mahatma Gandhi is shown leaving his friend’s house in Bognor. Clergy, including the Bishop of Chichester, gather for the consecration of Aldwick Church. Freemasons from the Gordon and Felpham Lodge leave the church in their aprons and sashes after a service; two embroidered banners are carried from the church.\n\nAn advert states: \"For sparkling prints, take your film to Cleeves\". Several exterior shots of Cleeves’ Chemist shops at different locations around Bognor Regis - the High Street, the Esplanade, the Pier, West Parade, or Alnwick Road. Most bear large Kodak advertisements.\n\nScenes on the busy seafront show a bustling Bognor; cars and buses arrive and leave, some heading for London. The title ‘Eve’s Holiday Wear’ precedes scenes of women on the seafront and beach in beach attire. A woman in a swimsuit dances for the camera, another does handstands and they play leapfrog. On the very crowded beach, people seek out a spot, sit on the shingle or dry themselves after a swim. A deckchair attendant issues tickets, people paddle and bathe in the sea, children take donkey rides and pleasure boats arrive filled with passengers. A title reads \"Jack Allen presents the Express Girls\". They perform a high-kicking dance routine on the beach. Two women, one in Regency-style dress and poke bonnet, the other in 1930s halter-neck swimming costume and short bobbed hair pose for the camera.\n\nThe ‘Daily Mirror 8’ perform a marching and gymnastics routine on the grass near the seafront. A large crowd watch several other acts including a baton twirling, a high-kick dance routine and balancing acts. ‘Arthur Lang - Worlds Yo Yo Champion’ performs yo-yo tricks. An elephant walks through the street advertising the circus’s arrival in town. A procession of circus people, horses and baby elephants follow.\n\nA man on the beach addresses a crowd through a megaphone as lifeguards from the ‘Daily Sketch Lifesaving Team’ give a demonstration on the beach. Wearing life-guard uniforms with patrol caps and chinstraps, they demonstrate techniques for saving a drowning man. A steamer arrives at the crowded pier. Men board the Brighton Belle (Bristol). High-divers, including an escapologist and a man on a bicycle, dive from the end of the pier. There are scenes of visitors on the pier and on the promenade.\n\nSir Alan Cobham’s Air Circus featuring biplanes, the Autogyro and the Flying Flea, are shown on the ground and in flight. There are also wing-walking demonstrations. The Graf Zeppelin airship flies over houses. A sign reads 'Book here for flights' and people board one of Alan Cobham’s planes, including competition-winner Miss Verion, aged eighty. Aerial views over Bognor’s coast take in the rock gardens and the pier. The passengers are shown leaving the plane, including the smiling Miss Verion."
