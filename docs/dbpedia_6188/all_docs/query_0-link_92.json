        "text": "Thomas Elliot, chief executive and founder of Project Sunrise, appeared on the BBC South Today Programme on Sunday.\n\nHe said investors linked to the scheme were \"getting cold feet\" due to a \"lack of engagement\" from the council.\n\n“It can still go ahead,” said Mr Elliot. “The whole idea is to work in partnership with the local authority, Arun Arts, and the local community.\n\n“They [investors] are getting cold feet of course because it has been eight years now and there are other towns and cities they can go and regenerate.”\n\nIn 2015, Project Sunrise – then known as the Sir Richard Hotham Project – submitted plans for a hotel, a new Regis Centre, a 200-cover restaurant, apartments, and retail space but they were refused by Arun District Council.\n\nThe council said the plans did not fit in with its own vision for regenerating the town, adding that the developer does not own the land.\n\nThis includes the Regis Centre which is currently part leased by Whitbread – a hotel and restaurant company which the council is negotiating with regarding its own levelling up proposals.\n\nThe council's successful levelling up bid saw it secure £12.1 million in government funding for the venue, which would clearly conflict with Project Sunrise.\n\nBut the project can technically still go ahead as it was granted planning permission on appeal in 2018.\n\nUpon overturning the council’s decision to refuse the scheme, a planning inspector said: “Considered as a package the wider regeneration and other benefits to the town and area would be very significant.”\n\nBut successive council leaders have refused to support the privately funded project and this continues to be the case."
