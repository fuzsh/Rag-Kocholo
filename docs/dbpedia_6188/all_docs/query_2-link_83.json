        "text": "RT was a Navy Agent in Surrey Street, near the Strand. The site is now occupied by the Macadam Building of King's College London. He also had a house at Cranbourne in Dorset. See below. He probably inherited it from his father, Oliver Toulmin. He seems to have had a property at Plumley in Hampshire, which I can't trace.\n\nRT had two daughters, Harriet and Anna Blinco (who married Edward Bell).\n\nHarriet was actually born before RT married Harriet Sparrow. So Harriet was technically illegitimate. Anna was born after the marriage.\n\nIn 1805 or 1806 RT was thrown from his horse on Essex Street near the Strand. He went to his estate in Hampshire. He later suffered a stroke which paralysed him and he was officially declared a lunatic. He died in 1819.\n\nLondon Gazette, 1808, Jan 19\n\nWHereas by an Order made by the Lord High Chancellor\n\nof Great Britain in the Matter of Richard\n\nToulmin, Esq; a Lunatic, it was, amongst other Things, reffiru.\n\nd TO John Ord, Esq; oas of the Masters of the-High\n\nCourt oF Chancery, to take an Account of the Debts cor•»\n\ntrailed by Harriet Toulmin, the late Wife of the said Richard\n\nToulmin, tbe Lunatic, (who formeily resided in Surrey-\n\nStreet, in the Strand, in tbe Pariih of Saint Clement-\n\nDanes, in the County of Middlesex, and also at Cranboume,\n\nin the County of Dorset,) subsequently to the Lunacy of the\n\nsaid Richard Toulmin, which commenced on the ist Day of\n\nA\\igust 1806, down to the Time ofthe Decease of the said\n\nHarriet Toulmin, which happened on the 7th Day of April\n\n1807.—All Persons therefore to whom the said Harriet Toulmin\n\nbecame indebted during tbe Period aforesaid, are to\n\ncome in and prove ftich Debts before the faid Master, at his\n\nChambers in Southampton-Buildings, Chancery-Lane, London,\n\non or before the 20th Day qf February 1808, or in Default\n\nthereof they\n\n\"DUrsuant to an Order made by the Lord High Chnni>\n\ncellor of Great Britain in the Matter of Richard Toulmin,\n\nEsq; a Lunatic, the Creditors of the said Richard Toulmin,\n\nwho formerly tesided in Surrey-Street, in the Strand, in\n\nthe Parish of Saint Clement-Danes, in the County of Middlesex,-.\n\nand also at Cranboume, in tl>e County of Dorset, are\n\nto come in and prove their Debts before John Old, Esq; ode\n\nos the Masters of the High Court cf Chancery, at his Chambers\n\nin Southampton-Buildings, Chancery-Lane, London, oa\n\nor before the 20th Day of -February 1808, or in Default\n\nthereof they will he peremptorily excluded the Benefit of\n\nthe said Order.\n\nThis caused lots of problems. He was a lunatic, and it was questionable whether his will, which left lots of money to Harriet, who was technically illegitimate, was itself legitimate as he may have been of unsound mind when he made it, and he did not sign the codicil leaving the money to Harriet.\n\nThe will was contested, and probate was not actually granted until the late 1880s. This was part of a near-century-long lawsuit of a chain of contested wills that included several Sparrows. See National Archives, Brice vs Stoke, TS-33_26_001. Also look up Vesey Vol XI Reports_of_Cases_Argued_and_Determined_p319 on Google Books for a progress report dated about 1849. If anyone who knows about law could summarise it simply, I'd be really grateful.\n\n(Harriet herself sued John Harcourt Powell, Edward Bell & Anna Blinco his wife, Richard Toulmin North, Fredk. Booth, and Jno Fidkin and Mary Ann his wife over this. BTW Richard Toulmin North was also an interesting character. He was a senior office in the Coldstream Guards, but he too became a lunatic. He inherited the Toulmin family estate of Thurland Castle near Kirkby Lonsdale. See below.)\n\nHarriet Sparrow/Toulmin herself also became a lunatic. She died a spinster in 1850, and in 1852 the front page of the June 10 issue of the Times had a small ad, presumably placed by a lawyer, appealing for anyone who had a copy of her will to come forward.\n\nShe died intestate, and the Treasury got 50,000 quid.\n\nBTW Mrmaccy, I could have told you all this a few weeks ago. I sent you an ancestry.com message offering to help after you copied about 50 pictures and documents and more from my tree on ancestry. I also asked if you would make your tree public so I could see your information. It seemed only fair. But you didn't reply. I was, to tell the truth, a bit peeved.\n\nReference: D1721/1/10\n\nCreation dates: 7 May 1792\n\nhttps://www.a2a.org.uk/html/031-d1721.htm\n\nThe contents of this catalogue are the copyright of*Dorset Record Office.\n\nRights in the Access to Archives database are the property of the Crown, © 2001-2005.\n\nScope and Content\n\nDeed relating to Cranborne Lodge, Cranborne\n\nParties mentioned: Richard Toulmin of Cranborne Lodge; Lewis Dymock Grosvenor Tregonwell of Aston, Wiltshire\n\n1847 February 27 COMMISSION OF LUNACY ON MAJOR NORTH Morning Post - Saturday 27 February 1847, page 7\n\nCOMMISSION OF LUNACY ON MAJOR NORTH. o Yesterday, a commission de lunatico inquirendo was opened at the Jack Straw's Castle, Hampstead, before Mr. Commissioner Winslow, to inquire into the state of mind of Richard Toulmin North, Esq., aged sixty-five years, o( Thurland Castle, formerly a Major in the Lancashire Mi- litia, but latterly residing at the house of James Martin Crooke, Esq., surgeon, of Herder, a gentleman possessed of landed and personal property of the value of upwards of 3,000/. per annum. The commission was taken out at the instance of North Burton, Esq., the heir at law of the Major. In its support j appeared Mr. Coekburn, Q. C, with Mr. Tennant as coun- sel, and Messrs. Tennant as solicitors ; and Mr. C. Roupell to watch the proceedings on behalf of the alleged lunatic. At the commencement of the inquiry, Major North en- tered, leaning on the arm of Mr. Roupell. His attire was very gentlemanly, and his appearance remarkably healthy. In his hands he bore a large bundle of printed and written papers. Having taken a seat by the side of his professional adviser, he sat very quietly, giving instructions, for some time, until the atldress of Mr. Coekburn, which, in va- rious portions, seemed to excite him, and he repeatedly in- terrupted by various remarks. At the conclusion he'was induced, at the request of the Learned Commissioner, to retire. Mr. Coekburn made a long address to the jury, pointing out_various instances of insanity in Major North, from 1827 to the present time. After having been placed under the surveillance ofa keeper he escaped in 1829 to the continent, where he committed many strange acts, among which were the following:— When at Brunswick he ordered at an hotel a most expensive dinner, and invited the Duke of ? Brunswick to dine with him, the Duke did not attend, I and he said that was solely jealousy. He there made the soldiers completely drunk, and while they were lying about I the room, amused himself by pouring bottles \"of cham- | pagne down their throats and over them, until at length he was ordered out of Brunswick and the gates were ordered to be closed against him, and the sentinels directed never jto allow him to re-enter again. He then went to Wolferbuttle, where he gave a public ball at the hotel, and had people walking up and down iv front of the door of the hotel with paper lanterns, inviting every body to come in, and consequently a few prostitutes and persons of the lowest character came in. He got into a boat without oars, and behaved very strangely. He fancied he had killed a j man who was still alive. He was found by Mr. Burton, a gentleman who had married his niece, living at Wolferbuttle with a discharged stable-boy, who slept in the same room. The boy was of remarkable ap- ! pearance, and the Major called him his brother. When he was brought back to England he was not placed under restraint, and iv 1830 he again escaped to the con- tinent, and nothing was heard of him till 1837 ; but his con- duct was afterwards ascertained to have been very wild and eccentric. In 1837 he paid a visit to Thurland Castle, where he stayed a short time, during which he papered the house- keeper's room with prints, for which he destroyed a valu- able Bible ; and putting them side by side with sporting and other prints, said he did so because \" the saints and sinners should be together.\" In this year the lease of one of his I Irish estates fell in, and unfortunately he got possession of j the deeds and sold the estate, ln that year he drew through his bankers, Messrs. Drummond, the sum of 12,458/. 195., the whole of which he spent in the most wasteful extrava- gance, and gave way to acts of great violence. He broke the windows of the Prince of Wales Hotel, and one morning I rushed out in his dressing-gown, and was found under the Opera Colonnade, with a crowd of boys round him. In 1838 it was found advisable to procure a keeper from Dr. Suther land's to attend on him, and from that period until the pre- sent time he had been under constant medical supervision. The Learned Counsel here at great length proceeded to ele- ; tail the the delu-ions under which he laboured, he fancied i that he saw beautiful figures in the fire, that the table cover j contained living beings, whom he fed with crumbs ; that he was to be married to the Queen, and that his keeper, Usherwood, had opened the head of the Duchess of Kent, , and had taken out her brain. At the present time he is re- -1 siding with Mr. Crooke. j The Learned Counsel read a vast number of letters ad- j dressed to different individuals, all of which tended to show j the diseased state of the unfortunate gentleman's mind, I and concluded a most eloquent address by calling a large I number of witnesses, who fully bore out the whole of his j statement. Major North, who, by direction of the Learned Commi9- -j sioner, had retired during the proceedings, was here again j introduced and examined by the Commissioner as to his knowledge of what was going on ; but, instead of answer- I ing the question, he entered into a violent tirade against j those seeking out the commission. He proceeded in the most voluble manner to state that he had dined with the Dukes of York and Sussex, and that a document in his hand- writing to the following effect — \" In the Queen's name we give to Matthew Bell one million of money, R. T. North,\" was not in his hand-writiug. He did not want the Chancsllor to take care of his money ; but, if at liberty, he should sell all his estates and go where he liked. The Jury, being satisfied, returned a verdict, \" That Richard Toulmin North is of unsound mind and incapable of managing himself or his affairs, and has been so since the 31st day of December, 1837.\"\n\nMore on Maria Woodley Wood nee Biggs\n\nI wrote this in 2007\n\nMaria Woodley Wood v Hotham\n\nA few weeks ago I was plugging in random Wood-related\n\nnames to an online database of The Times.1 And a story\n\npopped out about Maria Woodley Wood (wife of Samuel\n\nTurner Wood, mother of Francis William Wood)\n\nsuccessfully suing her son-in-law, Richard Henry\n\nHotham, in 18642.\n\nHotham married Francis William's sister, Maria Helen\n\nWood, in 1857. And he seems to have been a bit of a\n\nbastard. He was convinced Maria Helen had been\n\nunfaithful. He was jealous, paranoid and violent.\n\nAnd he was also a surgeon—a man who presumably knew\n\na thing or two about cutting up bodies.\n\nMaria Helen fled, taking her two children back to mother.\n\nMaria Woodley Wood sued Hotham 62 pounds and ten\n\nshillings (equivalent of £4,262.94 in 20063). That was the\n\ncost of her looking after Maria Helen and the two children\n\nfor one and a quarter years at one pound a week (about\n\n£68.21 in 2006 terms).\n\nAnd this is a summary of a document I bought on eBay:\n\nGenuine and original Victorian legal document dated 27th\n\nApril 1865. Signed by Sir Henry Singer Keating, one of the\n\njustices of the court of common pleas at Westminster.\n\nDocument refers to Maria Helen Hotham the wife of Richard\n\nHenry Hotham.
