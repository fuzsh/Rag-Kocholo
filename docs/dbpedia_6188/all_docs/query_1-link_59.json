        "text": "ARMS: Or three Ash Leaves couped two and one each of five leaflets proper on a Chief wavy Vert a Lion passant guardant Or dimidiating the Hull of an Ancient Ship argent.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath Argent and Gules a demi Horse Argent holding in the mouth a Hop Cone slipped and leaved and resting the sinister forehoof on a Locomotive Driving Wheel proper.\n\nMotto 'WITH STRONGER FAITH'.\n\nGranted 20th October 1975.\n\nThe Borough of Ashford was formed by the amalgamation of the Borough of Tenterden, the Ashford Urban District, the East Ashford Rural District, the Tenterden Rural District and the West Ashford Rural District.\n\nThe gold background suggests the richness and fertility of the \"Garden of England\", and the three sprigs of ash represent the three former Ashford areas. Each sprig has five leaves to indicate the five former authorities comprising the present Borough, and the wavy line suggesting the rivers Stour, Rother and Beult. The lion joined to the hulk of a medieval ship is from the ancient arms of the Cinque Ports, and is taken from the sail of the ship in the arms of the Borough of Tenterden. It indicates the historical importance of Tenterden as a member of the Confederation, and its green background suggests the Tenterden Rural District surrounding the former Borough.\n\nThe white and red of the wreath, are the colours of the Kent County Council arms, and of the device of the Ashford UDC, red also being the background of the Tenterden arms. The white horse is that of Kent, and was seen in the device of the Ashford UDC and the medallion of the East Ashford RDC. The leaved hop-cone symbolizes agriculture and the driving wheel recalls the locomotive \"lnvicta\", which was a feature of the Ashford UDC device and indicated the importance of the town as a railway centre.\n\nThe motto is a phase adapted from a poem by Richard Lovelace, the famous 17th century poet and a member of the Lovelace family of Bethersden in the former West Ashford Rural District. It appropriately expresses the aspirations and determination of the Borough Council.\n\nThe cross signifies the importance of Crawley's position at the junction of the London to Brighton and Horsham to East Grinstead roads. The nine martlets are from the traditional arms of the South Saxons, and feature in many civic arms in Sussex. Their gold colour on the blue background gives the Sussex colours, and their number suggests the nine communities which made up the original Crawley New Town. The acorns commemorate the oak forests which once covered so much of North Sussex, and also symbolise strong steady growth.\n\nThe wreath and mantling are blue and white, the main colours of the arms. The palisaded crown relates to the circlet of palisades in the Crawley Development Corporation's crest and is an emblem of a planned area. The royal lion, brandishing a hammer, symbolises Manor Royal industrial estate.\n\nThe Borough of Crawley includes the important international airport at Gatwick, so the supporters are an eagle with its wings raised, and, because Gatwick is a British airport, a winged lion. The silver fretty - the criss-crossed area within the wings - represents Crawley industry, with the silver colour suggesting the steel and aluminium it uses. The two red thunderbolts, held by the lion and the eagle, represent the town's flourishing electrical industry.\n\nThe motto is a translation of a phrase from Seneca's Epistulae and refers to the establishment of a happy, expanding community.\n\n*ARMS: Gules on a Chevron Or between three Bezants each charged with a Millrind Sable a Jester's Head proper habited in a Fool's Cap couped between two Sacks Gules.\n\n*CREST: On a Wreath of the Colours upon Water barry wavy Argent and Azure an Ancient Galley in full sail seven oars in action proper between two Bolts of Lightning in chevron Or.\n\n*SUPPORTERS: on the dexter a Lion resting its interior hind leg on an Anvil and supporting a Prioress's Staff Or pendent therefrom a Veil Argent charged on the shoulder with a Roundel per pale Gules and Sable thereon a Maltese Cross Argent and on the sinister a Horse Argent resting its interior hind leg on a Garb Or and supporting a Long Hammer head upwards proper and also charged on the shoulder with a Roundel per pale Gules and Sable thereon a Maltese Cross Argent.\n\nThe Borough of Dartford was formed by the amalgamation of the former Borough of Dartford, the Swanscombe Urban District and the parishes of Darenth, Southfleet, Stone, Sutton-at-Hone and Wilmington from the Dartford Rural District.\n\nThe chevron represents the bridge over the River Darent, from which the town of Dartford and the Parish of Darenth took their names. The three golden discs represent the three constituent councils, while their tabloid form, as those in the arms of the former Borough of Dartford, represents the pharmaceutical industries of the area. The millrinds, like those in the arms of the Dartford RDC, portray the milling of flour and agricultural engineering. The jester's head in a fool's cap, also from the former Borough's arms, symbolises the paper industry, founded in Dartford during the reign of Elizabeth I, and the two sacks represent the cement manufactured at Swanscombe.\n\nThe ancient galley, from the arms of the Rural District, is a reminder of the past Roman civilisation of the district with its many villas and burial grounds and the present shipping industry, it is shown here with seven oars representing the seven communities (Dartford and the six parishes) which form the Borough. It also recalls one of those seen from Galley Hill sailing up the Thames, past the creek which led to Southfleet, whose church is dedicated to St. Nicholas, patron of mariners. The lightning over the galley stands for the electricity produced at Littlebrook Power Station on the banks of the Thames at Stone, whose parish church was known as the \"Lantern of Kent\" from its beacon light known to all sailors on the river.\n\nThe Lion of England is a reminder of Dartford's royal history. King Henry III's sister was married to the Holy Roman Emperor by proxy in Gundulf's Church on the Darent, and Anne of Cleves lived in the Tudor Manor House, which was later used by Elizabeth I as a royal residence. The staff sybolises the priory founded by Edward III, it also brings to mind the Hermits of the Ford, the Martyrs of the Brent and other holy men and women who kept the faith alive in this part of Kent, while the anvil represents the engineering industries, that occupy the lands of the old priory. The white horse of Kent is from the arms of the County Council, and the long hammer is the symbol of Wat Tyler, by tradition a citizen of Dartford, who led the Kentish peasants in a revolt against unjust taxes, while the wheatsheaf represents agriculture. The Maltese crosses represent the Knights of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, whose commandery was at Sutton-at-Hone.\n\nThe motto is adapted from the school song \"Floreat Dartfordia\" written by S.J. Steane, a Dartford citizen and former master for Dartford Grammar School, which was founded in the reign of Elizabeth I.\n\nARMS: Per pale Gules and Azure on a Fess wavy counterchanged between two demi-Lions passant guardant each conjoined to the Hulk of a Ship a like Hulk conjoined to a demi-Lion counter passant all Gold.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath Or and Gules a demi Horse Argent supporting a Tower Gold.\n\nSUPPORTERS: On either side a Sea Horse Argent gorged with a Naval Crown Or and grasping in the fin of the interior foot a Sword bendwise Argent pommel hilt and quillons Gold.\n\nBADGE: Within an Annulet embattled on the outer edge a demi Lion passant guardant conjoined to the Hulk of a Ship Gold.\n\nGranted 19th October 1987.\n\nThe Dover District was formed by the amalgamation of the Borough of Deal, the Borough of Dover, the Borough of Sandwich, the Dover Rural District and the Eastry Rural District, except for five parishes now in the Thanet District.\n\nPicture used with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nARMS: Azure on a Pile reversed throughout Or between two Sprigs of Oak Argent over Water in base barry wavy of four Azure and Argent a Bridge of two arches issuant therefrom an Elm Tree proper.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath of the Colours within a Saxon Crown Or a Grassy Mount proper thereon a Griffin passant Argent supporting a Staff proper flying therefrom a forked Pennon Azure charged in the hoist with a Mullet of nine points Or.\n\nSUPPORTERS: On either side an Eagle Argent wings elevated and addorsed Gules perched on a Sprig of Elm with two leaves proper and holding in the beak a Rose Gules charged with another Argent barbed seeded and stalked with two leaves proper.\n\nBADGE: On an Oval Or over Water in base barry wavy of four Azure and Argent a Bridge of two arches issuant therefrom an Elm Tree proper.\n\nMotto 'DUM DEFLUANT AMNES' - Till the rivers cease to flow.\n\nGranted 10th August 1976.\n\nThe Borough of Elmbridge was formed by the amalgamation of the Esher Urban District and the Walton and Weybridge Urban District.\n\nPicture used with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nThe division of the shield is suggested by the chevron in the arms of the Esher UDC, this was derived from the arms of the d'Abernons, the colours blue and gold are from the arms of the Warennes, Earls of Surrey, the Surrey County Council and the arms of both constituent authorities. The two sprigs of oak like those in the County's arms signify two Surrey authorities. The elm on a bridge is an obvious reference to the name of the Borough, derived from the ancient Hundred of Elmbridge, which was largely coterminious with the present Borough. The bridge has two arches for the union of two authorities and the waves refer to the rivers Thames, Mole, Wey and Ember.\n\nThe gold Saxon crown from the crest of the Walton and Weybridge UDC, refers to the Saxon Hundred of Elmbridge, whose Moot was held at the bridge over the River Mole. The mound represents Esher Common, on which stands the white griffin from the Esher arms, derived from the arms of the Evelyns of Wotton, Cardinal Wolsey and the Reeds of Oatlands. The nine pointed star on the pennon symbolizes the union of nine civil parishes in the Borough.\n\nThe supporters combine the white eagle from the arms of Esher with the red eagle from the arms of Walton and Weybridge. In the former, it was derived from the arms of Merton Priory, landowners in Molesey for four centuries, and in the later it refered to the area's Roman associations. The sprigs of elm with two leaves are a further reference to the two former authorities and the Tudor roses are from the arms of Walton and Weybridge.\n\nThe motto is a variation of that previously used by Walton and Weybridge UDC.\n\nARMS: Per pale Gules and Azure an Ancient Ship with fighting top and mast ensigned by a Cross Patee Or the sail furled Argent in chief a demi Lion passant guardant dimidiated with the hulk of a Ship Or and on two Flaunches of the last six Roses Gules each charged with a Rose Argent barbed and seeded proper.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath Or Gules and Azure a Mount Vert thereon in front of a Pastoral Staff Or a demi double headed Eagle displayed Sable beaked Gold and charged on the breast with a Heart proper, Mantled Gules and Azure doubled Or.\n\nMotto 'AMOENITAS ET SALUBRITAS' - Delightfulness and Healthiness.\n\nGranted 30th April 1974.\n\nThe Folkestone and Hythe District was formed by the amalgamation of the Borough of Folkestone, the Borough of Hythe, the Borough of Lydd, the Borough of New Romney, the Elham Rural District and the Romney Marsh Rural District.\n\nThe District was previously know as Shepway and changed its name to Folkestone and Hythe on 1st April 2018\n\nPicture courtesy of Laurence Jones.\n\nThe lion joined to the hulk of a medieval ship is the long established device from the arms of the Cinque Ports and reflects the District's historic association with that Confederation. The ancient ship is a further reference to the region's maritime nature, and is based on the kind of vessels shown on the seals of the former ancient boroughs of Hythe, Lydd and New Romney and the ancient Town of Folkestone, and thus generally represents them and their history. The six double roses, stand for the six constituent parts which composed the District, roses being particularly suitable, as they suggest the Garden of England as Kent is known.\n\nThe grassy mount symbolizes farming, and can also be regarded as referring to the former Elham Rural District. The black double headed eagle is from the crest of the Borough of Folkstone, derived from the attributed arms of Julius Caesar, who according to legend landed near Folkestone. The crosier represents St. Eanswyth, one of supporters of the Folkstone arms and the heart on its breast refers to Dr. William Harvey, discoverer of the circulatory system, who was born in Folkstone and whose figure was also a supporter of the town's arms.\n\nThe motto, a variation of Folkestone's, refers to delightfulness (of scenery) and healthiness (of locality).\n\nARMS: Sable on a Mount Vert between two Woolpacks a Castle with three Towers Argent the central one triple-towered and charged with a Shield of the Royal Arms of France and England quarterly the outer towers each surmounted by a Spire under the battlements two Roses in fesse and within the open port beneath a Portcullis a Key all Or on the Mount before the port a Lion couchant guardant also Or the Base barry wavy Argent and Azure all within a Bordure Or charged with three Cornish choughs proper.\n\nCREST: Out of a Coronet composed of four Ears of Wheat and as many Acorns slipped and leaved set alternately upon a Rim Or, a demi-Lion Argent about the neck a Rope proper entwined there with a Key fessewise Sable and between the forepaws a Flaxbreaker Gold.\n\nMotto 'FORTITER ET FIDELITER' - Bravely and faithfully.\n\nGranted 8th January 1975.\n\nThe Borough of Guildford was formed by the amalgamation of the former Borough of Guildford and the Guildford Rural District.\n\nPicture used with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nThe arms are based upon those of the former Horsham UDC, which date from at least 1844, where they are attributed to the town in Burke's General Armory, and were formally granted in 1944. The lion derives from the arms of the families of De Braose and Mowbray, Lords of the Manor during the Middle Ages. As in the Horsham shield it is displayed on a blue background with its right foot resting on a representation of the letter \"H\" for Horsham. The white border was added for difference and to represent the wider new District.\n\nThe gold mural is symbolic of local government and the lion is repeated from the arms, here shown between two lilies, which allude to the dedication of the Parish Church of St Mary's. Both lions are charged on the shoulder with a red cross crosslet fitchy, derived from the arms of the Duke of Norfolk, who presented the reconstructed Town Hall to Horsham in 1888.\n\nThe motto was previously used by the Horsham UDC.\n\nThe golden lion and border of blue and gold checks are taken from the former arms of the Borough of Lewes and reflect the influence of the Fitzalan and de Warenne families respectively. William de Warenne was after the Norman Conquest granted the Rape of Lewes (one of the Anglo-Saxon divisions of the ancient Kingdom of Sussex into six administrative areas). His family held the Barony of Lewes until 1347 when, the last male member of the de Warenne family died leaving, as his heiress, a sister who had married a Fitzalan, and whose son. Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, became Lord of the Barony of Lewes, Before the Barony of Lewes came to them, the coat of arms of the Fitzalan family consisted of a gold lion on a red background, but it appears that thereafter they were drawn to show the de Warenne gold and blue chequers on the left hand side of the shield and the gold lion on a red background on the right hand side. The lion's hindquarters have been replaced with a sea lion's tail to symbolise the coastal and maritime interest of the District.\n\nThe black eagle is taken from the arms originally borne by the d'Aquila family, Lords of the Manor of Seaford. The eagle appeared on the 13th century seal of the ancient Borough of Seaford and formed part of the arms of the Seaford UDC. The eagle wears a golden collar from which is suspended a golden anchor - the principal emblem of the badge of the Newhaven Town Council and former Urban District Council. The Saxon Crown is derived from the arms of the East Sussex County Council and this recognises not only that Lewes District is within the administrative county of East Sussex, but that the County Town of Lewes is the centre of justice and the seat of local administration.\n\nThe background division into four emphasises the coming together of the four former local authorities, the roundels which have been counterchanged, red and gold, give artistic effect. The colours of the four divisions an echo of the Crest. The Pale and the division across the shield are made up of varied lines in order that they may be taken as an allusion to the task of binding the area together and combining in close union and association the various groups and interests which have been brought together to form the new Mid Sussex District. The round-headed rampion, commonly called \"the Pride of Sussex\" has been used as the main charge on the shield. This has been placed on a Pale, which having been placed in the middle of the shield give the notion of \"mid\" and so of Mid Sussex District Council. The other areas on either side of the Pale also emphasise this idea of being \"mid\".\n\nThe golden Roman Eagle is a reference to the deep penetration of the area by the Romans. About the neck of the bird is suspended a black Mill Iron as a reference to the historic iron industry of the area, while the wings have been charged with red eight pointed Crosses in reference to the Knights Templar who, historically, once held great Estates in the area. The Eagle stands upon green turf in allusion to the area.\n\nThe blue and white wave represents the River Mole, with the two Dorking areas on one side and the Leatherhead area on the other. The acorns are from the arms of the three former auithorities and the Surrey County Council. Above the acorns are two stylised hills, representing Box Hill and Leith Hill, two notable geographical features of the district, with a blue sky above. The outline of the hills also suggests the letter M with a V in the middle.\n\nThe crest's basic colours of gold and blue, the traditional Surrey livery, are taken from the arms of the Warrennes, first Earls of Surrey. The mural crown, is a familiar symbol of local government, coloured white as in the crest of the Dorking UDC and a direct reference to the prevalence of Dorking Lime in many local buildings. The swan was prominent in the crest of the Leatherhead UDC, in which it alluded to the old Swan Inn of coaching days and to the river and other local waters. The swan holds in its beak a red sword pointing upwards, refering to the association with the City of London through the City Freeman's School and to the connection between the former arms and the Second World War, the Leatherhead arms being the first in heraldry to commemorate the unity of purpose of the Civil Defence Services. Flanking the swan are two branches of oak leaves linking with the oak in the shield and are a direct reference to the former Leatherhead crest and the County arms.\n\nThe two cocks are of the distinctive five-toed Dorking breed, and are taken from the Dorking UDC crest, they characterise the surrounding rural area. Each cock holds in its beak a pine cone from the crest of the Dorking and Horley RDC, they refer to the Weald and Leith Hill wooded area of the district.\n\nTho motto,'Ministrando Vigilans' ('Vigilant in our serving') which gives the initials MV is a derivation of those of the former Dorking and Leatherhead Councils.\n\nARMS: Checky Azure and Or on a Mount in base and in front of an Oak Tree a Port with Portcullis raised between two Towers proper on a Chief Sable a Woolpack Or between two Sprigs of Oak fructed Argent.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath of the Colours a demi figure representing a Pilgrim grasping his Staff with his dexter hand and habited in traditional Costume with Scrip proper a Cloak Azure.\n\nSUPPORTERS: On the dexter side a Lion and on the sinister side a Horse Argent each gorged with a Wreath Or and Azure and charged on the shoulders with a Fountain that on the dexter charged with a Tanner's Knife and that on the sinister with a Sallow Leaf proper.\n\nBADGE: On a Fountain environed by a Wreath of Oak fructed proper a Woolpack ensigned with an Oak Tree and Port as in the Arms.\n\nMotto 'NEVER WONNE NE NEVER SHALL'.\n\nGranted 30th May 1975.\n\nThe Borough of Reigate and Banstead was formed by the amalgamation of the Borough of Reigate, the Banstead Urban District and part of the Dorking and Horley Rural District.\n\nPicture used with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nAs in the arms of the Borough of Reigate, the background is the blue and gold chequers of the Warrennes, Earls of Surrey, Lords of Reigate and founders of the Priory in medieval times. The old device of the gate and oak tree is from the former seal and arms of Reigate, in the new arms the device is shown in its proper colours instead of white. The black chief, also from the old Reigate arms, is charged with the simple device of the Banstead UDC, the gold woolpack. It refers to the former importance of sheep-rearing and wool-production in Banstaad and also to the historic Wodpack Inn. The two sprigs of oak, as in the Surrey CC arms, refer to the two Surrey parishes of Horley and Salfords & Sidlow.\n\nThe mantling is in the basic Surrey colours of the Warrennes, blue and gold. The half length figure of one of the Pilgrim supporters of the former Reigate BC arms, is an obvious reference to the ancient Pilgrims' Way, which is common to both Reigate and Banstead.\n\nThe white lion and horse, are the supporters of the Howards, late Earls of Surrey. The lion was the crest of the Reigate BC in reference to the Lords Howard of Effingham, later Lords of Reigate. This was derived from the white lion of the de Mowbrays, who were prominent in Banstead and held the manor in the 12th century, so the lion is appropriate to both places. The horse is also a reference to the tradition of horse-racing on Banstead Downs, starting in the 17th century and immortalised in the famous Oaks race. The heraldic fountains on the shoulders indicate the River Mole at both Horley and Sidlow bridge. The tanner's knife, the ancient emblem of St. Bartholomew, patron of the parish of Horley, alludes to one of its ancient crafts, the leather industry. It is possible that the choice of this saint for the dedication of the church was due to the importance of this craft in ancient times. The sallow-leaf, refers to the name Salfords, the derivation of which is usually \"sallow ford\".\n\nThe motto is that used by the former Reigate BC.\n\nThe arms like those of the Egham UDC refer to the earlier history of the district, with the representation of the Magna Carta, and the Crown of King John. It will be recalled that the \"signing\" (or more accurately sealing) of the Great Charter of Freedom by King John took place in the year 1215 and it concludes with these words \"Given by Our hand in the meadow which is called Runnymede between Windsor and Staines, in the Fifteenth Day of June in the Seventeenth year of Our Reign\". The blue waves refer to the River Thames\n\nThe crest recalls, like that of the Chertsey UDC, the Benedictine Abbey of St. Peter at Chertsey. Its founding in 666 started the recorded history of the entire area, for its lands and influence extended over the whole of this part of Surrey. The Abbey was founded by Erkenwald, who later became Bishop of London. The swan from the crest of the Egham UDC, is a further reference to the River Thames.\n\nThe motto is a combination of those of Egham and Chertsey.\n\nARMS: Per fess Azure and barry wavy of six Azure and Argent in chief in front of a rising Sun Or a representation of Staines Bridge issuant and in base a Thorn Tree proper.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath of the Colours between two Sprigs of Oak each fructed of as many Acorns two Seaxes in saltire points downward proper hilts and pomels Or perched thereon a Swan rousant proper.\n\nMotto 'AD SOLEM PROSPICIMUS' - We look towards the Sun.\n\nGranted 25th July 1974.\n\nThe Borough of Spelthorne was formed by the amalgamation of the Staines Urban District and the Sunbury Urban District. These two authorities were in formerly in Middlesex and were transferred to Surrey in 1965, upon the abolision of the Middlesex County Council.\n\nPicture used with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nThe white and blue waves, which are common to the arms of both former authorities, represents the River Thames. Against them stands a thorn tree recalling the famous tree which gave its name to the ancient Hundred of Spelthorne in Middlesex. Spanning the waves is Staines Bridge from the arms of the Staines UDC, and behind it is the allusive sun from the crest of the Sunbury UDC. The sun also suggests the dawn of a new life for Spelthorne.\n\nThe swan again recalls the River Thames, an important factor in the life of the Borough. The seaxes (Saxon swords) where common to the arms of both former authorities and the Middlesex County Council. The two sprigs of oak, from the arms of the Surrey County Council, symbolise the new Borough in Surrey.\n\nThe motto is a combination of those of Staines and Sunbury, and implies the facing of the dawn of a new civic era.\n\nARMS: Per pale Azure and Sable a Chief per pale Or and Argent over all a Stag's Head caboshed the attires interlaced with two Swords in saltire proper points upward hilts and pomels Or in chief a Sword in bend proper hilt and pomel Gules enfiling two Keys in bend sinister addorsed the bows interlaced the upper Gules the lower Azure.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath Or and Azure on a Mount of Heath proper environed of eight Fir Cones erect a Lion passant guardant Or crowned Gules and holding in the dexter paw a Grenade Sable fired proper.\n\nSUPPORTERS: On the dexter side an Owl Argent membered Or claws Gules gorged with a Wreath Argent and Azure and on the sinister side a Falcon proper belled Or and gorged with a Wreath Or and Gules each resting the exterior claw on a Sprig of Oak fructed of two Acorns proper.\n\nBADGE: Upon an Oval Argent environed by a Torse Or and Azure a Mount of Heath issuant in base thereon a Scots Pine all proper.\n\nMotto 'FESTINA DILIGENTER' - Make hast carefully.\n\nGranted 20th September 1974.\n\nThe Borough of Surrey Heath was formed by the amalgamation of the Frimley and Camberley Urban District and the Bagshot Rural District.\n\nPicture used with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nThe vertical division of the background into blue and black is like the arms of the Surrey County Council. A chief was common the the arms of both former authorities, divided into gold and white like the shield of Chertsey Abbey which, being connected with the history of the whole area, was commemorated in the arms of both former councils; the Bagshot RDC had the gold and white backgrouind, while the Frimley and Camberley UDC had the keys and sword of St Peter and St Paul, shown here on the on the gold and white chief. The crossed swords, interlaced with the antlers of a stag's head, are derived from the principal emblems in the previous councils' arms, the crossed swords of the Army badge indicating the importance of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and the Staff College at Camberley and the former military camp at Chobham. The stag's head alludes to Bagshot Park, a royal demesne since Norman times, and to the fact that much of the district was formerly part of Windsor Forest. The interlacing of the swords with the antlers symbolises the union of the two districts.\n\nThe wreath and mantling are in the principal colour and metal of the arms, blue and gold, the ancient liveries of the Warenne Earls of Surrey and of the County Council. The circle of fir cones from the crest of Bagshot RDC encloses a mound of heathland in reference to Bagshot Heath. The the royal lion from the Bagshot arms, is crowned with a red crown like the Stanhope lion in the crest of the Frimley and Camberly UDC, the latter holds a grenade or fire-ball, and this is shown in the royal lion's forepaw.\n\nThe white owl is derived from one the three in the Frimley and Camberley shield, alluding to the le Marchant baronets of Chobham, one of whom was first Lieutenant-Governor of the Royal Military College. As in the former shield, the owl stands on a sprig of oak, the Surrey badge. The falcon is derived from the crest of Bagshot, here it reverts to its original function as a supporter, being that of the Earls of Onslow. Each is wreathed about the neck with livery colours of the arms of the two former councils, white and blue for Frimley and Camberley, gold and red for Bagshot.\n\nThe motto is derived from those of Onslow and Bagshot, and its import here is the ideal of progress with speed and efficiency.\n\nARMS: Or upon a Fess wavy Azure between in chief a Lion passant guardant Gules dimidiating the Hull of an Ancient ship Azure and in base five Cherries with stalks leaves and twig conjoined all proper a Bar wavy Argent.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath of the Colours a Ram Azure armed Or and a Horse Argent combatant supporting a Mural Crown Or.\n\nSUPPORTERS: On the dexter a Sea-Lion proper the head and mane Or supporting an Abbatial Crozier and Veil all proper and on the sinister a like Lion supporting a Pilgrim's Staff and Wallet all proper.\n\nBADGE: Four Sea-Swallows volant in saltire wings conjoined beaks to the centre Azure.\n\nMotto 'KNOWN BY THEIR FRUITS'.\n\nGranted 22nd February 1977.\n\nThe Borough of Swale was formed by the amalgamation of the Borough of Faversham, the Borough of Queenborough-in-Sheppey, the Sittingbourne and Milton Urban District and the Swale Rural District.\n\nUsed with permission, do not reproduce.\n\nThe gold background represents the area's historical, agricultural and industrial wealth, and the central blue and white wave, symbolises the docks, port and River Swale. The lion joined to the hulk of a medieval ship is from the arms of the Cinque Ports of which Faversham is a limb. The cherries, like the tree in the crest of the Sittingbourne and Milton UDC, represent the very first ones grown in England, here in Teynham during the reign of Henry VIII.\n\nThe Ram represents the Isle of Sheep, or Sheppey as it is now called. The Horse is the Invicta symbolising the County of Kent and the mural crown they hold indicates local government.\n\nThe two lions are the Royal beasts of England, here given fish tails because of the area's marine importance. The one on the left is holding a staff and veil which refers to the old Monastries at Minster and Faversham. The one on the right is carrying a pilgrims staff and purse because of the fact that the area is part of the Pilgrims Way from London to Canterbury.\n\nThe motto is that previously used by the Sittingbourne and Milton UDC.\n\nThe red background with three bezants or roundels of gold, is taken from the seal of the Augustinian Priory of St. James atTandridge which flourished from about 1200 until 1537. The red estoiles are derived from the arms of the Cobham family of Lingfield.\n\nThe mural crown is symbolic of municipal government as well as of military defence. The grasshopper is from the crest of the Gresham family, which at one time owned a number of manors within the district.\n\nThe gold griffins are taken from the arms of the Evelyn family who were connected with Godstone and Felbridge at various times during the 16th to 18th centuries. Each griffin holds a blue winged sword which is an allusion to Kenley Aerodrome established in 1917 and an important fighter station during World War II.\n\nThe embattled red chief and the wavy blue pale suggests a letter T and depict the River Medway flowing under the great bridge at Tonbridge and downstream into the Malling area, which is represented by the two inverted black piles, suggesting a letter M. The chief can be taken as an allusion to a bridge or castle, both of which appeared in the arms and crest of the Tonbridge UDC.\n\nThe Invicta or Kentish horse, from the arms of the County Council, shows that the Borough is in that county, and the wreath of hops refers to one of the local industries. The tower is symbolic of the ancient abbeys and castles: - Tonbridge Castle, Malling Abbey, Leybourne Castle and Aylesford Friary, which make an important historic contribution to the amenities of the Borough.\n\nThe motto expresses the desire of this Council for the Borough to go forward as an entity and to plan for the future needs of the Borough as a whole.\n\nThe green and gold of the background represents the country and town areas respectively. The inverted triangle shape, like that in the arms of the former Borough, but now coloured green denotes the geological fault which gives rise to numerous local springs, including the Chalybeate Spring, symbolised by the blue and white circle, around which Tunbridge Wells developed. The Saxon crown shows the town's 'Royal' prefix. The hop bine and apple blossom symbolise the rural areas.\n\nThe ram's head derives from the crest of the Southborough UDC and the well-head, as in the former crest, again represents the Tunbridge Wells Chalybeate Spring.\n\nThe gold and red of the wreath and mantling are the same as those of the former Borough. The crane represents Cranbrook and the horse, from the arms of the County Council, the location of the Borough in Kent. The compartment indicates the local outcrops of sandstone.\n\nThe arms are made up of elements derived from the heraldry of past holders of the Manor of Woking. The cross is from the arms attributed to Edward the Confessor and the red and gold colouring is from the arms of Bassett family, to whom the manor was granted by King John, shortly after his accession. On the death of Aliva Bassett in 1281, the Manor passed to her son Hugh le Despenser, and it is from the Despenser family arms that the frets are taken. The fleurs-de-lis are from the arms of the Beaufort Dukes of Somerset, who came into possesion of the Manor in 1416. Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, lived at Woking Palace and her grandson, Henry VIII, also live there from time to time.\n\nThe green background refers to the first syllable of 'Grinstead' and therefore the derivation of the name meaning 'Green Place'. The white line represents the meridan of Greenwich running through the town and the rising sun 'East'. The hammer is to recall the local iron industry, the sword the Assizes (lost to the town in 1799) and the ash tree Ashdown Forest, with a crown because it was royal property.\n\nIn 1572 Thomas Cure, Member of Parliament for the former Borough, presented a seal: five blue ostrich feathers with gold tips, his initials and those of the Duchy of Lancaster, of which the town was part. The Borough was disenfranchised in 1832 and the device used by the Urban District Council before the arms the current arms were granted. The feathers are here repeated, with three red roses of the house of Lancaster. In the past the red rose of Lancaster surmounted by a ducal coronet has also been attributed to the town.\n\nA thirteenth-century seal of the Barons of Faversham, from a very early date a limb of the Cinque Ports, bears the three lions of England on a shield. Round the arms on the seal is the Latin inscription \"Regis ut arma rego libera portus ego\" - in English, \"Since I [Faversham} bear arms for the King without charge, I am a free port\". This suggests that in return for the town's services to the King, he granted it the privilege of using his Royal arms, without variation, as its own. In 1933 it was noted that no grant of arms to the then Borough of Faversham had survived in the official records. However a 1619 source was cited, that suggested that the three lions' hind-quarters should be in silver, not gold. In 1988 the Borough's successor, the Town Council, sought resolution of the conflict between this version and the earlier one with the College of Arms. The outcome was that in 1990 the College confirmed the current version, but the actual effect is that Faversham is using the arms of the great Irish family of O'Brien. The reverse of the seal bears a ship with a banner on which are the three chevrons of Clare.\n\nARMS: Or on Water barry wavy in base proper an ancient Ship with four Men's Heads therein apparent as represented on the ancient Seal of the Borough of Folkestone also proper on a Chief per pale Gules and Azure a demi Lion passant guardant dimidiated with the Hull of a Ship Gold.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath Or and Azure a demi double-headed Eagle displayed Sable beaked Or charged on the breast with a Rose Argent barbed and seeded proper dimidiated with a Fleur-de-Lys Gold and on each wing with a Ducal Coronet also Gold.\n\nSUPPORTERS: On the dexter side a figure representing St. Eanswyth proper crowned with an ancient Crown and holding in the exterior hand a Pastoral Staff Or and on the sinister side a figure representing William Harvey the physician also proper holding in the exterior hand a Heart Gules.\n\nMotto 'SALUBRITAS ET AMOENITAS' - Heathiness and Delightfulness.\n\nGranted 25th July 1958, to the Folkestone Borough Council. Transferred by Royal Licence and exemplified by certificate dated 30th November 2007.\n\nARMS: Per pale Gules and Sable a Woolpack Argent on a Chief of the last a Rose of the first barbed and seed proper between two Escocheons also Gules that on the dexter charged with a Fesse dancetty between two Crosses patty in pale of the third and that on the sinister charged with three Pears in bend leafed and slipped proper.\n\nCREST: On a Wreath of the Colours a Mount thereon a Ram statant holding in the mouth a Pear leafed and slipped all proper suspended from the neck by a Ribbon Gules an Escocheon Or charged with a Pair of Shears erect points upwards also proper.\n\nMotto 'LIBERA DEINDE FIDELIS' - Faithful because free.\n\nGranted 8th June 1893, to the Goldalming Borough Council. Transferred by Order in Council 16th April 1975 and exemplified by the Kings of Arms 10th December 1975.\n\nThe woolpack, taken from an earlier seal, indicates the subsistance of the Town upon the woollen industry for several centuries. The rose indicates that the first Borough Charter was granted in Tudor times, in 1575 during the reign of Elizabeth I. The three pears, are a punning rubus in reference to the Borough's first Warden John Perrier, a clothier. The other shield is said to refer to Sir George More of Loseley, who held the Manor of Godalming from 1601 after it passed from royal hands. However the shield bears no resemblance to the arms of More, and it seems likely that this shield was originally intended to represent Jocelyn de Bohun, Bishop of Salisbury in 1157, when the holding of Rectory Manor by the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury was confirmed. Unfortunately, this Bishop Jocelyn has been confused with another man with a similar name, Jocelyn de Bailleul, whose arms may be regarded as having some resemblance to the device used in the Godalming arms.\n\nThe crest is a further reference to the woollen industry and John Perrier\n\nThe shield forms a kind of heraldic map, with Haslemere between Hindhead and Blackdown. The chevron indicates the hilly situation of the area and resembles a gable and thus denotes a residential area, it also recalls the chevron-like pattern characteristic of Haslemere pottery. The two hazel leaves and the heraldic fountain suggests the name Haslemere, while above the hinds' heads on purple, suggest the heathery lands of the Hindhead area. Below the black \"hill\" suggests Blackdown, with the sprig of oak from the arms of the Surrey County Council, it is also the National Trust's emblem, a reminder that the Trust owns much local land.\n\nThe gold and purple of the wreath suggest the local abundance of heather and gorse and are also indicative of local Royal patronage. The mural crown is a symbol of local government and refers here to Haslemere's former borough status. The white antelope derived from the crest of the Mores of Loseley who held the Manor of Godalming (which included Haslemere) after the Bishops of Salisbury, who are also represented on the crest by a blue collar. The beacon is a reference to Beacon Hill and a symbol of the iron industry that was once so active in this area.\n\nThe motto reflects the many cultural activities of the town and its many links with famous artists, authors, poets and musicians.\n\nThe arms are based on that of the Bysshopp family of Henfield, among whom were a number of Postmasters General of the United Kingdom, Henry Bysshopp (the first Postmaster General - 1606-1692) introduced the first postmark in 1661. The keys of St Peter refer to the dedication of the Church or England parish church. The pelican is part of the emblems of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and Cambridge and refers to the dedication of the Catholic church in Henfield to Corpus Christi.\n\nThe golden oriole refers to William Borrer 1781 - 1862, a famous botanist who collected over 6,600 specimens, and who recorded sighting fourteen golden orioles on a hawthorn bush in Henfield.\n\nThe motto from Matthew 8:25, is at the request of the Reverend Mark Elvins, priest of Corpus Christi Church in Henfield whose idea it first was - and who very kindly and generously paid for the application process to the College of Arms. It was a favourite motto of his.\n\nARMS: Quarterly Gules and Azure a Cross parted and fretty Agent between a Horse rampant of the last in the first quater a demi Lion passant guardant of the third conjoined to the Hulk of a Ship Or in the second a Dolphin naiant proper in the third and a Lymphad also Or in the fourth.\n\nCREST: Issuant from a Naval Crown Or a Pierhead thereon a Lighthouse both proper.\n\nSUPPORTERS: On the dexter a Lifeboatman and on the sinister side a Coastguard holding in the exterior hand a Telescope all proper.\n\nMotto 'SALUS NAUFRAGIS SALUS AEGRIS' - Safety to the shipwrecked, health to the sick.\n\nArms and crest granted 23rd July 1884, and supporters granted 2nd November 1935, to the Ramsgate Borough Council. Unsure if these have been officially transferred to the Town Council.\n\nThe seven golden acorns refer to the name sevenoaks and were previously used on the unofficial arms used by the Council. Its design was very similar to the arms believed to have been borne by William Sevenoke, the founder of Sevenoaks School, in the 15th century and still used by that school as \"Founder's Arms\". The blue Y-shaped pall is suggested by the arms of the Archbishops of Canterbury, who held the Manor of Sevenoaks as part of that of Otford. It also represents the the road junction, which was a major factor in the development of the town. The colours of gold and red are also the main colours of the arms of the Sackville family, who owned Knole House in Sevenoaks for many centuries.\n\nThe silver circlet with red lozenges are taken from the arms of Bosville, a notable local family. The white horse is from the arms attributed to the ancient Kingdom of Kent and now borne by the Kent County Council. The lance is similar to those in the crest of the Amherst family and the vine is a reference to the historic Vines cricket ground in Sevenoaks and is also said to suggest another local family, Lambard, who owned Vine Court.\n\nThe badge conbines the seven golden acorns from the arms with a silver estoile, from the crest of the Sackville family. Here the rays are increased to seven to fit with the acorns."
