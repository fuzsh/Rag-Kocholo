The back garden is the same as ours now that we have knocked down our air-raid shelter.\n\nWe now have a Wandsworth Council plaque to them and held a great unveiling event on 9th June when over sixty of us gathered on a blistering sunny day including many descendants. We had four great granddaughters of Emily’s – Jenny Slaughter, descended from Norah and Belinda, Susie and Victoria from Una and Victor. Great, great, great grandchildren Sam who is Jenny’s grandson and Elsie unveiled the plaque by tugging on my pashmina which is now an established tradition. Nicole from the Diederichs family came from France to join us which was lovely. Speakers were Jenny, Deputy Mayor Cllr Sana Jafri, Cllr Rex Osborn Wandsworth Heritage Champion, Alesha de Freitas from the Fawcett Society and I was MC giving some background history. We were delighted that the Battersea Power Station Community Choir joined us to sing March of the Women by Ethel Smythe the great anthem of the suffragettes and a rendering of Nana was a Suffragette, The unveiling event included family descendants, the Battersea Power Station Community Choir singing the anthem March of the Women by Ethyl Smythe, a reading of the poem Cat and Mouse by Joolz Sparkes from the anthology London Undercurrents. Hilaire and Joolz read by Hilaire. Kate Cook, owner of the house read a poem Shattered Glass by her daughter Lettice. Some of us wore Votes for Women sashes again. As Emily was elected Councillor in 1919 some of us went on to Battersea Town Hall afterwards.\n\nThe usual address for the family was given as 37 Park Road which was renamed Elsynge Road but this is where they lived from 1884 to 1906. .\n\nErnest and Emily Duval had 9 children but three had died, Walter and Ivy in infancy and their eldest Ernest aged 22 in 1904 leaving six children, four girls and two boys Victor, Barbara, Winifred, Norah, Elsie and Gurney. They, with their children, were keen suffragists. Emily Hayes was resident in Battersea when she and Ernest Diederichs Duval met. I found out more about them after I had posted this blog initially, especially about Ernest.\n\nI had written about their daughter Elsie as more seemed to have been written about her online. I was contacted by Norah’s grandson Adrian. He writes, Elsie has the reputation of a martyr which diverts attention from the contributions of other members of the family. The grounds for that reputation are a bit shaky, I think, because there is reason to believe that she was not strong anyway; the “old mitral stenosis” mentioned on her death certificate suggests rheumatic fever in childhood, an ailment which almost certainly led to the early death of Ernest. Battersea in those times was not a healthy place to raise a family\n\nThe Women’s Suffrage Movement: A reference Guide 1866-1928 By Elizabeth Crawford has entries on Emily, Elsie and Hugh and Victor and Una are in Rise Up Women by Diane Atkinson.\n\nThe Women’s Suffrage Movement: A reference Guide 1866-1928 By Elizabeth Crawford has entries on Emily, Elsie and Hugh and Victor and Una are in Rise Up Women by Diane Atkinson.\n\nThe Duval family through marriage were connected to two other committed women’s suffrage families as Victor married Una Dugdale and Elsie married Hugh Franklin.\n\nEmily Duval 1861-1924 was born in Mayfair. Her father was a coachman. Her grandfather owned a beerhouse The Queens Arms in what was then 1 New Road right by Clapham Junction. The road had thirty houses which got gobbled up by the expansion of the railway and the station and got renamed Prested Road which only has the pub on that corner which was The Windsor Castle but now has been renamed The Junction. Emily was living in 37 Whycliffe Road which is off Lavender Hill when she met Ernest. I will give his backstory later.\n\nEmily had joined the Women’s Social and Political Union in 1906 but left for the Women’s Freedom League and became Chair of the Battersea Branch. There was a great breakaway from the WSPU because of the autocratic ways of Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst who were among the founders of it in Manchester, their home town. The WSPU displayed a more militant strand of the suffrage movement than its predecessor, the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). The Women’s Freedom League was a militant organisation, formed in 1907 by Teresa Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard in that split rom the WSPU, which agitated for women’s voting rights. However while the WSPU was run like an army, the WFL was a democratic organisation and used direct action such as passive resistance to taxation and non-cooperation with the census, rather than attacks on people and property. Emily may have been, at that stage influenced by Charlotte Despard and loyal to her local suffrage activists who also left the WSPU to join the WFL which had Charlotte as it’s President.\n\nBy the spring of 1909 Emily had served two prison sentences for her part in WFL protests. In October 1908 Emily and her seventeen year old daughter Barbara were arrested when Muriel Matters chained herself to the grille in the House of Commons. Emily paid her fine and Barbara was released after promising to refrain from further militancy until she was twenty-one. Mrs Duval was accused in court of being ‘a lady agitator who was bringing up her daughter to be a lady agitator’ In February 1909 she served six weeks in Holloway, almost all in the hospital wing suffering from acute neuritus.\n\nShe rejoined the WSPU in 1911 thus ending her four year membership of the WFL because she thought they were not militant enough and went on to break windows at the Local Government Board and was sent to prison for two weeks and Victor was sentenced to five weeks at Pentonville prison at the same time. Four members of the Duval family went on a deputation to Parliament Emily, Elsie, Barbara and Victor. This was after the tenth ‘Women’s Parliament’ was called to Caxton Hall which was where they left from at the start of each Parliament when the WSPU would march to the House of commons and try to deliver a petition to the Prime Minister. The poster below shows that the demonstration at Battersea Town Hall was chaired by Ernest who was, of course, a member and regular speaker for The Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage. Emily was one of the speakers. This was after the famous event of Muriel Matters in Parliament. She and an associate, Helen Fox, both chained themselves to the grille of the Ladies’ Gallery and Matters began loudly proclaiming the benefits of enfranchisement directly to the elected MPs. (Although not recorded in Hansard, the official minute of the House of Commons, Matters pronouncements were technically the first woman’s speech ever in the British Parliament.\n\nWhen Emily was sentenced to six months, in Winston Green Prison for breaking two windows in Regent Street, she told the magistrate that she had been ‘brutally knocked about and thrown on her back’. She referred to the large numbers of young women who were driven into prostitution by poverty, she addressed the court ‘I should like to say that I shattered the glass because I wish the government to come to their senses, and money can replace broken glass, but it cannot replace the innocence of girls who are outraged daily…. I am prepared to die for Votes for Women ‘ Four months into her sentence Emily went on hunger strike and was force-fed over a two week period.\n\nEmily gave an account of being force-fed in a statement she dictated at Birmingham WSPU office. In the hospital wing the doctor had listened to her heart and begged her to take the feeding cup rather than been fed by the nasal tube, but she told him that she would rather have her head cut off than do such a thing. They covered her with towels and held her head back and the tube was pushed up her nose,’which was most agonising – my nerves seemed to prick all the passages of my nose and some in my throat. I did not know how to breathe, I did not struggle or flinch, just gripped the wardresses’ hand very tight’ When they finished feeding her and she got her breath back, she told them ‘Mr McKenna deserves shooting.’ The next morning the prison doctor urged her to eat but Emily refused and was force-fed once again. ‘ it seemed as though I was being suffocated. I could not breath it was simply horrible’. She was helped back to her cell where her throat bled and she vomited all over the place’.\n\nShe was force-fed several more times and released on 25th June before her sentence was complete and went to a nursing home to convalesce. (From her statement 30th June 1912 which is in a private collection.)\n\nEmily Duval was elected Battersea Councillor in 1919 along with Caroline Ganley who became MP in 1945 and Mrs Jessie Hockley who was secretary of the Battersea Railway Women’s League. Emily died in 1924 aged 64. . It was so sad that three of her daughters did not live to vote. Winifred had died of tuberculosis and Elsie and Barbara died in the awful influenza epidemic.\n\nElsie Diederichs Duval joined the Women’s Social & Political Union in 1907, the year after her mother. Unlike her mother, however, she did not leave the organisation to join the Women’s Freedom League when the Pankhursts changed the constitution, but the mother and daughter did work together for three years in the Men’s Political Union for Women’s Enfranchisement which Victor Diederichs Duval (1885–1945), Elsie’s brother, founded. Norah, Barbara and Winifred were the other three daughters who were also suffragettes.\n\nThere is not much information on Norah but she too was imprisoned. “On 1 March 1912, Mrs Duval was arrested again along with her daughter Norah, this time for smashing windows in Regent Street. Norah, was sentenced to four months imprisonment at the Newington Sessions on 13 March 1912, for window smashing. She told the court, ‘I wish to say that what I did I did entirely on my own responsibility, and not, as the jury would infer, as the dupe of others. I did it because I want the same political tights as my brothers enjoy today. When asked by the judge whether she would be willing to give up breaking the law, Norah Duval replied, ‘No, certainly not. It is the only thing we can do. We cannot get redress in any other way”.\n\nWe also know that Norah stayed with the Rutters in Leeds. Frank Rutter was an art critic and and founder member of the MPU. Their home became a sanctuary for for suffragettes to recuperate from hunger striking. There is an occasion when a baker delivery van drew up outside their home and Norah was disguised as the delivery boy while the driver dressed as a man was Leonora Cohen when Lilian Lenton 1891-1972 walked out of the house as the delivery boy to be driven off. Lilian continued to evade recapture by continuing to dress as a boy or as an old women becoming the Elusive Pimpernel she went on to lead an active life. https://spartacus-educational.com/WlentonL.htm\n\nElsie Duval 1892-1919 was the most active suffragette of Emily’s daughters. There is more information on Elsie available as she fell in love with and married Hugh Franklin who was very active in the Men’s Political Union for Women’s Enfranchisement which he had joined on 22 Feb 1910 which had been founded by her brother.\n\nElsie and Hugh’s archive which is part of the National Archive is kept at the Women’s Library at the LSE . https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/b0d30b35-bf00-4430-b0bf-57b8b77e6b4e\n\nHugh was the fourth of six siblings and had three brothers and two sisters Alice, Hugh, Helen and Ellis, along with their mother, turned from the Liberal Party tradition of the family and took the path set by Caroline’s sister Henrietta who had set up the Jewish League for Women’s Suffrage.\n\nAlice, a staunch socialist, would later become a leader of the Townwomen’s Guild, Helen became forewoman at the Royal Arsenal, where she was forced to resign for supporting female workers and attempting to form a trade union, and Ellis became vice-principal of the Working Men’s College. Through Ellis, Hugh was also the uncle of the famous crystallographer Rosalind Franklin.\n\nHugh Franklin was born in 1889, the son of Arthur Franklin who was the senior partner in a banking firm. His mother, Caroline Franklin, was a member of the National Union of Suffrage Societies Hugh was educated at Clifton College and in 1908 went to Caius College to study engineering. After hearing the Pankhursts at the Queen’s Hall he become committed to the cause of women’s suffrage and joined Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage.\n\nThe paper written by June Marion Balshaw gives an account of political couples and chapter six is about Elsie and Hugh and their families.\n\nCHAPTER SIX. More than just ‘a sporting couple’: the militancy of Elsie Duval and Hugh Franklin https://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/5796/3/June%20Marion%20Balshaw%201998%20-%20redacted.pdf\n\nThis chapter will consider the political partnership of Elsie Duval and Hugh Franklin who were both involved in the suffrage campaigns of the early twentieth century and yet the level and extent of their commitment has not been acknowledged in subsequent histories and accounts of suffrage.’ I will first examine their individual activities and motivation for becoming involved in the suffrage campaign and the ways in which this both created and reinforced their continuing separate identities. I shall also consider the extremities of their actions, the ways inwhich they were represented and how this subsequently affected both their personal and political activities. By taking this approach, a good insight is provided into the changing nature of the relationship between the WSPU and the MPU as militancy escalated as well as enabling a discussion of suffrage and judaism to be included .Finally, I shall explore the impact of suffrage on Hugh Franklin’s political and personal life after Elsie Duval’s premature death. Hugh Franklin and Elsie Duval were born in 1889 and 1892 respectively, making them among the younger supporters of votes for women. They were both arrested several times between 1910 and 1913 and Hugh Franklin was imprisoned on three occasions whilst Elsie Duval experienced Holloway prison twice.\n\nTheir militant activities were extreme and included alleged arson attacks on a house, a railway station and a train. They met through Victor Duval, Elsie’s brother, and although they did not many until 1915, their romantic involvement had begun several years earlier.3 Nevertheless, throughout the period of suffrage militancy they continued to conduct their militant activities separately, creating very distinct identities and effectively put the personal side of their relationship ‘on hold’ choosing instead to focus on their individual political endeavours. In this sense,their commitment to the cause cannot be questioned but why they chose to function in this way warrants further discussion.There are a number of factors that determined their political activity which also reveal the complexities of being involved in the suffrage movement at this time. Membership of the MPU and the WSPU was segregated by gender and, as ‘will be seen, the evolving nature of the relationship between these two organisations and their policies would not have enabled Hugh Franklin and Elsie Duval to function as a political partnership in the same way as the Pethick-Lawrences. As relative ‘late-corners’ to the cause, not least because of their ages,their introduction to the suffrage campaigns was influenced, and to an extent dictated by, family alliances\n\nElsie Duval was arrested on the 23 Nov 1911 for obstructing the police. After this event, she was officially accepted by the Women’s Social & Political Union (WSPU) as a militant protest volunteer. Whilst on remand, Elsie had her “state of mind inquired into” writing “They have got it into their heads that I am sixteen years of age. You know I refuse to give my age.”\n\nOn 27 Jun 1912, Elsie was arrested for smashing a Clapham Post Office window. Subsequently she was remanded for one week in custody ‘for the state of her mind to be enquired into’, and then sentenced to one month in the third division at Holloway, during which time she was forcibly fed nine times before being released on the 3 Aug 1912. She was arrested again in Apr 1913 for loitering with intent (with Phyllis Brady) and was again sent to prison for a month. She was forcibly fed during both remand and whilst serving her sentence, being seriously ill throughout and often resisting strenuously. Her prison diary for this year refers to ‘pain at the heart’ after one of these incidents.\n\nShe was released under the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act, 1913, (commonly known as the ‘Cat and Mouse’ Act) which allowed for prisoners to return to prison on recovery. Elsie was the first prisoner released from Holloway under the Act and the second to be released (Hugh was the first) from any prison. During her last imprisonment (according to Hugh Franklin’s biographical notes) a charge was being prepared for burning Lady White’s house at Egham, with ‘Phyllis Brady’, (Olive Beamish) for which the latter received five years’ imprisonment. Elsie also burnt Sanderstead station and other places, before her arrest, together with ‘Phyllis Brady’.\n\nAt the time of the attack, no-one was arrested. However, on the 12th April 1913 Phyllis Brady (real name Olive Beamish) and Millicent Dean (Elsie Duval) were approached by a police officer whilst walking in Croydon at 1.45am. They were both carrying leather traveling cases and claimed they were returning from holiday. They were followed by the policeman and decided to drop their cases and run but were caught and arrested for being found with inflammable material with the intention of committing a felony. According to some sources, both women had been responsible for burning Sanderstead station and other unnamed targets. They were also suspected of the burning of Trevethan house, and a case was being built against them.\n\nHowever, they were not charged for this offence but instead were remanded in custody and then sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment in Holloway jail. Both went on hunger strike and were forcibly fed. While they were in prison ‘The Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913’ came into force. Commonly known as the ‘Cat and Mouse Act’, this allowed prisoners who were in danger of dying to be released and then taken back into prison shortly after when they had recovered a little. Elsie and Olive were released under the act on the 28th April 1913. Both absconded after they had been released and did not return to prison.\n\nChurchill was Home Secretary and he was widely blamed for the police excesses on display. Hugh was angered by what he had seen, began to follow Churchill to heckle him at public meetings. On the train back from a meeting in Bristol, Hugh met Churchill and set on him with a dog whip , shouting “Take this, you cur, for the treatment of the suffragists!”\n\nThe attack was widely reported, even reaching the headlines of The Times and for the Franklin family, it was a great embarrassment. He was imprisoned for six weeks and dismissed as Sir Nathan’s secretary. In March 1911, he was sentenced for another month for throwing rocks at Churchill’s house. Hugh took part in the hunger strikes that were then being waged by the suffragettes, and was force-fed repeatedly during his imprisonment. The force feeding turned him into an activist for penal reform.\n\nElsie and Hugh left for France to avoid the re-imprisonment that her terms of temporary release had demanded. She spent several months working as ‘Eveline Dukes’ in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland armed with false testimonials provided by friends.\n\nIn Europe, Elsie went under the alias Eveline Dukes and had many fake references allowing her to get employed in various different countries. Using the several character references she had, all provided by people who knew her such as her brother Victor- who she got a job in Germany as a governess for 10 months. She then spent three months in Brussels learning French and doing office work, followed by two months in Switzerland. At first she believed she may have been able to travel with Hugh but actress and fellow suffragist Winifred Mayo warned against this. In March 1914, during her time abroad, she received a letter from Jessie Kenney writing under the alias C. Burrows which said: ‘Miss Pankhurst thinks it would be better for you to stay where you are for the time being and until you get stronger’. But when World War One began in 1914 Elsie and Hugh returned to the UK after a general amnesty was granted to the suffragettes. After this she became active in the war work of the WSPU.\n\nShe and Hugh were finally married in a Jewish ceremony at the London Synagogue in September 1915. She had converted to Judaism. Hugh’s mother attended the wedding but not her father. Elsie had asked Emmeline Pankhurst to be one of their witnesses but she wasn’t well enough at that time. Two years later, she joined the Pankhursts’ Women’s Party.\n\nSadly Elsie died on the 1st January 1919 of heart failure, a victim of the influenza epidemic. She had, undoubtedly, been weakened by her treatment in prison when she was force-fed.\n\nVictor Duval 1885-1945 had been the secretary of the Clapham League of the Young Liberals. He resigned from it after seeing a woman thrown out of one of John Burn’s meetings – the one time socialist of Battersea was now very much seen as a renegade once he joined the Liberal Government, especially by our suffragette Charlotte Despard.\n\nIn 1909 Victor helped Marion Dunlop to stencil her petition on the walls of St Stephen’s Hall in the House of Commons and in October 1910 he had co-founded the MPU\n\nThe Men’s Political Union for Women’s Enfranchisement was based at number 13 Buckingham Street. The MPU had been founded at a meeting held at the Eustace Miles Restaurant (just the other side of the Strand) in 1910. One of the founders – and the hon. organising secretary of the MPU – was Victor Duval. The premises were also, I think, the offices of his family firm, Duval & Co. Victor’s mother, Emily Duval, had been one of those who transferred allegiance from the WSPU to the WFL and would doubtless have been a regular visitor to number 18 on the other side of the street. https://womanandhersphere.com/tag/mens-political-union-for-womens-enfranchisement/\n\nVictor’s book ‘An Appeal to Men’, criticises the ongoing reliance on politics as a driver for change, his reasoning being due to the ineffectiveness of the “fourteen Woman Suffrage Bills…introduced into Parliament since 1870. This saw Duval respond by provoking an urgency for radical action, with his ‘Men’s Political Union for Women’s Suffrage’ personifying this aim, being described as ‘The national bastion for male militancy\n\nhttp://www.naomipaxton.co.uk/blog/suffragette-extras-up-the-men &nbsp; I liked the description of their role in the WSPU 1911 Christmas Fair, where they ran the ‘Fun of the Fair’ section of the event that included a Roundabout, Hoopla, and a Shooting Gallery. This Shooting Gallery was run jointly with the Croydon branch of the WSPU and was advertised as where “Suffragists and Anti-Suffragists alike can try their skill with an air-gun” so that participants “will realise that muscular force is not the basis of all Government or even of all fights… but that skill and determination have to be taken into account.” The entertainments also included Suffrage Shies, a Suffrage Punch and Judy show written by Inez Bensusan, a member of the Actresses’ Franchise League.\n\nVictor was was imprisoned for a week for a disturbance after he addressed Lloyd George outside City Temple. He served on the committee of the International Women’s Franchise Clubs. He published two pamphlets the other was ‘Why I went to prison’. He spent two years of the war in Salonika serving with the Royal Engineers. He rejoined the Liberal Party and stood unsuccessfully at three elections.\n\nUna Dugdale, suffragette and marriage reformer. Una was a debutante daughter of Commander Edward Stratford Dugdale and his wife, who were supporters of the suffrage movement. Una was educated at Cheltenham Ladies College, and later in Hanover and Paris where she studied singing. She was niece of Arthur Peel 1st Viscount Peel, Speaker of the House of Commons. Apparently, her parents household had five servants and they had a holiday home near Aberdeen. Her sisters Daisy and Joan were also active suffragettes. Joan wrote a play 10 Clowning Street. http://www.naomipaxton.co.uk/blog/suffragette-extras-up-the-men\n\nIn 1907, after hearing Christabel Pankhurst speak in Hyde Park, Una joined the Women’s Social and Political Union. She worked alongside Emmeline Pankhurst to campaign for women’s rights and the vote in Scotland as she accompanied her on her Scottish tours.\n\nShe was part of confrontational direct actions undertaken by suffragettes and, in 1909, was arrested and imprisoned for a month following her involvement in the raid on the House of Commons. Una was the co-founder and treasurer of the Suffragette Fellowships. I found this wonderful BBC radio recording of Una Duval. Please do listen. http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/suffragettes/8305.shtml\n\nUna met Victor when he acted as best man at Frank Rutter’s wedding on 13 January, 1912, at the Savoy Chapel. She scandalised society by refusing to include the word ‘obey’ in her vows. She saw marriage as an equal partnership. She was advised that if she did not, the marriage would not be legal. However, at the wedding, she did not repeat obey after the clergyman spoke. He said that he hoped there would be an amended form of the service created. Her father accompanies her down the aisle but did not ‘hand her over’ to her future husband.\n\nChristabel Pankhurst, Constance Lytton and the Pethick-Lawrences attended dressed in WSPU colours. The Mirror ran the headline, ‘The Bride Who would Not Promise to Obey.’\n\nI found newspaper references to it in international newspapers like the Chicago Examiner and the New York Herald Jan 13th 1912. I discovered – the joys of the internet- that Victor’s best man was an actor called Ernest Thesiger http://ernestthesiger.org/Ernest_Thesiger/Chronology.html (I also found out that Ernest was an expert embroiderer and written a book on it. https://www.britishpathe.com/video/ernest-thesiger-expert-embroiderer and that he was Dr Septimus Pretorius in The Bride of Frankenstein with our own Notable Woman of Lavender Hill Elsa Lanchester. Elsa and Ernest were both friends of the director James Whale who was also British and used to frequent Elsa’s Cave of Harmony club in Charlotte Street.\n\nIt was exciting to discover that the renowned Duval suffrage family lived down our road and thrilled to find the photo of them in their backyard. So, they joined my Notable Women of Lavender Hill walk.\n\nI gave a zoom talk to the Battersea W1 on 16th June 2020. The number of notable women included has grown since I first started doing the walks. Jeanie Nassau Senior 1828-1877, first woman civil servant at Battersea Town Hall, Olive Morris Black activist, Catherine Gurney OBE 1843-1930 Police Welfare provider, Normanby House Lavender Hill (demolished), Charlotte Despard 1844-1939 suffragette, socialist and Sinn Feiner, at 177 Lavender Hill whose plaque is there, Caroline Ganley CBE MP 1945-1951 lived at 5 Thirsk Road and is commemorated with a BS plaque, Ethel Mannin1900-1984 prolific author lived at 28 Garfield Road, Deaconess Isabella Gilmore 1842-1923, 113 Clapham Common Northside, Marie Spartali 1844-1927 Pre-Raphaelite artist lived at The Shrubbery Lavender Gardens and is honoured now with an English heritage plaque , Laura Barker 1819-1905 composer Lavender Sweep House, Emily, Norah, Elsie, Winifred and Barbara Duval Suffragettes 97 Lavender Sweep, Biddy 1871-1966 socialist/feminist and Elsa Lanchester, 1902-1986 Hollywood actress – The Bride of Frankenstein – who lived at 27 Leathwaite Road, Violet Piercy first British female marathon runner 21 Leathwaithe Road Penelope Fitzgerald 1916-2000 author and Booker prize winner for Offshore 1979 lived at 25 Almeric Road and Pamela Hansford Johnson CBE 1912-1971 novelist lived at 53 Battersea Rise, Farrago restaurant and has a Battersea Society plaque to her. I will admit that I had a hand in those honoured with plaques!\n\nThere is a dearth of English Heritage plaques commemorating women. There were seventeen EH/LCC plaques in Battersea but none to women but now it one. Even if fifty percent women are receiving English Heritage plaques that is only six a year and it will take another generation before we have gender equality in blue plaques in London.\n\nEmily is shown in this cover of the Wandsworth Common Story.\n\nIt was great to be contacted by Duval descendants recently – Adrian who lives in Australia is grandson of Norah and his half sister Jenny Slaughter whose father Derek was Norah’s son and Tilly who is great granddaughter of Victor and Una.\n\nJenny wrote about the sad story of Ernest: Adrian and I followed his history back to the Lyon district of France where the family were big into silk weaving. As well as the suffragette stories there is a treasure trove of info about his family in Bourgoin Jallieue. In 1880s, he came to England to join his mother after being educated in Germany. He was the illegitimate son of Emilie Diederichs. The name Duval was adopted at this point, perhaps so he wouldn’t be identified as her son. He had no English.\n\nAt the time of the 1881 England census, Amelie Diedrichs native of France, 38, teacher of French, was head of household at 52 Wycliffe Rd, civil parish of Battersea ; she had a lodger, Ernest Duval, 23, corresponding clerk, native of Germany (Ernst Carl August was born in Mainz). Ernest’s age is correct, but Emilie / Amelie has understated her age by 5 years, possibly in order to appear just 15 years older than her lodger and thus (on paper) a little less like his mother.\n\nOn the 19th of September 1881, the year of the census, Ernest Charles Augustus Duval, bachelor, resident at the same 52 Wycliffe Rd, married Jane Emily Hayes, spinster, also resident at 52 Wycliffe Rd, in the presence of (among others) his “landlady”, A. Diedericks [sic]. The marriage record names Ernest’s father as “Edward Duval, merchant” ; fact or fiction?\n\nOn the 29th of June, 1904, Ernest Duval, now called Diederichs Duval, “subject of Germany”, became a naturalized Briton. Given Amilie Diederichs’ evident anxiety not to be identified as an unmarried mother, I suspect she had already returned to France ; she was by 1904, I believe, the oldest surviving member of her immediate family.\n\nThe last knowledge that I have of Amilie is a letter, written by Ernest in July 1915, to Mademoiselle Diederichs at Bourgoin, where her nephews controlled the Diederichs factories (which continued in business till 1992), which says : “As you are the only person who can, for the moment, say in what town in Alsace I was registered at birth as a Frenchman, I shall be glad if you will forward the necessary information.” Ernest’s letter, unanswered, was stamped “Decedé” (deceased) and forwarded (as Ernest had requested, if undeliverable) to Victor.\n\nThe letter contains the telling words “Since our correspondence has ceased […]”, implying a rift between mother and son ; and speaks also of his, Ernest’s, unhappiness at being shut out of the Diederichs family : “I have never intruded on any of them in my life, that is I have silently borne insult and contumely alone. I met one of your brothers at my house. I did not disclose my identity. […] In deference to you, I refrained and everything was kept in wicked secrecy.” It’s quite a heartbreaking letter, because it is evident that Amilie had loved Ernest enough to raise him herself and educate him properly, at a time when an unmarried mother was a social pariah, yet the apparent price of a comfortable retirement in France was continued denial and secrecy. Ernest seems to be at pains in the letter to underline the fact that his heirs were marrying into “society”, thus asserting that they were quite worthy to associate with the Diederichs of Bourgoin-Jallieu.\n\nI took this photo in Wycliffe Road of this church which is now Greek Orthodox church of St Nectarios. It was built in 1901 as a C of E Church so it was not there when Ernest and Emily married as most of the Victorian housing has been replaced including number 52. Right next to it is the new John Burns School named after the former Battersea MP.\n\nI was chuffed to see Duval House, opposite Clapham Junction Station in Grant Road, named after them. I had given the name to Gareth Jones who used to have responsibility for street and block names for new developments in Wandsworth Council. I am not sure I could have persuaded him to accept the full name.\n\nI was so delighted when the Diederichs Duval Suffrage Family were selected for this year’s Wandsworth Council green plaque by colleagues on the Wandsworth Heritage Group. It was a delight to meet their descendants at last.\n\nViolet Piercy female marathon record setting runner is an addition to my roster of Notable Women of Lavender Hill walk. She was a marathon runner at a time when the maximum official distance for women was a 1000 metres! Violet Stewart Louisa Piercy lived, in the early thirties, at 21 Leathwaite Road which overlooks Clapham Common. Derrick Johnson of the Clapham Society brought her to my attention when he came on the first walk I led and I promised I would include her along with the motley of significant women who lived in this area around Lavender Hill. It starts at Battersea Arts Centre and finishes at 53 Battersea Rise. There are now 15 women included in this walk. https://wordpress.com/page/sheelanagigcomedienne.wordpress.com/12081\n\nOf the seventeen EH/LCC blue plaques in Battersea none commemorated women when I started my researches, now there is an English Heritage one to Marie Spartali on the Shrubbery in Lavender Gardens. We now have ten plaques to women – Caroline Ganley CBE MP 1945-1951 at 5 Thirsk Road, Charlotte Despard socialist, suffragette and Irish nationalist on 177 Lavender Hill, Katherine Low on the Settlement Battersea High Street, Evelyn Dove cabaret performer on 25a Barnard Road, Penelope Fitzgerald Booker Prize winning author on 25 Almeric Road, Pamela Hansford Johnson novelist and critic at 53 Battersea Rise, Wilhelmina Stirling De Morgan Collection on Old Battersea House, Hilda Hewlett aviator first British female pilot at 4 Vardens Road and Diederichs Duval Suffrage Family on 97 Lavender Sweep.\n\nThere is an article on her in the New York Times in a series on overlooked women. Overlooked No More: Violet Piercy, Pioneering Marathoner https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/obituaries/violet-piercy-overlooked.html\n\nBetween the two world wars, Violet Piercy became the very first woman to run a marathon – a feat not repeated by anyone of her sex for almost 40 years! Women were excluded from the Olympics when Violet was running.\n\nViolet is recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federation as having set the first women’s world’s best in the marathon on 3 October 1926 with a time of 3:40:22. She was reported to have run unofficially and her mark was set on the Polytechnic Marathon course between Windsor and London and finishing at Battersea Town Hall. However, the Association of Road Running Statisticians includes Violet but notes Marie Louise Ledru of France as the first woman to run a marathon According to the ARRS, Ledru ran 5:40 at the Tour de Paris Marathon held on 29 September 1918. According to the IAAF, Violet Piercy’s mark stood 37 years until Merry Lepper’s 3:37:07 performance at the Western Hemisphere Marathon on 16 December 1963.\n\nViolet Stewart Louisa Piercy was born at 15 Clarendon Road, Croydon, on Christmas Eve, 1889, the daughter of a property owner who died before she was born. She attended Old Palace of John Whitgift School and in 1911 was living in Croydon with her widowed mother.\n\nHere is a link to the silent Pathe clip from 1927 http://www.britishpathe.com/video/camera-interviews-the-runner/query/Violet\n\nBefore we look at Violet’s story we need to bear in mind that before the 1980s, there were no women’s distance races in the Olympics. http://www.marathonguide.com/history/olympicmarathons/chapter25.cfm\n\nIn the Moscow Games, the longest race for women was the 1,500 meters, which had been instituted in 1972. Women had been excluded from track and field competition altogether until 1928, when the longest race was the 800 meters. Despite a world record by winner Lina Radke of Germany, many of the competitors had not properly prepared for the race and several collapsed in exhaustion. This led Olympic organizers to consider the race too strenuous for women. The president of the IOC, Count Henri Baillet-Latour, even suggested the elimination of all women’s competition from the Games. Such a drastic move was not taken, but until 1960, when the 800 meters reappeared, no race over 200 meters was contested by women in the Olympics.\n\nBefore 1972, women had been barred from the most famous marathon outside the Olympics – Boston. That rule did not keep women from running, though. In 1966, Roberta Gibb hid behind a bush at the start of the Boston Marathon, sneaking into the field and finishing the race in an unofficial time of 3:21:25. She was the first woman known to complete the arduous Boston course. Gibb had been inspired to run by the return of her race entry with a note saying that women were not physically capable of running a marathon.\n\nOn August 31,1971 Adrienne Beames of Australia became the first women to run a sub-three-hour marathon, smashing that barrier with a time of 2:46:30.On October 28, 1973, the first all women’s marathon was held in Waldniel, West Germany.The first women’s marathon officially sanctioned by the IAAF was the Tokyo International, held in November of 1979. IAAF officially recommended to the IOC that a women’s marathon be included in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Lost in the headlines about the end of amateurism at the Olympics and the selection of Seoul and Calgary for the 1988 Games was the fact that women had finally won the right to compete in an Olympic Marathon.\n\n1984 – Joan Benoit. Almost a century after Melpomene was denied the opportunity to run in the first modern Olympics’ marathon, Joan Benoit, USA, won the gold in the field of 50 women from 28 nations who competed in the first Women’s Olympic Marathon. (Summer Olympics in LA.)\n\nNow back to Violets story. I got most information from the piece written by Derrick Johnson which appeared in the South London Press. https://claphamsociety.com/Articles/article22-a-fast-lady.html and from http://clappedoutrunner.blogspot.com/2015/08/violet-and-paula-englands-gift-to.html\n\nIt seems Violet had a number of natural talents ahead of her time, one of which was a gift for public relations. Over a period of around 12 years she gained much publicity for her various runs and became well known across the land and beyond. She was widely regarded as an eccentric and feisty character.\n\nWhen she got started the maximum distance for a women’s race was set at 1,000 metres. This was ludicrous according to Violet. Aged 31 she boldly marched down to the London Olympiades club and signed up as a member – although still had to do her training alone. To demonstrate to the world that women could be good at sport and endurance events, she decided to run a solo marathon along the Windsor to London route.\n\nThis appeared in the South London Press in 1934 and spelt her name with an extra e.\n\nTo the amazement of onlookers, she set off at 4.20pm on Saturday 2nd October 1926 from near Windsor Castle. She made good steady progress early on, reaching Hounslow well before 6. After this suburban traffic slowed her down and she finally finished outside Battersea Town Hall around 8pm. Her time was recorded at 3 hrs 40 mins.\n\nShe told reporters: “I did it because I wanted to show the Americans what we can do and to prove Englishwomen are some good after all!” Presumably this was a reference to the recent efforts of Americans Gertrude Ederle and Amelia Corson, who had stunned the people of Britain and France by successfully swimming the Channel.\n\nAlthough cross-Channel swimming became popular in subsequent years, women’s distance running certainly didn’t. The reaction to Violet’s great feat was mixed. The Westminster Gazette wrote: “It must be hoped that no other girl will be so foolish as to imitate her.” All Sports Weekly were equally firm: “The marathon should be cut out by the women.”\n\nViolet scoffed at all this and appeared on BBC radio telling listeners that doing athletics would help produce a race of women “capable of and suited to motherhood” because the sport was based on rhythm, co-ordinated movement and clean living.\n\nThere is a quirky Pathe video entitled Mary had a little lamb from 1930. https://www.britishpathe.com/video/mary-had-a-little-lamb-1\n\nThirty-seven years after Violet’s pioneering first marathon Dale Greig representing Scotland was the second British woman to take the plunge and chalked up a time of 3:27:45. There is no record of whether Merry Lepper or Dale Grieg had heard of Violet Piercy and nobody in the media was able (or interested enough) to track down Violet to ask her about the women who followed in her footsteps at long last.\n\nIn the next few years Violet claimed a series of records for road running but as this was new for a woman and she had no competitors she was able to do this with fairly modest performances. She also finished her runs at locations where she would get maximum publicity. In 1933 she completed a third solo run from Windsor past thousands of cheering spectators and finishing on the stage of the Shepherds Bush Empire. Two years later she ran five and a quarter miles from the Whittington Stone in Highgate and up the 311 steps to the top of the Monument in 43 minutes 2 seconds. ‘I did it to prove that a woman’s stamina can be just as remarkable as a man’s’ she told the South London Press (2 April, 1935).\n\nIt was not until 13 June 1936, with the connivance of the organisers of the Polytechnic Harriers race from Windsor to Stamford Bridge, and setting off ahead of the male runners, that Violet completed a run over the official distance of 26 miles 385 yards (42.195 km). Her finishing time of 4 hours 30 minutes is extremely modest by today’s standards but her record lasted until 1964. She was also 46 years old and as she said: ‘I only wanted to prove that women could stick the distance’.\n\nThe 1939-45 War seems to have ended her running career and she quickly sank into obscurity. Little is known of her life after 1938 except that electoral registers show a woman of her name living in lodgings in Battersea and Wandsworth up to 1958. Apparently, she was involved in a court case when she was a medical secretary for a Dr Coplans of Leathwaite Road and they had a disagreement which ended up in court.\n\nViolet was a symbol of female strength between 1926 and 1938 as the first British female long-distance runner. She ran long distances “to prove that a woman’s stamina can be just as remarkable as a man’s,” (South London Press, 2 April 1935), and is now often credited as the inspirational figure behind modern female long-distance runners.\n\nHowever, it very sad that recent evidence suggests that an elderly woman of no fixed address who died in a London hospital in April 1972 was the once-famous Violet Piercy. She had suffered a brain haemorrhage, hypertension and chronic kidney-related infection. The death certificate mistakenly gave her surname as Pearson, which ruled out any chance of her being immediately recognised as the former celebrity runner.\n\nViolet languished in obscurity for something like 70 years but recent developments have changed all that . . . . there’s now a clip of her running on-line at the British Pathe archive, she has an entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and the novelist Peter Lovesey has written at length about her in Track Stats magazine.https://www.nuts.org.uk/trackstats/piercy.htm\n\nHowever, there is no doubt that Violet set a trend which is still with us as so many women are found running especially on Clapham Common when I go for my regular walks.\n\nViolet Piercy female marathon icon, one time neighbour of the Lanchester family on Leathwaite Road, I will happily include you on my walk of the inspiring Female Lavender Hill mob. So, Violet Piercy we salute you as you join the other inspiring Women of Lavender Hill!\n\nSince I started my Notabale Women of Lavender walks I discovered this vibrant young black activist was said to have lived on Lavender Hill when she first came over from Jamaica to join her parents in 1962 aged 9. However, I since ascertained through the Metroploitian arhives that the Morris family lived at 7 Milford Street which was demolished and was off the Wandsworth Road. I am including Olive in my Notable Women of Lavender Hill walk as she attended Lavender Hill Girls School. I have spoken with her nephew Ferron Morris.\n\nIt was not unusual for the Windrush generation for parents to come ahead leaving the children with grandparents till they could sort out accommodation and jobs. I knew the name from Olive Morris House 18 Brixton Hill which is Lambeth’s Customer Service Centre. There one can make inquiries about benefits, council tax, rents and repairs, housing , school admission documents, Freedom Pass and parking permits. It was remodelled in 2009 when the revamped building was renamed the Civic Centre but Olive’s name was reinstated. There is currently some controversy about its future. http://www.brixtonbuzz.com/2019/02/brixtons-olive-morris-house-negotiations-hit-the-buffers/\n\nOlive was an amazing fiery activist from her teens and packed so much into her short life. She died tragically young in 1979 aged 27. I went to see the Olive Morris Archive at the Minet Library in Camberwell. Seeing the photos, letters flyers and papers etc forty years on, inevitably, makes one think what she might have done and what role would she have played in British political life.\n\nThe main sources I have used for details of Olive’s life come from the Remembering Olive Collective, thanks to the wonderful work of artist Ana Laura Lopez de la Torre and Liz Obi, who was another young activist and friend of Olive’s. They established the Remembering Olive Collective. In 2009 ROC launched the Olive Morris Collection at Lambeth Archives. https://rememberolivemorris.wordpress.com/ and Beverley Bryan, Stella. Dadzie, and Susanne Scafe, eds., The heart of the race: black women’s lives in Britain (1985), included an entry on Olive and Beverley also attended Lavender Hill School.\n\nThe Olive Morris Collection at the Minet Library contains some great photos from photographer Neil Kenlock as well as Olive’s own photos and memorabilia which includes her passport. The collection consists of contributions from her friend Liz and Mike McColgan her partner. This was launched in October 2009\n\nThere is also and item by Dr Angelina Osborn for the Fawcett Society. https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/blog/black-history-month-power-olive-morris, rememberolivemorris\n\nhttp://brixtonpound.org/showmemoney\n\nOlive was born on 26 June 1952 in Harewood, St Catherine’s, Jamaica, the daughter of Vincent Nathaniel Morris and his wife, Doris, née Moseley. When she was nine years old, she and her brother, Basil, left their maternal grandmother and joined her mother and father in Battersea in 1962 but not on Lavender Hill as is erroneosly repeated on internet items on her. They lived nearby just of Wandsworth Road. There were four further siblings. Olive’s father became a forklift operator and her mother was a factory shop steward.\n\nOlive attended Heathbrook Primary School and then Lavender Hill Girls’ Secondary School which was close by to where the lived. She finished her secondary education at Tulse Hill Secondary School. She was obviously a very able pupil but she experienced all the inequalities and injustices of the British education system. She left at sixteen with no qualifications, but undeterred, she went on to college to study ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels while at the same time holding down a full-time job. She studied at the London College of Printing.\n\nI lived at 108A Lavender Hill (one-time home of John Burns MP) briefly at this time with my sister and her husband in 64/65. In the seventies I was a Labour Governor of the school and became aware of how these girls were not been properly served by the education system. I can but wonder if I ever passed Olive in the street as she walked to school.\n\nThe late 1960s and 1970s were a particularly challenging time for Britain’s post-war African, African-Caribbean, and Asian communities. There was increased tension between police and the black community (epitomized by the ‘sus’ laws, that is, the laws allowing police officers to stop and search people on mere suspicion that they intended to commit a crime), and attacks by fascist groups such as the National Front, as well as discrimination in housing and employment.\n\nOlive became a tireless organizer and fighter against racism, and also sexism and other forms of oppression. In an early example of her political activism she intervened in the arrest of a Nigerian diplomat Mr Clement Gowalk for a parking offence in Brixton in 1969. Olive came upon the scene when Mr Gowalk had already been taken away but intervened when her friends who protested . She was physically assaulted and racially abused by the police and arrested, along with six other people, fined £10, and given a three-month suspended sentence for two years. The charges comprised assault on the police, threatening behaviour, and possession of dangerous weapons.\n\nOlive’s account of this is quite shocking to read about the treatment, brutality and abusive racist and misogynist language used by the police against a teenager. The vulgarity, misogyny, and physical violence turned into a full-fledged sexual assault. Olive’s account was printed in ”Black Panther News Service in May 1970 and analysed in this article by Anne-Marie Angelo ‘Any name that has power’. https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/7264\n\n“They all made me take off my jumper and my bra in front of them to show I was a girl.” After Morris disrobed, “The one with the truncheon said, ‘Now prove you are a real woman.’ He pointed at the truncheon in front of me and said, ‘Look it’s the right colour and the right size for you. Black cunt!’ Olive who, “was crying because I was in terrible pain,” asked to see a doctor. A police doctor appeared and told Olive that she was bruised and gave her two pills to take.\n\nIt seems extraordinary that a police doctor could accept this clear evidence of the assault of a teenage girl and then walk away and leave her with those who had assaulted her knowing that she was going to be charged. Olive said they “continued arguing about my sex. Another said I should strip and get on the table and give them a little demo.” At the end of this harrowing episode of physical, emotional, and sexual violence, Olive remembered, “My particulars were taken and I was charged with assaulting a policeman. I was then told to plead guilty when the case was called; and I was let out through the back way of the station at about 6 o’clock”.\n\nDowntrodden but not defeated, Olive found her way to nearby King’s College Hospital where she obtained treatment for her injuries. As she received treatment at King’s College that night, Black Panther photographer Neil Kenlock headed to the hospital where he took a photograph of Olive which provided evidence of her tenacity. She saved the photograph, scrawling a note on the back: “Taken at about 10 PM on 15 Nov 69 after the police had beating me up (at Kings College Hospital.)\n\nAs the newspaper later reports on Olive’s sentencing, “During the melee Miss Morris kicked a police officer and hit him on the jaw.” Olive’s handwriting on the reverse of the photo tells a different story, not related in the newspaper account: “Taken at about 10pm on 15th Nov 69 after the police had beaten me up.” I think I know which version we believe.\n\nThis awful experience of the police and their racist, misogynistic, bigoted attitudes and sheer brutality surely propelled Olive into action in fighting racism and injustice. She seemed to become fearless in confronting the police.\n\nIn the early 170s she became a member of the youth section of the Black Panther movement (later the Black Workers movement), along with others such as Linton Kwesi Johnson, Clovis Reid, and Farrukh Dhondy.\n\nFrom the Heart of the Race: ‘ it was here that she began to develop the political ideology which would determine her future actions. She gave a total commitment to the organisation’s work and development, and participated in nearly all of the battles which formed part of the community’s everyday life. She was in tune with the needs of the people, and always showed herself willing to take the initiative and act’… She became well known in the community for her willingness to help other Black people who were facing difficulties, whether with the schools, the police, housing, social security officials or the courts – whatever the issue, she was never too busy to offer support. For Olive, it was not just a case of doing things for those who couldn’t do it for themselves: it was her way of involving people in the struggle, showing by her own example the will to resist and to challenge.”\n\nBut teenage Olive was also curious about the world and she liked fashion. She loved jewellery, especially bangles. Ana Laura said : Of the many things that Liz had to say about Olive, there were two that stood out for me. The first was Liz description of Olive, and how she always visualised her whenever she thought of her: silver bangles on her arms and forever riding her bike. The second had to do with what Liz had learned from Olive: never to be afraid of anything.\n\nShe was interested in traveling as she was an internationalist. She visited Germany in 1971. In August 1972 she and her friend, Liz Obi, planned to visit the American Black Panther leader, Eldridge Cleaver, who was in exile in Algeria, but they became stranded in Morocco. There is an account of this trip in the archives.\n\nThe Brixton Black Women’s Group was started by Olive Morris and other women who had been active in the Black Panther Movement. The Group was formed to address the specific issues faced by Black women, and to offer advice and support to those in difficulties. It originally operated from Olive and Liz’s squat at 65 Railton Road. With the years, the BWG developed and transformed into the Black Women Centre, relocating its premises to Stockwell Green.\n\nGail Lewis talks about the the group and the similarities and differences with mainly white feminist groups, especially the wider focus of poverty, racism, housing, education suss laws etc http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/sisterhood/clips/activism/consciousness-raising/143112.html\n\nOlive along with Liz Obi played a major role in the squatting movement in Brixton which is why we now have the iconic photo of her climbing back in after eviction in the squatters handbook from that time.\n\nShe squatted at 121 Railton Road, Brixton, with Liz in 1973. The squat became an organizing centre for community groups such as Black People against State Harassment as well as housing Sabaar Bookshop, which was one of the first black community bookshops. 121 Railton Road remained a social centre and a hub for the squatting movement until it was closed in 1999.\n\nOLIVE MORRIS, SQUATTERS’ HANDBOOKhttps://boroughphotos.org/lambeth/olive-morris-squatters-handbook/\n\nThe 1979 Squatters’ Handbook published by the Advisory Service for Squatters with chapters on law, moving in and eviction. The cover shows the black community activist Olive Morris scaling a building. Olive actively campaigned for squatting and opened the 121 Railton Road squat in 1973 with Liz Obi, which later became the Sabaar Bookshop and an anarchist centre in the 1980s.\n\nThere is an account of the squatting movement and a section on Brixton.\n\nhttps://en.squat.net/2014/05/20/squatting-in-england-heritage-prospects/\n\nDespite living side by side and having cordial relations, Black and White squatters did not organise themselves together. Liz Obi remembers that when they squatted 121 Railton Road, some white squatters came to help them turn on the gas and the electricity. During evictions some women from the “White Women Center” also came to show support, but that was as far as the relationship went. Black activists at the time were focused on the many specific issues affecting the Black community (police violence, discrimination in education and workplace, etc). The absence of joint activity might explain why in most accounts of the Brixton squatting movement written in later years, there are no references to the early Black squats of the 1970s.\n\nIn July 1974 Morris returned to Jamaica for six weeks.\n\nThe following year she began a degree in economics and social science at Manchester University.\n\nHeart of the Race :In 1975, she went to Manchester University to study for a social science degree. This in itself was an important step for Olive, who believed in education for the people. For her, going to university was not a status symbol, but an example to many young Black people of how to fight and win against a system which tries to push us to the bottom of the education pile and force us to compete against each other.\n\nUnlike many students, Olive did not separate her work at the university from the struggles which were being waged in the rest of the community. In her work with the Manchester Black Women’s Co-operative and the Black Women’s Mutual Aid Group, which she helped to set up, she participated fully in the black community’s battles in Moss Side. Committed to furthering education rights for Black people, she campaigned with Black mothers for better schooling for their children and helped to set up a supplementary school and a Black bookshop in the area. Because she was an internationalist, she also worked at the university within the National Co-ordinating Committee of Overseas Students. She provided an essential link between international, community and women’s organisations, drawing the parallels between our experiences here and in the Third World.\n\nShe visited Italy and Northern Ireland in 1976. In 1977 she visited China and wrote a piece entitled ‘A sister’s visit to China’ which explored the role of China in anti-imperialist struggles. It was published in Speak Out!, the Brixton Black Women’s Group newsletter.\n\nThe Heart of the Race ” In 1978, Olive visited China. The trip was of great significance to her, for she saw China as one of the countries which Third World peoples could learn a lot from, and which could serve as a model for us in self-help and self-reliance. The lessons she learn there were shared with everyone she worked with on her return. Sharing knowledge was always her practice.\n\nOlive had always identified the relationships between the struggles of people in the Third World and those of the white working class. She recognised that it was a fight which had to be won through the contribution of both groups, and that we would need to work together if we were to bring about any meaningful changes. It was this awareness which was her greatest contribution to the political development of those she worked with.”\n\nIn 1978 she, along with Stella Dadzie and other women, founded the Organization of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD). OWAAD held its first conference at the Abeng centre on Gresham Road in Brixton, a centre that Olive had helped to establish along with Elaine Holness and other members of the community.\n\nThis article from the Guardian in 2014 which sets out the experiences of women from the West Indies includes Olive. https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/06/black-women-in-britain-from-the-romans-to-the-windrush\n\nOlive graduated in 1978 and returned to Brixton, working in the juvenile department of the Brixton Community Law Centre where she was involved in the campaign to scrap the ‘sus’ laws. She lived at 2 Talma Road, Brixton. She was also a burgeoning writer and co-wrote a piece on the Anti-Nazi League with her partner, Mike McColgan. ‘Has the Anti-Nazi League got it right on racism?’ was published in a flyer for the Brixton Ad-Hoc Committee against Police Repression in 1978 and criticized the strategy of focusing on fighting fascism, while largely ignoring the impact of institutionalized racism: the role of the police, the education system, and so on.\n\nBeverely Bryan :“Olive and I went to the same school. Even then she had that streak in her – in school, they would have called it rebelliousness or disruptiveness, but it was really a fearlessness about challenging injustice at whatever level. This made others very weary of her, she was so obviously a fighter. I saw her once confronting a policeman – it might have been when she was evicted. She went at him like a whirlwind and cussed him to heaven. And this policeman looked really taken aback, he didn’t know how to deal with someone who had no fear of him. He was meant to represent the big arm of the law. But because she was angry and she knew he was in the wrong, she didn’t hesitate.\n\nShe would take anybody on like that, even people in organisations if she thought that someone needed to expose their hypocrisy for mounting slogans and living a lie. Because of that, a lot of them saw her as a pain in the neck and she was too! She’d fight them physically, if it was necessary. If you moved with Olive, you couldn’t be a weak heart. She gave a lot of support to so many sisters though, when they came under pressure from the brothers at meeting or wherever. She was a real example, You didn’t see it then, of course, but that fearlessness of hers, and that genuine commitment she showed to the work she did made her stand out, made her special.\n\nOlive became ill during a trip to Spain in 1978. On her return to London, she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and underwent treatment which was unsuccessful. She died on 12 July 1979 at St Thomas’s Hospital, Lambeth, and was buried in Streatham Vale cemetery. She was survived by her partner, Mike McColga. Her premature death was a shock to her friends, family, and political colleagues.\n\nOlive Morris on the Brixton Pound\n\nhttp://brixtonpound.org/blog/2015/06/25/olive-morris/ Several people asked how Olive Morris came to feature on the first edition Brixton Pound note. The reason for this is very simple. When we began designing the currency back in 2009 we asked lots of people from Brixton who they thought should go on the notes. We had a stall at the Lambeth Country Show and on online voting poll. Olive’s name kept coming up.\n\nAs we looked into it more, it seemed Olive Morris was a brilliant choice to be the first person to go on a Brixton Pound. She was an activist – campaigning on many social justice issues including racism, unemployment, police violence and squatters rights. She was also a member of the British Black Panthers and a socialist and she supported anti-colonial struggles internationally.\n\nMoney and power are at the heart of many of the issues that Olive campaigned on. Just take a look at our national currency, sterling, and look at the images that are chosen and the symbols they represent. If you go to the British Museum you can also see notes issued by the British Government in the British Colonies and they look very similar to the notes that we still use today.\n\nThe Brixton Pound deliberately chose images and symbols that break tradition with this colonialist past. Olive Morris was a disrupter and we are proud to put her image on the first issue of the notes in the place that is usually reserved for the Queen. We hope this may encourage more people to look at the inequalities sustained and perpetuated by our current financial system and challenge them, just as Olive Morris did.\n\nSince putting Olive Morris on the Brixton Pound we have had many people come and talk to us who remember Olive. They have told us a bit about her and her life. We hope that, alongside organisations like the Remembering Olive Collective, we can help keep her legacy alive.\n\nLet us spread the word about the inspiring black activist Olive Morris who came to live in Battersea as a nine year old then as an activist in Brixton and at university in Manchester but whose legacy is global.\n\nThere was a Black Power Women of Brixton Walk Sun Mar 10 2019 which included Olive info@blackhistorywalks.co.ukBlack people in Britain fought for civil/equal rights as hard as their American counterparts. The role of women in this struggle has been severely marginalised. This walk will show the life, times, and activities of numerous African/Caribbean women in Brixton. From the 1950’s to the 1980’s Black women supported and led the anti-racist fight in housing, education, employment, media and politics. The walk covered:\n\nThis article appeared in the South London Press in August 30th 2019. Toby , the editor, had said he would over time include some of the Notable Women of Lavender Hill and most of this is from my blog on her. There is one error resulting from mis-transcription which states that Olive lived at 108a Lavender Hill. She didn’t but I did! However, it’s great that Olive’s memory continues for new generations.\n\nMy Notable Women of Lavender Hill walk on Sunday 26th May 2019 included Olive. This walk is one of the Battersea Society contributions to the Wandsworth Heritage Festival 2019.There were no blue plaques to any of these women last year when I started these walks and now there are three.\n\nClare Consuela Sheridan ( 1885 -!970) has had the most varied, exotic and colourful life of these Notable Galway Women. She came from a well-connected cosmopolitan family. She was a sculptor, a writer, a restless nomad who wrote about her adventures, had relationships with intriguing men and she endured tragedy – with the death of her adored husband and two of her three children died before her. She had fascinating friends which reflected her cosmopolitan background of Anglo-Irish American parentage. Her godmother was Consuela Vanderbilt, Duchess of Marlborough\n\nThrough her bust sculptures and journalistic assignments she was intimate with a variety of people including Irish Nationalists like Michael Collins, British politicians and aristocrats, the Mountbattens, Lady Diana Cooper, Vita Sackville-West and Vivien Leigh, Charlie Chaplin and the Russian revolutionaries. Through her cousin Winston Churchill she made useful connections as sculpture and writer and her biography Cousin Clare was written by the fascinating Galway based biographer Anita Leslie of Oranmore Castle who was also a cousin and is probably most definitive book on this remarkable life and she was a regular visitor there especially during her Galway years in the late forties. She lived in many exotic places and her her life seemed to be in phases. She came to live in Galway in 1947-1954, converted to Catholicism and devoted her skills to religious carvings. We visited Oranmore Castle in August 2017 whilst staying in Oranmore with my sister Ida. We met Leonie King who takes guides people around her fabulous and atmospheric home which is her castle. Leonie is the daughter of Anita Leslie. This blog is by Olivia King https://www.the-pool.com/people/women-we-love/2017/37/olivia-king-my-gran-the-nazi-fighter\n\nShe was born Clare Frewen in 1885, the only daughter among the children of the talented and wealthy three Jerome sisters. She had two brothers Hugh and Oswald whom she called Peter in her memoirs. The Jerome’s were a prominent New York family and her grandfather Leonard Jerome was nicknamed ‘the King of Wall Street’. Her father, Moreton Frewen (1853-1924), of Innishannon House in Cork led a peripatetic life, moving from England to America, then to Ireland and finally back to England again. He was was apparently he was a charming if financially incompetent adventurer known for reckless financial and political schemes and was briefly MP for Cork as an Independent ‘Home Ruler’. Nevertheless their house was burnt down in 1921. Michael Collins apologised to her for this when she interviewed him! Her father’s restlessness was echoed in Clare’s own life, which was spent constantly on the move.\n\nEven in 2017 the Mail on Sunday can splash headlines about her in their style http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4502608/Winston-Churchill-s-cousin-seductress-SOVIET-SPY.html\n\nShe bedded Trotsky, was molested by Mussolini, got spurned by Hitler and ran off with Charlie Chaplin: How Churchill’s cousin Clare Sheridan was a seductress… and Soviet spy\n\nClare was sent to the Convent of the Assumption in Auteuil, in Paris but when she announced to her family that she wished to convert to Catholicism she was removed and sent briefly to a finishing school in Darmstadt in Germany where she went to the opera twice a week and played ping-pong with German officers. A maid was sent to Darmstadt to fetch her home, and further attempts at conventional schooling were abandoned.\n\nClare went to balls at Dublin Castle and years later in her memoirs Naked Truth she amusingly described her first season at Dublin Castle with Lord Dudley masquerading as the King. She was then brought to London and dressed at some expense when she attended balls and parties and fell in love with a young stockbroker named Wilfred Sheridan when she was 17. http://spartacus-educational.com/Wilfred_Sheridan.htm She told her cousin Anita: “in Wilfred’s company she felt herself utterly natural, sparkling and gay” But her father disapproved as they wanted her to marry someone richer. Wilfred lent her books, including the works of his great grandfather Richard Brinsley Sheridan. She returned to Cork and commenced her first attempts at writing with a play called l’Ingénue.\n\nThis article by Peter Murray in Irish Arts review recounts incidents from her memoir Nude Veritas. https://www.irishartsreview.com/restless-spirit/\n\nOn one occasion her and her mother left Malta where Peter’s ship was based and went to Cannes penniless when she found a fiver that cousin Jack Churchill had given her for Christmas and then Clare was given fifty ponds by an old friend of her father’s which he stuffed into her shoe despite being told not to take money from men only books! Her mother cried but they kept the money. They went to Monte Carlo, Clare gambled, and won. The following year she relates her stay in Sweden with the Princess Margaret. She also went to Capri, where she stayed in a house owned by Swedish psychiatrist Axel Munthe. She attributed to Munthe her initial introduction to Bolshevism.\n\nMeanwhile, Clare’s family had moved from Cork to England, her mother buying Brede Place, a 14th-century ruin on Edward Frewen’s estate in Sussex. Henry James was just four miles away, at Rye. Clare became friends with James, and also with the novelist George Moore. She began to write articles and a novel, showing chapters to both James and Moore. Moore described it as ‘charming’ and a ‘dear little book.’ In response, Clare flung the manuscript across the room, danced on it, kicked it, and finally put a match to it.\n\nHe advised her to gain independence from her mother through marriage, and so on her return to England in 1910 she and Wilfred became engaged. He was said to be the best-looking man in England. At the wedding she refused to say the word ‘obey’, and the Canon was shocked by the irreverence of bride and groom. Clare settled in Sussex with Wilfred, where they had two children, Margaret and Elizabeth. However in 1914 Elizabeth died in infancy. Clare became friendly with Mary Watts, widow of artist George Frederick Watts, who ran a nearby pottery and who encouraged her to sculpt a memorial to her deceased daughter. She enrolled in the modelling section of the Guildford Technical School, bringing the half completed clay memorial with her.\n\nThe following year, her son Richard was born, but a few days later her Wilfred was killed at the Battle of Loos. He was probably the love of her life. They had parted only a few weeks earlier when they were staying at Frampton Court, his parental home where they hoped Dick would be born as heir. http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2011/11/the-curse-of-frampton/ ‘She stood there watching him walk away – so light of step, sunburned and handsome. Once he turned to wave. Then he was gone.” She was heart broken.. She was given the letter written by her beloved Wilfred which was found in his pocket. : “You will only read this if I am dead, and remember that as you read it I shall be by your side. Remember that all over England are broken hearts and ruined lives, remember that one splendid woman, such as you are, refusing to weep, and hugging her soul with pride at a soldier’s death, will consciously or unconsciously stiffen up and bring comfort to these… God keep you and help you and bring my little Margaret up happily. I can leave you nothing, darling, except the memory of years, and you know what our life together has been. Surely if perfection is attained we have attained it.”\n\nStricken by this second loss, and the deaths of other close friends in WWI, Clare resolved to devote her life to sculpture. She produced various types of images, but it was her portrait heads that made her reputation. She became a successful society artist. Among her sitters were HG Wells, Arnold Bennett, Gladys Cooper and Diana Manners at this time as well as Churchill.\n\nShe had been pursued by suitors Lord Birkenhead,and Alexander Thynne, son of the Marquis of Bath who was also killed in the War and Seymour Egerton who was the 6th Earl of Wilton, asked the widowed Clare to marry.\n\nThen she decided to travel to Russia where she succeeded in getting Lenin and Trotsky to sit for her. She had become in onvolved with Lev Kaminev which is chronicled in Mayfair to Moscow . https://archive.org/stream/mayfairtomoscowc00sher/mayfairtomoscowc00sher_djvu.txt\n\nThis infuriated Churchill who was very anti-Bolshevik and it caused the first of the ‘scandals’ that would keep her name buzzing on the world’s press wires for the next 30 years. Her life from this point on reads like the improbable plot to a novel – full of sex, tragedy and espionage, played out against a backcloth of bright young things and international power-brokers taking in America.\n\nShe set forth in search of dangerous adventures, interesting men and artistic fulfilment. She travelled most of the world and met people like Gandhi, Primo De Rivera, Gorky, H.G. Wells, Kemel Ataturk, Mussolini, Marconi, Rudyard Kipling etc. Clare had affairs with some of these while others sat for her while she worked on their portrait. She was a very good journalist and interviewed many world leaders including Michael Collins. She was the only journalist to get into the occupied Four Courts in Dublin and interview Rory O’Connor. She spent time in America and it was here she became entangled with Charlie Chaplain.\n\nIn 1925, she moved to Algeria where it was noted by M15 that “she appeared to be comfortably off and debt-free for the first time in 10 years”. She built a house on the edge of the Sahara at Biskra. In 1937, her beloved son Dick died of appendicitis at Constantine in Algeria. Clare took a large oak tree from the family home, Brede Place, in Sussex and carved it into his memorial. Carving in wood seems to have given her a fresh artistic direction. She went on a pilgrimage to Montana and Canada, staying with the Black Foot tribe on the Blood Reserve. Many of the objects she collected during her visit are kept at Hastings Museum. http://www.thekeep.info/clare-sheridan-a-woman-ahead-of-her-time/\n\nThe account of her dealings with Mussolini are chilling – his “nostrils flaring-head down like an angry bull.” Mussolini commented: “You will not leave till dawn, and then you will be broken in”. Anita Leslie continued: “He must seduce her. Sketch-book and clay flew to the ceiling, slaps, punches, wrestling, gasping cries of amazement (on both sides) filled the room. Clare couldn’t believe it true. Neither could Mussolini – she was taller than he, but he was stronger…. He blocked the way to the main door, but grabbing her handbag she made for the side exit. He got there before her and there was, according to her own account, a veritable hand-to-hand struggle for the key. Clare managed to snatch it and open the door. It took a long time, she said. But eventually she managed to wedge it open with her foot. Mussolini threw his whole heavy weight against the door to close it and caught her elbow in the process. Her screams of pain halted him. Purple in the face he stood back for a moment and she was able to wrench herself from his grasp.”\n\nShe made homes for herself in many strange and exotic places. She came to Galway in 1947 and lived in the house beside the Spanish Arch which later became the first museum of the city. The Palace Arthouse Cinema behind it has only opened in 2018.\n\nShe was by now doing a lot of carving in wood as well as stone. She spent a lot of time working in the grounds of Oranmore Castle, the home of her cousin Anita Leslie and Anita’s husband, Bill King. She got the castle mason to rough out big blocks of stone, which she could then hew into form. Clare was a well-known figure in Galway ‘floating around in her violet shaded tweed cloaks of ecclesiastical design’. These cloaks were made by her good friend Cis O’Máille of O’Máille’s Shop in Dominick Street, who regularly entertained Clare to Sunday lunch. Clare got on well with Claddagh fisherwomen who brought her baskets of fish when the boats came in. She was a regular visitor to the Poor Clares, and also to Kennys Bookshop.\n\nClare was still strong enough to carve, not only in wood but in stone, but she was very disappointed at the dearth of orders from the Church for her carvings. She had high hopes that the Bishop might buy the Madonna and Child for his new cathedral. She was not impressed when she saw the mosaics of JFK and Padraic Pearse, and she railed against the poor taste of those who had the power to spend. She offered the statue to a convent guest-house, but it was pointed out to her that as the Holy Child wore no trousers, some people might be offended. Her retort was “The renaissance did not consider underwear necessary, why should you”?\n\nShe has a crucifix in Salthill Church and a Madonna and Child on top of the Spanish Arch. By October 1st, 1952, she had sold Spanish Arch House and “so comes to an end another five year span on which the pattern of my life is so inadvertently composed ….. one five year span after another”. She lived in a guest house run by the Franciscan Convent Hope Castle at Castleblayney before moving to Allington Castle in Kent where she carved, from bog oak, a celebrated Madonna now at Brede.\n\nThe Spartacus piece on Clare is Interesting http://spartacus-educational.com/Clare_Sheridan.htm\n\nBelmont it looks rather sumptuously renovated. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/the-life-of-sex-scandal-and-tragedy-lived-by-winston-churchills/\n\nFrom 1956 she lived at Belmont House, Hastings not far from the High Street from where she wrote To the Four Winds in 1957 which was updating her memories. By this time, her scandalous days were a thing of the past and she lived here until her death in 1970. Clare Sheridan died in 1970 Parnham House Beaminster Dorset aged 84 years and is buried in the churchyard of St George’s, Brede.\n\nClare’s life is just so intriguing. She had the advantage of her class privilege and her connections but she carved out her own life and was a liberated woman who did her own thing despite the tragedies of losing her beloved husband when she was so young and her two children Elizabeth and Dick. Her earlier life when she packed in travel, living in wonderful houses, her many lovers, relationships with friends and relatives like Churchill, writing memoirs, articles, interviews and travel chronicles, bringing up children, meeting fascinating people, making friends and all the while sculpting till her contemplative religious life in her latter years. Her writings are so absorbing and easy to read and I love checking out photos and images. I am so glad to be able to include her in this assembly of memorable Galway women.\n\nRussian Portraits (Cape, 1921); published in the U.S as Mayfair to Moscow: Clare Sheridan’s Diary (1921)\n\nMy American Diary (New York, Boni and Liveright, 1922)\n\nIn Many Places (Cape, 1923)\n\nWest to East (1923)\n\nStella Defiant (Duckworth, 1923)\n\nAcross Europe with Satanella (Dodd, Mead and Company, 1925)\n\nThe Thirteenth (Duckworth, 1925)\n\nA Turkish Kaleidoscope (Duckworth, 1926)\n\nNuda Veritas (Butterworth, 1927); published in the US as Naked Truth (New York, Harper & Brothers, 1928)\n\nGreen Amber (1929)\n\nThe Substitute Bride (1931)\n\nArab Interlude (1936)\n\nRedskin Interlude (1938)\n\nWithout End (1939)\n\nMy Crowded Sanctuary (Methuen, 1945)\n\nTo the Four Winds (1957)\n\nRenowned actor and theatre director Siobhán McKenna (1923–86) takes her place among Notable Women of Galway. Siobhán was born in Belfast to a nationalist family, was a fluent gaelic speaker and moved to Galway when her father was appointed a lecturer in Mathematics in UCG.\n\nSiobhán Giollamhuire Nic Cionnaith was born in 1923 at 28 St James’s Park, off the Falls Road, Belfast, the second daughter of Gretta from Co. Longford, and her husband, Eoghan McKenna Millstreet, Co. Cork, lecturer in mathematics at the Municipal College of Technology, Belfast. She had an elder sister Nancy and they their early schooling was at the Dominican Convent, Falls Road, Belfast. In 1928 Eoghan McKenna moved his family to Fort Eyre at Shantalla, Galway, when he was appointed lecturer (later professor) in mathematical sciences at UCG.\n\nThey lived in Hansberry House, a three storey house which bookends the listed terrace of derelict shops which have been bought to be developed, and Spire House which is the home of the Jesus and Mary nuns who ran Scoil Ide Primary School which I attended. ( I remember visiting Mother Stanislaus there with Dave after we were married in 1967. It is now very shabby as it has been turned into flats.) http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/101430/spires-house-shantalla\n\nBelow is Siobhán reading the Proclamation in 1966 in Eyre Square Galway during the 60 year commemorations of the Rising.\n\nttps://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1993-easter-1916/2769-events-of-easter-week-1966-in-colour/689084-1916-golden-jubilee-galway-ceremony/\n\nSiobhán became fluent in Connemara Irish and it was what the McKenna’s spoke at home. Her formal education states that it was at Dominican College, Taylor’s Hill, Galway, my alma mater. But she was only five when they moved and it was their Montessori junior school that she attended. Her schooling was interrupted by a year’s confinement to bed with glandular fever. She then enrolled at the boarding school of the St Louis Sisters at Monaghan, where she developed her love of drama.\n\nA video of Siobhán from 1961 talking about reading a poem at her Montessori School in Taylor’s Hill which was a short walk from where they lived and they laughing at her accent https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaofbbERyTw\n\nWhile still a university student, at UCG, Siobhán acted leading roles in An Taidhbhearc, Galway’s Irish-language theatre. (Walter Macken who went on to be one of Ireland’s well loved novelists was an acclaimed actor there and was its Director from 1939-47) Siobhán played in the Irish version of Evans and Valentine’s Tons of money ‘Dalladh airgid’ in March 1941, in Jean-Jacques Bernard’s Le National Six ‘Ar an mBóthar Mór’, and in her own translation of J. M. Barrie’s Mary Rose. She played in an Irish version of Eugene O’Neill’s The Emperor Jones and in two plays by Sean O’Casey, ‘Shadow of a Gunman’ and ‘The Plough and the Stars’.\n\nShe graduated BA from UCG with first-class honours in Irish, French, and mathematics in 1943, and enrolled at UCD for postgraduate studies in French. Ó Briain is credited with bringing McKenna’s talent to the notice of Ernest Blythe , managing director of the Abbey Theatre, who having auditioned McKenna offered her a contract. She began at the Abbey with Irish-speaking parts in Peadar Ó hAnnracháin’s ‘Stiana’ 1944, followe by ‘Sodar i ndiaidh na n-uasal’, Blythe’s translation of Molière’s Le bourgeois gentilhomme . She was noticed favourably for her playing of a Belfast factory girl in ‘The end House’ by Joseph Tomelty and her role as Jimín, a pert newsboy, in the Gaelic pantomime, ‘Muireann agus an prionnsa’ 1945/46, was acclaimed by the Evening Herald critic as ‘a performance of inexhaustible vitality’. 1946 was a decisive year in McKenna’s career and life.\n\nMcCormick, the great Abbey actor, tutored her when she played opposite him in ‘Village wooing’ by Shaw and when she received favourable notices for a small part in the British film Hungry Hill he advised her not to abandon her stage career for one in film. In September 1946 McKenna married the actor Denis O’Dea ; their only child, Donnacha, was born in August 1948. He went on to swim for Ireland at the 1968 Summer Olympics and later won a World Series of Poker bracelet in 1998 and I believe the poker bug has been caught by her grandson Eoghan who is an online player!\n\nShe first appeared on the London stage on March 1947 at the Embassy Theatre as Nora Fintry in ‘The white steed’ by P. V. Carroll. She played Maura Joyce in Sir Laurence Olivier’s production of Jean Anouilh’s ‘Fading mansions’ at the Duchess Theatre ; Olivier also advised her to remain in theatre work when she was offered a Hollywood contract for her memorable performance in the Paramount film ‘Daughter of Darkness’ 1948.\n\nIn response to a request from the Taidhbhearc, Siobhán offered to play the lead in her own translation of Shaw’s Saint Joan. It was a sensational success, it played to packed audiences first in Galway, in December 1950. http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/68048/siobh%C3%A1n-mckenna-a-legend-in-irish-theatre\n\nIt is interesting to note that the awful prig Bishop Browne declined an invitation writing that he “did not think that attendance at a Shaw play would be a suitable means or occasion for one in his position”.\n\nThere was one performance at the Gaiety in Dublin, 14 January 1951. Micheál MacLiammóir , who was in the audience, invited her to play Saint Joan in his production of the play, which opened at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, on November 1954 to great reviews. She also played the role in an English production in London in September 1954, at the Arts Theatre and then at the St Martin’s Theatre; she won the Evening Standard award for her acting. She played Saint Joan again in 1956–7 in Paris and then in New York, where with her unfamiliar accent endeared her to Broadway audiences. In 1956 she was the first Irish actor to win a Tony award.\n\nDuring the same years with Shelah Richards directing, created a new Pegeen Mike in ‘The playboy of the western world’ by J. M. Synge , first in 1951 at the Edinburgh Festival and then in July 1953 at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, with the actor–manager Cyril Cusack playing Christy Mahon, in what was deemed a superb production; it went on a European tour, and charmed Parisian audiences at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre. In 1960 Shelagh revived the play for the Dublin Theatre Festival and for the Florence Festival, where she was given the ‘best actress’ award. In 1961 Brian Desmond Hurst directed her in the film production of ‘The playboy of the Western World. It is interesting to have to explain the conceit of the play to a London Primary School assembly which I did in Latchmere School with my friend June O’Sullivan in the 80s when we did a series of them at the time when there was a lot of anti-Irish racism. There is a video about the filming in Dingle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOU0zlQR9y0\n\nFor international audiences Saint Joan is considered her outstanding role; in Irish theatre history she is best remembered for redefining the role of Pegeen Mike. She was a fine Shakesperian actor and spent a season a Stratford-on-Avon in 1952. She played a captivating Viola in ‘Twelfth night’, directed by Sir Tyrone Guthrie at the Stratford Festival in Ontario in1957, and a one-woman Hamlet in the manner of Sarah Bernhardt off Broadway in 1957, which critics panned; but her Lady Macbeth, opposite Jason Robards, at Harvard University in 1959 was of star quality, ‘putting in the greatest mad scene seen in the U.S. since Callas’s Lucia di Lamermoor’\n\nLoyalty to the Irish stage brought her back to Ireland, and in 1960 she made Dublin her permanent home: the family lived on Highfield Road, Rathgar When O’Dea’s health declined she moved to a smaller house at no. 78. From then on she steadfastly pursued the aims of an Irish National Theatre, in keeping with the vision that inspired the Abbey’s founders.\n\nThe establishment of Irish television in 1961 brought her into wider contact with the Irish public. Exile, emigration, and homecoming for the economically deprived were themes that interested both writers and their public. Siobhán engagement with the folk plays of Michael J. Molloy included financial backing, directing, and acting Daughter from over the Water, 1964 and gave her the impetus to direct and experiment. In 1966 she played Juno with Peter O’Toole and Jack MacGowran in‘Juno and the Paycock’ at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin. At the 1967 Dublin Festival, which coincided with the reopening of the Abbey Theatre, she gave a magnificent performance as the broken-down, earthy Cass in Brian Friel’s ‘The loves of Cass Maguire’. At the 1968 Dublin Festival at the Abbey she and Cyril Cusack starred in Chekhov’s ‘Cherry Orchard’, directed by Madame Knebal from the Moscow Art Theatre.\n\nFilms include 1961’s King of Kings, starring in the role of the Virgin Mary. In 1964 she performed in Of Human Bondage and the following year in Doctor Zhivago.\n\nFor more than a decade Siobhán had been considering a one-woman show on the lines of MacLiammóir’s ‘I must be talking to my friends’. When Wolf Mankowitz and Laurence Harvey put up the money for a West End production, with Sean Kenny as designer and director, Siobhán set about creating her show, choosing her pieces with consummate skill.\n\nHere are Ladies played in Britain, North America, Australia, Ireland, and Vienna throughout the 1970s. Her Molly Bloom and stream of consciousness Anna Livia Plurabelle passages from James Joyce were a tour de force that brought audiences to their feet. She gave sixty-seven public performances and as many more at university venues.\n\nTheater: Siobhan McKenna’s’Ladies’ – The New York Times\n\nDuring the 1970s McKenna directed fifteen plays, taking over O’Casey’s ‘Juno and the Paycock’ at the Mermaid Theatre in London in 1973 on the sudden death of Sean Kenny in Toronto she directed a season of Synge plays later that year.\n\nAlthough she concentrated on directing plays by O’Casey and Synge in the 1970s, she continued to act: she played Bessie Burgess in the Abbey’s golden jubilee production of ‘The Plough and the Stars’ in 1976, which toured New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington DC. Quest Productions presented ‘Here are ladies’ and, with McKenna directing, O’Casey’s ‘The shadow of a Gunman’ in Vienna 1980–81.\n\nSiobhán had been active in human rights. March 1982 she addressed the United Nations special committee against apartheid in New York by invitation; she revealed that she and Dame Peggy Ashcroft were among a group of actors, members of Actors’ Equity, who had signed a declaration not to perform in South Africa until there was an end to apartheid.\n\nShe formed a small company, Quest Productions, with John Hippisley as manager–director. She directed and played in Eugene O’Neill’s ‘A Moon for the Misbegotten’ at the Gate in 1975. In 1977 she played Sarah Bernhardt in ‘Memoir’ with Niall Buggy, in Eric Salmon’s production at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin, the Ambassador in London, and briefly in Canada. I remember speaking to Niall Buggy when he proudly showed me his Claddagh ring which Siobhán had given him.\n\nWhile Siobhán was directing a season of one-act Irish plays in London, Denis O’Dea died 5 November 1978.\n\nThe following year her own health began to fail but she continued her hectic programme, appearing as Juno in Joe Dowling’s production of ‘Juno and the paycock’ at the Abbey in 1979, Agrippina in ‘Britannicus’ at the Lyric, Hammersmith, London, in 1981, and in ‘All Joyce’ at the Abbey Theatre in 1982. In 1984, as well as directing and stage-managing Brian Merriman’s ‘Cuirt n mheán-oiche’, she played a luminous Mary Tyrone in Eugene O’Neill’s ‘Long day’s Journey into Night’ for the Abbey.\n\nThe following year she and Maureen Potter played the two old ladies in ‘Arsenic and old lace’ with verve at the Gaiety in Dublin.\n\nThough seriously ill, McKenna undertook the demanding role of Mommo in Tom Murphy’s ‘Bailegangaire’, which he had written with her in mind. Directed by Garry Hynes, who is another Notable Galway Women https://sheelanagigcomedienne.wordpress.com/2017/06/20/galway-women-part-2/ It played at the Druid Theatre in Galway from December 1985 through January 1986, transferring to the Donmar Warehouse in London for the spring of 1986, and to the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, for a two-week run. Murphy’s drama is set in a cottage in the west of Ireland where a senile grandmother, Mommo, strives to tell her two granddaughters a story which she cannot finish. The production was a rare conjunction of director, actors, staging, and play and Galway connections. McKenna’s contribution became a legend. I saw this memorable production at the Donmar Warehouse and loved the Schubert Notturno which accompanied it -an unforgettable production.\n\nOn 16 November 1986 Siobhán died of cardiac arrest after a lung operation in the Blackrock clinic in Dublin. She was buried at Rahoon cemetery in Galway. My mother attended it and wrote me a letter describing it on a rain drenched day with a lone piper playing. My parents Tom and Eithne Egan are both buried in Rahoon. Since then there is a stone by the entrance gate of Joyce’s poem She Weeps over Rahoon which of course refers to Nora Barnacle, his wife and another Notable Galway Woman. https://sheelanagigcomedienne.wordpress.com/2018/…/nora-barnacle-galway-woman/\n\nAt her graveside playwright Brian Friel declared: ‘For people of my generation, she personified an idea of Ireland.’https://www.nytimes.com/1986/…/siobhan-mckenna-is-dead-actress-known-for-st-joan.h…\n\nLa Times Obituary 1986 http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-18/news/mn-8027_1_siobhan-mckenna\n\nSiobhán McKenna was pre-eminent among the players who brought the dramatic works of the Irish literary revival to the national and international stage in the second half of the twentieth century. She was and is one of our best known actors of stage and screen and certainly one of Galway’s most Notable Women.\n\nDolores Keane is one of Ireland’s greatest singers and is undoubtedly a Notable Galway women. She is usually referred to as either a folk, traditional or Celtic singer. He voice is so distinctive, resonant and haunting with a definite Galway twang. She is dubbed the “Voice of Ireland” by Nanci Griffith. Dolores is known the world-over for her deep, melodic voice which often lives up to her name which means ‘sorrow’. She is a singer of the stature of Bessie Smith, Umm Kulthum and Aretha Franklin according to the Immortal Jukebox blogger https://theimmortaljukebox.com/2017/01/09/dolores-keane-\n\nHer Galway Bay is, for me, the definite Galway song\n\nthough I have a soft spot for the Tin Pan Alley Galway Bay as sung by Bing Crosby in 1966 and recorded in Dublin. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9NM3SMRtaQ\n\nHere is an earlier video of them talking about their musical heritage and singing ‘I am thinking, ever thinking’ http://euscreen.eu/item.html?id=EUS_DE5275FB22D64E91B1C49EEEE7CC3A86\n\nThey Keane family produced an album in 1985 which has been reissued.\n\nIn the sleeve notes, Dolores writes: ‘My earliest recollections of music and singing were when I was about three years of age. My grandmother’s house, where I spent much of my childhood, was often visited by many fine musicians and singers. Among them were Willie Clancy, Máirtín Byrnes, Seán ‘ac Dhonncha and many others from neighbouring villages. During the music sessions at the house, the ‘noble call’ operated among the gathered company and, even at the age of four or five, I was expected to do my bit. This encouraged me to learn songs and tunes.\n\nLike all my brothers and sisters, I was fortunate to grow up in an atmosphere where learning songs and tunes was like learning to read or to walk. I remember Ulick McDonnell, an elderly neighbour, visiting the house and swapping songs with my grandmother. I remember my Uncle Paddy playing his flute, while visiting travelling people danced a set in the kitchen and I remember Ciarán Mac Mathúna coming to record songs for his Ceolta Tire radio programme.\n\nIn 1975, she co-founded the very successful traditional Irish band De Danaan and they released their debut album Dé Danann in that same year. The group gained international recognition and enjoyed major success in the late 1970s in the US. Dolores went touring with the band and their single “The Rambling Irishman” was a big hit in Ireland. In early 1976, after a short two-year spell, she left left De Dannan.\n\nSoon thereafter, she married multi-instrumentalist John Faulkner musician John with whom she had worked on many occasions, in 1977 and with whom she would subsequently record three albums of folk music.\n\nDolores lived and worked in London for several years with John before they moved to Ireland in the early 1980s. They worked on a series of film scores and programmes for the BBC and formed two successful bands, The Reel Union and Kinvara. During this period Dolores recorded her first solo album, There Was a Maid in 1978. This was followed by two other releases, Broken Hearted I’ll Wander (1979) and Farewell to Eirinn (1980), which gave credit to Faulkner.\n\nIn the mid-1980s she rejoined De Danaan and recorded the albums Anthem and Ballroom with them.\n\nAfter a very difficult pregnancy, Dolores gave birth to their first child, Joseph. He was born with a condition Laurence -Moon Bardet-Biedl Syndrome which causes obesity and and failing leading to blindness.
