INTRODUCTION Every year has its contemporary events as well as anniversaries and commemorations of those long past - some of course much more significant than others. The smaller a geographical area of concentration, the fewer really memorable years there are likely to be. Wimbledon, a small part of London, surely has its limits. But occasionally a year arrives bringing so many important events and anniversaries that it demands special recognition of its own. The year 2012 was such a year for Britain as a whole. Staging the Olympics and Paralympics, celebrating the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, commemorating the sinking of the Titanic, the 200th birthday of Charles Dickens and so on. No-one can possibly have missed them all. However, for Wimbledon, the year had even greater resonance. Not only did each of these national events have special local significance, they also happened alongside a whole string of other notable anniversaries. Wimbledon’s local history is as rich and diverse as that of any town in the country. Originally its natural attractions as well as its proximity to London made it a favourite venue for settlement by the wealthy and powerful. The past two centuries have seen that popularity extend to a much wider segment of society as urbanisation transformed its identity and a small rural population grew into a large suburban residential one. In 2012 anniversaries came thick and fast of the births, deaths or significant activities of famous people linked with Wimbledon. Those concerned were associated 8\n\n9. with just about every imaginable field from the arts, sciences, archaeology, architecture, entertainment and sport to education, politics, health, warfare and even crime. In most cases they were figures of national or global reputation who happened to live in Wimbledon itself or have their final resting places beside the Common. Equally notable were anniversaries of developments or change - some gained for the area such as the first trains, trams, theatres and cinemas, others lost such as the old hospitals, schools or pubs. The flow of history means, of course, that such anniversaries will continue to be noted as long as civilization exists and in the case of Wimbledon, as long as it is a recognised entity within London. Many - but not all - of these events were captured by the Wimbledon Society for a weekly Heritage series in the online version of the Wimbledon Guardian newspaper. All of those that appeared in the first full year of this series are included in this book. It reads as it did when published on each occasion by the newspaper, using the present tense where relevant rather than a generic past as in a conventional history book. If you didn’t see each story then, you can do so now. I do hope you enjoy the experience. Tony Matthews, April 2013 9\n\n10. THE LAST HEADMASTER OF EAGLE HOUSE 21 October, 2011: The second oldest building in Wimbledon, the 400-year-old Eagle House, has been empty for two and half years and its future remains unknown. But the Wimbledon Society has just acquired a photograph of the last headmaster from the days when the building was a prestigious private school for boys. Dr Arthur Malan succeeded his father-in-law as headmaster in 1874. Said to have a “magnetic” influence on the pupils, he taught classics, mathematics, science, drawing and religion, coached them in cricket and foot- ball, and wrote stories for the popular journal, The Boy’s Own Paper, in his spare time. His picture will now be added to the extensive collection of the Museum of Wimbledon at 22 Ridgway which is run by the Wimbledon Society. In his day, the school prepared pupils for entry to Eton, Harrow and other top public schools. It had been known as Eagle House only since 1860 when an existing school of that name moved there. But it had been taking pupils since 1790 when a local parson and former schoolmaster, Thomas Lancaster, had bought the building. Originally known as Wimbledon School for Young Noblemen and Gentlemen, it had been renamed Nelson House School after a visit by Lord Nelson in 1805, shortly before the Battle of Trafalgar. In the 1840s it had become a Military Academy for future army officers heading for Sandhurst. Then in 1860, Dr Malan’s father-in-law, 10\n\n11. Dr Arthur Malan 11\n\n12. the Rev Edward Huntingford, had moved Eagle House School there from its former home in Hammersmith. In 1886, at the end of the summer term, Dr Malan announced the school was moving once more, this time from Wimbledon to Camberley. Although Eagle House School has continued to the present day elsewhere, the building in Wimbledon Village has never again been used for this purpose. It was saved from demolition after the school’s departure and restored as a family home by the architect Sir Thomas Jackson. After the Second World War it was used for offices and from 1988-2009 was an Islamic Heri- tage and Cultural Centre. Since that too moved else- where, Eagle House has been awaiting the next phase in its ever colourful history. 12\n\n13. WIMBLEDON’S LONG LINKS WITH DOLLS 28 October, 2011: There’s little evidence today in local toy shops but Wimbledon has longstanding links with dolls. Lucy Peck, one of the country’s top manufacturers of wax dolls in Victorian days, lived here and her great- grandson still does. Today he is proud owner of Rebecca and Lucy, among the last remaining dolls she produced. Each has flowing christening robes and real Titian hair. Lucy Peck was uniquely skilled in fashioning angelic dolls from wax moulds. From the 1890s until the 1920s she ran the Dolls Warehouse and then the Dolls’ Home shop in London’s West End. One of her best known creations was the Princess Victoria Doll, based on a picture of the young Queen by the artist Mary Gow, now in the Royal Collection at Windsor. The original doll is thought to be one now displayed at the National Trust’s Museum of Childhood in Derbyshire. Lucy’s notebooks containing the recipes for her wax models and her sculpting tools are in the Bethnal Green Museum of Childhood. As the popularity of wax dolls waned, replaced by bisque, she switched to making mannequins of real people - debutantes and titled ladies. She lived in Mansel Road, Wimbledon, and spent her final years in Kingston, attending Kingston Art College where she continued to sculpt and model in clay. But Wimbledon’s links with dolls continued. The Museum of London has one whose head was replaced at the Dolls Hospital and Pram Shop at 138-140 Merton Road. The owners Bailey and Bennett were described as “doll factors” and later as “baby carriage specialists” 13\n\n14. in the 1930s. A family bought the business from Miss Bailey in the early 1950s and continued running the shops as before but added more toys, renaming the place the Dolls Hospital and Toy Shop. This sold prams, pushchairs and wooden nursery furniture. It continued until the early 1960s when imported plastic dolls made in Hong Kong took over the market. With moving limbs, closing eyes and rooted hair, they were unbreakable and much cheaper than the breakable ones Lucy Peck had manufactured. Gradually the hospital work reduced and the business closed in 1969. But that was not entirely the end of the story. The digital doll, Lara Croft, star of computer games whose Tomb Raider adventures involve finding hidden relics, solving mind-numbing puzzles, scaling cliffs, jumping crevasses, and beating fearsome beasts, was created by the team at Eidos Interactive, based at Hartfield Road in Wimbledon town centre. She is said to have been born in Wimbledon and to have attended Wimbledon High School where she acquired her “authoritative, but sexy, cut-glass vowels”. 14\n\n15. 15 Rebecca and Lucy – two of the last remaining Victorian dolls made by Lucy Peck.\n\n16. WAS THE REAL ROBINSON CRUSOE FROM WIMBLEDON? 4 November, 2011: The classic tale of Robinson Crusoe, stranded for years on a desert island, is usually thought to have been inspired by the real life castaway Alexander Selkirk, who was similarly marooned in the Pacific during the 17th century. But now it seems the actual inspiration for author Daniel Defoe may have been a Wimbledon land- owner, one Robert Knox who was held captive for 19 years in what today is Sri Lanka. Knox, a resident of Wimbledon Village who also owned land in today’s Colliers Wood, finally escaped and wrote a best-selling book about his adventures entitled An Historical Relation Of The Island Ceylon, In The East-Indies: Together With An Account Of The Detaining In Captivity Of The Author And Divers Other Englishmen Now Living There, And Of The Author's Miraculous Escape. Some of his descriptions bear an uncanny resem- blance to Defoe’s story of Robinson Crusoe, published in 1719, and as Defoe would have read the book before writing his own, it may be more than a coincidence. Modern writer Katherine Frank will reveal all at Wimbledon Village Hall on Saturday, 12 November (2pm) when she gives a talk on her new book Crusoe: Daniel Defoe, Robert Knox and the Creation of a Myth. Her Richard Milward Memorial Lecture will mark the fifth anniversary of the death of the Wimbledon historian who first confirmed Robert Knox’s local links but with- out any reference to Crusoe. Knox (1642-1720) was a sea captain working for Britain’s East India Company. 16\n\n17. He was captured by Rajasingha, a Sinhalese despot, while visiting the country to repair his ship’s masts. In his book published in 1681, Knox wrote about leaving misleading footprints in the sand by walking backwards, also an important part of the Robinson Crusoe story. It was Defoe who made the first mention of Ceylon in English fiction. Katherine Frank spotted this when researching a biography on him and believes she has found the true origins of Robinson Crusoe after nearly 300 years. 17\n\n18. The Firs where the classic novel Tom Brown’s Schooldays was written in 1857. FAREWELL TO THE FIRS 11 November, 2011: After more than eight years of standing derelict, the staff accommodation blocks at the former Atkinson Morley’s Hospital in Copse Hill, West Wimbledon, were demolished last week to make way for new housing. The three blocks were known as The Firs and will be replaced by eight smart new houses as part of a much bigger re-development of the hospital site by Berkeley Homes which bought the 23 acres last year. Although The Firs were regarded as setting a national standard for residential provision when they went up in 1967 and increased the available accommodation for doctors, nurses and other staff, they had long become an eyesore and will not be missed. Ironically, that probably would not have been true 18\n\n19. had their predecessor on the same site still been there today. The hospital blocks took their name from The Firs, a single large house built in 1854 as an experiment in communal living for the families of two young barristers. The families kept open house and famous visitors in- cluded prolific authors Charles Kingsley (1819-75) who wrote The Water-Babies (1863), Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-65) who penned Cranford (1853) and The Life of Charlotte Bronte (1857), and Alexander Macmillan who founded one of Britain’s best known publishing companies. Moreover, one of the two barristers was himself the author Thomas Hughes (1822-96), who wrote Tom Brown’s Schooldays (1857) while living at The Firs. The book was inspired by his own son’s experiences at a public school. Sadly the boy, Maurice, died aged 11 and his parents left The Firs soon afterwards because of its tragic associations for them. Atkinson Morley’s Hospital bought the house in 1950 for £5000 and used it to accommodate junior medical staff until the blocks went up 17 years later. It was also used as a sports pavilion in the late 1950s and as an outpatient clinic. House is demolished in 1967 to make way for nurses’ flats. 19\n\n20. LOST FOREVER - THE PRICELESS CEILING OF LAURISTON HOUSE 18 November, 2011: A large new residence is going up on the site of one of Wimbledon’s most historic homes, Lauriston House off Southside, Wimbledon Common. When this was demolished in 1957, a priceless ceiling painted by the famous Swiss Neoclassical artist Angelica Kauffmann (1741-1807) was lost forever. The house had also been the home of the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce. Originally known as Laurel Grove, Lauriston House was built in 1724 for William Jackson. It was set in three acres and next to four cottages pre-dating 1684 which became the stable block. Jackson’s widow sold the house in 1752 to Wilberforce’s uncle. He commis- sioned Kauffman to paint magnificent murals for the main stairwell and in 1782 his famous nephew moved in to enjoy them. Wilberforce’s friend, William Pitt the Younger, was then Chancellor of the Exchequer and about to be- come Prime Minister. He became a regular visitor and he and Wilberforce became known for their drinking sessions there. One morning the flower beds were found to have been sown with fragments of a guest’s dress hat. Wilberforce left the house in 1786 and launched his long anti-slavery campaign the next year but Pitt continued to visit Wimbledon regularly as his Cabinet colleagues Richard Grenville and Henry Dundas also lived nearby in what later became Eagle House and Cannizaro House respectively. Laurel Grove was renamed Lauriston House in the 20\n\n21. Lauriston House in 1913 when known for its family concerts and parties. Priceless Angelica Kauffmann murals, commissioned by William Wilberforce’s uncle were still in place at the time. 21\n\n22. 1870s. It had many subsequent owners and at one point when it was run as a school for girls, the Kauffmann murals were covered up because of the nudity of some figures. In 1902, the house was bought by Sir Arthur Fell, a wealthy solicitor and international businessman who had earlier lived first in Worple Road and then Ridgway Place. As MP for Great Yarmouth from 1906- 21, he became an early campaigner for a Channel Tunnel. He was also a painter and Lauriston House was be- decked with his works. It became known too for musical parties where two orchestras performed classical and dance pieces. Fell died suddenly in 1934 while cashing a cheque at Barclays Bank in the Village. When his widow died 23 years later, Lauriston House was demolished and the garden sold for housing development. All that remain today are the adjacent Lauriston Cottage and the name Lauriston Road. Neoclassical artist Angelica Kauffmann (1741-1807) 22\n\n23. FROM THEBES TO WIMBLEDON COMMON – THE TALE OF HOWARD CARTER 25 November, 2011: Exactly 89 years ago this weekend, one of the world’s most famous archaeologists made a discovery that would inspire millions right up to the present day. Howard Carter himself now lies buried beside Wimbledon Common in Putney Vale Cemetery. But on 26 November 1922 after many years of searching on behalf of his private financier, the Earl of Carnarvon, he 23\n\n24. finally reached seals guarding the 3245-year-old tomb of King Tutankhamen of Egypt (pictured on Page 23). The young monarch had died aged around 18 and his burial chamber remained intact for thousands of years beneath the tomb of a later king. Beyond the seals, Carter found an antechamber leading to the burial chamber itself. It contained a huge quantity of gold and hundreds of antiquities – so many that it would take another decade to unearth and catalogue them all. Carter had originally suspected the existence of Tutankhamen’s tomb at the turn of the century when supervising excavations at Thebes in the Valley of the Kings on behalf of Egypt’s government antiquities department. Since 1914 he had been working for Lord Carnarvon but years of searching for the tomb had passed without success. Finally Carnarvon, having lost a great deal of money, suggested they give up but Carter persuaded him to hold out for one more season. On 4 November 1922 he found the entrance to a tomb but was not yet sure of the identity. He telegraphed Carnarvon to come at once as he dared not enter without his patron. On 26 November, with Carnarvon behind him, he breached the doorway and by candlelight saw the gold and ebony hoard with two statues guarding the entrance to the burial chamber itself. He had to await permission from the Egyptian authorities before entering but on 16 February 1923, he and Carnarvon opened the doorway and found the sarcophagus of Tutankhamen. There was worldwide press coverage and rumours arose of a curse on those who had disturbed the boy king. Lord Carnarvon’s untimely death and those 24\n\n25. of others reinforced them. Many books and films about the curse of the mummy’s tomb followed and for a while Carter gave illustrated lectures on his discoveries. Eventually he retired to an isolated life of failing health and collecting antiquities until dying of cancer in 1939. Carter’s own grave beside Wimbledon Common has no golden artefacts but the stone contains the inscription: “May your spirit live, May you spend millions of years, You who love Thebes, Sitting with your face to the north wind, Your eyes beholding happiness.” The golden sarcophagus of Tutankhamen remains one of the world’s greatest museum attractions.

MURRAY AND THE LIONS OF WIMBLEDON LODGE 2 December, 2011: Pet-owners using the Stone Lion veterinary surgery in High Street, Wimbledon Village will notice the two stone lions outside which give the practice its name. They have nothing to do with pets. They were acquired from the front of Wimbledon Lodge, a Greek Revival style mansion which stood on Southside, Wimbledon Common, from around 1792 until 1905. Its grounds ran right down to the Ridgway and also included a field further down the hill. The house was built for a French Huguenot’s son, Gerard de Visme, who died in 1797 and was buried at St Mary’s Church in the Village. The house was left to his daughter Emily and her husband, Major-General Sir Henry Murray (1784-1860), son of the Earl of Mans- field. He fought against Napoleon in Egypt and Spain and rode his horse, St Patrick, in a heroic cavalry charge at Waterloo in 1815. A drawing from 1806 shows the house had Egyptian sphinxes on the roof and a statue above the porch as well as the stone lions on each side. With his military career behind him, Sir Henry became a notable figure in local Wimbledon affairs and was active in the Vestry, the local authority of the day. He strongly opposed the banning of Wimbledon’s annual Easter fair in 1840, calling it one of the few festivals “the labouring classes have the opportunity of enjoying”. He and Emily had five children, including Arthur, a soldier son killed fighting the Boers in South Africa in 1848, and a daughter named Gertrude. After Sir Henry’s death, the family donated heavily to the new St John’s Church 26\n\n27. In 1806, the lions could be seen on plinths on each side of the porch. The lions were gone 99 years later when this picture was taken. Now they stand outside the veterinary surgery in Wimbledon Village. 27\n\n28. when it was built in the 1870s. Gertrude lived to the age of 90 and never left the house. She died in 1904 and it was pulled down and the grounds sold for development. Murray Road now covers the site but the original semi-circular drive which once led up to the entrance remains at the junction with Southside. The two stone lions somehow made their way to the veterinary practice where they used to stand immedi- ately outside the front door. When a new extension to the surgery opened in the 1990s at the rear, they were moved around the side and can now be seen in front of the present entrance. Two new lions replaced them outside the old front door on the High Street itself. In Sir Henry Murray’s day the British lion was frequently used to represent national pride. Best known were those in Trafalgar Square. Sir Henry Murray 28\n\n29. HUNDREDTH PANTOMIME OPENS AT WIMBLEDON THEATRE 9 December, 2011: When the stars of this year’s pantomime at Wimbledon Theatre walk on stage for the first time today, they will be the 100th cast to do so. Pantomimes have been performed every year bar two since the theatre opened its doors for the first time on Boxing Day 1910. Only the winters of 1941-2 and 2003-4 saw no performances as a result, respectively, of war and refurbishment. This year’s pantomime starring Barry Humphries as Dame Edna Everage will be the 12th time that Dick Whittington has been performed. Once more the legendary fortune seeker will be “turning again” towards his destiny as Mayor of London, accompanied of course by his cat. It is nine years since Whittington’s last appearance when comedian Russ Abbott headed the cast. The previous ten times before that began in 1932 with Patrick Colbert and continued every few years until 1997 when the cast included John Nettles and Lesley Joseph. Between those came an extraordinary assortment of Dick Whittington stars including Jon Pertwee in 1949, Adam Faith in 1960, Norman Vaughan and Jack Douglas in 1971, Jimmy Tarbuck in 1975, Eric Sykes and Roy Kinnear in 1981, and Les Dawson in 1991, appearing alongside John Nettles the first time round. Only two other pantomime favourites have outnum- bered Dick Whittington over the past century: an impressive 19 productions of Cinderella and 14 of Aladdin. Clearly, Wimbledon audiences have taken well to the Ugly Sisters and Widow Twanky. Today’s generation of pantomime 29\n\n30. An earlier production of Dick Whittington over 50 years ago. 30\n\n31. fans have even been treated to two productions each of these since the theatre reopened in 2004. They have also had two Peter Pan productions, although the perennial flying youth and his fairy accomplice have only ever appeared four times in Wimbledon, the first as recently as 1988 with Lulu. Jack and the Beanstalk has made it a more respectable eight times, the Babes in the Wood six times and Mother Goose five. Also-rans have included four Little Red Riding Hoods and two productions each of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Humpty Dumpty and Puss in Boots. By contrast, Robinson Crusoe has been a compara- tive favourite with six productions since 1913 and most recently in 1987 with Dennis Waterman and Rula Lenska. Whether the recent Wimbledon Society lecture which suggested a special link between Wimbledon and the fictional castaway will make any impact on planning of future productions remains to be seen. However it may be worth noting that earlier Crusoes included the Goon, Michael Bentine, in 1953. Ugly Sisters have appeared in no fewer than 19 productions of Cinderella. 31\n\n32. The Grove Hotel as it was known c 1910. THE LAST LINK WITH MERTON GROVE TO DISAPPEAR 16 December, 2011: Yet another local pub, The Grove, on the corner of Morden Road and Kingston Road at South Wimbledon, is currently under threat of closure. In recent times we have lost many of our local pubs and each time we do so we lose another little bit of local history. Already gone recently is the Emma Hamilton at Wimbledon Chase, recalling the time when she and Lord Nelson lived nearby until his death at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The Grove has been there since 1865 and was named after Merton Grove, the estate which stood on the opposite corner bounded by Merton Road, Kingston Road, Mon- tague Road and Pelham Road. This estate was owned by Sir Richard Hotham, the previous occupant of nearby Merton Place before Nelson’s 32\n\n33. time there with Lady Hamilton. Merton Grove was built in 1792 and had a large orchard, grapery, paddocks, coach house, stables and pleasure grounds. Sir Richard Hotham was a colourful character who was involved in local affairs, stood as an MP and was knighted by King George III in 1769. He was also responsible for turning Bognor from a small fishing village into what he hoped would be a fashionable resort, like Brighton, to attract dignitaries and royalty. He had originally wanted to call the town Hothampton. (Its official royal link had to wait until a 20th century visit by King George V after which it became known as Bognor Regis.) After Hotham’s death Merton Grove went through several hands before finally being demolished in 1896. Merton Place in 1803. It was Sir Richard Hotham’s residence before he moved to the neighbouring Merton Grove. 33\n\n34. When South Wimbledon tube station was built 30 years later in 1926, one of the names considered for it was Merton Grove. Curiously, “Merton” Grove was actually in what was then the borough of Wimbledon while what became South Wimbledon station was actually in Merton! The anomaly continued until the present Borough of Merton was created in 1965, merging Wimbledon with its neighbour. If the Grove pub is closed down the last remaining connection with what was once Merton Grove will be lost. True, there is a Hotham Road off Merton High Street which commemorates Sir Richard but there will be no remaining direct link with what was once described as “a rural spot with shady groves and views over fresh unbroken country.” Every time we lose a pub we lose much more than just a place to drink. FOOTNOTE: The Grove did close finally during 2012. 34\n\n35. A CENTURY OF CHRISTMAS GREETINGS 23 December, 2012: The season of goodwill is one of the few aspects of Wimbledon life that has remained basically the same for the past 100 years. Back in the early years of the 20th century, Wimbledon Village Club produced a sepia Christmas card showing the Village Hall entrance in Lingfield Road. It is shown above. Since 1916. the building has also hosted what was originally called the Wimbledon Museum of the John Evelyn Club. Today it is simply the Museum of Wimbledon with its entrance at 22 Ridgway. Run by Wimbledon Society volunteers, it opens free of charge every Saturday and Sunday. The Museum of Wimbledon produces Christmas cards every year, now of course in glorious colour rather than sepia. This year’s card depicts children playing in 35\n\n36. snow at West Place on Wimbledon Common, painted by local artist John Field. It is shown below. Christmas decorations too date back a long way in Wimbledon. But today’s electric lights have succeeded the bunting that bedecked the streets a century ago. The photo below shows the Christmas scene around 1908 when a carriage driven by Santa Claus and advertising Teddy Bears passed the old Wimbledon Town Hall. 36\n\n37. THE DAY HARRY LAUDER LEFT THE GLOAMING TO COME TO WIMBLEDON 30 December, 2011: As Hogmanay approaches once again, it is worth remembering the day 101 years ago when one of the country’s most famous Scotsmen, the music hall entertainer Harry Lauder, made a star appear- ance before a crowd in Wimbledon. The later Sir Harry Lauder (1870-1950) was then synonymous with the image of Scotland, singing songs like Roaming in the Gloaming and Keep Right on to the End of the Road before audiences in Britain and around the Empire. He performed before royalty and would stir patriotic hearts during both world wars. The Museum of Wimbledon recently received a photograph of the day in late 1910 when he appeared in the town. He was invited to the formal opening of the Wimbledon Hippodrome, a new cinema (known as an “electric theatre”) and skating rink opposite Ely’s store in Worple Road where the Bath Store stands today. Sir Harry Lauder at the height of his fame 37\n\n38. The cinema showed silent films, of course, and the skating rink was designed to meet a new craze at the time for roller skating. Lauder’s son happened to belong to a local hockey club so he was conveniently nearby to attend the opening. He told the Wimbledon crowd that he had personally resisted the lure of roller skates until his son had persuaded him to put on a pair in his billiard room. He had careered across the room, crashed into the fireplace, and never worn them again. After commenting on the presence of a large group of ladies, he sang a few lines of the song Goodbye Till We Meet Again and left to loud applause. His departure in his motor car was filmed and later shown at the cinema. But as it happened, despite the great man’s rousing launch, the Hippodrome did not prove successful. It had replaced a similar establishment on the same site called Wimbledon Olympia Ltd which had lasted less than a year before being wound up, owing £10,461 9s. 9d. The Hippodrome didn’t even make it that long. It closed after just five months. Local entrepreneur Alfred Hewitt Smith of 10 Home Park Road had achieved a triumph in getting Harry Lauder to open the place. It was his only success in a career of continued business failure which eventually saw him go bankrupt. 38\n\n39. Harry Lauder stands with his hands on his hips at the opening of the Wimbledon Hippodrome in December 1910. Also in this photo of the day are his wife and, standing on the right, local businessman Alfred Hewitt Smith whose only career success was arranging the star’s appearance on that day. 39\n\n40. William T. Stead, journalist, spiritualist, and victim of the last century’s most notorious tragedy at sea. J Bruce Ismay of the White Star Line survived the Titanic sinking and was never forgiven for it. 40\n\n41. THE WIMBLEDON JOURNALIST WHO SANK WITH THE TITANIC 6 January, 2012: Journalist W.T. Stead, one of the best known victims of the Titanic disaster exactly 100 years ago in April this year, was also one of Wimbledon’s most famous residents. William Thomas Stead (1849-1912) lived at Cambridge House, Wimbledon Park Road South (now part of Church Road). At 2.20am, 15 April 1912 he was on the world’s most famous ship as it sank into the North Atlantic after striking an iceberg. An ardent spiritualist as well as editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, he seems to have foretold the disaster. In 1886 he had written a story about the sinking of an ocean liner and how lives were lost because of an insufficient number of lifeboats. At the end he warned that this would really happen. Later, in December 1892 he had written another story entitled From the Old World to the New in the Review of Reviews in which a ship sank in the North Atlantic after striking an iceberg. The White Star liner Majestic saved some survivors and was commanded by Edward J. Smith. Twenty years later the same man really was captain of the White Star liner, Titanic. The Titanic disaster ended a career that had made Stead a household name many years earlier. Son of a Congegationalist minister, he wrote for the Northern Echo, Darlington, before coming south to The Pall Mall Gazette in 1880, becoming editor in 1883. He turned it into a “lively, amusing and newsy” populist campaigning 41\n\n42. newspaper. In 1884 he interviewed General Charles Gordon shortly before his notorious murder by Jihadists in the Sudan and in 1885 he launched a campaign to oppose child prostitution in London and raise the age of consent at the time from 12. Stead’s campaign put him in prison. To publicise the plight of child prostitutes, he arranged to buy a young virgin for £5 and then tell the tale. Helped by Rebecca Jarrett, a former prostitute, he convinced the mother of 13-year-old Eliza Armstrong that the girl would just go into domestic service. Eliza was taken to a house in Poland Street, chloroformed and taken away to Paris while Stead published a story said to “set London and the whole country in a blaze of indignation”. But while securing massive newspaper sales, he was widely criticised for publishing obscene material. The missing Eliza was eventually discovered in Stead’s Wimbledon garden and he was convicted of having fraudulently taken her from her parents. He spent three months in Holloway Prison (not then all-female) but his campaign was vindicated when the Criminal Law Amendment Act raised the age of consent from 12 to 16, banning procurement of minors. To mark the Act, Stead would henceforth travel by train from Wimbledon to Waterloo in his prison garb every 10 November. Stead’s remains now lie beneath the North Atlantic but the Titanic story has another permanent local link. Joseph Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line, was also on board and afterwards criticised for escaping in a life- boat while 1500 people drowned. His career was ruined but when he died on 17 October 1937, he was buried at Putney Vale cemetery, next to Wimbledon Common. 42\n\n43. Charles Dickens and his son, Henry Fielding Dickens, in youth. WIMBLEDON’S DICKENSIANS 13 January, 2012: Charles Dickens may never have lived in Wimbledon but he sent four of his seven sons to school here and a link remains to the present day. Britain’s greatest novelist, whose birth bicentenary falls next month on 7th February, selected Wimbledon School for his sons Walter, Alfred, Edward and Henry. When the first two arrived in the 1850s, the school was based at what was to become Eagle House in the Village but in 1860 it moved to specially built premises in Edge Hill which was where the younger two sons started. It had a reputation for training future military entrants to Sandhurst and Walter went on to a brief but successful army career in India before dying suddenly aged just 22. Neither Alfred nor Edward proved able to follow him 43\n\n44. into the military and both later sought new lives in Australia, but Henry was well regarded by the headmaster who recommended him for Cambridge. He went on to a long and highly distinguished career and is now buried beside the Common at Putney Vale Cemetery, along with his wife and one of his own sons. Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, the writer’s last surviving child, was born exactly 163 years ago this week on 16th January 1849. Charles and Catherine Dickens had ten children in all and Henry Fielding – named after one of the writer’s own favourite novelists - was their sixth son (Edward was the seventh). He lived to the age of 84 and died on 21 December 1933, two weeks after being hit by a motorcycle on Chelsea Embankment. He was brought up at Dickens’s home in Gad’s Hill, Kent, and was also educated at other schools in Rochester and Boulogne. At Wimbledon he did well and achieved the position of Head Censor. However, in view of his brothers’ records on admission to the army, his father planned to enter him for the Indian Civil Service instead until the headmaster recommended him for Cambridge University. He duly went on to Trinity Hall. There he thrilled the great novelist by winning the college’s best scholarship for mathematics. But sadly he was still at the university when Charles Dickens died in 1870 and never saw his father alive again. After graduating he switched to law, was called to the bar in 1873, appointed Queen’s Counsel in 1892, became a Bencher of the Inner Temple in 1899, and was a Recorder in Kent for some years before his appoint- ment as Common Sergeant of the City of London in 1917. In that post until his retirement in 1932, he 44\n\n45. presided over many criminal cases at the Old Bailey. He was knighted in 1922. Although he didn’t inherit his father’s genius as a writer, he was a great impressionist and started at a very young age, performing the role of Tom Thumb along- side his father and sisters at a school production when just four. In later life at family gatherings he would imitate his father’s famous reading performances, wearing a geranium in his buttonhole and leaning on the same velvet -covered reading stand the novelist had used on his tours. He celebrated his 80th birthday by reading the whole of A Christmas Carol perfectly. He also per- formed for charity, raising funds for the Red Cross and was Life President of the Dickens Fellowship. Sir Henry Fielding Dickens and his French wife Marie were married for 57 years and she joined him at Putney Vale when she died in 1940. They had seven children and one of their sons, Philip Charles Dickens, is also buried there. Sir Henry Fielding Dickens in later life as an Old Bailey judge. 45\n\n46. HILLSIDE WAS TRANSFORMED IN A FEW YEARS 20 January, 2012: New building developments are happening all the time these days and no-one alive now remembers when Wimbledon’s long hillside sloping down from the Ridgway to the railway line into London consisted entirely of market gardens and pasture for livestock. The fields had names such as Little Ladies Close and Cater Gutters. Yet the change to today’s residential slopes was made within a very short space of time. At the top of the hill, the Ridgway stretches from Wimbledon Village to Copse Hill while at the bottom, the railway line beside Worple Road links the town centre and Raynes Park. In the 1820s a few cottages were built in South Place behind today’s Thornton Hill and by 1855 a beer shop stood on the present site of The Swan pub in the Ridgway. But these apart, the entire hillside consisted largely of fields in 1858 when the first houses appeared at the top end of Ridgway Place and Hillside. Within a year or so, houses were built in Thornton Road, named after the wealthiest man in Britain and local landowner, Richard Thornton. By 1860, model cottages and other houses had arisen in South Road – later renamed Denmark Road - with more in what became St John’s Road. The Ridgway’s other shops appeared too during this period. It was the wedding of Edward, Prince of Wales, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark in 1863 that brought that country’s name to Wimbledon, remembered today 46\n\n47. Watercolours painted before the disappearance of rural Wimbledon. Shown above is the view from the top of Thornton Hill in 1873. Seen right is Worple Road at the bottom of the same hill a year later. It was a typical Surrey scene. by the Princess Alexandra pub in the town centre. Building began at that time on the lower part of the hill. It would give rise to Denmark Avenue and at the same time Thornton Road was extended to become Thornton Hill. St John’s Church was built in 1873-5 and its road widened. The first houses in Spencer Hill were built in 47\n\n48. 1879, as was Berkeley Place on land owned by one Edward Berkeley Philipps. In just a few years the rural atmosphere had gone. Not long afterwards virtually the entire hillside had been transformed into a suburban area but there were still a few patches of greenery left. Gertrude Murray of Wimbledon Lodge, beside the Common (see page 28), owned a nearby field which was developed into Murray Road South immediately after her death in 1904. As late as the 1920s the lower part of Ridgway Place was still a wildflower meadow but it eventually went under the bulldozer too. Finally, a century after it all started, Savona Close and Thackeray Close went up in the late 1960s, the latter named after the famous novelist whose daughter had lived in Berkeley Place. 48\n\n49.

WIMBLEDON SCHOOLBOY FOUNDED RECORD-BREAKING RADIO SHOW 27 January, 2012: Today marks the 70th anniversary of the world’s second longest running radio show, invented by a former pupil of King’s College School, Wimbledon. Exceeded only by the Grand Ole Opry in America, BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, brain-child of broadcaster Roy Plomley (1914-85), was first recorded on 27 January 1942 and aired two days later. Nearly 2900 programmes in the series have been heard since then, of which Plomley presented the first 1784 himself over 43 years. Roy Plomley lived with his parents in Trinity Road, Wimbledon. He left the area after his school days but the link remains to this day, as when he died he was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery beside Wimbledon Common. The son of a pharmacist, after King’s he worked for an estate agent, an advertising agency, a publisher and as an actor before joining a commercial radio station in France as an announcer in 1936. Escaping the Germans in 1940, he returned to Eng- land and in 1941 wrote to the BBC with the idea for a weekly programme in which a well known guest was asked which eight records they would like with them if cast away on a desert island. The first castaway ever was Vic Oliver, a Viennese comedian, actor and musician who also happened to be the son-in-law of Winston Churchill. His first choice was a piece by Chopin. Desert Island Discs proved an immediate success thanks to Plomley’s skill as an interviewer and meticulous 50\n\n51. research on each interviewee. A few months later he became the castaway himself for one show, interviewed by the head of popular pro- grammes. Eventually, each guest was also asked to choose one book and one luxury item for the island. However, as everyone asked for either the Bible or Shakespeare’s plays, these were assumed to be awaiting them on their arrival and another work had to be named. Over 43 years Plomley interviewees included among others 842 stage, screen or radio stars, 469 musicians, 367 writers, 117 sports champions, 75 art or fashion designers, 66 politicians or public servants, 60 academics, and four royals, including Princess Margaret and Princess Grace of Monaco. He continued to present the programme until his death in 1985. He was succeeded by Michael Parkinson. Sue Lawley took over in 1988 and Kirsty Young in 2006. 51\n\n52.

HISTORIC WATERCOLOURS LAUNCH NEW EXHIBITION GALLERY 3 February, 2012: Some 55 historic watercolours of Wimbledon, painted over two centuries between 1780 and 1985, will go on display in the first ever exhibition at the brand new Village Hall Trust Gallery, opening tomorrow Saturday, 4 February. The show, entitled Town and Country Wimbledon, is the first opportunity to see many of the works collected by the Museum of Wimbledon since its foundation 96 years ago in 1916. The paintings have been acquired through donations, bequests and works by new local artists. The new gallery provides an extension to the Museum itself at 22 Ridgway and entry to this exhibition is via the Museum’s Perry Room on weekend afternoons. The watercolours depict Wimbledon’s rural and urban heritage through works by local painters over 200 years. The earliest painting, by John Melchior Barralet, depicts St Mary’s Church c1780. It is the collection’s only contemporary drawing of the medieval church and was made shortly before its rebuilding in 1788. A tithe barn shown was dismantled in the 1860s to allow for an extension to the churchyard. Other very early works include Maria Marryat’s The Salon at Wimbledon House, Parkside, c1815 and John Chessell Buckler’s monochrome of Eagle House in 1827. Wimbledon House Parkside, which had one of the region’s finest gardens stretching over 100 acres, was demolished at the start of the 20th century but Eagle House, still standing in the High Street, is Wimbledon’s second oldest building, dating back to 1613. 53\n\n54. By contrast, other works in the exhibition include a rural Copse Hill as recently as 1931, Croft’s Timber Yard at West Place in 1910, and scenes from the annual National Rifle Association camp on the Common in the 1870s. Public art exhibitions in Wimbledon date back to 1876 when the Wimbledon Art & Benevolent Society staged its first charity fund-raising show of oils and water-colours in the Village Hall. This became an annual event and gradually diversified to include photographs, wood carving, sculpture, book binding and needlework. The Art & Benevolent Society changed its name in 1906 to the Wimbledon Arts and Crafts Society. In that year, Richardson Evans, then a recent founder of what later became the Wimbledon Society, appealed to local artists to lend pictures for an exhibition illustrating “Old and Picturesque Wimbledon” before it disappeared for- ever. Many of the pictures loaned became permanent and helped create a collection for the Museum after it was established at the Village Hall during the First World War. Future Museum of Wimbledon exhibitions in the new gallery will feature the hundreds of other images from the collection, which also includes photographs, topographical engravings, sketches, 19th century steel engravings and newsprint, original drawings and etchings. Town and Country Wimbledon runs until 25 April 2012. After that, until the next exhibition by the Museum it- self, the gallery will be used by local artists and schools with access via the Village Hall entrance in Lingfield Road. 54\n\n55. Atkinson Morley’s Convalescent Hospital opens in 1869. COPSE HILL LOSES ITS LAST HOSPITAL AFTER 140 YEARS 10 February, 2012: Next month’s closure of the 32-bed Wolfson Neurorehabilitation Centre will mark the end of 143 years of hospitals at Copse Hill, West Wimbledon. Not that long ago there were three of them - Atkinson Morley’s, Wimbledon Hospital, and the Wolfson itself. The first hospital building work started in 1867 on what had previously been part of the 300-acre estate of the late Lord Cottenham, Lord Chancellor. Two years later, Atkinson Morley's Convalescent Hospital took in its first patients for the recovery process following treat- ment at St George’s Hospital, Hyde Park Corner. It was 55\n\n56. named after Atkinson Morley, a governor of St George’s, who had bequeathed £150,000 specifically for construction of a peaceful convalescent home. The building in rural Wimbledon was the first purpose-built facility of its kind associated with an inner city hospital. The following year, 1870, saw opening of Wimbledon Cottage Hospital just across the lane from Atkinson Morley’s. Among its founders was the Chancery barrister, Edward Thurston Holland whose name lives on today through Thurston Road. It was rebuilt in 1912 and re- opened with 37 beds, simply named Wimbledon Hospital. For more than a century the two hospitals operated on each side of the road. A sixth of all St George’s patients from Hyde Park Corner convalesced at Atkinson Morley’s, with patients and laundry transported to Wimbledon at first in horse-drawn carriages and after 1888 in an omnibus. Wimbledon Hospital, on the other hand, was primarily for local patients, although both establishments were used by wounded servicemen during the First World War and Wimbledon Hospital in particular treated over 500 men, with marquees in the grounds complementing its capacity. Both hospitals were upgraded during the Second World War with much greater bed numbers and both had their own homes for staff on site. In 1942 Atkinson Morley’s original convalescent role was permanently changed when its surgical wards were taken over for neurosurgery, and after the war this became its primary role. It specialised in head injuries, attaining an interna- tional reputation for excellence. Wimbledon Hospital, meanwhile, joined the NHS in 1948 with 84 beds under the control of the South-West 56\n\n57. Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In 1949 departments of psychiatry and neuroradiology were established at Atkinson Morley’s Hospital and by 1954 it had 44 neurosurgical beds, 16 neurological and 50 psychiatric, with 14 beds available for continuity and recovery. Then, in 1967, exactly 100 years after the first building work on site, the Wolfson Neurorehabilitation Centre opened next door as Britain’s first facility dedicated to neurological recovery. It provided rehabilitation for patients needing intensive therapy for physical or psy- chological disabilities following brain or spinal cord injuries. But only 14 years later Copse Hill’s association with hospitals suffered its first hit. In 1981 it was decided to close Wimbledon Hospital and move its services else- where. This finally happened in 1983 when services moved to the Nelson at Merton Park and the hospital was demolished the following year to be replaced by a housing estate. Nearly 20 years later in 2003, Atkinson Morley’s also closed and its services were transferred to St George’s Hospital, now in Tooting since being moved from Hyde Park Corner in 1980. Closure of the Wolfson in March 2012 will set the final seal for Copse Hill as its beds are also moved, first to St George’s in Tooting and later to Queen Mary’s at Roehampton. Some 147 patients had been treated in the last year when the closure announcement was made public. More new housing is expected to replace it.

OLIVER REED – WIMBLEDON’S WILDEST REBEL 17 February 2012: The Wimbledon-born screen actor Oliver Reed would have celebrated his 74th birthday this week on Monday, 13 February. As it was, after appearing in well over 60 films, he died suddenly on 2 May 1999 while making his last one, Gladiator. It was completed without him - using special effects. Reed’s whole life was a special effect. Born at No 9 Durrington Park Road, near Raynes Park, his family background was spectacular. He was a grandson of the famous Victorian actor-producer Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree by his mistress Beatrice May Pinney. She changed her name to Reed because she felt she was “a broken reed at the foot of the mighty Tree”. In later life she lived at 12 Lingfield Road, Wimbledon Village, and two of her illegitimate children were Oliver Reed’s father, Peter, a well known sports journalist, and the film director Sir Carol Reed. After being expelled from 13 other schools, Oliver Reed succeeded in becoming captain of athletics and junior cross-country champion at Ewell Castle School. He left age 17 and worked as a strip club bouncer, fair- ground boxer and mortuary attendant before National Service where he was rejected for an officer’s commis- sion while serving in the Army Medical Corps. Afterwards he drifted into acting as a film extra in 1958. Carol Reed offered him a small part and advised him to enrol at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but he refused to work for his uncle before achieving star status. He rejected RADA too - curious perhaps, as his 59\n\n60. grandfather had been its founder in 1904. In 1959, Oliver Reed married his first wife, Katie. He lived in various Wimbledon flats in Marryat Road, Woodside, Homefield Road and Arterberry Road but by the late 1960s had become one of Britain's highest paid actors and moved into a large house in Ellerton Road, off Copse Hill. He became a keen horse-rider on the Common and the lounge was said to resemble that of a country squire with military and hunting prints, a gun collection, and of course a well stocked bar. He was also well known at the Hand in Hand pub and developed a reputation for drinking with companions on a monu- mental scale as well as chasing women. Not surprisingly he and Katie were divorced in 1969. He had already appeared in several Hammer horror films and many other pictures before playing Bill Sykes in the musical Oliver in 1968 which made him an inter- national star. In 1971 he left Wimbledon for good, moving to a gigantic house in Dorking. He became even more of a household name by starring in several of director Ken Russell’s most controversial films including Women in Love, The Devils and Tommy. From then on his career was always associated with an off-screen lifestyle as wild as that of anyone in show business. He was 61 when – fittingly enough – his last role was in a film about fighting. The night before he suffered a fatal heart attack he was drinking heavily as usual and arm wrestling five sailors. Russell Crowe was the star of the film but Gladiator was dedicated to Reed. He was posthumously nominated for two screen awards. 60\n\n61. Lionel Tertis THE WORLD FAMOUS VIOLA PLAYER OF MARRYAT ROAD 24 February, 2012: This week marked the 37th anniversary of the death of Lionel Tertis of Marryat Road, Wimbledon, said to have been the greatest viola player of the 20th century. Tertis, who died age 98, is commemorated by the triennial Lionel Tertis International Viola Festival & Competition, known throughout the musical world and involving young players of any nationality aged under 30. Participants from more than 30 countries took part last time and the next one, the 11th, will be 61\n\n62. held at the Erin Arts Centre on the Isle of Man from 16-23 March 2013. Lionel Tertis was born in 1876 in West Hartlepool. By the time that he and his professional cellist wife Lillian moved into Flat One at 42 Marryat Road in 1961, he had been playing the viola for around 66 years. He continued to perform in public until 1963 and then gave private recitals in the garden. Tertis is said to have revolutionised the viola as a solo instrument. Although he studied piano at Trinity College, London, before switching to the violin at Leipzig Conservatoire, he took up the viola at the age of 19 to play in a string quartet. In 1901 he became Professor of viola at the Royal Academy of Music and was later director of the ensemble class there from 1924-29, teaching many distinguished players. As well as playing with various orchestras and string quartets and touring Europe and the US as a soloist, Tertis arranged and edited many works for the viola, including the Elgar Cello Concerto, Delius violin sonatas and Brahms clarinet sonatas. He composed some works himself and may have influenced William Walton in the writing of his own viola concerto. Tertis attracted the attention of many other great composers including Vaughan-Williams, Britten, Bartók, and Shostakovich. He gave first performances of many works for the viola that had been written especially for him and he was awarded the CBE in 1950. Back in 1924 he had bought a 1727 vintage Montagnana instrument from a Paris dealer although it was said to be in an unplayable condition, without a bridge, strings, fingerboard or case. It was also very big 62\n\n63. and it was only possible to bring it back to London by his then wife wrapping it in her waterproof coat to get it across the English Channel. The large viola provided an especially rich tone and Tertis went on to create his own model instrument to achieve the tonal advantages he sought. The large house at 42 Marryat Road, Wimbledon, had been converted into three flats in 1953, and Tertis, Lillian, and her elderly mother moved into one of them when he was already in his mid eighties. After his death on 22 February 1975, Lillian, who was much younger, remained at the flat alone until 2005 when she moved into a nursing home in Kingston, dying there in 2009 aged 94. The Lionel Tertis International Viola Festival & Competition was founded in 1980, five years after the performer’s death and in February 2007 the violist Roger Chase initiated The Tertis Project, a series of concerts of works that had been composed for him. Chase performs on the same vintage instrument that Lionel and his wife brought from Paris in 1924. 63\n\n64. Frances, Count St Antonio, later Duke of Cannizzaro, (centre profile) with a dance partner COLOURFUL STORY OF CANNIZARO GETS ANOTHER HEARING 2 March, 2012: The controversies and scandals that beset Cannizaro House during its first two centuries will feature in this week’s free Wimbledon Society illustrated lecture at the Mansel Road Centre (Saturday 7 March, starting 8.15pm) when writer Tony Matthews will talk about the subject of his book Cannizaro Beyond the Gates. Known originally as Warren House, it was the country home of many rich, high profile figures with interests in the City and politics. William Browne, the merchant who built it around 1705, was sued for defaming the local vicar and excommunicated from the church. His successor, Thomas Walker, was said to be a notorious usurer who used political links with Prime Minister Robert Walpole and others to amass a vast fortune. Lyde Browne, director of the Bank of England, established a huge collection of 64\n\n65. classical sculptures at the house but was cheated of half the value when he sold it to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia whose agent went bust. Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville, was a senior government minister under William Pitt and the place became known for their lengthy drinking sessions. (See Page 20). Dundas won plaudits from King George III during royal visits to Wimbledon but he later became embroiled in a corruption scandal which destroyed his career. His private life was disastrous too. But most scandalous of all were the Duke and Duchess of Cannizzaro whose residence there between 1817 and 1841 was marked by many years of critical and satirical press coverage of their various infidelities and financial peccadilloes. Both had scandal-ridden backgrounds but were constantly in the public eye as they mixed in the highest echelons of society. Even though they separated in 1826, she continued to bankroll him until her death in 1841 when he casually returned to claim her fortune, sold her treasured library, and died himself shortly afterwards. Subsequent residents of Cannizaro House included the highly controversial Maharajah Duleep Singh, just deposed as ruler of the Punjab, and later Mrs Mary Schuster, whose massive garden parties and musical soirees were famed for including royalty and literary giants such as Lord Tennyson and Oscar Wilde among the guests. The last of the great controversies happened in 1900 when Cannizaro House was largely destroyed by fire because an inadequate water supply hampered efforts by the fire brigade to put the flames out quickly. The damage was catastrophic but it heralded a new era 20 65\n\n66. years later when the rebuilt house would become famous for its magnificent gardens, the forerunner of today’s Cannizaro Park. FOOTNOTE: The last private owner of the estate, the Countess of Munster, sold it to Wimbledon Corporation in 1948 and the park opened in 1949. Unlike the 18th and 19th centuries, Cannizaro has seen no significant scandals in the 20th and 21st centuries. Sophia, Duchess of Cannizzaro 66\n\n67.

WIMBLEDON’S MOST SUCCESSFUL PUBLISHING FAMILY 9 March, 2012: Exactly 200 years ago tomorrow on 10 March 1812, Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, the book that made poet Lord Byron a household name, was pub- lished by John Murray II (1778-1843), second head of the publishing family that began in the 18th century and continued right into the 21st. The book sold out in just five days and Murray, whose family was probably the most successful in publishing ever to live in Wimbledon, had as much reason to celebrate as the poet himself. 67\n\n68. The firm’s list of published writers since then is dazzling. Byron’s contemporaries included novelists Sir Walter Scott and Jane Austen. In time they were followed by Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species, David Livingstone’s Missionary Travels, the letters of Queen Victoria, William Gladstone’s most famous book on the church and the state, Murray’s Handbook for Travellers (first of all modern travel guides), the travel writings of Freya Stark and Patrick Leigh Fermor, the poems of Sir John Betjeman, the cartoons of Osbert Lancaster, and jointly with the BBC, Kenneth Clark’s Civilization. Although the John Murray firm has always been associated with its headquarters at 50 Albemarle Street, Mayfair, members of the family lived in Wimbledon on and off for around a century, from the days when John Murray II was working with Byron until after the First World War. John Murray II had “a little cottage” in Wimbledon at the time he published Lord Byron’s controversial poem on Don Juan in 1819. It appeared without their names but still attracted a mob outside Albemarle Street protesting about its “bawdy” contents. Lady Caroline Lamb, a passionate fan of Byron, wrote to Murray asking to meet him at the cottage, which was serving as his bolthole from the London crowd. Byron himself was away in Italy at the time. Murray’s son, John Murray III (1808–1892), bought four acres of land off Parkside and built a villa at Somerset Road on the brow of a hill with a lake. He called it Newstead after Lord Byron’s seat, Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire. The house became a mansion with around 20 bedrooms. Every day, John 68\n\n69. Newstead in the 1890s. Murray III would walk the mile and a half down to Wimbledon Station and could be seen correcting proofs on the train into central London. When he died in 1892 he was buried in the family tomb at St Mary’s Church in Wimbledon Village. Within a year, Sir John Murray IV (1851–1928) moved back to Albemarle Street with his wife and son - later Sir John Murray V (1884–1967). However, his brother, Alexander Henry Hallam Murray (1854-1934), a designer and illustrator for the family firm until 1908, stayed at Newstead until selling it after 1918. The firm continued under successive John Murrays until John Murray VII sold it in 2002. The family archive from 1768 to 1920 was sold to the National Library of Scotland. 69\n\n70. THE WIMBLEDON RADICAL WHO RIVALLED DR JOHNSON 16 March, 2012: One of the 18 th century’s most controversial radical politicians died at his home beside Wimbledon Common exactly 200 years ago this weekend. John Horne Tooke (1736-1812) retired to Chester House on Westside Common towards the end of an un- conventional career which included being imprisoned in the Tower of London, antagonizing both sides in Parliament, libelling the Speaker, and successfully campaigning for the public right to see printed accounts of Parliamentary debates. He was also a noted philologist and is said to have rivalled Dr Samuel Johnson in his conversational and writing powers. His sayings were published after his death. Born simply John Horne on 25 June 1736 in Westminster, he was the son of a poultry merchant who insisted that he become a clergyman. Reluctantly he did so and retained an income from the Church until 1773 when he formally resigned. However, for years before that, he was involved in radical politics, supporting the notorious demagogue John Wilkes and getting him elected to Parliament. In 1769, Horne and Wilkes founded The Society for Supporting the Bill of Rights but the two rowed and the membership split into opposing camps in 1771. In the same year Horne obtained a Masters degree at Cambridge and successfully achieved the publication of Parliamentary debates as a matter of public right. 70\n\n71. Chester House is seen above c1810 when John Horne Tooke lived there. The man himself is shown right. 71\n\n72. After switching from the Church to study law and philology, he became embroiled in a controversy over land ownership between a friend, William Tooke, and a neighbour. Following many disputes, the neighbour’s friends in Parliament tried to force through a Bill that would enhance his interests at Tooke’s expense. Horne drew public attention to the case by libelling the Speaker of the House and although he was taken into custody by the sergeant-at-arms, the clauses harmful to Tooke were dropped. Tooke was so grateful he made Horne the heir to his fortune. In return, Horne added “Tooke” to his name in 1782. In 1777 he was jailed for a year for soliciting sub- scriptions in support of Americans killed by British forces during the American War of Independence. Afterwards rejected by the Bar, he tried farming and wrote political treatises demanding reform. He was an unsuccessful Parlia- mentary candidate twice in the 1790s and was arrested for treason in 1794 for opposing the clampdown on dissent in England during the French Revolution. Imprisoned in the Tower for some months he was then acquitted. Ironically for a radical reformer, he eventually secured a Parliamentary seat in 1801 by being returned for the pocket borough of Old Sarum rather than being elected by a large number of voters. Even then his career in the House was truncated after his opponents introduced a Bill banning anyone in religious orders from sitting in the Commons. His previous role as a clergyman, although long over, was held as a reason for his exclusion. At home in Wimbledon he hosted Sunday parties for politicians and men of letters which were known for their witty discussions. He suffered serious illness from 72\n\n73.

However this was rejected after his death on 18 March 1812 and he was interred instead alongside his mother in Ealing. 73\n\n74. FROM LONDON’S SEWERS TO THE FRESH AIR OF WIMBLEDON 23 March 2012: Sir Joseph William Bazalgette (1819- 1891), the man who created London’s sewerage system as well as the Thames Embankment and three major London Bridges, died at his Wimbledon home 121 years ago last week. Only today, some 150 years after his sewers came into use, is Thames Water having to plan a major up- grade to meet modern demands. It is a mark of just how much Londoners owe this 19th century engineering giant. Bazalgette came to Wimbledon in 1873 with his wife and ten children, moving into St Mary’s House, Arthur Road. They had previously lived for a time in what was then the Surrey countryside at Morden. Before that their home was in St John’s Wood. A former railway specialist, Bazalgette served as Chief Engineer on London’s Metropolitan Board of Works from 1856 until 1889. In the preceding years thousands of Londoners had died of cholera epidemics caused by contaminated water. As all drains emptied their contents into the Thames and the streets sometimes flowed with raw sewage, it is easy to understand why. However at the time, bad air rather than contaminated water was blamed for the disease. By 1858 the river had become so badly polluted that air conditions were unbearable and a Parliamentary select committee was appointed to seek a solution. Bazalgette proposed the construction of hundreds of miles of underground brick sewers to intercept sewage outflows and keep it from the streets. By improving the 74\n\n75.

He secured the funds to go ahead and as well as building the tunnels, the scheme involved major pumping stations at certain points on both sides of the Thames. The system was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1865 but work continued for another decade as further pumping stations were added. Between 1865 and 1870, Bazalgette also directed the construction of Victoria Embankment. This was prompted both by the new sewerage system and the need to relieve traffic congestion in Fleet Street and The Strand. It involved building out on to the river foreshore with a cut and cover tunnel for what is now the District Line, and roofing this over for the new roadway. Once the work was done, two public gardens were laid out, giving a welcome green space between the government buildings of Whitehall and the river. From his Wimbledon home, Bazalgette was knighted for his efforts in 1875 and elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1883. His historic contributions to London continued with designs for new bridges across the Thames which opened at Putney in 1886 and Hammersmith in 1887. He also went on to design Battersea Bridge which formally opened in 1890. Bazalgette’s son Norman played a major role in Wimbledon’s own history, campaigning for the first free public library from 1880 onwards until it finally opened at the bottom of Wimbledon Hill Road in 1887. When Sir Joseph himself died five years later he was buried in a family mausoleum at the parish church opposite their house. A century later this was decaying badly and the Wimbledon Society raised funds towards its restoration. 76\n\n77. Memorial to Sir Joseph William Bazalgette on Victoria Embankment.

WIMBLEDON’S FIRST GARDEN CENTRE 30 March, 2012: Wimbledon gardeners have to travel slightly further nowadays to stock up for spring and summer planting but their Victorian forebears could simply shop at Thomson’s Nurseries at the bottom of Wimbledon Hill Road, formerly the Lord of the Manor’s kitchen garden. Scotsman David Thomson (1816-1905) worked as a gardener for Lord of the Manor Earl Spencer from 1838 until the Wimbledon Park estate was sold off in 1846. Much local freehold land belonged to the Church Commissioners but in 1852 Thomson leased some 12 acres between what is now St Mark’s Place and Wood- side, and established a nursery and landscape gardening business to serve the growing number of fine houses being built on the Earl’s former estate and nearby. He soon secured an excellent reputation for integrity and professionalism and by 1871 was employing 12 people. Thomson himself lived with his wife and six children opposite the end of Hothouse Lane (later St Mary’s Road). The nursery entrance was through a conservatory containing palm trees and seasonal flowers. There were 30 greenhouses with geraniums, begonias, imported Japanese aspidistras, vast numbers of chrysanthemums and hundreds of climbing roses in pots. Outdoors were many other plants and trees. However the 30-year-lease ran out in the early 1880s and the Church Commissioners sold part of the land for further development, including what would become the 78\n\n79. Thomson’s Nurseries shown above in 1907. On the right, David Thomson. town’s first free public library in 1887. Thomson retained only his shop and land imme- diately below Woodside for the greenhouses. As a result he bought the freehold of an additional 50 acres of land south of the rail- way, west of Merton Hall Road and established a second base, the Branch Nursery. There he stocked a further huge range of trees, shrubs and hardy perennials. A gardening publication describing the Branch Nursery later listed phlox, iris, lobelia, Michaelmas daisies, alpines, masses of strawberries, roses producing 18,000 buds a year, apple trees, plums, pears, cherries, peaches, hollies, sycamores, planes, elms, birch and mountain ash and limes. 79\n\n80. David Thomson remained active in his nurseries right up to the age of 87 and died after a short illness at his home in 1905. The rest of the original nursery at Wimbledon Hill Road was sold in 1894 and Worcester and Compton Roads were built on the site. By 1929 houses extended all along Woodside and only a flower shop remained on the corner of Alwyne Road. Thomson’s sons continued in the business at the Branch Nursery but this too was compulsorily purchased by the council for housing in 1920 and the Toynbee Road area constructed.

MUSIC HALL SINGING STAR HETTY KING LIVED IN WIMBLEDON 6 April, 2012: On 8 November 2010, the Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America erected a com- memorative blue plaque at No 17 Palmerston Road, Wimbledon. It was the last home of old time singer and actress Hetty King (1883-1972) who lived there from the 1950s with her sister Olive Edwards. Hetty, whose 129th birthday fell this Wednesday, was one of Britain’s most successful male impersonators, starting her career in music hall in 1897. She topped bills all over the world dressed in men’s costumes including top hat and tails and military uniforms, the last especially during the two world wars. Known particularly for her renditions and recordings of All the Nice Girls Love a Sailor, Tell Me the Old, Old Story, and Piccadilly, she was a favourite for principal boy roles in pantomimes but continued working in variety and summer shows right into very old age in a career that lasted for more than 70 years. Born Winifred Emms King in New Brighton, Cheshire, she was the daughter of William Emms (1856–1954), a well known music hall comedian who had adopted the stage name King. Always known professionally as Hetty King, she first appeared on stage with him when only six years old and performed at seaside shows alongside minstrels. She adopted the debonair man- about-town role for the first time in 1905, quickly achieving fame and star bookings. During the First World War she would perform Songs the Soldiers Sing, a sanitized version of those 81\n\n82. Sheet music cover from 1907 shown right. Hetty King appears below in uniform. from the trenches, and was back with similar renditions in the Second World War. In 1954 she appeared in the film Lilacs In The Spring with Errol Flynn and Anna Neagle. In later life she toured with the show Thanks for the Memory and finally appeared in a film entitled Hetty King – Performer aged 87. She married actor and writer Ernie Lotinga (1876– 1951), another music hall comedian, singer and theatre proprietor who also appeared in films in the 1920s and 30s, often as the comic character PC Jimmy Josser. However her real married name was Winifred Lamond. Her sister and fellow Wimbledonian, Olive, was also an actress and her brother Harold wrote many of her songs with his wife. Hetty died on 28 September 1972 aged 89 and was cremated at Golders Green. 82\n\n83. WIMBLEDON’S WORST VANDALISM 13 April 2012: Perhaps the worst vandalism ever inflicted on Wimbledon outside wartime happened exactly 137 years ago. The culprits were a builder called Dixon and a Member of Parliament, the local land- owner John Samuel Sawbridge-Erle-Drax. In April 1875, with Drax’s support, Dixon destroyed the prehistoric Iron Age fort on Wimbledon Common dating back to 700 BC or earlier. Known today as Caesar’s Camp, the fort had included circular ramparts nearly 20 feet high, topped with mature oak trees and surrounded by a 12 feet deep, 30 feet wide ditch, enclosing some 12 acres of relatively flat land with a view of Epsom Downs. Its archaeological significance was incalculable, its precise origins unknown to this day. Drax, who became owner of land stretching from Beverley Brook to Westside Common through his wife’s inheritance, leased some fields to Dixon who then built three large houses in Camp Road and moved on to the area of the fort itself. Bricks and scaffolding for more houses arrived on site, the trees were felled, the ramparts leveled and the ditch filled. Drax could have saved the fort by selling the land to the campaigners who had successfully achieved Parlia- mentary protection of Wimbledon Common four years earlier. However he hated being thwarted and refused to sell. Although the Commons Conservators stopped any further action by securing a court order forbidding use of Camp Road for anything other than agricultural purposes, it was too late to save the fort. Since 1907 it has simply served as part of the Royal 83\n\n84. Wimbledon Golf Course. Only from the air could the original circular shape of the fort still be made out, barely possible today. The name Caesar’s Camp was adopted in the 1820s on the assumption that Julius Caesar might have built the fort after invading Britain. However, there was never any evidence for this and the structure had actually been known locally for centuries as The Rounds. It was not until 1937 that its possible age was discovered when the Metropolitan Water Board decided to build a new main across the site and allowed archaeologists to watch as a trench was dug. Although restricted, they were able to assess the age and possible purpose of the site in more detail than ever before. The fort had once had a palisade to defend occupants against attack. Unearthed pottery suggested a date of 250 BC. But further studies have since concluded that it was much older and possibly a trading base. Either way, the sad remains are now a protected ancient monument. Vandal and landowner, John Samuel Sawbridge- Erle-Drax (1800-1887). 84\n\n85.

THE TRIUMPH AND TRAGEDY OF WIMBLEDON’S OWN SANDY DENNY 20 April 2012: Sandy Denny (1947-78), the Wimbledon songstress who became Britain’s most pre-eminent folk/ rock singer-songwriter in the 1970s, died exactly 34 years ago tomorrow, aged just 31. Born Alexandra Elene Maclean Denny on 6 January 1947 at the Nelson Hospital, Merton Park, she performed with The Strawbs, Fairport Convention, Fotheringay and even Led Zeppelin before becoming a soloist from 1971-77 when she released four albums. Trained as a classical pianist, Sandy Denny started singing as a child. A pupil at Coombe Girls School in Kingston, she trained afterwards as a nurse at the Royal Brompton Hospital before taking up a place in 1965 at what was then Kingston College of Art, joining the campus folk club, and beginning a singing career on London’s folk club circuit. Her repertoire included both traditional British and American songs. She first performed at Cecil Sharp House, home of traditional folk music, in December 1966 for a BBC programme. A few months later she signed with Saga Records and dropped her art studies in favour of a full- time musical career. At the well known Troubadour Club she met a member of The Strawbs and soon joined the band but the following year became lead singer with Fairport Convention, encouraging them to combine traditional folk music with electric rock. She left in 1969 to develop her own songwriting career and formed the band, Fotheringay. Having re- turned to the piano as her main instrument, in both 1970 86\n\n87.

In 1973 she married her boyfriend and producer and recorded a third solo album. Despite her huge success, her songs now stressed sad private preoccupations, possibly due to problems with drink and drugs. Nevertheless, between 1974 and 1975 they performed together with Fairport Convention and enjoyed a highly successful world tour. In 1977 she recorded her last album and embarked on a final UK tour, ending 27 November at London’s Royalty Theatre. That year she also gave birth to a daughter, her only child. Then, tragically, while on holiday with her parents and baby in Cornwall in March 1978, she suffered a head injury in a fall from a staircase. She recovered briefly but on 17 April collapsed at a friend's home and died four days later in Atkinson Morley’s Hospital at Copse Hill (see Page 57). She was buried on 27 April at Putney Vale Cemetery beside Wimbledon Common. Her headstone describes her as “The Lady” and when the second of two tribute concerts was held in 2008 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank, to mark the 30th anniversary of her death, it was entitled The Lady: A Tribute to Sandy Denny. There have been many musical tributes to her over the years with members of both The Strawbs and Fairport Convention recording songs in her memory and many other artists performing her own songs including Judy Collins, Kate Bush and the late Nina Simone. The picture with her parents on Page 87 appeared on the album cover of Fairport Convention's LP Unhalfbricking. 88\n\n89. Sandy is shown above, relaxing with other members of Fairport Convention in her parents’ Wimbledon garden. The title arose from the word-game Ghosts, played by the band while travelling to and from concerts. Its ob- ject was to avoid completing a real word and “unhalfbricking” was Sandy's own creation. The album also marked her maturity as a singer and songwriter, including Who Knows Where the Time Goes?, a song covered by many other performers and now regarded as a classic. The only traditional song on the album, A Sailor's Life, is seen as pivotal in the development of English folk-rock music. 89\n\n90. WIMBLEDON HOME WAS LONDON’S FIRST WITH ELECTRICITY AND A TELEPHONE 27 April 2012: Electric street lighting in Wimbledon dates back to 1899 when a brand new power station opened in Durnsford Road. The designer was Arthur Preece but it was his father, the famous engineer Sir William Henry Preece (1834-1913), whom we should really thank for the replacement of dingy Victorian street oil lamps by modern electricity. Not just that – he also introduced London’s first home telephone. William Henry Preece lived with his family at Gothic Lodge in Woodhayes Road, near Wimbledon Common, from 1874 until his death in November 1913. Exactly 114 years ago this month in 1898, he became President of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was knighted the following year after retiring from a long engineering career with the Post Office. Both moves were recognition of his extraordinary contribution to technological progress in Britain as a whole and he continued as an advisor to the Government for some years later. Preece, who came from Caernarvon in Wales, was educated at King's College School when it was still located in The Strand, long before its move to Wimbledon in the 1890s. He later graduated from university in electrical engineering after studying under the famous physicist, Michael Faraday. His career had begun at sea when he was chief engineer with the Electric and International Telegraph Company, repairing telegraph cables to the Channel Islands. 90\n\n91.

From 1870 he worked with the Post Office telegraphic system, eventually becoming its chief engineer and con- tributing his own inventions and those of others to the system. In 1877 he demonstrated the first of Alexander Graham Bell’s new telephones at the year’s British Association for the Advancement of Science gathering in Plymouth. However, at the time he felt no need to have one in his own home. There were plenty of human messengers around who could be employed to run everyday communications. In 1880 he became President of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and in 1884, by detecting electro- magnetic radiation from buried telephone cables, came up with the idea of wireless telegraphy. In 1889 he carried out a successful experiment by transmitting and receiving Morse radio signals over a distance of about a mile across Coniston Water in the Lake District. So he was already a longstanding pioneer in telecom- munications when he befriended the young Guglielmo Marconi in the 1890s and secured funding from the Post Office for his practical experiments in wireless telegraphy. Marconi often visited Preece in Wimbledon and established a transmitter in the back garden of Gothic Lodge to send messages to the Post Office in central London. This time Preece changed his mind about a home phone and Gothic Lodge became London’s first with its own telephone. He didn’t stop there. The house also became the first with electricity installed for lighting, heating hot water and supplying an iron. Eager to apply this experience for the wider public good, in 1890 he urged the local authority to build a power station to supply electric street lighting 92\n\n93. for everyone. Amazingly with hindsight, the idea was rejected. The authority preferred to rely on gas or oil and as Wimbledon’s many new streets had no gas mains, residents had to make do with oil lamps. The Corporation of London was more imaginative as far as Wimbledon’s interests were concerned. In 1894 it asked Preece to demonstrate the effectiveness of public electric lighting and for three months he had 76 electric lamps suspended in Wimbledon High Street. Yet although this was a great success it was another five years before Preece’s son Arthur could convince the new Wimbledon Urban District Council to support a Parliamentary bill permitting it to create a local electricity station. Eventually, the new station in Durnsford Road was able to generate its first electricity on 17 July 1899. Thanks to the Preeces, father and son, Wimbledon had the public street lighting it deserved.

THE STOP/START STORY OF WIMBLEDON’S TRAMS 4 May 2012: For the second half of the 20th century they didn’t even exist, yet Wimbledon’s trams are now really back in fashion. New cars have just been introduced, route extensions are planned and there is talk of a second dedicated platform at Wimbledon Station. Curiously, each time trams have got under way in Wimbledon it has happened in May - albeit 93 years apart - on 2 May 1907 and 29 May 2000. Today’s Tramlink between Wimbledon and Elmers End via Croydon celebrates 12 years of operations this month. But it was back in 1902 when London United Tramways first received permission to extend its line from Tooting to Wimbledon, en route to Kingston and Hampton Court. What’s more, unlike today, earlier trams would also be taking passengers the other way right into central London. It took five years from 1902 to complete the necessary road widening before the first local service could start. Shop frontages in Worple Road, Wimbledon, were drastically cut back to make room for tracks in each direction. At Raynes Park an avenue of 100 elm trees had to be felled to double the width for trams travelling along Burlington Road and West Barnes Lane from Kingston via Malden. The first tram finally arrived at Ely’s Corner on a trial run in August 1906 and the service itself began on 2 May 1907. The trams ran every ten minutes with a fare of 4d - less than two pence - between Hampton Court and 94"
