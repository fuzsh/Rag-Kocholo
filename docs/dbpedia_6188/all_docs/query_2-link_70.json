[1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nHis first wife was Catherine Rodes, daughter of Sir John Rhodes of Barlborough, Derbyshire whom he married on the 16th of February 1607. [5] Their children were John, Richard, Margaret who died in infancy, and Frances. [3]\n\nJohn married for the second time on the 16th of July 1614 at St John (Beverley Minster), Beverley, Anne Rokesby (d. 1624) daughter of Ralph Rokesby or Rokeby, esq. of York. [6][7] Their children were Charles, William and Durant. [3]\n\nJohn was knighted at York on the 11th of April 1617. [8][1]\n\nHe was created 1st Baronet Hotham on the 4th of January 1622. [1]\n\nHis third wife was Frances Legard daughter of John Legard, esq. of Ganton in Yorkshire whom he married sometime after 1624. They had several children who died young. [3]\n\nJohn was first returned to Parliament as Member for Appleby and also for Beverley in 1625, choosing to sit for Beverley. [2]\n\nJohn was married for the fourth time to Catherine daughter of Sir William Bamborough of Housam, Yorkshire on the 27th of October 1631. Their children were Jane and Francis who died young. [3]\n\nHis fifth wife was Sarah Anlaby daughter of Thomas Anlaby, esq. of Etton, Yorkshire whom he married on the 7th of May 1635 . Their children were Dorothy, Alathea who died young, Catherine and Sarah. [3]\n\nIn 1635 John was appointed Governor of Hull. [3]\n\nOn the the 22nd of August 1642 King Charles raised his standard at Nottingham and the country was thrown into civil war. By 1643 John and his eldest son, also John, were considering submitting to the King but before anything came of it the citizens of the city rose up against him. He and his son fled but were soon arrested and John was sent to the Tower. Only after the Battle of Marston Moor when his letters to Newcastle were discovered was John court-martialled, found guilty and condemned to be executed. His execution was delayed to give him time to settle his affairs then he was beheaded at Tower Hill on the 3rd of January 1645 his son having met the same fate on the 1st. [3]\n\nJohn was buried at All Hallows in Barking. [1] Find a Grave claims that he was buried at South Dalton in Yorkshire [9](Find a Grave is wrong. The Sir John Hotham with the large monument in South Dalton church is the second baronet, grandson of this John) [10]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 David Scott, ‘Hotham, Sir John, first baronet (1589–1645)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 20 Feb 2017\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 History of Parliament online 1604-1629: HOTHAM, Sir John, 1st Bt.
