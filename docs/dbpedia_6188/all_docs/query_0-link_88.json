While looking at a plan of the Merton\n\nAbbey estate of 1805 in the Lambeth Archives Department at the Minet Library, I\n\nnoticed that the western boundary was labelled “Lands belonging to Lord Viscount\n\nNelson”. These extended considerably further south than the area normally identified\n\nas Nelson’s estate, and I began to look for further evidence. It soon became clear that\n\nthe 70 acres1 normally quoted as the size of the Merton Place estate only applied to\n\nthe small section, around the house, that Nelson left to Lady Hamilton. At its greatest\n\nextent, between 1802 and 1805, it covered over 160 acres, in Merton, Wimbledon\n\nand Mitcham. It also became clear that at an earlier period, the estate had been very\n\ndifferent, hardly reaching into Merton at all.\n\nThis study began with a chance discovery.

It also became clear that at an earlier period, the estate had been very\n\ndifferent, hardly reaching into Merton at all.\n\nAlthough John had published a few books, his untimely death meant that the vast\n\nmajority of his research had not been published. In fact most of it was in the form of\n\ntranscripts from the many sources that he had discovered, and very little had been\n\nwritten up. The following study is my attempt to do justice to the work of a brilliant\n\nlocal historian, and I hope I am not being too presumptuous in dedicating it to John’s\n\nmemory.\n\nI would like to thank all those who have helped me to follow in John’s footsteps as I\n\nhave looked for myself at most of the sources quoted. I would like to thank the staff\n\nof the Public Record Office, the Surrey Record Office, the Minet Library, and\n\nespecially the Merton Local Studies Centre, who have also allowed me to reproduce\n\nillustrations from their collection. I would also like to thank Dr. Elspeth Veale and\n\nNorman Plastow, of the Wimbledon Society Museum, who allowed me to examine\n\nthe Merton Place deeds in their archives, including some obtained so recently that\n\nthey are not mentioned in John’s notes. I would also like to thank my fellow-members\n\nof Merton Historical Sociey for their help and support, both in our regular Local\n\nHistory Workshops, and in the generous giving of their own time, especially Judith\n\nGoodman for pointing me to more reliable sources for Nelson’s letters.\n\nFinally, my thanks go to John Wallace’s family for allowing me to use his work in this\n\nstudy. I hasten to add that the interpretations of the sources are entirely my own, as\n\nare the mistakes that must inevitably have crept in. As I have challenged the statements\n\nand views of many who have gone before, so I trust that others in their turn will\n\nchallenge the assertions that I have made.\n\nPeter Hopkins\n\nCover Picture – The North and East fronts of Merton Place in 1805, with\n\nNelson’s hatchment displayed between the upper windows.47\n\n(Courtesy of Merton Libraries and Heritage Services)\n\nQ\n\nQuicks 25\n\nR\n\nRick Yard 10, 11, 16\n\nRocque, John 16\n\nRolt, James 24\n\nRose Cottage 8, 14, 30\n\nRow, George 28\n\nS\n\nSt. John’s church 30\n\nSt. Mary’s church 3\n\nSaker, Thomas 35\n\nSenex, John 16\n\nSheephouse Field 10, 16\n\nSheephouse field 22\n\nSheriff of Surrey 4\n\nShoulder of Mutton Field 11\n\nShrubbery 10, 12,\n\n14, 26, 32\n\nSkelton, Robert 24\n\nSkilton, Charles 24\n\nSmith, C R Mackrell 22, 30\n\nSmith, Charles 30\n\nSmith, Mr 32\n\nSmith, Mr E 28\n\nSmith, Rear Admiral Isaac 30\n\nSprinks, Mr 35\n\nStack Yard 11\n\nSturdy, Daniel 24\n\nSun Insurance Company 3\n\nsurveyor 6, 16\n\n47\n\nT\n\nTaylor, Matthew 24\n\nTaylor, Mr 26\n\nThoyts, William 16\n\nThrale, Henry 4, 10, 12\n\nThrale, Ralph 4, 10\n\nThree Corner Mead 11\n\nTrafalgar 8, 21\n\nTurnpike Field 14\n\nU\n\nUpper Field 11\n\nUpper Mill field 10, 14\n\nV\n\nVictoria County History 3\n\nVines, The 28\n\nW\n\nWaller, Frederick 28\n\nWandle 11, 16\n\nWandlebank 12\n\nWarren, Ambrose 38\n\nWelch, William Knight 10, 12\n\nWest 24\n\nWest Field 26\n\nWilson, Richard 8\n\nWilson, Rowland 3, 24\n\nWimbledon Vestry 4\n\nLawn, Great\n\nLawn, Great\n\nLeach, John\n\nLee, Mr\n\nLeonard, Mr\n\nLinton, Robert\n\nLittle Meadow\n\nLongfield\n\nLords Lease, East\n\nLords Lease, West\n\nLower Mill field\n\nM\n\nMatcham, Catherine\n\nMatcham, George\n\nMeriton, Mary\n\nMerton Abbey\n\nMerton Farm\n\nMerton Grove\n\nMerton Priory\n\nMiddle Field\n\nMiddle field\n\nMiddle Mead\n\nMill Field\n\nMill fields\n\nMinto, Lord\n\nMoat House Farm\n\nMorden Hall Farm\n\nMorden Lodge\n\nMoxon, Thomas\n\n10, 12,\n\n14, 22\n\n10, 14\n\n10, 12,\n\n14, 22\n\n5\n\n32\n\n26\n\n18\n\n11\n\n11\n\n10, 12,\n\n14, 24, 25\n\n10, 12,\n\n14, 24, 25\n\n10, 14\n\n21\n\n21\n\n3\n\n3, 5, 10,\n\n14, 16,\n\n18, 19, 30\n\n18\n\n5\n\n3, 16\n\n11, 26\n\n22\n\n10, 16\n\n10, 16\n\n10, 14\n\n33, 35\n\n3, 10, 14\n\n18\n\n8\n\n25\n\n46\n\nN\n\nNelson Arms 31\n\nNelson Grove 28\n\nNelson, Horatio 6, 7, 8,\n\n12, 14,\n\n16, 18,\n\n20, 21,\n\n22, 24,\n\n26, 28,\n\n30, 31,\n\n32, 34,\n\n36, 38,\n\n40\n\nNelson, William, Earl 21, 24,\n\n25\n\nNelson’s Fields 28\n\nNewton, James 5\n\nNile 18\n\nO\n\nOakman, James 24\n\nOman, Carola 31, 35,\n\n38\n\nOrchard 26\n\nP\n\nPaddock 26\n\nPencot’s Road 28\n\nPerring, Sir John 8\n\nPerry, James 12\n\nPhillips, Richard Mansell 24,\n\n25\n\nPinhey, Hamnett 8, 14, 30\n\nPleasure-ground(s) 26\n\nPratt, Eleanor 4\n\nPratt, Henry 3, 4, 10,\n\n14, 16,\n\n33, 38\n\nTHE OWNERS\n\nThere are many conflicting accounts of the origins of Merton Place.\n\nThe Victoria County History,2 confused by the fact that the name was\n\npreviously applied to the predecessor of Church House opposite St.\n\nMary’s church, states that it was:\n\nan early 18th-century house, built probably by Mr. Robert\n\nDorrill, who settled Merton Place by name on his daughter Mary\n\nMeriton in 1709.\n\nIt seems that J K Laughton3 originated the oft-repeated opinion that:\n\nMerton Place was a roomy, comfortable house, dating back\n\napparently to the end of the 17th or beginning of the 18th century,\n\nwhen the land … was in the possession of William Hubbald\n\n[who]… died in 1709.\n\nHubbald owned the adjoining Merton Abbey estate, within the precinct\n\nwall of the former Merton Priory, but he had not owned Merton Place.\n\nAccording to a lease in the Minet Library,4 the house was built by Henry\n\nPratt. It is described as:\n\nthat capital messuage heretofore built and erected by Henry Pratt\n\nEsq. situated in the parishes of Merton and Wimbledon, or one\n\nof them, which with the lands hereinafter mentioned, were\n\nformerly called Moat House Farm.\n\nHenry Pratt had bought the site of his new home on 15th and 16th June\n\n1748,5 from a Thomas Hammond, whose grandfather, William\n\nHammond, had in turn bought the land on 11th and 12th March 1699,\n\nfrom Ellis Crisp. (Crisp’s great-grandfather, Rowland Wilson, had also\n\nowned theMerton Abbey estate that was eventually owned by Hubbald).\n\nPratt insured the new building with the Sun Insurance Company. In his\n\npolicy dated 22nd August 1753,6 it is described as:\n\na building valued £150 brick, £350 timber on ye south side of\n\nthe Road at Martin in the Parish of Martin Surrey, standing\n\nclear, and in the possession of Mark Hawkins.\n\nHe renewed the policy on 25th September, by which time the value had\n\nincreased to £500 brick, £250 timber.\n\n3\n\nBy his willBy his will made in 1753, Pratt left his property to his son, also named\n\nHenry, who sold it:\n\nby indentures of lease and release 19th and 20th November 1764\n\nbetween Henry Pratt son and devisee of the said Henry Pratt\n\nthen deceased and Sir Richard Hotham of St. Martin in the\n\nFields, merchant.4\n\nHotham may well have been related to Henry Pratt, as in his will7 dated\n\n22nd May 1797 and proved 19th April 1799, he left:\n\na £20 annuity to Eleanor Pratt of Roundcourt, Strand, a distant\n\nrelative of mine.\n\nHotham has been described as a ‘colourful character’.8 Born in 1722,\n\nof Yorkshire stock, he worked in London as a hatter until around 1760,\n\nwhen he joined his father in the business of shipping for the East India\n\nCompany, thereby making his fortune. He was an outspoken critic of\n\nthe East India Company, whom he accused of bad management.\n\nHe was knighted by George III in 1769, and served as Sheriff of Surrey\n\nfrom 1770-1771. He was involved in litigation against the Wimbledon\n\nVestry for a period of five years over the upkeep of Dunsford Lane,\n\nnow Durnsford Road, but in 1778 the Vestry appointed him their\n\nChairman.\n\nIn 1780 he stood for Parliament in the Borough of Southwark, in\n\nopposition to the sitting MP, Henry Thrale. Thrale, a Southwark brewer,\n\nand son of a former Sheriff of Surrey and MP for Southwark, had held\n\nthe seat for 15 years and was supported by Dr. Samuel Johnson and\n\nFanny Burney. After a bitter contest, with many derisive comments\n\nabout ‘Hotham the Hatmaker’, Hotham was elected with 1177 votes\n\nagainst Thrale’s 769!\n\nInterestingly, this was not the first contact between Hotham and Thrale.\n\nIn 1769 Hotham had bought a 7 acre field in Wimbledon, adjoining the\n\nnorth of his estate, from Henry Thrale, which the latter had inherited\n\nfrom his father, Ralph Thrale (see p.10).\n\nHotham only served one term in Parliament, being narrowly defeated\n\nby 11 votes at the 1784 election by a director of the East India Company.\n\n4\n\nG\n\nGarden, New 10\n\nGarden, Old 10\n\nGarraway’s Coffee House 26\n\nGarrett Meadow\n\nGeorge III\n\nGold Field\n\nGoldsmid, Aaron\n\nGoldsmid, Abraham\n\nGoldsmid, Asher\n\nGreat Field\n\nGreat Meadow\n\nGreaves & Co\n\nGreaves, Ann\n\nGreaves, Charles\n\nGreaves, George\n\nGreaves, James\n\nGreen, James\n\nH\n\nHalfhide, Mr.\n\nHamilton Avenue\n\nHamilton, Emma\n\nHamilton, Sir William\n\nHammond, Thomas\n\nHammond, William\n\nHarrison, James\n\nHaslewood, William\n\nHawkins, Mark\n\nHayden’s Lane\n\nHenshaw, Walter\n\nHither Field\n\n11\n\n4\n\n10, 12\n\n14, 25, 30\n\n8, 25, 27\n\n8, 25, 27,\n\n30\n\n11\n\n11\n\n11, 16\n\n6\n\n5, 6, 8,\n\n11, 12, 24\n\n6\n\n6\n\n10\n\n18\n\n8\n\n8, 18, 21,\n\n22, 23,\n\n24, 25,\n\n28, 32,\n\n34, 35\n\n7, 16\n\n3\n\n3\n\n18\n\n7, 24, 25\n\n3\n\n32\n\n16\n\n11\n\nHodgson, William 5, 6\n\nHollier, Richard 10\n\nHolmes 11\n\nHome Closes 10, 14\n\nHome Mead 10, 16\n\nHopkins, Benjamin Bond 16\n\nHotham, Richard 4, 5, 10,\n\n12, 14,\n\n15, 16,\n\n24, 31,\n\n33\n\nHothamton 5\n\nHubbald, William 3\n\nHubbard, Edward 12\n\nHudson, James 40\n\nI\n\nInnes, Albert 10\n\nJ\n\nJagger, Canon 31\n\nJames, David 10\n\nJohnson, Dr. Samuel 4\n\nK\n\nKelly, Thomas 28\n\nKeys, Ann 28\n\nKillick, James 24\n\nKnight, William 12, 13,\n\n16\n\nL\n\nLand Tax 11, 18,\n\n30\n\nLane, Germaine 8\n\nLaughton, J K 3, 32, 38\n\nLawn 14, 26\n\nLawn, East 10, 12,\n\n14, 22\n\n45\n\nINDEX\n\nINDEX\n\nAbbey Gate House 18, 30\n\nAboukir Bay 18\n\nAlmshouse Close 24\n\nAxe, Ann 21\n\nAxe, Samuel 21\n\nAxe, William 18, 21,\n\n22, 28\n\nB\n\nBarn field 22\n\nBartlett, William 31, 35\n\nBennett, John Leach 16, 31\n\nBennett, Thomas 16, 17,\n\n31, 32\n\nBickerley Mead 11\n\nBiggory Mead 11\n\nBognor 5\n\nBolton, Susanna 24\n\nBolton, Thomas 24, 25\n\nBond, E.

Having spent the summer\n\nof 1784 at the seaside hamlet of Bognor, he decided to build an estate\n\nthere. Soon he was planning a seaside resort for the rich and famous a\n\ngarden town with houses and terraces in their own grounds, which he\n\ncalled ‘Hothamton’. He started buying up every available piece of land\n\nin the district, and had soon built a hotel and a library.9 In 1792 he sold\n\nhis Merton Place estate, with the exception of one field, near the present\n\nSouth Wimbledon crossroads, on which he built Merton Grove as his\n\nSurrey residence. He ploughed the remainder of his fortune into his\n\nnew dream, but unfortunately progress was slower than he had hoped,\n\nand after his death in 1799 the scheme collapsed.\n\nWhen Hotham sold the property on 22nd June 1792,4 he referred to:\n\nseveral alterations and additions having been lately made to\n\nthe said capital messuage by the said Sir Richard Hotham and\n\nthe same having been greatly enlarged and improved the said\n\ncapital messuage for some time past hath been and now is known\n\nby the name of and called Merton Place, together with all barns,\n\ncoach houses, stables, dovehouses, outhouses, sheds, gardens,\n\norchards, and fold yards, lights, easements and appurtenances\n\nwhatsoever to the said capital messuage belonging or\n\nappurtenant or now used therewith as well those which adjoin\n\nor are contiguous to the said capital messuage as those that are\n\nsituated standing at some distance therefrom and have been lately\n\nerected, built and made by Sir Richard Hotham in the field or\n\nclose over against Merton Abbey wall where an ancient messuage\n\nor tenement formerly stood…\n\nHotham sold the property, much enlarged in lands as well as buildings,\n\nto the calico printers, Charles Greaves, William Hodgson, James Newton\n\n& John Leach of Cheapside, London, but they had financial problems,\n\nand defaulted on a £10,000 debt in October 1793. Charles Greaves\n\nrepaid half of this, and it was agreed that he should enjoy the house and\n\npart of the estate for life, as long as it was sold on his death.10\n\nIn 1793 it was described as:-11\n\nthat capital messuage called Merton Place and detached kitchen,\n\ndairy, larder, icehouse, hothouse, and greenhouse, all lying\n\nwithin a walled and paled fence…\n\n5\n\n44\n\nIn his willIn his will made on 16th February 1799, updated on 21st August\n\n1800, and proved at London on 10th January 1801, Charles Greaves,\n\nhaving made adequate provision for his widow, then directed:\n\nI give and devise my capital messuage or mansion house called\n\nMerton Place and appertinents together with the several closes,\n\npieces or parcels of land thereto belonging, situate, lying and\n\nbeing in the several parishes of Merton, Wimbledon and\n\nMitcham, or one of them, in Surrey and now in my own\n\noccupation unto and to the use of my said dear wife Ann Greaves,\n\nmy said brother George Greaves, my said partner William\n\nHodgson, and my said son James Greaves and heirs on trust as\n\nfollows:\n\nas soon as possible after my decease to sell and dispose of said\n\nhereditaments and premises and every part thereof either\n\ntogether or in parcels and either by public sale or private\n\ncontract for the best price that reasonably can be got for the\n\nsame. I direct the monies arising shall be considered part of the\n\nresidue of my personal estate.\n\nWhen the estate was advertised for sale13 in 1801, it was described as:\n\nAn elegant and very commodious brick edifice uniformly erected\n\non a pleasing plan and elevation … Containing in the Whole 52\n\nacres 1 rood 32 perches,1 be the same more or less, enclosed\n\nwith Park Paling and remarkably fine live Quick Fences.\n\nHowever, Nelson’s surveyor, Mr. Cockerell, did not share this view,\n\nand his report14 was outspoken in its condemnation:\n\nThere are so many insurmountable objections as a Residence,\n\nthat I am astonished anyone can think of it as nearly compleat\n\nfor any family.\n\nThe House itself standing on only an acre and half of Ground is\n\nsurrounded on three sides within 20 yards of it by the property\n\nof others, continually in Tillage, and is liable to be annoyed by\n\nthe meanest buildings or other nuisances which may be placed\n\nclose to it; – and within that straightened boundary is\n\ncircumscribed by a dirty black looking canal, or rather a broad\n\nditch, which keeps the whole place damp.\n\n6\n\n35 G.P.B.

The Offices behind are even worse than the House and\n\nthe roof and other parts are so much out of repair that before\n\nthey can be furnished and comfortably inhabited at least £1,000\n\nmust be laid out, exclusive of furniture, and the present furniture\n\nof the principal apartments is so inferior that it must also be\n\nreplaced with new, in which £1,000 more may be easily expended;\n\n– and when done there will be but one Bed Chamber in the House\n\nfit for a Gentleman’s accommodation, and that without a\n\nDressing Room or other convenience, and not one Room to the\n\nsouth of the House.\n\nAdd to all this the Land is entirely detached by the Turnpike\n\nRoad and is surrounded by Public Roads possessing not the\n\nleast privacy as a place of pleasure – on a dead flat and a clay\n\nsoil and the whole most scantily worn and out of condition – but\n\nif all these things were wanting in the most essential requisites;\n\nthere is no kitchen garden or a foot of fruit wall nor any proper\n\nsituation to make one and no Stabling belonging or even a Shed\n\nor out-houses for cows or other necessary live or dead stock\n\nwithout which the land cannot be occupied – In short it is\n\naltogether the worst place under all its circumstances that I\n\never saw pretending to suit a Gentleman’s family.\n\nNelson was not put off by the report, and wrote14 to his solicitor, Mr\n\nHaslewood, on September 4th:\n\nI cannot afford a fine house and grounds, therefore I wish for\n\nMerton as it is and the sooner you can accomplish the purchase\n\nas it stands the more you will oblige.\n\nNelson bought the “little farm at Merton – the price £9,000″15 on\n\nSeptember 18th 1801, possession being promised for October 10th,\n\nthough contracts16were not finally signed until 23rd and 24th October\n\n1801, following Nelson’s return from sea.\n\nSir William Hamilton, wrote17 to Nelson on 16th October 1801:\n\n7\n\nThe proximity to the capital and the perfect retirement of this\n\nplace, are for your Lordship, two points beyond estimation; but\n\nthe house is so comfortable, the furniture clean and good, and I\n\nnever saw so many conveniences united in so small a compass.\n\nYou have nothing but to come and enjoy immediately.\n\nThe proximity to the capital and the perfect retirement of this\n\nplace, are for your Lordship, two points beyond estimation; but\n\nthe house is so comfortable, the furniture clean and good, and I\n\nnever saw so many conveniences united in so small a compass.\n\nYou have nothing but to come and enjoy immediately.\n\n18 and\n\napparently he did enjoy his new home. On leaving Merton four years\n\nlater for his final voyage that ended at Trafalgar, he referred to “dear,\n\ndear Merton, where I left all which I hold dear in this world…”.19\n\nIn his will,20 dated 10th May 1803, Nelson left the house, furniture and\n\n70 acres of Merton Place to Lady Hamilton, but the remainder of the\n\nestate was to be sold to meet the debts he had incurred in buying the\n\nproperty. According to the 1801 deeds,16 £2000 of the original Greaves\n\nestate was on mortgage that was not extinguished until 24th October\n\n1803, and Nelson had also borrowed from family and friends.\n\nEmma Hamilton used her estate as collateral for loans, selling annuities\n\nfrom the estate totalling £1000 a year between November 1806 and\n\nJanuary 1808. In 1808,16 when it became necessary to sell Merton Place,\n\n“City friends” came to her rescue. Sir John Perring, Alexander Davison,\n\nAbraham Goldsmid, Richard Wilson and Germaine Lane took it over\n\non trust to sell, reimburse their expenses, and redeem the six annuities.21\n\nFinally, on 18th and 19th August 1809, her neighbour, Abraham\n\nGoldsmid and his brother Asher, purchased the entire estate for\n\n£12,930.22 However, on 28th September 1810, fearing financial ruin,\n\nAbraham shot himself in the grounds of his country house, Morden\n\nLodge, and Merton Place was offered for sale by private treaty.\n\nNine acres within the Wimbledon section were bought by Hamnett\n\nPinhey, a young London importer, who emigrated to Ontario, Canada\n\nin 1820. He began negotiations with Abraham Goldsmid for the land\n\non which he was to build Rose Cottage (now 101, Hamilton Avenue) in\n\nAugust 1810, but Pinhey’s little property transaction “became entangled\n\nin the ponderous intricacies of national finance.” It was not until 18th\n\nApril 1815, that Pinhey completed the purchase and received the deeds.23\n\nThe rest of the Wimbledon property remained in the Goldsmid family\n\nfor over 40 years, while the house and grounds in Merton were offered\n\n24 25\n\nfor sale in 1815,and in 1823 (figure 1).\n\n8\n\n..\n\n…….\n\n………\n\n….\n\n…\n\n……..\n\nFigure 14 – Outline of Nelson’s Merton Place Estate traced on a modern\n\nstreet map produced by Merton Design Unit, Merton Council\n\nreproduced with permission\n\n…\n\n….\n\n………\n\n…….\n\n..\n\n…..\n\n..\n\n..\n\n…..\n\n…..\n\nNelson’s\n\nestate\n\nHotham’s\n\nestate\n\n….\n\n..\n\n…..\n\n..\n\n0 500m 1 Km\n\n41\n\nit disappeared into the wilderness of bricks and mortar which at\n\npresent cover it – cover the shrubbery, cover the site of that\n\npaddock and the small mound on which Nelson was wont to sit.\n\nit disappeared into the wilderness of bricks and mortar which at\n\npresent cover it – cover the shrubbery, cover the site of that\n\npaddock and the small mound on which Nelson was wont to sit.\n\n64\n\nwho married Emma Cribb, daughter of Nelson’s gardener, in September\n\n1816.55 On Christmas Eve 1863, he wrote from Merton to his son:\n\nWhen first we came to live here there were but three cottages on\n\nthe Estate, and only 11 persons, three men, three women and\n\nfive children. Now there are over two hundred houses, and nearly\n\na thousand people. For nearly seven years after we came here,\n\nNelson’s beautiful mansion stood entire and furnished, as when\n\nhe had left it … But now, what a change has come over it! Of\n\nthat mansion not so much as a stick or stone remains to mark\n\nthe spot on which it stood. Those beautiful pleasure grounds\n\nand gardens all destroyed, the trees and shrubs all cut down,\n\nthe birds have hied themselves to some more quiet and secluded\n\nspot … and if this is not sufficient to disfigure and transform the\n\nplace, they are going to make a railroad right through the centre\n\nof it.\n\nFigure 13 – The North and East fronts of Merton Place, showing on the far\n\nleft the southern kitchen extension of 1805.47\n\n1.

The two wings are\n\njoined by the ‘Grand entrance hall and saloon’. In some views this\n\nappears to be single-storey, though one illustration (figure 9), which\n\ndoes not show the kitchen extension of 1805, shows some rooms set\n\nback a little, over the entrance. There are verandas, which the 1805\n\nplan calls ‘Miradors’, across the two bays, with a flight of steps up to\n\nthe central entrance.\n\nThe east elevation shows the ‘newly built’ South wing, with a two-\n\nstorey bay to match the east bay of the North wing.

It is tempting to assume a clerical error, and\n\nto identify the original house with the later service block. Alternatively,\n\nthe original house may have been part of the central three-storey section\n\nof the North wing, though this was only around 30′ x 26′. It must be\n\nremembered that Pratt’s properties in 1753 were valued at £150 for the\n\npart built of brick, and £350 for the part built of timber. As the house\n\nwas valued at £220, it cannot have been entirely of brick.\n\nCarola Oman says that the entrance was moved to the North front while\n\nNelson was at sea between 1803 and 1805, whereas the 1805 plan shows\n\nthe main entrance on the East front. A north entrance is shown on the\n\nplan, but it leads into the Breakfast Room. It would seem more likely\n\nthat the main entrance had been in the centre of the North front, but was\n\nmoved to the East front when the South wing was extended. The porch,\n\nshown over the entrance on the North face in earlier illustrations and on\n\nthe 1805 plan, is missing on the engraving by Ambrose Warren, published\n\nin 1806 (figure 13). This engraving shows the kitchen extension to the\n\nsouth, the subject of the 1805 plan, which appears to be single-storey.\n\nThe mansion had already been pulled down by 1823 , as the Particulars\n\nof Sale25 say of Lot 28: UPON THIS LOT THE MANSION RECENTLY STOOD.\n\nKathleen Denbigh’s suggestion62 that some of the rubble was still there\n\nin 1903 is a misinterpretation of J K Laughton’s comment63 that actually\n\nreferred to the dense housing that replaced the property:\n\n38\n\nHither Field 3 3 1\n\nMiddle Field 3 3 31\n\nLongfield 2 3 36\n\nGreat Field 4 2 12\n\nFurther Field 3 0 18\n\nRick Yard 1 9\n\nin Bickerley Mead 3 8\n\nin Bickerley Mead 2 0 6\n\nin Bickerley Mead 1 2\n\nShoulder of Mutton Field or Three Corner Mead 2 38\n\nCallico Ground 12 0 29\n\nLittle Meadow or Stack Yard 1 2 10\n\nGreat Meadow or Upper Field 3 3 31\n\nway to the River Wandle 19\n\nHolmes or the Garrett Meadow 3 3 18\n\n44 0 28\n\nHe had reorganised these as follows:Hither\n\nField 3 2 19\n\nMiddle Field 4 0 21\n\nGreat Field 6 0 31\n\nFurther Field 4 3 1\n\nin Biggory Mead 4 0 37\n\nadjoining on the east 0 1 3\n\nShoulder of Mutton Field 4 0 13\n\nCallico Ground 12 3 18\n\nLittle Meadow and part of lane 1 2 3\n\nGreat Meadow 3 3 25\n\n45 2 11\n\nThese lands total 129 acres, which accords with the 1799 Land Tax\n\nRedemption Certificates, which show that the estate was assessed as\n\nfollows:\n\nCharles Greaves Esq of Merton:27 messuage, etc in Merton\n\n52 acres land in Wimbledon\n\nMessrs Greaves & Co.:28 78 acres land in Wimbledon\n\nmaking a total of: 130 acres land in Wimbledon\n\n11\n\nAs these 129 or 130 acres were all in Wimbledon, only the house itself\n\nwas within Merton parish.

(figure 12) The ‘strong stone closet’ in\n\nthe servants hall of 1801 is easily recognisable in the south-west corner\n\nof the Housekeeper’s room. The new kitchen of 1805 presumably\n\nreleased the former kitchen to become the ‘intended Servants hall’. The\n\n‘Eating Room’ and the ‘Hall and Ante Room’ are both shown in red on\n\nthe plan, and described as ‘lately built’, so presumably the previous\n\n‘large dining room’ had found a new use as the Library or a Drawing\n\nRoom. The Breakfast Room is shown on the 1805 plan, though it is not\n\nspecified in the 1815 Particulars of Sale. The Particulars of Sale both\n\nrefer to two Drawing Rooms, but only one is shown on the plan, the\n\nother being upstairs according to Feldborg’s report of 1805.59\n\nContemporary illustrations give us more information. The North wing\n\nhad a central block of three storeys, hence the reference to the ‘chamber\n\nfloors’ and the ‘two upper bed chambers’.

With regard to the\n\nrebuilding, although he approved the result, the Admiral was not so\n\nhappy. He had written painfully when the new drawing-room was\n\nmooted, “I hardly know how to find the money; but if it is to be done\n\nthis year it is begun before this time; it is too late to say a word”.60\n\nHe was soon brought to realise that the dining-room needed enlargement,\n\nand a Mr. Chawner, who had completed the work started by a Mr.\n\nSprinks, had not been paid. He resolved to pay Chawner by selling\n\nsome of his presentation plate.60 A “Plan of the Entrance Story of\n\nLord Nelson’s House”,25 by Thomas Chawner, dated January 1805,\n\nuses colour coding to distinguish those sections “lately built” and those\n\n“proposed to be built” by Lady Hamilton. (figure 12)\n\nThe results of all this expenditure were appreciated by Lord Minto,\n\nwhose previous opinion of Merton Place and its hostess had been less\n\nthan complimentary. After a visit in 1805, he wrote to his wife:-61\n\nLady Hamilton has improved and added to the house and the\n\nplace extremely well and without his knowing she was about it.\n\nShe is a clever being after all: the passion is as hot as ever.\n\nWilliam Bartlett recalled the impressions passed on to him by Thomas\n\nSaker, a former carpenter and general factotum at Merton Place:\n\nThe house itself was roomy, but not magnificent. Plenty of glass\n\nand light seemed to be the predominant taste of one who had\n\nspent much of his life in the open air. Glass doors in front and\n\na long passage with glass doors opening into the lawn behind,\n\nand even plate-glass reflecting doors to some of the principal\n\nrooms, must have thrown an appearance of lightness about the\n\ninterior.54\n\nThe Particulars of Sale24 of 1815 give more details, including some\n\nmeasurements:\n\n35\n\nThe whole establishment and way of life is such as to make me\n\nangry, as well as melancholy; but I cannot alter it, and I do not\n\nthink myself obliged or at liberty to quarrel with him for his\n\nweakness, though nothing shall ever induce me to give the\n\nsmallest countenance to Lady Hamilton… The love she makes\n\nto him is not only ridiculous, but disgusting: not only the rooms,\n\nbut the whole house, staircase and all, are covered with nothing\n\nbut pictures of her and him, of all sizes and sorts, and\n\nrepresentations of his naval actions, coats of arms, pieces of\n\nplate in his honour, the flagstaff of L’Orient, etc. – an excess of\n\nvanity which counteracts its own purpose. If it was Lady H’s\n\nhouse there might be a pretence for it; to make his own a mere\n\nlooking-glass to view himself all day is bad taste.\n\nThe whole establishment and way of life is such as to make me\n\nangry, as well as melancholy; but I cannot alter it, and I do not\n\nthink myself obliged or at liberty to quarrel with him for his\n\nweakness, though nothing shall ever induce me to give the\n\nsmallest countenance to Lady Hamilton… The love she makes\n\nto him is not only ridiculous, but disgusting: not only the rooms,\n\nbut the whole house, staircase and all, are covered with nothing\n\nbut pictures of her and him, of all sizes and sorts, and\n\nrepresentations of his naval actions, coats of arms, pieces of\n\nplate in his honour, the flagstaff of L’Orient, etc. – an excess of\n\nvanity which counteracts its own purpose.

The stair window, we settled, was not to be stopped\n\nup.\n\nOn 26th August 1805, A A Feldborg, a Danish visitor59:\n\nwas much charmed with the situation of Merton-place…. Merton-\n\nplace is not a large, but a very elegant structure; in the balconies\n\nI observed a great number of ladies, who I understood to be\n\nLord Nelson’s relations.\n\nEntering the house, I proceeded through a lobby which, among\n\na variety of paintings and other pieces of art, contained an\n\nexcellent marble bust of the illustrious Admiral…. I was then\n\nushered into a magnificent apartment where Lady Hamilton sat\n\nat the window. I at first scarcely observed his Lordship, he\n\nhaving placed himself immediately at the entrance on the right…\n\nHis lordship then conducted me up stairs and pointed out to me\n\na profile [of the Crown Prince of Denmark]….\n\nDescending from the drawing-room, Lord Nelson paused on the\n\nstaircase, the walls of which were adorned with prints of his\n\nLordship’s battles and other naval engagements, he pointed out\n\nto me the Battle off Copenhagen.\n\n34\n\nPJH\n\nFigure 3 – Map of Sir Richard Hotham’s Merton Place estate in 1792,\n\nsuperimposed on the Tithe maps.\n\n15\n\nHome Mead Home Mead 1 21\n\nMiddle Mead 3 3 7\n\nRick Yard 2 17\n\nSheephouse Field 5 3 38\n\nMill Field 9 0 26\n\n23 3 29\n\nThe phrase’over against’ is defined as’opposite’, confirming a possible\n\nlocation within Wimbledon parish, opposite the walls of Merton Priory.\n\nSome of the land in the vicinity is already accounted for. Hotham’s sale\n\nto Greaves & Co. mentions land to the south of his property belonging\n\nto Benjamin Bond Hopkins, which is presumably that shown on a map31\n\nof the Bond Hopkins estate c.1772 as occupied by William Thoyts, the\n\nproprietor of the copper mills (plots 275 & 278 on the Wimbledon Tithe\n\nMap). The adjoining land west of the Wandle, with a mill, had been\n\nsold by Ellis Crisp to William Knight in 1690, and is shown on a plan\n\nof Knight’s lands from this date by Walter Henshaw.32\n\nHowever, three fields shown on the Wimbledon Tithe Apportionment,\n\nplots 273, 274 and 276, could possibly be the property formerly owned\n\nby Henry Pratt. They total 23¾ acres, and they adjoin the 33 acres of\n\nthe Lawns. Buildings are shown here, on the corner of the road to\n\nWandsworth, in the earliest maps we have, John Senex’s map of 1729,\n\nand John Rocque’s maps of 1741-5 and 1765. Perhaps these represent\n\nthe ancient messuage or tenement in the field or close over against\n\nMerton Abbey wall, mentioned by Hotham in 1792.4\n\nAccording to the Tithe Apportionment, plot 273 was the property of\n\nJohn Leach Bennett. On 12th November 1801, Nelson and Sir William\n\nHamilton signed an agreement with his father, Thomas Bennett of\n\nWimbledon, for the lease of the “several barns stables granary coach-\n\nhouse cow-house hen-house sheds and other erections situate in the\n\nparish of Wimbledon”.33 The attached plan (figure 4) shows it to have\n\nbeen at the southern end of the plot, bordering on the London Road.\n\nThe surveyor’s report for Merton Place had stated that the house itself\n\nstood on only an acre and a half and within twenty yards of this was the\n\nproperty of others, “and within that straightened boundary is\n\ncircumscribed by a dirty black looking canal or rather a broad ditch,\n\nwhich keeps the whole place damp.” 14\n\n16\n\nTHE HOUSE\n\nPratt’s insurance policy6 of 22nd August 1753 gives the measurements\n\nof the original house and outbuildings:\n\nTwo storey and garrets 46′ x 22′ £220\n\nBarn 78′ x 22′, 13′ x 10′, 13′ x 10′ £220\n\nCowhouse shedded 26′ x 10′ £25\n\nStable 25′ x 15′ £30\n\nChaffhouse 15′ x 6′ £5\n\nWe have no details of the “alterations and additions” made by Hotham,4\n\nother than that it had “been greatly enlarged and improved” by 1792,\n\nbut we have a good description in the Particulars of Sale13 of 1801:\n\nAn elegant and very commodious brick edifice uniformly erected\n\non a pleasing plan and elevation, containing 2 Upper Bed\n\nChambers, a very spacious principal Bed Chamber and 2 other\n\nprincipal Bed Chambers and a Water Closet.\n\n2 elegant Drawing Rooms and a most excellent Dining Room of\n\nlarge Dimensions, fitted up with Sienna, Egyptian and white\n\nMarble Chimney Pieces, rich India Paper Hangings and\n\ncorrespondent finished; A Breakfast Parlour and small Room;\n\na neat Vestibule and capital principal Staircase.\n\nOn the Basement Storey – Complete Wine Vaults with Brick\n\nCatticombs [sic], cellaring and numerous Conveniences.\n\nThe distinct Attached Buildings contain: 3 Bed Chambers neatly\n\nfitted up, 2 Servants Chambers, a Store Room and Laundry; a\n\nvery extensive Servants Hall with a Strong Stone Closet and\n\ncapital Iron Door; a convenient Kitchen provided with proper\n\nconnected Offices, arched Coal Vault, Wash House and Brew\n\nHouse.\n\nA detached Range of Buildings, consisting of a very neat fitted\n\nup Dairy, a cool Larder and other Conveniences, And an ice\n\nHouse.\n\nVisitors to Merton Place also reported on its appearance. Lord Minto,\n\nformerly Sir Gilbert Elliott, Viceroy of Corsica, arrived at Merton on\n\nSaturday 20th March 1802. He wrote58 to his wife:\n\n33\n\nAn undated agreement,An undated agreement, in Nelson’s handwriting, refers to new work:\n\nSpecification of the several Artificers’ Works to be performed\n\nin erecting a Building to contain Two Double Coach houses, a\n\nsix stall Stable and a cow house, and in building three small\n\ncottages for Lord Nelson at Merton in Surry.\n\nThese may refer to work on Bennett’s land, or elsewhere within the\n\nWimbledon section of the estate. However, the Particulars of Sale46 of\n\naround 1808 refer to the House with the Offices, Lawns, Shrubberies,\n\nCanals, Plantations, Farm House, Barns, Stables, Outbuildings Yards,\n\nwithin Lady Hamilton’s 70 acres, which did not include Bennett’s land,\n\nand the 1815 Particulars of Sale,24 which only refer to the 40 acres\n\nsouth of the road, tell us that there was a coach house and stables in this\n\nsouthern section. Unfortunately, we don’t know when they were built:\n\nthe coach house, two stables and two newbuilt cottages with\n\nyards, drying grounds, etc. A large garden and orchard with\n\nN\n\nHouse of Mr\n\nBennett Mr Bennetts Land\n\nIntended fence\n\nhothouse, greenhouse, etc., also a paddock of rich pasture land\n\nskirted by extensive shrubbery walks.\n\nA Farmery with various outbuildings is shown on Cracklow’s plan of\n\n1806,41 (figure 8) but we have no proof that the coach houses, stables\n\nand cottages were in this area.\n\nThe Lodge and Carriage Gates were part of Lot 31 of the 1823\n\nParticulars of Sale,25 which extended to Abbey Lane (figure 1).\n\nChamberlain55 says that the tunnel ran under the road ‘near Mr. Lee’s\n\ndrapery stores'[39 High Street], and Laughton56 quoting the local\n\nIntended\n\nRoad to Wandsworth\n\ndoors\n\ndoors\n\nBarns\n\nfence\n\nIntended fence\n\ndoors doors\n\nShed Cowhouse\n\nhen\n\nhouse etc\n\nField Fence\n\nGranary\n\nCoachhouse\n\nStables\n\nbutcher, Mr. Corke, of 61 High Street, tells us that:\n\nthe subway was still open within Mr. Corke’s knowledge, and he\n\nhas often been through it.

However, Nelson heeded the warnings\n\nabout the proximity of neighbours, for he began buying additional lands.\n\nIn a letter to Lady Hamilton on 26th September 1801, Nelson writes:\n\nIf I can afford to buy the Duck Close and the field adjoining it\n\nwould be pleasant, but I fear it is not in my power.35\n\nNelson bought a strip of land from his neighbour, Mr. Halfhide, tenant\n\nof Abbey Gatehouse, for £23.36 Also, Harrison34 tells us:\n\nHe applied by letter dated the 25th October 1801 to William\n\nAxe, Esq. of Birchin Lane, London, who was proprietor of the\n\nsmall intervening field which alone separated Merton Place from\n\nthe narrow lane at the end of the abbey wall, to be favoured with\n\nthe purchase of it, on equitable terms; and though [Mr Axe] …\n\npaid all possible attention to the wish of his lordship; a churlish\n\nfarmer, who was Mr Axe’s tenant, on lease, of the whole adjoining\n\nestate, where he had acquired a considerable fortune, opposed\n\nso many objections, and evinced so rude and unaccommodating\n\na disposition, notwithstanding his lordship had condescendingly\n\ntreated him with every courtesy, that the object was not\n\naccomplished till his lordship, about a year and a half afterwards,\n\npurchased the whole farm, consisting of 115 acres; which Mr\n\nAxe liberally consented to sell for … £8,000.\n\nAccording to the Land Tax Redemption Certificates of 1799, Axe held\n\n113 acres land plus messuage, etc. in Merton37 and 1 acre land in\n\nMitcham,38 both occupied by Robert Linton. The extent of Axe’s 113\n\nacres in Merton can be deduced from maps of neighbouring estates.\n\nThe east boundary is shown on an 1805 map39 of the adjoining Merton\n\nAbbey estate, marked “lands belonging to Lord Viscount Nelson” (figure\n\n5). The west and south boundaries are set by Neale’s Merton Farm\n\nand Garth’s Morden Hall Farm as shown on the Tithe map.40\n\nThis brought Nelson’s estate to over 160 acres, from present day South\n\nPark Road Wimbledon in the north, to the Wimbledon to Croydon railway\n\nline (now the tramway) in the south, from Merton Road, Brisbane Road,\n\nWillmore End and Morden Road on the west, to Haydons Road, Abbey\n\nRoad and Deer Park Road on the east (figure 14).\n\n18\n\nTHE TUNNEL\n\nAs we have seen, the Merton Place estate had always been in two parts,\n\nthe house south of the turnpike road, and the original grounds to the\n\nnorth of the road. The two sections were connected by a tunnel under\n\nthe road. The earliest extant reference to the tunnel dates from 1790, in\n\nEdwards’ Companion from London to Brighthelmston:-50\n\nOn the left near the road is Merton Place, a handsome seat\n\nbelonging to Sir Richard Hotham: it is surrounded with a mote\n\nand under the turnpike road is a passage from the house to\n\nsome pleasant shrubberies of large extent, which lie on the north\n\nof the road.\n\nThe tunnel is also mentioned in the Particulars of Sale13 of 1801:\n\nA subterraneous Passage under the High Road to: The beautiful\n\nShrubbery and Walks stocked with Timber and other Trees and\n\nPlants of considerable Value and the adjoining rich Lawn and\n\nPaddocks of fine Grass Land.\n\nHowever, the tunnel seems to have been either in an unsatisfactory\n\ncondition, or have needed enlarging for use by carriages, as in August\n\n1804, Nelson wrote:-51\n\nThe underground passage will, I hope, be made, but I shall,\n\nplease God soon see it all.\n\nHis hopes for the tunnel were satisfied, as Carola Oman52 tells us, by\n\nthe time of his return to Merton in 1805:\n\nA spacious bricked tunnel now led under the road to his stables\n\nand new kitchen gardens.\n\nWhether the stables were still in the area formerly leased from Mr\n\nBennett, we do not know, though there is a reference by Canon Jagger,53\n\nto the surrender of a strip to Mr. Bennett “which will save £50 per\n\nyear.” Bartlett,54 writing in 1865, tells us :\n\nThe stables were in the parish of Wimbledon, and now form\n\ncottages opposite the Nelson Arms, which are the property of J\n\nL Bennett, Esq., who retains a letter written by Lord Nelson to\n\nhis father, in which he agrees to the terms on which the stables\n\nwere to be leased.\n\n31\n\nHowever, Asher Goldsmid still appeared as the owner of property in\n\nboth Merton and Wimbledon in the Land Tax booksHowever, Asher Goldsmid still appeared as the owner of property in\n\nboth Merton and Wimbledon in the Land Tax books until 1825. Most\n\nof the Wimbledon property, apart from Hamnett Pinhey’s 9 acre Rose\n\nCottage estate, still belonged to Aaron Goldsmid in 1848, when the\n\nWimbledon Tithe Apportionment was made. By the 1890s an estate of\n\nterrace housing had been built in this area with roads named after\n\nNelson, Hamilton, Hardy, Trafalgar and Victory.\n\nGoldsmid was finally replaced in the Merton Land Tax register in 1826\n\nby the new owner, Charles Smith of Abbey Gate House. Charles Smith\n\nwas a joint-owner of the adjoining Merton Abbey estate, and until his\n\ndeath in 1827, lived at Abbey Gate House with his brother, Rear Admiral\n\nIsaac Smith R.N., reputed to have been the first Englishman to set foot\n\non Australasian soil, having served with Captain Cook on theEndeavour.\n\nCook’s widow, Elizabeth, a cousin of the Smith’s, also lived for some\n\ntime at Abbey Gate House, dying in 1833, two years after Rear Admiral\n\nSmith.\n\nIn 1844, when the Merton Tithe Apportionment was made, the 17½\n\nacres of Lot 2 are shown as part of the estate of Charles Mackrell\n\nSmith, great-nephew of Charles and Isaac Smith. It remained as farm\n\nland until the development of the factory estate between the two World\n\nWars.\n\nA small corner of open space remains near St. John’s church, with this\n\ninscription on a block of stone:\n\nAS A MEMORIAL OF\n\nLORD NELSON\n\nAND THE SPLENDID SERVICES WHICH HE RENDERED\n\nTO HIS COUNTRY THIS LAND (WHICH FORMED PART\n\nOF HIS MERTON ESTATE) WAS GIVEN ON THE\n\nFIRST CENTENARY OF HIS DEATH TO\n\nTHE MERTON PARISH COUNCIL FOR\n\nA PUBLIC RECREATION GROUND\n\nBY A GREAT NEPHEW OF THE LATE REAR ADMIRAL\n\nISAAC SMITH OF MERTON ABBEY\n\n30\n\nL A N D S\n\nL O R D V I S C O U N T\n\nFigure 5 – Map of Estate called Merton Abbey – 1805\n\nSketch by John Wallace from original in Surrey Record Office.39\n\n19\n\nPJH\n\nPJH\n\nFigure 10 – Extract from a Plan of Estates and Titheable lands at Merton\n\nFigure 6 – Map of Nelson’s Merton Place estate 1802 – 1805, in Surrey, The Property of E.

On 28th and\n\n29th May 1824, John Crook and William Furse had bought from Ann\n\nKeys, George Row and Frederick Waller a:\n\npiece or parcel of land or ground situate on the south side of the\n\nturnpike road leading from Merton to Kingston, abutting north\n\non the turnpike road, south on a new intended road to be called\n\nNelson Grove, and containing, in front of the said turnpike road\n\nand likewise in rear next said intended road to be called Nelson\n\nGrove, 125 feet and in depth on west side, abutting on ground\n\nsold to Mr E Smith, 325 feet and on east side abutting on another\n\nintended road leading from said turnpike road into Nelson Grove\n\nand into several other new roads, 325 feet …\n\nOn 6th and 7th October 1824 they sold it to Thomas Kelly for £369\n\n18s., and he left it to his nephews in 1855. They sold it on 28th October\n\n1863 to the British Land Co. for £400:\n\nall that piece of freehold land in Merton on south side of the\n\nturnpike road from Merton to Kingston abutting north on\n\nturnpike road, south on road called Nelson Grove – 125 feet in\n\nwidth, and on west side, abutting land sold to Mr E Smith, 325\n\nfeet and on east side, abutting on Pencot’s Road leading from\n\nthe turnpike road to Nelson Grove and several others, 325 feet,\n\nformerly part and parcel of a piece of land called the Vines.\n\nThus Nelson’s and Lady Hamilton’s “Paradise Merton”gave way to\n\nthe rows of Victorian housing known as “Nelson’s Fields”, now replaced\n\nby the High Path council estate. Nelson Grove Road was laid across\n\nthe actual site of Merton Place.\n\n28\n\nAccording to an indenture dated 4th March 1806,41 Nelson had obtained\n\nAxe’s estate, described as “the messuage or tenement, lands, and\n\nhereditaments lying and being in the parishes of Merton and Mitcham\n\nor one of them…”, by indenture of lease and release dated 7th and 8th\n\nNovember 1802 from William Axe, Ann his wife, and Samuel Axe.\n\n£4000 was paid to William Axe by Lord Nelson, and a further £4000,\n\nthe clear produce of £5873 2s. 9d. in 3% consolidated bank annuities,\n\nfrom Nelson’s brother William, later Earl Nelson, as trustee of the\n\nmarriage settlement of his sister, Catherine Matcham.42 Apparently,\n\none of Nelson’s last regrets, on the night he left Merton for the last time,\n\nen route for Trafalgar, was that he had not, so far, been able to repay\n\nhis brother-in-law, George Matcham. 43\n\nIn his will,20 dated 10th May 1803, Nelson left Merton Place to Emma\n\nHamilton, with part of the estate, while the remainder was to be sold to\n\nsettle his outstanding debts:\n\nI give unto the same Emma, lady Hamilton, her heirs and assigns,\n\nmy capital messuage at Merton, in the county of Surry [sic],\n\nand the out-houses, offices, gardens and pleasure grounds\n\nbelonging thereto, and such, parts of my grounds, farms, lands,\n\ntenements and hereditaments, in the several parishes of Merton,\n\nWimbledon, and Mitcham, or any of them, as, together with,\n\nand including the site of the said messuage, out-houses, offices,\n\ngardens, pleasure grounds, shrubbery, canal, and mote, shall\n\nnot exceed seventy-acres, as shall be selected by the said Emma,\n\nlady Hamilton, within six months after my decease. Such\n\nselection to be testified by some deed or instrument, in writing,\n\nunder her hand and seal.\n\nI further direct, that all money due on the security of the same\n\nmessuage and hereditaments, at my death, shall be paid out of\n\nmy personal estate, and out of the money arising from the sale\n\nof the residue of the said farm, under the direction herein after\n\ncontained, in exoneration of the said messuage and other\n\nhereditaments, so devised to, the said Emma, lady Hamilton, as\n\naforesaid.\n\n21\n\nEmma selected her 70 acres on 4th March 1806, and bought an additional\n\n2 acres from Nelson’s trustees. The deedEmma selected her 70 acres on 4th March 1806, and bought an additional\n\n2 acres from Nelson’s trustees. The deed includes a plan of Lady\n\nHamilton’s estate, surveyed by T Cracklow, which shows that a small\n\ncorner of the estate, “shaded brown, is purchased of the devisees in\n\ntrust of the late Lord Nelson by Lady Hamilton.” It is noted that some\n\nof Mr. Axe’s former estate formed “part of the hereditaments selected\n\nby and conveyed to the said Emma Hamilton.” Her estate is described\n\nas:1.\n\nthe house with pleasure grounds, etc. 19 3 29\n\n2.

Hon. William Earl Nelson and William\n\nHaslewood, devisee in trust and executors of the Rt. Hon. Horatio Lord\n\nViscount Nelson deceased; and Daniel Sturdy of Clapham (baker) and\n\nRobert Skelton (baker), and referred to:\n\nPiece of arable land of approximately 4 acres and another piece\n\nof arable land of approximately 4 acres, both now in clover, and\n\n4 tenements situate in the Parish of Merton on west side of\n\nMerton Turnpike Road. for release to Rt. Hon. Dame Emma\n\nHamilton.\n\nThis is presumably the block of land bounded by modern Kingston\n\nRoad on the north, Morden Road on the east, The Path on the south and\n\nBrisbane Avenue on the west. By 1844 Daniel Sturdy owned 5 acres\n\n(plots 203, 210-220), Charles Skilton 2 acres (plots 201-202) and James\n\nRolt almost 3 acres (plot 209). Along the northern edge of this land, on\n\nthe Kingston Road, were four tenements in the ownership of James\n\nKillick (plots 204-205), Matthew Taylor (plot 206), and James Oakman\n\n(plot 207). Part of the land was known as Crossways, the remainder\n\nAlmshouse Close, from the adjoining Rowland Wilson almshouse, the\n\nlast remnant of which survived to the 1950s.\n\nThe two Wimbledon fields not selected by Emma Hamilton, East Lords\n\nLease and West Lords Lease, gave rise to some confusion. On 19th\n\nMay 1807, Lord Nelson’s Trustees, William Earl Nelson and William\n\nHaslewood of Lincoln’s Inn, sold East Lords Lease, of 10 acres 14\n\nperches in Wimbledon to William Haslewood in trust for Thomas Bolton\n\nof Cranwich, Norfolk, for £900 to be paid out of his wife Susanna’s\n\nlegacy from Nelson, her brother. Meanwhile it was on mortgage to\n\nEarl Nelson as the surviving trustee of Bolton’s marriage settlement.5\n\nIn this deed the land is described as formerly Hotham, then Greaves,\n\nnow West, and the bounds are incorrectly described as:\n\non the north by lands of Richard Mansell Phillips\n\non the south by a common footpath\n\non the west by the high road from Wimbledon to Ewell and\n\non the east by a parcel late the property of Horatio Lord Viscount\n\nNelson deceased, now or late in the occupation of the said – West.\n\n24\n\nThese are actually the bounds of West Lords Lease. An endorsement\n\non this deed records William Haslewood’s release of East Lords Lease\n\non 7th September 1809,5 to Thomas Moxon in trust for Abraham\n\nGoldsmid, who paid Earl Nelson £900 and Thomas Bolton £10, and\n\nthe bounds were corrected to:\n\non the west by West Lords Lease\n\non the east by Dunsford Lane\n\non the north by lands of Richard Mansell Phillips\n\non the south by a common footpath [i.e. Quicks].\n\nAsher Goldsmid refers to this in his will,22 dated 4th April 1822 and\n\nproved 25th November 1822:\n\nthe residue being a piece or parcel called East Lords Lease\n\ncontaining 10 acres 4 perches in Wimbledon, not in hand, by\n\nindenture of lease and release dated 6th & 7th September 1809…\n\nThis was presumably plot 263 on the Tithe Apportionment Map, an\n\nunnamed meadow of 10 acres 1 perch, owned by Aaron Goldsmid,\n\nAbraham’s son. The adjoining plot 264, containing 9 acres 3 roods 25\n\nperches, owned by Reuben Fletcher, represents West Lord’s Lease.\n\nThe familiar references to the house, gardens and farms of Merton Place\n\nas comprising about 70 acres, of which 30 acres were in Wimbledon\n\nParish and 40 acres in Merton,45 refer only to that part left to Lady\n\nHamilton, described when offered for sale about 1808 as:-46\n\nLady Hamilton’s Villa at Merton, in the parishes of Wimbledon\n\nand Mitcham in the County of Surrey. The House with the\n\nOffices, Lawns, Shrubberies, Canals, Plantations, Farm House,\n\nBarns, Stables, Outbuildings Yards and Four Enclosures of land\n\nsituated together in a Ring Fence, and bounded on the north\n\nand west by the turnpike road from London and Epsom, and on\n\nthe east of Merton Abbey Lane; in the Parish of Mitcham [sic];\n\nand the Kitchen Garden, Gardener’s House, Plantation, and\n\nThree Enclosures of Meadow land lying all within a Ring Fence\n\nopposite the House, and bounded on the South by the said\n\nturnpike road, East by the road from Merton to Wandsworth,\n\nWest by the road from Merton turnpike, and North by the\n\nCommon footpath in the Parish of Wimbledon, which contains\n\ntogether seventy acres or thereabouts, and are all Freehold.\n\n25"
