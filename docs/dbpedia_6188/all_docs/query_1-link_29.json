For the most part (the major development \nround Gatwick Airport is one of the few \nexceptions), West Sussex remains an \nessentially rural landscape dominated by the \nSouth Downs, a magnificent range of chalk \nhills. The South Downs Way, a 100-mile \nbridleway along the crest of the hills from \nWinchester to Beachy Head, offers \npanoramic views across the Weald to the \nnorth and the sea to the south. It traces the \nlong history of this area along ancient trails, \npassing Bronze Age barrows and Iron Age \nhill forts. On the coast, Chichester, the \ncounty town, once a busy haunt of \nsmugglers, is now a thriving sailing centre, \nwhile the small fishing villages of the past are \nquiet holiday resorts like Littlehampton, \nBognor Regis and Worthing. The ancient \nwoodland of the West Sussex Weald is now a \nlandscape of pastures and hedgerows and \nsmall country villages. The trees were felled \nfor fuel to drive the furnaces of the iron \nindustry, which flourished here for centuries. \nThe legacy of this prosperous industry can \nbe seen in the wealth of elaborate buildings, \nparticularly churches, built from the profits. \n \nTravel Publishing has made available Free of Charge digital editions of its popular series of Guide Books. These are available with working hyperlinks and for free download for personal use from http://www.findsomewhere.co.uk/PDF/PDF.htm",
