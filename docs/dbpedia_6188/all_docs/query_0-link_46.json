        "text": "James Thomas Scott was born in Clerkenwell, London around 1825. Around 1847, James Scott married Amelia (born c1826, London) and set up home in Islington, where two daughters were born - Amelia (born 1849) and Alice (born 1852).\n\nBy 1855, James Scott and his family had moved down to the Sussex seaside resort of Bognor, where James Scott established himself as a tobacconist. (Melville's 1858 Directory of Sussex lists James Scott as a tobacconist on the Steyne at Bognor). Two sons were born to James and Amelia Scott during their stay in Bognor - Walter Osborne Scott, who was baptised at South Bersted church on 14th October 1855 and his brother Robert James Scott who was born in Bognor three years later in 1858, being baptised at the parish church of South Bersted on 3rd October 1858. James Scott was first recorded as a photographer in Bognor in 1859. The 1859 edition of Kelly's Directory of Sussex lists James Scott as a photographer at The Steyne, Bognor.\n\nIn the 1860s, James Scott established a photographic studio at Ryde on the Isle of Wight. It appears that from around 1865, Scott was the proprietor of The Isle of Wight Photographic Establishment in Monkton Street, Ryde, which was, according to newspaper advertisements, only \" two minutes walk from the Railway Station\". Kelly's Post Office Directory of Hampshire, including the Isle of Wight, issued in 1867, lists James Scott as a photographer in Monkton Street, Ryde. By the time the 1871 census was taken, James Scott was living with his wife and four children at 61 High Street, Ryde. The 1871 census records James Scott as a forty-six year old photographer. Hill's Commercial Directory of the Isle of Wight describes James Scott as a \"Photographer, stationer, tobacconist and news agent\" at 61 High Street, Ryde. When the 1881 census was taken, James Scott was recorded at his new studio at 21 High Street, Ryde. James Scott's wife Amelia, described on the census return as a \"Photographer's wife\", aged 55, is shown residing at a house in St Thomas's Square, Ryde, with her eldest daughter, thirty-two year old Amelia, and her two sons Walter Osborne Scott, aged 24, and Robert James Scott, aged 22. Also living in the Scott household was Mrs Amelia Scott's nine year old grand daughter, entered on the return as Nelly A. Scott. This child was apparently the illegitimate daughter of James Scott's eldest child Amelia Scott. (Nelly had been christened \"Nelly Amelia Elkins\" at All Saints Church, Ryde, on 26th January 1873. The baptism register records the mother of the child as Amelia Scott).\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, James Scott was assisted in his photography business by his two sons, Walter Osborne Scott (born 1855, Bognor) and Robert James Scott (born 1858, Bognor). In Kelly's 1875 Post Office Directory of Hampshire, including the Isle of Wight, Walter Scott was listed as a photographer under his own name at 21 High Street, Ryde and in Kelly's Directory of 1880, Walter is entered as a photographer at the family home in St Thomas' Square, Ryde. By 1883, Walter Scott had been joined in his photography business by his younger brother, Robert Scott. Stevens' Directory of the Isle of Wight, published in 1883, records the studio at 21 High Street, Ryde under the name of the \"Scott Brothers\". During this period, their sister, Miss Amelia Scott, was listed as a \"tobacconist\" at the same address.\n\nJames Thomas Scott died on the Isle of Wight in 1886 at the age of 61. [The death of James Thomas Scott was registered on the Isle of Wight during the 4th Quarter of 1886].\n\nAfter her husband's death in 1886, Mrs Amelia Scott moved to Wanstead in Essex with her younger son Robert. In the 1891 census, Robert J. Scott is recorded as a thirty-two year old photographer living with his widowed mother in Wanstead, Essex. By 1895, Robert James Scott had moved to the seaside resort of Bournemouth, where he established a photographic studio. In Kelly's 1895 Directory, Robert James Scott is listed as a photographer with a studio in Holdenhurst Road, Bournemouth. During the 2nd Quarter of 1900, Robert James Scott married farmer's daughter Violet Wilmington Locock (born 1874, Luppitt, near Honiton, Devon). In the 1901 census of Bournemouth, Robert J, Scott is recorded as a forty-two year old photographer. Robert James Scott ran a photographic studio in Holdenhurst Road, Bournemouth from 1895 until around 1920. After Robert Scott's death, the studio at 203 Holdenhurst Road, Bournemouth was continued by his widow Mrs Violet Scott. ( Kelly's 1923 Directory lists Mrs Robert James Scott as a photographer at 203 Holdenhurst Road, Bournemouth, Dorset)."
