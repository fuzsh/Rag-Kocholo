        "text": "It's rather sad when the main thing people generally know about a place is that a King swore at it in 1929.\n\nIt was King George V, who was convalescent after a lung operation. He was the severe-looking bearded gent who appeared on many of the older coins in my young life up to February 1971, when the old coinage (pounds, shillings and pence) was replaced by decimal coinage (pounds and pence) - and coins bearing the heads of a long line of kings and queens, all the way back to Queen Victoria on the oldest coins in circulation, suddenly disappeared.\n\nEverything I've ever heard about King George V tells me that he was in later life a touchy chap, not very patient. He would have hated being ill. He would have hated the court physicians telling him that a spot of sea air at Bognor on the Sussex coast would be beneficial, and having to comply with their orders as a matter of court protocol. He had to stay there for several months, and must have been fed up with the place by the end. So he would have despised the subsequent obsequious request from the town council at Bognor that 'Regis' (Latin for 'of the King') be added to the town's name, to mark 'his' gracious choice of holiday destination. In future it would be 'The King's Bognor', in mutual association for all time to come. Great for the town. Irksome for His Majesty.\n\nIn short, he had genuine cause to feel grumpy about Bognor, and although there is no proof that he ever did mutter the words 'Bugger Bognor!' whenever the town (and the vacation there) was mentioned, I am personally quite satisfied that he did.\n\nWell, Bognor got its change of name, and has proudly used it ever since. It really was quite a privilege. This has been the only modern example of a place being honoured with a 'Regis' tacked on. There weren't in fact many UK placenames that sported that 'Regis' element. Only fifteen. The West Country accounted for seven of that fifteen: Bere Regis, Brompton Regis, Kingsbury Regis, Lyme Regis, Melcombe Regis, Salcombe Regis and Wyke Regis. Half the national supply. Odd that.\n\nNowadays towns that aspire to a royal connection push to have 'Royal' put in front of the name, as happened not long ago with Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire. Before that, there were only two towns that were Royal-something: Royal Leamington Spa and Royal Tunbridge Wells. (If you are seriously interested in pursuing this subject, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_place_names_with_royal_patronage_in_the_United_Kingdom)\n\nAnd yet Bognor Regis might have been called something quite different: Hothamton ('Hoth' as in 'moth'). Originally a fishing village, the place was developed by enterprising Sir Richard Hotham in the late eighteenth century as a fashionable resort for the titled and wealthy, copying the success of Brighton and Eastbourne. But it never really took off as a posh haven for toffs, and the 'Hothamton' name didn't last. Instead, Bognor settled down into a Sussex beach town existence, with all the usual amenities, but no especial cachet. Sir Richard is still remembered: there is a Hotham Park. And no doubt, as Bognor gradually redevelops itself, more and more will be made of its historical aspirations and royal connections. I predict the George V CineCenta, and the Hotham Arena.\n\nSo what is Bognor Regis really like? Imagine a flat part of the coast - no cliffs - with a sloping shingle beach, and sand only at low tide. Imagine a tatty cut-down pier, a tired promenade, nondescript gardens, mundane car parks, a theatre that badly needs an upgrade, and an uninspiring town centre full of bargain outlets, mobile phone stores, nail bars and vaping shops. Imagine the best place in town, the neatly-maintained station with its frequent trains to other places, London included. Imagine also, beyond all this, a sprawl of admittedly decent residential housing in mostly quiet streets; and, on the main road in (the A29) a couple of retail parks with the usual superstores. Oh, and Butlin's for somewhere to stay on the weekend.\n\nI sound a bit dismissive, but really (just like King George V, and who better to take my cue from?) I don't rate Bognor highly, and don't go there very often. It's not rewarding enough for a casual visit. For similar sea coast, but with a nice riverside, and plenty of sandy beach thrown in, nearby Littlehampton wins every time. Neither is however on my A list of Sussex seaside destinations. I will admit that Bognor has more holiday amenities than, say, Seaford.\n\nAll this said, I do go to Bognor now and then. It pays to see it in the summer - when it's lively - or in the winter, whenever a good sunset is expected. I went for the sunset option the other day.\n\nThe setting sun cast a magical warmth on everything, and - at least if you stood back a bit - it made the seafront buildings look almost attractive. Some spray-painted hoardings caught my eye.\n\nI'm guessing that glum green face was a stylised moon, rather then a stylised holidaymaker.\n\nAmazing what you could do with spray cans. But where was Banksy?\n\nThe sun did its best with the 'traditional' but nevertheless insalubrious rock shop, ice cream parlours and amusement arcades.\n\nI didn't enquire which of those diet-busting dishes was the Old Age Pensioner Special. Even though, as you know, I easily qualify for one.\n\nThe sunset made the truncated pier look pretty good. It was in fact just a platform for a nightclub called Sheiks (as in Rudolf Valentino on a fine Arab charger). But one could ignore that conceit.\n\nI took shots on the pier, and underneath it. Thankfully, nobody was there, curled up in a sleeping bag.\n\nFurther along the promenade was an old bandstand, tarted up somewhat, but clearly a little-used relic from decades ago. I hung around, waiting for the right combination of silhouetted figures to walk past.\n\nNot as good as a shot I took back in 2000:\n\nActually, I've taken much better shots of Bognor's seafront in the past. Such as these from 2003 and 2006, which show that Bognor can look quite interesting:\n\nThe sun suddenly lost its intensity. It sank behind a bank of low cloud. I began to walk back to where I'd parked Fiona in a back street. On the way, I saw this blue plaque:\n\nWow. The Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti worked in there for a year or so! I wonder how they knew? It isn't in Wikipedia. He wasn't in the best of health by the later 1870s, and perhaps he too came to Bognor for some invigorating sea air.\n\nAs I walked back through the town streets, I was confronted by a young woman. 'Excuse me...' Our eyes met. I gave her a frank and very direct look. This plainly disconcerted her. I wanted my eyes to say that I wasn't a cold and nasty person, but I absolutely wasn't going to give her anything, and she ought to believe it and not waste her time. But she must have seen something else, something that confused her. So all she said next was 'Ummm...'\n\nSeizing the moment, I walked away, before she could get back on track with her usual spiel. It was puzzling: street beggars are usually quicker-witted and much more persistent. I haven't forgotten the kind I met in Plymouth when last there, who made me feel very uncomfortable, one man in particular. I have become hyper-defensive where such people are concerned, yet continue to be approached. I must still look a soft touch.\n\nHere's one last image that helps to sum up Bognor. It was in a bus shelter. A poster advertising a vaping brand.\n\nSigh. These adverts ought to be banned. You can say what you like, vaping is addictive. It's another form of smoking, and there will be unhealthy medical consequences down the line - even if a case can presently be made for vaping being negligibly injurious to the lungs and mouth, compared to tobacco-smoking. I noticed which shops were listed as suppliers: they were the shops where people with not much money tended to go. So the ad was targeted at the poor.\n\nWould I be a snob if I guessed that the kind of person who might react to such an ad wouldn't have a clear idea what the word 'exceptional' meant? Yes, I decided that it was snobbish (and elitist) to assume a lack of education. I shouldn't consider myself in any way better-informed. Or too astute to become a victim of advertising hype. Or above populist tastes.\n\nBut the approach from the girl for 'loose change', and this ad, and a number of other things I'd seen in my walk around the town and seafront, such as the seedy amusement arcades, gave me a bleak feeling inside. I didn't belong here. Bognor wasn't the town for me. It was time to go back to my own world in Mid Sussex.\n\nBugger Bognor.\n\nThat last post got me thinking about BT's telephone services in the past, and my memory drifted to 'Dial-a-Disc', which was something BT offered back in the 1970s and a while afterwards, although it disappeared many years ago. You phoned a short two- or three- digit number - the cost of this was small - and heard the Disc of the Day, which was always something lively from the Top Ten.\n\nIt was really rather cool to dial up a current pop song and listen to it on one's phone. It was even cooler to do it in the office, at the office expense, dialling '9' first to get an outside line. If anyone senior came near, you could pretend you were taking a regular phone call. All very naughty, of course; but I admit to listening to Dial-a-Disc in the office right at the beginning of my Inland Revenue career, when I was still in my late teens, and silly, and very intoxicated with the wicked new freedoms of adult life.\n\nThe chief opportunity to use Dial a Disc came on overtime. Anyone who was part of the 'clerical staff' - meaning (in ascending order of seniority) a Clerical Assistant, a Tax Officer, or a Tax Officer (Higher Grade) - I was a trainee TO(HG) at the time - was entitled to work overtime and be paid for it. It was useful money, and if your social life was barely off the ground, you had time to spare, and there was nothing on the telly that evening, a spot of easy overtime was just the ticket.\n\nWe were supervised by a trusted older officer, but working overtime was relaxed way of passing a few hours for the merry band of young reprobates who regularly did it. Honestly, we mucked about if we could, chatting and no doubt giggling. Dialling pop songs was the least of it. But I will add that we would always have something to show next day for the time put in, and there was absolutely no hanky-panky. Moreover, the records kept of the time put in were meticulous. They had to be good - on pain of disciplinary action from the stern and no-nonsense Management Inspector, an ex-CPO.\n\n'Meticulous?' you scoff. Well, I can back up what I say. I still have all my old overtime records for 1971 to 1975. Yes, I've kept them safe for over forty-five years. Indeed, I still have many old service records up in my attic. I have an idea that some of them might be regarded as documents that are subject to the Official Secrets Acts, so I'll be careful here! But I am pretty sure that personal handwritten records, on which my official payment and allowances claims were based, are probably outside the scope of the Acts. The claim forms themselves might not be. One day, certainly if I ever do move house, I will have to burn all these items.\n\nSo, in my attic are a collection of thick orange folders, set up some thirty years ago to hold various records together. One of them deals with 'Office Matters'...\n\n...with a subfolder for 'Overtime'...\n\n...and in that subfolder is a complete record of my overtime in Southampton 3 Tax Office, from 1st February 1971 right through to 14th March 1973, with additional stints in 1974 and 1975. I stopped doing overtime after 18th May 1975. I had just been selected for Technical Training, and would join the 'technical staff', who might well work unusually long hours on occasion, but could not claim extra payment for it.\n\nHere's the first page of eight:\n\nThat kind of lined paper (called '174D paper') was the original 'spreadsheet'. The storerooms of all tax offices had tons of it. I suspect it was very useful for keeping accounts at home, as well as for making year-by-year analyses in the office. Believe me, handwritten (or typed) spreadsheets were the thing long before Microsoft ever existed, or dreamed up Excel. In a pre-computer age, which in a local tax office meant pre-1990s, this is what you used.\n\nI'm sure you can see that if - following a deathbed confession, bragging in a pub, or the injudicious publication of a former Revenue officer's memoirs - it ever came to light that false claims to overtime had been rife in one or more of the six tax offices located in Southampton in the 1970s, all staff serving in them would immediately come under investigation. A criminal investigation. So I have kept hold of all my pay and allowances records, and hours-worked records - and especially records of expenses claimed - all this time. Just in case. Paranoid? Read on.\n\nThe Revenue always took a severe line with any dishonest member of staff who had, for instance, set up fake taxpayer files and claimed tax repayments payable to themselves, an alias, or a tame nominee. It was no different if it were 'only' filching notes and coin from in the office petty cash tin, or occasionally making use of the office postage stamp money. False claims to expenses were never laughed off: you'd be sacked. But you'd go through an ordeal first.\n\nOfficers from the Board's Investigation Office would come down from their citadel in London. They would be forthright and barely courteous in their enquiries. Anyone suspected would have a very testing experience. These inquisitors enjoyed their work. They used threat and fear to get a result. The guilty disappeared into an oubliette. Their associates, if found complicit but not actually guilty, were broken characters henceforth, never to achieve another promotion. If someone had already resigned, they were tracked down and prosecuted without mercy and without exception. Escape abroad was but a temporary reprieve: the BIO would wait, and hound them if they ever returned.\n\nProving innocence might depend on what you could show and say in your defence. There had to be credible, contemporary, detailed written records. If you had them, and they looked believable, and you survived the appallingly cold and fierce interview without making an inconsistent remark, then all might be well. If not, well...\n\nThis is why I never accepted any out-of-office position that involved handling money. And still wouldn't. A serving Revenue officer had to be stainless, and beyond any possibility of stain. I am absolutely sure this is true of a retired officer also, with a pension to lose.\n\nNot that I would worry if the entire staff serving in Southampton in the early 1970s came under suspicion. I still have those records. I can mount a convincing defence. And wouldn't the BIO (or whatever their current name is, now that the Inland Revenue is that hybrid monster, the HMRC) be surprised at their production?\n\nThis is what happened with Dr John Bodkin Adams. He was a medical practitioner in Eastbourne from the early 1930s until well into the 1950s. He inspired confidence, and was very popular with older patients in nursing homes and the like. Several wills were altered in his favour, and he accepted gifts from grateful patients. He sometimes seemed to seek these things. The patients died, and some said he had hastened their deaths with lethal overdoses of drugs like morphine. There were rumours, and the police heard of them, and mounted a murder investigation. In due course, Dr Adams faced trial. It was a celebrated case.\n\nI first heard of it when reading the book on the left in my photo below.\n\nLater, I got hold of the book on the right. Lord Devlin was the judge in the case and heard all the evidence. On the back of the cover is this shot of the doctor himself, after the trial. He had an avuncular manner, apparently.\n\nDr Adams' defence hinged on proving that he prescribed and administered only moderate and medically-justifiable amounts of painkillers and other such drugs to the elderly patients in his care. The witnesses for the prosecution included a renowned medical expert and nurses of impeccable character and experience, who had actually looked after the patients under Dr Adams' instructions. Their evidence was damning. Basically, it was that Dr Adams had made sure that drugs were administered in such amounts that death was certain. And the expert asserted that such amounts could never be appropriate. The accusation was that he had hastened these deaths for personal gain - the money willed to him.\n\nBut Dr Adams was acquitted. For his defence team discovered the old records of what had been administered, written by these very nurses, lying forgotten in a surgery cupboard. Nobody guessed these records still existed. It caused a sensation when they were produced in court. The barrister for the defence used them to tear apart the nurses' recollection of the amounts given to the patients, proving that Dr Adams hadn't acted murderously. And he skilfully neutralised the expert opinion.\n\nSo: old records matter!\n\nAnd Dial-a-Disc? I don't know when it stopped being available. But I listened to it for only a couple of years: 1971 and 1972. The sound quality was awful. It was much better to hear the Top Ten on the radio - or once a week on TV, on Top of the Pops. And in between, cassette tapes. I fancy that BT withdrew it sometime in the early 1980s. Probably as the Sony Walkman took off. An early example of modern 'new tech' ousting an outmoded service."
