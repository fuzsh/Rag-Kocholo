        "text": "Historical view\n\nPolish trade commercial office was opened in Kuala Lumpur in the second half of 1972 and later in 1973 raised to the rank of an embassy. From December 1971 to November 1978, the ambassadors of the Polish People’s Republic (PPR) in Indonesia based in Jakarta, were accredited to Malaysia. Adam Świtkowski was the first ambassador of the PPR residing in Kuala Lumpur. Initially, the ambassadors of Malaysia in the USSR based in Moscow, were accredited to Poland. The Embassy of Malaysia in Warsaw has been open on November 4, 1977.\n\nDuring the PPR times, there were several significant visits of the representatives of both countries. In September 1972, Malaysia's Prime Minister - Tun Haji Abdul Razak bin Dato 'Hussein had paid a visit to Poland. The most important visit of a representative of the Polish People's Republic to Malaysia was the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister - Zbigniew Szałajda in 1986.\n\nPolitical cooperation after 1989\n\nThere are no contentious points in Polish-Malaysian political relations. The relations have been developing properly and various visits from representatives of both countries are the evidence of it. Prime Minister Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz paid a visit to Malaysia in 1996, while President Aleksander Kwasniewski paid an official visit in 1999. In 2005, Prime Minister Marek Belka paid an official visit to Malaysia. And in 2002, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Bin Mohammad paid a visit to Poland. As part of bilateral political contacts, talks at the level of deputy ministers took place in 2011-2013 and 2015. In July 2013, Malaysia Foreign Minister Anifah Aman paid a visit to Poland. In 1989, contacts were also established between the parliaments of both countries. In recent years, good contacts have been established between the defense ministries and the armed forces, and in Malaysia the Polish Defense Attaché has been accredited. Concluded in 2003, Bumar's contract for the supply of 48 Polish PT-91M tanks was finalized in 2010. The contract for tanks and associated equipment amounted to approximately USD 368 million. Another project implemented in Malaysia is the contract of the Polish company WB Electronics for 257 set of Fonet internal communication for the Malaysian wheeled vehicle AV 8 GEMPITA."
