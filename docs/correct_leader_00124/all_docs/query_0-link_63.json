        "text": "Tun Abdul Razak Order: 2nd Prime Minister of Malaysia Term of Office: September 22, 1970 - January 14, 1976 Date of Birth: March 11, 1922 Date of Death: January 14, 1976 Place of Birth Pekan, Pahang Place of Death Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Wife Tun Rahah Tan Sri Noah Occupation Lawyer Political Party: UMNO Deputy PM: Tun Hussein Onn (1970 - 1976)\n\nTun Abdul Razak bin Dato' Hussein Al-Haj (1922-1976) was the second Prime Minister of Malaysia, ruling from 1970 to 1976. Born in Pulau Keladi, Pahang on March 11, 1922, Tun Razak is the only child to Dato' Hussein bin Mohd Taib and Hajah Teh Fatimah bt Daud.\n\nOf aristocratic descent, Abdul Razak studied at the Malay College in Kuala Kangsar. After joining the Malay Administrative Service in 1939, he was awarded a scholarship to study at Raffles College in Singapore in 1940. His studies at the college ceased with the onset of the Second World War.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Tun Razak left for Britain in 1947 to study law. In 1950 he received a Degree of an Utter Barrister from Lincoln's Inn in London. During his student days in England, Tun Razak was a member of the British Labour Party and a prominent student leader of the Kesatuan Melayu Great Britain (Malay Association of Great Britain). He also formed the Malayan Forum, an organisation for Malayan students to discuss their country's political issues.\n\nUpon his return, Tun Razak joined the Malayan Civil Service. Owing to his political caliber, he became the youth chief for United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Two years later, he worked as the Assistant State Secretary of Pahang and in February 1955, at just 33 years of age, became Pahang's Chief Minister. He stood in and won the country's first general elections in July 1955 and was appointed as the Education Minister. Tun Razak was also a member of the February 1956 mission to London to seek the independence of Malaya from the British.\n\nAfter the general elections in 1959, he became the Minister of Rural Development in addition to holding the portfolios of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. His achievements include formulating the development policy known as the Red Book. On September 1970, Tun Razak succeeded Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra as the Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nAfter the May 13th incident in 1969, his faction in UMNO overthrew Tunku Abdul Rahman and imposed a State of Emergency, ruling by decree until 1970. On September 1970, Tun Razak succeeded Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra as the Prime Minister of Malaysia.\n\nTun Razak is also renowned for launching the Malaysian New Economic Policy(MNEP) in 1971. He and the \"second generation\" of Malay politicians saw the need to tackle vigorously the economic and social disparities which fuelled racial antagonism. The MNEP set two basics goals - to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty, and to reduce and eventually eradicate identification of economic function with race.\n\nTun Razak set up the National Front on January 1, 1973 to replace the ruling Alliance Party. He increased the membership of its parties and coalitions in an effort to establish \"Ketahanan Nasional\" (National Strength) through political stability.\n\nDue in part to leukemia, Abdul Raak passed away on January 14, 1976 while seeking medical treatment in London. He was posthumously granted the soubriquet Bapa Pembangunan (Father of Development).\n\nFamily\n\nAbdul Razak was descended from a long line of Pahang chieftains of Bugis descent. He was a brother in law of Tun Hussein Onn, his successor as Prime Minister.\n\nAbdul Razak's son, Najib Tun Razak, became the Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia under Abdullah Badawi in 2004. He has another son, Datuk Ahmad Johari Razak, who in turn have several children with their spouses."
