        "text": "Biografi Tun Abdul Razak: Negarawan dan Patriot oleh Nik Anuar Nik Mahmud, Muhammad Haji Salleh dan Abd. Ghapa Harun. Bangi, Selangor: Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia dan Yayasan Tun Razak, 2011, 401 pp. ISBN 978-967-942-956-5 9 (paperback)\n\nTun Abdul Razak Dato' Hussein is remembered by Malaysians as the \"father of development.\" In fact he was closely associated with development and changing the mindset of the rural Malays since 1955 when he was acting as Chief Minister (Menteri Besar) of Pahang.

This followed a struggle for power in UMNO soon after the demise of his deputy, the capable and highly principled Tun Dr. Ismail Abdul Rahman, in August of 1973.3 He was weighed down both by the coterie of his inner circle, which failed to provide effective advice, and by his deteriorating health.4\n\nDespite his stature in post-war Malaysian politics there are not many biographical studies on Tun Abdul Razak.
