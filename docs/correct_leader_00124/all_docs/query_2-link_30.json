        "text": "Najib Razak was long regarded as Malaysian political aristocracy.\n\nBut in 2018, the then prime minister lost a general election to his former mentor, 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad. The Barisan Nasional coalition, which had governed the country since its independence in 1957, was voted out of power.\n\nFollowing the defeat, Najib's properties were raided, and both he and his wife were charged with a string of offences.\n\nHe has since been found guilty on seven charges of corruption linked to the multibillion-dollar state investment fund, 1MDB. Najib could face decades in prison.\n\nNajib has always denied the allegations and while still in office had been cleared by the country's authorities.\n\nBut his time in office will likely be remembered as an era plagued with scandal and a strengthening of central power.\n\nNajib initially promised a more liberal political approach, but did not really follow through.\n\nWhile he reformed tough laws on public gatherings and repealed the controversial Internal Security Act in 2011, he later reinstated detention without trial.\n\nThe following year, he also went back on a pledge to repeal a controversial sedition law and instead strengthened it.\n\nCritics say the laws were a way for Najib to silence his political opponents and to pander to the ethnic Malay-Muslim majority who formed his political party's largest support base.\n\nOpposition leader and former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was convicted of sodomy for a second time in 2015, charges Mr Anwar maintained were politically motivated.\n\nThe opposition politician has since been pardoned by the new prime minister and is seen as a likely successor to Mr Mahathir."
