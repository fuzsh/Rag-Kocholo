purpose as aforesaid: Provided that the act of such officer or person was done in good faith and in a reasonable belief that it was necessary for the purpose intended to be served

force.\n\n9.\n\nEvery person who contravenes any regulation made under this Ordinance shall, where no other penalty is provided by such regulation, be liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both.\n\nDIRECTION UNDER ARTICLE 150(4) OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION\n\nWHEREAS Article 150 (4) of the Federal Constitution
