        "text": "LETTER | Former prime minister, the late Abdul Razak Hussein was a politician and civil servant who understood well the need to be circumspect and was known as Bapa Pembangunan (Father of Development).\n\nHe said, “Let us consider what is development. Development means, first and foremost, a change. A change of attitude and a change of mind”.\n\nCivil servants, he said, are independent and must express their views even if ithey may be unpalatable to the ministers.\n\nCivil servants continue in office even though there is a change of government, therefore they must be impartial and free from political influence. To do it will be against the known practice in a democratic country.\n\nTradition, convention, self-criticism and self-improvement are virtues which should be cultivated in the civil service.\n\nDuring Razak’s days, our civil service was second to none in Asia. He advanced the concept of official duties flowing beyond departmental boundaries into the stream of national endeavour for the betterment of our country.\n\nHe added, the two main cornerstones of government policy are the maintenance of law and order and economic and financial stability. He also welcomed free speech and freedom of the press while promoting peace, justice and prosperity.\n\nRazak was dedicated to integrity and honesty in public office and shunned all manner of corruption. He was obsessed, for example, with ensuring that not a cent of government funds was used to pay for his personal needs.\n\nHe appealed to the people to rededicate themselves to certain ideals which would transcend race, religion, culture, class and political affiliations.\n\nComing to the present, the countdown to D-Day (Nov 19) has begun.\n\nThe Spartacus-like battle cry is to give the people the mandate to restore stability and prosperity. Candidates must meet the criteria of “wali” that are winnable, acceptable and likeable - an Arabic word meaning guardian, custodian, protector or helper.\n\nSurely all political parties would like to field candidates with such qualities. Do not stop there. Would they also have the criteria expected by our Bapa Pembangunan who wants a change of attitude, no political influence on civil servants, integrity and honesty in public office, shunning all manner of corruption and ideals which would transcend race, religion, culture, class and political affiliations?\n\nWould taking pictures at the polling booth as proof of whom they voted for and then claiming money happen again?\n\nA free, fair and credible election would guarantee good governance and economic development because inducement to influence any election would bring into power the wrong people and government for the next five years.\n\nShunning graft, advocating ethics\n\nWhose manifesto will include shunning corruption and halting any attempt to perpetuate it? Who would advocate ethics, social norms and good values and who would oppose the abuse of power?\n\nWhich coalition will be the trendsetter in being transparent on political funding? In the meantime, MACC should not be resting and be more proactive.\n\nIs it true we are morally, intellectually, culturally and religiously corrupt?\n\nThe media should do its part in providing space to condemn corrupt practices, especially during this period.\n\nWe have heard rhetoric like restore stability and prosperity. We do not need subjective statements but be more objective and quantify, where possible. Development or prosperity should not focus only on material gains but also on the human, cultural and religious aspects of our lives.\n\nWhose manifesto is going to change the existing mediocre mindset of voters and embrace objectivism, professionalism and ensure peace, justice and long-term prosperity?\n\nWhose manifesto is going to say we are grooming our children to be society builders and not rent-seekers? Further, there are many cases of people in authority who do not allow young talent to emerge, for fear of being overshadowed or having their power bases eroded.\n\nDon’t promise the sky but also promise how to tackle all the shortcomings that have been highlighted. Since you are giving the people the mandate, you must listen and follow what people want to get done.\n\nBeing a dominant party is not the voters’ dreams, needs and wants. Voters need and want our children and grandchildren to have a better life and be proud of us in the years to come.\n\nAs they progress in our absence, they can say with pride in their hearts that we did not fail them and chose the right leaders.\n\nOne day we are going to assemble and give an account of what we did during our earthly sojourn.\n\nSo, what are we going to say in front of our Maker. What say you?\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini."
