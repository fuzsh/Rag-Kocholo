        "text": "Synopsis :\n\nThis live commentary gives a descriptive account of the funeral of Malaysia's second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak bin Hussein who died in office on 14 January 1976 in London. He was there for medical treatment.\n\nSeveral commentators stationed at different points along the route of the funeral motorcade look back at key milestones in Tun Razak's political career. They also provide eye witness accounts of the solemn mood amongst the people who have come to catch a glimpse of the motorcade and pay their last respects to the late Prime Minister.\n\nThe commentary begins in Parliament House where the Prime Minister's widow, Toh Puan Rahah, their five children, other family members and numerous government officials and dignitaries are gathered. They include the new Prime Minister Dato Hussein Onn and the Sultan and other officials from Tun Razak's home state of Pahang.\n\nThe motorcade moves from Parliament House, past the Sultan Abdul Samad Building where government offices are located and on to the Masjid Negara or National Mosque for the burial at the Makam Pahlawan or Heroes' Mausoleum near the mosque. This is the final resting place of several Malaysian politicians.\n\nThe commentator says that Tun Abdul Razak will be laid to rest at 1.30 pm after Friday prayers."
