        "text": "This represents a significant contribution to the formation of educated citizens, the training of manpower necessary for the national development of Malaysia, and an important contribution to Malaysian-American understanding.\n\nSince 1987, Ohio University’s Vernon L. Alden library has been designated by the Malaysian government as the sole repository for Malaysian materials in North America. The Malaysian Resource Center houses the finest research collection on Malaysia in the Americas and contributes to the dissemination of knowledge and understanding about Malaysia and Southeast Asia in the United States by lending thousands of books to users throughout North America each year.\n\nOhio University is acknowledged as the pioneer of “twinning” of higher education institutions in Malaysia. Ohio University began its historic relationship with the MARA Institute of Technology (now UiTM) in 1968. Ohio University was privileged to collaborate with UiTM as it developed into one of the most influential institutions of higher learning in Malaysia and contributed to the establishment of its business school.\n\nOhio University launched its cooperative OU-UiTM Bachelor of Business Administration program in 1975. The Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Executive MBA (EMBA) programs were developed afterward. In 1994, Ohio University became the largest producer of MBA and EMBA graduates in Malaysia through its partnership with UiTM. This helped Malaysia address a critical manpower shortage identified by Malaysia national development planners. These programs were phased out as UiTM began to offer its own degree programs.\n\nOhio University’s now completed corporate MBA program with Tenaga Nasional Berhad in Selangor represented a pioneering partnership between higher education and the private sector in Malaysia. The program was subsequently replicated with the Sarawak Civil Service in Kuching.\n\nFifteen senior Malaysian scholars have held the Tun Abdul Razak Chair since 1981 and have developed first-hand knowledge of the American people and American society by living and working in the U.S. More than 100 Ohio University professors have taught and conducted academic activities in Malaysia, resulting in a substantial cadre of American scholars with first-hand knowledge of Malaysia by having lived in the country and forged personal connections."
