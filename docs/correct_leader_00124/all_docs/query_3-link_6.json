        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Tun Abdul Razak Chair at Ohio University is the only one of its kind in the United States of America. Named in honor of the second Prime Minister of Malaysia and established in 1979 with funds provided by the Malaysian government, Ohio University, and 38 private American and Malaysian corporations, the Tun Abdul Razak Chair at Ohio University has brought unique opportunities to advance greater knowledge and awareness of Malaysian history, culture, economic, social and political life in the United States.\n\nThe Malaysian government has placed education at the heart of their development planning. Guided by visionary leaders like Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, Tun Abdul Razak bin Hussein, Tun Hussein Onn, Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib Tun Abdul Razak, and the current Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysians have progressively built an educational infrastructure and a national education system that have sent thousands of their best and brightest to study abroad, and they have linked their education policies to their overall national development plans (Vision 2020).\n\nThe Tun Abdul Razak Chair at Ohio University as a reflection of Malaysia’s commitment to higher education\n\nFor Ohio University, it has been a source of great pride to have been entrusted by the Malaysian government with the education of many of its citizens and to have been able to build strong educational partnerships with many Malaysian educational institutions. More than 2,400 Malaysians have degrees from Ohio University. The unique partnership with Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) has been a special source of satisfaction and we are highly honored by the opportunity we had in assisting ITM (now UiTM) develop as a modern university, particularly its business and communication school. UiTM has now attained international recognition as a leading university in Southeast Asia. We are also very proud of our partnership with Tenaga Nasional and with the Sarawak Civil Service that resulted in many Malaysians earning business degrees.\n\nThe Chair program brings a senior Malaysian scholar to Ohio University for up to a two-year appointment. The Chair’s primary role is to teach and conduct research at Ohio University in Athens, OH; to perform regional, national, and international outreach activities; and to assist in organizing the Razak Lecture held in Malaysia. In the last nearly four decades, serving as the intellectual envoy of Malaysia to the U.S., 15 Chairs have contributed to strengthening partnerships between the two countries, educated numerous Ohio University students on topics related to Malaysia or Southeast Asia, paved ways for Ohio University faculty to travel to Malaysia, and held numerous symposium and conferences at Ohio University and in Malaysia.\n\nExamples of activities in which Tun Abdul Razak Chairs participate include:"
