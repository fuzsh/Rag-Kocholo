        "text": "Glenwood Springs, notable for its healing hot springs, was brimming with potential as a destination for travelers and locals alike – and early settlers capitalized on this potential.\n\nDevereux sought to attract the wealthy and elite to his “Grande Dame,” as Hotel Colorado was fondly called at the time. A 185-foot tall fountain of water marked the center of the courtyard, and a European-style spa was an attractive draw for health-seekers during the early years of Hotel Colorado. No expense was spared in the construction of the hotel, which included amenities and attractions like tennis courts, a Victorian garden, a bird sanctuary, and a stunning indoor waterfall. The hotel has been used as a temporary White House, as a place of healing for the U.S. Navy during the World War II years, and a community focal point from its inception. Ownership changed hands frequently until the early 1990s, when the hotel was gradually restored to its former glory.\n\nToday, Hotel Colorado is a beautiful step back in time, inviting you to enjoy the cool mountain air, healing hot springs, exceptional service, and memories made with your loved ones. We look forward to our next 125 years of providing legendary hospitality.\n\nIn 1905, Hotel Colorado became the temporary home for the President of the United States and his assistants during a three-week bear hunting expedition. Already a fan of the state of Colorado, Roosevelt stayed at the Hotel Colorado on multiple occasions.\n\nOn a three-week trip in January 1901, the then-Vice-President hunted mountain lion on the Keystone Ranch near Meeker. It was reported by his guide that Colonel Roosevelt hung over a cliff to shoot a wounded lion between the eyes. Roosevelt’s first trip to Glenwood Springs delighted him so much that he returned year after year.\n\nAccording to legend, the world’s most irresistible toy, the teddy bear, received its birth at Hotel Colorado. To cheer Theodore Roosevelt after an unsuccessful day of hunting, Hotel Colorado maids presented him with a stuffed bear pieced together with scraps of fine material. Later, when he did bag a bear, his daughter Alyce admired it saying, “I will call it Teddy.” The term caught on and became the name for the world’s most popular toy, the Teddy Bear. We invite you to join us in Legends Trading Company to see the latest Teddy Bear collectibles."
