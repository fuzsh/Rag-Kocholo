This is exactly the feeling you get when you enter the iconic Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. It’s easy to picture that you are following in the footsteps of so many famous people before you, such as Theodore Roosevelt and Al Capone. Best of all, it’s only a short day trip from Denver!\n\nWe spent one night in the iconic Hotel Colorado during our visit to Glenwood Hot Springs.\n\nHotel Colorado & Hot Springs History\n\nThe Hotel Colorado has been a favorite lodging choice in Glenwood Springs, CO since its opening in 1893. The area was purchased by Walter Devereux who was told of the hot springs in the area and he immediately saw it as an incredible business opportunity.\n\nThe pool surrounding the hot springs was actually constructed first and caught the attention of many elite members of society at the time, which only increased the need for a hotel in the area.\n\nThe hotel was modeled after Villa De Medici in Italy and cost a total of $850,000 to build at the time according to The Hotel Colorado today!\n\nUpon opening, the hotel was visited by many guests from all over.\n\nSome of the most notable guests were President William Howard Taft, President Warren Harding, President Herbert Hoover, Al Capone, Doc Holliday and, of course, President Theodore Roosevelt. Some even say that the infamous serial killer, Ted Bundy, hid in the basement after he escaped from jail.\n\nDuring our visit, we were told by a staff member of President Roosevelt’s stay at the hotel for a hunting trip and how the “teddy bear” came to get its name. Apparently President Roosevelt was very discouraged that his hunt left him empty handed so the staff, to make the President feel better, sewed together a small bear for him that they nicknamed “Teddy”, hence giving rise to the famous “Teddy Bear”. Pretty cute, right?\n\nDuring World War II, the Hotel Colorado was used as a medical facility and all of the fancy, expensive features and carpets were removed and each guest room was transformed into patient hospital rooms. The basement of the hotel was the site of a morgue during this time as well, which fuels the rumors that the hotel is haunted.\n\nAfter Walter Devereux, the hotel has changed ownership several times. It’s most recent renovations have taken the hotel back to some of the original Victorian decor style and each of the major rooms, such as the grand ballroom, Roosevelt Suite and the like have their own theme reminiscent of what the room was originally used for. Some of the original hardwood floors, fireplaces and hidden doorways were also uncovered during the restoration.\n\nHotel Colorado Accommodations\n\nWhile staying at the Hotel Colorado you can choose one of the classic rooms or one of the signature suites. Either way, you will be immersed in classic Victorian décor with gorgeous mountain views. We stayed in a classic queen room.\n\nOne of the hotel’s signature, more luxurious rooms is called the Roosevelt Suite. Located on the second floor and boasting a statue of the former President outside the door it is hard to miss the quarters where this President once stayed. We stayed in a classic room on the second floor and walked right by it!\n\nThe Hotel Colorado is also pet-friendly (with some limitations and subject to an extra fee)!\n\nDining at the Hotel Colorado\n\nThe Hotel Colorado has three dining options to choose from.\n\nThe first is Legends Coffee and Gift Shop for your quick coffee stop before heading out for the day!\n\nNext, is Coppertop Bar & Indoor Lounge which serves tapas and cocktails. The Coppertop bar is open seasonally but the indoor lounge is open all year.\n\nThe main dining room is Hotel Colorado Restaurant & Bar. We had breakfast before we checked out and I ate the most delicious Denver omelet ever!\n\nHotel Colorado Packages\n\nThe Hotel Colorado offers several different package options during your stay.\n\nThe most popular is probably the package that includes day passes to the Glenwood Hot Spring pool, the largest hot spring in the world! During our visit, in September of 2021, we were told that there were no packages available that included admission to the hot springs pool, but the hotel’s website states otherwise. So it’s probably best to double check before you book.\n\nAnother great family friendly package option is the Adventure Park Package to Glenwood Caverns. Included with your stay are tickets for the gondola ride to the top of the mountain, unlimited rides and two cave tours.\n\nIf you like to ski, they also offer a Ski Swim Stay package where you can ski at the Sunlight Mountain Resort and then come back and swim, or soak, in the hot springs pool.\n\nInterested in staying at Hotel Colorado? Book your stay HERE!\n\nIs Hotel Colorado Haunted?\n\nNow for the fun, or maybe scary, part!!! There is a lot of speculation that the Hotel Colorado is haunted and you can find a lot of funny things happening inside the hotel walls.\n\nPeople state that lights flicker for no reason, that they smell cigar smoke out of nowhere, objects vanish and then reappear and they even catch glimpses of the ghosts. The hotel was once the site of a murder, a fatal accident involving a young girl falling from a balcony, and a morgue – all of which fuel the rumors.\n\nWhen Kory booked this hotel for our stay I had no idea that we were about to stay in a haunted hotel. Needless to say, I was not happy. One thing about me is I am deathly terrified of seeing a ghost. According to the hotel staff, all of the ghosts here at Hotel Colorado are friendly and playful and there is no foul play involved.\n\nThere are several notable ghosts that reside within the walls of Hotel Colorado. Many claim that the scent of cigar smoke is from the former owner Walter Devereux.\n\nThe staff also told us of a story that there were some renovations taking place in one of the rooms and each night the wallpaper that was put up earlier that day was neatly taken off the walls and folded up on the floor. After several nights of this, the construction workers figured that Mr. Devereux still wanted a say in the decor in his hotel so they laid out three different wallpaper choices and, sure enough, the next day when they came back there was only one laying on the floor while the others were neatly folded up in the corner of the room.\n\nOther ghosts within these walls are that of a nurse who was working during the time of World War II when the hotel was transformed into a hospital and a morgue. She was murdered in a love triangle by one of her jealous lovers. There is also a little girl who fell to her death from a balcony and a housekeeper who likes to pack and unpack guests’ clothing.\n\nThe most paranormal activity is said to be in the guest rooms on the 3rd and 5th floors — thankfully we stayed on the 2nd! As well as in the basement, which was the site of the morgue.\n\nI did not experience anything paranormal during our stay. I did think that I saw the lights flicker when I was taking a shower, but I think my imagination was playing tricks on me … maybe!\n\nWould you stay at the Hotel Colorado if you knew it was a haunted hotel?
