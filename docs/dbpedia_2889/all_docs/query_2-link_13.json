        "text": "Year Listed: 2023\n\nCounty: Jefferson\n\nConstruction Date: 1913\n\nThreat When Listed: Demolition by Neglect, Abandonment, Vandalism\n\nThe South Platte Hotel is under imminent threat of demolition. It is currently managed by Denver Water, which has owned the area near the confluence of the South Platte River and its North Fork. The South Platte Hotel is located in the North Fork Historic District and was an important stop on the Denver, South Park, and Pacific Railroad. The hotel has been abandoned and neglected for decades and is vulnerable to vandalism and damage from weather exposure.\n\n“While the Hotel has served many purposes over the years, what remains vital is the significance of the South Platte Hotel in a historic sense and recognizes the critical piece of railroad history that was a dynamic force in the settlement and economic growth of Colorado.” -Elaine Hayden, Evergreen Mountain Area Historical Society\n\nThe South Platte Hotel was built in 1913 after the original 1887 building was destroyed by arson. The hotel and townsite are emblematic of Colorado’s narrow gauge railroad history, early tourism and summer cabin communities, and small hotels located along stagecoach and rail lines. Denver Water has owned the site since 1987 but has never gained approval for construction of the Two Forks Dam.\n\nStrong support for preservation exists in the local community and the building has potential for adaptive reuse that supports popular nearby recreational activities which now define the valley and its communities. Potential partners include Jefferson County Historical Commission, Conifer Historical Society and Museum, Denver Water, Evergreen Mountain Area Historical Society, Pine/Elk Creek Improvement Association, History Jeffco, and Jefferson County Open Space.\n\nAdditional Links:\n\nSouth Platte Hotel 8th Grade Assessment\n\nPreservation for a Changing Colorado\n\nHistoric preservation has a direct economic benefit to communities and Colorado! Take a look at the 2017 study, which considered the ways adaption of historic places has a direct financial effect on the state.\n\nThis updated, most resent study, was the result of a partnership between Colorado Preservation, Inc and History Colorado, funded by a grant from History Colorado's State Historical Fund. Prepared by Clarion Associates, the new report document the economic benefits of rehabilitation projects, analyzes property values and neighborhood stability in local historic districts, and summarizes the increasing impact of heritage tourism, private preservation development and the success of Colorado’s Main Street program.\n\nIn a key finding, researchers determined that for every $1 million spent on historic preservation in Colorado it produced $1.03 million in additional spending, 14 new jobs, and $636,700 in increased household incomes across the state!\n\nThe 2017 report also considers the important role preservation plays in helping Coloradans provide new spaces for creative communities and co-working, create and sustain meaningful places, responds to the state’s changing demographics, and addresses climate concerns.\n\nClick Here to see download and read the full report, \"Preservation for a Changing Colorado\"."
