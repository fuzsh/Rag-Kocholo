        "text": "The texture and rhythm of its sculptural façade is strongly tied to its hotel function. Each vertical scallop is the width of a guest room, and its distinctive windows change in size and shape in response to the character of the building’s public and private spaces.\n\nAt the building’s base, the windows are the scale of portals 30 feet in height, framing entrances and views into the lobby, restaurant, and amenity spaces. In the hotel rooms above, guests enjoy immersive views of the nearby State Capitol, Civic Center Park, and the mountains through windows that become occupiable, transforming into seating and bringing guests closer to the outdoors.\n\nThe window shapes are informed by the characteristic patterns found on Aspen trees (Populus tremuloides). As the trees grow, they shed their lower branches, leaving behind dark, eye-shaped marks on the papery bark of their trunks. The windows are further detailed to perform efficiently in the Denver climate. On the exterior, the “lids” of each window stretch outward to shade the interior, while also channeling rainwater.\n\nDeepening the building’s commitment to sustainability, Populus promotes density downtown by activating the entirety of its compact, triangular footprint. The concrete structure minimizes cement by incorporating fly ash and forgoes any levels dedicated to parking—a first for a development downtown—encouraging visitors toward greener modes of transport. With a green roof providing an attractive habitat for local wildlife and insects, Populus aims to reconnect city dwellers with nature in the heart of Denver."
