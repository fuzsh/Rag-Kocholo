        "text": "The Mining Exchange hotel in downtown Colorado Springs, originally established in 1902 as the stock exchange for gold and silver, has debuted an extensive renovation. The property now sports a living room-style lobby, 128 redesigned guestrooms, two new F&B concepts, and indoor-outdoor meeting and event spaces. New guest experiences include a Crystal Concierge, art-centric programming and wellness activations. Plans call for a refresh of the full-service spa.\n\nGuestrooms showcase the historic building’s high ceilings, exposed brick and large windows. Each guestroom includes commissioned art from Emma Kelly, a native of Colorado Springs known for her plein air paintings, custom wingback armchairs and oak desks, a Bluetooth speaker, walk-in showers and more.\n\nIn addition to the standard King and double Queen guestrooms in Bronze, Silver and Gold categories that relate to their square footage, guests can choose from the top-floor Mining Club Rooms offering amenities and services inspired by the gilded era; two Foundation Suites with light-filled living areas and king bedrooms with expansive windows; Remedy Suites complete with deep soaking tubs, a Himalayan salt lamp, spa products and a separate living room; and Retreat Suites complete with a living room, powder room, double queen bedroom and en-suite bathroom.\n\nThe new BLK MGK coffee bar offers a menu of classic coffee, pastries, breakfast and lunch, besides a tincture menu of everyday remedies including “detox” activated charcoal and “tummy tame” assorted bitters, which can be added to any beverage. Coffee-based cocktails, local craft brews and wine by the glass are available for an afternoon pick-me-up. Weekly programming includes aura and astrology readings, artistic events in partnership with Cottonwood Center for the Arts and coffee tastings.\n\nGolden Hour is the hotel’s indoor-outdoor bar and courtyard. The menu offers a selection of high-craft cocktails, spirits, wine and local beer paired with artisanal bites. Golden Hour will offer Live Jazz Thursdays in partnership with Dizzy Charlie’s, a local music curator known for creating jazz pop-ups throughout Colorado Springs. Additional F&B venues will debut in the future.\n\nThe Vault, an on-site art gallery, will host rotating exhibits of Pikes Peak artists curated by Auric Gallery. The space is expected to become staple stop during Colorado Springs’ year-round First Friday gallery hop and an added amenity for guests who can also meet the artists during quarterly receptions. Art enthusiasts can book the “Peaks & Paintbrushes” overnight package for a self-guided experience inspired by the work of Emma Kelly and other plein air artists.\n\nThe hotel’s meeting and event spaces have received an extensive design refresh, along with the addition of a new boardroom. Nearly 11,000 square feet include two ballrooms and an outdoor terrace.\n\nThe hotel will offer fitness activations such as guided runs and Pilates classes as programming for meetings and groups. In-room wellness offerings include a Crystal Concierge; guests can request healing stones, several of which were mined in Colorado, to be delivered to their room for the duration of their stay. To round out the wellness experiences, tucked beneath the hotel, is a full-service spa. Services include massage treatments, aromatherapies, hot stone, manicures and pedicures, steam and sauna, and a salon.\n\nThe hotel’s central location offers proximity to Pikes Peak’s rugged trails and Garden of the Gods’ red rock spires. Additionally, Colorado Springs is within driving distance of Denver and a nonstop flight away from several major U.S. cities. The city is poised to welcome visitors with the 2024 Summer Olympics kicking off this July.\n\nFor more information, visit www.miningexchangehotel.com.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nHyatt Regency Chicago Unveils $150 Million Renovation\n\nIntroducing: Omni Select Planner for Meetings & Event Bookings\n\nMandalay Bay Completes $100M Remodel of Convention Center"
