        "text": "Leaf Peeping in New England\n\n[Leaf peeping is an informal term in the United States and Canada for the activity in which people travel to view and photograph the fall foliage in areas where leaves change colours in autumn, particularly in northern New England]\n\nWhen I was teaching it meant holidays could only be taken during the school holidays when it was more expensive and busy. And I couldn’t tag on to the OH’s conferences either. Which is why during one October half term we decided to do a fly drive holiday to the eastern side of the USA and do a spot of leaf peeping.\n\nWe began our trip in Boston where we stayed in a city hotel for a couple of nights before returning to the airport to pick up the hire car.\n\nWe arrived late on the Friday – just before midnight and were shown to a very second rate room as although we had specified a late arrival it seemed our actual room had been given to someone else. We were moved to a much better room in the morning and after breakfast we headed out to explore the city, beginning with the famous Public Garden where we had hoped to see the Swan Boats, but they were closed for the season, and we completely missed the ‘Make Way for Ducklings’ sculptures. I remember reading the book of the same name by Robert McCloskey to my daughter when she was a child.\n\nFrom there we wandered around the Beacon Hill area, one of Boston’s oldest neighbourhoods and full of charming, narrow cobblestone streets, federal style row houses and gaslit streetlamps.\n\nAnd as our visit was shortly before Halloween it was decorated with pumpkins and skeletons and all things ghostly!\n\nIt takes time to walk a block in Boston, there is so much architectural detail to see. There are a lot of tree-lined streets and parks. And cars.\n\nAfter dinner we set off to find the Old State House and wander down to the harbour where we followed the harbour walk as far as the Boston Tea Party museum, which was closed, before heading back to the hotel.\n\nA lot of this will have changed by now (this visit was in 2007) I know that the Northern Avenue bridge was in danger of being demolished along with the rundown Tender’s House next to it. The bridge is unique in that it is a rotating swing bridge built in 1908.\n\n(It was closed in December 2014. Apparently there were plans to reconstruct it as a pedestrian/cycle only bridge, but because of Covid the project came to a halt in 2020. The Tender’s House was partially demolished in 2008. The boarded up and rambling structure served for nearly a century as a home for the keepers of the rotating swing bridge – who had to be available, night and day, to let ships through. As one local said “This is demolition by neglect” )\n\nBoston is an interesting city, though I would not like to drive in the city centre, even driving through the tunnels (a later post) was enough to give me nightmares.\n\nArchitecture of the Gaslamp Quarter San Diego\n\nAnother interesting district in San Diego is the Gaslamp Quarter. In the 1860s, the area was known as New Town, in contrast to Old Town, the original Spanish colonial settlement. San Diego has tried hard to protect and preserve the architecture of times gone by and the district features one of the largest collections of Victorian Era commercial architecture in the western US, comprising 94 historic buildings, many of which are in still use as restaurants, shops, entertainment venues, and nightclubs.\n\nMy first stop was the Gaslamp Museum at the Davis-Horton House which depicts the story of the downtown area’s early settlers. The Davis House (1850)is the oldest surviving structure from San Diego’s New Town. It is an example of a prefabricated, “salt-box” style home. Built on the East Coast, shipped around Cape Horn, and assembled in San Diego.\n\nLocated across the street from the Gaslamp Museum is the Horton Grand Hotel, a restoration of two historic hotels – the Grand Horton and the Brooklyn-Kahle Saddlery – both built around 1887. The Grand Horton was of Italianate design and more of a luxury hotel, whereas the Brooklyn-Kahle Saddlery was a less formal hotel that combined Western/Cowboy and Victorian styles.\n\nThe Old City Hall is a beauty, a classic example of Florentine-Italianate architecture. Originally two-story structure was built in 1874, but 13 years later two more floors were added to accommodate the San Diego Public Library.\n\nThe Louis Bank of Commerce is a historic building which dates back to 1887. Reputed to be the most photographed building in the Gaslamp, this stately, four-story, twin-towered Queen Anne (Baroque Revival)-style structure possesses so many noteworthy and elaborate architectural features that it has been nicknamed “The Queen of the Gaslamp.”\n\nThe Nesmith–Greely Building is a four-story historic structure located at 825 5th Avenue next to the Louis Bank of Commerce. Built in 1888 in the Romanesque Revival style the building is named for Thomas Nesmith, President of the Bank of San Diego, and Major General Adolphus Washington Greely. . The Hubbell building is on the right (1886) constructed in the Victorian style.\n\nThe Balboa Theatre in San Diego’s Downtown area blends Moorish and Spanish Revival architectural styles and was built in 1924.\n\nThe Yuma Building, 1882, was one of downtown’s first brick structures, and was owned by Captain Wilcox who arrived in 1849 at the helm of the U.S. Invincible. The building is called the Yuma because of Wilcox’s business connections in the Arizona town.\n\nThe Spencer Ogden Building, 1874. The second floor was added in 1885, and the original ironwork of this French Renaissance-style building was replaced with newer material.\n\nMarston’s department store (1881-1896) Marston’s was one of Southern California’s finest emporiums and a genteel social hub for all ages. During the early 20th century, it was the region’s exclusive source of Gustav Stickley’s prestigious Arts & Crafts oak furniture. With the building of the fifth store in 1912, the store soon grew to 500 employees, in a progressive environment where women held senior positions and salaries provided a living wage.\n\nConstruction of the San Diego Trust & Savings Bank building occurred in 1927 and is generally regarded as a fine example of the Italian Romanesque Revival style. From 1928 until March 18, 1994, the building at Sixth & Broadway served as the headquarters for San Diego Trust & Savings Bank. It was then repurposed as a Courtyard-Marriott Hotel.\n\nSpreckels Building 625 Broadway was San Diego’s very first high-rise building and one of the last buildings constructed by John D. Spreckels in 1926. Now converted into luxury loft apartments.\n\nHistoric theatre (Reading Cinemas Gaslamp 15)\n\nAlthough often difficult to photograph these buildings without the horrid perspective distortion it is an interesting district to wander about in with lots of history although I was unable to discover much information about the art deco style buildings.\n\nEstablished in 1968, the Old Town San Diego State Historic Park is a living history museum that commemorates and preserves numerous historic buildings and recreates Old Town as it existed during the Mexican and early American periods, from its settlement in 1821, through 1872 when it lost its dominant position to Downtown.\n\nFive original adobe buildings are part of the complex, which includes shops, restaurants and museums. Other historic buildings include a schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, San Diego’s first newspaper office, a cigar and pipe store, houses and gardens, and a stable with a carriage collection.\n\nCasa de Estudillo\n\nConstructed in 1825 as the home of Don Jose Antonio de Estudillo, a Spanish aristocrat. It became a sanctuary for women and children during the American occupation in 1846. For a number of years it was incorrectly identified as “Ramona’s Marriage Place” from Helen Hunt Jackson’s “Ramona”. The adobe structure is considered to be one of Old Town’s outstanding show places.\n\nChurch of the Immaculate Conception\n\nBegun in 1868 by Father Antonio D. Ubach. Due to the boom that set in for the New San Diego, the church was not completed and dedicated until 1919.\n\nColorado House\n\nOriginally a hotel, now houses the Wells Fargo Museum. The building is a reconstruction of the 1860 original. The Wells Fargo Museum is a historically furnished Wells Fargo agent’s office, including one of the famous 30 Coaches shipped to Wells Fargo in 1867\n\nWhaley House\n\nOne of the most historic buildings in Old Town San Diego, the Whaley House was built in 1857 by Thomas Whaley, a San Diego pioneer, as his family home. Over the course of history the Whaley House has served as a general store, county courthouse and theatre. Apparently known as the most haunted house in America and after-hours they run paranormal tours.\n\nRobinson-Rose House\n\nJames Robinson built this two-story structure in 1853 as his family residence and as the home of the San Diego Herald, the San Diego and Gila Railroad office and other private offices.\n\nSan Diego Union Newspaper\n\nThis wood-frame structure was prefabricated in Maine and shipped around the Horn in 1851. This first office of the San Diego Union newspaper is restored as it was when the Union printed its first edition on October 10, 1868.\n\nMason Street Schoolhouse\n\nBuilt in 1865, the Schoolhouse was the first publicly owned school in San Diego County. The building was a one-room, wood-frame, shingle-roofed structure with a ten foot high ceiling. A pot-bellied iron stove heated the room, and a water bucket and dipper provided the only indoor plumbing. All eight grades were taught in the single room.\n\nAlthough it seems a little bit like a film set, it is still an interesting place to visit. And admission is free. Next time I will show you some of the more colourful aspects of this open museum.\n\nSource of information from Old Town San Diego guide."
