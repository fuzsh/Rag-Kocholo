        "text": "With sustainable travel on the rise, eco-conscious hotels across the world boast compostable packaging, reduced-water laundry practices, and indoor-outdoor architecture to lure in climate-minded travelers. But the new Populus hotel in Denver might be the first one to actually try and be a tree.\n\nThe first carbon-positive hotel in the United States, which opens in downtown Denver this summer, Populus takes sustainable travel to the next level: In addition to using low-carbon concrete mixes, high-recycled materials, and more during construction, the hotel is offsetting its long-term carbon footprint by planting trees across Gunnison County, Colorado. Already, more than 70,000 Engelmann Spruce trees, a plant native to the area that has been threatened by beetles, have been planted. Together, the trees will sequester more carbon than the building can emit in its life. Guests can even visit the newly planted forest themselves, just put the coordinates 38°03'59.4 \"N 106°55'24.6 \"W in a GPS.\n\nBut what might be most striking about the new-build hotel is the facade, which was inspired by Colorado’s famous Aspen trees. Designed by Studio Gang, the same firm that brought you the wavy Aqua Tower in Chicago and the twisting MIRA tower in San Francisco, the white exterior of the hotel is covered in what appear to be porous openings, but are actually just windows. The hotel’s distinctive windows pull double duty: They are meant to mirror the characteristic patterns of Aspen trees, while offering shade and boosting efficiency.\n\nThe nature-inspired design follows to the hotel's 265 rooms and multiple restaurants and common spaces that are outfitted in neutral tones, from sand to terra cotta, and filled with natural materials—reclaimed fencing wood from Wyoming and \"leather\" tapestries made from mushrooms.\n\nBoth of the hotel's restaurants will minimize their waste and work closely with regenerative farmers in the area to offer seasonal dishes. The rooftop bar in particular, Stellar Jay, offers live-fire cooking and wild game as well as stunning views of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nReady to go? Reservations can be booked at populusdenver.com."
