        "text": "Guest Historian Series\n\nRead Guest Historian Series\n\nNobody Asked Me, But…\n\nHotel History: Hotel Boulderado (1909), Boulder, Colorado\n\nBy Stanley Turkel, CMHS\n\nThe Hotel Boulderado name was created with the combination of city of Boulder and the state of Colorado, a memorable mutation of a state and host city that captures the best of both locations. In the early 1900s, when Boulder was evolving from a dusty frontier town into a small city, many of its residents realized the need for a substantial hotel. In 1905, Boulder was the home to 8,000 residents, the University of Colorado, one of the Chautauqua cultural and educational resorts and twenty-six automobiles. As a newly-created railroad hub, the city needed additional hotel rooms.\n\nWhat Boulder lacked in population, it made up in civic-based enthusiasm. Its local paper, the Daily Camera wrote, “Enthusiasm, much more than any other outward evidence inspires confidence in the success of this most important undertaking.” One resident wrote, “Now that the football season is over, let us get down to our studies at school and our determination to build a splendid hotel. Let us hit the line hard for Boulder, just as we hit the (Haskell, Kansas) Indians. Teamwork is all that is required. Our Commercial Association has the head work all right, but in chasing the ball of Boulder’s opportunity, it needs team work, a right and left tackle, and a college yell for the hotel.”\n\nThe Daily Camera headlines on April 10, 1906 read: “Let Us Rejoice” because the total of seventy-five thousand dollars which was necessary to make the subscriptions binding was surpassed in just four months to nearly eighty thousand. The architectural firm of William Redding & Son was hired and prepared two different schematic drawings which followed a trend of open court hotels started by the Palace Hotel in San Francisco and carried over to Denver’s Brown Palace Hotel, built in 1892. Boulder residents chose the more elaborate five-story design with its spectacular two-story lobby.\n\nIn searching for a suitable name for the new hotel, William R. Rathvon, President of the Boulder Commercial Association wrote:\n\n“The West is full of ‘Grands’ and ‘Palaces’ and ‘Grand Views’ and the like, which mean little or nothing to the traveler who drops his grip on the floor as he registers. Hence, when the name Boulderado was suggested as a composite of both city and state, it was sensibly argued in its behalf, that, in addition to the qualities above named, it was significant and distinctive.”\n\nRathvon defended the name by stating that the Boulderado would be the only hotel with that name in the world. “It stands for the city of Boulder in the state of Colorado. No matter when or where the words Hotel Boulderado may be heard by anyone who has ever rested beneath its roof, the city of Boulder – not Boulder in Montana, nor Boulder in Illinois – but Boulder in Colorado will instantly come to his mind whether it be one or twenty years after. And when he thinks of Boulder, he will remember the hotel.”\n\nThe Hotel Boulderado opened with a gala ball on New Year’s Eve of 1909. The two-story spectacular lobby incorporated a stained glass ceiling over the second floor. All bedrooms had light fixtures that ran on both electricity and natural gas since electricity bought from a power plant between Lafayette and Louisville was undependable on windy days. A huge coal-powered boiler provided steam for the hotel’s radiators and for the steam pipes that ran up to the rain gutters to prevent icing in the winter. Telephones were installed in most of the original seventy-five rooms. Twenty-one had full baths, while most of the others had sinks with hot and cold running water.\n\nOn January 1, 1909, the Daily Camera’s reporter wrote:\n\n“The new Boulderado, the pride of the city, kept open house to her thronging admirers last night. From seven till ten, great crowds surged through the apartments of the beautiful and luxurious hostelry, each individual feeling the joy and pride of a successful builder. Many were the visitors who began to realize, for the first time, the possibilities which such a hotel will open up for Boulder.”\n\nIn 1910, the top floor of the hotel, which had never been finished, was furnished with fifteen additional rooms to increase the total to ninety. From 1912 to 1917, William L. Beattie was the Hotel Boulderado’s manager and lessee and looked the part. Every day, he wore a three-piece suit, complete with tie, hat, gloves, diamond stick pin and spats. His assistant manager was Hugh Mark who was his nephew and who, in 1917, became the lessee and manager. Marks daughter, Betty remembered the hotel guests and employees fondly:\n\n“Dad did a lot of entertaining for these people. He held steak fries on Flagstaff Mountain and took guests on trips to Estes Park and Grand Lake (where Irwin Beattie later would own a guest ranch), as well as shorter outings into the mountains to Gold Hill, Nederland, and Central City.”\n\nOf the employees, three were uncles, and they remained as long as Betty could remember. “They took a great interest in Bill and me, and certainly were part of my education,” she stated. “The engineer showed me how he kept the giant furnace going. I learned to operate the front and service elevators. The housekeeper taught me to use a sewing machine. The waitresses showed me how to set and serve a table and how to make change. Even the bellboys showed me how to get into the ice cream machine when the kitchen was closed.”\n\nFamous guests of the era included attorney Clarence Darrow, poet Robert Frost, and lecturer Helen Keller. Keller had previously been to Boulder and had stayed at the Boulderado, in 1914. When she returned on Valentine’s Day in 1923, three-thousand people packed Macky Auditorium to hear her. Keller and companion, Anne Sullivan, stayed in the southeast corner of the mezzanine in room 205. Author Mark Twain once wrote, “The two most interesting characters of the 19th century are Napoleon and Helen Keller.” When visiting celebrities weren’t available, the Curran Theatre was filled with hotel guests and Boulder residents watching the silent movies. Stars at the time included Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Charlie Chaplin, Lon Chaney, and even Rin-Tin-Tin. Idol of the early twenties was Rudolph Valentino in “Son of the Sheik.”\n\nHugh Mark bought out his other partners, became the hotel’s sole lessee and renewed his lease in 1927. He was a leader in almost every organization he joined. Besides his prominence in the Elks Club, he was President of the Rotary Club, Director of the Boulder Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the Boulder County Republican Committee. Unfortunately, on July 3, 1934, 47-year old Hugh Mark died of a heart attack.\n\nAt the start of World War II, William G. Hutson, Sr., owner of the Eldridge Hotel in Lawrence, Kansas, the Hotel State in Kansas City, Missouri and the Hotel Broadwiew in Wichita, Kansas, bought the Hotel Boulderado. Later, in his obituary in Lawrence, Kansas newspaper, the senior Hutson was called “one in a million, the old-fashioned hotel-keeper, the genial host, the fun-maker, and the sagacious businessman who succeeded where countless others failed. He was also the Kansas state pinochle champion.” Hutson, Sr. turned over the management of the Boulderado to his son, 30-year-old Bill Hutson as a wedding present. Bill had attended the Cornell University School of Hotel Management. When World War II began, Bill became a civilian flight instructor in the Air Corps program at Boulder Airport. Then, in 1942, he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and was stationed in California, Arizona and Texas. When the war ended in August 1945, Bill returned to Boulderado and instituted the long-delayed renovation program.\n\nNevertheless, the hotel fell on hard times culminating when a wet and heavy Halloween snow storm cracked some of the panes in the rooftop skylight. Chunks of glass fell to the stained glass ceiling below. Then William Hutson, Sr. died on December 6th at the age of seventy-nine. His son, Bill Jr. died just four months later from an overdose of insulin at age of fifty.\n\nBy the 1960s, the Boulderado was reported to be “a rundown dirty old place with soot on the walls over the lobby radiators and cobwebs hanging about.” The much-praised imported cathedral glass ceiling over the lobby was removed in September 1960 because the management believed that the leaded stained-glass was old-fashioned and outdated. It was replaced with colored plastic plexiglass.\n\nAfter seven years of deterioration and indifferent management by Court Plaza, Inc. under Louis Weinberger’s ownership, the Boulderado was sold in 1976 and again in 1978 and 1980. Finally, the new managing general partner Frank B. Day authorized a complete renovation of the hotel from top to bottom. A headline in the Daily Camera, read, “Hotel Reopens With Old World Elegance.” The Boulderado became so successful that a north wing was built which added 61 additional rooms to the hotel at the cost of four million dollars. Even with the new rooms occupancy continued to be so strong that a 48-room addition was added and opened in November 1989. In 1995, the Hotel Boulderado was placed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 2005, exactly one hundred years after the major citizens of Boulder created their “hotel proposal”, owner Sid Anderson’s management company completed twenty-seven years of operation and restoration. This beautiful landmark building with its Italianate and Spanish Renaissance architectural elements has been restored to its original grandeur from the stained glass canopy above the lobby and cantileveled cherry wood staircase, to the elegant antique and Victorian-style furnishings.\n\nThe Hotel Boulderado is a member of Historic Hotels of America and the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\n*****\n\nAbout Stanley Turkel, CMHS\n\nStanley Turkel is a recognized consultant in the hotel industry.
