        "text": "With the sweltering heat of the summer sun beating upon their necks, three miners—John Blake, W.M. Bell, and “Frenchy” Cleiopfar—began their trek along the Tennessee Path in 1878. All had toiled to find buried caches of gold and silver in nearby Leadville, Colorado, only to become frustrated with their lack of progress. Inspired by tales of riches hidden further away in the Roaring Fork Valley, they abandoned the town for supposedly greener pastures. But the area had already been occupied by the Ute Indians, who had lived within the mountainous region for generations. And to protect the Utes from land-hungry miners, the federal government had formally recognized their sovereignty over the area in 1868. Undeterred, the three men began their journey at the headwaters of the Eagle River, which flowed downstream to the confluence of the much larger Grand River (now known popularly as the Colorado River). From there, the group stumbled into Ute territory, specifically exploring a range of mountains called the “Flat Tops.” After scouring the region for signs of gold for several months, the men decided to return to Leadville empty handed. Nevertheless, they returned the following year, intent on expanding the scope of their search. Blake, Bell, and Cleiopfar eventually established an illegal mining settlement on the northern rim of Glenwood Canyon, calling it “Fort Defiance.” Historians today still speculate as to why the three decided to name their base with such a peculiar name. Some, though, agree that it was most likely an affront to both the local authorities and the Utes.\n\nFort Defiance was just one of several illicit settlements that had appeared in Ute land, however. Upset at the lax federal enforcement of their rights, the Utes openly rebelled and attacked the many camps in the region. Yet, the uprising fell apart fast and the Ute Indians surrendered to the U.S. Army. While Fort Defiance remained a small, isolated outpost in the immediate aftermath of the fighting, more miners and land speculators gradually started to arrive from Leadville. But the new arrivals were enthralled by more than just tales of silver and gold—they now desired to mine the countryside for coal. John Osgood was perhaps the greatest coal miner to setup shot in the vicinity of Defiance, erecting a massive coke processing plant in the small community of Cardiff. Known as the “Redstone Coal Baron,” his operation featured close to 500 different ovens! Soon enough, those business magnates decided to remake Defiance into a proper town. Led by mining tycoons Isaac Cooper, Walter Devereux, and John Blake (of Fort Defiance fame), several prominent residents founded the Defiance Town and Land Company in 1882. It subsequently started building a formal street grid for the town on their behalf. But Cooper asked that the group rename the community “Glenwood Springs,” after Glenwood, Iowa. It had been the childhood home of his wife, Sarah, who was having great difficulty adjusting to life on the frontier. As such, Isaac hoped Sarah would find some solace in the name “Glenwood.” The other partners agreed to his request and the Town of Glenwood Springs was born.\n\nInitially, the settlement retained its rugged frontier character, attracting all kinds of gunfighters and desperados. But as the mining operations became more refined, so too did the character of Glenwood Springs. Some of the town’s founders contributed to the transformation directly by opening upscale businesses downtown. More commerce arrived to the community when both the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad and the Colorado Midland Railroad reached the town in the late 1880s. But the arrival of the trains heralded the birth of a new industry in Glenwood Springs—tourism. Passenger trains began to travel to Glenwood Springs, with their occupants disembarking briefly to tour the area. Over time, word of the area’s serene climate and largely undisturbed wilderness landscape reached the populous cities of the east. As such, a deluge of people began pouring into the town, making it one of Colorado’s foremost resort communities. Town founders Isaac Cooper and Walter Devereux in particular helped augment Glenwood Springs metamorphosis into a vacation destination. The two began constructing a “Glenwood Hot Springs Pool,” as well as a bathhouse for the neighboring Yampah Vapor Caves. But yearning to operate a similar attraction of his own, Devereux began building the Hotel Colorado shortly thereafter. (He had also hoped that the presence of such a wonderful business would provide a much needed source of culture for the residents of Glenwood Springs.) Debuting before hundreds of people in 1893, it quickly became the talk of the town.\n\nAdditional hotels and inns followed suit, providing a wealth of new jobs to the community. Some locals had even opened a series of tourist attractions around town, such as Charles Darrow and his Fairy Caves. An attorney by trade, Darrow owned a homestead that backed up against some caves in the nearby Iron Mountain. Realizing their appeal, he strung electrical lights throughout the subterranean system and marketed it as the “Eighth Wonder of the World.” (The Fairy Caves are still open today as part of the Glenwood Canyon Adventure Park). Needless to say, the strategy worked. Hundreds of people were now flocking into Glenwood Springs every year. Soon enough, some of the most powerful individuals in the country had traveled west to Glenwood Springs, including a few U.S. Presidents. President Theodore Roosevelt especially loved the town, visiting it frequently to host various hunting trips. As such, Roosevelt often stayed at the Hotel Colorado, using it as a temporary White House. Interestingly, some had arrived in Glenwood Springs to recover from various illnesses with the hope that the area’s wonderful climate would help them heal. The most famous person to convalesce in town was John Henry “Doc” Holliday, who had risen to fame for his role in the infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Unfortunately for the legendary gunfighter, Holliday died during his stay and was interred in the town’s Linwood Cemetery.\n\nBut the surrounding geography was still stalked by outlaws and renegades, including the infamous gang leader, Harvey Alexander Logan—otherwise known as “Kid Curry.” A bandit that once rode with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Logan was eventually gunned down leading his own gang in the neighboring village of Parachute. (He was then laid to rest next to Doc Holliday in Glenwood Springs.) That sort of criminal activity increased significantly when the Colorado legislature passed its own statewide Prohibition in 1916. Towns across the Colorado frontier quickly became illicit outposts for rumrunning and similar illegal activities. Glenwood Springs was no different. Many local businesses—including the Hotel Colorado—opened secret speakeasies, which rapidly emerged as lairs for gamblers and gangsters. Some of the most famous criminal masterminds established themselves in Glenwood Springs at the time, such as Diamond Jack Alterie. In fact, Alterie used the Hotel Colorado as his headquarters and hosted the likes of mobster Al Capone in the building’s clandestine bar. Around the same time, Glenwood Springs became something of a hotspot for Hollywood directors, who used the town as the set for their movies. Starting with the film, The Great K & A Train Robbery, in 1926, Glenwood Springs has been featured in nine major feature-length productions. Among the movies shot onsite have included Pressure Point, Flashback, and For Love of the Game. Today, Glenwood Springs has emerged as one of the leading holiday destinations in the entire United States. Its grand historical character and fantastic historic landmarks have made it beloved by locals and visitors alike.\n\nMargaret “Molly” Brown: Born shortly after the American Civil War to Irish immigrants, Margaret Tobin “Molly” Brown was an well-known socialite during America’s Gilded Age. While she rose to national prominence following her harrowing escape from the RMS Titanic, she built for herself a career as an active civil rights activist and philanthropist. She spent her childhood in Hannibal, Missouri, where she attended the grammar school of her aunt before working at a local tobacco factory. Brown eventually left Missouri for Leadville, Colorado, in 1886, alongside his brother, Daniel Tobin, and their half-sister, Mary Ann Collins Landrigan. Upon taking a job at a local mercantile store, she met James Joseph Brown and the two quickly wed. They relocated to the small mining community of Stumpftown, where James’ established a decent career as a mining engineer. As James advanced up the corporate ladder to become a local superintendent, Molly began running soup kitchens for the families of the miners in town. Her work at the soup kitchens eventually connected her to the budding western branch of the state’s emerging women’s suffrage movement.\n\nThe Browns finally reached affluence when James discovered an innovative way to access gold at the bottom of Little Jonny Mine. Moving to Denver with their new wealth in 1894, the Browns soon became significant players in Colorado’s elite social circles. Molly herself used her newfound status to help found the Denver Woman’s Club and to create one of the first juvenile courts in the entire country. Her political activities also increased over the next three decades, becoming a lively member of the Political Equality League and even running for a Congressional upon several occasions! Unfortunately, Molly and James separated in 1909. While the two never reconciled, they continued to care for one another as close friends for the remainder of their respective lives. Molly Brown took the extra time she had to travel the world alone, including a trip to Egypt in 1912. She did not stay in the country long, though, as she soon received word that her grandson had fallen ill. Boarding the RMS Titanic when it briefly docked in Cherbourg, France, she became a leading figure when it struck an iceberg just four days into its maiden voyage. Tales abound of how Brown assisted countless passengers into various lifeboats, before the crew finally persuaded her to evacuate. At one point, Brown had even taken an oar to help the small vessel escape the vortex of the sinking ship. Seeing the plight of people in the frigid water, Molly implored the lifeboat’s captain—Quartermaster Robert Hichens—to turn around. When the RMS Carpathia finally arrived to save the Titanic’s surviving passengers, Brown used her multilingual fluency to assist those who hailed from non-English speaking countries.\n\nBrown’s actions became known throughout the nation, with newspapers quickly giving her the moniker as the “Unsinkable Molly Brown.” She never let the fame overcome her, though, as she continued to work a variety of philanthropic causes for the rest of her life. Perhaps the greatest of those efforts emerged during World War I, when she campaigned for the American Committee for Devastated France. For her lifetime of charitable work, Brown received the French Légion d'Honneur in 1932. But Brown earned many other accolades posthumously, as well, including an induction into the Colorado Hall of Fame five decades later. Several theatrical productions have also immortalized her, such as the popular musical, The Unsinkable Molly Brown, as well as its subsequent film adaption starring Debbie Reynolds. In more recent years, actress Kathy Bates assumed the role of Molly Brown in James Cameron’s 1997 classic, Titanic.\n\n1891: One of the founders of Glenwood Springs—Walter Devereux—decided to open a luxurious new hotel downtown. Designed to rival the great Grand Dames of Europe, Devereux hoped that his business would bring a taste of civilization to settlement. He subsequently hired architect Edward Tilton to design the great building, who modeled it after the Villa de Medici in Rome, Italy.\n\n1893: After two years of construction, Devereux’s magnificent building debuted as the “Hotel Colorado.” He held a massive party to commemorate its grand debut, which was attended by some 300 different families. An orchestra played all through the night in the central ballroom, while a brilliant cascade of fireworks rained across the skyline.\n\n1901: Word traveled fast of the Hotel Colorado’s splendor, inspiring many illustrious from across the nationguests to visit. Among the first prominent individuals to arrive was Theodore Roosevelt, who still serving as Vice President at the time. Roosevelt enjoyed himself so much that he returned frequently throughout the course of his presidency.\n\n1905: Now President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt spent one memorable vacation at the Hotel Colorado in 1905. He transformed the entire facility into a temporary White House, while he hosted a three-week-long tuning trip. President Roosevelt even addressed a crowd of several hundred citizens from the hotel’s second-story balcony. Around the same time, Walter Devereux suffered a stroke and passed away. His longtime friend F.H.A. “Hervy” Lyle acquired the business in his absence.\n\n1909: President Roosevelt’s successor in the Washington—William Howard Taft—also arrived at the Hotel Colorado, wishing to experience the area’s tranquility. Led to the site by a parade of carriages, President Taft spent the morning speaking before a crowd of some 700 people at the hotel!\n\n1912: Lyle himself died, leaving sole responsibility of the Hotel Colorado’s management to its then General Manager, Elmer Lucas. But Lyle had completed a significant business deal before his passing, merging the operations of the Hotel Colorado with those of the Glenwood Hot Springs Company. Lucas himself had served as the hotel’s bookkeeper before becoming its General Manager in 1905. He then purchased the building outright four years after Lyle’s death.\n\n1917: In January, William F. Cody—known to history as “Buffalo Bill”—decided to travel to Glenwood Springs to improve his ailing health. As such, he selected the Hotel Colorado as his preferred destination. Yet, the great showman eventually passed away a few days after his arrival.\n\n1925: On September 16, one of the first live broadcasts in Colorado occurred at the Hotel Colorado. Some musical entertainment, as well as a speech were both broadcast by way of telephone to the Denver-based radio station, KOA.\n\n1926: Actor Tom Mix stayed at the Hotel Colorado while filming The Great K & A Train Robbery. The film was the first of several Hollywood productions shot in Glenwood Springs, with Tom Mix acting in the star role. Its story specifically followed the tale of a detective who attempted to stop the robberies affecting the fictional K & A Railroad. (Interestingly, John Wayne worked as an extra in the film, as well as a props person.)\n\n1927: Elmer Lucas and his wife, Katherine, continued to operate the Hotel Colorado through the height of the Roaring Twenties, until Lucas himself died. Katherine Lucas kept managing the business alone through the duration of the Great Depression, before selling the location to a syndicate led by an oil tycoon named Frank Kistler.\n\n1929: Legendary outlaw Diamond Jack Alterie arrived in Glenwood Springs and set up an illegal speakeasy in the Hotel Colorado. The state had declared its own stringent Prohibition laws a decade prior, inspiring criminal masterminds like Alterie to find ways to illegally sell alcohol. He specifically used the hotel as the headquarters for his operation, hosting the likes of mobster Al Capone within the building’s clandestine bar.\n\n1938: Frank Kistler and his business associates formally acquired the Hotel Colorado from Katherine Lucas. Kistler would then oversee the hotel’s daily operations through the twilight of the Great Depression, as well as the entirety of World War II.\n\n1939: Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover spent a significant amount of time vacationing at the Hotel Colorado. The hotel staff hosted an informal luncheon in his honor that was attended by some 400 different people! Hoover had just recently been president, having lost his reelection bid to Franklin Delano Roosevelt seven years prior.\n\n1943: The U.S. Navy leased the entire location as a medical facility called the “US Naval Convalescent Hospital.” It continued to serve patients straight through the end of the war, with the War Department finally decommissioning it in 1946. In merely three years of service, the Hotel Colorado had care for over 6,500 patients!\n\n1974: After a period of fluid ownership, Kirk Whiteley acquired the Hotel Colorado. Under his stewardship, the building underwent a massive series of renovations that helped restore some of its former glory. The construction work proved to be so effective that the U.S. Department of the Interior listed the building on the National Register of Historic Places. Kirk Whiteley then decided to sell the building to new ownership shortly thereafter.\n\n1988: The new owners of the hotel struggled to make it profitable, though, forcing Fidelity Bank to foreclose on its mortgage. All the work Kirk Whiteley had accomplished faded, as the Hotel Colorado fell on hard times once more. Nevertheless, the Bastian family purchased the hotel at an auction and hired Signature Hospitality Resources to restore the historic structure. They managed to save the building just in time for it to celebrate its 100th birthday.\n\n2020: Hotel Colorado rejoined Historic Hotels of America, having been a member once before in 2007. Its amazing institutional history and historical connections to the Town of Glenwood Springs have made it one of Colorado’s most outstanding historic landmarks."
