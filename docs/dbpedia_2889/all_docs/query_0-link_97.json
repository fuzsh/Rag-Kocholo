        "text": "Selection includes a New York City Art Deco gem, two newly-restored Oklahoma City hotels, a Colorado mountain retreat, an Arizona golf resort once owned by Bing Crosby and an oasis of serenity in San Diego\n\nNational Trust Historic Hotels of America announces the addition of six new members. This selection brings the program's total membership to 213 hotels, representing 39 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe new member hotels offer travelers a diversity of locales from major metropolitan cities to the deserts of the Southwest and represent a variety of architectural styles, including an Art Deco skyscraper, an Italianate resort in the Colorado Rockies and classic adobe casitas.\n\n'We continually seek historic hotels to add to our collection that offer travelers authentic experiences,' said Thierry Roch, executive director of Historic Hotels of America. 'These six new members of Historic Hotels of America showcase the evolution and growth of America from a southwestern ranch dating back 200 years and luxury hotels built by executives reaping the rewards of the silver rush and the oil boom to a hotel with roots in the early days of the automobile industry.'\n\nHere's a sampling of interesting facts highlighting the history of the hotels as well as personalities who have walked through the doors.\n\nThe Tubac Golf Resort in Tubac, Ariz., was the setting for the golf-themed movie 'Tin Cup' starring Kevin Costner.\n\nWith the advent of the automobile came the Pickwick Stages, a touring car company that transported passengers or 'tourists' between two locations. With most of its lines operating around San Diego, the Pickwick Company erected the Pickwick Hotel in 1926, now The Sofia Hotel in San Diego, Calif.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt established a temporary White House at the Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs, Colo., while on a three-week hunting expedition. After an unsuccessful day of hunting, a disheartened Teddy Roosevelt returned to the hotel where several maids pieced together a stuffed bear to cheer him, and according to legend, the 'teddy bear' was born.\n\nThe Jumeirah Essex House in New York was one of the first hotels in New York to offer 'Sunday brunch' for walkers in Central Park back in the 1930s.\n\nAs the builder of the Colcord Hotel in Oklahoma City, Okla., Charles Colcord was also pioneer, frontiersman, cattleman, oilman, entrepreneur and is known as Oklahoma's first citizen. He built the Colcord Hotel on Oklahoma City's Lot #1 in Block #1.\n\nPerle Mesta, daughter of the owner of The Skirvin Hilton, Oklahoma City, Okla., was the inspiration for the Broadway hit, 'Call Me Madam.' While ambassador to Luxemburg, Mesta lived in the building that now houses the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, D.C.\n\nA program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Historic Hotels of America is a membership-based marketing association."
