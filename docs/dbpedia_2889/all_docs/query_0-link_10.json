        "text": "What do the terms Italianate, Beaux-Arts, Edwardian Vernacular, Gothic Revival, and Neoclassical have in common?\n\nThese are all architectural styles that can be found all around Downtown Fort Collins and the surrounding neighborhoods! A city’s character often comes from the architecture of its buildings and Fort Collins is proud of its rich architectural heritage that can still be seen as you walk down College Avenue and other side streets.\n\nThe Poudre Landmark Preservation makes it easy even for out-of-town visitors to discover the history of downtown. Grab the Preservation’s online Historic Walking Tour map and you can enjoy hours on a historical scavenger hunt. You’ll even find the Armstrong on the list! Did you know that the Armstrong Hotel is only a few blocks from the street that inspired Disneyland’s Main Street USA? (Hint: find Walnut Street.)\n\nKeep Saturday, September 14, 2019, open for a special insider tour of some of Fort Collins’ historic homes and buildings. Get your tickets now for the 35th annual Historic Homes Tour. This event opens six private residences, a historic inn, and two historic city-owned properties to tour guests. You’ll get a personal tour inside the private homes “that have been exquisitely maintained by their owners to match the era and architecture of the home, with upgrades to match today’s lifestyle.”\n\nSpend the day or evening strolling around downtown. You’ll come to appreciate Fort Collins’ history as much as we do!"
