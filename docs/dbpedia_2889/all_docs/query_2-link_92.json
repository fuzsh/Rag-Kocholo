        "text": "Iconic Hotel\n\nBuilt between 1767 and 1775\n\nOur Iconic Hotel is located on one of the most famous crescents in the world.\n\nBuilt between 1767 and 1775 and designed by John Wood the Younger, it remains to this day one of the greatest pieces of Georgian architecture in the UK.\n\nOnce complete, The Royal Crescent rapidly established itself as Bath’s most desirable address. Seasonal residents, invariably rich and even royal, fell for the uninterrupted views over the River Avon and the proximity of the newly opened Upper Assembly Rooms, the most fashionable of Bath’s concert, dancing and gambling venues.\n\nNumber 16 Royal Crescent became a guest house in 1950 and in 1971 was combined with number 15 to become The Royal Crescent Hotel.\n\nSince then the hotel has had three owners with current owners Topland Group acquiring the property in 2012."
