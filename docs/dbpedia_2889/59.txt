Constructed in 1891, Hotel Ouray is a turn-of-the-century accommodation in the middle of downtown Ouray, one of Colorado’s most charming historic districts. Stay in one of its 14 classically styled rooms.

The Victorian Italianate style and architecture showcase its wooden structure, stained-glass windows, open second-floor veranda, and original saloon. In its original structure, it’s among the largest wooden buildings still around on the Colorado’s western slope.
