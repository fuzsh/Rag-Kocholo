        "text": "DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Pistons worked the phones last summer, trying to trade for a superstar to shake up their roster.\n\nThey ended up standing pat because a deal didn’t make sense.\n\nTwo games into the season, Allen Iverson was the answer to their hopes in a blockbuster that generated rare buzz for the NBA in November.\n\nDetroit acquired the former NBA MVP on Monday for All-Star point guard and former finals MVP Chauncey Billups, top reserve Antonio McDyess and project Cheikh Samb.\n\n“We just felt it was the right time to change our team,” Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars told The Associated Press. “Iverson gives us a dimension that we haven’t had here and we really think it’s going to help us.”\n\nThe Pistons have reached six straight Eastern Conference finals — the longest such streak since the Los Angeles Lakers’ dominant run in the 1980s — and won the 2004 title without a player expected to be in the Hall of Fame.\n\n“Trading Marilyn Monroe for Jane Russell. That’s not bad,” said Larry Brown, who coached the Pistons to the 2004 NBA title and Iverson in Philadelphia. “Joe knows what he’s doing, and I’m happy Chauncey’s going back to Denver and his family is there.”\n\nIverson may not be around for long — making $20.8 million in the final season of his contract — but The Answer might be what Detroit needs to return to the NBA finals for the first time since 2005.\n\nThe Pistons are hoping Iverson will play Wednesday at Toronto and barring injury, his home debut will be Sunday night against the Boston Celtics.\n\nDetroit played Monday night at Charlotte, where the Bobcats are led by Larry Brown. The Hall of Fame coach helped Billups and the Pistons to the 2004 NBA title and guided the Iverson-led Philadelphia 76ers to a spot in the finals in 2001.\n\nIverson talked about the possibility of being traded during training camp and said the only negative would be uprooting his family again.\n\n“But it doesn’t bother me because basketball is basketball,” Iverson said during camp. “It won’t change my game because I only know one way to play and that’s like every game is my last.”\n\nIverson’s agent, Leon Rose, told the AP he is not negotiating a contract extension with the Pistons for his client, who said during training camp he was looking forward to being a free agent for the first time in his career.\n\nThe addition of Billups might placate Nuggets fans who have watched the once free-spending franchise trade defensive standout Marcus Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers in the offseason and recently decline to extend Linas Kleiza’s contract.\n\nBillups is a Denver native, former Colorado star and former Nugget.\n\n“We fortunately fall into a guy that’s an All-Star caliber point guard,” Denver coach George Karl said after saying he was sad to see Iverson go. “The connection with Denver and Colorado is fun to be a part of and enthusiastic to our owners.”\n\nMcDyess also will be enjoying a homecoming of sorts, landing on the Nuggets’ roster for the third time.\n\nThe Pistons kept McDyess off the free-agent market last summer by giving him a $13.5 million, two-year extension, and they would love to have him back if the cost-cutting Nuggets buy out his contract.\n\n“I’ll be talking with Antonio and his representative directly,” Nuggets executive Mark Warkentien said. “But we think he’s a heck of a player and know he’s a quality guy. One step at a time.”\n\nDetroit, which tried to deal for the 33-year-old Iverson at least once before, added the superstar it lacked and salary-cap space for next summer by shedding Billups’ contract.\n\nBillups is in the second season of a four-year contract worth a guaranteed $46 million with a $14 million team option for a fifth year.\n\nIverson will take a spectacular resume into free agency in the summer.\n\nThe 20th-leading scorer in NBA history was the league MVP in 2001 — four years after being the Rookie of the Year — and is a nine-time All-Star.\n\nPhiladelphia drafted him No. 1 overall in 1996 out of Georgetown and he spent 11½ seasons with the franchise, leading it to the finals in 2001. He was traded Dec. 19, 2006, to the Nuggets and helped them reach the playoffs twice.\n\n“I want to thank A.I. Allen Iverson was a joy to coach,” Karl said. “When we acquired him, there were all these nightmares and stories about how difficult he was, and he never was difficult for me.”\n\nBillups bounced around the league after Boston drafted him No. 3 overall in 1997. The 32-year-old found a home in Detroit and blossomed into a three-time All-Star, and two-time All-Defensive player. He was on rosters in Boston, Denver, Orlando and Minnesota in his first four seasons before leading the Pistons along with Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince and Rasheed Wallace.\n\n“Every time I look out and don’t see Ben (Wallace) there I get a strange feeling,” Brown said. “Now not to see Chauncey and Dice, it’s going to be different.\n\n“But Allen is really special. If they want excitement in that building they’re going to get it because every time he steps on the court he’s going to try to win the game. And I don’t think you would ever consider giving up Chauncey and Dice unless you were getting something you thought was pretty special.”\n\nBillups struggled in each of the past three conference finals as the Pistons were eliminated in Game 6 each year. He has averaged nearly 15 points and 5½ assists for his career.\n\nMcDyess revived his career with the Pistons, playing 321 games over four seasons after serious knee operations. The former Olympian and All-Star has averaged 13.4 points and 7.7 rebounds for his career. Like Billups, the 34-year-old McDyess is one of the league’s most popular players among peers.\n\nDetroit acquired the 7-foot-1 Samb for Maurice Evans from the Lakers during the 2006 draft. The 24-year-old center played in just four NBA games last season, spending much of his year in the NBA Development League, where he led the league with four blocks a game.\n\n“Two teams had one common problem, or challenge,” Warkentien said. “I think the Pistons looked at (Rodney) Stuckey and saw him as the point guard of tomorrow, and you have an All-Star in Chauncey who was in his way.\n\n“We’re just thrilled with the way J.R. (Smith) is progressing and he had a Hall of Famer in front of him. You understand the motivation of both teams.”\n\n———\n\nAP Sports Writer Arnie Stapleton in Denver contributed to this report."
