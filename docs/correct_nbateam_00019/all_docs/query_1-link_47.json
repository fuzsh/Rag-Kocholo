        "text": "Anthony’s future will remain a constant topic for the Nuggets. New Jersey, New York, Houston, Philadelphia and Chicago are interested in Anthony but haven’t proposed an enticing enough offer to sway the Nuggets. “ ‘Melo is here. He’s playing hard. He’s doing the best he can do,” Billups said. “It’s the circumstances that are the reasons we’re sitting around .500. It has nothing to do with ‘Melo’s potential free-agent situation and trade situation.”\n\nBillups’ future could be tied to Anthony’s. Anthony has refused to a sign a three-year, $64 million extension with the Nuggets and told Yahoo! Sports last month that he’s ready for a change. If the Nuggets decide to trade Anthony, it could signal the start of a rebuilding process that might not include Billups. “I knew that at some point that was going to come, and my situation was going to kind of be like ‘Melo’s,” Billups said. “They look at me as an old veteran who really wants to win and play basketball. The average person says, ‘If Melo is gone, they’re not going to be any good. I know Chauncey doesn’t want to do that.’ “I knew at some point it was going to trickle down to me with people saying I’m going to get traded. I don’t listen too much to that.”\n\nNo matter where Denver Nuggets point guard Chauncey Billups visits, he knows the question is coming at some point. Where is Carmelo Anthony going? “If I’m out and about, you can bank on it once or twice every day,” Billups said. “I tell them, ‘I don’t know.’ I wish I did know, but I don’t know. I don’t sweat ‘Melo about ‘Melo. I don’t have these extra conversations with him about it. That’s a decision for him, his family, his [management] team. “I know ‘Melo knows that if he needs my advice, my unbiased advice, he can get it from me. We have that relationship. If he doesn’t [ask], I’m not going to be that guy that keeps talking to him, ‘What about this or what about this?’ I can’t do that.”\n\n“I don’t want to rebuild. They know that and I don’t think that they want to do that,” Billups said. “I’ve had some conversations with Josh and Masai. I think that they want to win. I don’t think they’re looking (to rebuild and then try) to win 6, 7 years down the line. I don’t have that kind of time. Hopefully Melo is here, but if he’s not, whatever move they make, or whoever they get, will come in here and get us winning right now. If they want to (rebuild), that’s another conversation that we’ve got to have.”\n\nThe all-star Denver point guard — and proud Denver native — is due to make a hefty $14.2 million next season, but the team can buy him out after this season for just $3.7 million, making him a free agent. Also, a league source confirmed that several teams have inquired about trading for Billups. And so, the new-look Nuggets’ front office will soon have to make a decision about Billups, the 34-year-old vet and the mentor to up-and-coming point guard Ty Lawson."
