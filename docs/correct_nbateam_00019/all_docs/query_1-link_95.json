        "text": "When the Denver Nuggets and Detroit Pistons agreed on the NBA's trade of the season so far with only three games played, it was a sign of two teams who, having crossed their fingers all summer long that it would all be all right on the (opening) night, had decided it was time to recast their principal roles.\n\nThe blockbuster swap on November 4 sent Chauncey Billups and Antonio McDyess to the Nuggets in exchange for Allen Iverson and the young Senegalese centre Cheikh Samb, with McDyess soon returning to the Pistons. The Nuggets had faltered in their bid to return to the Championship level of four years previous and it was time to go in a new direction. There were also some salary cap issues and all in all it was another stroke of genius from the Detroit general manager Joe Dumars.\n\nExcept, two months later, Denver look like a squad that are capable of making a run all the way through the Western Conference and on to the NBA Finals. And the main reason is Billups.\n\nSure, Iverson will probably get a starting nod in next month's All-Star Game due to his indelible popularity with the fans. Yet it is his successor in the Nuggets' back-court who is shining brightest. At 25-13, George Karl's side have produced the best start in franchise history and much of that can be credited to an off-season change in emphasis from the head coach. \"Defence,\" Karl said, by way of explanation of what has changed at the Nuggets. \"To be more professional. To try to be a more serious, playoff-type team rather than an entertaining, explosive team like we were last year.\"\n\nNone of those objectives has, traditionally, been Iversen's forte. But if you had to pick one player in the entire league who personifies the mix, the answer would surely be Billups.\n\nIt is still a work in progress. Denver allow an average of more than 100 points per night. Yet their interior presence, even since Marcus Camby was shipped to the LA Clippers, has improved remarkably, holding the opposition to a 44.2 field goal percentage, fifth-best in the NBA. Much of that is down to Nenê, the Brazilian tower who, now injury-free, is starting to put his physical presence to consistent use. Yet there have been few nights when the Nuggets have folded. Someone has to set the tone. And that man is Billups. In the enlightening plus-minus statistics that measure how your side fare when you are on and off the court, the point guard has a rating of 118 in Denver. Contrast that with 25 for Iverson in Detroit. Having starred previously at the University of Colorado, no wonder it has been a happy homecoming.\n\n\"I've never seen the spirit of a town rally around a player,\" declared Karl, speaking on NASN's Pardon the Interruption. \"Chauncey is not a spectacular player. He is not even a statistically special player. He is just his presence, his character, his leadership, his locker-room demeanour, all these little things that coaches love to talk about and drink beers over Chauncey has and now gives to us. And I think gives us an opportunity to be a great team.\"\n\nHaving lost Carmelo Anthony to injury for three weeks, the Nuggets' ascendancy is about to be tested. They lost 93-90 to the Pistons last Friday in Iverson's return to Denver. Billups scored 30, and he will have to do more of the same. Yet the hallmark of a true playmaker is to make those around him better. Without Melo, the Nuggets will still get the same number of offensive opportunities per night. It's just down to everyone else to convert them in his absence.\n\nIn Detroit, there is a feeling Iverson is on borrowed time with his contract expiring in the summer. With Richard Hamilton due back from injury any day now, the Pistons coach Michael Curry has a pivotal decision to make on his preferred line-up. He could, and probably should, demote the former MVP to the bench.\n\nIt won't change Iverson's status as one of the greats. But the NBA is all about the here and now. This is Denver's time. Credit Chauncey for that.\n\nOffensive rebounds\n\nThe NBA, and in particular the New York Knicks, has proved fertile ground for sexual-harassment lawsuits over the years. But here's a fresh take: the former driver of the Knicks centre Eddy Curry has filed court papers alleging that the player made unwanted advances, as well as racial slurs. Nothing unusual, except Curry is a a married father of four and his chauffeur is a man.\n\n\"It's like a prime example of you got to watch who's around you,\" proclaimed Curry, , who fiercely denies the allegations. \"This is a guy who I really thought he was my friend up until the last four, five months. I can't even believe this happened … I can't believe it went this far.\" Just when you thought things in Knick-land were approaching some semblance of normality.\n\nPotential stat of the week: Sunday's BBL Cup Final could end with a football club winning a major British basketball prize for the first time in 20 years. Everton Tigers, an off-shoot of the Premier League club, will be favourites to defeat Plymouth Raiders at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. Glasgow Rangers won the league title in 1989, three seasons after Manchester United achieved the feat. At least, with some silverware in the cabinet, Evertonians would be one up on their Mersey rivals – for now."
