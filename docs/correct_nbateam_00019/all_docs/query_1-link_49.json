        "text": "One of the greatest basketball players to ever attend the University of Colorado was honored by the NBA's Detroit Pistons tonight as Chauncey Billups had his number retired prior to a game against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nIn two seasons with Colorado, Billups averaged 18.5 points, 5.6 rebounds and 5.1 assists per game. His sophomore season, he led the team to the NCAA Tournament where they were able to upset the Indiana Hoosiers in the first round before losing to North Carolina.\n\nBillups was the third overall pick in the 1997 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics and was traded halfway through his rookie season to the Toronto Raptors. By the end of his rookie contract in 2000, he had also played in Denver and Orlando.\n\nFinally, in 2002, following a successful two-year stint with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Mr. Big Shot signed to play in Detroit. In seven seasons with the Pistons, Billups made 470 starts and was the Finals MVP when Detroit beat the Los Angeles Lakers to win the championship. In his first six years in Detroit, the team made six consecutive conference finals appearances and appeared in two NBA Finals. The King of Park Hill found his palace in Auburn Hills.\n\nSo congratulations, Chauncey. The Pistons had already retired your number four, so you went and made number one great too."
