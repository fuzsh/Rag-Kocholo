        "text": "Sean StancillSenior Writer I\n\nThe Denver Nuggets search for a point guard has finally ended.\n\nThe Nuggets traded superstar Allen Iverson to the Detroit Pistons for Chauncey Billups, Antonio McDyess, and Cheihk Samb.\n\nTrade talks between the Nuggets and the Pistons erupted in July, when Pistons GM Joe Dumars offered Billups and SF Tayshaun Prince for superstar Carmelo Anthony.\n\nDenver ingeniously declined.\n\nThe Iverson-Anthony experimentation lasted two years and resulted in two consecutive playoff appearances, resulting in a 1-8 postseason record with crushing first round defeats at the hands of the Spurs & Lakers.\n\nPrior to this most recent deal, The Nuggets were 1-2 on the year, suffering from a home loss Saturday against the Lakers in which former Nugget Allen Iverson had only eight shots.\n\nIverson averaged 26.4 ppg, 7.1 apg, and 2 spg last season for the Nuggets. This season, A.I. has averaged 18.7 ppg, 6.7 apg, and 1 spg. However, \"The Answer\" has a career scoring averaged of 27.7 per game.\n\nFor Chauncey Billups, it is a homecoming; he previously played in the state of Colorado collegiately and professionally. Chauncey went attended the University of Colorado from 1996-97 and was the third overall pick by the Boston Celtics.\n\nHis first tenure with the Nuggets came in 1998-99, when he averaged 13.9 ppg, 3.8 apg, and 1.3 spg in his third season removed from being a Buffalo.\n\nWhile Billups may be lingering on the downside of his career, he's done an outstanding job masking it. Billups has made three consecutive All-Star appearances and averaged 17 ppg, 6.8 apg, 1.3 spg and shot 91.8% last season. This season, Chauncey has averaged 12.5 ppg, 7.5 apg, 1.5 spg, while 90% FT for the 2-0 Pistons.\n\nThe 2003-04 Finals MVP will accommodate a supporting cast of Carmelo Anthony and J.R. Smith to form an intriguing and new trio in the Western Conference.\n\nDenver still has one invaluable asset: a $10 million trade exception which they received as a part of the Marcus Camby deal during the offseason.\n\nEarlier last week, the Nuggets decided not to offer G/F Linas Kleiza a four year contract extension, making the Lithuanian eligible for free agency."
