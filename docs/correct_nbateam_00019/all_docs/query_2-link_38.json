        "text": "A professional basketball team based in Denver, Colorado, the Nuggets play in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They joined the NBA in 1976 after nine seasons in the American Basketball Association (ABA). The Nuggets have won one NBA championship (2023).\n\nOriginally known as the Denver Rockets, the team was one of the founding franchises of the ABA in 1967. The Rockets were immediately successful, posting winning records in each of their first three seasons. Anticipating a move to the NBA, where the Houston Rockets were already established, the team changed its name to the Denver Nuggets in 1974. The Nuggets had the best record in the ABA in 1974–75, but they were upset by the Indiana Pacers in the Western Division finals. Denver advanced to the ABA finals the following year after once again having the best record in the league, but they lost to the New York Nets.\n\nThe Nuggets were one of the four teams from the ABA that joined the NBA in 1976. In the first season following the merger, the Nuggets were the most successful of the former ABA squads. They won the division title and made the playoffs, where they lost to the eventual champion, the Portland Trail Blazers. Led by future Hall of Fame members Dan Issel and David Thompson, Denver won its division for a second straight year in 1977–78. In the postseason the Nuggets advanced to the Western Conference finals before being eliminated by the Seattle Supersonics.\n\nIn 1980 Denver traded for forward Alex English, who would become the franchise’s all-time leading scorer. During English’s second season with Denver, Doug Moe took over as head coach. Moe and English led high-scoring Nuggets teams to nine consecutive postseason berths between 1981–82 and 1989–90. That run included another conference finals appearance—a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in 1984–85. However, English and Moe both left the team after the 1989–90 season, having never brought a title to Denver.\n\nDuring the 1990s the Nuggets posted a winning record in only one season. In 1993–94 Denver had a 42–40 record, which earned them the eighth (the lowest) seed in the Western Conference playoffs. In the first round they faced the Seattle Supersonics, owners of the best record in the NBA that season. Led by center Dikembe Mutombo, the Nuggets rallied from a 2–0 series deficit to win three straight games to become the first eighth seed in NBA playoff history to defeat a top-seeded team. However, the Nuggets were eliminated by the Utah Jazz in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nIn the 2003 NBA draft, the Nuggets selected forward Carmelo Anthony with the third overall choice. In 2003–04 Anthony helped the team to a 26-win improvement over the previous season, and the Nuggets ended an eight-year playoff drought. Denver qualified for the postseason each year from the 2003–04 season to 2007–08, but the Nuggets failed to advance past the first round on each occasion. The team acquired veteran point guard Chauncey Billups early in 2008–09. That season he helped Anthony guide the Nuggets to victories in both the first and second round of the Western Conference playoffs before the team lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the conference finals. Another first-round postseason elimination followed in 2009–10. Both Anthony and Billups were traded to the New York Knicks in February 2011."
