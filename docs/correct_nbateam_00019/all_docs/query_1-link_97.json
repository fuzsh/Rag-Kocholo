        "text": "Even before he officially retired at the end of the 2014 NBA season, the talk was that Denver native Chauncey Billups would likely have a future in an NBA front office. Perhaps even in the Mile High City.\n\nAlmost two full NBA seasons have passed since then and the former Nugget and NBA Finals MVP remains perched behind a TV desk at ESPN, biding his time, waiting for that bigger opportunity. He’s told friends he’d love a chance to run the Denver Nuggets. Apparently, the Nuggets aren’t interested.\n\nThis is not new news or a new thought, rather a reaffirmation of what many have already written and said over the past two-plus years. Recently, however, we’ve been presented with more glaring evidence.\n\nWhile the Nuggets' franchise has floundered since the departure of general manager Masai Ujiri — voted the NBA’s 2013 Executive of the Year before leaving to take a lucrative contract offer in Toronto (and turning the Raptors into an Eastern Conference power) — and future Hall of Fame coach George Karl, Denver has been promising fans that better days are ahead. But it appears that what lies ahead is more of the same.\n\nThis is not a knock against Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly, who is well thought of by most and seems to be doing the best he can with what he’s got to work with. While Connelly appears solid in areas like the draft, negotiating contracts and maneuvering around the salary cap, he’s proven — like most who have come before him not named Ujiri — unable to lure a star player to Denver, either via free agency or trade.\n\nWhile building smartly through the draft remains the best way to become a consistent playoff team, adding an all-star caliber player to that mix is what great teams do. Over the summer, Denver tried to get Dwayne Wade. He toyed with the idea (perhaps using the Nuggets as leverage?) before signing with Chicago. Then last week at the NBA trade deadline, Connelly made a serious push to acquire Paul George from Indiana, but was told that George (who will be a free agent at the end of next season) would not commit to signing with the Nuggets for the long haul because Denver didn’t have a chance to win the West.\n\nIt’s a familiar refrain.\n\nThere’s only one guy who could change that narrative: Billups.\n\nThe Denver native could instantly become the face of the faceless Nuggets franchise. There’s not another person alive who could sell Mile High basketball with the same passion as the King of Park Hill. For a team with almost no credibility of being an upper-echelon franchise, Billups would provide buckets full of it with standout NBA players. Much like John Elway has done with the Broncos, Billups would immediately upgrade the Nuggets in the eyes of the rest of the league.\n\nIf Chauncey Billups is the guy making the sales pitch, Paul George is a Denver Nugget today.\n\nThis is the same thought process they’re using in Los Angeles with Magic Johnson taking over as vice president of the Lakers. He’s not there to figure out the salary cap and deal with expiring contracts. He’s there to lure stars and bring back the championship mindset to LA.\n\nIf the Denver Nuggets ever become serious about returning to the Western Conference Finals and beyond, they’d have Chauncey take the same role here. No one alive could do it better.\n\nFor more from Mark Knudson, go to www.MarkKnudsonsInsidePitch.com."
