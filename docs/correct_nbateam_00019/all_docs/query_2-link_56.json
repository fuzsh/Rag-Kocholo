        "text": "How My Nuggets Fandom Began\n\nI wanted to start this piece off by detailing how my Denver Nuggets fandom came to be fifteen years in the making. One may ask, “How are you a Denver Nuggets fan from New Jersey?” The simple answer is Carmelo Anthony. The Carmelo Anthony, Allen Iverson, and Chauncey Billups Nuggets teams were very likable to people all around the world, and they immediately grabbed my attention. They played with swagger, finesse, and most players stood out wearing headbands and shooting sleeves.\n\nWith Melo’s recent retirement, I have had some time to reflect on his impact as a Nugget. No doubt, he resurrected the franchise out of irrelevancy and put them back into playoff contention. His #15 jersey should be in the rafters of Ball Arena someday (right next to Nikola Jokić’s #15 jersey).\n\nWhen Carmelo Anthony requested a trade, I was heartbroken. My friend at the time said to me, “With Carmelo being traded to the Knicks, you can’t be a frontrunner now, you have to stay a Nuggets fan.” The Knicks did not accomplish much, so it looks like I got the last laugh. I accepted that and it was one of the best sports decisions I ever made. Funnily enough, the draft pick from the Carmelo trade turned into Jamal Murray. All these years later, the Melo trade still had ramifications.\n\nI liked the underdog mentality of the Nuggets teams post-Melo. Danilo Gallinari, Kenneth Faried, Ty Lawson, Wilson Chandler. Winning 57 games. Andre Iguodala leaving to join a soon-to-be dynasty in the Warriors. Those teams were extremely fun to watch, but reflecting on it years later, those teams had no chance of winning a championship. However, those players were synonymous with my Nuggets fandom.\n\nThe Beginning of the Tim Connelly Era\n\nOne of the leading architects of the current Denver Nuggets roster, Tim Connelly, was hired in June of 2013 right before the draft. Tim Connelly’s first move as GM was to trade the 27th pick (Rudy Gobert) from the 2013 NBA Draft for the 46th pick (Erick Green) and cash considerations. This was not a deal where the Nuggets picked Gobert and traded him. Utah had Denver select Gobert for them as part of the terms of the trade.\n\nHowever, this move was partially responsible for Denver almost losing in the first round to the Jazz in the 2020 playoffs. Gobert went on to develop as one of the best defensive players of this generation and a multiple-time all-star. This isn’t really a move that I critique Connelly for due to the fact he was extremely new in his role. If Gobert was on the Nuggets, who knows if Connelly would have drafted Jusuf Nurkić and Nikola Jokić due to positional reasons?\n\nConnelly then signed aging veterans in Randy Foye, Nate Robinson, and JJ Hickson. After the season was deemed a failure, Connelly quickly pivoted the organization’s approach, with the next move leading to historic milestones years later.\n\nNikola Jokić gets drafted by Denver\n\nIn 2014, the Nuggets were entering a rebuild. Coincidentally enough, that year was the same time I began NBA draft scouting. Building a roster through the draft was extremely intriguing to me, especially for small and mid-market-sized teams. The Nuggets traded the 14th pick (Doug McDermott) in the draft for picks 16 and 19, turning into Jusuf Nurkić from Bosnia and Gary Harris from Michigan State respectively (who I really wanted Denver to take).\n\nThe best pick of that night actually turned into Nikola Jokić at pick 41 in the second round. I could have started and stopped the article right here. Nikola Jokić is the most important player and person to be affiliated with the Nuggets organization in the history of the franchise. However, that would be dismissing the contributions of a lot of important people connected to the franchise.\n\nThe greatest second-round pick in NBA history was taken at pick 41 in the 2014 draft. That is a huge scouting malpractice by the rest of the NBA. In the history of the NBA Draft, selecting Nikola Jokic, Gary Harris, and Jusuf Nurkic might go down as the best three-player class of all time.\n\nNuggets Hire Michael Malone as Head Coach\n\nIn 2015, after the disastrous Brian Shaw era, the Nuggets hired Michael Malone. At this time, the Nuggets were in a state of ruin and looked at to be the laughingstock of the league, read the article below.\n\nMalone was recently fired from the dysfunctional Sacramento Kings. To be completely transparent, I was in favor of the Nuggets hiring Mike D’Antoni at the time. I had thought that D’Antoni was the more established head coach and had a longer track record of winning.\n\nA trend that I have noticed over the years is that head coaching isn’t solely about gameplan and strategy. A large portion of the job is about building relationships with players, and Malone has really made it his duty to embody that philosophy. He has exemplified not only superb strategy and adjustments, but also helped solidify a culture of accountability, hard work, and family. He also has that east coast (NY/NJ) toughness and swagger that was on full display throughout the playoffs.\n\nThere have been times that I, personally, have been critical of Malone’s unyielding loyalty to veteran players (Will Barton, Paul Millsap) at the expense of younger and more versatile options, and the Michael Porter Jr. dynamic specifically (more on this later) was a large topic of discussion amongst the media and fans alike.\n\nHowever, I never advocated for Malone to be fired. No coach is perfect of course, and Malone is someone who has displayed a great sense to always get to the right decisions, albeit if it takes a little bit of time. The Nugget's title this year only solidified my belief that Malone should coach the Nuggets for as long as he wants to coach the game of basketball.\n\nOne of Tim Connelly’s best trade moves was trading Arron Afflalo for Will Barton in 2015. Barton would go on to become a vital piece to the Nuggets upstart, despite a ton of backlash from fans and media. Barton received minimal playing time in Portland, parlaying that into a great opportunity in Denver.\n\nBarton went from a high-flying dunker to an extremely skilled all-around shooter, passer, and rebounder for a guard. Barton was the Nugget's scapegoat for a lot of people. He was far from the perfect player, but his skillset overall was positive to Denver’s attack, and his contributions should not go unnoticed.\n\nThe 2015 NBA Draft\n\nThe next step in the Nugget's rebuilding process was finding a point guard. They held the 7th pick in the draft, selecting Emmanuel Mudiay. Mudiay had opted to forgo college at SMU to play in China. Mudiay ended up more or less becoming a draft bust. The runway was basically set for him to gain as much experience as possible, and to make as many mistakes as needed in order to become the best player he could be. That may have not been the best plan, because about 2.5 years later, he was traded due to underperforming.\n\nThe interesting part about the Emmanuel Mudiay situation is that it became a learning lesson for the Nuggets organization, especially for head coach Michael Malone in particular. Countless times, Malone has said that each young player would have to earn their minutes in order to play for him. Mudiay was given a starting spot immediately, and his not earning that spot due to his production might have been a hindrance rather than a benefit.\n\nThe 2016 NBA Draft\n\nThe 2016 NBA draft was another franchise-altering one for the Nuggets. The Nuggets had the 7th pick going into the night, and I was extremely worried that the team was going to select Dragan Bender if he made it to that selection.\n\nJamal Murray was the player I wanted for Denver, despite Emmanuel Mudiay already getting drafted a year prior. Murray played off the ball at Kentucky next to Tyler Ulis and Isaiah Briscoe (New Jersey legend), however, watching Murray in high school and in moments at Kentucky, led me to believe that he was a Point Guard. When the Pelicans selected Buddy Hield ahead of Murray, I knew at that moment, the Nuggets had their Point Guard.\n\nThe Nuggets also selected Juancho Hernangomez and Malik Beasley, who were fringe rotation players for the Nuggets throughout the years before getting dealt. The plan for Tim Connelly was evident: stack the roster with as many young prospects as possible, and see how many are rotation quality.\n\n2017 NBA Draft\n\nThe 2017 NBA Draft was simply an unmitigated disaster for the Nuggets, despite selecting Monte Morris in the second round. My view on this draft was that Connelly thought he could snag two rotation players at the expense of one, just like he did in 2014 with Gary Harris and Jusuf Nurkic. The Nuggets had pick 13 going into the night, drafting and trading Donovan Mitchell for pick 24 in Tyler Lydon (mind-boggling selection) and Trey Lyles (who actually has carved out a decent career as a rotation player).\n\nThis move was disastrous for two reasons: the first reason was the Nuggets were rumored to be targeting OG Anunoby, who missed most of his second season at Indiana due to injury. Anunoby was another player I really liked for the Nuggets at 13, especially as a defender next to Nikola Jokić.\n\nDespite the pick being viewed as a potential overdraft at the time, the Nuggets should have just taken him at 13. Second, the Nuggets traded in-division, in the western conference, a player who would become a superstar (more on this later). This move almost caused a different trajectory for the Nugget's long-term outlook. The Nuggets also drafted eventual NBA Champion Vlatko Čančar at pick 49 in the same draft.\n\nThe Nuggets select Monte Morris at pick 51\n\nThe story of Monte Morris (and Torrey Craig) excelling from one of the first two-way contract players into an NBA rotation player is an inspiring one. Morris was a steady presence throughout his tenure in Denver, filling in for Jamal Murray last year when he got injured and even starting playoff games in the bubble.\n\nHe became a fan favorite and even became known as “Mr. Nugget.” It was great to see Monte get an opportunity to start last year, and then get traded for a bigger role in Washington. Morris was even in attendance to watch the NBA Finals and support his former teammates. Monte is a class act and is one of the more identifiable Nuggets of this era.\n\nThe Nuggets sign Paul Millsap in Free Agency\n\nIt would not be hyperbole to say that Paul Millsap was the best free agent signing in Nuggets history. Millsap was exactly the type of veteran presence the Nuggets needed, as far as leading by example and someone with extensive playoff experience. Nikola Jokić needed a defensive anchor next to him, and Millsap fit that bill.\n\nI remember an instance where it was reported that Millsap told Jokic despite him being a 4x All-Star, it was Jokic’s team. The fight with Marcus Morris in the Clippers series was a moment that stood out as legitimately changing the complexion of that playoff round. Millsap was worth every penny of that max contract because it allowed the Nuggets to identify Aaron Gordon as his replacement when it came to skillset, athleticism, and offensive fit.\n\nThe 2018 NBA Draft\n\nThe 2018 NBA Draft is what I call the leap from playoff team to contender for the Nuggets. I was in attendance at this draft when Michael Porter Jr. was selected by Denver. I was in complete disbelief when the Knicks selected Kevin Knox at 9, followed by the Clippers selecting Jerome Robinson at 13. Knicks fans were even chanting for MPJ to be their selection.\n\nThe Nuggets were afforded the opportunity to draft MPJ for three reasons: first, the back injury scared teams off into taking other players. Second, they had a young and improving team anchored by an ascending superstar in Nikola Jokic, which gave them leeway to swing big. Finally, the famous game 82 playoff play in loss vs the Wolves allowed Denver to select a player at 14. Denver missing the playoffs that year might have turned into a blessing in disguise for the franchise because without taking a chance on MPJ in the draft, the ceiling of the team would have lowered significantly.\n\nThe Bubble Run\n\nLet’s jump to the bubble, a place where a lot of important developments happened for the current iteration of the Nuggets. The Nuggets were the third seed in the Western Conference before the pandemic struck. Nikola Jokić was on his way to becoming a top player in the league. Murray established himself as an ascending number two option, and the tantalizing flashes of Michael Porter Jr were evident in his inconsistent opportunities to play.\n\nThe Michael Porter Jr Breakout\n\nThe Michael Porter Jr bubble breakout was unbelievable to watch. MPJ averaged 22 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 1.6 assists while shooting a scorching 55% from the field, 42% from three, and 93% from the free throw line during the “regular season”.\n\nMurray was out for a few games to start the bubble, moreover, Gary Harris and Will Barton missed the entire preliminary round of games. I always think of this occurrence as the opportunity where MPJ solidified himself as a piece of the Nugget's core.\n\nIf Gary Harris and Will Barton were healthy, would MPJ have been able to leap them in the eventual rotation? Would his development be delayed due to more inconsistent time? I cannot be sure Malone would have gotten there, as Harris and Barton were two trusted veterans in the Nuggets rotation.\n\nTo be completely transparent, you knew the output you were getting with players like Barton, Harris, and Craig. MPJ was a bonus factor to the Nuggets equation, someone whose ceiling and floor could help lift Murray and Jokic’s offensive attack. Team building is an arduous task, and trusting MPJ despite inexperience and injury issues was a huge reason for skepticism.\n\nWhat MPJ gave the Nuggets was an elite shooter, an excellent rebounder at 6'10, and someone who is ideal for the Nugget's defensive scheme on the backline. Malone had a tough job; coaching a team ready to win now, but maybe not a championship contender, while trying to find minutes for an uber-talented rookie.\n\nWhen Malone would get angry at MPJ for missing rotations and getting beat off the dribble defensively, I understood his reasoning. MPJ was extremely inexperienced having barely played in college at Missouri, and then got inconsistent minutes before the bubble. There were times when veteran players would make mistakes and have a longer runway than MPJ, no doubt about it.\n\nThere were valid complaints about how Malone went about navigating the MPJ ascension, for sure. However, I am unsure if another coach would have eventually received the buy-in of someone who had a ton of hype pre-draft to become a team player on both ends of the floor, especially defensively, while taking a backseat on offense, and someone who is now identifiable with the ideals of the Nuggets.\n\nJamal Murray and Nikola Two-Man Game Dominance\n\nJamal Murray and Nikola Jokić established themselves as one of the better two-man duos in the NBA after the bubble run. Murray, in particular, really took a leap as a player. The most prevalent Jokić era question was whether or not Murray was a suitable running mate as a number two option. He was taking shots that media and fans pleaded with him to take out of Pick and Roll, he was noticeably quicker and much more athletic. It was almost like magic watching these two players be in sync on the court.\n\nThe bubble really was a turning point for the franchise. Murray looked the part as a number two option, Michael Porter Jr’s potential combined with his dynamism vaulted the Nuggets from a good playoff team to a legitimate contender. Coming back from not only one, but two 3–1 deficits really exemplified the Nuggets’ resilience and toughness, but also what they were on the precipice of becoming as a team.\n\nImagine if Denver lost to Utah in the first round, after basically gifting the Jazz two all-star players personally? Murray might have been traded and Malone might have been fired. The “What if” is an extremely interesting topic. Thankfully that did not happen.\n\nThe Nuggets Core Four is Set\n\nI did not agree with how Tim Connelly constructed the roster post-bubble. The Nuggets had no wing defenders (see legendary list below) while returning with an ill-fitting unit. The Nuggets returned stagnant, yet one-way, recognizable, respected names in Gary Harris, Paul Millsap, and Will Barton to the starting lineup. Connelly also drafted two projects in Zeke Nnaji and RJ Hampton. How are those players supposed to contribute to a contender? Hampton more or less played a few games in the rotation and parlayed that into value. Bol Bol was also on the roster as someone who was years away from contributing.\n\nThe Nuggets were committed to Murray and Jokic, with MPJ right on the cusp. How do you fill out the roster after those three players? Defense, length, height, athleticism, and shooting. With where the Nuggets were headed, the roster just was not in a place to compete for a title. That’s where Aaron Gordon comes in.\n\nNuggets Trade for Aaron Gordon\n\nJerami Grant's departure for Detroit was a massive loss for Denver’s identity. There was nothing the Nuggets Front Office could have done to prevent that. Should Malone have started Grant over Millsap sooner in the bubble and before the pandemic hit?\n\nNo doubt, as Millsap’s play was in decline. However, Grant's departure allowed for the Nuggets to get a better Jokić fit in Aaron Gordon. The Nuggets trading Gary Harris, RJ Hampton, and a first-round pick was a massive win overall for the franchise. The result worked for Tim Connelly, but I did not agree with the process. Gordon was a better defensive fit around Jokić as a rim protector, individual matchup defender, and as a team defender. Gordon also bought into an offensive role that Grant might not have agreed to.\n\nJamal Murray Tears ACL\n\nThe Nuggets were rolling after the Gordon trade. They were undefeated in that span while winning by a large margin in each game. Then, the worst happens. I remember being in a Twitter space with Ryan Blackburn and other Nuggets fans watching Denver-Golden State. The moment Jamal Murray grabbed his knee mid-layup, the whole space went silent, and Ryan ended it immediately.\n\nThe worst outcome to happen was a torn ACL. The Nuggets truly looked like a championship contender for the first time in their reign. The Nuggets went on to lose to the Suns in a sweep in Round 2, after beating the Blazers in 6 games (shoutout to Austin Rivers). The Nuggets championship hopes were put on hold.\n\nMichael Porter Jr Tweaks back again\n\nIn back-to-back years, Murray and MPJ suffered season-ending injuries. MPJ slipped on a layup, having to have another back surgery. The narrative around this time was brutal. Was MPJ an albatross contract? Were the Nuggets wasting Jokic’s prime? Was Murray scared to return? The only “positive” to having two franchise players out was Jokić expanding his offensive repertoire to unfound heights, and winning consecutive MVPs in the process. The Nuggets went out to the Warriors in 5 largely uninspiring games.\n\nThe Nuggets roster was failing Jokić. One-way and undersized players such as Facu Campazzo, Bryn Forbes, and Bones Hyland littered the roster. While veteran players in Monte Morris and Will Barton had to be replaced. I actually published an article below detailing how important the offseason was for Denver. No doubt, big changes had to be made in order for the Nuggets to contend once again.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@ct.fazio/the-denver-nuggets-most-important-season-lies-ahead-cbca96f1fbf7\n\nCalvin Booth In, Tim Connelly out\n\nLet me start by saying right here; Tim Connelly was a very solid executive for the Nuggets. His draft record speaks for itself with the amount of hits he had, and where he had them. (Jokić at 41, Murray at 7, MPJ at 14, Morris at 51, Jarred Vanderbilt at 41, Jusuf Nurkić at 16, Gary Harris at 19, and Malik Beasley at 19.) He signed Paul Millsap. His trades for Aaron Gordon and Will Barton also aged fantastically.\n\nHowever, I was very vocal on Twitter that a new voice in the Nuggets Front Office might have been a good thing. I thought Connelly the past two years had in particular failed to find playable pieces around the margins like he once did (Morris, Craig, Dozier). I thought he also held onto certain players for too long of a time (Millsap, Barton, Harris).\n\nConnelly stocked the roster with undersized guards, the worst archetype to complement Jokić and Murray, while also taking developmental projects in the draft. When Connelly left for Minnesota, I was appreciative of his efforts toward building the Nuggets into what they are now, but, I also was looking forward to a new voice in management.\n\nWhat Calvin Booth did in his first year as the Nuggets' lead executive was nothing short of impeccable. He quickly made his vision clear by adding taller, lengthier, more athletic wings to the roster. He immediately snagged NBA champion Kentavious Caldwell-Pope from the Wizards for Barton and Morris.\n\nHe then drafted NCAA champion Christian Braun from Kansas at pick 21 (who would later go on to help win a Finals game), then selected project Peyton Watson at 30. He then signed Bruce Brown from Free Agency to remake the Nugget's identity as defensive-oriented, perimeter savvy, and more tall and athletic in the backcourt. Those three moves helped the Nuggets win a championship. The floor of those players made it so that Jokić was able to lift them offensively while providing the requisite defensive help needed to aid Jokić.\n\nBooth also seamlessly handled a young player with promise in Bones Hyland, asking for a trade midseason. Bones was a very divisive figure in Denver. The talent was there, however, his skill set was not really conducive to the Nuggets becoming solve-proof. He was a poor defender, who had a very unpredictable shot selection. Booth traded him to help with the locker room, and it was the right move, regardless of the return.\n\nThe Nuggets were now perfectly constructed with barely any weak points. They had two offensive anchors in Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokić. They had a third option in MPJ who was needed on both ends to lift Denver from contender to champion, they had two defensive anchors in KCP and Aaron Gordon, and they also had one jack of all trades, while being a bowling ball to the rim in Bruce Brown, and also Christian Braun, who had the task of aiding the Nuggets defensive attack against strong wings and guards.\n\nWhat the Nuggets Championship Means\n\nThe Nuggets Championship was a win for a fanbase that had been disrespected for decades. The Jokić disrespect was at an all-time high throughout the season. This was a win for patient team building through the draft. Jokić obviously is the key, but for teams who keep rushing rebuilds, this was emblematic of staying the course.\n\nThis was a win for Jamal Murray mattering as a number two option. This was a win for Michael Porter Jr. shedding the label of being a poor teammate and not providing value for a contender. This was a win for Aaron Gordon buying into Jokić ball, and being rewarded for his efforts. This was a win for Michael Malone, who many people wanted to be fired at various points in time. Lastly, this was a win for Nikola Jokić, being good enough to anchor a championship team as the best player.\n\nDo the Nuggets Repeat\n\nCalvin Booth’s offseason plan was fascinating yet scary. Bruce Brown left in Free Agency, where there was nothing the franchise could do monetarily. Jeff Green also left, but there were players on the roster who were more impactful.\n\nThe Vlatko Cancar injury hurts, as someone who was a connector and shooter with the bench, and when Gordon or MPJ sat. I really hope Vlatko gets another chance in a Nuggets uniform. Christian Braun, Zeke Nnaji, and Peyton Watson are all in line for extended roles. Reggie Jackson is slated to play backup point guard after not cracking the playoff lineup.\n\nBooth drafted three rookies to the roster: Julian Strawther, Jalen Pickett, and Hunter Tyson. The move is a gamble, no doubt. One of those three guys has to hit for the move to work. However, with the new CBA in place and with DEN’s roster constraints, a move like this makes some sense. Did Booth pick the right players? I am not sure yet, but Strawther was a player I advocated for since January of 2023. Christian Braun was another player I heavily pined for in the last draft as well.\n\nThe Nuggets have the most potent starting five in the league. Can Denver find contributions from other unsung players to put them in a position to repeat? That’s the fun of thinking about basketball. The Nuggets won a championship for the first time in their history. I am going to sit back and enjoy the ride. As Michael Porter Jr said in his postgame interview, “I’m an NBA champion, no one could tell me nothing!”"
