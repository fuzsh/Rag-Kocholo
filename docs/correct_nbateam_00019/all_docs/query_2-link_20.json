        "text": "Rarely does a sports hero come along who seemingly has it all — class, athletic toughness and a deep community connection and belief in giving back.\n\nChauncey Billups had all of that and more.\n\nWe knew this day was coming — when Billups would announce his retirement from the NBA. But it is hard to conjure a basketball season without Mr. Big Shot on the hardwood, knocking down three-pointers, leading fast breaks or backing down an opponent in the low post.\n\nAn all-state player for George Washington High in Denver, he became a star both at the University of Colorado and in the NBA, where he earned a championship ring, a Finals MVP honor and all-star selections. He returned to the Denver Nuggets in 2008 to lead the team to the playoffs.\n\nBut the King of Park Hill is a homegrown hero who never forgot his roots and remained a humble example of excellence both on the court and in the public eye. He pushed noble causes, launched a foundation to raise money for low-income families and was a constant advocate for education.\n\nWe’re going to miss Mr. Big Shot on the court. But word is he is seeking a front-office job. The Nuggets would be smart to bring him home once again."
