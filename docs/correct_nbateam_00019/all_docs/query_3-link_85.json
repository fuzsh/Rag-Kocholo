        "text": "For a second time, Chauncey Billups is not leaving the Detroit Pistons under his own terms.\n\nThe first time occurred in November 2008 when the 2004 NBA Finals MVP was traded to the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe second time came today when the Pistons decided not to pick up the $2.5 million option of the final season of the two-year deal he signed last summer.\n\n\"Chauncey Billups will always be a valued member of the Detroit Pistons' family,\" Pistons president of basketball operations and coach Stan Van Gundy said in a release. \"Decisions like these are always difficult to make and we certainly wish Chauncey and his family the best in the future.\"\n\nThere are indications that Billups, now an unrestricted free agent as teams can start shopping, will try to continue his career by latching on with another team. If he finds the market limited, he will likely retire and start chasing his stated goal of landing a job in an NBA front office.\n\n\"Chauncey Billups embodies what it means to be a member of the Detroit Pistons,\" Pistons owner Tom Gores said in a release. \"His leadership, dedication and excellence both on and off the court provide a great example for aspiring young athletes. He will forever be a welcome member of the Pistons' family, and I am confident that after his playing days are over he will have a long and bright future in this league.\"\n\nBillups told KUSA-TV in his hometown of Denver recently that he still hadn't made a firm decision.\n\n\"You don't want to end the way that my last couple of seasons ended,\" said Billups, was who limited to 22 or fewer games each of the last three seasons because of injuries.\n\nBillups, 37, signed with the Pistons last off-season and was expected to provide veteran leadership. He was part of an off-season splash that raised expectations.\n\n\"I feel like I've still got some good years of basketball left,\" Billups said at the time. \"I've said it, time and time again, that I always wanted to be remembered as a Piston.\n\n\"This city and this organization is huge, and rich in basketball tradition. Even with me being away on the other teams that I've been on the last few years, I hate to see the Palace look the way it looks during games, with nobody watching.\"\n\nBut a balky knee that ultimately required surgery limited him to only 19 games this past season. And the season was a disaster and ultimately coach Maurice Cheeks was fired after 50 games and longtime Pistons president Joe Dumars' tenure ended after the season.\n\nNot exactly a triumphant return for Billups.\n\nBut he will always be remembered for being the leader of the Pistons when they were making annual treks to the Eastern Conference finals. The highlight was the 2004 world title.\n\nIf it's over, he ends his 16-year career with career averages of 15.2 points and 5.4 assists.\n\n\"It's been very frustrating,\" Billups told the Denver TV station of his injury-marred last few seasons. \"But as we know, Father Time is undefeated.\n\n\"But I can't be too frustrated, I got a lot of miles and a lot of use out of my body.\"\n\nReportedly, former Pistons coach and current Timberwolves executive and coach Flip Saunders wants Billups for his staff.\n\n\"That's a no comment, I plead the Fifth,\" Billups told the Denver station.\n\nThe Pistons have four point guards on the roster (Brandon Jennings, Will Bynum, Peyton Siva and second-round draft pick Spencer Dinwiddie). The Pistons will be in the market for a backup point guard in the off-season. They will have $13.5 million to spend during the free-agency period that begins at midnight tonight."
