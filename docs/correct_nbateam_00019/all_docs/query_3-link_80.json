        "text": "Guess who’s headed back to Motown? 2004 NBA Finals MVP Chauncey Billups is re-joining the Detroit Pistons, having agreed to a two-year deal worth a bit over $5 million. Per Yahoo! Sports: “Billups, 36, hopes to finish his career where it blossomed in the glory years of the Billups-Richard Hamilton-Ben Wallace Pistons of the mid-2000s. Billups will play the part of mentor for young Detroit guard Brandon Knight, and be a rotation guard off the bench for Detroit. Pistons general manager Joe Dumars has long regretted trading Billups to the Denver Nuggets for the expiring contract of Allen Iverson in the 2008-09 season. Now, Dumars has brought back Billups with a mandate to nurture and perform for the Pistons. For Billups, the trade sent him to his hometown Nuggets, where he played an immense part in the maturity of Carmelo Anthony and the franchise’s growth into a Western Conference finalist. For the Pistons, the loss of Billups started a spiral that eventually led to four straight non-playoff seasons. Now, Billups returns with a mandate to help Detroit’s talented young core reach the postseason again under new coach Mo Cheeks.”"
