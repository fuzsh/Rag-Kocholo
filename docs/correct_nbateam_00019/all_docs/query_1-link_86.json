        "text": "DETROIT | The Detroit Pistons shook the NBA in a big way Monday - landing former MVP Allen Iverson from the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe Pistons gave up All-Star point guard and former NBA finals MVP Chauncey Billups, top reserve Antonio McDyess and project Cheikh Samb.\n\n\"We just felt it was the right time to change our team,\" Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars told The Associated Press. \"Iverson gives us a dimension that we haven't had here and we really think it's going to help us.\"\n\nIverson is in the final year of his contract, making $20.8 million this season. He could debut with the Pistons on Wednesday night in Toronto.\n\n\"He was very excited about the trade,\" Iverson's agent, Leon Rose, told the AP.\n\nBillups is in the second season of a four-year contract worth a guaranteed $46 million with a $14 million team option for a fifth year.\n\nThe Pistons kept McDyess off the free-agent market by giving him a $13.5 million, two-year contract extension, and they would love to have him back if the cost-cutting Nuggets buy out his contract.\n\n\"Two teams had one common problem, or challenge,\" Nuggets executive Mark Warkentien said. \"I think the Pistons looked at (Rodney) Stuckey and saw him as the point guard of tomorrow, and you have an All-Star in Chauncey who was in his way.\n\n\"We're just thrilled with the way J.R. (Smith) is progressing and he had a Hall of Famer in front of him. You understand the motivation of both teams.\"\n\nThe blockbuster deal comes two games into the season for Detroit.\n\nBillups returns to familiar surroundings - he was born in Denver and played in college at Colorado.\n\nThe addition of Billups might placate Nuggets fans who have watched the once free-spending franchise trade defensive standout Marcus Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers in the offseason and recently decline to extend Linas Kleiza's contract."
